"Tymczasem spostrzegłam, że trawa schnie pod moimi stopami, powietrze gwałtownie rozżarza się, a ptaki padają martwe w przelocie. Poznałam, że duchy, wiedząc o tym, co ma nastąpić, zaczynają się już zgromadzać. Pobliskie drzewo samo się zapaliło, buchnęło kłębami dymu, które, zamiast wznieść się do góry, otoczyły moją jaskinię i pogrążyły mnie w ciemnościach. Niedźwiedzica leżąca u mych nóg zdawała się ożywiać i oczy jej zabłysły ogniem, który na chwilę rozproszył ciemności. Natenczas z paszczy jej wyskoczył zły duch pod postacią skrzydlatego węża. Był to Nemrael, duch ostatniego stopnia, którego przeznaczono na moje usługi. Wkrótce potem usłyszałam rozmowę w języku egregorów. najznakomitszych strąconych aniołów, i zrozumiałam, że uczynią mi zaszczyt towarzyszenia przy pierwszym moim wejściu w świat istot pośrednich. Mowa ta jest tą samą. w jakiej Enoch napisał swoją księgę, dzieło, nad którym głęboko się zastanawiałam.","Meanwhile, I noticed that the grass was drying beneath my feet, the air was hotter, and the birds were falling dead in passing. I learned that the ghosts, knowing what was to come, were already starting to gather. A nearby tree caught fire, puffed up smoke that, instead of rising up, surrounded my cave and plunged me into darkness. The bear lying at my feet seemed to come alive, and her eyes flashed with fire that dispersed the darkness for a moment. Then an evil spirit jumped out of her mouth in the form of a winged serpent. It was Nemrael, the spirit of the last order assigned to my service. Shortly thereafter, I heard a conversation in the language of Egregors. the greatest fallen angels, and I understood that they would honor me to accompany me on my first entry into the world of midway creatures. This speech is the same. in which Enoch wrote his book, a work on which I pondered deeply.","Meanwhile, I saw the grass wither, the air grew heavy with a fiery vapour, and the birds expired in midflight. I believed that the evil spirits, put on their guard, were beginning to assemble. A tree spontaneously burst into flames; swirls of smoke emerged from it that instead of rising up surrounded my cave and plunged me into darkness. The she-bear at my feet seemed to revive and its eyes glinted with a fieriness that for a moment dispelled the gloom. A devil then came out of its mouth, in the shape of a winged serpent. It was Nemrael, demon of the lowest order, who was destined to serve me. But soon afterwards I heard voices speaking the language of the grigori, the most illustrious of the fallen angels, and I realized that they were doing me the honour of assisting at my reception into the world of intermediary beings. This language is the same in which the first book of Enoch is written, a work that I had studied in particular depth.","Meanwhile I saw the grass wither, the air fill with a fiery vapour and birds falling dead in mid-flight. I inferred that the demons, forewarned, were gathering. A tree spontaneously burst into flames; from it emerged swirls of smoke which did not rise but surrounded my cave and plunged me into darkness. The she-bear lying at my feet seemed to come back to life again. Her eyes sparkled with fire which momentarily dispelled the darkness. An evil spirit emerged from her mouth in the shape of a winged serpent. It was Nemrael, a demon of the lowest order, who had been chosen to serve me. Soon after, I heard words uttered in the language of the Grigori, the most famous of the fallen angels, and I realized that they were honouring me by their presence at my induction into the world of intermediary beings.

"W mieście włoskim, zwanym Ferrarą, żył raz pewien młodzieniec imieniem Landolfo. Był to rozpustnik bez czci i wiary, który zgrozą przejmował wszystkich pobożnych mieszkańców. Niegodziwiec ten przebywał najchętniej w towarzystwie wszetecznych kobiet; znał je wszystkie, żadna jednak nie podobała mu się tak, jak Bianka de Rossi, ponieważ wszystkie inne przewyższała w rozwiązłości.","In an Italian city called Ferrara, there once lived a young man named Landolfo. He was a debaucher without reverence and faith, who terrified all pious inhabitants. This wicked man was most willing to associate with prostitutes; he knew them all, but he did not like any of them as much as Bianka de Rossi, for she was superior to all others in licentiousness.","In a town in Italy called Ferrara, there was a young man called Landulphe. He was a faithless libertine and detested by all good souls from thereabouts. This wicked fellow was passionately fond of frequenting whores, and he had gone the rounds of all those in town, but none pleased him as much as Bianca de Rossi, because she surpassed all the others in immorality.","There was once a young man whose name was Landulpho, who lived in a town in Italy called Ferrara. He was a free-thinker and a rake and was looked upon with horror by all the good souls in the town.

The one who pleased him most was Bianca de Rossi because she was the most depraved of all of them."
"Tak przepędzaliśmy dni jeden za drugim, z tą różnicą, że w zimie zasiadaliśmy koło komina, w lecie zaś na ławce przypartej do zamkowej bramy. Sześć lat upłynęło w tym słodkim spokoju i gdy teraz je sobie przypominam, zdaje mi się, że każdy rok nie trwał dłużej niż tydzień.","This is how we spent our days one after the other, with the difference that in winter we sat next to the chimney, and in summer on a bench leaning against the castle gate. Six years have passed in this sweet peace, and as I remember it now, it seems to me that each year did not last more than a week.","So our days went by and nothing affected their uniformity, except that in summer, instead of sitting round the fireplace, we sat on benches that stood by the door. Three whole years passed in such sweet tranquillity, and now they seem to me like so many weeks.",So we spent our days with nothing to change their pattern except that in summer we sat down not around the fireplace but on the seats in front of the castle door.

"Śród tego Monaldi poległ w jednej z wypraw i mój ojciec, objąwszy dowództwo nad bandą, chciał zabłysnąć świetnym jakimś czynem. Uczynił wiec zasadzkę na drodze do Salerno na konwój pieniędzy wysłanych przez wicekróla Sycylii. Wyprawa się udała, ale ojciec mój został kulą muszkietową postrzelony w krzyż i nie mógł już dalej trudnić się rzemiosłem. Chwila, w której żegnał się z towarzyszami, była niewypowiedzianie rozrzewniająca. Zapewniają, że kilku rozbójników na cały głos się rozpłakało, czemu z trudnością bym wierzył, gdybym raz w życiu sam nie był gorzko płakał, zamordowawszy moją kochankę, jak to wam później opowiem.","Among them, Monaldi died in one of the expeditions, and my father, taking command of the gang, wanted to shine with some brilliant deed. He made an ambush on his way to Salerno for a convoy of money sent by the viceroy of Sicily. The expedition was successful, but my father was shot in the cross with a musket bullet and he could no longer pursue the craft. The moment he was bidding farewell to his companions was beyond words. They assure that a few robbers cried out loud, which I would have a hard time believing, if I hadn't been crying bitterly after murdering my lover, as I will tell you later.","About that time, Monaldi was killed in action, and my father, who took command of the band, wanted to make his debut with some spectacular feat. He went and set up ambush on the road to Salerno, to await a delivery of money sent by the Viceroy of Sicily. The venture succeeded, but my father was wounded in the back by a musket-shot, which meant he was unable to serve any longer. The moment when he took leave of the band was extraordinarily moving. It is even said that several of the bandits wept, which I would find hard to believe had I myself not wept once in my life, and that was after having stabbed my mistress, which I shall tell you about in due course.","At about this time Monaldi was killed in a skirmish and my father took over the command of the band. As he wanted to begin with a brilliant action, he lay in wait on the road to Salerno for the consignment of money being sent by the viceroy of Sicily. The ambush came off but my father was wounded by a musket shot in the back, which soon put an end to his career. The moment of parting from the band was extraordinarily moving. It is even said that some of the bandits wept. I would find this difficult to believe if I had not once in my life wept after having stabbed my mistress to death, as you will discover in due course."

But we will begin by taking a little nourishment.’"
"Wołania te zbudziły mego brata; wszedł do mnie i myśląc, że jestem chora, dał mi uspokajające lekarstwo. Wrócił jeszcze w południe i znalazłszy, że puls bije mi gwałtownie, ofiarował się dalej prowadzić za mnie moje prace kabalistyczne. Z wdzięcznością przyjęłam tę ofiarę, gdyż sama do niczego nie byłam zdolna. Ku wieczorowi zasnęłam i miałam sny cale odmienne od tych, jakie dotąd mnie nawiedzały. Nazajutrz marzyłam na jawie, czyli raczej byłam tak roztargniona, że sama nie wiedziałam, co mówię. Spojrzenia brata wywoływały na lica moje niewytłumaczony rumieniec. Tym sposobem przeszło osiem dni.","These calls woke my brother up; he came in and, thinking I was sick, gave me a sedative medicine. He returned at noon and, finding my pulse beating violently, offered to continue my Kabbalistic work for me. I accepted this sacrifice with gratitude, because I was incapable of doing anything myself. Toward evening, I fell asleep and had dreams completely different from those that had haunted me so far. The next day I was daydreaming, or rather distracted, that I didn't know what I was saying. My brother's glances made my faces blush inexplicably. In this way, eight days have passed.","My cries woke my brother. He came into my room, and thinking I was ill, he gave me a sedative. He returned at midday, and finding my pulse was fast, he offered to continue my cabbalistic operations for me. I accepted, for it would have been impossible for me to do the work. I fell asleep towards evening, and my dreams were very different from those I had dreamt until then. The next day I dreamt while awake, or at least my absent-mindedness might have given that impression, and I blushed for no reason when my brother looked at me. A week of this went by.","My cries had awoken my brother. He came into my bedroom, and believing me to be ill, made me take a sedative. He returned at midday and, finding my pulse was racing, offered himself to continue my cabbalistic exercises for me. I was glad to accept his suggestion for I was in no fit state to work on them. I fell asleep towards evening and my dreams were very different from those I had had until then. The next day I dreamed while fully awake, or at least I was so absent-minded that I might well have given that impression."

"Nowy szejk rządził w duchu swego poprzednika i również znikał ostatniego piątku każdego miesiąca. Ten stan rzeczy trwał dopóty, dopóki Kordowa nie otrzymała swoich kalifów, zupełnie niezawisłych od władców Bagdadu. Natenczas górale Alpuhary, którzy brali czynny udział w tych zmianach, zacząli osiedlać się na równinach, gdzie wkrótce zasłynęli pod nazwiskiem Abencerragów. Inni zaś. którzy pozostali wierni szejkowi z Kassar-Gomelezu, zatrzymali miano Gomelezów.","The new sheikh ruled in the spirit of his predecessor and also disappeared on the last Friday of every month.

"Spojrzałem na pustelnika, aby odgadnąć z jego oczu, co myśli o tym zamiarze.

"Podczas gdy spożywaliśmy tę skromną ucztę, ujrzeliśmy wchodzącego człowieka, chudego i wybladłego, którego cała postać miała w sobie coś przerażającego, chociaż nie można było rzec, co właściwie takie wrażenie wywołuje. Nieznajomy ukląkł przede mną i zdjął kapelusz. Wtedy ujrzałem, że ma owiązane czoło. Wyciągnął ku mnie kapelusz, jak gdyby prosił o jałmużnę. Rzuciłem mu sztukę złota. Szczególny żebrak podziękował mi i dodał:","While we were eating this modest feast, we saw a man enter, thin and pale, whose entire figure had something terrifying about him, though it was impossible to say what exactly made that impression. The stranger knelt in front of me and took off his hat. Then I saw that his forehead was tied. He held out his hat to me as if asking for alms. I tossed him a gold piece. A special beggar thanked me and added:","Then the hermit brought our breakfast, which consisted of hot milk and chestnuts. At the end of our meal the hermit said to me: “Ask this gentleman if he would kindly tell us his story.","As we were eating, we saw a gaunt, lean man come in.

The extraordinary beggar thanked me and added, ‘Señor Alphonse, your good deed will not go unrewarded."

"Po skończonym obiedzie zaczęliśmy przebiegać komnaty i przybyliśmy do tej, w której spałem pierwszego dnia od wyjazdu z Andujar. Poznałem moje nieszczęsne posłanie i usiadłszy na nim. jąłem rozmyślać nad tym wszystkim, co mi się wydarzyło, szczególniej zaś nad wypadkami, które zaszły w jaskini. Przypomniałem sobie, że Emina uprzedziła mnie, ażebym nie dawał wiary, gdyby mi co złego o niej mówiono. Właśnie pogrążyłem się w tych myślach, gdy kabalista zwrócił uwagę na coś błyszczącego, utkwionego między szparami podłogi. Spojrzałem bliżej i przekonałem się, że są to relikwie, zabrane mi przez siostry w jaskini. Widziałem, jak je wrzucały w rozpadlinę skały, a teraz znajdowałem je w szparze podłogi. W istocie, zacząłem powątpiewać, czym wychodził kiedy z tej przeklętej gospody i czy pustelnik, inkwizytor, bracia Zota nie byli widmami spłodzonymi przez obłęd czarodziejski. Tymczasem za pomocą szpady dobyłem relikwie i zawiesiłem je z powrotem na szyi.","After lunch, we started running through the chambers and arrived at the one where I slept on the first day after leaving Andujar. I recognized my wretched bed and sat on it. I started to meditate on everything that had happened to me, especially the events that had happened in the cave. I remembered that Emin had warned me not to believe if anything bad was told about her. I was just immersed in these thoughts when the kabbalist noticed something shiny, stuck between the cracks in the floor. I looked closer and found that they were relics taken from me by the sisters in the cave. I had seen them throw them into a chasm in the rock, and now I found them in a crack in the floor. In fact, I began to doubt what he had left this damn inn when he was, and whether the hermit, inquisitor, and the Zota brothers were ghosts begotten by wizarding madness. Meanwhile, with my sword, I drew the relics and hung them back around my neck.","We duly entered the inauspicious Venta and found in the dining room a table laid for a meal, with a pheasant pâté and two bottles of wine.","When we had eaten we went from room to room and came to where I had slept on the day I left Andújar. I recognized my miserable pallet bed, sat down on it and began reflecting on all that had happened to me and especially on the events in the caves. I did not forget that Emina had warned me not to believe any ill which might be said of her. I was absorbed in these thoughts when the cabbalist pointed out to me something which was glinting between the loose-fitting planks of the floor. I looked more closely and saw that it was the relic which the two sisters had removed from my neck. I had seen them throw it into a crevice in the rock and now I discovered it in a gap in the floorboards. I began to believe that I had never left that damned inn, and the hermit, the inquisitor and Zoto’s brothers were so many ghostly apparitions produced by magical spells. Meanwhile with the help of my sword I recovered the relic and put it round my neck again."
"- O! co się tyczy tego klejnotu - odparłem szybko - nie żądajcie go ode mnie. Przyrzekłem mojej matce, że go nigdy nie zdejmę, i sądzę, że nie ty powinnaś wątpić, jak umiem dotrzymywać moich przyrzeczeń.","- ABOUT! As for this gem, I replied quickly, don't ask for it of me. I promised my mother that I would never take it off, and I don't think you should doubt how I can keep my promises.","I searched for arguments against them. I found none. I stammered out a few words about proprieties, honour, the difference between our creeds.","‘Oh no, as to that jewel, don’t ask me for it,’ I promptly replied. ‘I promised my mother that I would never be parted from it and I keep my promises, as you very well know.’"
"- Przyjacielu nasz, pomyśl, że szatan jest wiecznym wrogiem człowieka i że aby mu zaszkodził, nie potrzeba go zapraszać ani wzywać po nazwisku.","- Our friend, think that Satan is the eternal enemy of man and that in order to harm him, it is not necessary to invite him or call him by name.","And one of them said to him: “My friend Thibaud, remember that the devil is the eternal enemy of mankind and does us harm enough without any invitation, and without his name being invoked.”","One of them said, ‘Messire, my good friend, remember that the devil is the eternal enemy of mankind and he does enough mischief without being invited and his name being invoked.’"
"Widmo zbliżyło się wolnymi kroki i zasiadło do stolu, jak gdyby chciało wieczerzać. Landolfo z odwagą, jaką samo tylko piekło mogło go natchnąć, podsunął mu półmisek. Widmo otworzyło tak wielką paszczę, że głowa zdawała mu się łupać na dwoje, i zionęło czerwonym płomieniem; następnie wyciągnęło osmolona rękę, wzięło kawałek, połknęło go i wnet usłyszano, jak spadał pod stół. Tym sposobem pożarło cały półmisek, ale wszystkie kawałki upadały pod stół. Wtedy, zwracając straszliwe oczy na Landolfa, rzekło:","The specter approached slowly and sat down at the table as if to dine. Landolfo, with courage as hell alone could infuse him, offered him the dish. The specter opened a mouth so great that its head seemed to split in two, and it breathed red flame; then it reached out a sooty hand, took a piece, swallowed it, and it was soon heard as it fell under the table. This way it ate the entire dish, but all the pieces fell under the table. Then, turning fearful eyes on Landolf, she said:","The apparition slowly advanced and sat down at table as though to have supper. With a courage the devil alone could have inspired, Landulphe dared to pick up a platter and offer it to the ghost, which opened a mouth so large that its head seemed to split in two, and a reddish flame came out. Then the ghost stretched out a hand that was all burned, took a morsel and swallowed it; the food could be heard falling under the table. When the platter was empty, the ghost fixed Landulphe with its terrible eyes and said:","The phantom walked slowly forwards and sat down at table as though to dine. With a courage that could only have been inspired by the devil, Landulpho boldly took up a dish and presented it to her. The phantom opened her mouth so wide that her head seemed to split in two.

In this way she devoured the whole dish and all the morsels fell to the floor. When the dish was empty the phantom stared at Landulpho with terrible eyes and said to him, ‘Landulpho, whenever I dine here I sleep here also."

"Pomimo tych miłych wspomnień postarał się jednak o umieszczenie w suchym miejscu łóżka swojej małżonki. W obszernym bawialnym pokoju był komin flamandzki, przy którym piętnaście osób mogło grzać się wygodnie. Wystające sklepienie tego komina tworzyło niejako dach, podparty z każdej strony dwiema kolumienkami. Zabito więc dymnik i pod tym dachem postawiono łóżko mojej matki, stolik i jedno krzesło; ponieważ zaś palenisko kominka było wyższe o jedną stopę w stosunku do poziomu podłogi, stanowiło przeto wyspę dość nieprzystępną dla powodzi.","Despite these fond memories, he made sure to put his wife's bed in a dry place. In the spacious living room there was a Flemish chimney, by which fifteen people could comfortably warm up. The protruding vault of this chimney formed a kind of roof, supported on each side by two columns. So the chimney was killed and under this roof my mother's bed, table and one chair were placed; and since the hearth was one foot higher than the level of the floor, it was therefore an island quite inaccessible to flooding.","However, his first concern was to put his wife’s bed in a dry place.

Zimno mu odpowiedziałem, że wielce szanuję jego święte przestrogi, ale że poczucie honoru jest główną zasadą mego postępowania, po czym zaczęliśmy mówić o czym innym.","I was impatient with the hermit's insistence in demanding from me confessions that I did not want to make him. I told him coldly that I greatly respected his holy warnings, but that a sense of honor was the main principle of my conduct, and we began to talk about something else.","This persistence of the hermit in demanding of me confessions I did not want to make greatly displeased me. I replied rather coldly, saying that I respected his holy exhortations but that I conducted myself in accordance only with the laws of honour. Then the conversation turned to other matters.","I disliked intensely the hermit’s persistence in asking of me a confession which I did not want to make. I replied to him coldly that although I respected his saintly exhortations, the code of honour was my guide. Then we spoke of other matters."
"W tydzień potem żona Lunarda przyszła odwiedzić moją matkę. Tym razem miała włosy splecione w jeden zwinięty warkocz, przytwierdzony wielką złotą szpilką, zakończoną misternie wyrobioną rubinową różą. Ta złota róża zapuściła w serce mojej matki dotkliwe kolce. Znowu zaczęła się dręczyć i nie pierwej przestała, aż ojciec przyrzekł, że kupi jej taką samą szpilkę. Jednakże szpilka podobna kosztowała czterdzieści pięć uncji i ojciec, nie mając ani tyle pieniędzy, ani sposobów nabycia ich, wkrótce wpadł w tenże sam smutek, w jakim przed kilkoma dniami moja matka zostawała.","A week later, Lunard's wife came to visit my mother. This time, her hair was braided into a single coiled braid, held in place by a large golden pin ended in an elaborately crafted ruby rose. This golden rose has thrown severe spikes into my mother's heart. She began to torment herself again, and did not stop until her father promised he would buy her the same pin. However, a pin like it cost forty-five ounces, and my father, having neither the money nor the means of acquiring it, soon fell into the same grief that my mother had stayed in a few days ago.","But a week later Lunardo’s wife came to my mother’s house to return her visit. Her hair was braided and coiled, and held in place with a gold pin, the head of which was a filigree rose embellished with a small ruby. This golden rose drove a cruel thorn into my mother’s heart. She fell back into her state of melancholy and only recovered from it when my father had promised her a pin like that of her sister. However, since my father had neither the money nor the means to obtain one, and since a pin of that kind cost forty-five ounces, he soon became as melancholy as my mother had been a few days before.","But a week later Lunardo’s wife paid a visit to my mother. She had had her hair braided and coiled, and it was held in place by a golden pin, the head of which was a filigree rose with a little ruby inset. This golden rose drove a cruel thorn in my mother’s heart. She relapsed into melancholy until my father promised her a pin like that of her sister. However, as my father had no money and no means of procuring any, and as such a pin cost forty-five gold ounces, he became as gloomy as my mother had been a few days before."
"Ben Mamun odszedł i zostawił nas. że tak powiem, panami całego zamku. Pustelnik wziął z biblioteki legendę o pierwszych ojcach, żyjących samotnie na pustym. i rozkazał Paszekowi, aby mu przeczytał kilka rozdziałów. Ja wyszedłem na taras zamkowy, zwieszający się nad przepaścią, w głębi której niewidzialny potok huczał z łoskotem. Jakkolwiek okolica smutną mi się wydała, z niesłychanym jednak zadowoleniem wpatrywałem się w nią lub raczej oddawałem się wrażeniom niezwykłego widoku. Nie tyle smutek mnie ogarnął, jak raczej wszystkie władze mego umysłu uległy odrętwieniu, wywołanemu przez okropne wzruszenia, jakich w ciągu tych kilku dni doznałem. Im bardziej zastanawiałem się nad doświadczonymi przygodami. tym mniej je rozumiałem; nareszcie nie śmiałem już o nich myśleć z obawy, abym całkiem nie postradał rozumu. Nadzieja przepędzenia kilku spokojnych dni w zamku Uzedy ukołysała nieco moją znękaną duszę. Tak rozmyślając, powróciłem do biblioteki. Przy schyłku dnia Mulat zastawił nam wieczerzę, złożoną z zimnego mięsiwa i suchych owoców; nie było jednak mięsa zwierząt nieczystych. Następnie rozłączyliśmy się: zaprowadzono Pustelnika i Paszeka do jednego, mnie zaś do drugiego pokoju.","Ben Mamun left and left us. so to speak, the masters of the entire castle. The hermit took from the library the legend of the first fathers living alone in an empty one. and ordered Pashek to read him a few chapters. I went out to the castle terrace, hanging over the chasm, in the depths of which an invisible stream roared with a thud. As sad as the area seemed to me, I stared at it with unheard-of satisfaction, or rather indulged in the impressions of an unusual sight. It was not so much sadness that overwhelmed me, but all the faculties of my mind became numb because of the terrible emotions I experienced during those few days. The more I reflected on the experienced adventures. the less I understood them; at last I no longer dared to think of them for fear that I might lose my mind completely. Hope to spend a few peaceful days in the castle of Uzeda lulled my tormented soul a bit. Meditating like this, I returned to the library. At the end of the day, the mulatto gave us a supper of cold meat and dry fruit; but there was no flesh of unclean animals. Then we hung up: they led the Hermit and Paszek to one room, and me to the other room.","Ben Mamoun duly retired and left us masters of the house, as it were. The hermit took from the library a Lives of the Desert Fathers, and instructed Pacheco to read him some chapters from it. As for myself, I went out on to the terrace that overlooked a precipice, at the bottom of which flowed a river that was out of sight but the roar of which could be heard. Dreary as this landscape might have seemed, it was with extreme pleasure that I began to contemplate it, or rather to surrender myself to the feelings the sight of it inspired in me. It was not melancholy, it was almost an exhaustion of all my faculties, brought about by the cruel excitements to which I had been victim in the last few days. Pondering on what had happened to me and not being able to make any sense of it, I ended up not daring to give the matter any more thought, for fear of losing my wits. The hope of spending a few quiet days in the Uzeda castle was for the present a most attractive prospect. I left the terrace and came back into the library. Then the young mulatto served us a light meal of dried fruits and cold meats, which included no unclean meat. Afterwards we parted company. The hermit and Pacheco were shown to one room, I to another.","Ben Mamoun then duly withdrew and left us as it were in charge of the house. The hermit took down from the bookcase an account of the lives of the Desert Fathers and told Pacheco to read some chapters aloud to him. I went out on to the terrace, which overlooked a precipice in whose unseen depth there flowed a raging river, which could be heard roaring below. However desolate the countryside looked, it gave me great pleasure to contemplate it, or rather to give myself over to the feeling which it inspired in me as I looked at it. This was not melancholy but rather an annihilation of all my faculties brought about by the many violent emotions to which I had been a prey for the last few days. Having thought much about what had happened to me and having come to no understanding of it, I no longer dared to dwell on it any more for fear of losing my reason. The prospect of spending a few quiet days in the castle of Uzeda was what gave me most hope. I left the terrace and went back into the library. Then the young mulatto served a light meal of dried fruit and cold meats, none from unclean animals. Thereafter we went our own separate ways. The hermit and Pacheco were taken to one bedroom, I to another."
"Gdy zostałam sama, porzuciłam różaniec, wzięłam nożyczki, które miałam u pasa. i rozcięłam zielone sukno zasłaniające mi okno. Wtedy ujrzałam obok drugie okno, a przez to okno - rzęsiste oświeconą komnatę, w której siedziało u stołu trzy młode dziewczęta i trzech młodych ludzi, piękniejszych, niż można sobie wyobrazić. Śpiewali, pili, śmieli się i umizgali do dziewcząt, czasem nawet głaskali je pod brodę, ale z odmiennym wyrazem twarzy niż ów jegomość w Sombre Roche, który jednak po to tylko przyjeżdżał do naszego zamku. Nadto dziewczęta te i owi młodzi ludzie zaczęli po trochu zrzucać odzienie, podobnie jak ja to zwykłam czynić wieczorami przed zwierciadłem. W istocie, robili to tak jak ja, a nie tak jak moja stara ochmistrzyni.","When I was alone, I gave up my rosary and took the scissors from my belt. and I cut open the green cloth covering my window. Then I saw a second window beside me, and through that window a luminous, enlightened room in which sat at the table three young girls and three young people, more beautiful than you can imagine. They sang, drank, laughed and slipped at the girls, sometimes even stroking their chins, but with a different expression on the face of that gentleman in Sombre Roche, who, however, only came to our castle for that. Moreover, these girls and these young people, little by little, began to throw off their clothes, as I used to do in the evenings in front of the mirror. In fact, they did it like I did, not like my old housekeeper.","Once I was alone, I threw down my rosary, took the scissors I had on my belt, and cut a vent in the green cloth covering the windows. Then I saw another window very close by me, and through this window I saw a very brightly lit room, in which three young gentlemen and three young girls – more handsome, more gay than anything imaginable – were having supper. They were singing, drinking, laughing, embracing each other. Sometimes they even took each other by the chin, but quite differently from the gentleman at Châtel de Sombre, albeit he came for that sole purpose. Moreover, these gentlemen and young ladies were gradually shedding their clothes, as I used to in the evenings in front of my large mirror, and in truth it suited them just as well as me, and not as it did my old duenna.","When I found myself alone I threw down the beads, took hold of the scissors I had on my belt and cut a hole in the green cloth covering the window. Through it I saw another window very close to mine, and through that window I saw a brightly lit room in which three young gentlemen and three young girls were eating supper. They were more handsome and merrier than anything imaginable. They sang, they drank, they laughed, they hugged each other. They even took each other by the chin sometimes, but in a very different way from the gentleman at the castle of Sombre, who none the less came to do just that. What is more the gentlemen and the ladies took off more and more clothes, as I used to do in front of my tall mirror in the evening. And truthfully speaking this suited them just as well, not like my governess."
"Wkrótce potem naczelnik zbirów stawił się u mego ojca, odebrawszy jednak sto uncji przeznaczonych dla sprawiedliwości, zaprosił go do siebie na przyjacielską wieczerzę. Udali się do mieszkania przyległego do publicznego więzienia i znaleźli już przy stole nadzorcę więzienia i spowiednika więźniów. Ojciec mój był nieco wzruszony, jak to zwykle bywa po pierwszym morderstwie. Duchowny, spostrzegłszy jego pomieszanie, rzekł:","Shortly thereafter, the chief of thugs showed up at my father's, but having taken a hundred ounces for justice, invited him to his house for a friendly supper. They went to an apartment adjacent to the public prison and found the prison overseer and prisoner confessor at the table. My father was a bit touched, as is usually the case after the first murder. The clergyman, seeing his confusion, said:","Soon afterwards the chief of police turned up at my father’s house. My father at once gave him the one hundred ounces intended for the forces of law and order, and the chief of police invited my father to join him and his friends, at home, for supper. They went to a house built onto the back of the public prison, and they found there, as guests, the barigel and the prisoners’ confessor. My father was a little nervous, as is usual after a first murder. Noticing his agitation, the clergyman said to him: “","Soon after, the chief of the sbiri came to see my father, who immediately gave him the hundred gold ounces destined for the law. Thereupon the chief invited my father to take supper at his house in the company of his friends. They went to a lodging which backed on to the public prison and there they found their fellow-guests to be the barigel4 and the prison chaplain. My father was somewhat upset, as is commonly the case after one has committed one’s first murder. The priest noticed his distress and said to him, ‘Come now, Signor Zoto, no sadness."
"- Spodziewam się, że tego nie uczynisz - rześki margrabia śmiejąc się.","""I hope you won't,"" the brisk margrave, laughing.",The Marquis said with a laugh: “I sincerely hope you won’t.”,"The marchese laughed and said, ‘I sincerely hope that you won’t do so.’"
"Młody rozbójnik imieniem Antonino tak szalenie zakochał się w Sylwii, że nawet nie był w stanie ukryć swojej namiętności. Sam to zauważyłem, ale widząc go smutnym i przygnębionym, mniemałem, że kochanka moja nie jest mu wzajemna, i byłem spokojny. Rad bym był tylko wyleczyć Antonina, kochałem go bowiem za jego odwagę. Znajdował się również w bandzie rozbójnik imieniem Moro, którego, przeciwnie, dla nikczemności sposobu myślenia z całych sił nienawidziłem i gdyby Testa-Lunga chciał mi wierzyć, dawno byłby go już wypędził.","A young robber named Antonino fell so madly in love with Sylwia that he was unable to hide his passion. I saw it myself, but seeing him sad and depressed, I assumed that my lover was not mutual to him, and I was at peace. I would only be glad to heal Antonin, because I loved him for his courage. There was also a robber by the name of Moro, whom I hated with all my strength for the wicked way of thinking, and if Testa-Lunga had wanted to believe me, he would have had driven him out long ago.","A young bandit named Antonino fell in love with Sylvia, and since his passion was very strong, he could not hide it. I noticed it myself, but on seeing how dejected he was, I came to the conclusion that my mistress did not return his love, and I felt easy about it. But I would have liked to cure Antonino, whom I loved for his valour. There was in the gang another bandit called Moro, whom, on the contrary, I hated for his cowardice, and if Testalunga had taken my advice, he would have thrown him out a long time before then.","A young bandit called Antonino fell in love with Sylvia. His was so strong a passion that he could not hide it. I myself noticed it, but seeing that he was very sad I supposed that my mistress had given him no ground for hope and so was not concerned about it. But I would have liked to cure Antonino because I liked him for his courage. There was another member in the band, called Moro, whom I hated on the other hand for his cowardice. If Testalunga had listened to me, he would have driven him out long before then."

"Podziwialiśmy pośpiech gońców kabalisty, następnie prosiliśmy go, aby dotrzymał nam obietnicy i opowiedział wypadki przeszłej nocy w Venta Quemada. Odrzekł nam, podobnie jak poprzedniego dnia, że nie zrozumiemy wielu rzeczy w jego opowiadaniu, ale zastanowiwszy się przez chwilę, zaczął w te słowa:","We admired the rush of the cabalist's messengers, then asked him to keep his promise and to relate the events of last night at Venta Quemada. He told us, like the day before, that we would not understand many things in his story, but after reflecting for a moment, he began with these words:","In Spain I am known as Don Pedro de Uzeda, and it is under this name that I own a pretty castle that lies one league from here.","We complimented the cabbalist on the speed of his couriers. Then we entreated him to keep his promise and tell us what had happened the night before at the Venta Quemada. He replied as before that there would be things in his account which we would not be able to understand. Then, after having pondered for a moment, he began to tell his story."
"Miałem wówczas siódmy rok, gdy ojciec mój złączył się z bandą Monaldiego, i dobrze pamiętam, jak moją matkę, mnie i dwóch moich braci zaprowadzono do więzienia. Wszelako było to tylko dla pozoru, ojciec mój bowiem nie zapomniał zarobkiem swoim podzielić się ze sługami sprawiedliwości, którzy z łatwością dali się przekonać, że nie mamy z ojcem żadnych stosunków. Naczelnik zbirów podczas naszego uwięzienia gorliwie się nami zajmował i nawet skrócił nam czas niewoli.","I was seven at the time when my father joined the Monaldi gang, and I well remember how my mother, me and two of my brothers were taken to prison. However, it was only for the sake of appearances, because my father did not forget to share his earnings with the servants of justice, who were easily convinced that we had no relationship with my father. The chief of thugs was eagerly taking care of us during our imprisonment and even shortened our time in captivity.","my mother, my two brothers and myself. But it was just for form’s sake; since my father had not forgotten the lawmen’s share, they were easily persuaded that we had nothing to do with him. The chief of police showed particular concern for us during our detention, and he even cut short the length of time we were detained.","I may have been seven when my father went off to join the Monaldi band. I remember that my mother, my two brothers and I were taken to prison. But it was only for form’s sake. As my father had never failed to pay his dues to the officers of the law, they did not require much convincing that we were in no way connected with his activities. The chief of the sbiri was particularly attentive to us during our incarceration and even shortened its term."
Odpowiedź ta ucieszyła mego ojca; przez cały wieczór był wesół i z radością na mnie spoglądał.,This answer pleased my father; he was merry all evening and looked at me with joy.,My father seemed satisfied with this reply and was very jolly for the rest of the evening.,This reply seemed to satisfy my father and he was very jolly for the rest of the evening.
"To mówiąc wziął florety, nauczył mnie owego pchnięcia, dał błogosławieństwo na drogę i zaprowadził do powozu. Uściskałem moją matkę i po chwili opuściłem zamek rodzicielski.","Saying this, he took the foils, taught me the thrust, gave me a blessing on the way, and led me to the carriage. I hugged my mother and after a while I left the parental lock.","Then he took some foils, showed me the lunge in question, gave me his blessing and led me to my carriage. I kissed my mother’s hand again, and set off.","He then took up two foils, showed me the pass, gave me his blessing and led me to my waiting carriage. I kissed my mother’s hand again and departed."

"- Panie Zoto. jestem ci więcej winien, aniżeli sam sądzisz. Przed kilkoma dniami znaleziono przypadkiem mój sztylet w ciele człowieka zamordowanego na drodze do Neapolu; sąd posyłał ten sztylet do wszystkich zbrojowników, a ty wspaniałomyślnie oświadczyłeś, że go po raz pierwszy widzisz, jakkolwiek sztylet pochodził z twego warsztatu i mnie samemu go sprzedałeś. Zeznając prawdę, mogłeś mnie wprowadzić w niepotrzebny kłopot. Masz tu więc czterdzieści pięć uncji, których tak potrzebujesz; nadto pomnij, że odtąd kiesa moja jest na twoje rozkazy.","- Mr. Zoto. I owe you more than you think. A few days ago my dagger was accidentally found in the body of a man murdered on the road to Naples; the court sent this dagger to all the armors, and you generously declared that you saw it for the first time, though the dagger came from your workshop and you sold it to me. By testifying the truth, you may have introduced me into unnecessary trouble. So here's the forty-five ounces you so need; moreover, remember that henceforth my purse is at your command.","“Signor Zoto, I am more indebted to you than you know. The other day, it so happened that my dagger was found in the body of a man murdered on the road to Naples. Officers of the law had this dagger taken to all armourers, and you generously attested to having no knowledge of it. Yet it was a weapon you had made and sold to me. If you had told the truth, you could have placed me in a difficult position. So here are the forty-five ounces you need, and furthermore my purse will always be open to you.”","‘Signor Zoto, I am indebted to you more than you know. A few days ago my dagger was by chance found in the body of a man who had been murdered on the road to Naples.

If you had told the truth, it could have caused me some embarrassment. So here are the forty-five gold ounces you need, and if you need more my purse will always be open to you.’"
"Dolina Los Hermanos zaczyna się w miejscu, skąd Gwadalkwiwir rozlewa się po płaszczyźnie. Dolina wzięła nazwę od trzech braci, których wspólna skłonność do rozbojów łączyła daleko więcej niż stosunki pokrewieństwa. Miejsce to długo było widownią niecnych ich postępków. Z trzech braci - dwóch pojmano i przy wejściu do doliny można było widzieć ciała ich. bujające się na szubienicach; trzeci zaś, imieniem Zoto, uciekł z więzień Kordowy i, jak mówiono, schronił się w pasmo Alpuhary.","The Los Hermanos Valley begins where Guadalcivivir spills over the plane. The valley took its name from three brothers whose common propensity for robbery was far more common than kinship. This place has long been the scene of their evil deeds. Of the three brothers, two were captured, and their bodies could be seen at the entrance to the valley. swinging on gallows; and the third, named Zoto, escaped from the prison of Cordova and, it was said, took refuge in the Alpuhara range.","The valley of Los Hermanos begins at the place where the Guadalquivir spreads out across the plain. It is so called because three brothers, united less by blood kinship than by their taste for brigandage, for a long time made it the scene of their exploits. Of the three brothers, two had been captured and their bodies could be seen strung up on a gibbet at the entrance to the valley; but the third, called Zoto, had escaped from the prisons of Cordoba, and was said to have taken refuge in the Alpujarras mountain range.","The valley of Los Hermanos8 begins where the Guadalquivir joins the plain. This valley is so called because three brothers, even more united by their taste for banditry than by their ties of blood, had for a long time made it the scene of their exploits. Two of the three brothers had been caught and their bodies could be seen hanging from the gallows at the entrance to the valley; Zoto, the eldest, had escaped from prison in Córdoba and was thought to have taken refuge in the Alpujarras mountains."

"Las gitanas de Sierra Morena quieren carne de hombres. Nie dość na tym. Podróżny, który odważył się zapuścić w tę dziką okolicę, napastowany bywał, jak mówiono, przez tysiączne okropności, na których widok drżała najzimniejsza odwaga. Słyszał płaczliwe głosy mieszające się z hukiem potoków, śród poświstu burzy mamiły go błędne ogniki, a niewidzialne ręce popychały w bezdenne przepaście.","Las gitanas de Sierra Morena quieren carne de hombres. That's not all. A traveler who dared to venture into this wilderness was harassed, as was said, by thousands of horrors, at the sight of which the coldest courage trembled. He heard tearful voices mingling with the roar of the streams, amidst the glare of the storm, he was deceived by the wisps, and his invisible hands pushed him down the bottomless abyss.","This range that separates Andalusia from La Mancha was then inhabited only by smugglers, bandits, and a few gypsies, who were said to eat the travellers they had murdered – whence the Spanish proverb: Las gitanas de Sierra Morena quieren carne de hombres. And that’s not all. The traveller who ventured into this wild country would, it was said, there find himself assailed by a thousand terrors capable of chilling the boldest spirits. He would hear wailing voices mingling with the rushing of mountain streams and the whistling of the storm, deceptive lights would lead him astray, and invisible hands push him towards bottomless abysses.","’2 But that was not all. Travellers who ventured into that wild country found themselves assailed, it was said, by countless terrors which would make even the stoutest of hearts tremble. Piteous wailing could be heard above the roar of the torrents and the howling of the storm; travellers were lured from their path by will-of-the-wisps, and invisible hands propelled them towards bottomless abysses."

"Nazajutrz rano obudziłem się wcześniej niż poprzedniego dnia i poszedłem odwiedzić moje kuzynki. Emina czytała Koran, Zibelda zaś przymierzała perły i szale. Przerwałem te ważne zatrudnienia słodkimi pieszczotami, w których równie miłość, jak przyjaźń się odzywały. Potem zjedliśmy obiad, a po obiedzie Zoto w te słowa zaczął rozpowiadać dalsze przygody:","The next morning I woke up earlier than the day before and went to visit my cousins. Emina read the Koran, and Zibelda tried on pearls and shawls. I interrupted these important jobs with sweet caresses in which both love and friendship were felt. Then we ate dinner, and after dinner, Zoto began to spread out further adventures with these words:","The next morning I woke earlier than the day before. I went to see my cousins. Emina was reading the Koran, Zibedde was trying on pearls and shawls. I interrupted these serious occupations with sweet caresses, prompted as much by friendship as by love. Then we dined.

Emina was reading the Koran, Zubeida was trying on some pearls and jewels. I interrupted these serious occupations with gentle caresses which were almost as much caresses of friendship as of love.

"Dziś, kiedy przenoszę się pamięcią w szczęśliwe chwile, jakie spędziłem na tej wyspie, widzę, jak bardzo różnią się od okropnych wzruszeń, które miotały całym moim życiem. Ogniste potoki dzieliły nas od reszty ludzi; ogień miłości ogarniał nasze zmysły. Wszystko słuchało moich rozkazów i wszystko ulegało najmniejszym życzeniom kochanej Sylwii. Wreszcie, na domiar mego szczęścia, dwaj moi bracia przybyli do mnie. Obaj doznali nadzwyczajnych przygód i upewniam was, że jeżeli zechcecie kiedy posłuchać ich opowiadań. bez porównania więcej was zabawią ode mnie.","Today, when I remember the happy moments I spent on this island, I can see how different they are from the terrible emotions that thrilled my whole life. Fiery torrents separated us from the rest of the people; the fire of love engulfed our senses. Everything obeyed my orders and everything obeyed the slightest wishes of beloved Sylwia. Finally, to add to my happiness, two of my brothers came to me. They have both experienced extraordinary adventures, and I can assure you that if you want to, some of the stories should be listened to. they will entertain you far more than me.","Now, when I call to mind the time I spent in that happy abode, I see it as though isolated in the midst of the cruel turmoil that has assailed my life. We were separated from the rest of mankind by rivers of fire. There, all obeyed my orders, and all were subject to my beloved Sylvia. Finally, to complete my happiness, my two brothers came to join me. Both had had interesting adventures, and I venture to assure you that if some day you want to hear an account of them it will give you more satisfaction than the story I am telling you.","Now, when I think back to the time I passed in that happy place, it seems to me an island in the middle of the cruel tempests which have assailed my life.

"W trzy lata po ślubie moich rodziców młodsza siostra mojej matki wyszła za mąż za kupca oliwy nazwiskiem Lunardo, który na podarunek ślubny dał jej parę złotych kolczyków i takiż łańcuszek na szyję. Matka, wróciwszy z wesela, zdawała się być pogrążona w głębokim smutku. Mąż chciał dowiedzieć się o przyczynie, ona długo wzbraniała się mu ją wyznać, na koniec odkryła, że trawi ją żal, iż nie ma podobnych, jak siostra kolczyków i łańcuszka. Ojciec nic na to nie odrzekł. Miał w swoim składzie cudownie wyrobioną strzelbę do polowania z takimiż pistoletami i kordelasem. Strzelba, nad którą mój ojciec przez cztery lata pracował, dawała cztery strzały od jednego nabicia. Ojciec cenił ją na trzysta złotych uncji neapolitańskich, wyszedł jednak na miasto i całą broń sprzedał za osiemdziesiąt uncji, następnie kupił kolczyki i łańcuszek i przyniósł je żonie. Matka tego samego dnia poszła pochwalić się przed żoną Lunarda i niesłychanie ucieszyła się, gdy uznano kolczyki jej za daleko piękniejsze i bogatsze.","Three years after my parents' wedding, my mother's younger sister married an olive trader named Lunardo, who gave her a pair of gold earrings and a neck chain as a wedding gift. The mother, having returned from the wedding, seemed to be in deep sorrow. The husband wanted to find out about the reason, she refused to tell him for a long time, and at the end discovered that she felt sorry that she had no earrings and a chain similar to her sister's. My father said nothing. He had a wonderfully crafted hunting rifle with such pistols and a cutlass. The shotgun my father had been working on for four years produced four shots per shot. My father valued her for three hundred Neapolitan gold ounces, but he went out to town and sold all the weapons for eighty ounces, then bought earrings and a chain and brought them to his wife. The same day, the mother went to brag to Lunard's wife and was delighted to see her earrings as much more beautiful and richer.","Three years after my father had married, a younger sister of my mother married an oil merchant, called Lunardo, who gave her as a wedding present a pair of gold earrings with a chain of the same metal to wear round her neck. On the way home after the wedding, my mother seemed sunk in a deep gloom. Her husband wanted to know the reason why. For a long time she refused to tell him. Finally she confessed that she had a mortal longing for some earrings and a necklace like her sister’s. My father said nothing. He had a shotgun of the finest craftsmanship, with pistols to match, as well as a hunting-knife. The gun fired four shots without being reloaded. My father had worked on it for four years. He judged it to be worth three hundred ounces of Naples gold. He went to a collector, sold all the mountings for eighty ounces. Then he went to buy the jewellery his wife had hankered after, and brought it to her. My mother went that very day to show them to Lunardo’s wife, and her earrings were even thought to be a little more costly than her sister’s, which gave her the utmost pleasure.","Three years after my father’s wedding a younger sister of my mother married an oil merchant called Lunardo, who gave her as a wedding present gold earrings and a gold chain to wear round her neck.

"Z początku chciano, aby mi towarzyszył Garcias Hierro, gdyż ojciec mój zawsze był zdania, że najszlachetniejszy pojedynek jest ze szpadą w prawej; z puginałem zaś w lewej ręce. We Francji zupełnie nie znano tego rodzaju szermierki. Ponieważ jednak ojciec przyzwyczaił się każdego poranku fechtować z Garciasem pod murem zamkowym i ta rozrywka stała się potrzebna dla jego zdrowia, postanowił zatem zatrzymać fechtmistrza przy sobie.","At first, they wanted Garcia Hierro to accompany me, because my father always believed that the noblest duel was with the sword in the right hand; and with a dagger in his left hand. This kind of fencing was completely unknown in France. However, since his father had gotten used to fencing with Garcia at the castle wall every morning and this entertainment had become necessary for his health, he decided to keep the Blade with him.","At first there was talk of my being accompanied by Garcias Hierro, because my father believed the noblest style of fighting was with sword in the right hand and dagger in the left, a type of fencing completely unknown in France.

"Stopień mój z początku wydał się im żartem i każdy rozbójnik kładł się od śmiechu nazywając mnie signor tenete - wkrótce jednak musieli zmienić dotychczasowe mniemanie. Nie tylko zawsze pierwszy byłem w napadzie i ostatni w odwrocie, ale żaden z nich nie umiał lepiej ode mnie wyśledzić obrotów nieprzyjacielskich lub zapewnić bandzie bezpieczeństwo. Raz wdrapywałem się na szczyt .skał, aby szerzej objąć wzrokiem okolicę i dać umówione znaki, to znowu całe dnie przepędzałem śród nieprzyjaciół, skacząc z jednego drzewa na drugie. Często nawet zdarzało mi się przez całe noce nie złazić z najwyższych kasztanów Etny i gdy nie mogłem już oprzeć się znużeniu, zasypiałem przywiązawszy się wprzód pasem do gałęzi. Wszystko to nie było zbyt trudne dla tego, kto znał dokładnie rzemiosło kominiarza i chłopca okrętowego.","At first they found my rank a joke, and each robber laughed and called me signor tenete - but soon they had to change their opinion. Not only was I always the first to attack and the last to retreat, but neither of them was better able to track enemy turns or keep the gang safe than I did. Once I climbed to the top of the rock, in order to see the area more broadly and give the agreed signs, then again I spent the whole days among the enemies, jumping from one tree to another. Often I even stayed all night without getting off the tallest chestnuts of Mount Etna, and when I could no longer resist my weariness, I fell asleep, tied first with a belt to the branches. All this was not too difficult for those who knew exactly the craftsmanship of the chimney sweep and the ship's boy.","My rank, at first, was just a joke, and each bandit would burst out laughing whenever he called me “signor tenente”. But they had to change their tune. Not only was I always the first to attack and the last to cover the retreat, but none of them knew as much as me when it came to spying on enemy movements or ensuring the band’s rest. Sometimes I would climb to the top of rocks to get a better view of the countryside and make the agreed signals, and sometimes I would spend whole days in the enemy’s midst, only coming down from one tree to climb another. Indeed, it was often the case that I spent the night up the tallest chestnut trees on Etna. And when I could no longer fight off sleep, I would tie myself to the branches with a belt. All of this presented little difficulty for me, since I had been a cabin-boy and chimney-sweep.","My rank was no more than a joke at first, and all the bandits would burst out laughing when they called me ‘Signor tenente’, but they soon changed their tune. Not only did I always lead the attacks and was the last to cover the retreat, but no one could match me when it came to spying out the enemy’s movements and ensuring that the band was safe from attack. Sometimes I would climb on top of the rocks to overlook whole stretches of country and make the agreed signals. At other times, I would spend whole days in the very midst of our enemies. It often came about that I would stay all night up the tallest chestnut trees on Mount Etna and then, when I couldn’t keep awake any longer, I would tie myself to the branches with a strap. Such things were not difficult for me as I had been both a ship’s boy and a chimney sweep. So well did I do that"
"- Kochany Alfonsie, rażą nas te relikwie, które nosisz na szyi. Czy nie mógłbyś ich zdjąć na chwilę?","- Dear Alphonsus, we are shocked by these relics that you wear around your neck.

Emina appeared, with Zibedde following her sister.","Then Emina continued, ‘My dear Alphonse, the relic around your neck bothers us. Couldn’t you take it off for a little while?’"
"- Synu mój - odparł starzec - jest to opętany, z którego wypędzam duchy czartowskie.

Opowiadanie jego może się przydać ku twemu zbawieniu, rozkażę więc, aby zaczął.","""My son,"" replied the old man, ""he is a possessed man from whom I cast out devilish spirits."" Its terrible history is clearly evidence of the power which the angel of darkness has appropriated over this unhappy neighborhood. His story may be useful for your salvation, so I will order him to begin.","The hermit replied: “My son, this man is possessed of the devil, and I am exorcising him. His terrible story is good evidence of the fatal power that the Angel of Darkness is usurping in this unhappy land. His experience might be helpful to your salvation, and I am going to instruct him to give an account of it.”","‘My son,’ he replied. ‘ He is possessed of a devil whom I am exorcizing. His terrible story proves the dread tyranny that the angel of darkness exercises over this unfortunate land. His story may help you to win your salvation and I shall command him to tell it to you.’"
"To zupełnie wyglądało na nową pokusę. Duch ciemności, nie mogąc znęcić mię rozkoszą, starał się obudzić we mnie żądzę złota. Ale tymczasem piękne Mauretanki przytuliły się do mnie i uczułem wyraźnie dotknięcie ciał żywych, nie zaś cieni. Po chwili milczenia Emina tak dalej mówiła:","It all looked like a new temptation. The spirit of darkness, unable to entice me with delight, tried to awaken in me a lust for gold. But meanwhile, the beautiful Mauritanian women hugged me, and I felt clearly touching the living bodies, not the shadows. After a pause, Emina continued as follows:","This again was just like the spirit of darkness, who, having failed to lure me into temptation through sensual pleasure, was seeking to make me succumb through love of gold. But the two beauties drew closer, and it certainly seemed to me that I was touching bodies and not spirits. After a moment’s silence Emina resumed the thread of her story: “Dear Alphonse,” she said to me, “you know well enough the persecution we suffered under the reign of Philip, son of Charles.","This sounded just like the work of the spirit of darkness. Having failed to make me succumb to the temptation of lechery, now it was trying to make me succumb to the lure of gold. Yet as these two beautiful creatures pressed closer to me it seemed to me that I was touching not spirits but flesh and blood. After a moment of silence Emina took up her story again."
"Następnie zwracając się do jakiegoś nieznajomego, który stał obok niego, powiedział:","Then, turning to some stranger who was standing next to him, he said:","Then turning to a man beside him, he said: “Padron Lettereo, prendete lo chiutosto vui.”",’5
"- Tak jest, mój ojcze, żałuję za grzechy i całą nadzieję pokładam w miłosierdziu boskim.","- Yes, my father, I am sorry for my sins and I put all my hope in God's mercy.","For a long time the sound of the monk’s exhortations was audible, to which Thibaud replied in a firm voice: “Yes, father, I repent, and I trust in the mercy of God.”","For a long while the hermit’s exhortations could be heard, to which Thibaud replied in a strong voice, ‘Yes, Father, I repent and I trust in God’s mercy.’"
"- Zostań tu, kochany Paszeko; skoro czas nadejdzie, przyjdę po ciebie.","- Stay here, beloved Paszeko; when the time comes, I'll come for you.","When the time is right, I shall come to let you know.”",When it is time for you to come in I shall come and get you.’
"- Kochana Emino, czy nie sądzisz, że Alfons byłby przetrwał te wszystkie próby? Ach, któż śmie o tym wątpić! Drogi Alfonsie, jaka szkoda, że nie jesteś muzułmaninem; bez wątpienia stałbyś się panem nieprzeliczonych skarbów.","""Dear Emina, don't you think Alphonsus would have survived all these trials?"" Ah, who dares to doubt it! Dear Alfonso, what a pity you are not a Muslim; you would undoubtedly become the lord of countless treasures.","At this point Zibedde again interrupted her sister and said to her: “Dear Emina, do you not believe that Alphonse would have withstood all tests? Ah, who can doubt it? Dear Alphonse, if only you were Muslim! Immense treasures would perhaps be yours…”","Here Zubeida interrupted her sister again and said, ‘Dear Emina, don’t you think Alphonse would have been equal to all these ordeals? Who could doubt it? Oh Alphonse, why aren’t you a Muslim! Immense wealth might be in your hands!’"
"Zostawszy sam, zacząłem rozmyślać nad opowiadaniem Paszeka. Nie było wątpliwości, że znajdował się razem ze mną w jaskini, widziałem także, jak moje kuzynki poskoczyły do niego i wyciągnęły go z izby; ale Emina uprzedziła mnie, abym nie wierzył, gdyby mi co złego o niej i o jej siostrze mówiono. Zresztą szatany, które opętały Paszeka, mogły obłąkać mu zmysły i otumanić złudzeniami wszelkiego rodzaju.","Left alone, I began to meditate on Paszek's story. There was no doubt that he was in the cave with me, and I also saw my cousins jump to him and drag him out of the room; but Emina warned me that I would not believe if anything bad was told about her and her sister. Besides, the devils who possessed Pashek could have maddened his senses and bewildered him with illusions of all kinds.","I lay down on it. The hermit wished me good-night, and warned me that, for greater safety, he would lock the door after him.","When I found myself alone I reflected on Pacheco’s story. I was sure that I had seen him in the caves and sure that I had seen my two cousins leap on him and drag him out of the bedchamber. But Emina had warned me not to think ill of her or her sister. In any case, the demons who had seized Pacheco could also have confused his mind and assailed him with all kinds of visions."
"- Ojcze mój - rzekłem - właśnie spowiadałem się, wyjeżdżając z Kadyksu, a od tego czasu, nie sądzę, abym popełnił jaki grzech śmiertelny, chyba we śnie.

I did spend the night at Venta Quemada, but if I saw what I saw there, I have my reasons for not wanting to mention it.","So I said to him: “Father, I made my confession before leaving Cadiz. Since then, I do not believe I have committed any mortal sin, except perhaps in thought. It is true that I spent the night at Venta Quemada. But if I saw anything there, I have good reason not to speak of it.”","‘Father,’ I said to him, ‘I went to confession before I left Cadiz. Since then I do not believe that I have committed any mortal sin except perhaps in my dreams.

"Nie byłem wcale wprawny w rozplątywaniu intryg podobnego rodzaju. Zamordowałem Sylwię i Antonina. Ten ostatni na chwilę przed śmiercią wyznał mi zdradę Mora. Z zakrwawionym sztyletem pobiegłem do zdrajcy; Moro przeląkł się, padł na kolana i wyjąkał, że książę Rocca Fiorita zapłacił mu, aby mnie i Sylwię zgładził ze świata, i że jedynie w celu uskutecznienia tego zamiaru przyłączył się do naszej bandy. Utopiłem mu sztylet w piersiach. Następnie wybrałem się do Mesyny, wemknąłem się przebrany do pałacu księcia i wysłałem go za jego powiernikiem i dwiema ofiarami jego zemsty.","I was not at all skilled at untangling this kind of intrigue. I murdered Sylwia and Antonin. The latter, a moment before his death, confessed Mora to me. With the bloody dagger I ran to the traitor; Moro was frightened, fell to his knees, and stammered that Prince Rocca Fiorita had paid him to kill me and Sylwia from the world, and that he had joined our gang only to accomplish this intention. I drowned the dagger in his chest. Then I traveled to Messina, stormed into the Prince's palace disguised, and sent him after his confidant and two victims of his revenge.","I was not experienced in unravelling plots of this kind. I stabbed Sylvia and Antonino through the heart. Antonino, who did not die at once, revealed to me Moro’s treachery. I went after the villain, my bloody dagger in my hand. Terrified at the sight of it, he fell to his knees and confessed that the Prince de Rocca Fiorita had paid him to kill me, as well as Sylvia, and that in fact he had only joined our band to this end. I stabbed him. Then I went to Messina, and having gained access to the Prince by virtue of a disguise, I dispatched him to the next world to join his henchman and my two other victims.","I had had no experience in dealing with intrigues of this sort, so I stabbed Sylvia and Antonino to death. The latter, who did not the at once, revealed Moro’s treachery to me. I sought out the wretch, my bloody dagger still in my hand. The sight of this terrified him. He fell to his knees and confessed that the Prince of Rocca Fiorita had paid him to do away with Sylvia and me and that he had joined my band with the intention of accomplishing that end. I stabbed him to death. Then I went to Messina and, having gained access to the principino’s house by means of a disguise, I dispatched him to the other world to join his henchman and my two other victims."
"Zaledwie skończyłem tę historię, gdy wszedł kabalista i zdawał się chcieć wyczytać z moich oczu wrażenie, jakiego doświadczyłem. Wprawdzie przygody Tybalda mocno mnie zadziwiły, ale nie chciałem tego pokazać i odszedłem do siebie. Tu znowu zacząłem zagłębiać się nad własnymi wypadkami i prawie dawać wiarę, że szatany dla złudzenia mnie ożywiły trupy dwóch wisielców i że kto wie, czy nie jestem drugim Tybaldem.","I had just finished the story when the Kabbalist entered and seemed to want to read the impression I had experienced in my eyes. Although Tybald's adventures amazed me a lot, I didn't want to show it and I went away to myself.

The truth is that it had greatly impressed me, but I did not want to let him see this, and I retired to my room. There I reflected upon everything that had happened to me, and I almost came to believe that in order to deceive me demons had instilled life into the bodies of hanged men, and that I was another La Jacquière.","No sooner had I finished this story than the cabbalist came in and seemed to want to read in my eyes the impression the story had made on me.

Once there I thought about everything that had happened to me, and I almost came to believe that demons had assumed the corpses of two hanged men to trick me and that I was a second la Jacquière."
"- Nie przyjąłbym - odpowiedziałem - gdyż mniemam, że wyparcie się wiary lub opuszczenie sztandaru - zawsze może tylko okryć hańbą.","""I would not,"" I replied, ""for I suppose that denial of faith or abandonment of the banner can only ever be disgraced.""","“Certainly not,” I replied. “I think that to renounce one’s religion or to desert one’s flag are two equally dishonourable things.”",‘Certainly not!’ I replied. ‘It seems to me that to renounce one’s religion is as dishonourable as to desert one’s colours.’
"Tu usłyszeliśmy pianie koguta i Emina przestała mówić. Kogut jeszcze raz zapiał. Człowiek przesądny byłby się spodziewał, że dwie piękności nagle dymnikiem ulecą. To jednak wcale nie nastąpiło, wszelako dziewczęta zasępiły się nagle i pogrążyły w dumaniach.","Here we heard a rooster crowing and Emina stopped talking. The rooster crowed once more. A superstitious person would have expected two beauties to suddenly fly away. This, however, did not happen at all, but the girls suddenly turned gloomy and plunged into reflections.","At this point we heard the cock crow, and Emina stopped talking… The cock crowed once more… A superstitious man might have expected the two fair ladies to fly up the chimney.

When the Guadalquivir flows out of the mountains, it rushes in a rapid, bottomless stream with no banks, and crashes the waves against the rocks that keep in its way every now and then.","I had two choices: to return to Andujar, or to continue my journey. But the first option did not even occur to me. I leapt onto my horse, and at once setting it at a brisk trot, in two hours I reached the banks of the Guadalquivir, which is not that quiet splendid river whose majestic course embraces the walls of Seville. The Guadalquivir as it leaves the mountains is a bottomless boundless torrent, ever roaring against the rocks that contain its strenuous waters.","Two courses of action were open to me: to return to Andújar or to continue on my journey. I did not even consider the former. I jumped on my horse and, spurring it to a gallop, reached in two hours the banks of the Guadalquivir, which is not at this point in its course the calm river which flows majestically round the walls of the city of Seville, but rather, as it emerges from the mountains, a deep, powerful, roaring torrent, difficult of access, constantly thundering against the rocks which confine it."

"Gdy Zoto kończył opowiadanie tej przygody swego ojca, jeden z jego braci przyszedł mu powiedzieć, że oczekiwano na jego rozkazy względem przygotowania okrętu. Opuścił nas więc prosząc o pozwolenie odłożenia na jutro dalszego ciągu historii. Wszelako to, com dotąd usłyszał, mocno mnie zastanawiało. Dziwiło mnie, że ciągle wychwalał honor, subtelność i nieposzlakowaną uczciwość ludzi, którzy powinni byli za łaskę uważać, gdyby ich tylko powieszono. Nadużycie tych słów, którymi szastał z taką pewnością siebie, pomieszało wszystkie moje myśli.","As Zoto finished recounting his father's adventure, one of his brothers came to tell him that his orders were awaiting for the preparation of the ship. So he left us asking for permission to postpone the rest of the story until tomorrow. However, what I had heard so far puzzled me. I was surprised that he constantly praised the honor, subtlety and unblemished honesty of people who should have been considered a grace if only they had been hanged. The abuse of these words with which he swam with such confidence confused all my thoughts.",All the cut-throats that belonged to it vied with one another in their praise for so scrupulously keeping his word.,"Just as Zoto reached this point in his father’s story, one of his brothers came to tell him that instructions were needed for the embarkation. So he left us, asking permission to continue his story the next day. But his words had given me much to think about. He had repeatedly praised the honour, delicacy and integrity of people for whom hanging was not a severe enough punishment. His misuse of these words, which he uttered with such conviction, completely bewildered me."
"Ponieważ mam zaszczyt opowiadać wam moje przygody, łatwo więc pojmiecie, że nie umarłem od wypitej - jak myślałem - trucizny. Odszedłem tylko od przytomności i nie wiem, jak długo zostawałem w tym stanie. Pamiętam jednak, że znowu obudziłem się pod szubienicą Los Hermanos, ale tym razem z pewnego rodzaju zadowoleniem, gdyż przynajmniej byłem pewny, żem jeszcze nie umarł. Nadto nie znalazłem się już między dwoma wisielcami; leżałem po lewej ich stronie, po prawej zaś spostrzegłem jakiegoś człowieka, którego także wziąłem za wisielca, gdyż zdawał się bez życia i miał stryczek na szyi. Wkrótce jednak poznałem, że śpi tylko, i rozbudziłem go. Nieznajomy, spojrzawszy na miejsce swego noclegu, zaczął śmiać się i rzekł:","Since I have the honor of telling you about my adventures, it is easy to understand that I did not die from drinking - as I thought - poison. I just fell out of consciousness, and I don't know how long I stayed in this state. I do remember, however, that I woke up again at the Los Hermanos gallows, but this time with a kind of satisfaction, for at least I was sure that I was not yet dead. Moreover, I was no longer between the two hanged men; I was lying on their left side, and on their right I saw a man whom I took for a hanged man, because he seemed lifeless and had a noose around his neck. But soon I realized that he was only sleeping, and woke him up. The stranger, looking at his place of lodging, began to laugh and said:","We shall meet again some day.” The rising sun revealed in the distance the gallows built for Zoto’s brothers. I walked for an hour across the scrub before reaching it. I found the gate open and a person lying between the two hanged men. I wakened him. On seeing where he was, the stranger began to laugh, and said: “It has to be admitted that the person who studies the cabbala is liable to tiresome misapprehensions.","Since I have the honour of telling you this story, you will know that I did not die of the poison I thought I had drunk but only fainted, and I do not know how long I was unconscious. All I know is that I awoke under the gallows of Los Hermanos and this time came to my senses with a feeling of pleasure, for at least I had the satisfaction of knowing that I was not dead. Nor did I find myself lying between two hanged men. This time I was on their left, and to their right I saw another man who I thought had also been hanged as he looked dead and had a rope around his neck. But I soon realized that he was only sleeping and I woke him up. When the stranger saw where he was, he started to laugh and said, ‘It must be admitted that in studying the cabbala one is subject to annoying delusions."
"Natenczas drugi wisielec, który schwycił mnie za lewą nogę, wziął się także do szponów. Naprzód zaczął mnie łechtać pod podeszwę nogi, za którą mnie trzymał, następnie piekielny potwór zdarł z niej skórę, powyciągał wszystkie nerwy, oczyścił ze krwi i jął przebierać po nich palcami jak gdyby po narzędziu muzycznym. Widząc jednak, że wcale nie wydaję przyjemnych dlań dźwięków, zapuścił szpony pod moje kolano, pozahaczał ścięgna na pazury i zaczął je skręcać, zupełnie jak gdyby nastrajał harfę. Na koniec jął grać na mojej nodze, z której utworzył rodzaj psalterionu. Słyszałem jego diabelski śmiech, a piekielne wycia towarzyszyły moim przeraźliwym krzykom. W u-szach zatętniły mi zgrzytania potępieńców: zdawało mi się, że miażdżą w zębach wszystkie fibry mojego ciała; wreszcie straciłem przytomność.","Then the other hangman, who grabbed my left leg, also grasped the claws. Forward, he began to tickle me under the sole of the leg, by which he was holding me, then the hellish monster tore the skin off it, pulled out all the nerves, cleansed the blood and began to fiddle through them with his fingers as if on a musical instrument. But seeing that I wasn't making any pleasant sounds for him, he let his claws drop under my knee, hooked the tendons on his claws, and twisted them as if he were tuning a harp. At the end he started to play my leg, from which he made a kind of psalterion. I heard his devilish laugh and hellish howls accompanied my terrifying screams. My ears echoed with the grinding of the damned: I thought they were grinding all the fibers of my flesh in my teeth; finally passed out.","Then the other hanged man, who had seized my left leg, also wanted to leave his mark on me. First he began by tickling the sole of the foot he was holding. Then the monster tore the skin off it, separated all the nerves, bared them, and set to playing on them as though on a musical instrument; but since I did not render a sound that pleased him, he began to twist them, as one tunes a harp. Finally he began to play on my leg, of which he had fashioned a psaltery. I heard his diabolical laughter; while pain wrung dreadful howls out of me, the wailings of hell joined voice. But when it came to my hearing the damned gnashing their teeth, I felt as though they were grinding my every fibre. In the end I lost consciousness.","Then the other one, who had grasped my left leg, decided to use his claws. First he tickled the sole of the foot he was holding, then that monster tore off my skin, separated out all the sinews, laid them bare and tried to play a tune on them as though on a musical instrument. But as my sinews did not give out a sound which pleased him, he stuck his claw into my calf, pinched the tendons and began to twist them round as one does in order to tune a harp. Eventually he began to play on my leg, which he had turned into a sort of psaltery. I could hear his diabolical laughter. As the pain made me groan horribly the screams of hell chanted in chorus. And as I listened to the wails of the damned it seemed to me that every fibre in my body was being crushed in their teeth. Eventually I lost consciousness."
"- Hierro! niech cię Bóg broni od usprawiedliwień, gdyż te przypuszczają możność obrazy.","- Hierro! God save you from excuses, for these suspect offenses.","Then adopting an even more fearsome look, my father said: “Hierro, may heaven keep you from presenting apologies, for they would presuppose some offence.”","Then my father looked even more terrible and said, ‘Hierro, heaven preserve you from excusing yourself, for to excuse yourself is to imply that you have given offence.’"
"Odpowiedziałem mu na to, że taki wybór może przypadać do smaku podróżnym zwyczajnego rodzaju, ale gdy król don Filip V raczył zaszczycić mnie godnością kapitana w gwardii wallońskiej. święte prawa honoru nakazują mi udać się najkrótszą drogą do Madrytu, chociażby była ona zarazem najniebezpieczniejsza.","I replied that such a choice might be to the taste of travelers of an ordinary kind, but when King Don Philip V deigned to honor me with the title of captain in the Walloon Guard. the holy laws of honor require me to take the shortest route to Madrid, however dangerous it may be.","In reply I told him that this option might suit ordinary travellers, but that since the King, Don Felipe Quinto, had been so gracious as to honour me with a captain’s commission in the Walloon Guards, the sacred laws of honour forbade me from reaching Madrid by the shortest route without asking if it was the most dangerous.","I replied to him that this choice of route might suit ordinary travellers, but that as King Philip V4 had graciously bestowed on me a commission in the Walloon Guards, I was bound by the sacred laws of honour to take the shortest route to Madrid without considering whether it was the most dangerous."

Wystarcza to zapewne w niektórych językach teraźniejszych, ale w hebrajskim każda litera jest liczbą każdy wyraz przemądrą kombinacją, każde zdanie straszliwą formułą, która, gdy ją kto potrafi wymówić z potrzebnym przydechem i akcentami, z łatwością może poruszać góry i osuszać rzeki.","Perhaps you all imagine that you would have acquired a true idea of these divine books from the Latin translation, issued with the Chaldean original of 1684 in a small German town called Frankfurt, but we laugh at the presumptuousness of those who think that enough ordinary human eyesight to be able to read these books.

They might indeed suffice for the purposes of certain modern languages, but in Hebrew each letter is a number, each word a scholarly combination, each sentence a dreadful formula that, if properly pronounced with all the right breathings and stresses, could level mountains and make rivers run dry.","You non-initiates may think that you have got some idea of all this Holy Writ from the Latin translation which was printed together with the original Chaldean in 1684 in a small German town called Frankfurt.3 But we cabbalists laugh at the presumption of those who believe that all that is needed in order to read are the physical organs of sight. That may suffice for some modern languages, but in Hebrew every letter is a number, every word a learned combination of signs, every phrase a terrible formula, which, when correctly pronounced with all the appropriate aspirates and stresses, could cause mountains to crumble and rivers to dry up."

Tu pustelnik znowu zdawał się uśmiechać i rzekł:,Here the hermit seemed to be smiling again and said:,"At this, the hermit again seemed to smile, then he said: “I am sorry to see that your virtues rest on a far too extravagant code of honour, and I warn you that you will no longer find Madrid as swashbuckling as it was in your father’s day.","At this the hermit smiled again and said, ‘I am sorry to see that your virtues are based on an exaggerated sense of honour."
"Zacząłem od pokrzepienia sił. a następnie jąłem przywodzić na pamięć wypadki ubiegłej nocy. Wspomnienia moje powikłały się zupełnie, dobrze jednak pamiętałem, żem dał słowo honoru na dotrzymanie tajemnicy, i postanowiłem święcie dochować przysięgi. Usunąwszy raz pod tym względem wszelką wątpliwość, zacząłem zastanawiać się nad dalszym moim losem, czyli nad drogą, którą miałem obrać. Teraz bardziej niż kiedykolwiek sądziłem, że święte prawa honoru nakazują mi udać się przez Sierra Morenę.","I started with strengthening my strength. and then began to remember the events of the night before. My memories were completely complicated, but I well remembered that I had given my word of honor to keep the secret, and resolved to keep my oath sacred. Once I removed all doubts in this respect, I began to reflect on my further fate, that is, on the path I was to take. Now, more than ever, I thought that a sacred law of honor required me to go through Sierra Morena.","I set about restoring my strength, after which I began to reflect on what had happened to me during the night. My memories were very confused, but what I well recalled was having given my word of honour to keep it secret, and I was strongly resolved to abide by my promise.

Then I thought about what had happened to me the previous night. My recollections were confused but I remembered with great clarity that I had given my word of honour to keep what had happened a secret, and I was firmly determined to do so. Once I had resolved this it only remained to decide what I should do at that instant; that is to say, which way I ought to go. And it seemed to me that I was more than ever honour bound to go by way of the Sierra Morena."
"Z początku dym i woń sadzy dokuczały mi mocno, ale na szczęście byłem w wieku, w którym można przyzwyczaić się do wszystkiego. Już od sześciu miesięcy wykonywałem nowe rzemiosło, gdy mi się wydarzyła następująca przygoda.","At first, the smoke and the smell of soot bothered me a lot, but luckily I was at an age where you can get used to everything. I had been doing a new craft for six months when the following adventure happened to me.","I found the dust from the chimneys and the smell of the soot very unpleasant at first, but I got used to them, for I was of an age when one adapts to everything.

"Dałem odmowną odpowiedź, ale Zibelda objęła mnie za szyję i nożyczkami, które trzymała w ręku, przecięła wstążkę. Emina natychmiast porwała relikwie i rzuciła w rozpadlinę skały.","I said no, but Zibelda put her arms around my neck and cut the ribbon with the scissors in her hand.

"Nie potrzebuję wam mówić, że ojciec mój, Mamun, był pierwszym astrologiem swego czasu.

"Moja macocha nie dała mi czasu na odpowiedź; wzięła mnie za rękę, poprowadziła przez wiele korytarzy aż do drzwi ostatnich i jęła spoglądać przez dziurkę od klucza.

"Właśnie zajęty byłem tymi myślami, gdym spostrzegł, że Rebeka zakreśla w powietrzu koła i inne tym podobne czarodziejskie wydziwiania. Po chwili złączyła się ze mną i rzekła:",I was just preoccupied with these thoughts when I noticed that Rebecca was drawing circles in the air and other such magical fairy tales. After a while she joined me and said:,"My cousins, and Rebecca herself, had often given me to understand that I was being tested. Perhaps at the Venta I had been given a drink to make me sleep, and then nothing could have easier than to transport me in my sleep and leave me lying beneath the fateful gibbet.","Or else if they are acting on the orders of the Gomelez…’ I was still going over these conjectures in my mind when I caught sight of Rebecca drawing circles in the air and performing other magical hocus-pocus.

"Słońce zaczęło wstawać, gdy dostałam się na wierzchołek, który wybrałam do uskutecznienia moich działań; mogłam jednak rozpocząć je dopiero nazajutrz o północy. Schroniłam się do jaskini, gdzie zastałam niedźwiedzicę z kilkoma niedźwiadkami; rzuciła się na mnie, ale oprawa księgi i tym razem nie była bezskuteczna; rozwścieczone zwierzę upadło u mych stóp. Wzdęte jej wymiona przypomniały mi, że umieram z czczości, nie miałam zaś jeszcze żadnego geniusza, a nawet żadnego ducha błędnego na moje rozkazy. Postanowiłam korzystać ze sposobności i położywszy się na ziemi, ugasiłam pragnienie mlekiem niedźwiedzicy. Ostatki ciepła, które zwierzę jeszcze w sobie zachowało, uczyniły jej pokarm mniej odrażającym, ale wtem niedźwiadki przyszły dopominać się o swoją część. Wyobraź sobie, Alfonsie, szesnastoletnią dziewczynę, która nigdy dotąd nie opuściła swego domu rodzinnego, nagle w tak okropnym położeniu. Wprawdzie miałam w ręku straszliwą broń, ale nie byłam przyzwyczajona jej używać, najmniejsza zaś nieuwaga mogła ją przeciw mnie obrócić.","The sun started to rise as I got to the top that I had chosen to effect my actions; but I could not start them until midnight the next day. I took refuge in the cave, where I found a bear with a few bears; she pounced on me, but the binding of the book was not ineffective this time; furious animal fell at my feet. Her bloated udders reminded me that I was dying of idleness, and I had no genius yet, and even no vicious spirit, at my command. I decided to take the opportunity and, lying down on the ground, quenched my thirst with the mother's milk. The remnants of warmth, which the animal still retained within itself, made her food less disgusting, but then the bears came to ask for their share. Imagine, Alfons, a sixteen-year-old girl who has never left her family home, suddenly in such a terrible situation. Admittedly, I had a terrible weapon in my hand, but I was not used to using it, and the slightest inattention would turn it against me.","The sun was beginning to appear when I reached the summit I had chosen for my operations. I could not begin until midnight the following day. I took shelter in a cave. There I found a bear with its young. She came rushing at me, but the binding of my book did its work: she fell down at my feet. Her swollen dugs reminded me that I was dying of hunger, and I still had no genie, not even the humblest sprite, to carry out my orders. I decided to throw myself on the ground beside the bear and suck her milk. A lingering heat in the animal made this meal less disgusting, but the little bear-cubs wanted it for themselves. Imagine, Alphonse, a girl of sixteen, who had never left the confines of the place where she was born, finding herself in this dreadful situation. I had some fearsome weapons at my disposal, but I had never used them, and the least mistake could turn them against me.","The sun was just rising when I reached the mountain top which I had chosen for my operations.

"Przypomniałem sobie o moim postanowieniu i zamierzyłem na włos od niego nie odstąpić.

Natenczas na tronie z kości słoniowej ukazał się mój ojciec. Wzrok jego zagniewany przejął mnie zgrozą; myślałam, że nie przeżyję pierwszego wyrazu, jaki wyjdzie z jego ust. Jednakże usłyszałam jego głos. Boże Abrahama! Wyrzekł straszliwe przekleństwo; nie powtórzę ci jego stów...","I fell at his feet, called for pity, but to no avail.

He uttered a terrible curse; I will not tell you his words ...","I flung myself at his knees. He was unmoved. I heard him utter the dread formula invented long ago by the Witch of Endor. At once my father appeared, seated on an ivory throne. In his eye was the threat of death, and I feared I would not survive the first word that came from his mouth. Yet he spoke, God of Abraham, how he spoke! He dared to utter such dreadful curses. I shall not repeat what he said…","I fell to my knees, I begged him to show pity, but he was inexorable.

My means, although not so sacred, are nevertheless not devilish. Deign also to welcome me with Paszek, whom - be sure of it - I will cure him completely.","The cabbalist seemed to divine my thoughts, and addressing the hermit, said to him: “Father, I know you better than you think.

"Służyliśmy więc do mszy, obcinaliśmy knoty u świec, zapalaliśmy lampy, resztę zaś dnia łotrowaliśmy na ulicy tak dobrze, jak w Benewencie. Zjadłszy zupę u mnichów, dostawaliśmy od ojca po jednym taro na kasztany i obarzanki, z którymi szliśmy bawić się w porcie i powracaliśmy dopiero późno w nocy. Ostatecznie, na świecie nie było szczęśliwszych od nas uliczników, gdy wtem wypadek, o którym dziś jeszcze nie mogę mówić bez wściekłości, postanowił o całym losie mego życia.","So we served mass, cut candle wicks, lit lamps, and raided the rest of the day in the street as well as in Benevento. Having eaten the monks' soup, my father gave us one taro for chestnuts and bagels, with which we went to play in the port and returned only late at night. After all, there were no happier street urchins in the world than we were, when an accident, which I cannot speak of today without rage, decided my whole fate.","We served at Mass, we snuffed out the candles, we lit the lamps, and that aside, we were as arrant little rascals as we had been at Benevento.

In short, we were happy little scamps… until an incident occurred that even today I cannot recall without a surge of anger, which was to determine the course of my whole life.","We served at Mass, we snuffed candles and lit lamps, but apart from that we were the same shameless street urchins that we had been in Benevento.

"Pojmujecie, że nadzieja nieśmiertelności i posiadania dwóch niebiańskich małżonek podwoiła we mnie zapal do nauk kabalistycznych. Wszelako przez długie lata nie śmiałem wzbić się do nieograniczonej wysokości i poprzestałem na zawładnięciu przez moje zaklęcia kilku geniuszami osiemnastego stopnia. Jednakowoż z każdym rokiem nabierałem więcej śmiałości. Przeszłego lata zacząłem pracować nad pierwszymi wersetami Szir hasz-szirimu. Zaledwie pierwszy werset rozłożyłem, gdy wtem przeraźliwy łoskot, jak gdyby cały mój zamek walił się z posad, obił się o moje uszy. Nie przeląkłem się zgoła; owszem, byłem przekonany, że praca wybornie mi się udaje. Przeszedłem do drugiego wersetu i gdy go ukończyłem, lampa z mego stołu zsunęła się na podłogę, podskoczyła kilka razy i znieruchomiała przed wielkim zwierciadłem, zawieszonym w głębi pokoju. Spojrzałem w zwierciadło i spostrzegłem końce dwóch prześlicznych kobiecych nóżek. Wnet za nimi pokazały się następne. Pochlebiałem sobie, że te zachwycające nóżki należą do niebiańskich córek Salomona, ale nie śmiałem prowadzić dalej moich działań.","You understand that the hope of immortality and having two heavenly spouses has doubled my enthusiasm for the Kabbalistic teachings. For many years, however, I did not dare to soar to unlimited heights, and contented myself with capturing a few eighteenth-degree geniuses by my spells. However, with each passing year, I became more daring. Last summer, I started working on the first verses of Shir hash-sirim. I had scarcely unfolded the first verse when a terrible thud, as if my entire castle had collapsed, struck my ears. I was not at all afraid; yes, I was convinced that I was doing an excellent job. I moved on to the second verse, and when I had finished it, the lamp from my table slid to the floor, jumped several times, and stopped in front of a large mirror that hung in the back of the room. I looked into the mirror and saw the ends of two lovely female legs. Soon the next ones appeared behind them. I flattered myself that these delightful feet belonged to Solomon's heavenly daughters, but I did not dare to continue my work.","You can well imagine that the hope of enjoying immortality and of possessing two heavenly brides renewed my enthusiasm for the cabbalistic sciences, but it was years before I would dare to raise myself to such heights, and I contented myself with subjecting to my conjurations some few spirits of the eighteenth order. However, gradually growing bolder, last year I attempted an exercise on the first verses of Shir ha-Shirim. Hardly had I completed a single line when a dreadful noise was heard, and my castle seemed to crumble to its foundations. This did not frighten me at all. On the contrary, I concluded that my calculation was correct. I moved on to the second line. When that was complete, a lamp I had on my table jumped down on to the floor, and with a few leaps and bounds came to rest in front of a large mirror tucked away in my bedroom. I looked in the mirror and saw the tips of two very pretty lady’s feet, then two other little feet. I had the audacity to imagine that these charming feet belonged to the celestial daughters of Solomon, but I did not think I ought to pursue my exercises any further.","As you may well imagine, the hope of enjoying immortality and possessing two celestial brides increased my enthusiasm for the cabbalistic sciences. But it was years before I could contemplate such lofty heights. At first I was content to summon up spirits of the eighteenth order. But by slow degrees I grew bolder, and last year attempted an exercise on the first verses of the Song of Songs. I had scarcely completed one line when there was a terrible noise and my castle seemed to shake apart on its foundations. This did not alarm me. On the contrary, I concluded that I had performed the correct operation. I passed on to the second line. When it was finished, a lamp I had on my table jumped up and dropped to the floor, bounced across it and placed itself in front of a tall mirror at the back of the room. I gazed into it and saw the tips of a girl’s dainty feet and then two more little feet. I flattered myself that these charming feet belonged to the celestial daughters of Solomon but thought that I had proceeded far enough with my exercises."
"Z nadejściem wiosny jakiś nieznajomy służący podszedł do mego ojca na ulicy prosząc, aby raczył udać się z nim do bramy miasta. Tam spotkali szlachcica w podeszłym wieku i czterech konnych.

Ale jakież było moje zadziwienie, gdy z otwierającego się namiotu nagle ujrzałem wychodzące obie moje kuzynki w tym powabnym stroju, jaki w Hiszpanii nazywają a la gitana maja.

Meanwhile Antonino, on Moro’s advice, had increased his attentions to Sylvia and went around with a satisfied air, which suggested to me that she was making him happy."

If they offered you a huge fortune to change your religion, would you accept?”","Then he said to me, ‘I can see, my son, that you still have faith, but I fear that you may lose it.

"Nareszcie ujrzałem nadchodzący pułk, który roztasował się przed bramą zamkową i dokoła porozstawiał straże. Tuż za nimi ciągnął szereg lektyk, w których siedziały damy. w ostatniej zaś sam Principino rozłożył się na stosie poduszek. Z trudnością wysiadł, podtrzymywany przez dwóch koniuszych, wysłał przodem oddział wojska i dopiero gdy zaręczono mu, że żadnego z nas nie ma już w zamku, wszedł z kobietami i kilku szlachcicami należącymi do jego orszaku.","At last I saw the approaching regiment, which lay in front of the castle gate and posted guards around.

"Kilka godzin jeszcze przepędziłem, to czytając, to przewracając się w łóżku, gdy nagle usłyszałem dźwięk dzwonu, czyli raczej zegara bijącego północ. Zdziwiłem się, tym bardziej żem poprzednich godzin nie słyszał. Niebawem drzwi się otworzyły i ujrzałem moją macochę w lekkim dezabilu, ze świecą w ręku. Zbliżyła się do mnie na palcach, gestem nakazując milczenie, postawiła świecę na stoliku, usiadła na moim łóżku, wzięła moją rękę między swoje dłonie i w te słowa zaczęła:","I spent a few more hours reading this, then turning over in bed, when suddenly I heard the sound of a bell, or rather a clock, chiming midnight.

"- Aby wam dowieść, jak mało lękam się pogróżek tego człowieka, zaraz wam powiem, że jest to Żyd Wieczny Tułacz, o którym zapewne musieliście słyszeć. Od siedemnastu wieków ani razu nie usiadł, ani nie położył się, nie odpoczął, nie zasnął. Idąc bez przerwy, zje wasze kasztany i nazajutrz rano będzie już stąd o jakie sześćdziesiąt mil. Zwykle przebiega we wszystkich kierunkach niezmierzone pustynie Afryki. Żywi się dzikimi owocami, a drapieżne zwierzęta mijają go bez szkody z powodu świętego piętna Thau, wyrytego na jego czole. Dlatego to, jak zauważyliście, nosi na głowie przepaskę. Nie bywa on nigdy w naszych okolicach, chyba na wezwanie jakiego kabalisty. Wreszcie mogę wam zaręczyć, że go tu wcale nie wzywałem. bo go nie cierpię. Jednakowoż muszę wyznać, że często wie on o wielu rzeczach; radzę ci zatem, senor Alfonsie, nie zaniedbywać jego przestrogi.","- In order to prove to you how little I fear the threats of this man, let me tell you in a moment that he is the Eternal Wanderer Jew whom you must have heard about. In seventeen centuries he has not sat down or lay down, rested or fell asleep. He will go on and on, he will eat your chestnuts, and the next morning he will be about sixty miles away. The vast deserts of Africa usually run in all directions. It feeds on wild fruit, and predatory animals pass him unharmed because of the sacred mark of Thau engraved on his forehead. That's why, as you have noticed, she is wearing a headband. He is never in our neighborhood, except at the call of some cabalist. Finally, I can assure you that I did not call him here at all. because I hate him. However, I must confess that he often knows many things; therefore I advise you, Senor Alfonso, not to neglect his warning.","At the end of our meal the hermit said to me: “Ask this gentleman if he would kindly tell us his story. It sounds as though it should be interesting. The cabbalist protested, saying that there were many things in his story we would not be able to understand.","In order to show you what little importance I attach to that man’s threats, I shall first tell you who he is. He is the Wandering Jew of whom you may have heard. For about seventeen hundred years he has neither sat down, nor lain down, nor rested, nor slept. As he walks along he will eat your chestnuts and he will have covered sixty leagues between now and tomorrow morning. Normally he wanders all across the vast deserts of Africa. He lives off wild fruit. Wild animals cannot harm him because on his forehead is branded the sacred sign of Tau, which he hides under a headband as you have seen. He rarely appears in these lands unless forced to do so by the conjuration of some cabbalist. For the rest I assure you that I did not summon him here, for I detest him, but I admit that he is well informed about many things and I advise you not to ignore the information he has given you, Señor Alphonse.’"
"Jeżeli piękna Emina i luba Zibelda zawróciły mi głowę ubrane po mauretańsku, nie mniej zachwyciły mnie w tym nowym stroju.

"Domyślam się, że ojciec musiał nam często przysyłać pieniądze, gdyż obfitość panowała w naszym domu.

Aunt Lunardo also had a nativity scene, but far less great than ours.","I suppose that at that time my father was sending us large sums of money, for abundance reigned in our house. My mother took part in the carnival revels, and during Lent she made a crib, or presepe, using little dolls, sugar castles and other such childish devices, which are very popular throughout the kingdom of Naples and constitute a luxury item for well-off citizens. My Aunt Lunardo also had a presepe, but it was far inferior to ours.","I suppose that my father used to send us large sums of money, for we had more than we needed for our household.

Usłyszałem dwanaście uderzeń, a jak wiadomo, złe duchy mają władzę tylko od północy do pierwszego piania koguta. W istocie, mogłem być zdziwiony, gdyż zegar nie bił poprzednich godzin i dźwięk jego tętnił mi w uszach grobowo.

"Po ośmiu dniach gregalada - nazwę tę na Morzu Śródziemnym dają gwałtownemu wiatrowi północno-wschodniemu - rozpędziła naszą małą flotę. Każdy ratował się, jak mógł. My zostaliśmy zagnani na wybrzeża Sardynii, w bezludną okolicę, znaną pod nazwą Przystani Świętego Piotra. Zastaliśmy tam polakier wenecki, który zdawał się mocno skołatany burzą. Lettereo natychmiast zaczął coś przemyśliwać o tym okręcie i tuż obok niego zarzucił kotwicę. Następnie część swoich marynarzy umieścił na dnie statku, aby załoga wydała się mniej liczna. Ta ostrożność była zresztą prawie całkiem nieużyteczna, gdyż trójmasztowce z ożaglowaniem łacińskim mają zawsze większą załogę niż inne statki.","After eight days, the gregalada - this name in the Mediterranean is given to a violent northeast wind - dispersed our small fleet. Everyone saved themselves as they could. We were driven to the coast of Sardinia, in a deserted area known as St. Peter's Harbor. There we found a Venetian Pole who seemed to be deeply troubled by the storm. Lettereo immediately began to think something about the ship and dropped the anchor right next to it. Then he placed some of his sailors on the bottom of the ship to make the crew appear less numerous. This caution was, moreover, almost useless, since three-masted ships with Latin sails always had a larger crew than other ships.","After a week our little flotilla was dispersed by a gregale; this is the name given in the Mediterranean to a north-easterly wind. Every vessel made for safety as best it could. As for us, we came to an anchorage known by the name of St Peter’s harbour. This is a deserted beach on the coast of Sardinia. We found there a Venetian polacca, which seemed to have suffered considerable damage from the storm. Our captain immediately formed designs on this vessel, and dropped anchor very close to it. Then he sent some of his crew down into the hold, so as to appear less heavily manned, which was almost an unnecessary precaution since lateen-rigged vessels are always more heavily manned than others.","After a week the little fleet was scattered by a gregale – that is what the stiff north-easterly wind is known as in the Mediterranean. Each boat made for safety as best it could. We reached an anchorage known as the Roads of St Peter, which is a deserted beach on the Sardinian coast. There we came across a Venetian polacca which seemed to have suffered a great deal of damage during the storm. Our padron at once had designs on the boat and dropped anchor close to it. He sent part of the crew down to the hold so as to make it appear that few men were on board. This was a more or less pointless precaution since lateen-rigged boats always had more men than others."
"Po wieczerzy każdy odszedł do siebie, wkrótce jednak obie siostry niespodziewanie znowu przyszły do mnie. Usiadły i Emina rzekła:","After supper, each of them went home, but soon both sisters unexpectedly came back to me. They sat down, and Emina said:","The two sisters then retired with their negresses to that part of the underground residence that had been set aside for them. They reappeared for supper, then everyone went to bed. But when everything was quiet in the cavern, I saw Emina come in, bearing a lamp in one hand, like Psyche, and leading her younger sister, who was prettier than Cupid, by the other.","We had supper and made our way to bed. The two sisters came to me again, catching me unawares. Emina said to me, ‘Dear Alphonse, would you be able to make a sacrifice for us?"
"Gdy spostrzeżono, żem pierwszy głód zaspokoił i że zabieram się do tego, co nazywają w Hiszpanii l o s d u l c e s, piękna Emina rozkazała Murzynkom, aby mi pokazały, jak się w ich ojczyźnie tańczy. Zdawało się. że żaden rozkaz nie mógł być dla nich przyjemniejszy. Wypełniły go z żywością, która nawet cokolwiek przechodziła w swawolę. Zapewne nie byłbym nigdy w stanie położyć końca tym pląsom, gdybym nie był zapytał pięknych nieznajomych, czy one także czasami oddają się tej rozrywce. Za całą odpowiedź powstały i kazały sobie podać kastaniety. Taniec ich przypominał bolero wywodzące się z Murcji i fofę, tańczoną w Algarve. Ci, którzy zwiedzali te kraje, łatwo mogą sobie go wyobrazić, jednakże nigdy nie zdołają pojąć uroku, jaki dodawały mu wdzięki dwóch Afrykanek, osłonięte przezroczystymi fałdami, spływającymi po nadobnych kibiciach.","When it was noticed that I had satisfied my first hunger and that I was getting down to what they called in Spain l o s d u l c e s, the beautiful Emina ordered the black women to show me how to dance in their homeland. It seemed. that no order could have been more pleasant for them. They filled him with a vividness that turned into playfulness even in the slightest. Probably I would never have been able to put an end to this dance if I hadn't asked the beautiful strangers if they also indulged in this entertainment at times. They stood up for the whole answer and asked for castanets. Their dance resembled a bolero originating in Murcia and a phofa, danced in the Algarve. Those who have visited these countries can easily imagine him, however, they will never be able to comprehend the charm that the charms of two African women gave him, covered with transparent folds that flowed down over the like fans.","When my initial hunger was seen to have been appeased, and I was turning my attention to what are called in Spain los dulces, the lovely Emina commanded the negresses to show me how people danced in their country. It seemed that no command could be more agreeable to them. They obeyed with a liveliness that bordered on licence. I even believe that it would have been difficult to put a stop to their dancing, but I asked their beautiful mistresses whether they sometimes danced. By way of reply they simply rose and asked for castanets. The steps they danced resembled the bolero of Murcia and the fofa danced in the Algarve. Those who have been to these provinces will be able to form some idea of those steps, yet they will never understand all the charm brought to them by the natural gracefulness of the two African women, a charm heightened by the diaphanous robes in which they were clad.","When it was clear that the edge of my hunger had been blunted and that I had turned my attention to what in Spain are called los dulces, 10 Emina told the negresses to perform for me the dance of their country. There could have been no command more agreeable to them; they obeyed with an abandon which approached licentiousness. I even believe that it would have been difficult to bring their dance to an end if I had not asked their beautiful mistresses whether they also did not occasionally dance. They did not reply to my question, but rose up and asked for castanets. The steps they danced resembled the Murcia bolera and the fofa as it is performed in the Algarve. I say this to give people from those places an idea of their dance; but even then they will not be able to picture the charm which the grace and beauty of the two African strangers, enhanced as it was by their diaphanous garments, added to their movements."
"- Jaśnie wielmożny panie - mówił dalej Garcias - wiem, że jestem zbyt małoznaczącą osobą, aby jaśnie wielmożny pradziad Waszej Miłości miał wymagać po mnie jakiegokolwiek zadośćuczynienia.","- Lord, Lord, continued Garcias - I know that I am too vague a person for your great-great-grandfather to demand any compensation for me.","“My lord,” said Garcias, “I am well aware that I am of too little account that his lordship your grandfather should want to demand any satisfaction of me.”","‘My lord,’ replied Garcías, ‘I am well aware that I am of too little consequence for your noble great-grandfather to wish to demand satisfaction of me.’"
"- Piękna cudzoziemko - odpowiedziałem - bez wątpienia prawdę wyrzekłaś; komuż słuszniej przystoi mówić o wierności? Jest to religia serc prawdziwie kochających. Wszelako, zanim zaspokoicie mój głód, raczcie uczynić to naprzód z moją ciekawością i powiedzcie mi, kto jesteście.","""Beautiful foreigner,"" I replied, ""you have no doubt spoken the truth; to whom is it more fitting to speak of fidelity? It is the religion of true loving hearts. However, before you satisfy my hunger, please do so with my curiosity and tell me who you are.","“Beautiful stranger,” I replied, “your choice of words seems apt. Doubtless you are faithful, such is the religion of love. But deign to satisfy my curiosity before my appetite: tell me who you are.”","‘Fair stranger,’ I replied, ‘I think you have spoken the truth; you are indeed of the number of the faithful, but of those who profess the religion of love. Please satisfy my curiosity before my hunger, and tell me who you are.’"
"Wkrótce przybyły Murzynki i zastawiono wieczerzę, do której sam Zoto nam usługiwał z oznakami najgłębszego uszanowania. Po wieczerzy Murzynki posłały w jaskini wygodne łoże dla moich kuzynek, ja wynalazłem sobie drugą jaskinię i niebawem oddaliśmy się spoczynkowi, którego potrzeba tak silnie dawała się nam uczuwać.","Soon the Negroes arrived and a supper was set, to which Zoto himself served us with signs of the deepest respect. After the supper, the Negroes sent a comfortable bed for my cousins in the cave, I invented a second cave for myself and soon we gave ourselves up to rest, the need of which made us feel so strongly.","Then the negresses arrived; we were given supper and Zoto himself served us, with the most profound marks of respect. Then the negresses made up a reasonably comfortable bed for my cousins in a kind of cave. I went to sleep in another, and we all enjoyed the rest we needed.","The negresses appeared, and supper was served by Zoto himself, who showed us every mark of respect. Then the negresses made a tolerable bed for my cousins in a sort of grotto. I went to sleep in another grotto and we all enjoyed the rest we needed."

"Wierzchołki gór. na które miałem zamiar wejść, były bardziej oddalone, niż mi się to na pierwszy rzut oka wydawało, i zaledwie po godzinie pochodu zdołałem się na nie dostać.

On standing on the top, I saw a wild and empty plane beneath me, no sign of people, no animals or any buildings, no road but the one I had come, and silence all around. I broke them with a cry; the echo only replied to me in the distance.

"Około czwartej po południu dostaliśmy się między wydrążenia skaliste, gdzie zamierzaliśmy noc przepędzić. Cieszyłem się, że słońce jeszcze nie zaszło, gdyż widok byt zachwycający, zwłaszcza dla mnie, który dotąd widziałem tylko Ardeny i Zeelandię. U stóp moich rozciągała się czarująca Vega de Granada, którą mieszkańcy tego kraju przekornie nazywają la Nuestra Vegilla. Widziałem ją całą: jej sześć miast i czterdzieści wiosek, kręte koryto Genilu, potoki spadające ze szczytów Alpuhary, cieniste gaje, altany, domy, ogrody i mnóstwo wiejskich folwarków. Zachwycony czarownym widokiem tylu przedmiotów razem nagromadzonych, wszystkie zmysły we wzrok zestrzeliłem. Zbudził się we mnie miłośnik natury i zapomniałem zupełnie o moich kuzynkach, które nie-bawem przybyły w lektykach niesionych przez konie.

I was glad that the sun had not yet set, because the view was delightful, especially for me, which I had only seen before the Ardennes and Zeeland. At my feet stretched the charming Vega de Granada, which the inhabitants of this country perversely call la Nuestra Vegilla. I saw it all: its six cities and forty villages, the winding riverbed of the Genil, streams falling from the peaks of Alpuhara, shady groves, arbors, houses, gardens, and plenty of country farms. Delighted by the enchanting sight of so many objects gathered together, I shot down all my senses in the sight. A nature lover woke up in me and I completely forgot about my cousins, who had not come here in litters carried by horses. As they sat down on the cushions spread out in the cave and rested a little, I said to them:","At about four o’clock we reached some rock cavities, where we were to spend the night.

I could see it all, with its six towns, its forty villages – the most magnificent view lying before me. Enchanted to find that my eyes could behold so many lovely things at once, I surrendered myself to gazing upon them. I felt I was becoming a lover of nature. I forgot my cousins; yet soon they arrived in litters borne by horses. They sat down on flagstones in the cavern and when they were a little rested, I said to them: “Ladies, I have no complaint about the night I spent at Venta Quemada, but I confess it ended in a way I found immensely disagreeable.”","Towards four o’clock in the afternoon we reached some hollows in the rock where we were to pass the night.

Zota, których trupy leżały po obu moich stronach.","Realizing that she had already instructed her foster child sufficiently, Kamilla opened the door, led me to her sister's bed and lay down with us. What can I say about this unfortunate night? I have reached the heights of sin and delight. I struggled with sleepiness and with nature to drag the hell out of fun as long as possible. Finally I fell asleep, and the next day I woke up at the gallows of my brothers. Zota, whose dead bodies lay on either side of me.","When Camille considered her pupil sufficiently indoctrinated, she came and opened the door to me, led me to her sister’s bed, and lay down beside us. What shall I say of that fateful night? I exhausted its pleasures and crimes. For a long time I fought against sleep and nature, the more to protract my diabolical gratification. At last I fell asleep, and I awoke the next day beneath the gallows on which Zoto’s brothers were hanged, lying between their vile corpses.","When Camilla thought that her pupil had received enough instruction, she opened the door to me and led me to the bed where her sister was lying, and lay down beside us. What can I tell you about that fateful night? I drank the cup of criminal passion to the last drop. I long fought against my natural desire for sleep in order to prolong my sinful pleasures. I fell asleep at last and awoke the next day under the gallows of Zoto’s brothers, lying between their foul corpses."
"- Nie słyszałam reszty mowy ojca, zemdlałam bowiem, zanim skończył. Odzyskawszy zmysły, spostrzegłam brata, podającego mi księgę Sefirot. Wolałabym znowu stracić przytomność, ale trzeba było poddać się wyrokowi. Mój brat, który dobrze wiedział, że należy wrócić ze mną do pierwszych początków, miał dość cierpliwości i jeden po drugim wszystkie mi je przypomniał. Zaczęłam od składania sylab, następnie przeszłam do wyrazów i formuł. Powoli wzniosła ta nauka zupełnie mnie oczarowała. Przepędzałam całe noce w gabinecie, który służył memu ojcu za obserwatorium, i szłam spać dopiero, gdy światło dzienne przerywało moje badania; wtedy upadałam ze znużenia. Mulatka moja, Zulejka, rozbierała mnie, sama nie wiedziałam kiedy. Po kilku godzinach spoczynku wracałam do zatrudnień, do których bynajmniej nie byłam stworzona, jak to sam wkrótce zobaczysz.","I couldn't hear the rest of my father's speech because I passed out before he finished. Regaining my senses, I noticed my brother handing me the book of Sefirot. I wish I had passed out again, but I had to submit to the sentence. My brother, who knew very well to come back to the first beginnings with me, had enough patience and reminded me of them all one by one. I started with syllables, then moved on to words and formulas. Slowly ascending, this science completely charmed me. I spent all nights in my father's observatory study, and only went to bed when daylight interrupted my research; then I collapsed with weariness. My mulatto girl, Zulejka, undressed me, I didn't know when. After a few hours of sleep, I returned to jobs for which I was by no means made, as you will soon see for yourself.","I did not hear the last of my father’s words. I had fainted before he finished. When I regained consciousness, I saw my brother handing me The Book of Sefiroth. I thought I would faint again, but I had to bow to necessity. My brother, who quite rightly suspected he would have to take me back to first principles, had the patience to help me gradually call them back to mind. I began with the composition of syllables, then went on to words and phrases. In the end I developed a passion for this sublime science. I would spend all night long in the study that had served as my father’s observatory, and I would go to bed when daylight made it impossible to continue my work. By then I would be ready to drop for want of sleep. My mulatto maidservant Zulica would undress me almost without my noticing. I would sleep a few hours and then return to these pursuits for which I was not meant, as you will see.","I did not hear the end of what my father said. I had fainted before he had finished speaking.

"Obudziłem ją, jak można było najłagodniej, jednakowoż widok, którego nie mogłem zasłonić, wtrącił ją w stan niewypowiedzianej boleści. Dostała konwulsji, zaczęła płakać i zemdlała. Wziąłem ją na ręce i zaniosłem do pobliskiego źródła; tam skropiłem jej twarz wodą i z wolna przywróciłem do zmysłów.","I woke her up as gently as possible, but the sight that I could not cover had plunged her into a state of unspeakable pain. She convulsed, began to cry and passed out. I took it in my arms and carried it to a nearby spring; there I sprinkled water on her face and slowly brought her back to my senses.","I woke her as gently as I could. However, the shock, which I could not entirely spare her, put her in a terrible state. She fell into convulsions, wept, fainted. I took her in my arms and carried her to a nearby spring.

Orlandyna interrupted.,"For those girls I was with were anything but that.” “You seemed to love all three well enough,” said Orlandine.","‘But you certainly looked as though you loved all three of them,’ said Orlandine."
"Nie pamiętam, jak długo bawiły nas te namiętne sceny, ale niebawem gwałtowność naszych uczuć znacznie się uspokoiła. Powzięłyśmy chęć do niektórych nauk, szczególnie zaś do znajomości roślin, których przymioty poznawałyśmy z dzieł sławnego Averroesa. Matka moja, w przekonaniu, że nigdy nie można dość się uzbroić przeciw nudom seraju, z przyjemnością spoglądała na nasze zatrudnienia i chcąc nam ułatwić naukę, kazała sprowadzić z Mekki świętą niewiastę, zwaną Hazareta, czyli świętą świętych. Hazareta uczyła nas praw Proroka i wykładała nam nauki tym czystym i melodyjnym językiem, jakiego używa dziś jedno tylko pokolenie Koreisz. Nie mogłyśmy dość się jej nasłuchać i niebawem umiałyśmy prawie cały Koran na pamięć. Następnie matka opowiadała nam historię naszej rodziny i udzieliła nam mnóstwo pamiętników, z których jedne były pisane po arabsku, inne zaś po hiszpańsku.","I don't remember how long we were entertained by these passionate scenes, but soon the violence of our feelings calmed down considerably. We became eager to learn some sciences, especially to plants, the qualities of which we learned from the works of the famous Averroes. My mother, convinced that one can never be armed enough against the boredom of the Seraglio, looked with pleasure at our jobs and, wanting to facilitate our learning, ordered a holy woman called Hazareta, or saint of saints, to be brought from Mecca. Hazareta taught us the laws of the Prophet and taught us the teachings in this pure and melodious language that only one generation of Koreish uses today. We couldn't listen to it enough and soon we knew almost the entire Koran by heart. Then our mother told us about our family history and gave us a lot of diaries, some in Arabic and some in Spanish.","I do not know for how long we entertained ourselves with these impassioned scenes, but finally they gave way to more tranquil sentiments. We acquired a taste for the study of some sciences, especially for the knowledge of plants, which we studied in the writings of the celebrated Averroes. My mother, who believed it impossible to arm oneself too much against the boredom of the harem, saw with pleasure that we liked to keep ourselves occupied. She summoned from Mecca a holy person called Hazereta, or the saint par excellence. Hazereta taught us the law of the Prophet. Her lessons were couched in that language of such purity and harmony which is spoken by the Koraish tribe. We could not tire of listening to her, and we knew by heart almost the whole of the Koran. Then my mother instructed us herself in the history of our family, and placed in our hands a great number of memoirs, some in Arabic, others in Spanish.","I can’t remember for how long we enjoyed these passionate interludes, but in the end we allowed calmer sentiments to take their place.

"Ojciec mój, w odpowiedzi na list marszałka, upraszał, aby raczono mu w przyszłości przesyłać wyciągi z wyroków trybunału. Ta łaska została mu udzielona i odtąd na początku każdego miesiąca otrzymywał wielki zwój papierów, który przez cztery tygodnie wystarczał na domowe rozmowy i pogawędki podczas długich wieczorów zimowych przy kominie, w lecie zaś na dwóch ławkach przypartych do zamkowej bramy.","In reply to the marshal's letter, my father asked him to receive excerpts from the tribunal's judgments in the future. This grace was granted to him, and from then on, at the beginning of each month, he received a large roll of papers, which for four weeks was enough for home talks and chats during the long winter evenings by the chimney, and in the summer, on the two pews leaning against the castle gate.","My father, in reply to the marshal’s letter, asked if he would be so kind as to send him in due course a summary of the court’s proceedings.

"Przez kilka następnych dni lękałam się spojrzeć w zwierciadło. Nareszcie odważyłam się. Boskie bliźnięta, z rękami założonymi na piersiach, łagodnymi i czułymi spojrzeniami rozproszyły moją bojaźń. Nie wiedziałam jednak, co im powiedzieć. Aby wybrnąć z kłopotu, poszłam po tom dzieł Edrisa, który wy nazywacie Atlasem. Jest to najpiękniejsza poezja, jaką posiadamy. Dźwięki wierszy Edrisa naśladują harmonię ciał niebieskich. Nie jestem dość obeznana z językiem tego autora, lękając się więc, czym źle nie przeczytała, ukradkiem spojrzałam w zwierciadło, aby przekonać się, jaki skutek wywieram na słuchaczach. Mogłam być zupełnie zadowolona. Thoamimowie spoglądali po sobie wzrokiem pełnym uznania dla mnie i czasami rzucali w zwierciadło spojrzenia, na których widok byłam mocno wzruszona.","For the next few days, I was afraid to look into the mirror.

"Przybywszy do Los Alcornoques, ujrzałem przy źródle koszyk nakryty winnym liściem: musiały w nim być owoce, zapomniane przez jakiegoś podróżnego. Ciekawie pogrążyłem weń rękę i z przyjemnością znalazłem cztery piękne figi i pomarańczę. Ofiarowałem dwie figi Lopezowi, ale podziękował mi. mówiąc, że może zaczekać do wieczora. Zjadłem więc sam wszystko i następnie chciałem napić się wody ze źródła. Lopez wstrzymał mnie, dowodząc, że woda szkodzi po owocach, i podał mi trochę pozostałego mu jeszcze alikantu. Przyjąłem poczęstunek, ale zaledwie uczułem wino w żołądku, gdym doznał nagłego ściśnienia serca. Niebo i ziemia zakręciły mi się przed oczyma i byłbym niezawodnie zemdlał, gdyby Lopez nie był mi pośpieszył na pomoc. Otrzeźwił mnie, mówiąc, że nie powinienem się dziwić i że stan ten pochodził z czczości i znużenia. W istocie, nie tylko odzyskałem siły, ale nawet czułem się w stanie nadzwyczajnego podniecenia. Okolica zdawała się połyskiwać tysiącznymi barwami, przedmioty zaiskrzyły się w mych oczach, jak gwiazdy podczas letniej nocy, i krew zaczęła mi bić gwałtownie, zwłaszcza na szyi i skroniach.","On arriving at Los Alcornoques, I saw at the spring a basket covered with a vine leaf: there must have been fruit in it, forgotten by some traveler. I curiously plunged my hand into it and was pleased to find four beautiful figs and an orange. I offered two panties to Lopez, but he thanked me. saying he can wait until evening. So I ate everything myself and then wanted to drink water from the spring. Lopez stopped me, proving that water was bad for the fruit, and handed me some of the remaining alicant. I accepted the refreshment, but barely felt the wine in my stomach when my heart suddenly lowered. Heaven and earth twisted before my eyes, and I would have passed out without fail, had Lopez not been rushing to help me. He sobered me up, saying that I shouldn't be surprised and that the condition was due to idleness and weariness. In fact, not only did I regain my strength, but I even felt in a state of extreme excitement. The surroundings seemed to sparkle with a thousand colors, things sparkled in my eyes like stars on a summer night, and my blood began to beat violently, especially on my neck and temples.","When we arrived at Los Alcornoques, I found on the drinking-trough a basket filled with vine-leaves. It looked as though it had been full of fruit and was left behind by some traveller. I searched it with curiosity and had the pleasure of finding in it four lovely figs and an orange. I offered two figs to Lopez, but he refused them, saying that he could wait until the evening. So I ate all the fruit, after which I would have quenched my thirst at the nearby spring. Lopez stopped me, alleging that the water would be bad for me after the fruit, and that he had the remains of some Alicante wine to offer me. I accepted his offer, but hardly was the wine in my stomach when I felt extremely unwell. I saw the earth and the sky spinning above my head, and I would certainly have fainted had Lopez not rushed to my aid. He helped me recover from my attack and told me that it was no cause for alarm, being simply a result of tiredness and lack of food. Indeed, not only had I recovered, I was in a state of health and excitement that had an extraordinary quality about it. The countryside seemed to me enamelled in the most brilliant colours; objects scintillated before my eyes like stars in summer nights, and I felt my arteries throbbing.","When we reached Los Alcornoques, I found a basket full of vine leaves on the trough; it appeared to have once been full of fruit, and to have been left behind by a traveller.

The countryside appeared to me to be painted in the most glowing colours; as I looked at them, objects sparkled like stars in a summer night; I could feel my pulse pounding in my temples and my neck."
"Na te straszliwe słowa włosy najeżyły się na głowach biesiadników, niektórzy przeżegnali się, inni powstali od stołu.

"Margrabia odskoczył kilka kroków w tył i porwal się do szpady, ale ojciec dobył pistoletów zza pasa i roztrzaskał mu głowę. Następnie udał się do Montalta i oświadczył mu, że jego nieprzyjaciel już nie żyje. Hrabia uściskał go i wyliczył pięćset cekinów. Wtedy mój ojciec, nieco zmieszany, wyznał, że margrabia przed śmiercią dał mu za zamordowanie hrabiego pięćset cekinów. Montalto wynurzył swoją radość, że zdołał uprzedzić nieprzyjaciela.","The margrave jumped back a few steps and tore his sword, but his father drew his pistols from his belt and smashed his head. He then went to Montalta and told him that his enemy was no longer alive. The count hugged him and counted five hundred sequins. Then my father, somewhat confused, confessed that the margrave had given him five hundred sequins for murdering the count before his death. Montalto surfaced his joy at being ahead of the enemy.","But my father drew a pistol from his belt and shot him dead. Then he went to call on Montalto and told him that his enemy was no more. The Comte embraced him and gave him the five hundred sequins.

The Comte said he was delighted to have forestalled his enemy.","The marchese leapt back and drew his sword, but my father drew a pistol from his belt and blew the marchese’s brains out. He then went to Montalto and told him that his enemy was no more. The count embraced him and gave him the five hundred sequins.

Montalto said that he was delighted to have forestalled his enemy."

"- Drodzy towarzysze broni, wiecie, ile razy uspokoiłem wasze sumienia, gdy honor wasz zdawał się być zagrożony. Dziś sam jestem zmuszony odwołać się do waszego światła, lękam się bowiem, że mój własny sąd nie byłby dość jasny, a raczej, że uczucie stronności stanęłoby mi na zawadzie. Oto jest list od burmistrza Bouillon, którego świadectwo zasługuje na szacunek, jakkolwiek urzędnik ten bynajmniej nie pochodzi z krwi szlacheckiej. Wyrzeknijcie więc, czy honor nakazuje mi zamieszkać zamek moich przodków lub też czy dalej mam służyć królowi don Filipowi, który obsypał mnie dobrodziejstwami i w ostatnich czasach wzniósł nawet do godności dowódcy brygady. Zostawiam list na stole i sam odchodzę; za pół godziny powrócę i dowiem się o waszym postanowieniu.","“Dear comrades-in-arms, you know how many times I have pacified your consciences when your honor seemed to be at stake. Today I myself am forced to refer to your light, for I fear that my own judgment would not be clear enough, but rather that a feeling of partiality would be in my way. Here is a letter from the mayor of Bouillon, whose testimony is worthy of respect, although this official is by no means noble. Therefore, renounce whether my honor requires me to live in the castle of my ancestors, or whether I am to continue to serve King Don Philip, who showered me with favors and, in recent times, even made me a brigade commander. I leave the letter on the table and walk away by myself; I'll be back in half an hour and hear your resolution.","“My dear brothers-in-arms, you know well enough how many times I have set your consciences at rest in cases where honour seemed compromised. Today I find myself obliged to rely on your wisdom, because I fear my own judgement fails me; or rather , I fear it is clouded by some sense of partiality. Here is the letter written to me by the magistrates of Bouillon, whose testimony is worthy of respect, though they are not gentlemen. Tell me if honour obliges me to dwell in my fathers’ castle, or if I ought to continue to serve King Don Philip, who has showered me with favours, and has recently raised me to the rank of brigadier-general. I am leaving the letter on the table and going away. I shall return in half and hour to learn what you have decided.”","‘My dear brothers in arms.

Here is the letter written to me by the magistrates of Bouillon, whose testimony is worthy of respect although they are not noblemen. Tell me whether honour requires that I should return to live in my ancestral castle or whether I should continue to serve King Philip, who has overwhelmed me with favours and has just promoted me to the rank of brigadier-general.

"Tu Tybald natężył całą uwagę, gdyż w istocie sąsiadował z pewnym szlachcicem, nazwiskiem de Sombre Roche, który uchodził za niesłychanie zazdrosnego. Kilkakrotnie chełpił się przed Tybaldem, że mu pokaże, iż można mieć wierną żonę; mówił, że wychowuje w zamku swoim powabne dziewczę, które poślubi. by potwierdzić prawdę swego zdania. Ale młody Tybald wcale nie wiedział, że dziewczę znajduje się w tej chwili w Lyonie, i mocno cieszył się, że je do swoich rąk dostał. Tymczasem Orlandyna tak dalej mówiła:","Here Tybald drew all the attention, for he was in fact neighbors with a certain noble named de Sombre Roche, who was considered to be extremely jealous. Several times he boasted to Tybald that he would show him that it was possible to have a faithful wife; he said that he was raising his charming girl in the castle, whom he would marry. to confirm the truth of your opinion. But young Tybald did not know at all that the girl was in Lyons at the moment, and he was very glad to receive them. Orlandyna, meanwhile, continued:","At this point young Thibaud grew very attentive, for he was indeed the neighbour of a gentleman called Sire de Sombre, reputed to be of a jealous disposition, who had often boasted in Thibaud’s presence that one day he would show that a man could have a faithful wife; he boasted too of having a young maiden reared in his castle, who was to become his wife and prove the truth of what he said. Young Thibaud had not realized she was in Lyons, and was delighted to have her in his clutches. Meanwhile, Orlandine continued with these words:","At this young Thibaud pricked up his ears, because he was indeed the neighbour of a gentleman called the Sieur de Sombre, who had the reputation of being very jealous. And the aforesaid Sieur de Sombre had often boasted in Thibaud’s presence that he would demonstrate one day that it was possible to ensure the fidelity of one’s wife, and that he was bringing up a young maiden in his castle who would become his wife and prove his claim. But young Thibaud did not know she had reached Lyon and was delighted to have her in his hands. Meanwhile Orlandine continued as follows:"
"To mówiąc pustelnik czule mnie uściskał, ale nie dał mi żadnej relikwii dla zachowania spokoju mej duszy. Nie chciałem mu przypominać i dosiadłszy konia opuściłem pustelnię.","Saying this, the hermit embraced me tenderly, but gave me no relic for the sake of peace in my soul. I did not want to remind him, and having mounted my horse, I left the hermitage.","Having said these things, the hermit embraced me warmly, but he did not give me any relic to protect me from the fiends. I did not want to mention it to him again, and I mounted my horse.",After these words the hermit embraced me affectionately. But he did not give me a relic to ward off demons. I did not like to mention it again so I got on my horse.
"- Kochany synu - rzekł pustelnik - twoja historia mocno mnie zajęła i dziękuję ci, żeś mi ją raczył opowiedzieć. Widzę teraz po sposobie twego wychowania, że bojaźń jest dla ciebie zupełnie nieznanym uczuciem; ale ponieważ przepędziłeś noc w Venta Quemada, lękam się, czyś tam nie doświadczył nagabywań dwóch wisielców i żebyś kiedyś nie uległ smutnemu losowi opętanego Paszeko.","""My dear son,"" said the hermit, ""I am deeply interested in your story, and I thank you for telling me about it."" I can see now from the way you were brought up that fear is a completely unfamiliar feeling for you; but because you spent the night in Venta Quemada, I am afraid that you have not experienced the pleadings of two hangmen there and that you may not succumb to the sad fate of the possessed Pasheko one day.","“My dear child,” said the hermit, “your story has greatly interested me, and I am very obliged to you for having been good enough to tell it to me. I now see clearly, from the manner in which you have been brought up, that fear is a sentiment that must be completely unknown to you. But since you have spent the night at Venta Quemada, I am much afraid that you may be exposed to the molestations of the two hanged men, and that you may suffer the sad fate of the demonaic.”","‘My son,’ said the hermit to me, ‘I have found your story absorbing and I am very grateful to you for being so good as to tell it to me. I can now well see that from your upbringing fear is an emotion which must remain completely alien to you. But since you did sleep at the Venta Quemada I am afraid that you were exposed to haunting by the two hanged men and that you have suffered the same fate as the demoniacal Pacheco.’"
Pustelnik na pozór zdziwił się mocno tą odpowiedzią;,The hermit was seemingly surprised by this answer;,This reply seemed to surprise the hermit.,This reply seemed to take the hermit aback.

"- Mój ojcze, ten opętany szlachcic widział rzeczy całkiem odmienne. Jeden z nas bez wątpienia był otumaniony, może nawet i obaj źle widzieliśmy. Ale oto masz przed sobą szlachetnego kabalistę, który także nocował w Venta Quemada. Może zechce nam opowiedzieć swoje przygody, w których znajdziemy nowe światło co do wypadków, jakie nas od kilku dni zajmują.","""My father, this obsessed nobleman saw things quite different."" One of us was clearly dazed, maybe even we both saw badly. But here is a noble Kabbalist who also stayed at Venta Quemada. Maybe he would like to tell us his adventures, in which we will find new light about the events that have been occupying us for several days.","After giving this a few moments’ thought, I replied: “Father, this demoniac gentleman has seen some strange things. Perhaps his eyes have been tricked. The events that concern us are of the most extraordinary nature. We could never gather too much information about them. Here is a gentleman whom I had the honour of finding asleep beneath the gibbet. If he would tell us his adventure, his account could not fail to be of great interest to us.”","After having thought for a moment I replied: ‘Father, this demoniacal gentleman saw things that I did not see. One of us has been bewitched. Perhaps both of us were suffering from delusions. But here is a gentleman, a cabbalist, who also slept at the Venta Quemada. If he will consent to tell us what happened perhaps we will gain new insight into the events which have been occupying us for the last few days.’"
"Wtedy poczułem, że jeden z wisielców chwyta mnie za kostkę lewej nogi, chciałem mu ją wydrzeć, ale wtem drugi stanął mi w poprzek drogi. Zatrzymał się, wytrzeszczył na mnie okropne oczy i wywalił język czerwony jak żelazo z ognia dobyte. Błagałem o miłosierdzie - na próżno. Jedną ręką porwał mnie za gardło, drugą zaś wydarł to właśnie oko, które dotąd nie może się zagoić. W miejsce oka wsunął swój rozpalony język i zaczął mi lizać mózg tak, że ryczałem z boleści.","Then I felt one of the hanged men grabbing my left ankle, I tried to tear it away from him, but then the other stood across the road. He stopped, glare at me horrible eyes, and stuck out his tongue red like iron from a fire. I begged for mercy - in vain. He grabbed my throat with one hand, and with the other he tore out this very eye, which has not yet healed. He put his fiery tongue in place of his eye and began to lick my brain so much that I screamed in pain.","Then I felt one of the hanged men seize me by the heel of my left foot. I tried to shake him off, but his brother cut in front of me. He appeared before me, rolling his eyes dreadfully, and sticking out a tongue as red as an iron drawn from the fire. I begged for mercy; in vain. With one hand he grabbed me by the throat, and with the other he tore out the eye I am now missing. In the place where my eye had been, he stuck his burning-hot tongue. With it he licked my brain and made me howl with pain.","Then I felt one of the hanged men seize my left ankle. I tried to shake myself free but the other one cut off my escape. He loomed up in front of me, staring at me with terrible eyes and poking out his tongue, which was as red as iron straight from the furnace. I pleaded for mercy but in vain. With one hand he grasped me by the throat, and with the other he tore out my eye, the one that I am now missing. He darted his burning tongue into my eye-socket and licked my brains, which made me bellow with pain."
"Powiedziałam ci, że miałyśmy jedno tylko okno, czyli że jedno tylko wychodziło na podwórzec zamkowy; inne otwierały się na drugie podwórze, zasadzone kilku drzewami, przedstawiającymi ogród, którego jedyne wyjście prowadziło do mego pokoju. Pielęgnowałam tam niektóre kwiaty i to było całą moją przyjemnością. Mylę się, miałam jeszcze jedną, równie niewinną zabawę. Było to wielkie zwierciadło, w którym przeglądałam się każdego poranku, jak tylko wstałam z łóżka. Moja ochmistrzyni, rozebrana, przychodziła przeglądać się również i bawiłam się porównywaniem jej postaci z moją. Oddawałam się tej rozrywce także przed pójściem na spoczynek, gdy ochmistrzyni głęboko już spała. Czasami wyobrażałam sobie, że widzę w zwierciadle towarzyszkę w moim wieku, która odpowiada na moje poruszenia i dzieli moje uczucia. Im więcej oddawałam się złudzeniu, tym bardziej ta igraszka mnie bawiła.","I told you that we only had one window, so that only one overlooked the castle courtyard; others opened onto a second courtyard, planted with several trees representing a garden whose only exit led to my room. I cultivated some flowers there and it was all my pleasure. I am wrong, I had one more, equally innocent fun. It was a huge mirror in which I looked at myself every morning as soon as I got out of bed. My housekeeper, stripped down, also came to look at herself and I had fun comparing her character with mine. I also indulged in this entertainment before going to bed, when the housekeeper was already deeply asleep. Sometimes I imagined seeing a companion my age in the mirror, responding to my movements and sharing my feelings. The more I indulged in delusions, the more this game amused me.","I told you we had but a single window. That is to say, there was only one that looked out on the castle courtyard. The others overlooked another courtyard, planted with a few trees and so able to pass for a garden, and to which there was no access except through my bedroom. I grew flowers in it, and it was my sole diversion. I tell a lie, I had another, just as innocent. It was a large mirror in which I would go and look at myself as soon as I got up, not to say the instant I jumped out of bed. My governess – like me, still in her nightclothes – would come and gaze at herself too, and I would amuse myself by comparing my figure with hers. I would also indulge in this entertainment before going to bed, and when my governess was already asleep. Sometimes I fancied that I saw in my mirror a companion of my own age, who responded to my gestures and shared my feelings. The more I surrendered myself to this illusion, the more pleasure I took in the game.","As I have told you, we had only one window, by which I mean only one looked out on to the courtyard of the castle. The others looked on to another courtyard which, as there were trees planted there, could pass for a garden, and to which there was only one way out, which led through my bedroom. I grew a few flowers there. It was my one pastime. I am not telling you the whole truth, for I had another pastime as innocent as the first. There was a tall mirror in which I went to look at myself as soon as I had got up. Indeed on getting out of bed, my governess, as little dressed as I was, went to look at herself in it also and it amused me to compare my figure with hers. I would also indulge myself in this distraction before going to bed and after my governess was already asleep. Sometimes I imagined that I saw in the mirror a companion of my own age, who responded to my gestures and shared my feelings.

"Zostawiona sama sobie, zebrałam całą odwagę. Noc była ciemna, stałam w koszuli, z bosymi nogami, rozpuszczonym włosem, trzymając księgę w jednej, a magiczną szarfę w drugiej ręce. Zwróciłam kroki w kierunku góry, która zdawała mi się być najbliższa. Jakiś pasterz chciał mnie pochwycić; odepchnęłam go ręką, w której trzymałam księgę, i padł trupem u mych nóg.

I am returning from my brother, with whom we did the most horrible spells, to learn the essence of the spirits that attacked him in Venta Quemada, but our efforts were unsuccessful.

"- Więc to twoja własność, senor kawalerze. Jeżeli tu noc przepędziłeś, wcale nie dziwię się. żeś się obudził pod szubienicą.

"Więzienie było zupełnie ciemne; ponieważ nie mogłem wyciągnąć rąk przed siebie, lękałem się, że chodząc mógłbym uderzyć głową o mur. Dlatego też usiadłem w miejscu, gdzie mnie pozostawiono, i - jak można łatwo pojąć - zacząłem rozmyślać nad przyczynami tak gwałtownego ze mną postępowania. Od razu pomyślałem, że inkwizycja schwytała Eminę i Zibeldę i że Murzynki opowiedziały wszystko, co się stało w Venta Quemada. W takim wypadku bez wątpienia zadadzą mi pytania względem pięknych Afrykanek. Miałem dwie drogi przed sobą: albo zdradzić moje kuzynki i złamać dane im słowo honoru, lub też wyprzeć się ich znajomości; utrzymując to drugie zdanie, byłbym zabrnął w pasmo bezwstydnych kłamstw. Namyśliwszy się więc przez chwilę, postanowiłem zachować jak najgłębsze milczenie i na wszelkie zapytania nie odpowiadać ani słowa.","The prison was completely dark; since I could not reach out my hands in front of me, I was afraid that I might hit my head against the wall as I walked. So I sat down where I had been left and, as is easy to understand, began to ponder the reasons for my violent behavior with me. I immediately thought that the inquisition had captured Emina and Zibelda and that the Negroes had told everything that had happened in Venta Quemada. In that case, they will no doubt ask me questions about beautiful African women. There were two ways ahead of me: either to betray my cousins and break their word of honor, or to deny their acquaintance; by keeping that second sentence, I would have been caught up in a streak of shameless lies. So, after thinking for a moment, I decided to remain as silent as possible and not to answer any questions.","The cell was totally dark, and not having a free hand to stretch out in front of me, I would have had difficulty in advancing without banging my nose against the walls. That is why I sat down right where I was, and as anyone might readily imagine, I began to reflect on what could have given rise to my imprisonment. My first and only thought was that the Inquisition had seized my lovely cousins, and the negresses had reported everything that had happened at Venta Quemada. Assuming that I was to be interrogated about the Africans beauties, the only choice I had was either to betray them and break my word of honour, or deny that I knew them, which would have involved me in a series of shameful lies. After having deliberated on what course to adopt, I decided upon the most absolute silence, and I firmly resolved not to respond at all to any questioning.","It was pitch-black in the cell and, not having my hands free to feel my way forward, I would have found it difficult to walk about without banging my nose on the walls. So I sat down where I was and, as one may well imagine, began to wonder what could have caused me to be imprisoned. My first and only thought was that the Inquisition had captured my beautiful cousins and that their black servants had reported everything that had happened at the Venta Quemada. Supposing that I was going to be interrogated about the two African girls, I was faced with the alternative of either betraying them and thus breaking my solemn word of honour, or of denying that I knew them, which would embark me on a series of shameful lies. After some thought as to how I should behave, I decided to maintain absolute silence and I firmly resolved to say nothing in reply to any interrogation."

Lopez odrzekł mi, że mulnik pozostał kilka staj za nami, aby poprawić coś przy jukach.

Remember all my words. - My son, I speak to you first. I have appointed you heavenly wives, daughters of Solomon and the queen of Sheba. Before their birth, no one thought they would become immortal, but Solomon taught the queen to pronounce the name of the one who is. The Queen spoke the name at the time of her birth. The geniuses of the Grand Orient arrived and took in two twins before they touched the unclean habitat they call earth; then they were lifted up into the sphere of the daughters of Elohim, where they were granted the gift of immortality with the power to share it with the one whom the two fellow sisters would one day choose as their common spouse. It is these two spouses with ineffable qualities that their father mentions in his Shir hash-shirim, or Song of Songs. Ponder this divine epithelium, pausing every nine verses. - For you, my daughter, I destine a far more sacred union. The two Thoamim, the same that the Greeks knew as the Dioscurs and the Phoenicians as the Kabirs, in a word, the Zodiac Gemini will be your spouses. What am I saying? ... your heart is too tender ...

You would not tell us your story, and I, like you, have fallen victim to those cursed vampires whose hateful tricks have in an instant reduced to nothing the lengthy precautions my father took to assure me of immortality. I cannot yet bring myself to believe the horrors of last night. Yet I am going to try to recall them and tell you what happened. But you will not understand unless I pick up the story of my life at an earlier point.","‘I clearly foresaw,’ she said, ‘that your discretion would be disastrous for us. You refused to tell us what happened to you so, like you, I have fallen victim to those accursed vampires. I can hardly bring myself to believe the horrors of last night. I shall, however, try to recall them and relate them to you, but you will not be able to understand them fully unless I start my story from an earlier point in my life.’"
"Padron Lettereo był kapitanem uzbrojonej pinki, przeznaczonej niby na połów korali, w istocie zaś szanowny marynarz zajmował się przemycaniem, a nawet rozbojem, gdy znalazł do tego przyjazne okoliczności. Wprawdzie nieczęsto mu się to wydarzało, gdyż nie mając armat, musiał poprzestawać na łupieniu statków przy bezludnych wybrzeżach.","Padron Lettereo was the captain of an armed pin, intended for fishing for corals, and in fact the honorable sailor was engaged in smuggling, and even robbery, when he found friendly circumstances for it. Admittedly, this did not happen often to him, because, having no cannons, he had to settle for looting ships on uninhabited shores.","Now then, Padron Lettereo was the captain of a vessel equipped supposedly for coral-fishing, but actually used for smuggling and even piracy, whenever the opportunity presented itself. Which did not happen very often, because it carried no cannon and had to take ships by surprise in deserted coves.","Now Padron Lettereo was the captain of an armed pink which was supposedly equipped for coral fishing but was actually used for smuggling and even piracy if a good opportunity arose, which was not very often because it carried no cannon and had to take ships by surprise off deserted beaches."
"Pustelnik zastawił nam skromną wieczerzę, po której każdy odszedł do siebie. Kabalista utrzymywał; że musi przepędzić noc obok opętanego, ja zaś udałem się do kaplicy. Położyłem się na tym samym łóżku polowym, na którym już jedną noc przepędziłem; pustelnik życzył mi dobrego snu i uprzedził, że dla większej pewności, odchodząc, zamknie drzwi za sobą.","The hermit gave us a modest supper, after which each one went home. The Kabbalist maintained; that he must pass the night by the possessed, and I went to the chapel. I lay down on the same camp bed on which I had already spent one night; The hermit wished me a good night's sleep and warned me that he would close the door behind him when he left.","The anchorite served us a frugal supper, after which everyone’s only thought was of going to bed. The cabbalist claimed to have reasons for spending the night with the demonaic Pacheco, and I was sent to the chapel, as on that other occasion. My mossy bed was still there.","The hermit served us a frugal supper, after which everyone only thought of bed. The cabbalist claimed that he had good reasons for sleeping beside the possessed man.

"Dziwne może się wydawać, że zajmowałem się tyle sprawami mojego honoru a tak mało wypadkami poprzedniej nocy, ale ten sposób myślenia był skutkiem mego wychowania, jak to się pokaże w dalszym ciągu tego opowiadania. Tymczasem wracam do mojej podróży.","It may seem strange that I dealt with so many cases of my honor and so few cases the night before, but this way of thinking was the result of my upbringing, as will be shown later in this story. Meanwhile, I am back on my journey.","People will perhaps be surprised to find me so concerned with my reputation, and so little concerned with the events of the previous day, but this way of thinking was again a result of the education I had received; this will be seen from the continuation of my story. For now, I return to the account of my journey.","It may come as a surprise that I was so much preoccupied with my reputation and so little with the events of the previous evening.

"- Czy senor nazywasz się Alfonsem van Worden? Odpowiedziałem, że tak jest.",- Are you senor Alfons van Worden? I replied that it is so.,"I was still preoccupied with these thoughts when a horseman, suddenly riding out from behind a rock, cut across my path and said: “Is your name Alphonse van Worden?” I replied that it was.","I was ruminating on these matters when a horseman suddenly shot out from behind a rock, cut me off and said, ‘Is your name Alphonse van Worden?’ I replied that it was."
"Byłem oburzony. - Przebóg! - rzekłem sam do siebie - możeż to być, aby dwa tak miłe i rozkoszne stworzenia były złośliwymi duchami, nawykłymi drwić ze śmiertelnych, przybierając kształty wszelkiego rodzaju. albo czarownicami, lub też. co byłoby najstraszliwsze. upiorami, którym niebo dozwoliło ożywić ohydne trupy wisielców z doliny Los Hermanos? Wprawdzie mniemałem, że zdołam sobie te rzeczy zwykłym sposobem wytłumaczyć, ale teraz sam już nie wiedziałem, czemu mam wierzyć.","I was indignant. - God! I said to myself, it may be that two so kind and delightful creatures should be malicious spirits, accustomed to mock mortals, taking forms of all kinds. either witches, or. which would be the most terrible. the ghouls that the sky has allowed to revive the hideous corpses of the hanged men of the Los Hermanos Valley? Although I thought I could explain these things to myself in the usual way, now I no longer knew what to believe.","However, they appeared to take no interest in me, and moved away when their dance was over. I returned to the library, where I found on the table a large volume written in Gothic characters, the title of which was Strange Tales by Happelius.","I was indignant. Heavens above, I said to myself, can it be possible that two such adorable and adoring creatures should be two sprites who are in the habit of playing tricks on mortals by taking on many forms and shapes? Or even two witches? Or, what would be even more horrible, vampires which heaven has allowed to assume the hideous bodies of the hanged men in the valley? It seemed to me a moment ago that all my experiences could have had a natural explanation, but now I was not so sure."
"Mogę wam jedynie powiedzieć, że nie tylko z każdym dniem nabywaliśmy nowych wiadomości, ale nadto nowej potęgi. Jeżeli nawet nie śmieliśmy jej jeszcze używać, to przecież cieszyliśmy się, dumni, że według wewnętrznego naszego przekonania siła ta tkwi w nas. Wkrótce jednak najsmutniejszy wypadek przerwał nasze rozkosze kabalistyczne.","All I can tell you is that not only were we acquiring new messages each day, we were also acquiring new power. Even if we did not dare to use it yet, we were glad, proud that according to our inner conviction, this strength resides in us. Soon, however, the saddest accident interrupted our Kabbalistic delights.","All I can tell you is that every day we acquired not only new knowledge but also a new power, and if we dared not make use of it, at least we had the pleasure of sensing our strength and of being inwardly convinced of it. But our cabbalistic joys were soon cut short by the most woeful of events.","All that I may tell you is that every day we were growing not only in knowledge but also in power.

"- Wszystkie te cuda - rzekła Emina - są dziełem Gomelezów. Wykuli oni tę skałę, gdy byli jeszcze panami kraju, czyli raczej dokończyli pracę zaczętą przez pogan zamieszkujących Alpuharę w chwili ich przybycia. Uczeni utrzymują, że w tym samym miejscu znajdowały się niegdyś kopalnie czystego złota betyckiego, dawne zaś przepowiednie głoszą, że cała ta okolica powróci kiedyś w posiadanie Gomelezów. Co myślisz o tym, Alfonsie? To byłoby piękne dziedzictwo.","""All these miracles,"" said Emin, ""are the work of the Gomelez."" They forged this rock when they were still the masters of the country, or rather finished the work begun by the pagans inhabiting Alpuhara at the time of their arrival. Scholars maintain that the same site was once the site of pure Betite gold mines, and old prophecies say that the entire area will someday return to the Gomeles' possession. What do you think of it, Alfonso? It would be a beautiful legacy.","“All these wonders”, Emina told me, “are the work of the Gomelez. They dug out this rock during the time when they were masters of the area – that is to say, they finished digging it out, for the idolaters who were living in the Alpujarras when they arrived had already done much of the work. Scholars claim that in this very place were the mines that produced the gold native to Baetica, and ancient prophesies predict that one day the whole country is to return to the power of the Gomelez. What do you say to that, Alphonse? Would it not be a fine inheritance!”","‘All these marvels are the work of the Gomelez,’ Emina told me. ‘They excavated the rock when they were the masters of this region, or rather they finished off the excavation, much of which had been undertaken by the heathens who were living in the Alpujarras when the Gomelez invaded. Learned historians claim that this is the site of the mines of virgin gold of classical Baetica, and ancient prophecies predict that the whole region will one day return to the control of the Gomelez. What do you say to that, Alphonse? What a fine inheritance that would be!’"

"Brat kazał otworzyć kratę zamkową, która była zamknięta od czasu mego wyjścia na górę, i oddaliśmy się przyjemności przechadzki. Okolica wydała mi się czarowna, pola połyskiwały najświetniejszymi barwami. Spostrzegłam także w oczach mego brata pewien zapał, odmienny od tego, jaki w nim przedtem gorzał do nauk.

On poszedł marzyć w swoją stronę, ja w moją i powróciliśmy przepełnieni czarownymi myślami.","My brother had the lattice open, which had been locked since I went upstairs, to be opened, and we indulged in the pleasure of a stroll. The area seemed charming to me, the fields glistened with the brightest colors. I also noticed a certain zeal in my brother's eyes, different from what he had been eager to learn before. We ventured into the orange grove. He dreamed his way, I dreamed mine, and we came back filled with dark thoughts.","My brother had the castle gate opened for the first time since my excursion into the mountains. We enjoyed the pleasures of the walk. To my eyes, the countryside seemed enamelled with the most beautiful colours.

"Matka, powróciwszy do domu. natychmiast zaczęła obszywać niebieski kaftan ojca starym żółtym galonem, odprutym od ładownicy jakiegoś munduru. Ojciec, zdziwiony, zapytał o przyczynę, na co opowiedziała mu postępek siostry, której mąż był tak grzeczny, że ubrawszy się w liberię, poszedł za nią do kościoła.

Otworzyłam drzwi do środkowej izby i ujrzałam dwóch wysokich i kształtnych młodzieńców, siedzących przy stole, jedzących. pijących i wyśpiewujących z całego serca. Ubiór ich był wschodni: na głowach mieli turbany, piersi i ramiona nagie, za pasami zaś błyskała im kosztowna broń. Dwaj nieznajomi, których wzięłam za Turków, powstali, podali mi krzesło, napełnili mi talerz i szklankę i znowu zaczęli śpiewać przy towarzyszeniu teorbanu, na którym kolejno przygrywali.","These chants gave me delightful sensations that I could not describe to you.

These two strangers, whom I took for Turks, rose, drew up a chair for me, filled my plate and my glass, and resumed their singing to the accompaniment of a lute, which they took turns to play.

"Tymczasem Trivulcjo usiadł za nimi w ławce, słuchał ich rozmowy i podniecał w sobie zawziętość.

"Na te słowa upadliśmy wszyscy na kolana. Lettereo włożył sobie w kieszenie dwie kule armatnie; myśleliśmy, że chce rzucić się w morze, ale inny był zamiar złośliwego rozbójnika. Na odwietrznej stronie okrętu stała wielka beczka napełniona miedzią. Lettereo schwycił siekierę i przeciął przytrzymujące ją sznury. Natychmiast beczka potoczyła się na brzeg przeciwny, ponieważ zaś okręt był już bardzo pochylony, teraz przewrócił się zupełnie.

Lettereo put two cannonballs in his pockets; we thought he wanted to throw himself into the sea, but the intention of the malicious robber was different.

Immediately the barrel rolled to the far bank, and since the ship was already very leaning, it was now completely overturned. We are all. who were on our knees, we fell on the sails, which, when the ship was going to the bottom, threw us over a dozen cubits due to its elasticity.","We all went down on our knees.

The barrel immediately rolled to the opposite side, and as we were already heeling hard over, it made us completely capsize. First, the rest of us who were on our knees all fell on to the sails, and when the ship sank, these, because of their elasticity, fortunately threw us some distance the other way.","We all knelt down.

One of them carried me in his arms to a table and, placing me on it, said, ‘Comrades, Testalunga’s lieutenant has been killed in the fight and we are at a loss to replace him."

I felt unbearably nauseous and fell senseless.",I am the Wandering Jew. Farewell.,Then I took the cup and drained it at one draught. I felt a terrible pain and lost consciousness.
"Znalazłem się na dachu, usłyszałem raz jeszcze głos majstra, który mnie wołał, ale nie uważałem za potrzebne odpowiadać. Puściłem się z jednego dachu na drugi, dostałem się na dach jakiejś stajni, przed którą stał wóz z sianem, zeskoczyłem z dachu na wóz, z wozu na ziemię i co tchu pobiegłem do klasztoru augustianów. Tam opowiedziałem wszystko mojemu ojcu, który słuchał mnie z wielkim zajęciem, po czym rzekł:","I found myself on the roof, heard once again the voice of the foreman calling me, but I did not think it was necessary to answer. I rushed from one roof to another, got on the roof of some stable, in front of which there was a hay cart, jumped from the roof onto the cart, from the cart to the ground, and ran quickly to the Augustinian monastery. There I told my father, who listened to me with great interest, then said:","When I was on the roof, I heard my master’s voice again, calling for me, but I did not think it wise to reply. I began to run from roof to roof, until I came to the roof of a stable before which stood a haycart. I threw myself from the roof down on to the haycart, and from the haycart to the ground. Then I raced to the Augustinians’ portal, where I told my father everything that had just happened to me.","When I reached the roof I could hear my master ’s voice calling me but thought it inadvisable to reply.

Then I ran all the way to the portal of the Augustinian monastery, where I told my father what had happened."
"Weszliśmy do zamku i wnet podniesiono za nami most zwodzony. Zamek był obszerny i utrzymany w największym porządku, chociaż służba składała się tylko z Mulata i Mulatki w tym samym wieku. Ben Mamun zaprowadził nas naprzód do swojej biblioteki; była to mała, okrągła komnata, służąca zarazem za pokój jadalny. Mulat rozesłał obrus, przyniósł olla podridę i cztery nakrycia, Rebeka bowiem nie siadła z nami do stołu. Pustelnik, udobruchany, jadł więcej niż zazwyczaj. Paszeko, choć nadał ślepy na jedno oko, uspokoił się w swym opętaniu, nie rozchmurzył jednak oblicza i siedział w milczeniu. Ben Mamun smacznie zajadał, ale ciągle był roztargniony i wyznał nam. że wczorajsza przygoda bezustannie krąży mu po głowie. Gdy wstaliśmy od stołu, rzekł:","We entered the castle and a drawbridge was raised behind us. The castle was spacious and kept in the most orderly, although the servants only consisted of a mulatto and a mummy of the same age. Ben Mamun led us forward to his library; it was a small, round chamber that also served as a dining room. The mulatto sent out a tablecloth, brought an olla a scribble and four place settings, for Rebecca did not sit down at the table with us. The hermit, placated, ate more than usual. Pasheko, although he gave the blind one eye, calmed down in his possession, but he did not brighten his countenance and sat in silence. Ben Mamun ate tasty, but he was still distracted and confessed to us. that yesterday's adventure is constantly on his mind. When we got up from the table, he said:","We went inside, and the drawbridge was immediately raised behind us. The castle was quite enormous, and everything seemed to be in the utmost good order. Yet we saw only two servants: a young mulatto, and a mulatto woman of the same age. Ben Mamoun led us first to his library. It was a little rotunda that served also as a dining room. The mulatto came to lay the cloth, brought an olla podrida and four place settings, for the lovely Rebecca did not sit down at table with us. The hermit ate more than usual and also seemed to become more human, while Pacheco, still blind in one eye, seemed no longer to suffer the effects of his possession. However, he was grave and silent. Ben Mamoun ate with considerable appetite, but he seemed preoccupied and confessed to us that his adventure of the day before had given him much to think about. As soon as we had risen from table, he said to us: “My dear guests, here are books to keep you amused, and my black servant will be only too willing to be of service to you in any way.","We went in and the drawbridge was raised behind us.

"Przybywszy tam biała koza nagle przerzuciła się W czarnego kozła. Przeląkłem się na widok tej przemiany i chciałem uciekać ku naszemu mieszkaniu, ale czarny kozioł przeciął mi drogę i wspiąwszy się na tylnych nogach, spojrzał na mnie płomiennymi oczyma. Strach ściął mi lodem krew w żyłach.","Having arrived there, the white goat suddenly turned into a black goat. I was afraid to see this transformation and wanted to run to our apartment, but the black goat cut my way and, climbing up on his hind legs, looked at me with fiery eyes. Fear chilled my blood in my veins.","When we reached it, the white she-goat turned into a black billy-goat. This transformation terrified me, and I tried to run back to our house, but the black goat blocked my path, and then rearing up on his hind legs and staring at me with his blazing eyes, he instilled such fear in me that I was frozen to the spot.","When we reached the edge the white nanny-goat turned into a black billy-goat.

This continued for a while; at last it struck midnight and I saw Satan enter with fiery horns and a fiery tail carried by several devils behind him.,"So we came to some vast caverns, which seemed to be inhabited, but everyone was fast asleep. We went into a stable. The two hanged men knelt before the goat that licked the tips of their noses. Then they shed their dreadful countenance and appeared to me as two young Moorish ladies of astonishing beauty.","I tried to call out but could not make a sound. This lasted some time, then a bell struck midnight and soon after I saw a demon come in with fiery horns and a flaming tail, which was carried behind him by a number of little imps."
"- To ja, Kamilla, twoja macocha, drżę z zimna Drogi Paszeko, zrób mi miejsce pod kołdrą. Po chwili drugi głos przerwał:","- It's me, Kamilla, your stepmother, I'm shivering from the cold Dear Pashka, make room for me under the covers.

Make room for me under your blanket.” Then another little voice said: “And this is Inesille.","I am cold, dear heart. Let me join you under your blanket.’ Then another little voice said, ‘I am Insilla."
"Cóż ci więcej powiem, Alfonsie; głos ich brzmiał melodią, która unosiła duszę przez wszystkie odcienie uczucia, a gdy wzruszenie dochodziło do najwyższego stopnia, niespodziewane dźwięki nagle powracały szaloną wesołość. Jednakże nie dałam się obłąkać tym pozorom: spoglądałam bacznie na mniemanych żeglarzy i zdawało mi się, żem znalazła w nich nadzwyczajne podobieństwo z boskimi moimi bliźniętami.","What more can I tell you, Alphonsus; their voice sounded like a melody that lifted the soul through all shades of feeling, and when the emotion reached its highest degree, unexpected sounds suddenly returned to madness. However, I did not go mad by these appearances: I looked closely at the supposed sailors, and it seemed to me that I found in them an extraordinary resemblance to my divine twins.","Their songs had a melodiousness that led the soul through every shade of feeling, and when one had reached the extremity of tenderness, unexpected strains in the music brought the listener back to the craziest merriment. I was not taken in by this ploy. I carefully studied the supposed sailors, and thought I saw a close resemblance between them, and a strong likeness to my divine Gemini.","What can I say, Alphonse? Their songs had tunes which drew from the soul every nuance of feeling. Just when they had moved you almost to extremes of tenderness, an unexpected twist in the music would restore you to the most wanton merriment. I was not fooled by this performance. On inspecting these bogus sailors closely it struck me that they were remarkably like each other and remarkably like my own divine twins."

"Bardzo byłem ciekawy dowiedzieć się, co diabli poczęli z moim koniem, którego zostawiłem w Venta Quemada; ponieważ zaś droga tamtędy mi wypadała, postanowiłem wstąpić do gospody. Musiałem piechotą przebyć całą dolinę Los Hermanos oraz następną, w której znajdowała się venta, i tak byłem zmęczony, żem z niecierpliwością oczekiwał chwili, w której odzyskam mego konia. W istocie, znalazłem go w tej samej stajni, gdziem go wczoraj zostawił. Dzielny mój gniadosz nie stracił zwykłej wesołości, a po połysku jego skóry poznałem, że ktoś pilne miał o nim staranie. Nie mogłem pojąć, kto się tym zajmował, ale tyle już widziałem nadzwyczajnych rzeczy, że nie warto się było nad tą jedną długo zastanawiać. Byłbym natychmiast puścił się w drogę, gdyby mi nie była przyszła chętka raz jeszcze obejrzeć gospodę. Znalazłem izbę, w której się naprzód położyłem, ale pomimo najusilniejszych poszukiwań nie mogłem wyszukać komnaty, gdzie poznałem piękne Mauretanki. Znudziły mnie te próżne przepatrywania kątów, dosiadłem więc konia i udałem się w dalszą podróż.","I was very curious to know what the hell they had done to my horse I had left at Venta Quemada; as the road was clear for me that way, I decided to stop by the inn. I had to walk all the valley of Los Hermanos and the valley that had the venta there, and I was so tired that I was eagerly awaiting the moment when I would get my horse back. In fact, I found him in the same stable where I left him yesterday. My brave bay had not lost its usual gaiety, and by the sheen of its skin I knew that someone was urgent about him. I couldn't understand who was doing it, but I've already seen so many extraordinary things that it wasn't worth considering for a long time. I would have gone on my way immediately, if I had not had any desire to see the inn again. I found a room in which I first lay down, but despite my most strenuous search, I could not find a room where I met beautiful Moorish women. I was bored with these vain gaze at angles, so I mounted my horse and continued my journey.","I was extremely curious to know what the evil spirits had done with my horse, which I had left at Venta Quemada, and since in any case it was on my way, I determined to go by there. I had to walk the whole length of the Los Hermanos valley and that of the Venta, which did not fail to tire me and to make me greatly wish to find my horse. I did indeed find it; it was in the same stable where I had left it and seemed groomed, well cared for, and well fed. I did not know who could have taken this trouble, but I had seen so many extraordinary things that this in addition did not for long detain me. I would have set off straight away, had I not had the curiosity to visit the inside of the tavern once more. I relocated the bedroom where I had slept, but no matter how hard I looked, I could not find the room where I had seen the beautiful African women. I tired then of looking for it any longer. I mounted my horse and continued on my way.","I was very eager to find out what those devils of the previous evening had done with my horse, which I had left at the Venta Quemada. As the inn was on my way, I decided to pass by. I had to walk the full length of the valley of Los Hermanos and that of the venta itself, which duly tired me out and made me dearly hope to find my horse again, as indeed happened. It was in the same stable where I had left it and seemed frisky, in good shape and recently groomed. I had no idea who could have looked after the animal, but I had seen so many extraordinary things that this did not preoccupy me for long. I should have set out immediately on my journey if I had not been curious to search the inn one more time. I found the room in which I had slept, but however much I looked I could not find the one in which I had seen the two beautiful African girls. I grew tired of the search after a while, mounted my horse and continued on my journey."
"Trivulcjo był pyszny i zepsuty przez los, ale duszę miał tkliwą; zgryzoty sumienia zemściły się za nieszczęśliwe ofiary. Tułał się od miasta do miasta i pędził życie w rozpaczy.

Zmienił się tak dalece, że własna mamka nie mogła go poznać.","Trivulcjo was delicious and spoiled by fate, but his soul was tender; griefs of conscience took revenge for the unfortunate victims.

He had changed so much that his own mother could not recognize him.","Trivulce was arrogant, spoiled by wealth, but he had a sensitive soul.

"Nazajutrz posiliłem się resztkami owej wieczerzy w Los Alcornoques i na wieczór przybyłem do Venta Quemada. Nie zastałem jeszcze ojca, ale ponieważ wyraźnie kazał mi czekać na siebie, zgodziłem się na to tym chętniej, że znalazłem obszerną i wygodną gospodę. Oberżysta, który ją trzymał, niejaki Gonzalez z Murcji, dobry człowiek, choć wielki paliwoda, obiecał mi sporządzić wieczerzę godną granda pierwszej klasy. Podczas gdy ją przyrządzał, udałem się na przechadzkę nad brzegi Gwadalkwiwiru, a wróciwszy, istotnie znalazłem, że wieczerza nie jest bez zalet.","The next day I ate the remnants of that supper at Los Alcornoques, and came to Venta Quemada for the evening. I did not find my father yet, but as he clearly told me to wait for himself, I agreed to it all the more readily as I found a spacious and comfortable inn. The innkeeper who was holding her, a man named Gonzalez of Murcia, a good man but great fuel, promised to make me a supper worthy of a first-class gang. While he was preparing it, I went for a stroll to the shores of Guadalquivir, and on my return, I did find that the supper was not without merit.","The next day I dined at Los Alcornoques on what I had saved from the day before, and that same evening I reached Venta Quemada. I did not find my father there, but as he had instructed me in his letter to wait for him, I determined to do so, all the more willingly since I was in a roomy and comfortable hostel. The innkeeper who ran it at that time was a certain Gonzalez of Murcia, quite a decent fellow although a big-talker, who, sure enough, promised me a supper worthy of a Spanish grandee. While he busied himself preparing it, I went for a stroll along the banks of the Guadalquivir, and when I returned to the hostel, there I found a supper that was indeed not at all bad.","The next day I had a midday meal at Los Alcornoques, consisting of what I had kept from the night before, and arrived that same evening at the Venta Quemada.

"Tymczasem brat mój, pełen miłości i nadziei, więcej niż kiedykolwiek oddawał się pracy nad naukami tajemnymi. Pewnego dnia przyszedł do mnie i rzekł, że niezawodne znaki, które spostrzegł na niebie, oznajmiły mu, iż sławny adept od dwustu lat zamieszkujący piramidę Sufisa udaje się do Ameryki i że dwudziestego trzeciego naszego miesiąca tybi, o siódmej godzinie i czterdziestej drugiej minucie będzie przejeżdżał przez Kordowę. Tegoż wieczora poszłam do obserwatorium i stwierdziłam, że miał słuszność, ale rachunek mój dał mi nieco odmienny wynik. Brat obstawał przy swoim dowodzeniu, ponieważ zaś nie zwykł zmieniać zdania, chciał sam jechać do Kordowy. ażeby mnie przekonać, że nie on, lecz ja byłam w błędzie.","Meanwhile, my brother, full of love and hope, devoted himself more than ever to work on the secret sciences.

That evening I went to the observatory and decided that he was right, but my calculation gave me a slightly different result. The brother insisted on his command, and because he was not in the habit of changing his mind, he wanted to go to Cordova himself. to convince me that it was not him but I was wrong.","Meanwhile, filled with love and hope, my brother devoted himself more than ever to the study of the occult sciences.

"Oparła się szczerze na moim ramieniu i przybyliśmy do starego naczelnika, który przyjął Żydówkę z oznakami głębokiego szacunku. Przez cały dzień Rebeka postępowała z wielką naturalnością i zdawała się zapominać o tajemnych naukach. Gdy nad wieczorem brat jej przybył, odeszli razem, ja zaś udałem się na spoczynek. Ległszy w łóżku, rozmyślałem jeszcze nad opowiadaniem Rebeki, ale ponieważ pierwszy raz w życiu słyszałem o kabale, o adeptach i o znakach niebieskich, nie mogłem wynaleźć żadnego stanowczego zarzutu i w tej niepewności zasnąłem.","She leaned sincerely on my shoulder and we came to see the old warden who received the Jewish woman with signs of deep respect. Throughout the day, Rebecca was acting with great naturalness and seemed to be forgetting the secret teachings. When her brother arrived in the evening, they departed together, and I went to sleep. Lying in bed, I thought about Rebecca's story, but since I had heard about Kabbalah, the adepts and the celestial signs for the first time in my life, I could not come up with any firm objection, and I fell asleep in this uncertainty.","These reflections, as anyone will appreciate, persuaded me to await resolutely the sequel to the adventures for which I was destined. The reader will learn what happened next if the first part of my story is well received.","She boldly leant on my arm, and we soon rejoined the old gypsy chief, who greeted the Jewess with many marks of respect.

Once there, I thought again about Rebecca’s story. I think it was the first time I had heard talk of the cabbala, of genii, and of celestial signs."
"Przez cały czas Ben Mamun opowiadał mi o swojej uczonej siostrze, tak że spodziewałem się ujrzeć jakąś Medeę z czarnym włosem, z laską czarodziejską w ręce. mruczącą niezrozumiałe, kabalistyczne wyrazy. Zawiodłem się w moich oczekiwaniach. Zachwycająca Rebeka, która nas przyjęła u bramy zamkowej, była najrozkoszniejszą, najbardziej czarującą blondynką, jaką można sobie wyobrazić. Piękne złote włosy opadały jej z naturalnym wdziękiem na ramiona; śnieżysta suknia, spięta zapinkami nieocenionej wartości, spływała luźno po jej uroczej kibici. Zdawało się z powierzchowności, że mało dba o strój; wszelako, gdyby nawet było przeciwnie, nie mogłaby powabniej podnieść uroku czarownych wdzięków.","All the time Ben Mamun told me about his learned sister, so I expected to see some Medea with black hair and a magician's staff in her hand. purring incomprehensible, kabbalistic words. I was disappointed in my expectations. The delightful Rebecca who welcomed us at the castle gate was the loveliest, most charming blonde girl imaginable. Beautiful golden hair fell naturally gracefully over her shoulders; a snow-covered dress, fastened with clasps of invaluable value, ran loosely down her lovely fan. On the surface, it seemed that he cared little for his outfit; nevertheless, even if it were to the contrary, she could not more charmingly lift the charm of enchanting charms.","On the way Ben Mamoun talked to me a great deal about his learned sister, and I was expecting to see some black-haired Medea, with a wand in her hand, muttering spells, but this conception of her was completely false. The amiable Rebecca who welcomed us at the castle entrance was the kindest and most appealing blonde anyone could possibly imagine. Her lovely golden hair fell naturally to her shoulders and she was nonchalantly dressed in a white robe – although the clasps that fastened it were priceless. Her outward appearance proclaimed a person who never gave any thought to what she wore, but it would have been difficult to improve upon the result by giving it more.","On the way, ben Mamoun had spoken a great deal to me about his learned sister, and I expected to meet a black-haired Medea with a wand in her hand, muttering some incomprehensible words under her breath.

"Śród nocy rozbudził mnie dźwięk zegara, bijącego północ. Po tej przygrywce czekałem na ukazanie się jakiegoś ducha i przygotowałem się na odpędzenie go, gdyż w ogóle są to przykrzy i nieproszeni goście.

Miał zaledwie stopę wysokości i nie tylko jego szaty były błękitne, ale nawet twarz, broda, pulpit i księga. Poznałem natychmiast, że nie jest to duch, ale geniusz dwudziestego siódmego stopnia. Nie wiedziałem, jak się nazywa, i wcale go dotąd nie znałem. Jednakże użyłem formuły, której powszechnie wszystkie duchy ulegają. Natenczas mały błękitny rabinek zwrócił się do mnie i rzekł:","In the middle of the night I was awakened by the sound of the clock chiming midnight. After this prelude, I waited for a ghost to show up and prepared to chase it away, since they are generally unpleasant and uninvited guests. During these preparations, I suddenly saw a strong light on the table in the center of the room, then a little blue rabbi appeared. who began to prostrate before the lectern, as rabbis used to do in prayer. He was only a foot tall, and not only were his robes blue, but even his face, beard, lectern, and book. I knew immediately that this was not a ghost but a twenty-seventh degree genius. I didn't know his name, and didn't know him at all. However, I used a formula that all ghosts generally succumb to. Then the little blue rabbi turned to me and said:","In the middle of the night I was awakened by a bell that rang twelve times.

He stood no more than a foot high, and not only were his clothes blue but even his face, his beard, his lectern and his book. I soon realized that this was no ghost but a genie of the twenty-seventh order. I did not know his name and I was not at all familiar with him. However, I used a formula that has some power over all spirits in general. Then the little sky-blue rabbi turned to me and said: “You began your calculations backwards, and that is why the daughters of Solomon appeared to you feet first.","In the middle of the night I was woken by a bell which tolled twelve times.

He was no more than one foot tall, and not only his clothing but also his face, his beard, his desk and his book were all blue. I soon realized that he was not a ghost but a genie of the twenty-seventh order. I did not know his name and had never come across him before.

"- Nieszczęsny nazarejczyku - powtórzył znowu szejk Gomelezów - wypij duszkiem napój zawarty w tej czarze lub zginiesz haniebną śmiercią, a trup twój, zawieszony między zwłokami braci Zota, stanie się pastwą sępów i igraszką duchów ciemności, które go będą używały do swoich piekielnych przemian.","'Poor Nazarene,' repeated the Sheikh Gomelez, 'gulp down the drink contained in this goblet or you will die a shameful death, and your corpse, suspended among the corpses of the Zot brothers, will become the prey of the vultures and the plaything of the spirits of darkness who will use it for their hellish transformations.",You will find there a man alseep and you will wake him.”,"‘Miserable Nazarene,’ continued the Sheikh of the Gomelez, ‘drink at a single draught the liquid contained in this cup or you will die a shameful death and your body will hang between those of Zoto’s brothers; it will be prey to the vultures and the plaything of the infernal spirits who will use it for their diabolical charades.’"

The hours that are ours to spend together are too precious to devote to story-telling. We cannot be your wives unless you adopt our holy law. But it is permitted for you to see us in your dreams.

"Lettereo. który miał nieprzezwyciężoną skłonność do rozbojów morskich, byłby bez wątpienia dalej prowadził swoje rzemiosło, gdyby nie przedstawiono mu w Livomo innych możliwości, którym dał pierwszeństwo. Pewien Żyd, nazwiskiem Natan Levi, zauważywszy. że papież i król neapolitański ciągną niezmierne zyski z bicia miedzianej monety, chciał także należeć do tych korzyści. W tym celu kazał sfabrykować zaczną ilość takich pieniędzy w pewnym mieście angielskim zwanym Birmingham. Gdy zamówiony towar był już gotowy, Żyd osadził swego faktora we Flariola, wiosce rybackiej położonej na granicy obu państw, Lettereo zaś zobowiązał się do przewożenia i wyładowywania towaru.","Lettereo. who had an invincible propensity for maritime robberies, would undoubtedly have continued his craft had it not been for him in Livomo other possibilities, which he had given priority. A certain Jew named Natan Levi noticed. that the Pope and King of Neapolitan were making immeasurable profits from minting a copper coin, he also wanted to be among those benefits. To this end, he had an amount of such money fabricated in a certain English city called Birmingham. When the ordered goods were ready, the Jew placed his agent in Flariola, a fishing village on the border of the two countries, and Lettereo undertook to transport and unload the goods.","Lettereo, who had a marked taste for piracy, would doubtless have attempted other ventures of this kind; but at Leghorn a new commerce was suggested to him, to which he gave his preference. Having observed that the Pope and the King of Naples made large profits from their copper coinage, a Jew named Nathan Levi also wanted to share in this gain. This is why he had similar coins made, in a town in England called Birmingham. When he had a certain quantity, he placed one of his agents in La Flariola, a fishing village situated on the border between the two states, and Lettereo undertook to transport and unload the merchandise there.","Lettereo had a marked taste for piracy and would doubtless have continued to engage in similar enterprises, but at Livorno he was offered the opportunity of engaging in a different kind of trade, one that he preferred.

So he had counterfeit coins struck in an English town called Birmingham, and when there was a sufficient quantity he set up an agent in La Lariola, a fishing village on the border of the two states.

"Brat mój mógł uskutecznić swoją podróż w tak krótkim czasie, jakiego potrzebuję na powiedzenie ci tych słów, ale chciał użyć przyjemności przechadzki i udał się przez góry, wybierając drogę, gdzie piękne widoki zapowiadały mu najwięcej rozrywki. Tym sposobem przybył do Venta Quemada. Kazał sobie towarzyszyć temu samemu duchowi, który ukazał mi się w jaskini, i polecił mu przynieść sobie wieczerzę. Nemrael porwał ucztę przeorowi benedyktynów i zaniósł ją do Venty. Następnie brat mój, nie potrzebując już Nemraela, odesłał go do mnie.","My brother could have made his journey in as little time as I need to say these words to you, but he wanted to use the pleasure of a stroll, and he went over the mountains, choosing the path where the beautiful views promised him the most entertainment.

"Okropny zakrystian postawił latarnię na wielkim ołtarzu i pozapalał świece jak do nieszporów; następnie zaczął zamiatać kościół i okurzać ławki, przeszedł nawet kilka razy obok Trivulcja, ale nie zdawał się go spostrzegać. Nareszcie zbliżył się do drzwi zakrystii i jął dzwonić w sygnaturkę; na ten dźwięk podniosły się grobowce, wyszli umarli, owinięci w całuny, i na posępną nutę zawiedli litanie.","The terrible sacristan put a lantern on the great altar and lit candles as at vespers; then he began sweeping the church and clearing the pews, even walking past Trivulcio a few times, but did not seem to notice him. At last he approached the sacristy door and began to ring the bell; at this sound the tombs rose, the dead came out, wrapped in shrouds, and at a gloomy note they failed the litanies.","The ghastly sacristan placed his lantern on the high altar and lit the candles as though for vespers. Then he began to sweep the church and to dust the pews. Several times he even passed close to Trivulce, but seemed not to see him. Finally he went to the door of the sacristy and rang the little bell that always hangs there. Then the tombs opened, the dead appeared wrapped in their shrouds and started singing litanies in very melancholy tones.","The ghastly sacristan put his lantern down on the high altar and lit the candles as though for vespers.

"W tym roku chciałem znowu rozpocząć przerwaną pracę, gdy dowiedziałem się, że sławny adept ma właśnie przejeżdżać przez Kordowę. Sprzeczka, jaką miałem z tego powodu z moją siostrą, skłoniła mnie do odwiedzenia go. Spóźniłem się nieco z wyjazdem z domu i na wieczór stanąłem zaledwie w Venta Quemada. Znalazłem gospodę opuszczoną z powodu duchów, które ją nawiedzały; ponieważ jednak wcale się ich nie lękam, rozgościłem się w jadalnej izbie i rozkazałem małemu Nemraelowi, aby mi przyniósł wieczerzę. Nemrael jest to mały geniusz bardzo niskiego stopnia, którego używam do podobnych posyłek, i on to właśnie przyniósł twój list z Puerto-Lapiche. Poszedł do Andujar, gdzie nocował jakiś przeor benedyktynów, porwał mu bez. ceremonii wieczerzę i przyniósł mi ją do gospody. Wieczerza składała się z pasztetu z kuropatw, który znalazłeś jeszcze nazajutrz z rana. Byłem jednak tak znużony, że zaledwie się jej dotknąłem: odesłałem więc Nemraela do mojej siostry, a sam położyłem się spać.","This year I wanted to start my interrupted work again, when I learned that the famous student was about to pass through Cordova. The disagreement I had with my sister over this prompted me to visit him. I was a bit late with my departure from home and for the evening I stopped only in Venta Quemada. I found an inn abandoned because of the ghosts that haunted it; but since I have no fear of them at all, I made myself at home in the dining room and commanded little Nemrael to bring me a supper. Nemrael is a very low-level little genius that I use for similar mailings, and this is what he brought your letter from Puerto-Lapiche. He went to Andujar, where a Benedictine prior was staying overnight, kidnapped him without. supper ceremony and brought it to me to the inn. Supper consisted of the partridge pate you found the next morning. But I was so weary that I barely touched her: so I sent Nemrael to my sister and went to sleep myself.","This year I was preparing to start again, when I learned that a famous practitioner of the art was to pass by Cordoba. A discussion I had with my sister about him persuaded me to go and see him on his way through. I left a little late and that day got no further than Venta Quemada. I found this inn deserted for fear of ghosts, but since I do not fear them, I made myself comfortable in the dining room, and ordered little Nemrael to bring me some supper.

"- Czy nie lepiej byłoby, jaśnie wielmożny panie, aby zamiast tego wszystkiego można było przekonać syna Waszej Miłości, że nie ma na świecie ani widm, ani upiorów, ani umarłych, którzy śpiewają litanie. Tym sposobem bez wątpienia nie drżałby na ich wspomnienie.","- Wouldn't it be better, my lord, that instead of all this one could convince the son of Your Love that there are no ghosts in the world, no ghosts, no dead people who sing litanies. That way, he would undoubtedly not tremble at the memory of them.","“My lord, if I were to make so bold as to offer Your Excellency my advice, it would be to prove to your dear son that there are no ghosts, or spectres, or dead men that sing litanies, and that there cannot be any.

"Słońce jeszcze niezupełnie zaszło i korzystałem z ostatnich jego promieni, aby obejrzeć to mieszkanie, prawdę mówiąc, nie tyle dla zabezpieczenia się przeciw potęgom piekielnym, jak raczej dla wynalezienia jakiejś żywności, gdyż ta drobnostka, którą znalazłem był w Los Alcomoquea, zaledwie na chwilę mogła wstrzymać, ale nigdy zaspokoić głodu, jaki mnie trawił. Przeszedłem przez kilka izb i obszernych komnat. Większą część zdobiła mozaika do wysokości człowieka, sufity zaś pokrywały wspaniałe rzeźby, jakimi przed laty słusznie szczycili się Maurowie. Zwiedziłem kuchnie, poddasza i piwnice - te ostatnie wykute były w skale, niektóre z nich łączyły się z podziemiami, które zdawały się daleko w głąb gór przedłużać - ale posiłku nigdzie znaleźć nie mogłem. Wreszcie, gdy poczęło się zmierzchać, poszedłem po konia, który dotąd stał przywiązany na podwórzu, zaprowadziłem go do stajni, gdziem spostrzegł wiązkę siana, sam zaś udałem się do izby, gdzie stało nędzne łóżko, jedyne posłanie, jakie zostawiono w całej gospodzie. Pragnąłem zasnąć, ale nadaremnie, a tu jak na przekorę nie tylko jadła, ale i światła nie mogłem wynaleźć.","The sun hadn't quite set yet, and I was using the last rays of it to inspect this apartment, in fact, not so much to protect myself against the powers of hell as to invent some food, for this little thing I found was in Los Alcomoquea only for a moment could withhold, but never satiate my hunger. I passed through several rooms and large chambers. Most of it was decorated with human-height mosaics, and the ceilings were covered with the magnificent sculptures that the Moors rightly boasted years ago. I visited kitchens, attics and cellars - the latter were carved in the rock, some of them connected with the underground, which seemed to extend far into the mountains - but I couldn't find a meal anywhere. Finally, when it was getting dark, I went to get the horse that had been tied up in the yard, and led him to the stables, where I saw a bundle of hay, and went myself to the room where there was a poor bed, the only bed left in the whole inn. I wanted to fall asleep, but in vain, and here, in spite of not only eating, but also light, I could not invent.","Since the sun was just setting, I wanted to take advantage of the remaining light to examine every nook and cranny in this building, less to relieve myself of anxiety regarding the infernal powers that had taken possession of it than to search for food, for the little I had eaten at Los Alcornoques had served to allay but not to satisfy the imperative need I felt of some sustenance. I walked through many rooms and chambers. Most were covered with mosaics to the height of a man, and the ceilings were of that fine carpentry in which the Moors displayed their magnificence. I visited the kitchens, the attics and the cellars – these were carved out of the rock, a few communicated with underground passages that seemed to penetrate deep into the mountain – but nowhere did I find anything to eat. Finally, as daylight was completely fading, I went to fetch my horse, which I had tied up in the courtyard. I led it to a stable where I had seen a little hay, and I went to settle down for the night in a room where there was a pallet, the only one left in the whole inn. I would have very much liked to have a light, but the good thing about the hunger tormenting me was that it prevented me from sleeping.","As the sun had only just set, I wanted to take advantage of the fading light to explore all the hidden recesses of the building, less to reassure myself about any infernal powers which might have seized possession of it than to look for food, for the little I had eaten at Los Alcornoques had dulled but not satisfied the great hunger which I then felt. I passed through many rooms and apartments. Most were decorated with mosaic up to the height of a man; the ceilings were fashioned in that beautiful panelling which is the splendour of Moorish buildings. I searched the kitchens, store-rooms and cellars, which were hewn out of the solid rock. Some were connected to underground passages which appeared to lead far into the mountain. But nowhere did I come across any food. Eventually, as the last light was fading from the sky, I went to fetch my horse, which I had tethered in the courtyard, and led it to a stable in which I had seen some hay. I myself settled down in the room in which was the only pallet bed left in the whole inn. I would very much have liked to have had a light, but the one good thing about the hunger which still tormented me was that it prevented me sleeping."

"Wzięła mnie za rękę i zaprowadziła do karety, która nie była już tak zamknięta jak wczorajsza, i gdyby noc nie była tak ciemna, byłabym mogła dokładnie widzieć cały Lyon. ale tak zauważyłam tylko, że jedziemy gdzieś bardzo daleko. Wkrótce minęliśmy mury miasta i zatrzymaliśmy się przy ostatnim domu przedmieścia. Na pozór była to zwyczajna chata, strzechą nawet pokryta, ale wnętrze jej całkiem było odmienne, jak się sam o tym przekonasz, jeżeli mały Murzynek nie zapomniał drogi, widzę bowiem, że wystarał się o światło i zapalił latarnię.","She took my hand and led me to the carriage, which was not as closed anymore as it was yesterday, and if the night had not been so dark, I would have been able to see all of Lyon clearly. but so I only noticed that we are going somewhere very far. Soon we passed the city walls and stopped at the last house in the suburbs. It seemed to be an ordinary hut, even with a thatched roof, but its interior was completely different, as you will see for yourself, if the little negro did not forget the way, because I can see that he had obtained light and had lit a lantern.","“She took me by the hand again, without saying a word, and ushered me into a carriage, which was not closed as the first had been, and I would certainly have been able to see the town from this one, but it was after dark and I saw only that we travelled some distance, some considerable distance – so far in fact that we eventually came to the countryside on the very edge of town. We stopped at the last house on the outskirts. It was just a hut from the outside, and it even had a thatched roof, but it was pretty inside, as you will see, if the little black fellow knows his way, for I see he has found some light and is relighting his lantern.”","‘Silently she took me by the hand and led me down to a carriage which was not closed as was the first, so that from it I could have seen the town, but it was after dark and all I saw was that we went very far and came eventually to a stretch of countryside on the very edge of town.

"Nazajutrz, spojrzawszy w zwierciadło, spostrzegłam stojące za sobą dwie ludzkie postacie. Obróciłam się, alem nic nie ujrzała; rzuciłam znowu wzrok na zwierciadło i znowu ten sam obraz mi się przedstawił. Zjawisko to wcale nie było straszne. Widziałam dwóch młodzieńców, których postać nieco przewyższała zwykły wzrost ludzki. Barki ich były szerokie i nieco zaokrąglone, jak u kobiet; piersi także miały kobiece kształty; poza tym jednak niczym nie różnili się od mężczyzn. Wytoczone ramiona wspierali na biodrach, w postawie, jaką widzimy w posągach egipskich; błękitnozłote włosy spadały im w pierścieniach na barki. Nie mówię już o rysach ich twarzy: możesz sobie wyobrazić piękność półbożków, gdyż w istocie były to bliźnięta niebieskie, poznałam je po małych płomykach połyskujących nad ich głowami.","The next day, looking at the mirror, I saw two human figures standing behind me. I turned around but saw nothing; I glanced at the mirror again, and again the same image introduced itself to me. This phenomenon was not at all terrible. I saw two young men whose form was slightly higher than normal human height. Their shoulders were broad and somewhat rounded, like that of women; the breasts were also feminine; but otherwise they were no different from men. They rested their arms on their hips, in an attitude we see in Egyptian statues; their blue-gold hair fell in rings over their shoulders. I'm not talking about the features of their faces anymore: you can imagine the beauty of the demigods, for they were actually blue twins, I recognized them by the little flames glittering above their heads.","The next day, looking into my mirror, I saw two human figures that seemed to be standing behind me.

They were high-chested, like a woman, but with a manly breast. Their arms, rounded and perfectly formed, lay against their sides in the manner of Egyptian statues. Their hair was gold and azure, and fell in heavy tresses on their shoulders. I will say nothing of their facial features – you can imagine how beautiful demi-gods are. For these were indeed the Celestial Twins. I recognized them by the little flames that burned over their heads.","The next morning Zulica brought my mirror and in it I caught sight of two human forms which seemed to be behind me.

Their torso was also feminine in form but they did not have breasts. Their arms, plump and perfectly shaped, were resting at their sides in the posture that Egyptian statues have. The heavy curls of their blue and gold hair fell down to their shoulders. I will not describe their faces to you.

Immediately afterwards, there was a knocking at the door and a kind of bleating of a goat. I took my sword, went to the door, and called out in a strong voice:","I fell asleep and was woken by the midnight chimes of a bell. Soon afterwards I heard a knock at the door and what sounded like the bleating of a goat. I took my sword, went to the door, and said in a firm voice: “If you are the devil, try to open this door, for the hermit has locked it.”","I was still looking for reasons to justify my cousins and continue to love them when I heard midnight strike. Soon after, I heard a knock at the door and what sounded like the bleating of a goat.

"W kościele, gdzie nie wolno było twarzy płaszczem zakrywać, kochankowie mogli byli łatwo spostrzec, że Trivulcjo ich ściga, ale tak dalece zajęci byli miłością, że nawet nie uważali na mszę, co, prawdę mówiąc, wielkim jest grzechem.","In a church where it was forbidden to cover the face with a cloak, the lovers could easily see that Trivulcio was chasing them, but they were so preoccupied with love that they did not even pay attention to the Mass, which, in fact, was a great sin.","Once inside the church, where it is not permitted to hide one’s face in one’s cloak, the two lovers could easily have seen that Trivulce was following them, but they were solely engrossed in their love, to which they gave more thought than to the Mass.","They went into the church, where it is not permitted to cover your face with a cloak, and the two lovers might easily have noticed Trivulzio following them had it not been for the fact that they could only think of their love for each other to the exclusion even of the Mass, which is a great sin."
"Weszliśmy do przeklętej venty i znaleźliśmy w jadalnym pokoju stół zastawiony pasztetem z kuropatw i dwoma butelkami wina. Kabalista zdawał się być przy wybornym apetycie: przykład jego dodał mi odwagi. inaczej bowiem wątpię, czy byłbym odważył się podnieść co do ust. Wszystko to. co od kilku dni widziałem, tak pomieszało moje wyobrażenia, że sam nie wiedziałem, co czynię, i gdyby się kto uwziął, byłby mógł wprowadzić mnie w wątpliwość o moim własnym istnieniu.","We entered the goddamn venta and found a table in the dining room piled high with partridge pate and two bottles of wine. The Kabbalist seemed to have a delicious appetite: his example gave me courage. otherwise I doubt whether I would have dared to raise the point of my mouth. All that. what I had seen for the last few days had so confused my ideas that I did not know what I was doing, and if anyone had taken care of it, he would have doubted my own existence.","We duly entered the inauspicious Venta and found in the dining room a table laid for a meal, with a pheasant pâté and two bottles of wine.","So we went into that terrible venta, and in the dining room we found a table ready laid, on which there was a partridge pâté with two bottles of wine. The cabbalist seemed to have a healthy appetite and he encouraged me by his example. If he had not, I do not think that I could have brought myself to eat anything, for all that I had seen over the last few days had so perplexed my mind that I no longer knew what I was doing, and if anyone had tried they could have made me doubt my own existence."
"Ciemność ogarniała moją komnatę, ale przez szczeliny drzwi ujrzałam światło w pokoju Zulejki. Posłyszałam jej westchnienia i sądziłam, że jest chora. Powinnam była ją zawołać, ale nie uczyniłam tego. Nie wiem, jaka nieszczęsna płochość sprawiła, żem znowu pobiegła do dziurki od klucza. Ujrzałam Tanzai i Zulejkę, oddających się swawoli, która przejęła mnie przerażeniem; zaćmiło mi się w oczach i padłam zemdlona.","Darkness enveloped my room, but through the cracks in the door, I saw a light in Zulejka's room. I heard her sighs and thought she was sick. I should have called her, but I didn't. I don't know what unfortunate timidity made me run to the keyhole again. I saw Tanzai and Zuleica indulging in frolics that terrified me; My eyes became dim and I fell faint.","My room was in darkness, and I saw from the chinks round the door that Zulica had a light on in her room. I heard her moan and thought she was ill. I ought to have called out to her; I did no such thing. I do not know what guilty impulse made me resort again to looking through the keyhole. I saw the mulatto Tanzai taking liberties with Zulica that so horrified me my blood ran cold, my eyes closed and I fell into a faint.","It was dark in my bedroom but I saw through the chink in the door that there was a light in Zulica’s room. I heard her moan and thought that she was ill. I should have called to her but I did not. I cannot say what guilty, rash impulse led me to resort again to the keyhole. I saw Tanzai the mulatto taking liberties with Zulica’s person that froze me with horror. My eyes closed and I fell down in a faint."
"- Wstrzymaj się pan na chwilę - rzekł Francuz - mniemam, że to wcale nie moi pocztylioni wyprzedzili pańskich, ale przeciwnie, pańscy, wlokąc się niedbale, pozostali w tyle.","'Hold on for a moment,' said the Frenchman, 'I suppose it was not my postmen who overtook yours but, on the contrary, yours, trailing carelessly, remained behind.","“Just a moment,” said the Frenchman. “As I see it, it was not that my postilions overtook yours, but that yours, by going more slowly, lagged behind.”","‘One moment,’ said the Frenchman. ‘It seems to me that it was not my postilions who overtook yours but rather yours who by lingering fell behind mine.’"
"- Wejdź, mój synu, czym prędzej, nie przepędzaj nocy pod gołym niebem, strzeż się pokus, gdyż Pan odsunął od nas swoją prawicę.","- Come in, my son, as soon as possible, do not spend the night in the open, beware of temptation, for the Lord has removed his right hand from us.","“Come in, my son. Quickly. Do not spend the night outside. Fear the temptor. The Lord had withdrawn his hand from above us.”","‘Come in, my son. Do not linger! Do not spend the night outside! Beware of the tempter!

"W istocie, przyszły wcześniej niż zazwyczaj i na domiar mego szczęścia spostrzegłem, że trzymają swoje pasy w rękach. Symboliczną wymowę tego gestu łatwo było zrozumieć, wszelako Emina, nie ufając mojej domyślności, rzekła:","In fact, they came earlier than usual, and to my luck I found them holding their belts in their hands. The symbolic significance of this gesture was easy to understand, however, not trusting my guesswork, Emin said:",I hoped to see them again in my bedroom and to be more successful in dispelling their melancholy.,"They came back earlier than usual, and to my great delight carried their belts in their hands. The meaning of this gesture was not difficult to grasp. Emina took the trouble to explain it to me."
"Pochodzę ze starożytnej rodziny, która jednak nie obfitowała w znakomitych mężów, a jeszcze mniej w dostatki.

"Gdyby nie pomyślano o rozkrojeniu chleba, nigdy nie udałoby mi się go napocząć.

My hands were tied artificially so that I did not experience any pain and soon fell asleep.","Had it been whole, I should not have been able to bite into it. I also found a jug, but it was impossible to drink from it. Hardly had I wet my throat when all the water poured away. I carried my explorations further: I found some straw in a corner and lay down on it. My hands were skilfully tied – in other words, very tightly – but without hurting me. So it was that I had no difficulty in falling asleep.","If it had been whole I would not have been able to bite into it. I found the jug of water too but was not able to drink from it.

"Bianka nie tylko była rozpustna, chciwa złota i zepsuta w głębi serca, ale nadto wymagała zawsze, aby jej kochankowie zniżali się do niej hańbiącymi postępkami. Pewnego dnia zażądała od Landolfa. aby zaprowadził ją na wieczerzę do swej matki i siostry. Landolfo natychmiast poszedł do matki i oświadczył Jej ten zamiar, jak gdyby nic w tym nie widział nieprzyzwoitego. Biedna matka zalała się łzami i zaklinała syna, aby miał wzgląd na dobrą sławę siostry. Landolfo pozostał głuchy na te prośby i przyrzekł tylko dochować ile możności tajemnicy, po czym poszedł i przyprowadził Biankę do domu. Matka i siostra Landolfa przyjęły niegodziwą daleko lepiej, niż na to zasługiwała; ale Bianka widząc ich dobroć, podwoiła jeszcze zuchwałość, zaczęła rozprawiać o nieprzyzwoitych rzeczach i dawać siostrze swego kochanka nauki, bez jakich ta byłaby się zupełnie obeszła. Nareszcie wyprawiła obie z pokoju, mówiąc, że chce zostać z Landolfem sama.","Not only was Bianka debauched, greedy for gold, and corrupt in her heart, but she always demanded that her lovers descend to her with disgraceful deeds. One day she demanded from Landolf. that he would lead her to supper to his mother and sister. Landolfo immediately went to his mother and told Her this intention, as if he saw nothing indecent about it. The poor mother burst into tears and exhorted her son to consider his sister's good fame. Landolfo remained deaf to these requests and promised only to keep as much secret as possible, after which he went and brought Bianca home. Landolf's mother and sister had received the wicked one far better than she deserved; but Bianka, seeing their goodness, doubled her audacity, began to talk about indecent things and to give her lover's sister lessons which she would have completely disposed of. At last she sent both of them out of the room, saying that she wanted to be alone with Landolf.","Bianca was not only licentious, self-seeking, depraved, but she also wanted her lovers to perform for her deeds that brought them dishonour, and she demanded of Landulphe that he should take her home with him every evening to dine with his mother and sister. Landulphe immediately went to his mother and put this proposal to her, as though it were the most respectable thing in the world. His good mother burst into tears and beseeched her son to consider his sister’s reputation. Landulphe was deaf to her pleas and promised only to keep the matter as secret as he could. Then he went to fetch Bianca and brought her to the house. Landulphe’s mother and sister made the prostitute more welcome than she deserved. But seeing their goodness, Bianca became twice as brazen. She made some very suggestive remarks at supper, and gave her lover’s sister lessons she would gladly have done without. Finally Bianca made it clear to the sister, and to her mother, that they would do well to leave the room, because she wanted to be alone with Landulphe.","Bianca was not only debauched, grasping and depraved, but she also required that her lovers should commit dishonourable acts to please her. And in Landulpho’s case she demanded that he take her home with him every evening to eat supper with his mother and sister. Landulpho at once went to his mother and told her what was proposed as though it was the most respectable thing in the world. This good soul burst into tears and implored her son to think of the effect of this on his sister’s reputation. Landulpho was deaf to her entreaties and only undertook to keep the affair as secret as possible. Then he went to fetch Bianca and brought her home with him. His mother and sister received the prostitute much better than she deserved. Seeing their kindness, she became all the more insolent. During supper she made outrageously suggestive remarks and offered advice to her lover’s sister which she could have well done without. Eventually she made it clear to both daughter and mother that they would do well to withdraw because she wanted to be alone with her lover."
"Nareszcie ocknąłem się naprawdę. Słońce paliło mi powieki i z trudem zdołałem je podnieść. Ujrzałem niebo, znajdowałem się więc na wolnym powietrzu, ale sen ciążył mi jeszcze na oczach. Nie spałem już, a jednak nie byłem zupełnie rozbudzony. Okropne obrazy przesuwały się przed moim umysłem. Trwoga mnie zdjęła. Zerwałem się nagle i usiadłem.","I finally woke up for real. The sun was burning my eyelids and I could barely lift them. I saw the sky, so I was in the open air, but sleep was still heavy on my eyes. I was no longer sleeping, and yet I was not completely awake. Terrible images passed before my mind. The fear took me off. I jumped up suddenly and sat down.","Eventually I really did awaken. The sun was burning my eyelids. I opened them with difficulty. I saw the sky. I saw that I was out in the open. But my eyes were still heavy with sleep. I was no longer sleeping, but I was not yet awake. A succession of images of torture passed through my mind. I was appalled by them. Jerked out of my slumber, I sat up…","When at length I awoke, the sun was burning my eyelids. I could scarcely open them. I saw the sky and I saw I was in the open air. But my eyes were still heavy with sleep. I was not really asleep but neither was I properly awake. Images of torture flashed through my mind one after the other. Terror took hold of me. I rose with a start and sat up."
"Wprawdzie była to także kradzież, ale Testa-Lunga sumiennie rozdzielał wszystko między towarzyszów, zachowując dla siebie tylko tyle, ile mu było niezbędne do życia. Mało tego: skoro przeciągał przez jaką wioskę, kazał za wszystko płacić podwójnie, tak że w krótkim czasie stał się bożyszczem ludu Obojga Sycylii.","It was also a theft, but Testa-Lunga diligently distributed everything among his companions, keeping to himself only as much as was necessary for his life. Not only that: since he was dragging through which village, he ordered to pay double for everything, so that in a short time he became the idol of the people of both Sicily.","It was still stealing, but Testalunga shared everything with his companions and kept nothing for himself beyond what was absolutely essential. On the contrary, if he went through a village, he paid double for everything, so much so that in a short time he became the idol of the people of the Two Sicilies.","It was still stealing, but Testalunga shared everything with his companions and kept back for himself only what he absolutely needed. On the other hand, whenever he passed through a village he paid twice the proper price for everything, so that he soon became the idol of the people of the two Sicilies."
"Lettereo wyróżniał się okazałą postawą, sam wzrost i szerokie bary dostatecznie odznaczały go śród tłumu; cóż dopiero, gdy reszta powierzchowności tak dokładnie odpowiadała rodzajowi jego zatrudnień, że ludzi nieco lękliwych przenikał na jego widok dreszcz trwogi. Twarz jego mocno ogorzałą oczernił jeszcze wystrzał prochu armatniego; prócz tego osmoloną skórę ozdobił różnymi dziwacznymi rysunkami.","Lettereo stood out for his imposing posture, the sheer height and broad shoulders distinguished him enough from the crowd; well, only when the rest of his superficiality matched the nature of his employment so precisely that people who were a little fearful would shudder at the sight of him. His severely weathered face was blackened by the shot of gunpowder; besides, he decorated his blackened skin with various bizarre drawings.","Finally, he cut a truly imposing figure. His size and build alone would have sufficed to draw attention, but all the rest of his outward appearance was so much in keeping that people of a fearful disposition did not lay eyes on him without a rush of fear. His face, already a very dark brown, had been made even darker by a blast of gunpowder, which had left a lot of marks on it, and his brownish-grey skin was heavily wrought with various very unusual designs.","He was indeed an impressive figure of a man. His great chest and shoulders alone would have set him apart from others. But the rest of his appearance was so singular that timid souls could not look on him without feeling a surge of fear. His deeply bronzed face was made darker still by the scorch marks of gunpowder, which had left many small scars, and his sallow skin was decorated with many strange designs."

Okryty byłem przymilaniami, pochlebstwami i zadowolony z siebie i z drugich.","Zibeld, who had not disturbed her sister how many times the conversation was about serious matters, took away her rights when there was a moment of affection. I was covered with pleasures, flattery and pleased with myself and with others.","Zibedde, who willingly let her sister talk when the conversation was serious, reclaimed that privilege when it took a sentimental turn. In short, I was flattered, gratified, pleased with myself and with others.","Zubeida, who was willing to let her sister speak when the subject of conversation was serious, reclaimed her rights when it took a sentimental turn.

I would sleep with her. this is how this wine warmed me.","So it was that young Thibaud, raising his voice and swearing his customary oath, said: “As Satan is my witness, I pledge my body and soul to the devil that if the great she-devil his daughter were to pass by, I would woo her, so hot has the wine made my blood.”",and I had my way with her. For this wine has made my blood hot.’
"Tu odwaga we mnie wstąpiła, zamknęłam księgę i utopiłam wzrok w oczach moich boskich kochanków. Chwila tego zapomnienia mogła mnie drogo kosztować. Zbyt wiele jeszcze było we mnie ludzkiej natury, ażebym mogła znieść tak bliskie z nimi zetknięcie. Płomień, błyskający w ich oczach, o mało mnie nie spalił. Spuściłam wzrok i przyszedłszy nieco do siebie, jęłam czytać dalej. Właśnie trafiłam na drugą pieśń, w której wieszcz opisuje miłostki synów Elohima z córkami ludzi. Niepodobna dziś wyobrazić sobie sposobu, jakim kochano w pierwszych wiekach świata. Czytając te jaskrawe opisy, często zacinałam się, nie mogąc zrozumieć słów poety. Wtedy oczy moje mimowolnie zwracały się ku zwierciadłu i zdawało mi się, że widzę, jak Thoamimowie z coraz większą rozkoszą słuchają mego głosu. Wyciągali do mnie ramiona i zbliżali się do mego krzesła. Roztaczali świetne skrzydła u ramion; spostrzegłam również lekkie drżenie tych, które mieli u bioder. W obawie, że je rozwiną, zakryłam dłonią oczy i w tej chwili uczułam na niej pocałunek, równie jak na drugiej, którą trzymałam na księdze. Wtedy nagle usłyszałam, jak zwierciadło pęka na tysiąc drobnych kawałków. Zrozumiałam, że słońce wyszło ze znaku Bliźniąt, które tym sposobem zasyłały mi pożegnanie.","Here courage entered me, I closed the book and drowned my eyes in the eyes of my divine lovers. The moment of forgetting it could cost me dearly. There was still too much of my human nature to bear such close contact with them. The flame flashing in their eyes nearly burned me. I lowered my gaze and, recovering a bit to myself, continued to read. I just came across the second song in which the bard describes the loves of the sons of Elohim with the daughters of men. Today it is impossible to imagine the way people were loved in the first centuries of the world. Reading these vivid descriptions, I often stuttered, unable to understand the poet's words. Then my eyes turned involuntarily to the mirror, and I thought I saw the Thoamim listening to my voice with increasing delight. They extended their arms to me and approached my chair. They spread great wings on their shoulders; I also noticed a slight tremor in their hips. Fearing that they would unfold them, I covered my eyes with my hand, and at that moment I felt a kiss on her, as well as on the other one I kept on the book. Then suddenly I heard the mirror break into thousand tiny pieces. I realized that the sun came from the sign of Gemini, which was thus sending me goodbye.","Then I grew bolder. I shut my book and met the gaze of my divine lovers. This momentary abandonment nearly cost me dear. There was still too much humanity in me to be able to withstand such intimate communication. The celestial flame that burned in their eyes almost consumed me. I lowered my gaze, and having recovered myself somewhat, I continued with my reading. But it so happened that the poem I turned to was the second canticle, in which this first among poets describes the amours between the sons of Elohim and the daughters of men. It is impossible today to imagine the way they loved in the world’s first age. Such extremes of loving, which I did not properly understand, often made me hesitate. At those moments my eyes turned despite themselves to the mirror, and I thought I saw the Thamim take increasing pleasure in this reading. They held out their arms to me; they came close to my chair. I saw them unfold the lustrous wings on their shoulders. I even discerned a slight quiver in the wings that served to gird them. I thought they were going to unfold these as well, and I covered my eyes with my hand. In the same instant I felt a kiss upon it, as well as on the hand that held my book. And also in the same instant, I heard the mirror shatter into a thousand pieces. I realized that the sun had left the sign of Gemini and that they had taken leave of me.","I then grew bolder. I shut my book, and looked into the eyes of my divine lovers. This moment of abandonment nearly cost me dear. I was still too close to common humanity to be able to endure such intimate communication. The heavenly flame which shone in their eyes threatened to consume me. I lowered my gaze and, when I had recovered a little, continued to read aloud. But I happened to turn to the second canto in which this poet of poets describes the loves of the sons of Elohim for the daughters of mortals. Today it is impossible to imagine the ways of love in the first age of the earth. The exaggerated descriptions which I scarcely understood made me hesitate again and again. At those moments my eyes were instinctively drawn to the mirror and I thought that I could see the Thamim taking an increasingly great pleasure from the reading. They stretched out their arms to me and came close to my chair. I saw the shining wings at their shoulders unfold and even detected a slight fluttering in those which girded them. I thought that they were going to spread these too and covered up my eyes with my hand. Just then I felt a kiss on that hand and on the other, which held the book. Also at the same instant I heard the mirror shatter into a thousand pieces. I realized that the sun had left the sign of Gemini and that they had taken their leave of me in this way."
"Całą podróż aż do Lyonu odbył jak najspokojniej, ale wyjechawszy z Lyonu końmi pocztowymi, wyprzedzony został przez powóz, który, daleko lżej wyładowany, pierwszy przybył do stacji. Niebawem mój ojciec zajechał także przed dom pocztowy, gdzie ujrzał, że u powozu, który go wyprzedził, zmieniano już konie. Natychmiast wziął szpadę i zbliżywszy się do podróżnego, prosił o udzielenie mu chwilki rozmowy na osobności. Podróżny, jakiś pułkownik francuski, widząc mego ojca w generalskim mundurze, aby mu nie uchybić, także przypasał szpadę. Weszli obaj do gospody położonej naprzeciw domu pocztowego i zażądali osobnego pokoju. Gdy znaleźli się sami, mój ojciec tymi słowy odezwał się do podróżnego:","He made the whole journey as smoothly as possible as far as Lyons, but on leaving Lyon on postal horses, he was overtaken by a carriage, which, unloaded much easier, first arrived at the station. Soon my father drove up in front of the post office, where he saw that the horses that had overtaken him had already been changed. Immediately he took his sword and, approaching the traveler, asked for a moment of private conversation with him. A traveler, a French colonel, seeing my father in a general's uniform, so as not to offend him, also wore an sword. They both entered an inn opposite the post office and asked for a separate room. When they found themselves alone, my father spoke these words to the traveler:","His journey as far as Lyons was clouded by no untoward event; but as he left this town with post horses, he was overtaken by a chaise which, being lighter, reached the post house first. My father, who arrived a moment later, saw that horses were already being harnessed to the chaise. He at once took up his sword, and approaching the traveller, asked if he might speak to him for a moment in private. Seeing that my father wore the uniform of a general officer, the traveller, who was a French colonel, also took up his sword to do him honour. They went into an inn that stood opposite the post house and asked for a room. When they were alone, my father said to the other traveller: “Good sir, your chaise overtook my coach so as to reach the post house before me.","As far as Lyon his journey was not troubled by any untoward incident. But on leaving that town with his post horses he was overtaken by a chaise which, being lighter, arrived at the post house before him. Reaching there a few minutes later, my father noted that the horses were already being harnessed to the carriage. He at once took up his sword and, going up to the traveller, asked him for the honour of a brief conversation. The traveller, who was a colonel in the French army, saw that my father was wearing the uniform of a general officer and also took up his sword out of respect for his rank. They went into the inn, which was across the road from the post house, and asked for a room. When they were alone my father said to the traveller, ‘Señor, your carriage overtook mine and arrived at the post house before me."
"Aż do wstąpienia na tron Karola pokój trwał w naszych górach nieprzerwanie. Sefi Gomelez był wtedy szejkiem. Człowiek ten z niewiadomych przyczyn doniósł cesarzowi, że odkryje mu ważną tajemnicę, jeżeli Karol zechce przysłać w Alpuhary jakiego znakomitego Hiszpana, w którym pokłada całe zaufanie. Zanim dwa tygodnie upłynęło, don Ruiz z Toledo jako poseł cesarski stawił się u Gomelezów, ale znalazł szejka nieżywego. Zamordowano go w wilię przyjazdu posła. Don Ruiz zaczął prześladować kilka osób, ale wnet, znudzony próżnymi usiłowaniami, powrócił na dwór cesarski.","Until the accession to the throne of Charles, peace remained uninterrupted in our mountains. Sefi Gomelez was a sheikh at the time. This man, for unknown reasons, informed the emperor that he would discover an important secret to him, if Charles wished to send to Alpuhara some great Spaniard in whom he trusted. Before the two weeks had passed, Don Ruiz of Toledo, as imperial envoy, appeared with the Gomelezes, but found the sheikh dead. He was murdered on the arrival of the envoy. Don Ruiz began to persecute several people, but soon, bored with vain endeavors, he returned to the imperial court.","Thereafter, peace reigned on our mountains, until Charles came to the throne. At that time our Sheikh was Sefi Gomelez. This man, for motives that have never been clear, informed the new emperor that he would reveal to him an important secret if he would send to the Alpujarras some lord in whom he trusted. Before the fortnight was out, Don Ruiz of Toledo presented himself to the Gomelez on behalf of His Majesty, but he found that the Sheikh had been murdered the previous day. Don Ruiz persecuted a few individuals, soon tired of the persecutions, and returned to Court.","Peace then reigned in our mountains until Charles V came to the throne.17 At that time our sheikh was Sefi Gomelez, who for reasons which have never been well understood sent word to the new emperor that he would reveal to him an important secret if he were to dispatch to him a trustworthy nobleman. Within fifteen days Don Ruiz de Toledo presented himself to the Gomelez in His Majesty’s name, only to discover the sheikh had been murdered the day before.

"Chociaż mały głupiec często zapewne widział już w swoim życiu kominiarzy, tym razem jednak wziął mnie za diabła. Ukląkł, złożył ręce i zaczął mnie prosić, abym go ze sobą nie porywał, przyrzekając, że będzie grzeczny. Byłbym może dał się zmiękczyć tymi oświadczeniami, ale trzymałem w ręku moją kominiarską miotłę, pokusa użycia jej była zbyt silna; nadto, aczkolwiek zemściłem się już za uderzenie książką do nabożeństwa i w pewnej części za rózgi, to jednak pozostała w pamięci chwila, gdy Principino kopnął mnie nogą w twarz, mówiąc: ""Managia la tua facia de banditu"". Zresztą każdy neapolitańczyk zawsze woli wymierzyć zemstę raczej nieco większą, aniżeli odrobinę mniejszą, niżby należało.","Although the little fool has probably seen chimney sweeps in his life a lot, this time he took me for a hell. He knelt, folded his hands, and begged me not to take him with me, promising to be polite. I might have been softened by these statements, but I was holding my chimney sweep broom, the temptation to use it was too strong; moreover, although I had already avenged my revenge for being struck with a prayer book and in part for the rods, the moment when Principino kicked me in the face with his foot, saying: ""Managia la tua facia de banditu"" remained in my memory. Anyway, every Neapolitan always prefers to take revenge a little more than a little less than it should be.","Although the little fool had doubtless seen other chimney-boys, he took it into his head to mistake me for the devil. He fell to his knees and begged me not to carry him off, promising to be good. His pleas might well have moved me, but I was holding in my hand my little chimney-sweep’s broom, and the temptation to make use of it had grown too strong. Besides, I had certainly been avenged for the blow the Principino had given me with his prayerbook, and in part for the beating with birch rods, but the kick in the face he had given me, with the words “Managia la tua facia de banditu”, still rankled. And after all, a Neapolitan likes to take a little more vengeance rather than a little less.","Although the little fool had probably seen chimney sweeps before, he took it into his head to take me for the devil.

"To podstępne doniesienie wymyślił Pepo, który już od czterech dni krążył koło brzegów. Lettereo dał się zwieść, wiatr sprzyjał, sądził więc, że może przedsięwziąć jeszcze jedną podróż, i rozwinął żagle. Nazajutrz o świcie ujrzeliśmy się pośród eskadry Pepa, złożonej z dwóch galiot i tyluż skampawii. Zewsząd byliśmy otoczeni, bez żadnego sposobu ucieczki. Padro-nowi śmierć wyglądała z oczu, rozpiął wszystkie żagle i kazał sterować prosto na główną galiotę. Pepo stał na moście i wydawał rozkazy, zamierzając przychwycić nasz statek. Lettereo porwał strzelbę, wziął go na cel i strzaskał mu ramię. Wszystko to stało się w kilku sekundach.","This insidious report was invented by Pepo, who had been circling the shores for four days. Lettereo was deceived, the wind favored him, so he thought he might take another voyage, and unrolled the sails. The next day, at dawn, we saw each other amid Pep's squadron, consisting of two galleries and as many scampavia. We were surrounded on all sides, with no way of escaping. The Padro-new death looked out of sight, he unfastened all the sails and ordered the steering straight to the main galley. Pepo was standing on the bridge giving orders to intercept our ship. Lettereo grabbed the rifle, took it on target, and shattered his arm. It all happened in seconds.","This false warning was simply a ruse on the part of Pepo, who had already been at sea for four days. Lettero was taken in by it. The wind was favourable, he thought he could make another voyage, and set sail. The next day, at dawn, we found ourselves in the midst of Pepo’s flotilla, composed of two galiots and two scampavies. We were surrounded, there was no way of escape. Lettereo was staring death in the face. He spread every sail and set his course on the captain’s vessel. Pepo was on the bridge, issuing orders for boarding. Lettero picked up a shotgun, took aim, and hit him in the arm. All this happened in a matter of a few seconds.","This false rumour was a trick on the part of Pepo, who had been at sea for four days. Lettereo fell for it. The wind was favourable. He reckoned that he could make one more journey and so set sail. At daybreak on the next day we found ourselves in the midst of Pepo’s flotilla, comprised of two galiots and two light vessels known as scampavie. We were surrounded, with no means of escape. With death in his heart, Lettereo broke out all sails and set a course for Pepo’s vessel. Pepo was on the bridge, giving orders to board our ship.

"Na ten straszny widok odszedłem prawie od zmysłów; wyskoczyłem z łóżka, rzuciłem się przez okno i zacząłem uciekać w pole. Przez chwilę mniemałem, żem uciekł szczęśliwie od tych wszystkich okropności, ale obróciwszy się spostrzegłem, że wisielcy gonili za mną. Puściłem się coraz prędzej i wkrótce zostawiłem upiory daleko za sobą. Ale radość moja niedługo trwała.

"Przyrzekłem mówić o Testa-Lundze i dotrzymam wam słowa. Przyjaciel mój byt spokojnym mieszkańcem Val Castera, małego miasteczka położonego u stóp Etny. Miał żonę zachwycającej piękności. Młody książę Vał Castera, zwiedzając pewnego razu swoje majątki, ujrzał tę kobietę, gdy przyszła powitać go wraz z żonami znaczniejszych mieszczan. Zarozumiały młodzieniec, zamiast wdzięcznie przyjąć hołd, jaki mu składali jego poddani ustami piękności, zajął się tylko wdziękami pani Testa-Lunga. Bez żadnych ogródek wyjawił jej wrażenie, jakie sprawiła na jego zmysłach, i wsunął jej rękę za stanik. W tej samej chwili mąż, który stał za żoną, dobył noża. z kieszeni i utopił go w sercu młodego księcia.

The young prince Val Castera, while visiting his estates, saw this woman when she came to greet him along with the wives of major townspeople. The conceited young man, instead of gratefully accepting the homage that his subjects paid him with the lips of the beauties, concerned himself only with the charms of Mrs. Testa-Lung. The backyard gave her the impression it made on his senses without any notice, and he slipped her hand behind his bra. At the same time, the husband who was standing behind his wife drew his knife. out of his pocket and drowned it in the heart of the young prince. It seems to me. that in his place any honest man would have done the same to himself.","I promised to tell you about Testalunga – I am going to be as good as my word.

Far from being duly appreciative of his vassals’ tribute offered to him at Beauty’s hands, the presumptuous young man had no thought but for the charms of Signora Testalunga. He told her bluntly the effect she had on his senses, and put his hand inside her corset. Her husband was at that moment standing behind his wife. He drew a knife from his pocket and plunged it into the young Prince’s heart.

Tym gorzej dla ciebie; widzę, że muszę sam cię naprowadzić na dobrą drogę. Czy znasz dwie afrykańskie księżniczki, czyli raczej dwie niegodziwe czarownice, wiedźmy przebrzydłe, diablice wcielone? Nic nie mówisz? - niech więc wprowadzą te dwie infantki z dworu Lucyfera.","- Dear, beloved son, thank Heaven for bringing you to this prison. But what reason have you given for this? what sin have you committed? Confess, in tears and humility, seek relief in my womb. You do not answer - unfortunately, my son, you are evil, you are doing very badly. We, according to our system, do not question the culprit. We leave him the freedom to accuse himself. Such a confession, however forced, has its good side, especially when the guilty one deigns to name accomplices. Are you still silent? So much the worse for you; I can see that I must guide you on the right path myself. Do you know two African princesses, or rather two wicked witches, ugly witches, incarnate devils? You're not saying anything? - let them bring in the two infanta of the court of Lucifer.","The inquisitor had a chair brought for him, sat next to me, assumed a mild and ingratiating air, and spoke to me more or less in these words: “My dear child, give thanks to heaven that led you to this cell. But tell me, why are you here? What sin have you committed? Make your confession, shed your tears on my breast… You do not answer me? Alas, my child, in this you are at fault… We do not interrogate, that is not our method. We leave it to he who is guilty to accuse himself. This confession, although somewhat forced, is not without merit, especially when the guilty man denounces his accomplices. You do not answer? So much the worse for you… Well, we shall have to set you on the right path. Are you acquainted with two princesses from Tunis? Or rather, two infamous witches, execrable vampires and devils incarnate? You say nothing. Have the two infantas of Lucifer’s court sent in!”","‘My dear child, my sweet child, thank heaven for having brought you to this dungeon. But tell me, why are you here? What sins have you committed? Confess. Pour out your tears on my breast. What? No reply? Alas, my child, you are wrong. We do not practise interrogation, that is not our method. We allow the guilty party to accuse himself. Such a confession, if somewhat forced, is not without value, especially if the guilty party denounces his accomplices. What? No reply? So much the worse for you! We will have to set you on the right path. Do you know two princesses from Tunis or rather two infamous witches, two execrable vampires, two demons incarnate? You still remain silent. Have the two infantas of Lucifer’s court brought in.’"
"W istocie, wkrótce potem lekki płomyk zabłysnął na ognisku kuchennym. Gdy nieco się rozjaśniło, otworzyłem oczy i ujrzałem już nie Kamillę i Inezillę, ale dwóch braci Zota, wiszących w kominie.","In fact, shortly thereafter, a light flame flashed on the kitchen fire. When it lightened up a bit, I opened my eyes and saw not Kamilla and Inezilla anymore, but two Zota brothers hanging in the chimney.","Sure enough, soon after I saw flames in the kitchen hearth. The flames became brighter and I saw not Inesille and Camille but Zoto’s two brothers, hanging in the fireplace.",And indeed a moment later I saw a flame appear in the kitchen hearth. It gradually grew brighter and I was able to make out not Insilla and Camilla but Zoto’s two brothers hanging in the fireplace.
To mówiąc pochylił głowę na prawe ramię i wyrzekł kilka wyrazów rozkazującym głosem. W pięć minut później upadł na stół wielki list pod moim adresem. Rozpieczętowałem go i przeczytałem co następuje:,"As he spoke, he bent his head to his right shoulder and spoke a few words in a commanding voice. Five minutes later a large letter for me fell on the table. I opened it and read the following:",But after a moment’s reflection he began with these words:,He then turned his head towards his right shoulder and uttered a few words in a commanding tone. Five minutes later a thick letter addressed to me fell on the table in front of our very eyes. I opened it and read as follows:
"Zmiana ta niesłychanie mnie uszczęśliwiła, gdyż nowy mój stan zdawał mi się daleko szlachetniejszy niż wyskrobywanie kominów. Uściskałem ojca i braci i wesoło udałem się z padronem na jego okręt. Przybywszy na pokład, Lettereo zebrał swoich dwudziestu marynarzy, których postacie wybornie odpowiadały jego powierzchowności, przedstawił mnie tym panom i odezwał się tymi słowy:","This change made me extremely happy, because my new condition seemed much more noble than scraping chimneys. I hugged my father and brothers and happily went with the padron to his ship. On arriving on board, Lettereo gathered his twenty seamen, whose figures corresponded perfectly to his appearance, introduced me to these gentlemen, and spoke these words:","As for me, I was delighted, for my new job seemed to me a nobler one than cleaning chimneys. I embraced my father and my brothers, and cheerily set off with Lettereo to join his ship. When we were aboard, the captain called together his crew, consisting of twenty men, whose faces were pretty much a match for his own.","For my part I was delighted, since my new profession seemed to me more noble than cleaning chimneys. I kissed my father and brothers goodbye and cheerfully set off with Lettereo to join his ship. When we had boarded her the padron called together his crew, which numbered twenty men all similar in appearance to him."
"Pójdę w jej ślady i zarzucę zasłonę na dalszy ciąg tej sceny. Wystarczy wiedzieć, że moje przyjaciółki zostały moimi małżonkami. Istnieją bez wątpienia sytuacje, kiedy gwałt, powodując rozlew niewinnej krwi, jest zbrodnią; ale istnieją też takie wypadki, w których okrucieństwo służy samej niewinności, pozwalając się jej ujawnić w całym blasku. Tak właśnie było z nami, z czego wniosłem, że moje kuzynki nie były rzeczywistymi uczestniczkami moich snów w Venta Quemada.","I will follow in her footsteps and throw a veil over the rest of this scene. It is enough to know that my friends became my spouses. There are undoubtedly situations in which rape, causing innocent bloodshed, is a crime; but there are also cases in which cruelty serves innocence itself, making it manifest in all its splendor. This was the case with us, and I concluded that my cousins were not actually participants in my Venta Quemada dreams.","I refused to do so. Then mindful that they were Muslims and that an object revered by Christians might hurt their feelings, I weakened and agreed. I took off the little reliquary; but then I felt a qualm of conscience and at once seized it back again. Then came the sound of a cry, and the lamp went out, leaving me in darkness.","I shall do as she did and draw a veil over the rest of this scene. You need only know that my charming companions became my wives. There are doubtless cases where it is a crime violently to shed innocent blood, but there are others where such cruelty enhances innocence by making it appear in all its lustre. That is what happened to us. And I am led to conclude that my cousins played no real part in my dreams at the Venta Quemada."
"Ojciec zgodził się na wszystko i po długim kołowaniu przybył nareszcie z nieznajomym do zamku. Wprowadzono go do środka i odwiązano mu oczy. Wtedy ujrzał zamaskowaną kobietę, z zakneblowanymi ustami i przywiązaną do fotela. Starzec rzekł do niego:","My father agreed to everything, and after a long taxi he arrived at the castle with the stranger. He was led inside and was blindfolded. Then he saw a masked woman, gagged in her mouth and tied to an armchair. The old man said to him:","My father agreed to everything, and after a fairly long stretch and several twists and turns, they reached the old nobleman’s castle. He was taken inside and his blindfold removed. Then he saw a masked woman, tied in a chair and gagged. The old man said to him: “Signor Zoto, here is another one hundred sequins.","My father agreed to this, and after a long ride and several detours they all arrived at the old gentleman’s castle. He was led up the steps and his blindfold was removed. He then saw a masked and gagged woman tied to a chair. The old gentleman said to him, ‘Signor Zoto, here are a hundred more sequins."
"Gdy Zoto odszedł, piękna Emina rzekła z wyrazem głębokiego smutku:","After Zoto passed away, the beautiful Emin said with an expression of deep sadness:","Zoto withdrew, and the lovely Emina said with sadness in her voice:","* Zoto withdrew, and fair Emina said in a sad voice, ‘That man is quite right."
Na te słowa oprawcy porwali mnie za nogi i położyli między dwie deski.,"At these words, the torturers grabbed me by the legs and put me between two boards.",The torturers took my legs and tied them between the planks.,The torturers grabbed hold of my legs and fastened them between the boards.
"- Nikczemna, ponieważ kochasz się w rozbójniku, oto masz, na co zasługujesz! To mówiąc uderzył ją w twarz.","""Wicked because you love a highwayman, here's what you deserve!"" With that he slapped her in the face.","With that, he slapped her face.","Seeing that you are in love with a bandit, this is what you deserve.’"
niż poczucie honoru.,than a sense of honor.,All the cut-throats that belonged to it vied with one another in their praise for so scrupulously keeping his word.,"I replied that the story of Zoto’s father reminded me of the words that a certain hermit had uttered to me two days earlier, namely that there were surer foundations for virtue than a sense of honour."
- Mylisz się - rzekł Zoto - jest to wejście do mego pałacu.,"""You are wrong,"" said Zoto, ""this is the entrance to my palace.""","“Well,” said Zoto, “you are mistaken, for it is the entrance to my palace.”","‘Well,’ said Zoto, ‘you are wrong, for it is the entrance to my palace.’"
"- Senor kawalerze, znajdziesz tu olla podridę, złożoną z mięs wszelkiego rodzaju oprócz jednego, gdyż my jesteśmy wierne, czyli, wyraźniej mówiąc, muzułmanki.","- Senor cavaliers, you will find here the ollaopodidę, composed of all kinds of meat but one, because we are faithful, that is, more clearly, Muslim women.","We sat down at table, and passing me a porcelain bowl, the same lady said: “Noble sir, you will find here an olla podrida, composed of all kinds of meats, one only excepted, for we count ourselves among the Faithful, by which I mean Muslims.”","We sat down to table; the same lady moved an oriental bowl towards me and said, ‘Señor caballero, you will find in here an olla podrida9 containing all sorts of meat with one exception, for we are of the number of the faithful, that is to say, we are Muslims.’"
"- Twoja osoba nader nas zajmuje - mówiła dalej Mauretanka - ale może mniej ci to będzie pochlebiać, gdy się dowiesz, że jesteś pierwszym mężczyzną, jakiego w życiu spotykamy. Dziwią cię moje słowa i zdajesz się powątpiewać o ich prawdzie. Obiecałam ci opowiedzieć historię naszych przodków, ale zapewne lepiej będzie, gdy zacznę od własnej.","“Your person is very occupied with us,” the Mauritanian continued, “but it may be less flattering to learn that you are the first man we ever meet. You are surprised by my words and you seem to doubt their truth. I promised you to tell you the story of our ancestors, but I might be better off starting with my own.","“We take great interest in you,” said the beautiful Moor, “but perhaps you will be less flattered by this when you know that you are the first man we have ever seen. What I say amazes you, and you seem to doubt it. I had promised you the story of our ancestors, but perhaps it would be better if I began with our own story.”","‘We take a deep interest in you,’ the Moorish beauty replied. ‘But you may well be less flattered when you learn that you are practically the first man we have ever met. What I have just said has astonished you, and you seem to doubt it. I promised to tell you the story of our ancestors; perhaps it would be better if I began with our own.’"
"Nareszcie sen zaczął tłoczyć powieki pięknych Mauretanek i oddaliły się do siebie. Zostawszy sam, pomyślałem, że byłoby mi bardzo nieprzyjemnie, gdybym nazajutrz znowu obudził się pod szubienicą. Roześmiałem się z tej myśli, ale ciągle chodziła mi po głowie, dopókim nie zasnął.","At last the dream began to press the eyelids of the beautiful Moorish women and they moved away from each other. Having been left alone, I thought that it would be very unpleasant for me to wake up again the next day under the gallows. I laughed at the thought, but it kept going on in my head until he fell asleep.","All the cut-throats that belonged to it vied with one another in their praise for so scrupulously keeping his word. I assure you this deed is still, as it were, on everyone’s lips, and that it will talked of in Benevento for a long time to come.","At last, sleep weighed down the pretty eyelids of my cousins and they went back to their own apartments. When I was alone, the thought struck me that it would be very unpleasant to wake up under the gallows again. I laughed this thought away but it still occupied my mind till the moment I fell asleep."

"Tybald. zachwycony prostotą tego opowiadania, brał się znowu do umizgów, gdy wtem Murzynek przyniósł zapaloną latarnię, której światło padło na twarz Tybalda.","Tybald. enchanted by the simplicity of this story, he began to go to the fugitives again, when the negro brought a lighted lantern, the light of which fell on Tybald's face.","Charmed by the innocence of this account, Messire Thibaud was about to reply with some pretty speech when the little black fellow came up with his lighted lantern, illuminating Thibaud’s face.","Messire Thibaud was charmed by the naivety of this account and was about to make a gallant reply when the little black servant came back with his lighted lantern. As its light fell on Thibaud’s face, Orlandine exclaimed, ‘What do I see?"

"Gdy zbliżała się do kościoła, żebracy zaczęli krzyczeć na cale gardło we właściwym im narzeczu.:","As she approached the church, the beggars started screaming at the whole throat in their proper dialect:","When she came near the church, the beggars hooted and jeered, and shouted after her in their argot: “Mira Lunardu che fa lu criadu de sua mugiera!”","As she approached the church, the beggars hooted and jeered and shouted out in their dialect, ‘Mira Lunardu che fa"
"W kilka dni potem ojciec udał się do Monaldiego i powiedziawszy mu, że leszczynowa różdżka nie poskutkowała, polecił się przyjaźni dzielnych towarzyszów, o których ten mu wspomniał. Monaldi w te słowa mu odrzekł:","A few days later, my father went to see Monaldi and, telling him that the hazel wand had not worked, recommended the friendship of the brave companions he had mentioned.

"Z początku nie zrozumiano go, otworzono jednak drzwi i ujrzano czcigodnego zakonnika, który rozkazał, aby go zostawiono sam na sam z Tybaldem. Uczyniono zadość jego żądaniu i drzwi za nim zamknięto.","He was not understood at first, but the door was opened and the venerable monk was ordered to be left alone with Tybald. His request was granted, and the door closed behind him.","At first no one understood what he was saying.

"- Maina ladro! Maina can senza fede! Lettereo skierował statek w stronę nawietrzną, tak że burta po jednej stronie ślizgała się po powierzchni morza; później, zwracając się do załogi, zawołał:","- Maina ladro! Maina can senza fede! Lettereo turned the ship to the windward side so that the side of the ship was sliding on one side over the sea; later, turning to the crew, he called out:","Soon after, the four vessels began to converge upon us, and we heard on all sides: “Mayna ladro, mayna can senza fede.” Lettereo close-hauled, so that our side of the ship was skimming the surface of the water.","the shout, ‘Mayna ladro, mayna can senza fede.’11 Lettereo close-hauled, with the result that our side skimmed the surface of the water. Then, addressing the crew, he said:"
"Tu nowa bo jaźń mnie ogarnęła, gdyż zaledwie przeklęty kozioł poczuł mnie na grzbiecie, wnet dziwnym sposobem zaczął galopować. Jednym skokiem przeskakiwał z góry na górę i przesadzał najgłębsze przepaści, jakby to były rowy; nareszcie otrząsnął się i, sam nie wiem jak, znalazłem się w jaskini, gdzie spostrzegłem młodego podróżnego, który przed kilkoma dniami nocował w naszej pustelni.","Here is a new one, because the self overwhelmed me, because as soon as the cursed goat felt me on its back, it started to gallop in a strange way. He jumped up and down in a single leap and jumped up the deepest gaps as if they were ditches; at last he shook himself, and, I don't know how, I found myself in the cave, where I saw a young traveler who had spent the night in our hermitage a few days ago.","New fears were not long in assailing me, for as soon as this cursed goat felt me on his back, he started to gallop in a strange way. He leapt from mountain to mountain in a single bound, jumping over the deepest valleys as though they were no more than ditches.","New horrors soon assailed me. As soon as the cursed goat felt my weight on its back it galloped off in an extraordinary manner.

There I saw the young horseman who two days ago had slept at our hermitage."
"- Najniższy sługa - odparł Tybald - wszelako zapewniam cię, że to, co robiłem wczoraj, jest niczym w porównaniu do tego, czego się może po mnie spodziewać kobieta uczciwa i szlachetna. A żadna z wczorajszych dziewcząt na takie miano nie zasługuje.","""Lowest servant,"" replied Tybald, ""yet I assure you that what I did yesterday is nothing compared to what an honest and noble woman can expect from me."" And none of yesterday's girls deserves such a name.","“The very same,” said Thibaud, “and I assure you that what I did then is as nothing compared with what a charming honest young lady could expect of me. For those girls I was with were anything but that.”","‘It is, indeed,’ said Thibaud, ‘and I assure you that what I did was nothing to what a charming and respectable young lady might expect. For my female companions were anything but that.’"
"- Jak możesz jednak mniemać, senor Alfonsie - mówiła dalej Rebeka - ażeby słowo honoru dane dwom szatanom było obowiązujące? Dowiedzieliśmy się już, że są to dwa złe duchy niewieście, z których jeden zwie się Eminą, drugi zaś Zibeldą, wszelako nie możemy dotąd przeniknąć istoty tych szatanów, gdyż w naszej nauce, jak we wszystkich innych, nie można wszystkiego wiedzieć.","“But how can you, Senor Alphonsus,” continued Rebecca, “that the word of honor given to the two satans should be binding? We have already learned that these are two evil female spirits, one of which is called Emina and the other Zibelda, but we cannot yet penetrate the essence of these devils, because in our science, as in all others, it is impossible to know everything.","“But Signor Alphonse,” said Rebecca, “how can you imagine that a pledge of honour given to two demons could be binding upon you? Now, we know these are two female demons, and their names are Emina and Zibedde. But we are not very well acquainted with the nature of these demons, because in our science, as in every other, one cannot know everything.”","‘But Señor Alphonse,’ continued Rebecca, ‘how can you believe that a promise given to two demons can be binding on you? Now we know already that there are two female demons there called Emina and Zubeida, but we don’t know very much about the nature of these demons because in our art as in all others one cannot know everything.’"
