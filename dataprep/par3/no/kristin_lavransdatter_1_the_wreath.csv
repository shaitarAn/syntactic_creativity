"Dette aar blev ualmindelig godt over hele Norddalen. Der blev meget høi og det kom tørt i hus, fra sætrene vendte folk hjem med stor budraatk1209 og fete bølinger – og de hadde sluppet naadig fra udyr iaar. Kornet stod saa vakkert at faa mennesker kunde mindes, de hadde set det staa bedre – det blev vel modent og [338] fuldt av mat, og veiret var det allerbedste.

It got very high and it came dry in the house, from the farms people returned home with big budraatk1209 and fat bullies - and they had escaped graciously from beasts this year.

The hay was abundant, and it was all safely harvested. Everyone returned home from the mountain pastures with fattened livestock and great quantities of butter and cheese—and they had been mercifully free of predators that year. The grain stood so high that few people could remember ever seeing it look so fine. The crops ripened well and were bounteous, and the weather was the best it could be. Between Saint Bartholomew’s Day and the Feast of the Birth of Mary, during the time when frosty nights were most likely, it rained a little and the weather was warm and overcast, but after that the harvest month proceeded with sunshine and wind and mild, hazy nights. By the week after Michaelmas, most of the grain had been brought in throughout the valley.","THE YEAR proved a rarely good one over all the north part of the Dale. The hay crop was heavy, and it was got in dry; the folk carne home from the sæters in autumn with great store of dairy stuff and full and fat flocks and herds — they had been mercifully spared from wild beasts, too, this year. The corn stood tall and thick as few folks could call to mind having seen it before — it grew full-eared and ripened well, and the weather was fair as heart could wish. Between St. Bartholomew ’s and the Virgin’s Birthfeast, the time when night frosts were most to be feared , it rained a little and was mild and cloudy, but thereafter the time of harvest went by with sun and wind and mild, misty nights.

"Herr Munan bar frem et brev fra Erlend Nikulaussøn. Erlend bød til at Lavrans maatte i ett og alt raade for [304] vilkaarene selv, om han vilde fæste ham sin datter Kristin.

Videre bød han til at la Kristin faa raade med fuld myndighet over hendes del av boet, baade det hun eiet hjemmefra og det hun fik av ham. Men om Lavrans ønsket andre vilkaar for boskipnaden,k1110 da vilde Erlend ogsaa gjerne høre paa ham og rette sig derefter. Det eneste vilkaar Kristins frænder skulde binde sig til mot dette var, at om de fik vergemaalk1111 for børn av ham og hende, da skulde de aldrig friste at omstøtek1112 de gaver han hadde git til sinen97 børn med Eline Ormsdatter, men la staa ved magt,k1113 at dette gods var utgaat avk1114 hans bo før han kom i egteskap med Kristin Lavransdatter.

Erlend offered that Lavrans had to decide for himself [304] the conditions himself, if he wanted to attach him to his daughter Kristin. Erlend herself was willing to let her property be valued and her income searched by unwilling1107 men, giving Kristin such concessions1108 and morgengavek1109 that she became the owner of one third of his estate apart from her own family and all the inheritance she had to get from her relatives, if she were to become a widow after him without children who survived the father. Furthermore, he offered to let Kristin have full authority over her part of the estate, both what she owned from home and what she got from him. But if Lavrans wanted other conditions for the cattle, k1110 then Erlend also wanted to listen to him and correct himself accordingly. The only condition Kristin's relatives should commit to this was that if they received guardianship1111 for children from him and her, then they should never be tempted to repatriate1112 the gifts he had given to his97 children with Eline Ormsdatter, but let it stand, k1113 that this estate had expired avk1114 his estate before he married Kristin Lavransdatter.

Erlend proposed that Lavrans should decide on all of the conditions if he would agree to the betrothal of his daughter Kristin.

Furthermore, he offered to allow Kristin to manage with full authority her part of the property, both that which she brought into the marriage and that which she was given by him. But if Lavrans preferred other conditions for the division of property, then Erlend would be willing to hear his views and to act accordingly. There was only one condition to which Kristin’s kinsmen would have to bind themselves: if they acquired guardianship over any children that he and she might have, they must never try to revoke the gifts that he had given to his children by Eline Ormsdatter. They must recognize as valid the claim that these properties had been separated from his possessions before he entered into the marriage with Kristin Lavransdatter. Finally, Erlend offered to hold the wedding with all appropriate splendor at his manor at Husaby.","Sir Munan brought forth a letter from Erlend Nikulaussön.

Further, his proffer was to grant Kristin full power to deal at her pleasure with her share of the common estate, both what she had of her own kindred and what came to her from her husband. But if Lavrans wished for other terms of settlement, Erlend was most willing to hear his wishes and to follow them in all things. To one thing only he asked that Kristin’s kindred, on their side, should bind themselves: that, should the guardianship of his children and Kristin’s ever come to them, they would never try to set aside the gifts he had made to his children by Eline Ormsdatter, but would let all such gifts hold good, as having passed from his estate before his entry into wedlock with Kristin Lavransdatter.

Others were brewing something that they rubbed in their hair; afterward, when they had wound strands of their hair tightly around leather straps, they would have wavy and curly tresses.","And so there was great stir and bustle in the novices’ sleeping rooms on the eve of St. Margaret’s Mass; the maids who were to go to the guild feast ransacking their chests and making ready their finery, while the others, less fortunate, went about something moodily and looked on. Some had set small pots in the fireplace and were boiling water to make their skin white and soft; others were making a brew to be smeared on their hair — then they parted the hair into strands and twisted them tightly round strips of leather, and this gave them curling, wavy tresses."

"Paa Jørundgaard strævet de og stelte til det store brylluppet. De sidste to maaneder hadde Kristin hat saa travlt fra morgen til kveld hver eneste dag, saa hun fik liten tid til at bekymre sig om andet end arbeidet. Hun saa at hun var blit svær over barmen, de smaa lyserøde brystvorter blev brune, og de var ømme som saar hver morgen naar hun maatte op i kulden – men det gik over, naar hun hadde arbeidet sig varm, og saa tænkte hun bare paa alt hun skulde ha utrettet før kvelden. Naar hun maatte rette op ryggen indimellem og staa og hvile litt, kjendte hun at det tok til at bli tungt, det som hun bar i fanget – men hun var like smal og slank at se paa endda. Hun strøk med hænderne nedover sine lange, fine hofter. Nei hun gad ikke sørge over det nu. Det kunde komme over hende at hun tænkte med en liten kriblende længsel – om en maaned eller saa vilde hun vel kjende liv –. Til den tid var hun paa Husaby. Kanske Erlend blev glad –.

When she had to straighten her back occasionally and stand and rest a little, she felt that it was getting heavy, what she was carrying in her lap - but she was just as slim and slender to look at even. She stroked her hands down her long, fine hips. No she did not want to grieve over it now. It could happen to her that she thought with a little tingling longing - in a month or so she would probably know life -. At that time she was at Husaby. Maybe Erlend was happy -.

But the pain passed as soon as she warmed up from her work, and then she thought only of what she had to do before nightfall. Sometimes when she straightened up to stretch out her back and paused to rest for a moment, she would notice that what she was carrying in her womb was growing heavy. But she was still just as slender and trim in appearance. She smoothed her hands over her long, fine hips. No, she didn’t want to worry about it now. At times she would suddenly think, with a prickling sense of longing, that in a month or two she would be able to feel life inside her. By that time she would be at Husaby. Maybe Erlend would be pleased.

Her mother, Ulvhild, who had slept in her arms each night all these years, little Ramborg — she yearned so much for them; she longed for all the folk at home, and the horses and the dogs, for Kortelin, whom Ulvhild was to have while she was gone, and for her father’s hawks as they sat there on their perches with their hoods over their heads. She saw the horse-hide gloves that hung beside them to wear when you took them on to your wrist, and the ivory staves to scratch them with."

Trond had called his sister a crazy, demented woman and her husband a spineless fool who had never learned to rein in his wife. Kristin grew flushed with rage, but she was also ashamed. She realized that a grave impropriety had taken place when her mother had driven her closest kinsmen from the manor. And for the first time it occurred to Kristin that there was something about her mother that was not as it should be —that she was different from other women.","Next morning as soon as she was up, she heard that her mother’s brother and all his party had left the place — in anger; Trond had called his sister a foolish, crazy woman, and his brother-in-law a soft simpleton who had never known how to rule his wife.

He has not been allowed to keep sons - it was you his daughters who were to build up the family after him - he must now live the day he sees, one is unhealthy and the other dishonorable - »","“I’ve noticed it every time I’ve been out to visit your home,” he said. “You, his women, have so little understanding of the kind of man Lavrans is. Trond Gjesling says that he doesn’t keep you all in line. But why should Lavrans bother with such things when he was born to rule over men? He had the makings of a chieftain, he was someone men would have followed, gladly; but these are not the times for such men. My father knew him at Baagahus. And so it has ended with him living up there in the valley, almost like a peasant. He was married off much too young; and your mother, with that temperament of hers, was not the one to make it any easier for him to lead such a life. It’s true that he has many friends, but do you think that any one of them can measure up to him? His sons he was not allowed to keep; it was you daughters who were to continue the lineage after him. Will he now have to endure the day when he sees that one is without health and another is without honor?”","“I have seen it well, each time I was at your home,” said he, “how little you understood, you his womenfolk, what a man Lavrans is. Knows not how to rule you, says yonder Trond Gjesling — and ’twere like he should trouble himself with such work — he who was born to rule over men. He was made for a leader, ay, and one whom men would have followed — gladly. These are no times for such men as he — my father knew him at Baaghaus. … But, as things are, he has lived his life up there in the Dale, as he were little else but a farmer. … He was married off all too young — and your mother, with her heavy mood, was not the one to make it lighter for him to live that life. So it is that he has many friends — but think you there is one who is his fellow? His sons were taken from him — ’twas you, his daughters, who were to build up his race after him — must he live now to see the day when one is without health and the other without honour — ?”"
"Kristin reiste sig lydig. Hun hegtet sin kaape om sig. Skoene hendes stod henne ved sengen – hun husket det, men hun orket ikke drage dem paa, saa Simon saa det.","Kristin stood up obediently.

"Lykkelig smøg hun sig ind til ham. Ikke for at hun nogen stund trodde paa, at det skulde gaa som Erlend ventet saa visst – Kristin tænkte at en dommens dag kom sikkert over dem før længe. Dette kunde dog umulig bli ved at gaa godt –. Men hun var ikke saa ræd – hun var meget ræddere for at Erlend skulde [214] maattev206 reise nordover før saken kom op, og hun maatte sitte igjen, skilt fra ham. Han var over paa borgen paa Akersnes nu; Munan Baardsøn sat der mens fehirdenk905 var i Tunsberg, hvor kongen laa farlig syk. Men engang maatte da vel Erlend hjem og se til eiendommene sine. At hun var ræd fordi han skulde hjem til Husaby hvor frillen sat og biet paa ham, det vilde hun ikke være ved for sig selv engang, og hellerikke at hun var mindre ræd for at bli grepet i synden sammen med Erlend end for at staa frem alene og si til Simon og til sin far, hvad som laa hende paa hjertet.","Happily, she snuck in to him. Not that she ever believed that it would go as Erlend expected so surely — Kristin thought that a day of judgment would surely come upon them before long. This, however, could not possibly continue to go well -. But she was not so afraid — she was much more afraid that Erlend would have to travel north before the case came up, and she would have to sit back, separated from him. He was over at the castle at Akersnes now; Munan Baardsøn sat there while fehirdenk905 was in Tunsberg, where the king was dangerously ill. But one day Erlend had to go home and look at his properties. That she was afraid because he was going home to Husaby where the maiden was sitting and begging for him, she would not even know for herself, nor that she was less afraid of being caught in sin with Erlend than of standing up alone and tell Simon and her father what was on her mind.","Joyfully she crept closer in his arms. Not that she for a moment believed that things would go as Erlend so confidently expected. Kristin thought that a judgment day was sure to befall them before long. It was impossible for things to continue to go so well. But she was not particularly afraid. She was much more frightened that Erlend might have to travel north before the matter could be settled, and she would have to stay behind, separated from him. He was over at the fortress on Akersnes right now; Munan Baardsøn was there while the Royal Treasurer was in Tunsberg, where the king lay deathly ill. But one day Erlend would no doubt have to return home to see to his property. She refused to admit that this frightened her because he would be going home to Husaby where his mistress was waiting for him. But she was less afraid of being caught in sin with Erlend than of standing up alone and telling Simon, and her father as well, what was in her heart.","Happily she nestled to him. Not that she ever thought for a moment it would turn out as Erlend was so sure it would — Kristin felt that before long a day of judgment must come upon them. It could not be that things should go well for them in the end. … But she was not so much afraid — she was much more afraid Erlend might have to go northward before it all came to light, and she be left behind, parted from him. He was over at the castle at Akersnes now; Munan Baardsön was posted there while the bodyguard was at Tunsberg, where the King lay grievously sick. But sometime Erlend must go home and see to his possessions. That she was afraid of his going home to Husaby because Eline sat there waiting for him, she would not own even to herself; and neither would she own that she was less afraid to be taken in sin along with Erlend, than of standing forth alone and telling Simon and her father what was in her heart."

"Et par dage senere hadde broder Edvin det saa godt at han vilde fare sydover. Siden dette laa ham saa meget paa hjerte, lot Lavrans gjøre enslags baare, som blev ophængt mellem to hester, og slik førte han den syke saa langt syd som til Lidstad; der fik broder Edvin nye hester og nyt følge, og slik blev han ført frem saa langt som til Hamar. Der døde han i prædikebrødrenes kloster og blev gravlagt i deres kirke. Siden forlangte barfotbrødrene liket utleveret til sig, fordi mange folk omkring i bygderne holdt ham for en hellig mand, og talte om ham som Sankt Even; bønderne bad til ham opover Oplandene og Dalene helt nord til Trondheim.

Since this was so dear to his heart, Lavrans had a kind of stretcher made, which was hung between two horses, and so he led the sick man as far south as to Lidstad; there brother Edvin got new horses and new retinue, and so he was led as far as Hamar. There he died in the convent of the preaching brethren and was buried in their church. Since then, the barefoot brothers demanded that the body be handed over to them, because many people around the villages considered him a holy man, and spoke of him as Saint Even; the peasants prayed to him up the Uplands and Valleys all the way north to Trondheim.

Later the barefoot friars demanded that the body be delivered to them, because many people in the villages considered him a holy man and called him Saint Even. The farmers in the outlying districts and valleys as far north as Nidaros prayed to him. And thus there was a long dispute between the two cloisters over his body.","A few days later Brother Edvin was grown so much better that he would fain set out on his journey southward. Since his heart was set on this, Lavrans had a kind of litter made, to be slung between two horses, and on this he brought the sick man as far south as to Lidstad; there they gave him fresh horses and men to tend him on his way, and in this wise was he brought as far as Hamar. There he died in the cloister of the Preaching Friars, and was buried in their church. Afterward the Barefoot Friars claimed that his body should be delivered to them; for that many folks all about in the parishes held him to be a holy man, and spoke of him by the name of Saint Evan.

"Et bueskudk49 nord for kirken omtrent laa ved veien en stor stenblok, og omkring den var der en tæt lund av bjerketrær og asp. Der pleiet de leke kirke, og Tomas, den yngste dattersønnen til Eirik prest, stod op og messet efter sin morfar, kostet med vievandk50 og døpte, naar der laa regnvand i groperne paa stenen.n54 Men høsten før hadde det hændt engang at de kom ilde ut. Først hadde Tomas viet sammen hende og [9] Arne – Arne var ikke ældre end det hændte han blev med børnene og lekte, naar han kunde slippe til det. Siden fanget Arne en grisunge som gik der, og den bar de til daapen. Tomas salvet den med gjørme, dyppet den i et vandhul og hermet efter sin morfar, messetv10 paa latin og skjendte for de ofret ikke nok – da lo børnene, for de hadde hørt de voksne snakke om Eiriks umaadelige pengegriskhet. Og jo mere de lo, jo værre blev Tomas til at finde paa; saa sa han at dette barnet var avlet i langfasten,k51 og de skulde bøte til presten og kirken for sin synd. Da lo de store gutterne saa de skrek, men Kristin blev saa skamfuld at hun var paa graaten, der hun stod med grisungen i fanget. Og mens de holdt paa med dette, saa bar det ikke bedre til end at Eirik selv kom ridende hjemover fra sognebud.k52 Da han skjønte hvad ungerne hadde for sig, sprang han av hesten, rakte de hellige kark53 til Bentein, den ældste dattersønnen, som var med ham, saa braat at Bentein nær hadde tapt sølvduen med Guds legemek54 i bakken; presten for ind mellem børnene og dængte saa mange som han kunde faa fat i. Kristin mistet grisungen, og den for skrikende nedover veien med daapsklædet slæpende efter sig, saa prestens hester stod paa bakbenene av rædsel; presten ristet ogsaa hende saa hun faldt, og han støtte til hende med foten, saa hun hadde vondt i hoften mange dage efter. Da mente Lavrans, da han hørte om dette, at Eirik dog hadde været for streng mot Kristin, siden hun var saa liten. Han sa han vilde tale med presten om dette, men Ragnfrid bad ham ikke gjøre det, for barnet hadde ikke faat andet end det hun hadde forskyldt,k55 naar hun var med paa en slik bespotteligk56 lek. Saa nævnte ikke Lavrans videre om saken, [10] men han gav Arne de værste hug, gutten nogentid hadde faat.","An archhead 49 north of the church was about a large block of stone by the road, and around it was a dense grove of birch trees and aspen. There they used to play church, and Tomas, the youngest grandson of Eirik the priest, got up and massed after his grandfather, cost with holy water50 and baptized when there was rainwater in the pits on the stone.n54 But the autumn before it had happened once that they came bad out. First Tomas had married her and [9] Arne - Arne was not older than he used to be with the children and played when he could get away with it. Then Arne caught a piglet that went there, and they carried it to the baptism. Thomas anointed it with mud, dipped it in a water hole and imitated his grandfather, messetv10 in Latin and scolded for not sacrificing enough - then the children laughed, because they had heard the adults talk about Eirik's immeasurable greed for money. And the more they laughed, the worse Tomas became; then he said that this child had been bred in Lent, k51 and they were to atone for the priest and the church for their sin. Then the big boys laughed so they screamed, but Kristin became so ashamed that she was crying as she stood with the piglet in her lap. And while they were doing this, it was no better than that Eirik himself came riding home from the parish priest. who was with him, so suddenly that Bentein had almost lost the silver dove with the body of God54 in the ground; the priest ran in between the children and crowded as many as he could get hold of. Kristin lost the piglet, and the one screaming down the road with the baptismal garment dragging behind him, so that the priest's horses stood on their hind legs in terror; the priest also shook her so that she fell, and he supported her with her foot, so that she had pain in her hip many days after. Then Lavrans, when he heard about this, thought that Eirik had been too strict with Kristin, since she was so small. He said he wanted to talk to the priest about this, but Ragnfrid did not ask him to do so, for the child had received nothing but what she owed, when she took part in such a ridiculous play. Lavrans did not mention the matter further, [10] but he gave Arne the worst blows the boy had ever received.","A large boulder lay near the road, about the distance of an arrow shot north of the church, and around it there was a dense grove of birch and aspen. That’s where they played church, and Tomas, the youngest grandson of Eirik the priest, would stand up and say mass like his grandfather, sprinkling holy water and performing baptisms when there was rainwater in the hollows of the rock. But one day the previous fall, things had gone awry. First Tomas had married Kristin and Arne— Arne was still so young that he sometimes stayed behind with the children and played with them when he could. Then Arne caught a piglet that was wandering about and they carried it off to be baptized. Tomas anointed it with mud, dipped it into a hole filled with water and, mimicking his grandfather, said the mass in Latin and scolded them for their scanty offerings. That made the children laugh because they had heard the grown-ups talking about Eirik’s excessive greed. And the more they laughed, the more inventive Tomas became. Then he said that this child had been conceived during Lent, and they would have to atone before the priest and the church for their sin. The older boys laughed so hard that they howled, but Kristin was so filled with shame that she was almost in tears as she stood there with the piglet in her arms. And while this was going on, they were unlucky enough that Eirik himself came riding past, on his way home after visiting a sick parishioner. When he saw what the children were up to, he leaped from his horse and handed the holy vessel abruptly to Bentein, his oldest grandson, who was with him. Bentein almost dropped the silver dove containing the Holy Host on the ground. The priest rushed in among the children and thrashed as many as he could grab. Kristin dropped the piglet, and it ran down the road squealing as it dragged the christening gown behind, making the priest’s horses rear up in terror. The priest also slapped Kristin, who fell, and then he kicked her so hard that her hip hurt for days afterward. When Lavrans heard of this, he felt that Eirik had been too harsh toward Kristin, since she was so young. He said that he would speak to the priest about it, but Ragnfrid begged him not to do so, because the child had received no more than she deserved by taking part in such a blasphemous game. So Lavrans said nothing more about the matter, but he gave Arne the worst beating he had ever received.","A bowshot or so north of the church there lay by the roadside a great block of stone, and around it a thick, small grove of birch and aspen. Here the children were wont to play at church, and Tomas, the youngest son of Eirik priest’s daughter, stood up in the person of his grandfather and said mass, sprinkled holy water, and even baptized, when there was rain-water in the hollows of the rock. But once, the autumn before, this game had fallen out but sadly for them. For first Tomas had married Kristin and Arne — Arne was not so old but he would go off and play with the children when he saw a chance. Then Arne caught a baby pig that was going by, and they brought it into church to be baptized. Tomas anointed it with mud, dipped it into a pool of water, and, copying his grandfather, said mass in Latin and chid them for the smallness of their offerings — and at this the children laughed, for they had heard their elders talk of Eirik’s exceeding greed of money. But the more they laughed the worse Tomas got in the things he hit on: for next he said that this child had been gotten in Lent, and they must pay penalty for their sin to the priest and the Church. The great boys shouted with laughter at this; but Kristin was so ashamed that she was all but weeping, as she stood there with the little pig in her arms. And just as this was going on who must chance to come that way but Eirik himself, riding home from a sick visit. When he understood what the young folks were about, he sprang from his horse, and handed the holy vessels to Bentein, his eldest grandson, who was with him, so suddenly that Bentein nearly dropped the silver dove with God’s body in it on the hillside, while the priest rushed in among the children belabouring all he could reach. Kristin let slip the little pig, and it rushed shrieking down the road with the christening robe trailing after it, while Eirik’s horses reared and plunged with terror; the priest pushed her, too, so that she fell down, and he knocked against her with his foot so hard that she felt the pain in her hip for many days after. Lavrans had thought when he heard of this that Eirik had been too hard with Kristin, seeing she was but a little child. He said he would speak to the priest of it, but Ragnfrid begged him not to do so, for the child had gotten but what she deserved, for joining in such a blasphemous game. So Lavrans said no more of the matter; but he gave Arne the worst beating the boy had ever had."
"«Der er en mand borte i gjestehuset hos os som har ærinde til sutaren allikevel, han kan bære frem budet dit, Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn, og da kan datteren din bli med ham eller være i klostret til du selv skal fare hjem.

"Ellers var der aarsaker nok til at Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn kunde være uglad og stur denne sommeren, for nu tegnet det rent til uaar der i bygden, og bønderne satte tingk966 for at raade om, hvordan de skulde møte vinteren som stundet til. Allerede ut paa eftersommeren var det klart for de fleste, at de maatte slagte ned eller drive sydover til salgs storparten av buskaperne sine og kjøpe hjem korn til vintermat for folk. Aaret før hadde ikke været godt kornaar, saa forraadene av gammelt korn var mindre end vanlig.","Otherwise there were enough reasons for Lavran's Bjørgulfsøn to be unhappy and stubborn this summer, for now it was raining for years in the village, and the peasants set tingk966 to advise on how to meet the winter as it was. Already in the late summer it was clear to most people that they had to slaughter or drive south to sell most of their livestock and buy home grain for winter food for the people. The year before had not been a good grain year, so the stocks of old grain were smaller than usual.","There were plenty of reasons for Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn to be unhappy and gloomy that summer, because there were signs it would be a bad harvest in the village. The landowners called a ting to discuss how they were going to face the coming winter. By late summer it was already clear to most people that they would have to slaughter their livestock or drive a large part of their cattle to market in the south in order to buy grain for people to eat in the winter. The year before had not been a good year for grain, so supplies of old grain were smaller than normal.","For the rest, Lavrans Björgulfsön had reason enough this summer to be moody and downcast, for now all tokens showed that the year would be an exceeding bad one in all the country round; and the farmers were coming together time and again to take counsel how they should meet the coming winter. As the late summer drew on, it was plain to most, that they must slaughter great part of their cattle or drive them south for sale, and buy corn to feed their people through the winter. The year before had been no good corn year, so that the stocks of old corn were but scanty."

""He can not be conscious, k1040 it is so, but he closes another eye - we can come to the priest at night and move on at night. Then I think that Aasmund will argue in front of Lavran afterwards that it is not fitting for a godly man like him to divorce us when we are married by a priest - he must rather give his consent so that we become legal spouses. You can say the same thing to the man. He may set the terms he himself wants for a settlement between us and demand fines which he deems reasonable.

We’ll go to the priest at night and keep on traveling by night. I imagine that Aasmund will probably tell Lavrans afterward that it’s improper for a God-fearing man like him to part us once we’ve been married by a priest. Rather, he ought to give us his blessing so that we will be legally married. You must tell Lavrans the same thing. He can state his own conditions for a reconciliation with us and demand whatever penalties he deems reasonable.”","“Aasmund has spoken for me to Lavrans,” said Erlend. “He would not be privy to our counsels, but ’tis like he will wink an eye — we must come to the priest by night, and journey onward by night. And afterward, I trow well Aasmund will put it to Lavrans that it befits not a God-fearing man like him to part them that a priest has wedded — and that ’twill be best for him to give his consent, that we may be lawful wedded man and wife. And you must say the like to the man, Moster. He may set what terms he will for atonement between us, and ask all such amends as he deems just.”"

The monk was tall and thin, but skilfully backed; the child thought he looked like an old crane in his head, for it was small, with a narrow, shiny, shiny skull over a bushy, white wreath, and sat on a long, thin, wrinkled neck. The nose was also large and pointed like a beak. But there was something that made her light and happy, as long as she looked him up in the long, narrow, furrowed face. The old water-blue eyes were reddish and laagenek212 brownish and thin as obstacles, radiating a thousand wrinkles from them, the withered cheeks with the reddish vein were pierced by wrinkles that ran down to the small narrow-mouthed mouth, but it was as if brother Edvin had become so wrinkled only by smiling at the people. Kristin never thought she had seen anyone who looked so cheerful and so kind; it was as he carried on luminous and secretive joy, and she wanted to know about it when he began to speak.","Brother Edvin gave her hand a little squeeze, and when they glanced at each other, they both had to laugh.

His nose was also as big and sharp as a beak. But there was something about him that made Kristin feel at ease and happy just by looking up into his long, furrowed face. His old watery-blue eyes were red-rimmed, and his eyelids were like thin brown membranes with thousands of wrinkles radiating from them. His hollow cheeks, with their reddish web of veins, were crisscrossed with wrinkles that ran down to his small, thin-lipped mouth.

Risunge – det ordet Inga hadde slængt mot hende – hun tok likesom imot det og trykket det indtil sig. Risunge, det [183] var barn som var avlet lønlig i skog og eng. Hun kjendte solskinnet og lugten av granerne over skogsletten. Hver ny, piblende uro, hvert hastig pulsslag i kroppen tok hun for at være fosteret som mindet hende om at nu var hun gaat ind paa nye veie – og blev de aldrig saa tunge at vandre tilende, saa var hun viss paa at de maatte føre til Erlend tilsidst.","Then there was in this excitement as much of anticipation as of horror, sweetness as well as qual.k804 She was unhappy - but she felt her love for Erlend as a growth planted inside her - and it shot newer and richer flowers for every day despite the accident. The last night he slept with her she had felt like a fine and fleeting sweetness, that a lust and a happiness awaited her in his arms that she did not even know - now she trembled at the memory of it; she felt it as hot, spicy breath from sunny gardens. Risunge - the word Inga had hurled at her - she kind of accepted it and pressed it to herself. Risunge, there [183] were children who had been secretly bred in forests and meadows. She felt the sunshine and the smell of the spruces over the forest plain. Every new, bubbling restlessness, every rapid pulse in her body she took to be the fetus which reminded her that now she had entered new paths - and if they never became so heavy to walk to, she was sure that they had to lead to Erlend at last.","So in this sense of tension there was just as much anticipation as there was terror; there was sweetness as well as anguish. She was unhappy, but she felt that her love for Erlend was like a plant that had been sown inside her, and for every day that passed it sprouted a new and even lusher abundance of flowers, in spite of her misery. She had experienced the last night that he had slept with her as a delicate and fleeting sweetness, and a passion and joy awaited her in his embrace which she had never known before. Now she trembled at the memory; it felt to her like the hot, spicy gust from the sun-heated gardens. Wayside bastard—those were the words that Inga had flung at her. She reached out for the words and held them tight. Wayside bastard—a child that had been conceived in secret in the woods or meadows. She remembered the sunshine and the smell of the spruce trees in the glade. Every new, trickling sensation, every quickened pulse in her body she took to be the unborn child, reminding her that now she had ventured onto new paths; and no matter how difficult they might be to follow , she was certain that in the end they would lead her to Erlend.","Thus was there in this strained waiting as much of hope as terror, as much of sweetness as of torment. She was unhappy — but she felt her love for Erlend as it were a flower planted within her — and, spite of her unhappiness, it put forth fresher and richer blooms each day. That last night when he had slept by her side she had felt, as a faint and fleeting bliss, that there awaited her a joy and happiness in his arms such as she had not yet known — she thrilled now at the thought of it; it came to her like warm, spicy breaths from sun-heated gardens. Wayside brat — Inga had flung the word at her — she opened her arms to it and pressed it to her bosom. Wayside brat was the name they gave to the child begotten in secret in woods or fields. She felt the sunshine, and the smell of the pines in the forest pasture. Each new, creeping tremor, each sudden pulse-beat in her body she took as a reminder from the unborn babe that now she was come out into new paths — and were they never so hard to follow to the end , she was sure they must lead to Erlend at the last."

Ever since he came to Sil, his father had sought to gather land under him here in the village, and now the knight Andres Gudmundsøn had suggested to Lavrans that the change of husband170 Formo, who was Mr. Andres' mother's odelsgaard, towards Skog, which was better for him, since he was at the king's hird [26] and rarely came here to the valley. Lavrans would reluctantly part with Skog, which was his estate - it had come into his family by royal gift; yet the prey would be advantageous to him in many ways. But Lavrans' brother, Aasmund Bjørgulfsøn, also wanted to clear forest for himself - he now lived on Hadeland, had married on a farm there - so it was uncertain whether Aasmund would relinquish his right of inheritance.","Gradually she began to understand what it was all about. Ever since he had come to Sil, her father had sought to acquire land there in the village, and now Sir Andres Gudmundsøn had offered to exchange Formo, which was his mother’s ancestral estate, for Skog, which lay closer to him, since he was one of the king’s retainers and seldom came to the valley. Lavrans was loath to part with Skog, which was his ancestral farm; it had come into his family as a gift from the king. And yet the exchange would be advantageous to him in many ways. But Lavrans’s brother, Aasmund Bjørgulfsøn, was also interested in acquiring Skog—he was now living in Hadeland, where he had a manor that he had obtained through marriage—and it was uncertain whether Aasmund would relinquish his ancestral property rights.","Little by little she came to have some inkling of what it was all about. Ever since he was come to Sil, Lavrans had sought to gather to himself land here in the parish, and now had Sir Andres Gudmundsön tendered him Formo in Sil, which was Sir Andres’ heritage from his mother, in change for Skog, which lay more fittingly for him, since he was with the King’s bodyguard and rarely came hither to the Dale. Lavrans was loth to part with Skog, which was his freehold heritage, and had come to his forbears by royal gift; and yet the bargain would be for his gain in many ways. But Lavrans’ brother, Aasmund Björgulfsön, too, would gladly have Skog — he dwelt now in Hadeland, where he had wedded an estate — and ’twas not sure that Aasmund would waive the right his kinship gave him."

It was carried over with him also because he was skilled in his craft - but also during the exercise of this he had come into conflict with people; the bishop's picture master rek836 in Bergenv188 would not tolerate that he came and worked there in the diocese.","She thought about Brother Edvin, and one day she gathered her courage and asked Fru Groa for permission to visit the barefoot friars to see a friend of hers there. She could tell that Fru Groa was not pleased; there was little friendship between the Minorites and the other cloisters of the diocese. And the abbess was no more favorably disposed when she heard who Kristin’s friend was. She said that this Brother Edvin was an unreliable man of God, always roaming about the country seeking alms in other dioceses. In many places the peasantry considered him a holy man, but he didn’t seem to realize that the first duty of a Franciscan monk was obedience to his superiors. He had heard the confessions of outlaws and those who had been excommunicated; he had baptized their children and sung them into their graves without asking for permission. And yet his sin was as much due to lack of understanding as it was to defiance, and he had patiently borne the reprimands which had been imposed on him because of these matters. The Church had treated him with forbearance because he was skilled at his craft; but even in the execution of his art he had come into conflict with others. The bishop’s master painters in Bergen refused to allow him to work in their diocese.","She thought of Brother Edvin, and one day she took courage and begged leave of Lady Groa to go out to the barefoot friars and visit a friend she knew there. She marked that Lady Groa misliked this — there was scant friendship between the Minorites and the other cloisters in the bishopric. And the Abbess was no better pleased when she heard who was Kristin’s friend. She said this Brother Edvin was an unstable man of God — he was ever wandering about the country and seeking leave to pay begging visits to strange bishoprics. The common folk in many places held him to be a holy man, but he did not seem to understand that a Franciscan’s first duty was obedience to those set over him. He had shriven freebooters and outlaws, baptized their children and chanted them to their graves, without asking leave — yet, doubtless, he had sinned as much through ignorance as in despite, and he had borne meekly the penances laid upon him on account of these things. He was borne with, too, because he was skilled in his handicraft — but even in working at this, he had fallen out with his craft-fellows; the master-limners of the Bishop of Bergen would not suffer him to come and work in the bishopric there."

People called him Munan the Stump or Munan the Prancer. But in spite of the impression he made, Fru Aashild’s son was still a sensible and capable man who had been the Crown’s envoy in several matters and who doubtless had some influence on those who counseled the gover nance of the kingdom. He lived on his mother’s ancestral property in the Skogheim district. He was quite wealthy and he had made a rich marriage. Fru Katrin, his wife, was peculiarly ugly and she seldom opened her mouth, but her husband always spoke of her as if she were the wisest of women.

Lady Katrin, his wife, was hard-featured beyond the common, and seldom opened her mouth; but her husband ever spoke of her as if she were the wisest of dames, so that she was known in jest as Lady Katrin the Ready-witted, or the Silver-tongued.

"Barnet rødmet av glæde, for hun visste vel at faren var holdt for den vakreste mand vidt omkring, og han saa ut som en ridder, der han stod mellem mændene sine, endda han var klædt mest paa bondevis, slik han brukte det hjemme til daglig.

He had on hose and shoes of undyed leather, and on his head he wore an old-fashioned wide-brimmed woolen hat. His only jewelry was a polished silver buckle on his belt and a little filigree brooch at the neck of his shirt. Part of a gold chain was also visible around his neck.

He had put his seal on it too; I don’t know what to make of such childish pranks. Sir Munan showed me the seal—said it was King Skule’s privy seal that Erlend had inherited from his father. He thought I ought to realize that it’s a great honor that they would ask for my daughter. But I don’t think that Sir Munan would have presented this matter on Erlend’s behalf with such great warmth if he hadn’t realized that, with this man, the power and honor of the Husaby lineage—won in the days of Sir Nikulaus and Sir Baard—are now in decline. Erlend can no longer expect to make the kind of marriage that was his birthright.”","“No, I did not choose,” said Lavrans curtly. “I handed it back to Sir Muñan, and told him what I thought of such doings. Erlend had hung his seal to it too — I know not what a man should say of such child’s tricks. Sir Munan would have me see the device of the seal; that ’twas King Skule’s privy seal, come to Erlend through his father. His thought was, I trow, that I might bethink me how great an honour they did me to sue for my daughter. But ’tis in my mind that Sir Munan had scarce pressed on this matter for Erlend so warmly, were it not that in this man’s hands ’tis downhill with the might and honour of the Husaby kindred, that it won in Sir Nikulaus’ and Sir Baard’s days.… No longer can Erlend look to make such a match as befitted his birth.”"

She no longer begged the way she had when they were young, when she had threatened and raged against this man who closed himself off, shy and modest, when she grew ardent—who turned cold when she wanted to give him more than his husband’s right. That’s the way things were, and that’s how she had gotten with child, time after time—humiliated, furious with shame because she couldn’t be content with his lukewarm, married man’s love. Then, when she was pregnant and in need of kindness and tenderness, he had had so much to give. Whenever she was sick or tormented, her husband’s tireless, gentle concern for her fell like dew on her hot soul. He willingly took on all her troubles and bore them, but there was something of his own that he refused to share. She had loved her children so much that it felt as though her heart were cut out of her each time she lost one of them. God, God, what kind of woman was she, who in the midst of her suffering was capable of tasting that drop of sweetness when he took on her sorrow and laid it close to his own?","Ay, God help her! What kind of woman was she, what kind of mother? She would soon be old now. Yet was she the same; though she no longer begged stormily for love, as when they were young and her passion had made this man shrink and grow cold when she would have had him be lover and not only husband. So had it been — and so, time after time, when she was with child, had she been humbled, beside herself with shame, that she had not been content with his lukewarm husband-love. And then, when things were so with her, and she needed goodness and tenderness — then he had so much to give; the man’s tireless, gentle thought for her, when she was sick and tormented, had fallen on her soul like dew. Gladly did he take up all she laid on him and bear it — but there was ever something of his own he would not give. She had loved her children, so that each time she lost one, ’twas as though the heart was torn from her. God! God! what woman was she then, that even then, in the midst of her torments, she could feel it as a drop of sweetness that he took her sorrow into his heart and laid it close beside his own."

"Men folk ynket ogsaa Sira Eirik.k490 Presten var agtet og avholdt, og folk i bygden var stolte av ham, han var vellært og duelig og hadde i alle de aarene han hadde været ved kirken ikke misholdtk491 en helligdag eller messe eller tjeneste som han var pligtig til at læse. I sin ungdom hadde han været krigsmand under grev Alv av [103] Tornberg, men han var kommet i skade for at dræpe en meget høibyrdigk492 mand, og saa var han tyet til Oslobispen;k493 da denne merket for et nemmek494 han hadde for boklærdom, hadde han tat ham i prestelære. Og hadde det ikke været fordi han endda hadde uvenner for dette gamle drapets skyld, saa skulde Sira Eirik nok aldrig blit sittende her ved denne lille kirken. Vel var han meget grisk efter penger, baade for sin egen pung og for kirken, men den var nu ogsaa saa vakkert utstyret med kar og klær og bøker, og han selv hadde disse børnene – og han hadde aldrig hat andet end sorg og møiek495 av slegten sin. Utover landsbygderne syntes folk at det var urimelig at presterne skulde leve som munke,k496 siden de dog maatte ha kvindfolkhjelp paa gaardene og de vel kunde trænge en kone til at stelle for sig, saa lange og tunge reiser de maatte gjøre rundt i sognet og det i alslags veir; folk husket ogsaa at det var ikke saa lange tider siden presterne i Norge hadde været gifte mænd. Derfor hadde ingen regnet Sira Eirik større til last, at han hadde hat tre børn med den raadskonenk497 som hadde været hos ham da han var ung. Men denne kvelden sa de dog at det saa ut som Gud vilde straffe Eirik for frillelivetk498 hans, saa meget ondt som hans børn og børnebørn hadde voldt ham.

In his youth he had been a warrior under Count Alv of [103] Tornberg, but he had been injured in killing a very high-ranking man, and then he had resorted to the Bishop of Oslo; had he taken him into priesthood. And had it not been for the fact that he even had enemies for the sake of this old murder, Sira Eirik would probably never have stayed here by this little church. Well, he was very greedy for money, both for his own purse and for the church, but it was now also so beautifully equipped with vessels and clothes and books, and he himself had these children - and he had never had anything but sorrow and pain. bad sense. In the countryside people thought it unreasonable for the priests to live as monks, k496 since they still had to have women's help on the farms and they might well need a wife to take care of them, so long and heavy journeys they had to make around the parish and that in all kinds of viruses; people also remembered that it had not been so long since the priests in Norway had been married men. Therefore, no one had counted Sira Eirik bigger to blame, that he had had three children with the raadskonenk497 who had been with him when he was young. But this evening they said that it looked as if God would punish Eirik for his free life, as much as his children and grandchildren had caused him. And some thought that there was probably good sense in that too, that a priest should not have a wife and children - for there must be unfriendliness and indignation between the priest and the people on Finsbrekken; they had been best friends before.","People felt sorry for Sira Eirik too. The priest was loved and respected, and the people in the village were proud of him; he was well educated and capable, and in all his years with the Church he had not missed a single holy day or mass or service that he was obliged to observe. In his youth he had been a soldier under Count Alv of Tornberg, but he had brought trouble on himself by killing a man of exceedingly high birth, and so he had turned to the Bishop of Oslo. When the bishop realized how quick Eirik was to acquire book learning, he had accepted him into the priesthood. And if not for the fact that he still had enemies because of that killing in the past, Sira Eirik would probably never have stayed at that little church. It’s true that he was quite avaricious, both for his own purse and for his church. But the church was, after all, quite attractively furnished with vessels and draperies and books, and he did have those children—but he had never had anything but trouble and sorrow from his family. In the countryside people thought it unreasonable to expect priests to live like monks, since they had to have women servants on their farms and might well be in need of a woman to look after things for them when they had to make such long and arduous journeys through the parish in all kinds of weather. People also remembered that it was not so long ago that priests in Norway had been married men. So no one blamed Sira Eirik for having three children by the housekeeper who was with him when he was young. On this evening, however, they said that it looked as if God wanted to punish Eirik for taking a mistress, since his children and grandchildren had caused him so much grief. And some people said that there was good reason for priests not to have wives or children—for enmity and indignation were bound to arise between the priest and the people of Finsbrekken. Until now they had been the best of friends.","They pitied Sira Eirik too. The priest was beloved and well respected, and the folk of the parish were proud of him; he was learned and skilled in his office, and in all the years he had had their church he had never let a holy-day or a mass or a service pass that he was in duty bound to hold. In his youth he had been man-at-arms under Count Alv of Tornberg, but he had had the misfortune to kill a man of very high birth, and so had taken refuge with the Bishop of Oslo; when the Bishop saw what a turn Eirik had for book-learning, he had him trained for a priest. And had it not been that he still had enemies by reason of that slaying of long ago , it was like Sira Eirik would not have stayed here in this little charge. True enough, he was very greedy of pence, both for his own purse and for the church, but then, was not his church richly fitted out with plate and vestments and books? and he himself had these children — and he had had naught but sorrow and trouble with his family. In these far-away country parishes folk held it was not reason that priests should live like monks, for they must at the least have women to help on their farms, and they might well need a woman to look after things for them, seeing what long and toilsome journeys they must make round the parishes, and that too in all kinds of weather; besides folk had not forgotten that it was not so very long since priests in Norway had been wedded men. Thus, no one had blamed Sira Eirik overmuch that he had had three children by the woman who tended his house, while he was yet young. But this evening they said it looked, indeed, as though ’twas God’s will to punish Eirik for his loose living, so much evil had his children and his children’s children brought upon him. And some thought there was good reason, too, that a priest should have neither wife nor children — for after this it was much to be feared that bitterness and enmity would arise between the priest and the folk on Finsbrekken, who until now had been the best of friends."

"«Jeg saa ikke stort paa ham,» sa Kristin, «og det tyktes mig ikke han var meget at se paa heller.»","""I did not look at him much,"" said Kristin, ""and I did not think he was much to look at either.""","“I didn’t pay much heed to him,” said Kristin, “and it didn’t seem to me that he was much worth looking at anyway.”","“I looked not much upon him,” said Kristin, “and methought, too, he was not much to look on.”"

"Og det sved i hende av savn efter hans venskap. Det sved saa forfærdelig haardt, fordi hun visste hvor meget andet faren hadde at bære paa – og hadde det været som før, da vilde han talt med hende om det. – Det var saa, at de var bedre berget paa Jørundgaard end de fleste steder ellers, men ogsaa her følte de uaaret hver dag og hver stund. Ellers hadde Lavrans om vintrene brukt at ta op og tæmme ungfolerne sine, men dette aaret hadde han om høsten solgt dem alle syd i landet. Og datteren savnet at høre hans stemme ute i tunet, og se ham tumle med de smekre, raggede to-aaringerne i den leken, han elsket saa meget. Der hadde jo ikke været blanktk1082 der paa gaarden i bur eller laaver og binger efter forrige aars høst, men til Jørundgaard kom ogsaa mange folk og bad om hjelp, til kjøps og til gave, og ingen bad forgjæves.","And it sweated in her hand of longing for his friendship. It was sweating so terribly hard because she knew how much else her father had to carry - and if it had been as before, he would have talked to her about it. It was the case that they were better recovered at Jørundgaard than most other places, but even here they felt unwell every day and every moment. Otherwise, Lavrans had spent the winters picking up and taming his young foals, but this autumn he had sold them all in the south of the country in the autumn. And the daughter missed hearing his voice out in the yard, and watching him tumble with the sleek, ragged two-year-olds in the play he loved so much. There had not been a blanket in the yard in cages or barns and bins after last year's autumn, but many people also came to Jørundgaard and asked for help, for purchase and as a gift, and no one asked in vain.","And she burned with longing for his affection.

His daughter missed hearing his voice out in the courtyard and watching him tussle with the lanky, shaggy two-year-old horses in the game that he loved so much. The storerooms, barns, and bins on the farm had not been emptied after the harvest of the previous year, but many people came to Jørundgaard asking for help, either as a purchase or a gift, and no one asked in vain.","And her heart ached within her for the lack of his friendship. The ache was so dreadful in its keenness, because she knew how much else her father had on his shoulders — and had things been as before, he would have talked with her of it all. … It was indeed so, that at Jörundgaard they were in better case than most other places; but here, too, they felt the pinch of the year each day and each hour. Other years it had been Lavrans’ wont in the winters to handle and break in his young colts; but this year he had sent them all south in the autumn and sold them. And his daughter missed the sound of his voice out in the courtyard, and the sight of him struggling with the slender, ragged two-year-olds in the game he loved so well. Storehouses and barns and bins at Jörundgaard were not bare yet — there was store left from the harvest of the year before — but many folk came to ask for help — to buy, or to beg for gifts — and none ever asked in vain."
"«Jeg har en tidende til,» sa Lavrans. «Jeg kunde tiet med det for dig, Kristin – men det er bedre du faar vite det. Det er det, at den manden, du har lagt hugen din til, ham faar du friste at glemme.»","""I have another newspaper,"" Lavrans said.

Every look on her face was fine and sharp - but she was a little gray-pale in the skin, and when she opened her mouth you could see that she did not have good teeth. She did not look strong and should also be ill - had probably already been fired several times, Kristin heard.

But have you not read of men and maids who gave to God all they owned, went into a cloister or naked into the wilds, and repented after. Ay, they are called fools in the godly books.

"Vaaren efter Kristins lange reise fødte Ragnfrid en datter.

Ragnfrid holdt [46] saa meget av dette nye barnet at hun blev ved at gi det die ogsaa det andet aaret det levet; derfor avstod hun efter Sira Eiriks raad noget fra de strenge fasterne og gudfrygtighetsøvelserne sine, saa længe hun hadde barn ved brystet.

Ragnfrid loved [46] so much of this new child that she continued to give it breastfeeding even the second year it lived; therefore, on the advice of Sira Eirik, she refrained from her strict fasts and godly exercises as long as she had a child at her breast. By this and by all the joy over Ulvhild she flourished, so that Lavrans did not think he had seen his wife so happy and beautiful and sociable in all the years he had been married to her.","IN THE SPRING after Kristin’s long journey, Ragnfrid gave birth to a daughter. Both parents had no doubt wished that the child would be a boy, but this did not trouble them for long, and they developed the deepest love for little Ulvhild. She was an exceedingly pretty child, healthy, good-natured, happy, and serene. Ragnfrid loved this new child so much that she continued to nurse her even after she turned two. For that reason Ragnfrid followed Sira Eirik’s advice and refrained from participating in her usual strict fasts and devout rituals for as long as she had the child at her breast. Because of this and because of her joy for Ulvhild, Ragnfrid blossomed; and Lavrans thought he had never seen his wife look so happy and beautiful and approachable in all the years of their marriage.","THE SPRING after Kristin’s long journey, Ragnfrid bore her husband another daughter. Both father and mother had wished indeed that it might be a son, but they soon took comfort, and were filled with the tenderest love for little Ulvhild. She was a most fair child, healthy, good, happy and quiet. Ragnfrid doted so on this new baby that she went on suckling it during the second year of its life; wherefore, on Sira Eirik’s counsel, she left off somewhat her strict fasts and religious exercises while she had the child at the breast. On this account and by reason of her joy in Ulvhild, her bloom came back to her, and Lavrans thought he had never seen his wife so happy or so fair and kindly in all the years he had been wed."

"Ragnfrid hadde valgt dette huset til brudehus, baade fordi det var det mindste loftet – de kunde huse mange flere gjester i det nye bursloftet; det de selv hadde brukt til soverum om sommeren, da Kristin var liten, før Lavrans hadde faat op det store stuehuset, der de nu bodde baade sommer og vinter. Men gamleburet var desuten ogsaa næsten det vakreste huset paa gaarden, siden Lavrans hadde faat det sat istand – det hadde staat til nedfalds, da de flyttet ind paa Jørundgaard. Det var prydet med den vakreste træskurd [344] baade ute og inde, og var loftsrummet ikke stort, saa var det desto lettere at dragek1221 vakkert med tepper og aaklær og skind.","Ragnfrid had chosen this house as a bridal house, both because it was the smallest attic - they could accommodate many more guests in the new attic; what they themselves had used for bedrooms in the summer, when Kristin was little, before Lavrans had opened the large farmhouse, where they now lived both summer and winter. But the old cage was also almost the most beautiful house on the farm, since Lavrans had had it repaired - it had fallen into disrepair when they moved into Jørundgaard. It was adorned with the most beautiful wooden shed [344] both outside and inside, and if the attic was not large, then it was all the easier to dragek1221 beautifully with rugs and aaklær and skins.","Ragnfrid had chosen this building for the bridal house because it was the smallest of the lofts—they could house many more guests in the new loft over the storeroom—and it was the bedchamber they had used themselves in the summertime, when Kristin was small, before Lavrans had built the high loft house, where they now lived both summer and winter. But the old storehouse was undoubtedly also the loveliest building on the farm, ever since Lavrans had had it rebuilt; it had been in a state of disrepair when they moved to Jørundgaard. It was now decorated with the most beautiful carvings both inside and out, and the loft was not large, so it was easier to adorn it with tapestries and weavings and pelts.","Ragnfrid had chosen this house for the bride-house, in part for its having the smallest loft-room — they could make room for many more guests in the new storehouse loft, the one they had used themselves in summer-time to sleep in when Kristin was a little child, before Lavrans had set up the great new dwelling-house, where they lived now both summer and winter. But besides this, there was no fairer house on the farm than the old storehouse, since Lavrans had had it mended and set in order — it had been nigh falling to the ground when they moved in to Jörundgaard. It was adorned with the finest wood-carving both outside and in, and if the loft-room were not great, ’twas the easier to hang it richly with rugs and tapestries and skins."
"Men hun prøvet at slaa det fra sig. Det var meningen at Erlend skulde gjeste dem paa Jørundgaard ved hvitsøndagstider; han hadde spurt Lavrans og Ragnfrid [312] om det vilde være dem imot at han kom, og Lavrans hadde ledd litt og svart, han skulde da ta vel imot maagen sin, kunde Erlend vite.","But she tried to turn it off. Erlend was supposed to visit them at Jørundgaard on Whit Sunday; he had asked Lavrans and Ragnfrid [312] if it would be against them that he came, and Lavrans had laughed a little and black, he should then receive well his stomach, Erlend could know.","But she tried to push this thought aside. Erlend was supposed to stay with them at Jørundgaard during Whitsuntide. He had asked Lavrans and Ragnfrid whether they would have any objections if he came to visit, and Lavrans had hesitated a moment but then replied that he would welcome his son-in-law, Erlend could be assured of that.","But she tried to thrust the fear away. It was meant that Erlend should visit them at Whitsuntide; he had asked Lavrans and Ragnfrid if they had aught against his coming, and Lavrans had laughed a little, and answered that Erlend might be sure his daughter’s bridegroom would be welcome."

People could hardly remember so hard a winter - no more snow fell, not even in the iv288 mountain, but the snow that had come down at Klemensmesse froze hard as stone. The sun was shining from clear skies now the days took to brighten. At night the wind-lights crackled and flickered over the mountain ridges in the north, they flickered over half the sky - but they did not bring a turn of the wind, one day occasionally it could be cloudy, a little dry snow sprinkled, and then it was clear [293] and freezing cold again.

And while no more snow fell, even up in the mountains, the snow that had fallen on Saint Clement’s Day froze as hard as stone. The sun shone in a clear sky, now that the days were growing lighter. At night the northern lights flickered and sputtered above the mountain ridges to the north; they flickered over half the sky, but they didn’t bring a change in the weather.

"Hun begyndte at søke vidnesbyrd om at andre mennesker var ikke syndeløse, de heller. Hun hørte mere efter sladder og hun la merke til alle smaa ting omkring sig som tydet paa at ikke engang søstrene her i klosteret var saa aldeles hellige og uverdslige. Det var bare smaa ting – under fru Groas styre var Nonneseter for verden et foredøme paa det som et gudelig søstrelag skulde være. Nidkjære til gudstjenesten, flittige, omsorgsfulde for fattige og syke var nonnerne. Klausurenk810 blev ikke saa strengt holdt, at ikke søstrene baade tok mot besøk av sine venner og frænder i talestuen og ogsaa selv fik gjeste disse i byen, naar noget stod paa, men ingen nonne hadde gjort huset skam med sin færd i alle de aar, fru Groa hadde raadet over dem.","She began to seek evidence that other people were not sinless, either. She listened more to gossip and she noticed all the little things around her that indicated that not even the sisters here in the convent were so completely holy and unworthy. These were just small things - under Mrs. Groa's rule, Nonneseter was an example to the world of what a divine sisterhood should be. The nuns were zealous for the service, diligent, caring for the poor and sick. Klausurenk810 was not so strictly kept, that the sisters did not both receive visits from their friends and relatives in the parlor, and also themselves were allowed to visit these in the city when something was going on, but no nun had made the house ashamed of its conduct in all those years, Mrs. Groa had ruled over them.","She began looking for evidence that other people, like herself, were not without sin. She paid more attention to gossip, and she took note of all the little things around her which indicated that not even the sisters in the convent were completely holy and unworldly. There were only small things—under Fru Groa’s guidance Nonneseter was, in the eyes of the outside world, exactly as a holy order of nuns ought to be. The nuns were zealous in their service to God, diligent, and attentive to the poor and the sick. Confinement to the cloister was not so strictly enforced that the sisters could not receive visits from their friends and kinsmen in the parlatory; nor were they prevented from returning these visits in the town if the occasion so warranted. But no nun had ever brought shame upon the order through her actions in all the years that Fru Groa had been in charge.","She began to seek for tokens that other folk were not without sin any more than they. She hearkened more to tale-bearing, and marked all the little things about her which showed that not even the Sisters in the convent here were altogether godly and unworldly. These were only little things — under Lady Groa’s rule Nonneseter to the world was a pattern of what a godly sisterhood should be. Zealous in their devotions, diligent, full of care for the poor and sick, were the nuns. Their aloofness from the world was not so strict but that the Sisters both had visits from their friends and kin in the parlour, and themselves were given leave to visit these in the town when aught was afoot; but no nun had brought shame upon the house by her life all the years of Lady Groa’s rule."

"«Har du – kjære hustru min, dette har da ikke du bragt over os,» sa Lavrans og la en haand paa hendes skulder.

"Ogsaa Kristin følte at det var en stor lykke de hadde faat med den lille spæde søsteren. Tænkt over at morens tunge sind gjorde det stilt paa gaarden hadde hun aldrig; hun hadde syntes det var som det skulde være, naar moren optugtetk267 og formanet hende, men faren lekte og skjemtet med hende. Nu var moren meget mildere mot hende og gav hende mere frihet, kjælte ogsaa mere for hende, og da la Kristin litet merke til at hendes mor ogsaa hadde meget mindre tid til at stelle med hende. Hun elsket da Ulvhild, hun som de andre, og var glad naar hun fik bære eller vugge søsteren, og siden blev derv50 endda mere moro med den lille, da hun begyndte at krype og gaa og tale og Kristin kunde leke med hende.","Kristin also felt that it was a great happiness they had had with the little baby sister. She had never thought that her mother's heavy mind made it quiet on the farm; she had thought it was as it should be, when her mother chastised her and admonished her, but her father played and joked with her. Now the mother was much milder towards her and gave her more freedom, also cared for her more, and then Kristin noticed little that her mother also had much less time to take care of her. She then loved Ulvhild, she like the others, and was happy when she got to carry or cradle her sister, and since then it became even more fun with the little one when she started crawling and walking and talking and Kristin could play with her.","Kristin also felt it was a great joy that they had been given her little infant sister. She had never thought about the fact that her mother’s somber disposition had made life at home so subdued. She thought things were as they should be: her mother disciplined or admonished her, while her father teased and played with her. Now her mother was gentler toward her and gave her more freedom; she caressed her more often too, so Kristin didn’t notice that her mother also had less time to spend with her. She loved Ulvhild, as everyone did, and was pleased when she was allowed to carry her sister or rock her cradle. And later on the little one was even more fun; as she began to crawl and walk and talk, Kristin could play with her.","Kristin, too, felt that great happiness had come to them with this tender little sister. That her mother’s heavy mood made a stillness about her home had never come into her thought; she had deemed it was but as it should be that her mother should correct and chide her, while her father played and jested with her. But Ragnfrid was much gentler with her now and gave her more freedom; petted her more, too; and so Kristin little heeded that her mother had much less time to tend her. She loved Ulvhild as much as the others, and was joyful when they let her carry or rock her sister, and in time there was still more sport with the little one when she began to creep and walk and talk and Kristin could play with her."

She asked that Erlend not seek her out this weekend - and he added her to everything she asked for, Kristin thought.

She asked Erlend not to seek her out during the holidays; and it seemed to Kristin that he acquiesced to all her wishes.

She begged Erlend not to seek her till the Holy Week was gone by; and he yielded to her in this, as he did to all her wishes, thought Kristin. It was as much her own blame as his that they had sinned together in not keeping the Lenten fast. But Easter she was resolved they should keep. Yet it was misery not to see him.

I retaliated harshly, and then a case was brought against me for robbery, but I had no money to pay my house servants. You can see that I was too young to deal sensibly with these difficulties, and my kinsmen refused to help me—except for Munan, who did as much as he dared without angering his wife.","“Sigurd took her back again — but she says she fared like a dog and a bondwoman in his house — so she set a tryst with me at Nidaros. ’ Twas little better for me at Husaby with my father. I sold all I could lay hands on, and fled with her to Holland — Count Jacob stood my friend. Could I do aught else? — she was great with my child. I knew many a man had lived even so with another’s wife and had got off cheap enough — if he were rich, that is. But so it is with King Haakon, he is hardest upon his own kin. We were away from one another for a year, but then my father died and then she came back. Then there were other troubles. My tenants denied me rent and would have no speech with my bailiffs because I lay under ban — I, on my side, dealt harshly with them, and so they brought suit against me for robbery; but I had not the money to pay my household withal; and you can see I was too young to meet these troubles wisely, and my kinsfolk would not help me — save Munan — he did all his wife would let him.…"

Yet I lived with Baard for more than twenty years in sorrow and torment, she thought. Well, maybe ’tis so with all of us. It seemed Kristin had not even seen how Ulvhild had fallen away this autumn — ’tis little like, thought Aashild, that she will see her little sister any more. But she said naught of this — the longer Kristin could hold to this mood of wild and reckless gladness, the better would it be, no doubt."
"Hun saa hvor tynde de var blit, Kristins hænder, som hun holdt. Hun saa at bruden var blit mager ellers, [341] men høi over brystet.

Ingebjørg puffet til ham igjen og sa, at de var nok uslitte endda, gudbedre, men her var denne møen – og hun drog Kristin frem. Didrek og drengen hans bar da en kiste ut i svalen. Og nu la han ut det ene par sko vakrere end det andet. Kristin maatte sætte sig paa et skrin, og han prøvet paa hende – der var hvite sko og brune og røde og grønne og blaa, sko med malte hæler av træ og sko uten hæler, sko med spænder og sko med silkebaand i, sko avv141 to og av tre farver skind.

Didrek elbowed Ingebjørg in the side and asked with a laugh if they danced in the monastery in such a way that she had already worn all the shoes she got last year. Ingebjørg puffed at him again and said that they were probably still worn, god forbid, but here was this maiden - and she pulled Kristin forward. Didrek and his boy then carried a coffin out of the swallow. And now he laid out one pair of shoes more beautiful than the other. Kristin had to sit on a chest, and he tried on her - there were white shoes and brown and red and green and blue, shoes with painted heels of wood and shoes without heels, shoes with buckles and shoes with silk ribbons in, shoes avv141 to and of three colors of leather. Kristin almost thought she wanted them all. But they were so expensive that she was horrified - not a single pair cost less than a cow at home. Her father had given her a purse with a mark of silver in counted money, when he left - she was to have it for hand money, k633 and Kristin had thought, this was a great wealth.

Didrek gave Inge bjørg a poke with his elbow and asked her with a laugh whether they were dancing so much at the cloister that she had already worn out all the shoes she had bought the year before.

Then Didrek and his apprentice brought a chest out to the gallery, and he started taking out the shoes, each pair more beautiful than the last. Kristin sat down on a box and he tried the shoes on her feet. There were white shoes, and brown and red and green and blue shoes; shoes with painted heels made of wood, and shoes with no heels at all; shoes with buckles, shoes with silken ties, and shoes made from two or three different colored leathers. Kristin almost thought she liked them all. But they were so expensive that she was shocked —not a single pair cost less than a cow back home. Her father had given her a purse with one mark of silver counted out in coins when he left; this was to be her spending money, and Kristin had thought it a great sum.

Weary from the ride earlier in the day and bleary with drink, the guests wandered around a while longer for the sake of propriety, but more and more of them began to slip away to find the places where they would sleep.","Without, in the courtyard, the noise died down little by little. Wearied with the long day’s ride, and dizzy with much strong drink, the guests made a decent show of merry-making a little while yet, but more and ever more of them stole away and sought out the places where they were to sleep."
"De arbeidet uten at tale sammen; Kristin stod ved kovedøren og kjernet, og Aashild kardet uld fremme ved aaren. Først da Kristin hadde silt ut av kjernen og holdt paa at kna smørret, spurte den unge med ett:","They worked without talking to each other; Kristin stood by the hut door and the core, and Aashild carded wool forward by the oar.

Like a pig in a wheat field, that’s how it was for me, Kristin—and the end result was the same. I was chased off with a shout and a long stick. Well, well. He doesn’t have much joy from his offspring, my grandfather. Why are you walking so fast?”","“Oh, ay,” said Bentein, with a nickering laugh. “So ’twas a fair beginning I was making, you think? I was even like a pig in a wheatfield, Kristin — and the end was the same, I was hunted out with cudgels and the hue and cry. Ay, ay! ay, ay! ’ Tis no great thing, the gladness my grandfather gets from his offspring. But what a mighty hurry you are in!”"

"Sira Sigurd var daarlig likt i bygderne omkring, for han var den som egentlig styrte for Trond med eiendommene hans – eller han fik ialfald skylden, naar Trond for frem med haardhet og uret, og det var ikke frit for at Trond plaget bønderne sine noget.

But after his being no one should believe he was some very wise man; he often said silly things.

But judging by his behavior, no one would think him a clever man; he often said foolish things.

"Rusen syntes at gaa av Lavrans i noget mon, efterhvert som han blev mæt. Han svarte paa hustruens og tjenestemøens spørsmaal om tinget – jo, det hadde været vakkert.

"«Nei,» svarte Simon. «Og ikke tænker jeg der er nogen som tror det heller – de kjender dere og hende og denne Bentein, men her falder jo ikke stort at snakke om i denne utbygden;k540 det er rimelig nok at folk tar for sig av denne fete biten.

But there’s not much to talk about in this remote village ; it’s perfectly reasonable for people to help themselves to this juicy tidbit. Now we’ll have to teach them that Kristin’s reputation is too rich a diet for the peasants around here. But it’s too bad that she was so frightened by his coarseness that she didn’t come to you at once, or go to Sira Eirik himself. I think that whorehouse priest would have gladly testified that he had meant no more than some innocent teasing if you had spoken to him, Lavrans.”","“No,” replied Simon. “Nor do I deem there is any one who believes it — they know you and her and this Bentein; but so little befalls for folk to talk of in these outparishes, ’ tis but reason they should fall to on such a fat tidbit. ’ Tis for us to teach them Kristin’s good name is too fine fare for such clowns as they. But pity it was she let herself be so frighted by his grossness that she went not forthwith to you or to Sira Eirik with the tale — methinks this bordel-priest would but too gladly have avowed he meant naught worse than harmless jesting, had you, Lavrans, got a word with him.”"
"«Kalder du dem værre,» spør Lavrans tankefuld og stryker datteren over huen. «Indi fjeldet syd under Raanekampene saa jeg tre smaagutter engang, og den største var som Kristin her – gult haar hadde de og skindkofter. De flækket tænder mot mig som vargungerk123 før de randt og gjemte sig. Det er vel ikke saa underlig om den fattige manden som eiet dem lystet at berge sig en ku eller to –»","""Do you call them worse,"" Lavran asks thoughtfully, stroking her daughter's hat. ""In the mountains south during the robbery battles, I once saw three little boys, and the biggest one was like Kristin here - they had yellow hair and leather jackets. They split teeth against me like vargungerk123 before they ran and hid. It's not so strange about the poor man who owned them wanting to save a cow or two - »","“You call them worse?” said Lavrans thoughtfully, stroking his daughter’s cap. “In the mountains south of the Raanekamp I once saw three little boys, the oldest about Kristin’s age, and they had blond hair and tunics made of hides. They bared their teeth at me like young wolves before they ran away and hid. It’s not so surprising that the poor man they belonged to should be tempted to take a cow or two for himself.”","“Do you call them worse?” asked Lavrans thoughtfully, stroking his daughter’s cap. “In the hills to the south under the Boar Fells I once saw three little lads, and the greatest was even as Kristin here — yellow hair they had, and coats of skin. They gnashed their teeth at me like wolf-cubs before they ran to hide. ’ Twere little wonder if the poor man who owned them were fain to lift a cow or two —”"
"Kristin længtet efter fru Aashild fra gang til gang, og sommetider snakket fruen meget med hende, men andre ganger ventet barnet forgjæves paa ett ord utover den andens hilsen naar hun kom og naar hun for. – Aashild sat bare med de voksne og talte. Slik var det altid naar hun hadde husbonden sin med sig, ti det hændte nu at ogsaa Bjørn Gunnarson fulgte med til Jørundgaard. Lavrans hadde redet til Haugen en dag om høsten for at bringe fruen lægeløn – det var den bedste sølvkanden med diskk344 til som de hadde i huset. Da hadde han sovet der om natten og roste siden gaarden meget; den var vakker og veldreven og ikke saa liten som folk sa, fortalte han. Og inde i husene var alting velstandsmæssig og husskikken høvisk efter storfolks sed, syd i landet. Hvad han syntes om Bjørn, sa Lavrans ikke, men han tok altid vakkert imot ham, naar han fulgte med sin hustru til Jørundgaard. Derimot likte Lavrans fru Aashild overmaate godt, og han sa, han trodde det meste som var blit fortalt om hende var løgn. Han sa ogsaa at for tyve aar siden hadde hun vist neppe trængt heksekunster for at binde en mand til sig – nu var hun nær de seksti og saa endda ung ut og hadde det vakreste og yndefuldeste væsen.","Kristin longed for Mrs. Aashild from time to time, and sometimes the wife talked to her a lot, but other times the child waited in vain for one word beyond the other's greeting when she came and when she left. Aashild just sat with the adults and talked. This was always the case when she had her husband with her, for it now happened that Bjørn Gunnarson also accompanied him to Jørundgaard. Lavrans had ridden to Haugen one day in the autumn to bring his wife a doctor's salary - it was the best silver jug with disk 344 they had in the house. Then he had slept there at night and praised the farm a lot; it was beautiful and well-run and not as small as people said, he said. And inside the houses, everything was prosperous and the house customs polite according to the custom of great people, south of the country. Lavrans did not say what he thought of Bjørn, but he always received him warmly when he went with his wife to Jørundgaard. Lavran's wife, on the other hand, liked Aashild very much, and he said he thought most of what had been told about her was a lie. He also said that twenty years ago she had hardly needed witchcraft to bind a man to herself - now she was close to sixty and even looked young and had the most beautiful and graceful nature.","Kristin sometimes longed for Fru Aashild, who occasionally would talk to her a great deal, but at other times Kristin would wait in vain for a word beyond the casual greeting as Fru Aashild came and went. Instead, Fru Aashild would sit with the grown-ups and talk. That was always what happened when she brought her husband along with her, for now Bjørn Gunnarsøn also came to Jørund gaard. One day in the fall, Lavrans had ridden over to Haugen to take Fru Aashild payment for her doctoring: the best silver pitcher and matching platter they owned. He had stayed the night and afterward had high praise for their farm. He said it was beautiful and well tended, and not as small as people claimed. Inside the buildings everything looked prosperous, and the customs of the house were as courtly as those of the gentry in the south of the country. What Lavrans thought of Bjørn he didn’t say, but he always received the man courteously when Bjørn accompanied his wife to Jørundgaard. On the other hand, Lavrans was exceedingly fond of Fru Aashild, and he believed that most of what people said about her was a lie. He also said that twenty years earlier she would hardly have required witchcraft to bind a man to her—she was sixty now but still looked young, and she had a most appealing and charming manner.","Kristin longed for Lady Aashild between whiles, and sometimes the lady would chat much with her, but at other times the child would wait in vain for a word beyond the other’s greeting when she came and when she went. Lady Aashild sat and talked with the grown-up folk only. That was always the way when she had her husband with her, for it happened now at times that Björn Gunnarsön came with his wife. Lavrans had ridden to Haugen one day in the autumn to take the lady her leech’s fee — it was the very best silver tankard they had in the house, with a plate to match. He had slept there the night, and ever since he praised the farm mightily; it was fair and well ordered, and not so small as folks would have it, he said. And within the house all spoke of well-being, and the customs of the house were seemly, following the ways of great folks’ houses in the South. What he thought of Björn, Lavrans said not, but he welcomed him fairly at all times when he came with his wife to Jörundgaard. But the Lady Aashild Lavrans liked exceeding well, and he said he deemed most of the tales that had been told of her were lies. He said, too, ’twas most sure that twenty years since she could have had small need of witchcraft to bind a man to her — she was near the sixties now, yet she still looked young and had a most fair and winning bearing."
