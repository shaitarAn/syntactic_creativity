Sådan gik jeg i timevis. Jeg flygted ud i udkanten af byen for ikke at komme i det kvartal. Jeg gik høit op på en høide.,This is how I walked for hours. I fled to the outskirts of town not to get in that quarter. I went high up on a hill.,"But surely the latter has to follow the former. You were the one who once told me that those who have loved each other with the most ardent desire are the ones who will end up like two snakes, biting each other’s tails. “But it has been my consolation over these past few years, Gunnulf, that as often as I thought about Erlend meeting God’s judgment, unconfessed and without receiving the sacraments, struck down with anger in his heart and blood on his hands, he never became what you said or what I myself became.","But a while after the brothers had taken the cowl, Nikulaus had misbehaved him grievously, and had wrought much trouble in the cloister. Gunnulf knew not the causes of the trouble fully — one was that Abbot Johannes would not suffer that young brothers should be ordained priests before they were full thirty years old, and he would not depart from this rule for Nikulaus’ behoof. And as the reverend father deemed that Nikulaus read and pondered more than sorted with his measure of spiritual ripeness, and that he was breaking down his health with pious exercises, he thought fit to send him to one of the cloister’s cattle-farms on Inderö, to work there, under some of the elder monks, at the planting of an apple orchard."
*,*,"There was something that set him apart from other boys, but Kristin couldn’t say what it was, although she watched him closely.","“Ay, ’twas my will to have Gaute for my husband, and trust me, mother, I shall get him."
Jeg stod op og lukkede vinduet.,I got up and closed the window.,"Brother Arngrim seemed surprised by the richness of her farewell gift, for his face lit up.","They came to Hjerdkinn before the hour of vespers, and, after the service in the chapel, Kristin went out into the hills alone."
"Jeg drev op og ned i alle gaderne. Jeg vilde ikke, nei, jeg vilde ikke. Jeg kunde [75] ikke tænke klart, alt hvirvled om i et kaos, skjælvninger, jeg ikke kunde si hvad kom af, minder, dunkle, kvalfulde anelser, så igjen følte jeg indi det små kys på læben, så et smil, hun engang havde smilet. Men ind i alt brændte det: Gå ikke, gå ikke.","I drove up and down all the streets. I did not want to, no, I did not want to. I could [75] not think clearly, everything swirled about in a chaos, tremors, I could not say what came of, memories, dark, nauseating suspicions, then again I felt indi the little kiss on the lip, saw a smile, she once had smiled. But into everything it burned: Do not go, do not go.","“Erlend’s errant paths, you mean,” said the monk gloomily. “It was not just once that my brother led you astray, Kristin; I think he led you astray every day you lived with him. He made you forgetful, so you wouldn’t notice when you had thoughts that should have made you blush, because from God the Almighty you could not hide what you were thinking.” Kristin stared straight ahead. “I don’t know whether you’re right, Gunnulf.","“So long a time has gone by, and so much has befallen since last we met,” she said sorrowfully. “And heavy to bear for you, too, the tidings must have been — the tidings of your brother?” “God be merciful to his poor soul,” whispered Brother Gunnulf in a shaken voice. Only when she asked about her sons at Tautra did Gunnulf speak something more freely. With great gladness had the convent welcomed these two novices, come of the best kindreds in the land."
"Du har aldrig spurgt mig, om hvad jeg har oplevet, og jeg har aldrig sagt dig det. Jeg vilde det så. Jeg vidste ikke hvorfor. Men når jeg nu sidder her, mens alt er stille, da forstår jeg, at det var netop, forat det skulde bli så uendelig stort (jeg tør [98] neppe tro, det er hændt) at det skulde være så.","You have never asked me what I have experienced and I have never told you. I wanted it then. I did not know why. But when I now sit here while everything is quiet, then I understand that it was precisely because it was to be so infinitely large (I dare [98] hardly believe it has happened) that it was to be so.","My position on his estate is much like that of Ulf back home with us.” He laughed. It didn’t suit his damaged face. But he was the handsomest of men in terms of bearing, now that he was full-grown. The clothing he wore was cut according to the new fashion, with close-fitting hose and a snug, short cote-hardi, which reached only to mid-thigh and was fastened with tiny brass buttons all the way down the front, revealing with almost unseemly boldness the supple power of his body.","But I gave Kristin Gautesdatter my best finger-ring, for she has such winsome eyes; almost I deem she will be like you —” Kristin smiled sadly: “Soon will you bring me to think, my Skule, that my sons deem me as great and good as old folk are wont to be, once they are beneath the sod.” “Speak not so, mother,” said the man, with a strange vehemence."
"De mænd, der var om mig, gled bort i en sky, de var som hoder på et maleri. Inde fra kaféen hørte jeg glassene rasle.","The men who were about me slipped away in a cloud, they were like heads on a painting. From inside the cafe I heard the glasses rustling.","All the same, it was good to be back here, good even though it was also strange to know that she would never leave here again. The gray-clad sisters out at Rein followed the same rules, Saint Bernard’s rules, as the brothers of Tautra.","Then she was clad in silks, one of the company of bravely clad great folks, men and women, from the country-side all around. Sira Eiliv stood close by, holding Naakkve and Björgulf firmly; in the throng without were her serving-maids and henchmen."
"Så ler hun til en linerle, som står og vipper i fjæren. Så danser hun to skridt.","Then she laughs at a linerle, which stands and tilts in the spring. Then she dances two steps.","Helge of Hovland was a very wealthy man and belonged to the lineage known as Duk, with estates all over Voss. And then the Devil had tempted the two young people.","But then he stood there unmoving, with his back to Kristin. At length she called him softly by his name."
"Så så jeg komme ind ad døren en mand, der ikke gik ganske som de andre. Hans øine gled ud i rummet, og han så ikke på nogen. Han gik foroverbøiet, og det var som om han havde om sig en del af mørket, som han kom fra.","Then I saw a man come in the door who did not walk quite like the others. His eyes slid out into the room and he did not look at anyone. He walked forward, and it was as if he had around him part of the darkness from which he came.","Kristin and the farmer thought it must be some beast; then they heard stones falling, as if someone were walking across the scree over there, and another cry, like the coarse voice of a man. The monk began praying loudly: “Jesus Kristus, Soter,” Kristin heard. And “vicit leo de tribu Juda.","Gaute called to his horse, that had wandered forward grazing along the green track. He ran after it and brought it back, and they said farewell. Kristin had her wallets over her shoulder already, and her son had set his foot in the stirrup — then he turned and took a step forward:"
"[99] Å, hvorfor går du fra mig? Jeg længes så forfærdelig efter dig? Aner du ikke, hvor jeg pines om dagene, når du er borte fra mig? Hvor er du? Hvad gjør du?","[99] Oh, why are you leaving me? I miss you so terribly? Do you have no idea where I am tormented during the days when you are away from me? Where are you? What are you doing?","Then he laughed a little. “You know quite well that my brothers and I have always thought, ever since we wore our first pair of breeches, that you were the most splendid and magnanimous woman, even though you clutched us tightly under your wings so many times that we had to flap hard before we could escape the nest. “But you were right that Gaute was the one with the makings of a chieftain among us brothers,” he added, and he roared with laughter. “You don’t need to mock me about that, Skule,” said Kristin, and Skule saw that his mother blushed, looking young and lovely. Then he laughed even harder. “It’s true, my mother.","The church’s bells began to ring; Kristin and her son rose. Then Skule took her hand: “Mother,” he said in a low voice. “Mind you that I once lifted my hand against your I threw a bat at you in anger, and it struck you on the brow — mind you of it?"
"Men som uroen voksed hos mig, begyndte det at plage mig, at jeg ikke vidste, hvad det var hun gjorde, hun, med hvem jeg leved barm til barm.","But as the turmoil grew in me, it began to plague me that I did not know what it was she was doing, she with whom I was living bosom to bosom.",Kristin felt a pang in her heart as she gazed after another woman riding between her two children.,"Gaute strove eagerly to shake her purpose — he would have had her at least borrow horses and groom from him and take her serving-maid with her — but, as was most like, coming from a man lying in his naked bed before his mother’s eyes, his words carried little weight."
"– Solen, som står op igjen i alt det lys og alle de former af lys vi ser om os …","- The sun, which rises again in all the light and all the forms of light we see about us…","Finally he asked his mother crossly whether she could get a letter over the mountains in the wintertime. No, she told him, but Sira Dag could surely send a letter to Nes and then onward along the coast; the priests always managed to get their letters through, even during the winter.",Tis true he had known the boy was after a maid — but how could he dream that ’twas aught
"En stund efter sa hun, – og det var som ordet skjalv frem dybt nede fra noget dulgt og i mange år gjemt:","A moment later she said, - and it was as if the word was trembling deep down from something hidden and hidden for many years:","While he dressed and had something to eat, Kristin sat laughing and playing with little Erlend; he chattered on, alert and lively with the morning.","“ ’Tis the use in our quarter of the land that our underlings hearken to their masters when they counsel them for their good,” said Jofrid, when Kristin marvelled that this match was come about. “And in this country-side,” said Kristin, “the common folk are unused to obey us further than ’tis reason they should, or to hearken to our counsel except ’tis for their good as fully as for ours. ’"
*,*,"“Don’t talk like that, Mother,” said the man, his voice strangely vehement.","The uncanny glow in the fog, as of clotted blood, faded away; the dark was falling."
"Og før jeg sovned fik jeg et så vakkert syn, hvormed tankerne endte og drømmene begyndte: Hele verdensrummet var en stor [36] skjælvende tåre, hvori alle stjerner og sole svømmede.","And before I fell asleep I had such a beautiful sight, with which the thoughts ended and the dreams began: The whole universe was a great [36] trembling tear, in which all the stars and suns swam.",People then judged that Gaute Erlendssøn had brought this matter of abducting his bride to the most honorable of ends.,"Your father was not so fearful of my father that he dared not go to have speech with him, nor so afraid of cold that he durst not fare on ski over the fells in winter-time."
"Hun var der ikke. Hun var intetsteds. Jeg gik langs stranden. Jeg så, at båden var borte. Jeg lånte en anden og rode ud. Jeg fandt vor. Den lå alene og flød. Jeg trak af mig og dykked ned. Tilslut havde jeg hende i mine arme.","She was not there. She was nowhere. I walked along the beach. I saw that the boat was gone. I borrowed another and messed up. I found ours. It lay alone and floated. I pulled away and dived down. Finally, I had her in my arms.","Each day, with equal joy, Kristin would look forward to this noble and solemn meal. The refectory was built of wood, but it was a handsome hall, and all the women of the convent ate there together. The nuns sat at the highest table, where the abbess occupied the high seat, along with the three old women besides Kristin who were corrodians. The lay sisters were seated farther down. When the prayer was over, food and drink were brought in and everyone ate and drank in silence, with quiet and proper manners. While one of the sisters read aloud from a book, Kristin would think that if people out in the world could enjoy their meals with such propriety, it would be much clearer to them that food and drink are gifts from God, and they would be more generous toward their fellow Christians and think less about hoarding things for themselves and their own. But she herself had felt quite different back when she set out food for her flock of spirited and boisterous men who laughed and roared, while the dogs sniffed around under the table, sticking up their snouts to receive bones or blows, depending on what humor the boys were in. Visitors seldom came to Rein. An occasional ship with people from the noble estates might put in when they were sailing into or out of the fjord, and then men and their wives, with children and youths, would walk up to the cloister to bring greetings to a kinswoman among the sisters.","if any lay there, to take the place of Sister Agata or of whichever other nun was there. Sister Turid, poor soul, lay there often. Soon, now, she might begin to look forward to the morning meal, which followed after the third hour of prayer and the Mass for the cloister’s serving-folk. Each day alike Kristin took joy in this comely and solemn repast. The refectory was timber-built, but a fair hall notwithstanding, and there all the women in the cloister ate together — the nuns at the upper board, where the abbess sat in the high-seat, and where the three old dames who were commoners like herself had also seats — and the lay sisters further down. When the prayer was ended, the meat and drink borne in, and all sat eating and drinking in silence, with still, seemly behaviour, while often one of the sisters read aloud from a book, Kristin would think that, could folk in the world without but take their meals in such goodly wise, they might well come to see more clearly that food and drink are gifts from God, and they would begrudge them less to their fellow-Christians, and think less on scraping together for their own and their children’s behoof. But she herself had felt quite otherwise, when she spread her board for a flock of wild, riotous men, amid laughter and uproar, while the dogs snuffed about beneath the board, or thrust up their noses and got a meat bone or a thwack, as the mood of the boys might chance to be. Travellers seldom came hither."
*,*,She had heated up the morning drink for Gaute.,Twas as fine here now as she could make it at such short warning.
"Det er saa vanskeligt at forklare. Der er ting, man ved at bruge de rigtige ord kan få andre til at forstå, – men der er også enkelte ting, som trods alle ord ikke kan forstås uden at noget lignende er oplevet.","It's so hard to explain. There are things that you can use others to make others understand - but there are also some things that, despite all the words, cannot be understood without something similar being experienced.","She kept company with the wealthiest and mightiest people in the south, but she never wanted to make the trip to her home valley, and Kristin hadn’t seen her only sister since they parted on that day at Formo. But Kristin was convinced that Ramborg’s resentment toward her remained unchanged.",mind to ask of that story of the stallion that folk said Gaute had broken in with a maiden’s hair-ribbon for bridle: “ ’ Twas yours belike?”
Jeg tog et bad. Jeg klædte mig i mine festklær. Så gik jeg ind til hende.,I took a bath. I dressed in my party clothes. Then I went in to her.,"That was in the beginning. But after the brothers had donned cloister attire, Nikulaus had started behaving quite badly, and he had caused great unrest in the monastery.","Then someone touched her knee — — A monk in the white gown and black cowl of the preaching brothers. She looked down into a pale yellow, furrowed, old man’s"
– Jeg elsker dig.,- I love you.,"Her heart began pounding when she saw the lord abbot of Tautra come ashore, but the monks who accompanied him were all older men.",These seemed to be children of common folk in the town.
– Der er lys.,- There is light.,"But the monks were standing so that she could see only a few faces, and her sons were not among them.","But the monks stood so that there were but few whose faces she could see, and her sons were not amongst these."
"Hun måtte si mig mange, mange gange, at hun elsked mig. Jeg bad hende at kjærtegne mig. Jeg bad hende lægge armen omkring mig, forat jeg kunde føle, at hun var hos mig.","She had to tell me many, many times that she loved me. I asked her to caress me. I asked her to put her arm around me so I could feel like she was with me.","Gaute turned to face her. She took one of his hands in hers and placed her other hand on his shoulder as she implored him to believe that she was not ungrateful toward him or Jofrid; she asked God to be with him. Then she turned him toward his horse, and with a laugh she gave him a thump between his shoulders for good luck.","But I dare nowise forget that I brought little more to his estate than the child I bore beneath my heart, and a heavy burden of amends for my love to pay — seeing that I was party to the wrong he wrought my kin. Time may make that good — but ’tis my duty to pray God to grant my father long life. We are young folk, Gaute and I, we know not how many children ’twill be our lot to have"
*,*,Now she saw that Jofrid liked Gaute’s rich friends and highborn kinsmen best.,"The four Erlendssöns seemed to take pleasure in being together in their mother’s manor, but Kristin got but little speech with her sons."
"Det var ikke længer som før. Der var ikke længer de lange, tause dage.","It was no longer as before. There were no more the long, silent days.","The order had recently acquired an estate in that town, but they were so impoverished that they were barely able to keep up the services, and the church they intended to erect would probably never be built.","Then Kristin said Gaute must go no farther with her; but she would sit a while and rest before going on. Down beneath them lay the Dale, with the river’s greenish-white riband wandering through it, and the farms like small green patches on the forest-covered slopes."
– Ja for De render jo her rundt det samme kvartal uafladelig.,"- Yes, because you run here around the same quarter incessantly.","Suddenly he pulled his hand back, shook it in the air, and then stuck his burned fingertips in his mouth, sucking on them as he turned his head toward her and Erlend and looked at them with a furrowed brow and a smile on his lips.","The smell of the many folk, and the sickening fumes of the sick and the beggars, mingled with the smoke of the wax-candles and sank down in a heavy, strangely greasy and clammy cloud upon the people kneeling on the stone floor, cold in the cold morning."
"Og det er altid den samme kvinde. Der er tusen, ja hundretusen mænd i verden. Men der er blot én kvinde, blot en eneste én. Det er den samme kvinde, som er i alle kvinder, det samme snigende fantom, – der kan gjøre sig så lidet som en mus [47] – og så vældigt og vidunderligt som et fata morgana.","And it's always the same woman. There are a thousand, yes a hundred thousand men in the world. But there is only one woman, just a single one. It is the same woman who is in all women, the same insidious phantom, - who can make herself as little as a mouse [47] - and as mighty and wonderful as a fata morgana.","All the same, for the sake of these two wretched old people, it was good that the group wouldn’t have to wander through Hammer Ridge in the night. The beggars behaved peaceably enough. Once the earless man tried to seize hold of Ingrid as she went back and forth to the table, but Bjørn got to his feet at once, barking and growling. Otherwise the group seemed despondent and weary; they had struggled much and gleaned little, they said in reply to the mistress’s questions.","Sira Dag said she had a right to this now. Then she journeyed with the child to Sundbu and abode in Sir Sigurd’s ward until the wedding. That day month, just after John’s Mass,* the bridal was held; ’twas a brave and a stately one. The morning after, with great solemnity, Kristin Lavransdatter made over her keys to her son, and Gaute fastened the bunch to his wife’s girdle."
"Selve ordet for det, der gjorde mig sår, havde hun udtalt. «Også du,» – «du ligesom den anden,» eller «de andre».","The very word for what made me hurt, she had uttered. «You too,» - «you like the other,» or «the others».","The result of the meeting was that Gaute won Jofrid but received little more than what she had brought in her sacks when she arrived at Jørundgaard. But he gave her documents for almost all that he owned as betrothal and wedding gifts, and his brothers gave their assent. One day he would acquire great riches from her—provided their marriage was not childless, said Ivar Gjesling with a laugh, and the other men laughed too.","“Ay,” said Jofrid, in a low voice, with smothered rage. “Think you, if I were not, I would bemoan me like this?” “Are you in pain, my Jofrid —?” he began again. “Sure you can see it — stand not there gaping like an oaf, boy!”"
– Vil også du pine mig?,- Will you torment me too?,"But she too had once been young, when she lay and warmed herself with the heat of her own body; her mother’s body and soul had also been marked in her youth by carrying and giving birth to her children.",— she heard the boy’s even breathing from the other bed.
Men samme dag kom hun.,But the same day she came.,"The young people saw that Kristin had no more to say to them, and a few minutes later they took their leave.",All at once there came from without a child’s
"– Det gjør Dem ondt, at jeg bruger et sådant udtryk? Jeg trode …",- Does it hurt you that I use such an expression? I thought…,"Otherwise Kristin seldom had the chance to speak with Sira Eiliv, but she soon realized that the priest’s position at the convent was both a wearisome and troubled one. Although Rein was a wealthy cloister and the order included only half as many members as it could have supported, the nuns’ money matters were in great disarray, and they had difficulty managing their expenses.","Now she was thirty years old, and sadly frail, but she had a lovesome face, and from the first day she came to the cloister Kristin took great joy in serving her, for she deemed that Sister Turid minded her of her own little sister Ulvhild, who died so young."
Fra denne tid har jeg fåt en overtro på blomster.,From this time I have gained a superstition about flowers.,"“That is not so, Mother, but Jørundgaard is no longer a grand estate belonging to a royal retainer and wealthy man as it was in the time of your father and mother.",Kristin laughed.
"Og så blev jeg så dødsensræd, da jeg forstod, at det var du, hvem gud havde skabt mig for. For jeg kunde jo ikke tro, at ikke alt var for sent, jeg kunde ikke tro, at det høieste endnu kunde komme.","And then I became so scared to death when I realized that it was you who God had created me for. For I could not believe that it was not too late, I could not believe that the highest could yet come.","Kristin went over there that night with a potion she had prepared in the pantry, and Sister Agata asked if she would stay and tend the fire. She thought she would have been hardened, familiar as she was with birth and death; she had seen worse sights than this. She tried to recall the very worst she had ever witnessed.",Those of a middle station lay and died in their own houses. On some manors every human being died. But amid all this the nuns had as yet made shift to keep up the hours of prayer.
"Hvem kan forklare det? Jeg havde gåt i frygtelig spænding. Og da han så selv nævnte ordet, så forstilte jeg mig. Jeg kunde ha spurgt, ha fåt vide alt.","Who can explain it? I had gone into terrible excitement. And when he saw the word himself, I imagined. I could have asked, had been told everything.","She too had trampled on her duties as a daughter and sold her honor since she could not win the man she had set her heart on in any better way. After she had gotten what she wanted, she became the most honorable and faithful wife. Kristin could see that Jofrid had great love for her husband; she was proud of his handsome appearance and his esteemed lineage. Her sisters had married wealthy men, but it was best to look at their husbands at night, when the moon wasn’t shining, and their ancestors weren’t even worth mentioning, Jofrid said scornfully.","the King himself had made their marriage — all was mirth, and none seemed to call to mind that the two young folks’ honour and welfare were still at hazard. But Kristin learned that Jofrid had not forgotten it: “The more freely and boldly they meet my father, the easier will he yield him,” said she. “And Olav Piper could never hide that he loves full well to sit on the same bench with men of the old houses.”"
Hun var blit som en ny inde i mig. Og et spørsmål var kommet op: Hvem er hun?,She had become like a new one inside me. And a question had arisen: Who is she?,"She laughed again. When she saw Kristin’s expression, she nodded stubbornly.",— Then had Kristin taken both the girl’s hands
Jeg kunde ikke tale. Som et kuldegys fôr en ny tanke gjennem mig: Hun vedkommer mig ikke.,I could not speak. Like a chill feeding a new thought through me: She does not concern me.,"The following day she set off along the paths through the woods on the mountain ridge to the little church at Vatsfjeld, which had been consecrated to John the Baptist, although the people called it Saint Edvin’s Church. The chapel stood in a clearing in dense forest; both the building and the mountain behind were mirrored in a pond from which a curative spring flowed.","Hail, all hail, Mary, rich in mercy! Blessed art thou among women, and blessed the fruit of thy womb, Jesus, who gave His sweat and blood for our sake —"
Og det vil jeg gi dig!,And I will give it to you!,"The sick were brought inside; they were mostly wealthy people who could pay for gravesites and masses for their souls in the convent, as well as those who were destitute and alone, who had no help at home.","Old Sister Torunn Marta let her rosary sink upon her lap, and took the hand of the little girl who stood at her knee:"
– Jeg er reist til byen.,- I've gone to town.,"Then Nikulaus had apparently openly disobeyed the abbot’s orders, accusing his brothers of depleting the cloister’s property through extravagant living, of indolence in their service to God, and of unseemly talk.",“Are you here?”
[18] – Og. Der sneg sig om i mig ligesom en gryende morgenrøde: Hvis hun var min! Hvis nu hun virkelig var min!,[18] - Og. It crept around in me like a dawning dawn: If she were mine! If only she were really mine!,"The sky was swept clean, a bright yellow and pale blue with only a few dark, windblown clusters of clouds hovering high above. But it was cold. Where she was standing the snowdrift was still frozen hard after the night frost, and between the buildings lay cold shadows, for the sun was directly above the eastern ridge, behind the manor.","She sat dainty and bashful amid the strange house-folk, ate little, and blushed brightly each time that Gaute drank to her during the meal. His face shone with pride and feverish happiness as he sat there in his high-seat. In honour of her son’s home-coming Kristin had spread a cloth upon the board and set forth two wax candles in candlesticks of gilded copper. Gaute and Sir Sigurd drank to each other without cease, and the old knight grew more and more wrought up, laid his arm round Gaute’s shoulder, and vowed to plead his cause with his rich kinsmen, ay, with King Magnus himself — ’twould go hard but he would bring Gaute at one with the maid’s affronted kinsfolk."
"Jeg følte, at der foregik noget i hende. Mens alt i mig higed efter at tænde hele mit selv, hele mit liv til et glødende blus, havde jeg en anelse af, at det hun følte strømme mod sig, det var isende, dræbende kulde.","I felt something was going on in her. While everything in me longed to light my whole self, my whole life to a glowing flame, I had a clue that what she felt flowing towards her was icy, deadly cold.","Kristin sat with her little grandson on her lap, thinking that it wouldn’t be easy no matter where she was. It was difficult getting old. It seemed such a short time ago that she herself was the young woman, when it was her fate that prompted the clamor of the men’s counsel and strife.","But at the same time as she lay there in the bed, she was standing without too by the house wall. Beneath her lay the country-side shining in the morning sun. ’ Twas early morning of a day between winter and spring — she drank in the sharp, fresh air — the wind was icy cold, but in it was a smack of the far-off sea and of melting snow; the ridges right across the dale lay in the morning sun, with snowless patches around the farms, and the crusted snow shone silvery white in all the clearings amid the dark-green woods."
"Da jeg kom til vort hus, kasted jeg en sten på hendes rude, der lyste. Hun lukked op:","When I got to our house, I threw a stone at her window that shone. She opened up:","She dreaded running into a whole entourage. She would have to seek out Ulf Haldorssøn, for he had been acting as her envoy with regard to the property shares she still owned up here in the north and that she now wanted to give to the Rein Convent in exchange for a corrody.1But",There was sunshine and a blowing wind; the part of the meadow that was not yet mown waved red and silky bright with seeding grass. Nowhere but in the Trondheim country were the meadows red like this.
"Det var som naturen blev større og helligere om os under vort samvær, vort liv fik en pludselig lysbrydning over sig, der gjorde det til det eventyrlige, enhver ønsker, at ens liv skal være. Og når vi gik fra hinanden, var det som med engang det hemmelighedsfulde stod mellem os, – [23] det hemmelighedsfulde, der dog er i livet, bag livet og omkring det.","It was as nature became bigger and holier about us during our togetherness, our life got a sudden refraction of light over it that made it the adventurous, everyone wants one's life to be. And when we parted, it was as if at once the secret stood between us, - [23] the secret which, however, is in life, behind life and around it.","“Oh no, Mother. You were much too hard on Gaute.” Jofrid propped herself up on her elbow.","Poor soul, doubtless she was striving to please her husband’s mother, thought Kristin, hiding a smile. At last they found an old brown kirtle which Jofrid thought would do, if she cut it short below and put patches under the arms and on the elbows. Naught would serve but"
"Jeg afbrød mig undertiden midt i. Jeg vidste ikke, om hun hørte mig. Det var som hun gik i en lys drømmeverden, og somom hun blot lod sig omsvøbe af min tale som af en fjern menneskelig susen.","I sometimes interrupted in the middle. I did not know if she heard me. It was as if she were walking in a bright dream world, and as if she was simply enveloped by my speech as by a distant human whisper.","The sound of a lur echoed from the hills: several shrill tones that died away and then reappeared. It sounded as if children were practicing blowing the horn. A distant clanging of bells, the rush of the river fading lazily away, and the deep sighs of the forest in the quiet, warm day.","Gaute was as open-handed as were all Erlend Nikulaussön’s sons. In his brothers the mother had called it wastefulness. But Gaute was a worker, and content with little for himself — had he but the best of horses and hounds and some good hawks, he cared not, for the rest, to live in other wise than the small farmers of the Dale."
"[78] Jeg husker, at jeg pludselig så ind i to øine, to barnlige, undrende øine med lyslokket hår om panden. Det var en kvinde af tusen, det var måske rent tilfældig, at hun vækked mig af mine grublerier, og dog står hun ofte for mig igjen, pludselig som dengang, og hendes barneøine trænger ind i hjørner af mig, jeg selv ikke vet om. Der kom et øieblik en rar ro over mig: der var en anden verden til, der var noget til udenfor den kvinde, alt hos mig leved i.","[78] I remember suddenly looking into two eyes, two childish, wondering eyes with curly hair around my forehead. It was a woman of a thousand, it was perhaps purely coincidental that she awoke me from my musings, and yet she often stands before me again, suddenly as then, and her childish eyes penetrate into corners of me I myself do not know about. For a moment a nice calm came over me: there was another world, there was something outside the woman, everything with me lived in.","Kristin listened to the last vigil mass, matins. She knew that the lessons of this service were about God’s miraculous healing powers as invested in His faithful knight, King Olav Haraldssøn. She lifted the ill child toward the choir and prayed for her. But she was so cold that her teeth were chattering after the long hours spent in the chill of the church, and she felt weak from fasting.","The close-packed faces grew paler and more weary as the wake-night wore on. Scarce one went out between the services, not at least of those who had places midway of the church. Between the nocturns they dozed or prayed. The child slept well-nigh the whole night — once or twice Kristin had to lull it a little, or give it milk from a wooden flask that Gunnulf had gotten for her from the cloister. The meeting with Erlend’s brother had stirred her strangely — the more so that every step of the road hither had brought her nearer and nearer home to the memory of the dead man. She had thought little on him in these last years, while her work for her growing sons gave her little time for memory of her own fate — none the less the thought of him had been ever, as it were, close behind her, only that she had not had the time to turn her towards it. Now she seemed to see her soul as it had been in these years; it had lived as folk live on a manor through the busy summer half-year, when they move out of the great hall and bide in the storehouse loft. All day long they go to and fro past the winter hall, never thinking of going in thither, though they have but to lay their hand on a latch and push open a door. And when at last some day they have an errand thither, the house has grown strange and almost solemn, because of the air of loneliness and quiet that has come to it — But while she was speaking with him who was the last living witness of the interplay ’twixt seed-time and harvest in her life with the dead man, it seemed to her that she had come to look out over her life in a new way: as when a man comes up on a height above his native place where he has never climbed before, and looks down from it into his own dale."
"Å (han sænked stemmen næsten til hvisken) vet du hvad det er: ha inde i sig hver linje af et menneske, sovne ind om natten med en af de linjerne, vågne op med den … og så gå og … gå og …","Oh (he lowered his voice almost to the whisper) you know what it is: have inside each line of a human being, fall asleep at night with one of those lines, wake up with it… and then go and… go and…","As she sat near the fire and rocked the child so the others could sleep, he moved closer to her and in a whisper began talking about himself. He was the son of a poor fisherman, and when he was fourteen years old, he lost his father and brother at sea one winter night, but he was rescued by another boat.","More and more often Brother Torgils was forced to stand still; he coughed so sorely ’twas pitiful to hear. Brother Arngrim held him up in these bouts, and after wiped his face and mouth, then with a shake of the head showed Kristin his hand — ’twas bloody with the sick man’s spittle."
Jeg turde ikke vække hende. Jeg tog hende så langsomt og forsigtigt jeg kunde og bar hende ind i hendes seng. Hendes øine var hele tiden fast lukkede. Men måske sov hun ikke.,I did not dare wake her. I took her as slowly and gently as I could and carried her into her bed. Her eyes were constantly closed. But maybe she did not sleep.,The monk placed his crossed arms atop the stone wall and buried his face in them. “Are you here?” “Gunnulf!” Then he moved his head so that he touched her knee as she sat there.,"— naught would serve him at first but that they both should give up their bed to her, and at last she was fain to accept with thanks of his proffer that at least she should take his place. Next day was Olav’s Wake."
"Men da et par dage var gåt, var der noget som begyndte at vifte henover panden. Tilslut kom der noget blødt etsteds derpå. Hvad var det?","But when a few days had passed, something began to wave across his forehead. Finally something soft came somewhere on it. What was that?","Those days during the summer and fall when all the sisters and lay sisters went out to work in the flax fields were like feast days at the convent, especially when they pulled up the ripe plants. Preparing, spinning, and weaving the flax and then sewing the cloth into clerical garments were the main activities of the nuns during their work hours. None of them copied or illustrated books as the sisters in Oslo had done with such great skill under the guidance of Fru Groa Guttormsdatter, nor did they practice much the artful work of embroidering with silk and gold threads. After some time Kristin was pleased to hear the sounds of the estate waking up.","There Kristin now sat alone, and spun. The nuns of Rein were famed for their linen, and those days in summer and autumn, when all the sisters and lay sisters went to work in the flax-fields, were like feast days in the cloister; but most of all the day the plants were pulled. The nuns were busied in most of their working-hours with making ready the flax, spinning the thread, weaving the linen, and making vestments from it."
"Og det voksed for hver aften. Hun havde ikke mere det ildfulde blik henad [68] nat. Når jeg kom hende nær, fik hun en sitren, somom hun var ræd mig. Gav hun sig så hen, var det så uendelig bange og bævende.","And it grew for each night. She no longer had the fiery gaze towards [68] night. When I got close to her, she got a shiver as if she was scared of me. She then gave in, it was so infinitely scared and trembling.","Gaute was a good farmer, a good husband, and a faithful father, a capable man and as honorable as most people. But he did not have the makings of a chieftain, nor did he have the inclination to long for what she had desired on his behalf. Yet he loved her enough to feel tormented because he knew she expected something else of him. That was why she now intended to beg for food and shelter,","While she sat by the blaze, lulling and hushing the child that the others might get to sleep, he edged close to her and began to tell about himself in a whisper. He was a poor fisher’s son, and when he was fourteen years old, he lost his father and brother at sea one winter night, but was saved himself by another boat. He had deemed this a sign and token, and besides he had grown afeared of the sea; and thus the thought came to him that he should turn monk. But for three years more he had had to tarry at home with his mother, and they toiled and starved, and he was ever afeared when in a boat —"
*,*,CHAPTER 5,"Down through Gauldal she took the paths on the outskirts of the parishes, for she thought that if she met folk from the great manors it might well befall that one or other would know the sometime mistress of Husaby again, and she was loath to be known, though she scarce knew why."
Men det er forbi. Det.,But it's over. The.,. . .,alms with her father’s.
"For andre kan jo ikke hendes breve være hvad de er for mig. For mig er hvert ord deri som vingeslag af hvide, store evighedsfugle, og som solstråler fra et hjerte i verdens midte, hvis hede slag aldrig ophører.","For others, her letters may not be what they are to me. To me, every word in it is like the beating of wings of white, great birds of eternity, and like the rays of the sun from a heart in the middle of the world, whose hot beating never ceases.","The children began talking eagerly, proud to have sparked the attention of the grown-ups. It didn’t seem to occur to them to feel pity for this poor Tore; he was a sort of outcast who roamed the countryside, begging, but never came near the convent.",“Is’t not better that one be offered up than that we should all perish —? This child here who is owned by none —” “Christ owns him. ’
*,*,Kristin could not deny that Jofrid seemed to be stronger and braver than she herself had been.,"He bought hides and food stuffs in the parish too, and in winter, when the sleighing was good, he sent the wares to Raumsdal, and on to Björgvin in the spring by ship."
*,*,"“Mother,” he said in a low voice, “do you remember that I once laid hands on you?","Then he grasped her wrists, gripped them so tight that she winced with pain — and the next moment he flung his arms about her with the same passionate, fearful, bashful tenderness as that other time."
*,*,Kristin laughed.,"Besides, then my kinsfolk would have this child of mine on their hands too."
*,*,“No one could imagine it who hasn’t seen it for himself.,Think on the time when you yourself were three-and-twenty winters old — would you have missed the years you have lived since then —?”
"[7] Den lyseblå fløielskjole! Hvor dog meget i livet kan knytte sig til en død ting, til en kjole, et armbånd. Menneskene gjør de døde ting levende.","[7] The light blue velvet dress! How much in life can be attached to a dead thing, to a dress, a bracelet. Humans bring the dead things to life.","Kristin carried the axes into the alcove and put them inside Erlend’s chest, where his bloody shirt lay, along with the axe he was holding in his hand when he received the mortal wound. Laughing, Gaute invited Lavrans to light the way up to the loft for his bride. The boy was both embarrassed and proud. Kristin saw that Lavrans understood his brother’s","But when Gaute Erlendssön came to church or to banquet in his long, green, broidered holy-day habit, with silver belt about his slim waist and great miniver-lined cape thrown back upon his shoulders, the parish folk would follow the young master of Jörundgaard with glad and friendly eyes. In his hand Gaute bore ever a fair silver-mounted axe that Lavrans Björgulfsön had owned in heritage from his father-in-law, Ivar Gjesling — and folk deemed it right good to see Gaute Erlendssön following in his forefathers’ footsteps, and, young as he was, keeping to good old country ways, both in dress, in manner of life, and in bearing. And on horseback Gaute was the comeliest man any could wish to see. He was a most venturous rider, and folk in the parish boasted there was never a horse in Norway’s land that their Gaute could not tame and ride."
"Jeg vandred om i alle værelserne, uden ophør, dag og nat.","I wandered about in all the rooms, without ceasing, day and night.",Kristin could tell from the sisters’ words that they knew little more about what they were discussing than what they had heard from the people themselves or from the lay servants who had been out in the parish.,"They were passing easy of belief, whether their underlings praised themselves or spoke ill of their neighbours — and she thought with anger of all the times she had heard godless lay folk,"
"Men hele tiden havde jeg en forfærdelig længsel hjem igjen. Jeg forestilled mig, hvordan hun skulde komme imod mig, kaste sig om mig, spidse munden, når jeg var langt borte.","But all the while, I had a terrible longing for home again. I imagined how she would come towards me, throw herself around me, point her mouth when I was far away.","When she rose before dawn and went to church, she knew that Naakkve and Bjørgulf would also be taking their places in the monks’ choir. So she would end up living out her old age with some of her sons after all, although not in the way she might have imagined. She took off her hose and shoes to wash her feet in the creek.","Then had it been the burden of her burning prayer, that might this poor, unhappy child but be made whole in body and in wits , she would crave for naught more — not even to be freed herself of the sore hurt in her back that had plagued her since ever the twins were born. She thought of Gaute, sitting his great iron-grey, a brave and goodly horseman."
"Han så på mig, – jeg vet ikke, om det var medlidenhed eller skadefryd, – så sa han:","He looked at me - I do not know if it was pity or joy, - then he said:","But they didn’t talk much with each other; Bjørgulf said almost nothing the entire time. He had become an enormous man, now that he was full-grown.",Yet they spoke not much together; Björgulf was silent well-nigh all the time.
"Et andet sted, der må det kunne ske altsammen. Ikke sandt, du? Et andet sted må jeg kunne bli ny, såat intet står imellem. Jeg føler det så deiligt og stort og klart, du! Og når det er langt ud på natten, så gjør alt det, som har været om dagene i det sidste, mig ikke ondt længer, det blir så småt, og det var jo bare netop, [109] fordi vi var så forfærdelig glad i hinanden, at det kom.","Another place where it can all happen. Not true, you? I must be able to be new somewhere else, so that nothing stands in between. I feel so delicious and big and clear, you! And when it's late at night, all that's been going on for days lately, it does not hurt me anymore, it's getting so small, and it was just that, [109] because we were so terribly fond of each other that it came.","But after she had finally persuaded herself to touch the dying man, the worst was over, and she helped as much as she could until he breathed his last. By then his face had turned completely black. The nuns walked in procession carrying reliquaries, crosses, and burning tapers around the church and convent hill, and everyone in the parish who could crawl or walk went with them. But a few days later a woman died over by Strømmen, and then the pestilence broke out in earnest in every hamlet throughout the countryside. Death and horror and suffering seemed to push people into a world without time. No more than a few weeks had passed, if the days were to be counted, and yet it already seemed as if the world that had existed before the plague and death began wandering naked through the land had disappeared from everyone’s memory—the way the coastline sinks away when a ship heads out to sea on a rushing wind. It was as if no living soul dared hold on to the memory that life and the progression of workdays had once seemed close, while death was far away; nor was anyone capable of imagining that things might be that way again, if all human beings did not perish. But “we are all going to die,” said the men who brought their motherless children to the convent.","She herself knew not that the nun-like ways and bearing she had fallen into in these two years were dropping from her more and more, and that she was growing ever liker to the housewife of the old days — as the flock of nuns dwindled, the round of cloister duties fell into disarray, and the abbess still lay abed, weak and with half-palsied tongue — and the work grew more and more for the few that were left to do it. One day she learned by chance that Skule was still in Nidaros — his ship-folk were dead or fled away, and he had not been able to get new folk. He was whole yet, but he had plunged into wild living, as had many young men in this desperate pass. For him who was afraid, death was sure, they said, and so they deadened thought with drink and riot, gambled and danced and wantoned with women. Even honourable burghers’ wives and young maids of the best kindreds ran from their homes in this evil time; in company with the women of the bordels they caroused in the inns and taverns amongst the wildered men. God forgive them, thought the mother — but ’twas as though her heart were too weary to sorrow much for these things."
– Slig kunde hun sidde og småsnakke.,That's how she could sit and chat.,"Gaute stared at his mother, open-mouthed.","but she would not have it when Kristin offered to steep her head-clout in warm water and to give her a clean linen cloth — the cloth, indeed, she took."
"Jeg følte et pludseligt stik i hjertet. Jeg [25] havde aldrig før havt en lignende fornemmelse. Var der andre end hun, der vilde kysse sådan?",I felt a sudden stab in the heart. I [25] had never before had a similar feeling. Was there anyone other than her who wanted to kiss like that?,"And because of his dislike for Olav, my sister’s husband, I think I will share in the inheritance with my sisters. If not, then my kinsmen will have to see to this child’s welfare too. And I know Father would think twice before he tried to take me back home to Hovland with a bastard child, to let me suffer his wrath—knowing me as he does.","But Jofrid was not one to whom Kristin could proffer help or pity. She could but quietly take the heaviest work off her hands, and, for the rest, treat her, both when alone and before the house-folk, as though she were by lawful right the young mistress of the manor. Frida was furious that she must give up her place next to the mistress to Gaute"
Som den kvelden hun havde fåt det silkeslaget. Hun vilde absolut spendere vin. Hun fôr fra mig uden at si et muk. Ind i en vinhandel.,Like that night she had gotten that silk stroke. She would definitely spend wine. She fed from me without saying a muk. Into a liquor store.,"I can’t send her away; she has no place to go.” Jofrid smiled scornfully. Then Kristin said, “She was the foster mother for two of my sons.” “But she wasn’t Gaute’s foster mother,” replied Jofrid. “She reminds us both of that fact as often as she can.","Kristin was somewhat uneasy for Gaute, who had not yet come back. But, truth to tell, she was never so fearful for him as she had been for the others — she had faith in this son’s fortune. A week later Kristin was coming from the byre late in the evening, when she was ware of some horsemen up by the manor gate. The mist billowed like white smoke in front of the lanthorn she bore — she went upward in the rain to meet the troop of dark-clad men in furs: was it not Gaute? — ’twas not like that strangers would come so late —"
"[3] Dette billede står så ofte for mig. Og jeg har dog ikke set hende dengang. Jeg kjendte hende ikke da. Da jeg mødte hende, var hun ikke smal om lænderne, men rig og yppig, der var ikke den evige flugt over ansigtet, der var ikke brysternes trods.","[3] This image stands out to me so often. And yet I did not see her then. I did not know her then. When I met her, she was not narrow around the loins, but rich and luxuriant, there was not the eternal escape over the face, there was not the defiance of the breasts.","Gaute tried to take her hand to lead her forward, but she pushed him away and came to meet Kristin alone. Gaute busied himself talking to the servants and giving orders to the men who had accompanied him. Then he cast another glance at the two women standing in front of the door; Kristin was holding both hands of the newly arrived girl. Gaute rushed over to them with a joyful greeting on his lips. In the entryway Sir Sigurd put his arm around his shoulder and gave him a fatherly pat, huffing and puffing after the strain.","But he had lain by her side upon the bed-covers once or twice, and they had talked together — Once she had asked him if ’twere his purpose to ask for her in marriage; and he had answered that he could not; he had vowed him to the service of Mary Virgin. He said the same this last spring one time they spoke together. And so she would no longer set her against her grandfather’s and her father’s wills. “It must needs have brought down evil upon you both, had he broken his vow and you defied your kinsfolk,” said Kristin."
"Pludselig kom en tanke op: Det var min fantasi, som legte med mig. Jeg var ikke sammen med andre kvinder end Rebekka, i lang tid havde alle mine tanker dreiet sig bare om hende. Jeg så hende i alt.","Suddenly a thought came up: It was my imagination that was playing with me. I was not with women other than Rebekah, for a long time all my thoughts had been just about her. I saw her in everything.","Sir Sigurd came at once to Jørundgaard, and he held Erlend Gautessøn when the boy was baptized. But as happy as Kristin Lavransdatter was with her grandson, it still angered her that Erlend’s name should be given for the first time to a paramour’s child. “Your father risked more to give his son his birthright,” she told Gaute one evening as he sat in the weaving room and watched her get the boy ready for the night.","Jofrid smiled mockingly, and on that Kristin went on: “She fostered two of my sons.” “Gaute she did not foster,” answered Jofrid. “Of that she is never tired of minding both him and me. Can you not have her"
"Derude står hun og hvisker noget, med sammenbidte tænder, fræser som en kat. Hun står på volden. Solen går ned. Vandet skvulper. Alt er ro.","Out there she stands whispering something, with clenched teeth, grinning like a cat. She stands on the violence. The sun goes down. The water is lapping. Everything is calm.","“But what if they don’t see things that way? And demand revenge for abducting a woman?” Sir Sigurd squirmed and scratched even more. “I suppose it’s an unredeemable offense,”2 he said quietly.","Kristin drew forth from under her shift the little silver cross. Naakkve took it from her hand; ’twas warm yet from his mother’s breast. Reverently he kissed the reliquary in the midst of the cross, clipped the thin chain about his neck, and thrust the trinket in under his clothing. “Have you memory of your brother Orm?” asked his mother. “I know not."
Hendes skjælvende ja! Som om jeg talte til hende om noget skjæbnesvangert.,Her trembling yes! As if I was talking to her about something fateful.,"Kristin sighed. Once she too had been willing to risk the same for Erlend, but she didn’t know whether she would have dared if his mother had been living at Husaby.",But the child died when a year old. Gaute grieved much when he heard of it; and Kristin felt ’twas a sore thing that she had never had a sight of her son’s little daughter.
"Det var længe, før jeg sov ind, og jeg lå og tænkte ustanselig på hende. Forunderlige tanker. Jeg syntes ikke jeg havde set hende endnu. Havde jeg følt nedad hendes kjolebryst? Havde jeg virkelig lagt mærke til hendes hånds tryk?",It was a long time before I fell asleep and I was lying and thinking about her incessantly. Marvelous thoughts. I did not think I had seen her yet. Had I felt down her dress chest? Had I really noticed the pressure of her hand?,"I most often get what I want.” Kristin woke up to pitch-darkness. The cold bit at her cheeks and chin; when she pulled the blanket more snugly around her, she noticed there was frost on it from her breath. It had to be nearly morning, but she dreaded getting up and seeing the stars. She curled up under the covers to warm herself a little more. At that moment she remembered her dream.","ere she herself knew of it: “God forgive my son the wrong he has done you, my fair child — come in, Jofrid — God help you both, as sure as I will help you all I can!” Truly she felt, the moment after, that maybe she had been somewhat over warm in her greeting to this woman she did not know. But now had Jofrid laid aside her outer garments. Her heavy winter dress of sea-blue, homespun wadmal was dripping wet round the bottom, and on the shoulders, where the rain had soaked clean through her cloak."
"Mens jeg sidder her og vil skrive det ned, da strømmer de ind på mig, når jeg vil gjenkalde mig billedet af det foryngede ansigt. Og når jeg vil huske på, hvordan sorgen kom og la glans over lykketimerne, [12] da atter ser jeg dette stormende unge i hendes øie, som er det yngste af alt, som er mer end ungdom, ny ungdom, evig ungdom, ungdom ved lykke, ungdom skabt af mig.","While I sit here and want to write it down, they stream in on me when I want to recall the image of the rejuvenated face. And when I want to remember how the grief came and shine over the happy hours, [12] then again I see this stormy young woman in her eye, who is the youngest of all, who is more than youth, new youth, eternal youth, youth by happiness, youth created by me.","Go out and wash yourself. You’re standing there bleeding into the dough,” said her mistress quite calmly. Frida met Jofrid in the doorway. Kristin saw from the young woman’s face that she must have heard the conversation with the maid.","Tis the time for killing goats — and the whole manor smelt of oiled goats’ flesh. The folk had eaten their fill and were happy; all summer long they had not tasted fresh meat save on the highest holy-days, but now for many days they had had the savoury meat and rich, fatty broth both at the morning and the evening meal. Kristin was tired, but in good spirits, after the first great slaughtering and sausage-making of the year, as she stood up on the highway and waved the fall of her coif after Gaute and his train. ’ Twas brave to look on — fine horses, blithe young men who rode with shining weapons and jingling harness; the high bridge, when they came on to it, resounded with the hoof-beats. Gaute turned in his saddle and waved back with his hat, and Kristin waved again with a dizzy little cry of gladness and pride."
"Og jeg så, at det var hun, som var blit borte for mig.",And I saw that it was she who had disappeared from me.,And so she was placed beside him.,Their ski sank deep into the big drift that ever heaped itself together right across the yard when ’twas blowing from the north-west.
*,*,"She had a round, thin face with a broad forehead and a small, curving chin.",The poor beggars who came in to her house had come to bid her go forth.
Jeg satte en stol ligeoverfor hende. Jeg greb begge hendes hænder og så hende ind i øinene længe uden at tale.,I put a chair directly opposite her. I grabbed both of her hands and looked her in the eyes for a long time without speaking.,"The poor beggars who had entered her house had come to invite her away. A will that was not her own had put her among that group of impoverished and ill people and invited her to go with them, away from the home she had managed as the mistress and ruled as the mother of men. And when she had consented without much protest, she knew that she did so because she saw that Gaute would thrive better if she left the estate.","So they took their way across the upland; but the fog was so thick at times that Kristin dared not venture down over the headlong tracks, with cliffs both above and below, that she remembered led down to the pilgrims’ shelter in Drivdal. So they built a fire when they were come to the top of the glen and rested there for the night."
"Vi har ved gud ingen ret til at pine os, vi har ved gud ingen ret til at pine os selv, mer end vi har ret til at pine andre.","By God we have no right to torment ourselves, by God we have no right to torment ourselves, more than we have the right to torment others.",But it would be a shame for Jofrid if she should now see that Gaute married her reluctantly and without desire.,but I trow you will welcome these two poor children in friendly wise?”
"Når jeg gik ud alene, begyndte jeg at bli rastløs, jeg kunde ikke gå længe. Der greb mig en frygt: Måske var hun nu, i dette øieblik, holdt op at elske mig. Jeg måtte hjem, jeg måtte se på hende, se hende se på mig, føle, at hele hendes væsen ånded mod mig og bare mod mig.","When I went out alone, I started to get restless, I could not walk for long. A fear gripped me: Maybe she was now, in this moment, stopped loving me. I had to go home, I had to look at her, see her look at me, feel that her whole being was breathing towards me and just towards me.","From there groups of pilgrims leave every morning during this time.” “Mother, Mother, don’t leave us! Now that we’ve taken all power and authority out of your hands, pushed you aside into a corner .","well you think that I am more saving than you deem befits the mistress of Jörundgaard. I know that you think this, and you deem that I minish Gaute’s honour thereby. Now I will not say aught of how I was afraid last night to take in this band, seeing that I was alone on the manor with my baby child and a few old parish folk, for I saw you understood it, so soon as you had come to sight of your guests."
Det faldt mig ind: Hun gråter.,It occurred to me: She's crying.,And every time she had been granted what she asked for—for the most part.,"— she said the words, and kissed the cross her father had given her, humbly thankful to feel that, despite of all, despite of her ungoverned spirit, yet had it been granted to her restless heart to catch a faint gleam of the love she had seen mirrored in her father’s soul, clear and still, even as the brightness of the sky was thrown back now by the great still moorland tarn."
"Men hvordan kunde hun så se slig på mig? Og hviske slig ind i øret mit, at jeg var den eneste, hos hvem hver fiber, hun eied, følte sig hjemme, og ikke mistroisk?","But how could she look at me like that? And whispering so into my ear that I was the only one with whom every fiber she owned felt at home, and not suspicious?","Hushing and caressing him, Kristin carried the boy into her house, but he screamed as if he were in deadly pain—and then stopped short in the middle of a howl. He recognized the box and horn spoon that his grandmother was taking down from above the door.","But, glad as was Kristin Lavransdatter of her son’s son, it vexed her none the less that Erlend’s name should be renewed for the first time in a base-born child. “Your father dared more to win his son his rights,” said she to Gaute one evening, as he sat down in the weaving-house watching her make the boy ready for the night."
– Det blev den sidste gangen jeg så hende gråte.,- It was the last time I saw her cry.,"consent and provide all the proper betrothal and wedding gifts, but in return Helge would have to accept Gaute and Jofrid with full reconciliation so that she would be given the same dowry as her sisters and share with them in the inheritance.","All at once little tears started out from beneath her lashes. Kristin had never seen a woman weep so strangely — she sat there without a sound, her teeth set hard; and round, bright tears — to Kristin"
"Flere gange var det, at hun så på mig med en dyb smerte i blikket.",Several times it was that she looked at me with a deep pain in her eyes.,"Yes, he even said bluntly that people thought one of the sisters had not remained pure.","A few days more, and she would be wending her way downward through Trondheim’s rich, green dales, following the river’s windings towards the great fjord."
– Elsker du mig ikke længer?,- Do you not love me anymore?,"If she was not meant to come back, then it was God’s will and useless to be frightened.","no, right she was not, after all; ’twas against reason to liken Gaute’s"
*,*,Waves of anger were still washing through Kristin’s heart.,3
"Det var længe efter, at han sa:",It was a long time after he said:,"Kristin saw that Jofrid now found it terribly difficult to stand or walk for very long, but she merely grew annoyed if Kristin told her to sit down and rest.","The country lay soaking wet, wan and black under drenching rain-showers, when Gaute rode into the courtyard next day about the time of nones."
– Hvad er det? spurgte jeg.,- What is it? I asked.,But Kristin saw that Brother Arngrim was otherwise a good-hearted and kindly man. He carried the ill child for long stretches of the way whenever he saw that Kristin’s arms were growing weary.,"She shuddered at the memory of the well-known places by the sea, where she and youth had gone about together. Erlend’s fair form moved before her sight, with changing looks and bearing, swift, unclear, as though she saw him mirrored in running water."
"– Si mig … har De kysset … har De kysset … ha, det er sådan en nydelig liden uskyldig en … har De kysset … den sidder på venstre side … har De kysset … lige under brystet …","- Tell me… have you kissed… have you kissed… ha, it's such a nice little innocent one… have you kissed… it sits on the left side… have you kissed… just below the chest…","“She was a good woman; toward me she was a good and faithful foster mother.” “Yes, I think she was more of a mother to you than I was,” said Kristin sadly. “You felt little trace of my mother’s heart when such harsh trials were placed upon you in your youth.” Bjørgulf answered in a low voice, “And yet I thank God that the Devil never managed to bend me to such unmanliness that I should test your mother’s heart in such a manner, even though I was close to it. . . .","“God bless her,” said the monk. “She was a good woman — to me she was a good and faithful foster-mother.” “Ay, methinks almost she was more a mother to you than was I,” said Kristin, sadly."
[66] Vi sad tause hver på sin side af bordet. Luften var fuld af minder om kys. Men det var som de blev til sår i mig.,[66] We sat silently each on his side of the table. The air was full of memories of kisses. But it was like they became wounds in me.,"When they made their way down to the countryside and wandered through Updal and Soknadal, Brother Torgils was allowed to ride part of the way, but he grew weaker and weaker, and Kristin’s companions changed steadily, as people left them and new pilgrims took their place. When she reached Staurin, no one remained from the group she had traveled across the mountain with except the two monks. And in the morning Brother Arngrim came to her, weeping, and said that Brother Torgils had coughed up a great deal of blood in the night; he could not go on.","Brother Torgils sat crouched together, with chattering teeth, striving to keep back his cough as he mumbled the words over after him. When she looked at the monks’ ashen-grey gowns with the sun shining on them, Kristin called to mind that she had dreamed of Brother Edvin — she could not remember her dream, but she kneeled and kissed the monks’ hands and prayed for their blessing on the company. The sight of the beaver-skin cloak had shown the other pilgrims that Kristin was not come of small folk."
"Å, livet er så ondt, det er så vanskeligt, så grænseløst vanskeligt at gjøre alting rigtig, sådan som det skal gjøres.","Oh, life is so evil, it's so difficult, so infinitely difficult to do everything right the way it should be done.","May God help Erlend. I fear he never had the wits to feel true remorse for his sins, but the sins that your husband committed against you—those he did regret and grieve over.","When, a little after, she came back to the cloister, Sister Ingrid met her at the door with word that one of her sons was come to greet her — Skule he called himself; he was at the parlour gateway. He was sitting talking with his boat-folk — he sprang up when his mother came to the door."
"Tilsidst var det som hun fordobledes for mig. Inde i hendes yppighed så jeg pigens tendre slankhed bugte sig, jomfruens undren mod det hemmelige glimted og glimted inde i det ansigt, som livets sorg havde ridset sine smerteligt deilige runer på.","In the end, it was like she doubled for me. Inside her opulence I saw the girl's tenderness slimming, the virgin's wonder against the secret glistened and glistened inside the face on which the sorrow of life had scratched its painfully delicious runes.",Mother . . . ”,"Once or twice during the night Björn growled, but else all was still. A little after midnight the dog ran to the door and gave a couple of short barks — Kristin heard hoof-beats in the courtyard, and knew that ’twas Gaute coming home. She guessed that Jofrid had sent word to him. Kristin filled the beggars’ wallets well the next morning; and they were gone but a little way beyond the manor gate when she saw Jofrid and Gaute making for her house."
Jeg må arbeide. Men ud af dokumenterne stiger stundom en undren: Hvad vil der ske?,I have to work. But from the documents sometimes a wonder arises: What will happen?,". . .” “Tell us what you mean, Magnhild.",Then she made a sign to Kristin to speak. Kristin said:
"Hvorfor kan jeg aldrig få fred for det brystet? Hvorfor skal vi ha bryst, vi kvinder?","Why can I never have peace for that chest? Why should we have breasts, we women?","But an odd heavy bathhouse heat hung on, quite unusual for that region down by the fjord and particularly at that time of year. It was two days before the Feast of the Birth of Mary.","For some days now this unwonted weather had held — windless, with a thick mist, that showed a strange leaden blue out over the sea and away against the hill-sides, when now and again it thinned so much that the eye caught glimpses of the country round. Between-whiles it thickened to a drizzling rain; then again it lightened so much that a whitish patch showed where the sun hung amid the towering mists."
– Vi har aldrig set noget så vakkert. Der gives dog endnu lykke i verden.,"- We've never seen anything so beautiful. However, happiness is still given in the world.","“That may well be,” said Kristin curtly. And yet she wasn’t pleased that Jofrid should jest about such a thing.","“A good regale for him that bears good tidings,” said the mistress, smiling. “Ay, let us hear what you will say when you have heard my news to an end,” he said, most ruefully."
– Jeg har et værelse her lige i nærheden.,- I have a room right here nearby.,"Kristin had seen the church tower above the trees when she sailed past with Erlend, and he had said several times they ought to pay a visit to this convent, which his ancestor had founded, but nothing had ever come of it.","By the hearth her father was sitting, binding arrow-heads on the shafts — he had his lap full of bunches of sinew string, and on either side of him on the bench lay piles of arrow-heads and sharpened shafts."
"Å, du vil intet få vide! Folk vet intet. Det som et menneske har levet, det vet ingen. Det, der føles mellem to, har ingen greie på.","Oh, you will know nothing! People know nothing. What a human being has lived, no one knows. What feels between two has no bearing.","Ivar was well; he and his wife had two small sons at Rognheim, Erlend and Gamal, both handsome children. “At Jørundgaard I arrived for a christening feast. And Jofrid and Gaute said that since you were now dead to the world, they would name their little maiden after you; Jofrid is so proud of the fact that you’re her mother-in-law. Yes, you may laugh, but now that the two of you don’t have to live on the same manor, you can be sure that Jofrid thinks it splendid to speak of her mother-in-law, Kristin Lavransdatter.","With Sira Eiliv’s words of the day before in mind, she saw all at once — fearful as she had been for her headstrong sons, and hard as she had often laid hand upon them by reason of her dread — yet had she been much less content with her children had they been meek and unmanly. Then she asked again and again of her grandson, little Erlend — but him had Skule given small heed to, it seemed —"
"– Jeg elsker dig, jeg elsker dig, om dagen og om natten, jeg elsker dig til vanvid.","- I love you, I love you, by day and by night, I love you to madness.","The sheriff was on his way north to seek out Gaute at home, and the maiden’s father and kinsmen were with him.",Over in the twilight of the bed she could make out the man’s naked breast and shoulders — Gaute slept without a shirt even in the bitterest cold.
"Forbrændes det for at danne noget nyt, større, herligere, hvortil det som var godt og lyst i jordlivet var emner, – eller er drømmen, drømmen der dukker frem af livets sorg, er den endemålet?","Is it burned to form something new, greater, more glorious, to which what was good and bright in earthly life were subjects, - or is the dream, the dream that emerges from the sorrow of life, is it the end goal?","Sister Kristin was standing behind them; her voice sounded strained. She had suddenly remembered that in her youth she had heard Fru Aashild talk about dreadful, unmentionably sinful measures which the Devil tempted desperate men to try. The children had been down in the grove near the parish church at twilight, and some of the boys had wandered over to a sod hut that stood there; they had spied on several men who were making plans.","“Go home peaceably and quietly, dear brothers — be sure that the reverend mother and these good sisters will be as merciful as their duty to God and the honour of His Church will suffer. But stand aside now, that we may come forth with this child — and thereafter let each man go his way.”"
"Jeg må også gå til mit. Jeg har en nat igjennem skuet mod det, der drog igjennem mig og tændte alle mine celler. Jeg har søgt at binde det sammen alt og se.",I also have to go to mine. I spent one night looking at what went through me and turned on all my cells. I have tried to tie it all together and see.,"asked the nun, again uneasy. “Shame on you, Magnhild, for spreading such loathsome, heathen gossip. You deserve to taste the rod for that.","Lady Ragnhild pushed her roughly behind her, tottered forward, and took up the lanthorn from the ground — no one moved a hand to hinder her. When she lifted it up, the gold cross on her breast shone out. She stood propped on her staff, and slowly turned the light upon the ring about her, nodding a little at each man she looked on."
*,*,Everyone did whatever task needed doing.,"“Here we cannot sit, I trow, while christened souls sell themselves to the devil at our very doors.”"
[4],[4],"On every stone along the water sat the black birds in the fog, uttering their hideous shrill cries, while flocks of crows more numerous than anyone had ever seen before settled in all the forests and groves and flew with loathsome shrieks over the wretched land. Once in a while Kristin would think of her own family—her sons, who were spread so far and wide, the grandchildren she would never see; little Erlend’s golden neck would hover before her eyes.",All the nuns stood up and followed.
"– Vent, så kommer jeg ned.","- Wait, then I'm coming down.","Late into the night she sat outside in the courtyard, talking with her host, and she was greatly moved when she saw that Erlend’s former subordinate still loved and esteemed the memory of his young chieftain.",She drew off her shoes and stockings and washed her feet in the beck.
– Hvorfor kysser du alle mine fingre iaften?,- Why are you kissing all my fingers tonight?,"And when she stood amid the dim forest of pillars and looked toward the candles and gold of the choir, the boys kept tugging at Kristin to show her things: from the colored patches of light that the sun on the rose window cast through the arches, to the gravestones on the floor, to the canopies of costly cloth above the altars—all things that were most likely to catch a child’s eye.","— it betokened the host, panis angelorum, and she took the bread of the angels at his hands."
*,*,“Do you mean you would presume to judge about such things?”,“Think you that you dare judge of such things?”
"Jeg kjendte så lidet til kvinder. Der kunde være dem, der ligned hende, der havde de samme bevægelser. Og kanske var der hos Bredo og mig noget fælles, der gjorde, at vi så det samme hos kvinden.",I knew so little about women. There could be those who resembled her who had the same movements. And maybe there was something in common with Bredo and me that made us see the same thing in the woman.,"Jofrid was already sleeping sweetly in her bed. “His love for old Sir Nikulaus was somewhat strained, but even so, he would never have shown his father such disrespect as to name his son after him if he were not lawfully born.”",wed?” she asked sharply. Kristin could not but laugh.
– Nei. Nei. Jeg vil ikke. Det er vansind at tro på lykken.,- No. No. I will not. It is insane to believe in happiness.,"“No . . . ” The horse snuffled against the priest’s chest. He stroked the animal as he murmured, as if to himself, “Ever since he was a child, my Nikulaus has had remarkable capacities for love and suffering; I think he has the makings of a fine priest.","Of that, I ween, you yourself can judge, sister — “And if so it be that Naakkve entered into the cloister more for his brother’s sake than from love for his Maker — none the less I believe not that God will let it go unrequited that he took up the cross for his brother’s sake."
"Men kunde det være muligt? Havde hun ment det slig? Havde jeg da aldrig tænkt på, hvor det vilde være fagert, om hun var min? Hvor alle stjerner måtte skinne, hvor solen måtte være til!","But could it be possible? Had she meant it like that? Had I never thought about how beautiful it would be if she were mine? Where all the stars had to shine, where the sun had to be!","Oh . . . Against her will, a sigh of lament rose up from her breast. She still had Lavrans; she could hear the boy’s even breathing from the other bed. And Gaute.","Twas thus her father had been at the beginning of a drinking bout — aglow with joy of life, erect and hearty — “Now has it so befallen with me and this woman, Jofrid Helgesdatter, that this day we are drinking our home-coming-ale, and have yet to drink our bride-ale hereafter, if God will grant us such good fortune. You, Sigurd, we thank for kinsmanly faithfulness, and you, mother, that you have welcomed us as I looked you would, out of your true, motherly heart — for we brothers oft-times said amongst us, you seemed to us to be the most great-minded of women and the kindest of mothers. Therefore do I beg that you will honour us yet further, and yourself make our bridal bed so fair and stately that I may pray Jofrid without shame to sleep therein with me, and that you will yourself lead Jofrid to the loft, so that she may come to bed in as seemly wise as may be, seeing she has no mother living nor kinswomen here —”"
Så ringed klokkerne og hun blev begravet.,Then the bells rang and she was buried.,"And then Kristin would think with indignation about all the times she had heard ungodly lay people, yes, even a mendicant monk such as Brother Arngrim, accuse the convents of being nests of gossip and the sisters of swallowing greedily all rumors and unseemly talk.","The very folk who came hither and dinned Lady Ragnhild’s ears, or any of the sisters’ they could get speech of, full of idle talk, would be the first to blame the nuns for talking among themselves of the tidings that reached them from the world they had renounced."
"– Jeg sad på en bænk, mens jeg tænkte [27] dette. Med ét faldt det mig ind: Det er denne bænk vi sad på, første gang vi kyssed hinanden.",- I was sitting on a bench while I was thinking [27] about this. Suddenly it occurred to me: This is the bench we were sitting on the first time we kissed each other.,"“And yet no one need wish anything better for you, my Erlend, than that you should take after him!” He picked up his child, now properly swaddled, and touched his chin to the tiny red face framed by the light-colored wool cloth.","“It becomes me better now, too, than a bare head, I trow,” she said, laughing a little. “That may well be,” said Kristin, shortly."
*,*,A few days later Kristin came out of the cookhouse and saw Jofrid cutting open several black grouse; there was blood spattered all over her arms.,"“He came not alone this time, your son —”"
Jeg trængte ind på hende. Hun sa mismodig:,I penetrated her. She said sadly:,Kristin felt a pang in her heart as she gazed after another woman riding between her two children. In her group there were two older peasants from a little farm in Dovre.,"So abashed was he, that in pity Kristin bethought her to say she had had a dream. “I think long, too, till I see your brothers again —” but at that she had to turn her away; she had not yet dared to confess to her own heart how she yearned and feared to meet her two eldest sons again."
*,*,"Sir Sigurd, on behalf of Gaute’s kinsmen, offered a guarantee that he would keep to this agreement.","they looked hard as pearls — rolled down her marred, brown-flecked face."
"Der var hos mig en stor rød tulipanknop, hun havde bragt mig. Selv havde jeg kjøbt en hvid hyazinth.",There was with me a big red tulip bud she had brought me. I myself had bought a white hyacinth.,"You were the child of a rich man and kept company with rich and powerful kinsmen; you made a wealthy marriage, and your husband took you away to even greater power and splendor than you had grown up with. No one can expect that you in your old age should fully understand how different Gaute’s position is now, having lost his father’s inheritance and sharing half of your father’s wealth with many brothers.","He was fifteen months old, but forward for his age, his parents thought, for he both walked and ran, and could say two or three words to boot. Now he steered his way straight for the little water-gutter that ran across the bottom of the courtyard and swelled to a purling beck when rain had fallen in the fells. Kristin ran out and took him up in her arms:"
"– Jeg husker, sa hun. – Jeg ser for mig, sa hun.","""I remember,"" she said. ""I see for myself,"" she said.","She gave him a fleeting, rueful smile. It was time now for them to say goodbye and for her to continue on.","Now it befell one evening, fourteen days before Olav’s Mass,* that a band of mumpers came to Jörundgaard, and prayed the loan of a house for the night. Kristin was standing on the balcony of the old storehouse — it was to be at her disposal now — she heard Jofrid come out and answer the beggars: food they should have, but she could not give them shelter: “We ourselves are many, and we have our mother-in-law living on the manor"
"Havde hun da ikke sagt, at hun var min?",Had she not said that she was mine?,"And right in front of her, where the shadows ended, the morning wind was rippling through the pale year-old grass; it moved and shimmered, with clumps of ice shiny as steel still among the roots.",Sigurd Eldjarn himself had not an enemy — ’twas his father’s shrewish temper and his own mishap in marriage that had made him so lonely.
*,*,"He chuckled and touched a finger to his lip, not necessarily to point out his injury; it might simply have been an involuntary gesture.","Ay, he himself had gone in Sir Bjarne’s train to Sweden, and thereafter to the war in Russia. His mother shook her head gently — she had known naught of that either!"
Der var kommet noget nyt i øinene. Jeg havde trot de var blå. Nu var de dybgrå.,Something new had come into his eyes. I had thought they were blue. Now they were deep gray.,"Gifts for the souls of the poor and strangers who had died in the parish, marriage contributions to fatherless maidens, banquets on the feast days of her father’s favorite saints, stipends for sinners and those who were ill who wanted to seek out Saint Olav. Even if Gaute had been much richer than he was, no one would have expected him to pay for such expenses. Gaute gave no more thought to his Creator than was necessary.","When his grandmother lifted him up with pitying words, he shrieked still louder, and when, with yet more sounds of pity and compassion, she bound wet earth in a cold green leaf upon the sting, his wailing grew fearful to hear. Lulling and caressing him, she bore him into her room, and he shrieked as though his last hour were come — and stopped short in the midst of a yell: he knew the box and the horn-spoon which his grandmother took from the door lintel."
*,*,"The calm and steadfast manner of the priest gave Kristin courage, or perhaps it aroused a sense of shame; she ventured out of the juniper smoke to lend Sister Agata a helping hand.",And then she had her hands full all day long — it stood her in good stead now that she was used to all kinds of work.
"Om morgenen, når solen hæver sig over [117] havet i et rødt, som gjorde den det til det blod, der vander jorden, – da fyldes mit bryst af trangen til at skabe, til at drysse om mig for hver jordlivsdag spirer og funker.","In the morning, when the sun rises over [117] the sea in a red, which made it the blood that waters the earth, - then my chest is filled with the urge to create, to sprinkle around me for every earthly life sprouts and works .","They were the worst men of the parish, coarse, ungodly fellows, and surely the latest calamity and despair must have turned them into regular demons.","The poor nuns bowed them terrified and weeping under the hail of his taunts, but they stood fast around their old mother, and she held the lanthorn high, throwing the light upon the man, and looking him calmly in the face while he raved."
"Så måtte jeg ile igjen. Jeg så intet mer. Jeg bare gik og gik. Tilslut var jeg i et gårdsrum, jeg så, at det var et gårdsrum, jeg så mig selv gå op ad trapperne, jeg stod i en gang.","Then I had to hurry again. I saw nothing more. I just went and went. Finally I was in a courtyard, I saw that it was a courtyard, I saw myself going up the stairs, I was standing in a hallway.","Then he nodded. After a moment the monk asked, “Did you know that Eiliv Serkssøn is the priest and adviser for the nuns at Rein?” “No!” exclaimed Kristin jubilantly. “I thought that was why you had chosen to go there yourself,” said Gunnulf.","“ ’Tis their father’s nature that is in them,” said Gunnulf bitterly. “None could look that my brother’s sons should find it easy to learn obedience, or that they should show steadfastness in the godly life —” “ ’Tis as like to be their heritage from their mother,” answered Kristin, sorrowfully. “Disobedience was the chief of my sins, Gunnulf — and"
"[97] Elskede! I disse nætter, som måske blir mine sidste her, hvor du gav mig livet, vil jeg skrive til dig og forsøge at forklare dig alt. Du forlader mig hver dag, og jeg er stolt, og jeg kan ikke komme til dig. Men om natten, når du sover, kommer jeg til dig og kysser dig på din pande, som jeg elsker.","[97] Beloved! In these nights, which may be my last here, where you gave me life, I will write to you and try to explain everything to you. You leave me every day and I'm proud and I can not come to you. But at night, when you are asleep, I will come to you and kiss you on your forehead, which I love.","He was now the head of Sir Bjarne’s guardsmen, and the knight had promised to regain for him several properties his father had once owned in Orkedal that were now in the possession of the Crown. But Kristin noticed that Skule’s big steel-gray eyes had a strange look in them as he spoke of this. “But you think that such a promise cannot be counted on?” asked his mother. “No, no.” Skule shook his head.","They had had to row the whole fjord, from the very mouth, ’twas so calm, said Skule. Then again he shifted a little in his clothes, and began to speak once more of his brothers. He had been an errand south in the land for Sir Bjarne this spring, so he could give her fresh tidings of Ivar and Gaute, for he had ridden up overland and made his way across the fells from Vaagaa home to the west country. All was well with Ivar; they had two little sons at Rognheim, Erlend and Gamal, comely children. “But at Jörundgaard I chanced upon a christening-ale — and Jofrid and Gaute deemed, as you were dead to the world now, they might name the little maid after you; Jofrid is so proud that you are her mother-in-law —"
"Hun var forsvundet. Men inde i mig gynged sig hendes lænd, flytted sig hendes fod. Jeg havde aldrig set det slig før. Hun havde blot været i min stue, siddet ved min side.","She had disappeared. But inside me, her loins swayed, her foot moved. I had never seen it like this before. She had just been in my living room, sitting by my side.",I know that you feel I’m more tight fisted than you deem proper for the mistress of Jørundgaard. I know that’s what you think and that you also think I’m diminishing Gaute’s honor by acting this way. Now I don’t have to tell you I was fearful last night about taking in that lot because I was alone on the estate with my infant and a few charity cases; I saw that you realized this as soon as you had a look at your guests.,"She waved with one of the child’s hands to Gaute as he rode from the manor. Then she set the boy down on the sward, crouched over him a moment, and talked to him a little, and then ran across to the new storehouse and up to the loft. Kristin stood still, watching her grandson — the morning sun shone so fair on the little red-clad child."
*,*,"Kristin didn’t deny that Gaute could stand to listen to what his wife had to say about many things; she was more sensible, capable, and hardworking than most women. And she was no more loose in her ways than Kristin herself had been.",Ale and mead now ran in rivers in honour of little Erlend; Gaute and Jofrid gave their guests as free and unabashed a welcome as had they been lawfully wed and
Hun kom. Men hun var blit en anden.,She came. But she had become someone else.,"But after she thought it over, it seemed to her . . . No, all the same, there was no use in comparing Gaute’s alms with her father’s.","— she flung down all she had in her hands and rushed out. Erlend stood shrieking, looking from his finger to a half-dead wasp lying on the grass, and back again."
"Længe før hun udtalte de ord, som jeg nu gjengir, var det som det skjalv og gråt i mig: Nu vil hun tale, nu kjæmper det i hendes bryst, hun kan ikke få ordene frem, hun presser dem frem:","Long before she uttered the words that I now reproduce, it was like the trembling and weeping in me: Now she will speak, now it fights in her chest, she can not get the words out, she pushes them out:",During this time the thought of her own mother often came to her; she couldn’t remember her mother except as an aging and melancholy woman.,The moan burst from her breast against her will. Lavrans she had with her still
"Der var nok stunder, da det sused og sang i mig, og havets bølger var i mig som solfyldte drifter. Da alt atter var helt.",There were enough moments when it hissed and sang in me and the waves of the sea were in me like sunny drifts. When everything was whole again.,"He placed the blame on the wealthy nuns in Gimsøy, who persecuted the poor friars with rancor and malice, and they had now brought a lawsuit against them. He spoke effusively about all their worst traits.","But higher up the upland mosses arched, brownish or yellow with lichen, inward towards the grey screes and the bare heights flecked with snow-drifts. Cloud shadows drifted over the Dale and the uplands, but northward all was clear among the fells; the heaped-up hills had flung off their cloaks of mist, and shone blue, one behind the other."
"Som sagt, hun interesserer mig. Hun hører til den type af kvinder, som jeg tillader mig at kalde for – mangfoldige. De er bedst, når man har dem på frastand. Når man koldt kan studere dem. Jeg har beholdt dette værelse, som jeg engang … af visse grunde … var nødt til at ha. Det morer mig sådan engang imellem at følge hendes færden.","Like I said, she interests me. She belongs to the type of women that I allow myself to call - diverse. They are best when you have them at a distance. When you can study them in the cold. I have kept this room, which I once… for some reason… had to have. It amuses me from time to time to follow her movements.","Even so, they and their convent had vowed tooth and nail not to submit to the authority of the archbishop; their conviction was so strong that they also refused to accept any advice offered out of fatherly goodwill. And the brothers of their order from Tautra and Munkabu, who had been priests at their church, had all been old men so that no slanderous gossip might arise, but they had been only moderately successful at managing the convent’s material welfare. When King Skule built the beautiful stone church and gave his ancestral estate to the cloister, the houses were first built of wood; they all had burned down thirty years ago. Fru Audhild, who was abbess at the time, began rebuilding with stone; in her day many improvements had been made to the church and the lovely convent hall. She had also made a journey to the general chapter at the mother cloister of the order, Tart in Burgundy. From that journey she had brought back the magnificent tower of ivory that stood in the choir near the high altar, a fitting receptacle for the body of the Lord, the most splendid adornment of the church, and the pride and cherished treasure of the nuns. Fru Audhild had died with the fairest of reputations for piety and virtue, but her ignorance in dealing with the builders and her imprudent property ventures had damaged the convent’s well-being.","Nevertheless, so it had been that, ever since the convent had been set up, few but the daughters or widows of mighty and high-born men of the Trondheim country entered there. But during the evil and restless days that had been in the realm since King Haakon Haalegg, of blessed memory, died, piety seemed to have fallen away greatly amongst the great nobles — now ’twas the daughters of townsmen and well-to-do farmers for the most part who turned their thoughts to a convent life. And they betook them rather to Bakke, where many of them had been nurtured in godliness and womanly handicrafts, and where the sisters for the most were come of homely people — there, too, the rule was not so strict, and the cloister lay not so far removed from the highway. Howbeit, ’twas not often that Kristin had the chance to speak with Sira Eiliv, and she soon saw that the priest’s duties and his footing in the cloister were both toilsome and ticklish. Though Rein was a rich cloister and the sisterhood scarce numbered half as many nuns as the foundation might well have fed, yet its money affairs were in great disorder, and it was hard put to it to meet its outgoings. The last three abbesses had been more pious than worldly-wise; none the less they and their convent had fought, with tooth and claw, to make good their freedom from the Archbishop’s obedience — so far did they go in this that they would not even take counsel proffered in fatherly goodwill."

I will!","“I’m not quite certain . . .” Kristin did not reply. Then Sir Sigurd continued, his voice imploring, “Gaute said . . .","At times it seems — but mayhap ’tis but that you spoke so much of him when I was little —” Naakkve sat on there a little while before his mother. Then he stood up: “Good-night, mother!”"
– Elsker du mig? sa hun.,- Do you love me? she said.,The next day was the Vigil of Saint Olav. Early in the morning Kristin went down to the skerries to watch the bustle along the wharves.,"She had a lean, round face with broad forehead and small rounded chin; she was sunburnt and much wrinkled under the eyes, but after all she looked not so exceeding old. So the boldest of the boys took to talking and asking questions to hide the sheepishness of the troop. Kristin felt she could have laughed — these boys seemed so like her own rascals, the twins, when they were small, though she prayed to God that hers had never been so foul-mouthed."
"Men så kom der noget ind i det, han havde gjort. Det var først et hode. I det samme jeg så det, stod med engang for mig den første aften vi havde været sammen, – ikke såmeget vor samtale, som heller det der foregik i mig selv, efter at jeg var kommet hjem. Hvordan jeg havde sagt til mig selv: Hun, Rebekka, er blit ny inde i mig!","But then something came into what he had done. It was a head first. As soon as I saw it, the first night we had been together suddenly stood before me - not so much our conversation, nor what was going on in myself after I had come home. How I had said to myself: She, Rebekah, has become new inside me!","Surely no one would believe that he has placed a sword blade in bed between us all these nights.” “Didn’t he ever seek out your kinsmen to ask for your hand in marriage?” asked Kristin. “No, we knew it would have been futile, even if Gaute had been a much richer man than he is.” Jofrid burst out laughing again. “Don’t you see, Mother?","But one thing was that Jofrid was ailing. Kristin had seen it, well-nigh as soon as the young girl came to the manor. And Kristin remembered that first winter when she dwelt at Husaby — she was a wedded woman, her husband and her father were bound together in law, howsoever things might go with their friendship when the wrong done came to light. Yet had she suffered sore remorse and shame, had been bitter against Erlend in her heart — and she had been full nineteen winters old; Jofrid was but a bare seventeen. And here was she now, carried off by force and rightless by law, far from her home among strangers, with Gaute’s child under her heart."
"Han sa det så dæmpet, og han sa ordet «tildøde» så langsomt og sorgfuldt.","He said it so softly, and he said the word ""dead"" so slowly and sadly.",“Surely it must have been yours?”,"She was small of stature, reaching barely to the man’s shoulder."
"Hun gjorde det ikke. Det var somom alt var slut. Der var noget stolt, fremmed i hendes øine.","She did not. It was as if everything was over. There was something proud, foreign in her eyes.","She would walk to Nidaros barefoot. Behind her on the path leading up over the castle’s summit several boys now appeared, gathering around the portal to see if they could find a way into the fortress ruins. When they caught sight of Kristin, they began shouting crude words at her while they laughed and hooted.","And she herself — not many women of her age, nigh to half a hundred years, were blessed with such health; she had marked it well on her journey across the mountains. Lord, give me but this and this and this — then will I thank Thee and crave no more than this and this and this — Never, it seemed to her, had she prayed to God for aught else than that He might grant her her own will."
"[81] Men nogen rival er jeg ikke. Jeg skal om ikke lang tid til at gifte mig igjen. Så De kan være sikker, hm!","[81] But I am not a rival. I'll be getting married again soon. So you can be sure, hm!","And the abbesses who succeeded her had not been able to repair that damage. How Sira Eiliv happened to come to Rein as priest and adviser, Kristin never knew, but this much she did know: From the very beginning the abbess and the sisters had received a secular priest with reluctance and suspicion. Sira Eiliv’s position at Rein was such that he was the nuns’ priest and spiritual adviser; he was also supposed to see about putting the estate back on its feet and restoring order to the convent’s finances. All the while he was to acknowledge the supremacy of the abbess, the independence of the sisters, and the supervisory right of Tautra.","And the brethren of their order from Tautra and Munkabu, chosen to be priests of the convent church, had ever been old men, that no colour might be given to evil speaking, and their guidance of the cloister’s worldly weal had been none too skilful. When King Skule built the fair stone church and gave his udal manor to the cloister, the houses were first built of wood; and they had burnt down thirty winters agone. Lady Audhild, who was abbess then, began the building of them up again in stone; much was done in her time for the betterment of the church, and the goodly convent hall was built. She had journeyed also to the general chapter at the mother house of the order,"
*,*,"They were very trusting, whether their subordinates spoke well of themselves or ill of their neighbors.","ay, even a beggar monk like Brother Arngrim, cry down the nunneries for dens of scandal, and tax the sisters with greedy swallowing of waif rumours and immodest gossip."
"Jeg glemmer dem aldrig, disse billardtimer. Jeg føler mig undertiden som da ha kridt på queuen, mens hodet vrider sig i ulidelig spørgen. Det var ingen klare tanker. Ingen rene smerter. Undertiden gjorde jeg mig bebreidelser. Det var øiebliksvis, at jeg så mig selv dybt under mig, ussel og foragtelig.","I will never forget them, those billiard hours. I sometimes feel like then having chalk on the queue while my head twists in unbearable question. There were no clear thoughts. No pure pain. Sometimes I reproached myself. It was instantaneous that I saw myself deep beneath me, wretched and contemptible.","She was sunburned and had many wrinkles under her eyes, yet she didn’t look particularly old. Then the most fearless of the boys started talking and asking questions in order to conceal the confusion of the others. Kristin felt so merry. These boys seemed to her much like her own daredevils, the twins, when they were small, although she hoped to God that her sons had never had such filthy mouths. These boys seemed to be the children of smallholders from town. When the moment came that she had longed for during the whole journey, when she stood beneath the cross on Feginsbrekka and looked down at Nidaros, she wasn’t able to muster her soul for prayers and devotion.","Another will than her own had set her in the company of the poor and sick, and bidden her go with them, away from the home where she had been the mistress and had ruled as the mother of men. And if now she obeyed the call without too ill a grace, she knew ’twas because she saw that Gaute would thrive the better when she was gone from the manor. She had bent fate to her will, she had had the lot of her own choice — but her sons she could not fashion after her will; they were as God had fashioned them, and their natures drove them on; striving with them she must be worsted. Gaute was a good farmer, a good husband and faithful father, a doughty man, and as honourable as most folk — but the stuff for a chieftain he was not, nor was he of a mood to long for what she had coveted for him. But he loved her enough to be troubled, when he knew she looked for more from him than he could give."
"Der var en egen betydning i de minder, der kom op, – de kunde dukke frem ud af et kys, ud af et glimt, hun trode at se i mit øie, eller ud af en tone i hendes egen røst.","There was a meaning of its own in the memories that came up - they could emerge from a kiss, from a twinkle she thought she saw in my eye, or from a tone in her own voice.",Then she noticed that Gaute was staring at her.,"The life of the body was tainted with unrest beyond all cure; in the world where men mixed, begot new generations, were driven together by fleshly love, and loved their own flesh, there came heart-ache and broken hopes, as surely as rime comes in autumn; both life and death sundered friends at last, as surely as winter parts the tree from its leaves."
– Råb ud over sjøen: Jeg elsker dig.,- Shout out over the sea: I love you.,"When Kristin made her way up to the stalls that had been put up near the cemetery wall—they were mostly selling food and drink, wax candles, and cushions woven from reeds or birch twigs to kneel on inside the church—she happened to meet the people from Andabu again.","All the bells of the town burst forth at that moment to ring to Vespers, and the boys all talked together, wanting to point out all that was before her —"
Jeg rørte ved hendes brystnål.,I touched her nipple.,She had not yet dared express in her heart how much she yearned for and dreaded this reunion with her two oldest sons.,It had been meant that she should have Frida Styrkaarsdatter to wait on her when she moved over into the old hall.
"Da jeg var gåt fra ham, var jeg i en underlig, ny stemning. Og med engang stod Rebekkas billede (vi kaldte hinanden forresten aldrig ved navn, jeg syntes ikke hendes passed på hende, hun syntes ikke mit passed på mig) så tydelig for mig, og [17] det var det sælsomme: tydeligere end når jeg havde set på hende selv. Og jeg havde dog holdt hende i min arm og set meget længe og nøiagtig på hende.","When I had left him, I was in a strange, new mood. And all of a sudden Rebecca's picture (we never called each other by name, I did not think her passed on to her, she did not think mine passed on to me) was so clear to me, and [17] it was the strange: clearer than when I had looked at herself. And yet I had held her in my arm and looked at her for a very long time and accurately.","She laughed and said, “Gaute courted her first, but when I came home, he couldn’t decide which of us he liked best. But Aasa was the one he had expected to find visiting Dagrun last summer when he went to Sogn. And he was angry when I teased him about her; he swore by God and man that he was not the sort to come too close to the daughters of worthy men. He said there had been nothing between him and Aasa that would prevent him from sleeping without sin in my arms that night. I took him at his word.”","When he looked again towards the two before the house door, Kristin stood holding the stranger girl by both hands. Gaute sprang towards them with a glad greeting on his lips. In the outer room Sir Sigurd took him by the shoulder, and patted him right fatherly, puffing and panting now the strain was at an end. Kristin had been taken unawares when the girl lifted a face so white and so lovely under the dripping hood of her cloak — and she was so young, and small as a very child. When the stranger said: “I look not that you should welcome me, Gaute’s mother — but now are all doors but this barred against me. If you will but suffer me here in your manor, mistress, I shall not forget that I am come hither without goods and without honour, with naught but goodwill to serve you and Gaute, my master —”"
"Så var det jeg kom på hans atelier. Jeg vilde helst fortælle det på en anden måde. Om det var muligt, i musik. Det smerter mig at skulle finde ordet, det nøiagtige udtryk for alt. Er det ikke at fordoble en smerte? Og er det ikke en synd at gjenta det som var? Det som var, det var, det blinked og forsvandt!","Then that was what I came to his studio. I would rather tell it in a different way. If it was possible, in music. It pains me to have to find the word, the exact expression of everything. Is not doubling a pain? And is it not a sin to repeat what was? What it was, it was, it blinked and disappeared!","She replied proudly, “And yet I don’t believe my son would think that way!” “No,” said Jofrid. “If he didn’t have me to think for him . . .” When she saw Kristin’s expression, laughter crept into her voice. “Dear Mother, I’ve had trouble enough trying to restrain Gaute. I refuse to let him commit any more follies for my sake and cause our children to lose the riches that I can expect to inherit from my kinsmen if Gaute can come to an agreement that will be the best and most honorable one for all of us.” “What do you mean by that?” asked Kristin. “I mean that when my kinsmen seek out Gaute, Sir Sigurd will meet them, so they will see that Gaute is not without kin.","KRISTIN avowed with all her heart that Jofrid was a woman who had good use of her hands. If all went well, then Gaute had been fortunate — he would have a wife who was as hard-working and diligent as she was rich and fair. She herself could scarce have found a more notable woman to step into her shoes at Jörundgaard — not if she had searched all Norway through. So she said one day — and afterwards she scarce knew how it was that the words had fallen from her lips — that the day Jofrid Helgesdatter became Gaute’s wedded wife , she would make over her keys to the young woman and move into the old hall with Lavrans. Afterwards, indeed, she thought it had been well if she had weighed the matter more nicely"
*,*,"Kristin said she wanted to go to Nidaros for the Feast of Saint Olav, and she asked her son to look after her chores while she was gone.",Kristin told of the mischance that had befallen Erlend: “Heard you not how he shrieked?”
"Da hun lå der med myrten om hodet, da havde det med engang skinnet for mine øine: Du var til for at være den, som kunde gi hende fred. Og du pinte hende tildøde.","When she lay there with the myrtle around her head, it had suddenly shone before my eyes: You were there to be the one who could give her peace. And you tortured her dead.","While she sat and did the milking, starving little children whom she had never seen before would suddenly appear beside her, and she seldom even thought to ask where they were from or how things were back home. She gave them food and took them into the chapter hall or some other room where a fire was lit or tucked them into bed in the dormitory.","As their eyes grew used to the darkness, the women made out the dim sheen of the withered leaves strewn on the path beneath their feet, and the faint light from the clouded sky above the naked tree-tops. Cold waterdrops dripped from the branches, and puffs of wind went by with a faint soughing sound. The roll of the waves on the strand behind the high ground came to them in dull, heavy sighs. At the bottom of the garden was a little wicket — the sisters shuddered when the bolt, fast rusted in its socket, shrieked as Kristin withdrew it by main force."
"Alt det andet er i en tåge. Sovekammeret. Ansigtet, som bøied sig over mig. Uh nei! Jeg tør ikke tænke på det!",Everything else is in a fog. The bedroom. The face that bent over me. Uh nei! I dare not think about it!,"Will you say that you punished your children if they scalded their hands when they picked up the boiling kettle you had forbidden them to touch? Or the slippery ice broke beneath them when you had warned them not to go out there? Haven’t you noticed when the brittle ice broke beneath you? You were drawn under each time you let go of God’s hand, and you were rescued from the depths each time you called out to Him. Even when you defied your father and set your willfulness against his will, wasn’t the love that was the bond of flesh between you and your father consolation and balm for the heart when you had to reap the fruit of your disobedience to him?","Think you, woman, child that you still are in your old age, that ’tis God punishing the sin, when you must reap sorrow and humiliation because you followed your lusts and your overweening pride over paths that God has forbidden His children to tread? Would you say that you had punished your children if they scalded their hands when they took up the boiling kettle you had forbidden them to touch, or if the slippery ice broke under them that you had warned them not to go upon? Have you not understood, when the brittle ice broke beneath you — that you were drawn under each time you let go God’s hand, and you were saved from out the deep each time you called on Him? Was not the love that bound you and your father in the flesh together, even when you defied him and set your wilfulness against his will, was it not a comfort and a solace none the less when you had to reap the fruits of your disobedience to him?"
"– Å bed mig ikke mere, kjære.","- Do not beg me anymore, dear.","Kristin had never seen a woman cry in such a strange fashion; without a sound, her teeth clenched tight, she sat there weeping clear, round tears.","No, no, she would not make things worse for the child up there —"
"– Atter så jeg i et blåt lyn nettet, livsnettet, over mig, under mig, mellem os allesammen.","Again I saw in a blue lightning the net, the web of life, above me, below me, between all of us.","And with this new view she suddenly found words to release both her bitterness toward Erlend and her anguish for his soul, which had departed life so abruptly.","“I deemed ’twas therefore you had chosen to enter there,” said Gunnulf."
"Å, det er morsomt … det er morsomt kan jeg fortælle Dem … det er den høieste vellyst! Den aller, allerhøieste!","Oh, it's funny… it's funny I can tell you… it's the highest lust! The very, very highest!","As a sign that she had renounced all command over earthly goods she had placed in Sira Eiliv’s hands her seal, which he had broken in half. Then she was allowed to wear the same attire as the sisters: a grayish white woolen robe—but without the scapular—a white wimple, and a black veil. After some time had passed, the intention was for her to seek admittance into the order and to take the vows of a nun. But it still was difficult for her to think too much about things of the past. For reading aloud during meals in the refectory, Sira Eiliv had translated into the Norwegian language a book about the life of Christ, which the learned and pious Doctor Bonaventura had written. While Kristin listened, her eyes would fill with tears whenever she thought about how blessed a person must be who could love Christ and his Mother, the cross and its torment, poverty and humility, in the way the book described.","Together with the other priest and the church servants, he dwelt in a little house lying north-east from the cloister. ’ Twas there, too, that the monks lodged who came out from Tautra on divers occasions. Kristin knew that, if she lived so long, some time, when Nikulaus had come to be ordained priest, she should hear her eldest son say Mass in the convent church. Kristin Lavransdatter had been received at first as a commoner. But after she had taken a vow of chastity and obedience to the abbess and the sisterhood, before Lady Ragnhild and the sisters, in presence of Sira Eiliv and two monks from Tautra, and, in token that she forwent all rights over worldly goods, had put her seal into Sira Eiliv’s hands to be broken in pieces, she was given leave to wear a garb like to the sisters’, but without the scapular; a grey-white woollen robe, white head-linen and black veil."
"Jeg gav hende mine tanker. Vi gik ude lange kvelde, da jeg talte uden ophør, – om menneskenes liv på jorden, om stjernernes dans, om dødens løndom. Sommetider[52] kjendte jeg hendes øine hvile på mig, og jeg syntes, det var så lidet, det jeg vidste. Sommetider følte jeg hendes hånd trykke min, uden at hun syntes at vide af det.","I gave her my thoughts. We went out long evenings when I spoke without ceasing, - about the life of men on earth, about the dance of the stars, about the secret of death. Sometimes [52] I felt her eyes rest on me, and I thought it was so little I knew. Sometimes I felt her hand press mine without her seeming to know about it.","She shuddered at the memory of the familiar villages along the sea, where she had spent her youth. Erlend’s handsome figure appeared before her eyes, shifting in stance and demeanor, swift and indistinct, as if she were seeing him mirrored in a rippling stream. At last she would reach Feginsbrekka, at the marble cross, and Nidaros would be lying there at the mouth of the river, between the blue fjord and the green Strind: on the shore the magnificent light-colored church with its dizzying towers and golden weather vanes, with the blaze of the evening sun on the rose in the middle of its breast. And deep inside the fjord, beneath the blue peaks of Frosta, lay Tautra, low and dark like the back of a whale, with its church tower like a dorsal fin. Oh, Bjørgulf . . . oh, Naakkve.","It might have happed in Kristin’s time, too, that the folk had to eat herring that had gone musty, bacon as yellow and high-smelling as fir-root splints, and tainted meat. But then all had known that the mistress would surely make up for it with some extra good titbit at another time, milk-porridge or fresh cheese, and good ale out of season. And when food came round that had got a bad taste and must be eaten up, all knew ’twas but the overflow, as it were, of Kristin’s bursting storehouses — and when folk were in sore need, then the abundance of the Jörundgaard storehouses was a blessing to the whole parish. Already folk felt less sure that Jofrid would prove open-handed in dealing out help in food, when the common folk felt the pinch of dearth. This it was that vexed the mother-in-law — for it seemed to minish the honour of the manor, and of its master. That even in this one year she herself had been made to feel that her daughter-in-law favoured her own part unduly was a thing that touched her less nearly."
– Vil du da endelig vide det?,- Do you finally want to know?,"There were also two younger men from Oslo, laborers from the town, and a farmer with his daughter and son-in-law, both of them quite young.",Gaute was set on bearing his mother company the first part of her way.
"For en kamp du må ha havt! Jeg har elsket dig så grænseløst derfor, at det har været somom brystet ikke kunde holde.",What a match you must have had! I have loved you so boundlessly because it has been as if the breast could not hold.,"The ill man bellowed with pain, rolling his eyes terribly, and finally thrust a blackened tongue all the way out of his mouth as his terrible cries ended in a pitiful groan. The nun emptied the cup into the fire.","Then Lady Ragnhild herself fell sick. Kristin had wondered a little that this woman had been chosen to an abbess’s high office — she was a quiet, somewhat peevish old woman, unlearned, and, it seemed, lacking any great gifts of the spirit —"
"Jeg havde git hende mit hjerteblod, mens jeg havde strøget hendes hår, hun havde suget af mit hjerte. Og jeg havde ikke vidst det.","I had given her my heart blood while I had stroked her hair, she had sucked off my heart. And I had not known.",Suddenly the wailing cry of a child pierced the air behind her. She threw down everything she was holding and rushed outside.,"Jofrid thanked her: “And vex not Gaute any more now, mother."
"Jeg stansed ofte og pressed begge hænderne for brystet. Jeg så ud over havet, og det var med engang blit så uendelig stort – det samme hav, som ikke langt derfra rulled forbi vort hjem, – jeg havde ikke set, at det var så stort, og jeg turde ikke se på det. Og jeg vendte øinene ind mod landet, men det var så uendelig vildt, og bag fjeldene var der et evigt mørke, – og jeg turde ikke se ind mod landet.","I often stansed and pressed both hands to my chest. I looked out over the sea, and it had suddenly become so infinitely large - the same sea that not far from there rolled past our home - I had not seen that it was so big, and I did not dare look at it. And I turned my eyes towards the land, but it was so infinitely wild, and behind the mountains there was an eternal darkness, - and I dared not look in towards the land.","“You haven’t been . . . no doubt you haven’t been very pleased the last few years. Mother, Jofrid means well; she has great respect for you. Even so, I should have told her more about the kind of woman you are and have been all your days.”","well I should give them their meat too. Never before on this manor have we denied a fellow-Christian shelter, when he asked it in God’s name.” “Do as you think fit, mother,” answered Jofrid, fiery red in the face. When Kristin had looked more nearly at the beggars, she well-nigh repented her proffer — ’twas not quite without reason that the young wife was loath to have these folk on the manor overnight. Gaute and the house-folk were away on the far meadows up by the Sil water, and would not be home at even; Jofrid was alone at home, with the parish bedes-folk, an old couple and two children, and Kristin and her servant in the old hall."
"Jeg har vel neppe nogensinde havt slig pludselig lyst til at lære et menneske at kjende. Lidt efter hvert kom også vi to til at samtale for os selv, vi gled bort fra de andre ved samme bord.","I have probably never had such a sudden desire to get to know a human being. A little later the two of us also came to talk to ourselves, we slipped away from the others at the same table.","She purposely spoke of it in such a way that Jofrid would understand she was not yet married when she looked at the burning church. “I suppose you hadn’t thought such a thing of me,” she said quietly. “Oh yes, Gaute has already told me: Your father had promised you to Simon Andressøn, but you ran off with Erlend Nikulaussøn to his aunt, and then Lavrans had to give his consent.” “It wasn’t exactly like that; we didn’t run off.","Her mouth was pinched, with close-pressed lips. “Gaute begged me to come hither — he feared, I trow, you would be ill pleased at this."
"Hun stansed endnu et øieblik, som vented hun noget fra mig. Så sa hun smertefuldt:","She paused for another moment, as if she was expecting something from me. Then she said painfully:","But then everyone knew that their mistress was bound to make up for it with something particularly good at another meal: milk porridge or fresh cheese or good ale out of season. And if there was food that was about to go bad and had to be eaten, everyone simply felt as if Kristin’s full storerooms were overflowing.","At home they were beside themselves with fear, when Andres came not to the midday meal nor yet to supper — they went out and searched the country-side, and at length Jammælt got word that Andres had been seen far north in the neighbouring parish in company with some folk called Krepp and Kraaka; he was carrying their little one. When next day Jammælt got hold of the boy at last, he said, after much asking, that he had heard a voice the last Sunday during Mass, while he stood looking at the picture painted on the panel before the altar. ’"
– Det er forbi.,- It's over.,"The scene shifted: a tidal shore from which the sea had retreated far away; rounded, light-colored stones, heaps of dark, lifeless seaweed, all sorts of flotsam.","The young folk understood that the mother had naught more to say to them, and soon after took their leave."
"[93] Kjære Tulla! Det er bare hos dig, der er ro. Når jeg sidder og holder dig ved brystet mit, da er der ikke mere. Så savner jeg ikke. Så håber jeg ikke. Så vil jeg ikke det, som jo ikke findes.","[93] Dear Tulla! It's just with you that is calm. When I sit and hold you by my chest, then there is no more. Then I do not miss. Then I hope not. Then I do not want what does not exist.","He had finally had a chance to meet all the old friends his father had talked so much about: Karelians, Ingrians, Russians. No, his splendid scar of honor had not been won in a war. He gave a chuckle. Yes, it was in a brawl; the fellow who gave it to him would never have need to beg for his bread again.","But he was the comeliest of men in bodily form, now that he was full-grown — he wore garments of a new-fashioned cut, tight hose and a small close-fitting kothardi that barely reached to the middle of his thigh and was buttoned with small brass buttons all down the front — it showed up in well-nigh unseemly wise his body’s supple strength. He looked as though he went about in his undergarments, thought the mother. But his forehead and his comely eyes were not changed. “You look as though something were weighing on you, Skule,” the mother ventured. “No, no, no.” ’ Twas but the weather, he said, shaking himself. There was a strange red-brown glow in the fog as the hidden sun went down."
"Du vet ikke, hvor det er forfærdelig stille her i huset om dagene. Jeg synes sommetider, at hele havet flyder ind ad vinduerne. Jeg selv sidder alene og forladt midt inde i verdensrummet med en frygtelig angst. Alt hvad jeg har gjort går forbi mig. Og der er en mørk stemme som spørger: Hvorfor gjorde du det så? Hvorfor gjorde du ikke det så?",You do not know how terribly quiet it is here in the house these days. I sometimes think the whole sea is flowing in through the windows. I myself sit alone and abandoned in the middle of space with a terrible anxiety. Everything I have done passes me by. And there is a dark voice asking: Why did you do that then? Why did not you do that then?,"His skin felt cool and soft and slightly rounded—still a child’s cheek, she realized. He was just a child, after all, this headstrong, quick-tempered boy. “Yes, I have, Skule—so completely, that God alone can understand, for I can’t tell you how completely I’ve forgiven you, my son!” For a moment she stood with her hand on his shoulder. Then he seized her wrists and squeezed them so tight that she cried out; the next instant he put his arms around her, as tender and frightened and ashamed as he had been back then.","she broke unwittingly into a little cry of fear. The priest set his teeth in his under-lip — she saw that his chin quivered a little. “ ’Twere best, my son, you should tell your mother. Better that we all make us ready to bear it, if ’tis God’s will this folk too shall be awaked by so hard a —” But Skule uttered a kind of groan and said no word; and on that the priest spoke: “Pestilence has come to Björgvin, Kristin — The great and deathly sickness that we have heard say is laying waste the lands in the world around —” “The black death —?” whispered Kristin."
"Det forekom mig, at der var ironi i hans ord.",It seemed to me that there was irony in his words.,"Clouds of frankincense billowed through the intoning church, where the radiance of colored sunlight mingled with the glow of candles; the fresh, pungent scent of incense seeped over everyone, blunting the smell of poverty and illness.","you have need of it, I trow —”"
"Men ak! så kom atter det andet igjen! Og uden at jeg vidste af det, var jeg kommet derop. Jeg stod i gangen, jeg hørte mit hjerte banke. Det hamred i mig: Dette skulde du ikke gjøre. Dette er ikke vakkert. Dette skulde du ikke gjøre.","But alas! then the second came again! And without knowing it, I had gotten up there. I stood in the hallway, I heard my heart beating. It hammered into me: This you should not do. This is not beautiful. You should not do this.","But when Erlend screamed and reached for his father, Gaute took him back and set him in front of him on the saddle. At that moment Jofrid came out of the main house. “Are you taking Erlend with you? Where are you headed?” Gaute replied that he was going up to the mill; the river was threatening to carry it away. “And Erlend says he wants to go with his father.” “Have you lost your wits?”","“Nevertheless I scarce believe that my son can think so!” “No,” said Jofrid, “— had he not had me to think for him —” When she saw Kristin ’s face, she went on, in a voice that bubbled with laughter: “Dear mother — hard enough have I had to fight to hold Gaute back — I will not have him do yet more follies for my sake, and part our children from the wealth I can look to have in heritage from my kinsmen, if Gaute can come to such accord with them as will be best and most honourable for us all —” “What mean you by this?” asked Kristin. “I mean that if my kinsfolk come in search of Gaute, Sir Sigurd will meet them in such wise that they will see Gaute lacks not kinsmen to back him."
[90] Hvorfor trykked min hånd hans? Jeg vidste det først bagefter.,[90] Why did my hand press his? I only knew it afterwards.,"But everything that happened during his youth—losing his father’s inheritance and the discord that he saw between his father and mother, which ended with Erlend’s death—all this caused him to lose his desire to live in this world. But I never noticed that it made him pious.”","All that befell in his young days — the loss of his father’s heritage, the sight of the discord ’twixt his father and mother, that ended in Erlend’s death — so wrought in him that he lost all heart to live in the world. But I could never mark that it made him godly —”"
"Det var ikke mange dage siden at alt [39] havde været så stille. Jeg havde ikke tænkt på, at hun kunde bringe mit indre i oprør. Og jeg havde ikke havt end den svageste attrå efter at kjende hendes veie og hændelser.",It was not many days ago that everything [39] had been so quiet. I had not thought that she could bring my inner self into revolt. And I had not had but the weakest desire to know her ways and events.,The morning sun glowed so gentle and lovely above the three storerooms across from her. Kristin felt as if she hadn’t taken a good look at them for a long time. How splendid the buildings were with the pillars adorning their loft galleries and the elaborate carvings.,"Twas not unlike, indeed, that things might go as Jofrid wished — she saw that she had had no need to grieve so much for the girl. She had grown thin of face now"
"(Så slog han om i dyb sorg.) Jeg går i parken. Jeg ser på hendes barn. Jeg kjøber sukkertøi til det. Der er noget af hende. Jeg stryger det over håret … En eneste gang … langt borte … jeg så kjolen, – det er bare hun, som går slik, – hun dreied om hjørnet, – jeg løb, – hun var borte.","(Then he turned in deep sorrow.) I'm going to the park. I'm looking at her child. I buy candy for it. There's something of her. I iron it over my hair… Only once… far away… I saw the dress, - it's just her who walks like that, - she turned the corner, - I ran, - she was gone.","Blessed are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus, who gave his sweat and blood for our sake . . . As she said five Ave Marias in memory of the painful mysteries of the Redemption, she felt that it was with her sorrows that she dared to seek shelter under the cloak of the Mother of God. With her grief over the children she had lost, with the heavier sorrows over all the fateful blows that had struck her sons without her being able to ward them off. Mary, the perfection of purity, of humility, of obedience to the will of her Father—she had grieved more than any other mother, and her mercy would see the weak and pale glimmer in a sinful woman’s heart, which had burned with a fiery and ravaging passion, and all the sins that belong to the nature of love: spite and defiance, hardened relentlessness, obstinacy, and pride. And yet it was still a mother’s heart. Kristin hid her face in her hands. For a moment it seemed more than she could bear: that now she had parted with all of them, all her sons. Then she said her last Pater noster.","Next morning they made a little troop as they set off up the fells in company. A priest, with his servant, and two women, his mother and sister, were on horseback and soon were far ahead of those on foot. Kristin felt a pang in her heart as she looked after the second woman, who rode between her two children. In Kristin’s company there were two oldish yeomen from a little farm here on Dovre. Then there were two younger men from Oslo, craftsmen of the city, and a farmer with his daughter and her husband; quite young people, these two; they were journeying with the young folks’ child, a little maid, a year and a half old maybe, and had a horse they rode by turns. These three were from a parish far south in the land, Andabu by name — Kristin knew not where it was. That first evening Kristin begged to look at the child, for it cried and whimpered without cease — it looked wretchedly, with a great, hairless head and small, slack-jointed body; it could neither speak nor sit upright yet. The mother seemed ashamed of it — and when next morning Kristin proffered to bear her daughter a while for her, she was left with it on her hands — the mother pushed on far in front; she seemed to be a cuckoo mother. But they were over young, both she and her husband, scarce eighteen years old, and she might well be weary of bearing a heavy child that was ever puling and weeping. The grandfather was an ugly, sulky, cross-grained man; but ’twas he who had been set on journeying to Nidaros with his daughter’s daughter, so he seemed to have some kindness for her."
"Vi sad ligeoverfor hinanden ved et lidet bord. Det var en kafé, hvor ikke byens mere kjendte folk gik. Der var ikke fler end os tilbage, og lamperne over de andre borde var blit slukkede.","We sat directly opposite each other at a small table. It was a cafe where the city's more famous people did not go. There were no more than us left, and the lamps above the other tables had been turned off.","But then Frida married one of the servants who had come with Helge Duk, a lad young enough to be her son. “It’s the custom in our part of the country for our servants to listen to their masters when they’re offered advice for their own good,” said Jofrid when Kristin wondered how this marriage had come about. “But here in this parish,” said Kristin, “the commoners aren’t accustomed to obeying us if we’re unreasonable, nor do they follow our advice unless it’s of equal benefit to them and to us.","A month after the boy’s birth Gaute held a great christening-ale, and to it his kinsmen gathered from far and near. Kristin guessed that Gaute had trysted them hither to take counsel with them in this pass — ’twas spring now, and he might soon look to hear news of Jofrid’s kin."
*,*,They always used to spend the feast days at their town estate and have guests staying with them.,Kristin Lavransdatter sat resting on a haycock by the wayside below Sionsborg.
"Det var en morgen jeg så, at hyazinthen havde bøiet sig henimod den kant, hvor [49] tulipanen med det grønne om stod. Jeg laved en pinde og støtted den op.",It was one morning I saw that the hyacinth had bent towards the edge where [49] the tulip with the green om stood. I made a stick and backed it up.,"But I dare not forget that I brought little more to his estate than the child I carried under my bosom and a heavy debt for my friend to bear because I consented to his act of force against my kinsmen. Things may get better with time, but I’m obliged to pray to God that my father might have a long life. We are young, Gaute and I, and don’t know how many children we are destined to have.","“Mustn’t — mother will be angry if you wet you —” The boy pouted — pondering belike if he should cry because he was kept from paddling in the beck, or if he should give in — to get wet was the deadly sin for him — Jofrid was all too strict with him in such-like things. But he looked so sage — laughingly Kristin kissed the boy, set him down, and got her back to the penthouse."
Også han søgte sig frem til den inderste krog. Jeg reiste mig. Jeg hilste. Ti det var Bredo.,"He, too, sought his way to the innermost corner. I got up. I greeted. For it was Bredo.",”1 Then they heard a door slam somewhere on the slope. The gray light of dawn began rising.,"“Mother!” For a moment she looked deep into his beshamed, helpless eyes. “You have not — you have not been over well content this last year, I trow — mother, Jofrid means well, she holds you in great reverence — but mayhap even so I should have said more to her, of what manner of woman you are and ever were —”"
"Det var mig som et rart kobberstik fra gamle, glemte tider. Øl og brændevin kom og forsvandt, opvartere skreg, smørrebrød dansede, mens folk i overtøi snakked, lo, gisped.","It was to me like a nice copper engraving from old, forgotten times. Beer and brandy came and went, waiters screamed, open sandwiches danced, while people in outerwear chatted, laughed, gasped.","Kristin and the farmer thought it must be some beast; then they heard stones falling, as if someone were walking across the scree over there, and another cry, like the coarse voice of a man.","Then she saw that Gaute was sitting staring at her. And she smiled quickly, as if in excuse — ’twas time they should say farewell, and she go on her way."
"Men jeg mærker, at jeg vil helst tilbage til de strålende øieblikke. Jeg fortæller ikke det som lå imellem.",But I feel like I want to go back to those glorious moments. I do not tell what was in between.,"Horror-stricken, Kristin pushed her aside. “Child, you mustn’t do this bloody work now.","Kristin stood waiting. “He has with him — ay, ’tis the daughter of Helge of Hovland"
"Hvor var det løndomsfulde, når hun [38] havde ståt derinde i fuldt lys, alt det der der havde boblet som de lette, vare sæbebobler i mine drømme, det var afdækket, hver linje åben, kjendt af en anden?","How was it secretive when she [38] had stood in there in full light, all that had bubbled like the light ones, were soap bubbles in my dreams, it was uncovered, each line open, known by another?","Then he caught sight of a big pile of wood chips, and at once he busily began strewing them all around.","And methinks, for all the love he bears Olav, my sister’s husband, he would be loath that I should not share with my sisters in the heritage."
"Jeg elsker dig jo, mit barn, jeg elsker dig jo af hele min sjæl. Forråder jeg dig, er jeg utro mod dig? Å, hvad skal jeg gjøre? Jeg må jo leve, mit barn, jeg må jo leve livet! Jeg har jo ungdom, jeg har jo noget deiligt inde i mig, som må være til! Å, jeg har såmeget, såmeget!","I love you, my child, I love you with all my soul. Am I betraying you, am I unfaithful to you? Oh, what should I do? I must live, my child, I must live life! I have youth, I have something delicious inside me that must exist! Oh, I have so much, so much!","No doubt Lavrans thought the same about you. “And your husband, Kristin . . . May God protect his soul. I know you have chastised him in your heart both night and day because of his reckless folly. It seems to me that it must have been much harder for a proud woman to remember that Erlend Niku laussøn had taken you with him through shame and betrayal and blood guilt if you had seen even once that the man could act with cold intent. And yet I believe it was because you were as faithful in anger and harshness as in love that you were able to hold on to Erlend as long as you both lived. For him it was out of sight, out of mind with everything except you.","Yet meseems it had been much harder for a proud woman to remember that Erlend Nikulaussön led you with him through shame and deceit and blood-guiltiness, if you had seen but once that the man could do aught with cold contrivance. And almost I believe, too, ’twas because you were steadfast in anger and hardness as in love, that you were able to hold Erlend fast so long as you both lived — with him ’twas out of sight, out of mind, with all things else but you. God help Erlend; I fear me he never had the wit to know true repentance for his sins — yet did your husband repent and sorrow truly for his deeds wherein he sinned against you. That lesson, we may dare to trust, has profited Erlend now that he is dead.” Kristin stood still and silent; neither did Sira Eiliv say any more. He loosed the reins, gave her a “Peace be with you,” mounted his horse, and rode away."
"Og for første gang fik jeg en tanke, som selv under den største uro og tvil neppe havde dæmret: Hun er en slet kvinde.","And for the first time, I got a thought that even under the greatest unrest and doubt had hardly dawned: She is a bad woman.","Kristin realized that it was unreasonable to expect the monk to know anything about her: the name of her husband or his fate, even if she mentioned her family name.","So she thought — but the little stony ridges along the pathway here were much alike. She knelt amid the bearberry vines at the top of the knoll. The summer evening was growing dusk — the birch-tree slopes on the hill-sides, the grey screes, and the brown stretches of marshland melted together, but, above the wide-stretched mountain waste, the evening sky arched its clear, fathomless bowl."
– Det er mig.,- It's me.,"All the lodgings were full, she was told, but then Aamunde, the owner himself, appeared and recognized her at once.",Kristin drew a deep breath.
"Det var ikke det, jeg vilde vide. Hvem er hun, langt, langt derinde?","That was not what I wanted to know. Who is she, far, far in there?","It was an early spring day. She drank in the sharp, fresh air; the wind was icy cold, but it tasted of the faraway sea and of thawing snow.","Short and broad were the features of her face, but the cheeks and the wide, strong arch of the chin made it, too, comely, and she had a wide, thin-lipped and bright red mouth with small, even teeth like a child’s milk-teeth. And when she lifted her heavy eyelids, her clear, grey-green eyes were like shining stars under her long black lashes."
"Det var en nat jeg gik op … Jeg fik ikke fred. Jeg stod op af sengen … af mit leie … Jeg gik op ad gaderne … der var en konstabel som sov, og en pige som var fuld … Jeg kom derop … Det var spøgelser … Mit livs lig … mit eget livs lig … lig … lig.",It was a night I went up… I did not get peace. I got out of bed… of my bed… I walked up the streets… there was a constable sleeping and a girl who was drunk… I got up… It was ghosts… My life corpse… my own life corpse… corpse… corpse .,"She didn’t find the spot, but she thought she did find the slope she had climbed up in order to watch as he rode away. And yet the small, rocky hills along that stretch of path all looked much the same. She knelt down among the bearberries at the top of the ridge. The light of the summer evening was fading.","Then she turned him round towards his horse, and laughingly smote him between the shoulders for good luck. She stood looking after him, till he sank from sight below the brow of the hill. So comely as he was on the big, dark-grey horse. She felt her mood a strange one — all things without her came so sharply to her sense: the sun-steeped air, the warm breath of the pine wood, the twitter of tiny birds in the grass."
"Den glæde, kvinden føler, når hun er moden og det går i brede bølger hos hende, sitrer. Den dugger øiet så mygt. Den er som månestriben på fjorden når den dirrer.",The joy the woman feels when she is mature and it goes in wide waves with her trembles. It misted the eye so softly. It is like the moon stripe on the fjord when it trembles.,"On that night, an eternity ago, when she had collected her gold in a chest to steal away from home . . . Most of what she had put inside were gifts from the parents she had secretly shamed and whom she was openly going to offend and distress. But if these were Jofrid’s own possessions and if her mother’s inheritance was only jewelry, then she must come from an exceedingly wealthy home.","Kristin bore with the woman and smiled at her ways, though she was often irked by her too — yet she sought ever to put matters to rights and smooth them over, when Frida had done aught foolish or had let her tongue wag too rudely. Frida took it greatly amiss that Gaute sat in the high-seat now, and was to be the master of the manor. Naught would bring her to account him for aught more than a witless youth; she boasted of his brothers, though most of Björgulf and Skule, whom she had nursed; and she scoffed at Gaute’s short stature and crooked legs."
Hun kom ned. Hendes hår flommed [72] om skuldrene. Vi satte os på en sten. Hun sa:,She came down. Her hair flowed [72] around her shoulders. We sat on a rock. She said:,"Aamunde used that word about him several times: young. They had heard from Ulf Haldorssøn about his unfortunate death, and Aamunde said that he never met any of his old companions from the Husaby days without drinking a toast to the memory of their intrepid master. Twice some of them had collected money and paid for a mass to be said for his soul on the anniversary of his death. Aamunde asked many questions about Erlend’s sons, and Kristin in turn asked about old acquaintances.","Into Nidaros she would walk barefoot. Behind her on the path up the castle hill some boys were playing noisily — they were hard at work below the barbican, trying to find a way into the tumble-down work. When they grew ware of her, they fell to calling down foul words at her, laughing and hooting the while. She made as if she did not hear, till a little imp — eight years old the boy might have been — came rolling down the steep sward and almost bumped into her, shrieking out some ugly words he had picked up in wantonness from the older boys. Kristin turned towards him and said smiling:"
"Og jeg skrev breve, hvori alle mine ord la sig på knæ:",And I wrote letters in which all my words fell on my knees:,"But as yet no poor supplicant had gone unaided by Gaute, although he gave fewer gifts if Jofrid was watching.",Howbeit one day Ivar Erlendssön said to his mother that he deemed ’twere
"[40] Jeg droges mod smerten, som man drages mod en gåde. Jeg søgte atter op Bredo. Vi sad sammen langt ud på aftenen. Vi blev mer fortrolige end nogensinde før. Vi sad nær hinanden, og så hinanden dybt ind i øinene, som for at lære at kjende hinandens hemmelige kummer eller fryd uden at spørge.","[40] I am drawn to the pain, as one is drawn to a riddle. I looked up Bredo again. We sat together well into the evening. We became more familiar than ever before. We sat close to each other, and looked each other deep in the eyes, as if to get to know each other's secret troughs or pleasures without asking.","And then Erlend forgot all about his sorrow and turned his face up toward Kristin, offering to pat and kiss her with sticky hands and lips. As they sat there, Jofrid came into the room. “Have you brought him indoors? You didn’t need to do that, Mother. I was just upstairs in the loft.”","“He loved not old Sir Nikulaus over much, yet would he never have honoured his father so little as give his name to a son not born in wedlock.” “No — Orm — ’twas after his mother’s father, was’t not?” asked Gaute. “— Ay, ay, mother, maybe this was no seemly speech of a son. But I trow you can understand that all we brothers marked well , what time our father lived, you deemed not then he could be a pattern for us in all things — but"
– Å. Intet.,- Oh. Nothing.,The chests on the gallery could wait until Ingrid came in. It had been intended that she would have Frida Styrkaarsdatter as her maid when she moved out to the old house.,She looks pale — but I trow you understand such things best — God’s peace and sound sleep to all in this house!”
*,*,"Most of this incident was never reported beyond the monastery walls, Gunnulf said, but Nikulaus had evidently also rebelled against the brother appointed by the abbot to reprimand him.",“Gunnulf!”
"Hun havde en stor gråtsjø i brystet, sa hun, som måtte få fosse ud sommetider.","She had a big lake of tears in her chest, she said, which had to get waterfalls out sometimes.","“You must be freezing,” she said.","And so, just after Michael’s Mass,* Naakkve and Björgulf journeyed northward to the Trondheim country."
Vi tændte tre lys i salen. Vinduerne var åbne.,We lit three candles in the hall. The windows were open.,“You’ve never had to go without food. . . .” And Kristin had to agree that this was true.,"The last thing Kristin thought, ere she fell asleep, close in to the fire, was that, should they make such short marches — and give an alms to the beggar monks she must when they parted — ’twas like she would have to beg her meat at the farms when they came down into Gauldal. The sun was well up already, and the morning wind was darkening the lake in little squalls, when the frozen pilgrims gathered about Brother Arngrim while he said the morning prayers."
Hvad er det hun vil?,What does she want?,"There stood Gaute, lifting down from her horse a woman dressed in a hooded black cloak.",She knew well what folk said of Naakkve in general —
Nu er der bare et eneste stort kys til i verden.,Now there is only one big kiss left in the world.,has served Erlend well after death.”,Beaming with joy she went towards him — but she stopped suddenly and caught her breath at the sight of his face —
"Hendes ansigt blev mer og mer sådan, [70] som jeg ikke havde set det, siden første gang jeg mødte hende. Der var kommet en rynke, der havde været borte, der var blit noget slukket ud i øinene, og ofte havde det over panden noget træt, tungt.","Her face became more and more like that, [70] as I had not seen it since the first time I met her. There had been a wrinkle that had been gone, something had gone out of his eyes, and often it had something tired, heavy over his forehead.","When the boys noticed the woman was speaking, they came bounding down, the whole pack of them. But they fell silent and grew shamefaced when they saw she was an older woman wearing pilgrim’s garb. She didn’t scold them for their coarse words but sat there looking at them with big, clear, calm eyes and a secretive smile on her lips.","She had not come to God with her garland, nor with her sins and her sorrows — not so long as the world still held a drop of sweetness to mix in her cup. But she came now, now she had learned that the world is like a tavern — where he who has naught more to spend from is cast out at the door. She felt no joy in her resolve — but it seemed to Kristin that ’twas not she herself who had resolved."
– Rebekka.,- Rebekah.,“Didn’t you hear him scream?”,You wot well that we know he was not that.
*,*,"As usual, Kristin had to agree that Jofrid was right—at first.",wailing cry
"– Det er nu alligevel mig, som fik det første af hende.",- It is now me who got the first of her anyway.,"On summer mornings it seemed to her sweet and lovely inside, but during the winter it was terribly cold, and she was afraid of the darkness among all the gravestones, even though she steadily fixed her eyes on the little lamp which always burned in front of the ivory tower containing the Host.","On summer mornings ’twas sweet and delightsome to her there — but in winter it was bitterly cold, and she was fearful in the dark among all the tombstones, even though she kept her eyes bent fixedly on the little lamp that burned always before the ivory tower with the host in it."
"Jeg er så rolig. Jeg er glad, fordi jeg skal dø, og du vil også bli glad, det skal du nok se, for så vil alt bli godt. Jeg er blit fyldt af noget jeg ikke kan sige, jeg synes næsten ikke jeg hører hjemme på jorden længer.","I'm so calm. I'm happy, because I'm going to die, and you will be happy too, you will probably see that, because then everything will be fine. I'm become full of something I can not say, I hardly think I belong on earth anymore.","There was a suffocating stench surrounding the sick man which the smoke could not mask: excrement, blood, sour sweat, and a rotten odor coming from his throat. She thought of Skule’s words about the swarms of lemmings; she still had a dreadful urge to flee, even though she knew there was nowhere to flee from this.","While she sat milking, she would find beside her suddenly little starving children she had never before set her eyes on, and she would scarce remember to ask whence they were or how things were with them at home; she would give them food and lead them to the shelter of the chapter-hall, or some other place where a fire was burning, then stow them away in a bed in the dormitory. She marked, with a kind of wonder, that in this time of calamity, when more than ever there was need that all should be vigilant in prayer, she scarce ever found time to meditate or to pray. She would fling her down in the church before the tabernacle when she found a vacant moment, but naught came of it but wordless sighs, and Paternosters and Aves uttered by rote."
"En aften blev dette så sterkt, at jeg afbrød spillet og gik. Det var mørkt, og mit hode var så fuldt af tanker, at jeg så ikke, hvor jeg gik. Jeg kjendte græs og stene under mig, og buske omkring mig. Jeg hørte pludselig en bæk sildre, og jeg husked, at det var dér, hun en dag havde drukket af sin hule hånd. Det var da, jeg havde set, hvor smuk den var. Solen havde [71] skinnet igjennem den. Om aftenen havde jeg kysset alle hendes fingre. Hun havde sagt:","One night this became so strong that I interrupted the game and left. It was dark and my head was so full of thoughts that I could not see where I was going. I felt grass and rocks beneath me, and bushes around me. I suddenly heard a stream trickle, and I remembered that this was where she had one day drunk from her hollow hand. It was then that I had seen how beautiful it was. The sun had [71] shone through it. In the evening I had kissed all her fingers. She had said:","All the bells of the town began pealing at once, summoning everyone to vespers, and the boys all started talking at once, eager to point out to her everything in sight. She couldn’t see Tautra because a squall was blowing across the fjord toward Frosta, bringing fog and torrents of rain. Surrounded by the group of boys, she made her way down the steep paths through the Steinberg cliffs, as cowbells began ringing and herders shouted from all sides. The cows were heading home from the town pastures. At the gate in the town ramparts near Nidareid, Kristin and her young companions had to wait while the livestock was driven through. The herders hooted and yelled and scolded, the oxen butted, the cows jostled each other, and the boys told her who owned each and every bull. When they finally went through the gate and walked toward the fenced lanes, Kristin had more than enough to do watching where she set her bare feet between the cow dung in the churned-up track. Without asking, a few of the boys followed her all the way to Christ Church.","Therefore was she now minded to beg for harbour and sanctuary; though ’twas bitter to her pride to come in such utter poverty that she could bring no offerings in her hands. But she knew that she was called to come. The fir woods on the knoll stood drinking in the sunlight that sifted through them, and sighing so gently; the little church lay there shut and silent, breathing forth a smell of tar. Yearningly Kristin thought of the dead monk who had taken her hand and led her into the radiance of God’s enfolding love when she was an innocent child; had put forth a hand time after time to lead her home from the paths of transgression, both while he lived on earth and since — And of a sudden she remembered as clear as day what she had dreamed of him that night upon the fell: She had dreamed that she stood in the sunshine in the courtyard of some great manor, and Brother Edvin came towards her from the hall-house door. His hands were full of bread, and, when he came to her, he broke off a great piece and gave it her — she understood that she had had to do as she had thought, beg for alms when she came down into the parishes; but in some way or other she had joined company with Brother Edvin, and they two were faring on together, begging — But at the same time she knew that the dream had a two-fold meaning: the manor was not only a great manor, but it seemed to her to betoken a holy place, and Brother Edvin was one of the household there; and the bread which he brought and gave to her was not the simple bannock it looked like"
"Hvorfor ser jeg da nu, da jeg søger at fremmane for mig hendes billede, netop dette for mig, dette som jeg ikke kjendte? Er det fordi jeg så godt husker, hvordan hun en morgen løfted den nøgne arm høit op mod taget – hun hæved sig pludselig, hun løfted armen, alle hendes ansigts muskler strammed sig – var også det dette: Jeg vil! Jeg vil!","Why then do I see now, when I seek to evoke in me her image, precisely this for me, this which I did not know? Is it because I remember so well how one morning she lifted her naked arm high up against the roof - she suddenly raised herself, she lifted her arm, all the muscles of her face tightened - was also this: I will! I will!","Then the girl said, “I do not expect to be welcomed by you, Gaute’s mother, but now all doors have been closed to me except this one. If you will tolerate my presence here on the manor, mistress, then I will never forget that I arrived here without property or honor, but with good intentions to serve you and Gaute, my lord.” Before she knew it, Kristin had taken the girl’s hands and said, “May God forgive my son for what he has brought upon you, my fair child. Come in, Jofrid.","“Ay, I like Haavard well,” said the girl — and then burst into bitter weeping. Kristin comforted her with such words as were fitting in the mouth of an old and a staid woman. Her own heart ached with yearning — she had so gladly called this good, fresh child her daughter. After Ivar’s wedding she stayed a while at Rognheim."
"Der var en kvinde der vil kysse. Det er som hele hendes legeme vil samle sig i kysset, hun vil kysse, som en tiger springer på sit bytte. Det er som hendes læber siger uden ord: Nu vil jeg kysse, nu vet jeg ikke om jeg i mit liv kommer til at kysse flere gange, og derfor vil jeg kysse, – jeg vil, jeg vil.","There was a woman who wanted to kiss. It's like her whole body will gather in the kiss, she will kiss like a tiger jumping on its prey. It's like her lips saying without words: Now I want to kiss, now I do not know if I will kiss several times in my life, and therefore I want to kiss, - I want, I want.","“I don’t know the law very well in such cases,” she said somberly. “But I’m not certain, Jofrid, that it will be easy for Gaute to obtain what you would consider a good reconciliation. If Gaute is sentenced as an outlaw, and your father takes you back home and lets you suffer his wrath, or if he demands that you enter a convent to atone for your sins . . .” “He can’t send me to a convent without sending splendid gifts along with me, and it will be less costly and more honorable if he reconciles with Gaute and demands restitution. You see, then he won’t have to give up any cattle when he marries me off.","Kristin prayed instantly for a good issue to Gaute’s deed of madness — and she comforted her with the thought that ’twas impossible God’s justice could deal out to Gaute and Jofrid a harder lot than had fallen to her and Erlend — and they had been wedded; their child of sin was born to be lawful partaker in all his kindred’s heritage. Since neither Gaute nor Jofrid spoke of the matter, Kristin would not bring it forward, albeit she longed to speak to the unlessoned young girl : Jofrid ought to save her strength now, lie long in the morning and rest instead of being up and about the first of all on the manor — for Kristin marked that the girl had set her heart on being up before her mother-in-law, and doing more than she did."
Ved gud om vi har!,God knows if we have!,One day during Lent Kristin and Jofrid were preparing sacks of provisions for the woodcutters.,Kristin nodded again.
"Det var som jeg snakked i søvne, da jeg sa det.",It was like I was talking in my sleep when I said that.,"The life suited him, he said with a laugh.",Sir Bjarne has kept all he promised when I took service with him — calls me kinsman and friend. Almost I have the like place in his household that Ulf had at home with us” — he laughed; and the laugh became his marred face ill.
[42] – Jeg går. Og jeg kommer ikke mer igjen.,[42] - I'm leaving. And I'll not come again.,"But the old mistress noticed it just the same. Sometimes it had also happened in Kristin’s day that the servants were forced to eat herring that was sour, or bacon as yellow and rancid as a resinous pine torch, or spoiled meat.","There he sat waiting for many hours — at last there came over the bridge three beggars, an old man and a young woman, with a suckling-child. Andres goes up to them, gives them the trinkets, and begs leave to bear the child for the woman."
"Hvorfor netop den? Hvordan var det gåt til, at jeg uden at sanse det netop var kommet derud?","Why exactly that? How had it happened that I, without sensing it, had just gotten out there?","“This gifted and promising boy, Erlend Gautessøn of Jørundgaard—you should tell your grandmother that you aren’t afraid your father will fail you.” He made the sign of the cross over the child and put him back in Kristin’s arms, then went over to the bed and looked down at the slumbering young mother.","She could not understand that, as things stood with her, Jofrid would jest about it. Some days after, Kristin came out to the kitchen-house, and saw Jofrid standing there cleaning some black game — already blood had spurted up over her arms."
"En frygt, der kunde stige til fortvilelse, [58] kunde komme over mig, forat hun skulde forlade mig, at jeg en eller anden aften, når jeg kom hjem, skulde finde huset tomt.","A fear that might rise to despair, [58] might come over me, lest she should leave me, that one evening, when I came home, I should find the house empty.",She stood gazing after him until he disappeared beneath the cliff.,"— You must believe, mother-in-law, I have no other thought in all I do but for the good of my husband and our children —”"
"Hvis det var så, måtte jeg så ikke hade ham? Måtte jeg ikke hade hende, som ikke var åben mod mig? Måtte jeg ikke hade hele livet, som brugte mig til at spille terning med?","If so, did I not hate him? May I not hate her who was not open to me? May I not hate the whole life that used me to play dice with?","Then he heard a voice, the gen tlest and sweetest voice in the world, and it promised to show him a sign if he would go out to Bjerkheim Bridge on a certain day. Otherwise Andres was reluctant to speak of his visions, because their parish priest had said they were partly imagined and partly due to a confused and muddled state of mind, and he frightened his mother out of her wits with his strange ways. But he talked to an old servant woman, an exceedingly pious woman, and to a friar who used to wander through the countryside during Lent and Advent.","Ulf Haldorssön, their foster-father, Frida’s loose talk — oh, strange it was not if these young men were weak in such things — Wed Jofrid Gaute must, if he could win her kinsfolk’s consent — and be thankful — but ’twere pity of the maid if she should see now that Gaute took her because he needs must, against his will."
"Kanske stod hun der nøgen. Det som jeg blot havde vovet at ane, som jeg havde syntes det var en brøde at gjætte, det stod derinde foran en andens øine, – ikke foran en mig fremmed, ikke en, hvis blikke kunde prelle af og være ligegyldige. Nei, ind i huden vilde de trænge, hver fold vilde de fange og forstå.","Maybe she was standing there naked. What I had only dared to guess, as I had thought it was a crime to guess, it stood in front of someone else's eyes - not in front of someone stranger to me, not someone whose eyes could bounce off and be indifferent. No, they would penetrate the skin, they would catch and understand every fold.","She lifted the child’s hand to wave to Gaute as he rode off from the estate. Then she put the boy down on the grass and squatted down next to him for a moment to talk to him a bit before she continued on her way over to the new storeroom and up to the loft. Kristin stood where she was, gazing at her grandson.","“See you, mother, father deems himself the shrewdest of all men at a horse-bargain. But ’twould take a man far more wide-awake than my father to get the better of Gaute Erlendssön in an exchange of horses —” Kristin could not forbear smiling — unglad though she was at heart. “I know not the law so nicely in such matters,” she said gravely, “but I misdoubt me much, Jofrid, ’twill not be easy for Gaute to come to such an accord as you will call good."
"Hun påstod, at det var bare kroppen jeg elsked. Det er nu min anskuelse, at det er det eneste, der er mening i. Det er noget forbandet sygeligt det andet. Den unge, friske elskov, det er kroppen det, krop som dras mod krop. Alt det andet bør helst være en lukket bog, la hende ha alt dette med sjælen og det for sig selv.","She claimed it was just the body I loved. It's now my view that it's the only thing that makes sense. It's something damn sick the other. The young, fresh love, it is the body it, body which is drawn towards body. Everything else should preferably be a closed book, let her have all this with the soul and that for herself.","It was mostly his resemblance to his father that seized her so strongly; it was like seeing Erlend in a monk’s cowl. As they sat and talked and she told him everything that had happened on the estate since he left home, she kept waiting and waiting. Finally she asked anxiously if Bjørgulf would be coming soon. “I don’t know, Mother,” replied her son. A moment later he added, “It has been a hard struggle for Bjørgulf to submit to his cross and serve God.","Whilst they sat talking together, and he had her tell him of all that had befallen at the manor since he took his way from home, she was waiting, waiting. At length she asked fearfully if Björgulf would not come soon. “I know not, mother,” answered her son. A little after he said: “For Björgulf it has been a hard struggle to bow beneath his cross and serve God — And it seemed to affright him when he heard that you were here — lest too many thoughts should be called up again —”"
*,*,"But then she added, “The ribbon belonged to Aasa, my sister.”",Gaute set to greeting the house-carls and giving orders to the men who had been with him.
"Det var engang, hun var gåt bort fra mig efter et sådant udbrud, at der var ligesom noget sårt ved hjertet, der hvor hodet [5] hendes havde ligget, og jeg sa høit til mig selv: Hun kan vist aldrig forlade mig!","There was a time when she had walked away from me after such an outburst that there was like something hurting in her heart where her head [5] had been lying, and I said aloud to myself: She can probably never leave me!","Have you ever seen as beautiful a maiden as my Jofrid? I had to have her, whatever it may cost me.","For that day in autumn of last year when she had been as far as Dovre with the two, and came riding by the church and looked down upon the lower slopes, lying sheeted in cold mist so that she could not make out the houses on her own manor — she had thought that so must they feel, who ride towards their home knowing that the houses lie there burned to ashes and cold charred wood — — Now, when she turned homewards by the old path past the smithy garth — this year ’twas all but overgrown, and tufts of yellow bedstraw, bluebells and vetch swept over it from the eages of the rank hay-field — almost it seemed to her that what she saw was a picture of her own life: the weather-beaten, sooty old hearth-place, that never again would have fire kindled upon it. The ground about it was strewn thick with powdered charcoal, but soft, short, glossy grass was springing up over all the plot where the fire had raged. And from the cracks of the old fireplace bloomed the long, pink tassels of the willow-herb, which sows itself in all places. 2 IT would befall at times, when Kristin was gone to rest already, that she would be awaked by folk coming riding into the courtyard."
"Det var mig også så velgjørende, at der [22] ikke forudsattes mellem os noget af dette man kalder «venskab». Vi talte aldrig om de rent private ting. Jeg kjendte ikke engang hans bosted, og han ikke mit. Mødet mellem vore personligheder var så naturligt, så utvungent, og der var i vor omgang så megen respekt for det hos hinanden, en vil ha for sig selv. Han gav mig ingen af disse særlig sterke håndtryk der forpligter. Man spørger sig, når man går ind til sig selv: Hvad betød det egentlig. Hans håndtryk kom blot, når der var noget, der havde bevæget ham, eller bevæget os begge.","It was also so beneficial to me that [22] nothing of what is called «friendship» was assumed between us. We never talked about the purely private things. I did not even know his place of residence, and he did not mine. The meeting between our personalities was so natural, so unforced, and there was in our turn so much respect for each other that one wants for oneself. He gave me none of those particularly strong handshakes that commit. One wonders when going into oneself: What did it really mean. His handshake only came when something had moved him, or moved us both.","She can see that you’re not man enough to venture over the mountains because it’s windy and snowing. You know full well that soon she’ll have to crawl on her knees, this poor woman, and writhe in the greatest of torments—and her child will be called a bastard, because you don’t dare go to her father. You sit here in the house warming the bench, not daring to lift a finger to protect the wife you have or your child soon to be born. Your father was not so afraid of my father that he didn’t dare seek him out, or so fainthearted that he refused to ski through the mountains in the wintertime. Shame on you, Gaute, and pity me who must live to see the day when I call my son a timid man, one of the sons that Erlend gave me!” Gaute picked up the heavy carved chair with both hands and slammed it against the floor; he ran over to the table and swept everything off.","— She fetched her casket, and brought forth the gold ring set with sapphires. “This ring his father laid upon my bed when I had brought Gaute into the world.” Jofrid took the ring and kissed her hand: “But I had thought to beg another gift in return from you — mother —” She smiled SO winningly. “Be not afraid that Gaute has brought home a slothful and handless woman. But I have no fitting workaday dress. Give me an old one of yours, and grudge me not the right to help you; mayhap then you will soon like me better than I can look you should now —” But now ’twas for Kristin to show the young girl what she had in her chests, and Jofrid praised all Kristin’s goodly handiwork so understandingly that the elder woman gave her one thing and another — two linen sheets with knotted silk fringes, a blue-hemmed towel, a twilled coverlid, and last of all the long tapestry with the hawking picture on it: “ Loth would I be that these things should leave this manor — and by God’s and Our Lady’s help this house will some day be yours.” Then ’twas"
Hvor det kunde glimte i hendes øine! Som om hun havde en sol inde i brystet.,Where it could twinkle in her eyes! As if she had a sun inside her chest.,"May God help both of you, just as I will help you as best I can!” A moment later she realized that she had offered much too warm a welcome to this woman, whom she did not know.","She seemed to cherish a heart-felt love for her young husband, and she welcomed his mother and brothers as though she deemed they stood so far above her ’twas not possible she should honour and serve them enough. For Kristin ’twas a quite new thing that any should put themselves about to guess her wishes and care for her heedfully."
*,*,Kristin’s heart trembled anxiously in the silence.,"But, if folk came to the manor, he was a free-handed host to guests of every kind, and bountiful to beggars — and therein he was a house-master after his mother’s heart; ’"
*,*,you think I’m miserly with food and inhospitable toward the poor.,"Now he grew ware of a heap of chips, and straightway set to work, painfully heaving them about."
"Der er noget sterkt i dette: ikke at ta afgjørelse, ikke at udtale for sig den bestemte dom om det som møder en. Det er som man selv forsvinder ligeoverfor det mangfoldiges storhed, – og blir selv større, idet man lar det store drage gjennem sig istedetfor at lukke det ude.","There is something strong in this: not to make a decision, not to pronounce for oneself the particular judgment of what meets one. It is as if you yourself disappear directly in the face of the greatness of diversity - and become greater yourself, as you let the great draw through you instead of shutting it out.",Ramborg and Jammælt had not yet had a child of their own. Kristin had heard from those who had seen Ramborg at Raumarike that she had grown quite fat and lazy.,"Kristin saw that it irked Jofrid sorely now to stand thus on her feet the whole time, but Jofrid did but grow angry when Kristin prayed her to sit down and rest. To please her a little it came into Kristin’s"
Hun sa:,She said:,. . .” She smiled so charmingly.,and I am stiff with sitting on this stone.”
– Nu slår jeg håret om dig.,- Now I'll wrap my hair around you.,"It was midnight before she went to bed, lying down beside Aamunde’s wife.","“No need to shriek so to let me know you for a troll imp, for I see you have the rolling-breeches * on you —”"
Jeg reiser ind for at kysse mit barn.,I travel in to kiss my baby.,"They were traveling with the young couple’s child, a tiny maiden about eighteen months old, and they had a horse, which they took turns riding.","While he dressed himself and had a bite of food, Kristin sat laughing and playing with little Erlend — he crowed, and chirped, new wakened and in a twitter with morning life."
"Hun sa intet. Hendes læber var lukkede. De bævred let. Hendes øine var sænkede, somom de så noget for sig fra et andet sted eller en anden tid.","She said nothing. Her lips were closed. They trembled easily. Her eyes were lowered, as if they were imagining something from another place or another time.","So everything should have been fine and good. If only Jofrid Helgesdatter hadn’t been . . . well, she was stingy; Kristin couldn’t find any other word for it. If she hadn’t been stingy, Kristin wouldn’t have felt annoyed that her daughter-in-law had such a desire to take charge.","But his step-father said no, the boy was sound and strong, good as gold — and maybe his wits were better than most folks’ — ’twas but that he saw visions: he would seem rapt at times, and afterwards would do often the strangest things — even as ’twas last year."
"Men på samme tid var det som alle mine sanser var blit så åbne. Jeg syntes jeg kunde se inde i alt, som var, som fødtes, døde, led og frydedes, et net, et guddomsnet. Jeg så, hvordan livet var sammentvundet i masker, som intet menneskeøie kan spore trådenes gang i, men vel stundom skimte den vældige fantasi i.","But at the same time, it was as if all my senses had become so open. I thought I could see inside everything that was, that was born, died, suffered and rejoiced, a net, a net of divinity. I saw how life was intertwined in masks in which no human eye can trace the course of the threads, but well sometimes the mighty imagination glimpsed.","Jofrid was much too strict with him about such matters. But he looked so clever. Laughing, Kristin kissed the boy, put him down, and went back to the gallery. But she made little headway with her work; mostly she stood and looked out at the courtyard.","Oh, no, sure I am Gaute will win for us such an accord as — “Nay, mother — Gaute, who is come of nobles and kings — and you who are kin to the best houses in the land — if so be you have had to brook seeing your sons sunk down from the place they were born to stand in, yet shall you see your offspring rise in the world again in Gaute’s children and mine —” Kristin sat silent. ’"
Jeg sank hen i et dybt tungsind. Jeg grubled og kunde ikke finde frem. Og det var som noget indi mig vilde rive mig istykker.,I sank into a deep melancholy. I pondered and could not figure it out. And it was like something inside me wanted to tear me to pieces.,"But she realized that she had to come. The spruce forest covering the slopes stood drinking in the seeping sunlight and swayed softly; the little church sat silent and closed, sweating an odor of tar. With longing Kristin thought about the dead monk who had taken her hand and led her into the light emanating from the cloak of God’s love when she was an innocent child, who had reached out his hand to lead her home, time after time, from the paths on which she had strayed.","There they had mocked at him at first for his low birth — but the guardian was kind and stood his friend. And, since Brother Torgils Olavssön was come into the brotherhood, all the monks had grown much more pious and peaceable, for he was passing pious and meek, though he was the best born of them all, of a rich yeoman kindred away in Slagn — and his mother and sisters were most bounteous to the cloister. But since they were come to Skidan, and since Brother Torgils was fallen sick, all things were grown much harder again."
"Jeg har ikke mer at fortælle. Solen er ståt op. Jeg synes, den gløder sterkere og sterkere for hver dag. Jeg elsker natten, ti den har som millioner dage i sig. Jeg elsker dagen, ti den er som selve livets rindende strøm.","I have nothing more to tell. The sun has risen. I think it glows stronger and stronger with each passing day. I love the night, for it has millions of days in it. I love the day, for it is like the flowing stream of life itself.","Then one evening they were sitting around the fireplace in the convent hall, the little group of people left alive at Rein Convent. Huddled around the fire were four nuns and two lay sisters, an old beggar and a half-grown boy, two women who received alms from the convent, and several children. On the high seat bench, above which a large crucifix could be glimpsed in the dusk hanging on the light-colored wall, lay the abbess with Sister Kristin and Sister Turid sitting at her head and feet. It was nine days since the last death had occurred among the sisters and five days since anyone had died in the convent or the nearest houses. The plague seemed to be waning throughout the countryside as well, said Sira Eiliv.","The men stood there frighted from their wits — ready to fly — some stamped about on the same spot — Kristin saw their feet in the light from the lanthorn on the ground. Then one, she made sure, would have sprung at her — at the same moment the grey-white nuns’ dresses came into sight — and the knot of men hung wavering — Kristin had the boy in her arms still; he was crying for his bannock; so she set him down, took the bread, and brushed it clean: “There, eat it — your bannock is as good as ever now — And now go home, you men” — the shaking of her voice forced her to stop a little. “Go home and thank God you were saved from the doing of a deed ’twere hard to atone.”"
"Han blev heftig, knytted hånden, og syntes at glemme mit nærvær.","He became violent, clenched his hand, and seemed to forget my presence.","They pounded dried fish thin and flat, pressed butter into containers, and filled wooden casks with ale and milk.",Kristin nodded again.
"Jeg tændte lys og stod op. Hun havde bragt mig roser, en gul og tre røde.","I turned on the light and got up. She had brought me roses, one yellow and three red.","In the dark she fumbled her way over to the hearth, crouched down to stir the ashes and blow on them, but there was not the slightest spark; the fire had died out in the night. She pulled her flint out of the pouch on her belt, but the tinder must have gotten wet and then froze.","“— But you good folk I pray to drink and be merry to-night — now you have seen her who shall be my wife, and mistress of Jörundgaard — she and no other woman, I swear it by God our Lord and my Christian faith. I look to you to honour her, all of you, both men and women, and I look that you, my men, will help me to hold her and guard her as befits men of mettle.”"
– Rebekka.,- Rebekah.,And he had become the most amenable of husbands.,"They were of middle age now: they had ever been careless and light-headed, but high-minded and gallant; and they were little changed — they met both the Erlendssöns and their cousin, Sir Sigurd, who stood in their shoes at Sundbu, with the free and open bearing befitting kinsmen."
– Madeira! råbte hun.,- Madeira! she shouted.,Can’t you marry her off?” she asked sharply.,"Then she saw that the first rider was Sir Sigurd of Sundbu — he lighted down from his horse with somewhat of an old man’s stiffness. “Ay — I bring you tidings of Gaute, Kristin,” said the knight, when they had greeted one another."
Jeg sa de ordene:,I said those words:,Sit down and I’ll comb your hair.,It seemed he was most fond of his little daughter; he went to see her always
"[45] – Hvem kan male en mands venten? Det stormer, det raser, det kjæmper mellem det hårde og bløde, mellem manden og kvinden i ham.

Hun skal få føle, at hun har ladt en mand sidde og gjøre sig til slave af tid og rum for en lumpen kvindes skyld, hun skal en-gang få føle det! Å nei, hvis hun kom i dette øieblik – jeg skulde gjøre det ydmygeste, jeg kunde hitte på, jeg skulde kysse hendes sko der, hvor den er smudsig, jeg skulde – skulde –","[45] - Who can paint a man's wait? It storms, it rages, it fights between the hard and the soft, between the man and the woman in him. In one moment roaring accusations, in the next the growing humility. She must feel that she has let a man sit and make herself a slave of time and space for the sake of a shabby woman, she must one day feel it! Oh no, if she came at this moment - I should do the humblest thing I could think of, I should kiss her shoes where it's dirty, I should - should -","Life on this earth was irredeemably tainted by strife; in this world, wherever people mingled, producing new descendants, allowing themselves to be drawn together by physical love and loving their own flesh, sorrows of the heart and broken expectations were bound to occur as surely as the frost appears in the autumn. Both life and death would separate friends in the end, as surely as the winter separates the tree from its leaves. One evening, two weeks before Saint Olav’s Day, a group of beggars happened to come to Jørundgaard and asked for lodgings for the night. Kristin was standing on the gallery of the old storeroom—it was now under her charge—and she heard Jofrid come out and tell the poor people that they would be given food, but she could not give them shelter. “There are many of us on this manor, and my mother-in-law lives here too; she owns half the buildings.”","But at last one day two of Gaute’s tenants from south in the Dale came galloping into the manor with tidings: the Warden was on his way north to seek out Gaute at his home, and the maid’s father and kinsmen were in his train. Young Lavrans ran straightway to the stable — Next evening it looked as though an army was gathered at Jörundgaard: all Gaute’s kinsmen were there with their armed followers, and his friends in the parish had come to tryst too. Then came Helge of Hovland with a great following to crave his right against the ravisher. Kristin caught a glimpse of Helge Duk, as he rode into the courtyard alongside of Sir Paal Sörkvessön, the Warden himself. Jofrid’s father was an oldish, tall and bent-backed man of a sickly look — when he lighted from his horse ’twas seen one leg was shorter than the other. The sister’s husband, Olav Piper, was short, broad, and thick-set, red of skin and hair."
"Snart droges jeg opover mod atelieret, gik frem og tilbage uden at gå ind.","Soon I was drawn upwards towards the studio, walking back and forth without going inside.","When she heard horses being led into the courtyard, she went to have a look, peering between the narrow pillars of the gallery.","Then he rushed out of the door, with a parting kick to the block-chair — they heard him run cursing up the loft stairs."
"En tung vemod kom over mig. Hun havde været andres. Der var det af hende, der havde knoppet og blomstret, uden at jeg havde set det og levet med det. Måske noget af det vakreste, det der flygter og aldrig kommer igjen, det havde andre eiet.","A heavy melancholy came over me. She had been someone else's. There it was of her that had budded and blossomed without me having seen it and lived with it. Perhaps some of the most beautiful, the one that escapes and never comes back, it had others owned.","On the first evening Kristin offered to take a look at the child because she was incessantly crying and moaning; she looked so pitiful with her big, bald head and tiny, limp body. She couldn’t yet talk or sit up on her own. The mother seemed ashamed of her daughter. The next morning when Kristin offered to carry the child for a while, she was left in her care, and the other woman strode on ahead; she seemed a most neglectful mother.","Kristin took the heavy, iron-shod staff in her hand, and, as she would not ride, Gaute laid her double wallets across his horse and drove it on before him. Up on the church-green Kristin turned about and looked down upon her manor — so fair it lay in the dewy, sun-bright morning. The river shone white. The house-folk stood there yet —"
– Hvor vil De egentlig hen?,- Where do you really want to go?,"She was with Erlend, for he had just straightened up after ducking through the doorway ahead of her.",She knew that the lessons in this service told of God’s healing miracles through the power vouchsafed to his faithful knight King Olav Haraldssön.
*,*,"Then he would hurry back to the ill man, Brother Torgils; toward him he was the most tender and loving father.","And far up the fjord, under Frosta’s blue hills, lay Tautra, low and black like a whale’s back, the church tower standing up like the steering-fin."
"Så atter stille stunder, som pauser i en ouverture, da pludselig hvert eneste instrument holder inde. Man står udenfor livet. Men sagte begynder det at liste sig om en igjen, i nye former, i nye, forbausende akkorder. En ser, at en aldrig har kjendt verden, aldrig set sig selv.","Then again quiet moments, like pauses in an overture, when suddenly every single instrument stops. One stands outside of life. But slowly it begins to creep around one again, in new forms, in new, astonishing chords. One sees that one has never known the world, never seen oneself.","Anger flared up in the former mistress. Never before had any wayfarers been refused a night’s lodging at Jørundgaard, and the sun was already touching the crest of the mountains. She ran downstairs and went over to Jofrid and the beggars. “They may take shelter in my house, Jofrid, and I might as well be the one to give them food too.","Gaute went forward to meet them; he bore him gallantly, with head held high — and behind him he had the whole array of kinsmen and friends; they stood in a half-circle before the upper-hall steps, in the midst the two elder men of knightly rank, Sir Sigurd and Sir Jammælt. Kristin and Jofrid watched the meeting from the shed of the weaving-house, but they could not hear the words that fell. The men went up into the loft, and the two women turned in to the weaving-house. They could not speak."
De forfulgte mig hine ord.,They pursued those words for me.,"Andres went over and gave the things to them, and then asked if he might carry the child for the woman.","An ugly, dark fear took hold on the mother as time went on."
*,*,"The pale yellow glimmer moved northward—the mountain lake lay white and still; fish rose up, rippling the surface—but beneath the towering dome on the opposite side, the water mirrored a deep blackness.","It seemed as if these yearnings burst her heart in sunder — they ran hither and thither like streams of blood, seeking out ways to all places in the wide-stretched land where she had lived, to all the sons she had wandering in the world, to all her dead beneath the moulds —"
"Noget af det, som gjør os til mænd i livet, kom mod mig ud af alle disse tyngende [30] tanker. Man blir pludselig var noget der er udenfor en, noget der er høiere, sterkere end en selv, det rører ved en, det blir ens eget, og en blir selv sterkere end en var før, og rigere, sorgfuldt rigere, glad rigere, alt eftersom lodderne falder.","Some of what makes us men in life came to me out of all these burdensome [30] thoughts. You suddenly become something that is outside of you, something that is higher, stronger than yourself, it touches you, it becomes your own, and you become stronger than you were before, and richer, sadly richer, happier richer, everything as the weights fall.","The boy would doubtless choose the spiritual life, so Simon Simonssøn was sure to be the one who would settle at Formo when the time came. He was a healthy and lively child who looked a great deal like his father, and he was Ramborg’s favorite.","One day in the fast-time, Kristin and Jofrid were at work making ready the food-wallets for the wood-cutters. They beat the dried fish thin and flat, pressed butter into boxes, filled wooden bottles with beer and milk."
"På en anden måde skifted ansigtet. Det kunde få et udtryk, som det beholdt så længe, så skifte om i et andet, som stod.","In another way, the face changed. It could get an expression that it retained for so long, then switch to another that stood.","Kristin was taken by surprise when the girl lifted her face, so white and so lovely inside the drenched hood of her cloak. And she was so young and as small as a child.","She stood leaning upon her rake, looking on the young maid — a gentle, round, and comely face this child had, and the fairest bright hair in a heavy plait. “God will surely grant you happiness withal, my Tordis — he seems a gallant, good lad, your betrothed.”"
"Nei. Pludselig farer hun op, linnedet fyker om hende, hun fræser: Jeg vil! Jeg vil!","No. Suddenly she rises, the linen flings around her, she grunts: I will! I will!","Kristin nodded again. The countryside was sodden the next day, pallid and black under torrents of rain when Gaute rode into the courtyard around mid afternoon prayers. Kristin felt a cold sweat on her brow as she leaned against the doorway.","She walked slowly, as one well on in years, chatting with the girl; and before long she had led the talk in such wise that Tordis of her own accord had told Naakkve’s mother all that had been ’twixt him and her. Ay, she had been wont to meet him in their home paddock, and last summer, when she lay at the sæter, he had been with her more times than one of nights. But he had never offered to be overbold with her."
"Tilslut var det som hun fordobledes for mig. Pigens tendre slankhed vugged i hendes yppighed, jomfruens håb mod det hemmelighedsfulde glimted og glimted inde i det ansigt, som livets sorg havde skrevet sin smerteligt deilige sang på.","In the end, it was like she doubled for me. The girl's tender slenderness rocked in her opulence, the virgin's hope against the secret gleamed and glistened inside the face on which the sorrow of life had written its painfully delicious song.","She used an odious word to describe Jofrid one day when she and Kristin were together in the cookhouse. For once Kristin struck her maid. “How splendid to hear such words from you, an old nag lusting after men as you do!” Frida wiped the blood from her nose and mouth. “Aren’t you supposed to be better than a poor man’s offspring, daughters of great chieftains such as yourself and this Jofrid?","Belike he had somewhat of his father’s thirst for travel in his blood — he would settle down when he grew older. When his mother saw that he was impatient to get away, she herself hastened his going —"
"Så kom natten, og vi sank sammen, og jeg kan ikke skildre, hvad det var. Ti for mig var det livet.",Then came the night and we sank together and I can not describe what it was. Ten for me it was life.,"Up on the church hill Kristin turned around and looked down at her estate. How lovely it looked in the dewy, sun-drenched morning. The river shone white.","And he was grown to be a most compliant husband. The mother-in-law denied not that in many things Gaute might do well to give ear to his wife — she was shrewd, notable, and hardworking far beyond the common. And she was so more wanton than Kristin herself had been."
Hun havde forståt alt. Alt havde der været i den klangen.,She had understood everything. Everything had been in that sound.,"It was the same way with everything she was supposed to be given from the farm: the autumn slaughtering, grain and flour, fodder for her four cows and two horses. She received either smaller amounts or poor-quality goods.","Ramborg and Jammælt had as yet had no children together. Kristin had heard, from folk who had seen her at Raumarike, that Ramborg was grown passing fat and sluggish."
"Og jeg begyndte at se hende for mig sådan som hun var, men som jeg ikke havde havt fred til at se hende. Ud af jernnettene og husvinduerne og menneskefødderne og spirene tvandt sig hendes træk, større og dybere end jeg havde vidst dem, og jeg så dybt i hendes bryst værelser jeg ikke havde været inde i.","And I began to see her for me as she was, but as I had not had the peace to see her. Out of the iron nets and the house windows and the human feet and the sprouts twisted her features, bigger and deeper than I had known them, and I looked deep into her breast rooms I had not been inside.","She fretted, and the monk coughed, but now and then they both slept for a while. Part of the night Kristin kept watch and tended the fire along with one of the Dovre men and Brother Arngrim.",On such days there were always deep drifts in two places in the courtyard — and all at once ’twas as though she must think with love and longing of these two snowdrifts that she and all folk on the manor had cursed each winter — ’ twas as if she were doomed never to see them more.
"Men nei! De deiligste stunder, også de kom dog siden. Så forunderlig sammensatte, rige og tunge af alt det, som kom til, som bragte storme i mig og oprørte mit sind, der før havde været så roligt.","But no! The most wonderful moments, but they also came later. So wonderfully composed, rich and heavy of all that came to pass, which brought storms into me, and stirred up my mind, which before had been so calm.","But there was the fact that Jofrid was not well. Kristin had noticed it almost at once after the young girl arrived. And Kristin remembered the first winter she had spent at Husaby; she at least had been married, and her husband and father were bound by kinship, no matter what might happen to their friendship after the sin came to light. All the same, she had suffered so terribly from remorse and shame, and her heart had felt bitter toward Erlend. But she was already nineteen winters old back then, while Jofrid was barely seventeen.","Kristin said over the last prayers for the day, undressed quietly, and crept into bed. She settled the pillows snugly about her breast and shoulders, and the old hound nestled into her back. Soon after she fell asleep."
*,*,even though it hurt her pride to arrive so impoverished; she had nothing to give.,"but then his sister was wed, and her husband took over the house and the share in the boat, and he could betake him to the Minorites of Tunsberg."
"Der var også en anden ting. Hver fjortende dag reiste hun ind til hovedstaden. [59] Hun sa det var nødvendigt, og jeg spurgte ikke om grund.",There was another thing too. Every fortnight she traveled into the capital. [59] She said it was necessary and I did not ask why.,"Only for one short section of the public road was it possible to see the buildings of Haugen high on the mountain crest. Her heart began hammering at the mere thought. As she had predicted, she met more pilgrims when she reached Toftar late in the day. The next morning she was joined by several others as they all set off into the mountains. A priest and his servant, along with two women, his mother and sister, were on horseback, and they soon pulled far ahead of those on foot.","He was free-handed and good-hearted; but Kristin had seen that her father held the poor he helped in reverence, because Jesus had chosen a poor man’s lot when He came in the flesh. And her father had loved hard work and deemed that all handicraft was honoured, since that God’s mother, Mary, chose to be a working-woman who spun to win bread for herself and hers, though she was a daughter of rich folk and came of the kindred of the kings and high-priests of the Jewish land. Two days after, early in the morning, while Jofrid was still going about half clad and Gaute lay abed, Kristin came in to them. She had on a kirtle and cloak of grey wadmal, wore a wide-brimmed, black felt hat above her coif, and strong shoes upon her feet. Gaute flushed deeply when he saw his mother in this garb. Kristin said she was minded to go afoot to Nidaros to Saint Olav’s feast, and she prayed her son to see to her affairs the while."
Og jeg voved ikke.,And I did not dare.,Out in the courtyard all the servants had gathered; Ingrid had told them that Mistress Kristin was going on a pilgrimage to Nidaros.,"“ ’Tis as mother says, Jofrid,” said Gaute — but passing meekly."
"Sådan var hele mit forhold til hende. Jeg vandred i bælgmørke og så intet og følte alt. Men pludselig kunde noget glimte frem, noget skvulpe.","Such was my whole relationship with her. I walked in pitch darkness and saw nothing and felt everything. But suddenly something flashed, something splashed.","Kristin had no peace to collect her thoughts, but every word the boys uttered aroused a dull, deep longing in her heart: for her sons, above all else, but also for the manor, the houses, the outbuildings, the livestock. A mother’s toil and a mother’s domain. She was still feeling reluctant to be recognized by people who might have been friends with Erlend or her in the past.",And now she gave her promise to Brother Edvin’s keeping. 5 So at last she was at her journey’s end.
Hun stod en stund. Så gik hun langsomt ud. Jeg hørte døren lukkes stille. [67] Jeg hørte hende gå ude på gangen. Jeg hørte hendes dør gå op. Så hørte jeg ikke mere.,She stood for a while. Then she went out slowly. I heard the door close quietly. [67] I heard her walking out in the hallway. I heard her door open. Then I heard no more.,"A wooden cross stood near the creek, and all around lay crutches and walking sticks, and on the bushes hung shreds of old bandages. There was a small fence around the church, but the gate was locked. Kristin knelt down outside and thought about the time she had sat inside with Gaute on her lap. Back then she was dressed in silk, one of the group of magnificently attired noblemen and women from the surrounding parishes. Sira Eiliv stood nearby, holding Naakkve and Bjørgulf firmly by the hand; among the crowd outside were her maids and servants. Then she had prayed so fervently that if this suffering child would be given his wits and health, she would ask for nothing more, not even to be freed from the terrible pain in her back which had plagued her ever since the birth of the twins. She thought about Gaute, so stalwart and handsome he looked on his huge blue-black horse. And about herself.","While she said over the five Aves in memory of the redemption’s mysteries of pain, she felt ’twas through her sorrows only that she dared seek shelter under the cloak of God’s mother. Her sorrow for the children she had lost, her heavier sorrows for each stroke of fate that fell upon her sons and that she could not ward from them. Mary, the perfect in purity, in meekness, in obedience to the Father’s will, had sorrowed the most of all mothers, and her mercy would see and understand the pale and weak reflection from a sinful woman’s heart, that had burned with hot and ravaging fleshly love and with all the sins that fleshly love brings with it — untowardness and defiance, a stony, unforgiving spirit, stubbornness, and pride — yet was a mother’s heart in despite of all. Kristin hid her face in her hands. For a moment it seemed to her more than she could bear, that she was parted now from them all — from all her sons. Then she said over the last Paternoster."
Han. – Kommer det atter listende?,He. - Will it be tricky again?,"asked the priest with a frown. Then he got down from his horse, tied the reins to the fence, and bent down to slip under the railing as he gave the woman a steady, searching glance.","asked the priest, bending his brows. He lighted down from his horse, bound it to a fence log, and leaned over the fence, gazing fixedly and searchingly at the woman."
"(Der er så lidet orden i min beretning. Jeg må fortælle, at dette var adskillig tid før de fire måneder. – Det var fire ialt.)",(There is so little order in my account. I must tell you that this was quite some time before the four months. - It was four in total.),"Simon released me as soon as he realized that I was more fond of Erlend than of him, and then my father gave his consent—unwillingly, but he placed my hand in Erlend’s. I was betrothed for a year. Does that seem worse to you?”","He bade me tell you this — and now have I done it,” Sir Sigurd ended, weakly. “You must tell me all that you know of this matter, Sigurd,” Kristin prayed, calmly."
*,*,"Beaming, she stepped forward to greet him, but she stopped abruptly and caught her breath when she saw his face.","Skule Erlendssön was come two days before with a light sloop from Björgvin, with letters from Bjarne Erlingssön for the Archbishop and the Treasurer of Nidaros."
– Kom!,- Come on!,Behind her back he dared to give more.,well she should come to him at Rognheim when once Gaute was wedded:
– Jeg er glad.,- I'm happy.,She had taken nothing from her father.,"Frida sat next to the mistress now on the women’s bench, and bore the keys when Kristin was from home."
Det var så ondt. Jeg kunde intet si.,It was so bad. I could say nothing.,"But the boy had always had a desire to go out and see the world, and so he had entered the service of the bishop of Skaalholt and left Norway. Skule himself had accompanied Sir Bjarne to Sweden and then on a war campaign to Russia.","“No, no.” Skule shook his head."
"Å, jeg kan ikke forstå, hvordan du sådan kunde få mig til at glemme alt. Der var hele dage og nætter, ja hele uger, at der ikke var fnug andet end det. Å tak, tak!","Oh, I can not understand how you could make me forget everything like that. There were whole days and nights, yes whole weeks, that there was no fluff other than that. Oh thank you, thank you!","Sira Eiliv came in later that night. He reprimanded Sister Agata sharply for not following his advice to tie a linen cloth, dipped in vinegar, around her mouth and nose. She murmured crossly that it would do no good, but now both she and Kristin had to do as he ordered.","Now and again Kristin thought of her own — the sons who were scattered so far and wide, the grandchildren she should never see — little Erlend’s golden head wavered before her sight. But they were grown to seem far off and pale to her. Almost it seemed as though all mankind in this time of need were alike near to each other and alike far apart."
"Jeg havde spurgt ham, om han ikke havde havt en og samme model til de fleste ting. Han havde sagt:",I had asked him if he had not had one and the same model for most things. He had said:,"But his stepfather said no, the boy was healthy and strong, as good as gold, and perhaps cleverer than most people. But it was true that he had second sight.","But when she spoke of this to Gaute, he looked ill pleased and tried to turn the matter aside. At length he asked hotly whether his mother could send a letter over the mountains in winter-time?"
"– Jeg følte, at jeg vilde ikke kunne hade eller anklage. Istedet fyldte mig en underlig, sorgblandet forventning. Hvad vilde skjæbnen bringe?","- I felt that I would not be able to hate or accuse. Instead, a strange, mournful expectation filled me. What would fate bring?","Grunde appeared to let his wife guide him in all manner of things, and they already had three handsome children. Kristin was strangely moved when she saw Simon and Ramborg’s oldest son again. He was the living image of Lavrans Bjørg ulfsøn, even more than Gaute.","“ ’Twas her Gaute courted first; but when I came home, he knew not which of us he liked the best. But ’twas Aasa he had looked to find at Dagrun’s house last summer when he came down to Sogn."
Hun var borte. På bordet lå en seddel:,She was gone. On the table was a note:,"Gunnulf wasn’t sure of all the reasons, but one was that Abbot Johannes would not allow young brothers to become ordained as priests until they were thirty, and he refused to make an exception to this rule for Nikulaus. And because the venerable father thought that Nikulaus prayed and brooded more than he was spiritually prepared for and was thereby ruining his health with his pious exercises, he wanted to send the young man to one of the cloister’s farms on the island of Inder; there, under the supervision of several older monks, he was to plant an apple orchard.","face — a long, narrow, in-fallen mouth, two deeply sunken, amber eyes. “Can it be — is it you yourself, Kristin Lavransdatter?” The monk laid his crossed arms upon the dyke and buried his face in them."
"Hun bar sig ad som en hund, der har været forvildet og har fundet sin herre.",She behaved like a dog that has been lost and has found its master.,The tips of their skis sank deep into the great snowdrift that always formed across the courtyard when the wind blew from the northwest.,And Kristin saw that Jofrid was jealous of her.
*,*,But they seemed quite pleased when they heard of their mother’s intention to join the convent at Rein.,Björgulf answered low:
Hun havde sagt:,She had said:,"“My Jofrid is as well as she can be, you say?","In horror, Kristin pulled her aside:"
"Hun bedrog mig, løi for mig, hykled!","She deceived me, lied to me, hypocritical!","And when she, amid much crying and complaining, put some damp earth and a cold green leaf on the sting, his wailing became quite dreadful.",Gaute sent word to Sundbu that same day; and Sir Sigurd came at once to Jörundgaard and held Erlend Gautessön at his christening.
"[11] Jeg vilde fortælle om, hvordan hun, hvis ansigt var gammelt, trist, da jeg så hende første gang, forvandledes, der kom nye træk, der udslettedes rynker, hendes øine fik farve, hver dag gjorde hende yngre.","[11] I wanted to tell about how she, whose face was old, sad when I first saw her, was transformed, new features came, wrinkles were erased, her eyes got color, every day made her younger.","Jofrid should spare herself and enjoy her morning rest instead of getting up before everyone else on the manor. Kristin saw that it was Jofrid’s desire to rise before her mother-in-law and to accomplish more than she did. But Jofrid was not the kind of person Kristin could offer either help or solicitude. The only thing she could do was silently take the heaviest work away from her and treat her as if she were the rightful young mistress on the estate, both when they were alone and in front of the servants.","her and her stepmother, and she had cared but little then about her small half-brothers. Now she was thirty years old, and had had no children of her marriage; she showed her comely grown-up brothers now much sisterly love, and ’twas she who brought about the understanding ’twixt her husband and Gaute. Margret was fair still, but she was grown so big and stout that Kristin deemed she had never seen so huge a woman. But all the more room was there for silver plates upon her belt, and a brooch as big as a small hand-shield adorned most fitly the space betwixt her broad breasts. Her mighty body was ever decked out, like an altar, with the most costly stuffs and fairly gilt metal — Gerlak Tiedekenssön seemed to prize his wife exceeding highly. The year before, Gaute had visited his sister and brother-in-law in Björgvin at the time of the spring meetings, and in the autumn he crossed the fells with a drove of horses which he sold there."
"(Det var under de tre måneder ved sjøen, de tre måneder, som var en eneste uafbrudt henrykkelse.)","(It was during the three months at sea, the three months, that was a single uninterrupted delight.)","Kristin thought she should seize the opportunity to talk with Jofrid, to let her know that here she would meet with only maternal goodwill. But Jofrid looked angry and defiant.","She grew fearful as he said no more, but she asked calmly enough when they stood alone together in the room: “What manner of tidings are they, then, kinsman?"
Det gynged og gynged i mig.,It rocked and rocked in me.,But I’ve noticed before that,"Young Erlend toddled round in rings, gazing down into the grass."
"Jeg vilde fortælle om den lykke det var, at dette skyldtes mig. At jeg havde magten til det.",I wanted to tell about the happiness it was that this was due to me. That I had the power to do it.,Frida was furious at having to relinquish her place next to her mistress and give it to Gaute’s . . .,That journey brought him so much gain that Gaute swore he would do the like again next autumn. Kristin thought ’twas well to let him have his way in this.
*,*,"Then she noticed that she was sitting on the stone wall surrounding the hops garden of Nikulaus Manor, their old town estate.",Twas strange to hear him cry out her old name:
"Hun var også glad, når jeg kyssed hende. Og hun sa, at hun elsked mig.",She was also happy when I kissed her. And she said she loved me.,"Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn’s magnificent loft room had fallen into disrepair over the years, after the sons of Erlend had moved in. Kristin hadn’t wanted to give the reckless boys any but the coars est and most essential of bedclothes and pieces of furniture, and she seldom had the room cleaned, for it wasn’t worth the effort.","She sat ever with a spindle in her hands — when she was at her best she would spin a fine and even thread, but when ’twas ill with her, she would pluck her own spinning to pieces and strew the wool that her handmaidens had carded over the whole room. After Gaute had told Kristin of this, she ever welcomed her cousin with heart-felt friendliness, if it chanced that he came to the manor."
*,*,"They were traveling with the young couple’s child, a tiny maiden about eighteen months old, and they had a horse, which they took turns riding.","She kissed Jofrid at parting, and this she had never done before."
"Men da hun var gåt, var det som tusend tårer inde i mig, der havde været frosset til is, smelted, og blodet gjød sig så hedt op langs kindet.","But when she was gone, it was like a thousand tears inside me that had been frozen to ice, melted, and the blood poured so hot up along the cheek.","This was what angered her mother-in-law, for she felt it diminished the honor of the manor and its owner.","Then had he heard a voice, the gentlest and sweetest in all the world, and it promised to show him a sign if he would go to the Bjerkheim bridge on a certain day —"
"Hun kasted hodet bagover og så på klyngen med det gladeste «ja» i øinene, jeg [13] har set. Jeg glemmer det ikke. Jeg husker også, hvordan de så efter os med et blik, somom de vilde si:","She threw her head back and looked at the cluster with the happiest ""yes"" in her eyes I [13] have seen. I will not forget it. I also remember how they looked at us with a glance, as if to say:","In the meantime it was now clearly evident that Jofrid was not walking alone. One day she was going to clean some feathers for new mattresses. Kristin advised her to tie back her hair so it wouldn’t be covered with down. Jofrid bound a linen cloth around her head. “No doubt this is now more fitting than going bareheaded,” she said with a little laugh.","Is he sick, since he came not home with you?” “No, Gaute is as well as e’er I saw him. But his company was weary —” He blew the froth off the bowl of ale that Kristin handed him, drank and praised the ale."
Jeg mødte hans blik. Jeg spurgte:,I met his gaze. I asked:,Jofrid thanked her mother-in-law. “But now we won’t trouble you anymore.”,"Proud should we all be if any day we should grow to our father’s stature — ay, or to his shoulder — we mind ever that he was a chieftain, and a man outdoing all men in all such gifts as adorn a man — but you cannot make us believe he was the meekest and most virtuous of swains in a lady’s bower, or the doughtiest of husbandmen — “— Yet need none wish aught better for you, my Erlend, than that you may grow to be his like!”"
*,*,"“Yes, I want Gaute to be my husband, and he will be, you can count on that, Mother.",hands
"Jeg kunde ha villet ile ud, gråte, gjemme mig bort. Og dog blev der mig en slags selvpinende nydelse i at stå og se, finde igjen en linje her, som jeg selv havde set, en anden linje der, som jeg endnu ikke havde set, men som jeg vidste var hendes.","I could have wanted to hurry out, cry, hide away. And yet I had a kind of self-tormenting pleasure in standing and watching, finding again a line here which I myself had seen, another line there which I had not yet seen but which I knew was hers.","It was indeed conceivable that things might happen as Jofrid wished; she realized that she hadn’t needed to worry so much on her behalf. The girl’s face was now quite gaunt; the rounded softness of her cheeks had wasted away, and it was easier to see what a large, strong jaw she had. Jofrid yawned, pushed herself up into a sitting position, and looked around for her shoes.","“Be still now — go out and wash you — you are bleeding down into the dough,” said the mistress, quietly enough. In the doorway Frida and Jofrid met."
Jeg gik derind. Hun sad der stille. Men hun gråt ikke.,I went in there. She sat there quietly. But she did not cry.,"’s end. She had not come to God with her wreath or with her sins and sorrows, not as long as the world still possessed a drop of sweetness to add to her goblet. But now she had come, after she had learned that the world is like an alehouse: The person who has no more to spend is thrown outside the door. She felt no joy at her decision, but it seemed to Kristin that she herself had not made the choice.",But the monk himself was the most eager — she saw he was fearful he might die ere he came to Nidaros.
Da følte jeg hendes hånd på mit hode. Lydløst havde hun nærmet sig.,Then I felt her hand on my head. Silently she had approached.,"And so she simply asked him to write “the widow Kristin.” Walking down through Gauldal, she took the paths on the outskirts of the villages, for she thought if she met people from the large estates, it might turn out that they recognized the former mistress of Husaby.","All the pools shone whitely, and the heavenly brightness was given back, broken and more faint, from the little mountain beck that hurried, chafing restlessly over stones, to flow out between pale gravel banks into a little moorland tarn. Again there came upon her that strange, feverish inner vision — the stream seemed to show her a picture of her own being; thus had she hurried restlessly through the waste of these earthly years, foamed up in turbulent chafing at every stone in her path — ’twas but weakly and fitfully and palely that the everlasting light could mirror itself in her life."
"Jeg begynder vist at bli lyrisk. Tilgiv mig. Men det er mig så deiligt at dvæle ved dette, forsøge at male det slig som det var.","I'm starting to get lyrical. Forgive me. But it is so lovely to me to dwell on this, to try to paint it as it was.","“My mother always wore this ring,” said Jofrid. “If you will accept it, mistress, then I’ll know that you don’t judge me as sternly as a good and highborn woman might be expected to do.” “Oh, but then I might be tempted to take the place of your mother,” said Kristin with a smile, putting the ring on her finger. It was a little silver ring set with a lovely white agate, and Kristin thought the child must consider it especially precious because it reminded her of her mother.","Often mother and son would stroll out together of an evening. In many places the paths across the fields were so narrow that Kristin must follow after Gaute. He walked in front with his long-handled axe, so masterfully — his mother could not but smile behind his back."
"Det er så tungt for brystet, jeg kan ikke ånde. Jeg drømmer hver nat om ham, jeg drømmer, at han dræber sig, og det døende blik, det sender han mod mig.","It's so heavy on my chest, I can not breathe. I dream every night about him, I dream that he kills himself, and the dying gaze he sends towards me.","Now there’s no one left in Bjørgvin except for the men carrying the corpses. Everyone has fled the town who could, but the sickness follows them.”","Then Lady Ragnhild stepped forth. She was a little, thin old woman, with a broad, flat face and a little round, red nose like a button; her great, light-brown eyes were red-rimmed, and always watered a little."
"Hun havde nye udtryk i ansigtet, der ligesom havde været gjemte dybt nedi hendes bryst og mer og mer havde nærmet sig lyset og nu stod der i fuld sol. Der kom små toner ind i stemmen, som hun selv lo over, og ikke vidste hvor kom fra.","She had new expressions on her face that had seemed to be hidden deep down her chest and more and more had approached the light and now stood there in full sun. There were small tones entering the voice, which she herself laughed over, and did not know where it came from.",She had never felt this way before.,"To Kristin it seemed that the old outer leaves, scarred as they were by every foot of man or beast that had trampled them, must love the sweet bright flowering heart-shoot even as she loved her son’s son. He seemed to her to be life of her life and flesh of her flesh, as surely as her own children, but yet more sweetly. When she had a chance to hold him in her lap, and saw that the boy’s mother watched the two jealously the while, took him away as soon as for shame’s"
"Og det hemmelighedsfulde, som der undertiden kom mellem os, – det var hende. Det var hende, jeg uden at vide det, havde søgt hos ham, – gjenlyden af hendes stemme, jeg havde søgt i hans ords klang, – gjenspeilingen af hendes sind, jeg havde søgt i hans vekslende stemninger.","And the secret that sometimes came between us - it was her. It was she I had sought without him, - the echo of her voice, I had sought in the tone of his word, - the reflection of her mind, I had sought in his changing moods.","When Jammælt finally found the boy on the following day, Andres explained that he had heard a voice during mass on the previous Sunday while he was looking at the images painted on the front of the altar. It showed the Mother of God and Saint Joseph leaving the land of Egypt and carrying a child, and he wished that he had lived back then, for he would have asked to accompany them and carry the child for the Virgin Mary.","Gaute, this one of her sons that she had ever trusted most — it could not be true, as folk had said, that he was untrusty and light with women, that already he was weary of Jofrid, now that his bride was faded and dull, and the time drew near when he must answer to her kinsfolk for his lawless deed. She made excuse for her son — if she could let herself be led astray so easily, she who never had aught before her eyes in her girlhood but the virtuous ways of righteous folk — Her sons had known from childhood that their own mother had done amiss, that their father in his youth had children by another man’s wife, and had sinned with a married woman when they were already great lads."
*,*,In the company of wanton women they would revel in the alehouses and taverns among the dissolute men.,Then they heard from out of the dark a thin child-voice crying:
"Denne forventning behersked mig aldeles, den næste gang hun var hos mig. Jeg havde aldrig været sådan mod hende. Hun vilde kysse mig. Jeg gik fra hende. Hun bad mig at tale. Jeg taug.",This expectation completely dominated me the next time she was with me. I had never been like that to her. She wanted to kiss me. I left her. She asked me to speak. I'm silent.,"Andres became good friends with his aunt, but he never mentioned his visions, and he didn’t have any of his spells while in Sil. The four sons of Erlend seemed to enjoy being together on their mother’s estate, but Kristin didn’t manage to talk much with her sons. When they were discussing things among themselves, she felt as if their lives and well-being had now slipped beyond her view. The two who came from far away had left their childhood home behind, and the two who lived on the manor were on the verge of taking its management out of her hands. The gathering took place in the midst of the springtime shortages, and she saw that Gaute must have been making preparations for it by rationing the fodder more strictly than usual that winter; he had also borrowed fodder from Sir Sigurd. But he had done all these things without consulting her.","Things fall out most often so that I get my will —” Kristin woke in pitch darkness. The cold bit her cheeks and nose — when she drew the skins more closely about her, she felt they were rimy with her breath. It must be well on towards morning — but she shivered at the thought of rising to look at the stars. She curled herself up under the furs to keep warm a little longer."
"Men kanske må kunst betales. Kanske må det Promethevsverk her i dødens rige at ville trænge ind i algudens eget tabernakel, – harmoniens hjem, – skabelsens mysterium, – kanske må det bødes med titanens smerte … og titanens … savn.","But maybe art has to be paid for. Perhaps the Prometheus' work here in the realm of death must want to penetrate into the algae's own tabernacle, - the home of harmony, - the mystery of creation, - perhaps it must be punished with the titan's pain… and the titan's… longing.","And ever since Brother Torgils Olavssøn had entered the brotherhood, all the monks had become more pious and peaceful, for he was so pious and humble, even though he came from the best lineage of any of them, from a wealthy farming family over in Slagn. And his mother and sisters were very generous toward the monastery. But after they had come to Skidan, and after Brother Torgils had fallen ill, everything had once again become difficult.","Kristin took from her sack the cloak that Gaute had forced upon her because ’twas so passing light and warm — of fine boughten cloth, lined with beaver fur. When she wrapped Brother Torgils in it, he whispered — he was so hoarse he could scarce speak — that he would be fain to have the child lie in it with him. So they put the child in with him; it whimpered and wailed, and the monk coughed; but between-whiles both of them got some sleep. Part of the night Kristin kept watch with one of the Dovre men and Brother Arngrim, looking to the fire. The pale yellow light drew round to the northern sky — the tarn lay at their side white and still; fish rose and made rings upon the water — but under the hill on the farther side the water mirrored black darkness. Once an uncanny barking screech came to their ears from over there — the monk started and gripped the other two hard by the arms. Kristin and the farmer deemed ’twas some beast — then they heard a stone roll, as if someone was walking on the hill-side screes, and another cry like a gruff voice of a man. The monk began to pray aloud — she caught the words: “Jesus Christus, Soter,” and “vicit leo de tribu Juda”"
"Det var et vidunder – barndomseventyret i moderbrystet. Det rev mig hen som livets eget digt, hvori gråten er latter og latteren gråt.","It was a miracle - the childhood adventure in the womb. It tore me away like life's own poem, in which crying is laughter and laughter crying.","Then he burst into tears and leaned against his horse, shaking with sobs. But Kristin stood her ground; her voice revealed nothing except amazement and maternal kindness.","Kristin sat her down and took up her spindle. She greeted her children fairly when they came in, and asked Gaute about the hay."
"– Og så skulde vi ikke ha ærbødighed for det øieblik, det er der, smilet, – så skulde vi ikke kaste os på knæ og kysse kvindens fod, mens hun smiler!","And then we should not have reverence for the moment it is there, the smile, - then we should not kneel and kiss the woman's foot while she smiles!","Gaute—all her days she had thought the most highly of this son of hers; it couldn’t be true what people said: that he was unreliable and dealt carelessly with women, that he was already tired of Jofrid, now that his bride had faded and grown heavy and the day was approaching when he would have to answer for his actions to her kinsmen.",“But if they deem not so — if they crave vengeance for the rape of their woman?” Sir Sigurd twisted and scratched worse than ever:
– Vist er hun der. Det er da fanden gale mig ikke noget morsomt uden.,- Apparently she's there. That's damn crazy I'm not funny without it.,"And it was as if the long separation had sharpened Kristin’s sight. For the first time she understood what this son of hers had had to struggle with and was doubtless still struggling with as he grew so big and strong in body, and his inner astuteness grew, but he felt his eyesight failing. Once he asked about his foster mother, Frida Styrkaarsdatter.","He had become a giant in frame, now he was full-grown. And it seemed as though in the long time they had been sundered her sight had grown keener — now, for the first time, she understood to the full what the battle was that this son of hers had fought, that doubtless he was still fighting, while he grew so great and strong of limb, while his inward sight waxed keen, and he felt his eyesight grow dim —"
"Men stop! Hvad er det? Hun sætter sig ned. Hun blir så gammel, så gammel i ansigtet. Hun blir så sørgmodig. Hvad kan hun ha at sørge over, hun som er så ung.","But stop! What is it? She sits down. She gets so old, so old in the face. She gets so sad. What can she have to mourn over, she who is so young.",". . . Sir Sigurd tugged at his clothing and scratched his head, as if he were swarming with lice. Then, this past summer—when Kristin thought that Gaute was at Sundbu and was going to accompany Sir Sigurd into the mountain pastures to hunt for two vicious bears—he had actually journeyed over the heights and down to Sogn; Jofrid was staying there with a married sister. Helge had three daughters and no sons. Sigurd groaned in distress; yes, he had promised Gaute to keep silent about this.","On that he came back, and stood before her with bowed head: “Mother — I know well this is not — easy — for you —” She laid her hands upon his shoulders. He hid his face from her sight, but he bowed down his head and kissed one of her wrists. Kristin remembered that his father had done this once — when, she could not recall — She stroked his sleeve, and on that he lifted his hand and patted her on the cheek."
"Men hun kunde gråte så sårt. Hun [4] kom undertiden til mig og kasted sig på fanget mit og gråt, så hele kroppen hendes skjalv, skuldrene skjalv, brystet, lænderne.","But she could cry so hard. She [4] sometimes came to me and threw herself on my lap and cried so that her whole body trembled, her shoulders trembled, her chest, her loins.","But by then Jofrid had taken off her outer garments. Her heavy winter gown, which was a pale blue woven homespun, was dripping wet at the hem, and the rain had soaked right through her cloak to her shoulders.","Not even while she was the rich lady of Husaby, with a host of serving-folk to do her bidding, had any served her as though they took thought for the mistress’s ease and well-being. She had never spared herself when all work for the good of the whole household was on her shoulders, and none else had even bethought them that she should be spared."
[84] Jeg kunde ikke reise derned igjen. Lede havde fyldt mig.,[84] I could not go down there again. Lead had filled me.,"From the nuns’ dormitory a covered gallery led to the weaving room. Kristin sat there alone, spinning. The sisters of Rein were famous for their flax.","The world was a master whom ’twas not easy to fly, when once one had yielded to its dominion. Ay, and in sooth she had not fled the world — she had been cast out, as a hard master drives a worn-out servant from his door — and now she had been taken in here, as a merciful lord takes in an old serving-maid and of his mercy gives her a little work, while he shelters and feeds the worn-out, friendless old creature — From the nuns’ sleeping-house a covered way led to the weaving-house."
"Det blev aften og morgen, og det blev aften og morgen over en stilhed, hvori alt i os kunde synge. Vi sad i timevis med hodet til hinandens bryst for at høre hinandens hjerte banke. Og det hørtes så stort og sælsomt i huset ved havet. Hun la sig ofte på knæ foran mig og lå sådan, og jeg måtte ikke tale, for hun vilde lytte til det store deilige, sa hun.","It became evening and morning, and it became evening and morning over a silence in which everything in us could sing. We sat for hours with our heads to each other's breasts to hear each other's hearts beat. And it sounded so big and strange in the house by the sea. She often knelt in front of me and lay like that, and I was not allowed to speak, because she wanted to listen to the great delicacy, she said.","Then Kristin said that Gaute should go no farther with her, but first she wanted to sit down and rest for a while. Beneath them lay the valley with the pale green ribbon of the river cutting through it and the farms like small green patches on the forested slopes. But higher up, the moss-covered heights, brown and lichen-yellow, arched against the gray scree and bare peaks, flecked with snowdrifts. The shadows of the clouds drifted over the valley and plains, but in the north the mountains were so brightly lit; one mountainous shape after another had freed itself from the misty cloak and loomed blue, one beyond the other.","Gaute was happy with his wife, and both were marvellous proud of their son, and loved him beyond all measure. So now everything might have been for the best. If only Jofrid Helgesdatter had not been — ay, she was niggardly; Kristin could not call it aught else. Had she not been so, ’twould have vexed Kristin less that her son’s wife was so set on her own will."
"Og netop da var det, det var sket. Netop mens hun nævnte det der havde smertet, var det det skreg i mig: Jeg må – jeg vil – kysse hendes klædebon.","And just then that was what had happened. Just as she mentioned what had hurt, it was it that screamed inside me: I must - I want to - kiss her dress code.","But Kristin blushed crimson because Jammælt sat there listening to all the coarse jests that were uttered. The next day Gaute Erlendssøn was betrothed to Jofrid Helgesdatter, and afterward she went to church for the first time after the birth, honored as if she had been a married woman. Sira Dag said she was entitled to this. Then she went to Sundbu with the child and remained under Sir Sigurd’s protection until the wedding.","Kristin turned on her son, her eyes flashing. The dull coil in her mind — dread for what might come of it all, impatience at having to suffer the young folks’ lawless life here at her manor, gnawing doubts of her son’s manhood — burst out in furious wrath: “Are you such a fool, you deem she can be well, perchance? —"
"[62] Men før jeg reiste hjem igjen, gik jeg ind på en restaurant, ind i den inderste krog.","[62] But before I went home again, I went into a restaurant, into the innermost corner.","The pale yellow glimmer moved northward—the mountain lake lay white and still; fish rose up, rippling the surface—but beneath the towering dome on the opposite side, the water mirrored a deep blackness. Once they heard a hideous snarling shriek from the far shore; the monk cringed and grabbed the other two by the arm.",She wondered — could it be that she was fey? She had never felt the like of this before —
"Jeg tror, jeg. Hun blev min martyr og [116] min helgeninde. Hun ofred sit liv for vor kjærlighed.",I think I. She became my martyr and [116] my saint. She sacrificed her life for our love.,"It seemed that these men had captured a small boy named Tore, the son of Steinunn from down by the shore. That night they were going to sacrifice him to Hel, the plague giantess.",The men stood wavering. Then one shrieked out as though in direst need:
"Der var noget som en sterk blygsel kommet over hende. Hun slog øinene ned for mig, og hun kyssed mig ikke.",There was something like a strong shyness coming over her. She rolled her eyes at me and she did not kiss me.,"She had bent fate to her will; she had obtained the circumstances she wanted. Her sons she could not shape according to her will; they were the way God had created them, and their obstinacy drove them. With them she could never win.",After evening prayer Brother Arngrim told them a goodly saga of a ship in peril of the sea that was saved by an abbess’s prayers to Mary Virgin; the morning star came out over the sea at her command. The monk seemed to have taken a liking to Kristin.
"Det var undertiden jeg syntes hun gled [57] bort fra mig. Jeg kunde holde hende om livet, og pludselig kunde det kjendes i mig, somom jeg var blit så ene. Når jeg så så på hende, var hendes øine inde i en verden jeg ikke vidste om.","It was sometimes I thought she slipped [57] away from me. I could hold her for life, and suddenly it could be felt in me, as if I had become so alone. When I looked at her, her eyes were inside a world I did not know about.","Now you’re the master back home, and a grown man. If I were setting off for Romaborg or Jorsal, well . . . But it’s unlikely that I will encounter any great dangers on this journey. I will find others to keep me company, you know; if not before, then when I reach Toftar.","Gaute shifted about uneasily and seemed to find it hard to bring out his errand. On that Jofrid took the word from him: “There is one matter, mother, that I deem ’twere best we spoke of now. I see"
*,*,"She made the sign of the cross and strode faster, longing just the same to reach the hillside where the road passed among farms.","Gifts for the soul’s peace of the poor and strangers dying in the parish; dowry gifts to fatherless maids; ale-feasts on the holy-days of her father’s best-loved saints; doles to sick folk and sinners journeying to seek Saint Olav — even had Gaute been much richer than he was, none had looked that he should put himself to such costs; Gaute thought no more of his Maker than he needs must."
"Jeg hader (han kneb tænderne sammen, og han så mig stivt ind i øinene med et blik, hvori der næsten var noget vanvittigt) hader … jeg hader dette usynlige, som sniger sig om mig, som jeg aldrig kan få [64] tag på, aldrig komme i åben kamp mod … jeg hader.","I hate (he clenched his teeth and he looked me straight in the eyes with a look in which there was almost something crazy) hate… I hate this invisible that sneaks around me that I can never get [64] hold on to , never get into an open fight against… I hate.","The river seemed to be showing her a picture of her own life: She too had restlessly rushed through the wilderness of her earthly days, rising up with an agitated roar at every rock she had to pass over. Faint and scattered and pale was the only way the eternal light had been mirrored in her life. But it dimly occurred to the mother that in her anguish and sorrow and love, each time the fruit of sin had ripened to sorrow, that was when her earthbound and willful soul managed to capture a trace of the heavenly light. Hail Mary, full of grace.","— If ’twere not fated that she should come hither any more, then ’twas God’s will — useless to be afraid. And most like ’twas but that she was growing old — She crossed herself and went her way with firmer step — willing all the same to get down to the hill-slopes where the road ran among the farms. Only from one short stretch on the highway could one see the houses at Haugen, high on the topmost mountain ridge. Her heart set to throbbing at the thought. As she had thought, she met with pilgrims not a few when she came to Toftar late in the day."
"Men i den hele by var der ikke ét ansigt, som havde dét, – dette som det var ligesom min sjæl kjendtes ved fra et forudtilvær.",But in the whole city there was not a single face that had it - this as it was as if my soul felt from a pre-existence.,"When she wrapped it around Brother Torgils, he whispered—he was so hoarse that he could barely manage to speak—that the child should be allowed to lie next to him.","She saw the courtyard at home in a flurry of snow — a grey day of storm, darkening into a wild winter night — She was all but blown back into the outer room when she opened the door, the storm took her breath away; but there they loomed up, two shapeless bundles of men in snow-smothered fur coats: Ivar and Skule had come home."
"Og siden – og var ikke det rart? – [56] gik jeg i årevis og fandt aldrig den planten igjen, og mer og mer vidunderlig blev den for mig, og jeg har aldrig siden fundet den. Og nu, når jeg ser mig tilbage, er det noget af det jeg husker, mens de store barnesorger er glemte.","And since - and was not it nice? [56] I went for years and never found that plant again, and it became more and more wonderful for me, and I have never since found it. And now when I look back, it's something I remember while the great child sorrows are forgotten.",", after all she has done to spare me work and worry. Do not think, my son, that I fail to see your wife’s virtues or your own loyal love for your mother. If I haven’t shown it as much as you might have expected, you must have forbearance and remember that’s the way old people are.”","But the beggars behaved them peaceably enough. Once the earless one tried to catch a hold of Ingrid as she was setting food on the board; but Björn straightway bristled up and growled. For the rest they seemed out of heart and weary — they had suffered much ill and got but little gain, they answered to the mistress’s questioning — ’twould be better at Nidaros maybe. The woman was pleased when Kristin gave her a goat’s horn full of good grease made of purest lamb’s fat and little children’s water —"
"Under denne tid sad jeg en dag i parken. Jeg havde netop forladt Bredo. Nogle ord, han havde sagt, lød atter og atter for mig. Han havde sagt:","During this time, I was sitting in the park one day. I had just left Bredo. Some words he had said sounded to me again and again. He had said:","Jofrid was home alone with the parish’s charity cases, two old people and two children, whose turn it was to stay at Jørundgaard, and Kristin had only her maid in the old house. Although Kristin was used to seeing all kinds of people among the wandering groups of beggars, she didn’t like the looks of this lot. Four of them were big, strong young men; three of them had red hair and small, wild eyes. They seemed to be brothers.","But ’twas easy to see, too, he had been made to learn both the lessons and the sermon by heart, so that he needed not to read them from a book. While yet they were in the midst of the parleyings, and friends on both sides were seeking to bring them to accord, Jofrid came in with the child in her arms. At that her father broke down, and could not keep back his tears. So ’twas settled as she had wished."
Vi gjør ikke det. Vi har ikke ærbødighed.,We do not. We have no reverence.,She sought excuses for her son. If Jofrid had allowed herself to be seduced so easily .,"“ ’Tis a felony,* belike,” he said, low. “I know not to a nicety —”"
"Det er en af de få gange i mit liv, at jeg har handlet uden at vide forud, hvad der skulde ske, ligesom drevet af ukjendte magter. Man føler noget vidunderlig deiligt ydmygt derved. Der flyder en let, sitrende varme ned over ens skuldre og ryg efterpå, og det er somom hjertet ikke ligger hårdt i brystet, men i et leie af æther.","It is one of the few times in my life that I have acted without knowing in advance what was going to happen, like being driven by unknown powers. One feels something wonderfully deliciously humble thereby. A light, trembling heat flows down one's shoulders and back afterwards, and it is as if the heart does not lie hard in the chest, but in a bed of ether.","Then she went to Sundbu with the child and remained under Sir Sigurd’s protection until the wedding. It took place a month later, just after Saint Jon’s Day, and it was both beautiful and grand. The following morning Kristin Lavransdatter, with great ceremony, gave her keys to her son, and Gaute then fastened the ring to his wife’s belt.","she sees you are not man enough to dare cross the fells, because, forsooth, ’tis blowing and snowing — You know well that soon she must down upon her knees, this poor little thing, and writhe in the worst of torments — and her child shall be called bastard because you dare not face her father — you sit warming the bench in the hall, and dare not so much as lift a finger to safeguard the wife you have and the child that is coming to you —"
*,*,"There were also the envoys from the convent’s farms and fishing villages, and now and then messengers from Tautra.","At times a vessel with folk from the nobles’ seats around would put in when sailing down or up the fjord, and men and their wives, with children and young folk, would go up to Rein to greet a kinswoman among the sisters."
"– Det var blit tusmørke. Et stykke fra mig sad endnu en barnepige. Et lidet pigebarn legte sig foran hende. En dame nærmed sig. Hun talte til barnet. Hun løfted det og kyssed det. Hun stod længe og så på det. Så satte hun det ned på jorden igjen, mens hun tog op en [48] portemonnaie. Jeg så hende gi først et pengestykke til den lille, så et til barnepigen.","- It was getting dark. Some distance from me sat another nanny. A little girl child lay in front of her. A lady approaching. She spoke to the child. She lifted it and kissed it. She stood for a long time looking at it. Then she put it back on the ground while picking up a [48] purse. I saw her give first a piece of money to the little one, then one to the nanny.","Several times during the night Bjørn growled, but otherwise everything was quiet. Shortly past midnight the dog ran over to the door and uttered a couple of short barks. Kristin heard horses in the courtyard and realized that Gaute had come home. She guessed that Jofrid must have sent word to him. The next morning Kristin filled the sacks of the beggars generously, and they hadn’t even passed the manor gate before she saw Jofrid and Gaute heading swiftly toward her house. Kristin sat down and picked up her spindle. She greeted her children gently as they came in and asked Gaute about the hay.","A noise came to her ears of horses being led out, and she went and looked forth between the small pillars of the penthouse. One of the house-carls was leading out two horses, and Gaute came forth from the stable doorway; the child Erlend was sitting astride his father’s shoulder. The bright little face looked out about the man’s yellow hair, and Gaute held the boy’s little hands in his great brown one up under his chin. He handed the child to a maid who came across the yard, and mounted his horse. But when Erlend screamed and reached up after his father, Gaute took him again and set him on the saddle-bow before him. At that moment Jofrid came from the hall. “Would you take Erlend with you — whither you are riding?” Gaute made answer he was bound for the mill — the river was like to carry it away, “— and Erlend has a mind to go along with father, he says.”"
"Når dette hændte, blev hun dødbleg.","When this happened, she became deathly pale.","the bread which he offered her was not simply flatbread the way it looked; it signified the Host, panis angelorum, and she accepted the food of angels from his hand.","Kristin told herself that ’twas not like the monk should know aught of her, with whom she had been wed, or her husband’s fate, even if she gave her father’s name."
Nei – jeg vil ikke mere. Jeg vil ikke.,No - I do not want more. I will not.,“You didn’t? It may well be that Nikulaus has found it as difficult to submit to the discipline of the order as many a good monk has.,“You could not?
"Da jeg så mødte dig, var jeg så bange. Ti hvordan turde jeg vel tro, at det kunde komme!","When I then met you, I was so scared. Ten, how dare I think it could come!","Then Fru Ragnhild stepped forward. She was a short, thin old woman with a wide, flat face and a little, round red nose that looked like a button.","The nuns in the cloister met the visitation at first with a kind of bewildered calm. They settled them down for good in the convent hall, kept a fire blazing night and day in the great masoned fireplace, slept there, and there took their food."
"Du vil kunne spørge efter. Du vil kunne få vide en masse ting om mig. Folk vet jo alt. Du vil få vide, at jeg blev skilt, man vil sige, det var min feil, du vil få vide om mit forhold til Bredo.","You will be able to ask for. You will be able to know a lot of things about me. People know everything. You will find out that I was divorced, one would say it was my fault, you will find out about my relationship with Bredo.","The church towered above the treetops in the garden, eerie and dark and indistinct in a liver-red haze. They had been forced to row all the way into the fjord in the becalmed sea, said Skule. Then he shifted his clothes a bit and told her more about his brothers. He had been sent on a mission by Sir Bjarne to southern Norway in the spring, so he could bring her recent news from Ivar and Gaute because he had traveled back north through the countryside and over the mountains from Vaagaa, home to Vestland.","“They sing a ballad of it; ay, they sing now that he took the maid with iron and with steel, and he fought her kinsmen three livelong days on the mountain — and the feast that Sir Sigurd held at Sundbu, and whereat he made peace betwixt the kinsmen with silver and with gold, for that too Gaute gets all the honour in the ballad — and it seems to make no matter that ’tis all a lie; Gaute rules the whole parish and somewhat beyond — and Jofrid rules Gaute —” Kristin shook her head, with her little sad smile. But she grew young of face as she gazed on Skule. Now seemed it to her that he was most like his father — after all, the young warrior with the ravaged face had the most of Erlend’s gallant mettle — and that he had so early had to take his fate into his own hands had given him a cool firmness of spirit that filled his mother’s heart with a strange security."
"Der lå byen, et underligt, mangehodet, mangøiet, af menneskene skabt væsen, i kåbe af damp, pustende røg. Den tog næring fra skibe, fra jernbaner. Telefontråde og telegraftråde var nerver, hvori det suste, følte og tænkte, gik med bud. Så stansed øiet: Der var det, der var gaden. Hvilket var det blandt tagene?","There lay the city, a strange, multi-headed, man-made creature, man-made, in the mantle of steam, puffing smoke. It took nourishment from ships, from railways. Telephone wires and telegraph wires were nerves in which the whirring, feeling, and thinking went with bids. Then the eye stopped: There was what was the street. Which was it among the roofs?","He never held on to anger or injustice any more than he held on to anything else. Gunnulf, he was so handsome, and he looked at peace when I laid out his body. I’m certain that God the Almighty knows that Erlend never harbored rancor toward any man, for any reason.” Erlend’s brother looked at her, his eyes wide.","Then, ’twas said, Nikulaus had broken out into flat disobedience to the abbot’s behests, had charged his brethren with having wasted the cloister’s goods in high living, with sluggishness in the worship of God, and with looseness in their talk. The matter, said Gunnulf, was kept, for the most part, within the convent walls, as was but reason; but ’twas said, too, that he had defied the brother whom the abbot appointed to chasten him. For some time he had lain in the penitentiary cell, Gunnulf knew, but since then he had humbled him, when the abbot threatened to part him from Brother Björgulf, and to send one of them to Munkabu — ’twas like it had been the blind brother that egged him on. But on this threat Nikulaus had grown meek and contrite."
Jeg søger at se og forestille mig. Men mine jordsanser strækker ikke til.,I seek to see and imagine. But my earthly senses do not stretch.,"“If I have to go alone . . . Mother, may I have your permission to go out there myself?”","Should we dare to murmur under His chastisement — we who have seen His consecrated brides go forth to meet the sword that has been drawn by reason of the world’s sins? They watched and prayed while we sinned and each day forgot our Maker — shut them from the world within the citadel of prayer while we scoured the world around, driven by greed of great and small possessions, of our own lusts and our own wrath."
"Å aldrig, aldrig kan du som siger, at du intet havde oplevet før, ha følt dette som jeg følte inde i mig, da det så alligevel kom, brevene dine, altsammen. Det var som undergjerninger. Jeg tror sikkert, at jeg har havt det deiligste af os to.","Oh never, never can you who say that you had not experienced anything before, have felt this as I felt inside me when it came anyway, your letters, everything. It was like miracles. I probably think I've had the most delicious of the two of us.","All of a sudden he would start shaking with cold. But Sister Agata sat calmly, saying her prayers. When the fits of coughing seized hold of him, she would stand up, put one arm around his head, and hold a cup under his mouth.","Before long she lay in a burning fever, groaning, and sweating blood from all her body. Kristin’s heart shuddered within her — doubtless she, too, would be as wretchedly afraid as this when her time came. ’ Twas not alone that death was sure — ’twas the awful horror that clung about death from pestilence."
"Det var ved midnatstid, at jeg kvak op ved en røst, der virked ubehagelig på mig:",It was at midnight that I whimpered in a voice that seemed uncomfortable to me:,"She was young and unmarried, because she could see her own thick brown braids, which hung down in front of her shoulders.","— While the morning sun lit up the high-set coloured panes deep among the pillars of the choir, and a glory, as of red and brown and green and blue gems, dimmed the light from the tapers on the altar and from the golden shrine behind, Kristin listened to the last vigil — the matins."
"Da hun skulde gå, satte hun op sit hår foran speilet. Jeg droges mod hende. Vi så begge vore ansigter i speilet. Hun så mit. Jeg så hendes.","When she was about to leave, she put her hair up in front of the mirror. I was drawn to her. We both saw our faces in the mirror. She saw mine. I saw her.","“Are you in pain, my Jofrid?” he asked awkwardly. His face was fiery red from the cold, and he looked genuinely unhappy as he watched his mother helping Jofrid get settled, taking off her shoes and socks and tending to her swollen feet and legs. “Are you in pain, my Jofrid?” he kept asking.","Kristin sat sorrowful, her cheek upon her hand. That night, long ages ago, when she herself gathered together her precious things in a casket that she might steal from home — most of what she had laid together were gifts from the father and mother she had beshamed in secret and was planning to grieve and dishonour in full light of day — — But if these were Jofrid’s own possessions, and her heritage, in trinkets alone, from her mother, she must come from a most wealthy home. Kristin would reckon the gear she saw here to be worth more than thirty marks pure silver — the scarlet dress alone, with white fur and silver clasps and the silk-lined cape that belonged thereto, had cost ten to twelve marks at the least."
"Derpå stansed hendes gråt. Og – – hun sovned ved mit bryst, der vi sad!!",Then her crying stopped. And - - she fell asleep by my chest as we sat !!,"Kristin and Jofrid watched the meeting from the entryway to the weaving room, but they couldn’t hear what was said. The men went up to the loft, and the two women retreated inside the weaving room.","— it all seemed to her so immodest and disgustful — Lavrans stayed behind out in the woods, but Gaute came home to the evening meal, tired and hungry."
"Jeg havde været så stolt og sterk. Og nu var jeg som espeløvet. Hvergang det atter kom for mig, sådan som jeg havde ståt derude, sådan som hendes stemme havde lydt derindefra, så brændte mit bryst, der hvor hendes hode havde ligget.","I had been so proud and strong. And now I was like the aspen leaf. Every time it came to me again, as I had stood out there, as her voice had sounded from within, my chest burned where her head had lain.","The gilded weather vane on the crossed timbers of the gable of the new storeroom glittered against the blue haze covering the mountains in the distance. This year, after the wet spring, the grass was so fresh on the rooftops. Kristin gave a little sigh, cast another glance at little Erlend, and then turned back to the chests.","— her cheeks’ soft rounding was quite worn away, and all the more clearly could it be seen how large and strong was her lower jaw. Jofrid yawned, dragged her up into a sitting posture, and looked round for her foot-gear. Kristin helped her to draw them on."
Den høieste autoritet i verden er det deilige.,The highest authority in the world is the delicious.,. .,Kristin was silent.
"Hun begyndte at tale om barndomsdage. Billeder, der havde været glemte under livets uro, steg op for hende, og med hodet på [54] min skulder sad hun og rulled frem for mig dag efter dag fra den tid før noget havde hændt hende.","She started talking about childhood days. Images that had been forgotten during the turmoil of life rose up before her, and with her head on [54] my shoulder she sat and rolled before me day after day from the time before anything had happened to her.",She wondered: Had she turned cowardly? She had never felt this way before.,"And she would grow jealous if her mother-in-law made too much of little Erlend. — Out in the yard there grew in the short, trodden grass certain herbs with coarse, dark, leathery leaves. But now, in the sunny days of midsummer, there sprang a little stalk, with clear, pale-blue flowerets, up from the middle of each flattened whorl."
– Som du kysser ingen i verden.,- As you kiss no one in the world.,"She looks pale, but I suppose you must know best.","“Child, you must not touch blood now — know you not so much as that even —?”"
"Det var det høieste af alt, når du talte. Da tror jeg, du gav mig det største du kunde gi mig.",It was the highest of all when you spoke. Then I think you gave me the greatest you could give me.,"Kristin’s heart was filled with dread; no doubt she would be just as pitifully frightened when her turn came. It was not just the fact that death was certain, but it was the horrifying fear that accompanied death from the plague.","“Fie upon you, Magnhild; what ugly heathenish talk is this? ’ Twere fit"
*,*,"The servants were still standing there; she could make out Jofrid’s light-colored gown and wimple, and the child like a red speck in her arms.","She too had trodden underfoot her duty as a daughter and sold her honour, because she could not win the man she had set her heart on at a cheaper rate; but once she had won her will, she was the most faithful and modest of wives."
"Kjære, jeg føler det somom du pisker mig hele dagen. Og jeg er blit saa liden og foragtelig, og jeg kan ikke forstå, at jeg nogensinde har turdet regne mig for din, og jeg tør ikke gå til dig. Du er så langt borte, du sidder oppe i en tordensky og ser ned på mig. Og hvis jeg kom og kyssed dig, så vilde du støde mig bort fra dig. Og det må ikke ske. Nei, det må ikke ske!","Honey, I feel like you're whipping me all day. And I have become so small and contemptible, and I can not understand that I have ever dared to count myself as yours, and I dare not go to you. You are so far away, you are sitting up in a thundercloud and looking down on me. And if I came and kissed you, you would push me away from you. And it must not happen. No, it must not happen!","I threw a wooden bat at you, and it struck you on the forehead. Do you remember? Mother, while we’re alone, tell me that you’ve fully forgiven me for that!” Kristin let out a deep breath. Yes, she remembered.","“My son — what ails you?” whispered the mother, in fear. She felt in the dark that the man shook his head. Then he let her go, and together they went upward to the church."
– Jeg elsker dig.,- I love you.,"At that moment a procession of English pilgrims appeared, singing and carrying banners and lighted tapers.",In the midst of the flock of boys she took the steep path that led down the Steinberg heights — and now cow-bells clinked and herdsmen whooped around them — the cows were bound homewards from the town pastures.
Slik som jeg længted efter morgendagen havde jeg aldrig længtet.,Sweets as I longed for tomorrow I had never longed for.,But then she suddenly recalled what Andres Simonssøn had said in his childish wisdom.,"For long she wandered hither and thither on the outskirts of the crowd, lulling the shrieking child."
"Men da jeg havde siddet en stund, syntes jeg, jeg hørte det gråte udenfor vinduet, og henover sjøen. Jeg lukked op, men derude var det stille, og Karlsvognen og Melkeveien lå nede på bunden af vandet uden at røre sig.","But when I had sat for a while, I thought I heard the crying outside the window, and across the sea. I opened up, but out there it was quiet, and Karlsvognen and Melkeveien lay down at the bottom of the water without moving.","Not many women her age, now close to half a century, enjoyed such good health; that was something she had noticed on her way through the mountains. Lord, if only you would give me this and this and this, then I will thank you and ask for nothing more except for this and this and this.","She thought of her parting from her father on this spot all these long years agone, of her parting from Gaute but two days back. In childlike thoughtlessness her sons had offended against her — yet she knew that, even had they offended against her as she against her father — wilfully and in sin — it could never have changed her heart toward them. ’"
*,*,But now people were already uncertain whether Jofrid would prove to be generous with the food if there should be a shortage among the peasants.,for then would he have prayed that he might have leave to go with them and bear the child for Mary Virgin.
"Jeg kunde sidde og læse, og hun var i stuen, og jeg mærked det ikke.",I could sit and read and she was in the living room and I did not notice it.,"Suddenly she remembered so clearly her dream about him the night before, up in the mountains: She dreamed that she was standing in the sunshine in a courtyard of some grand estate, and Brother Edvin was walking toward her from the doorway to the main house. His hands were full of bread, and when he reached her, she saw that she had been forced to do as she envisioned, to ask for alms when she came to the villages.","Brother Arngrim gave Kristin to understand that he marvelled Christ and Mary would make the path so stony for their poor brethren’s feet. “They chose poverty themselves, while they lived on earth,” said Kristin. “ ’Tis easy for you to say such things, rich woman as you doubtless are,” said the monk angrily. “I warrant you have never proved what it is to go fasting —” and Kristin must even avow that so it was —"
Hun gik ind i værelset og kom tilbage og råbte:,She went into the room and came back and shouted:,"He was more than happy if she would accept such lodgings for the night as he could offer, and he promised that he himself would sail to Tautra with her on the day after the feast.","Thus, after all, she would come to live out her old age with certain of her sons — although not in the fashion she had thought."
"Men der var en evig brand og brænding, som så atter kom igjen.","But there was an eternal fire and burning, which then came again.","Kristin wasn’t pleased to hear the monk talk in this manner, and she didn’t believe his claims that the abbess had not been chosen in accordance with Church law or that the nuns slept through their daily prayers, gossiped, and carried on unseemly conversations at the table in the refectory.","And Kristin’s yearning moved with the cloud-flocks northward on the long road that lay before her, hurried over the Dale, in among the great mountains that blocked the way, and along the steep tracks across the uplands."
"Jeg hørte ikke bare på dine ord, jeg følte, hvordan du følte det, du tænkte.","I did not just listen to your words, I felt how you felt what you were thinking.",Then Fru Ragnhild herself fell ill.,you should taste the birch —”
"– Hører du, det blæser? Det blæser: Jeg elsker dig.",- Do you hear it blowing? It's blowing: I love you.,"Kristin was pressed back into the nearest alleyway, but there too people on horseback and on foot were streaming toward the church, and the crowds grew so fierce that she finally had to save herself by climbing up onto a stone wall. The air above her was filled with the clanging of bells; from the cathedral the nona hora2 was rung.","she must seek out, for, as her bailiff, he had charge of the shares she still had in some farms north of the fells and meant now to give in payment for her commons in the Rein cloister. But ’twas like he would have with him now his kinsfolk from the farm at Skaun; so she must wait."
"Og så kommer du og finder mig, når jeg er færdig. Du er mand, og du har såmeget at udrette på jorden endnu. Men jeg venter på dig. Jeg er kvinde, og kvinden er til for at gi manden mod og kraft til at gjøre alt det, han skal gjøre på jorden.","And then you come and find me when I'm done. You are a man, and you have so much to accomplish on earth yet. But I'm waiting for you. I am a woman, and the woman is there to give the man the courage and strength to do all that he has to do on earth.","They moved into the convent hall for good, kept a fire going day and night in the big brick fireplace, and ate and slept in there. Sira Eiliv advised everyone to keep great fires burning in the courtyards and in all the houses, but the sisters were afraid of fire. The oldest sisters had told them so often about the blaze thirty years before. Mealtimes and work regimens were no longer adhered to, and the duties of the various sisters were no longer kept separate as children began to arrive, asking for food and help.","On the high-seat bench, where a great crucifix gleamed in the dusk on the light-hued wall, lay the abbess, and Sister Kristin and Sister Turid sat at her hands and feet. It was nine days since the last death among the sisters, and five days since any had died in the cloister or the nearer houses. The pestilence seemed to be lessening throughout the parish, too, said Sira Eiliv. And for the first time for near three months something like a gleam of peace and hope and comfort fell upon the silent and weary folk that sat together there."
"Hun var kommet til mig. Jeg havde tat hende ind til mig. Og jeg havde jo netop tænkt: Hun har måske elsket og er blit skuffet, er blit såret deri. Jeg havde været stolt netop over det, at hun kunde [28] lægge sit hode så trygt mod mit bryst, uden at jeg stilled hende et eneste spørsmål, uden at der for mig var nogen fortid.","She had come to me. I had taken her in to me. And I had just thought: She may have loved and been disappointed, has been hurt in it. I had just been proud that she could [28] lay her head so confidently against my chest without me asking her a single question, without there being any past for me.","The ale and mead flowed in rivers in honor of little Erlend. Gaute and Jofrid welcomed their guests as unrestrainedly as if they had been wed and the king himself had married them. Everyone was joyous, and no one seemed to consider that the honor of these two young people was still at stake. But Kristin learned that Jofrid had not forgotten.","she asked, for Jofrid was grown burning red and looked at the other aghast. The girl scraped some blood and fibre from her white arm with the knife. “Ay,” she said, low, but right firmly. “Never had I cast away good name and honour needlessly."
"Jeg er sluttet at arbeide … Jeg falder sammen … Menneskene (han så sig om) … menneskene, jeg går blandt dem, fordi jeg hader (han steg i stemmen).","I have stopped working… I collapse… The people (he looked around)… the people, I walk among them because I hate (he rose in his voice).","The birch-covered slopes of the low-lying hills, the gray scree, and the brown, marshy patches all melded together, but above the expanse of mountain plateaus arched the fathomless, clear bowl of the evening sky. It was mirrored white in all the puddles of water; scattered and paler was the mirrored shimmer of the sky in a little mountain stream, which raced briskly and restlessly over rocks and then trickled out onto the sandy bank of a small lake in the marsh. Again it came upon her, that peculiar feverlike inner vision.","Yet at the same time, looking within herself, she saw pictures like the visions that high fever brings — within her was an empty house, wholly soundless, dark, and breathing desolation. The vision changed — a strand at ebb, the tide far withdrawn from it; pale, worn stones; heaps of dark, lifeless tangle; all kinds of driftage — Then she settled her bag more easily on her shoulder, grasped her staff, and set forth on her way down into the Dale."
"Den ene af dem var hendes. Den kom ud gjennem nøglehullet og dørsprækken, sådan som en stemme kommer fra mørket, løst fra alt det som ses. Jeg så hele hendes sjæl bag den. Aldrig havde jeg hørt den slig, aldrig havde jeg vidst, at jeg elsked den slig, den samme stemme, som havde lydt for mig så ofte, små blinkende lyd, der vinder sig som guldhår om nerverne, så de blir varme, og de vet ikke hvad det er, de vet bare, at de blir så varme, og har det så godt der inde i den sangen.","One of them was hers. It came out through the keyhole and the doorway, as if a voice were coming from the darkness, loose from all that is seen. I saw her whole soul behind it. Never had I heard it like that, never had I known that I loved it like that, the same voice that had sounded to me so often, small flashing sounds that wind like gold hair around the nerves so they get hot and they know not what it is, they just know they get so hot, and feel so good in there in that song.","Vergers accepted the tapers of pilgrims and placed them on the small mound-shaped towers bedecked with spikes that had been set up throughout the church. As the daylight faded behind the colored panes of glass, the church grew warm with the smell of burning wax, but gradually it also filled with a sour stench from the rags worn by the sick and the poor. When the choral voices surged beneath the vaults, the organ swelled, and the flutes, drums, and stringed instruments resounded, Kristin understood why the church might be called a ship. In the mighty stone building all these people seemed to be on board a vessel, and the song was the roar of the sea on which it sailed. Now and then calm would settle over the ship, as if the waves had subsided, and the voice of a solitary man would carry the lessons out over the masses. Face after face, and they all grew paler and more weary as the vigil night wore on. Almost no one left between the services, at least none of those who had found places in the center of the church. In the pauses between nocturns they would doze or pray.","you lived with him. Such forgetfulness he wrought in you that you remembered not, when you thought thoughts you yourself blushed at, that you could not hide the thoughts of your heart from an all-knowing God —” Kristin gazed before her. “Now I know not, Gunnulf, if you are right in this — I wot not that I have forgotten at any time that God saw into my heart — all the greater, belike, is my sin. And, moreover, ’tis not so, as you deem perchance, that I had most need to blush for my immodest wantonness and for my weakness — rather must I feel shame that my thoughts of my husband were many a time more bitter than the poison of serpents. But like enough it must needs have come to this — ’twas you who once said to me, that they who have loved one another with the fieriest desire come in the end to be as two vipers biting each other’s tails. “But it has been my comfort in these years, Gunnulf, as often as I thought how ’twas Erlend’s lot to go before God’s judgment-seat unhouseled and unholpen, struck down with wrath in his heart and blood upon his hands —"
"[114] Måske havde det alt måttet bli så, fordi jeg var sådan. Havde jeg ikke været sådan, var hun ikke blit drevet til det hun gjorde. Men jeg kjendte ikke mig selv.","[114] Maybe it all had to be that way because I was like that. Had I not been like that, she would not have been driven to what she was doing. But I did not know myself.","And the work mounted for the few who were left to tend to everything. One day she happened to hear that Skule was still in Nidaros. The members of his crew had either died or fled, and he hadn’t been able to find new men. He was well, but he had cast himself into a wild life, just as many young people, out of despair, had done.","And now a faint gleam of light was to be seen low down, as of a lanthorn set upon the ground. Close by it the darkness seemed moving. The nuns pressed together, moaning almost soundlessly amid whispered prayers, went a few steps, halted and listened, and went on again. They were"
"Men idet det forvirret stormed i mig, alt det, som havde forfulgt mig i den sidste tid, gled væk, alt det, som havde været hos mig fra først af, kom igjen, – løb jeg didhen, tvang hende ned i sofaen, la mig på knæ foran hende, råbte, hvad jeg før ikke engang havde hvisket:","But as it confused stormed in me, all that had haunted me lately, slipped away, all that had been with me from the beginning, came again, - I ran there, forced her down on the couch, let me on my knees in front of her, shouting what I had not even whispered before:","Now she realized that her mother’s heart had been deeply etched with memories of her daughter, memories of her thoughts about the child from before she was born and from all the years the child could not remember, memories of fears and hopes and dreams that children would never know had been dreamed on their behalf, before it was their own turn to fear and hope and dream in secret. Finally the gathering of kinsmen split up, and some went to stay with Jammælt at Formo while others accompanied Sigurd over to Vaagaa. Then one day two of Gaute’s leaseholders from the south of the valley came racing into the courtyard.","Kristin crept out swiftly, thrust her feet into her shaggy fur shoes, and threw on her wadmal dress and fur coat. In the dark she groped her way to the fireplace, squatted down, and blew and raked in the ashes; but there kindled no least spark — the embers had died out in the night. She drew out the flint and steel from her belt-pouch, but the tinder must have got wet — ’twas frozen. At last she gave up the struggle, took the fire-pan and went up to borrow live embers from Jofrid. A good fire was burning in the little fireplace of the loft, casting its shine out into the room. In the flickering light Jofrid sat sewing the copper buckle more firmly upon Gaute’s reindeer coat."
Og kanske alt vilde ha gåt anderledes da.,And maybe everything would have gone differently then.,"She zealously tended to her husband’s welfare and honor as she perceived it, and at home she indulged him as best she could.",The only one that seemed not wholly happy in this gathering of kinsmen was Sir Jammælt Halvardssön.
"Jeg er blevet så rolig. Og nu ser jeg alt så klart, og jeg vil forsøge at forklare dig alt, forat du måske kan forstå bedre hvordan jeg er. Og så vil du måske engang tilgi mig. Ja, jeg vet du vil tilgi mig. For du må.","I have become so calm. And now I see everything so clearly, and I will try to explain everything to you, so that you may better understand how I am. And then you might one day forgive me. Yes, I know you will forgive me. Because you have to.","Would you have wanted to lose all the years you’ve lived since then?” Fourteen days later Kristin saw for the first time someone who was ill with the plague. Rumors had reached Rissa that the scourge was laying waste to Nidaros and had spread to the countryside; how this had happened was difficult to say, for everyone was staying inside, and anyone who saw an unknown wayfarer on the road would flee into the woods or thickets. No one opened the door to strangers. But one morning two fishermen came up to the convent, carrying between them a man in a sail.","A choking stench came from the sick man, that the smoke availed not to deaden — filth, blood, sour sweat, and a noisome smell from his throat. She thought of Skule’s words about the lemming swarm; once more there came upon her the awful longing to fly, though she knew there was no place whither one could flee from this. But when once she had taken heart of grace and touched the dying man, the worst was over; and she helped as well as she might until he had breathed his last. He was black in the face already when he died. The nuns walked in procession, with the holy relics, crosses, and burning tapers, round the church and the cloister hill, and all in the parish who could walk or crawl went with them."
*,*,He took when they were innocent children; for them you need never fear.,"“And your husband, Kristin — God be merciful to his soul —"
"Jeg har skrevet af det, hun efterlod mig. Jeg har skrevet det af altsammen. Der er måske ting, der kommer op igjen, eller som er uvæsentlige, men for mig er hun i hver linje, og jeg kan ikke kritisere.","I have written of what she left me. I have written it of all. There may be things that come up again, or that are insignificant, but to me she is in every line and I can not criticize.","God forgive them, thought Kristin, but she felt as if her heart was too weary to grieve over these things properly. And apparently even in the villages there was plenty of sin and depravity. They heard little about it at the convent because there they had no time to waste on such talk. But Sira Eiliv, who went everywhere, ceaselessly and tirelessly tending to the sick and dying, told Kristin one day that the agony of people’s souls was worse than that of their bodies.","“Oh, oh, my bannock; you’ve thrown dirt on it!” Kristin let go the abbess’s arm, and ran forward through the churchyard gate. She pushed aside some dark shapes of men’s backs, stumbled over heaps of upturned earth, and then was at the edge of the open grave. She went down on her knees, bent over, and lifted up the little boy who stood at the bottom, still whimpering because the dirt had spoiled the good bannock he had been given for staying quietly down there."
– Jeg render rundt det samme kvartal?,- I run around the same quarter?,"Then she woke up, her face wet with tears.","But a fat, kind, cheerful countrywoman who had sat dozing a little against the foot of the pillar just behind them, with a bearskin below her and another over her lame legs, awoke now and drew Kristin’s"
Han så atter på mig. Så sa han hurtig:,He looked at me again. Then he said quickly:,"Kristin put away the honey box. Then she continued to sit there, with nothing to occupy her hands.","— you must tell your grandmother you are not afraid your father will fail you —” He made the sign of the cross over the child and laid it back in Kristin’s lap, went over to the bed, and gazed on the slumbering young mother: “ ’Tis as well with my Jofrid as can be, say you?"
– Nu er folk begyndt at gå nede på gaden. De iler til sit arbeide. Jeg hører træskoene ramle. De tunge arbeidsvogne knager i stenene.,- Now people have started walking down the street. They hurry to their work. I hear the clogs rumble. The heavy work wagons creak in the rocks.,"“No, it’s not the Virgin Mary, Sister Torunn. It’s Hel. She’ll leave the parish, taking her rakes and brooms, when they sacrifice an innocent man at the gate of the cemetery. By tomorrow she’ll be far away.” “What can she mean?”","“Stay a little — see you not our lives at the least are forfeit — mayhap all we own — now that these full-fed monks’ whores have stuck their noses into this! Never must they come away from here to spread the tidings of it —” Not a man moved — but Sister Agnes broke into a shrill shriek, and cried in a wailing voice: “O sweet Jesus, my bridegroom — I thank Thee that Thou sufferest Thy handmaidens to die for the glory of Thy name —!”"
*,*,"May God help both of you, just as I will help you as best I can!”","Signe Gamalsdatter was not fair, and she looked worn and old, but she was gentle and winning."
Jeg reiste hjem samme aften. Men jeg frygted at se hende igjen.,I went home that evening. But I was afraid to see her again.,"“They too chose poverty while they lived on this earth,” said Kristin. “That’s easy for you to say, being the wealthy woman that you surely must be,” replied the monk indignantly.","— then they heard a door shut to, away under the mountain. The faint grey dawn began to show, the scree across the lake and the clumps of birch came into sight — then the other Dovre man and the man from Oslo took their place."
"Så var det, der ud af alt dette atter strøg mod mig drømmen om det, jeg ikke havde turdet tænke mig, men så sår og blød.","Then it was that out of all this again stroked against me the dream of that which I had not dared to think, but so sore and soft.",And yet in this regard Gaute seemed less willing to comply with his wife’s wishes; he tried to hold on to his old companions from his youth.,"When they talked among themselves, she felt that their lives and their concerns were slipping now beyond her range of sight — the two who had come from without had parted them from their home already, and the two who dwelt on the manor would soon, for sure, be taking its governance out of her hands. The meeting fell in the middle of the spring dearth, and she saw now that Gaute must have made ready for it by saving fodder in winter more than was common, and he had borrowed fodder from Sir Sigurd too — but all this he had ordered without taking counsel with her."
Hvorfor kan jeg ikke få fred for det? Jeg synes det store fipskjægget rører ved [91] mig igjen. Hvorfor skal det komme op igjen netop nu? Væk! Væk!,Why can I not have peace for it? I think the big goatee touches [91] me again. Why should it come up again right now? Away! Away!,"You loved God the way you loved your father: not as much as you loved your own will, but still enough that you always grieved when you had to part from him. And then you were blessed with having good grow from the bad which you had to reap from the seed of your stubborn will. “Your sons . . . Two of them","You loved God as you loved your father, not so hotly as you loved your own will, yet none the less so that you ever sorrowed much when you forsook Him — and therefore His mercy towards you suffered good to grow, amidst the evil harvest you must needs reap from the seed of your stubborn will — “Your sons — two of them He took to Himself while they were innocent little children; for them you need never fear.

"Ja, jeg fryser. Jeg vil lægge mig. Jeg vil brede over mig den gode, varme dynen. Jeg vil sove.","Yes, I'm freezing. I want to go to bed. I want to spread the good, warm duvet over me. I want to sleep.","“I don’t think you need to worry that he won’t come to Rein this winter because of that, Kristin,” said the priest. “For surely that’s what you fear?” “It’s more than that, Sira Eiliv. I fear that Naakkve was never meant to be a monk.”","“I trow, Kristin, you need have no fear that ’twill hinder his coming hither in the winter, this mischance,” said the priest. “ ’Tis that you feared, belike?” “ ’Tis more than that, Sira Eiliv. I fear me Naakkve never was meant to be a monk.”"
"– Hun har lagt sig. Armene ligger udstrakte opover, smale som slanger, muskuløse. Øinene er lukkede. Sover hun?","- She's gone to bed. The arms are outstretched, narrow as snakes, muscular. The eyes are closed. Is she sleeping?","Kristin nodded. “She’s the fairest child I have ever seen in my life, Kristin,” said Sigurd fervently. Tears welled up in his eyes. “It’s terrible that the Devil has lured Gaute into this misdeed, but surely you will receive these two poor children with kindness, won’t you?”","It chanced, a little while after, that Kristin met Tordis at a manor in the outskirts of the parish. There was sickness amongst the manor-folk and they had not got in their hay; so the brothers and sisters of Olav’s Gild went thither to lend them a hand with the work. In the evening Kristin bore the girl company part of her way home."
"Vi kunde gå hele dagen uden at tale til hinanden, – men så kunde vi mødes i korridoren, og pludselig greb vi hinandens hænder og trykked dem uden at se på hinanden.","We could walk all day without talking to each other - but then we could meet in the corridor, and suddenly we grabbed each other's hands and pressed them without looking at each other.","But somehow she had arrived in the company of Brother Edvin, and the two of them were traveling together and begging.","When they were come down among the tilled lands, and fared through Updal and Soknadal, Brother Torgils got now a ride and now a drive for stretches of the way; but he grew weaker and weaker, and Kristin’s company was ever changing, for folk parted from them and went forward, and new pilgrims came up with them."
"Hun sa det lavt, meget lavt, med en [33] klangløshed, somom hun selv var gåt bort fra de ord, hun udtalte. Hun reiste sig derpå langsomt. Jeg forstod, at hun havde besluttet at gå.","She said it low, very low, with a [33] soundlessness, as if she herself had departed from the words she uttered. She then got up slowly. I understood that she had decided to go.","And doubtless she hadn’t given it any more thought than Kristin had when she sat with the sweet young life at her breast— that as long as they both should live, each day would take the child farther and farther away from her arms. “After you had a child yourself, Kristin, I thought you would understand,” her mother had once said.","And Gaute — he lay there in the loft, with his paramour. The mother sighed again, moved restlessly, and Erlend’s old dog on the bed-spread shifted itself closer against her up-drawn legs. Now she heard that Jofrid was afoot in the loft, walking about the floor."
Men hun svarte på alle mine grunde med et kyssende nei.,But she answered all my reasons with a kissing no.,"In my feet and legs,” replied the girl.","it is, child, your hair —”"
"Jeg vilde ikke tænke på dig. Jeg gjorde alt for ikke at gjøre det. Men det var som noget tvang mig til at gå til dig, og jeg gik og banked på din dør, og min fod gik mod min vilje.",I did not want to think of you. I did everything not to do it. But it was like something forced me to go to you and I went and knocked on your door and my foot went against my will.,"Her big light brown eyes were red-rimmed and always slightly teary. “In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti,” she said clearly, and then swallowed hard. “Bring him to the guesthouse.” Sister Agata, the oldest of the nuns, elbowed her way through the others and, unbidden, followed the abbess and the fishermen who carried the sick man.","Sira Eiliv counselled that great fires should be kept up in the courts and in all the houses where there were fireplaces; but the sisters were afraid of fire — they had heard so many tales from the oldest sisters of the burning of the convent thirty years before. Meal-times and working-hours were kept no longer, and the divers offices of the sisters could not be kept apart, by reason of the many children who came from without, praying for food and help. Sick folk were brought in — these for the most were well-to-do folk who could pay for a grave-stead in the cloister and for masses for their souls, or the poorest and loneliest of the poor who could get no help at home."
*,*,“The poor thing’s chatter is as foolish as she is.,"Soon after winter-night,* rain and sleet set in on the lowlands, storm and snow on the fells."
Jeg fik atter et stik i hjertet. Hun havde tænkt på nogen. Hun havde husket andre kys. Måske på samme bænk havde hun kysset nogen anden. På samme bænk kanske!,I got a stab in the heart again. She had thought of someone. She had remembered other kisses. Maybe on the same bench she had kissed someone else. On the same bench maybe!,"Sleep well in here, and may God’s peace be with you.” One month after the birth of the boy, Gaute held a splendid christening feast, and his kinsmen came from far away to attend the celebration. Kristin assumed that Gaute had asked them to come in order to counsel him on his position; it was now spring, and he could soon expect to hear news from Jofrid’s kin. Kristin had the joy of seeing Ivar and Skule come home together. And her cousins came to Jørundgaard too: Sigurd Kyrning, who was married to her uncle’s daughter from Skog, Ivar Gjesling of Ringheim, and Haavard Trondssøn.","“Oh, deem you then that ’tis true, all such-like things that women say?” asked Jofrid, doubtingly. Then Kristin told of the fire-marks that Naakkve had on his breast. Of set purpose she told the tale so that Jofrid might understand she was yet unwed when she watched the church burning. “You had not thought such things of me, I trow?” she asked, in a low voice."
"Som en drøm var det undertiden kommet over mig, kun om natten, da man overlistes af det, som dagen ikke tør tænke sig: Om hendes legeme nogengang skulde slumre i mine arme. I dæmringen skulde det være til for mig, løndomsfuldt som livets ophav.","Like a dream it had sometimes come over me, only at night, when one is outwitted by that which the day does not dare to imagine: whether her body should ever slumber in my arms. At dusk it was to be for me, secretive as the origin of life.","The morning sun shone so brightly on the little child dressed in red. Young Erlend twirled around in circles, staring down at the grass.","Should Gaute be doomed outlaw — and your father take you home with him, and let you feel his wrath — or should he require that you go into a cloister and atone your sins —” “Send me to a cloister he cannot, without giving such rich gifts with me that ’twere a cheaper bargain and more honourable to make accord with Gaute and take amends from him; see you, so could he wed me off and not need to lay out aught in goods and gear."
"Alle hans ting var forskjellige, høist forskjellige, motiverne forskjellige, ansigterne forskjellige. Der var både glæde, sorg og grubel. Men mig blev altsammen ét.","All his things were different, very different, the motifs different, the faces different. There was joy, sorrow and brooding. But I all became one.","Father thinks he knows better than any man how to trade horses. But a person would have to be more alert than my father is if he wanted to fool Gaute Erlendssøn in an exchange of horses.” Kristin couldn’t help smiling, in spite of her ill temper.","In her heart Kristin denied not that Jofrid seemed much more strong and stout-hearted than she herself had been. But then Jofrid had not profaned the cloister’s holiness, nor broken troth and handfasting, nor lied and deceived and stolen her parents’ honour behind their backs. Even though these two young folks in their rashness had sinned against the law of the land, against duty and all seemliness — yet so sore a conscience they needed not to have."
*,*,But not much was allowed to take place behind her back.,"“Signe were a more towardly daughter-in-law to bide in a house with, I trow — and easy for you sure it cannot be to give up the reins here, where you have been wont to rule.”"
