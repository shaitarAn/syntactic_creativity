"Hun tok imot ham, høvisk, blid og kjølig, da han utpå dagen kom til Husaby. Uspurt sa hun ikke et ord til ham, heller ikke et uvennlig, og hun mælte ikke imot da han om kvelden, likesom prøvende, kom bort for å legge seg i husbondssengen. Men da de hadde ligget en stund, forsøkte han nølende å legge sin hånd på hennes bryst.","She received him, polite, gentle and cool, when he came to Husaby at the end of the day.

When they had lain awhile, he tried, falteringly, to lay a hand on her shoulder.","She received him politely, her demeanor gentle and cool, when he arrived at Husaby later in the day.

"«Glemme slikt kan vel en mann ikke i denne heimen. Og det er så, jeg har følt selv det ble ikke bedre mellom oss efter jeg hadde fått vite dette.

"«Ja, du er jo ikke bror min nu mere enn du er hver manns bror,» sa Erlend og undret seg over den dype bitterhet i sin stemme.","""Yes, you are not my brother now any more than you are every man's brother,"" Erlend said, wondering at the deep bitterness in his voice.","“Aye, you are no brother of mine now, I trow, any more than you are brother to all mankind,” said Erlend, and wondered at the deep bitterness in his own voice.","“Well, you aren’t as much my brother anymore as you are the brother of all men,” said Erlend, surprising himself by the great bitterness in his own voice."
"Hjemfreden på dette sted tok underlig sterkt i Erlend. Han stod tafatt og biet på Lavrans, som gikk den fremmede i møte – værfaren hadde stått nede ved vedskålen og snakket med en mann som kløvde skigardsskier. Han bråstanset da han kjente igjen mågen sin – støtte spydet som han bar i hånden, hardt ned i sneen.","The peace of home in this place took strangely strong in Erlend. He stood awkwardly and begged for Lavrans, who went to meet the stranger - the weatherman had stood down by the wood bowl and talked to a man who was splitting ski farm skis.

He stood uneasily and waited for Lavrans, who came out to meet the stranger — he had been standing down by the woodshed talking to a man who was splitting fence-staves.

He stood there, irresolute, and waited for Lavrans, who was coming forward to greet the stranger. His father-in-law had been over by the woodshed, talking to a man splitting rails for a fence.

"Sira Eiliv hadde brakt barna til kaupangen. Han hadde søkt erkebiskopen om orlov fra sin kirke og tillatelse til å gjeste sin bror i Tautra; det fikk Erlend Nikulaussøns prest gjerne. Nu mente han at Kristin kunne ikke sitte i byen med så mange barn å dra omsorg for, og han bød til å ta med Nåkkve og Bjørgulf ut i klostret.","Sira Eiliv had brought the children to Kaupangen. He had applied to the archbishop for leave from his church and permission to visit his brother in Tautra; Erlend Nikulaussøn's priest was happy to do that. Now he thought that Kristin could not sit in the city with so many children to take care of, and he offered to take Nåkkve and Bjørgulf out to the monastery.","Sira Eiliv had brought the children to the city. He had prayed the Archbishop to let him leave his church awhile and visit his brother at Tautra; and this was readily granted to Erlend Nikulaussön’s house priest.

"Da hun skjønte at Haftor mente det for ramme alvor som han bad om, best de lå der og snakket, var hun blitt så forbauset så hun kom seg ikke til å være hverken redd eller ordentlig harm. De var jo gift begge, begge hadde de barn med sine ektefeller. Hun hadde visst ikke riktig trodd på at det kunne være sant slikt hendte. Enda for alt hun selv hadde gjort og levd – nei, dette hadde hun trodd ikke hendte. Lattermild og munter og kjælen hadde Haftor vært – hun kunne ikke få seg til å kalle det han hadde villet lokke henne; så alvorlig hadde han ikke vært. Men han hadde villet ha henne til å gjøre den verste synd –.","When she realized that Haftor meant the seriousness he asked for, the best they were lying there talking about, she had become so astonished that she could not be either afraid or really angry. They were both married, they both had children with their spouses. She had not really believed that such a thing could happen. Even for everything she herself had done and lived - no, this she had thought did not happen. Laughing and cheerful and affectionate, Haftor had been - she could not bring herself to call what he had wanted to entice her; he had not been so serious. But he had wanted her to commit the worst sin -.","When she understood that Haftor meant in sober sadness what he prayed her for as they lay there talking, she had been so amazed that she seemed unable to be either afraid or greatly angered. Were they not, both of them, wedded, and had not both children by their wedded spouses? She felt she never could have fully believed before that such things happened. Even after all she herself had done and gone through — no; this she must have believed could not befall. Laughing and gay and coaxing had Haftor been with her — she could not bring herself to say he had tried to lure her astray; for that he had not been earnest enough. And yet it seemed he would have had her do the deadliest sin.…","When Kristin realized that Haftor was quite serious about the intentions behind his request as they lay there and talked, she was so astonished that she failed to be either frightened or suitably indignant. They were both married, after all, and they both had children with their spouses. She had never truly believed that such things actually went on. In spite of all she herself had done and experienced—no, she hadn’t believed that such things happened. Haftor had always been merry and affectionate and full of laughter. She couldn’t say that what he wanted was to try to seduce her; he hadn’t been serious enough for that. And yet he wanted her to commit the worst of sins."
"«Det var ikke Orms skyld,» sa Kristin uten å snu seg. Hun satt med ryggen til de to og sydde. «Fjæren var fortrukket da han tok den, og han prøvde å rette den inn. Så urimelig får du da ikke være at du nekter den store sønnen din å bruke en av alle de buene her er på gården. Gi ham da heller en av de som er på ridderloftet.»","""It was not Orm's fault,"" Kristin said without turning around. She sat with her back to the two and sewed. ""The feather was preferred when he took it, and he tried to straighten it. You must not be so unreasonable that you refuse your big son to use one of all the arches here on the farm. Then rather give him one of those who are in the knight's loft. '","“ ’Twas not Orm’s fault,” said Kristin without turning. She was sitting sewing with her back to the two. “The spring was out of gear when he took the bow, and he tried to put it right. You should not be so unfair as to deny a great boy like your son the use of one from among all the bows you have in this house. Rather give him one of the bows that are up in the armoury.”","“It wasn’t Orm’s fault,” said Kristin without turning around. She was sitting with her back to the two, sewing. “The spring was bent when he took it, and he tried to straighten it out. You can’t be so unreasonable to refuse to allow this big son of yours to use a single bow out of all those you have on the estate. Why don’t you give him one of the bows from up in the armory?”"
"«Nei, det skjønner jeg ikke heller – nu,» sa Erlend oppriktig, «men – i helvete! kunne jeg tenke at hun kunne lese skrift! Hun syntes – svært ulærd –»","""No, I do not understand that either - now,"" Erlend said sincerely, ""but - in hell! could I think she could read writing!

"Erlend kom inn i det samme. Han sov i et bur med noen andre menn, for fru Gunna lå hos Kristin i husbondssengen. Og så var han blitt aldeles rasende. Han hadde tatt henne i armen så merkene efter hans fingre stod i holdet hennes enda:","Erlend got into the same thing. He slept in a cage with some other men, because Mrs. Gunna was lying with Kristin in the husband's bed. And then he had become utterly furious. He had taken her by the arm so the marks on his fingers were still in her hold:","Erlend came in at that moment — he had slept in one of the storehouse lofts with some other men, for Lady Gunna lay with Kristin in the great bed. When he saw what was towards he had fallen into a fury. He had grasped Kristin by the arm so hard that the marks of his fingers still showed on her flesh.","At that moment Erlend came into the room. He had been sleeping in a chamber above a storeroom with several other men, since Fru Gunna was sharing Kristin’s bed. And he flew into a rage. He grabbed Kristin by the arm so hard that the marks from his fingers were still on her skin."
"Folk var enige om at en slik adferd av kansleren var lite verdig – men de lo en hel del. Simon hørte på i taushet der han satt med hånden under kinnet. Han tenkte Erlend synte allikevel sitt vennskap for Erling Vidkunssøn på en underlig måte – ja, det gjordes da klart av denne historien at Erling måtte være noe ute av likevekt når han kunne tro at en guttunge, fersk innkommet fra bygden, torde stå og spotte ham opp i hans åsyn på kongsgårdens hallartrapp. At Erlend skulle bry seg om hans forrige svogerskap med fru Elin og herr Erling, kunne han vel neppe ventet.","People agreed that such behavior by the Chancellor was unworthy - but they laughed a lot. Simon listened in silence as he sat with his hand under his cheek. He thought Erlend still found his friendship for Erling Vidkunssøn in a strange way - yes, it was made clear from this story that Erling must be somewhat out of balance when he could believe that a boy, newly arrived from the village, dared to stand and mock him up in his presence on the royal court's hall stairs. That Erlend should care about his previous brother-in-law with Mrs. Elin and Mr. Erling, he could hardly wait.","He held one arm loosely about her, as if he hardly marked that she sat there, whilst he and the other men talked of the feud between Erling Vidkunssön and Chancellor Paal, which was so much in folks’ thoughts just then.","Everyone agreed that such behavior on the part of the chancellor was undignified, but all of them laughed a great deal. Simon listened in silence, sitting with his chin resting on his hand. He thought this was a peculiar way for Erlend to show his friendship for Erling Vidkunssøn. The story made it quite clear that Erling must be a little unbalanced if he could believe that a youth, freshly arrived from the countryside, would dare stand on the stairs to the king’s palace and ridicule him to his face. Erlend could hardly be expected to remember Simon’s former relationship as the brother-in-law of Fru Elin and Sir Erling."
"Konen løftet det bleke, furete ansikt – det brant i de store, innsunkne øyne da hun så opp på mannen. Han holdt hennes hånd enda – hun så på den slik den lå i hans, litt oppløftet. De tre ringer glinset efter hverandre – nederst festensringen, ovenfor den viede ring og ytterst denne –.","The wife lifted the pale, furrowed face - it burned in the big, sunken eyes when she looked up at the man. He was still holding her hand - she looked at it as it lay in his, a little raised. The three rings glistened one after the other - at the bottom the party ring, above the married ring and at the far end this -.","The wife lifted her pale, furrowed face — her great sunken eyes burned as she looked up at her husband. He held her hand still; she looked at it as it lay in his, lifted a little. The three rings gleamed, one above the other — lowest down the betrothal-ring, then the wedding-ring, and above it this one.","Ragnfrid lifted her pale, furrowed face. Her big, sunken eyes burned as she looked up at her husband. He was still holding her hand; she looked at it, lying in his, slightly raised.

"Litt efter sov hun, og Orm gikk bort til den andre sengen. Han kledde av seg og krøp inn. Der var linlaken under og linnets overdrag på putene. Gutten strakte seg nytende ut på det glatte, kjølige leie. Hjertet hans banket av spenning ved disse nye eventyr som farbrorens ord hadde vist ham vei til. Bønner, faster, alt han hadde øvet fordi han var blitt lært til det – ble nytt med ett – våpen i en fager krig som han lengtet mot. Kanskje ville han bli munk – eller prest – hvis han kunne få dispens for det at han var født i ekteskapsbrudd –.","Shortly after, she slept, and Orm went to the other bed. He undressed and crawled inside. There was linen sheet underneath and linen overlay on the pillows. The boy stretched out enjoying the slippery, cool bed. His heart pounded with excitement at these new adventures to which his uncle's words had shown him the way. Prayers, fasting, everything he had practiced because he had been taught to - became new at once - weapons in a beautiful war that he longed for. Maybe he would become a monk - or a priest - if he could get an exemption for being born into adultery -.","Soon after, she fell asleep and Orm went over to the other bed. He stripped and crept in. There was a linen sheet below, and linen covers on the pillows. The boy stretched himself out at ease on the smooth cool couch. His heart beat, thrilled with the thought of these new adventures whereto his uncle’s words had shown the way. Prayers, fasts, all the observances he had practised because he had been taught to — all grew new of a sudden — weapons in a goodly warfare that he longed for. Maybe he would be a monk — or a priest — if he could win dispensation for his birth in adultery.","A moment later she was asleep, and Orm went over to the other bed. He took off the rest of his clothes and crept under the covers. There was a linen sheet underneath and linen cases on the pillows. With pleasure the boy stretched out on the smooth, cool bed.

Prayers, fasts, everything he had practiced because he had been taught to do so, suddenly seemed new to him—weapons in a glorious war for which he longed.

"«Du var alltid den som tok på å tale om Bård, og du var verst til å spotte ham,» sa Erlend forbitret. «Og om du ikke hadde spottet ham i ord – jeg kunne vel vite hvor kjær du hadde hans ære når du tok deg en annen mann under bonden din.

"Den fruen som satt ved Sunnivas side, ville nu se på det og tok efter eplet, den andre ville ikke slippe det, og de to kvinner puffet til hverandre under skrik og latter.

"Så da jeg var seksten vintre gammel, lot far gjøre til meg denne platebrynjen min av spanske stålplater med sølvsmelt – Rikard engelskmann i Oslo satte den sammen, og jeg fikk sverdet mitt – det som jeg alltid bruker – og hestepanseret.

"Utover den neste formiddag lå der en slags forfjamset stillhet over Husaby. Det var dagen før marimesse, og gårdsarbeidet skulle være unnagjort til nons leite, men mennene var tankespredte og alvorlige, og de oppskremte terner slumset med stellet. Folkene var blitt glad i sin unge husfrue – og det gikk nok ikke så godt med henne, spurtes der.","Over the next morning there was a kind of confused silence over Husaby. It was the day before the mass, and the farm work was to be done for nonsense, but the men were thoughtful and serious, and the frightened terns slumbered with the care. The people had fallen in love with their young housewife - and she probably did not do so well, they were asked.","All through the next forenoon a sort of bewildered stillness lay over Husaby. It was the eve of Mary’s Mass, and all the work of the place should have been out of hand by the hour of nones; but the men were bemused and cast down, and the scared serving-wenches scrambled through the house-work in slovenly wise. The house-folk had grown fond of their young mistress — and things were going none too well with her, ’twas said.","The next morning a bewildered silence hovered over Husaby. It was the day before the Feast of the Annunciation and the farm work was supposed to be finished by mid-afternoon prayers, but the men were distracted and somber, and the frightened maids were careless with their chores. The servants had grown fond of their young mistress, and it was said that things were not going well for her."
"Efterhånden var det blitt slik at vakten undertiden gikk ut et ærend når Simon eller Kristin var hos Erlend. Begge disse skjønte og talte seg imellom om det at Erlends første og siste tanke var å komme igjennom denne sak uten at hans medskyldige ble røpet. Til Simon sa han det en dag bent ut. Han hadde lovet alle som han hadde samrådet med, at han skulle holde i repet slik at han selv fikk hugget over labbene hvis det kom til det, «og ennu har jeg da aldri sveket noen som satte sin lit til meg». Simon så på mannen – Erlends øyne var blå og klare; det var greit at han sa dette om seg selv i god tro.","Eventually it had become so that the guard sometimes went out on a errand when Simon or Kristin were with Erlend. Both of these understood and talked among themselves about the fact that Erlend's first and last thought was to get through this case without his accomplice being revealed. To Simon he said it one day bent out. He had promised everyone he had consulted with that he would hold on to the rope so that he himself could cut across the paws if it came to that, ""and yet I have never betrayed anyone who put their trust in me."" Simon looked at the man - Erlend's eyes were blue and clear; it was good that he said this about himself in good faith.","As time went on, it happened now and then that the guards would make themselves an errand without when Simon or Kristin was with Erlend. Both of these two saw — and spoke of it to each other — that Erlend’s first and last thought was to come through this business without the names of those with him in the plot being discovered. To Simon one day he said so straight out. He had promised all who had joined in his counsels that he would hold the rope so that if it came to the worst, the blow should fall on his hands only, “and never yet have I betrayed any that put their trust in me.” Simon looked at the man — Erlend’s eyes were blue and clear; ’twas plain that he said this of himself in all good faith.","Gradually it became a habit for the guard to leave the room on an errand whenever Simon or Kristin was visiting Erlend. Both of them realized, and mentioned it to each other, that Erlend’s first and foremost thought was to make it through the court case without revealing his accomplices. One day he said this quite openly to Simon. He had promised every man who had conspired with him that he would rather cut off his own hand than reveal anything, if it came to that; “and I have never yet betrayed anyone who has put their trust in me.” Simon stared at the man. Erlend’s eyes were blue and clear; it was obvious that he truly believed this about himself."
"Men nu hadde han denne sønnen. Han hadde alltid blygdes ved å legge til med sine egne ord noe enten om ønske eller takk, når han leste sine bønner. Men Kristus og Maria visste vel hva han hadde ment med det at han hadde sagt dobbelt så mange paternoster og aver om dagene i det siste. Og det skulle han bli ved med så lenge han var hjemmefra. Og vise sin takknemlighet på høvelig og rundhåndet vis ellers òg. Så fikk han kan hende hjelp på denne reisen òg.",But now he had this son. He was always ashamed to add in his own words something either wish or thanks when he read his prayers. But Christ and Mary probably knew what he meant by the fact that he had said twice as many paternoster and aver about the days lately. And he would continue to do so as long as he was away from home. And show their gratitude in a polite and generous way otherwise as well. Then he might get help on this journey too.,"But now he had this son. He had ever been ashamed to add in his own words aught of his wishes or his thanks when he said over his prayers. But he deemed that Christ and Mary Virgin knew well what it had meant that he had said double number of Paternosters and Aves each day in these last days. And he would keep on with this so long as he was from home. And in other wise, too, he would show his thankfulness in fitting and open-handed fashion. And thus maybe he would win help on this present journey too.","But now he had a son. Whenever he said his prayers, he had always shied away from adding any of his own words, whether wishes or words of gratitude. But Christ and Mary knew full well what he meant when he had said double the number of Pater noster s and Ave Mariaslately. He would continue to do so as long as he was away from home. And he would show his gratitude in an equally fitting and generous manner. Then perhaps he would receive help on this journey, as well."

"«Ja,» sa Gunnulf dempet. «Det skulle hete at Haftor Olavssøn og Erlend seilte til Bjørgvin. Men det var Kalundborg som ferden gjaldt, og de skulle føre junker Håkon med seg til Norge mens kong Magnus er utenlands og beiler –.»","""Yes,"" said Gunnulf softly. «It should be said that Haftor Olavssøn and Erlend sailed to Bjørgvin.

"«Da skulle du byttet alt det som ligger på loftene dine og er blitt utskjemt for lenge siden,» sa Kristin. «Ellers så vet jeg da det at loven sier, hver mann som bygsler jord, skal så korn på de tre delene, men la den fjerde parten ligge i trede.

""Otherwise, I know then that the law says, every man that girdeth the earth, shall sow corn in the three parts, but let the fourth part lie in the third.

""","“Then should you have bartered away all that wool that lies now in your lofts and is long since spoiled,” said Kristin. “But so much I know, that the law says every man that leases land shall sow corn on three parts of it, and let the fourth part lie fallow for grass.

"Simon vendte seg mot den stuen hvor han og Kristin hadde hatt tilhold inntil nu. Da snudde hun seg ved det nederste trinn av burstrappen og ropte på ham, underlig klinger i røsten:","Simon turned to the living room where he and Kristin had lived until now.

"Så bar en tjenestekone husets nøkler frem til Erlend. Han hektet det tunge knippe på Kristins belte – og han så ut, da han gjorde det, som han helst ville kysset henne med det samme.

"Feet var usselt, magert, skabbet og sårt – og aldri hadde hun sett så mange utgamle naut på ett sted. Bare hestene var vakre og velstelte. Men det var nu ingen av dem som kunne måle seg med Gullsveinen eller Ringdrotten, den hingsten som hennes far hadde nu. Sløngvanbauge, som han hadde gitt henne med hjemmefra, var den vakreste hesten som stod på Husabys stall. Hun måtte ta den om halsen og klemme sitt ansikt inn mot dens kinn da hun kom bort til den. Og disse trøndske stormennene så på den og priste dens digre, grove ben, den dype bringe og høye hals, det lille hodet og de brede lender. Gamlingen fra Gimsar svor både ved Gud og ved fienden at det var stor synd de hadde jelket denne hesten – slik en stridshingst han kunne vært. Da måtte Kristin skryte litt av far dens, Ringdrotten. Han var meget større og grovere, det fantes ikke hingst som kunne tukte ham, ja hennes far hadde da prøvd ham mot de navngjetneste hester helt til inne fra Sogn. De underlige navnene hadde Lavrans gitt dem – Ringdrotten og Sløngvanbauge – fordi de var gyldne på let som lyst gull og tegnet som med rødegullsringer. Mor til Ringdrotten var kommet bort fra stoet en sommer inne ved Rånekampene, og de hadde trodd bjørnen hadde tatt henne, men så kom hun hjem til gården senhøstes. Og den folungen hun hadde fått året efter, var visst ikke alet av hingst som hørte til folket over steinen. Så de røktet over folungen med svovel og med brød, og Lavrans gav merren til kirken for å være tryggere. Men folungen artet seg slik at nu sa han han ville heller miste sitt halve bo enn Ringdrotten.","The cattle were wretched, skinny, itchy and sore - and she had never seen so many old bulls in one place. Only the horses were beautiful and well groomed. But now none of them could compare with Gullsveinen or Ringdrotten, the stallion that her father had now. Sløngvanbauge, which he had given her from home, was the most beautiful horse that stood on Husaby's stable. She had to take it around her neck and squeeze her face against its cheek when she came to it. And these great men from Trøndelag looked at it and praised its huge, coarse legs, the deep breast and high neck, the small head and the wide loins. The old man from Gimsar swore both by God and by the enemy that it was a great pity they had yelled this horse - such a battle stallion he could have been. Then Kristin had to brag a little about her father, Ringdrotten. He was much bigger and rougher, there was no stallion that could discipline him, yes her father had then tried him against the most famous horses all the way from inside Sogn. Lavrans had given them the strange names - Ringdrotten and Sløngvanbauge - because they were golden on light as light gold and drawn as on red gold rings. Ringdrotten's mother had come away from the mare one summer at Rånekampene, and they had thought the bear had taken her, but then she came home to the farm in late autumn. And the foal she had received the following year was certainly not bred by a stallion who belonged to the people over the stone. So they smoked over the foal with sulfur and with bread, and Lavrans gave the mare to the church to be safer. But the foal behaved in such a way that now he said he would rather lose his half nest than Ringdrotten.","The cattle were wretched, lean, galled and scabby; and never had she seen so many aged beasts together, in one place. Only the horses were comely and well-tended. But, even so, there was no one of them that was the equal of Guldsveinen or of Ringdrotten, the stallion her father had now.","The cattle were feeble, gaunt, scabrous, and chafed; never had she seen so many old animals in one place. Only the horses were beautiful and well cared for. But none of them was a match for Guldsvein or Ringdrott, the stallion that her father now owned. Sløngvanbauge, the horse that he had given her from home, was the most splendid horse in Husaby’s stables. She couldn’t resist putting her arm around his neck and pressing her face against his coat when she went over to him. And the gentry of Trøndelag3 looked at the horse and praised his strong, stout legs, his deep chest and high neck, his small head and broad flanks. The old man from Gimsar swore by both God and the Fiend that it was a great sin that they had gelded the horse— what a battle horse he might have been. Then Kristin had to boast a little about his sire, Ringdrott. He was much bigger and stronger; there wasn’t another stallion that could compete with him; her father had even tested him against the most celebrated horses all the way north to this parish. Lavrans had given these horses the unusual names—Ringdrott and Sløngvanbauge—because they were golden in color and had markings that were like reddish-gold rings. The mother of Ringdrott had strayed from the other mares one summer up near the Boar Range, and they thought that a bear had taken her, but then she came back to the farm late in the fall. And the foal she bore the following year had surely not been bred by a stallion belonging to anyone aboveground. So they burned sulfur and bread over the foal, and Lavrans gave the mare to the church, to be even safer. But the foal had grown so magnificent that he now said he would rather lose half his estate than Ringdrott."
"En dag da faren satt hos henne, ville Kristin svøpe barnet selv, så han riktig kunne se hvor vakker og velskapt gutten var. Han lå da naken mellom reiveklutene og sprellet på kvislet foran moren.","One day when the father was sitting with her, Kristin wanted to wrap the child herself, so he could really see how beautiful and well-built the boy was. He then lay naked between the rag cloths and bounced on the twig in front of his mother.","One day when her father sat with her, Kristin had set her heart on swaddling the child herself, so that he might see rightly how fair and well-shaped the boy was.

"Da de steg ut av kirken, ut i morgensolen, møtte en terne med barnet. Kristin satte seg på noen tømmerstokker. Med ryggen til sin husbond satt hun og lot gutten die seg god og mett før hun gikk.

"Så var han kommet utenfor sin slekts skikker, og så gjorde han det som også var uhørt i hans ætt: Uten å rådføre seg med sin far engang beilet han til den rike unge enken på Mandvik.

I djevelens navn, han skulle vise dem alle sammen han kunne få den fineste hustru; hun var enda gjevere med rikdom og alt enn denne trønderen som Kristin hadde latt seg skjemme ut av.

In the name of the devil, he was to show them all he could get the finest wife; she was even more generous with wealth and everything than this Trøndelag man that Kristin had let herself be ashamed of. And a widow, it was all well and good, one knew what was - the devil should believe in maidens more -.","Thus had he departed from the customs of his house; and next he had done another thing unheard of in his kindred: without even taking counsel with his father, he had wooed the rich young widow at Mandvik. He was dazzled when he saw that Lady Halfrid liked him — she was much more rich and high-born than Kristin, being son’s daughter to Baron Tore Haakonssön of Tunsberg, and widow of Sir Finn Aslakssön — and she was comely, and had so fine and noble a bearing that, likened with her, all the women he was used to seemed to him but as farmers’ wives. In the devil’s name, he would show them all that he could win the noblest wife; in riches and all else she bore the bell from this Trönder that Kristin had let herself be smirched by. And a widow — that, too, was well — plain and above-board — the devil might trust in maids any more, for him.","Then he had found himself outside the traditions of his family, and so he did what was also unheard of in his lineage: Without even consulting his father, he had courted the rich young widow of Mandvik.

And she was beautiful, with such a gracious and noble bearing that compared to her, the women in his circle were little more than peasant women, he thought. The Devil take him if he wouldn’t show everyone that he could win the noblest wife; she was even more resplendent with wealth and other possessions than that man from Trønder who had lured Kristin into shame.

"Lyden av sjøbruset og stormen nådde dem dovt og dempet gjennom torvveggene. Av og til pustet trekkvinden inn, åndet på glørne i gruen og blaffet litt med tranlampens flamme.

Gunnulf hadde sittet og skrevet opp ett og annet som broren sa ham om stevner og bumannsheimer, om seilmerker og værvarsler og ord i samenes sprog – alt som Erlend kom til å tenke på det.

Gunnulf had sat down and written down things that his brother had told him about conventions and bumannsheimer, about sail marks and weather warnings and words in the Sami language - everything that Erlend came to think of. Gunnulf himself steered the ship - Sunnivasuden was the name, because the preachers had chosen Saint Sunniva as the patron saint for their initiative.","The roaring of the sea and of the storm came to them lulled and deadened by the turf-walls. Now and then a puff of wind would force its way in, blowing up the embers in the fire-place, and flapping the flame of the train-oil lamp a little. There were no furnishings in the hut; the brothers sat on the low earthen bench that ran round three sides of the room, and between them lay Gunnulf’s writing-board, with ink-horn, feather pen and a roll of parchment. Gunnulf had been writing down one thing and another his brother had told him of trysting-places and settled farms, of sailing-marks and weather signs and words in the Lapp’s tongues — just as the things chanced to come into Erlend’s mind. Gunnulf commanded the ship — she was named the Sunniva, for the Preaching Brothers had chosen St. Sunniva as guardian saint for their mission.","The muffled and muted sound of the storm and the roaring sea reached them through the sod walls. Now and then gusts of wind would blow in, breathe on the embers of the hearth, and make the flame of the oil lamp flicker. There was no furniture in the hut; the brothers were sitting on the low earthen bench which ran along three sides of the room, and between them lay Gunnulf’s writing board with ink horn, his quill pen, and a rolled-up parchment. Gunnulf had been writing down a few notes as his brother told him about meetings and Norwegian settlements, about navigation markers and weather indications and words in the Sami language—everything Erlend happened to think of. Gunnulf was piloting the ship himself; it was named Sunnivasuden, for the friars had chosen Saint Sunniva2 as the patron saint for their endeavor."

"«Ja, han er min frende og eders frende, og herr Ivar fikk meg til å love ham leide – men ikke holdt han sine eder til meg og ikke husket han på frendskapet mellom oss» – kong Magnus lo litt og la igjen en hånd på Erlings arm. «Mine frender frende synes å leve efter det ordet som vi har her til lands om at frende er frende verst.

Now is it my full will to show my kinsman Erlend of Husaby grace for the sake of God and Mary Virgin, and for my own lady’s sake; life and goods and leave here to abide, if he will make his peace with me — lawful respite to remove him from my lands, if he would betake him to his new master, Prince Haakon. — The same grace will I grant to every man who has been leagued with him — but I will know who they are, and which of my men dwelling up and down this land of ours has been a false servant to his lord. What say you, Simon Andressön? — I know that your father was my grandfather’s trusty henchman; you yourself served King Haakon with honour — think you not that I have the right to make inquiry in this matter?”","“Yes, he is my kinsman and yours, and Sir Ivar persuaded me to promise him safe conduct. But he did not keep his promise to me, nor did he remember our kinship.” King Magnus gave a small laugh and then placed his hand on Erling’s arm once more. “Dear friend, my kinsmen seem to live by the saying we have here in Norway: that a kinsman is the worst enemy of his kin. I am quite willing to show mercy to my kinsman, Erlend of Husaby, for the sake of God and Our Lady and my betrothed; I will grant him his life and property and lift the sentence of banishment if he will be reconciled with me; or I will allow him proper time to leave my kingdoms if he wishes to join his new lord, Prince Haakon. This same mercy I will show to any man who has conspired with him—but I want to know which of my men residing in this country have served their lord falsely. What do you have to say, Simon An-dressøn? I know that your father was my grandfather’s faithful supporter, and that you yourself served King Haakon with honor. Do you think I have the right to investigate this matter?”"

It was torture to her — the room was chock-full of women now, and she must pace about like a mare put up for sale. Between-whiles, too, she must let the strange ladies press and feel round about her body with their hands; and then they would talk together. At length Lady Gunna of Raasvold, who was to have the ordering of all things in the room, said that now she might lie down upon the floor.

Simon sat with his father and tried hard to find the smooth and playful tone from before, but the old man moaned incessantly.

De fikk mat hos munkene ved de kirkene som de gjestet, og når de drakk den blodrøde vin og flådde den gyldne skorpe av hvetebrødene, skjønte de fire prester fra bygglandene hvorfor Kristus hadde hedret vinen og hveten, som var renere enn alle andre fødeemner Gud hadde gitt menneskene, med å ville vise seg i disses lignelse under messeofferet –.","He felt powerless with longing for that time - he would never again find the wedding joy of his heart that had filled him completely that spring in Rome.

He shuddered and fainted at seeing how beautiful the world was - and then knowing that all this was nothing compared to the riches of that life. Yet this world greeted them with a thousand small, happy and sweet memories of the groom. The lilies of the field and the birds of the sky reminded him of his words, such donkeys as they saw, and such wells as the stone cisterns they passed by, he had spoken of. They got food from the monks at the churches they visited, and when they drank the blood-red wine and peeled the golden crust from the wheat bread, the four priests from the building lands understood why Christ had honored the wine and the wheat, which were purer than all other foods God had given the people, by wanting to appear in their parable during the Mass sacrifice -.",He was faint with yearning for that time gone by — would he never again find that bridal gladness of heart that had filled his whole being that spring in Rome?,"He felt faint with longing for that time—would he ever again find that nuptial joy in his heart that had filled him all spring long in Rome?

"Han satt og snakket for Gunnulf om dette, og broren hørte på med et fjernt og rart smil om den lange og smale munn.

"Simon kjente på seg at mannen sa sant. Pinsler ville ikke kunne tvinge et ord ut av Erlend Nikulaussøn. Han, som kunne gjøre og røpe alt hva det skulle være, i hissighet og tankeløshet, ville aldri la seg rokke en håndsbredd ved vold. Og han følte at den skam og krenkelse som han kjente på en annen manns vegne, var Erlend neppe selv vár – han var oppfylt av en egensindig glede ved å trosse sine bødler og tilfreds trygghet for sin hardførhet. Han som alltid falt så ynkelig ned når han møtte en fast vilje, som selv saktens hadde kunnet være grum i et øyeblikks forferdelse, svingte opp nu da han i denne grumhet været en motstander som var svakere enn han selv.","Simon felt that the man was telling the truth. Brushes would not be able to force a word out of Erlend Nikulaussøn.

And he felt that the shame and insult he felt on behalf of another man was hardly Erlend himself - he was filled with an idiosyncratic joy in defying his executioners and contented confidence in his perseverance. He who always fell so pitifully when he met a firm will, which even could have been cruel in a moment of horror, swung up now that in this cruelty he had been an opponent who was weaker than himself.","Simon felt within himself that the man spoke the truth.

He who had always yielded so pitifully when confronted by a strong will, who might have shown cruelty himself in a moment of fear, now displayed his valor when he, in this cruel situation, sensed an opponent who was weaker than he was."
"Litt bortkommen og rådløs stod hun ved inngangen til koret da en ung prest kom ut av gitterdøren. Han stanset foran den forgråtte unge kvinne, og Kristin sa ham sitt ærend så godt hun kunne.

"Så ropte hun i sitt hjerte på Sankt Olav. Ham hadde hun hørt så meget om at det var som hun skulle ha kjent ham mens han levde i landet, og ha sett ham her på jorden. Ikke høy var han, førladen, men rank og fager, med gullkronen og skinnende gisel om det gyldne, krusede hår, rødt kruset skjegg om det faste, værbitte og djerve åsyn. Men hans dype og luende øyne så tvers igjennom alle mennesker, dem torde ingen se inn i som hadde misgjort. Hun torde det ikke, hun heller, hun så ned for hans blikk, men hun var ikke redd – det var mere som da hun var liten og måtte slå ned sine øyne for farens når hun hadde gjort galt. Sankt Olav så på henne, strengt, men ikke hårdt – hun hadde jo lovet å bedre sitt levnet. Hun lengtet så forferdelig efter å få komme inn til Nidaros og knele ned ved hans helligdom. Erlend hadde lovet henne det, da de reiste hit opp, at dit skulle de fare meget snart. Men ferden var blitt oppsatt. Og nu skjønte Kristin at han nødig ville reise med henne; han var skamfull og redd for folkesnakket.","Then she cried in her heart for Saint Olav. She had heard so much about him that it was as if she had known him while he lived in the land, and had seen him here on earth. He was not tall, pre-charged, but straight and handsome, with the golden crown and shiny hostage around the golden, frizzy hair, red frizzy beard around the firm, weather-beaten and bold face. But his deep and soothing eyes looked through all the people, no one dared look into them who had wronged. She did not dare, she either, she looked down at his gaze, but she was not afraid - it was more like when she was little and had to close her eyes to her father when she had done wrong. Saint Olav looked at her, sternly, but not harshly - she had promised to improve her life. She longed so terribly to enter Nidaros and kneel at his sanctuary. Erlend had promised her, when they traveled up here, that they would go there very soon. But the journey had been set up. And now Kristin realized that he was reluctant to travel with her; he was ashamed and afraid of the people.","One evening when she was sitting at the table with the house-folk, one of the women, a young maid that helped in the indoor work, had said:","Then she called in her heart upon Saint Olav.3 He was the one she had heard so much about that it was as though she had known him while he lived in Norway and had seen him here on this earth. He was not tall, quite stout, but straight-backed and fair, with the gold crown and shining halo on his golden curls, and a curly red beard on his firm, weatherbeaten, and intrepid face. But his deep-set and blazing eyes looked straight through everyone; those who had strayed did not dare look into them. Kristin didn’t dare either. She lowered her gaze before his eyes, but she was not afraid. It was more as if she were a child and had to lower her eyes before her father’s glance when she had done something wrong. Saint Olav looked at her, sternly but not harshly—she had promised to better her life, after all. She longed so fervently to go to Nidaros4 and kneel down before his shrine: Erlend had promised her this, when they came north—that they would go there very soon. But the journey had been postponed. And now Kristin realized that he was reluctant to travel with her; he was ashamed and afraid of gossip."
"Sira Eiliv hadde skikket henne et brev til, og hun hadde meldt Erlend hva som stod i det om deres sønner. Ellers nevnte de aldri sine barn. De talte ikke om fortid og ikke om fremtid nu mere.

No, Erlend now said—and he would allude to his father-in-law’s powerful kinsmen in Sweden—he knew full well how the Swedish noblemen regarded the Norwegians. “And if we don’t show them what we’re capable of, we’ll soon be considered nothing more than wards of the Swedes.”"
"Hun så at Orm skjønte det også. Og hun så at den unges sinn ble kløvet av kjærlighet til faren og stolthet over ham – og forakt for mannens urimelighet når Erlend lot sitt barn bøte for de bekymringer som han selv og ikke gutten hadde voldt, lå for hånden. Men Orm hadde sluttet seg til sin unge stemor – hos henne var det som han pustet ut og kjente seg friere til mote. Når han var alene med henne, kunne han både skjemte og le – på sin stille måte. Men dette likte ikke Erlend – det var som han mistenkte disse to for å sette seg til doms over hans adferd.","She saw that Orm understood that too. And she saw that the young man's mind was split by love for his father and pride in him - and contempt for the man's unreasonableness when Erlend let his child make amends for the worries he himself and not the boy had caused. But Orm had joined his young stepmother - with her it was as if he breathed a sigh of relief and felt freer to fashion. When he was alone with her, he could both mock and laugh - in his quiet way. But Erlend did not like this - it was as if he suspected these two of judging his behavior.","She saw that Orm understood it too. And she saw that the youth’s heart was torn between love of his father and pride in him — and scorn for the man ’s unreason when Erlend made his child suffer because troubles lay before them for which he and not the boy was to blame. But Orm had drawn close to his young stepmother — it was as though with her he breathed freely and felt lighter of mood. When he was alone with her, he would jest and laugh by times — in his still fashion. But Erlend liked not this — ’twas as though he misdoubted that these two might sit in judgment on his doings.","She saw that Orm realized this too. And she saw that the young boy’s soul was split: Orm felt love and pride for his father, but also contempt for Erlend ’s unfairness when he allowed his child to suffer because he was faced with worries which he himself, and not the boy, had caused. But Orm had grown close to his young stepmother; with her he seemed to breathe easier and feel freer. When he was alone with her, he was able to banter and laugh, in his own quiet way. But Erlend was not pleased by this; he seemed to suspect that the two of them were sitting in judgment of his conduct."
"«Nei, du kan skjønne vi hadde aktet deg til å bli det,» lo Erlend.","""No, you can see we intended you to be,"" Erlend laughed.","“Nay, surely you must know we had meant that place for you,” laughed Erlend.","“No, you should know that we intended that position for you,” laughed Erlend."

"«Sigurd –,» sa Erlend. «Å ja, nu minnes jeg jeg så ham i bryllupet vårt. Det var den sidnesede, tannløse gamlingen som siklet og gråt og klappet deg på brystet – han var skitfull enda om morgenen da folket kom opp til oss og så på at jeg satte på deg hustrulinet –.»","""Sigurd -,"" said Erlend.

"Erlend, Erlend –. Da hun møtte ham i ungdommen, ble livet for henne som en strid elv i løp over stubb og stener. Disse årene på Husaby hadde livet bredt seg ut, ligget vidt og rommelig som en sjø, speilende alt omkring henne.

Out in its midst showed little dark threatening eddies, where the current ran swift and wild and perilous under the shining surface.

"Siste kvelden før presten og guttene skulle fare – Simon var da reist med tvillingene – skriftet Kristin for den fromme og renhjertede mann som hadde vært hennes åndelige far i alle disse årene. De satt sammen i mange timer, og Sira Eiliv la henne på hjertet å være ydmyk og lydig mot Gud, tålmodig, trofast og kjærlig mot sin ektehusbond. Hun lå på kne ved benken der han satt; da stod Sira Eiliv opp, knelte ned ved hennes side, enda med den røde stola, tegnet på Kristi kjærlighets åk, og han bad lenge og brennende, uten ord. Men hun visste at han bad for den far og mor og de barn og hele den huslyd hvis sjelehelse han i alle disse årene så trofast hadde strevet for å fremme.","Last night before the priest and the boys were to leave - Simon had then left with the twins - Kristin wrote for the pious and pure-hearted man who had been her spiritual father all these years. They sat together for many hours, and Sira Eiliv put her heart to be humble and obedient to God, patient, faithful and loving to her husband. She knelt by the bench where he sat; then Sira Eiliv stood up, knelt down beside her, still with the red chair, drawn on the yoke of Christ's love, and he prayed long and burning, without words. But she knew that he prayed for the father and mother and the children and all the household noise whose mental health he had so faithfully strived to promote all these years.","The last night before the priest and the boys were to set forth — Simon had left already with the twins — Kristin made confession to the holy and pure-hearted man who had been her spiritual father all these years. They sat together many hours, and Sira Eiliv was instant with her to be humble and obedient towards God, and patient, faithful and loving towards her wedded husband. She knelt by the bench where he sat; then Sira Eiliv rose up and knelt by her side, still bearing the red stole, the token of the yoke of Christ’s love, and prayed long and fervently without words. But she knew that he prayed for the father and mother and the children and all the household, whose souls’ health he had so faithfully striven to further all these years.","On the last evening before the priest and the two boys were to depart—Simon had already left with the twins—Kristin made her confession to the pious and pure-hearted man who had been her spiritual father all these years.

She knelt before the bench where he sat.

But she knew he was praying for the father and mother and the children and all the servants whose salvation he had striven so faithfully to encourage all these years."
"Og så allikevel – da disse tidender kom i sommer og i høst om Erlends ferd nordpå. Da hadde han hatt en eneste lengsel – å være med broren. Erlend kongens landvernsmann i Hålogaland og han Guds ords forkynner i de øde, halvhedenske bygdene ved Gandvikshavet –.","And so anyway - when these tidings came this summer and autumn about Erlend's journey north. Then he had had only one longing - to be with his brother. Erlend the king's land guard in Hålogaland and he preaches the word of God in the desolate, half-pagan villages by the Gandvik Sea -.","Ah, but in that sweet spring his learning had seemed to him no more to be held in reverence than the learning every little maid gets from her mother — to spin and brew and bake and milk — the teaching every child needs that it may do its work in the world.","And yet, when the news arrived this past summer and autumn about Erlend’s actions in the north . . . Then he had yearned for only one thing: to be with his brother. Erlend, the king’s military protector in Haalogaland; and he, the preacher of God’s words in the desolate, half-heathen districts near the Gandvik Sea4 . . ."
"Nære frender hadde de ingen av, hverken Erlend eller hun – så stor slekt som de eide. Munan Bårdssøn gjaldt ikke stort nu mere. Han hadde fart frem med ulov da han hadde sysselen på Ringerike; han søkte altfor hissig å bringe sine mange barn frem i verden – fire hadde han i ekteskap og fem utenom. Og han skulle være falt svært meget av siden fru Katrin døde. Inge i Ryfylke, Julitta og hennes husbond, Ragnrid, som var gift inn til Sverige, kjente Erlend lite – dette var de barna som var efter herr Bård og fru Åshild. Mellom Hestnesfolket og Erlend hadde det ikke vært vennskap siden herr Bård Peterssøn døde; Tormod på Råsvold gikk i barndommen, og hans og fru Gunnas barn var døde og barnebarna umyndige.","They had no close relatives, neither Erlend nor she - as large a family as they owned. Munan Bårdssøn did not matter much anymore. He had advanced with illegality when he was busy in Ringerike; he sought too fiercely to bring his many children into the world - four he had in marriage and five out of wedlock. And he should have fallen off a lot since Mrs. Katrin died. Inge in Ryfylke, Julitta and her husband, Ragnrid, who was married to Sweden, knew Erlend little - these were the children who were after Mr. Bård and Mrs. Åshild. There had been no friendship between Hestnesfolket and Erlend since Mr. Bård Petersson died; Tormod on Råsvold went in childhood, and his and Mrs. Gunna's children were dead and the grandchildren underage.","Near kinsfolk they had none, either Erlend nor she — widespread as their kindred was. Munan Baardssön scarce counted any more. He stood condemned for unlawful dealings when he held the Wardenship of Ringerike; he sought too eagerly to get his many children on in the world — four he had had in wedlock and five outside it. And ’twas said he had fallen away much since Lady Katrin’s death. Inge of Ryfylke; Julitta and her husband; Ragnrid, who was married in Sweden, knew but little of Erlend — these were the other children left by Lady Aashild. Between the Hestnes folk and Erlend there had been no friendship since Sir Baard Peterssön died; Tormod of Raasvold was in his second childhood; his and Lady Gunna’s children were dead, and their grandchildren still in their nonage.","They had no close kinsmen, neither she nor Erlend—no matter how extensive their lineage might be. Munan Baardsøn no longer had great influence. He had been charged with unlawful deeds when he was sheriff of Ringerike; he was too eager in his attempts to further the position of his many children in the world—he had four from his marriage and five outside of it. And he had apparently declined greatly since Fru Katrin had died. Inge of Ry county, Julitta and her husband, Ragnrid who was married to a Swede—Erlend knew little of them. They were the remaining children of Herr Baard and Fru Aashild. There had never been friendship between Erlend and the Hestnes people since the death of Sir Baard Petersøn; Tormod of Raasvold had grown senile; and his children with Fru Gunna were all dead and his grandchildren underage."
"Så var han meget hjemmefra, og nu tok han ofte datteren, Margret, med seg. Møens oppfostring hadde alltid vært en kilde til uenighet mellom dem. Sagt noe om det hadde Kristin aldri, men Erlend visste nok hva hun – og andre folk – mente. Han hadde i alle måter holdt Margret som sitt ektefødte barn, og folk tok mot henne, når hun fulgte med faren og stemoren, som hun kunne vært det. I Ramborgs bryllup hadde hun vært en av brudeternene og båret gullkrans over sitt utslagne hår. Mange av kvinnene likte det dårlig, men Lavrans hadde snakket for dem, og Simon hadde også sagt at ingen måtte mæle imot det til Erlend, eller si noe om det til møen; ikke kunne det fagre barnet for at hun var så ulykkelig båret. Men Kristin skjønte at Erlend hadde den plan, han ville få Margret gift med en svenn av våpen, og at han trodde, med den stilling som han nu hadde, skulle det lykkes ham å få det drevet igjennom, enda møen var avlet i hor og vanskelig kunne settes i en helt trygg, urokkelig stilling. Dette kunne kanskje gått om folk hadde hatt noen riktig tro på at Erlend ville evne bevare og øke sin makt og rikdom. Men enda Erlend ble likt og hedret på et vis, så var det som ingen hadde full tillit til at velstanden på Husaby skulle holde. Så Kristin var redd for at sine planer med Margret ville han vanskelig få fremmet. Og enda hun ikke likte Margret svært meget, ynket hun møen og gruet for den dag da pikens overmot kanskje skulle bli knekket – hvis hun måtte nøye seg med et meget ringere gifte enn hennes far hadde lært henne til å vente, og ganske andre kår enn slike som han hadde oppfødt henne i.","Then he was very much away from home, and now he often took his daughter, Margret, with him. Møen's upbringing had always been a source of disagreement between them. Kristin had never said anything about it, but Erlend probably knew what she - and other people - meant. He had in every way held Margret as her illegitimate child, and people welcomed her, when she accompanied her father and stepmother, as she could have been. At Ramborg's wedding, she had been one of the bridesmaids and wore a golden wreath over her tousled hair. Many of the women disliked it, but Lavrans had spoken for them, and Simon had also said that no one should speak against it to Erlend, or say anything about it to the maiden; could not the beautiful child because she was so unhappily carried. But Kristin realized that Erlend had the plan, he wanted to get Margret married to a journeyman by arms, and that he thought, with the position he now had, he would succeed in getting it pushed through, even though the maiden was bred in adultery and could hardly be put in a completely safe, unshakable position. This might have happened if people had had any real belief that Erlend would be able to preserve and increase his power and wealth. But even though Erlend was liked and honored in a way, it was as if no one had full confidence that the prosperity at Husaby would last. So Kristin was afraid that his plans with Margret would be difficult for him to promote. And even though she did not like Margret very much, she pitied the maiden and dreaded the day when the girl's courage might be broken - if she had to settle for a much worse marriage than her father had taught her to wait, and quite different conditions than such as he had raised her in.","So he was much from home, and now he often took his daughter Margret with him. The maid’s upbringing had ever been one of the things that set them at odds. Kristin had never said aught of it, but Erlend knew well what she — and others — thought. He had dealt with Margret in all ways as she had been his true-born child, and folk made her welcome as though she were such when she went about with her father and stepmother. At Ramborg’s wedding she had been one of the bridesmaids, and had borne a golden garland on her flowing hair. Many of the women liked this but ill, but Lavrans had talked them round, and Simon, too, had said that none must say aught against it to Erlend or speak of it to the maid herself — ’twas not the fair child’s fault that she was so luckless in her birth. But Kristin saw that Erlend had planned to wed Margret to an esquire bearing arms, and that he believed, with the standing he now had, he would be able to bring this about, although the maid was begotten in adultery, and ’twould be a hard matter to win for her a safe, firm footing amongst good folk. It might, perchance, have been done if folk had felt any right faith that Erlend had it in him to keep up and increase the might and riches in his house. But though Erlend was liked and honoured after a fashion, ’twas as though no one had full faith that the fair fortunes of Husaby would endure. Thus Kristin feared he would be hard put to it to bring his plans for Margret to a good end. And though she liked not Margret overmuch, yet she pitied the maid, and dreaded the day when, maybe, her pride must be broken — if she must be content with a much humbler match than her father had taught her to look for, and quite another way of life than the one he had nurtured her in.","So Erlend spent much time away from home, and now he often took his daughter Margret along with him. The maiden’s upbringing had always been a source of disagreement between him and his wife. Kristin had never said a word about it, but Erlend knew quite well what she, and others, thought. He had treated Margret in all respects as his lawful child, and whenever she accompanied her father and stepmother everyone received her as if she were. At Ramborg’s wedding she had been one of the bridesmaids, wearing a golden wreath on her flowing hair. Many of the women didn’t approve, but Lavrans had persuaded them, and Simon had also said that no one should voice any objection to Erlend or say a word about it to the maiden. The lovely child was not to blame for her unfortunate birth. But Kristin knew that Erlend planned to marry Margret to a man of noble lineage. He thought that with his present position, he could succeed in arranging it, even though the maiden had been conceived in adultery and it would be difficult to gain for her a position that was firm and secure. It might have been possible if people had been convinced that Erlend was capable of preserving and increasing his power and wealth. But although he was well-liked and respected in many ways, no one truly believed that the prosperity at Husaby would last. So Kristin was afraid that it would be difficult for him to carry out his plans for Margret. Even though she was not particularly fond of Margret, Kristin felt sorry for the maiden and dreaded the day when the girl’s arrogant spirit might be broken—if she had to settle for a match that was much poorer than what her father had taught her to expect, and for circumstances that were quite different from what she had grown up with."
"Hun gikk nedover til husene. Utenfor stuedøren sprang Nåkkve og Bjørgulf og lokket på katten, som hadde berget seg fra dem opp på taket. Så tok guttene fatt igjen med den brukne dolken som de eide sammen, og gravde videre på hullet i forstuens jordgulv.","She went down to the houses. Outside the living room door, Nåkkve and Bjørgulf ran and lured the cat, which had escaped from them onto the roof. Then the boys grabbed the broken dagger they owned together, and dug on the hole in the ground floor of the hall.","She walked down to the houses. Before the door of the hall, Naakkve and Björgulf were running about, and trying to coax back the cat, which had fled from them up on to the roof. But in a moment they set to work again with the broken dagger they owned in common, digging deeper the hole they had made in the earthen floor of the outer room.","She walked down toward the buildings. Outside the main hall Naakkve and Bjørgulf were leaping around, trying to entice a cat down from the roof where it had taken refuge. Then the boys took up the broken dagger which belonged to both of them and went back to digging a hole in the earthen floor of the entryway."
"Han kom hjem til sin egen gård neste morgen i grålysningen, stod litt utenfor stuehusets stengte dør, frossen, dødstrett, hjertesyk og led. Dundre opp husfolket, gå inn og krype i seng til Kristin, som lå med barnet ved barmen – nei. Han hadde på seg nøkkelen til det østre bursloftet; der lå noe gods som han var ansvarlig for. Erlend låste seg inn, drog av støvlene og bar sammen noe vadmelsvev og tomsekker oppå halmen i sengestedet. Han tullet kappen om seg, krøp under sekkene og hadde hell til å sovne fra allting, uttrett og fortumlet som han var.","He came home to his own farm the next morning in the gray light, stood a little outside the farmhouse's closed door, frozen, dead tired, heartbroken and suffering. Thunder up the house people, go in and crawl into bed to Kristin, who was lying with the child by the bosom - no. He was wearing the key to the eastern attic; there was some goods for which he was responsible. Erlend locked himself in, took off his boots and carried some wadding and empty sacks on top of the straw in the bed. He wrapped his cloak around himself, crawled under the sacks and was lucky enough to fall asleep from everything, tired and dazed as he was.","He came home to his own house the next morning in the grey of dawn, and stood a little outside the locked door of the hall, frozen, dead-weary, heart-sore and sickened. Rouse the household with his knocking; go in and creep into bed beside Kristin lying with the child at her breast — no! He had on him the key of the eastern storehouse loft; there were some goods stored there that he was answerable for. He let himself in, pulled off his boots, and got together some webs of wadmal and some empty sacks and spread them on straw in the bedstead. He wrapped his cloak about him, crept under the sacks, and, tired out and harassed as he was, was able at last to forget everything in sleep.","He returned to his own residence at dawn the next morning, pausing for a moment outside the bolted door to the main building, frozen, dead tired, heartsick, and dejected. Should he pound on the door to wake the servants and then slip inside to crawl into bed next to Kristin, who lay there with the child at her breast? No. He had with him the key to the eastern storehouse loft; that’s where he kept some possessions that were in his charge. Erlend unlocked the door, pulled off his boots, and spread some homespun fabric and empty sacks on top of the straw in the bed. He wrapped his cape around him, crept under the sacks, and was fortunate enough to fall asleep and forget everything, exhausted and confused as he was."
"En dag var hun med sin far nede på Skjenne. Og hun hadde sett igjen den merkelige kostbarhet som de hadde der i gården.

It was a trace of the finest gold, huge and old-fashioned in shape, with strange ornaments.

"«Hadde hun vært mitt ekte barn – eller mor hennes en ugift kvinne – aldri skulle jeg gitt henne til en fremmed mann mens det er slik med henne; jeg kunne unt både henne og hennes ly og vern.

""","“Had she been my true-born child — or her mother an unwed woman — never would I have given her to a stranger while things are so with her; I could have sheltered and guarded both her and hers.

"Da tjenesten var til ende, gikk han ut av hoveddøren. Han så fru Sunniva og hennes terne et stykke nede i gaten – tenkte det var bedre han ikke fulgte henne, men gikk like hjem. I det samme kom en flokk islendinger fra byrdingen oppover gaten, de gikk og holdt i hverandre og ravet og syntes å ville stenge veien for de to kvinner. Erlend løp efter fruen. Straks sjøfolkene så en herre med sverd ved beltet komme imot seg, vek de til side og lot kvinnene få gangrom.","When the service was over, he walked out the front door. He saw Mrs. Sunniva and her sisters down the street - thinking it was better he did not follow her, but went straight home.

As soon as the sailors saw a gentleman with a sword by his belt coming towards him, they turned aside and let the women have a walk.","When the service was at an end, he went out at the great door. He saw Lady Sunniva and her maid a little way down the street, and thought he had best not go with her, but go home straightway. At that moment a band of Icelanders from the trader came up the street; they staggered along, holding on to each other, and seemed as they would block the two women’s passage. Erlend ran after the lady. As soon as the sailors saw a gentleman with a sword at his belt come toward them, they swerved aside and made room for the women to pass.","When the service came to an end, he left the church through the main door.

"Erling Vidkunssøn stod med foten oppe på benken, og hans sønn spente den forgylte spore omkring – det var som herr Erling søkte å holde sine tjenere mest mulig unna i dag.

"Kristin gikk bort til dem, stod med en hånd på sin manns skulder og så på leken. Erlend var meget mindre dyktig sjakkspiller enn værfaren, så han tapte oftest når de drog tavl om kveldene, men slikt bar han saktmodig og likesæl. Denne kvelden spilte han svært dårlig. Kristin stod og lastet ham for det – ikke meget blid og søt. Da sa Lavrans til slutt noe umildt:","Kristin walked over to them, stood with one hand on her husband's shoulder and watched the game. Erlend was a much less skilled chess player than the weather father, so he most often lost when they drew in the evenings, but he was meek and even-tempered. This evening he played very poorly. Kristin stood and charged him for it - not very gentle and sweet. Then Lavrans finally said something unkind:","Kristin went over to them and stood with a hand on her husband’s shoulder, watching the game. Erlend had much less skill as a chess-player than his father-in-law, and most often lost when they played in the evenings; but he took such things with careless good-humour. This evening he played yet worse than was his wont. Kristin chid him for it once or twice — not too mildly and sweetly. Then Lavrans said at last, somewhat testily:","Kristin went over to them and stood with one hand on her husband’s shoulder, watching the game. Erlend was a much less skilled chess player than his father-in-law, so he was most often the loser when they took out the board in the evening, but he bore this with gentle equanimity. This evening he was playing especially badly. Kristin stood there castigating him, and not in a particularly kind or sweet way. Finally Lavrans said rather harshly, “Erlend can’t keep his thoughts on the game when you’re standing here bothering him."
"Han hadde fått lære det var ikke så endeframt å leve i verden som han hadde trodd hjemme fra Dyfrin. Der rådet faren i ett og alt, og hans meninger var de rette. Nok hadde Simon vært ved hirden og vært kjertesvein en tid, han hadde fått noen lærdom hos farens husprest hjemme – det kunne nok hende at han fant ett og annet som faren sa, litt avleggs. Han mælte også imot av og til – men det var bare som skjemt, og det ble tatt som skjemt – svært til kvikt hode på Simon, lo faren og moren og hans søsken, som aldri mælte imot herr Andres. Men allting ble som faren sa; det fant også han selv rimelig.","He had been taught that living in the world was not as endless as he had thought at home from Dyfrin. There the father ruled in one and all, and his opinions were the right ones. Simon had probably been by the shepherd and been a groom for a while, he had learned some lessons from his father's house priest at home - it could probably be that he found something like his father said, a little off. He also spoke out from time to time - but it was only as a shame, and it was taken as a shame - very to the quick wit of Simon, his father and mother and his siblings laughed, who never spoke out against Mr. Andres. But everything was as his father said; he also found it reasonable.","He had been made to learn ’twas not such a plain straightforward thing to live in the world as he had deemed it when at home at Dyfrin. There his father had ruled all things, and his judgments were right. True, Simon had been with the body-guard and served as page for a time, and he had gained a little learning from his father’s house-priest at home — it might chance now and again that he deemed his father’s wisdom a little behind the time. He would venture to gainsay him too, now and then — but it was but as in jest, and it was taken as a jest — a quick-witted lad, Simon, laughed his father and mother, and so said his brothers and sisters, who would never gainsay Sir Andres. But all things were done as his father willed — Simon himself deemed this but reason.","He had learned that it was not as simple to live in this world as he had thought back home at Dyfrin. There his father ruled over everything, and his views were always right. Simon had been one of the king’s retainers, and he had served as a page for a while; he had also been taught by his father’s resident priest at home. At times he would find what his father said a bit old-fashioned. Occasionally he would voice his opposition, but it was only meant in jest, and it was taken as such. “What a quick wit Simon has,” laughed his father and mother and siblings, who never spoke against Sir Andres.

"Det var det som minorittene kvad efter completorium. Broder Edvin hadde lært henne denne hymne til Drottens mor da hun våket over ham de nettene han lå i helsott hjemme hos dem på Jørundgård.

"Ja, sa folk, det var noe i dette. Men så snakket de om drottseten igjen. Erlend hadde sitt eget å syte for der nord; karelerne hadde et år brent Bjarkøy over hodet på hans rådsmann og herjet hans landbønder. Og Erlend slo om og gjønte – Erling Vidkunssøn tenkte ikke på sitt eget, det var han viss på. Han var så edel og fin og staselig en ridder – de kunne da ikke fått gildere mann til å stå i brodden for hele stellet. Guds kors, Erling var så hederlig og ærverdig som den gjeveste gyldne kapittelstav foran i lovboken. Folk lo og festet seg mindre ved Erlends lovord over drottsetens rettskaffenhet enn ved det at Erlend hadde lignet ham med en forgylt bokstav.","Yes, people said, there was something in this. But then they talked about the queen seat again. Erlend had his own to shoot for up north; the karelians had burned Bjarkøy over the head of his councilor for a year and ravaged his farmers. And Erlend turned and laughed - Erling Vidkunsson did not think of his own, he was sure of that. He was so noble and fine and stately a knight - they could not then get a valid man to stand in the sting for the whole care. God's cross, Erling was as honorable and venerable as the most generous golden chapter in front of the book of the law. People laughed and clung less to Erlend's praise of the royal seat's righteousness than to the fact that Erlend had likened him to a gilded letter.","Aye, folk would say, there was somewhat in all this. But then they would talk again of the High Steward. Sir Erling had his own pot to boil in the north there; the Karelians had burned Bjarkö over his steward’s head one year, and harried his farmers. And then Erlend changed his note and grew merry over the knight: Erling Vidkunssön thought not on his own concerns, of that he was sure. He was so noble and fine and stately a knight — no more worshipful man could they have found to be the corner-stone of their affairs. By God’s Cross, Erling was as worshipful and as venerable as the bravest golden capital letter in the Book of the Laws. Folk laughed, and bore in mind not so much Erlend’s praise of the High Steward’s honour as that he had likened him to a gilded letter in a book.","And people agreed that there was some truth to this. But then they would go back to talking about the regent. Sir Erling had his own reasons for lamenting what went on in the north. One year the Karelians had burned down Bjarkøy in defiance of his overseer and persecuted his leaseholders. But Erlend would change his tone and jest—Erling Vidkunssøn wasn’t thinking of his own affairs, he was sure of that. Sir Erling was such a noble and refined and distinguished knight; they couldn’t have found a better man to serve as leader for all of them. By God, Erling was as honorable and venerable as the most beautiful golden initial capital at the beginning of the book of law. People laughed, less impressed with Erlend’s praise of the regent’s integrity than with Erlend’s comparing him to a gilded letter."
"«Men det gror lite med ask her nordenfjells,» sa gutten. «De har brukt den opp til spydstaker i gammel tid, vet du. Jeg vet ikke av at det gror annen ask på Husabys jord enn den som står her øst for gårdsgrinden, og den kan far ikke hugge, for der bor godbonden under –.

""They used it up to spearheads in ancient times, you know. I do not know that there is any other ash growing on Husaby's land than the one that stands here east of the farm gate, and father cannot cut it, because that is where the good farmer lives below -. You Kristin, they have the Holy Cross in Romaborg; then they may well find out if it is true that it is made of ore - »","“But there’s little ash grows here north of Dovre,” said the boy. “They used it up in the old times for spear-shafts, you know. I know not of one other ash on all the lands of Husaby but the one that stands by the eastern yard-gate, and that one father cannot cut, for the Brownie of the Yard dwells under it. — But, Kristin, I wot they have the Holy Rood itself at Romaborg; surely they can find out if ’tis true that it is made of alder-wood — ”","“But very few ash trees grow up north here,” said Orm. “They used them all up for spear poles in the olden days, you know. I don’t think there are any ash trees here on Husaby’s land other than the one standing east of the manor gate, and Father can’t chop that one down, because the spirit of the first owner lives underneath. 9 But you know, Kristin, they have the Holy Cross in Romaborg; so they must be able to find out whether it was made of alderwood.”"
"Å nei. Djevelen var nok ikke så viss på at han skulle miste hennes sjel –.

"Erlend hadde alltid vært slik at når han ble hissig, kunne han si de verste ting – men før hadde han aldri sagt et menneske onde ord uten i vrede, og han hadde vært snar til å gjøre det godt igjen når han selv ble god. Nu kunne han si hårde og stygge ting med kaldt åsyn. Han hadde vært den verste mann til å banne og sverge; dog hadde han i noe monn lagt av denne vonde vane fordi han så det gjorde hustruen vondt og krenket Sira Eiliv, som han efter hvert hadde fått stor aktelse for. Men aldri hadde han vært uhøvisk eller liderlig i munnen, og han hadde aldri likt seg når andre menn førte slik tale – på det vis hadde han vært meget blygere enn mangen mann som hadde levd et renere liv. Så sårt som det krenket Kristin å høre slikt i sine umyndige sønners munn, helst nu som hun selv gikk slik, og få vite at de hadde lært dette av faren, så var det enda ett som gav henne den bitreste smak i munnen: Hun skjønte at Erlend var enda barnaktig nok til å mene han satte hardt mot hardt når han nu efter skammen med datteren tok urene og sedesløse ord og talemåter i munnen.","Erlend had always been such that when he got angry, he could say the worst things - but before he had never said a person bad words without anger, and he had been quick to make amends when he himself became good. Now he could say hard and ugly things with a cold face. He had been the worst man to swear and swear; however, he had in some way put off this bad habit because he saw it hurt his wife and offended Sira Eiliv, for whom he had gradually gained great respect. But he had never been rude or horny in his mouth, and he had never liked himself when other men gave such speech - in that way he had been much more timid than many men who had lived a cleaner life. As much as it offended Kristin to hear this in the mouths of her underage sons, preferably now that she herself went like this, and to be told that they had learned this from her father, there was another thing that gave her the bitterest taste in her mouth: She understood that Erlend was still childish enough to think he was going hard against hard when he now, after shame with his daughter, took unclean and immoral words and sayings in his mouth.","Erlend had always been a man who could say the worst of things when he was enraged — but before this he had never given hard words to any save in wrath; and he had been quick to make all good when he himself was cool again. But now he could say hard and ugly things in cold blood. He had been a terrible man for cursing and swearing; yet had he, in some measure, left off this evil habit, because he saw it hurt his wife and gave offence to Sira Eiliv, for whom he had grown, little by little, to feel much respect. But never had he been foul-mouthed or unseemly in his talk — in that matter he had been much more modest than many a man who had led a purer life. Sorely as it hurt Kristin to hear such words on her young sons’ boyish lips, most of all in the state she was in, and to hear that they had learnt them of their father, there was yet another thing which left the bitterest taste of all in her mouth: she saw that Erlend was still childish enough to deem he could brave out the shame of his daughter’s fall by taking impure and unseemly words on his lips.","Erlend had always been the kind of man who could say the worst things when his temper was aroused, but in the past he had never said an unkind word to anyone except in anger, and he had been quick to make amends when his own good humor was restored. Nowadays he could say harsh and ugly things with a cold expression on his face. Before, he used to curse and swear fiercely, but to some extent he had put aside this bad habit when he saw that it bothered his wife and offended Sira Eiliv, for whom he had gradually developed great respect. But he had never been rude or spoken in a vulgar manner, and he had never approved when other men talked that way. In that sense, he was much more modest than many a man who had lived a purer life. As much as it offended Kristin to hear such a song on the lips of her innocent sons, especially in her present condition, and then to hear they had learned it from their father, there was something else that gave her an even more bitter taste in her mouth. She realized that Erlend was still childish enough to think that he could counter cruelty with cruelty since, after suffering the shame of his daughter, he had now begun to use foul words and speak in an offensive manner."
"Så så hun jordene hjemme ved Jørundgård en lys sommernatt – så seg selv løpe stien nedover til den grønne plassen inni olderskogen ved elven – der hvor de pleide tvette klær.

"Hun hadde truffet Haftor Graut igjen ved kongeveitslene i Nidaros, og han hang efter henne der òg, slik som han pleide. En kveld fikk han henne med seg inn på et loftsrom, og hun la seg ned med ham på en oppredd seng som stod der. Hjemme i Dalene kunne hun ikke tenkt seg å gjøre slikt – der var det ikke gjestebudsskikk at menn og kvinner stakk seg bort slik, to og to alene. Men her brukte alle det, ingen syntes å finne det usømmelig – det skulle nok være riddersed i utlandene. Det første de kom inn, lå fru Elin, herr Erlings frue, i den andre sengen med en svensk ridder; de snakket om kongens øreverk, hørte hun –.

"Han husket den morgenen hans egen mor var død om natten.

Men det gav ullen gjenlyd av den dumpe lyd da båten rodde til lands med presten. Han stod i forrommet og så dem ro bort fra skipet. Alt var vått av tåken, som han kom nær, væten perlet i hans hår og på hans klær, og den fremmede presten og hans følgesvenn satt fremme i båten og skrukket med opptrukne skuldre over karene de hadde i fanget. De lignet høker i regnvær. Åreslagene og gnikkingen i tollegangene og gjenlyden fra fjellet ble ved å lyde dovt lenge efter at båten var innkvervet i skodden.","He remembered the morning his own mother had died that night. They were at anchor inside Moldøysundet, but the shutter was white and so dense, there were only small moments in between, there was a glimpse of the rock wall they lay below. But it gave the wool echo of the dull sound as the boat rowed ashore with the priest. He stood in the anteroom and watched them calm away from the ship. Everything was wet from the fog, which he came near, the wet pearl in his hair and on his clothes, and the strange priest and his companion sat in front of the boat and wrinkled their shoulders over the men in their laps. They looked like hawks in the rain. The throbbing and the jerking in the toll tunnels and the echo from the mountain continued to sound dull long after the boat had been collected in the shutter.","Erlend remembered the morning after the night his own mother died. They lay at anchor inside Moldöy Sound, but the white fog was so thick that ’twas but in short moments now and then they caught a glimpse of the cliff-wall they lay close under. Yet did it give back a muffled echo of the hollow sounds as the boat rowed landwards with the priest. He stood in the fore-part and watched them row away from the ship. All things he came near were wet with the fog; the wet stood in beads on his hair and his clothes, and the stranger priest and his acolyte sat in the boat’s bow crouched with updrawn shoulders over the sacred elements in their lap. They looked like hawks in rainy weather. The oar-strokes and the creaking of the rowlocks and the echoes from the cliff sounded on faintly long after the boat was blotted out in the fog.","Erlend remembered the morning following his own mother’s death. They were anchored in Moldøy Sound, but the fog was so white and thick that only occasionally could they catch a glimpse of the mountain ridge towering above them. But there was a muffled echo from the hollow sound of the boat being rowed to shore with the priest. Erlend stood in the bow and watched them rowing away from the ship. Everything he came near was wet with fog; beads of moisture covered his hair and clothing. And the priest and his acolyte, who were strangers to Erlend, sat in the bow of the boat, their shoulders hunched as they bent over the holy vessels they held on their laps. They looked like hawks in the rain. The slap of the oars and the scrape of the oarlocks and the echo from the mountain continued to resound long after the boat had been spirited away by the fog."
"Lavrans stod med Kristin foran barnas seng og så henne legge de små skrotter til rette. De eldste var alt store gutter med magre kropper og slanke, tørre lemmer, men de to små var lubne og rosenhvite med legg i holdet og dokker i ledemotene. Et vakkert syn tyktes det ham å være der de lå røde og varme, fuktige av svette i det frodige hår, pustende stilt i søvne. Det var sunne, skjønne barn – men aldri hadde han sett så ille opptuktede unger som sine dattersønner. Godt var det enda at ikke Simons søster og brorkone hadde vært her i kveld. Men han skulle vel ikke snakke om barnetukt, han –. Lavrans sukket litt og gjorde korstegn over de små hoder.","Lavrans stood with Kristin in front of the children's bed and watched her prepare the small carcasses. The oldest were all big boys with lean bodies and slender, dry limbs, but the two little ones were chubby and rosy white with legs in the team and dolls in the joints. A beautiful sight seemed to him to be where they lay red and warm, moist with sweat in their lush hair, breathlessly put to sleep. They were healthy, beautiful children - but he had never seen such badly bred kids as his grandsons. It was good that Simon's sister and nephew had not been here tonight. But he should not talk about child discipline, he -. Lavrans sighed a little and made a sign of the cross over the small heads.","Lavrans stood with Kristin before the children’s bed, and watched her tucking the small bodies into their places. The eldest were big boys already, with thin bodies and slender bony limbs; but the two little ones were plump and rosy, with creases in their flesh and dimples at the joints. A fair sight they seemed to him, lying there red and warm, their thick-growing hair damp with sweat, breathing evenly in their sleep. They were healthy, comely children — but never had he seen young ones so ill brought up as these grandsons of his. ’ Twas well, indeed, that Simon’s sister and brother’s wife had not been there that night. But maybe ’twas not for him to talk about breaking in children — Lavrans sighed a little, and made the sign of the cross above the small heads.","Lavrans stood next to Kristin at the children’s bedside and watched her tucking in her small sons. The eldest were already big boys with lanky bodies and slender, lean limbs; but the two smallest ones were chubby and rosy, with folds in their skin and dimples at their joints. Lavrans thought it a lovely sight to see them lying there, pink and warm, their thick hair damp with sweat, breathing quietly as they slept. They were healthy, beautiful boys—but never had he seen such poorly behaved children as his grandsons. Luckily Simon’s sister and sister-in-law hadn’t been present tonight. But he wasn’t the one to speak to Kristin about discipline. Lavrans gave a small sigh and then made the sign of the cross over the small boys’ heads."
"JULEKVELDEN STRIREGNET DET OG BLÅSTE. Det var uråd å bruke sleder, og så måtte Kristin bli hjemme da Erlend og husfolket red til nattmessen i Birgsi kirke.","CHRISTMAS NIGHT STRETCHED IT AND BLOWED. It was inadvisable to use sleds, and then Kristin had to stay home when Erlend and the family rode to the night mass in Birgsi church.","ON Yule Eve it blew and rained in torrents. ’ Twas no fit weather for sleighing, so Kristin had to stay at home when Erlend and the house-folk rode off to midnight mass at Birgsi church.","ON CHRISTMAS EVE the rain poured down and the wind blew hard. It was impossible to use sleighs, and so Kristin had to stay home when Erlend and the servants rode off for the evening mass at Birgsi Church."
"Det var første gangen så langt tilbake som hun kunne minnes, at hun ikke var til kristmessen. Hun måtte ha vært ganske liten første gang foreldrene tok henne med. For hun kunne huske at hun var blitt puttet ned i en skinnhit som var lodden inni, og faren hadde tatt henne i armen. Det var en forferdelig kald natt, og de red gjennom en skog – tyribrannene lyste på snetunge graner. Hennes fars ansikt var purpurrødt i skinnet, og pelskanten om hans hette var kritthvit av rim. Innimellom bøyde han seg litt ned og bet henne i nesetippen – spurte om hun kjente det, og så ropte han leende bakover til moren at enda hadde ikke Kristin frosset av seg nesen. Det måtte ha vært mens de bodde på Skog enda – hun kunne vel ha vært tre vintre. Foreldrene var ganske unge folk den tiden. Nu husket hun sin mors røst hin natt – høy og glad og full av latter, når hun ropte fremover til mannen og spurte om barnet. Ja, moren hadde vært ung og frisk i målet –.","It was the first time as far back as she could remember that she was not at the Christmas Mass. She must have been quite small the first time her parents took her. For she could remember that she had been put down in a leather hit that was furry inside, and her father had taken her in his arms. It was a terribly cold night, and they rode through a forest - the tyri fires shone on snow-heavy spruces. Her father's face was purple in skin, and the fur trim around his hood was chalky white with rhyme. Occasionally he bent down a little and bit her on the tip of his nose - asked if she felt it, and then he shouted laughing back to his mother that Kristin had not yet frozen her nose. It must have been while they were still living in Skog - she could well have been three winters. The parents were quite young people at that time. Now she remembered her mother's voice that night - loud and happy and full of laughter, when she called out to the man and asked about the child. Yes, the mother had been young and healthy in the goal -.","It was the first time, as far back as she could remember, that she had not been at Christ’s Mass.

It was a night of fearful cold, and they rode through a forest — the light of the fir-root torches gleamed on snow-laden pines. Her father’s face was purple-red in the glare, and the furred rim of his hood was snowy-white with rime. Now and again he bent his head a little and bit the tip of her nose, asking her if she felt the bite; then called laughing over his shoulder to her mother that Kristin’s nose was not frozen off yet. It must have been while they still dwelt at Skog — belike when she was three winters old. In those days her father and mother were quite young folk.

It was a terribly cold night, and they were riding through a forest— the pine torches shone on fir trees heavy with snow. Her father’s face was dark red, and the fur border on his hood was chalk-white with frost. Now and then he would bend forward and nip the end of her nose and ask her whether she could feel it. Then, laughing, he would shout over his shoulder to her mother that Kristin’s nose hadn’t frozen off yet. That must have been while they were still living at Skog; she couldn’t have been more than three winters old. Her parents were quite young back then. Now she remembered her mother’s voice on that night—clear and happy and full of laughter—when she called out to her husband and asked about the child. Yes, her mother’s voice had been young and fresh."
"Men samtalen gikk trevent mens de drakk. Erlend satt i sine egne tanker, glad i øynene som alltid når han skulle ut til noe nytt, men adspredt når de andre talte. Lavrans nippet bare til vinen, og herr Erling var stille.","But the conversation went smoothly while they drank. Erlend sat in his own thoughts, happy in his eyes as always when he was going out to something new, but distracted when the others spoke.

"De gikk ute i tunet og snakket, han og datteren, den morgen han skulle ri nedover igjen. Det var tindrende sol i fjellet – myrene var røde alt og haugene gule som gull av småbjerken; ute på vidden glitret vann og mørknet igjen efter som skyggene av de store, blanke godværsskyer vandret over. De valt opp ustanselig og sank ned mellom fjerne skar og kløfter i alle grånuter og blå berg med skav av nysne og gamle fonner, som ringet inn synet vidt ute. De små, grågrønne kornåkrer som hørte til sålstuen, skilte så underlig i lét mot denne høstskinnende fjellverden.","They went out into the yard and talked, he and the daughter, the morning he was going to ride down again. There was twinkling sun in the mountains - the bogs were all red and the mounds yellow as gold from the small birch; out on the plateau, water glistened and darkened again as the shadows of the large, shiny clouds of good weather wandered over. They picked up incessantly and sank down between distant crevices and ravines in all the gray knots and blue mountains with chafing of fresh and old fountains, which rang in sight far and wide. The small, gray-green cornfields that belonged to the sole room, separated so strangely in light of this autumn-shining mountain world.","They walked up and down the courtyard in talk, he and his daughter, the morning he was to set forth down the Dale again. The hill country round them lay in sparkling sunshine — the mosses were red already, and the knolls yellow as gold with the birch copses; out on the upland wastes, tarns glittered and grew dark again, as the shadows of the great shining fair-weather clouds floated across them. They kept rolling up unceasingly, and sank down over the distant clefts and glens, amidst all the grey-stone peaks, and blue mountains with combs of new snow, and old snow-fields, that lay around as far as the eye could reach. The little grey-green patches of corn belonging to the rest-house stood out strangely against the autumn hues of this shining mountain world.","They went out into the courtyard to talk, he and his daughter, on the morning when he was to head back south. Sunlight sparkled over the mountains; the marshes were already crimson, and the slopes were yellow like gold from the alpine birches. Up on the plateau, lakes alternately glittered and then darkened as shadows from the big, glossy, fair-weather clouds passed overhead. They billowed up incessantly, and then sank down between distant clefts and gaps amid all the gray-domed mountains and blue peaks, with patches of new snow and old snowdrifts, which encircled the view far into the distance. The small grayish-green fields of grain belonging to the travelers’ hostel looked so strange in color against the brilliant autumn hues of the mountains."
Han la ansiktet ned på hennes fang og så tindrende opp i sin hustrus åsyn. Rød og glad bøyde Kristin hodet og prøvde å gjemme sitt smil og sine øyne for Erlend.,"He put his face down on her lap and looked twinkling up in his wife's face. Red and happy, Kristin bowed her head and tried to hide her smile and her eyes from Erlend.","He laid his head down on her lap and looked with shining eyes up in his wife’s face.

Gunnulf bøyde hodet. Det ulmet i hans gulbrune øyne.,Gunnulf bowed his head. It smoldered in his yellow-brown eyes.,Gunnulf bent his head. There was a glow in his yellow-brown eyes.,Gunnulf bowed his head. His amber eyes smoldered.
"Hun samlet sine sønner om sitt kne igjen som før i tiden og strevde for å bringe litt mere tukt og skikk i deres oppfostring. Hun følte at hun handlet efter sin fars ønske i dette, og det gav likesom litt fred i hennes sjel. Sira Eiliv var nu begynt å lære Nåkkve og Bjørgulf bokstaver og latinsk tungemål, og Kristin satt da ofte over i prestehuset når barna var der og skulle lære. Men de var ikke meget kunnskapsgriske læresveiner, og alle barna var ustyrlige og viltre så nær som Gaute, så han ble ved å være morens skjødebarn, som Erlend kalte det.","She gathered her sons around her knee again as before and struggled to bring a little more discipline and custom into their upbringing. She felt that she was acting according to her father's wishes in this, and it seemed to give a little peace in her soul.

Kristin var blitt glad fordi han sa dette. Ellers undret det henne ofte hvor mange ting Erlend syntes å ha glemt. Men så sa han:,"Kristin had been happy because he said this. Otherwise, she often wondered how many things Erlend seemed to have forgotten. But then he said:",Kristin was glad because he said this. For at other times she had often wondered to see how many things Erlend seemed to have forgotten. But now he said:,". . .” Kristin was pleased that he had told her this. Otherwise she often wondered about all the things that Erlend seemed to have forgotten. But then he said, “And yet I would not have believed it of you, Kristin, that you could walk around bearing such a secret rancor toward me, and still act so gentle and happy."
"«Har I det?» Lavrans så opp med det lille fine smilet. «Enda så tror jeg at I liker ham, I også!»","""Do you have it?"" Lavrans looked up with that nice little smile. ""Even so, I think you like him, too!""",“Have you cause?” Lavrans looked up with his faint smile. “And yet I trow that you like him too.”,“Do you?” Lavrans looked up with a little smile. “And yet I think that you too are fond of him!”
"«Det har jeg aldri tenkt på. Og ikke tror jeg at mine landseter har noen tjeneste å takke meg for.

And I do not think my country seats have any service to thank me for. Yet, as strange as it is, I think they like me.

"Gråten kom over ham igjen, og han tok Gaute tettere inn til seg.

Umulig kunne Orm ha visst hvor hans far elsket ham.

"Han syntes han ble lønnet da hun gråt ut i hans armer, takknemlig og angerfull over sin uvennlighet mot ham i vinter. Erlend ble myk og øm som alltid når han hadde voldt en kvinne sorg og var nødt til å se henne sørge den ut for sine øyne. Så bar han tålelig vel Kristins påfunn. Han hadde sagt straks, barna ville han ikke ha med. Men moren talte om at Nåkkve var dog så gammel nu, han kunne ha gavn av å se sin morfars hedenfart. Erlend sa nei. Så syntes hun at Ivar og Skule var for små til å være igjen i tjenestekonenes varetekt. Nei, sa faren. Og Gaute hadde Lavrans vært så glad i. Nei, sa Erlend – det var vanskelig nok slik som det stod til med henne – for Ragnfrid å få en barnkone i gården mens hun hadde sin husbond på sottesengen – og for dem med den nyfødte hjemover. Enten måtte hun sette barnet til oppfostring på en av Lavrans’ gårder, eller måtte hun bie på Jørundgård til det ble sommer – men da måtte han reise hjem i forveien. Han holdt det frem for henne, opp og opp igjen, men han strevde for å tale rolig og inntrengende.","He thought he was rewarded when she cried out in his arms, grateful and remorseful for her unkindness to him this winter. Erlend became soft and tender as always when he had caused a woman grief and had to watch her mourn it before his eyes. Then he tolerated Kristin's inventions. He had said immediately, he did not want the children with him. But the mother said that Nåkkve was so old now, he could benefit from seeing his grandfather's heathland. Erlend sa nei. Then she thought that Ivar and Skule were too young to be left in the custody of the maids. No, so far. And Gaute Lavrans had been so fond of. No, Erlend said - it was difficult enough as it was with her - for Ragnfrid to have a nanny in the yard while she had her husband on the cot - and for them with the newborn home. Either she had to raise the child on one of Lavrans' farms, or she had to wait at Jørundgård until it was summer - but then he had to go home in advance. He held it out to her, up and up again, but he struggled to speak calmly and insistently.","It seemed to him he was well repaid when she threw herself weeping in his arms, full of thankfulness, and of penitence for her unfriendliness towards him in the winter. Erlend grew soft and tender, as he ever was when he had brought grief to a woman and had to see her sorrow it out before his eyes; and he bore well enough afterward with Kristin’s fantasies. He had said from the first, the children he would not have with them. But the mother would have it that Naakkve was so great a boy now, ’twould be well for him to see his grandfather’s going hence. Erlend said: No. Then she was sure that Ivar and Skule were too small to be left behind in the serving-women’s charge. No, said their father. And then Lavrans had been so fond of Gaute. No, said Erlend — ’twas hard enough as it was — things being as they were with her — for Ragnfrid to have a childbirth in the house, while her husband lay on his sick-bed — and for themselves on the journey homeward with a new-born babe. Either must she give the child out to nurse on one of Lavrans’ farms, or she must tarry at Jörundgaard till ’twas summer — but then he must come home before her. He had to put all this to her, over and over again; but he strove to speak calmly and reasonably.","He felt rewarded as she wept in his arms, grateful and full of remorse for her unkindness toward him that winter. Erlend grew gentle and tender, as he always did whenever he had caused a woman sorrow and then was forced to see her struggle with her grief before his eyes. And he gave in to Kristin’s proposal with reasonable patience. He said at once that he wouldn’t take the children along. But Kristin replied that Naakkve was old enough now, and it would be good for him to witness his grandfather’s passing. Erlend said no. Then she thought that Ivar and Skule were too young to be left in the care of the servant women. No, said Erlend. And Lavrans had grown so fond of Gaute. No, said Erlend again. It would be difficult enough, as things now stood with her—for Ragnfrid to have a nursemaid on the estate while she was tending to her husband on his sickbed, and for them to bring the newborn home again. Either Kristin would have to leave the child with foster parents on one of Lavrans’s farms, or she would have to stay at Jørundgaard until summer; but he would have to travel home before then. He went over all the plans, again and again, but he tried to make his voice calm and convincing."
"Den første morgen, da Margygren skar ut av Godøysundet med seilet bugnende mot blå fjell i den fine bris, stod Erlend oppe på viden bak i skipet. Ulv Haldorssøn hadde roret. Da kom Sunniva dit opp. Hun hadde kåpehetten nedfelt, og vinden strøk hodelinet bakover fra hennes solskinnsgule, krusede hår. Hun hadde samme slags sjøblå, glitrende øyne som broren, og som han var hun ansiktsfager, men sterkt fregnet, også på de små, fyldige hender.","The first morning, when Margygren cut out of Godøysundet with the sail abounding against blue mountains in the nice breeze, Erlend stood up on the wide back of the ship. Wolf Haldorssøn had the helm. Then Sunniva got up there. She had her coat cap down, and the wind was stroking her headline back from her sunny yellow, frizzy hair. She had the same kind of sea-blue, sparkling eyes as her brother, and like him she was fair-faced, but strongly freckled, even on the small, full hands.","The first morning, when Margygren stood out of Godöy Sound, her sail bellying against the background of blue mountains in the fine breeze, Erlend stood on the after-deck and Ulf Haldorssön was at the helm. Lady Sunniva came up on deck. She had thrown back the hood of her cloak, and the wind blew the linen of her coif backwards, uncovering her curly sun-bright yellow hair. She had the same sea-blue glittering eyes as her brother, and, like him, she was fair of face, but thickly freckled, both on her face and her small plump hands.","On the first morning, as Margygren cut through the waters of Godøy Sound with its sails billowing against the blue mountains in the fine breeze, Erlend was standing on the raised afterdeck of the ship. Ulf Haldorssøn had the helm. Then Fru Sunniva came up to them. The hood of her cloak was draped over her shoulders, and the wind was blowing her wimple back from her curly, sun-yellow hair. She had the same sea-blue, gleaming eyes as her brother, and like him she had a fair complexion, but with many freckles, which also covered her small, plump hands."
"Faren ristet det skrikende barn, gav ham noen slag i enden – og da gutten skrek enda verre, hysset han på ham så hardt at Gaute forferdet bråtagnet. Slikt var ikke overgått ham før i hans liv –.","The father shook the screaming child, gave him a few blows at the end - and when the boy screamed even worse, he hugged him so hard that Gaute was terrified. Such had not happened to him before in his life -.","The father shook the screaming child, gave him some slaps behind — and as the boy shrieked still louder bade him hush in such a harsh voice that Gaute suddenly stopped in terror. No such thing had ever befallen him before in his life.…","The father shook the crying child, gave him a few slaps on the bottom—and when the boy shrieked even louder, he hushed him so harshly that Gaute fell silent with fear. Nothing like that had ever happened to him before."

"Lavrans svarte ikke. Litt efter sa han, som mot sin vilje, sakte og redd:","Lavrans did not answer. Shortly afterwards he said, as if against his will, slowly and fearfully:","Lavrans made no answer. In a little he said softly, as though against his will and in fear:","Lavrans didn’t reply.

"Sist hun knelte her i denne kirken, da hadde hun fullelig skjønt at den gang hun sa slik i sitt hjerte, da søkte hun bare å narre Gud med løgn og pretter. Ikke deres dyd, men deres gode lykke var skyld i at der fantes bud som de ikke hadde brutt, synder som de ikke hadde øvet. Hadde hun vært en annens hustru da hun møtte Erlend – ikke ville hun ha vært ømmere for hans sjelehelse og hans ære, hun enn den andre, som hun så nådeløst hadde dømt. Intet var der, syntes hun nu, som hun ikke den gang hadde kunnet la seg friste til, i villsinn og fortvilelse. Hun hadde følt elskoven herde sin vilje til den ble hvass og hard som en kniv – rede til å skjære gjennom alle bånd, frendskapets, kristendommens, ærens. Det hadde ikke vært annet i henne enn den brennende sult efter å se ham, være nær ham, åpne sine lepper for hans hete munn og sin favn for den dødelig søte lyst han hadde lært henne –.","The last time she knelt here in this church, she had fully realized that the time she said that in her heart, she was only seeking to deceive God with lies and pranks. Not their virtue, but their good fortune was due to the fact that there were commandments that they had not broken, sins that they had not practiced. Had she been someone else's wife when she met Erlend - she would not have been more tender for his mental health and his honor, she than the other, whom she had so mercilessly judged. Nothing was there, she thought now, which she had not then been able to be tempted to do, in wildness and despair. She had felt the love forest harden its will until it became sharp and hard as a knife - ready to cut through all ties, friendship, Christianity, honor. There had been nothing in her but the burning hunger to see him, to be near him, to open his lips to his hot mouth and his arms to the deadly sweet lust he had taught her.","Sira Eiliv at home reproved her, that she took her everyday sins so hardly — he said ’twas the lure of spiritual pride: let her but be diligent in prayer and good works, and she would have no time to brood so much over such things. “The devil is no such fool as not to see then that your soul must needs escape him at last, and he will no longer care to tempt you so much — ”","The last time she knelt here in this church she had fully realized that when she said such things in her heart she had been trying to deceive God with tricks and lies. It was not because of their virtue but because of their good fortune that there were still commandments they had not broken, sins they had not committed. If she had been another man’s wife when she met Erlend . . . she would not have been any more sparing of his salvation or his honor than she was of the man she had so mercilessly spurned. It seemed to her now that there was nothing that wouldn’t have tempted her back then, in her ardor and despair. She had felt her passion temper her will until it was sharp and hard like a knife, ready to cut through all bonds—those of kinship, Christianity, and honor. There was nothing inside her except the burning hunger to see him, to be near him, to open her lips to his hot mouth and her arms to the deadly sweet desire which he had taught her."
"Jeg grunnet over dette til jeg syntes at mitt hjerte og min hjerne måtte briste. Men til slutt kom det lys til meg som jeg hadde bedt og tigget om. Og jeg skjønte at som disse hadde lidd, slik burde vi alle ha mot til å lide. Hvem ville være så tåpelig at han ikke gjerne tar pinsler og møye når dette var veien til en trofast og standhaftig brudgom som bier med åpen favn og brystet blodig og brennende av elskov.","I pondered this until I felt that my heart and my brain had to burst. But in the end, light came to me that I had asked and begged for. And I realized that as these had suffered, so we should all have the courage to suffer.

"Først var Kristin litt sky for denne mågen sin som var utlært i så mange vitenskaper ved de store skolene i Paris og i Valland. Men litt efter litt glemte hun sin forlegenhet.

Men da hun hadde sanset seg litt, så hadde han berettet så meget at Kristin syntes hun hadde aldri før skjønt hvor stor en verden der var utenfor Norge.

Nu er det slik at Arne Gjavvaldssøn er for gammel og sykelig – så har det vært på tale å sette deg til høvding over bondeskipene på denne side av fjorden. Hvordan ville du like det –»","""There's one thing, Erlend, that I meant to tell you. Leadership of the land around the fjord here and from Møre will certainly be offered - people are afraid in the north that the Russians will come back stronger this summer, so they will not be able to defend the land alone. It is now the first win we can thank the royal team with Sweden for - it is not fair that the hollow eyes should enjoy it alone. Now it is the case that Arne Gjavvaldssøn is too old and sickly - then there has been talk of putting you in charge of the peasant ships on this side of the fjord. How would you like that - »","“There is a matter, Erlend, that I had a mind to speak of with you. ’ Tis sure that a levy of ships will be called out from the lands around the fjord here and from Möre — folks in the north dread that the Russians will come again in strength in the summer and that without help they will not be strong enough to guard the land. This Russian feud is the first profit we have drawn from our sharing a King with Sweden — ’twould not be just that the Haaloga-landers should be left to enjoy it all alone. Now, it so falls out that Arne Gjavvaldssön is too old and sickly — and there has been talk of naming you as chief of all the ships from this side of the fjord. How would that like you — ?”","Sir Erling and Lavrans exchanged occasional glances, and then the former said, “There is something, Erlend, that I meant to discuss with you. A campaign force will certainly be summoned from the countryside here around the fjord and from Møre. People to the north are afraid that the Russians will return this summer, stronger than before, and they won’t be able to handle their defense alone. This is the first benefit for which we can thank the royal union with Sweden—but it wouldn’t be right for the people of Haalogaland8 to profit from it alone. Now, things are such that Arne Gjavvaldssøn is too old and sickly—so there has been talk of making you chieftain of the farmers’ ships from this side of the fjord. What would you think of that?”"
"«Det er sånn bred og åpen bygd,» sa Kristin om litt. «En ser så vidt fra Husaby, og himmelen er så – så vid. Der jeg er fra, ligger den som et tak like over fjellsidene. Dalen ligger så rund og grønn og frisk nede i ly. Verden blir så passelig – ikke for stor og ikke for trang.» Hun sukket og rørte hendene i fanget sitt.","""It's such a wide and open village,"" Kristin said a little. «One sees so far from Husaby, and the sky is so - so wide. Where I'm from, it's like a roof just over the mountainside. The valley is so round and green and fresh down in the shelter. The world is becoming so adaptable - not too big and not too cramped. "" She sighed and touched her hands in her lap.","“ ’Tis such a wide, open country-side,” said Kristin in a little. “One sees so far around from Husaby — and the heaven is so — so wide. Where I am from, it lies like a roof right down upon the hill-tops. The Dale lies low in shelter, so hollow and green and fresh. The world is of so fit a size — not too great and not too narrow.” She sighed and moved her hands in her lap.","“It’s such an open, wide landscape,” said Kristin after a moment. “You can see so far from Husaby, and the sky is so . . . so vast. Where I come from, the sky is like a roof above the mountain slopes. The valley lies sheltered, round and green and fresh. The world seems just the right size—neither too big nor too small.” She sighed and her hands began fidgeting in her lap."
"De brukte det på Husaby at efter kveldsmåltidet gikk tjenestefolkene til de husene hvor de sov. Så satt hun og Erlend alene i hallen. I det hele var skikkene her på gården mere som i gamle dager, den gang folk hadde treller og trellkvinner til husgjerningen. Det var ikke gulvfast bord i hallen, men morgen og kveld ble der dekket på et stort bord som ble lagt over bukker, og efter måltidet ble det hengt opp på veggen. Til de andre målene tok folk sin mat bort i benkene, satt der og åt. Kristin visste at slik hadde skikken vært før i tiden. Men nu om dagene, da folk vanskelig kunne få menn til å tjene for bordene og alle måtte nøye seg med terner til arbeidet innom hus, passet det ikke – kvinnene ville ikke slite seg helseløse med å løfte de tunge bordene. Kristin husket at hennes mor hadde fortalt, på Sundbu fikk de fast bord i stuen da hun var åtte vintre gammel, og det tyktes kvinnene en storvinning i alle måter – nu trengte de ikke gå ut i skjemmen med alt syarbeid, men kunne sitte i stuen og skjære og klippe, og det så så staselig ut å ha kjertestikker og noen vakre bordkar stående fremme alltid. Kristin tenkte, til sommeren ville hun be Erlend om å få et bord ved den nordre langveggen.","They used it at Husaby that after the evening meal the servants went to the houses where they slept. Then she and Erlend sat alone in the hall. On the whole, the customs here on the farm were more like in the old days, when people had slaves and slave women for housework. There was no floor-fixed table in the hall, but morning and evening it was covered on a large table that was laid over bucks, and after the meal it was hung on the wall. For the other meals, people took their food off the benches, sat there and ate. Kristin knew that this was the custom in the past. But nowadays, when people could hardly get men to serve for the tables and everyone had to make do with terns for the work in the house, it did not fit - the women did not want to struggle unhealthily to lift the heavy tables. Kristin remembered that her mother had told, at Sundbu they got a fixed table in the living room when she was eight winters old, and the women thought it a big win in every way - now they did not have to go out into the shadows with all the sewing work, but could sit in the living room and cut and cut, and it looked so stately to have candlesticks and some beautiful tableware always standing in front. Kristin thought, until the summer she would ask Erlend to get a table by the north long wall.","It was the custom at Husaby that after the evening meal the serving-folk went off to the houses where they slept; so that she and Erlend were left alone in the hall. Altogether the ways of this manor were more as they had been in the ancient days, when folks kept thralls and bondswomen for the household work. There was no fixed table in the hall, but morning and evening the meals were spread on a great board that was laid on trestles, and after the meal it was hung up again on the wall. At the other meals folks took their food over to the benches and sat and ate it there. Kristin knew such had been the custom in former times. But nowadays, when ’twas hard to find men to serve at table, and all folks had to content them with maids for indoor work, it fitted the times no longer — the women were loath to break their backs lifting the heavy tables. Kristin remembered her mother telling how at Sundbu they had put a fixed table into the hall when she was but eight winters old, and that the women thought it in every way the greatest boon — they need no longer take all their sewing out to the women’s house, but could sit in the hall and clip and cut out — and it made such a goodly show to have candlesticks and a few costly vessels standing out in view. Kristin thought: next summer she would pray Erlend to have a fixed table set up along the northern wall.","It was the custom at Husaby that after the evening meal the servants would retire to the buildings where they slept. Then she and Erlend would sit alone in the hall. In general the customs here on the manor were more as they had been in the old days, back when people had thralls to do the housework. There was no permanent table in the hall, but each morning and evening a large plank was placed on trestles and then set with dishes, and after the meal it was hung back up on the wall. For the other meals everyone took their food over to the benches and sat there to eat. Kristin knew that this had been the custom in the past. But nowadays, when it was hard to find men to serve at the table and everyone had to be content with maids to do the work indoors, it was no longer practical—the women didn’t want to waste their strength by lifting the heavy tables. Kristin remembered her mother telling her that at Sundbu they had a permanent table when she was eight winters old, and the women thought this a great advantage in every way. Then they no longer had to go out to the women’s house with their sewing but could sit in the main room and cut and clip, and it looked so fine to have candlesticks and a few lovely vessels always standing there. Kristin thought that in the summer she would ask Erlend to put a table along the north wall."
"«Jeg mente ikke det, jeg mente –. Gud styrke deg, Kristin, at du må evne dette, bære din husbonds feil med kjærlig sinn –»","""I did not mean what I meant -.

I meant . . . May God give you strength, Kristin, that you may have the will to do this, to bear your husband’s faults with a loving spirit.”"
"«Det gjør vel det.» Simon og hans værmor vekslet et blikk og et ganske lite smil. Nå, tenkte Kristin – ja, det var jo snart to måneder siden bryllupet –.","""I guess it does."" Simon and his weather mother exchanged a look and a rather small smile. Well, Kristin thought - yes, it was almost two months since the wedding -.","Simon and his mother-in-law exchanged a glance and the slightest of smiles. Ah, thought Kristin — aye, ’twas nigh on two months from the wedding now.…","Simon and his mother-in-law exchanged a look and a little smile. Ah, thought Kristin. Well, it had already been two months since the wedding."
«Lengter du noen tid efter disse barna dine?»,"""Do you long for these children of yours?""",“These children of yours — you miss them sometimes?”,"Some time later Kristin asked, “Do you ever long for these children of yours?”"
"I sommerens løp hadde det imens hendt at Haftor Olavssøn av Godøy hadde drept seg med den lille dolken som hver fange hadde fått beholde til å skjære sin mat med. Innesperringen skulle nok ha tatt slik på Haftor så han hadde ikke hatt sin forstands fulle bruk. Erlend sa til Simon, da han hørte det, at så trengte han ikke å engste seg for Haftors munn. Men han var dog meget rystet.","During the summer, it had meanwhile happened that Haftor Olavsson of Godøy had killed himself with the small dagger with which each prisoner had been allowed to cut his food. The confinement should probably have taken such a toll on Haftor so he had not had the full use of his mind. Erlend told Simon, when he heard it, that he did not have to worry about Haftor's mouth. However, he was very shaken.","Some time before this, in the summer, Haftor Olavssön of Godöy had slain himself with the little knife that each prisoner had been allowed to keep to cut his food with. Folk said that prison had so told on Haftor that he had not been in his right mind. Erlend said to Simon, when he heard of it, that now he need have no fear of Haftor’s tongue. But yet he was much moved.","In the meantime, during the summer, Haftor Olavssøn of Godøy had killed himself, using the little dagger that every prisoner was allowed to keep to cut up his food.

When Erlend heard of this, he told Simon that at least now he wouldn’t have to worry about what Haftor might say. And yet he was clearly shaken."

I will ride down to Raasvold myself, and I’ll send men to the other farms. You must stay with Kristin.”"
"Sist i helgen kom herr Munan til henne – han hadde først nu spurt at hun var i kaupangen, sa han. Han hilste hjertelig på henne, på Simon Andressøn og på Ulv, som han alt i ett kalte sin frende og kjære venn. Det torde bli vanskelig for dem å få se Erlend, mente han, de voktet strengt på ham – ham hadde det ikke lykkes å få inngang hos systrungen sin. Men Ulv sa leende, da ridderen var ridd bort, at han trodde ikke at Munan hadde trengt så hardt på heller – han var så livende redd for å bli innblandet i saken, så han torde mest ikke høre den nevnt. Munan var blitt svært gammel, meget skallet og avmagret, belgen hang aldeles slunken om den digre skrotten. Han satt ute på Skogheim og hadde en av frilledøtrene sine som var enke, hos seg. Faren ville gjerne være kvitt henne, for ingen av de andre barna hans, hverken ekte eller uekte, ville komme nær ham når denne halvsøsteren skulle styre huset; hun var en herskesyk, pengegrisk og skarptunget kvinne. Men Munan torde ikke be henne reise.","Last weekend, Mr. Munan came to her - he had only now asked that she was in the market, he said. He greeted her warmly, to Simon Andressøn and to Ulv, whom he all at once called his cousin and dear friend. It must be difficult for them to see Erlend, he thought, they kept a close eye on him - he had not succeeded in getting an entrance with his sister. But Ulv said with a laugh, when the knight had been ridden away, that he did not think that Munan had pushed so hard either - he was so terrified of being involved in the case, so he mostly dared not hear it mentioned. Munan had become very old, very bald and emaciated, the bellows hung completely slender around the huge carcass. He sat out at Skogheim and had one of his widowed daughters with him with him. The father wanted to get rid of her, for none of his other children, neither real nor ill, would come near him when this half-sister was to run the house; she was a domineering, greedy and sharp-tongued woman. But Munan did not dare ask her to leave.","Toward the end of the holy-days, Sir Munan came to her — he had only now heard she was in the city, he said. He greeted her heartily, likewise Simon Andressön and Ulf, whom he spoke to at every second word as “kinsman” and “dear friend.” It might be hard for them to gain sight of Erlend, he said; he was most strictly guarded — he had not been able to win in to see his cousin. But Ulf said, with a laugh, when the knight was gone, that he deemed not Munan had pressed so exceeding hard to gain entrance — he was in such deadly fear of being tangled in the affair that he could scarcely bear to hear it named. Munan had grown exceeding old, exceeding bald, and wasted in flesh; the skin hung loose on his bulky frame. He dwelt out at Skogheim, and had with him one of his base-born daughters who was a widow. The father would gladly have beeen quit of her, for none of his other children, neither those born in wedlock nor the others, would come near him so long as this half-sister ruled his house; she was an overbearing, greedy and shrewish woman. But Munan dared not bid her begone.","At the end of the holy days, Sir Munan came to see Kristin. He said he had just learned that she was in Oslo. He greeted her heartily, as he did Simon Andressøn and Ulf, whom he kept calling his kinsman and dear friend. He thought it would be difficult for them to win permission to see Erlend; he was being kept under tight guard. Munan himself had not succeeded in gaining access to his cousin. But after the knight had ridden off, Ulf said with a laugh that he thought Munan probably hadn’t tried very hard—he was so deathly afraid of being mixed up in the case that he hardly dared hear mention of it. Munan had aged greatly; he was quite bald and gaunt, and his skin hung loosely on his large frame. He was living out at Skogheim, with one of his unlawful daughters, who was a widow. Munan would have liked to be rid of her because none of his other children, lawful or unlawful, would come near him as long as this half-sister was managing his household. She was a domineering, avaricious, and sharp-tongued woman. But Munan didn’t dare ask her to leave."
"«Det har jeg gjort så lenge jeg har vært gift mann, herre. Det ble jeg tidlig – min hustru var sykelig og tålte lite ferdes mellom folk. Og det ser ut som ætten vår vil ikke trives her i Norge.

"«Ja, hun hadde da god grunn til det,» sa faren litt spotsk. «Men at hun ingenting sa til deg – du som er mor hennes –»","""Yes, she had a good reason for that,"" said her father a little mockingly.

"Det ble bedre når hun hadde fått dette nye barnet, tenkte hun – hun lengtet så forferdelig efter det; det var som det skulle berge henne.

If it were a son, and her father died before its birth, it should bear his name.

Himmelen spente lysegul syd over fjellenes blånende snefonner den kvelden Erlend suste ned forbi kirketomten så skaren skrek og hvinte.

Det ble på langfingeren over vigselsringen.,"Then Lavran's finger gold with the blue and white stone of his right hand went and went to his wife. Shy and embarrassed, he took her hand and stepped on the ring - had to move it a few times before he found the finger it looked after. It was on the middle finger over the wedding ring.","Then Lavrans took the gold ring with the blue and white stone from off his right hand, and went across with it to his wife. Shyly and awkwardly he took her hand and slipped the ring on to it — he had to change it once or twice before he found the finger it fitted. It came to rest on the middle finger, above her wedding-ring.","Finally Lavrans took off the gold ring with the blue-and-white stone from his right hand and went over to his wife. Shy and embarrassed, he took her hand and put on the ring; he had to try several times before he found a finger it would fit. He put it on her middle finger, in front of her wedding ring."
"«Uvørent har vi to stelt oss, Sunniva – det er visst urådelig at jeg blir her i natt. Bård må da vel være ventendes hjem en gang?» sa han.","""We have two carelessly taken care of ourselves, Sunniva - it is certainly inadvisable that I stay here tonight. Bård must be the waitress' home one day, right? » he said.","“Foolhardy is it, this that we have done, Sunniva — I trow it were not well that I should stay here to-night. Thorolf must be looked for home ere long?” he said.","“We’ve both been reckless, Sunniva—I don’t think it advisable that I stay here tonight. Surely Baard must be expected home sometime?” he said."

Then Orm can travel home by ship,” her husband said. “I suppose you would prefer not to travel across the fjord.”"
"– Ja, de hadde hatt hardt vær over Hustadviken i natt, han hadde vært oppe –.","- Yes, they had had bad weather over Hustadviken last night, he had been up -.","Aye, they had had heavy weather crossing Husastadviken the night before; he had been up —","Yes, they had encountered stormy weather near Husastadvik the night before; he hadn’t gotten any sleep."
"Bård fór opp og drev et krus i synet på den andre. Mennene tørnet sammen så bordplaten veltet halvveis over, og mat og kjørel drev i fanget til dem som satt på ytterbenken.","Bård went up and ran a mug at the sight of the other. The men turned together so that the table top overturned halfway over, and food and carts drifted in the lap of those who sat on the outer bench.","Baard sprang up and drove a flagon into the other’s face. The two men grappled, half upsetting the table-top, so that food and vessels went sliding down into the laps of those on the outer bench.","Baard leaped up and threw his goblet into the other man’s face.

«Ville du ikke mislike det da?» spurte Erlend glad.,"""Wouldn't you dislike it then?"" Erlend asked happily.",“Would it not mislike you if I went?” asked Erlend eagerly.,“You wouldn’t be averse to it?” asked Erlend happily.
"«Nei,» svarte Simon utålmodig. «Han har holdt kjeft. Og jeg tenker han blir ved med det. Erling Vidkunssøn,» sa han bønnlig, «han er eders frende – dere var venner –»","""No,"" Simon replied impatiently. 'He has kept quiet. And I think he'll keep doing that. Erling Vidkunsson, ""he said prayerfully,"" he is your kinsman - you were friends - ""","“No,” answered Simon impatiently. “He has held his tongue. And I trow he will go on holding it. Erling Vidkunssön,” he said beseechingly, “he is your kinsman — you were friends — ”","“No,” replied Simon impatiently. “He has kept silent. And I think he’ll continue to do so.

"Hun satt på pallen i den tomme kirke, lukten av gammel, kald røkelse holdt hennes tanker bundet til bilder av død og timelige tings henfall. Og hun orket ikke løfte sin sjel til å se et glimt av det land hvor de var, hvor all godhet og kjærlighet og troskap til slutt ble flyttet hen og varte. Hver dag, når hun bad for deres sjelefred, syntes det henne selv urimelig at hun skulle be for dem som alt her på jorden hadde eid meget mere fred i sjelen enn hun selv hadde visst av noen stund siden hun ble voksen kvinne. Sira Eiliv sa nok at bønnen for de døde var alltid god – god for en selv dersom hine alt var i freden hos Gud.","She sat on the podium in the empty church, the smell of old, cold incense kept her thoughts bound to images of death and the decay of temporal things. And she could not lift her soul to see a glimpse of the land where they were, where all goodness and love and fidelity were finally moved and lasted. Every day, when she prayed for their peace of mind, it seemed unreasonable to her to pray for those who on earth had had much more peace of mind than she had known for some time since she became an adult. Sira Eiliv probably said that the prayer for the dead was always good - good for oneself even if everything was in peace with God.","She sat on the wall-bench in the empty church, and the smell of cold stale incense held her thoughts fast bound to pictures of death and the decay of all earthly things. And she was powerless to lift up her soul to see a glimpse of the land where her beloved were, whither all goodness and love and truth at last were taken away and there treasured up. Every day when she prayed for the peace of their souls, it seemed to herself strange and unmeet that she should pray for them whose souls already on this earth had possessed a peace far deeper than she had ever known since she grew to be a woman. Sira Eiliv, indeed, said that prayer for the dead was good always — good for oneself, even if those others were already inheritors of God’s peace.","She sat on the bench along the wall of the empty church. The old smell of cold incense kept her thoughts fixed on images of death and the decay of temporal things. And she didn’t have the strength to lift up her soul to catch a glimpse of the land where they were, the place to which all goodness and love and faith had finally been moved and now endured. Each day, when she prayed for the peace of their souls, it seemed to her unfair that she should pray for those who had possessed more peace in their souls here on earth than she had ever known since she became a grown woman. Sira Eiliv would no doubt say that prayers for the dead were always good—good for oneself, since the other person had already found peace with God."
III,III,3,CHAPTER 3
Like efter non kom Gunnulf Nikulaussøn inn til henne. Kristin gikk hastig hen mot munken:,"Shortly after the nun, Gunnulf Nikulaussøn came in to her. Kristin hurried towards the monk:",Just after nones Gunnulf Nikulaussön came in to her. Kristin went swiftly to meet the monk.,Shortly after mid-afternoon prayers Gunnulf Nikulaussøn came to see her. Kristin walked swiftly toward the monk.
"Kristin kunne ikke hjelpe for at midt i hennes dype medynk med piken ble hjertet likesom mindre og hardere i hennes bryst. Margret spurte ikke hva hennes far hadde gjort med Håkon. Det kom for henne i et glimt – Erlend liggende på jorden og hennes egen far over ham med det blodige sverd, og hun selv –. Men Margret hadde ikke rørt seg av flekken. Hun evnet ikke hindre at den gamle foraktfulle uvilje mot Elines datter minnet seg da Margret kastet seg inn til henne, rystende, nesten avsindig av angst, og hun satte seg på sengestokken og prøvde å stagge barnet litt.","Kristin could not help that in the middle of her deep pity for the girl, her heart became smaller and harder in her chest. Margret did not ask what her father had done to Håkon. It came to her in a flash - Erlend lying on the ground and her own father over him with the bloody sword, and she herself -. But Margret had not moved from the stain. She could not prevent the old contemptuous resentment against Eline's daughter from recurring when Margret threw herself into her, shaking, almost insane with anxiety, and she sat down on the bed and tried to stagnate the child a little.","Kristin could not help it — in the midst of her deep pity for the girl, her heart seemed to grow small and hard in her breast. Margret asked not what her father had done with Haakon. In a flash it came before her — Erlend lying on the ground, her father standing over him with a bloody sword, and she herself — But Margret had not moved from the spot. She could not hinder the old scornful dislike for Eline’s daughter from coming up in her again, as Margret clung to her, shaking, well-nigh crazy with fear, and she sat down on the bed’s edge and strove to quiet the child a little.","Kristin couldn’t help it: In spite of her deep sympathy for the girl, her heart seemed to shrink and harden in her breast. Margret didn’t ask what her father had done to Haakon. For an instant she saw Erlend lying on the ground and her own father standing over him with the bloody sword, and she herself . . . But Margret hadn’t budged. Kristin couldn’t stem her old feeling of scornful displeasure toward Eline’s daughter as Margret threw herself against her, trembling and almost senseless with fear. She sat down on the bed and tried to soothe the child."
"De var drivende våte fra isse til tå, alle tre. Erlend brølte på barnedeiene – de kom styrtende – en fra verkmannskleven og en fra stallen. Husbonden bannet dem hit og dit, stappet Gaute oppunder armen sin som en grisunge og jaget de andre foran seg inn i hallen.","They were drifting wet from head to toe, all three. Erlend roared at the children's - they came rushing - one from the workman's clerk and one from the stable. The master cursed them here and there, Gaute stuffed under his arm like a piglet and chased the others in front of him into the hall.","All three were dripping wet from top to toe. Erlend roared out for the children’s nurses — they came rushing, one from the wright’s shop and one from the stable. Their master cursed them heartily, then thrust Gaute under his arm like a sucking-pig, and drove the others before him into the hall.","They were soaked through from head to toe, all three of them. Erlend bellowed for the nursemaids, who came rushing out—one from the workroom and the other from the stable. Their master cursed them roundly, stuffed Gaute under his arm like a piglet, and then chased the other two ahead of him into the hall."
"«Nei, jeg vil være i min egen seng, jeg,» sa barnet. «Kan jeg ikke få sove med deg, Simon,» bad hun.","""No, I want to be in my own bed, I,"" said the child. ""Can't I sleep with you, Simon?"" She asked.","“Nay, for I will be in my own bed,” said the child. “Can I not sleep with you, Simon?” she begged.","“No, I want to sleep in my own bed,” said the child. “Can’t I sleep with you, Simon?” she begged."
"De fikk så hardt vær da de kom syd på Dovre, at efter Ulvs råd lot de hestene sine være igjen på Drivstuen og lånte ski der – om de skulle bli nødt til å legge seg for ute neste natten. Kristin hadde ikke hatt ski på føttene siden hun var liten mø, så det ble tungt for henne å fare frem, enda mennene støttet henne av ytterste evne. De nådde ikke lenger den dag enn midt inn på fjellet mellom Drivstuen og Hjerdkinn, og da det tok til å mørkne, måtte de søke ly i en bjerkeli og grave seg ned i sneen. På Toftar fikk de leid seg hester; her møtte de skodde, og da de kom litt ned i dalen, fikk de regnvær. Da de flere timer efter mørkets frembrudd red inn i Formotunet, ulte vinden om novene, elven bruste, og det suste og durte fra liene. Tunet var som en bløtmyr og dempet lyden av hovslagene – i lørdagskveldens nonshelg syntes ikke tegn til liv på den store gård, og hverken folk eller hunder lot til å bli vár deres komme.","They got such bad weather when they came south on Dovre, that on Ulv's advice they left their horses at Drivstuen and borrowed skis there - if they had to go to bed outside the next night. Kristin had not had skis on her feet since she was a little girl, so it was difficult for her to move forward, even though the men supported her to the best of their ability. They reached no more that day than in the middle of the mountain between Drivstuen and Hjerdkinn, and when it began to get dark, they had to seek shelter in a birch grove and dig into the snow. At Toftar they rented horses; here they met shoals, and when they came a little down into the valley, they got rain. When they rode into Formotunet several hours after dark, the wind howled around the noves, the river burst, and it rustled and rumbled from the slopes. The yard was like a wet bog and muffled the sound of hoofbeats - on Saturday night's nonsense weekend there were no signs of life on the large farm, and neither people nor dogs seemed to be waiting for them to come.","They met such hard weather when they came south on to the high mountains, that by Ulf’s counsel they borrowed ski at Drivstuen and left their horses behind there, lest they should be forced to pass the next night in the open. Kristin had not had ski on her feet since she was a little maid, and it was hard for her to make headway on them, though the men upheld and helped her to the utmost. They could come no farther that day than midway in the hills between Drivstuen and Hjerdkinn; and when it grew dark, they had to seek shelter in a birch-wood and dig themselves down into the snow. At Toftar they were able to hire horses again; here they plunged into mists, and when they came a little down into the Dale, they found rainy weather. When, some hours after dark had fallen, they rode into the Formo courtyard, the wind howled about the house-corners, the river roared, and a rushing, soughing sound came from the hill-side woods. The courtyard was like a swamp, and deadened the sound of the horses’ hoofs — in the Saturday evening holiday from work there was no sign of life on the great manor, and neither the folk nor the dogs seemed to be ware of their coming.","The weather was so severe when they came south to the Dovre Range that they followed Ulf’s advice to leave their horses behind at Drivstuen and borrowed skis, prepared to spend the next night out in the open if need be. Kristin hadn’t had skis on her feet since she was a child, so it was difficult for her to make progress, even though the men supported her as best they could. They reached no farther that day than halfway over the mountain, between Drivstuen and Hjerdkinn. When it began to grow dark, they had to seek shelter in a birch grove and dig themselves into the snow. At Toftar they managed to hire some horses, but there they ran into fog, and when they had descended partway into the valley, rain set in. When they rode into the courtyard of Formo several hours after dark, the wind was howling around the corners of the buildings, the river was roaring, and a great rushing and droning came from the forested slopes. The courtyard was a soggy mire, muffling the sound of the horses’ hooves. As the Sabbath had already begun at this hour on Saturday evening, there was no sign of life on the large estate, and neither the servants nor the dogs seemed to have noticed their arrival."
"Da hadde hun heller villet gjøre alt som hun visste var galt og syndig, enn hun ville miste ham. For å binde Erlend til seg hadde hun gitt ham alt hun eide, sin kjærlighet og sitt legeme, sin ære og sin arv av Guds frelse. Og hun hadde gitt det hun kunne finne å gi, som ikke var hennes: sin fars heder og hans tillit til sitt barn, alt hva voksne og kloke menn hadde bygd opp for å trygge en liten umyndig mø, hadde hun veltet; mot deres planer om ættens velferd og fremgang, mot deres voner om frukt av sitt arbeid når de selv lå under mulden, hadde hun satt sin elskov. Meget mere enn sitt eget liv hadde hun satt inn på det spill hvor den eneste vinst var Erlend Nikulaussøns kjærlighet.","Then she would rather have done everything she knew was wrong and sinful, than she would lose him. To bind Erlend to herself, she had given him everything she owned, her love and her body, her honor and her inheritance of God's salvation. And she had given what she could find to give, which was not hers: her father's honor and his trust in his child, all that grown-ups and wise men had built up to secure a little immature maiden, she had overturned; against their plans for the welfare and progress of the family, against their hopes for the fruits of their labor when they themselves lay under the mullah, she had set her love. Much more than her own life she had invested in the game where the only win was Erlend Nikulaussøn's love.","In those days she had been willing to do all that she knew was evil and sinful rather than lose him. To bind Erlend to her, she had given him all that was hers: her love and her body, her honour and her part in the salvation of her Lord. And she had given him what she could find to give that was not hers: her father’s honour and his trust in his child; all that wise and prudent grown men had built up to safeguard a little maid in her nonage she had overturned; against their plans for the welfare and advancement of their race, against their hopes that their work would bear fruit when they themselves lay under the mould, she had set her love. Much more than her own life had she staked in the game, wherein the sole prize was Erlend Nikulaussön’s love.","Back then she would have done everything she knew was wrong and sinful rather than lose him. To bind Erlend to her, she had given him all that she possessed: her love and her body, her honor and her share of God’s salvation. And she had given him anything else she could find to give: her father’s honor and his faith in his child, everything that grown and clever men had built up to protect an innocent little maiden if she should fall. She had set her love against their plans for the welfare and progress of her lineage, against their hopes for the fruit of their labors after they themselves lay buried. She had put at risk much more than her own life n this game, in which the only prize was the love of Erlend Niku laussøn."
"Hun hadde vært rent ute av seg i det siste, sa gutten. Han visste ikke hva det var. Han kunne ikke minnes om det var henne eller ham selv som hadde funnet på at de skulle fare hit – jo, hun hadde visst først talt om det at hun lengtet så inn til Kristkirken, og han hadde sagt at da ville han følge med henne. Så i morges, straks efter faren var ridd hjemmefra, hadde Kristin sagt at nu ville hun reise. Orm hadde føyet henne, enda han skjønte været så truende ut – men han likte ikke øynene hennes.","She had been out of her mind lately, the boy said. He did not know what it was. He could not remember if it was she or himself who had decided that they should go here - yes, she had probably first talked about the fact that she longed to go to Christ Church, and he had said that then he would follow her. So this morning, immediately after her father had ridden away from home, Kristin had said that now she wanted to leave. Orm had added her, even though he understood the weather so threatening - but he did not like her eyes.","She had been quite unlike herself in these last days, said the boy. He knew not what it was. He could not remember whether ’twas she or himself that had first thought of coming hither — oh, yes, ’twas she that had first spoken of how much she longed to come in to Christ’s Church, and he had said that if that were so, he would go with her. So this morning, straightway after his father had ridden off, Kristin had said that now they would go. Orm had let her have her way, though he saw the weather was threatening — but he liked not the look in her eyes.","She had been so unlike herself lately, said the boy. He didn’t know what was wrong. He couldn’t remember whether it was her idea or his for them to come here— oh yes, she had mentioned first that she had a great longing to go to Christ Church, and he had said that he would accompany her. So this morning, just as soon as his father had ridden off, Kristin told him she wanted to go today. Orm had agreed, even though the weather was threatening—but he didn’t like the look in her eyes."
"Hun skottet opp i prestens åsyn. Han hadde et rundt, sterkt hode og magert, rundt åsyn, med bred, lav panne, litt store kinnben og fint rundet hake. Nesen var rett og ørene små og vakre, men hans munn var lang og smal, og overleppen lå ganske litt frem og skygget over underleppens lille drypp av rødt. Bare håret var likt Erlends – den tette krans om prestens rakede krone var sort med tørr sotglans og så like silkebløt ut som Erlends lugg. Ellers var han ikke ulik sitt søskenbarn, Munan Bårdssøn – nu kunne hun skjønne at det var sant Munan skulle ha vært vakker i ungdommen. Nei, Åshild, mosteren, var det han lignet – nu så hun at han hadde sånne øyne som fru Åshild – ravgule og lysende under smale og rette, sorte bryn.","She shot up in front of the priest. He had a round, strong head and lean, round face, with a broad, low forehead, slightly large cheekbones and a nicely rounded chin. His nose was straight and his ears small and beautiful, but his mouth was long and narrow, and his upper lip lay quite slightly forward, overshadowing the lower lip's small drizzle of red. Only the hair was like Erlend's - the dense wreath around the priest's shaved crown was black with a dry soot sheen and looked as silky soft as Erlend's bangs. Otherwise he was no different from his cousin, Munan Bårdsson - now she could understand that it was true Munan should have been beautiful in his youth. No, Åshild, the aunt, was what he looked like - now she saw that he had eyes like Mrs. Åshild - amber and shining under narrow and straight, black eyebrows.","She looked up into the priest’s countenance.

Only his hair was like Erlend ’s — the close-cropped ring round the priest’s tonsure was black, with a dry, sooty gleam, and looked as though ’twere as silky-soft as Erlend’s mane. For the rest he was not unlike his cousin Munan Baardssön — she could see now it might be true that Munan had been comely in his youth. Nay, ’twas Aashild, his mother’s sister, that he favoured — now she saw that he had the same eyes as Lady Aashild — amber-yellow eyes, shining under narrow straight black brows.","She glanced up at the priest’s face.

Only his hair looked like Erlend’s—the thick fringe around the priest’s shaved crown was black with the luster of dry soot and it looked as silky-soft as Erlend’s hair. Otherwise he was not unlike his cousin Munan Baardsøn—now Kristin could see that it might be true after all that Munan had been handsome in his youth. No, it was his Aunt Aashild whom he resembled—now she saw that he had the same eyes as Fru Aashild: amber-colored and bright beneath narrow, straight black eyebrows."

"Med sine sorger hadde han søkt annetsteds hen. Det var et bilde som alltid demret halvhusket i datterens sinn – faren den natt da kirken brant. Han stod under krusifikset som han hadde berget ut, bærende korset og støttende seg til det.

"Den kvelden hun satt sorgfull efter sin kirkegang, hadde Gunnulf kommet til henne og gitt henne et paternosterbånd. Han sa at i utlandene brukte ikke bare klosterfolk og prester slike radbånd til hjelp ved sine gudfryktighetsøvelser.

He said that in foreign lands ’twas not only cloister-folk and priests that used such bead-rolls for a help in their pious exercises.

She felt so bloodless and faint that nothing seemed to reach her—she was content to lie in bed, only half-alive. There had been a dreadful time when the women hardly dared touch her or tend to her cleanliness, but that had all merged with the confusion of the fever. Now it felt good to submit to the care of others. Around her bed hung many fragrant wreaths of mountain flowers which were meant to keep the flies away—the people from the mountain pastures had sent them, and they smelled especially sweet whenever there was rain in the air. One day Erlend brought the children to her. She saw that they were haggard from their illness, and that Gaute didn’t recognize her, but even that didn’t trouble her. She merely sensed that Erlend seemed always to be at her side."

The lord of the storm mountains forced what the knight forces his war stallion, the chief of Solborg carried it to the battle. Then wonder appeared which was the key to deeper and ever deeper wonders. The blood that flowed down the cross for atonement for all sins and penance for all sorrows, it was the visible sign of wrath. At this first miracle, the eyes of the soul could be opened to the view of the even darker - God who descended to earth became a virgin son and brother with the race of men, who ravaged hell and stormed with his army of liberated souls against the dazzling sea of light that is the world. departed from, and who resides the world. Towards this bottomless and eternal depth of light his thoughts were drawn, and there they vanished into the light and disappeared like a flock of birds into the splendor of the evening sky.","Night after night he had knelt with close-shut senses and limbs benumbed, till he saw the vision. The hill with the three crosses against the sky. Yonder cross in the midst, which was destined to bear the Lord of earth and heaven, trembled and shook, it bent like a tree before the storm, affrighted that it should bear that all too precious burden, the sacrifice for the sins of all the world. The Lord of the Tents of Storm held it in, as the knight curbs his charger, the Chief of the Castle of Heaven it bore to battle. Then was made manifest the wonder that was the key to deeper and ever deeper wonders. The blood that ran down the Cross for the remission of all sins and the boot of all sorrows, that was the visible miracle. By this first wonder the soul’s eye could be opened to behold the yet darker mysteries — God that descended unto earth, and became the Son of a Virgin and Brother to mankind, that harried hell, and stormed with his booty of souls set free up to the blinding sea of light, wherefrom the world hath issued and whereby the world is upholden. And towards those bottomless and eternal deeps of light his thoughts were drawn up, and there they passed into the light and vanished, as a flight of birds passes away into the glory of the evening sky.","Night after night he had knelt here with his senses closed off and his limbs numb, until he saw the vision. The hill with the three crosses against the sky. The cross in the middle, which was meant to bear the king of heaven and earth, shook and trembled; it bent like a tree in a storm, in fear of bearing the much too precious burden, the sacrifice for all the sins of the world. The lord of the storm tents forced it, the way a knight forces his defiant stallion; the chieftain of heaven carried it into battle. Then that miracle occurred which was the key to ever deeper miracles. The blood that ran down from the cross in redemption for all sins and penance for all sorrows—that was the visible sign. With this first miracle the eye of the soul could be opened to contemplate those still hidden—God, who came down to earth and became the son of a virgin and brother to the human kin, who lay waste to Hell and who, with the released souls that were his spoils of war, stormed toward the dazzling sea of light from which the world was born and which sustains the earth. It was toward that unfathomable and eternal depth of light that his thoughts were drawn, and there they perished in the light, vanishing like a flock of birds into the radiance of an evening sky."

"Nei. Dette var så forferdelig at ingen mann kunne gjøre det. Ikke for Kristins skyld engang kunne han gjøre det. De reiste seg samtidig, hilste alteret og gikk ned gjennom kirken; Simons sporer ringlet litt ved hvert steg på flisegulvet. Enda hadde de ikke mælt ord til hverandre, siden de gikk ut av gården, og Simon visste ingenting om hva som nu ville skje.","No. This was so awful that no man could do it. Not for Kristin's sake he could even do that. They got up at the same time, greeted the altar and went down through the church; Simon's spurs curled a little at each step on the tile floor.

Not even for Kristin’s sake could he do it. — They rose together, made obeisance to the altar, and went down the nave; Simon’s spurs jingled a little at each step he took on the stone pavement. As yet they had spoken no word together since they had left the manor, and Simon knew not at all what would now come.","No. It was too terrible for any man to do. Not even for Kristin’s sake could he do that. They stood up together, bowed to the altar, and walked back through the church.

"Men hun småsnakket med Kristin hele tiden og nødet henne til å spise og drikke. Og Kristin skammet seg rent – men hun fikk slik mathug som hun ikke hadde hatt – ja, ikke siden i våres; denne snille konens mat smakte så godt. Og konen lo og sa storfolkets kvinner var vel ikke annerledes skapt enn andre. Om en ikke orket å se maten hjemme, så var det ofte slik at efter fremmed kost kunne en bli rent grisk, selv om den var grov og fattig.","But she chatted with Kristin all the time and forced her to eat and drink. And Kristin was ashamed - but she got such a food craving that she had not had - yes, not since this spring; this kind wife's food tasted so good. And the wife laughed and said that the women of the great people were probably not created differently from others. If you could not bear to see the food at home, it was often the case that after a foreign diet you could become downright greedy, even if it was rough and poor.","But she chatted away to Kristin all the time, and forced her to eat and drink. And Kristin was much ashamed — but she had such a stomach to her meat as she had not felt — not since the last spring; the kind woman’s food tasted so good.

And Kristin was thoroughly ashamed, but she had a craving for food such as she had not felt before—not since the spring. This kind woman’s food tasted so good.

If a woman couldn’t stand to look at food at home, someone else’s food could often make her almost greedy, even if it was poor and coarse fare."
"Og hun hadde vunnet. Hun hadde visst fra han kysset henne første gang i haven på Hofvin til han kysset henne nu i dag i lillestuen, før han ble ført fanget bort fra sitt hjem – Erlend elsket henne så høyt som sitt eget liv.

She had known, from the time when he kissed her for the first time in the garden by Hofvin, even till to-day when he kissed her in the little hall before he was led away a prisoner from his home — Erlend loved her as his own life.

"«Du er visst av de mennene, du Erlend,» sa Sunniva spotsk, «som tror at du er så vinnende og vakker, det kan neppe regnes en kvinne til last at hennes dyd var som skrøpelig glar for deg – hun kan være fast som stål ellers.»","""You are certain of those men, you Erlend,"" said Sunniva mockingly, ""who think you are so winning and beautiful, it can hardly be considered a woman to blame that her virtue was as frail as glaring at you - she can be firm as steel otherwise.

"«Ja, kan hende er det deg imot at jeg hilser på deg?» spurte han. Han stod og holdt sin hest og så ned på henne.

He stood there holding his horse and looking down at her. He was wearing traveling clothes, with a sleeveless leather vest over a light-blue linen tunic; he wore a small silk cap on his head, and his face was rather flushed and sweaty. “It’s strange to see you—but perhaps you’d rather not speak to me?” “Surely you should know . . ."

"«Enda det er en kvinnes enfold som mest volder det,» svarte Haftor leende og flyttet seg efter. «Ja, så sier Erlend og Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn – jeg skulle like å vite hva de mener med det. Hva tror I, Kristin husfrue? Fru Ingebjørg er en god, enfoldig kone – kan hende sitter hun nu slik som I gjør, fletter silke med sine snehvite fingre og tenker: hårdhjertet ville det være å nekte sin fremfarne husbonds trofaste høvding en ringe hjelp til å bedre sine kår –»","""Even it is a woman's simplicity that causes it the most,"" Haftor replied with a laugh and moved after.

Perhaps right now she is sitting as you are, twining silk threads with her snow-white fingers and thinking: It would be hard-hearted to refuse the loyal chieftain of her deceased husband some small assistance to improve his lot.”"
"Det var slik at han tok seg mere nær av denne tilskikkelse enn hustruen kunne vite. Han hadde skrytt så meget av sin festemø helt siden hans frender hadde hentet ham jaord på Jørundgård. Det var det siste han hadde villet, at noen skulle tro han regnet henne eller hennes frender for ringere enn sine egne folk. Nei, alle skulle vite at han holdt det for en heder og en oppreisning da Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn festet ham sin datter. Nu ville folk si han hadde vel ikke regnet møen for stort mere enn et bondebarn når han hadde tort krenke hennes far slik at han sov med datteren før hun var blitt ham gitt til ekte. I sitt bryllup hadde Erlend trengt heftig inn på sin kones foreldre, til sommeren måtte de endelig komme til Husaby og se hvordan han hadde det. Både hadde han gjerne villet vise dem at det var ikke til små kår han førte deres datter inn. Men han hadde også gledet seg til å fare omkring og syne seg i følge med disse vakre og staselige værforeldre; han skjønte at Lavrans og Ragnfrid kunne hevde seg mellom de fremste hvor de så kom hen. Og han hadde trodd, siden den gangen han var på Jørundgård da kirken brant, at Lavrans tross alt ikke likte ham så ille. Nu var det lite rimelig at gjensynet mellom ham og hans konefrender skulle bli til hygge for noen av partene.","It was so that he took a closer look at this appointment than his wife could know. He had boasted so much about his party maiden ever since his relatives had brought him land at Jørundgård. It was the last thing he wanted, for someone to think he considered her or her relatives inferior to his own people. No, everyone should know that he considered it an honor and a reparation when Lavran's Bjørgulf son attached his daughter to him. Now people would say he had probably not considered the maiden too big more than a peasant child when he had dared to offend her father so that he slept with his daughter before she had been given to him for marriage. At his wedding, Erlend had intruded heavily on his wife's parents, until the summer they finally had to come to Husaby and see how he was doing. He had both wanted to show them that it was not in small circumstances that he brought their daughter in. But he had also looked forward to wandering around and appearing with these beautiful and stately weather-parents; he understood that Lavrans and Ragnfrid could assert themselves among the foremost wherever they went. And he had believed, since the time he was at Jørundgård when the church burned, that Lavrans, after all, did not like him so badly. Now it was not reasonable that the reunion between him and his wife-friends should be pleasant for some of the parties.","The thing was that this misadventure galled him more nearly than his wife could know. He had boasted not a little of his betrothed ever since his kinsmen had gone to Jörundgaard and won her father’s consent. It was the last thing he had wished, that any should believe he held her or her kin of less account than his own kindred. No — all men should know that he held himself honoured and uplifted again to worship by Lavrans Björgulfsön’s betrothing his daughter to him. Now would all folks say he could scarce have held the maid much better than a peasant’s child, since he had dared to do her father such despite as to sleep with his daughter before she was given him in wedlock. At his wedding Erlend had pressed his bride’s parents strongly to come to Husaby the next summer and see how things were with him there. Not alone was he fain to show them it was no mean condition he had brought their daughter to; but he had been glad, too, at the thought of going about and showing himself in the company of these comely and stately new kinsfolk, for he knew that Lavrans and Ragnfrid could hold their own with the foremost, wherever they might come. And he had deemed, since the time he was at Jörundgaard when the church burned down, that, in spite of all, Lavrans liked him none so ill. But now there was small reason to think that the next meeting between him and his wife’s kin would bring joy to either part.","As it turned out, he took this act of fate more to heart than his wife could know. He had boasted so much of his betrothed, ever since his kinsmen had won Lavrans’s assent at Jørundgaard. This was the last thing Erlend had wanted—for anyone to believe that he considered her or her kinsmen to be lesser than his own people. No, everyone must know that he held it to be an honor and a distinction when Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn betrothed him to his daughter. Now people would say that Erlend had not considered the maiden much more than a peasant child, since he had dared to offend her father in such a manner, by sleeping with the daughter before she had been given to him in marriage. At his wedding, Erlend had urged his wife’s parents to come to Husaby in the summer to see how things were on his estate. He wanted to show them that it was not to paltry circumstances that he had brought their daughter. But he had also looked forward to traveling around and being seen in the company of these gracious and dignified in-laws; he realized that Lavrans and Ragnfrid could hold their own among the most esteemed of people, wherever they might go. And ever since the time when he was at Jørundgaard and the church burned down, Erlend had thought that Lavrans was rather fond of him, in spite of everything. Now it was unlikely that the reunion between Erlend and his wife’s kinsmen would be pleasant for either party."
"«Ja det ordet har vi hos oss med,» sa Lavrans; han og Erling var kommet borttil. «Enda ble jeg lurt, Haftor, her i vinter – jeg ville tenne min lykt med en fersk hestelort –,» han satte seg opp på bordkanten. Herr Erling hentet straks hans beger, bød ham det med en hilsen, og så satte ridderen seg ned i benken nær ham.","""Yes, we have that word with us,"" said Lavrans; he and Erling had come over. ""I was still tricked, Haftor, this winter - I wanted to light my lantern with a fresh horse shit -"" he sat up on the edge of the table. Mr. Erling immediately fetched his cup, offered it to him with a greeting, and then the knight sat down on the bench near him.","“Aye, we have that byword too,” said Lavrans — he and Erling had joined them — “yet was I cheated, Haftor, last winter — when I would have lit my lantern with a piece of fresh horse-dung.” He sat himself down on the edge of the table. Straightway Sir Erling fetched Lavrans’ beaker across and proffered it to him with a bow, then sat down near him on the bench.","“Yes, we have that saying too,” said Lavrans; he and Erling had come over to join them. “ And yet I was duped, Haftor, this past winter, when I tried to light my torch with fresh horse droppings.” He perched on the edge of the table. Sir Erling at once brought his goblet and offered it to Lavrans with a word of greeting. Then the knight sat down on a bench nearby."
"Det skrapte av ski utenfor på skaren, hundene fór i været, og hunder svarte utenfor. Simon lukket på døren ut til den måneblå natt og Gyrd, som kom inn, slank og høy og vakker og stille.

"Da kom det fra skogen bak dem – en langtrukken tuten som vokste og vokste i natten. Det var ulv – der var flere. Erlend stanset skjelvende, slapp henne, og Kristin kjente han gjorde korsets tegn mens han knuget øksen i den andre hånden. «Hadde du nu – å nei –!» Han drog henne inn til seg så hardt at hun ynket seg ved det.","Then it came from the forest behind them - a elongated spout that grew and grew in the night.

He pulled her in so hard that she moaned at it.","Then came a sound from the woods behind them — a long-drawn howl that mounted higher and higher in the night. It was wolves — and there were many. Erlend stopped short, shivering, loosed his hold on her, and Kristin knew that he crossed himself, while he gripped the axe in his other hand. “Had you now been — oh, no — ” He crushed her to him so fiercely that she moaned with pain.","Then they heard it from the forest behind them—a long, drawn-out howl that grew and grew in the night.

"Tre ganger gikk hun bedende omkring kirken.

"Folk ble litt rare i ansiktene. Fra gamle herr Guttorm Helgessøn kom det noen underlige prust. Herr Eiliv selv strevde for ikke å smile.

"Simon mente å ha skjønt, Erlend selv ventet ikke annet, og han syntes fattet på at han måtte bøte dyrt for sitt vågespill. «Når kyr ligger i myr, får den ta i ved rumpen som eier,» sa han og lo litt.

"Noen timer senere, da Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn red fra Hjerdkinn, ble datteren ved å gå ved siden av hans hest. Svennen var kommet et godt stykke i forveien, men han ble ved å ri fot for fot. Det var så vondt å se på hennes forgråtte, fortvilte ansikt.

"Hun så at Erlend ble ved å være regnet blant de unge. Enda han var et år eldre enn drottseten. Hun skjønte det passet godt for mange at han var slik, så hans ord og hans gjerning kunne settes ned til å være en ung, uvøren manns råd og dåd.

Even though he was a year older than the queen seat.

Then he was liked, pampered and praised - but not considered a full-fledged man. And she saw how willing he was to be the one his peers wanted him to be.","She saw that Erlend was still reckoned as one of the young men — though he was a year older than the High Steward. She understood that it suited many folk well that such he should be held to be, so that his words and his deeds could be belittled as being but the deeds and counsels of a hot-headed young man.

He who had beat his head against nearly every barrier of Norwegian law and Christian commandment. Such things were well learned and not easily forgotten. The man was quick-witted and he had been taught well in his youth. Now all this became apparent in him again.

"RAGNFRID IVARSDATTER LEVDE IKKE fulle to år efter sin husbond, hun døde tidlig på vinteren i 1332. Det er langt fra Hamar til Skaun, så på Husaby spurte de ikke hennes død før hun hadde ligget i jorden mere enn en måned. Men ved hvitesøndagstider kom Simon Andressøn dit; det var nu ett og annet å avtale mellom frendene om arven efter Ragnfrid.

But at Pentecost Simon Andressøn came there; there was now something to agree between the relatives about the inheritance after Ragnfrid.

"De to eldste sønnene var uadskillelige. Bjørgulv var størst og sterkest av barna, jevnhøy med Nåkkve, som var tre halvår eldre, og tykkere. Han hadde strikrøllet, ramsvart hår, det lille ansikt var bredt, men vakkert, øynene blåsorte. En dag spurte Erlend engstelig moren om hun visste at Bjørgulf så ikke godt på det ene øyet – han skjelte også ganske litt. Kristin sa hun trodde ikke det hadde noe på seg, han vokste det vel av seg. Det var blitt slik at hun hadde alltid tatt seg minst av dette barnet – han var blitt født da hun var slitt av stellet med Nåkkve, og Gaute hadde fulgt så snart efter. Han var den kraftigste av barna, visst også den klokeste, men han var fåmælt. Erlend holdt mest av denne sønnen.","The two eldest sons were inseparable. Bjørgulv was the largest and strongest of the children, level with Nåkkve, who was three and a half years older, and thicker. He had curly, frame-black hair, his little face was broad but beautiful, his eyes blue-black. One day Erlend anxiously asked his mother if she knew that Bjørgulf did not see well in one eye - he also scolded quite a bit. Kristin said she did not think it was wearing anything, he grew it well. It had become so that she had always taken the least care of this child - he had been born when she was worn out by the care of Nåkkve, and Gaute had followed so soon after. He was the most powerful of the children, certainly also the wisest, but he was quiet. Erlend loved this son the most.","The two eldest sons were not to be parted. Björgulf was the biggest and strongest of the children, as tall as Naakkve, who was three half-years older, and stouter than he. He had tight-curled raven-black hair; his little face was broad but comely; the eyes dark blue. One day Erlend asked their mother somewhat fearfully if she knew that Björgulf had not good sight in one eye — and that he had the slightest squint, too. Kristin said she believed not there was much amiss; ’ twas like he would grow out of it. Things had so fallen out that she had always made least ado with this child — he had been born when she was worn out with nursing Naakkve, and Gaute had followed so close on his heels. He was the strongest of the children, and, it seemed, the quickest-witted, but he was most silent. Erlend was fondest of this son.","The two eldest sons were inseparable.

"Hun led fordi hun følte seg så hård og ond siden hun ikke kunne se på Margrets ferd uten med uvilje og dømmesyke. Men enda meget mere led hun ved å se og høre på de evige rivninger mellom Erlend og hans eldste sønn. Hun led aller mest fordi hun skjønte Erlend elsket i sitt innerste hjerte denne gutten så grenseløst – og han ble urimelig og heftig mot Orm for han visste ikke sin arme råd hva han skulle gjøre med sønnen eller hvordan han skulle trygge hans fremtid. Han hadde gitt sine frillebarn gård og fe – men det var likesom en så utenkelig tanke at Orm skulle duge til bonde. Og så gav Erlend seg rent over når han så hvor svak og kraftløs Orm var – da kalte han sønnen råtten, raste med å herde ham, holdt på i timetall og øvde ham i bruk av tunge våpen som gutten umulig orket føre, truet ham til å drikke seg syk om kveldene, halvsprengte gutten på vågelige og slitsomme jaktferder. Under alt dette så Kristin angsten i Erlends sinn – han var vill av sorg ofte, skjønte hun, fordi denne fine og skjønne sønnen hans bare høvet på en eneste plass – og der stod hans byrd i veien. Og så hadde Kristin lært å forstå hvor liten tålmodighet Erlend hadde, når han måtte engste seg for eller ynke noen han holdt av.","She suffered because she felt so hard and evil since she could not look at Margret's journey without reluctance and judgment. But she suffered even more by watching and listening to the eternal rifts between Erlend and his eldest son. She suffered the most because she understood Erlend loved in his innermost heart this boy so boundlessly - and he became unreasonable and violent towards Orm because he did not know his poor advice what to do with his son or how to secure his future. He had given his illegitimate children a farm and cattle - but it was like such an unthinkable thought that Orm would be able to become a farmer. And then Erlend gave in when he saw how weak and powerless Orm was - then he called his son rotten, rushed to harden him, kept on for hours and practiced him in the use of heavy weapons that the boy could not possibly carry, threatened him. to get sick in the evenings, the boy half-blown on daring and tiring hunting trips. During all this Kristin saw the anxiety in Erlend's mind - he was wild with grief often, she realized, because this nice and beautiful son of his only raised in one place - and there his burden stood in the way. And then Kristin had learned to understand how little patience Erlend had, when he had to worry about or pity someone he loved.","It was pain to her to feel herself so hard and cruel that she could not look on at Margret’s doings without anger and harsh judgment. But ’twas much more pain to see and hear the endless bickerings between Erlend and his eldest son. The pain was the keener because she saw that Erlend in his inmost heart had a boundless love for the boy — and he was unjust and rough towards Orm because he was at his wit ’s end to know what he should do with his son or how he could make his future sure. He had given his bastard children lands and goods — but it seemed unthinkable that Orm could ever make a farmer. And Erlend grew desperate when he saw how weak and sinewless Orm was — he would call his son rotten; strive fiercely to harden him; practise him, hours after hour, in use of heavy weapons that ’twas impossible the boy could wield; force him to drink himself sick in the evenings, and bring him back half dead from perilous and toilsome huntings. Beneath all this Kristin could see the anguish of Erlend’s heart — he was wild with sorrow often, she saw, that this fine-grained and comely son of his was fit but for one place — and from that his birth barred him out. And thus had Kristin come to understand how little patience Erlend had when he must fear for one that was dear to him or feel pity for him.","Kristin suffered because she felt so harsh and mean since she couldn’t watch Margret’s behavior without feeling indignant and censorious. But she suffered even more from observing and listening to the constant discord between Erlend and his eldest son.

He had given his bastard children property and livestock, but it seemed unthinkable that Orm would ever be fit to be a farmer.

He would spend hours with his son, training him in the use of heavy weapons that the boy couldn’t possibly handle, urging him to drink himself sick in the evenings, and practically breaking the boy on dangerous and exhausting hunting expeditions. In spite of all this, Kristin saw the fear in Erlend’s soul; she realized that he was often wild with sorrow because this fine and handsome son of his was suited for only one position in life—and there his birth stood in the way. And Kristin had come to understand how little patience Erlend possessed whenever he felt concern or compassion for someone he loved."
"«Mente du, Erlend, at du var hennes husbond for Gud, den som skulle verne og verge henne – da tykkes meg din ferd enda verre.

The features of his face were delicate and charming, his complexion fresh, with red cheeks and a faint golden tinge from the sun; he had clear eyes and an open expression. He greeted his men with a polite bearing and pleasant courtesy. Then he placed his hand on Erling Vidkunssøn’s sleeve and led him several steps away from the others, as he thanked him for coming."

"Han ble lei for han hadde kommet til å si dette. Erling Vidkunssøn hadde selv hatt megen sorg slik i sitt hjem. Døtrene hans var sunne barn og vokste opp, men også han hadde bare fått beholde en eneste av sine sønner i live, og den gutten skulle være svak av helse. Men herr Erling spurte bare:","He was sorry he had come to say this. Erling Vidkunssøn himself had had a lot of grief like this in his home. His daughters were healthy children and grew up, but he too had only been allowed to keep one of his sons alive, and that boy was to be weak from health. But Mr Erling only asked:","My sons died early, and only one of my brother’s sons lived to a man’s age.”","Lavrans regretted that he had come to speak of this matter. Erling Vidkunssøn had endured great sorrow of his own. His daughters were healthy children and had grown to adulthood, but he too had only been allowed to keep a single son, and the boy was said to be in poor health. But Sir Erling merely said, “And you have no close kinsmen from your mother’s lineage, either, as I recall.”"
"«Ha deg ville jeg nok gjerne, Ramborg min. Men jeg har aldri tenkt at så ven og ung en mø skulle være eslet meg. Jeg er sytten år eldre enn du er – du tenker nok ikke på det, at så skulle du ha en gammel surøyd, digervommet husbond mens du selv er en kone i dine beste år –»","""I would probably like you, my Ramborg. But I never thought that such a friend and young a maid would be asshole me. I'm seventeen years older than you are - you probably do not think about it, that then you should have an old sour-eyed, big-eyed husband while you yourself are a wife in your best years - »","“Right fain would I be to have you, my Ramborg. But I had never thought that so fair and young a maid could be meant for me. I am seventeen years older than you — you have not thought, I trow, how you would like to have an old blear-eyed, big-bellied husband when you were a woman in your best years — ”","“Certainly I would like to marry you, dear Ramborg. But I’ve never thought that such a young, beautiful maiden would be intended for me. I’m seventeen years older than you; no doubt you haven’t thought about how you would end up with an old, bleary-eyed, big-bellied husband while you were a woman in the best of her years.”"
"Han gikk hjem, drev i stallene og uthusene og lette efter noe å bruke munn for, trettet med prestens deie fra spitalen fordi hun hadde båret malt inn i tørkehuset, enda han visste godt hans husfolk fikk ikke bruk for kjølnen denne gang, mens de var i byen. Han ønsket han hadde hatt guttene sine her, det hadde vært selskap i dem –. Han ønsket han kunne reist hjem til Husaby med det samme. Men han var nødt til å bie i kaupangen på brevene sydfra – det var for vågalt å ta mot slike bud i sitt hjem ute på bygden.","He went home, drove in the stables and outbuildings and looked for something to use his mouth for, tired of the priest's dough from the hospital because she had carried paint into the drying house, even though he knew well his household did not need the keel this time, while they were in town. He wished he had had his boys here, there had been company in them -. He wished he could go home to Husaby immediately. But he had to beg in the market for the letters from the south - it was too daring to accept such orders in his home in the countryside.","He went home, and wandered about the stables and outhouses seeking for somewhat to find fault with; he had words with the priest’s serving-maid from the hospital because she had brought malt into his drying-house, though he knew well that his house-folk would have no use for the house this time while they were in the town. He wished he had had his boys here — they would have been some company — he wished he could set forth back to Husaby at once. But he must needs wait in the city for letters from the south — ’twas too venturesome to have such things come to hand at one’s home in the country.","He went home and wandered through the stables and outbuildings, looking for something to complain about; he quarreled with the priest’s servant from the hospital because she had brought malt into the drying room, even though he knew that his own servants had no use for the grain-drying house while they were in Nidaros. He wished that his sons were with him; they would have been good company. He wished he could go back home to Husaby at once. But he had to stay in Nidaros and wait for letters to arrive from the south; it was too risky to receive such letters at his own home in the village."

"Gud, skap i meg et rent hjerte, og forny en stadig ånd i meg.","God, create in me a pure heart, and renew a constant spirit in me.",* See Note 3.,"IN THE MORNING of the tenth day after the child’s birth, Master Gunnulf said to his brother when they were alone in the hall, “It’s about time now, Erlend, for you to send word to your wife’s kinsmen about how things are with her.”"
"Erlend svarte, ja det var så. Han hadde bodd i herr Erlings gård i fjor sommer, da han var i Bjørgvin, og han hadde nu lært å skjønne mannen bedre. Det var slik at Erling ville foran alle ting holde oppe landefreden. Men han ville at Norgesveldet skulle ha løvens fred – det skulle gjelde at ingen fikk bryte ut tann eller klippe klo på deres frende kong Håkons løve – og ikke skulle den rettes av til å være jakthund heller for et annet landsfolk. Forresten lå det nu Erling på hjerte å få brakt til ende de gamle tvistigheter mellom nordmennene og fru Ingebjørg. Nu da hun satt enke efter herr Knut, kunne en bare ønske at hun skulle få noen makt over sønnen igjen. Det var nok så at hun bar så ovstor kjærlighet til de barna som hun hadde født Knut Porse, så det syntes som hun i noe monn hadde glemt sin eldste sønn – men det ble vel annerledes når hun kom til funds med ham igjen. Og det var ikke slik at fru Ingebjørg kunne ha noen grunn til å ønske kong Magnus skulle blandes inn i uroen i Skåne fordi om hans halvbrødre hadde sine len der.","Erlend replied, yes it was so. He had lived in Mr. Erling's farm last summer, when he was in Bjørgvin, and he had now learned to understand the man better. It was so that Erling would above all things maintain the peace of the land. But he wanted the Norwegian Empire to have the lion's peace - it should apply that no one was allowed to break a tooth or cut a claw on their cousin King Håkon's lion - and it should not be directed to be a hunting dog for another country people either. By the way, it was now Erling's heart to bring to an end the old disputes between the Norwegians and Mrs. Ingebjørg. Now that she was widowed by Mr. Knut, one could only wish that she would have some power over her son again. It was probably the case that she had such a great love for the children she had given birth to Knut Porse, so it seemed as if she had somehow forgotten her eldest son - but it was probably different when she came to find him again. And it was not the case that Mrs. Ingebjørg could have any reason to want King Magnus to be involved in the unrest in Scania because his half-brothers had their counties there.","Erlend answered: aye, it was so. He had dwelt in Sir Erling’s house last summer, when he was at Björgvin, and he had learned to understand the man better now. So it was that Sir Erling wished above all things to uphold the King’s peace in the land. But he wished, too, that Norway’s realm should have the lion’s peace — that none should have leave to break a tooth or clip a claw of their kinsman King Haakon’s lion — and that it should not be turned, either, into a trained hunting-dog for the people of another land. For the rest, Erling had it much at heart now to bring to an end the old quarrels between Norsemen and Lady Ingebjörg. Now that she had been left a widow by Sir Knut, one could not but wish that she should get some power over her son again. True it was that she bore such exceeding great love to the children she had borne to Knut Porse that it seemed she had in some measure forgotten her eldest son, but doubtless all this would be changed when she came to meet with him again.","Erlend replied that this was true. He had stayed at Sir Erling’s estate the summer before, when he was in Bjørgvin, and he now knew the man much better. It was evident that, above all else, Erling wanted to maintain peace in the land. But he wanted the Norwegian Crown to have the peace of the lion—which meant that no one should be allowed to break off a tooth or cut off a claw from their kinsman King Haakon’s lion. Nor should the lion be required to become the hunting dog for the people of some other country. And now Erling was also determined to bring to an end the old quarrels between the Norwegians and Lady Ingebjørg. Now that she had been left a widow by Sir Knut, it was only desirable for her to have some control over her son again. It was no doubt true that she felt such great love for the children she had borne to Knut Porse that she seemed to have almost forgotten her eldest son—but things would surely be different when she saw him again. And Lady Ingebjørg could have no reason to wish for King Magnus to interfere in the unrest occurring in Skaane, because it was under the authority of his half-brothers."
"Simon nevnte hvordan han hadde funnet henne, syk og full av angst for mannen. Olav Hermanssøn hadde lovet å virke for hun skulle få komme inn til ham straks herr Bård kom hjem.","Simon mentioned how he had found her, sick and full of anxiety for the man. Olav Hermanssøn had promised to work for her to come to him as soon as Mr. Bård came home.","Simon told him of how he had found her, sick and full of fear for her husband. Olav Hermanssön had promised to do his best to have her let in to see him, as soon as Sir Baard came home.",Simon told him how he had found her: ill and very frightened for her husband. Olav Hermanssøn had promised to seek permission for her to come to see him as soon as Sir Baard returned home.
"Fru Gunna tok i: Fryktet de ikke Gud mere enn at de sang slikt – nu da de ikke kunne vite noen kveld, når de la seg, om de ikke var morløse før hønsene gol. Kristin sa intet og gikk stille inn i huset.","Mrs. Gunna took in: Did they not fear God more than that they sang like that - now that they could not know any night, when they went to bed, if they were not motherless before the hens crowed. Kristin said nothing and walked quietly into the house.","Lady Gunna spoke up then; had they so little fear of God that they could sing such things — and now, when they could not know, any night when they lay down to rest, that they might not be motherless before cock-crow? Kristin said no more, but went quietly into the house.","Fru Gunna joined in: Had they no fear of God that they would sing such a song? Especially now that they couldn’t be sure, when they went to bed at night, whether they might be motherless before the roosters crowed? Kristin didn’t reply but went quietly back into the house."
"Da de kom til Oslo, fikk Simon straks spurt at kongen ikke kom til Norge – han ville nok drikke jul i Stockholm. Erlend satt i borgen på Akersnes; høvedsmannen var bortreist, så inntil videre var det uråd for noen av dem å få se ham. Men underfehirden, Olav Kyrning, lovet å la Erlend vite de var i kaupangen. Olav var meget vennlig mot Simon og Kristin, for hans bror var gift med Ramborg Åsmundsdatter fra Skog, så han regnet mågskap langt ute med Lavransdøtrene.","When they came to Oslo, Simon was immediately asked that the king did not come to Norway - he probably wanted to drink Christmas in Stockholm. Erlend sat in the castle at Akersnes; the captain was away, so for the time being it was unwise for any of them to see him. But the sub-shepherd, Olav Kyrning, promised to let Erlend know they were in the market. Olav was very kind to Simon and Kristin, because his brother was married to Ramborg Åsmundsdatter from Skog, so he considered gullibility far out with the Lavrans daughters.","When they came to Oslo, Simon soon learnt that the King would not come to Norway — he was to hold the Yule-tide feast at Stockholm, it seemed. Erlend was in the castle at Akersnes; the Governor of the castle was away, so that in the meantime ’twas not possible for any of them to see the prisoner. But the Under-Treasurer, Olav Kyrning, promised to let Erlend know they were in the city. Olav showed much friendliness toward Simon and Kristin, for his brother was wedded to Ramborg Aasmundsdatter of Skog, so that he counted him a far-off kinsman of Lavrans’ daughters.","When they arrived in Oslo, Simon learned at once that the king would not be coming to Norway—he would apparently celebrate Christmas in Stockholm. Erlend was being held in the castle at Akersnes; the chieftain was away, so for the time being it would be impossible for any of them to see him. But the deputy royal treasurer, Olav Kyrning, promised to let Erlend know that they had come to town. Olav was quite friendly toward Simon and Kristin because his brother was married to Ramborg Aasmundsdatter of Skog, which made him distantly related to the daughters of Lavrans."
"Slik var det hjemme, og så hadde faren sitt høysete ved bordenden – men da stod sengene nu ved forstueveggen. Hjemme satt hennes mor øverst på ytterbenken så hun kunne gå fra og til og ha øye med matens frembæring. Bare når der var gjestebud, satt Ragnfrid ved sin husbonds side. Men her var høysetet midt under østgavlen, og Erlend ville hun skulle alltid sitte der hos ham. Og hjemme bød faren alltid Guds tjenere plassen i høysetet hvis slike var gjester på Jørundgård, og han selv og Ragnfrid tjente dem mens de åt og drakk. Men det ville ikke Erlend uten de var av høy rang. Han elsket ikke meget prester og munker – det var dyre venner, mente han. Kristin måtte tenke på det som faren og Sira Eirik alltid sa når folk klaget over kirkemennenes pengegriskhet: Hver mann glemte den syndige gammen han hadde gjort seg, når han skulle betale for den.","That was how it was at home, and then the father had his high seat at the end of the table - but then the beds now stood by the hall wall. At home, her mother sat at the top of the outer bench so she could walk from time to time and keep an eye on the food presented. Only when there were banquets did Ragnfrid sit by her husband's side. But here the high seat was in the middle of the east gable, and Erlend wanted her to always sit there with him. And at home, the father always offered God's servants the place of priority if such were guests at Jørundgård, and he and Ragnfrid served them while they ate and drank. But Erlend did not want it without them being of high rank. He did not love priests and monks very much - they were dear friends, he thought. Kristin had to think about what her father and Sira Eirik always said when people complained about the churchmen's greed for money: Every man forgot the sinful vulture he had made when he had to pay for it.","So it was at her home, and there her father had his high seat at the board’s end — but then the beds there were by the entrance wall.

But here the high seat stood in the middle of the eastern gable-end, and Erlend would have her always sit in it with him. At home her father always placed God’s servants in the high seat, if any such were guests at the manor, and he himself and Ragnfrid served them while they ate and drank. But Erlend would have none of this, unless they were high of station. He was no great lover of priests and monks — they were costly friends, he was used to say. Kristin could not but think of what her father and Sira Eirik always said, when folk complained of the churchmen’s greed of money: men forgot the sinful joys they had snatched for themselves when the time came to pay for them.","That’s where it stood at home, and her father had his high seat at the head of the table. But at Jørundgaard the beds stood along the wall to the entryway. At home her mother sat at the end of the outer bench so that she could go back and forth and keep an eye on the food being served. Only when there were guests did Ragnfrid sit at her husband’s side. But here the high seat was in the middle beneath the east gable, and Erlend always wanted Kristin to sit with him. At home her father always offered God’s servants a place in the high seat if they were guests at Jørundgaard, and he and Ragnfrid would serve them while they ate and drank.

"Nei, de tok ikke Erlend i alvor – ikke nu, da han dog på et vis ble hedret. Men den tiden da han, ung og trassig og fortvilet, levde med horkonen og ikke ville sende henne fra seg tross kongebud og kirkebann – da hadde de tatt ham i alvor, vendt seg fra ham i stormende forbitrelse over hans gudløse og skjendige levnet. Nu var det gjemt og tilgitt – og Kristin skjønte det var noe av takknemlighet for dette at hennes husbond så villig føyde seg og var slik som folk ville ha ham til å være – han hadde nok lidd bittert i den tiden han var som utstøtt av sine jevningers lag her hjemme. Det var bare det – hun måtte tenke på sin far når han eftergav udyktige menns skyld og gjeld – med et ganske lite skuldertrekk.

Var det slik at Erlend hadde fått sine ungdomssynder tilgitt –.","No, they did not take Erlend seriously - not now, when he was somehow honored. But the time when he, young and defiant and despairing, lived with the adulteress and would not send her away despite the king's command and curse - then they had taken him seriously, turned away from him in stormy resentment over his godless and shameful remnant. Now it was hidden and forgiven - and Kristin realized it was something of gratitude for this that her husband so willingly gave in and was the way people wanted him to be - he had probably suffered bitterly in the time he was outcast from his equalization team here at home. It was just that - she had to think of her father when he forgave the guilt and debt of incompetent men - with a rather small shrug. It was a Christian duty to carry on with those who could not make shells for themselves. Was it the case that Erlend had had his youthful sins forgiven -.","No, they took not Erlend in earnest — not even now, when he was honoured after a fashion. But in those days when, young and headstrong and desperate, he had lived in whoredom with a woman, and would not put her away in despite of King’s command and Church’s ban — then they had taken him sadly enough, turning their backs on him in furious wrath over his godless and shameless life. Now was all this forgotten and forgiven — and Kristin understood that there was something of thankfulness for this in her husband’s willingness to yield, and be what folk would have him to be — he had suffered bitterly, she knew, in the days when he lived an outcast from among his fellows here in his home. There was but one thing — she must needs think of her father when he forgave some good-for-naught his rent or his debt — with the slightest shrug of his shoulders. ’ Twas our Christian duty to bear with them that could not play a man’s part. Was it thus that Erlend had gained forgiveness for his sins of youth — ?","No, they didn’t take Erlend seriously—not now, when he was in some ways respected. But back in the days when he was young and stubborn and desperate, when he lived with his concubine and refused to send her away in spite of the king’s command and excommunication from the Church—back then they did take him seriously, turning away from him in bitter fury at his ungodly and disgraceful life. Now it was all forgiven and forgotten, and Kristin realized that it was partly out of gratitude for this that her husband so willingly acquiesced and behaved in the way people wanted him to behave. He must have suffered bitterly during that time when he was banished from the company of his peers in Norway. But the problem was, it made her think of her father, when he released incompetent men from their obligations or debts with a mere shrug of his shoulders. It was a Christian duty to bear with those who could not conduct themselves properly. Was it in this manner that Erlend had been forgiven the sins of his youth?"
"Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter var død alene – ingen hadde vært nær da hun drog det siste sukk, uten en tjenestekone som sov. Det hjalp ikke stort, det som Simon sa – at hun var dog død vel forberedt. Det var som en særskilt Guds førelse at hun noen få dager i forveien hadde kjent i seg en slik hunger efter Frelserens legeme, så hun hadde skriftet og fått tjeneste hos den prestmunken i klostret som var hennes sjelesørger. Visselig hadde hun fått en god død – Simon hadde sett hennes lik og sa det hadde tyktes ham et merkelig syn. Hun var blitt så fager i døden; hun var jo en kone på nær de tre snes år, og hun hadde jo allerede i mange år vært meget furet og rynket i ansiktet – men det var blitt aldeles forandret, forynget og glattet ut, hun hadde rent sett ut som en ung kvinne som sov. Nu var hun blitt stedt til hvile ved sin husbonds side; dit hadde de også ført Ulvhild Lavransdatters levninger kort tid efter farens død. Over gravene var lagt en stor stenhelle som tvedeltes av et vakkert uthugget kors, og på et slynget bånd stod skrevet et langt latinsk vers som prioren i klostret hadde diktet – men Simon kunne ikke huske det ordentlig, for han skjønte ikke stort av det sprog.","Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter was dead alone - no one had been close when she took the last sigh, without a servant woman who was asleep. It did not help much that Simon said - that she was dead well prepared. It was as a special conduct of God that a few days before she had felt such a hunger for the Savior's body, so she had confessed and received service from the monk in the convent who was her mourner. Certainly she had had a good death - Simon had seen her body and said it had seemed to him a strange sight. She had become so beautiful in death; she was a wife of nearly three dozen years, and she had already for many years been very furrowed and wrinkled in the face - but it had been completely changed, rejuvenated and smoothed out, she had looked like a young woman who sov. Now she had been laid to rest by her husband's side; there they had also carried Ulvhild Lavransdatter's remains shortly after her father's death. Over the tombs was a large stone slab divided by a beautifully carved cross, and on a twisted ribbon was written a long Latin verse that the priory of the monastery had composed - but Simon could not remember it properly, for he did not understand much of that language.","Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter had died all alone — none had been near when she drew her last breath, saving a serving-woman, who slept. ’ Twas not much comfort, what Simon said — that, though death came so suddenly, she was yet well prepared. It seemed like a special providence of God that, a few days before, she had felt in her such a hunger for her Redeemer’s Body that she had confessed and taken the sacrament from the priest in the cloister who was her director. ’ Twas certain she had made a good death — Simon had seen her body, and said it had seemed to him a marvellous sight. In death she had been so fair; she was, one knew, a woman nigh threescore years of age, and for many years her face had been much wrinkled and furrowed; but this was changed altogether: her face was grown young and smooth, so that she looked like naught else but a young woman fallen asleep. Now had she been laid to rest by her husband’s side; thither, too, had they brought Ulvhild Lavransdatter’s bones a short time after her father’s death. Over the graves was laid a great stone slab, divided in two by a fairly carven cross, and on a winding scroll was written a long Latin verse that the Prior of the cloister had made; but Simon could not remember it rightly, for he knew but little of that tongue.","Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter had died alone; no one had been near as she drew her last breath except a servant woman, who was asleep. And it helped very little that Simon had said she was well prepared for her death. It was like the providence of God that several days earlier Ragnfrid had felt such a longing for the body of the Savior that she made her confession and was given communion by the priest of the cloister, who was her confessor. It was true that she had been granted a good death. Simon saw her body and said he thought it a wondrous sight—she had grown so beautiful in death. She was a woman of nearly sixty, and for many years her face had been greatly lined and wrinkled, and yet now it was completely changed; her face was youthful and smooth, and she looked just like a young woman asleep. She had been laid to rest at her husband’s side; there they had also brought Ulvhild Lavransdatter’s remains shortly after her father’s death. On top of the graves a large slab of stone had been placed, divided in two by a beautifully carved cross.

"Kristin spurte efter sin søster, og Simon svarte, Ramborg hadde fulgt Sundbu-konene ned til Ringheim; Jostein hadde hentet sin datter Helga, og så hadde han villet ha også Dagny og Ramborg med seg – han var slik en munter, vennesæl gammel mann og hadde lovet å ta godt vare på de tre unge koner.

"Noen netter senere var folkene på Husaby kommet i seng noe drukne og meget forspiste, for det var de siste dagene før fasten gikk inn, de sov derfor tungt.

"Hun hadde tatt det som sin lagnad, den hun måtte bære tålmodig og med rak rygg – at dette hvilte på henne. Som hun hadde strevet for å være tålmodig og holde seg rank under sitt livs vilkår hver gang hun kjente at nu hadde hun atter fått et barn å bære under barmen – igjen og igjen. Med hver sønn som øket flokken, hadde hun kjent at nu øket hennes ansvar for slektens trivsel og trygge stilling – hun så i kveld at også hennes evne til å se omkring over det hele, hennes vaktsomhet, hadde øket med hvert nytt barn hun fikk å våke for. Aldri hadde hun sett det så klart som denne kvelden, hva skjebnen hadde krevd av henne, og hva den hadde skjenket henne med de syv sønnene. Om igjen og om igjen hadde gleden over dem kviknet hennes hjertes slag, angst for deres skyld flenget det – de var hennes barn, de store drengene med magre, kantede gutteskrotter, som de hadde vært det da de var så små og lubne at de kunne neppe slå seg når de trillet overende på sine ferder mellom benken og hennes kne. De var hennes som de hadde vært det den tid hun løftet dem av vuggen opp til sitt melkebryst og måtte støtte under hodet, for det nikket på den spede hals som en blåbjelle nikker på stilken. Hvor de kom til å vandre i verden, hvor henne de fór og glemte mor sin – hun syntes at deres liv måtte for henne være en rørsle i hennes eget liv, de måtte være som ett med henne selv, som de hadde vært det da hun alene på jorden visste om det nye liv som lå i gjemsel og drakk av hennes blod og gjorde hennes kinn bleke. Om igjen og om igjen hadde hun prøvd den syknende, sveddryppende angst når hun kjente, nu igjen var det hennes time, nu igjen skulle hun dras under i barnsnødens grunnbrott – til hun bares opp med et nytt barn i favnen; hvor meget rikere og sterkere og modigere av hvert barn, det skjønte hun først i kveld.","She had taken it as her lagnad, the one she had to carry patiently and with a straight back - that this rested on her. As she had strived to be patient and stay upright under the conditions of her life every time she felt that now she had once again had a child to carry under her bosom - again and again. With each son increasing the herd, she had felt that now her responsibility for the family's well-being and secure position increased - she saw tonight that her ability to look around at everything, her vigilance, had also increased with each new child she had to watch for. She had never seen it so clearly as this evening, what fate had demanded of her, and what it had bestowed on her with the seven sons. Again and again the joy over them had kindled her heartbeat, anxiety for their sake tore it - they were her children, the big boys with skinny, angular boy carcasses, as they had been when they were so small and plump that they could hardly beat themselves when they rolled over on their journeys between the bench and her knee. They were hers as they had been the time she lifted them from the cradle up to her milk breast and had to support under her head, for it nodded at the tender neck like a blue bell nodding at the stem. Where they came to walk in the world, where she they went and forgot her mother - she thought that their life had to be for her a stir in her own life, they had to be as one with herself, as they had been when she alone on earth knew about the new life that lay in hiding and drank of her blood and made her cheeks pale. Again and again she had tried the sickening, sweat-dripping anxiety when she felt, now again it was her hour, now again she was to be submerged in the foundation of childbirth - until she was carried up with a new child in her arms; how much richer and stronger and braver of every child, she realized that only tonight.","She had taken it as her lot, to be borne patiently and unflinchingly, that all this rested on her shoulders. Even so she had striven to be patient and to hold her head high under the burden her life laid on her, each time she knew she had again a child to bear under her heart — again and again. With each son added to the flock, she had felt more strongly the duty of upholding the welfare and safety of the house — she saw to-night, too, that her power to overlook the whole, her watchfulness, had grown with each new child she had to watch and strive for. Never had she seen so clearly as this evening what fate had craved of her and what it had granted her, in giving her these seven sons. Over again and over again had joy in them quickened the beating of her heart, fear for them pierced it — they were her children, these great lads with their lean angular boys’ bodies, as they had been when they were so small and plump they could scarce hurt themselves when they tumbled in their journeys between the bench and her knee. They were hers, even as they had been when, as she would lift one of them from the cradle up to her breast for milk, she had to hold up its head, because it nodded on the slender neck as a bluebell nods on its stalk. Wherever they might wander out in the world, whithersoever they might fare, forgetful of their mother, she felt as though for her their life must still be an action of her life, they must still be as one with herself as they had been when she alone in all the world knew of the new life which lay hidden within and drank of her blood and made her cheeks pale. Over again and over again had she proved the sickening sweating terror when she felt: now her time was come again, now again was she to be dragged under in the breakers of travail — till she was borne up again with a new child in her arms; how much richer and stronger and braver with each child, never till to-night had she understood.","She had accepted it as her fate, to be borne with patience and a straight back, that this had fallen to her. Just as she had striven to be patient and steadfast no matter what life presented, every time she learned she was carrying yet another child under her breast—again and again. With each son added to the flock she recognized that her responsibility had grown for ensuring the prosperity and secure position of the lineage. Tonight she realized that her ability to survey everything at once and her watchfulness had also grown with each new child entrusted to her care. Never had she seen it so clearly as on this evening—what destiny had demanded of her and what it had given her in return with her seven sons. Over and over again joy had quickened the beat of her heart; fear on their behalf had rent it in two. They were her children, these big sons with their lean, bony, boy’s bodies, just as they had been when they were small and so plump that they barely hurt themselves when they tumbled down on their way between the bench and her knee. They were hers, just as they had been back when she lifted them out of the cradle to her milk-filled breast and had to support their heads, which wobbled on their frail necks the way a bluebell nods on its stalk. Wherever they ended up in the world, wherever they journeyed, forgetting their mother—she thought that for her, their lives would be like a current in her own life; they would be one with her, just as they had been when she alone on this earth knew about the new life hidden inside, drinking from her blood and making her cheeks pale. Over and over she had endured the sinking, sweat-dripping anguish when she realized that once again her time had come; once again she would be pulled under by the groundswell of birth pains—until she was lifted up with a new child in her arms. How much richer and stronger and braver she had become with each child was something that she first realized tonight."
"Enda undret han seg da han stod for den unge konge. Han hadde ikke sett Magnus Eirikssøn siden denne var barn, og han hadde allikevel ventet at det skulle vært noe kvinneaktig, klamt eller ufriskt ved ham – men dette var en av de vakreste unge menn som Simon hadde festet øye på – og han så mandig og kongelig ut i all sin ungdom og slanke spedhet.","He still wondered when he stood before the young king. He had not seen Magnus Eiriksson since he was a child, and he had nevertheless expected that there would be something feminine, clammy or unhealthy about him - but this was one of the most beautiful young men that Simon had noticed - and he looked manly and royal in all its youth and slender spedness.","Yet was he filled with wonder when he stood before the young King. He had not seen Magnus Eirikssön since the King was a child, and, in spite of his disbelief, he had looked to find something womanish, soft or unhealthy about him — but this was one of the properest young men Simon had set eyes on — and he looked manly and kingly too, despite of his youth and slender fineness.","Yet he was surprised when he stood before the young sovereign.

Men Ramborg var et bedre gifte enn han hadde kunnet vente. Det var bare de to døtrene til å skifte arven efter Lavrans.

"Så kom han i tanker om at han burde føre med fra Nidaros ett og annet som værmoren kunne trenge til gravølet – vin og voks, hvetemel og paradisgryn og slikt. Men endelig kom de dog av sted og nådde frem til Jørundgård dagen før jardtrudmesse.","Then he came to the thought that he should bring from Nidaros a few things that the weather mother could need for the funeral - wine and wax, wheat flour and paradise and such. But finally they got off and reached Jørundgård the day before the yard truce fair.","Then he bethought him that he should take from Nidaros one thing and another that his mother-in-law might need for the grave-ale — wine and wax, wheat flour and millet and the like. But at length they were ready to set forth, and they came to Jörundgaard the day before Gertrude’s Mass.","Then it occurred to him that he ought to bring a few things from Nidaros that his mother-in-law might need for the funeral feast: wine and wax, wheat flour and Paradise grains and the like.

"Han måtte være slik at han tålte ikke noe riktig godt og rent nær seg. For Kristin – ja, siden hun var kommet ut av synden og urenheten som han hadde ført henne inn i – hun hadde vært som en engel fra Guds himmerike. Mild og trofast, saktmodig, dugelig, verdig til heder. Æren hadde hun ført inn igjen på Husaby. Hun var blitt igjen den hun hadde vært hin sommernatt da det skjære, unge jomfrublod føyde seg inn under hans kappe der i klosterhaven, og han hadde tenkt, mens han kjente det fine, unge legeme mot sin side – djevelen selv kunne ikke nenne å krenke dette barn eller volde henne sorg –.","He had to be so that he could not stand anything really good and clean near him. For Kristin — yes, since she had come out of the sin and uncleanness into which he had led her — she had been like an angel from the kingdom of God. Mild and faithful, meek, capable, worthy of honor. She had brought the honor back to Husaby. She had remained the one she had been that summer night when the cut, young virgin blood flowed under his cloak there in the monastery garden, and he had thought, while he felt the fine, young body against his side - the devil himself could not bother to offend this child or cause her grief -.","He must be such an one that he could not suffer aught that was truly good and pure near him. For Kristin — aye, since she was escaped from the sin and uncleanness he had led her into, she had been as an angel from God’s heaven. Mild and trusty, gentle, diligent, worthy of honour. She had brought honour to Husaby once more. She was become again what she had been on yonder summer night when the pure young maiden soul nestled in under his cloak out there in the cloister garden and he had thought, as he felt the slender young body against his side — the devil himself could not find in his heart to hurt this child or cause her sorrow.…","He must be the kind of man who couldn’t tolerate anything truly good or pure to be near him. Because Kristin . . . Ever since she had emerged from the sin and impurity into which he had led her, she had been like an angel from God’s heaven. Kind and faithful, gentle, capable, deserving of respect. She had returned honor to Husaby. She had become once again the person she had been on that summer night, when the pure young maiden had crept under his cape there in the convent garden; and he had thought when he felt that slender young body against his side: The Devil himself wouldn’t dare harm this child or cause her sorrow."
"En stund efter måtte hun hvile igjen. Hun fant en liten grønn bakke ved veien; der løp en bekk. Kristin la barnet i gresset; han våknet og illskrek, så hun skyndte seg tankespredt gjennom de bønnene hun skulle ha sagt. Så tok hun Nåkkve i fanget og løste opp reiven. Han hadde skitnet seg ut, og hun hadde lite ombytte til ham; så skyllet hun ut klutene hans og la dem til tørk på noen hete svaberg i solen. Ytterplaggene tullet hun løselig om gutten. Dette likte han nok, å få ligge og sprelle mens han drakk av sin mors barm. Kristin så glad på hans fine, rosenhvite lemmer og klemte den ene hånden hans inn mellom sine bryster mens hun gav ham.","After a while she had to rest again. She found a small green hill by the road; there ran a stream. Kristin put the child in the grass; he woke up and was terrified, so she hurried thoughtfully through the prayers she should have said. Then she took Nåkkve in her lap and untied the tear. He had gotten dirty, and she had little exchange for him; then she rinsed out his cloths and left them to dry on some hot rocks in the sun. She loosely joked about the boy's outer garments. He probably liked this, to lie down and bounce while he drank from his mother's bosom. Kristin looked happily at his fine, rose-white limbs and squeezed one of his hands between her breasts as she gave him.","Soon after she must needs rest again. She found a little green slope near by the road, with a stream running by it. Kristin laid her child in the grass; he wakened and began to shriek piteously, so that she hastened with a wandering mind through the prayers she should have said. Then she took Naakkve in her lap and unwound his swaddling-clothes. He had fouled his cloths, and she had but little with her to put in their stead; so she washed out the cloths and laid them on a warm smooth rock to dry in the sun. The outer clothes she wrapped loosely round the boy. He liked this well, for he could kick and sprawl now, as he drank from his mother’s breast. Kristin looked with joy at his fine rosy-white limbs, and pressed down one of his hands between her breasts as she suckled him.","A little while later she had to rest again. She found a small green hill along the road with a trickling creek. Kristin placed the child on the grass; he woke up and cried loudly, so she hurried distractedly through the prayers she had meant to say. Then she picked up Naakkve, held him on her lap, and loosened the swaddling clothes. He had sullied his underclothes, and she had little to change him with; so she rinsed the cloths and spread them out to dry on a bare rock in the sun. She wrapped the outer garments loosely around the boy. He seemed to like this, and lay there kicking as he drank from his mother’s breast. Kristin gazed happily at his fine, rosy limbs and pressed one of his hands between her breasts as she nursed him."

"«Hvorfor gjorde du dette?» hvisket han. Og da hun ikke svarte, sa han enda saktere:","""Why did you do this?"" he whispered. And when she did not answer, he said even more slowly:","“Why did you this?” he whispered. And when she made no answer, he said, yet lower:","“Why did you do that?” he whispered. And when she didn’t reply, he said even more softly, “Do you so regret that you came to my manor?”"
"Endelig gikk han. Kristin krøp opp i et av sengestedene øverst under brynåsen. Derfra kunne hun nå å åpne en luke. Og det var en fæl lukt i herberget – der lå en kone som hadde bukrev. Kristin lukket opp – sommernatten lys og sval, regntvettet luft strømmet inn over henne. Hun satt i den korte sengen med nakken støttet mot veggstokkene – det var så lite med puter i sengen. Gutten sov på hennes fang. Hun hadde ment å stenge gluggen igjen om en stund, men hun sovnet fra det.","Finally he left. Kristin crawled up in one of the beds at the top of the brow nose. From there she could now open a hatch. And there was a bad smell in the hostel - there was a wife who had a belly button. Kristin opened up - the summer night light and cool, rain-washed air flowed over her. She sat in the short bed with her neck against the wall - there were so few pillows in the bed. The boy slept on her lap. She had intended to close the window again for a while, but she fell asleep from it.","At last he went away. Kristin crept up into one of the uppermost box-beds, close under the roof. From it she could reach up to open a trap in the roof — and there was need, for there was a sickening smell in the hostel. Kristin opened the trap — the rain-washed air of the bright cool summer night streamed in about her. She sat in the short bed with her head and neck propped against the wall-timbers — there were so few pillows in the bed. The boy slept on her lap. She had meant to shut the trap again in a while, but she fell asleep unawares.","Finally the man left. Kristin crept into one of the beds high up beneath the center roof beam. From there she could reach a hatch. There was a foul smell in the hostel—one of the women was in bed with a stomach ailment. Kristin opened the hatch. The summer night was bright and mild, the rain-washed air streamed down on her. She sat in the short bed with her head leaning back against the timbers of the wall; there were few pillows for the beds. The boy was asleep in her lap. She had meant to close the hatch after a moment, but she fell asleep."
"Lavrans reiste seg opp, gikk noen skritt, urolig – så sa han enda saktere:","Lavrans got up, took a few steps, anxiously - then he said even more slowly:","Lavrans rose to his feet and walked a few steps, restlessly — then he said yet lower:","Lavrans stood up, took a few steps, feeling uneasy."
"«Enda så unner jeg henne at dette blir dulgt – om råd er dertil. Dere karer,» vendte hun seg til svennene som stod omkring, «er husbond deres så tro, dere vil ikke mæle om dette før han har snakket med dere om hvordan denne tretten mellom Håkon og ham kom opp –»","""Even then, I treat her to this being hidden - if advice is available. You guys, ""she turned to the servants standing around,"" are your husband so faithful, you will not talk about this until he has talked to you about how this thirteen between Håkon and him came up - ""","“Yet would I be fain for her sake that this should be hid — if hid it can be.

"Erlend kjente seg viss på at Gunnulf var mellom disse. Og tre netter senere satt han virkelig alene med sin bror i en jordgamme som hørte til en liten norsk gård ved stranden, hvor de hadde funnet hinannen.","Erlend felt certain that Gunnulf was among these. And three nights later he was really alone with his brother in a ridge that belonged to a small Norwegian farm by the beach, where they had found each other.","Erlend felt sure within him that Gunnulf was of the company. And, true enough, three nights later he sat alone with his brother in an earthen hut on a little Norse farm that lay by the strand where they had met.",Erlend felt certain that Gunnulf was among them. And three nights later he was indeed sitting alone with his brother in a sod hut that belonged to a little Norwegian farm near the shore where they had found each other.
"«Ja, jeg skjønner det,» sa Erlend bittert. Så taltes de ikke mere ved. Og neste morgen red han tilbake til Nidaros.","""Yes, I understand,"" Erlend said bitterly. Then they no longer spoke. And the next morning he rode back to Nidaros.","“Aye, so much I can see,” said Erlend bitterly. After this they spoke no more. And the next morning he rode back to Nidaros.","“Yes, I know that,” said Erlend bitterly. And then they said no more. The next morning he rode back to Nidaros."
"Han sa det ikke til Kristin, og han hadde ikke sagt det til de menn som han hadde talt med om dette. Men ham tyktes det lite rimelig at det bak Erlend skulle stå noen stor flokk av menn som hadde bundet seg til å støtte oppunder med liv og gods i en så farlig sak; de ville da neppe ha valgt ham til høvding – at Erlend var upålitelig, visste dog alle hans jevninger. Det var sant at han var fru Ingebjørgs og kongsemnets frende; han hadde nydt noen makt og anseelse i de siste årene, han var ikke så aldeles uøvd i krig som de fleste av sine jevnaldrende, og han hadde ord for å kunne vinne og føre leidangsmenn – og enda han så mange ganger hadde stelt seg uvettig, så kunne han føye sin tale vel og forstandig, så det lå nær å tro han hadde nu sent omsider lært forsiktighet av skade. Simon tenkte, rimeligvis var der dem som hadde visst om Erlends forehavende og puffet ham frem, men det skulle undre ham om de hadde bundet seg så fast at de ikke kunne dra seg unna nu og Erlend ble stående med ryggen bar.","He did not tell Kristin, and he had not told the men he had talked to about this. But it seemed to him unreasonable that behind Erlend should be a large herd of men who had bound themselves to support themselves with life and goods in such a dangerous cause; they would then hardly have chosen him chief - that Erlend was unreliable, though all his equations knew. It was true that he was a relative of Mrs. Ingebjorg and the king; he had enjoyed some power and prestige in recent years, he was not as completely untrained in war as most of his peers, and he had words to be able to win and lead leaders - and yet he had so many times acted foolishly, then he could add his speech well and sensibly, so that it was close to believing that he had now at last learned the caution of harm. Simon thought, there were probably those who had known about Erlend's endeavor and pushed him forward, but he would be surprised if they had tied themselves so tightly that they could not pull away now and Erlend was left with his back bare.","Though he said it not to Kristin, and had not said it to the men with whom he had talked of this, it seemed to him little likely that Erlend should have at his back any powerful band of men who had bound themselves to risk life and goods in such a perilous affair — had it been so , they would scarce have chosen him their chief, for that Erlend was rash and unstable all his fellows must know well. It was true that he was kinsman to Lady Ingebjörg and the young pretender; he had enjoyed much power and esteem in these latter years, he was not quite so unpractised in war as were most men of an age with him — was known as one that his men liked and followed — and though he had so often borne him witlessly, yet could he, when he would, speak well and to the point, so that it might well be thought that he had now at long last learnt prudence from his mischances. Simon thought ’twas most like there were some who had known of Erlend’s undertaking and had pushed him forward; but he could scarce believe that they had bound them so strongly that they could not draw back now and leave Erlend to bear the brunt alone.","He didn’t tell Kristin, nor had he told any of the men he talked to, but he thought it unlikely that Erlend would have a large group of men behind him who had bound themselves to support him with their lives and property in such a perilous undertaking. And certainly they would never have chosen him as chieftain; all his peers knew that Erlend was unreliable. It was true that he was the kinsman of Lady Ingebjørg and the pretender to the throne. He had enjoyed both power and respect in the last few years, he was more experienced in war than most of his peers, and he had a reputation for being able to recruit and lead soldiers. Even though he had acted unwisely so many times, he could still present his arguments in such a good and convincing manner that it was almost possible to believe he had finally learned caution from his misdeeds. Simon thought it likely that there were some who knew of Erlend’s plan and had urged him on, but he would be surprised if they had bound themselves so closely that they couldn’t now retreat; Erlend would be left standing with no one to back him."
"Straks efter stod de på kanten av bakken; leiren hadde falt ut her en gang i tiden, og gården lå rett under den, så tett innunder den skittengule skrent, hvor litt svart, strantet ugress grodde oppover, at stanken fra svinestien, som de så ned i, slo stram opp mot dem – to fete sugger gikk og snasket i det mørke dynn. Elvebredden var som en smal stripe her, åens grå og gjørmete strøm med gnuslende isflak uti rant like opp til de forfalne hus med de vissenbleke tak.","Immediately after, they stood on the edge of the hill; the camp had fallen out here once upon a time, and the farm lay just below it, so close under the dirty yellow cliff, where a little black, stranded weeds grew up, that the stench from the pigsty, in which they looked down, hit hard against them - two fat suckers went and snorted in the dark mud. The river bank was like a narrow strip here, the river's gray and muddy stream with crumbling ice flakes flowing right up to the dilapidated houses with the faded roofs.","Soon after they stood at the edge of the high ground; there had once been a landslip in the clay bank here, and Fluga’s house lay right under it, so close up against the dirty yellow slope, where a few black stunted weeds were growing, that the stench of the pigsty, which they looked down on, came rankly up to them — two fat sows were snuffling about in the black mud. The river-bank was but a narrow strip here; the muddy grey river-current, with the jostling ice-flakes on it, came right up to the tumble-down houses with their bleached grey shingle roofs.","A moment later they were standing on the ridge of a hill; the earth had given way out here sometime before, and the farm now lay right below the hill—so close to the dirty-yellow slope, covered with tufts of black, dried weeds, that the rank stench from the pigsty, which they were looking down at, rose up toward them. Two fat sows were wallowing around in the dark muck. The riverbank was only a narrow strip here; the gray, murky current of the river, filled with careening ice floes, ran right up to the dilapidated buildings with the faded rooftops."
"«Av Århammar solgte han mere enn det halve til søstrene i Rein den tiden han gjorde seg ferdig til å rømme av landet med deg» – Ulv lo litt – «eller gav det i pant – det blir det samme når det er Erlend.

Free of charge - the entire investigation rests with Audun, which is located on the farm that will now be called your property. ""","“Of Aarhammar he sold more than half to the Sisters of Rein convent, that time when he made ready to flee the land with you” — Ulf laughed a little — “or pledged it — ’tis the same thing with Erlend. Free from the King’s levy — the whole of that is on Audun’s shoulders, who holds the farm that now is to be called yours!”","“He sold more than half of Aarhammar to the sisters at Rein back when he was preparing to flee the country with you.” Ulf laughed. “Or pledged it as security, which amounts to the same thing, in Erlend’s case.

"– Trengtes det,» spurte han igjen. «Kunne du ikke løst henne, du?»","""Was it needed,"" he asked again. ""Couldn't you fix her, could you?""",— Was it needful?” he asked again. “Could not you have absolved her?”,Was it necessary?” he asked again. “Couldn’t you have offered her absolution?”
"Også Simon og Erlend var gode venner når de møttes, men de søkte ikke hverandres selskap. Kristin ble ved å føle en hemmelig sky for Simon Darre – for det han visste om henne, og enda mere fordi hun visste at hin gangen hadde han stått med æren og Erlend med skam. Det gjorde henne rasende når hun tenkte på at selv dette syntes Erlend å ha kunnet glemme. Så var hun ikke alltid omgjengelig mot mannen. Var Erlend da i det lune at han bar hennes pirrelighet godmodig og med blidhet, så tirret det henne at han ikke tok seg nær av hennes ord. En annen dag kunne det hende at hans tålmodighet var meget kort, og da ble han hissig, men hun svarte beskt og kaldt tilbake.","Simon and Erlend were also good friends when they met, but they did not seek each other's company. Kristin continued to feel a secret cloud for Simon Darre - for what he knew about her, and even more because she knew that this time he had stood with the honor and Erlend with shame. It made her furious when she thought that even this Erlend seemed to have been able to forget. Then she was not always sociable towards the man. Was Erlend then in the mood that he carried her irritability good-naturedly and with gentleness, then it teased her that he did not take near her words. Another day his patience might be very short, and then he became irritable, but she answered bitterly and coldly back.","Simon and Erlend, too, were good friends when they met, but they sought not each other’s company. Kristin still felt a secret shrinking from Simon Darre — both by reason of what he knew of her, and still more because she knew that from that day at Oslo he had come off with honour and Erlend with shame. She raged at the thought that even this Erlend should be able to forget. Thus she was not ever good-humoured with her husband. And if Erlend chanced to be in the mood to bear her testiness good-humouredly and with meekness, it vexed her that he took her words so little to heart. Another day it might chance that his temper was short, and then he would grow hot, and she would answer him coldly and bitterly.","Simon and Erlend got along well whenever they were together, but they didn’t seek out each other’s company. Kristin still felt a secret shyness toward Simon Darre—because of what he knew about her, and even more because she knew that he was the one whose conduct had been honorable, while Erlend had acted with shame. It made her furious when she realized that Erlend could forget even this. And so she wasn’t always amenable toward her husband. If Erlend was in a mood to bear her irritability with good humor and gentleness, it would annoy her that he wasn’t taking her words seriously. On some other day he might have little patience, and then his temper would flare, but she would respond with bitterness and coldness."
"– Jeg kan ikke si at jeg vet så nøye hvordan loven er i slike mål. Siden min herre kong Håkon døde, har jeg vært nøyd med det at jeg skyldte hans eftermann min tjeneste når han ville byde over meg, i krig og i fred – ellers så har jeg holdt meg i ro på gården min. Men jeg kan ikke skjønne annet enn at det er fart frem med ulov i dette målet mot Erlend Nikulaussøn. Hans stallbrødre hadde skilt og dømt i hans sak – med hvilken rett de dømte ham fra livet, vet ikke jeg – så ble der budt ham grid og leide til han kunne komme til møte med sin frende kongen – om han skulle ville unne Erlend å bli forlikt med seg. – Siden har mannen ligget i tårnet på Akersborgen bortimot et år, og kongen har vært utenlands mest all den tiden – noen brev har fart og reist – intet er kommet ut av det. Så sender han hit noen knaper – ikke er de norske, og ikke er de kongens hirdmenn – og frister å forhøre Erlend på slikt vis som er uhørt fremferd mot en norsk mann som har hirdmanns rett – mens fred råder i landet og Erlends frender og jevninger drar sammen i Tunsberg for å feire kongens bryllup –.","- I can not say that I know so well how the law is in such cases. Since the death of my lord King Håkon, I have been content to owe my successor to his successor when he would bid over me, in war and in peace - otherwise I have kept quiet on my farm. But I can not understand other than that there is speed with illegalness in this case against Erlend Nikulaussøn. His stable brothers had divorced and judged in his case - with what right they sentenced him from life, I do not know - so he was offered a grid and rented until he could come to meet his cousin the king - if he would treat Erlend to stay settled with him. Since then, the man has been lying in the tower at Akersborg for almost a year, and the king has been abroad most of the time - some letters have traveled and traveled - nothing has come out of it. Then he sends a few men here - they are not Norwegians, and they are not the king's herdsmen - and tempts to interrogate Erlend in such an unheard of way against a Norwegian man who has a herdsman's right - while peace prevails in the country and Erlend's relatives and friends gather in Tunsberg to celebrate the king's wedding -.","“I cannot say that I know to a hair how the law stands in such matters. Since my lord King Haakon died, it hath been enough for me that I owed him that came to his throne my service when he listed to call for it, in war and in peace — else have I dwelt in quiet upon my estates. But I cannot see aught else than that in this case against Erlend Nikulaussön there have been unlawful doings. His fellows had sifted his case and given judgment in it — with how much right they doomed him to death, I know not — then was he offered reprieve and safe-conduct till he could be brought to a meeting with the King, his kinsman — that perchance he might grant Erlend grace to make his peace with him. … Since has the man lain in the tower of Akers Castle nigh on a year, and the King has been abroad well-nigh all that time — some letters have passed to and fro — naught has come of it. Then he sends hither some varlets — Norsemen they are not, nor of the King’s guard — and dares to put Erlend to the question in such wise as none ever heard that a Norseman with a Guardsman’s rights was dealt with before — this while there is peace in the land, and Erlend’s fellows and his kinsmen are gathering at Tunsberg to honour the King’s wedding.…","“I can’t say that I know exactly what the law is about such matters. Ever since my lord King Haakon died, I’ve been content with the idea that I owed his successor my service if he should ask for it, both in war and in peace; otherwise I’ve lived quietly on my manor. But now I can only think that this case against Erlend Nikulaussøn has been unlawfully handled. His fellow noblemen have passed judgment on him, but I don’t know by what right they condemned him to death. Then a reprieve and safe conduct were granted to him until he could meet with his kinsman, King Magnus, to see whether the king might allow Erlend to be reconciled with him. But since then the man has been imprisoned in the tower at Akers Castle for nearly a year, and the king has been abroad almost all that time. Letters have been dispatched, but nothing has come of it. And now he sends over these louts, who are neither Norwegian nor the king’s retainers, and who attempt to interrogate Erlend with conduct that is unheard of toward any Norwegian man with the rights of a royal retainer—while peace reigns in the land, and Erlend’s kinsmen and peers are gathering in Tunsberg to celebrate the royal wedding."
"Håkon trakk på skuldrene, og da han gikk, bad han hilse Margareta.","Håkon shrugged, and when he left, he asked to greet Margareta.","Haakon shrugged his shoulders and, when he left, begged them to greet Margareta from him.","Haakon shrugged his shoulders, but when he left, he asked them to give his greetings to Margareta."
"«Nei,» sa Kristin voldsomt. «Fru Åshild bad oss – hun bad Erlend, og hun bad meg, slik at jeg skjønner ikke jeg torde stå imot – at vi skulle fare frem så hederlig som det enda var råd til – falle min far til fote og be ham tilgi oss at vi hadde misgjort. Men jeg torde ikke. Jeg skyldte på det jeg var redd far skulle drepe Erlend – å, jeg visste godt far ville ikke gjort den mann noe som gav seg selv og sin sak i hans hender. Jeg skyldte på det at jeg var redd han skulle få slik sorg at han kunne aldri holde opp sitt hode mere. Å, jeg har da vist det siden, jeg var ikke så redd for å gjøre min far sorg –. Du kan ikke vite, Gunnulf, hvor god en mann min far er – ingen kan vite som ikke kjenner min far, hvor snill han har vært mot meg alle dager. Alltid har far holdt slik av meg. Jeg ville ikke han skulle få vite jeg hadde fart så skamløst ad mens han trodde jeg satt hos søstrene i Oslo og lærte alt som rett og godt var – ja, jeg bar ungsøsterklærne mens jeg lå med Erlend i fjøs og loft nede i byen –»","""No,"" Kristin said violently. ""Mrs. Åshild begged us - she begged Erlend, and she begged me, so that I do not understand I dared to resist - that we should proceed as honorably as could still be afforded - fall my father to his feet and ask him to forgive us that we had wronged. But I did not dare. I blamed what I was afraid father would kill Erlend - oh, I knew well father would not do that man something that gave himself and his case in his hands. I blamed that I was afraid he would get so sad that he could never hold his head up again. Oh, I've shown it since, I was not so afraid to hurt my father -. You can not know, Gunnulf, how good a man my father is - no one can know who does not know my father, how kind he has been to me every day. Dad has always loved me like that. I did not want him to know I was speeding so shamelessly while he thought I was sitting with the sisters in Oslo and learned everything that was right and good - yes, I wore the young sister's clothes while I lay with Erlend in the barn and attic down in the city - »","“No,” said Kristin vehemently. “Lady Aashild prayed us — she prayed Erlend and she prayed me, in such wise that I know not how I could hold out against her — that we should deal honourably, so far as that yet might be — fall at my father’s feet and pray him to forgive us our misdeeds. But I dared not. I made pretence that I was fearful lest father should slay Erlend — oh, though I knew well father would never have harmed a man who yielded himself and his cause into his hands. I made pretence that I feared to bring on him such sorrow that he could never hold up his head again. Oh, but I have shown since, I feared not so much to bring my father sorrow — You cannot believe, Gunnulf, how good a man my father is — none could know, that knows not my father, how good he has been to me all my days. Ever has father loved me so. ’ Twas that I could not bear he should know I had borne me so shamelessly, that while he deemed I was sitting among the Sisters at Oslo, learning all that was good and right — aye, for I bore the novices’ weed while I was lying with Erlend in barns and in lofts down in the city — ”","“No,” said Kristin vehemently. “Fru Aashild pleaded with us. She begged Erlend and she begged me so that I don’t understand how I dared defy her—to step forward in as honorable a manner as was still possible, to fall at my father’s feet and implore him to forgive us for what we had done. But I didn’t dare. I argued that I was afraid that Father would kill Erlend—but oh, I knew full well that Father would never harm a man who put himself and his case into his hands. I argued that I was afraid he would suffer such sorrow that he would never be able to hold his head high again. But I have since shown that I was not so afraid to cause my father sorrow. You can’t know, Gunnulf, what a good man my father is—no one can realize it who doesn’t know him, how kind he has been to me all my days. Father has always been so fond of me. I don’t want him to find out that I behaved shamelessly while he thought I was living with the sisters in Oslo and learning everything that was right and just. I even wore the clothing of a lay sister as I met with Erlend in cowsheds and lofts in town.”"
"«Nei, la far dø i fred,» sa Simon. «Du og jeg kan vel greie å verge vår søster, så de ikke skal få ribbe henne fordi hun har vært i en slik ulykke –»","""No, let Dad die in peace,"" Simon said. ""You and I can probably guard our sister so they don't get to rib her because she's been in such an accident -""","“Nay, let father die in peace,” said Simon. “You and I between us should be able to guard our sister and see that they strip her not because she has fallen into such mischance.”","“No, let Father die in peace,” replied Simon. “You and I will manage to protect our sister, so they don’t rob her because she has suffered such misfortune.”"
"Alt det Kristin bad den andre ikke gjøre seg umake, så disket dog bondekonen opp med mat og øl av juletønnen. Imens tenkte hun – på Husaby var der vel et stell! Selv var hun en fattig manns kone, liten hjelp hadde de hatt på gården og oftest ingen, men aldri hadde Øistein tålt at hun gikk alene utenfor tungjerdet når hun var med barn – ja, bare hun skulle i fjøset efter det mørknet, så måtte noen lye efter henne. Men den rikeste husfruen i bygden kunne gå og våge seg ut for den styggeste død, og ikke en kristen sjel passet på henne – enda tjenestefolkene gikk og datt over hverandre på Husaby og gjorde ingenting.

But the richest housewife in the village could go and venture out for the ugliest death, and not a Christian soul took care of her - even the servants went and fell on each other at Husaby and did nothing. It was probably true then, as people said, that Erlend Nikulaussøn was already tired of his marriage and equally happy with his wife -.","For all Kristin prayed the other not to put herself about, her hostess was not to be hindered from serving her with food and with ale from the Yule-cask. And she was thinking the while — a rare rule must they keep at Husaby! She herself was but a poor man’s wife; little help had they had on their farm, and often none at all; but never would Öistein suffer her to go alone without the farm-yard fence when she was with child — nay, if she but went across to the byre after dark had fallen, someone must ever keep an eye on her. But the richest lady in all the country-side might stray out and run the risk of the most dreadful death, and not a Christian soul to take care of her — though the serving-folk at Husaby were tumbling over each other and doing naught. ’ Twas like, then, the folks said sooth that said Erlend Nikulaussön was weary of his marriage already, and cared not for his wife.…","No matter how much Kristin begged the woman not to trouble herself, the farmer’s wife continued to dish up food and ale from the Christmas cask.

But the richest mistress in the parish could go out and risk the most hideous death, and not a Christian soul was looking out for her—even though the servants were falling over each other at Husaby and did no work. It must be true then what people said, that Erlend Nikulaussøn was already tired of his marriage and cared nothing for his wife."

A man must be born a master, otherwise he becomes a hard master - but if he grew up in childhood between servants and maids, then he understands much more easily that without the small people we are in many ways helpless as children every day, and that for God's guilt, but just as much for our own sake, we should serve them again with our knowledge and guard them with our chivalry.

"Og hun strevde for å stenge ute av sinnet alle bekymringer for ting som hun ikke kunne gripe inn i. Hun ville bare tenke på de saker hvor hun kunne utrette noe med sin omsut.

"Olavskirken hjemme – hun så det lune, tømmerbrune rom. Der var ikke så høyt under taket at det kunne skremme henne. Troverdig var den, reist til Guds ære av mørkt og tjæret tre, slikt som folk laftet sine setstuer og bur og fehus av. Men stokkene var hugget til smidige staver, og de var oppreist og sammenføyd til vegger i Guds hus.

The ceiling was not so high that it could frighten her. It was unassuming, built in God’s honor from dark, tarred wood, in the same way that people constructed their mountain huts and storehouses and cattle sheds. But the timbers had been cut into supple staves, and they were raised and joined to form the walls of God’s house.

"– Men han skjøv fra seg tankene og skyldte på at han måtte lyde erkebiskopen. Herr Eiliv rådet ham fra.

""But you can never hold your way, you who are descended from the daughters of he Skogheims-Gaute, whether it is good or oxygen you have set your mind to."" The salvation of the Finns was close to his heart - but they did not need a father who wrote and spoke Latin as well as his mother tongue, was taught in law no less than in Arithmetic and Algorism. He must have learned his lesson to use it, ""but it seems to me uncertain whether you have been given the gift of speaking to the poor and simple people of the north.""","— But he thrust the thought of this mission from him, on the plea that he must obey the Archbishop.

Gunnulf had acquired his learning in order to use it, hadn’t he? “But it is unclear to me whether you have the gift to talk with the poor and simple people up there in the north.”"

He himself cared for his brother’s son. Meantime Orm was speaking:","The priest thought about how she had come all the way into town. The horses that she and Orm had ridden were exhausted; during the last part of the journey they had barely been able to struggle their way through the snowdrifts. Gunnulf sent his two servant women off with Kristin to find dry clothing for her. They were his foster mother and her sister—there were no other women at the priest’s house. He attended to his nephew himself. And all the while, Orm talked steadily."
"En dag like efter helgen kom Kristin hjem fra klostret med den lille. Svennen og ternen, som hadde fulgt henne, ble med inn i stuen. Erlend var alene der inne, han lå på en av benkene. Da svennen var gått ut og kvinnene hadde lagt av seg kåpene – Kristin satt ved ilden med barnet, og ternen varmet noe olje, som de hadde fått av nonnen – spurte Erlend fra der hvor han lå, hva søster Ragnhild hadde sagt om barnet. Kristin gav korte svar mens hun løste opp reiven, til slutt svarte hun ikke.","One day just after the weekend, Kristin came home from the convent with the little one. Svennen and the bridesmaid, who had followed her, entered the living room. Erlend was alone in there, he was lying on one of the benches. When the journeyman had gone out and the women had put off their coats - Kristin was sitting by the fire with the child, and the bridesmaid was heating some oil, which they had received from the nun - Erlend asked from where he lay what Sister Ragnhild had said about the child. Kristin gave short answers while she untied the tear, in the end she did not answer.","One day just after the holy-day, Kristin came home from the cloister with the little one. The serving-man and the maid who had been with her came with her into the hall. Erlend was alone there, lying on one of the benches. After the man was gone out and the woman had laid by their cloaks — Kristin had sat down by the fire with the child, and the maid was warming some oil they had gotten from the nun — Erlend began asking, from where he lay, what Sister Ragnhild had said of the child. Kristin gave short answers, as she sat unwrapping the child’s swaddling-clothes; and at last she made no answer at all.","One day shortly after Easter, Kristin came home from the convent with the infant. The manservant and maid who had accompanied her came with her into the house. Erlend was alone, lying on one of the benches. After the manservant left, and the women had taken off their cloaks, Kristin sat near the hearth with the child while the maid heated some oil which the nun had given them. Then Erlend asked from his place on the bench what Sister Ragnhild had said about the boy. Kristin replied brusquely to his questions as she unwrapped the swaddling clothes; finally she stopped talking altogether."
"«En gang hadde vi vært nede i disse gangene hele dagen, og vi hadde lest våre bønner i huler og oratorier, der de første læresveinene til Sankt Peter og Sankt Pål hadde møttes til messe. Da gav munkene som eide den kirken hvor vi var gått ned, oss disse helligdommer. Det er litt av en slik svamp som de fromme møene brukte å tørke opp martyrblodet med så det ikke spiltes, og en fingerleddsknoke av en hellig mann, som Gud alene vet navnet på. Da lovet vi fire hinannen at vi skulle hver dag rope til denne hellige, hvis ære er ukjent for menneskene, og alltid minnes at intet i verden er verd å attrå uten hans miskunn –»","""Once we had been down in these hallways all day, and we had read our prayers in caves and oratorios, where the first disciples of St. Peter and St. Paul had met for Mass.

"«Så ringe mann er du vel ikke, Erlend, at du vil gjøre dette verre for meg. Ikke kan jeg yppe trette med deg, barna våre sover omkring oss.

"Så var hun vel lik sin mor, tenkte Kristin. Hun kunne ikke for at skinnsyken sved i henne. Mon Erlend elsket denne datteren sin slik som hennes far hadde elsket henne. Han hadde vært så vek og varm i røsten da han talte om Margret.","Then she was probably like her mother, Kristin thought. She could not because the skin disease was sweating in her. Mon Erlend loved this daughter just as her father had loved her. He had been so weak and warm in his voice when he spoke of Margret.","Then must she be like her mother, thought Kristin. In spite of herself, jealousy gnawed her heart. Did Erlend love this daughter of his as her father had loved her? His voice had been so soft and warm when he spoke of Margret.","Then she must look much like her mother, thought Kristin. And she couldn’t help the feeling of envy that burned inside her. She wondered whether Erlend loved his daughter the way her father had loved her. His voice had sounded so tender and warm when he spoke of Margret."
"Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn hadde for flere år siden kjøpt seg leiested hos predikebrødrene i Hamar, og Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter ville følge hans lik dit og bli hos det; hun skulle ha provent i en gård som munkene eide i byen. Først skulle kisten føres inn i kirken her hjemme, med store gaver til den og prestene, hans hingst skulle føres efter med rustning og våpen, og disse skulle Erlend løse ut med femogførti mark sølv. En av hans og Kristins sønner skulle vel få dette – helst det barnet som hun nu gikk med, hvis det ble sønn – kanskje ble det Lavrans i Jørundgård en gang i tiden, smilte den syke.

First the coffin was to be brought into the church here at home, with large gifts for it and the priests, his stallion was to be led after with armor and weapons, and these Erlend was to redeem with forty-five marks of silver. One of his and Kristin's sons should probably have this - preferably the child she now went with, if it became a son - maybe it was Lavrans in Jørundgård once upon a time, the sick man smiled.

But first the coffin was to be taken into the Olav’s Church here at home, with great gifts to the Church and the priests; his stallion was to be led after with his armour and weapons, and these were to be redeemed by Erlend for five-and-forty marks of silver.

"Simon hadde bodd i dalen i to år da Geirmund Hersteinssøn på Kruke beilet til Sigrid Andresdatter.

"Efter dette var Gaute hurtig frisknet til og hadde lært å gå og tale, og var nu som andre barn efter sin alder.

"Alltid hadde hun hørt sine foreldres samliv holdt frem som et foredømme på vakkert og verdig ekteskap i enighet, troskap og godvilje.

Nu var det ingen skygge mellom hennes foreldre mere. De snakket jevnt og stilt sammen, mest om dagligdagse småting, men Kristin følte at det var noe som var nytt i deres øyne og i deres stemmers klang. Hun skjønte at faren savnet sin hustru alltid når hun ikke var inne hos ham. Når han selv hadde fått overtalt henne til å gå og søke litt hvile, lå han som i en liten uro og ventet, og når hun trådte inn, var det som fred og glede fulgte med henne til den syke. En dag hørte hun at de talte om sine døde barn; de så dog lykkelige ut.

"Hun kunne ikke gjøre for det. Orm elsket hun som han skulle vært hennes eget barn; men det var umulig for henne å bli glad i Margret. Hun hadde strevet, og strevet og villet true seg til å like barnet helt fra den dagen i fjor vinter da Ulv Haldorssøn kom hjem med henne til Husaby. Hun syntes selv at det var forferdelig – kunne hun føle en slik uvilje og vrede mot en liten mø på ni år! Og hun visste godt at noe kom det av at barnet var så skremmende likt sin mor – hun skjønte seg ikke på Erlend; han var bare stolt av at den lille gullokkede, brunøyde datteren hans var så vakker, og aldri syntes barnet å vekke uhyggesminner hos faren. Det var som Erlend aldeles hadde glemt alt om disse barns mor –. Men det var ikke bare fordi Margret lignet den andre at Kristin hadde imot stedatteren. Margret tålte ikke at noen ville lære henne noe, hun var hovmodig og slem mot tjenestefolkene, usannferdig var hun også, og hun gikk sin far under øynene. Hun holdt ikke av ham slik som Orm gjorde – alltid var det for å få noe når hun smøg seg inn til Erlend med kjærtegn og kjælte. Og Erlend øste gaver ut over henne og føyde alle møens luner. Orm likte heller ikke søsteren, det hadde hun skjønt –.","She could not make up for it. Orm she loved as if he were her own child; but it was impossible for her to fall in love with Margret. She had struggled, and struggled and wanted to threaten to like the child from that day last winter when Ulv Haldorssøn came home with her to Husaby. She herself thought it was awful - could she feel such reluctance and anger towards a little girl of nine years! And she knew very well that something came of the child being so frighteningly like her mother - she did not understand Erlend; he was just proud that his little yellow-haired, brown-eyed daughter was so beautiful, and the child never seemed to evoke eerie memories in his father. It was as if Erlend had completely forgotten all about the mother of these children -. But it was not just because Margret looked like the other that Kristin was against her stepdaughter. Margret could not stand that anyone would teach her anything, she was arrogant and mean to the servants, she was also untruthful, and she went under her father's eyes. She did not like him as Orm did - it was always to get something when she snuck in to Erlend with caresses and caresses. And Erlend poured presents over her and added all the whims of the maiden. Orm did not like her sister either, she had understood -.","She could not help herself. Orm she loved like a child of her own; but ’twas not possible for her to grow to love Margret. She had striven and striven, and tried to force herself to like the child, ever since the day last winter when Ulf Haldorssön had brought her home to Husaby. She deemed herself it was a fearful thing — could she feel such misliking and wrath towards a little maid of nine years old! And well she knew that in part it was that the child was so strangely like her mother — she understood not Erlend, he showed naught but pride that his little brown-eyed daughter was so fair; never did the child seem to wake discomforting memories in her father. ’ Twas as though Erlend had forgotten all that concerned these children’s mother. — But it was not only because Margret favoured her mother that Kristin misliked her. Margret would not endure to be taught by any; she was haughty and harsh to the serving-folk; untruthful was she too, and, with her father, a flatterer. She loved him not, as did Orm — it was ever to gain something that she clung to Erlend with kisses and caresses. And Erlend poured out gifts upon her and humoured all the little maid’s whims. Orm liked not his sister either, she had seen that.…","She couldn’t help it. She loved Orm as if he were her own child; but it was impossible for her to be fond of Margret. She had tried and tried and even commanded herself to like the child, ever since that day last winter when Ulf Haldorssøn brought her home to Husaby. She thought it was dreadful; how could she feel such ill will and anger toward a little maiden only nine years old? And she knew full well that part of it was because the child looked so fearfully like her mother Eline. She couldn’t understand Erlend; he was simply proud that his little golden-haired daughter with the brown eyes was so pretty. The child never seemed to arouse any bad memories in the father. It was as if Erlend had completely forgotten the mother of these children. But it wasn’t only because Margret resembled the other woman that Kristin lacked affection for her stepdaughter. Margret would not tolerate anyone instructing her; she was arrogant and treated the servants badly. She was dishonest too, and she fawned over her father. She didn’t love him the way Orm did; she would snuggle up to Erlend with affection and caresses only because she wanted something. And Erlend showered her with gifts and gave in to the maiden’s every whim. Orm wasn’t fond of his sister, either—that much Kristin had noticed."
"«Jo,» svarte gutten. «Når far har bannet disse veke armene mine. Men jeg vet ikke om han ville like at jeg ble prest. Så er der det som du vet,» sa han sakte.","""Yes,"" replied the boy. ""When Dad has cursed these weak arms of mine. But I do not know if he would like me to become a priest. Then there is what you know, 'he said slowly.","“Yes,” answered the boy. “When father has cursed these weak arms of mine. But I know not if he would like that I should be a priest. And then there is that you wot of,” he said softly.","“Yes,” replied the boy. “Whenever Father curses these weak arms of mine. But I don’t know whether he would like me to be a priest. And then there’s that other matter, as you know,” he murmured."
"«Takk for god hilsen,» sa presten; han bøyde seg og kysset hennes kinn, slik hun visste at det var skikk i utlandene når frender møttes. «I være vel funnen, Erlends hustru!»","""Thank you for the good greeting,"" said the priest; he bent down and kissed her cheek, as she knew it was customary abroad when relatives met. ""Be well found, Erlend's wife!""","“Thanks for a fair welcome,” said the priest; and he stooped and kissed her cheek, after the fashion she knew was used in foreign lands, when kinsfolk met. “Happy be your coming hither, Erlend’s wife!”","“Thank you for your kind greeting,” said the priest. He bent down to kiss her cheek in the manner which she knew was the custom abroad, when kinsmen meet. “I hope I find you well, Erlend’s wife!”"
"I det samme skar et kvinneskrik oppe fra loftet – det måtte høres over hele gården. Erlends stemme ropte et ord eller to – så hørte hun klirring av sverd som møttes, og tråkk av føtter der oppe – så lyden av et våpen som falt i gulvet, og Margret skrek av skrekk.","At the same time, a woman's scream cut from the attic - it had to be heard all over the yard. Erlend's voice shouted a word or two - then she heard the clatter of swords meeting, and the footsteps up there - saw the sound of a weapon falling to the floor, and Margret screamed in terror.","At the same moment a woman’s shriek rang out from the loft-room — it must have been heard over the whole manor. Erlend’s voice shouted a word or two — then she heard the ring of clashing swords and the trampling of feet up above — then the noise of a weapon falling on the floor, and a shriek of terror from Margret.","Suddenly a woman’s scream rang out from the loft—loud enough to be heard all over the estate. Erlend’s voice shouted a word or two, and then Kristin heard the clang of swords striking each other and the stomp of feet overhead—then the sound of a weapon falling to the floor and Margret screaming in terror."
"«Det er så at Erlend har noe rett i dette,» sa han sakte.","""It is so that Erlend has something right in this,"" he said slowly.","“There is some truth in what Erlend says,” he said in a low voice.","“There may be some truth in what Erlend says,” he murmured."
"Han fikk ikke svar. – Like nedenfor der de stod, var der en liten frossen vanndam – Erlend tok opp en sten og kastet nedpå. Hullet var bunnfrosset, så det ble bare en liten hvit stjerne i det svarte speil. Erlend tok en sten til og kastet hardere – en til og en til, nu kastet han i fullt sinne og skulle endelig ha splintret isen til gagns. Da fikk han se sin kones ansikt – hun stod og var svart i øynene av forakt, smilte hånsk av hans barnaktighet.","He received no answer. Just below where they stood, there was a small frozen pond - Erlend picked up a rock and threw it down. The hole was bottom frozen, so there was only a small white star in the black mirror. Erlend took another stone and threw harder - one more and one more, now he threw in full anger and should finally have shattered the ice for good. Then he saw his wife's face - she stood and was black in the eyes of contempt, smiled mockingly at his childishness.","There was no answer — Right below where they stood lay a little frozen pool — Erlend took up a stone and threw it down on to the ice. The pool was frozen to the bottom, so the stone did but make a small white star on the black mirror.

Then he caught sight of his wife’s face — she stood there with eyes dark with scorn, smiling disdainfully at his childishness.","He received no answer. Right below where they stood was a small frozen pond. Erlend picked up a stone and threw it. The hollow was frozen solid so that only a tiny white star appeared on the black mirror.

But then he caught sight of his wife’s face —she stood there, her eyes dark with contempt, smiling scornfully at his childishness."
"Erlend hadde lyst til å ta sin brors hånd, men han blygdes – så drakk han ham bare til og gren litt over det dårlige øl.","Erlend wanted to take his brother's hand, but he was ashamed - so he just drank it and branched a little over the bad beer.","Erlend would fain have taken his brother’s hand, but he was ashamed — so he but drank, pulling a wry face over the bad beer.","Erlend had an urge to take his brother’s hand, but he was too embarrassed to do so; instead, he drank a toast to him, grimacing at the bad ale."
"«Bergulven fra Sil krøp under en sten og satt kyrr. Jeg mener, din værfar tok seg herberge hos prestene ved Laurentiuskirken og lot ikke høre sitt fagre mål ved ordstevnene.

Ventelig har mannen skjønt at Kristin hadde ikke så tråkig der som hun rettelig burde –»","«The rock floor from Sil crawled under a rock and sat still.

There in his keeping had he letters under the seals of Sir Erngisle and Sir Karl Turessön; if they be not yet worn to shreds, then must the parchment be tougher than the devil’s shoe-soles. This also you must know: that Lavrans gave eight marks, pure silver, to Nonneseter. Like enough the man hath got it in his head that Kristin had not so wearisome a life there as of rights she should — ”",The mountain wolf from Sil crept under a rock and sat there mutely. I mean that your father-in-law took lodgings with the priests at Saint Laurentius Church and did not let his fair voice be heard at the discussions.

You should also know that Lavrans gave eight marks of pure silver to Nonneseter. Apparently the man realized that Kristin was not as docile when she was there as she should have been.
"Så skar gutten i å skrike – han hadde ripet kinnet sitt til blods på farens bringesølje. Han ville tilbake til moren igjen, og hun ville ta ham, alt hva Erlend sa imot.","Then the boy started screaming - he had scratched his cheek to blood on his father's brooch. He wanted to go back to his mother again, and she would take him, everything Erlend said against it.","Then the boy burst out screaming — he had scratched his cheek on his father’s neck-brooch.

"Haftor skulle vel sørge for at der ble uro igjen. Erlend lo. De hadde seilt sammen innover nesten til Trjanema, og der hadde da Haftor fått tak i en terfinnkone som han flyttet med seg. Erlend snakket for ham. Han fikk huske det gjaldt at hedningene skjønte vi var herrer – og da fikk en stelle seg slik at en ikke tirret noen unødig, med det vesle folkemonn en hadde. Ikke blande seg i det om finnefolkene sloss og drepte hverandre; den gleden måtte de få ha i fred. Men være som en høk over russere og kolbjager og hva pakket het for noe. Og la kvinnfolkene deres i fred – ett var at de var hekser alle i hop – et annet at der var nok som bød seg til –. Men Godøygutten fikk stelle seg som han ville, til han lærte.","Haftor should probably make sure that there was unrest again. Erlend lo. They had sailed together inland almost to Trjanema, and there Haftor had gotten hold of a terfinn wife whom he moved with him. Erlend spoke for him. He remembered that the Gentiles understood that we were lords - and then one had to take care of oneself so that one did not tease anyone unnecessarily, with the small crowd one had. Do not interfere in it if the Finns fought and killed each other; they had to have that joy in peace. But be like a hawk over Russians and coal miners and what the pack was called for something. And leave their women alone - one was that they were all witches in a heap - another that there were enough who volunteered -. But the Godøy boy was allowed to take care of himself as he wished, until he learned.","Haftor would see to it, doubtless, that the quiet did not last long. Erlend laughed. They had sailed together eastward well-nigh as far as Trianema, and there had Haftor taken a Russian Lapp woman and had brought her back with him. Erlend had talked to him gravely: he must remember, ’twas above all needful that the heathen should understand always that we were the masters — and to that end, seeing one had but a handful of men, one must bear one so as not to stir up trouble needlessly. No making or meddling should the Lapps fight and slay each other; that pleasure one must let them enjoy in peace. But be ever ready to pounce like a hawk on Russians and Kolbjags and whatever else the pack might call themselves. And leave the womenfolk in peace — for one thing, they were witches, every one — and, for another, there were enough to proffer themselves. — But the Godöy lad must steer his course as he would; he would learn in time.","Haftor would no doubt see to it that troubles commenced soon enough. Erlend laughed. They had sailed together almost as far as Trjanema, and there Haftor had found himself a Sami woman from Kola1 whom he had taken with him. Erlend had spoken to him sternly. He had to remember that it was important for the heathens to realize that the Norwegians were the masters. And he would have to conduct himself so as not to provoke anyone unnecessarily, considering the small group of men he had with him. He shouldn’t intervene if the Finns fought and killed each other; they were to be granted that pleasure without interference. But act like a hawk over the Russians and the Kola people, or whatever that rabble was called. And leave the women alone—for one thing, they were all witches; and for another, there were plenty who would offer themselves willingly. But the Godøy youth would just have to take care of himself, until he learned."
"Gresset i engene var utvokst, og stråenes silkehaler skinte i mørknende rødt under det røde lys fra himmelen; byggen hadde skutt aks og fanget glansen på de unge, silkeblanke snerp.

"Dagen efter gikk han ut og kjøpte rike og prektige gaver til sin hustru og gutten – også til alle de koner som hadde vært hos Ramborg da hun fikk barnet.

"Kristin stod på Feginsbrekka og så kaupangen ligge under seg i gylden kveldssol.

Not a soul was on the one short street of the town as Sir Erling swiftly walked the few paces down to the king’s fortress, where he was to sleep. He looked strangely fragile and small in the moonlight, with his black cape wrapped tightly around him, shivering slightly. A couple of weary servants, who had sat up waiting for him, tumbled out of the courtyard with a lantern. The regent took the lantern and sent his men off to bed; then he shivered a little again as he climbed the stairs to his chamber up in the loft room."

"Sira Eiliv var en lav, spedlemmet mann med en liten rund mage – dette gav ham et noe lattervekkende utseende. Han var svært uanselig – folk som hadde talt med ham flere ganger, hadde vondt for å kjenne igjen presten, så alminnelig var hans ansikt. Hans hår og hud hadde samme lét – som rødgul sand – og hans runde, vannblå øyne var aldeles flate. Av vesen var han stille og forsagt, men mester Gunnulf sa at Sira Eiliv var så lærd at han hadde kunnet tatt gradene, han med, hvis han ikke hadde vært så lite frembærslig. Men meget mere enn av sin lærdom var han dog prydet med rent levnet, ydmykhet og inderlig kjærlighet til Kristus og hans kirke.","Sira Eiliv was a short, slender man with a small round belly - this gave him a somewhat ridiculous appearance. He was very insignificant - people who had talked to him several times had a hard time recognizing the priest, so common was his face. His hair and skin had the same lightness - like red-yellow sand - and his round, water-blue eyes were perfectly flat. By nature he was quiet and timid, but Master Gunnulf said that Sira Eiliv was so learned that he could have taken the degrees, he too, if he had not been so unassuming. But much more than his teachings, he was adorned with pure life, humility, and a deep love for Christ and his Church.","Sira Eiliv was a short spare-limbed man with a little round belly, and this gave him a somewhat laughable look. His presence was unremarkable — folks who had spoken with him more than once still found it hard to know the priest again, so common was his face. His hair and skin were of the same hue — like reddish-yellow sand — and his round watery-blue eyes were flat with his head. In his bearing he was quiet and retiring; but Master Gunnulf said that Sira Eiliv was so learned that he, too, could have passed through all the degrees, had he but had more forwardness. But much more than by learning was he adorned with purity of life, humility and devout love towards Christ and His Church.","Sira Eiliv was a short, slight man with a little round belly, which gave him a somewhat comical appearance. He was exceedingly nondescript; people who had spoken to him many times had trouble recognizing the priest, so ordinary was his face. His hair and complexion were the same color—like reddish-yellow sand—and his round, watery blue eyes were quite dull. In manner he was subdued and diffident, but Master Gunnulf said that Sira Eiliv was so learned that he could have attained high standing if only he had not been so unassuming. But he was far less marked by his learning than by pure living, humility, and a deep love for Christ and his Church."

"Og glad og stolt satt hun med oppfestet hår i karmstolen foran sin brudeseng da gjestene den første morgen kom opp til de unge folk. Med latter og kåt skjemt så de på at Simon la husfrulinet over sin unge kones hode. Hilsningsrop og våpenbrak stod i taket da Ramborg reiste seg og gav sin mann hånden, rank og rødkinnet under det hvite skaut.","And happy and proud, she sat with her hair upturned in the armchair in front of her bridal bed when the guests came up to the young people the first morning.

"Denne tidende skremte også Kristin forferdelig. Ulv hadde ikke bodd på Husaby det siste året, men sittet som sysselmannens lensmann, for det meste på Skjoldvirkstad, som han nu eide storparten av.

Han var glad i sønnedatteren på et vis, men det harmet ham at Simon hadde fått et horsbarn. «Har du tenkt på noe nytt gifte, Simon?»","""Yes, she who will not cause the inheritance to be divided too small after you - who will now change it,"" said Mr. Andres angrily. He loved his granddaughter in a way, but he was upset that Simon had given birth to a son. ""Have you thought of a new marriage, Simon?""","“Aye, ’twill not be through her that your heritage will be split up too small — whoever else it be that shall divide it,” said Sir Andres testily. He was fond of his grandchild in a fashion, but it angered him that Simon had a base-born child. “Have you thought upon any new match, Simon?”","“Well, that one there won’t cause your inheritance to be divided up into too many parts after you—whoever does inherit it,” said Sir Andres crossly. He was fond of his son’s daughter in his own way, but it infuriated him that Simon had a bastard child. “Have you thought of marrying anew, Simon?”"
"«Det har du også, Kristin – da du lovet å forlate djevelen og hans verk. Djevelens verk er det som begynner i søt lyst og ender med at to mennesker er som ormen og padden som stinger hverandre med tann. Det lærte Eva, at da hun ville gi sin mann og sin ætt det som Gud eide, da brakte hun dem ikke annet enn utlegd og blodskyld og døden, som kom inn i verden da bror drepte bror på hin første vesle åkeren, hvor torner og tistler grodde i røysene om de små teigene –»","""So have you, Kristin - when you promised to leave the devil and his work. The devil's work is what begins in sweet lust and ends with two people being like the worm and the toad stabbing each other with a tooth.

"«Ja, nu får I være nøyd, Simon Andressøn!

I make no doubt that now you may safely hope the day is not far off when you shall sit in peace and comfort together on your neighbouring manors — you and Erlend — and his wife and all their sons.”","He turned to Simon and said, “Well, now you must be content, Simon Andressøn! You can rest assured that the day is not far off when you will be sitting together in peace and comfort on your neighboring estates—you and Erlend—along with his wife and all their sons.”"
"Han ble så underlig led ved det hele nu efterpå. Dumt prat var det de satt der og blaffet ut – høymælte og hissige. Ketil Åsmundssøn var noe enfoldig, og mågen hans, Markus, var ikke videre klok, han heller; Olav Kyrning var en rettenkende og forstandig mann, men kortsynt – og de to prestene syntes ham heller ikke meget skjønnsomme. Nu satt de alle og hørte på Erlend og stemte i med ham – og han ble mere og mere lik seg selv som han alltid hadde brukt å være, kåt og uvøren. Nu hadde han tatt Kristins hånd og lagt over sitt kne, satt og lekte med hennes fingre – de satt slik at de rørte ved hinannen med skuldrene. Nu blusset hun skjært av rødme, hun kunne ikke ta sine øyne fra ham – da han listet en arm omkring hennes midje, sitret hun om munnen så hun hadde møye med å holde leppene lukket –.","He got so weird suffering from it all now afterwards. Stupid talk was what they sat there and hitchhiked - loud-mouthed and furious. Ketil Åsmundssøn was somewhat simple, and his brother-in-law, Markus, was no longer wise, either; Olav Kyrning was a right-thinking and sensible man, but short-sighted - and the two priests did not seem very discerning to him either. Now they all sat and listened to Erlend and agreed with him - and he became more and more like himself as he had always used to be, horny and reckless. Now he had taken Kristin's hand and put it over his knee, sat and played with her fingers - they sat so that they touched each other with their shoulders. Now she flared with redness, she could not take her eyes off him - when he wrapped an arm around her waist, she trembled around her mouth so she had trouble keeping her lips closed -.","He was heartily sick of it all now ’twas all over.

They all sat there and listened to Erlend and chimed in with him, and he grew more and more like himself as he had ever been, wild and reckless. He had taken Kristin’s hand now, and laid it over his knee, and sat playing with her fingers — they sat so that their shoulders touched. Now the deep flush showed clear through her skin, she could not take her eyes from him — when he stole an arm about her waist, her mouth trembled, so that she had much ado keeping her lips shut.…","After a while he felt so strangely weary of it all. They sat there spouting foolish chatter, in loud and heated voices. Ketil Aas mundssøn was quite a simpleton, and his brother-in-law Markus was not much more clever himself; Olav Kyrning was a right-minded and sensible man, but short-sighted. And to Simon the two priests didn’t seem any more intelligent. Now they were all sitting there listening to Erlend and agreeing with him—and he grew more and more like the man he had always been: brash and impetuous. Now he had taken Kristin’s hand and placed it on his knee; he was sitting there playing with her fingers—and they sat close together, so their shoulders touched. Now she blushed bright red; she couldn’t take her eyes off him. When he put his arm around her waist, her lips trembled and she had trouble pressing them closed."
"Kristin og Simon hadde herberge i den samme gården hvor hun en gang hadde vært hans foreldres gjest, den tiden de to var trolovet, men de bodde i et annet hus. Det var to senger i stuen, hun sov i den ene og Simon og Ulv i den andre; svennene lå i stallen.","Kristin and Simon had a hostel in the same farm where she had once been his parents' guest, at the time the two were engaged, but they lived in another house.

"Gaute gikk bakom Bjørgulf og holdt ved morens belte i ryggen. Den eldre bror begynte å mukke fordi hin tråkket ham i hælene – de gav seg til å knubbe og puffes så smått.

"Nu kom det et lettsinn over henne som hun aldri før hadde kjent. Hun ble selv kvikkere og mindre stille når hun var ute mellom folk – for hun følte at hun var svært vakker nu, og hun var helt sunn og frisk for første gang siden hun var blitt gift. Og om kvelden, når hun og Erlend lå sammen i en fremmed seng på et loft i en av storgårdene eller i en bondestue, så lo de og hvisket og gjønte med folk de hadde møtt, og tidender de hadde spurt. Erlend var mere flåset i munnen enn noensinne, og folk syntes å like ham bedre enn noen tid før.","Now a lightness came over her that she had never known before. She herself became quicker and less quiet when she was out among people - because she felt that she was very beautiful now, and she was completely healthy and well for the first time since she had been married.

Erlend was more runny in his mouth than ever, and people seemed to like him better than ever before.","But now there came on Kristin a recklessness the like of which she had never known.

"«Munan greier seg nok,» sa Erling Vidkunssøn like rolig. «De brevene han fór med, var skrevet og forseglet med Norges rikes segl – ulovlig, men det er jo ikke hans sak. Ja, det er mere – det som han var med og hengte sitt segl ved da han var vitne ved jomfru Eufemias bortfestning – men det kan vanskelig røpes uten det blir rørt ved en som vi ikke –. Sant å si, Erlend – jeg tror at Munan berger seg uten din støtte – men du kan skade deg selv –.»","""Munan is doing well enough,"" said Erling Vidkunssøn just as calmly.

"De fulgtes til messen neste morgen, som var søndag, og siden gjestet de Sira Eirik hjemme på Romundgård.

Så gikk de bortom Jørundgård.","They were accompanied to the fair the next morning, which was Sunday, and then they visited Sira Eirik at home at Romundgård.

"Erlend var underlig beveget. Han hadde hørt messen og tatt tjeneste med sine skipsfolk – for eneste gang her nord så nær som da han var på Bjarkøy. Kirken på Vargøy stod presteløs; en djakn satt igjen i borgen, og han hadde da fristet å holde rede på helligdagene for dem, men ellers hadde det vært så som så med sjelehjelpen for de norske der nord. De fikk trøste seg med at det var som å være på et slags korstog, så det ble vel ikke regnet så strengt med syndene deres.","Erlend was strangely moved. He had heard the mass and taken service with his ship's men - for the only time here in the north as close as when he was on Bjarkøy. The church on Vargøy was without a priest; a deacon was left in the castle, and he had then been tempted to keep track of the holidays for them, but otherwise it would have been so-so with the spiritual help for the Norwegians up north.

They must even comfort themselves with the thought that it was a crusade of a kind they were on, and ’twas like they would not be held to such strict account for their sins.","Erlend felt strangely moved.

They had to console themselves with the thought that they were part of a kind of crusade, and surely their sins would not be judged so severely."
"Så vakker hun var – og et vakkert barn var han, sønnen deres. Hun var alltid så søvnig om kvelden nu, Kristin – straks hun hadde lagt seg ned og fått gutten inn til seg, så sov de begge to.

"«Simon ville det ikke heller – han sier han vil ikke lønne henne slik for gaven at hun skal tynes – du får minnes Ramborg var ikke fulle seksten år enda.

You were a grown woman when you got married, my Kristin! ”","“Simon would not have it either — he says he will not repay her for the gift by letting her wear herself away.

"Erlend ønsket det slik. Og hun var redd for de tanker som kunne komme opp i henne hvis hun skulle se sine sønner om seg, høre deres spørsmål og friste å sette dem inn i sakene. Hun kjempet for å skyve unna alle tanker og minner om de årene hun hadde vært gift på Husaby. Så rike hadde de vært at nu syntes de henne som en stor ro – som det er en slags ro over havet i bølgegang hvis en ser det høyt nok oppe fra en berghammer. Bårene som jager hverandre, er som evindelige og ens; slik hadde livet bølget gjennom hennes sinn i disse rommelige år.","Erlend wanted it that way.

She struggled to push away all thoughts and memories of the years she had been married at Husaby. They had been so rich that now they seemed to her like a great calm - like a kind of calm over the sea in waves if one sees it high enough up from a rock hammer. The stretchers that chase one another are as eternal and alike; so life had rippled through her mind during those spacious years.","Erlend wished it should be so. And Kristin was afraid of the thoughts that might arise in her if she were to see her sons about her, listen to their questions, and try to make things clear to them. She strove to thrust away from her all thoughts of her wedded years at Husaby. So rich had been those years that they seemed to her now to have been one great calm — even as there seems a sort of calm on a billowy sea when one stands high enough above it on a great cliff. The waves that chase each other seem everlasting and unchanging — even so had life billowed through her soul in those spacious years.","This was in accordance with Erlend’s wishes. And she was afraid of the thoughts that might rise up in her mind if she should see her sons around her, hear their questions, and try to explain matters to them.

The swells that surge after each other seem eternal, melding into one; that was the way life had rippled through her soul during that vast span of years."
"«Ja,» svarte mannen. «Før i tiden var jeg ofte inne og så til dem i Østerdalen, der de er.»","""Yes,"" replied the man. ""In the past, I was often inside and looked at them in Østerdalen, where they are.""","“Aye,” said the man. “Before, I would often go inland to Österdal, where they are, to see them.”","“Yes,” said her husband. “In the past I often went over to see them in Østerdal, where they are living.”"

"Kristins nål fløy og fløy, og hun tenkte på foreldrene og hjemmet på Jørundgård. Nu da allting var minner, syntes hun at hun øynet så meget som hun ikke hadde sett da hun gikk midt i det, tok som noe selvgitt farens ømhet og vern og den tause, tungsindige mors stadige og stille omsut og arbeid. Hun tenkte på sine egne barn – hun hadde dem kjærere enn blodet i sitt eget hjerte, de var ikke ute av hennes sinn noen våken stund. Enda der var mangt og meget i hugen hennes som hun grunnet mer over – barna elsket hun uten å gruble noe ved det. Selv hadde hun aldri, mens hun var hjemme, tenkt annet enn at foreldrenes hele liv og all deres id og gjerning var for henne og søstrene hennes. Nu syntes hun å skjønne, mellom disse to, som i ungdommen var blitt gitt sammen av sine fedre, nesten uspurt, hadde der runnet stride strømmer av sorg og av glede – hun visste ingenting om det andre enn at de hadde fulgtes ad ut av hennes liv. Nu skjønte hun at disse to menneskers liv hadde rommet meget annet enn kjærlighet til barna – og dog hadde den kjærlighet vært sterk og vid og bunnløst dyp, mens hennes gjenkjærlighet hadde vært svak og tankeløs og selvsyk, også den gang i hennes barndom da de to var hele verden for barnet. Hun syntes å se seg selv stå langt, langt borte – så liten på den avstand av tid og vei; hun stod under flommen av sollys som silte ned gjennom ljoren i den gamle årestuen hjemme, vinterstuen fra hennes barndom. Foreldrene stod litt tilbake i skyggen, de ruvet så store som de hadde gjort for hennes syn da hun var liten, og de smilte til henne – slik som hun nu selv visste en smiler når et lite barn kommer og skyver til side tunge og vanskelige tanker.","Kristin's needle flew and flew, and she thought of her parents and the home at Jørundgård. Now that everything was memorable, she thought she saw as much as she had not seen when she walked in the middle of it, took for granted her father's tenderness and protection and the silent, melancholy mother's constant and quiet turnover and work. She thought of her own children - she had them dearer than the blood in her own heart, they were not out of her mind any awake moment. Even there was much and much in her mind that she pondered more over - the children she loved without thinking about it. Even when she was at home, she had never thought other than that her parents' whole life and all their id and deeds were for her and her sisters. Now she seemed to understand, between these two, who in their youth had been given together by their fathers, almost unspoken, there had flowed conflicting currents of sorrow and of joy - she knew nothing about it other than that they had been followed out by her life. Now she realized that the lives of these two people had contained much more than love for the children - and yet that love had been strong and wide and bottomless deep, while her re-love had been weak and thoughtless and selfish, even then in her childhood when the two was the whole world for the child. She seemed to see herself standing far, far away - so small at that distance of time and way; she stood under the flood of sunlight sifting down through the light in the old living room at home, the winter room from her childhood. Her parents stood a little back in the shadows, they towered as big as they had done for her sight when she was little, and they smiled at her - as she now knew herself a smile when a small child comes and pushes aside heavy and difficult thoughts .","Kristin’s needle flew and flew, and she thought on her parents and their home at Jörundgaard.

Now she understood that this man’s and woman’s lives had held much beside their love for their children — and yet that love had been strong and wide and unfathomably deep, while the love she gave them back had been weak and thoughtless and self-seeking, even when, in her childhood, those two had been her whole world.

But she had heard about children who were born with a pelt where they should have had a face, with their heads turned around backwards, or their toes where their heels should have been. And she pictured Svein, who was purple over half his face because his mother had inadvertently looked at a fire.2"
"«Nu får du da bruke det vettet du har, Kristin.» Heftigheten tok aldeles makten fra ham der han stod oppskremt og naken og frysende i det nimørke rom med en hikstende unge på armen. «Slutt skal det være, sier jeg, med dette – hva har du barnejentene til – ungene får sove med dem, du står ikke ut med dette –»","""Now you can use the wisdom you have, Kristin.""

You cannot go on thus.”","“It’s time for you to use what good sense you have, Kristin.” His fury robbed him of all power as he stood there, startled and naked and freezing in the pitch-dark room with a sobbing child in his arms. “There has to be an end to this, I tell you—what do you have nursemaids for? The children will sleep with them; you can’t keep on this way.”"
"Å, faren var det verst å tenke på –. Faren, som ikke hadde sagt henne ett umildt ord da han kom hit i vår –.","Oh, the father was the worst thing to think about -. The father, who had not said a word to her when he came here this spring -.","Lord, hearken to my prayer for this folk, which I held so dear that I would rather suffer outlawry and need and hatred and death, than that man or maid should grow up in Norway and not know that Thou diedst to save all sinners.","Oh, the worst was thinking about her father.

"«Om du har gjort dette,» sa presten stille, «– budt Gud et sønderknust hjerte og fått fullt forlik med ham, du – så skjønner du vel at sporene av synden din her på jorden må du enda streve i år og dag med å slette ut. Det voldte du henne som nu er hustruen din, da du drog henne ned først i urent levnet og siden i manndrap – det kan ikke du bedre for henne, det kan alene Gud. Be at han holder sin hånd over henne på denne ferden, hvor ikke du kan følge med og verne henne.

"Hun het Audfinna Audunsdatter og var fra Updal, sa hun. Da hun merket at det hygget gjesten, tok hun til å fortelle om hjemmet sitt og om sin bygd. Og før Kristin visste ordet av det, hadde hun fått munnen løst – hun snakket om sitt hjem og om sine foreldre og om hjembygden. Audfinna skjønte at den unge konens hjerte var nær ved å briste av hjemlengsel – så listet og lokket hun Kristin til å bli ved. Og het og ør av det sterke øl talte Kristin til hun lo og gråt på en gang. Alt som hun fåfengt hadde fristet å hulke fra seg i de ensomme kveldsstundene på Husaby, det løstes nu litt om senn mens hun fikk fortelle for denne snille bondehustruen.","Her name was Audfinna Audunsdatter and she was from Updal, she said. When she noticed that the guest was enjoying herself, she began to tell about her home and her village. And before Kristin knew it, she had her mouth shut - she was talking about her home and her parents and her hometown. Audfinna realized that the young wife's heart was about to burst with homesickness - so she listed and enticed Kristin to stay. And Kristin spoke hot and hot of the strong beer until she laughed and cried at once. Everything that she had tried in vain to sob in the lonely evening hours at Husaby, it was now resolved a little at a time while she had to tell this kind peasant wife.","Her name was Audfinna Andunsdatter, and she was from Updal, she said. When she marked that it cheered her guest, she took to telling of her home and her country. And before Kristin was aware, her tongue too was loosed — and she was talking of her home and her parents and her own country-side. Audfinna saw well that the young wife’s heart was near breaking with home-sickness — so she tempted and beguiled Kristin into going on. And Kristin, hot and dizzy with the strong ale, went on talking till she was laughing and crying in the same breath. All that she had tried in vain to sob away from her heart in the lonesome evening hours at Husaby, seemed to melt now little by little as she told her tale to this kind peasant wife.","Her name was Audfinna Andunsdatter, and she was from Updal, she said.

Hot and giddy from the ale, Kristin talked until she was laughing and crying at the same time. All that she had futilely tried to sob out of her heart during the lonely evening hours at Husaby, now was gradually released as she spoke to this kind farmer’s wife."
"Alle hadde skjønt hvordan dette var gått til – men Munan Bårdssøn og hans bror fikk dog disse to i viet jord – det kunne være stimenn, ble det sagt, enda kisten med Bjørns og Åshilds gods var urørt.

"Hun var blitt så vakker at Erlend mistet pusten da han så henne. Men hun var nok forandret. Det pikeaktige som var blitt ved å være over henne efter hver barnsseng hun var kommet over – det spede og skrøpelige nonnelignende under hustrulinet – det var nu borte.

Hoften rundet seg mere bredt og mykt under nøklebeltet og den forgylte slire med saks og kniv.

The girlishness that had remained over her after every cot she had come across - the small and frail nun-like under his wife's line - was now gone. She was a young, flourishing wife and mother. Her cheeks were round and fresh red between the white flaps of the scarf, her bosom high and firm for chains and brooches to sparkle on. The hip rounded more broadly and softly under the key belt and the gilded sheath with scissors and knife.

She was a young, blooming wife and mother. Her cheeks were round and freshly red between the white lappets of her coif; her bosom full and firm for chains and brooches to glitter on. Her thighs were rounder and fuller under the key-belt and the gilded case that held knife and scissors. Yes, yes — she had but grown more fair — she looked not now as though they could blow her away from him to heaven so lightly as before. Even the long narrow hands were grown fuller and more white.","She had grown so beautiful that it took Erlend’s breath away when he saw her. But she had changed.

Her hips were rounder and wider, soft beneath the belt bearing her ring of keys and the gilded sheath holding her scissors and knife. Oh yes, she had grown even more lovely. She didn’t look as if she might be easily carried off to heaven as she had before. Even her large, slender hands had grown fuller and whiter."

"Erlend bråstanset, rynket brynene – så snudde han seg leende til den som hadde talt:","Erlend stopped abruptly, frowned - then he turned laughing to the one who had spoken:","Erlend stopped short and knit his brows, then turned to the man who had spoken.","Erlend came to an abrupt halt and frowned—then he turned to face the man who had spoken and said with a laugh, “Where were you out drinking last night, Jon my friend, since your head is so tender?”"
"Lavrans syntes ikke å like spøken, han sa skarpt at nu skulle hun holde munn, gå bort og legge seg i foreldrenes seng.

"«Kristin,» sa presten. «Du snakker over deg. Ikke var det du som drev den arme konen i døden. Erlend kunne ikke holdt det ordet han hadde gitt henne da han var ung og lite kjente til lov og rett. Aldri kunne han ha levd med henne uten synd. Og hun selv hadde latt seg lokke av en annen, og Erlend ville gifte henne med ham da han spurte det. Ikke voldte dere at hun tok sitt eget liv –»","""Kristin,"" said the priest. 'You're talking about yourself. It was not you who drove the poor wife to death. Erlend could not keep the word he had given her when he was young and little known of law and order. He could never have lived with her without sin. And she herself had been lured by another, and Erlend wanted to marry her to him when he asked. Did not cause you to take her own life - »","“Kristin,” said the priest, “you speak you know not what. ’ Twas not you that drove that hapless woman to her death. Erlend could not keep the word he had pledged her when he was young and knew little of law or of right. Never could he have lived with her but in sin. And she had let herself be led astray by another too, and Erlend would have wed her to that other when he heard it. ’ Twas not your doing that she took her life — ”","“Kristin,” said the priest, “you’ve lost your senses. You weren’t the one who drove that poor woman to her death. Erlend couldn’t keep the promise that he’d given her when he was young and knew little of law and justice. He could never have lived with her without sin. And she herself allowed another man to seduce her, and Erlend wanted to marry her to him when he heard of it. The two of you were not to blame for her taking her own life.”"
"Erlend spurte hvem de andre barna monne være. Lavrans svarte at gutten var Håvard Trondssøn, yngste barnet på Sundbu. Det ble så langsomt for ham der borte mellom de voksne søsken, så han hadde funnet på nu i julen at han ville være med sin farsøster hjem. Møen var Helga Rolvsdatter – frendene hadde måttet flytte barna fra Blakarsarv med seg da de drog hjem efter gravølet; det var synd for dem at de skulle se sin far slik som han var. Det var hygge for Ramborg at hun hadde fått disse fostersøsken. «Vi tar til å eldes nu, Ragnfrid og jeg,» sa Lavrans. «Og hun er mere kåt og leken hun her enn Kristin var.» Han strøk datteren over det krøllete håret.","Erlend asked who the other children might be. Lavrans replied that the boy was Håvard Trondssøn, the youngest child at Sundbu. It was so slow for him over there between the older siblings, so he had figured out this Christmas that he wanted to be home with his father's sister. The maid was Helga Rolvsdatter - the relatives had had to move the children from Blakarsarv with them when they went home after the funeral; it was a pity for them to see their father as he was. It was a pleasure for Ramborg that she had had these foster siblings. ""We're getting older now, Ragnfrid and I,"" Lavrans said. ""And she's more horny and playful here than Kristin was."" He stroked his daughter's curly hair.","Erlend asked who the other children might be. Lavrans answered that the boy was Haavard Trondssön, the youngest of the Sundbu children. ’ Twas dull for him there amid his grown-up brothers and sisters; and last Yule he had set his heart on coming home with Ragnfrid, his father’s sister. The little maid was Helga Rolfsdatter of Blakarsarv — there had been naught for it but for the kinsfolk to take the children away home with them after the grave-ale there — ’twere pity they should see their father as he was now. For Ramborg it was a happy thing to have this foster-brother and sister. “We begin to grow old now, Ragnfrid and I,” said Lavrans, “and this little one is more frolicsome and fond of play than Kristin was” — he stroked his daughter’s curly hair.","Erlend asked who the other children were. Lavrans told him the boy was Haavard Trondssøn, the youngest child at Sundbu. It was so tedious for him over there among his grown-up siblings; at Christmastime he had decided to go home with his aunt. The maiden was Helga Rolvsdatter. Her kinsmen had been forced to take the children from Blakarsarv home with them after the funeral; it wasn’t good for them to see their father the way he was now. And it was nice for Ramborg that she had these foster siblings. “We’re getting old now, Ragnfrid and I,” said Lavrans. “And she’s more wild and playful, this one here, than Kristin was.” He stroked his daughter’s curly hair."
Uvilkårlig kastet hun et blikk opp dit hvor luken for gluggen i Margrets bur slo for blåsten. Hun kunne ikke skjelne noe ansikt der oppe – men det var også meget mørkt.,Involuntarily she glanced up to where the hatch for the window in Margret's cage was blowing.

"Kristin var langt inne i søvnørsken igjen da hun kjente at Erlend satte seg opp i sengen. Halvvåken spurte hun hva det var – han hysset på henne med en stemme som hun ikke kjente. Lydløst gled han ut av sengen, hun skjønte at han tok på seg noen plagg, men da hun reiste seg på albuen, klemte han henne ned i putene igjen med den ene hånd mens han bøyde seg inn og tok sitt sverd som hang over hodegjerdet.","Kristin was deep in her sleep again when she felt Erlend sit up in bed. Half-awake, she asked what it was - he hugged her with a voice she did not recognize. Silently he slipped out of bed, she realized that he was wearing some clothes, but when she got up on her elbow, he squeezed her down into the pillows again with one hand while he bent in and took his sword that hung over the headboard.","Kristin had sunk again in deep drowsiness, when, of a sudden, she felt Erlend sit upright in the bed. Half awake, she asked what it was — he bade her hush, in a voice she did not know. Without a sound he slipped out of the bed; she marked that he was putting on some pieces of clothing, but when she raised herself on her elbow, he pressed her down again on the cushions with one hand while he leant in above her and took his sword, that hung above the bed-head.","Kristin had fallen into a deep slumber again when she suddenly realized that Erlend was sitting up in bed. Only half awake, she asked what was wrong. He hushed her in a voice that she didn’t recognize. Soundlessly he slipped out of bed, and she saw that he was pulling on a few clothes. When she propped herself up on one elbow, he pressed her back against the pillows with one hand as he bent over her and took down his sword, which hung over the headboard."
"Da rev en mann døren opp, ropte inn om de hadde sett noe til husfruen – ble vár henne og fór ut igjen. Straks efter dukket Erlends lange skikkelse inn under dørkarmen. Han satte fra seg øksen som han bar, ség baklengs inn mot veggen – han måtte støtte med hendene bak seg, og han kunne ikke snakke.","Then a man tore the door open, called in if they had seen anything to the housewife - got her and went out again. Immediately after, Erlend's long figure appeared under the door frame. He put down the ax he was carrying, leaned back against the wall - he had to support with his hands behind him, and he could not speak.","Suddenly the door was flung open, and a man shouted in to ask if they had seen aught of the mistress — then caught sight of her sitting there and rushed out again. A minute after, Erlend’s long shape came stooping low through the doorway. He set from him the axe he bore, and staggered back against the wall — he had to prop himself with hands thrust behind him, and he could not speak.","Then a man tore open the door, shouting: Had they seen any sign of the mistress? Then he noticed her and went back outside. A moment later Erlend’s tall figure ducked through the doorway. He set down the axe he was carrying and leaned back against the wall.

Den andre svarte ikke; da tok han på igjen.,The other did not answer; then he took on again.,The other made no answer; and he went on again:,The other man did not reply. Then Erlend spoke again.
"Han skjøv henne blidt ut av døren, stengte den og stod litt. Så ravet han de skrittene bort til benken, sank ned og satt med nakken inn mot veggstokkene og oppvendt, forvridd ansikt. Han knuget av all makt en hånd inn mot hjertestedet.","He gently pushed her out of the door, closed it and stood for a while. Then he wandered those steps to the bench, sank down and sat with his neck against the logs and his face turned upside down. He squeezed with all his might a hand towards the heart.","He pushed her gently out of the door, closed it behind her, and stood still a space.

"Neste dag, da han kom frem med det, svarte herr Erling på det nærmeste som Simon hadde ventet. Han sa at godvillig hadde kong Magnus aldri hørt på ham, men han hadde skjønt, fra den stund at Magnus Eirikssøn ble gammel nok til å mene noe, hadde han ment at Erling Vidkunssøn skulle ikke få ha noe å si hos ham når han en gang ble myndig. Og siden denne tvist mellom ham og hans venner på den ene siden og kongen på den annen var blitt forlikt, hadde han hverken hørt eller spurt til kongen og kongens venner. Om han talte Erlends sak for kong Magnus, så ville det neppe gavne mannen stort. Men han visste vel nok at mange her i landet trodde han hadde stått bak Erlends forehavende på noe vis. Simon fikk tro ham eller ikke tro ham – hverken han eller hans venner hadde kjent noe til at dette var i gjære. Men var denne saken blitt røpet på en annen måte, eller hadde disse eventyrlystne unge halsene ført frem sitt vågestykke og mislykkes – så ville han trådt frem og fristet å megle. Men slik som det var gått, så syntes han ikke at noen med rimelighet kunne kreve han skulle stå opp og styrke folks mistanke om at han hadde spilt to spill.","The next day, when he came forward with it, Mr. Erling answered as soon as Simon had expected. He said that King Magnus had never listened to him kindly, but he had understood, from the moment that Magnus Eiriksson became old enough to mean something, he had meant that Erling Vidkunsson should not have anything to say to him once he became an adult. And since this dispute between him and his friends on the one hand and the king on the other had been settled, he had neither heard nor asked the king and the king's friends. If he spoke Erlend's case for King Magnus, it would hardly benefit the man much. But he probably knew that many in this country thought he had been behind Erlend's endeavors in some way. Simon was allowed to believe him or not to believe him - neither he nor his friends had known anything about this being brewing. But if this case had been revealed in another way, or had these adventurous young throats brought forward his daring piece and failed - then he would have stepped forward and tempted to mediate. But as it was, he did not think that anyone could reasonably demand that he stand up and strengthen people's suspicion that he had played two games.","The next day, when he broached the matter, Sir Erling’s answer was much what Simon had looked for. He said that King Magnus had never hearkened to him willingly, and he had seen, from the time Magnus Eirikssön was old enough to have a will of his own, that his will had been that Erling Vidkunssön should have naught to say in his affairs when once he was of age. And since the quarrel between him and his friends on the one side, and the King on the other, had been made up, he had heard, and tried to hear, naught of the King or the King’s friends. If he pleaded Erlend’s cause with King Magnus, it would scarce avail the man much. He knew well enough that many in this land believed that he had been in some wise at the bottom of Erlend’s undertaking. But, whether Simon believed him or not, neither he nor his friends had known aught of what was hatching. Had this matter come to light in another fashion, or had these venturesome young dare-devils risked their throw and failed, then would he have stepped in and striven to make their peace. But as things had gone, he deemed not that any could justly crave of him that he should come forward and thereby strengthen all men’s suspicion that he had played a double game.","The next day, when he finally spoke of it, Sir Erling replied in much the way Simon had expected. He said that King Magnus had never willingly listened to him, but he had noticed that the moment Magnus Eirikssøn became old enough to have an opinion, it had been his view that Erling Vidkunssøn wouldn’t have anything more to say to him after he came of age. And ever since the dispute had been settled between Erling and his friends on one side and the king on the other, he had neither heard from nor spoken to the king or the king’s friends. If he spoke on Erlend’s behalf to King Magnus, it would be of little benefit to the man. And he was aware that many people in the country thought he had been behind Erlend’s undertaking in some way. Simon could believe him or not, but neither he nor his friends had known anything about what was being planned. But if this matter had come to light in a different fashion, or if these adventuresome young daredevils had carried through their plot and failed—then he might have stepped forward and tried to mediate. But because of the way things had gone, he didn’t think anyone could reasonably demand him to stand up and reinforce the people’s suspicions that he had been playing two games."
"«Gå ut, du Signe,» sa Erlend til piken. Han var blitt rød i pannen, han vendte seg til hustruen: «Jeg skjønner hva du sikter til. Om det vil jeg nu ikke snakke med deg så din terne hører på – selv om du er så god venn med henne at du regner det for intet om hun er hos når du ypper trette med din husbond og sier at jeg taler usant –»","""Go out, you Signe,"" Erlend said to the girl. He had turned red in the forehead, he turned to his wife: ""I understand what you mean. I do not want to talk to you about it now, so your sister listens - even if you are such a good friend of her that you do not count on it if she is with you when you get tired with your husband and say that I am telling a lie - »","“Go out, Signe,” said Erlend to the maid. He had flushed to the forehead — now he turned to his wife. “I understand what you would speak of. Of that matter I would not speak to you in your serving-maid’s hearing — even if you are such good friends with her that you count it for nothing she should be by when you pick a quarrel with your husband, and tell me I speak untrue — ”","“Leave us now, Signe,” said Erlend to the maid. His brow was flushed red as he turned to his wife. “I know what you’re referring to. But I won’t speak to you about that as long as your maid might hear me— even though you’re such good friends with her that you think it a small matter for her to be present when you start a quarrel with your husband and say I’m not speaking the truth.”"
«Kristin – hva er det?» spurte han redd.,"""Kristin - what is it?"" he asked scared.",“Kristin — what is it?” he asked fearfully.,“Kristin—what is it?” Erlend asked in fear.
"Et øyeblikk stod de og torde ikke se på hverandre. Så kastet Erling Vidkunssøn den siste moseballen, snudde seg og gikk ut i regnet. Simon ble stående igjen – men da den andre var et stykke inne i tåken, stanset han og vinket utålmodig.","For a moment they stood and did not dare look at each other. Then Erling Vidkunssøn threw the last moss ball, turned around and went out into the rain. Simon remained standing - but when the other was some distance inside the fog, he stopped and waved impatiently.","For a moment they stood, not venturing to look at each other. Then Erling Vidkunssön threw away the last ball of moss he had gathered, turned, and went out into the rain. Simon was left standing alone — but when the other was some way off in the mist, he stopped and beckoned impatiently.","For a moment they stood there, not daring to look at each other.

Kristin sa sakte:,Kristin said slowly:,Kristin said low:,"Kristin said quietly, “It seems to me that it would be easier to watch over and pray for those who are asleep out in the world than to struggle with one’s own sins.”"
"Da gjorde han tre ganger korstegn over henne. Så bød han Orm god natt og gikk inn i kleven, hvor han sov.","Then he crucified her three times. Then he bade Orm good night and went into the cleft, where he slept.","Then he made the sign of the cross over her thrice, and, bidding Orm good-night, went into the closet where he slept.",He made the sign of the cross over her three times. He bade Orm good night and went into the alcove where he slept.
"«Jeg mener de har holdt sin tro til hinannen vakkert nok –. Men du snakker, du, som himmelbrever datt ned i kåpeskjøtet ditt hver dag – det er vel derfor du dømmer at du tør være så djerv du byr til å bites med kirkens tignarmenn –»","""I think they have kept their faith in each other beautiful enough. But you talk, you who as heavenly letters fell into your cloak every day - that's probably why you judge that you dare to be so bold you offer to bite with the church's nobles - »","“Methinks they have kept faith with each other fairly enough. — But, as for you, you talk as if letters from Heaven dropped every day into your lap — ’tis that, maybe, makes you so bold to fight with the Lords of the Church.”",“I think they’ve been admirably loyal toward each other. But you speak as if letters from Christ himself were floating down into the lap of your robe every day —that must be why you’ve decided that you dare to be so bold as to provoke a fight with the highest authorities of the Church.”
"«Ja.» Erlend rystet på hodet. «De sitter i tre timer, hun og Sira Eiliv, og snakker om det at han er blitt rød hist og her, og for hver tann han får, så tykkes det dem at her er hendt et stort jærtegn. Jeg har aldri visst annet enn at barn får gjerne tenner, og det ville vært mere å undres over skulle Nåkkve vår ingen få –»","""Yes."" Erlend shook his head. ""They sit for three hours, she and Sira Eiliv, and talk about the fact that he has turned red here and there, and for every tooth he gets, they think that a big sign has happened here. I have never known anything other than that children like to get teeth, and it would be more to wonder if Nåkkve would not get ours - »","“Aye,” Erlend shook his head. “They will sit for three hours — she and Sira Eiliv — and talk of it, should a little rash show on him here or there; and for every tooth he cuts, it seems to them a great miracle has come to pass. I have never known aught else but that children were apt to cut teeth; and methinks it had been a greater marvel if our Naakkve had had none.” * See Note 6. * See Note 7. * Margygren = the Sea-Ogress. * See Note 8. * Bergen.","Erlend shook his head. “They can sit there for three hours—Kristin and Sira Eiliv—talking about a rash he has here or there; and for every tooth he gets, they seem to think a great miracle has occurred. I’ve never heard otherwise but that all children get teeth. And it would be more wondrous if our Naakkve should have none.”"
"«Ja, dette snakket har visst vart for lenge for eder, husfrue,» begynte herr Erling unnskyldende, men Kristin svarte med et smil:","""Yes, this talk must have been too long for you, housewife,"" Mr. Erling began apologetically, but Kristin replied with a smile:","“Aye, this talk has run on too long for you, I fear, mistress,” began Eir Erling, in excuse; but Kristin answered with a smile:","“All this talk has no doubt gone on much too long for you, mistress,” began Sir Erling contritely, but Kristin answered with a smile."
"«Jeg sa det vel mest for å trøste meg selv, Orm,» sa Kristin stille. «Jeg ville gjerne vært med til messen, jeg òg –»","""I probably said it mostly to comfort myself, Orm,"" Kristin said quietly. ""I would like to attend the fair, I too -""","“Methinks I said it most to comfort my own self, Orm,” said Kristin, quietly. “I too had been fain to go with them to the mass.”","“I told the story mostly to comfort myself, Orm,” said Kristin quietly. “I would have liked to go to mass too.”"
Kristin nikket likesæl.,Kristin nodded as well.,Kristin nodded listlessly.,Kristin nodded indifferently.
"Nei, hun kjente seg så utrygg. Erlend hadde gode inntekter nu i sysselen, men så fór han også frem med enda større stas, folkehold og høvdingslig følge. Og så var han begynt å holde henne aldeles utenfor alt i sitt liv som ikke rørte ved deres næreste fellesskap. Hun skjønte at han ville ikke ha hennes vaktsomme øyne over sin ferd. Med menn snakket han villig nok om alt som han hadde sett og opplevd nordpå – til henne nevnte han det aldri. Og der var andre ting. Han hadde møtt fru Ingebjørg, kongsmoren, og herr Knut Porse noen ganger i disse årene; det hadde aldri truffet seg slik at hun hadde kunnet være med. Nu var herr Knut en hertug i Danmark, og kong Håkons datter hadde bundet seg til ham i ekteskap. Det hadde vakt bitter harme i mange norske menns sinn; det var blitt tatt skritt mot fruen som Kristin ikke skjønte. Og biskopen i Bjørgvin hadde hemmelig sendt noen kister til Husaby; de var nu om bord i Margygren, og skipet lå ute ved Neset. Erlend hadde fått brevskaper og ville seile til Danmark utpå sommeren. Han ville endelig ha henne med – men hun satte seg imot. Hun skjønte at Erlend ferdedes mellom disse storfolk som likemann og kjærfrende, og hun engstet seg; det var utrygt med en så uforsiktig mann som Erlend var. Men hun dristet seg ikke til å fare med – ikke kom hun til å kunne råde ham noe der, og hun ville ikke utsette seg for å komme i lag med folk som ikke hun, en jevn husfrue, kunne hevde seg mellom. Og så var hun redd sjøen – sjøsyken stod for henne som det som var verre enn den hardeste barnefødsel.","No, she felt so insecure. Erlend now had a good income in the business, but then he also advanced with even greater stasis, people and chiefs. And then he had begun to keep her completely out of everything in his life that did not touch their closest community. She realized that he did not want her watchful eyes on his journey. With men he spoke willingly enough about everything he had seen and experienced in the north - to her he never mentioned it. And there were other things. He had met Mrs. Ingebjørg, the king's mother, and Mr. Knut Porse a few times during these years; it had never happened so that she could have joined. Now Mr. Knut was a duke in Denmark, and King Håkon's daughter had bound herself to him in marriage. It had aroused bitter resentment in the minds of many Norwegian men; steps had been taken against the lady that Kristin did not understand. And the bishop of Bjørgvin had secretly sent some coffins to Husaby; they were now on board Margygren, and the ship was out at Neset. Erlend had received letter cabinets and wanted to sail to Denmark towards the end of the summer. He finally wanted her with him - but she resisted. She realized that Erlend was traveling between these great people as an equal and a lover, and she was anxious; it was insecure with such a careless man as Erlend was. But she did not dare to go with it - she would not be able to advise him anything there, and she would not expose herself to getting along with people whom she, an even housewife, could not assert herself between. And then she was afraid of the sea - the seasickness stood for her as what was worse than the hardest childbirth.","But no — she felt so unsafe. Erlend had good incomings from his Wardenship, but he was living now with yet more pomp, with a greater household and the following of a great chief. And he had begun to keep her quite outside all things in his life that touched not their most private life together. She understood that he would not have her heedful eyes watching his doings. With men he would talk willingly enough of all he had seen and gone through in the north — but to her he never named it. And there were other things. He had met Lady Ingebjörg, the King’s mother, and Sir Knut Porse more than once in these years; it had never so chanced at these times that she could be with him. Sir Knut was now a Duke in Denmark, and King Haakon’s daughter had bound her to him in wedlock. The marriage had waked bitter wrath in many Norsemen’s minds; and steps — Kristin understood not what they were — had been taken against the lady. But the Bishop of Björgvin had sent certain chests to Husaby; they were now on board Margygren, and the ship lay out at Ness. Erlend had been given letters and was to sail for Denmark later in the summer. He pressed her to go with him — but she set herself against it. She knew that Erlend moved among these great folk as their equal and dear kinsman, and she feared what might come of it; ’twas unsafe with so rash a man as Erlend. But she could not pluck up heart to go with him — never could she get him to hearken to counsel there, and she was loath to adventure herself in company with folks among whom she, a plain housewife, could scarce hold her own. And then there was the terror of the sea — sea-sickness to her was a thing worse than the hardest childbed.","No, she felt so uneasy. Erlend now had a good income from his position as sheriff, but he also lived with greater ostentation, with more servants and an entourage befitting a chieftain. And he had begun to shut her out of everything that didn’t concern their domestic life together. She realized that he didn’t want to have her watchful eyes on what he was doing. With other men he would talk willingly about all he had seen and experienced up north—to her he never said a word. And there were other things as well. He had met with Lady Ingebjørg, the king’s mother, and Sir Knut Porse several times over the past few years. But it had never been opportune for Kristin to accompany him. Now Sir Knut was a duke in Denmark, and King Haakon’s daughter had bound herself to him in marriage. This had aroused bitter indignation in the souls of many Norwegian men; measures had been taken against the king’s mother which Kristin did not understand. And the bishop in Bjørgvin had secretly sent several chests to Husaby. They were now on board Margygren, and the ship was anchored at Nes. Erlend had been given boxes of letters and was to sail to Denmark later in the summer. He wanted Kristin to go along with him, but she refused. She could see that Erlend moved among these noble people as an equal and a dear kinsman, and this worried her—it wasn’t safe with such an impetuous man as Erlend. But she didn’t dare travel with him; she wouldn’t be able to advise him in these matters, and she didn’t want to run the risk of consorting with people among whom she, a simple wife, could not assert herself. And she was also afraid of the sea. For her, seasickness was worse than the most difficult childbirth."

With much pains and labour he managed to bear the other, a big, tall man, over to the bed. A stroke it was not — but Lavrans lay there, his lips blue and white, with slack, strengthless limbs.

She is mostly like one of the ladies it is written about in the holy sagas that King Håkon threatened us to sit and hear the priest read from, do you remember, the time we were groomsmen? Here is very different at Husaby now than when you last visited me, Erling.

"NOE AV DET FØRSTE som Kristin hadde sett hjemme, var at alle de gamle karlhodene som hadde stått over vindskikryssene i husgavlene, var borte. I stedet var der kommet spir med løvverk og fugler og en forgylt værfløy på nyeburet. Også de gamle høysetesstolpene i årestuen var blitt byttet om med nye. De gamle hadde vært skåret ut som to menn, stygge nok, men de hadde nu visst vært der siden huset ble bygget, og de hadde brukt å smøre dem med fett og toe dem med øl til høytidene. På de nye stolpene hadde faren skåret ut to menn med korsmerkede hjelmer og skjold. Det var ikke Sankt Olav selv, sa han, for det tyktes ham usømmelig at en syndig mann hadde bilder av de hellige i sitt hus uten til å lese sine bønner foran – men det kunne likesom være to kjemper av Olavsliden. All den gamle treskurden hadde Lavrans selv hugget opp og brent – tjenestekarene torde ikke gjøre det. Det var så vidt de fikk lov til å bære ut mat på den store stenen ved Jørunds haug helligkveldene – men Lavrans syntes dog det ville være synd å ta dette fra haugbonden som han hadde vært vant til å få så lenge som her hadde bodd folk på gården. Han var død lenge før det kom kristendom til Norge, så det var ikke hans skyld at han var en hedning.","ONE OF THE FIRST things Kristin had seen at home was that all the old men who had stood over the wind ski crosses in the gables were gone. Instead, there had been spiers with foliage and birds and a gilded weather wing on the new cage. The old high-seat posts in the living room had also been replaced with new ones. The old men had been cut out like two men, ugly enough, but they had now apparently been there since the house was built, and they had used to grease them and toe them with beer for the holidays. On the new posts, the father had carved out two men with cross-marked helmets and shields. It was not Saint Olav himself, he said, for it seemed to him indecent that a sinful man had pictures of the saints in his house without reading his prayers in front - but it could just as well be two giants of Olavsliden. Lavrans himself had cut up and burned all the old wooden scraps - the servants did not dare to do so. It was as far as they were allowed to carry food on the big stone at Jørund's mound on holy evenings - but Lavrans thought it would be a shame to take this from the mound farmer that he had been used to getting as long as people had lived here. the farm. He had died long before Christianity came to Norway, so it was not his fault that he was a Gentile.","ONE of the first things Kristin had marked at her old home was that all the old heads of men, that had stood where the vergeboards crossed at the house-gables, were gone now. Instead there had been set up spires with carven birds and foliage-work, and the new storehouse had a gilded weather-vane. The old posts of the high seat in the hearth-room house, too, had been changed for new. The old ones had been carved in the likeness of two men; ugly enough — but ’twas thought they had been there ever since the house was built, and the custom had been to smear them with fat and bathe them with ale at festivals. On the new posts her father had carved out two men with helms and shields marked with the Cross. ’ Twas not St. Olav himself, said he, for it seemed to him unmeet that a sinful man should have images of the holy ones in his house, except to pray before them — but they might, he thought, be two warriors of Olav’s guard. All the old carvings Lavrans had himself cut up and burnt — the serving-men dared not touch them. It was with some doubt he still let them bear out food to the great stone at Jörund’s grave-mound on holy eves — but yet he deemed ’twere sin and shame to deny to the tenant of the mound what he had been used to be given ever since folk had dwelt upon the place. He had died long before Christendom had come to Norway, so it was not his fault that he was a heathen.","ONE OF THE first things Kristin noticed at home was that all the carvings of old men’s heads which sat carved above the crossbeams on the building gables were now gone. They had been replaced by spires with foliage and birds, and there was a gilded weather vane atop the new house. The old posts on the high seat in the hearth room had also been replaced with new ones.

They weren’t meant to be Saint Olav himself, Lavrans said, for he didn’t think it would be proper for a sinful man to have images of the saint in his house, except those he knelt in front of to say his prayers. But they could very well be two of Olav’s men. Lavrans had chopped up and burned all the old carvings himself. The servants didn’t dare. It was with some reluctance that he still allowed them to take food out to the great stone at Jørund ’s grave on the evening before holy days; Lavrans conceded that it would be a shame to take away from the original owner of the estate something he had grown accustomed to receiving for as long as anyone had lived on the land. He died long before Christianity came to Norway, so it wasn’t his fault that he was a heathen."

He had been crazy with joy all the time on board — and Sir Baard had laughed: at his home in Möre, where Erlend had grown up, the boys had been out in the boats sailing or rowing late and early. ’ Twas true they had been a little sorry for her, Erlend and Sir Baard, but not so sorry, Kristin thought, as her wretchedness deserved. They kept on saying the sea-sickness would pass when she grew used to being aboard ship. But from first to last her misery had not abated.","Erlend led his deathly pale and miserable young wife along the dock. The abbot bantered about the wretchedness of the sea voyage; Erlend laughed and said that his wife was no doubt longing to sleep in a bed that stood firmly next to a wall. And Kristin tried to smile, but she was thinking that she would not go willingly on board a ship again for as long as she lived. She felt ill if Erlend merely came close to her, so strongly did he smell of the ship and the sea—his hair was completely stiff and tacky with salt water. He had been quite giddy with joy the entire time they were on board ship, and Sir Baard had laughed. Out there at Møre, where Erlend had grown up, the boys were constantly out in the boats, sailing and rowing. They had felt some sympathy for her, both Erlend and Sir Baard, but not as much as her misery warranted, thought Kristin. They kept saying that the seasickness would pass after she got used to being on board. But she had continued to feel wretched during the entire voyage."

"Hun måtte hele tiden tenke på broder Edvin. Slik hadde han gått og gått, år ut og år inn, fra tidlig vår til senhøstes. Over fjellstiene, innunder svarte skar og hvite snefonner. Han hadde rastet på setrene, drukket av bekken og bitt av brødet som budeier og hestegjetere bar ut til ham, så bad han lev vel og Guds fred og velsignelse over folk og fe. Gjennom susende skoglier steg munken ned i dalen; lang og lutrygget, med bøyd hode, vandret han tjodveien forbi de byggede gårder og bøer – og overalt hvor han kom, lå hans kjærlige forbønner for alle mennesker efter ham som godvær.","She constantly had to think of Brother Edvin. This is how he had gone and gone, year in and year out, from early spring to late autumn. Over the mountain trails, below black crevices and white snow fountains. He had rested on the farms, drank from the brook and been bitten by the bread that the messenger and horse shepherds carried out to him, so he prayed live well and God's peace and blessing on people and cattle. Through rushing forest slopes the monk descended into the valley; long and stocky, with a bowed head, he walked the path of the past farms and farms built - and wherever he went, his loving intercession for all people lay after him as good weather.","All the time she could not but think of Brother Edvin. So had he walked and walked, year in, year out, from early spring to deepest winter. Over the mountain paths, under black scaurs and white snow-fields. He had rested him at the sæters, drunk of the beck, and eaten of the bread that sæter-girls and horse-herds bore out to him — then had he bidden farewell and called down God’s peace and benison on fold and cattle. Down through the sighing woods of the hill-sides he had passed, down into the Dale; tall and stoop-shouldered, with head bent forward, he had wandered along the high-road past the well-tilled farms and the dwelling-places — and everywhere, wheresoever he passed, his loving intercessions for all men left, as it were, fair weather in his track.","The whole time she found herself thinking about Brother Edvin. This is how he had walked and walked, year in and year out, from early spring until late in the fall. Over mountain paths, through dark ravines and white snowdrifts. He rested in the mountain pastures, drank from the creeks, and ate from the bread that milk-maids and horse herdsmen brought out to him. Then he would bid them live well and God’s peace and bestow blessings on both them and the livestock. Through rustling mountain meadows the monk would hike down into the valley. Tall and stoop-shouldered, with his head bowed, he wandered the main roads past manors and farms—and everywhere he went, he would leave behind his loving prayers of intercession for everyone, like good weather."
"Hun syntes så ung og myk i kroppen slik hun stod litt dreid i hoften og så seg bak over skulderen. Straks hun var kommet til Oslo, hadde hun begynt å feste hodeplagget sitt på en annen måte. Her syd var det bare småmenns koner som bar linet på den gammeldagse måten som hun hadde brukt helt fra hun ble gift: stramt om ansiktet som et nonnelin, snippene festet i kors over skuldrene så halsen helt skjultes, med mange folder på sidene og ut over bakhodets hårknute. I Trondheim gjaldt det så å si som et tegn på fromhet å sette skautet sitt på denne måten, som erkebiskop Eiliv alltid lovpriste som det sedeligste og tuktigste lag for gifte kvinner. Men for ikke å stikke av hadde hun tatt opp moten her sydpå, med linkledet lagt glatt over issen og hengende rett ned bak, så forhåret syntes og hals og skulder ble fri, og så hørte det til at flettene ble bare bundet opp så de ikke syntes under linets kant, men hodeduken smøg seg mykt efter hodeskålens form. Simon hadde nok sett det før og tenkt at det kledde henne – men han hadde allikevel ikke før sett hvor ung hun ble seende ut av det. Og hennes øyne skinte som stjerner.","She seemed so young and soft in body that she stood a little turned in her hip and looked behind her shoulder. As soon as she arrived in Oslo, she had started to fasten her headdress in another way. Here in the south, only the wives of small men wore the linen in the old-fashioned way that she had used ever since she was married: tight around her face like a nun's linen, the snippets fastened crosswise over her shoulders so that her neck was completely hidden, with many folds on the sides and beyond occipital hair node. In Trondheim, it was almost as a sign of piety to put on his scarf in this way, which Archbishop Eiliv always praised as the most moral and chaste team for married women. But in order not to run away, she had taken up the fashion here in the south, with the leash laid smoothly over the ice and hanging straight down behind, so that the hair seemed and neck and shoulder became free, and then it belonged that the braids were just tied up so they did not appeared below the edge of the linen, but the headscarf slipped softly to the shape of the skull. Simon had probably seen it before and thought it suited her - but he had not yet seen how young she looked from it. And her eyes shone like stars.","She seemed so young and supple as she stood there, turned a little from the hips, and looked back over her shoulder. As soon as she came to Oslo, she had begun to fasten her head-gear in another fashion. Here in the south it was only small farmers’ wives who wore the linen head-dress in the old-world way she had used ever since she was wedded; tight round the face like a nun’s coif, with the falls fastened cross-wise over the shoulders so that the neck was quite hid, and with many folds on the sides and over the knot of hair at the back of the head. In Trondheim it was accounted, so to speak, a token of piety to set up the coif in this fashion, which Archbishop Eiliv praised always as the most fitting and modest way for wedded women. But so as not to be too much marked out, she had taken up now with the fashion of these southern parts: the linen cloth laid smoothly over the crown of the head and hanging straight down behind, so that the front hair showed, and the neck and shoulders were free — and then it was the proper thing that the plaits should be but tied up so that they did not show under the edge of the coif, while the linen fitted close above, throwing out the form of the head. True, Simon had seen this before and deemed that it became her well — yet he had not seen before how young it made her look. And her eyes shone like stars.","Her body seemed so young and soft as she stood there with her hip turned slightly, looking back over her shoulder. As soon as she arrived in Oslo, she had begun fastening her wimple in a different manner than before. Here in the south only the wives of smallholders wore the wimple in the old-fashioned way she had worn it ever since she was married: tightly framing her face like a nun’s wimple, with the ends crossed in front so her neck was completely hidden, and the folds draped along the sides and over her hair, which was knotted at the nape of her neck. In Trøndelag it was considered a sign of piety to wear the wimple in this manner, which Archbishop Eiliv had always praised as the most seemly and chaste style for married women. But in order to fit in, Kristin had adopted the fashion of the south, with the linen cloth placed smoothly on her head and hanging straight back, so that her hair in front was visible, and her neck and shoulders were free. And another part of the style was to have the braids simply pinned up so they couldn’t be seen under the edge of the wimple, with the cloth fitted softly to the shape of her head. Simon had seen this before and thought it suited her—but he had never noticed how young it made her look. And her eyes were shining like stars."

"«Da skjønte jeg at denne veldige kjærlighet oppholder alt i verden – selv ilden i helvete. For om Gud ville, kunne han ta sjelen med vold – da var vi aldeles avmektige i hans hånd.

Men jeg har også tenkt at kan hende kan ingen sjel dog fortapes til evig tid. For hver sjel må attrå denne kjærlighet, tykkes meg, men det synes så dyrt kjøp å la fare alle andre koster for den saks skyld. Men når ilden har fortært all annen motvillig og gudsfiendsk vilje, da skal til sist viljen til Gud, om den ikke var større i et menneske enn som en nagle i et helt hus, ligge igjen i sjelen som jernet ligger efter i branntomten –.»","""Then I realized that this great love sustains everything in the world - even the fire in hell.

"«Ja, landefreden,» svarte Erling Vidkunssøn. «Du skal minnes, Erlend – ikke vi alene av ridderskapet bygger dette landet. Deg ville det kanskje tykkes gammen om her stod opp en eventyrlysten og ærgjerrig mann som Knut Porse. Det var slik før i verden at når en mann her i landet reiste opprørsflokk, da var det alltid lett for ham å få følge blant stormennene. Enten vant de og fikk navnebøter og veitsler, eller så vant frendene deres, og de fikk grid for liv og eiendommer – ja det står skrevet opp hvem som mistet livet, men storparten berget seg, enten det gikk slik eller slik – så av våre fedre. Men bondemugen og bymennene, Erlend – arbeidsfolket som ble krevd for skylder til to herrer mangen gang i ett år og enda måtte glede seg hver gang en flokk fór gjennom bygdene uten å brenne gårdene deres og hugge ned bufeet – almuen, som måtte tåle slik ulidelig tyngsel og overvold – den tenker jeg takker Gud og Sankt Olav for gamle kong Håkon og kong Magnus og sønnene hans, som styrket lovene og trygget freden –»","""Yes, peace,"" replied Erling Vidkunsson. ""You must remember, Erlend - we are not the only ones to build this country through chivalry. It might seem old to you if an adventurous and ambitious man like Knut Porse stood up here. It was so before in the world that when a man in this country raised a rebel group, then it was always easy for him to follow among the great men. Either they won and got name fines and vices, or their relatives won, and they got a grid for life and property - yes it is written down who lost their life, but the majority survived, whether it went this way or that way - so by our fathers . But the peasants and the townspeople, Erlend - the working people who were demanded to owe two gentlemen many times a year and still had to rejoice every time a herd went through the villages without burning their farms and chopping down the buffet - the common people, who had to endure so unbearably heaviness and violence - I think I thank God and Saint Olav for old King Håkon and King Magnus and his sons, who strengthened the laws and secured peace - »","“Aye, peace in the land,” answered Erling Vidkunssön. “Bear in mind, Erlend — ’tis not we of the knighthood alone that own this land and live in it. To you ’twould mayhap seem sport if there should arise here a man greedy of adventure and of power like Knut Porse. So it was in bygone days that when a man raised revolt in this our land, ’twas ever easy for him to find followers from among the nobles. Either they would gain the upper hand and win titles and fiefs, or their kinsmen won and they were given grace for life and goods — aye, the record tells who lost their lives, but the more part saved their skins, whether things went so or so — the more part of our fathers, mark you. But the mass of the common farmers and the townsmen, Erlend — the working-folk that many a time had their dues wrung from them twice over in one year, and might be joyful, moreover, each time a troop had passed through the country-side without burning their farms and slaughtering their cattle — the common folk that had to suffer such unbearable burdens and oppressions — they, I trow, thank God and St. Olav for old King Haakon and King Magnus and his sons, who strengthened the laws and made the peace sure.” …","“Yes, peace in the land,” replied Erling Vidkunssøn. “You must remember, Erlend, that we knights are not the only ones who live in this country. To you it might seem amusing if an adventurous and ambitious man like Knut Porse should rise up here. In the past, things were such in the world that if a man stirred up a group of rebels, it was always easy for him to win a following among the noblemen. Either they won and acquired titles and land, or their kinsmen won and they were granted a reprieve for both their lives and their estates. Yes, those who lost their lives have been entered in the records, but the majority survived, no matter whether things went one way or the other— that’s how it was for our fathers. But the farmers and the townspeople, Erlend—the workers who often had to make payments to two masters many times in a single year, but who still had to rejoice each time a band of rebels raced through their villages without burning their farms or slaughtering their cattle—the peasants, who had to endure such intolerable burdens and attacks—I think they must thank God and Saint Olav for old King Haakon and King Magnus and his sons, who fortified the laws and secured the peace.”"
"De hadde hatt gården full av gjester uken før. Nu hadde Erlend latt innrede det loftet som var nederst i hallen over kleven og forstuen, da Margret kom hjem – det skulle være hennes jomfrubur, sa han, og der sov hun med den ternen som hennes far hadde satt til å følge og tjene møen; også Frida lå der med Bjørgulf. Men da de nu fikk så mange julegjester, så hadde Kristin redd til de unge mennene på dette loftsrom; de to terner og spedbarnet måtte sove i tjenestekonenes hus. Men nettopp fordi hun hadde tenkt Erlend ville kanskje ikke like at hun viste Margret til sengs med tjenestefolket, hadde hun redd til henne på en av benkene i hallen, hvor fruer og møer sov. Margret var alltid vond å få opp om morgenene; denne morgen hadde Kristin vekket henne mange ganger, men hun hadde lagt seg til igjen, lå og sov enda efter at alle de andre var oppe. Kristin ville ha hallen ryddet og istandsatt; gjestene skulle ha dugurd – og så mistet hun rent tålmodigheten. Hun hadde revet dynene bort under Margrets hode og tatt bort overbredslet. Men da hun så barnet ligge der nakent på skinnlakenet, hadde hun kastet kåpen fra sine skuldre over henne. Det var et plagg av simpelt, ufarvet vadmel – hun brukte det bare når hun gikk til og fra ildhuset og burene og så efter matstellet.","They had had the farm full of guests the week before. Now Erlend had had the attic at the bottom of the hall above the kleven and the vestibule furnished, when Margret came home - it was to be her maiden's cage, he said, and there she slept with the tern which her father had set to follow and serve the maiden; Frida also lay there with Bjørgulf. But now that they had so many Christmas guests, Kristin was afraid of the young men in this attic; the two terns and the infant had to sleep in the maids' house. But precisely because she had thought Erlend might not like that she showed Margret to bed with the servants, she had scared her on one of the benches in the hall, where ladies and maids slept. Margret was always hard to get up in the mornings; this morning Kristin had woken her many times, but she had gone to bed again, lay still asleep after all the others were up. Kristin wanted the hall cleaned and renovated; the guests were to have dugurd - and then she lost all patience. She had torn the duvets off under Margret's head and taken away the blanket. But when she saw the child lying there naked on the leather sheet, she had thrown the coat from her shoulders over her. It was a garment of simple, uncolored wadding - she only used it when she went to and from the firehouse and the cages and looked after the food.","They had had the manor full of guests the week before. Now when Margret came home, Erlend had had the loft at the lower end of the hall, over the outer room and the closet, set in order for a sleeping-room — it should be her maiden bower, he said — and there she slept, with the maid whom her father had set to tend and serve her; Frida slept there too, with Björgulf. But now, in this press of Yule-tide guests, Kristin had made this loft a sleeping-room for the young men, and the two maids and the babe must sleep in the serving-women’s house. But since she had thought Erlend would maybe not like that she should send Margret to sleep with the serving-folk, she had made up a bed for her on one of the benches in the hall, where the ladies and maidens were sleeping. Margret was ever loath to rise in the mornings; that morning Kristin had waked her many times, but she had turned over again, and still lay sleeping after all the others were up. Kristin must needs have the hall cleared and made ready — the guests must have their morning meal — and at length she quite lost patience. She pulled the down pillows from under Margret’s head, and took away the coverings from above her. But when she saw the child lying there naked on the fur rug, she threw over her the cloak from her own shoulders. It was a piece of plain undyed wadmal — she wore it only when she went to and from the kitchen and storehouses to see to the service of the food.","The manor had been filled with guests the week before. When Margret came home, Erlend had furnished the loft which was at the far end of the hall, above the next room and the entry hall—it was to be her bower, he said. And there she slept with the servant girl whom Erlend had ordered to keep watch over and serve the maiden. Frida also slept there along with Bjørgulf. But since they had so many Christmas guests, Kristin had made up beds for the young men in this loft room; the two maids and the infant were to sleep in the servant women’s house. But because she thought Erlend might not like it if she sent Margret off to sleep with the servants, she had made up a bed for her on one of the benches in the hall, where the women and maidens were sleeping. It was always difficult to get Margret up in the morning. On that morning Kristin had woken her many times, but she had lain back down, and she was still asleep after everyone else was up. Kristin wanted to clean the hall and put things in order; the guests must be given breakfast—and so she lost all patience. She yanked the pillows from under Margret’s head and tore off the covers. But when she saw the child lying there naked on the sheet made of hides, she took her own cloak from her shoulders and placed it over Margret. It was a garment made from plain, undyed homespun; she only wore it when she went back and forth to the cookhouse and the storerooms, tending to the food preparation."

Og så ville hun vite hvem de hadde lært slikt av – det var vel i borgstuen, men hvem av mennene lærte slikt til barn. Guttene ville ikke svare. Da kom Skule frem under loftstrappen; han sa at moren kunne tie, for visen hadde de lært av å høre faren synge den –.","Her mother was furious, she went down to the servants and spoke to them in the harshest words. And then she wanted to know who they had learned such from - it was probably in the castle room, but which of the men taught such to children. The boys would not answer. Then Skule came out from under the attic stairs; he said that the mother could be silent, for the song they had learned from hearing the father sing it -.","Their mother was beside herself with anger — she went down to the boys and chid them with the harshest words. And then she said she must know whom they learnt such things from — most like ’twas in the servants’ house, but which of the men was it that taught children such things? The boys would not answer. Then Skule came out from under the loft-stairway, and said mother had best be still, for they had learnt the song from hearing father sing it.","Their mother was beside herself with rage as she went downstairs to speak to her sons in the harshest words. She wanted to know who had taught the boys the song—it must have been in the servants’ hall, but who among the men would teach children such a song? The boys refused to answer. Then Skule appeared beneath the loft steps; he told his mother she might as well stop asking, because they had learned the ballad from listening to their father sing it."
"«Jeg vet det,» sa husfruen. «Men det er sånn, Ulv, at det blir ikke lett for meg å styre her i vinter, nykommen som jeg er her nordenfjells og ukjent med folkene våre. Vakkert ville det være av deg om du ville hjelpe og rettlede meg.»","""I know,"" said the housewife. ""But it's like that, Ulv, that it will not be easy for me to steer here this winter, newcomer as I am here in Nordenfjell and unfamiliar with our people. It would be beautiful of you if you would help and guide me. ""","“I know it,” said the mistress of the house. “But so it is, Ulf, that ’twill be no easy task for me to guide things here this winter, a newcomer as I am here north of Dovre, and with no knowledge of our folks. ’ Twould be a friend’s turn of you if you would help and counsel me.”","“I know that,” said the mistress. “But as things stand, Ulf, it won’t be easy for me to manage this winter, newly arrived as I am in this northern region and unfamiliar with our people. It would be kind of you to help me and advise me.”"
Lavrans snappet efter pusten – «hus –?» sa han uvilkårlig.,Lavrans snapped for breath - «house -?» he said involuntarily.,Lavrans caught his breath. “House?” he gasped out.,Lavrans gasped for air. “House?” he repeated involuntarily.
"Hele tiden hadde Gunnulf merket at erkebiskopen likte lite han tenkte og grunnet så meget selv. Det tyktes Gunnulf at herr Eilif Kortin selv og hans prester var som menn som murte og murte på huset. Kirkens ære og kirkens makt og kirkens rett –. Gud visste han skulle vel være like så nidkjær for kirkens saker som noen annen prest, ikke skulle han gå unna arbeidet med å slepe sten og bære kalk til bygget. Men det var som de var redde for å gå inn i huset og hvile ut i det. Det var som de var redde for å komme på villveier hvis de tenkte for meget –.","All the time Gunnulf had noticed that the archbishop did not like what he thought and reasoned so much himself. It seemed to Gunnulf that Mr. Eilif Kortin himself and his priests were like men who bricked and bricked the house. The honor of the church and the power of the church and the right of the church -. God knew he should be as zealous for the affairs of the church as any other priest, he should not go away from the work of dragging stones and carrying lime to the building. But it was as if they were afraid to go into the house and rest in it. It was as if they were afraid of going astray if they thought too much -.","Ah, but in that sweet spring his learning had seemed to him no more to be held in reverence than the learning every little maid gets from her mother — to spin and brew and bake and milk — the teaching every child needs that it may do its work in the world.",All this time Gunnulf noticed that the archbishop was not pleased that he thought and pondered so much on his own. It seemed to Gunnulf that Lord Eiliv Kortin and his priests were like men who were adding more and more bricks to their house. The honor of the Church and the power of the Church and the right of the Church. God knew that Gunnulf could be just as zealous as any other priest about matters of the Church; he was not one to avoid the work of hauling stones or carrying mortar for the building. But they seemed to be afraid of entering the house and resting inside. They seemed to be afraid of going astray if they thought too much.
"«Reis ikke, Gunnulf,» bad han.","""Do not travel, Gunnulf,"" he begged.","“Leave us not, Gunnulf,” he begged.","“Don’t go, Gunnulf,” he begged."
"Han førte henne ut i skrudhuset og tok kransen, viklet den ut av linduken og så på den, så smilte han litt:","He led her out into the dressing room and took the wreath, unwrapped it from the linen cloth and looked at it, then he smiled a little:","He led her out into the sacristy, took the wreath, and unwrapped the linen cloth from around it and looked at it; then he smiled a little.",He led her into the sacristy and took the crown; he unwrapped the linen cloth and looked at it. Then he smiled.
De taug en stund. Så sa Kristin sakte:,The rope and moment. Then Kristin said slowly:,"They were silent awhile. Then Kristin said, softly:","They were silent for a while. Then Kristin said softly, “This has not been a joyful journey for you, Simon.”"
Erlend lo igjen:,Erlend laughed again:,Erlend laughed again:,Erlend laughed again.

"Samtidig med at hirdstevnet ble holdt i kongsgården, hadde erkebiskopen concilium i sin borg. Simon var en mann som hadde mange venner og kjenninger; han kunne da melde Kristin nytt. Alle mente at Erlend ble vel dømt til å fare utleg og å ha forbrutt sine gods til kongen. Erlend sa også slik ville det nok gå; han var ved godt mot – han aktet å ty til Danmark. Slik som sakene stod der i landet, var det alltid åpen vei for en rask og våpendugelig mann, og fru Ingebjørg ville sikkert fagne hans hustru som sin frendekone og holde henne hos seg i sømmelig heder. Barna fikk Simon ta til seg, men de to eldste sønnene ville Erlend dog helst ha med ut –.","At the same time as the shepherds' meeting was held in the royal court, the archbishop had concilium in his castle. Simon was a man who had many friends and acquaintances; he could then report Kristin again. Everyone thought that Erlend was doomed to go into exile and to have forfeited his property to the king. Erlend also said this is how it would probably go; he was in good spirits - he intended to resort to Denmark. As things stood in the country, there was always an open road for a quick and able-bodied man, and Mrs. Ingebjørg would surely welcome his wife as his cousin and keep her with him in decent honor. The children were allowed to take Simon with them, but Erlend would rather take the two eldest sons out -.","While the meeting of King’s-men sat in the castle, the Archbishop held a concilium in his palace. Simon was a man with many friends and acquaintances; he could thus tell Kristin what was going forward. All deemed it likely that Erlend would be outlawed and banished and his lands and goods be forfeit to the King. Erlend, too, said ’twas like it would be so ; he was in good heart — he meant to seek refuge in Denmark. As things stood in that land, the road to advancement was ever open to a man of mettle and skill in arms, and Lady Ingebjörg would surely welcome his wife as her kinswoman and keep her with her in all seemly honour. Simon would have to take the children, save the two eldest sons, whom Erlend was minded to have with him in Denmark.","At the same time the meeting of the retainers was being held at the king’s palace, the archbishop convened a concilium at his estate. Simon was a man with many friends and acquaintances, and so he could report to Kristin what was happening. Everyone thought that Erlend would be banished and would have to forfeit his properties to the king. Erlend also thought this was how things would turn out, and he was in good spirits; he was planning to go to Denmark. As things now stood in that country, there were always opportunities open for a man who was fit and skilled with weapons, and Lady Ingebjørg would surely embrace his wife as her kinswoman and keep her at her side with the proper honors. Simon would have to take care of the children, although Erlend wanted to take his two eldest sons with him."
"«Det er enda vel han har det vett han gjeter møen sin,» sa Ulv.","""It's probably still he has the sense he shepherds his maid,"" said Ulv.","“ ’Tis well at least he hath wit enough to watch his own maid,” said Ulf.","he understands he should keep a watchful eye on that maiden of his,” said Ulf."
"«Det hender de bruker det her nordenfjells,» sa Erlend sakte. «Kan det korte pinen litt for deg, Kristin min, så får du da –»","""Sometimes they use it here in Nordenfjells,"" Erlend said slowly. ""Can it shorten the pain a little for you, my Kristin, then you get -""","“They use it sometimes here north of Dovre,” said Erlend softly. “If it might shorten the pain for you a little, my Kristin, you must suffer it — ”","“It’s sometimes done here in the north,” said Erlend quietly. “If it can lessen the pain a little for you, my Kristin, then you must—”"
"Da hadde hun ikke selv visst at hun alt gikk med det andre barnet. Hun hadde trodd når hun kjente seg uvel – Erlend ståket slik, det hadde vært så meget med uro og drikkelag hjemme, og Nåkkve suget henne ut. Da hun følte det nye livet røre seg, var hun blitt – –. Hun hadde gledet seg slik til vinteren, til å ferdes i by og bygd med sin vakre, djerve husbond, hun da var ung og vakker selv. Hun hadde tenkt å venne gutten fra til høsten – det var tungvint å skulle føre ham og barnedeien med seg overalt hvor hun fór. Hun var så viss på at i denne russeleidangen skulle Erlend nok vise han duget til annet enn legge øde sitt navn og sitt gods. Nei, hun var ikke blitt glad, og hun hadde sagt det til Sira Eiliv. Da satte presten henne meget hardt i rette for hennes ukjærlige og verdslige sinnelag. Og hele sommeren hadde hun gått og strevet for å være glad og takke Gud for det nye barnet hun skulle få, og for de gode tidender som hun spurte om Erlends djerve fremferd nordpå.","Then she had not even known that she was all going with the other child. She had thought when she felt unwell - Erlend was so upset, there had been so much unrest and drinking at home, and Nåkkve sucked her out. When she felt the new life move, she had become - -. She had been looking forward so much to the winter, to traveling in the city and the countryside with her beautiful, bold husband, she was then young and beautiful herself. She had intended to accustom the boy from to the autumn - it was difficult to take him and the child with her everywhere she went. She was so sure that in this russeleidangen Erlend would probably show he was capable of anything other than destroying his name and his estate. No, she had not been happy, and she had told Sira Eiliv. Then the priest rebuked her very harshly for her unloving and worldly disposition. And all summer she had been striving to be happy and thank God for the new child she was to have, and for the good news she asked about Erlend's bold progress to the north.","She had not known herself then that already she was with child again. She had thought when she felt sick, ’twas but with the bustle over Erlend’s going, with the unquiet times and drinking-feasts at home, and that she was worn out with suckling Naakkve. When she felt new life quicken within her, she had been — She had so looked forward to the winter, to going about in city and country-side with her fair and gallant husband — while yet she, too, was fair and young. She was so sure that in his Russian warfare Erlend would show he was fit for other things than wasting his name and fame and goods. She had thought to wean the boy in autumn — ’twas troublesome to take him and his nurse with her wherever she might go. — And now — no, she had not been glad, and she had told this to Sira Eiliv. Then had the priest rebuked her most sharply for her unloving and worldly spirit. And the whole summer she had passed striving to be glad and to thank God for the new child she was to bear, and for the good tidings that came to her of Erlend’s worthy deeds in the north.","At that time she didn’t know she was already carrying another child. When she felt unwell she had thought . . . Erlend was so exuberant, there had been so much commotion and drinking at home, and Naakkve was sucking the strength out of her. When she felt the new life stir inside her, she was . . . She had been looking forward to the winter, to traveling to town and around the valley with her bold and handsome husband; she was young and beautiful herself. She had planned to wean the boy by autumn; it was troublesome always having to take him and the nursemaid along wherever she went. She was certain that in this Russian campaign Erlend would prove fit for something other than ruining his name and his property. No, she had not been glad, and she told this to Sira Eiliv. Then the priest had reprimanded her quite sternly for her unloving and worldly disposition. And all summer long she had tried to be happy and to thank God for the new child she was to have, and for the good reports she heard about Erlend’s courageous actions in the north."
"«Jeg har hilsninger til deg fra Erlend, Kristin – jeg fikk tale med ham.»","""I have greetings to you from Erlend, Kristin - I got to talk to him.""","“I bear you greetings from Erlend, Kristin — I came to speech with him.”",I was allowed to speak to him.”
"«Det kan vel skaffes dispens for din byrd,» svarte presten jevnt. «Kan hende, Orm, vi kunne følges syd en gang i verden, du og jeg –»","""Exemption may be granted for your burden,"" replied the priest evenly. ""Can her, Orm, we could be followed south once in the world, you and I -""","“For your birth a dispensation could be had, I trow,” said the priest quietly. “Maybe, Orm, some day we might journey southward together, you and I — ”","“Dispensation can be sought for your birth,” said the priest calmly. “Perhaps we might journey south together sometime, Orm, you and I.”"
"«Jeg eier hverken gods eller frender å svare for,» sa munken. «Jeg har nu løst meg fra alle bånd, men du har bundet deg, bror.»","""I have neither property nor relatives to answer for,"" said the monk. ""I have now freed myself from all bondage, but you have bound yourself, brother.""","“I have neither goods nor kin to answer for,” said the monk. “I have loosed me now from all bonds; but you have bound you, brother.”","“I own neither manors nor kinsmen to answer for,” said the monk. “I have now freed myself from all bonds, but you have bound yourself, brother.”"
"Gunnulf snudde seg fra henne, hvit og skjelven. Han tok seg over ansiktet:","Gunnulf turned away from her, white and trembling. He took care of his face:","Gunnulf turned from her, white and trembling. He passed his hand over his face:","Gunnulf turned away from her, pale and trembling. He drew his hand over his face."
"Femte dagen begynte gravølet, det var overmåte prektig i alle måter – der var mere enn hundre fremmede hester i gården og på Laugarbru, også på Formo lå der gjester. Syvende dag skiftet arvingene i enighet og vennskap – Lavrans hadde selv ordnet alt før han døde, og alle fulgte nøye hans ønsker.","On the fifth day the funeral began, it was exceedingly magnificent in every way - there were more than a hundred foreign horses in the yard and at Laugarbru, also at Formo there were guests. On the seventh day, the heirs changed into agreement and friendship - Lavrans himself had arranged everything before he died, and everyone followed his wishes closely.","On the fifth day began the grave-ale — and ’twas stately beyond measure in every wise — there were more than a hundred strange horses on the manor and at Laugarbru, and, besides, some guests had to lie at Formo. On the seventh day the heirs divided the lands and goods in all friendliness and concord — Lavrans had taken order for all things himself before he died, and all followed his wishes faithfully.","On the fifth day the funeral feast began, and it was exceptionally grand in every way. There were more than a hundred strange horses at the manor and at Laugarbru; even Formo housed some of the guests.

«Det er ikke det!» Hun grep hardt om hans arm. «Gunnulf –!»,"""It is not!"" She gripped his arm tightly. ""Gunnulf -!""",“ ’Tis not that!” She gripped his arm hard. “Gunnulf — ” It seemed to him he had never seen such terror in a human face.,“That’s not it!” She gripped his arm hard. “Gunnulf!”
"Simon var hjertelig lei. Lei for han hadde krenket sin hustru slik, og lei for han hadde innlatt seg med piken, og ergerlig for han hadde tatt på seg farskapet. Han var langtfra sikker selv – Jorunn var lett gods, hun. Egentlig hadde han aldri likt henne; hun var grim, men kjapp i munnen og morsom å snakke med, og det hadde vært hun som satt oppe efter ham alltid når han kom sent hjem siste vinter. Han hadde svart overilet fordi han hadde ventet at hustruen skulle klage og laste ham. Det var dumt tenkt, han burde ha visst Halfrid ville holde seg altfor god til slikt. Men nu var det gjort – gå tilbake fra sitt eget ord ville han ikke. Så fikk han finne seg i å hete far til sin ternes barn, enten han var det eller ikke.","Simon was heartbroken. Sorry because he had abused his wife like that, and sorry because he had indulged in the girl, and sorry that he had taken on the paternity. He was far from sure himself - Jorunn was easy goods, she. Actually, he had never liked her; she was ugly, but quick in the mouth and fun to talk to, and it had been she who sat up after him always when he came home late last winter. He had answered rashly because he had expected his wife to complain and load him. It was a stupid idea, he should have known Halfrid would stay too good for that. But now it was done - go back from his own word he would not. Then he found himself called the father of his daughter's children, whether he was or not.","Simon was sick at heart. Sickened because he had so affronted his wife, and sickened at his folly in having to do with the girl, and vexed that he had taken the fatherhood on his shoulders. He was in no wise sure himself. Jorunn was a light piece of goods, he knew. In truth, he had never much liked her; she was ugly, but had a sharp tongue in her head, and was merry to talk with; and it had been she who sat up for him ever when he had come home late during the last winter. He had answered over-hastily, fearing that his wife might complain and blame him. ’ Twas a clownish fear; he should have known Halfrid would never stoop to such complaints. But now ’twas done — go back from his own word he would not. He must even put up with being held for the father of his serving-woman’s child, whether he were so or not.","Simon was truly sorry. Sorry he had offended his wife in this manner, and sorry he had taken up with this girl, regretting that he had now assumed the burden of fatherhood. He was far from certain that it was actually his—Jorunn had loose ways. And he had never really liked her; she was ugly, but she was quick-witted and amusing to talk to. And she was the one who had always sat up to wait for him whenever he came home late the winter before. He had spoken rashly because he expected his wife to berate and denounce him. That was foolish of him; he should have known that Halfrid would consider herself above such conduct. But now it was done, and he wouldn’t retreat from his own words. He would have to put up with being called father of his maid’s child, whether he was or not."

"«Du får tro,» sa Simon fort, «der er ikke mø i Norges land som jeg heller ville ha enn Ramborg. Det er slik, Lavrans, at det tykkes meg være altfor stort hell for meg om jeg får så fager og ung og god en brud, rik og ættet fra de gjeveste slekter. Og deg til værfar,» sa han litt forlegent.","""You will believe,"" said Simon quickly, ""there is no maiden in the land of Norway that I would rather have than Ramborg. It is so, Lavrans, that it seems to me to be far too much luck for me if I get such a beautiful and young and good a bride, rich and descended from the most generous families. And you to the weather father, 'he said a little embarrassed.","“You must believe,” said Simon quickly, “there is no maid in Norway’s land that I would rather have than Ramborg. So it is, Lavrans, that I deemed it all too great good fortune for me if I should get me so fair and young and good a bride, rich, and come on both sides of the highest kin. And you for father-in-law,” he said a little sheepishly.","“You should know,” said Simon quickly, “that there is not another maiden in all of Norway I would rather have than Ramborg. If truth be told, Lavrans, my good fortune seems much too great if I’m to have such a fair, young, and good bride, who is rich and descended from the best lineage. And you as my father-in-law,” he added, a little self-consciously."

"Enda var hun kommet opp efter hver barnsseng, like fager – bare litt stillere, med litt tyngre ansvar på de unge skuldre. Litt smalere om kinnene, øynene litt mørkere og mere alvorlige under den brede, hvite panne, munnen litt mindre rød og fyldig. Men venheten skulle vel bli slitt av henne innen hun var mange år eldre, hvis det ble ved slik –.","Still she had come up after each cot, equally beautiful - only a little quieter, with a little heavier responsibility on the young shoulders.

But the friendship should probably be worn by her before she was many years older, if it continued like this -.","As yet she had arisen from each child-bearing fair as ever — only a little stiller, with the weight on her young shoulders a little heavier. A little thinner in the cheeks, the eyes a little darker and more sad under the broad white forehead, the mouth a little less full and red. But ’twas like her comeliness would be worn away ere she was many years older, if things went on as they were going.…","So far she had recovered from each childbirth looking just as lovely as ever—only a little quieter, with heavier responsibilities on her young shoulders. Her cheeks were thinner, her eyes a little darker and more somber beneath the wide, white forehead, and her lips were a little less red and full.

"Nei, for han hadde fått vite de var reist til gravølet på Blakarsarv. Det var en uhyggelig hendelse. Husfruen, Tora, Ragnfrids søskenbarn – hun hadde stupt ned fra burssvalen og hadde brutt ryggen, og det var mannen som hadde støtt henne utfor av vanvare – det var disse gamle burene hvor der ikke var noen riktig svalgang, der lå bare noen tiljer over stokkendene i den andre høyden. De hadde nok måttet binde Rolv og holde vakt over ham natt og dag siden ulykken hendte – han ville legge hånd på seg selv.","No, because he had been told they had gone to the grave beer at Blakarsarv. It was a gruesome incident. The housewife, Tora, Ragnfrid's cousins - she had plunged down from the cage swallow and had broken her back, and it was the man who had supported her downhill by accident - it was these old cages where there was no proper passage, where there were only a few tilers over the log ends in the other height. They had probably had to tie Rolv and keep watch over him night and day since the accident happened - he wanted to put his hand on himself.","No; for he had come to know they were gone from home to the grave-ale at Blakarsarv. There had been a grievous mischance. The mistress of the house, Tora, Ragnfrid’s cousin — she had fallen down from the storehouse balcony and broken her back — and ’twas her husband coming against her unawares that had pushed her over — it was one of those old storehouses where there was no right balcony, but only a few boards laid on the beam-ends of the upper story. He heard they had had to bind Rolf and watch him night and day since the mishap befell — to keep him from laying hands on himself.","No, for he had heard that they had gone to a wake at Blakarsarv. A terrible event had occurred. The mistress, Tora, Ragnfrid’s kinswoman, had fallen from the storeroom gallery and had broken her back, and it was her husband who had inadvertently pushed her out. It was one of those old storerooms without a proper gallery; there were merely several floorboards placed on top of the posts at the second-story level. They had been forced to tie up Rolv and keep watch over him night and day ever since the accident occurred. He wanted to lay hands on himself."

Kristin moved away a bit, laughed, and said with an innocent expression that she knew only that her husband was intending to travel south, “for whatever reason that might be. There’s so much unrest in the country right now; it’s difficult for a simple woman to understand such things.”"

"Da mor ble syk, skilte han seg fra Eline Ormsdatter. Mor syknet med sår og skorper på holdet, og far sa det var liktrå. Han sendte henne fra seg – ville true henne til å ta provent hos søstrene i spitalen. Da hentet Erlend mor og for med henne til Oslo – de var hos Åshild òg, hun er god legekone, og kongens franske lege sa også, spedalsk var hun ikke. Kong Håkon tok kjærlig mot Erlend da og bad ham prøve den hellige kong Erik Valdemarssøns grav – kongens morfar. Der hadde mange fått bot for hudsykdom.","When his mother became ill, he divorced Eline Ormsdatter. Mom got sick with sores and crusts on the hold, and Dad said it was straight. He sent her away - wanted to threaten her to take provent with the sisters in the hospital. Then Erlend brought his mother and took her to Oslo - they were with Åshild too, she is a good doctor's wife, and the king's French doctor also said, she was not a leper. King Håkon lovingly welcomed Erlend then and asked him to try the tomb of the holy King Erik Valdemarssøn - the king's grandfather. Many had been cured of skin disease there.","“When mother fell sick, he parted him from Eline Ormsdatter. Mother fell sick with sores and scabs on her flesh, and father said ’twas leprosy. He sent her from him — would have forced her to dwell as a commoner with the Sisters at the spital. Then Erlend fetched mother away and bore her with him to Oslo — they went, on the way, to Aashild, who is skilled in leechcraft, and she, and the King’s French leech too, said that she was no leper. King Haakon welcomed Erlend kindly then, and bade him try the virtue of the holy Erik Valdemarssön’s grave — the King’s mother’s father. Many had there found healing for skin-sicknesses.","“When Mother fell ill, he parted with Eline Ormsdatter. Mother grew sick with sores and scabs on her skin, and Father said it was leprosy.4 He sent her away—tried to threaten her into taking a corrody 5 with the sisters at the hospice.

King Haakon received Erlend kindly then, and bade him seek out the grave of the holy King Erik Valdemarssøn—the king’s grandfather. Many people found cures for their skin afflictions there."
"«Jo, jeg er redd!» Hun så opp i hans øyne – hennes egne var sorte og forskremte. «Vet du, måg – er de født her på Husaby, de andre barna til Erlend?»","""Yes, I'm scared!"" She looked into his eyes - her own were black and frightened. ""Do you know, gull - were they born here at Husaby, Erlend's other children?""","“Nay, but I am afraid!” She looked up into his eyes — her own were dark and frightened. “Know you, brother-in-law — were they born here at Husaby, Erlend’s other children?”","“Yes, of course, I’m afraid!” She looked up into his eyes—her own were dark and frightened. “Can you tell me, brother-in-law, whether they were born here at Husaby—Erlend’s other children?”"

"Husabyfolket skulle sove i høyenloftet, og efter måltidet, mens mere drikke ble båret frem for mennene, tok Kristin og hennes terner barna bort i en krok for å kle av dem. De hadde sølt seg slik til med maten at moren ville vaske litt av dem. Men de små ville ikke vaskes, og de store skvettet vann, og alle fór de hit og dit i stuen mellom hvert plagg kvinnene fikk plukket av dem. Til slutt var de dog alle kommet opp i den ene sengen, men der ble de ved å ståke og tumle og puffe hverandre og le og hyle, og puter og åklær og laken ble slengt hit og dit så støvet føk og det luktet høymo utover hele stuen. Kristin lo og sa likesæl at de var så opprømte av det de var på et fremmed sted.","The Husabi people were to sleep in the hayloft, and after the meal, while more drinks were being served to the men, Kristin and her terns took the children away in a corner to undress them. They had so spilled the food that their mother wanted to wash some of them. But the little ones did not want to be washed, and the big ones splashed water, and they all went here and there in the living room between each garment the women got to pick from them. In the end, however, they had all gotten up in one bed, but there they remained by stumbling and tumbling and pushing each other and laughing and howling, and pillows and clothes and the sheets were thrown here and there so dusty dust and it smelled loudly all over living room. Kristin laughed and said equally that they were so elated by what they were in a strange place.","The children’s mother and father spoke to them, indeed, and bade them sit down prettily and be quiet; but the children paid no heed; and the parents, on their side, laughed at them the whole time and seemed to think their ill behaviour no great matter — not even when Lavrans, somewhat sharply, bade one of the serving-men take the dogs down into the room below, so that folks might be able to hear themselves speak in the upper hall.","Everyone from Husaby was to sleep in the loft of the main house, and after the meal, while more ale was being brought in for the men, Kristin and her maids took the children over to a corner of the hall to undress them. They had gotten so dirty while eating that their mother wanted to wash them up a bit. But the youngest boys refused to be washed, and the older ones splashed the water, and then all of them started rushing around the hall as the maids pulled one piece of clothing after another off them. Finally they were all put into one bed, but they continued to yell and play and shove each other, laughing and shrieking. Pillows and coverlets and sheets were hurled this way and that, making dust fly, and the smell of chaff filled the whole room. Kristin laughed and explained calmly that they were so high-spirited from being in a strange place."
"Så var det bare det ene for henne – ikke kny eller klage hva som nu skulle gå over henne ved denne manns side. Svimlende langt tilbake i tiden syntes hun nu at hun hadde forlatt sin far. Men hun så hans elskede ansikt, husket hans ord den dagen i smien da hun drev det siste knivsting i hans hjerte, husket da de taltes ved der oppe på fjellet i den stund hun skjønte at dødens dør stod på glytt bak hennes far. Uverdig er det å klage over den lagnad en selv har valgt seg –.

"Ramborg var gått i seng til ære for gjesten. Hun hadde pyntet seg med silkeskaut og en rød trøye med hvite skinnkanter over brystet, hadde silketrukne puter bak ryggen og et blommet fløyelsklede over sengeteppene. Foran sengen stod Ulvhild Simonsdatters vugge. Det var den gamle svenskevuggen som Ramborg Sunesdatter hadde ført med til Norge; i den hadde Kristins far og farfar, hun selv og alle hennes søsken ligget. Efter skikk og bruk skulle hun som den eldste datteren fått denne vuggen med i sitt hjemmefølge, men den var ikke blitt nevnt da hun giftet seg. Hun hadde nok skjønt foreldrene glemte den med vilje – aktet de ikke Erlends og hennes barn verdige til å sove i den –.","Ramborg had gone to bed in honor of the guest. She had adorned herself with a silk scarf and a red sweater with white leather edges over her chest, had silk-drawn pillows behind her back and a floral velvet cloth over the bedspreads. In front of the bed stood Ulvhild Simonsdatter's cradle. It was the old Swedish cradle that Ramborg Sunesdatter had brought to Norway; in it Kristin's father and grandfather, she and all her siblings had lain. According to custom, she, as the eldest daughter, was to have this cradle in her home party, but it had not been mentioned when she got married. She had probably realized that her parents forgot it on purpose - they did not consider Erlends and her children worthy of sleeping in it -.","On the way down through Gudbrandsdal, too, the body was to be taken into certain churches over-night — and these were all remembered in Lavrans’ testament with money-gifts and wax tapers. Kristin felt sick, but it was with sorrow and disquiet of soul. For she could not hide from herself — it hurt her the more, the longer she was at home.","Ramborg was lying in bed, in honor of her guest.

She thought that her parents had purposely forgotten about the cradle. Didn’t they think the children she and Erlend would have were worthy to sleep in it?"
FØRST PÅ VÅREN REISTE Simon Andressøn nord på Toten for å hente sin hustru og sin spede sønn og følge dem hjem til Formo.

"Urolig og tungsindig som hun var, trettet det henne litt når Simon snakket om sine egne saker, gården og barna. Hun skjønte selv at det var urimelig; han var villig til å hjelpe henne av all sin evne, hun så at det var vakkert han ville fare fra hjemmet i julehelgen og fra sin kone, når det stod slik til – han tenkte sikkert meget på om han nu skulle få en sønn, han hadde jo bare det ene barnet med Ramborg, enda de hadde snart vært gift i seks år. Hun kunne ikke vente at han skulle ta seg hennes og Erlends ulykke slik til hjerte at han derover aldeles skulle glemme all glede ved sine egne gode kår – men det var underlig å gå sammen med ham her, han syntes så glad og varm og trygg i hjemmet sitt.","Restless and melancholy as she was, it tired her a little when Simon talked about his own affairs, the farm and the children. She herself realized that it was unreasonable; he was willing to help her with all his might, she saw that it was beautiful he would leave home during the Christmas weekend and from his wife, when it was like that - he probably thought a lot about whether he should have a son, he had only one child with Ramborg, even though they had soon been married for six years. She could not expect him to take her and Erlend's misfortune to heart so much that he would completely forget all the joy of his own good conditions - but it was strange to go with him here, he seemed so happy and warm and safe in his home.","Restless and heavy of heart as she was, it wearied her a little when Simon talked of his own affairs, his estates and the children. She saw herself that there was no reason in it; he was ready to help her with all his might; she saw that ’twas most good of him to be willing to leave his home at Yule-tide, and to be parted from his wife at a time like this — he surely was thinking much on whether he would soon have a son now — for he had only the one child by Ramborg as yet, though they would soon have been wedded six years. She could not look that he should take her mischance and Erlend’s so much to heart as quite to forget all joy in his own happy lot; but it was strange to go about with him here, and see him so joyful and warm and secure in his own home.","Uneasy and dejected as she now felt, it made her weary to listen to Simon talk about his own affairs: his manor and his children. She knew she was being unreasonable; he was willing to do all he could to help her. She realized how good it was of him to agree to leave his home during the Christmas season, and to be away from his wife, as things now stood. No doubt he was thinking a great deal about whether he might have a son. He had only the one child with Ramborg, even though they had been married six years. Kristin couldn’t expect that he should take Erlend’s and her misfortune so much to heart that he would forget all the joy he had from his own life.

"Han tok henne ved hånden. Hun fant seg i det, men gikk og så ned hvor hun satte føttene sine. Det varte ikke lenge før de var oppe på høyden.

She didn’t resist, but walked with her eyes downcast, looking at where she set her feet. It wasn’t long before they were up on the heights. Beyond the bare, frost-covered forest, in the crook of the little river, Husaby lay on the mountain slope directly across from them, looming big and grand with the stone church and all its massive buildings, surrounded by the broad acres, and the dark forested ridge behind."
"Han hadde vært i byen noen dager da fru Sunnivas terne kom til ham i Gregoriuskirken en kveld.

"DENNE SOMMEREN, LIKE FØR JONSVAKA, vendte Gunnulf Nikulaussøn tilbake til sitt kloster. Erlend var i byen under Frostatinget; han sendte bud hjem og lot spørre sin kone om hun trodde hun orket dra inn og hilse på mågen. Kristin hadde det bare måtelig, men hun fór dog. Da hun møttes med Erlend, sa denne at broren syntes ham aldeles helsebrutt. De hadde ikke hatt synderlig fremgang med sitt tiltak, brødrene, der nord i Munkefjord. Kirken som de hadde bygget, fikk de aldri innviet, for erkebiskopen kunne ikke fare nord i disse urostider; de hadde hele tiden måttet si messe ved sitt reisealter. Til slutt kom de i mangel på både brød og vin og lys og olje til tjenestene, og da broder Gunnulf og broder Aslak skulle seile til Vargøy for å hente det, hadde finnene gandet, så de kullseilte og måtte sitte tre døgn på et skjær; siden hadde de begge vært syke, og broder Aslak døde efter noen tids forløp. De hadde lidd meget av skjørbuk i langfasten, for de manglet både melmat og urter til den tørre fisken. Så hadde biskop Håkon av Bergen og mester Arne, som stod i spissen for domkapitlet i Nidaros mens herr Pål var ved kurien og ble innviet, befalt de munkene som enda var i live, å vende hjem, og prestene på Vargøy skulle røkte hjorden i Munkefjord inntil videre.","THIS SUMMER, JUST BEFORE JONSVAKA, Gunnulf Nikulaussøn returned to his convent. Erlend was in town during the Frostating; he sent word home and asked his wife if she thought she could go in and greet her brother-in-law. Kristin was only moderate, but she went anyway. When she met Erlend, he said that his brother thought he was completely ill. They had not made much progress with their initiative, the brothers, up north in Munkefjord. The church they had built was never consecrated, for the archbishop could not go north during these times of unrest; they had always had to say Mass at their altar. In the end they came in want of both bread and wine and light and oil to the services, and when Brother Gunnulf and Brother Aslak were to sail to Vargøy to fetch it, the Finns had the gand, so they sailed coal and had to sit for three days on a reef; since then they had both been ill, and Brother Aslak died after some time. They had suffered a lot from scurvy in the long fast, because they lacked both flour and herbs for the dry fish. Then Bishop Håkon of Bergen and Master Arne, who headed the cathedral chapter in Nidaros while Mr. Pål was at the curia and was consecrated, ordered the monks who were still alive to return home, and the priests on Vargøy were to smoke the flock in Munkefjord until further.","THAT summer, just before St. John’s Mass, Gunnulf Nikulaussön came back to his cloister. Erlend was in the city then for the Frosta Thing; he sent word to his wife asking her if she deemed she was able to come in thither to meet her brother-in-law. Kristin was none too well, but yet she came. When she met Erlend, he told her that his brother’s health seemed to him quite broken down. They had made but little speed with their undertaking in the north, the Friars of Munkefjord. The church they had built they could never get consecrated, for the Archbishop could not journey so far north in these unquiet times; they had had to say mass the whole time at their travelling-altar. At length they came to lack both bread and wine and candles and oil for the services; and when Brother Gunnulf and Brother Aslak set sail for Vargöy to fetch these things, the Lapps had cast a spell on them, so that they capsized and had to sit for three days and nights on a rocky islet — after this they both fell sick, and Brother Aslak died some time after. They had suffered much from scurvy in the Long Fast, for they lacked both meal and herbs to eat with the dry fish. Therefore had Bishop Haakon of Björgvin and Master Arne (who were at the head of the Cathedral Chapter at Nidaros while the new Archbishop, Sir Paal, was gone to the Curia to be consecrated) ordered the monks who yet lived to come back home, and that the priests of Vargöy should tend the flock at Munkefjord till further order.","THAT SUMMER, JUST before Saint Jon’s Day, Gunnulf Niku laussøn returned to his monastery. Erlend was in town during the Frosta ting; he sent a message home, asking his wife whether she would care to come to Nidaros to see her brother-in-law. Kristin wasn’t feeling very well, but she went all the same. When she met Erlend, he told her that his brother’s health seemed completely broken. The friars hadn’t had much success with their endeavors up north at Munkefjord. They never managed to have the church they had built consecrated, because the archbishop couldn’t travel north during a time of such unrest. Finally they ended up with no bread or wine, candles or oil for the services, but when Brother Gunnulf and Brother Aslak sailed for Vargøy for supplies, the Finns cast their spells and the ship sank. They were stranded on a skerry for three days, and afterwards neither of them regained his full health. Brother Aslak died a short time later. They had suffered terribly from scurvy during Lent, for they had no flour or herbs to eat along with the dried fish. Then Bishop Haakon of Bjørgvin and Master Arne, who was in charge of the cathedral chapter while Lord Paal was at the Curia to be ordained as archbishop, instructed the monks who were still alive to return home; the priests at Vargøy were to tend to the flocks at Munkefjord for the time being."

"Efter Frostatinget for Erlend hjem til Husaby med hustruen, barna og Simon Darre, som nu hadde sin søstersønn, Gjavvald Gjavvaldssøn, hos seg. Han var redd for at dette gjensynet, som Sigrid hadde gledet seg så usigelig til, skulle ikke falle godt ut. Sigrid på Kruke satt i gode kår, hadde tre vakre barn med sin husbond, og Geirmund var så god en mann som kunne trede på jorden; det var han som hadde talt med mågen sin om dette at han måtte få Gjavvald med syd så moren kunne få se ham – for det barnet var aldri ute av Sigrids tanker. Men Gjavvald var slik tilvent hos farsforeldrene – de gamle folkene elsket barnet aldeles uvettig, gav ham alt han pekte på, og føyde ham i alle påfunn – og det var ikke slik på Kruke som på Ranheim. Uventelig var det også at Geirmund skulle like det når hans hustrus frillesønn kom på gjesting og hadde vaner som et kongsbarn – sin egen svenn, en eldre mann, som ungen styrte med og bød over og som ikke torde kny mot noen urimelighet av gutten. Men for Erlendssønnene ble det marknadstider da Gjavvald kom i gården. Erlend syntes ikke at hans sønner trengte stå tilbake for Arne Gjavvaldssøns sønnesønn, og så fikk Nåkkve og Bjørgulf av sin far alt som de kunne fortelle at gjesten eide.","After the Frostating, Erlend went home to Husaby with his wife, children and Simon Darre, who now had his nephew, Gjavvald Gjavvaldsson, with him. He was afraid that this reunion, which Sigrid had been looking forward to so unspeakably, would not turn out well. Sigrid at Kruke was in good condition, had three beautiful children with her husband, and Geirmund was such a good man who could step on the ground; it was he who had talked to his brother-in-law about this that he had to get Gjavvald to the south so that the mother could see him - for that child was never out of Sigrid's thoughts. But Gjavvald was so accustomed to his grandparents - the old people loved the child utterly unwise, gave him everything he pointed out, and added to him in every invention - and it was not so at Kruke as at Ranheim. It was also unexpected that Geirmund would like it when his wife's free son came to visit and had habits as a king's child - his own servant, an older man, whom the boy ruled with and bid over and who did not dare to oppose any unreasonableness of the boy. But for the Erlendssønnene, there were market times when Gjavvald came to the farm. Erlend did not think that his sons needed to be left behind for Arne Gjavvaldsson's grandson, and then Nåkkve and Bjørgulf got from their father everything they could tell that the guest owned.","After the Frosta Thing, Erlend went home to Husaby with his wife and children, and with them went Simon Darre.","After the Frosta ting, Erlend went home to Husaby with his wife, children, and Simon Darre, who now had his sister’s son, Gjavvald Gjavvaldssøn, with him. He was afraid that the reunion, which Sigrid had been yearning for with inexpressible joy, would not turn out well. Sigrid now lived at Kruke in good circumstances; she had three handsome children with her husband, and Geirmund was as good a man as could be found on this earth. He was the one who had spoken to his brother-in-law about bringing Gjavvald south so that Sigrid might see him, for the child was always on her mind. But Gjavvald had grown accustomed to living with his grandpar ents, and the old couple loved the child beyond measure, giving him everything he wanted and humoring his every whim; and things were not the same at Kruke as at Ranheim. Nor was it to be expected that Geirmund would be pleased to have his wife’s bastard son come visiting and then behave like a royal child, even bringing along his own servant—an elderly man whom the boy ruled and tyrannized. The man didn’t dare say a word against any of Gjavvald’s unreasonable demands. But for Erlend’s sons, it was cause for celebration when Gjavvald came to Husaby. Erlend didn’t think his sons should have any less than the grandson of Arne Gjavvaldssøn did, and so Naakkve and Bjørgulf were given all the things they told him the boy possessed."

"Å, husfruens stille og verdige lader var like skjønne som ungmøens svaie ynde, hun var bredere over barmen og hoftene, men hun var også høyere; hun holdt seg rank, og halsen bar det lille runde hode like stolt og deilig.

"Det var som en lav gressgrodd hylle under en bergvegg som lutet utover bekken. Lavrans hektet av seg kappen, foldet den sammen og drog datteren ned til sete med seg på den.

"Hun hadde nok følt et sting av smerte og skam ved det, men hun hadde måttet le med Erlend. Vinteren og våren hadde gått for henne i en rus av munterhet og lykke.

"Hun var tung om hjertet av angst og uro, men hun prøvde å streve seg fra det. Ett var at hun skjønte seg ikke på Erlend – enda syntes han intet å ane. Men det andre og det verste var at hun kjente ikke liv hos barnet hun bar. Ved tyve uker skulle det kvikne, visste hun – nu var det gått mere enn tre uker over den tiden. Hun lå om nettene og kjente denne byrden som vokste og gjordes tyngre og ble ved å være like dump og livløs. Og det svev for henne alt hun hadde hørt om barn som var født lamme, med størknede sener, om fostre som var kommet til lyset uten lemmer – som neppe hadde hatt menneskelig skapning. For hennes lukkede øyne drog bilder av små, spede barn, redselsfullt vanskapte; det ene skrekkens syn smeltet over i et enda verre. Syd i dalen hjemme, på Lidstad, hadde de et barn – ja, det var vel voksent nu. Hennes far hadde sett det, men han ville aldri tale om det; hun hadde merket at han ble ille ved når noen nevnte det. Hvordan det monne se ut –. Å nei. Hellig Olav, be for meg –! Hun måtte tro fast på den hellige konges miskunn, hun hadde jo gitt sitt barn i hans varetekt, med tålmod skulle hun lide for sine synder og trøste seg med hel hug til hjelp og nåde for barnet. Fienden selv måtte det være som fristet henne med disse stygge synene for å lokke henne til fortvilelse –. Men det var vondt om nettene. Hvis et barn ikke hadde lemmer, hvis det var lamt, så kunne vel moren ikke kjenne livstegn –. Erlend merket i halvsøvne at hustruen lå urolig, tok henne tettere inn i armen sin og dukket sitt ansikt inn til hennes halsgrop.","She was heavy at heart with anxiety and restlessness, but she tried to strive from it. One was that she did not understand Erlend - he still did not seem to have any idea. But the second and worst thing was that she did not feel life in the child she was carrying. At twenty weeks it would recover, she knew - now more than three weeks had passed over that time. She lay at night and felt this burden that grew and became heavier and remained just as dull and lifeless. And it hovered for her all she had heard about children born lame, with clotted tendons, about fetuses who had come to light without limbs - who had hardly had human creation. Before her closed eyes drew images of small, infant children, terribly deformed; the sight of one horror melted into an even worse one. South of the valley at home, at Lidstad, they had a child - yes, it was probably an adult now. Her father had seen it, but he would never talk about it; she had noticed that he got sick when someone mentioned it. What it might look like -. Oh no. Saint Olav, pray for me -! She had to firmly believe in the mercy of the holy king, she had given her child into his care, with patience she would suffer for her sins and comfort herself with all her heart for help and grace for the child. The enemy himself must have tempted her with these ugly visions to entice her to despair. But it hurt at night. If a child did not have limbs, if it was paralyzed, then the mother could not feel signs of life -. Erlend noticed in his half-sleep that the wife was restless, took her closer into her arm and dipped his face into her throat.","She was heavy at heart with unrest and fear, but she tried to forget it in work. One thing was that she understood not Erlend — even now he seemed to suspect nothing. But another and a worse trouble was that she could feel no life in the child she bore within her. At twenty weeks it should quicken, she knew — and now more than three weeks over the twenty had gone by. She lay awake at night and felt the burden within her that grew greater and heavier, but was still as dull and lifeless as ever. And there floated through her mind all she had heard of children that were born crippled, with sinews stiff as stone, of births that had come to the light without limbs — with scarce a semblance of human shape. Before her tight-shut eyes would pass pictures of little infants, dreadfully misshapen; one shape of horror melting into another still worse. Southward in the dale at home, at Lidstad, the folks had a child — nay, it must be grown up now. Her father had seen it, but would never speak of it; she had marked that he grew ill at ease if anyone but named aught of it. What did it look like? — Oh, no! Holy Saint Olav, pray for me! — She must needs trust firmly on the holy King’s tender mercy; had she not placed her child under His ward? She would suffer for her sins in meekness, and with her whole heart have faith that there would be help and mercy for the child. It must be the Enemy himself that tempted her with these ugly visions, to drive her to despair. But her nights were evil. … If a child had no limbs, if it were palsied, like enough the mother would feel no sign of life within her. … Erlend, half waking, marked that his wife was restless, drew her closer into his arms, and laid his face against the hollow of her throat.","Her heart was heavy with fear and anguish, but she struggled to free herself. Part of her worry was that she didn’t understand Erlend—he still didn’t seem to notice anything. But the other part, and this was worse, was that she couldn’t feel any life in the child she was carrying. She knew that at twenty weeks it should begin to move; now it was more than three weeks past that time. At night she would lie in bed and feel this burden which was growing and becoming heavier but which continued to be as dull and lifeless as ever. And hovering in her thoughts was all that she had heard about children who were born lame, with hardened sinews; about creatures that came to light without limbs, that had almost no human form. Before her closed eyes passed images of tiny infants, hideously deformed; one horrific sight melted into another that was even worse. In the south of Gudbrandsdal, at Lidstad, they had a child—well, it must be full grown by now. Her father had seen it, but he would never speak of it; she noticed that he grew distressed if anyone even mentioned it. She wondered how it looked . . . Oh, no. Holy Olav, pray for me! She must believe firmly in the beneficence of the Holy King. She had given her child into his care, after all. With patience she would suffer for her sins and place her faith, with all her soul, in help and mercy for the child. It must be the Fiend himself who was tempting her with these loathsome sights in order to lure her into despair. But it was worse at night. If a child had no limbs, if it was lame, then the mother would doubtless feel no sign of life. Half-asleep, Erlend noticed that his wife was uneasy. He folded her tighter into his arms and buried his face in the hollow of her neck."

"Kristus, du korsfestede. Nu har jeg solgt fra meg alt som kunne binde meg. Meg selv har jeg solgt deg i hender, om du vil verdiges med mitt liv å kjøpe fri Satans hjon.

Myself have I given into Thy hands, if Thou wilt deign with my life to buy Satan’s household free.

"Det var femte dagen efter hallvardsmesse. Det regnet støtt og mildt. Da Kristin kom ut i tunet, kjente hun i det blide sønnendrag muldlukten fra nypløyde og gjødslede åkrer. Bygden lå brun under vårregnet, luften blånet mellom de høye fjelle, og skodden drev halvveis oppe i liene. Det pinglet av småbjeller fra lundene langs den vannmette, grå elv – geiteflokken var utsluppen og gikk og nippet i de knoppfulle kvister. Det var slikt vær som alltid hadde frydet hennes fars hjerte, slutt på vinter og kulde for folk og for fe, bølingene forløst fra trange, mørke fjøs og knapp næring.","It was the fifth day after the Hallvard Mass. It rained steadily and mildly. When Kristin came out into the yard, she felt in the gentle sunshine the smell of soil from freshly plowed and fertilized fields. The settlement was brown during the spring rain, the air was blue between the high mountains, and the shutter drifted halfway up the slopes. Small bells rang from the groves along the water-saturated, gray river - the flock of goats had escaped and sipped in the budding twigs. It was such weather that had always delighted her father's heart, end of winter and cold for people and for cattle, the bullies released from cramped, dark barns and scarce nourishment.","It was the fifth day after Halvard’s Mass. Rain was falling gently and steadily. When Kristin came out into the courtyard, there came to her on the soft breath of air from the south the smell of fields new-ploughed and dressed. The country-side lay brown under the spring rain, the air was blue between the high mountains, and the mists drifted along halfway up the hill-sides. A tinkling of little bells came from the thickets along the brimming grey river — the flocks of goats had been let loose, and were nibbling at the blossoming twigs. ’ Twas the weather that had ever rejoiced her father’s heart, the end of winter and cold for folk and for cattle, the beasts all set free from narrow dark byres and scanty forage.","It was the fifth day after the Feast of Saint Halvard. It was raining lightly but steadily. When Kristin went out into the courtyard, she noticed in the gentle southern wind the earthy smell of newly plowed and manured fields. The countryside was brown in the spring rain, the sky was pale blue between the high mountains, and the mist was drifting by, halfway up the slopes. The ringing of little bells came from the groves of trees along the swollen gray river; herds of goats had been let out, and they were nibbling at the bud-covered branches. This was the kind of weather that had always filled her father’s heart with joy. The cold of winter was over for both people and livestock, the animals were finally released from their dark, narrow stalls and scanty fodder."

"Mor sin hadde hun aldri stått nær, hennes søstre hadde vært småbarn da hun var voksen mø, lekefeller hadde hun aldri hatt. Hun var fostret mellom menn, og hun hadde helt kunnet gi seg hen i å være blid og bløt, for alltid hadde der vært menn om henne som holdt skjermende og vernende hender mellom henne og alt i verden. Nu syntes det henne så rimelig at hun selv fødte bare sønner, fikk svennbarn å fostre med sitt blod og ved sitt bryst, elske og skjerme og pleie til de ble så store at de kunne trede inn mellom mennene. Hun husket at hun hadde hørt om en dronning som hadde hatt det tilnavn Drengemoder. Hun hadde vel hatt et gjerde om sin barnestue av vaktsomme menn –.","She had never been close to her mother, her sisters had been small children when she was an adult girl, she had never had playmates. She was fostered between men, and she could have completely given in to being gentle and soft, for there had always been men around her who held protective and protective hands between her and everything in the world. Now it seemed so reasonable to her that she herself gave birth to only sons, had sons-in-law to foster with her blood and by her breast, to love and shield and care until they became so large that they could enter between the men. She remembered that she had heard of a queen who had the nickname Boy Mother. She must have had a fence around her nursery of vigilant men -.","Something had gone awry between her and Erlend in those first days, and ’twas like it could never be made straight again.","Kristin hadn’t been close to her mother. Her sisters were mere children when she was already a grown maiden, and she had never had companions to play with. She was brought up among men; she was able to be gentle and soft because there had always been men around to hold up protective and shielding hands between her and everything else in the world. Now it seemed reasonable to her that she gave birth only to sons—boys to nurse with her blood and at her breast, to love and protect and care for until they were old enough to join the ranks of men. She remembered that she had heard of a queen who was called the Mother of Boys. She must have had a wall of watchful men around her when she was a child."

"Hun hadde ikke sett ham drukken mere enn en eneste gang siden hun kom hjem – en kveld i bryllupet på Formo. Da hadde han ravet noe og vært tykkmælt, men han hadde ikke vært særlig lystig.

"«Ja, jeg ville nu også vært en underlig gave å gi til Sankt Olav,» sa Erlend og lo litt. «Han ville vært ille tjent med meg. – Men du har da sagt det, Gunnulf, at du var vel fornøyd med det at du ble kalt til prest fra barnsben av –»","""Yes, I would now also be a strange gift to give to Saint Olav,"" Erlend said, laughing a little.

"Det var nu langt ute i slaktemåneden, men enda var det ikke falt sne her i bygden.

"Alle vegne fra mørket tittet guttenes hoder ut. Hun gikk til den nordre sengen, hvor de tre eldste sov, bad dem legge seg ned og lukke døren.

"Da slo han armene opp omkring sitt hode, kastet seg ned på benken og virret og vred seg. Kristin satte seg ned et lite stykke borte – hun skjønte at denne vanskjebne falt enda meget tyngre på ham fordi han selv hadde syndet mot andre slik som det nu var blitt syndet mot ham.

"Nu var solen under åsen – gullglansen bleknet, og rødmen ble mere rosenrød og blid. Efter klokkeklangen var tystnet, vokste suset fra skogen og bredte seg utover igjen; den vesle bekken gjennom løvskogen nede i dalen lød sterkere opp. Fra hagen like ved kom den kjente klunkingen av hjemmefeets bjeller, en flyvende skalvinge surret en halv gang omkring henne og ble borte.","Now the sun was under the hill - the golden luster faded, and the blush became more rosy and gentle.

"Hun hadde prøvd å tale med Sira Eiliv om det. Men han kunne ikke hjelpe henne her. Gunnulf hadde sagt de synder som hun hadde skriftet og bøtet før Eiliv Serkssøn ble hennes sogneprest, dem trengte hun ikke nevne for ham uten hun selv skjønte han måtte kjenne dem for å kunne dømme og råde i hennes saker. Så var det meget som hun ikke var kommet til å si ham, enda hun selv følte hun kom derved til å stå i Sira Eilivs øyne som et bedre menneske enn hun var. Men det var så godt for henne å eie denne gode og renhjertede manns vennskap. Erlend gjønte med det – men hun hadde sånn trøst av Sira Eiliv. Med ham kunne hun tale så meget hun ville om sine barn; alle de småtidender som hun kjedet Erlend på dør med, dem gadd presten drøfte med henne. Han hadde slikt lag med småbarn og god forstand på deres små plager og sykdommer. Erlend lo av henne når hun selv gikk i ildhuset og laget kråsedisker som hun sendte inn til prestehuset – det var sånn at Sira Eiliv var glad i god mat og drikke – og det moret henne å sysle med slikt og prøve det som hun hadde lært hos sin mor eller sett i klostret. Erlend var likeglad hva han åt, bare han alltid fikk kjøtt når det ikke var faste. Men Sira Eiliv kom og snakket og takket og priste hennes dyktighet når hun hadde sendt ham et spidd med rypekyllinger i kapper av fint flesk eller en disk med rentunger i franskvin og honning.","She had tried to talk to Sira Eiliv about it. But he could not help her here. Gunnulf had said the sins she had confessed and repented before Eiliv Serkssøn became her parish priest, she did not need to mention them to him but she herself understood he had to know them in order to judge and rule in her cases. Then there was much that she had not come to tell him, even though she herself felt that she would thereby stand in Sira Eiliv's eyes as a better person than she was. But it was so good for her to have this good and pure-hearted man's friendship. Erlend laughed at that - but she was so comforted by Sira Eiliv. With him she could talk as much as she wanted about her children; all the little tidings that she bored Erlend at the door with, the priest bothered to discuss them with her. He had such a team with toddlers and a good sense of their little ailments and diseases. Erlend laughed at her when she herself went to the firehouse and made croissants which she sent to the parsonage - it was as if Sira Eiliv loved good food and drink - and it amused her to do such things and try what she had learned from his mother or seen in the convent. Erlend did not care what he ate, only he always got meat when it was not fasting. But Sira Eiliv came and talked and thanked and praised her skill when she had sent him a skewer with grouse chickens in coats of fine pork or a plate of reindeer tongues in French wine and honey.","She had tried to speak of it with Sira Eiliv. But here he could not help her. Gunnulf had said the sins she had confessed and done penance for, before Eiliv Serkssön came to be her father confessor, she need not name to him unless she saw that he must know them in order that he might judge and counsel in her concerns. So there was much that she had never told him, though she felt herself that thus she had come to seem in Sira Eiliv’s eyes a better woman than she was. But yet ’twas so comforting for her to have the friendship of this good and pure-hearted man. Erlend mocked — but she had so much comfort from Sira Eiliv. With him she could talk as much as she would of her children; all the little things that she wearied Erlend to death with, the priest was ready to talk over with her. He had a way with little children, and good skill in their little troubles and sicknesses. Erlend laughed at her when she went herself to the kitchen and cooked dainty dishes to send to the priest’s house — for Sira Eiliv was fond or good food and drink, and it pleased her to busy herself with such things and try her hand with what she had learnt from her mother or seen in the cloister. Erlend cared not what he ate, if one but let him have flesh-meat at all times, when ’twas not a fast. But Sira Eiliv came and talked and thanked her and praised her skill when she had sent him a spitful of young ptarmigans in wrappings of fine bacon, or a dish of reindeer’s tongues in French wine and honey.","Kristin had tried to talk to Sira Eiliv about it. But he couldn’t help her with this matter. Gunnulf had told her that she need not mention the sins to which she had confessed and repented before Eiliv Serkssøn became her parish priest unless she thought that he should know about them in order to judge and advise her. So there were many things she had never told him, even though she felt that by not doing so she would seem, in Sira Eiliv’s eyes, to be a better person than she was. But it was so good for her to have the friendship of this kind and pure-hearted man. Erlend made fun of her, but she gained such comfort from Sira Eiliv. With him she could talk as much as she liked about her children; the priest was willing to discuss with her all the small bits of news that bored Erlend and drove him from the room. The priest got on well with children, and he understood their small troubles and illnesses. Erlend laughed at Kristin when she went to the cookhouse herself to prepare special dishes, which she would send over to the parsonage. Sira Eiliv was fond of good food and drink, and it amused Kristin to spend time on such matters and to try out what she had learned from her mother or seen at the convent. Erlend didn’t care what he ate as long as he was always served meat if it wasn’t a time for fasting. But Sira Eiliv would come over to talk and thank her, praising her skill after she had sent him grouse on a spit, wrapped in the best bacon, or a platter of reindeer tongues in French wine and honey."

"«Ja du kjenner til det som hendte i dalen her i høst,» spurte Erling. «Ikke det? Du vet da vel det at han for rundt selv til sysselmennene omkring Mjøs og oppefter dalen med brev at bøndene skulle gjøre ut full leidang i kost og hester – seks bønder om én hest – og herresveinene skulle sende hester, men selv få lov til å sitte hjemme? Har du ikke spurt dette? Og at norddølene nektet å gjøre denne utredselen da Munan fulgte med Eirik Topp på tinget i Våge? Det var ellers Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn som førte motmælet – han esket Eirik til å drive inn på lovlig vis hvis noe restet på de lovlige utredsler, men han kalte det overferd mot almuen å kreve krigsstyr av bøndene for å hjelpe en dansk mann til å feide på danskekongen, og krevde kongen vår tjeneste av sin håndgangne mann, så skulle han finne at de var snare nok til å møte med gode våpen og hester og væpnede svenner – men han sendte ikke fra Jørundgård en geitebukk med en hampegrime uten kongen krevde at han selv skulle ri den til hærmøtet. Neimen, vet du ikke dette? Smid Gudleikssøn sier at Lavrans hadde lovet sine landbønder han skulle utrede leidangsfall for dem, om det ble nødvendig –»","""Yes, you know what happened in the valley this autumn,"" Erling asked. ""Not that? You know that he went around himself to the governors around Mjøs and up the valley with letters that the farmers should make a full lease of food and horses - six farmers for one horse - and the gentlemen should send horses, but even be allowed to sit at home? Have you not asked this? And that the North Døls refused to do this investigation when Munan accompanied Eirik Topp to the parliament in Våge? It was otherwise Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn who led the counter-argument - he asked Eirik to drive in legally if something remained on the legal investigations, but he called it a transfer to the commons to demand war control from the farmers to help a Danish man to sweep the Danish king , and demanded the king our service from his handcuffed husband, then he should find that they were soon enough to meet with good weapons and horses and armed servants - but he did not send from Jørundgård a goat with a hemp halter without the king demanded that he himself ride it to the army meeting. No, you do not know this? Smid Gudleikssøn says that Lavrans had promised his farmers that he would investigate lead cases for them, if necessary - »","“Aye — but you know what befell in the Dale this last autumn?” asked Erling. “You know it not? Sure you must know that he rode round himself to the Wardens, all about Mjös and up the Dale, with letters, bearing that the farmers should bring forth full levies of horses and supplies — one horse to every six farmers — and the nobles and freeholders should send horses, but might stay at home themselves? Have you not heard of this? And that the men of the northern Dale denied to furnish this levy when Munan came with Eirik Topp to the Thing at Vaage? Moreover, ’twas Lavrans Björgulfsön that led the opposers — he challenged Eirik, if there were aught outstanding from the lawful levies, to gather it in in lawful wise; but he called it high-handed oppression on the people to crave war-taxes from the farmers only to help a Danish man to wage war on the Danish King. And, should our King call for service from his King’s-men, said Lavrans, he should find them ready enough to come to tryst with good weapons and horses and men-at-arms — but he sent not from Jörundgaard so much as a he-goat in a hempen halter, except the King craved he should ride it himself to the muster. Nay, now, know you not this? Smid Gudleikssön says that Lavrans had promised his farmers he would pay their levy-fines* for them , if need should be — ”","“Well, you know what happened in the valley here last autumn,” said Erling. “You don’t? Surely you must know that he rode around to the district sheriffs of Lake Mjøsa and all along the valley carrying letters stating that the farmers should pay for provisions and horses for a full campaign3—with six farmers for each horse—and that the gentry should send horses but would be allowed to stay at home. Haven’t you heard about this? And that the men of the northern valleys refused to pay this war tax when Munan accompanied Eirik Topp to the ting in Vaage? And Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn was the one who led the opposition—he demanded that Eirik pursue a lawful course, if anything remained of the lawful taxes, but he called it an injustice against the peasantry to demand war taxes from the farmers to help a Dane in a feud with the Danish king. And yet if our king required the service of his retainers, then he would find them quick enough to respond with good weapons and horses and armed men. But he would not send from Jørundgaard even a goat with a hemp halter unless the king commanded him to ride it himself to the mustering of the army. You truly didn’t know about this? Smid Gudleikssøn says that Lavrans had promised his tenants that he would pay the campaign levies for them, if need be.”"

"Men dermed var det som hennes kraft til å holde ut var brutt. Hun skrek ut i vill angst for rien som hun kjente komme, og tigget jamrende om hjelp.

"Kristin satt ved åren og sydde; hun var i ulag og kjedet seg. Midt imot henne halvsov Margret over sin søm og gjespet innimellom; hennes barn larmet og ståket i stuen. Ragnfrid var på Formo, og de fleste av tjenestefolkene var ute. Lavrans satt i sitt høysete og Erlend øverst på ytterbenken, de hadde sjakkbrettet mellom seg og flyttet brikkene i taushet og med megen eftertanke. En gang Ivar og Skule holdt på å trekke en hvalp i to luter mellom seg, stod Lavrans opp og tok det skrikende vesle dyret fra dem; han sa intet, men satte seg til spillet igjen med hunden i fanget.","Kristin sat by the oars and sewed; she was upset and bored. Opposite her, Margret half slept over her seam and yawned occasionally; her children made noise and noise in the living room. Ragnfrid was at Formo, and most of the servants were out. Lavrans sat in his high seat and Erlend at the top of the outer bench, they had the chessboard between them and moved the pieces in silence and with much thought. Once Ivar and Skule were about to pull a puppy in two lutes between them, Lavrans got up and took the screaming little animal from them; he said nothing, but sat down to play again with the dog in his lap.","Kristin sat by the hearth, sewing; she was moody and dull. Over against her, Margret was half asleep over her seam, and yawned now and then; the children were romping noisily in the room. Ragnfrid was at Formo, and the most of the serving-folk were gone out. Lavrans sat in his high-seat, and Erlend at the upper end of the outer bench; they had the chess-board between them, and moved the pieces in silence and after much pondering. Once when Ivar and Skule seemed set on pulling a puppy into two pieces betwixt them, Lavrans rose and took the shrieking little beast from them; he said nothing, but sat down again to the game holding the puppy in his lap.","Kristin sat near the hearth, sewing. She was feeling out of sorts and bored. Right across from her was Margret, dozing over her needlework and yawning now and then. The children were noisily running about the room. Ragnfrid was at Formo, and most of the servants were elsewhere. Lavrans sat in the high seat, with Erlend at his elbow, at the end of the outer bench. They had a chessboard between them and they were moving the pieces in silence, after much reflection. Once, when Ivar and Skule were tugging on a puppy, trying to tear it in half, Lavrans stood up and took the poor howling animal away from them. He didn’t say a word, but simply sat down to his game again with the dog on his lap."
"«Nu, Ragnfrid, vil vi gå til ro,» sa han litt efter.","""Now, Ragnfrid, we will go to rest,"" he said a little later.","“Now, Ragnfrid, we will go to rest,” he said in a little.","“Now, Ragnfrid, we will go to bed,” he said after a moment."
"Det første, mens de red, syntes han å fryse; han hutret noen ganger. Så kom der litt farve i hans kinn, ansiktet livnet opp – det var som saft og liv vellet opp i ham. Simon tenkte, Erlend var visst ikke lettere å bryte enn en siljutein.","First, while riding, he seemed to freeze; he shivered sometimes. Then there was a little color in his cheek, his face came to life - it was like juice and life welled up in him. Simon thought, Erlend was certainly no easier to break than a siljutein.","At first, as they rode, he seemed to feel cold; he shivered more than once.

"Da hun gikk tilbake over tunet, så hun at det fløy gnister opp av ildhustaket.

"Simon tenkte det kunne nok høres ut som Erlend var ganske vel underrettet. Men han undret seg over Erling Vidkunssøn – trodde den forrige drottseten at Erlend Nikulaussøn eide noen evne til å dømme i slike ting, eller var det slik at Erling grep nu efter hvilken støtte som helst. Bjarkøyridderen gav nok nødig fra seg makten. Det hadde aldri kunnet sies ham på at han brukte den til sin egen fordel, men han var da heller ikke slik stilt at han trengte det. Og det sa alle, at han var med årene blitt mere og mere envis og selvrådig, og efter hvert som de andre herrene av riksrådet hadde forsøkt å reise bust mot ham, var han blitt så myndig at han gadd neppe høre noen annen manns mål.","Simon thought it might sound like Erlend was pretty well informed. But he wondered about Erling Vidkunssøn - did the previous queen think that Erlend Nikulaussøn had any ability to judge in such things, or was it the case that Erling now took any support. The Bjarkøy knight was reluctant to relinquish power. It had never been possible to tell him that he was using it to his own advantage, but he was not in such a position that he needed it either. And everyone said that over the years he had become more and more stubborn and self-willed, and as the other gentlemen of the Council of State had tried to rise up against him, he had become so mature that he hardly bothered to hear any other man's goals.","Simon deemed that all this sounded as though Erlend were well-informed of what was afoot. But he wondered at Erling Vidkunssön — did the fallen High Steward believe that Erlend Nikulaussön had the wit to form a judgment in such things, or was it that Erling was catching now at any straw within reach? Like enough, the Knight of Giske was loath to loose his grasp on power. None could ever have said of him that he used it for his own profit, but then, with his riches and his standing, he had no need to do so. And all said that as the years of his Stewardship went on he had grown more and more self-willed and wise in his own conceit, and as the other lords of the Council began more and more to withstand him, he had at last grown so masterful that he would scarce deign to listen to a word from any man.","Simon thought Erlend sounded quite well-informed. But he wondered about Erling Vidkunssøn. Did the former regent think that Erlend Nikulaussøn was capable of making decisions in such matters? Or was Erling merely grasping for any possible support? The knight from Bjarkøy would be unlikely to give up his power. He could never be accused of having used it for his own benefit, but his great wealth made this unnecessary. Everyone said that over the years he had become more and more obstinate and single-minded; and by the time the other men of the Council gradually started to oppose him, he had grown so belligerent that he hardly deigned to listen to anyone else’s opinion."
"– Men I kan banne på, Lavrans, det driver mangt i hugen til herr Knut nu – han er far til en sønn som er kong Håkons dattersønn –.»","""But you can swear, Lavrans, it drives a lot in Mr. Knut's mind now - he is the father of a son who is King Håkon's grandson -.""","“But you may make your oaths, Lavrans, many things are running in Sir Knut’s head now — he is father of a son that is King Haakon’s grandson.”","But I swear to you, Lavrans, Sir Knut has plenty of things going through his mind right now.

"De bredte ut de skinn og åklær som de hadde tatt med seg.

"Da han bare var den mann hun elsket, hadde hun aldri spurt om slikt. Hun hadde nok sett at han var brå og heftig, ubetenksom, hadde en særskilt gave til å stelle seg uklokt. Men da hadde hun funnet unnskyldninger for alt – aldri brydd seg med å tenke hva hans sinn vel kunne føre over dem begge. Når de to hadde fått lov til å gifte seg, ville alt bli annerledes – slik hadde hun trøstet seg. Undertiden demret det for henne selv at det var fra den stund hun hadde skjønt der var blitt et barn mellom dem, da var hun begynt å tenke. Hvordan var Erlend, som folk kalte lettsindig og uklok, en mann som ingen kunne forlate seg på –.","Since he was just the man she loved, she had never asked for such a thing.

"Hun så, selv på den lille rørslen, han var ikke ledig og spenstig mere. Hun hadde sett og ikke festet seg ved det før – han sprang ikke lenger i og av sadelen så lett som han hadde gjort, han løp ikke i en loftstrapp, løftet ikke en tung ting sånn som før. Han førte sitt legeme stivere og mere forsiktig – som han bar en slumrende smerte i kroppen og fór stilt for ikke å vekke den. Blodet banket synlig i halsårene når han kom inn fra et ritt. Somme tider hadde hun sett at han var som svullen eller pløset under øynene – hun husket en morgen hun kom inn i stuen, lå han halvkledd i sengen med nakne ben utover sengestokken; moren satt på huk foran og gned hans ankelledd.","She saw, even on the small stir, he was no longer free and resilient. She had seen and not attached herself to it before - he no longer ran in and out of the saddle as easily as he had done, he did not run up an attic staircase, did not lift a heavy thing as before. He moved his body stiffer and more gently - as he carried a dormant pain in his body and calmed down so as not to wake it. The blood was visibly throbbing in his veins when he came in from a ride. Sometimes she had seen that he was swollen or plucked under the eyes - she remembered one morning when she came into the living room, he was lying half-naked in bed with bare legs over the bed; the mother squatted in front and rubbed his ankle joint.","She saw, even in this little movement, he was no longer springy and nimble as of old. She had seen before without marking it — he no longer leapt into the saddle as lightly as he had done; he ran no longer up a loft-stairway; he lifted not a heavy thing easily as he was wont to do. He bore his body more stiffly and carefully — as if he had a slumbering pain within him and went softly so as not to wake it. The blood could be seen beating in his neck-veins when he came in from riding. Sometimes she had seen what seemed swellings or pouches under his eyes — and she remembered that one morning when she came into the hall he lay half dressed in the bed with his naked legs over the bed-foot, and her mother was crouched in front of him, chafing his ankle-joints.","She saw, even from that slight movement, that he was no longer agile or spry. She had noticed before but refused to acknowledge it.

He carried his body more rigidly and carefully—as if he bore some slumbering pain within and was moving quietly so as not to arouse it.

"SIMON DARRE HADDE TATT det som noe som så skulle være, da hans far avtalte giftermålet med Lavrans Bjørgulfssøns datter for ham. De hadde alltid brukt det i hans slekt, at foreldrene rådet med slikt. Han var blitt glad da han så bruden var så vakker og yndefull. Forresten hadde han aldri tenkt annet enn at han skulle bli gode venner med den konen faren valgte til ham. Kristin og han høvde sammen i alder og velstand og byrd – var Lavrans noe mere høyættet, så var hans far ridder og hadde stått kong Håkon nær, mens den andre alltid hadde levd stille på sine gårder.

They had always used it in his family, that the parents advised with such. He had become happy when he saw the bride was so beautiful and graceful. By the way, he had never thought otherwise than that he would become good friends with the wife his father chose for him. Kristin and he lived together in age and prosperity and burden - if Lavrans was somewhat more noble, then his father was a knight and had been close to King Håkon, while the other had always lived quietly on his farms.

He had, indeed, never looked for aught else than that he should be good friends with the wife his father chose for him. Kristin and he suited each other well in age and birth and fortune — if Lavrans were of a somewhat higher kin, his father, on his side, was a knight and had been much about King Haakon, while the other had always lived retired on his estates. And Simon had never marked aught else than that wedded folk agreed well together when they were an equal match.","SIMON DARRE HAD accepted it as only proper when his father had arranged the marriage with Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn’s daughter for him. It had always been the custom in his family for the parents to make these decisions. He was pleased when he saw that his betrothed was so beautiful and charming. And he had always thought that he would be good friends with the woman his father had chosen for him. He and Kristin were well-suited in age and wealth and birth. Lavrans may have come from a somewhat better lineage, but Simon’s father was a knight and had been close to King Haakon, while Lavrans had always lived quietly on his estates. And Simon had never seen married couples not get on well together, as long as they were equals."
"En kveld like før, mens de ståket som verst med å gjøre rede til gjestebudet, sa Simon i spøk han skjønte ikke hvordan det skulle gå med huset hans når Sigrid for fra ham. Da sa Ramborg:","One night just before, while they were struggling to prepare for the feast, Simon jokingly said he did not understand how his house would go when Sigrid left him.

"Kristin lå og så på elghudsbeltet om hans dryge midje.

Hun husket da Simon fikk dette – straks før faren døde, hadde han villet gi Simon sitt forgylte stasbelte og sølv til å få gjort så mange flere plater at mågen kunne passe det. Men Simon bad om å få dette – og da Lavrans sa at nu snøt han seg selv, mente Simon at dolken var dog et kostbart stykke. «Ja, og så kniven,» sa Ragnfrid og smilte litt, og mennene lo og sa, ja kniven, ja.

She remembered when Simon got this - just before his father died, he had wanted to give Simon his gilded stasis belt and silver to make so many more plates that the gull could fit it. But Simon asked for this - and when Lavrans said that now he was sniffing himself, Simon thought that the dagger was an expensive piece. ""Yes, and then the knife,"" said Ragnfrid, smiling a little, and the men laughed and said, yes, the knife, yes. About this knife the father and mother had had so many quarrels; Ragnfrid resented the day's shock at seeing the ugly, wretched knife by the man's belt.

It was a daily and hourly vexation to Ragnfrid to see such an ugly, paltry thing at her husband’s belt.

"Kristin ble ved å bo nede i lillestuen med barnet også efter hun hadde gjort sin kirkegang.

Hun hadde skriftet for ham, men for den synd som hun hadde gjort da hun ble medskyldig i et annet menneskes usalige død, måtte hun søke avløsning hos erkebiskopen. Hin morgen da Gunnulf hadde sittet med henne i hennes sjelevånde, hadde han lagt henne på hjertet at så snart som hun var fridd ut av legemlig livsfare, måtte hun ile med å søke helsebot for sin sjel. Så snart hun fikk igjen helsen til det, skulle hun holde sitt løfte til Sankt Olav. Nu hadde han ved sine forbønner berget hennes sønn sunn og levende til lyset og dåpens bad, nu skulle hun gå barføtt til hans grav og legge ned der sin gullkrans, møenes æressmykke, som hun hadde verget så dårlig og båret med urette.

The other morning when Gunnulf had sat with her in her anguish of soul, he had put it on her heart that as soon as she was freed from the danger of bodily life, she had to hurry to seek healing for her soul. As soon as she regained her health, she was to keep her promise to Saint Olav. Now he had by his intercessions saved her son healthy and alive for the light and the bath of baptism, now she was to go barefoot to his grave and lay there her golden wreath, the maiden's jewel of honor, which she had so badly defended and worn wrongly.

Now that he by his intercession had saved her son and brought him alive and whole to the light and to cleansing baptism, she must walk barefoot to his grave and lay down upon it the golden garland of maidenhood, which she had guarded so ill and borne so wrongfully.

It was a question of whether it would be one of her sons or her free sister's sons that the Norwegians set up against King Magnus. And she loved her children with Knut Porse as she had never loved her other children -.","There should be an end of it now. God be thanked and praised that he had other things on hand. Soon, soon, for sure, would he have Lady Ingebjörg’s letters. Aye, in that matter, too, he had to reckon with women’s whims; belike that was God’s punishment for the sins of his youth. Erlend laughed to himself in the dark. The lady must see that things were as they had so clearly set them forth to her. The question was whether it should be one of her sons or the sons of her base-born sister that the Norsemen set up against King Magnus. And she loved her children by Knut Porse as she had never loved her other children.","It had to be stopped now. Thank the Lord he had other matters on his hands. Soon, very soon, he would receive Lady Ingebjørg’s letters. Well, he couldn’t avoid trouble with women in this matter either, but that must be God’s punishment for the sins of his youth. Erlend laughed out loud in the dark. Lady Ingebjørg would have to see that what they had told her about the situation was true. The question was whether it would be one of her sons or the sons of her unlawful sister whom the Norwegians supported to oppose King Magnus. And she loved the children she had borne to Knut Porse in a way she had never loved her other children."

"I brott og biter kom minnene fra ungdommen. En dirrende skipsstavn som stod og biet et lite øyeblikk på den møtende havbølge – sjøen som vasket innover. Den veldige lyd av stormen og havet.

"Olav Kyrning bøyde seg over Erlend og spurte om han ønsket noe. Da han ikke fikk svar – visst fordi Erlend ikke orket si noe – tok han kappen til side. Erlend hadde bare linbrok og en skjortefille på – og synet av de opptrutnede og misfarvede lemmer opphisset og rystet Simon som en uterlig redsel. Han undret på om Erlend kjente noe slikt – der kom en skygge av rødme over ansiktet mens Olav strøk med en klut, som han dyppet i et vassfat, nedefter armer og ben. Og da han la kappen over igjen, skubbet Erlend den til rette med noen små rørsler av lemmene og ved å dra kappen oppover seg med haken, så han var helt tildekket.","Olav Kyrning bent over Erlend and asked if he wanted anything.

"Erlend smilte litt: Jo, Ån hadde selv skrytt av det, men prøver på hans kunst hadde Erlend aldri sett. Fra han var barn hadde han hørt Ån snakke om noen koner som han kalte for Hærn og Skøgul og Snotra – men det hadde han aldri tatt for annet enn eventyr og skjemt. «Min bror Gunnulf og presten vår, Sira Eiliv, har nok spurt ham ut flere ganger, men de har vel ikke funnet noen sak ved ham siden de intet har gjort. Mannen kom da til kirken hver messedag og kunne kristenbønnene sine.» Stor tro på Åns kunster hadde han aldri hatt, og siden han nordpå hadde sett noe til fingand og galder, hadde han da skjønt at det som Ån fór med, var bare narrestreker.","Erlend smiled a little: Yes, Ån had boasted about it himself, but Erlend had never seen samples of his art.

The man came to the church each mass-day, and knew his Christian prayers.” Great faith in Aan ’s sorceries he had never had, and since he had seen somewhat in the north of Lapp magic and spells, he had seen full well that the magic Aan dealt in was but foolery.","Erlend gave a little smile. Yes, well, Aan had boasted of this himself, but Erlend had never seen proof of his abilities.

After all, the man came to church for every mass and he knew his Christian prayers.” Erlend had never had much faith in Aan’s sorcery, and after he had witnessed something of the spells and witchcraft of the Finns in the north, he had come to realize that Aan’s purported skills were mere foolishness."

Is this about the sections of the estate in Verdal that he has sold to Vigleik of Lyng?”"
"Husfruen kom ikke inn til kveldsmåltidet – hun lå på sengen inne i kleven, sa Signe, hennes terne, og så bebreidende på sin husbond. Erlend svarte barsk at han hadde ikke spurt efter hennes frue. Da folkene hadde forlatt stuen, gikk han inn i kleven. Der var stummende mørkt. Erlend bøyde seg over henne i sengen:","The housewife did not come in for the evening meal - she was lying on the bed in the closet, said Signe, her toes, and looked reproachfully at her husband. Erlend replied harshly that he had not asked for her mistress. When the people had left the room, he went into the closet. It was pitch dark. Erlend leaned over her in bed:","The mistress of the house came not in to supper — she was lying down on the bed in the closet, said Signe, her maid, looking at her master reproachfully. Erlend answered harshly that he had not asked after her mistress. When the house-folk had left the hall, he went into the closet. It was pitch-dark in there. Erlend bent over the bed.","The mistress of the house didn’t come to the evening meal. She was lying in bed in the alcove, said her maid Signe, with a reproachful look at her master.

"«Jeg skjønner det, Kristin, lett får du det ikke i vinter,» sa mannen, han så på henne med et lite smil – det underlige smilet han hadde alltid når han talte med henne eller Erlend. Det var frekt og spotsk, og enda var det både godhet og en slags aktelse for henne i hans vesen. Hun syntes heller ikke hun hadde rett til å bli krenket når Ulv tok seg til et mere fortrolig vesen mot henne enn det kunne vært sømmelig. Selv hadde hun og Erlend latt denne svennen bli medviter i sin tuktløse og uredelige ferd; nu skjønte hun at han visste også hvordan hun var stilt. Det fikk hun nu tåle – hun så jo også at Erlend fant seg i det hva så Ulv sa og gjorde, og megen ærbødighet viste svennen ikke sin husbond. Men de hadde vært venner fra barnedagene; Ulv var utefra Møre, sønn til en småbonde som bodde nær Bård Peterssøns gård. Han sa du til Erlend og nu også til henne – men det var sånn at folk gjorde det mere her nordenfjells enn hjemme i bygden hennes.","""I understand, Kristin, you can not easily get it this winter,"" said the man, he looked at her with a small smile - the strange smile he always had when he talked to her or Erlend. It was rude and mocking, and yet there was both kindness and a kind of esteem for her in his being. She also did not think she had the right to be offended when Wolf took on a more intimate nature towards her than it could have been decent. She and Erlend themselves had made this servant aware of their disciplinary and dishonest journey; now she realized that he also knew how she was posed. She now had to endure that - she also saw that Erlend found himself in what Ulv said and did, and the servant did not show much reverence to his master. But they had been friends since childhood; Ulv was from Møre, the son of a small farmer who lived near Bård Peterssøn's farm. He told you to Erlend and now also to her - but it was the case that people did it more here in Nordenfjells than at home in her village.","“I can well believe it, Kristin — that you will have no easy task this winter,” said the man, looking at her with a little smile — the strange smile that was always on his face when he spoke with her or with Erlend. It was bold and mocking, and yet there were both kindness and a sort of respect for her in his bearing. Nor, it seemed to her, had she a right to take offence that Ulf should bear himself more forwardly towards her than might have been seemly otherwise. She herself and Erlend had made this serving-man a party to their wanton and deceitful doings; and she could see that he knew, too, how things stood with her now. She must let this pass — and indeed she saw that Erlend put up with anything Ulf might say or do, and that the man showed but little reverence for his master. True, they had been friends from childhood; Ulf came from Möre, and was son to a small farmer that lived near Baard Peterssön’s manor. He called Erlend by his name; and her, too, now — it was true that this way of speech was commoner here north of Dovre than in her own country.","“I can see, Kristin, that you won’t have an easy time this winter,” said the man. He looked at her with a little smile—that odd smile he always wore whenever he spoke to her or to Erlend. It was impudent and mocking, and yet there was in his bearing both kindness and a certain esteem for her. And she didn’t feel that she had the right to be offended when Ulf assumed a more familiar attitude toward her than might otherwise be fitting. She and Erlend had allowed this man to be a witness to their improper and sinful behavior; now she saw that he also knew in what condition she found herself. That was something she would have to bear. She saw that Erlend too tolerated whatever Ulf said or did, and the man did not show much respect for his master. But they had been friends in their childhood; Ulf was from Møre, the son of a smallholder who lived near Baard Petersøn’s estate. He used the familiar form of address when he spoke to Erlend, as he now did with her—but that was more the custom among people up north than back home in her village."

"Men fordi han var så god og trolynt en mann, så var det ofte vanskelig å snakke med ham om det onde hun så i sitt eget hjerte. Da hun bekjente for ham hvor forbitret hun var blitt over Erlends adferd den gangen med Margret, så hadde han lagt henne på hjerte at hun måtte bære over med sin husbond. Men han syntes å mene det var dog Erlend alene som hadde forgått seg da han talte så urettferdig til sin hustru – og det i fremmedes påhør. Kristin mente nok det, hun med. Men innerst i sitt hjerte følte hun en medskyld som hun ikke kunne rede ut, og som voldte henne dyp hjerteve.","But because he was such a good and faithful man, it was often difficult to talk to him about the evil she saw in her own heart. When she confessed to him how bitter she had become over Erlend's behavior at that time with Margret, he had put it on her heart that she had to carry on with her husband. But he seemed to think that it was Erlend alone who had perished when he spoke so unfairly to his wife - and that in the presence of strangers. Kristin probably meant what she did. But deep down in her heart she felt a guilt that she could not unravel, and that caused her deep heartache.","But for the very reason that he was so good and so simple-hearted a man, ’twas often hard to speak to him of the evil she saw in her own heart. When she confessed to him how wroth she had been with Erlend for his behaviour in this matter of Margret, he had enjoined on her her duty to bear with her husband. But he seemed to deem that ’twas Erlend alone that had offended in speaking so unjustly to his wife — and that in the hearing of strangers. And Kristin, indeed, thought the like. But in her inmost heart she felt that she shared in the guilt; she could not make it clear, but it troubled her heart sorely.","But because he was such a good and pious man, it was often difficult to speak to him about the evil she saw in her own heart.

Men Erlend satt og stirret inn i glohaugen. Nu visste han det med ett så sikkert – men han hadde skjønt det helt fra den stunden da han først så det lille røde barneåsyn mot Kristins hvite skulder. Det ble aldri mere slik mellom dem som det hadde vært.,But Erlend sat staring into the mound. Now he knew it at once so surely - but he had understood it from the moment he first saw the little red child's face against Kristin's white shoulder. It never happened again between them as it had been.,"But Erlend sat gazing into the heap of embers. It came over him so surely, of a sudden — though truly he had felt it ever since he first saw the little red baby face against Kristin’s white shoulder — things would nevermore be between them as once they had been.","But Erlend sat and stared into the glowing embers. He suddenly understood with certainty—but he had realized it from the moment he first saw the tiny red infant face pressed against Kristin’s white shoulder. It would never be the same between them, the way it had been before."
"Erlend sa han visste nok at det ville de gjerne, hvis de evnet. For her nord hellet nu de fleste til kansleren – uten erkebiskopen, i ham hadde nu Erlend en fulltro venn. Men Erlends fremferd var i alle saker efter loven – han rådførte seg i alle saker med sin klerk, Kløng Aressøn, som var overmåte lovkyndig. Erlend talte nu alvorlig, smilte bare flyktig da han sa at ingen hadde visst ventet han skulle ha så god greie på sine saker som han hadde – hverken hans kjære venner her i bygdene eller herrene i rådet. Forresten var han ikke viss på at han gadd ha sysselen hvis andre vilkår skulle gjelde enn de som han hadde hatt mens Erling Vidkunssøn stod for styret. Hans kår var nu slike, især efter hustruens foreldres død, at han trengte ikke tinge om deres gunst som var kommet til makten ved det at kongen var blitt sagt myndig. Ja, den råtne gutten kunne de da like gjerne si myndig nu som siden, han ble visst ikke mere mandig om han ble gjemt. Desto før ville det synes hva han bar i skjoldet – eller de svenske herrene som rådet med ham. Folk skulle få sanne, Erling hadde sett klart allikevel. Oss skulle det stå dyrt om kong Magnus ville legge Skåne under den svenske krone – og det ville bære i krig med danskene samme stund som en mann, dansk eller tysk, fikk makten der i landet. Og freden nordpå, som skulle stå ved makt i ti år – nu var halve tiden gått, og uvisst var det om russerne ville holde seg til forliket enn så lenge. Erlend trodde lite på det – det gjorde ikke Erling heller. Nei, Pål kansler var jo en lærd mann, forstandig også på mange vis – kanskje. Men disse herrene i rådet, som hadde tatt ham til sin viser, hadde da til sammen ikke så meget vett som Soten her. Men nu var de da kvitt Erling – så lenge. Og så lenge kunne også Erlend gjerne stige til side. Men Erling og hans venner så nok helst at Erlend holdt sin makt og velstand oppe her nord, så han visste ikke riktig.","Erlend said he probably knew they would, if they could. For here in the north most people now went to the chancellor - without the archbishop, in him Erlend now had a faithful friend. But Erlend's conduct was in all matters according to the law - he consulted in all matters with his clerk, Kløng Aressøn, who was exceedingly knowledgeable. Erlend now spoke seriously, only smiling fleetingly when he said that no one had expected him to be as good at his affairs as he had - neither his dear friends here in the villages nor the gentlemen in the council. By the way, he was not sure that he bothered to have the job if other conditions were to apply than those he had had while Erling Vidkunssøn was on the board. His condition was now such, especially after the death of the wife's parents, that he did not need to worry about their favor which had come to power by the fact that the king had been said of age. Yes, they could just as easily say the rotten boy came of age now as he did then, he certainly did not become more manly if he was hidden. The sooner it would seem what he was wearing in the shield - or the Swedish gentlemen who ruled with him. People should get true, Erling had seen clearly anyway. It would be expensive for us if King Magnus wanted to put Scania under the Swedish crown - and it would be at war with the Danes at the same time as a man, Danish or German, gained power in that country. And the peace in the north, which was to remain in power for ten years - now half the time had passed, and it was uncertain whether the Russians would stick to the settlement for so long. Erlend did not believe much in it - neither did Erling. No, Chancellor Pål was a learned man, sensible in many ways too - perhaps. But these gentlemen in the council, who had taken him to their show, then together did not have as much sense as Soten here. But now they were rid of Erling - for so long. And for that long Erlend could also gladly step aside. But Erling and his friends probably preferred that Erlend keep his power and prosperity up here in the north, so he did not know right.","Erlend said he knew well enough they would, if they had the power. For here in the north most men leaned to the Chancellor’s party — not the Archbishop, though: in him Erlend had a trusty friend. But Erlend’s dealings in all things were conformable to the law — he took counsel in all cases with his clerk, Klöng Aressön, who was most skilful in such matters. Erlend spoke gravely now, but he smiled slightly as he said that he deemed none had looked that he should be as well skilled in the matters of his charge as he was — neither his dear friends in this country-side nor the lords of the Council. For the rest, he was not sure that he cared to keep the Wardenship if ’twas to be on other terms than those he had while Erling Vidkunssön was at the helm. His affairs were now in such a posture — the more so since his wife’s parents’ death — that he had no need to bargain for the favour of the men that had come to power when the King was declared of age. Aye, that rotten boy they might just as well call of age now as later; ’twas unlike he would grow more of a man by keeping. One would come to know all the sooner what he was planning — he or the Swedish lords that pulled the strings. Folk would soon own that Erling had been clear-sighted after all. It would cost us dear if King Magnus tried to bring Skaane under the Swedish crown, and ’twould mean war with the Danes the moment one man, be he Danish or German, came to power in Denmark. And the peace in the north that was to last ten years — half the time was gone by now, and ’twas unsure whether the Russians would hold to the pact even for the five years left. Erlend had little faith in them, nor had Erling either, for that matter. Aye, Chancellor Paal was doubtless a learned man, long-headed too, in many ways, perhaps. But these gentry of the Council who had taken him for their leader — Soten here had more wit than the whole of them put together. Well, now they had got quit of Erling — for the time. And for the time, Erlend, too, had just as lief step aside. But Erling and his friends would doubtless rather that Erlend kept a hold on his powers and fortunes in the north here — so he had not made up his mind.","Erlend said he knew that’s what they would have liked, if it was within their power. For here in the north, most men now sided with the chancellor—except for the archbishop; in him, Erlend had a true friend. But Erlend’s actions in all matters were taken in accordance with the law; he always consulted with his scribe, Kløng Aressøn, who was exceptionally knowledgeable about the law. Erlend was now speaking somberly, and he smiled only briefly as he said that doubtless no one had expected him to have such a good grasp of his business affairs as he now had—neither his dear friends around the countryside nor the gentlemen of the Council. But he was no longer certain that he wanted the position of sheriff, if other conditions should apply than those he had been granted while Erling Vidkunssøn represented the king. His own situation was now such, especially since the death of his wife’s parents, that he no longer needed to secure the favor of those who had risen to power after the king had been proclaimed of age. Yes, that rotten boy might as well be declared of age now rather than later; he wasn’t going to become any more manly if they kept him hidden. Then they would know even sooner what he was concealing behind his shield—or how much the Swedish nobles controlled him. The people would learn the truth: that Erling had been right, after all. It would cost the Norwegians dearly if King Magnus tried to put Skaane4 under the Swedish Crown—and it would immediately lead to war with the Danes the moment one man, whether Danish or German, seized power there. And the peace in the north, which was supposed to be enforced for ten years . . . Half of that time had now passed, and it was uncertain whether the Russians would adhere to the treaty much longer. Erlend had not much faith in it, nor did Erling. No, Chancellor Paal was a learned man and in many respects sensible too—perhaps. But all the gentlemen of the Council, who had chosen him as their leader, had little more combined wit than his horse Soten. But now they were rid of Erling, for the time being. And until things changed, Erlend would just as soon step aside too. But surely Erling and his friends would want Erlend to maintain his power and prosperity up here in the north. He didn’t know what he should do."

Then he voiced many objections. Ragnfrid would undoubtedly not like to be left alone on the farm. And once he had journeyed so far north, it would be difficult to return in time for spring planting. But in the end he set off with Erlend. He took no servant along—he would travel home by ship to Raumsdal. There he could hire horses to carry him south through the valley; he knew people everywhere along the way."

"Men selv valgte jeg verden, og jeg fristet å tenke, når verden gikk imot meg, umandig ville det være å klage over den lagnad som jeg selv kåret meg.

"Landrådssak. Hun hadde hørt om Audun Hugleikssøns nedfall – det var hendt i hennes fars ungdom. Men det var forferdelige ugjerninger som ble sagt herr Audun på.

Men det var aldri blitt fullelig oppklart for almuen i landet hvi Audun Hugleikssøn måtte dø i galgen på Nordnes –.","Land council case.

"Erlend var kommet hjem fra Danmark ved helgemessetider, meget opprømt. Han var blitt fagnet på det hederligste av hertugen og av sin frendekone fru Ingebjørg; de hadde takket meget for hans gaver av skinn og sølv, han hadde ridd i tjost og veidet hjort og hind, og da de skiltes, hadde herr Knut skjenket ham en kullsvart spansk hingst, men fruen hadde sendt kjærlig hilsen og to sølvgrå mynder til hans hustru. Kristin syntes at disse utenlandske hundene så lumske og troløse ut, og hun var redd de skulle gjøre hennes barn skade. Og folk i bygdene snakket om kastalenen. Erlend så godt ut på den høybente lettbygde hest, men slikt dyr passet ikke her i landet, og Gud måtte vite hvordan hingsten ville greie seg i fjellet. Imidlertid så kjøpte nu Erlend inn, hvor han for i sysselen, de gildeste svarte merrer, og han hadde nu et sto som var vakkert å se på iallfall. Ellers hadde Erlend Nikulaussøn brukt å sette fine og utenlandske navn på ridehestene sine: Belkolor og Bajard og slikt, men denne sa han var så gild at den trengte ikke slik prydnad – den het bare Soten.","Erlend had returned home from Denmark at the weekend, very elated. He had been greeted in the most honorable way by the duke and by his cousin Mrs. Ingebjørg; they had thanked him very much for his gifts of leather and silver, he had ridden in tjost and weighed deer and hind, and when they parted, Mr. Knut had given him a charcoal-black Spanish stallion, but the lady had sent loving greetings and two silver-gray greyhounds to his wife. Kristin thought that these foreign dogs looked insidious and unfaithful, and she was afraid they would harm her children. And people in the villages talked about the castle. Erlend looked good on the high-legged, easily built horse, but such an animal did not fit in this country, and God had to know how the stallion would do in the mountains. However, now Erlend bought in, where he went in the business, the most valid black mares, and he now had a stand that was beautiful to look at at least. Otherwise, Erlend Nikulaussøn had used to put nice and foreign names on his riding horses: Belkolor and Bajard and such, but this one he said was so valid that it did not need such an ornament - it was just called Soten.","Erlend came back from Denmark about All Saints’ tide, in high feather. He had been entertained with the greatest honour by the Duke and his kinswoman Lady Ingebjörg; they had thanked him right heartily for his gifts of silver and furs; he had ridden in the jousts, and chased the hart and the hind; and when they parted, Sir Knut had bestowed on him a coal-black Spanish stallion, while the Lady had sent loving greetings and two silver-grey grey-hounds to his wife. Kristin deemed that these outlandish hounds looked faithless and treacherous, and she was afraid they might do her children hurt. And the folk all through the countryside talked much of the Castilian steed. ’ Twas true, Erlend looked well on the long-legged, light-built horse; but such beasts suited not this northern land, and God only knew how the stallion would get about on the hill-paths. Howbeit, Erlend bought up now, wherever he went about in his charge, the bravest black mares, till he had made him a stud that was fair to look on at the least. In other days Erlend Nikulaussön had used to give his riding-horses fine outlandish names: Belkolor and Bayard and suchlike; but this horse, he said, was so rare a beast that he needed no such adornment — plain Soten* should be his name.","Erlend had returned home from Denmark in high spirits around All Saints’ Day.

In the meantime, wherever he went in his district, Erlend would buy the most splendid of black mares, and he now had a herd that was beautiful in appearance, at any rate. Erlend Nikulaussøn usually gave his horses refined, foreign names, such as Belkolor and Bajard, but he said that this stallion was so magnificent that it didn’t need any further adornment, and he named it simply Soten.1"

"Han hadde helt latt ombygge den gamle svarte årestuen hvor kvinnene på Formo i noen hundre år hadde brukt å gå inn når de skulle føde barn. Åren var kastet ut, en ovn var murt, og en fin, utskåret seng var bygget lunt og godt inntil ovnens ene side, og på veggen midt imot stod et vakkert utskåret bilde av Guds moder, slik at den som lå i sengen, kunne ha det for øye. Det var kommet gulvtiljer og glassvindu i veggen, vakkert smått bohave og nye benker. Simon ville at Ramborg skulle ha dette huset til fruerstue, her kunne hun ha sitt stell, beverte husfruer, og når det var gjestebud på gården, kunne de ty hit, de kvinner som ikke likte seg så godt når mennene utpå kvelden ble overveldet av drikken.","He had completely had the old black oar room rebuilt, where the women at Formo had used to go in for a few hundred years when they were about to give birth. The oars had been thrown out, a stove had been built, and a fine, carved bed had been built snugly and well against one side of the stove, and on the opposite wall was a beautifully carved image of the Mother of God, so that he who lay in the bed could have that in mind. There were floor tiles and glass windows in the wall, beautiful small furniture and new benches. Simon wanted Ramborg to have this house as a maid's room, here she could take care of herself, beverted housewives, and when there were guests on the farm, they could resort here, the women who did not like themselves so much when the men in the evening were overwhelmed by the drink .","One of his and Kristin’s sons would most like be given these things — for choice the child she was soon to bear, if ’twere a son — perhaps he might some day be Lavrans of Jörundgaard, said the sick man with a smile. On the way down through Gudbrandsdal, too, the body was to be taken into certain churches over-night — and these were all remembered in Lavrans’ testament with money-gifts and wax tapers.","He had rebuilt the old, dark hearth house, where the women of Formo had gone for hundreds of years whenever they were going to give birth. The hearth had been thrown out and replaced with a stone fireplace, with a finely carved bed placed snugly against one side. On the opposite wall hung a beautiful carved image of the Mother of God, so that whoever lay in the bed could see it. Flagstones had been laid down, and a glass pane was put in the window; there were lovely, small pieces of furniture and new benches. Simon wanted Ramborg to have this house as her women’s room. Here she could keep her things and invite other women in; and whenever there were banquets at the manor, the women could retire to this house if they grew uneasy when the men became overwhelmed by drink late in the evening."
"Julenatten ville Kristin gå i midnattsmessen i Nonneseters kirke – hun sa det var fordi søstrene sang så fagert. De fulgtes da dit alle fem. Natten var stjerneklar, mild og vakker, og det hadde snedd litt i kveldingen, så det var nokså lyst. Da klokkene tok til å ringe fra kirkene, strømmet folk ut av alle gårder, og Simon måtte leie Kristin. Av og til så han bort på henne i smug. Hun var blitt meget mager denne høsten, men det var som hennes høye, ranke skikkelse hadde fått igjen noe av ungmøens myke og stille ynde. Over det bleke ansikt var igjen kommet hennes ungdoms uttrykk av ro og blidhet, som dekket en dyp og dulgt, lyttende spenning. Hun hadde fått en underlig gjenferdsaktig likhet med hin unge Kristin fra den julen for lenge siden –. Simon knuget hennes hånd og visste ikke at han hadde gjort det før hun krystet hans fingre til svar. Han så opp – hun smilte og nikket, og han forstod hun hadde tatt hans håndtrykk for en maning, at hun måtte holde seg modig – og nu strevet hun for å vise ham, jo, hun var det.","On Christmas night, Kristin wanted to go to the midnight mass in Nonneseter's church - she said it was because the sisters sang so beautifully. They then followed your all five. The night was starry, mild and beautiful, and it had turned a little in the evening, so it was quite bright. When the bells started ringing from the churches, people flocked out of all the farms, and Simon had to rent Kristin. Sometimes he looked at her in secret. She had become very thin this autumn, but it was as if her tall, slender figure had regained some of the young maiden's soft and quiet grace. Over her pale face had again come her youthful expression of calm and gentleness, which covered a deep and hidden, listening tension. She had got a strange ghostly resemblance to the young Kristin from that Christmas a long time ago -. Simon clasped her hand and did not know he had done it until she crossed her fingers in response. He looked up - she smiled and nodded, and he understood she had taken his handshake for a call, that she had to stay brave - and now she struggled to show him, yes, she was.","On Christmas Eve, Kristin wished to go to the midnight mass in Nonneseter church — she said it was because the sisters sang so sweetly. So they all five went together. The night was clear starlight, mild and fair, and it had snowed a little in the evening, so that ’twas somewhat light. When the bells began ringing from the churches, folk streamed out of all the houses, and Simon had to lead Kristin by the hand. Now and then he stole a glance at her. She was grown greatly thinner this last autumn, but it was as though her tall, straight form had got back somewhat of the young maid’s supple and tranquil grace. Over her pale face there was come again the look she had had in youth of calm and gentleness covering a deep and hidden, listening expectancy. She had taken on a strange ghostly likeness to the young Kristin of that Yule-tide long ago. — Simon pressed her hand, and knew not that he had done so till he felt an answering pressure. He looked up — she smiled and nodded, and he understood that she had taken his handclasp as a warning to her to be brave — and now she was striving to show him that indeed she was brave.","On Christmas Eve Kristin wanted to attend midnight mass at Nonneseter’s church; she said it was because the sisters sang so beautifully. All five of them decided to go. The night was starry and clear, mild and lovely; it had snowed a little in the evening, so it was quite bright. When the bells began to ring from the churches, people came streaming out of all the houses, and Simon had to give Kristin his hand. Now and then he would cast a sidelong glance at her. She had grown terribly thin in the autumn, but her tall, erect figure seemed to have regained some of its maidenly softness and quiet grace. Her pale face had assumed the expression from her youth of calm and gentleness, which hid a deep, tense wariness. She had taken on an oddly phantomlike resemblance to the young Kristin from that Christmastime so long ago. Simon gripped her hand hard, unaware that he was doing so until she squeezed his fingers in return. He looked up. She smiled and nodded, and he understood that she had interpreted the pressure of his hand as a reminder that she must remain brave—and now she was trying to show him that she would."
III,III,3,CHAPTER 3
[7],[7],She could not think this well done of Erlend.,She didn’t think Erlend had handled this very well.
"Hun gikk da hjemme på Jørundgård, skjelvende urolig i sinnet.","She then went home to Jørundgård, trembling with anxiety.","Thus, as she went about in her old home, her heart was tremulous and ill at ease.",So she spent the days at Jørundgaard with her soul shivering and uneasy.
"«Gud vil snart hjelpe deg nu, Kristin,» sa presten hver gang. En kone holdt et vannfat, og efter hver ri tok han et vått klede og tørket over den sykes ansikt – oppunder hårroten, inn mellom leppene, som slim rant utover.","""God will soon help you now, Kristin,"" the priest said each time. A wife held a barrel of water, and after each ride he took a wet cloth and dried it over the patient's face - under the root of the hair, in between the lips, as mucus ran out.","“God will help you soon now, Kristin,” said the priest each time. A woman stood by, holding a basin of water, and after every spasm she took a wet cloth and wiped the sick woman’s face — the sweat from under her hair-roots and the slime from between her lips.","“God will help you soon, Kristin,” said the priest each time. A woman held a basin of water, and after each wave of pain he would take a wet cloth and wipe the sick woman’s face—along the roots of her hair and in between her lips, from which saliva was dripping."
"«Vil du ikke søke råd hos noen, Kristin, da får du tale selv med Erlend,» sa han da hun ikke svarte. «Tenk på sønnene dine, Kristin!»","""If you do not want to seek advice from anyone, Kristin, then you can talk to Erlend yourself,"" he said when she did not answer. ""Think of your sons, Kristin!""","“If so be you will not take counsel of any, Kristin, then must you speak yourself with Erlend,” he said, when she made no answer. “Think on your sons, Kristin!”","When she didn’t answer, he said, “But if you won’t seek advice from anyone, Kristin, then you must speak to Erlend. Think of your sons, Kristin!”"
"Fra den første kvelden han så henne på Godøy – deres øyne møttes, så så de til siden og kom til å smile så lønsk begge to – hadde Erlend visst at hun kjente ham – og han kjente henne. Sunniva Olavsdatter, henne kunne han ta med bare neven, og hun ventet på at han skulle gjøre det.","From the first night he saw her on Godøy - their eyes met, then they looked to the side and came to smile so cheerfully both - Erlend had known that she knew him - and he knew her. Sunniva Olavsdatter, he could only take her fist, and she waited for him to do so.","From the first evening he saw her at Godöy — their eyes had met, and then they had looked aside, a secret smile on each face — Erlend had been assured that she knew him — and he knew her. Sunniva Olavsdatter — he could take her with his bare hands; and she looked for him to do it.","From the first evening Erlend saw her at Godøy—their eyes met, and then they looked away, both of them smiling secretively—he was convinced that she knew him, and he knew her. Sunniva Olavsdatter—he could take her with his bare hands, and she was waiting for him to do so."
Det gikk opp for ham at han hadde stelt seg enda mere uvettig enn han hadde skjønt fra først av – da han innlot seg på dette elendige eventyr nu mens han stod midt oppe i de største råd.,It dawned on him that he had behaved even more foolishly than he had realized from the beginning - when he embarked on this miserable adventure now while standing in the middle of the greatest councils.,"It dawned upon him that he had behaved yet more witlessly than he had understood at first, to let himself be tangled in this wretched adventure, now, when he was in the thick of the greatest plans of State.","It occurred to him that he had acted with even greater folly than he had first thought when he entered into this miserable affair, now that he was involved in the greatest plans."
"Mannen reiste seg, stelte litt med varmen og kom bort til husfruen. Han satte seg på benken midt imot henne.","The man got up, took care of the heat and came over to the housewife. He sat down on the bench opposite her.","The man rose, put some fuel on the fire, and came across to his mistress. He sat down on the bench over against her.","The man got up, poked at the fire a bit, and came over to Kristin. He sat down on the bench across from her."
"Først nu kom Kristin til å tenke på – hun hadde ikke sett en eneste av slike ting som skulle tjene folk til tidkort, så lenge hun hadde vært her på Husaby.","Only now did Kristin come to mind - she had not seen a single one of such things that would serve people for time cards, as long as she had been here at Husaby.",Kristin had to own now to her brother-in-law that she was slow-witted at the draughts and had no great skill of stringed music.,"Not until then did Kristin realize that in all the time she had been at Husaby, she hadn’t seen a single amusement of this type that people might use to pass the time."
Erlend slapp sin hustru med et siste trykk av sin arm om hennes skulder:,Erlend released his wife with one last push of his arm around her shoulder:,"Erlend loosed his wife, with a last pressure of his arm about her shoulders.",Erlend let go of his wife with one last squeeze of his arm around her shoulder.
"«Nei,» svarte han kort. Så bød han farvel og red bort.","""No,"" he replied shortly. Then he said goodbye and rode away.","“No,” he answered shortly. And thereupon he bade farewell and rode away.","“No,” he said curtly. Then he bid her farewell and rode off."
"Ulv slengte kniven han satt med, så den fór klingende bortover bordet. Så reiste han seg, tok den igjen og tørket av den bak på låret sitt, stakk den i sliren og vendte seg til Erlend:","Wolf threw the knife he was sitting with, so that it sounded across the table. Then he got up, took it again and wiped it off the back of his thigh, stuck it in the sheath and turned to Erlend:","Ulf hurled from him the knife he had in his hand, so that it flew ringing across the table. He rose and picked it up again, wiped it on the back of his thigh, and stuck it in its sheath. Then he turned to Erlend:","Ulf flung the knife he was holding so that it clattered across the table. Then he got to his feet, picked up the knife, wiped it on the back of his thigh, and stuck it in its sheath. He turned to Erlend."
"Efter dette øket feberen så sterkt at hun visste ikke mere av seg, og så fikk hun ikke den sorg, mens hun var på jorden, at hun spurte gutten døde ett døgn før moren. Og i den annen heimen kjente hun vel ikke sorg over slikt, men var glad hun hadde Erling deres hos seg, tenkte Simon.","After this the fever increased so much that she knew no more of herself, and then she did not get the grief, while she was on earth, that she asked the boy died one day before the mother. And in the other home she probably did not feel sad about such things, but was glad she had their Erling with her, Simon thought.","After this the fever mounted so high that she knew no more, and she had not the grief, while yet on earth, of hearing that her boy had died a day before his mother. And in the other home, Simon thought, ’twas most like she felt no sorrow for such things, but was glad that she had their Erling with her.","After that her fever rose so sharply that she was no longer aware of anything, and so she did not have to suffer the grief, while she was still in this world, of hearing that the boy had died one day before his mother. And no doubt in that other home she would not feel sorrow over such things, but would be glad that she had their Erling with her, thought Simon."
"Mens de ventet på legekonen, fikk han og hans svenn mat inne i stuen. Imens samtalte han med henne som kledde av seg inne i kleven. Ja, han hadde ridd nord straks han hørte hva som var hendt på Sundbu – han hit og Ramborg dit for å være hos Ivars og Borgars hustruer. Ivar hadde de ført til Mjøskastellet, men Håvard lot de være på frifot, dog hadde han måttet love å bli i bygden. Det saes at Borgar og Guttorm skulle ha fått hell til å unnfly – Jon fra Laugarbru var ridd ut til Raumsdal for å spørre tidender og skulle sende bud hit. Simon hadde vært på Husaby i middags, men han hadde ikke stanset lenge. Drengene hadde det godt, men Nåkkve og Bjørgulf hadde stortigget om å få bli med ham inn.","While they waited for the doctor's wife, he and his servant got food in the living room. Meanwhile, he talked to her who was undressing inside the closet. Yes, he had ridden north as soon as he heard what had happened at Sundbu - he here and Ramborg there to be with Ivar and Borgar's wives. Ivar had taken them to Mjøskastellet, but Håvard left them free, yet he had had to promise to stay in the village. It is said that Borgar and Guttorm should have been lucky enough to escape - Jon from Laugarbru had ridden out to Raumsdal to ask for news and was to send messengers here. Simon had been to Husaby this afternoon, but he had not stopped long. The boys were well, but Nåkkve and Bjørgulf had begged to be allowed to join him.","While they waited for the leech-woman, he and his man were served with food in the hall; and over his meal he talked with her as she undressed in the closet. Yes, he had ridden north as soon as he had heard what had befallen at Sundbu — he had come hither, and Ramborg gone thither to be with Ivar’s and Borgar’s wives. Ivar they had taken to Mjös Castle, but Haavard they had left at large, yet had he been made to promise not to leave the parish. ’ Twas said that Borgar and Guttorm had been lucky enough to get clear away — Jon of Laugarbru had ridden out to Raumsdal for tidings, and was to send word hither. Simon had been at Husaby at midday, but had not tarried long. All was well with the boys, but Naakkve and Björgulf had begged and begged him to take them with him.","While they waited for the woman to arrive, Simon and his man were given food in the hall. As they ate, he talked to Kristin, who was undressing in the alcove. Yes, he had ridden north as soon as he heard what had happened at Sundbu. He had come here, while Ramborg went to stay with the wives of Ivar and Borgar. They had taken Ivar to Mjøs Castle, but they allowed Haavard to remain free, although he had to promise to stay in the village. It was said that Borgar and Guttorm had been fortunate enough to flee; Jon of Laugarbru had ridden out to Raumsdal to hear the news and would send word to Nidaros. Simon had reached Husaby around midday, but he hadn’t stayed long. The boys were fine, but Naakkve and Bjørgulf had begged him earnestly to bring them along."
"Simon stod mørkerød, men han sa intet. I alt som Erling Vidkunssøn hadde sagt til ham siden i går, merket han det spotske nag – og en underlig motvillig godhet – og en fast vilje til å føre denne sak frem – siden han nu engang hadde tatt den opp.","Simon stood dark red, but he said nothing. In everything that Erling Vidkunssøn had said to him since yesterday, he felt the mocking grudge - and a strangely reluctant kindness - and a firm will to take this matter forward - since he had once taken it up.","Simon stood there, flushing darkly, but he said no word. In all that Erling Vidkunssön had said to him since the day before, he marked a grudging mockery — and a strange, unwilling kindness — and a firm will to see this matter through — since, once and for all, he had taken it up.","Simon’s face was dark red, but he didn’t reply. In everything that Erling had said to him since the day before, he had noticed this scornful mocking, as well as a strangely reluctant kindness, and a firm will to see this matter through to the end, now that he had taken it on."
"Erlend lo sakte nede i strupen, strakte seg og gjespet. Da sa han med ett alvorlig: «Du har nu rådet med henne, du òg, bror min. Og det er ikke fritt for at dine råd somme tider er kommet mellom vårt vennskap.»","Erlend laughed slowly down his throat, stretched and yawned. Then he said suddenly, ""You have now consulted with her, you too, my brother. And it's not free that your advice has sometimes come between our friendships. ""","Erlend laughed softly, low in his throat, stretched himself, and yawned. Then of a sudden he said soberly: “You have guided her, too, at times, my brother. And I marvel if sometimes your counsels have not come nigh to parting our friendship.”","Erlend laughed softly from deep in his throat, then stretched and yawned. Suddenly somber, he said, “You have also counseled her, my brother. And at times your advice may well have come between our friendship.”"
Ingen sanset lenger hva tid på natten det monne være. Daggryet grinte grått ned gjennom ljoren alt.,No one sensed anymore what time of night it might be. The dawn laughed gray down through the ljor everything.,None thought any more what time of the night it might be. But through the smoke-vent already the dawn grinned greyly down.,No one had any idea what time of night it was anymore. The dawn was already a gray glare in the smoke vent.
"KRISTIN SATT MED GAUTE på fanget og så utover fra haugen nord for gården. Det var sånn vakker kveld. Sjøen lå aldeles blank og stille nedunder og speilet åsene og By-gårdene og de gyldne skyer på himmelen. Duften av løv og jord slo ut så sterkt efter regnet før på dagen. Gresset nede på engene måtte være knedypt alt, og åkrene var broddhyllet.","KRISTIN SIT WITH GAUTE on her lap and looked out from the mound north of the farm. It was such a beautiful evening. The sea lay perfectly shiny and still below and mirrored the hills and the City farms and the golden clouds in the sky. The scent of leaves and soil erupted so strongly after the rain earlier in the day. The grass down on the meadows had to be knee-deep all, and the fields were spruce-covered.","KRISTIN sat with Gaute on her lap, gazing from the little hill north of the manor. The evening was so fair. The lake lay below her bright and still, mirroring the hills and the farms of By, and the golden clouds in the sky.

The grass on the meadows below must be knee-deep already, and the fields were hidden with the spears of corn.","KRISTIN SAT WITH Gaute on her lap and stared into the distance from the hill north of the manor.

"Gunnulfs leie var en trebenk med et skinnlaken over litt halm og en eneste liten hodepute, så han måtte ligge helt utstrakt. Presten tok av seg kjortelen, la seg ned i underklærne og drog det tynne vadmelsteppe over seg.","Gunnulf's bed was a wooden bench with a leather sheet over some straw and a single small pillow, so he had to lie completely outstretched. The priest took off his robe, lay down in his underwear and pulled the thin calico of wool over him.","Gunnulf’s couch was a wooden bench with a sheet of skin spread over a little straw, and a single small pillow — so that he was forced to lie stretched straight out.

"Han kysset hennes skulder, men hun merket det ikke. Stakkar, hun skulle få sove – han hadde så meget å tenke på i natt. Erlend snudde seg fra henne, lå og stirret ut mot stuen på den lille gloprikk i åren. Ja, han burde vel stå opp og dekke over asken – men han gadd ikke –.","He kissed her shoulder, but she did not notice. Poor thing, she was going to sleep - he had so much to think about last night. Erlend turned away from her, lay staring out at the living room at the little glow in the vein. Yes, he should get up and cover the ashes - but he did not bother -.","He kissed her shoulder, but she marked it not. Poor child, let her sleep — he had so much to think on to-night.

"Denne høst døde erkebiskop Eiliv. Omtrent ved samme tid lot kong Magnus gjøre om vilkårene for flere av sysselmennene i landet, men ikke for Erlend Nikulaussøn. Han hadde, da han var i Bjørgvin den siste sommeren under kongens umyndighetsalder, fått brev på at han skulle ha fjerdedelen av sakefallet i fredkjøp, brevbrudd og åleiemål – det var blitt snakket meget om at han fikk slik forlening mot slutten av et formynderstyre. Da Erlend nu eide meget jord i fylket og oftest tok inn på sine egne gårder når han for i sysselen, men lot bøndene kjøpe seg fri for skyldveitslene, hadde han store innkomster. Riktignok fikk han da lite inn i landskyld, og han holdt seg kostbart; foruten gårdsfolket hadde han aldri færre enn tolv væpnede svenner hos seg på Husaby; disse red de beste hester og var fortreffelig rustet, og når han for omkring i sysselen, levde hans menn på herrekost.","This autumn, Archbishop Eiliv died. At about the same time, King Magnus had the terms changed for several of the governors in the country, but not for Erlend Nikulaussøn. When he was in Bjørgvin last summer during the king's age of majority, he had received a letter stating that he would have a quarter of the cases in peace purchases, letter breaches and tenancy cases - there had been much talk that he received such a grant towards the end of a guardianship. When Erlend now owned a lot of land in the county and most often took over his own farms when he was busy, but let the farmers buy themselves free of the guilt, he had large incomes. It is true that he then got little into land debt, and he kept himself costly; besides the farm people, he never had fewer than twelve armed servants with him at Husaby; these rode the best horses and were excellently equipped, and when he roamed about in business, his men lived on master food.","This autumn Archbishop Eiliv died. And about the same time King Magnus changed the terms of service of many of the Wardens, but not Erlend Nikulaussön’s. When Erlend was in Björgvin the last summer of the King’s nonage, he had been given letters granting him the fourth part of all grace-payments,* fines and forfeitures in his Wardenship — the thing had made much talk, that he should have been given such a grant towards the close of a Regency. Since Erlend now owned much land in the country, and most often lived on his own farms when he moved round his Wardenship, and as he let his farmers redeem their land-dues, his incomings were large. True, this meant that the incomings from land-dues in kind were small; and he kept a great and costly train — besides his own manor-folk he had never fewer than twelve men-at-arms with him at Husaby; these were bravely mounted and exceeding well armed; and when he moved about his charge, his men lived like lords.","That fall Archbishop Eiliv died. At about the same time, King Magnus had the terms changed for many of the sheriffs in the land, but not for Erlend Nikulaussøn. When he was in Bjørgvin during the last summer before the king came of age, Erlend had received a letter stating that he should be granted one fourth of the income collected from bail paid by criminals, from fines for the crime of letter-breaching,1 and from forfeitures of property. There had been much talk about his acquisition of such rights toward the end of a regency. Erlend had a vast income because he now owned a great deal of land in the county and usually stayed on his own estates when he traveled around his district, but he permitted his leaseholders to buy their way out of their obligation to house and feed him. It’s true that he took in little in land taxes, and the upkeep of his manor was costly; in addition to his household servants, he never had fewer than twelve armed men with him at Husaby. They rode the best horses and were splendidly outfitted, and whenever Erlend traveled around his district, his men lived like noblemen."
"Siste kvelden hun levde, hadde hun vært til nattsang i klosterkirken og efterpå inne i ildhuset i proventsgården; hun kokte en god suppe med noe styrkemiddel i og sa til de andre kvinnene som var der inne, at denne ville hun gi Torgunna, så håpet hun konen skulle være så frisk i morgen at de kunne følges til ottesangen. Det var det siste noen så Jørundgårdsenken i live. De kom ikke til mattin, hverken hun eller bondekonen, og ikke til prim. Da noen av munkene i koret la merke til at Ragnfrid heller ikke var i kirken til dagmessen, undret de seg – hun hadde aldri før mistet tre tjenester i ett døgn. De sendte da bud opp i byen, om Lavrans Bjørgulfssøns enke skulle være syk. Da folk kom i loftet, fant de suppeskålen stående urørt på bordet; i sengen sov Torgunna sødelig inntil veggen, men Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter lå fremme ved sengestokken med hendene i kors over brystet, død og nesten kald allerede. Simon og Ramborg kom ned til hennes jordeferd, som var meget vakker.","The last night she lived, she had been to night singing in the convent church and afterwards inside the firehouse in the provincial court; she boiled a good soup with some tonic in it and told the other women who were in there, that she would give this to Torgunna, so she hoped the wife would be so healthy tomorrow that they could be accompanied to the eight song. That was the last time anyone saw Jørundgårdsenken alive. They did not come to mattin, neither she nor the farmer's wife, nor to prim. When some of the monks in the choir noticed that Ragnfrid was not in the church for the day mass either, they wondered - she had never before lost three services in one day. They then sent word up into the city, whether Lavrans Bjørgulfsson's widow should be ill. When people came into the attic, they found the bowl of soup standing untouched on the table; in bed Torgunna slept sweetly against the wall, but Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter lay in front of the bed with her hands crossed over her chest, dead and almost cold already. Simon and Ramborg came down to her funeral, which was very beautiful.","The last evening of her life she had been at evensong in the cloister-church, and went afterwards into the kitchen of the commoners’ yard. There she cooked a good bowl of soup with strengthening herbs in it, and said to the other women who were there that she would give this to Torgunna, and she hoped the woman would be well enough in the morning to come with her to matins. This was the last time any saw the Jörundgaard widow alive. They came not to matins — neither she nor the peasant woman — nor yet to prime. When some of the monks in the choir marked that Ragnfrid was not in the church for the day-mass either, they began to wonder — she had never before missed three services in a day. They sent word up to the town to ask if Lavrans Björgulfsön’s widow were sick. When the folk came into the loft, they found the bowl of soup standing untouched on the board; in the bed Torgunna was sleeping sweetly by the wall, but Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter lay on the outside of the bed with her hands crossed on her breast, dead, and well-nigh cold already. Simon and Ramborg had come down to her burial, and it was a most fair one.","On the last evening of her life, she had attended evensong in the cloister church, and afterwards she went into the cookhouse of the estate. She made a hearty soup with several restorative herbs and told the other women there that she was going to give the soup to Torgunna. She hoped the woman would feel well enough the next day so that they could both attend matins. That was the last time anyone saw the widow of Jørundgaard alive. Neither she nor the peasant woman came to matins or to the next service. When some of the monks in the choir noticed that Ragnfrid didn’t come to the morning mass either, they were greatly surprised—she had never before missed three services in a day. They sent word to town, asking whether the widow of Lavrans Bjørgulfsøn was ill. When the servants went up to the loft, they found the soup bowl standing untouched on the table. In the bed, Torgunna was sleeping sweetly against the wall. But Ragnfrid Ivarsdatter lay on the edge with her hands crossed over her breast—dead and already nearly cold. Simon and Ramborg went to her funeral, which was very beautiful."
"«Ja, han synes å tro deg altfor godt,» lo Erlend og grov sine fingre inn i det lyse håret og de faste, hvite skuldre.","""Yes, he seems to believe you all too well,"" Erlend laughed, roughing his fingers into his blonde hair and firm white shoulders.","“Aye, it seems indeed that he trusts you all too well,” laughed Erlend, burying his fingers in the bright hair on her firm white shoulders.","“Yes, he does seem to trust you too well,” laughed Erlend, digging his fingers into her fair hair and her firm, white shoulders. “Do you think so?”"
"«Sørg ikke mere for det som du har å angre mot meg, Kristin.

Ikke er du slik at du vil sette deg ned og syte og sutre, men tenke på å berge arven her for avkommet ditt selv når ingen andre har omtanke for slikt. Og det vet du vel at du kan lite på meg, jeg vil hjelpe deg så meget som jeg har evne til. Du får minnes det at jeg er uvant med bondestell.

And methinks you know that you can trust me, and that I will help you as far as in me lies. You must bear in mind that I am unused to farm work.

"Som av seg selv hadde Simon funnet igjen den skikk og holdning som han hadde nemmet i ungdommen – han hadde også gitt seg og tatt imot til låns av Stig en sid, brun kledeskledning, så han skilte seg ikke ut fra de andre menn i utseende heller. Men han satt og kjente seg til mote som han skulle være midt i en drøm, han var og han var ikke den samme som hin unge Simon Darre, en kvikk og kurteis riddersønn som hadde båret håndduk og kjerte til kong Håkon i Oslo kongsgård for evig mange vintre siden. Han var og han var ikke Simon bonde av Formo, som hadde levd sitt frie og muntre liv nord i dalen i alle disse årene – sorgløs på sett og vis, enda han hadde visst alle dager at inni ham lå denne glo og ulmet – men han snudde sine tanker fra det. Det steg en dump og truende opprørsvilje i mannen – det var ingen villet synd eller skyld av ham, det han visste om, men skjebnen, som hadde pustet den i lys lue, og han måtte stri og late som intet, mens han ble stekt over langsom ild.","As if by himself, Simon had regained the custom and attitude he had adopted in his youth - he had also given himself up and borrowed from Stig a silk, brown dress, so he did not stand out from the other men in appearance either . But he sat and felt for fashion as if he were in the middle of a dream, he was and he was not the same as the young Simon Darre, a nimble and polite knight's son who had carried a towel and cart to King Håkon in Oslo royal court forever many winters ago. He was and he was not Simon the farmer of Formo, who had lived his free and cheerful life north of the valley all these years - carefree in a way, though he had known every day that inside him lay this glare and smolder - but he turned his thoughts from it. There was a dull and threatening rebelliousness in the man - there was no willful sin or guilt of him, what he knew about, but fate, which had breathed it in light hat, and he had to fight and pretend like nothing, while he was fried over slow fire.","Without effort Simon seemed to have found again the mannerly and courtly bearing he had learned in his youth, and, since he had yielded and taken from Stig the loan of a long brown dress of state, in outward looks, too, he differed in no wise from the other men. But as he sat there he felt as though he were in the midst of a dream — he was and he was not the same as yonder young Simon Darre, the quick-witted and kurteis son of a noble knight, who had borne napkin and taper before King Haakon in Oslo Palace an endless tale of winters agone — he was and he was not Simon, the esquire of Formo, who had lived a life of freedom and cheer away north in the Dale through all these years — free from care, after a fashion, though he had known all his days that within him lay this glowing ember — but he turned his thoughts away from it. A dull and threatening humour of revolt rose up in the man — it was no willed sin or fault of his that he knew of, but fate, that had blown the embers into a blaze, so that he must strive and make no sign while roasting over a slow fire.","Without even thinking, Simon had assumed the bearing and demeanor he had learned in his youth. He had relented and agreed to borrow from Stig a brown silk garment so that his attire was no different from what the other men wore. But he sat there feeling as if he were in a dream. He was and yet he was not the same man as that young Simon Darre, the alert and courtly son of a knight who had carried towels and candles for King Haakon in the Oslo castle an endless number of winters ago. He was and was not Simon the owner of Formo who had lived a free and merry life in the valley for all these years—largely without sorrows, although he had always known that within him resided that smoldering ember; but he turned his thoughts away from this. A stifled, ominous sense of revolt rose up inside the man—he had never willfully sinned or caused any trouble that he knew of, but fate had fanned the blaze, and he had to struggle to keep his composure while he was being roasted over a slow fire."
"«Ja kunne jeg – tro det – så fast som dere!

"Simon tenkte at det fikk bli den aller siste utvei, at Kristin skulle knele for fru Ingebjørg.

"«Det er så,» sa presten skarpt. «Men ikke tror du nu vel, Kristin, at det har levd en vigselmann som ikke måtte verge seg selv mot fienden i det samme laget han skulle også friste å verge lammene mot ulven –»","""It is so,"" said the priest sharply.

"FØRST PÅ NYÅRET FIKK de en dag uventede gjester på Husaby. Det var Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn og gamle Smid Gudleikssøn fra Dovre, og de kom i følge med to herrer som Kristin ikke kjente.

Men herr Erling forklarte at de hadde truffet sammen inne på Neset, han hadde sittet med Lavrans og Smid i seksmannsdommen som nu endelig hadde skilt arvetvisten mellom herr Jon Haukssøns utarvinger. Så hadde han og Lavrans falt i tale om Erlend, og Erling, som hadde ærend i Nidaros, kom da på at han kunne ha god hug til å hilse ut på Husaby hvis Lavrans ville slå følge og seile nord med ham.

But Mr. Erling explained that they had met together on Neset, he had sat with Lavrans and Smid in the six-man sentence which had now finally separated the inheritance dispute between Mr. Jon Hauksson's heirs. Then he and Lavrans had talked about Erlend, and Erling, who had errands in Nidaros, then realized that he could have good intentions to greet Husaby if Lavrans wanted to follow and sail north with him.

But Sir Erling made things clear, telling how they had met together at Nes of Raumsdal, where he had sat with Lavrans and Smid on the Court of Six* that had at last set at rest the dispute between Sir Jon Haukssön’s distant heirs. Lavrans and he had fallen into talk of Erlend, and the thought came to Sir Erling that, since he had an errand to Nidaros, he would like well to wait upon the folks at Husaby, if Lavrans would join him and sail north with him. Smid Gudleikssön said, laughing, that he had all but bidden himself to come along with them:","ONE DAY JUST after New Year’s, unexpected guests arrived at Husaby.

They grew full of talk and cheer, since the mistress hearkened to them and answered them kindly and cheerily. And Kristin showed the house-folk daily a calm and gentle face. She rebuked none harshly, but if any serving-maid should gainsay her bidding, the mistress seemed to think the girl knew not what to do, and quietly showed her how she would have the work done. It was thus Kristin had seen her father take things with new serving-men who grumbled — and no man at Jörungaard had ever offered to gainsay Lavrans a second time.","The serving women on the estate were no better than could be expected. Those farmers who kept close watch over their daughters did not send them to serve on an estate where the master had lived openly with a concubine and had placed such a woman in charge. The maids were lazy and not in the habit of obeying their mistress. But some of them soon came to like the fact that Kristin was putting the house in good order and personally lent a hand with their work. They grew talkative and joyful when she listened to them and answered them gently and cheerfully. And each day Kristin showed her house servants a kind and calm demeanor. She reprimanded no one, but if a maid refused her orders, then the mistress would act as if the girl did not understand what was asked of her and would quietly show her how the work was to be done. This was how Kristin had seen her father behave toward new servants who grumbled, and no man had tried twice to disobey Lavrans of Jørundgaard."
"Utpå sommeren, efter at boet var skiftet, gav Simon Mandvik over til Stig Håkonssøn, Halfrids farbrorsønn. Han drog til Dyfrin og satt der om vinteren.","Towards the end of the summer, after the estate had been changed, Simon Mandvik handed over to Stig Håkonssøn, Halfrid's uncle. He went to Dyfrin and sat there in the winter.","Well on in the summer, when the estate was settled, Simon made over Mandvik to Stig Haaksonssön, Halfrid’s uncle’s son.

He left for Dyfrin and stayed there all winter."
"Det ble den lystigste kveld Kristin hadde hatt på Husaby. Erlend truet broren til å sette seg i høysetet med henne; selv skar han for maten til ham og skjenket i hans beger. Første gang han drakk Gunnulf til, lutet han ned på ett kne og ville kysse broren på hånden: «Hill og sæl, herre! Vi må lære oss, Kristin, til å vise erkebiskopen sømmelig heder – jo visst blir du vel erkebiskop en gang, du Gunnulf!»","It was the happiest night Kristin had had at Husaby. Erlend threatened his brother to take the lead with her; he himself cut for the food to him and poured into his cup. The first time he drank Gunnulf, he leaned on one knee and wanted to kiss his brother on the hand: ""Hill and seal, sir! We must learn, Kristin, to show the archbishop honorable honor - of course you will become an archbishop one day, you Gunnulf! ""","It was the merriest evening Kristin had yet had at Husaby. Erlend forced his brother to sit with her in the high-seat; he himself carved for him and filled his cup. The first time he drank to Gunnulf, he kneeled down on one knee, and made as though to kiss his brother’s hand. “All hail, Lord! We must use us, Kristin, to show the Archbishop all seemly honour — nay, for Archbishop you surely will be one day, Gunnulf!”","That was the merriest evening Kristin had spent at Husaby. Erlend cajoled his brother into sitting in the high seat with her, while he himself sliced off food for him and replenished his goblet. The first time he drank a toast to Gunnulf, he got down on one knee and tried to kiss his brother’s hand. “Health and happiness, sir! We must learn to show the archbishop the proper respect, Kristin—yes, of course, you’ll be the archbishop someday, Gunnulf!”"
"Erlend var blitt mørkerød i ansiktet – han løftet knyttneven mot henne – så snudde han brått om på hælen, grep sin kappe og sverdet fra benken ved døren og fór ut.","Erlend had turned dark red in the face - he raised his fist towards her - then he abruptly turned on his heel, grabbed his cloak and sword from the bench by the door and went out.","Erlend’s face flushed darkly red — he lifted his clenched fist — then turned sharp about on his heel, seized his cloak and sword from the bench by the door, and rushed out.","Erlend’s face had flushed dark red. He raised his fist at her, then turned swiftly on his heel, grabbed his cape and sword from the bench near the door, and rushed out."
"«Ja, du vet vel det at far min svarer deg ikke nei den dagen du spør om meg,» sa hun. «Jeg er så voksen nu, jeg kan godt giftes i år.»","""Yes, you know that my father will not answer you the day you ask me,"" she said. ""I'm so grown up now, I might as well get married this year.""","“Aye, you know well enough my father will not answer no the day you ask for me,” she said. “I am so grown up now, I might well wed this year.”","“You know quite well that my father wouldn’t refuse you if you asked for my hand,” she said. “I’m old enough now that I could be married this year.”"
"«Du gjør deg så barnslig ofte at en kan ikke snakke med deg,» sa Erlend oppgitt. «Gud hjelpe meg, Kristin, du blir tyve år i vår – og det er da noen vintre siden du måtte regnes for voksen kone –»","""You make yourself so childish often that no one can talk to you,"" Erlend said resignedly. ""God help me, Kristin, you will be twenty years old this spring - and it's been a few winters since you had to be considered an adult wife -""","“You show you so childish sometimes, a man can scarce talk with you,” said Erlend in despair. “God help us, Kristin, you will be twenty come next spring — and more winters than one are gone by since you must needs be accounted a grown woman — ”","“You often act so childish that it’s impossible to talk to you,” said Erlend in resignation. “God help me, Kristin, you’re going to be twenty this spring—and several winters have passed since you had to be considered a grown-up woman.”"

"«Hvorfor gjør du dette,» hvisket hun til slutt. «Tenker du jeg unner ikke vår datter ringen hennes –»","""Why are you doing this,"" she whispered at last. ""Do you think I do not treat our daughter to her ring -""",“Why do you this?” she whispered at last. “Think you I grudge our daughter her ring?”,“Why are you doing this?” she whispered at last. “Do you think I begrudge our daughter her ring?”
"Erlend ergret seg meget over at hustruen ikke ville følge med ham noen steder. Syk kunne han ikke merke at hun var – hun hverken dånet bort eller brakk seg denne gangen, det såes ikke på henne enda – og blek og trett ble hun vel av å sitte inne støtt og grunne og ruge over hans misgjerninger. Det var ved juletider – det kom til heftige tretter mellom dem. Og nu kom ikke Erlend og gjorde avbikt for sin hissighet, som han alltid hadde pleid før. Inntil nu hadde han alltid trodd, når det var uenighet mellom dem, så bar han skylden. Kristin var god, hun hadde alltid rett, og når han illtrivdes og kjedet seg hjemme, så var det hans natur som var slik at han ble trett av det gode og det rette hvis han fikk for meget av det. Men denne sommeren hadde han mere enn én gang merket at værfaren gav ham medhold og syntes å mene Kristin lot det skorte på hustruelig blidhet og fordragelighet. Det falt ham da inn at hun var smålig nærtagende og vanskelig tilgav ham små synder som ikke hadde vært så vondt ment fra hans side. Alltid hadde han bedt om hennes tilgivelse, når han fikk tenkt seg litt om – og hun hadde sagt at hun tilgav, men bakefter hadde han fått se at det var gjemt, ikke glemt.","Erlend was very upset that his wife would not go with him anywhere. He could not notice that she was sick - she neither thundered away nor broke down this time, it is not seen on her yet - and she became pale and tired from sitting inside steady and shallow and brooding over his misdeeds. It was at Christmas time - there were violent quarrels between them. And now Erlend did not come and make amends for his fury, as he had always used to do. Until now he had always believed that when there was disagreement between them, he was to blame. Kristin was good, she was always right, and when he was unhappy and bored at home, it was his nature that made him tired of the good and the right if he got too much of it. But this summer he had more than once noticed that the weather father had supported him and seemed to think Kristin was lacking in wife's gentleness and tolerance. It then occurred to him that she was petty touching and difficult to forgive him small sins that had not been so badly intended on his part. He had always asked for her forgiveness, when he thought about it a little - and she had said that she forgave, but afterwards he had seen that it was hidden, not forgotten.","Erlend chafed much that his wife would not go about with him anywhither. Sick he could not mark that she was — she neither swooned away nor vomited this time — no sign was to be seen upon her yet — and most like her paleness and weariness were from evermore sitting indoors brooding and pondering over his misdeeds. Yule-tide came round — and hot quarrels arose between them. And now Erlend no longer came afterward to beg forgiveness for his hot temper, as he had ever used to do before. Till now he had thought always, when there was strife between them, that ’twas he was at fault. Kristin was good; she was ever in the right; and if he wearied and was ill at ease in his home, it was but that his nature was such that he grew weary of what was good and right when he had too much of it. But last summer he had marked more than once that his father-in-law held with him, and seemed to deem that Kristin was lacking in wifely gentleness and forbearance. And then it came into his thought that she took things to heart in a petty way and was hardly brought to forgive him small misdeeds that had not been so ill meant on his part. Always had he prayed her for forgiveness when he had had time to think — and she had said that she forgave, but afterward he had been made to see that ’twas hidden away, but not forgotten.","Erlend was greatly annoyed that his wife refused to accompany him anywhere. He couldn’t see that she was ill; she neither swooned nor vomited this time, and it was not even visible that she was with child. And by constantly sitting indoors, brooding and worrying over his misdeeds, she had grown weary and pale. It was during the Christmas season that fierce quarrels erupted between them. But this time Erlend didn’t come and apologize for his bad temper, as he had in the past. Until now, whenever they had disagreements, he had always believed that he was to blame. Kristin was good, she was always right; if he felt uncomfortable and bored at home, then it must be because it was his nature to grow weary of what was good and right if he had too much of it. But this summer he had noticed more than once that his father-in-law had sided with him and seemed to think Kristin was lacking in wifely gentleness and tolerance. It occurred to him that she was overly sensitive about petty matters and reluctant to forgive him for minor offenses which he had committed with no ill intent. He would always beg her forgiveness after taking time to reflect, and she would say that she forgave him. But afterwards he could see that it was simply stored away, not forgotten."
"Sunniva – hun kunne tenke hva hun ville. Han gikk ikke dit mere. Og Kristin kunne gjerne fare til Jørundgård for ham. Det ville kan hende nettopp være det tryggeste og beste for henne og barna, om de var vel av veien i Gudbrandsdalen i sommer. Siden ble han nok venner med henne igjen –.","Sunniva - she could think what she wanted. He did not go there anymore. And Kristin could easily go to Jørundgård for him. It might just be the safest and best for her and the children, if they were well off the road in Gudbrandsdalen this summer. Since then he probably became friends with her again -.","Sunniva — she might think what she would. Thither he would go no more. And Kristin might fare to Jörundgaard if she would, for him. ’ Twould mayhap be best and safest for her and the children if they were well out of the way in Gudbrandsdal this summer. Afterward there was no fear but he could make friends with her again.…",Sunniva. Let her think what she would. He wouldn’t go back there again. And Kristin could go off to Jørundgaard if she liked. It might be safest and best for her and the children to be far away in Gudbrandsdal this summer. Later on he would no doubt make amends with her again.

"Det var uvettig å tenke det skulle stått bedre for ham på noen måte i hine dager da han levde som i snører av synd med den andre – og med henne selv. I glimt efter glimt så hun hans åsyn fra den gang – herjet av sorgen, forvridd av lidenskap. Nei, nei, det var godt slik som det var nu. Han var bare litt for sorgløs og ubetenksom.","It was unreasonable to think that it would have been better for him in any way in those days when he lived as if in chains of sin with the other - and with herself. In flash after flash she saw his face from that time - ravaged by grief, distorted by passion. No, no, it was good the way it was now. He was just a little too carefree and thoughtless.","’Twas witless to think things could have been better with him in any wise in those days when he lived as in bonds of sin with that other — and with herself. Glimpse after glimpse came before her eyes of his face as it was in those days, ravaged with sorrow, drawn with passion. No, no, ’twas well as now it was. He was but somewhat too careless and unthinking.","It was senseless to think that things might have been better in some ways for him—and even for her—back when he was living tangled up in sin with that other woman.

"«Nei, nei, Lavrans, I trenger ikke være så kurteis –,» den andre slo litt utålmodig ut med hånden. «Det ble som jeg sa,» mælte han mørkt. «Herresveinene her i landet er det nu ingen som kan samle. De holder seg frem som har best mathug – noe er der enda i trauet. Men de som kunne trå efter å vinne makt og rikdom på slikt vis som det fulgte heder med før i fedrene våres tid, de kommer ikke frem.»","""No, no, Lavrans, you do not have to be so polite -,"" the other struck out a little impatiently with his hand. ""It turned out as I said,"" he said darkly. «The gentlemen in this country, now no one can gather. They stick out who have the best food cravings - something is still there in the trough. But those who could strive to gain power and wealth in such a way as came with honor before in the time of our fathers, they do not come forward. ""","“Nay, nay, Lavrans, no need for so much kurteisi.” He struck out a little impatiently with his hand. “ ’Tis even as I said then,” he went on gloomily. “None now can bring together the nobles of this land. They push to the front that are most fain to fill their bellies — there is yet some meat left in the trough. But they that might aspire to win might and riches by such service as was held in honour in our father’s days, they come not forth!”","“No, no, Lavrans, you need not be so formal.” A little impatiently, Erling threw out his hands. “It was as I said,” he continued gloomily. “There’s no one here who can unite the nobles of this country. Whoever has the greatest hunger forces his way forward—there’s still some food in the trough. But those who might attempt to win power and wealth in an honorable manner, as was done in the time of our fathers, are not the ones who come forward now.”"
"Han tok hundene sine, spyd og bue og gikk opp på fjellet samme kveld. Det var meget sne innpå vidden enda; han gikk om seteren og fikk seg ski, lå innved vannet syd for Rånekampene og veidet ren en ukes tid. Men den kvelden han drog nedover mot bygden igjen, ble han atter urolig og redd. Det kunne være likt Ramborg at hun hadde talt til sin far om det allikevel. Da han satte utover vollen forbi Jørundgårds seter, så han at det røk opp av taket og gnistret. Han tenkte det var kanskje Lavrans selv som var der, og gikk opp til selet.","He took his dogs, spears and bow and went up the mountain that night. There was still a lot of snow on the plateau; he walked around the manor and got his skis, lay by the water south of Rånekampene and weighed clean for a week. But the night he went down to the village again, he became restless and scared again. It could be like Ramborg that she had talked to her father about it anyway. When he sat across the embankment past Jørundgård's seats, he saw that it smoked up from the roof and sparkled. He thought it might be Lavrans himself who was there, and went up to the harness.","He called his dogs, took his spear and bow, and went up on the hills that same evening. There was much snow in on the uplands still; he struck off to his sæter and got him a pair of ski, then lay out for a week by the tarn south of the Boar Fells and hunted reindeer. But the evening he set off down towards home he grew uneasy and fearful again. ’ Twould be like Ramborg if she had spoken of it to her father in spite of all. When he came over the hillcrest by the Jörundgaard sæter, he saw smoke and sparks going up from the roof. He thought maybe ’twas Lavrans himself that was there, and he went up to the huts.","He took his dogs, his spear, and his bow and went up into the mountains that same evening. There was still a great deal of snow on the high plateau. He went to his hut to get a pair of skis and then stayed out by the lake south of the Boar Range and hunted reindeer for a week. But on the night he headed back toward the village, he grew uneasy and afraid again. It would be just like Ramborg to have said something to her father all the same. As he crossed the meadow near Jørundgaard’s mountain hut, he saw smoke and sparks coming from the roof. He thought Lavrans himself might be there, so he went over to the hut."
"Det hjalp henne alltid en stund. Hun visste da om mange folk, både menn og koner, som lite æret Gud og hans moder og dårlig holdt budene – men hun hadde ikke sett at de fikk vanskapte barn for det. Ofte var Gud så barmhjertig at han refset ikke foreldrenes synder på de arme barna, om han nu en gang imellom måtte vise menneskene et tegn på at han kunne ikke tåle deres ondskap uavlatelig. Men det skulle da vel ikke nettopp bli hennes barn –.","It always helped her for a while.
