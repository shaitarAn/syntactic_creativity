"Jeg forsøgte at lægge en replik i munden på en munk, en replik, der skulle svulme af kraft og intolerance; men det ville ikke lykkes for mig. Så sprang jeg munken over og ville udarbejde en tale, dommerens tale til tempelskændersken, og jeg skrev en halv side på denne tale, hvorefter jeg stoppede. Der ville ikke lægge sig det rigtige klima over mine ord. Travlheden rundt om mig, lossesangene, gangspillene, der larmede, og den uafbrudte raslen fra jernkæderne harmonerede så dårligt med den luft af indelukket, muggen middelalder, der skulle stå som en tåge i mit drama. Jeg pakkede papirerne sammen og rejste mig op.","I tried to put a line in the mouth of a monk, a line that was to swell with force and intolerance; but it would not succeed for me. Then I skipped the monk over and wanted to draft a speech, the judge's speech to the temple scoundrel, and I wrote half a page on this speech, after which I stopped. There would not be the right climate over my words. The bustle around me, the unloading songs, the gongs that made noise, and the uninterrupted rustle of the iron chains harmonized so badly with the air of the enclosed, musty medieval that was supposed to stand like a fog in my drama. I packed the papers together and got up.","I tried to compose a few lines for one of the monks, some sentences absolutely power-mad and stuffed with narrow-mindedness, but I couldn't do it. So I skipped the monk and worked on a long speech, the speech the judge delivers to the whore who violated the temple; I wrote a half page on this and then had to give up. I couldn't get the right tone in the language. All the workaday life around me, the loading chants, the noise of the winches, the constant rattling of the iron chains, was incompatible with the moody, self-absorbed atmosphere of the Middle Ages, which I wanted to be present in my play like a fog. I shoved my papers together and stood up.","I tried to place a speech into a monk's mouth--a speech that ought to swell with pride and intolerance, but it was of no use; so I skipped over the monk and tried to work out an oration--the Deemster's oration to the violator of the Temple,--and I wrote half-a-page of this oration, upon which I stopped. The right local colour would not tinge my words, the bustle about me, the shanties, the noise of the gangways, and the ceaseless rattle of the iron chains, fitted in so little with the atmosphere of the musty air of the dim Middle Ages, that was to envelop my drama as with a mist. I bundled my papers together and got up.","I tried to shape up some lines from the lips of a monk, lines that ought to swell with intolerance and power, but I didn’t succeed.

My words just wouldn’t evoke the right atmosphere.

"Disse mennesker jeg mødte, hvor let og muntert de vuggede deres lyse hoveder og svingede sig gennem livet som gennem en balsal! Der var ikke sorg i et eneste øje, jeg så, ingen byrde på nogen skulder, måske ikke én overskyet tanke, ingen lille hemmelig smerte i nogen af disse glade sind. Og jeg gik der lige ved siden af disse mennesker, ung og nys udsprungen, og jeg havde allerede glemt, hvordan lykken så ud! Jeg kælede for denne tanke og kom frem til, at jeg var blevet skrækkelig uretfærdigt behandlet. Hvorfor havde de sidste måneder taget så mærkelig hårdt på mig? Jeg kunne slet ikke genkende mit lyse sind, og jeg havde de underligste plager på alle områder. Jeg kunne ikke sætte mig på en bænk for mig selv eller bevæge mig nogen steder hen uden at blive overfaldet af små og betydningsløse tilfældigheder, jammerlige bagateller, som trængte ind i mine forestillinger og spredte mine kræfter for alle vinde. En hund, der strøg forbi mig, en gul rose i en herres knaphul kunne sætte mine tanker i vibration og optage mig i længere tid. Hvad var der galt med mig? Havde Herrens finger peget på mig? Hvorfor netop på mig? Hvorfor ikke lige så gerne en mand i Sydamerika for den sags skyld? Når jeg tænkte på det, blev det mere og mere ubegribeligt for mig, at lige netop jeg skulle være udvalgt som prøveklud for Guds nådes griller. Det var en ret så ejendommelig fremgangsmåde at springe over en hel verden for at nå hen til mig; der var jo både antikvarboghandler Pascha og dampskibsekspeditør Hennechen.","These people I met, how easily and cheerfully they rocked their bright heads and swung through life like through a ballroom! There was no sorrow in a single eye I saw, no burden on any shoulder, perhaps not one cloudy thought, no little secret pain in any of these happy minds. And I went there right next to these people, young and sneezed, and I had already forgotten what happiness looked like! I caressed this thought and came to the conclusion that I had been terribly unfairly treated. Why had the last few months taken me so strangely hard? I could not recognize my bright mind at all and I had the strangest ailments in all areas. I could not sit on a bench for myself or move anywhere without being overwhelmed by small and insignificant coincidences, pitiful trifles, which penetrated into my notions and scattered my forces for all winds. A dog stroking past me, a yellow rose in a gentleman's buttonhole could put my thoughts in vibration and occupy me for longer. What was wrong with me? Had the Lord's finger pointed at me? Why on me? Why not just like a man in South America for that matter? As I thought about it, it became more and more incomprehensible to me that I should be chosen as the sample cloth for the grills of God's grace. It was a rather peculiar approach to skip a whole world to reach me; there were both antique bookseller Pascha and steamship forwarder Hennechen.","These people I met on the streets, how gaily and lightly they rolled their shining heads and swung through life as if through a ballroom! Not a single eye had grief in it, no shoulders had burdens, in these happy minds there was not a clouded thought, not even a tiny hidden pain. I walked there, alongside these creatures, young myself, hardly leafed out, and I had already forgotten what happiness was! I hugged these thoughts close to me, and found that a terrible injustice had been done to me. Why had these last few months gone so much against me? I could no longer remember my own joyful nature, and I had the strangest troubles coming from all sides. I could not sit on a park bench by myself or put my foot down anywhere without being besieged by tiny and pointless events, absurd nonsense, which forced itself into my brain and scattered my powers to the four winds. A dog that shot past me, a yellow rose in someone's lapel, could set my thoughts in motion and obsess me for hours. What was the matter with me? Had the hand of the Lord reached out and pointed at me? Well then, why me? Why not just as well at some man in South America? When I pondered these things, it seemed more and more incomprehensible why precisely I should have been chosen as the guinea pig for a whim of God's favor. It was an extremely odd way of going about things, to leap over the whole human race in order to arrive at me; for example, there was Pascha, the rare-book dealer, and Hennechen, the steamship clerk.","How gaily and lightly these people I met carried their radiant heads, and swung themselves through life as through a ball-room! There was no sorrow in a single look I met, no burden on any shoulder, perhaps not even a clouded thought, not a little hidden pain in any of the happy souls. And I, walking in the very midst of these people, young and newly-fledged as I was, had already forgotten the very look of happiness. I hugged these thoughts to myself as I went on, and found that a great injustice had been done me. Why had the last months pressed so strangely hard on me? I failed to recognize my own happy temperament, and I met with the most singular annoyances from all quarters. I could not sit down on a bench by myself or set my foot any place without being assailed by insignificant accidents, miserable details, that forced their way into my imagination and scattered my powers to all the four winds. A dog that dashed by me, a yellow rose in a man's buttonhole, had the power to set my thoughts vibrating and occupy me for a length of time. * * * What was it that ailed me? Was the hand of the Lord turned against me? But why just against me? Why, for that matter, not just as well against a man in South America? When I considered the matter over, it grew more and more incomprehensible to me that I of all others should be selected as an experiment for a Creator's whims. It was, to say the least of it, a peculiar mode of procedure to pass over a whole world of other humans in order to reach me. Why not select just as well Bookseller Pascha, or Hennechen the steam agent?","These people that I met—how lightly and merrily they bobbed their bright faces, dancing their way through life as though it were a ballroom! There was no sign of grief in a single eye that I saw, no burden on any shoulder, not even a cloudy thought maybe, or a little secret suffering, in any of those happy hearts. While I, who walked there right beside these people, young and freshly blown, had already forgotten the very look of happiness! Coddling myself with this thought, I found that a terrible injustice had been done to me. Why had these last few months been so exceedingly rough on me? I couldn’t recognize my cheerful disposition anymore, and I had the weirdest troubles wherever I turned. I couldn’t sit down on a bench by myself or set foot anywhere without being attacked by small, trivial incidents, miserable trifles that forced their way among my ideas and scattered my powers to the four winds. A dog streaking past, a yellow rose in a gentleman’s buttonhole, could start my thoughts vibrating and occupy me for a long time. What was the matter with me? Had the Lord’s finger pointed at me? But why exactly me? Why not just as well at some person in South America, for that matter? When I pondered this, it became more and more incomprehensible to me why precisely I should have been chosen as a guinea pig for a caprice of divine grace. To skip a whole world in order to get to me—that was a rather odd way of doing things; there was, after all, both Pascha the second-hand book dealer and Hennechen the steamship agent."
"Jeg rejste mig igen op fra vinduet, gik hen til stolen med vaskekummen og stænkede lidt vand på mine blankslidte bukseknæ for at sværte dem og få dem til at se nyere ud. Da jeg havde gjort det, stak jeg som sædvanligt papir og blyant i lommen og gik ud.

"Jeg står oppe i vinduet og kan se, at moren bliver mere og mere vred; denne uhyggelige scene ophidser mig voldsomt, jeg kan ikke længere holde det ud, jeg råber ned til drengen, at han skal komme op til mig et øjeblik. Jeg råber to gange bare for at forstyrre dem, for at rive dem ud af dette optrin; sidste gang råber jeg meget højt, og moren vender sig forbløffet om og kigger op til mig. Og i samme øjeblik genvinder hun selvkontrollen, kigger frækt på mig, rigtigt overlegent kigger hun på mig, og trækker sig så tilbage med en irettesættende bemærkning til sin søn. Hun taler så højt, at jeg kan høre det, og siger til ham:","I stand up in the window and can see my mother getting more and more angry; this eerie scene excites me violently, I can no longer stand it, I shout down to the boy that he should come up to me for a moment. I shout twice just to disturb them, to tear them out of this scene; last time I shout very loudly and the mother turns around in amazement and looks up at me. And at the same moment, she regains self-control, looks naughtily at me, really superior, she looks at me, and then withdraws with a reprimanding remark to her son. She speaks so loud that I can hear it, and says to him:","I stood at the window watching the mother's anger rising.

I call down to the boy to come up to me for a minute; I call twice, just to distract them--to change the scene. The last time I call very loudly, and the mother turns round flurriedly and looks up at me. She regains her self-possession at once, looks insolently at me, nay, downright maliciously, and enters the house with a chiding remark to her offspring. She talks loudly, so that I may hear it, and says to him, ""Fie, you ought to be ashamed of yourself to let people see how naughty you are.""","I stand at the window and see the mother’s anger rising.

But she regains her composure on the spot, looks at me brazenly, downright arrogantly, and then marches off with a reproachful remark to her son.

"Og fjorden vuggede derude i tung ro, skibe og kluntede, brednæsede pramme rodede op i dens blyagtige overflade, sprængte striber udad mod højre og venstre og gled videre, mens røgen væltede ud af skorstenene som dyner, og maskinernes stempelslag trængte mat hen til mig i den klamme luft. Der var ingen sol og ingen vind, træerne bag ved mig stod våde, og bænken jeg sad på, var kold og rå. Tiden gik; jeg satte mig til at blunde, blev træt og frøs lidt på ryggen; lidt senere mærkede jeg, at mine øjne begyndte at falde i. Og jeg lod dem falde i ...","And the fjord rocked out there in heavy calm, ships and clumsy, broad-nosed barges rotted up in its lead-like surface, burst streaks outwards to the right and left and slid on, while the smoke spilled out of the chimneys like duvets, and the pistons of the machines penetrated mat to me in the clammy air. There was no sun and no wind, the trees behind me stood wet, and the bench I was sitting on was cold and raw.

There was no sun and no wind, the trees behind me were wet, and the bench I sat on was cold and damp. Time passed; I settled down to doze a little; grew sleepy and a bit chilly in my back.

"Jeg endevender uvilkårligt mine lommer efter to kroner. Den lidenskab, der vibrerer i hver eneste bevægelse hos de forbipasserende, selve gaslygternes gustne lys, den stille, skæbnesvangre nat, det hele er begyndt at angribe mig, denne luft, der er fuld af hvisken, omfavnelser, skælvende tilståelser, halvt udtalte ord, små hvin; en del katte elsker med høje skrig inde i porten til Blomqvist. Og jeg havde ikke to kroner. Det var en jammer, en elendighed uden mage at være så forarmet! Hvilken ydmygelse, hvilken vanære! Og jeg kom igen i tanke om en fattig enkes sidste skærv, som jeg ville have stjålet, en skoledrengs kasket eller lommetørklæde, en tiggers madpose, som jeg uden videre ville have taget med til kludehandleren og soldet op. For at trøste mig selv og forsvare mig begyndte jeg at opfinde alle mulige fejl ved disse glade mennesker, der gled forbi mig; jeg trak vredt på skuldrene og kiggede foragteligt på dem, efterhånden som de gik forbi, par efter par. Disse fordringsløse, bolchetyggende studenter, der troede de skejede europæisk ud, når de fik lov at klappe en sypige på brystet! Disse ungersvende, bankmænd, grosserere, boulevardløver, der ikke engang følte sig for gode til sømandskoner, kvægtorvets fede mariehøner, der lagde sig ned i den første og bedste porthvælving for en bajer eller to! Sikke nogen sirener! Pladsen ved siden af dem var stadig varm efter en brandmajor eller en staldkarl fra sidste nat; tronen var altid lige ledig, lige vidåben, vær så god, træd nærmere! ... Jeg spyttede langt hen ad fortovet uden at bekymre mig for, om det kunne ramme nogen, var vred, opfyldt af foragt for disse mennesker, der gned sig op ad hinanden og parrede sig lige for øjnene af mig.

The passion that vibrates in every movement of the passers-by, the dim light of the gas lights themselves, the quiet, fateful night, it all has begun to attack me, this air full of whispers, embraces, trembling confessions, half-spoken words, small squeals; some cats love with loud screams inside the gate to Blomqvist. And I did not have two crowns. It was a pity, a misery without equal to be so impoverished! What a humiliation, what a disgrace! And I came again to the thought of a poor widow's last shard, which I would have stolen, a schoolboy's cap or handkerchief, a beggar's lunch bag, which I would have easily taken to the cloth merchant and sold out. To comfort myself and defend myself, I began to invent all sorts of faults by these happy people who slipped past me; I shrugged angrily and looked contemptuously at them as they passed, pair by pair. These unassuming, candy-chewing students who thought they were shitting European when they were allowed to pat a sypige on the chest! These young men, bankers, wholesalers, boulevard lions who did not even feel too good for sailor wives, the fat ladybugs of the cattle market who lay down in the first and best gate vault for a beer or two! What sirens! The place next to them was still warm after a fire major or a stable man from last night; the throne was always just vacant, just wide open, please, step closer! ...

The sexual energy visible in all the gestures of those going by, even in the dim flame of the gas lamps, and the motionless steamy night had all begun to affect me-- this air filled with whispers, embraces, hesitant confessions, half-pronounced words, tiny squeals. Even the cats were making love with high-pitched shrieks in the door of Blomqvist's Café. And I didn't have two kroner. What a misery, unheard of, to be this broke! What a disgrace, what a humiliation! I started thinking again about the last mite of some poor widow which I wanted to steal, some schoolboy's cap or handkerchief, some beggar's sack which I would have taken instantly to a rag merchant and drunk up. To console myself, and give myself a little shield, I took to finding every possible fault with the happy people going by me: I shrugged my shoulders in disgust and looked contemptuously after them as they went by, couple after couple. These babyish, aimless, candy-eating students who think they are really being rakish and Continental every time they manage to pat a girl on the breast! These bachelors, bank clerks, butchers, philanderers who don't even draw the line at sailors' wives, or those fat sows from the cattle market who flop down in the nearest doorway for a glass of beer! What Helens! The place beside them still warm from some night watchman or horse hostler of the night before: the throne was always empty, always open, don't hesitate, step right up! . . . I gave a long spit over the sidewalk without bothering about whom it might hit, became furious, full of contempt for these people rubbing against each other and pairing off right before my eyes.

The passion that thrills through the movements of every one of the passers-by, the dim light of the gas lamps, the quiet pregnant night, all commence to affect me--this air, that is laden with whispers, embraces, trembling admissions, concessions, half-uttered words and suppressed cries. A number of cats are declaring their love with loud yells in Blomquist's doorway. And I did not possess even a florin! It was a misery, a wretchedness without parallel to be so impoverished. What humiliation, too; what disgrace! I began again to think about the poor widow's last mite, that I would have stolen a schoolboy's cap or handkerchief, or a beggar's wallet, that I would have brought to a rag-dealer without more ado, and caroused with the proceeds. In order to console myself--to indemnify myself in some measure--I take to picking all possible faults in the people who glide by. I shrug my shoulders contemptuously, and look slightingly at them according as they pass. These easily-pleased, confectionery-eating students, who fancy they are sowing their wild oats in truly Continental style if they tickle a sempstress under the ribs! These young bucks, bank clerks, merchants, flâneurs--who would not disdain a sailor's wife; blowsy Molls, ready to fall down in the first doorway for a glass of beer! What sirens! The place at their side still warm from the last night's embrace of a watch-man or a stable-boy! The throne always vacant, always open to newcomers! Pray, mount! I spat out over the pavement, without troubling if it hit any one. I felt enraged; filled with contempt for these people who scraped acquaintanceship with one another, and paired off right before my eyes. I lifted my head, and felt in myself the blessing of being able to keep my own sty clean.","I instinctively search my pockets for two kroner.

"Der gik en times tid, den gik så uendelig langsomt og trægt.

"Solen skinnede allerede ret stærkt, klokken var ti, og trafikken på Youngstorvet var i fuld bevægelse. Hvor skulle jeg gå hen?

Jeg står et stykke tid på balustraden og betragter livet under mig; i mellemtiden var det begyndt at dampe fra mit tøj. Sulten indfandt sig igen, gnavede i brystet, rykkede på sig, gav mig nogle små fine stik, der gjorde ondt på mig. Havde jeg virkelig ikke en eneste ven, en bekendt, som jeg kunne henvende mig til?

"Jeg sneg mig ind i en port og sværtede mine bukseknæ med spyt for at se anstændig ud, lagde mit tæppe fra mig bag ved en kasse i et mørkt hjørne, skråede over gaden og trådte indenfor i den lille butik.","I snuck into a gate and blackened my trouser knees with saliva to look decent, laid my blanket from me behind a box in a dark corner, slanted across the street, and stepped inside the small store.","I slipped into a doorway and darkened my trouser knees with a little spit so I'd look respectable, stowed my blanket behind a box in one dark corner, strode across the street, and entered the small store.","I stole into a doorway and blackened the knees of my trousers with spittle to try and make them look a little respectable, left the parcel behind me in a dark corner at the back of a chest, and entered the little shop.","I sneaked into a doorway and blackened the knees of my trousers with spit so I’d look fairly respectable, left my blanket behind a box in a dark corner, crossed the street and stepped into the little store."
"Det begyndte at skumre, jeg faldt mere og mere sammen, blev træt og lagde mig på sengen igen. For at få lidt varme i hænderne strøg jeg fingrene gennem håret, frem og tilbage, på kryds og tværs; der fulgte små totter med ud, løsnede tjavser, der lagde sig mellem fingrene og bredte sig ud over hovedpuden. Jeg tænkte ikke så meget på det netop da, det var, som om det ikke kom mig ved, jeg havde jo også rigeligt med hår tilbage på hovedet. Jeg forsøgte igen at rive mig selv ud af denne mærkelige halvsøvn, der gled gennem alle dele af min krop som en tåge; jeg rettede mig op, bankede mig over knæene med flad hånd, hostede så hårdt, jeg kunne for mit dårlige bryst, – og jeg faldt igen tilbage. Der var intet der hjalp; jeg døde hjælpeløst hen med åbne øjne, stirrede lige op i loftet. Til sidst puttede jeg pegefingeren i munden og begyndte at sutte på den. Noget begyndte at røre på sig i min hjerne, en tanke, der famlede sig frem derinde, et ravende sindssygt påfund: Hvad nu hvis jeg bed til? Og uden et øjebliks betænkning kneb jeg øjnene i og slog tænderne sammen.","It started to get dusky, I collapsed more and more, got tired and lay down on the bed again. To get some warmth in my hands, I stroked my fingers through my hair, back and forth, crosswise; small tufts followed, loosening tufts loosening between the fingers and spreading out over the pillow. I did not think much about it just then, it was as if it did not occur to me, I also had plenty of hair left on my head. I tried again to tear myself out of this strange half-sleep that slid through all parts of my body like a fog; I straightened up, knocked myself over the knees with a flat hand, coughed as hard as I could for my bad chest, - and I fell back again. There was nothing that helped; I died helplessly with open eyes, staring straight up at the ceiling. Eventually, I put my index finger in my mouth and started sucking on it. Something began to move in my brain, a thought groping its way in there, a ravening insane invention: What if I prayed? And without a moment's hesitation, I narrowed my eyes and clenched my teeth.","Dusk began to fall, I sank into myself more and more, grew tired and lay back on the bed. To warm my hands a bit, I pushed my fingers through my hair, back and forth, crossways and sideways; small handfuls came loose, tufts came away between my fingers and spread over the pillow. I didn't worry about that, it was as if it were not happening to me; I had plenty of hair anyway. After a while I attempted to rouse myself from this curious drowsiness which had floated into all my limbs like a fog; I sat up, coughed as hard as my chest would allow-- and fell back once more. Nothing to do, I was dying with open eyes, helpless, staring up at the ceiling. Finally I put my forefinger in my mouth and started sucking on it. Something started to flicker in my brain, an idea that had gotten free in there, a lunatic notion. Suppose I took a bite? Without a moment's hesitation I shut my eyes and clamped down hard with my teeth.","The dusk closed in; I sank more and more together, grew weary, and lay down on the bed again. In order to warm my fingers a little I stroked them through my hair backwards and forwards and crosswise. Small loose tufts came away, flakes that got between my fingers, and scattered over the pillow. I did not think anything about it just then; it was as if it did not concern me. I had hair enough left, anyway. I tried afresh to shake myself out of this strange daze that enveloped my whole being like a mist. I sat up, struck my knees with my flat hands, laughed as hard as my sore chest permitted me--only to collapse again. Naught availed; I was dying helplessly, with my eyes wide open--staring straight up at the roof. At length I stuck my forefinger in my mouth, and took to sucking it. Something stirred in my brain, a thought that bored its way in there--a stark-mad notion. Supposing I were to take a bite? And without a moment's reflection, I shut my eyes, and clenched my teeth on it.","It began to get dark. I drooped more and more, grew tired and lay back on the bed. To warm my hands a bit, I passed my fingers through my hair, back and forth and crisscross; small tufts of hair trailed along, loosened wisps that stuck to my fingers and spread over the pillow. I didn’t stop to think about it right then, it didn’t seem to concern me, and besides I had plenty of hair left. I tried once more to shake off this strange drowsiness, sliding like a fog through all my limbs; I sat up, beat my knees with the palms of my hands and coughed as hard as my chest would allow, only to fall back again.

Zacharias Bartel on it, and knock.","Cold and hungry and more and more distressed, I wandered up Karl Johan Street. I began cursing quite loudly and didn’t care if someone could hear me.

I snap my fingers and head for Tordenskjold Street, find a door with the name C. Zacharias Bartel on a card and knock."

"Jeg sprang op. Endelig var jeg vågnet. Der piblede lidt blod fra fingeren, og jeg slikkede det af lidt efter lidt.

"Her forlod jeg vejen og satte mig ned for at hvile. Så gik jeg i gang med at lede efter et egnet sted, begyndte at rage lidt lyng og grangrene sammen og lavede en seng oppe i en lille hældning, hvor der var nogenlunde tørt, åbnede min pakke og tog tæppet ud. Jeg var blevet træt og mørbanket af den lange tur og gik straks i seng.

"Jeg gik igen tilbage til min bænk og satte mig ned. Jeg følte mig meget urolig, og den store lirekasse, der var begyndt at spille lidt længere henne, gjorde det endnu værre.

Jeg lagde ikke mærke til, hvor jeg stod, jeg tænkte ikke over det: Larmen rundt om mig var frygtelig.","I was not sick but dull, I started sweating. I thought I would go to Stortorvet to rest a bit; but the road was long and arduous; finally I was almost there, I was standing on the corner of Torvet and Torvegaden.

I did not notice where I stood, I did not think about it: the noise around me was terrible.",". . . I wasn't sick, merely weak, and I started sweating again. I decided to go to the marketplace and rest there, but it was a long, tiresome walk. When I was nearly there, I stopped at the corner of Torvet Street and the marketplace. Sweat ran down in my eyes, clouded my glasses, and made me blind--I stopped to dry myself off a bit. I paid no attention to where I was standing, I didn't worry about it: the noise around me was terrific.","I was not ill, but faint; I broke into a sweat. I thought of going to the market-place to rest a while, but the way was long and wearisome; at last I had almost reached it. I stood at the corner of the market and Market Street; the sweat ran down into my eyes and blinded me, and I had just stopped in order to wipe it away a little. I did not notice the place I was standing in; in fact, I did not think about it; the noise around me was something frightful.","I wasn’t ill, just weak, and I broke into a sweat.

The sweat trickled down into my eyes, fogging up my glasses and blinding me, and I had just stopped to wipe my face. I didn’t notice where I was standing, gave it no thought. The noise around me was terrible."

"Straks jeg slog øjnene op, begyndte jeg af gammel vane at tænke efter, om jeg havde noget at glæde mig til i dag. Det havde været lidt knapt for mig i den sidste tid; den ene efter den anden af mine ejendele var blevet bragt hen til „Onkel“, jeg var blevet nervøs og irritabel, et par gange havde jeg endda været sengeliggende en dags tid på grund af svimmelhed. Nu og da, når heldet var med mig, kunne jeg drive det til at få fem kroner af et eller andet blad for en føljeton.","As soon as I opened my eyes, out of old habit, I began to wonder if I had anything to look forward to today. It had been a little scarce for me lately; one after another of my belongings had been brought to ""Uncle"", I had become nervous and irritable, a few times I had even been bedridden for a day due to dizziness. Now and then, when luck was with me, I could drive it to get five dollars off some magazine for a serial.","As soon as I was wide awake, I took to thinking, as I always did, if I had anything to be cheerful about today. Things had been a bit tight for me lately; one after the other of my possessions had been taken to my ""uncle"" at the pawnshop; I was becoming more and more nervous and irritable, and several mornings lately I had been so dizzy I had had to stay in bed all day. Occasionally when my luck was good I took in five kroner or so from one of the newspapers for an article.","The instant I opened my eyes I began, from sheer force of habit, to think if I had anything to rejoice over that day. I had been somewhat hard-up lately, and one after the other of my belongings had been taken to my ""Uncle. "" I had grown nervous and irritable.

"Og mørket rugede rundt om mig, alting var stille, alting. Men oppe i højden susede den evige sang, vejret, den fjerne, tonløse summen, som aldrig tier stille. Jeg lyttede så længe til denne endeløse, syge susen, at det begyndte at gøre mig forvirret; det var virkelig symfonierne fra de rullende verdener over mig, stjerner, der intonerede en sang ...","And the darkness brooded around me, everything was quiet, everything. But up in the heights whispered the eternal song, the weather, the distant, toneless hum, which never remains silent. I listened so long to this endless, sick hiss that it began to confuse me; it was really the symphonies from the rolling worlds above me, stars intoning a song ...","The darkness brooded around me. Nothing moved. But high above my head rustled endless music, the air, that distant tuneless humming which never fell silent.

"Ak, det var bare boglig tale og litteratur, som jeg endda forsøgte at formulere godt midt i min elendighed, det blev til tale. Jeg står der måske en halv time og hikster og hvisker og støtter mig til porten. Så hører jeg stemmer, en samtale mellem to mænd, der kommer gående ind ad Smedegangen. Jeg vakler væk fra porten, slæber mig af sted langs med husvæggene og kommer igen ud i de lyse gader. Da jeg sjosker ned ad Youngsbakken, begynder min hjerne pludselig at flintre af sted i en højst besynderlig retning. Jeg får den idé, at de elendige skure nede i udkanten af torvet, materialeboderne og de gamle buler med brugt tøj, dog var en skændsel for stedet. De ødelagde hele torvets udseende, var en skamplet på byen, føj, ned med skramlet! Og jeg gik og regnede efter i tankerne, hvor meget det mon ville komme til at koste at flytte Den Geografiske Opmåling derned, denne smukke bygning, som altid har tiltalt mig så meget, hver gang jeg er gået forbi den. Det ville måske ikke lade sig gøre at foretage en flytning af den slags til mindre end halvfjerds til tooghalvfjerds tusinde kroner, – en pæn sum, måtte man sige, en ret så anselig lommeskilling, hæ-hæ, til en begyndelse. Og jeg nikkede med mit tomme hoved og indrømmede, at det var en ret så pæn lommeskilling at begynde med. Jeg rystede stadig over hele kroppen og kom stadig nu og da med en dyb hiksten efter gråden.","Alas, it was just bookish speech and literature that I even tried to formulate well in the midst of my misery, it became speech. I stand there for maybe half an hour, hiccuping and whispering and supporting myself to the gate. Then I hear voices, a conversation between two men who come walking in along Smedegangen. I stagger away from the gate, drag myself along the house walls and come out again into the bright streets. As I jog down Youngsbakken, my brain suddenly begins to flicker away in a most peculiar direction. I get the idea that the miserable sheds down on the edge of the square, the material stalls and the old dents with used clothes, however, were a disgrace to the place. They ruined the whole appearance of the square, was a stain on the city, add, down with the rattles! And I went and calculated in my mind how much it would cost to move the Geographical Survey down there, this beautiful building that has always appealed to me so much every time I have passed it. It might not be possible to make a move of that kind to less than seventy to seventy-two thousand kroner - a nice sum, one might say, a rather considerable pocket money, ha-ha, to begin with. And I nodded with my empty head and admitted that it was a pretty nice pocket penny to begin with. I was still shaking all over my body and still came every now and then with a deep hiccup after crying.","Hell! All I was capable of, even deep in misery, was rhetoric and belles-lettres, it was all talk. I stood there maybe a half hour, hiccuping and whispering and holding on to the gate. Finally I heard voices, a conversation between two men who were coming into the yard. I slunk away from my spot, pulled myself along by holding on to the sides of houses, and came out into the lit streets. While I staggered on down Youngsbakken Street, my brain suddenly started off in a most peculiar direction. It struck me that the old shacks in the corner of the marketplace, the lean-tos holding miscellaneous stuff, and the ancient stalls with secondhand clothes were really a disgrace to the town. They destroyed the view in the market, ruined the city, ugh, tear the whole mess down! I walked along, turning over in my mind what the cost would likely be to move the Geographical Society Building, whose lovely lines always pleased me whenever I passed it, down there. Probably a moving job of that sort couldn't be done for less than seventy to seventy-two thousand kroner--a nice sum, one might say, a tidy little sum as spending money, to start with anyway. And I nodded my empty head, and agreed that it would be a tidy enough sum for spending money, to start with. My whole body was shivering, and I hiccuped deeply now and then after my long cry.","I tremble with excitement and exhaustion, and stand on the same spot, still whispering oaths and abusive epithets, hiccoughing after the violent crying fit, broken down and apathetic after my frenzied outburst of rage. I stand there for maybe an hour, hiccough and whisper, and hold on to the door. Then I hear voices--a conversation between two men who are coming down the passage. I slink away from the door, drag myself along the walls of the houses, and come out again into the light streets. As I jog along Young's Hill my brain begins to work in a most peculiar direction. It occurs to me that the wretched hovels down at the corner of the market- place, the stores for loose materials, the old booths for second-hand clothes, are really a disgrace to the place--they spoilt the whole appearance of the market, and were a blot on the town, Fie! away with the rubbish! And I turned over in my mind as I walked on what it would cost to remove the Geographical Survey down there--that handsome building which had always attracted me so much each time I passed it. It would perhaps not be possible to undertake a removal of that kind under two or three hundred pounds. A pretty sum--three hundred pounds! One must admit, a tidy enough little sum for pocket-money! Ha, ha! just to make a start with, eh? and I nodded my head, and conceded that it was a tidy enough bit of pocket-money to make a start with. I was still trembling over my whole body, and hiccoughed now and then violently after my cry.","Alas, it was nothing but rhetoric and literature, which I tried to get right even in the midst of my misery—it turned into a speech.14 I stood there maybe for half an hour, gasping and whispering while holding on to the gate. Then I hear voices, a conversation between two men who are coming toward me down the Smiths’ Passage. I stagger away from the gate, drag myself along the walls of the buildings and come out onto the bright streets again. As I shuffle down Youngsbakken Lane, my brain suddenly begins to act in an extremely strange manner. It occurs to me that those wretched hovels at the edge of the marketplace, the storage shacks and the old stalls with second-hand clothing, were a real disgrace to the place. They spoiled the entire appearance of the marketplace and were a blot on the city —ugh, away with the junk! As I walked along, I turned over in my mind what it would cost to move the Geodetic Survey down there, that handsome building which had always appealed to me so much each time I passed it. It might not be possible to undertake a move of that kind for less than seventy to seventy-two thousand kroner—a tidy sum, one had to admit, quite a neat piece of change, heh-heh, to start with anyway. And I nodded my empty head and admitted that it was quite a nice bit of change to start with. My whole body was still shaking, and I gave deep gasps every now and then after my bout of tears."

Da jeg havde stået og sundet mig et øjeblik og undret mig, gik jeg ind ad porten for anden gang, lige ind til Beværtning & Logi for Rejsende.

I collected myself for a moment and wondered about it all, and then walked in through the door for the second time, right into the Food and Lodging for Travelers.

"Det smagte ikke af noget; en kvalmende lugt af gammelt blod stod op fra benet, og jeg begyndte straks at kaste op. Jeg forsøgte igen; hvis bare jeg fik lov til at holde det i mig, ville det sikkert hjælpe; det gjaldt om at få det til at falde til ro dernede. Men jeg kastede igen op. Jeg blev vred, bed heftigt i kødet, flåede en lille smule af det og sank det med vold og magt. Og det nyttede alligevel ikke noget; lige så snart de små kødtrevler var blevet varme i munden, kom de op igen. Jeg knyttede hænderne som en vanvittig, brast i gråd af hjælpeløshed og gnavede som en besat; jeg græd, så benet blev vådt og snavset af tårer, kastede op, bandede og gnavede igen, græd, som om mit hjerte skulle briste, og kastede igen op.

"Men jeg stoppede op igen. Jeg måtte være helt usandsynligt mager. Og øjnene var på vej ind gennem hovedet. Hvordan så jeg egentlig ud? Det var da også som den lede fanden, at man skulle lade sig blive vanskabt i levende live på grund af sult! Jeg mærkede raseriet endnu en gang, hvordan det blussede op en sidste gang, en sene der trak sig sammen. Gud fri mig vel sikken et ansigt, hvad? Her gik jeg rundt med et hoved som der ikke fandtes mage til i hele landet, med et par næver, der gudhjælpemig kunne kvase bybude til mel og støv, og sultede mig selv, så jeg blev vanskabt midt i Kristiania by! Var der nogen orden og mening med det? Jeg havde lagt mig i selen og slidt og slæbt gennem dage og nætter som en krikke, der slæber på en præst; jeg havde læst øjnene ud af knolden på mig selv og sultet forstanden ud af hjernen – hvad fanden havde jeg fået ud af det? Selv gadepigerne slog kors for sig over mit udseende. Men nu kunne det være nok – kan du forstå det! – Nok kunne det djævelen tage mig være! ... Med stadigt tiltagende raseri, mens jeg skar tænder ved følelsen af min mathed, mens jeg græd og bandede, blev jeg ved med at buldre løs uden at tage mig af folk, der gik forbi. Jeg begyndte igen at plage mig selv, stødte med vilje panden ind i lygtepælene, pressede neglene dybt ind i håndryggene på mig selv, bed mig afsindigt i tungen, når den talte utydeligt, og jeg lo rasende hver gang det gjorde sådan nogenlunde ondt.","But I stopped again. I had to be completely improbably skinny. And the eyes were on their way in through the head. What did I really look like? It was also like the leading devil that one should let oneself be deformed alive due to hunger! I felt the rage once again how it flared up one last time, a tendon that contracted. God forbid me what a face, huh? Here I walked around with a head that was unmatched in the whole country, with a pair of fists that, for God's sake, could crush city messengers to flour and dust, and starved myself, so I was deformed in the middle of Kristiania city! Was there any order and meaning to it? I had put myself in the harness and worn and dragged through days and nights like a crutch dragging on a priest; I had read the eyes out of the tuber on myself and starved the mind out of the brain - what the hell had I gotten out of it? Even the street girls crossed themselves over my appearance. But now it could be enough - you can understand it! - Surely the devil could take me! ... With ever-increasing rage as I cut my teeth at the feeling of my dullness as I cried and cursed, I kept rumbling loose without taking care of people passing by. I began to torment myself again, deliberately thrusting my forehead into the lampposts, pressing my nails deep into the backs of my hands, biting me insanely into my tongue when it spoke indistinctly, and I laughed furiously every time it hurt so reasonably.","But then I stopped once more. I must be unbelievably thin. My eyes would soon be all the way through my head. I wonder how I actually look? What in the hell is going on that a man has to turn himself into a living freak out of sheer hunger? I felt rage one more time, its final flaring up, a muscular spasm. ""What's wrong with your face, eh?"" Here I was walking around with a better head than anyone else in the country, and a pair of fists that could, so help me God, grind a longshoreman into small bits, into powder, and I was becoming a freak from hunger in the middle of the city of Christiania! Was there any sense or reason in that? I had slept in the harness and worked day and night like a minister's mare; I had read till my eyes fell out of their sockets, and starved my hairs out of my head--and in hell's name, what for? Even whores on the street fled so as not to have to look at me. But now that was going to stop --do you hear me--stop, and hell take the whole thing! . . . With steadily increasing rage, I ground my teeth in despair, and with sobs and oaths I went on and roared wildly, paying no attention to the people going by. I started once more to punish my flesh, ran my forehead deliberately against lampposts, drove my fingernails deep into the backs of my hands, bit my tongue madly every time it failed to pronounce clearly and then laughed wildly whenever I caused a fairly good pain.","I felt over my cheeks with my hand; thin--naturally, I was thin--my cheeks were like two hollowed bowls; but Lord ...

It was the very deuce that one must let oneself turn into a living deformity for sheer hunger's sake. Once more I was seized by fury, a last flaring up, a final spasm. "" Preserve me, what a face. Eh? "" Here I was, with a head that couldn't be matched in the whole country, with a pair of fists that, by the Lord, could grind a navvy into finest dust, and yet I went and hungered myself into a deformity, right in the town of Christiania.

I had read my eyes out of their sockets, had starved the brains out of my head, and what the devil had I gained by it? Even a street hussy prayed God to deliver her from the sight of me. Well, now, there should be a stop to it. Do you understand that? Stop it shall, or the devil take a worse hold of me. With steadily increasing fury, grinding my teeth under the consciousness of my impotence, with tears and oaths I raged on, without looking at the people who passed me by. I commenced once more to martyr myself, ran my forehead against lamp-posts on purpose, dug my nails deep into my palms, bit my tongue with frenzy when it didn't articulate clearly, and laughed insanely each time it hurt much.","But I stopped again. I must be just incredibly thin. My eyes were sinking deep into my skull. What, exactly, did I look like? The devil only knew why you had to be turned into a veritable freak just because of hunger!

Here I was, with a head on my shoulders without its equal in the whole country, and with a pair of fists, by golly, that could grind the town porter to fine dust, and yet I was turning into a freak from hunger, right here in the city of Kristiania!

With ever-increasing rage, grinding my teeth in response to my fatigue, sobbing and cursing, I continued to rant and rave, paying no heed to the people passing by. I began once more to torture myself, running my head against the lampposts on purpose, digging my fingernails deep into the backs of my hands, and biting my tongue in frenzy when it didn’t speak clearly, and I laughed madly whenever it fairly hurt."
"Åh, nej, tak, det kunne man vel ikke. Nej, det kunne hun ikke gøre. Men hvis jeg ville være så flink at følge hende et stykke vej, så ... Der var ret så mørkt på hjemvejen, og hun var ikke meget for at skulle gå alene op ad Karl Johan, efter at det var blevet så sent.","Oh, no, thank you, I guess you could not. No, she could not. But if I would be so nice to follow her for a while, then ... It was quite dark on the way home, and she was not much for having to walk up Karl Johan alone after it had become so late.","No, thank you, she thought she'd better not. She couldn't do it. But would I be so kind as to walk with her a little way. It was rather dark, and it was embarrassing sometimes to walk up Karl Johan Street alone at this time of night.","Ah, no, thanks; she couldn't well do that. No! she couldn't do that; but would I be so kind as to accompany her a little way? She ... it was rather dark to go home now, and she was rather nervous about going up Carl Johann after it got so late.","No thanks, she thought she’d better not. No, she couldn’t do it. But if I would be so kind as to walk with her part of the way, then . . . It was quite dark going home, and she felt uncomfortable walking up Karl Johan Street alone at such a late hour."
"Det sneede endnu mere næste dag, en tung, regnblandet sne, store, blå tjavser, der faldt ned og blev til sjap. Vejret var råt og isnende.","It snowed even more the next day, a heavy, rain-mixed snow, big, blue chatter that fell down and turned to slush. The weather was raw and icy.","The next day it snowed still more, a heavy wet snow, great blue flakes that fell and turned to slush. The air was raw and cold.","It snowed still more the next day, a heavy snow mingled with rain; great wet flakes that fell to earth and were turned to mud.

Hvad hedder manden? spurgte han og vendte sig om på sædet.,"What's the man's name? he asked, turning around in his seat.","""What is the man's name?"" he asked, turning on his seat.","""What's the man's name?"" he inquired, turning round on the box.","“What is the man’s name?” he asked, turning around on the cox."
"Jeg sidder der på bænken og tænker over alt dette og er ret trist. Jeg følte væmmelse ved mig selv; selv mine hænder virkede frastødende på mig. Dette slatne, skamløse udtryk på mine håndrygge piner mig, giver mig en følelse af ubehag; jeg føler mig stærkt anfægtet ved synet af mine egne tynde fingre, jeg hader hele min indfaldne krop og gyser ved at skulle slæbe rundt på den, mærke den rundt om mig. Herregud, hvis bare der kunne komme en ende på det nu! Jeg ville inderligt gerne dø.","I sit there on the bench thinking about all this and am pretty sad. I felt disgust at myself; even my hands seemed repulsive to me. This sluggish, shameless expression on my back of my hand torments me, giving me a feeling of discomfort; I feel strongly challenged at the sight of my own thin fingers, I hate my whole sunken body and shudder at having to lug around it, feel it around me. My God, if only there could be an end to it now! I desperately wanted to die.",". . . I sat on the bench thinking all this over, feeling sad; I was disgusted at myself; even my hands looked revolting to me. The flabby and shameless expression on the back of my hands pained me, brought me disgust.

I sincerely wanted to die.","I sit there on the bench and ponder over all this, and am sad enough. I loathe myself. My very hands seem distasteful to me; the loose, almost coarse, expression of the backs of them pains me, disgusts me. I feel myself rudely affected by the sight of my lean fingers. I hate the whole of my gaunt, shrunken body, and shrink from bearing it, from feeling it envelop me. Lord, if the whole thing would come to an end now, I would heartily, gladly die!","I sit there on the bench mulling over all this and feeling quite dismal. I am disgusted with myself, even my hands appear loathsome to me. That flabby, shameless expression on the backs of my hands pains me, makes me uneasy. I feel rudely affected by the sight of my bony fingers, and I hate my whole slack body and shudder at having to carry it, to feel it around me. God, if only it would end! I yearned to die."
"Ja, hvad det angår, er der ingen problemer! svarede jeg. Om en otte dages tid vil jeg tro, at man har hørt om mig rundt omkring.","Yes, as far as that is concerned, there are no problems! I replied. In eight days' time I would think that people have heard of me all around.","""Don't worry on that score, at all!"" I answered. ""In about eight days' time, I think you will hear a lot more of me.""","""I have no great anxiety on that score,"" I replied. "" In eight days' time or so , I think you and all the folks will have heard a little more of me.""","“I have no great worries on that score,” I answered. “In a week or so I expect you will all have heard from me.”"

"Jeg påskyndede min gang, blev ved i en mere og mere overdrevet fart, gjorde pludselig venstre om og kom ophidset og vred ind i en lys, dekoreret port. Jeg stoppede ikke op, gjorde ikke så meget som et sekunds ophold; men hele det ejendommelige udstyr i porten trængte øjeblikkeligt ind i min bevidsthed, hver eneste ubetydelighed omkring dørene, dekorationerne, brolægningen stod klart for mit indre blik, idet jeg løb op ad trapperne. Jeg ringede heftigt på døren på første sal. Hvorfor skulle jeg absolut stoppe op på første sal? Og hvorfor absolut gribe fat i denne klokkesnor, der var længst væk fra trappen?","I accelerated my gait, kept going at an more and more exaggerated speed, suddenly turned left and came excited and writhing into a bright, decorated gate. I did not stop, did not do so much as a second stay; but all the peculiar equipment of the gate instantly penetrated my consciousness, every insignificance around the doors, the decorations, the paving stood clear before my inner gaze as I ran up the stairs. I rang loudly at the door on the first floor. Why should I absolutely stop on the first floor? And why absolutely grab hold of this bell string that was furthest away from the stairs?",". . . I increased my pace, pushed myself faster and faster, swung suddenly to the left, and strode excitedly and angrily into a light, elegant entry. I did not stop, did not pause a second--yet my consciousness took in the whole decorative arrangement of the vestibule in that half second: every insignificant detail of the doors, molding, floor tiling was utterly clear to me inwardly as I sprang up the stairs. I rang a bell violently on the third floor. Why did I stop precisely on the third floor? And why did I choose this bell, which was farthest from the stair?","I quickened my pace, hurried faster and faster, turned suddenly to the left and found myself, excited and angry, in a light ornate doorway. I did not pause, not for one second, but the whole peculiar ornamentation of the entrance struck on my perception in a flash; every detail of the decoration and the tiling of the floor stood clear on my mental vision as I sprang up the stairs. I rang violently on the second floor. Why should I stop exactly on the second floor? And why just seize hold of this bell which was some little way from the stairs?",". . . I quickened my walk, forging ahead faster and faster, swung suddenly to the left and, excited and angry, stepped into a light, decorated entranceway. I didn’t stop, not even for a second, but the entire curious décor of the entrance immediately penetrated my consciousness. As I ran up the stairs the most trifling details of the doors, the ornaments, and the paving stood out clearly in my mind’s eye. I furiously rang a bell on the second floor. Why did I stop exactly on the second floor? And why grab exactly this bell rope, which was the farthest from the stairway?"
"Nå, ja, hvad kom der så ud af det? spurgte jeg og holdt vejret imens.","Well, yeah, what came out of that then? I asked, holding my breath in the meantime.","""Yes, and what happened then?"" I asked, holding my breath.","""Indeed, did it? and what came of it? "" I inquired; and I held my breath for his reply.","“Well, what came of it?” I asked with bated breath."
"Jeg satte mig ned på sengen og kunne høre, hvordan nøglen blev drejet rundt. Den lyse celle så venlig ud; jeg følte mig godt og behageligt hjemme og lyttede med velbehag til regnen udenfor. Jeg kunne ikke have ønsket mig noget bedre end sådan en hyggelig celle! Min tilfredshed voksede; siddende på sengen med hatten i hånden og med øjnene fæstnet på gasflammen henne i væggen, gav jeg mig til at tænke de enkelte momenter i mit første møde med politiet igennem.

"Det var igen begyndt at regne, og jeg kunne allerede mærke vandet trænge igennem til mine skuldre. Ved Rådhuset fik jeg med ét en lys idé; jeg ville anmode politiet om at åbne porten.

"Jeg gik og diskuterede denne sag og kunne ikke komme af med den, jeg fandt de vægtigste indvendinger mod denne Herrens vilkårlighed i at lade mig tage stødet for alles skyld. Selv efter, at jeg havde fundet mig en bænk og sat mig ned, blev dette spørgsmål ved med at beskæftige mig og forhindre mig i at tænke på andre ting. Fra den dag i maj måned, hvor mine genvordigheder begyndte, kunne jeg så tydeligt mærke en svaghed, der tog til lidt efter lidt, jeg var ligesom blevet for mat til at styre og lede mig selv hen, hvor jeg ville; en sværm af små skadedyr havde trængt ind i mit indre og udhulet mig. Hvad nu hvis Gud ligefrem havde i sinde helt at ødelægge mig? Jeg rejste mig op og drev frem og tilbage foran bænken.","I went and discussed this matter and could not get rid of it, I found the most weighty objections to this arbitrariness of the Lord in letting me take the brunt for the sake of all. Even after I found myself a bench and sat down, this question kept me busy and preventing me from thinking about other things. From the day in the month of May, when my hardships began, I could so clearly feel a weakness that grew to little by little, I had just become too dull to steer and lead myself where I wanted; a swarm of small pests had penetrated my interior and hollowed me out. What if God actually intended to completely destroy me? I got up and drifted back and forth in front of the bench.","I walked along arguing with myself about these things, and could not stop; I came on the weightiest objections against the Lord's arbitrariness in letting me suffer for everyone else's sins.

From that day in May when my setbacks had begun, I could see clearly all the landmarks of a gradually increasing weakness: now I had become too feeble to steer or guide myself, so to speak, where I wanted to go; a cloud of tiny vermin had forced its way inside me and eaten me out hollow. And what if God had decided absolutely to finish me? I stood up and walked back and forth in front of my bench.","As I went my way I sifted this thing, and could not get quit of it.

"Ha, mage til uvederhæftig kagekone havde jeg dog aldrig set!

"Undervejs begyndte kusken at kigge sig tilbage, lægge sig ned og kigge ind i vognen, hvor jeg sad under regnslaget. Var han blevet mistænksom?

"Tiden gik. Jeg lod mig selv falde ned på et trappetrin ved siden af mig og tørrede sveden af min pande og hals, trak vejret dybt ind og tvang mig selv til at falde til ro. Solen gled ned, det var ud på eftermiddagen. Jeg begyndte igen at spekulere over min situation; sulten blev skamløs over for mig, og om nogle timer ville det være nat igen; det gjaldt om at finde en løsning, mens der stadig var tid til det. Mine tanker begyndte igen at kredse om logihuset, som jeg var blevet jaget væk fra; jeg ville aldeles ikke vende tilbage til det, men kunne alligevel ikke lade være at tænke på det. Egentlig havde konen været i sin fulde ret til at smide mig ud. Hvordan skulle jeg kunne vente at få lov til at bo hos nogen, hvis jeg ikke betalte for det? Hun havde oven i købet givet mig mad nu og da; selv i går aftes, hvor jeg havde gjort hende ophidset, havde hun budt mig på to smørrebrød, ud af ren storsindethed havde hun budt mig på dem, fordi hun vidste, at jeg trængte til dem. Så jeg havde intet at beklage mig over, og jeg begyndte, mens jeg sad på trappen, at tigge og bede hende i mit stille sind om tilgivelse for min opførsel. Især fortrød jeg bittert, at jeg havde vist mig utaknemlig over for hende til sidst, og smidt et papir i hovedet på hende ...","Time passed. I let myself fall down a flight of stairs next to me and wiped the sweat off my forehead and neck, took a deep breath and forced myself to calm down. The sun slid down, it was out in the afternoon. I again began to wonder about my situation; the hunger became shameless to me, and in a few hours it would be night again; it was about finding a solution while there was still time for it. My thoughts again began to revolve around the lodging house, from which I had been chased away; I would not return to it at all, but still could not help but think of it. Actually, the wife had been in her full right to throw me out. How could I wait to be allowed to live with someone if I did not pay for it? She had even given me food now and then; even last night where I had made her excited, she had offered me two sandwiches, out of sheer generosity she had offered me them because she knew I needed them. So I had nothing to complain about and I started, while sitting on the stairs, begging and asking her in my quiet mind for forgiveness for my behavior. In particular, I bitterly regretted that I had shown myself ungrateful to her in the end, and threw a piece of paper at her head ...","Some time passed. I let myself sink down on a stoop and dried the sweat from my neck and forehead, fanned myself, and forced myself to calm down. The sun slowly sank, it was late afternoon. I began to brood over my situation again; my hunger was ghastly, and in a few hours it would be night; I had to find a solution while there was still time. My thoughts started circling again about the lodging house I had been evicted from; I absolutely did not want to return there, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. The landlady had been well within her rights, of course, in throwing me out. How could I expect to live in someone's place when I didn't pay! On top of it all, she had given me food now and then--even last night, after I had annoyed her, she had offered me two slices of bread and butter, just out of her goodness, she offered them because she knew that I needed them. So I had no complaints coming, and while I sat there on the stoop, I started asking and begging her forgiveness, silently, for my behavior. I especially regretted bitterly having shown myself ungrateful to her at the end, throwing that envelope in her face.","Time went. I let myself sink down on the steps near me, and dried the sweat from my brow and throat, drew a couple of long breaths, and forced myself into calmness. The sun slid down; it declined towards the afternoon. I began once more to brood over my condition. My hunger was really something disgraceful, and, in a few hours more, night would be here again. The question was, to think of a remedy while there was yet time. My thoughts flew again to the lodging-house from which I had been hunted away. I could on no account return there; but yet one could not help thinking about it. Properly speaking, the woman was acting quite within her rights in turning me out. How could I expect to get lodging with any one when I could not pay for it? Besides, she had occasionally given me a little food; even yesterday evening, after I had annoyed her, she offered me some bread and butter. She offered it to me out of sheer good nature, because she knew I needed it, so I had no cause to complain. I began, even whilst I sat there on the step, to ask her pardon in my own mind for my behaviour. Particularly, I regretted bitterly that I had shown myself ungrateful to her at the last, and thrown half-a-sovereign in her face....","Time passed. I let myself sink down on the steps near me and wiped the sweat off my forehead and my neck, took a deep breath and forced myself to be calm. The sun was going down, the afternoon was wearing on. I began once more to brood on my situation. My hunger was getting outrageous, and in a few hours it would be night again; I had to think of a way out while there was still time. My thoughts began again to circle around the rooming house I had been driven away from; I certainly didn’t want to go back there but still couldn’t help thinking about it. Actually, the woman had every right in the world to throw me out. How could I expect people to put me up if I didn’t pay them! What’s more, she had given me food off and on; even last night, after I had provoked her, she had offered me two sandwiches, offered them to me out of kindness because she knew that I needed them. So I had nothing to complain about, and as I sat there on the steps I began to ask—no, beg—her forgiveness in my heart for the way I had behaved. Most of all, I was bitterly sorry I had shown myself ungrateful to her at the end and thrown that piece of paper in her face."

"Dermed forlod jeg ham. Han blev yderst forbavset over mig, stod og kiggede efter mig med åben mund og holdt stadig uret i hånden. Da jeg var kommet uden for Royal, vendte jeg mig om og kiggede tilbage; stadig stod han i samme stilling og fulgte mig med øjnene.","Thus, I left him. He was extremely amazed at me, stood looking at me with his mouth open and still holding the watch in his hand. When I had come outside the Royal, I turned around and looked back; still he stood in the same position and followed me with his eyes.","With that, I walked off. He was too astonished to speak, and stood looking after me with open mouth, still holding the watch in his hand.

"Jeg rejste mig op og stillede mig midt på gulvet. Når jeg tænkte det hele igennem, kom madam Gundersens opsigelse ret så belejligt. Dette var egentlig ikke et værelse for mig; der var nogle ret simple gardiner for vinduerne, og specielt mange søm på væggene til at hænge sin garderobe på var der heller ikke. Den stakkels gyngestol henne i hjørnet var i grunden ikke andet end en vittighed af en gyngestol, som man nemt kunne grine sig halvt ihjel af. Den var alt for lav til en voksen mand, desuden var den så trang, at man så at sige måtte bruge skohorn for at komme op af den igen. Kort sagt, værelset var ikke indrettet til at man kunne beskæftige sig med åndelige ting, og jeg agtede ikke at beholde det længere. Jeg ville overhovedet ikke beholde det! Alt for længe havde jeg fundet mig i og opholdt mig i dette skur.","I got up and stood in the middle of the floor. When I thought it all through, Madame Gundersen's resignation came quite conveniently. This was not really a room for me; there were some pretty simple curtains for the windows, and especially many nails on the walls to hang his wardrobe on were not there either. The poor rocking chair in the corner was basically nothing more than a joke of a rocking chair that one could easily laugh half to death at. It was far too low for a grown man, moreover, it was so cramped that you had to use shoehorns, so to speak, to get out of it again. In short, the room was not designed to deal with spiritual things, and I did not intend to keep it anymore. I would not keep it at all! For far too long I had found myself in and stayed in this shed.","I stood up and remained standing in the center of the room. All in all, Mrs. Gundersen's notice had come rather conveniently. This really wasn't any room for me; the curtains on the windows were a very ordinary green, and there weren't even enough pegs on the walls to hang your wardrobe on. The sad rocking chair in the corner was actually a joke of a chair: if one started laughing at it, one could die laughing. It was too low for a grown man, and besides, it was so tight, one needed a shoehorn to get back out of it. In short, this room was simply not furnished in a way appropriate to intellectual effort, and I did not intend to keep it any longer. I would not keep it under any circumstances! I had been silent in this hole and stood it here and stayed on here too long already.","I rose and came to a standstill in the middle of the floor. Everything well considered, Mrs. Gundersen's warning came rather opportunely. This was, properly speaking, no fit room for me: there were only common enough green curtains at the windows, and neither were there any pegs too many on the wall. The poor little rocking-chair over in the corner was in reality a mere attempt at a rocking-chair; with the smallest sense of humour, one might easily split one's sides with laughter at it. It was far too low for a grown man, and besides that, one needed, so to speak, the aid of a boot- jack to get out of it. To cut it short, the room was not adopted for the pursuit of things intellectual, and I did not intend to keep it any longer. On no account would I keep it. I had held my peace, and endured and lived far too long in such a den.","I got up and stood in the middle of the floor. Everything considered, Mrs. Gundersen’s notice was quite opportune.

That poor rocking chair over in the corner was actually only a poor excuse for a rocking chair, you could easily laugh yourself sick at it. It was much too low for a grown man, and so tight that you had to use a bootjack, so to speak, to get back out of it. In short, the room wasn’t furnished with an eye to intellectual pursuits, and I did not intend to keep it any longer. I wouldn’t keep it under any circumstances!

"Næppe. – For resten havde han med det samme kunnet høre, at jeg var fremmed, der var noget i mit tonefald, der sagde ham det. Der skulle så lidt til, han hørte så godt; om natten, når alle sov, kunne han høre menneskene i værelset ved siden af trække vejret ... Hvad var det, jeg ville sige, hvor bor De henne?","Hardly. By the way, he had immediately heard that I was a stranger, there was something in my tone that told him that. It took so little, he heard so well; at night, when everyone was asleep, he could hear the people in the room next door breathing ... What was it I wanted to say, where do you live?","Just barely. In any case, he could tell right away that I wasn't from here--there was something in my voice that told him.

""I wanted to ask you, where do you live?""","""Barely."" For that matter, he could hear directly that I was a stranger. There was something in my accent which told him.

"Gud, hvad du dog kan finde på! tænkte jeg fuld af harme; rende rundt som en gal i de her pjaskvåde gader midt i den mørke nat! Sulten gnavede ulideligt i mig og ville ikke lade mig være i fred. Igen og igen sank jeg spyt for på den måde at opnå mæthedsfølelse, og jeg syntes, det hjalp. Det havde været småt med mad for mig i adskillige uger, før det her skete, og kræfterne havde aftaget betydeligt på det seneste. Når jeg med en eller anden manøvre havde været heldig og fået stampet en femkrone op af jorden, kunne disse penge dårligt nok strække længe nok til, at jeg blev helt restitueret, inden en ny sultperiode overfaldt mig. Det var gået værst ud over min ryg og mine skuldre; den lille gnaven i brystet kunne jeg stoppe et øjeblik, hvis jeg hostede hårdt, eller hvis jeg gik stærkt foroverbøjet; men ryggen og skuldrene vidste jeg ikke, hvad jeg skulle stille op med. Hvordan kunne det dog være, at det slet ikke ville lysne for mig? Havde jeg måske ikke lige så meget ret til at leve som enhver anden, som antikvarboghandler Pascha og dampskibsekspeditør Hennechen? Havde jeg måske ikke skuldre som en kæmpe og to drabelige arme at arbejde med, og havde jeg måske ikke endda søgt en stilling som brændehugger i Møllergaden for at tjene til mit daglige brød? Var jeg doven? Havde jeg ikke søgt arbejde og lyttet til forelæsninger og skrevet avisartikler og læst og arbejdet nat og dag som en gal mand? Og havde jeg ikke levet som en gnier, spist brød og mælk, når jeg havde meget, brød, når jeg havde lidt, og sultet, når jeg ikke havde noget? Boede jeg måske på hotel, havde jeg måske en suite med værelser på første sal? I et skur boede jeg, i et blikkenslagerværksted, som gud og hver mand havde forladt over hals og hoved sidste vinter, fordi det sneede ind. Så jeg kunne aldeles ikke forstå, hvad det hele gik ud på.","God, what can you come up with though! I thought full of resentment; running around like crazy in these soaking wet streets in the middle of the dark night! Hunger gnawed unbearably at me and would not leave me alone. Again and again I sank saliva in order to achieve a feeling of satiety, and I thought it helped. It had been small with food for me for several weeks before this happened, and the forces had diminished considerably lately. When, with some maneuver, I had been lucky and had a penny stamped out of the ground, this money could hardly stretch long enough for me to be fully recovered before a new period of starvation struck me. It had gone worst over my back and my shoulders; the little gnaw in my chest I could stop for a moment if I coughed hard, or if I went strongly bent forward; but my back and shoulders I did not know what to line up with. How could it be that it would not brighten for me at all? Maybe I did not have as much right to live as anyone else, like antique bookseller Pascha and steamship forwarder Hennechen? Maybe I did not have shoulders like a giant and two deadly arms to work with, and I might not have even applied for a position as a woodcutter in Møllergaden to earn my daily bread? Was I lazy? Had I not sought work and listened to lectures and written newspaper articles and read and worked night and day like a mad man? And had I not lived as a miser, ate bread and milk when I had much, bread when I had suffered, and starved when I had nothing? Maybe I lived in a hotel, maybe I had a suite with rooms on the first floor? In a shed I lived, in a plumbing workshop, which god and every man had left over neck and head last winter because it was snowing. So I could not understand at all what it was all about.","My God, what weird things you get into! I said angrily to myself--running like a madman on wet streets when it is black as pitch! The pains of hunger were unbearable and never let me alone. I swallowed spit over and over to take the edge off, and I felt it did some good. I had had very little to eat generally for several weeks, even before this current trouble, and my strength now was falling off noticeably. Whenever I had been lucky and scraped up five kroner by some maneuver or other, the money never managed to last long enough to get me back on my feet before a new famine fell on me. My back and my shoulders bothered me most; the small ache in my chest I could stop for a moment by coughing hard or walking carefully bent over, but my back and shoulders I couldn't do anything with. How could it be that nothing ever turned up for me! Didn't I have the same right to life as anybody else, Pascha, the rare-book seller, for example, or Hennechen, the steamship clerk? And didn't I have shoulders like a giant and two strong arms for work, and hadn't I in fact tried to get a job chopping wood on Mřller Street to earn my bread? Was I lazy? Hadn't I applied for jobs, and listened to lectures, and written articles, and read and worked night and day like a madman? And hadn't I lived like a miser, eaten bread and milk when I was rich, bread when I wasn't, and gone hungry when I had nothing? Did I live in a hotel , did I have a suite of rooms on the second floor? I lived in a shack, a loft, in a tinsmith's shop deserted by both God and man since last winter because snow came in. So I had nothing at all to rebuke myself with on that score.","""Good Lord!"" thought I, wrathfully, ""what things you do take into your head: running about like a madman through the soaking wet streets on dark nights. "" My hunger was now tormenting me excruciatingly, and gave me no rest. Again and again I swallowed saliva to try and satisfy myself a little; I fancied it helped. I had been pinched, too, for food for ever so many weeks before this last period set in, and my strength had diminished considerably of late. When I had been lucky enough to raise five shillings by some manoeuvre or another they only lasted any time with difficulty; not long enough for me to be restored to health before a new hunger period set in and reduced me again. My back and shoulders caused me the worst trouble. I could stop the little gnawing I had in my chest by coughing hard, or bending well forward as I walked, but I had no remedy for back and shoulders. Whatever was the reason that things would not brighten up for me? Was I not just as much entitled to live as any one else? for example, as Bookseller Pascha or Steam Agent Hennechen? Had I not two shoulders like a giant, and two strong hands to work with? and had I not, in sooth, even applied for a place as wood-chopper in Möllergaden in order to earn my daily bread? Was I lazy? Had I not applied for situations, attended lectures, written articles, and worked day and night like a man possessed? Had I not lived like a miser, eaten bread and milk when I had plenty, bread alone when I had little, and starved when I had nothing? Did I live in an hotel? Had I a suite of rooms on the first floor? Why, I am living in a loft over a tinker's workshop, a loft already forsaken by God and man last winter, because the snow blew in. So I could not understand the whole thing; not a bit of it.","God, the sort of ideas you get! I thought angrily; imagine running around like a madman on sopping-wet streets in the dark of night! My hunger pains were excruciating and didn’t leave me for a moment. I swallowed my saliva again and again to take the edge off, and it seemed to help. I hadn’t had enough to eat for many, many weeks before this thing came up, and my strength had diminished considerably lately. When I had been lucky enough to get my hands on a five-krone bill by some maneuver or other, the money generally didn’t last me long enough for my health to be fully restored before a new hunger spell descended upon me. My back and shoulders had borne the brunt of it; I could stop that gnawing pain in my chest for a moment by coughing hard or by walking extremely bent over, but there was nothing I could do for my back and shoulders. Anyway, why did my prospects simply refuse to brighten up? Didn’t I have the same right to life as anyone else, such as Pascha the second-hand bookdealer, or Hennechen the steamship agent? Didn’t I have the shoulders of a giant and two stout arms for work, and hadn’t I even applied for a job as wood-cutter on Møller Street to earn my daily bread? Was I lazy? Hadn’t I applied for work and listened to lectures and written newspaper articles and read and plugged away like crazy day and night? And hadn’t I lived like a miser, eaten bread and milk when I had plenty, bread when I had little, and gone hungry when I had nothing? Did I live in a hotel , did I have a suite on the ground floor? I lived in a godforsaken loft, a tinsmith’s shop abandoned by everybody and his brother last winter because it snowed in there. So I couldn’t make head or tail of the whole situation."
"Oldingen svarede sagtmodigt og stille på hvert eneste af mine udfald og ledte efter ord, som om han var bange for at sige noget forkert og gøre mig vred.","The old man answered meekly and quietly to each and every one of my outbursts, looking for words as if he were afraid to say something wrong and make me angry.",The old creature answered meekly and quietly to every one of my outbursts and fumbled for words as if he were afraid to say something wrong and make me angry.,"The old fellow answered quite gently and meekly to each of my assertions, and sought for words as if he feared to offend and perhaps make me furious.","The old fellow replied meekly and quietly to every one of my sallies, searching for words as if he were afraid to say something wrong and make me angry."
"Efterhånden som jeg fjernede mig, blev jeg mere og mere glad over at jeg havde sejret over denne svære fristelse. Bevidstheden om, at jeg var ærlig, steg mig til hovedet, fyldte mig med en herlig følelse af at være en karakter, et hvidt fyrtårn midt i et grumset menneskehav, hvor der flød vrag omkring. Pantsætte en andens ejendom for et måltid mad, æde og drikke sig selv til doms, kalde sig selv en slyngel lige op i sit eget ansigt og slå øjnene ned for sig selv – aldrig! Aldrig! Det havde ikke for alvor været i mine tanker, det var næsten ikke engang faldet mig ind; løse, jagende påhit kunne man virkelig ikke stå til ansvar for, især ikke når man havde en frygtelig hovedpine og næsten slæbte sig ihjel på et sengetæppe, der tilhørte en anden mand.","As I moved away, I became more and more happy that I had overcome this difficult temptation. The realization that I was honest rose to my head, filled me with a glorious sense of being a character, a white lighthouse in the middle of a murky sea of people, where wrecks were floating around. Pledge someone else's property for a meal, eat and drink themselves to judgment, call themselves a rascal right up in their own face and roll their eyes at themselves - never! Never! It had not really been in my mind, it had hardly even occurred to me; loose, chasing quirks you really could not be held responsible for, especially not when you had a terrible headache and almost dragged yourself to death on a bedspread that belonged to another man.","After I was some distance away, I grew more and more glad that I had won this severe test. The awareness that I was honorable rose to my head, filled me with magnificent conviction that I had character. I was a white beacon tower in the middle of a dirty human ocean full of floating wreckage. To pawn someone else's property for a single meal, to eat and drink oneself into damnation, to look in your own face and call yourself rat and have to drop your eyes--never! Never! I had never really seriously considered it; it had just occurred to me loosely; a man wasn't really responsible for these accidental, floating notions, especially when he had a ghastly headache and had nearly killed himself dragging around a blanket that belonged to another person.","The farther away I got the more gladsome, ay, delighted I became, that I had conquered this strong temptation. The consciousness that I was yet pure and honourable rose to my head, filled me with a splendid sense of having principle, character, of being a shining white beacon in a muddy, human sea amidst floating wreck. Pawn another man's property for the sake of a meal, eat and drink one's self to perdition, brand one's soul with the first little scar, set the first black mark against one's honour, call one's self a blackguard to one's own face, and needs must cast one's eyes down before one's self? Never! never! It could never have been my serious intention--it had really never seriously taken hold of me; in fact, I could not be answerable for every loose, fleeting, desultory thought, particularly with such a headache as I had, and nearly killed carrying a blanket, too, that belonged to another fellow.","As I walked away I felt more and more pleased that I had conquered this great temptation. The consciousness of being honest went to my head, filling me with the glorious sensation that I was a man of character, a white beacon in the midst of a turbid human sea with floating wreckage everywhere. To hock someone else’s property for a meal, to eat and drink and your soul be damned,2 to call yourself a crook to your face and hide from your own eyes—never! Never! The idea had never been in earnest, it had scarcely even occurred to me; you couldn’t really be held responsible for your idle, fleeting thoughts by the way, especially when you had an awful headache and were nearly killing yourself schlepping a blanket that belonged to someone else."

I got out my paper and things to try and write something, and as I did so my book of shaving coupons fell out of my pocket. I opened it and counted the pages—there were six coupons left. Thank God! I burst out ; I could still get myself a shave for several weeks and look good! My spirits rose immediately because of this little possession that I still had left; I smoothed the coupons out carefully and put the book away in my pocket."

"Jeg gik videre gennem gaderne, drev rundt uden at bekymre mig om noget som helst, standsede ved et hjørne uden grund, bøjede af og gik ned ad en sidegade uden at skulle noget derhenne.

"Tanken på Gud begyndte igen at optage mig. Jeg syntes, det var højst uforsvarligt af ham at gribe ind, hver gang jeg søgte en stilling, og forstyrre det hele, når nu det bare var mad til dagen og vejen, jeg bad om. Jeg havde så tydeligt mærket, at når jeg sultede lidt længe ad gangen, var det, som om min hjerne løb stille ud af hovedet på mig og gjorde mig tom.

"Jeg åbnede vinduet og kiggede ud. Fra hvor jeg stod, havde jeg udsigt til en tøjsnor og en åben mark; langt ude lå ildstedet tilbage fra en nedbrændt smedje, hvor nogle arbejdere var i gang med at rydde op. Jeg lagde mig med albuerne i vinduet og stirrede ud i luften. Det lod til at ville blive en lys dag. Efteråret var kommet, den fine, kølige årstid, hvor alting skifter farve og dør. Støjen var allerede begyndt at lyde i gaderne og lokkede mig ud; dette tomme værelse, hvis gulv gyngede op og ned for hvert skridt jeg tog hen ad det, var som en revnet, uhyggelig ligkiste; der var ikke nogen ordentlig lås i døren og ikke nogen ovn i rummet; jeg plejede at ligge på mine strømper om natten for at få dem til at tørre til om morgenen. Det eneste jeg havde at fornøje mig med, var en lille rød gyngestol, hvor jeg sad om aftenen og halvsov og tænkte på alle mulige ting. Når det blæste hårdt og dørene nedenunder stod åbne, lød der alle mulige underlige hvin op gennem gulvet og ind gennem væggene, og Morgenbladet ovre ved døren fik revner, der var lige så lange som en hånd.","I opened the window and looked out. From where I stood, I had a view of a clothesline and an open field; far out, the fireplace lay back from a burnt-down smithy, where some workers were in the process of cleaning up. I lay down with my elbows in the window and stared into the air. It seemed like it was going to be a bright day. Autumn had come, the fine, cool season, when everything changes color and dies. The noise had already begun to sound in the streets and lured me out; this empty room, the floor of which rocked up and down with every step I took, was like a cracked, eerie coffin; there was no proper lock in the door and no oven in the room; I used to lie on my socks at night to get them to dry until the morning. The only thing I had to enjoy was a little red rocking chair where I sat in the evening and half asleep thinking about all sorts of things. When the wind blew hard and the doors below stood open, all sorts of strange squeals sounded up through the floor and in through the walls, and Morgenbladet over by the door got cracks as long as a hand.","I opened the window and looked out. I could see a clothesline and an open field. Behind them there was some debris from a burned-down blacksmith's shop which the workmen were just now cleaning away.

Noises were floating up from the streets, tempting me to go out. This empty room whose floor gave a little with every step was like a badly put-together coffin; the room had no real lock, and no stove; I usually slept on my socks so they would be a little drier by morning. The only nice thing in the room was a small red rocking chair in which I sat in the evenings, and dozed and thought about all sorts of things. When the wind was strong, and the street door of the house had been left open, all kinds of weird whines would come through the floor, and out of the walls, and the Morning Times by the door would get tears in it as long as a hand.","I opened the window and looked out. From where I was standing I had a view of a clothes, line and an open field. Farther away lay the ruins of a burnt-out smithy, which some labourers were busy clearing away.

It promised to be a clear day--autumn, that tender, cool time of the year, when all things change their colour, and die, had come to us. The ever- increasing noise in the streets lured me out. The bare room, the floor of which rocked up and down with every step I took across it, seemed like a gasping, sinister coffin. There was no proper fastening to the door, either, and no stove. I used to lie on my socks at night to dry them a little by the morning. The only thing I had to divert myself with was a little red rocking-chair, in which I used to sit in the evenings and doze and muse on all manner of things. When it blew hard, and the door below stood open, all kinds of eerie sounds moaned up through the floor and from out the walls, and the Morgenbladet near the door was rent in strips a span long.","I opened the window and looked out.

"Jeg blev stående fuldstændig stille indenfor. Lige foran mig, bare to skridt væk, stod værten selv, uden hat og uden frakke, og kiggede ind gennem nøglehullet til familiens egen stue.

I det hele taget var der simpelthen ingen mening i at leve på denne måde; jeg kunne ved Kristi hellige smerte heller ikke forstå, hvordan jeg havde gjort mig fortjent til denne enestående forfølgelse! Og det faldt mig pludselig ind, at jeg lige så godt kunne gøre en slyngel af mig selv og gå hen til „Onkels“ kælder med sengetæppet. Jeg kunne pantsætte det for en krone og få tre fyldestgørende måltider, holde mig oprejst, indtil jeg kom i tanke om noget andet; Hans Pauli blev jeg nødt til at stikke en skrøne.

"Men da jeg kom hjem på mit værelse, ind i dette triste hul, gennemblødt af den våde sne, med rystende knæ efter dagens vandringer, blev jeg straks lidt mindre kæphøj og faldt igen sammen. Jeg fortrød mit overfald på den ulykkelige butiksmand, græd, greb fat i struben på mig selv for at straffe mig for mit usle nummer og holdt et syndigt leben med mig selv. Han havde selvfølgelig været dødsens angst for at miste sin stilling, havde ikke turdet lave ballade over disse fem kroner, som butikken havde mistet. Og jeg havde benyttet mig af hans angst, havde pint ham med min højrøstede snak, spiddet ham med hvert eneste ord, jeg råbte. Og høkerchefen selv havde måske siddet inde i værelset ved siden af og følt sig på nippet til at gå ud til os for at se, hvad der foregik.

He had, of course, been deathly anxious to lose his position, had not dared to make trouble over these five crowns which the shop had lost. And I had taken advantage of his anxiety, had pinted him with my loud talk, impaled him with every single word I shouted. And the hawker boss himself might have been sitting inside the room next door and feeling on the verge of going out to us to see what was going on. No, there were no longer any limits to what I could come up with of degrading things!","But when I was home in my room, in my pitiful hole, soaked through from the wet snow, and my knees shivering from the day's exertions, my arrogant mood vanished, and I collapsed again into depression.

The clerk had naturally been in terror of losing his job, had not dared to make a fuss over the five kroner the store had lost.

He had naturally been in the most deadly terror for the sake of his situation; he had not dared to make any fuss about the five shillings that were lost to the business, and I had taken advantage of his fear, had tortured him with my violent address, stabbed him with every loud word that I had roared out.

"Hvor det dog smagte vidunderligt at være et ærligt menneske igen! Mine tomme lommer tyngede mig ikke længere, det var en nydelse at være blanket af igen. Når jeg nu rigtig tænkte det igennem, havde disse penge i grunden kostet mig en masse skjulte bekymringer, jeg havde virkelig gang på gang tænkt på dem med en gysen; jeg var ikke en afstumpet sjæl, min ærlige natur havde gjort oprør mod den lave handling. Gudskelov, jeg havde fået min selvrespekt tilbage. Kom bare og gør mig den kunst efter! sagde jeg og kiggede ud over det myldrende torv, gør mig bare kunsten efter!

I was not a hardened and damned soul , my honorable nature had risen against that sordid deed, yes it had. Thanks to God, I had raised myself in my own estimation. "" Go thou and do as I have done!"" I said, looking out over the crowded marketplace, simply do as I have done. I had given a paradise of joy to a poor old woman--she didn't know right now if she was coming or going.

"Men jeg var bange for, at dette kedede hende, og følelsen af min store forarmelse greb mig igen og knugede mig sammen.

"Der faldt mig lige i øjeblikket ikke en eneste trist tanke ind, jeg glemte mine problemer og følte mig beroliget af synet af havnen, der lå fredelig og smuk hen i halvmørket. Af gammel vane ville jeg glæde mig selv ved at læse det stykke igennem, som jeg netop havde skrevet, og som forekom min lidende hjerne at være det bedste, jeg havde lavet. Jeg tog mit manuskript op af lommen, holdt det tæt ind til øjnene for at kunne se noget og løb den ene side igennem efter den anden. Til sidst blev jeg træt og stak papirerne i lommen.

I was so greedy for them that I almost gobbled down the last cake of them all, which I had set aside almost from the start for the boy down in Vognmands Street, the small boy whose head the man had spit on. I thought of him all the time, couldn't make myself forget his face when he leaped up, crying and swearing. He had turned and looked toward my window, too, when the man spit on him, as if to find out whether I was laughing at him too. God knows, maybe I wouldn't even find him now! I hurried as fast as I could down to Vognmands Street, passing the spot where I had torn up my play; some bits of paper were still lying there. I managed to avoid the policeman who had been so surprised at my behavior, and at last I arrived at the stoop where the boy had been sitting.","The cakes disappeared one by one; they seemed to go no way; no matter how I ate I was still greedily hungry. Lord, to think they were of no help! I was so ravenous that I was even about to devour the last little cake that I had decided to spare, right from the beginning, to put it aside, in fact, for the little chap down in Vognmandsgade--the little lad who played with the paper streamers. I thought of him continually--couldn't forget his face as he jumped and swore. He had turned round towards the window when the man spat down on him, and he had just looked up to see if I was laughing at him. God knows if I should meet him now, even if I went down that way. I exerted myself greatly to try and reach Vognmandsgade, passed quickly by the spot where I had torn my drama into tatters, and where some scraps of papers still lay about; avoided the policeman whom I had amazed by my behaviour, and reached the steps upon which the laddie had been sitting.","The cakes disappeared one after another, but however much I put away it didn’t help, my hunger was just as bottomless. Good God, why didn’t it help? I was so greedy that I nearly laid hands on the last cake, which I had decided at the very outset to save for that little fellow down in Vognmand Street, the boy that the man with the red beard had spit in the head. I kept thinking of him all the time— I couldn’t make myself forget his expression as he leaped up, crying and cursing. He had turned around to my window when the man spit at him, and he had plainly checked whether I, too, would laugh at him. God only knew if I would find him when I got down there! I went all out to get to Vognmand Street in a hurry, passed the spot where I had torn up my play and where some bits of paper were still floating around, evaded the police officer whom I had so astonished by my behavior recently, and stood at last at the steps where the boy had been sitting."
"Jeg skal læse den, sagde han og tog imod den. Anstrengelser koster det Dem vist, lige meget hvad De skriver; men De er alt for intens. Hvis De dog bare kunne være lidt mere behersket! Der er altid for meget feber. Men jeg skal nok læse den. Og han vendte sig igen om mod bordet.","I must read it, he said and accepted it.

"Stille. Ikke et eneste menneske rundt om mig, ikke et eneste lys, ingen støj. Jeg er næsten fra sans og samling, jeg hiver tungt og højlydt efter vejret og græder tænderskærende, hver gang jeg må ofre disse kødtrevler, som måske ville kunne mætte mig lidt. Da det slet ikke nytter noget, ligegyldigt hvor meget jeg forsøger, slynger jeg benet mod porten, fuld af det mest afmægtige had, henrykt af raseri, råber og truer voldsomt ad himlen, skriger hæst og indtrængende Guds navn og krummer fingrene som kløer ...

Jeg siger dig, jeg ved, at jeg skal dø, og jeg håner dig alligevel, du himmelske Apis, ansigt til ansigt med døden. Du har anvendt magt mod mig, og du ved ikke, at jeg aldrig bøjer mig for modgang. Burde du ikke vide det? Skabte du mit hjerte i søvne? Jeg siger dig, med hele mit liv og med hver eneste dråbe af mit blod fryder det mig at håne dig og spytte på din nåde. Jeg vil fra dette øjeblik give afkald på alle dine gerninger og alt dit væsen, jeg vil forbande min tanke, hvis den tænker på dig igen, og rive mine læber af, hvis de nævner dit navn igen. Jeg siger dig, hvis du er til, det sidste ord i livet og i døden, jeg siger dig farvel. Og så tier jeg stille og vender dig ryggen og går mig vej ...","Quiet. Not a single human being around me, not a single light, no noise.

I tell you, I know I'm going to die, and I mock you anyway, you heavenly Apis, face to face with death. You have used force against me, and you do not know that I never bow to adversity. Shouldn't you know? Did you create my heart in your sleep? I tell you, with all my life and with every drop of my blood, it delights me to mock you and spit on your grace. I will from this moment on renounce all your deeds and all your being, I will curse my thought if it thinks of you again, and tear my lips off if they mention your name again. I tell you, if you exist, the last word in life and in death, I say goodbye to you. And then I keep quiet and turn my back on you and walk away ...","Silence. Not a person around, no lights, not a sound. I was in a wild state, I breathed heavily and audibly, and sobbed, gnashing my teeth, every time I had to abandon these bits of meat which might have satisfied my hunger. When nothing helped, no matter how hard I tried, I threw the bone against the gate, maddened by the most impotent hatred. Carried away by rage, I shouted and roared threats up to the sky, shrieked God's name hoarsely and savagely, and curled my fingers like claws. . . . I'll tell you this, you sacred Baal in the sky, you do not exist, and if you do, I'll curse you so that your heaven will start shuddering with hellfire!

I am telling you this, all my energy and every drop of blood in me rejoices that I mock you and spit on your grace. From this hour on, I will renounce all your works and all your ways, I will exile my thoughts if they think of you again, and I will rip my lips out if they say your name once more.

I tell you, I am filled with a blissful contempt for your divine paltriness; and I choose the abyss of destruction for a perpetual resort, where the devils Judas and Pharaoh are cast down! I tell you your Heaven is full of the kingdom of the earth's most crass- headed idiots and poverty-stricken in spirit! I tell you, you have filled your Heaven with the grossest and most cherished harlots from here below, who have bent their knees piteously before you at their hour of death! I tell you, you have used force against me, and you know not, you omniscient nullity, that I never bend in opposition! I tell you, all my life, every cell in my body, every power of my soul, gasps to mock you--you Gracious Monster on High. I tell you, I would, if I could, breathe it into every human soul, every flower, every leaf, every dewdrop in the garden! I tell you, I would scoff you on the day of doom, and curse the teeth out of my mouth for the sake of your Deity's boundless miserableness!

"Jeg falder pludselig hen i spekulationer om alt dette og er ikke i stand til at finde en eneste replik til mit drama. Jeg forsøger gang på gang forgæves; det begynder at summe underligt i hovedet på mig, og jeg giver til sidst op. Jeg stikker papirerne i lommen og kigger op. Pigen sidder lige foran mig, og jeg kigger på hende, kigger på denne smalle ryg og et par lave skuldre, som ikke engang var rigtig voksne endnu. Hvad skulle det gøre godt for, at hun kastede sig over mig? Og hvis jeg nu var kommet ud af Slottet, ja, hvad så? Kunne det virkelig genere hende? Hun havde de sidste dage grinet frækt ad mig, når jeg var uheldig og snublede på trapperne eller hang fast i et søm, så jeg fik en flænge i min frakke. Det var heller ikke længere siden end i går, at hun havde samlet mine kladder op, som jeg havde smidt fra mig i forstuen, stjålet disse kasserede brudstykker til mit drama, og læst højt fra dem inde i stuen, lavet sjov med dem i alles påhør, bare for at more sig over mig. Jeg havde aldrig forulempet hende og kunne ikke huske nogensinde at have bedt hende om en tjeneste. Tværtimod, jeg gjorde selv min seng i stand om aftenen inde på stuegulvet, for at hun ikke skulle have besvær med det. Hun gjorde også grin med mig, fordi mit hår faldt af. Der lå hår og flød rundt i vaskevandet om morgenen, og det lavede hun sjov med. Nu var mine sko blevet dårlige, især den ene, der var blevet kørt over af brødvognen, og hun gjorde også grin med dem. Gud velsigne Dem og Deres sko! sagde hun; se på dem, de er lige så store som et hundehus! Og hun havde ret i, at mine sko var udtrådte; men jeg kunne altså ikke skaffe mig nogen andre lige i øjeblikket.","I suddenly fall into speculation about all this and am unable to find a single line in my drama. I try time and time again in vain; it starts buzzing strangely in my head and I eventually give up. I stick the papers in my pocket and look up. The girl is sitting right in front of me and I look at her, looking at this narrow back and a pair of low shoulders that were not even really adults yet. What good would it do her to throw herself at me? And if I had now come out of the Castle, well, what then? Could it really bother her? She had the last few days laughed naughtily at me when I was unlucky and stumbled on the stairs or got stuck in a nail so I got a gash in my coat. It was also no longer since yesterday that she had picked up my drafts that I had thrown from me in the hall, stolen these discarded fragments for my drama, and read aloud from them inside the living room, made fun of them in everyone listen, just to have fun with me. I had never insulted her and could not remember ever having asked her for a favor. On the contrary, I even made my bed in the evening on the living room floor so that she would not have trouble with it. She also made fun of me because my hair fell out. There was hair floating around in the wash water in the morning, and she made fun of it. Now my shoes had gotten bad, especially the one that had been run over by the bread cart, and she was making fun of them, too. God bless you and your shoes! she said; look at them, they are as big as a dog house! And she was right that my shoes were worn out; but I could not find anyone else at the moment.","I began to brood about all this suddenly, and I wasn't able to find a single speech for my play. I tried again and again; it was no use. My head started to buzz in a strange way, and I finally gave up. I put my manuscript into my pocket and looked around. The hired girl was sitting opposite me, and I gazed at her small back and her sloping shoulders, still half grown. Why should she attack me? And if I had been at the castle, what then? Could that have harmed her? She had been extremely impertinent lately, laughing at me whenever I happened to stumble on the stair or happened to get caught on a nail so that my coat ripped. And only yesterday she had picked up the first drafts of various scenes which I had thrown away in the corridor, actually had stolen these rejected fragments of my play, and had read them aloud in the family room, making fun of them in everyone's hearing, merely to amuse herself at my expense. I had never annoyed her and had never to my knowledge even asked her for a favor. On the contrary, I made my bed on the floor myself every night so as not to cause her any extra work. She made fun of me also because my hair was falling out. Strands of hair lay floating around in the washbasin every morning, and she made a great deal out of that. My shoes were by now in rather bad shape, especially the one driven over by the bread cart, and she found a few jokes there also. ""God have mercy on you and your shoes! "" she would say. Or: ""Look at that shoe, it's the size of a doghouse!"" She was right that my shoes were worn out, but I couldn't buy any others for the moment.","I fall suddenly into thought over all this, and am not able to find a solitary speech for my drama. Time upon time I seek in vain; a strange buzzing begins inside my head, and I give it up. I thrust the papers into my pocket, and look up. The girl is sitting straight opposite me. I look at her--look at her narrow back and drooping shoulders, that are not yet fully developed. What business was it of hers to fly at me? Even supposing I did come out of the palace, what then? Did it harm her in any way? She had laughed insolently in the past few days at me, when I was a bit awkward and stumbled on the stairs, or caught fast on a nail and tore my coat. It was not later than yesterday that she gathered up my rough copy, that I had thrown aside in the ante-room--stolen these rejected fragments of my drama, and read them aloud in the room here; made fun of them in every one's hearing, just to amuse herself at my expense. I had never molested her in any way, and could not recall that I had ever asked her to do me a service. On the contrary, I made up my bed on the floor in the ante-room myself, in order not to give her any trouble with it. She made fun of me, too, because my hair fell out. Hair lay and floated about in the basin I washed in the mornings, and she made merry over it. Then my shoes, too, had grown rather shabby of late, particularly the one that had been run over by the bread-van, and she found subject for jesting in them. "" God bless you and your shoes!"" said she, looking at them; ""they are as wide as a dog's house. "" And she was right; they were trodden out. But then I couldn't procure myself any others just at present.","Suddenly absorbed by all this, I cannot find a single line of dialogue for my play. I try again and again but in vain; my head begins to buzz eerily and in the end I give up. I stick the papers in my pocket and look up. The maid is sitting right in front of me and I look at her, look at that narrow back and those drooping shoulders, which weren’t even quite grown-up yet. What business did she have to pitch into me? Even supposing I had come out of the Palace, so what? Could it have harmed her? She had laughed saucily at me these last few days whenever I had the bad luck to stumble on the stairs or get caught on a nail, tearing my coat. And only yesterday she had gathered up my drafts, which I had thrown aside in the hall—she had stolen those scrapped fragments of my play and read them aloud in the family room, making fun of them in front of everybody just to amuse herself at my expense. I had never molested her and couldn’t remember ever having asked her for a favor. On the contrary, I made up my own bed on the floor in the evening, so as not to give her any trouble with it. She made fun of me also because my hair was falling out. It was floating around in the washbasin in the morning, and she made merry over it. My shoes were in quite bad shape by now, especially the one that had been run over by the baker’s van, and she also made jokes about them. “God bless you and your shoes!” she would say; “look at them, they’re as big as dog houses!” She was right about my shoes being worn-down, but I just couldn’t get myself another pair at the moment."
"Jeg gav mig til at vandre rundt mellem menneskene på Stortorvet og foretrak at holde mig i nærheden af de koner, der havde potteplanter til salg. De tunge, røde roser, som ulmede blodigt og råt i den fugtige morgen gjorde mig begærlig, fristede mig syndigt til at snuppe en, og jeg forhørte mig om dens pris bare for at komme så tæt på den som muligt. Hvis jeg fik penge tilovers, ville jeg købe den, det måtte gå, som det ville; jeg kunne jo nok spare lidt hist og her i mit daglige liv for at komme i balance igen.","I started walking around among the people on Stortorvet and preferred to stay close to the wives who had potted plants for sale.

If I got money left over, I would buy it, it had to go as it wanted; I could probably save a little here and there in my daily life to get in balance again.","I started wandering around among the people in the main marketplace, and particularly hovered near the women who were selling potted plants.

If I got more money than I needed, I would buy one, no matter what happened afterwards; I could always skimp a little here and there in my daily budget to make up for it.","I began to wander about amongst the people in the market place, kept from choice near the woman who had potted plants for sale. The heavy crimson roses--the leaves of which glowed blood-like and moist in the damp morning--made me envious, and tempted me sinfully to snatch one, and I inquired the price of them merely as an excuse to approach as near to them as possible. If I had any money over I would buy one, no matter how things went; indeed, I might well save a little now and then out of my way of living to balance things again.","I began wandering about among the people at Stortorvet Square, preferring to stay close to the women selling potted plants.

"Pludselig så jeg to af børnene nede i gaden fare op og skændes, to smådrenge; jeg kendte den ene af dem, han var min værtindes. Jeg åbner vinduet for at høre, hvad de siger til hinanden, og straks stimler der en flok børn sammen neden under mit vindue og kigger længselsfuldt op. Hvad forventede de? At der skulle blive kastet noget ud? Tørrede blomster, kødben, cigarstumper, en eller anden ting de kunne gnave i sig eller more sig med? De kiggede med ansigter der var blå af kulde, med uendeligt lange blikke, op mod mit vindue. I mellemtiden bliver de to små fjender ved med at skælde hinanden ud.

That something should be thrown out? Dried flowers, meat bones, cigar stubs, something they could gnaw on or have fun with? They looked with faces that were blue from cold, with infinitely long glances, up towards my window. Meanwhile, the two little enemies keep scolding each other. Words like big clammy monsters swarm out of these children's mouths, horrible nicknames, whore language, sailor seats that they might have learned down in the harbor. And they are both so preoccupied with it that they do not even notice my hostess running out to them to hear what is happening.","Suddenly I saw two of the children in the street squaring off to fight, two small boys: I recognized one of them as the landlady's son.

"Da jeg kom ned i Slotsbakken, indhentede jeg to damer, som jeg gik forbi. Idet jeg passerede dem, strejfede jeg den enes ærme, jeg kiggede op, hun havde et fyldigt, lidt blegt ansigt. Med ét rødmer hun og bliver forunderligt smuk, jeg ved ikke hvorfor, måske over et ord hun hører fra en forbipasserende, måske bare over en stille tanke hos sig selv. Eller kunne det være, fordi jeg havde berørt hendes arm? Det høje bryst bølger heftigt nogle gange, og hun klemmer hånden hårdt om parasolhåndtaget.

"Jeg stod tilbage på fortovet og kiggede efter ham, jeg græd ganske stille. Jeg har aldrig set noget lignende! sagde jeg til mig selv; han gav mig ti kroner!

"Hør her, ved du nu hvad, sagde jeg så, nu har du længe nok gået og beskæftiget dig med din forstand og gjort dig bekymringer i så henseende; nu må det være nok med de narrestreger! Er det et tegn på galskab at mærke og opfatte alle ting så præcist, som du gør det? Du får mig næsten til at le ad dig; jeg kan forsikre dig om, at det ikke er uden sine komiske sider, så vidt jeg kan skønne. Kort og godt, det kan ske for alle mennesker, at de indimellem går i baglås, og det netop i de mest simple spørgsmål. Det betyder ikke noget, det er bare en ren tilfældighed. Som sagt, jeg er lige på et hængende hår ved at få mig et godt grin over dig. Med hensyn til den købmandsregning, disse elendige fem sekstendedele fattigmandsost, om jeg så må sige, – hæ-hæ, en ost med nelliker og peber i – med hensyn til denne latterlige ost, så kunne det være sket for den bedste, at han blev tom i hovedet af den; selve lugten af den ost kunne gøre det af med en mand ... Og jeg gjorde voldsomt grin med al kommenost ... Nej, giv mig noget spiseligt! sagde jeg, giv mig fem sekstendedele mejerismør, hvis du vil! Det er en helt anden sag.","Listen, you now know what, I said then, now you have long enough gone and dealt with your mind and made yourself worry in that regard; now those pranks must be enough! Is it a sign of madness to feel and perceive all things as precisely as you do? You almost make me laugh at you; I can assure you that it is not without its comic sides, as far as I can tell. In short, it can happen to all people that they sometimes go in the backseat, and that precisely in the simplest questions. It does not matter, it's just a coincidence. Like I said, I'm right on a dangling hair about getting me a good laugh over you. As for the grocery bill, these miserable five-sixths poor man's cheese, if I may say so - hey-hey, a cheese with cloves and pepper in it - as for this ridiculous cheese, it could have happened for the best that he became empty in the head of it; the very smell of that cheese could do away with a man ... And I made a violent laugh with all the cumin ... No, give me something edible! I said, give me five-sixteenths of butter if you will! That is a completely different matter.","Listen now, I'll tell you something, I said all of a sudden, you have been going around long enough worrying about your brains, and troubling yourself about that-- now let's have an end to that nonsense! Is it a mark of insanity to notice and observe details as exactly as you do? You almost make me laugh, that's the truth. There is something funny in this whole thing, there really is. Everyone fails once in a while, and they always fail precisely in the most simple problems: that doesn't mean anything, it's just chance. As I've said before, I'm just a hairbreadth away from bursting out laughing at you. About that grocery bill with its piddling five-sixteenths of rat cheese, because that's all it was-- how ridiculous, a cheese with caraway seeds in it--as far as this absurd cheese is concerned, the brightest man in the world could easily stumble over that-- even the smell of cheese like that is enough to finish a man off. . . . I went on mocking the cheese unmercifully. . . . ""No, give me something I can eat!"" I said. ""Give me, if you please, five-sixteenths of a pound of good creamery butter! That's more like it!""","Listen ; do you know what, said I all at once to myself, that you have been worrying yourself long enough about your brain, giving yourself no end of worry in this matter? Now, there must be an end to this tomfoolery. Is it a sign of insanity to notice and apprehend everything as accurately as you do? You make me almost laugh at you, I reply. To my mind it is not without its humorous side, if I am any judge of such a case. Why, it happens to every man that he once in a way sticks fast, and that, too, just with the simplest question. It is of no significance, it is often a pure accident. As I have remarked before, I am on the point of having a good laugh at your expense. As far as that huckster account is concerned, that paltry five-sixteenths of beggar-man's cheese, I can happily dub it so. Ha, ha!-- a cheese with cloves and pepper in it; upon my word, a cheese in which, to put the matter plainly, one could breed maggots. As far as that ridiculous cheese is concerned, it might happen to the cleverest fellow in the world to be puzzled over it! Why, the smell of the cheese was enough to finish a man; ... and I made the greatest fun of this and all other Dutch cheeses.... No; set me to reckon up something really eatable, said I--set me, if you like, at five-sixteenths of good dairy butter. That is another matter.","Now, look here, I said all of a sudden, you have been bothering yourself about your sanity long enough, making yourself anxious on that score; now let’s put a stop to these tomfooleries! Is it a sign of insanity to perceive and understand all things as accurately as you do? On my word, you almost make me laugh at yourself; it does have its humorous side, you know. In short, everyone gets stuck once in a while, and precisely in the simplest things. It doesn’t mean anything, it’s pure chance. As I’ve said, I’m only a hairs-breadth away from having a good laugh at you. As far as that grocery bill is concerned, those piddling ten-sixteenths of a poor man’s cheese, I might call it—hee-hee, a cheese with cloves and pepper in it—as far as this ridiculous cheese is concerned, the very best among us might have been stupefied by that. The very smell of that cheese could finish a man. . . . And I held all clove cheese up to the most vicious ridicule. . . . No, give me something edible! I said. Give me, if you please, ten-sixteenths of good creamery butter! That’s something else!"

"Kunne jeg mon ikke på en eller anden måde opdrive disse ti kroner igen?

"Jeg vågnede svedende næste dag, fugtig over hele kroppen; feberen havde udsat mig for et ret så voldsomt pres.

"Og jeg talte rigtig længe om disse brandsår, som min sjæl havde. Men jo længere jeg talte, desto mere urolig blev hun; til sidst sagde hun, herregud! et par gange i fortvivlelse og vred sine hænder.

"Nå, ikke? svarede konen, jaså, det er der ikke? Men jeg kunne godt se, at hun ikke troede på mig. Og pludselig virkede det, som om hun lige med ét antog et lille stænk af foragt, når hun talte til mig, et lidt ligegyldigt tonefald, som jeg ikke havde hørt hos hende tidligere. Hun sagde, at jeg måske ikke var vant til at regne med sekstendedele; hun sagde også, at hun blev nødt til at henvende sig til nogen, der havde forstand på det for at få regningen ordentligt gennemgået. Alt dette sagde hun ikke på nogen sårende måde for at skamme mig ud, men tankefuldt og alvorligt.

She didn't say all of this in a wounding tone, to make me feel ashamed, but in a thoughtful and serious tone. When she got to the door and was about to leave, she said, without turning around, ""Excuse me for having interrupted your work!""","""Isn't there?"" replied the woman, ""isn't there really?

"Stadig var der ikke en eneste lyd, der forstyrrede mig; det milde mørke havde skjult hele verden for mine øjne og begravet mig der i fuldkommen ro – kun stilhedens øde ekko tier monotont i ørerne på mig.

Solen skinner herinde, i gallerier og korridorer vandrer kor af musik hen, strømme af duft slår mig i møde.

"Var det i grunden ikke lige meget om det uundgåelige skete en dag før eller en dag senere?

"Så kom jeg ned til Jernbanekajen. Der var ingen trafik, ingen støj, bare et menneske sås hist og her, en havnearbejder eller en sømand, der drev omkring med hænderne i lommen. Jeg lagde mærke til en halt mand, der skelede stift hen imod mig, idet vi gik forbi hinanden. Jeg standsede ham instinktivt, løftede på hatten og spurgte, om han kendte noget til, om Nonnen var afrejst. Og bagefter kunne jeg ikke lade være med at knipse en eneste gang lige for øjnene af manden og sige: Død og djævel, Nonnen ja! Nonnen som jeg fuldstændig havde glemt! Tanken om den havde vel alligevel slumret ubevidst i mit indre, jeg havde båret på den uden selv at vide af det.","Then I came down to Jernbanekajen. There was no traffic, no noise, just a human being seen here and there, a dock worker or a sailor drifting around with his hands in his pockets. I noticed a lame man squinting stiffly at me as we walked past each other. I stopped him instinctively, lifted my hat, and asked if he knew anything about whether the Nun had left. And afterwards I could not help but blink once before the eyes of the man and say: Death and devil, Nun yes! The nun I had completely forgotten! The thought of it had probably still slipped unconsciously inside me, I had carried it without even knowing it.","I arrived finally at the railway pier. There was no traffic, no noise; once in a while a person could be seen, a longshoreman or a sailor, strolling around with his hands in his pockets. I noticed a lame man who looked sharply at me as we passed. Without pausing a second, I stopped him, raised my hand to my hat, and asked whether The Nun had sailed yet. When I had finished saying that, I couldn't stop myself from snapping my fingers once right in his face, and saying, ""Yes, by God, The Nun!"" I had entirely forgotten The Nun. The thought of it must have been sleeping somewhere far inside, I was carrying it around without being aware of it myself.","In this manner, I reached the railway wharf. There was no traffic, no noise--only here and there a person to be seen, a labourer or sailor slinking round with their hands in their pockets. I took notice of a lame man, who looked sharply at me as we passed one another. I stopped him instinctively, touched my hat, and inquired if he knew if the Nun had sailed. Someway, I couldn't help snapping my fingers right under the man's nose, and saying, ""Ay, by Jove, the Nun; yes, the Nun!"" which I had totally forgotten. All the same, the thought of her had been smouldering in me. I had carried it about unconsciously.","I reached the Jærnbane Pier. There was no traffic, no noise, only a lone soul to be seen here and there, a stevedore or a sailor loafing about with his hands in his pockets.

Afterward I couldn’t help snapping my fingers right to his face and saying, “Yes, damn it, The Nun!” The Nun, which I had completely forgotten!

I have to sit at the door all the time if you want it ...,"""Shall we go up to your place then?"" I said.

"En besynderlig fortumlethed fór i det samme gennem hovedet på mig; jeg gik videre og ville ikke tage mig af det, men fik det værre og værre og måtte til sidst sætte mig på en trappe. Hele mit sind gennemgik en forandring, som om noget gled til side i mit indre, eller et forhæng, et væv i min hjerne, gik itu. Jeg hev efter vejret et par gange og blev forundret siddende. Jeg var fuldt bevidst, jeg kunne tydeligt mærke, hvordan det gjorde lidt ondt i mit øre fra i går, og da en bekendt kom forbi, kunne jeg straks genkende ham, rejste mig op og hilste.","A strange dizziness went at once through my head; I went on and would not take care of it, but got worse and worse and eventually had to sit on a staircase. My whole mind went through a change, as if something slipped aside in my interior, or a curtain, a tissue in my brain, broke. I gasped a few times and was amazed sitting. I was fully conscious, I could clearly feel how it hurt a little in my ear from yesterday, and when an acquaintance came by, I could immediately recognize him, got up and greeted.","All at once a curious confusion slipped into my head; I walked on, not wanting to pay any attention to it, but it grew worse and worse; finally I had to sit down on a doorstep. My whole consciousness underwent some change, a tissue in my brain parted. I took a couple of breaths and remained sitting there astonished. I was conscious, I could feel clearly a little pain in my ear from yesterday, and when an acquaintance came by, I knew him immediately and stood up to give him a small nod and bow.","After that I went towards the railway station. A singular sense of confusion suddenly darted through my head. I stumbled on, determined not to heed it; but I grew worse and worse, and was forced at last to sit down on a step. My whole being underwent a change, as if something had slid aside in my inner self, or as if a curtain or tissue of my brain was rent in two. I was not unconscious; I felt that my ear was gathering a little, and, as an acquaintance passed by, I recognized him at once and got up and bowed.","Suddenly a curious confusion flashed through my head; I walked on, refusing to pay any attention to it, but it got worse and worse and finally I had to sit down on a doorstep.

"Tikronen! Jeg fløjtede en gang med munden. Brevet som buddet bragte, hvor kom det fra? Først nu i dette øjeblik tænkte jeg klart over dette og fik straks en anelse om, hvordan det hang sammen. Jeg blev syg af smerte og skam, jeg hviskede Ylajali nogle gange med hæs stemme og rystede på hovedet. Var det ikke mig, der endda så sent som i går havde besluttet mig for at gå stolt forbi hende, når jeg mødte hende, og udvise den allerstørste ligegyldighed? Og i stedet havde jeg vakt hendes medlidenhed og lokket en barmhjertighedsgave ud af hende. Nej, nej, nej, der blev aldrig nogen ende på min nedværdigelse! Ikke engang over for hende havde jeg kunnet indtage en anstændig position; jeg sank ned, sank ned på alle leder og kanter, hvor end jeg vendte mig om, sank i knæ, sank ned til livet, dykkede ned i vanære og kom aldrig op igen, aldrig! Det var topmålet! At tage imod ti kroner uden at kunne slynge dem tilbage i hovedet på den hemmelige giver, gramse skillinger sammen med begge hænder, hvor end de blev rakt frem imod mig, og beholde dem, bruge dem til logipenge til trods for deres egen inderste modbydelighed ...","Tikronen! I whistled once with my mouth. The letter that the messenger brought, where did it come from? Only now in this moment did I think clearly about this and immediately get an idea of how it all came together. I got sick of pain and shame, I whispered Ylajali sometimes in a hoarse voice and shook my head. Was it not me who, even as late as yesterday, had decided to walk proudly past her when I met her, and show the utmost indifference? And instead, I had aroused her pity and lured a gift of mercy out of her. No, no, no, there was never any end to my degradation! Not even towards her had I been able to occupy a decent position; I sank down, sank down on all leads and edges wherever I turned, sank to my knees, sank down to life, dived into disgrace and never came up again, never! That was the top goal! Receiving ten crowns without being able to sling them back into the head of the secret giver, grammatically shilling with both hands wherever they were held out to me, and keeping them, using them for lodging money despite their own innermost disgust. ..",". . . A ten-kroner note! I gave a whistle. The letter the messenger brought--who had sent it? For the first time I thought about it and understood instantly how it all hung together. I became sick with shame and pain and whispered Ylayali several times in a hoarse voice, shaking my head. Didn't I only yesterday decide to walk proudly past her when I met her and be utterly cold? What I had actually done was to awaken her pity and lure a little alms money from her. No, no, no, there was no end to my degradations! Not once in my relations with her had I ever been able to keep a dignified position-- no, I sank every time, sank further, sank to my knees, to my waist, sank over my head in disgrace, and I would never come up again, never! This humiliation was the worst of all! Accepting ten kroner in beggar's alms without being able to throw them back to the giver, scrambling with both hands for coins no matter where they came from, and keeping them, using them for rent money even though one felt disgust inside.","Half-a-sovereign! I gave a whistle. The letter the messenger brought me, where did it come from? It was only this instant I thought clearly over this, and I divined at once how the whole thing hung together. I grew sick with pain and shame. I whispered ""Ylajali"" a few times, with hoarse voice, and flung back my head. Was it not I who, no later than yesterday, had decided to pass her proudly by if I met her, to treat her with the greatest indifference? Instead of that, I had only aroused her compassion, and coaxed an alms from her. No, no, no; there would never be an end to my degradation! Not even in her presence could I maintain a decent position. I sank, simply sank, on all sides--every way I turned; sank to my knees, sank to my waist, dived under in ignominy, never to rise again--never! This was the climax! To accept half-a-sovereign in alms without being able to fling it back to the secret donor; scramble for half-pence whenever the chance offered, and keep them, use them for lodging money, in spite of one's intense inner aversion....",". . . The ten-krone bill! I gave a whistle. The letter the messenger brought, where did it come from? Only now, at this moment, did I think clearly about this, and I had a hunch right away what the story was. Sick with pain and shame, I whispered “Ylajali” several times in a hoarse voice and shook my head. Was it not me who had decided only yesterday to walk proudly past her when we met and to display the utmost indifference toward her? And instead of that I had merely aroused her compassion and coaxed her out of a pennyworth of charity. No, no, no, there was no end to my degradation! Not even vis-à-vis her had I been able to maintain a respectable posture; I was sinking, sinking everywhere I turned, sinking to my knees, to my middle, going down in infamy never to come up again, never! That beat everything! To accept ten kroner of alms money without being able to throw it back at the secret donor, to scramble for pennies with both hands wherever they were offered, hang on to them, use them to pay the rent despite my own innermost repugnance!"

Jeg havde til sidst søgt en stilling som inkassator, men var kommet for sent; desuden kunne jeg ikke stille en garanti på halvtreds kroner. Der var altid et eller andet, der kom i vejen. Jeg meldte mig også til brand-korpset. Vi stod et halvt hundrede mand i forhallen og skød brystet frem for at give indtryk af kraft og stor tapperhed. En fuldmægtig gik frem og tilbage og mønstrede disse ansøgere, mærkede på deres arme og stillede dem forskellige spørgsmål, og mig gik han forbi, rystede bare på hovedet og sagde, at jeg var kasseret på grund af mine briller. Jeg mødte op igen, uden briller, jeg stod der med rynkede øjenbryn og gjorde mine øjne så skarpe som knive, og manden gik igen forbi mig, og han smilede, – han havde genkendt mig. Det værste af det hele var, at mit tøj var begyndt at blive så dårligt at jeg ikke længere kunne møde op til en stilling som et anstændigt menneske.","God knows, I wondered if I should never succeed in finding a job again!

I also signed up for the fire brigade. We stood half a hundred men in the vestibule, pushing our chests forward to give the impression of power and great bravery. A clerk walked back and forth, mustering these applicants, marking on their arms and asking them various questions, and me he passed by, just shaking his head and saying I was discarded because of my glasses. I showed up again, without glasses, I stood there with wrinkled eyebrows and made my eyes as sharp as knives, and the man walked past me again, and he smiled - he had recognized me.

I turned up again, later, without the glasses. I stood there with my eyebrows scrunched up, and made my eyes as sharp as knife ends: he walked past me again, and smiled--he had recognized me.

I started to laugh, silently and passionately, for no reason whatever, still giddy and drunk from the two glasses of beer I had had. Shortly afterwards, my brilliant excitement started to fade, I became more and more calm. My sore finger felt cold, and I put it between my neck and collar to warm it a little. Finally we came to Tomte Street. The cab stopped.","I leant back in the vehicle, a prey to the wildest fancies; crouched under the hood so that no one could see me. I moved my lips and commenced to I talk idiotically to myself. Madness rages through my brain, and I let it rage. I am fully conscious that I am succumbing to influences over which I have no control. I begin to laugh, silently, passionately, without a trace of cause, still merry and intoxicated from the couple of glasses of ale I have drunk. Little by little my excitement abates, my calm returns more and more to me. I feel the cold in my sore finger, and I stick it down inside my collar to warm it a little. At length we reach Tomtegaden. The driver pulls up.","A prey to the wildest fancies, I leaned back in the carriage, curled up under the oilskin hood so that no one could see I was moving my lips, and took to chattering idiotically to myself.

I began to laugh, noiselessly and passionately, without a trace of a reason, still jolly and drunk from the couple of glasses of beer I had had.

"Falsk? Der stod „Jomfruen“ og ligefrem spurgte, om jeg havde skrevet falsk. Han spurgte mig endda hurtigt og interesseret. Jeg kiggede på ham, følte mig dybt krænket og svarede ikke.","False? It said ""The Virgin"" and even asked if I had written falsely. He even asked me quickly and interestedly. I looked at him, felt deeply offended and did not respond.","Saw it? Queeny was implying right to my face that I had been cheating. He put in his question quickly; obviously he was very interested. I looked at him, felt deeply insulted, and did not answer.","False entry! There stood ""Missy,"" and asked me straight in the face if I had done this thing. He even asked eagerly, and evidently with much interest. I looked at him, felt deeply insulted, and made no reply.","“Forgery?” There stood the “Maiden” asking me point-blank if I had committed forgery. He even put his question quickly and interestedly. I looked at him, felt deeply insulted and didn’t answer."
"Hvis han havde sendt mig ud ad døren med det samme, ville det have føltes mere velkomment; jeg var på grådens rand og sagde:","If he had sent me out the door right away, it would have felt more welcome; I was on the verge of crying and said:","If he had ordered me out right away, it would have been easier; I felt near crying, and said, ""Forgive me for. . .""",If he had shown me the door it would have been almost as acceptable. I felt as if I were on the point of crying and said:,"If he had shown me the door on the spot, it would have been more welcome."
"Hvor var det dog også som den hede, levende, evindelige fanden, at der aldrig skulle være nogen ende på mine genvordigheder! Med lange, rasende skridt, med frakkens opslag brutalt slået op i nakken og med hænderne knyttet i bukselommerne gik jeg og skældte i én køre ud på min ulykkelige stjerne. Ikke et eneste sorgløst øjeblik de sidste syv, otte måneder, ikke den mest nødvendige mad en uge i træk, før nøden igen tvang mig i knæ. Her havde jeg oven i købet gået rundt og været ærlig midt i elendigheden, haha, helt igennem bundærlig! Gud fri mig vel sikken en nar jeg havde været! Og jeg begyndte at fortælle mig selv om, hvordan jeg endda havde gået rundt og haft dårlig samvittighed over, at jeg engang havde taget Hans Paulis tæppe med til pantelåneren. Jeg lo hånligt ad min ømskindede hæderlighed, spyttede foragteligt på gaden og kunne slet ikke finde ord, der var stærke nok til at gøre nar af mig selv over min dumhed. Det skulle have været nu! Hvis jeg i dette øjeblik fandt en skolepiges sparepenge på gaden, en fattig enkes sidste øre, så ville jeg samle den op og putte den i lommen, stjæle den med velberåd hu og sove roligt som en sten hele den følgende nat. Så ville jeg ikke have lidt så usigeligt meget for ingenting, men det var forbi med min tålmodighed, jeg var parat til hvad som helst.","How was it, too, like the hot, living, eternal devil that there should never be any end to my hardships! With long, furious steps, with the spread of my coat brutally turned up in my neck and with my hands tied in my trouser pockets, I went and scolded in one run out on my unhappy star. Not a single carefree moment for the last seven, eight months, not the most necessary food a week in a row before distress again forced me to my knees. Here I had even walked around and been honest in the middle of misery, haha, completely bottomless! God save me for once I have been! And I began to tell myself how I had even walked around and had a bad conscience over the fact that I had once taken Hans Pauli's blanket with me to the pawnbroker. I laughed scornfully at my tender honesty, spat contemptuously on the street, and could not at all find words strong enough to make fun of myself over my stupidity. It should have been now! If at this moment I found a schoolgirl's savings on the street, a poor widow's last ear, then I would pick it up and put it in my pocket, steal it with well-advised mind, and sleep calmly like a rock all the following night. Then I would not have suffered so unspeakably much for nothing, but it was over with my patience, I was ready for anything.","Wasn't this great, what the hell was going on, why was there never any end to my troubles! Taking long strides, my coat collar turned brutally up to my chin, my fists clenched in my pants pockets, I walked along, cursing my unlucky stars. Not a really carefree hour for seven, eight months, not even sufficient food for a week before poverty brought me to my knees again. And into the bargain I had to go and be honorable right in the middle of my misery--what a laugh, honorable all the way through! God help us all, what a fool I had been. I started recounting to myself how I had once gone around with a bad conscience from taking Hans Pauli's blanket to the pawnshop. I laughed mockingly at my tender scrupulousness, spit contemptuously in the street, and couldn't find words strong enough to describe my idiocy. If that were only now! If this minute I found a schoolgirl's savings on the street or the last řre of some poor widow, I would jump for it and stick it in my pocket, steal it with calm deliberation, and sleep like a top all night. I hadn't suffered so unspeakably for nothing, my patience was finished, I was ready for anything that came along.","Wasn't it now the very hottest eternal devil existing to think that my hardships never would come to an end! Taking long, furious strides, with the collar of my coat hunched savagely up round my ears, and my hands thrust in my breeches pockets, I strode along, cursing my unlucky stars the whole way. Not one real untroubled hour in seven or eight months, not the common food necessary to hold body and soul together for the space of one short week, before want stared me in the face again. Here I had, into the bargain, gone and kept straight and honourable all through my misery-- Ha! ha! straight and honourable to the heart's core. God preserve me, what a fool I had been! And I commenced to tell myself how I had even gone about conscience-stricken because I had once brought Hans Pauli's blanket to the pawn-broker's. I laughed sarcastically at my delicate rectitude, spat contemptuously in the street, and could not find words half strong enough to mock myself for my stupidity. Let it only happen now! Were I to find at this moment a schoolgirl's savings or a poor widow's only penny, I would snatch it up and pocket it; steal it deliberately, and sleep the whole night through like a top. I had not suffered so unspeakably much for nothing-- my patience was gone--I was prepared to do anything.","Why the hell, why the living everlasting hell, wouldn’t my tribulations ever end! Taking long furious strides, my coat collar turned raffishly up in the back and my hands clenched in my trouser pockets, I cursed my unlucky stars every step of the way. Not a truly carefree moment in seven to eight months, not the bare necessities of life for an entire short week before want once again brought me to my knees. And on top of it all, here I had gone around being honest in the midst of my misery, heh-heh, fundamentally honest anyway! Good heavens, what a fool I had been. And I began to tell myself how I had even gone around with a bad conscience because I had once taken Hans Pauli’s blanket to the pawnbroker. I laughed scornfully at my tender scruples, spat contemptuously in the gutter and was at a loss for words that were strong enough to deride myself for my folly. It should have been now! Were I to find on the street, this minute, a schoolgirl’s modest savings, a poor widow’s last penny, I would snatch it up and stick it in my pocket, steal it in cold blood and sleep like a log all night afterward. I hadn’t suffered so unspeakably for nothing, my patience was up, I was ready for anything."
"Nej, det er sikkert rigtigt, at det ikke er noget værd, sagde jeg; men jeg tænkte, at det kunne sælges under ét sammen med et andet gammelt tæppe på auktionen.","No, it's probably true that it's not worth anything, I said; but I thought it could be sold together with another old rug at the auction.","""I know it isn't worth anything,"" I said, ""but I thought it might go if it were sold with another old blanket at an auction.""","""No, it's clear it isn't worth anything,"" I said; ""but I thought it might go with another old blanket at an auction.""","“I know it isn’t worth anything,” I said, “but I thought it could be thrown in with another old blanket at the auction.”"
"Jeg puttede hånden med pengene i lommen, tog i dørhåndtaget og gik; jeg kunne høre, at jeg sagde godnat, og at ekspedienten svarede.","I put my hand with the money in my pocket, took the doorknob and left; I could hear that I said goodnight and that the clerk answered.","I put my hand with the money into my pocket, turned the knob, and went out; I heard myself say good night, and the clerk answer.","I thrust the hand with the money into my pocket, turned the door-handle, and left.

"Solen skinnede ind gennem mit vindue, nedenunder kunne jeg høre hestene tygge havre. Jeg sad og gumlede på min træflis, opstemt, glad som et barn. Hele tiden havde jeg mærket efter manuskriptet; jeg tænkte ikke på det en eneste gang, men instinktet fortalte mig, at det fandtes, mit blod mindede mig om det. Og jeg hev det frem.","The sun was shining in through my window, down below I could hear the horses chewing oats. I sat munching on my wood chips, elated, happy as a child.

I kept all the time feeling for my manuscript. It wasn't really in my thoughts, but instinct told me it was there--'twas in my blood to remember it, and I took it out. It had got wet, and I spread it out in the sun to dry; then I took to wandering up and down the room.","The sun shone in through my window, downstairs I could hear the horses chomping their oats.

I would bet anything that there was something sneaky about that package.","The man sat motionless, thinking. Why didn't he carry his paper like every other man, with the front page showing?

"I Møllergaden stoppede jeg op uden for en beværtning og indsnusede den friske duft af kød, der blev stegt derinde; jeg havde allerede hånden på dørhåndtaget og skulle til at gå ind uden noget ærinde, men tog mig i det i tide og gik væk fra stedet. Da jeg kom til Stortorvet og ledte efter et sted, hvor jeg kunne hvile et stykke tid, var alle bænkene optaget, og jeg ledte forgæves rundt om hele kirken efter et stille sted, hvor jeg kunne slå mig ned. Naturligvis! sagde jeg mørkt til mig selv, naturligvis, naturligvis! Og jeg begyndte at gå igen. Jeg gjorde en afstikker forbi vandposten ved basarhjørnet og drak en slurk vand, gik igen, slæbte mig fremad fod for fod, gav mig tid til lange ophold ved hvert butiksvindue, stoppede op og fulgte hver eneste vogn med øjnene, der fór forbi mig. Jeg mærkede en lysende varme i mit hoved, og et eller andet mærkeligt bankede i mine tindinger; vandet jeg havde drukket, gjorde mig yderst dårligt tilpas, og jeg gik og kastede lidt op her og der i gaden. På den måde kom jeg direkte op til Krist kirkegård. Jeg satte mig ned med albuerne på knæene og hovedet i hænderne; i denne sammenkrummede stilling havde jeg det godt og kunne ikke længere mærke den lille gnaven i brystet.","In Møllergaden I stopped outside a pub and sniffed the fresh smell of meat that was fried inside; I already had my hand on the door handle and was going to go in without any errand, but took me in it in time and walked away from the place. When I came to Stortorvet and looked for a place where I could rest for a while, all the pews were occupied, and I searched in vain around the whole church for a quiet place where I could sit down. Of course! I said darkly to myself, of course, of course! And I started walking again. I made a detour past the water post at the bazaar corner and drank a sip of water, walked again, dragged myself forward foot by foot, gave myself time for long stays at each shop window, stopped, and followed every wagon with the eyes that passed me. I felt a luminous heat in my head, and something strange knocked in my temples; the water I had drunk made me extremely uncomfortable, and I went and threw up a little here and there in the street. That way I came straight up to Christ Cemetery. I sat down with my elbows on my knees and my head in my hands; in this hunched position I was well and could no longer feel the little gnaw in my chest.","On Mřller Street I stopped outside a restaurant and sniffed the marvelous odor of meat cooking inside; I had already put my hand on the doorknob and was ready to drift in when I caught myself in time and walked away. When I got down to the main market square, I looked around for a place to sit but found all the benches taken. I walked around the church on all sides looking for a quiet place to flop down. Naturally! I said bitterly to myself, naturally, what else! I started to walk again. I made a swing past the corner fountain and took a swallow of water, started to walk once more, dragged myself along, one foot after the other, stopped a long while outside every store window, turned to watch every wagon as it rattled past. I felt a sort of shimmering heat inside my head, and the beating in my temples was strange. The water I had drunk did not agree with me, and I walked on, throwing up a little here, a little there, in the gutter. Finally I made it to the Cemetery of Christ. I sat down with my elbows on my knees, my head in my hands: bent over like that, it was better, and I didn't feel the small gnawing in my chest any longer.","I halted outside an eating-house in Möller Street, and sniffed the fresh smell of meat roasting inside; my hand was already upon the door-handle, and I was on the point of entering without any fixed purpose, when I bethought myself in time, and left the spot. On reaching the market, and seeking for a place to rest for a little, I found all the benches occupied, and I sought in vain all round outside the church for a quiet seat, where I could sit down. Naturally, I told myself, gloomily--naturally, naturally; and I commenced to walk again. I took a turn round the fountain at the corner of the bazaar, and swallowed a mouthful of water. On again, dragging one foot after the other; stopped for a long time before each shop window; halted, and watched every vehicle that drove by. I felt a scorching heat in my head, and something pulsated strangely in my temples. The water I had drunk disagreed with me fearfully, and I retched, stopping here and there to escape being noticed in the open street. In this manner I came up to Our Saviour's Cemetery. I sat down here, with my elbows on my knees and my head in my hands. In this cramped position I was more at ease, and I no longer felt the little gnawing in my chest.","On Møller Street I stopped outside a tavern and sniffed the fresh aroma of meat roasting inside; I had already put my hand on the doorknob and was about to go in to no purpose, but I thought better of it and walked away. When I got to Stortorvet Square and looked for a spot where I could rest awhile, all the benches were taken, and I searched in vain all around the church for a quiet place where I could settle down. Of course! I said gloomily to myself, of course, of course! And I took to wandering again. I made a detour down to the drinking fountain at the corner of the Arcades and drank a mouthful of water, then went on, dragging myself forward step by step, taking time for long pauses in front of every shop window and stopping to follow every passing carriage with my eyes. I felt a white heat in my head, and my temples were pounding strangely. The water I had drunk disagreed very badly with me, and I vomited a bit here and there in the street. In this way I got as far as Christ’s Cemetery. I sat down with my elbows on my knees and my head between my hands; in this curled-up position I was comfortable and no longer felt the gnawing pain in my chest."
"Et dejligt Guds vejr, ja. Og var fruen så heller ikke hjemme?","A lovely weather of God, yes. And was the lady not home either?","""Yes, wonderful weather.

"Men jeg kunne jo forsøge mig med knapperne? Det nyttede selvfølgelig ikke noget, og desuden var jeg ret så syg. Men når jeg tænkte mig om, så skulle jeg jo egentlig hen i retning af „Onkel“ – min rigtige „Onkel“ – når jeg gik hjem?","But I could try the buttons? Of course, it did not help, and besides, I was pretty sick. But when I thought about it, did I really have to go in the direction of ""Uncle"" - my real ""Uncle"" - when I went home?","Of course I could try the buttons? It wouldn't do any good, naturally, and besides I was really sick. But when I thought of it, wouldn't I actually go almost past ""Uncle"" --my private ""Uncle""--on the way home?","I might try with the buttons. Of course there would be no use in trying; and besides, I was now in a rather bad way; but when I came to consider the matter closely, I would be obliged, as it were, to pass in the direction of my ""Uncle's"" as I went home.","I could try with the buttons though, couldn’t I? But it obviously wouldn’t do any good, and besides I was rather sick. On second thought, however, walking home I would have to go in the direction of “Uncle’s”—my proper “Uncle’s”—anyway."
"Hvordan kunne jeg dog finde på at lede efter den! Der var gået flere uger, siden den var i min besiddelse. Hvad gik der dog af mig? Den forbavsede pige ventede ikke længere, men trak sig skyndsomst tilbage. Og jeg var nødt til at lade hende gå. Folk stimlede sammen om mig og lo højt, en politibetjent maser sig igennem til mig og vil vide, hvad der sker.","How could I think of looking for it though! It had been several weeks since it was in my possession. What happened to me though? The astonished girl did not wait any longer, but hurriedly withdrew. And I had to let her go.

"De lyver! sagde jeg. Og med en frækhed, som undrede mig selv, fortsatte jeg: Jeg er nødt til at tale med ham; det er et nødvendigt ærinde. Jeg har en meddelelse fra Stiftsgården.","They're lying! I said. And with a cheekiness that amazed myself, I continued: I have to talk to him; it is a necessary errand. I have a message from Stiftsgården.","""You are lying!"" I said. Then, with an audacity that surprised even myself, I continued: ""I have to talk with him; it is urgent. I have some information from the Governor's Mansion.""","""Not in, do you hear.""

"Ved middagstid gik jeg ud af mit logi i Tomtegaden, hvor jeg stadig boede og havde det godt for „Kommandantens“ tikrone, og begav mig af sted ud i byen. Jeg befandt mig i den gladeste sindsstemning og drev omkring hele eftermiddagen i de mest befærdede gader og kiggede på mennesker. Inden klokken blev syv om aftenen, tog jeg mig en tur op til St. Olavs Plads og kiggede i smug op mod vinduerne i nummer 2. Om en time skulle jeg se hende! Jeg gik rundt i en let, dejlig angst hele tiden. Hvad ville der ske! Hvad skulle jeg finde på at sige, når hun kom ned ad trappen? God aften, frøken? Eller bare smile? Jeg besluttede mig for at lade det være nok med at smile. Selvfølgelig ville jeg bukke dybt for hende.","At noon I left my lodging in Tomtegaden, where I still lived and was well for the ""Commander's"" tikrone, and set off for the city.

I walked around in a light, nice anxiety all the time. What would happen! What was I supposed to say when she came downstairs? Good evening, miss? Or just smile? I decided to let it be enough to smile. Of course, I would bow deeply to her.","About two in the afternoon I left my room on Tomte Street where I was still living very comfortably on the Chief's ten-kroner note, and went out. I was in the highest spirits and wandered around all afternoon in the busiest streets I could find, looking at people. Even before the clock showed seven in the evening, I made a swing up to St. Olaf's Place and took a furtive look up at the windows of number 2. In one hour I would see her! I walked around in a sweet, delightful anxiety the whole time. What would happen? What would I find to say when she came down the stairs? Good evening? Or should I just smile? I decided to let it go with just a smile. Of course I would bow very deeply also.","At noon I left my lodgings in Tomtegaden, where I still lived and found fairly comfortable, and set out for town. I was in the merriest humour, and lazied about the whole afternoon through the most frequented streets and looked at the people. Even before seven o'clock I took a turn up St. Olav's Place and took a furtive look up at the window of No. 2. In an hour I would see her. I went about the whole time in a state of tremulous, delicious dread. What would happen? What should I say when she came down the stairs? Good-evening? or only smile? I concluded to let it rest with the smile. Of course I would bow profoundly to her.","Around noon I left my lodging on Tomte Street, where I was still staying and doing fine on the “Commander’s” ten-krone bill, and went out. I was in exuberant spirits and loafed about all afternoon in the most crowded streets, observing the people. It wasn’t yet seven o’clock when I took a stroll to St. Olaf Place and peeped on the sly up at the windows of number two. In an hour I would see her! I was caught up in a mild, delicious fear the whole time. What would happen? What should I say when she came down the stairs? Good evening, miss? Or just smile? I decided to settle for the smile. Of course I would make a deep bow to her."
"Maden begyndte at virke, den generede mig meget, og jeg fik ikke lov til at beholde den længe. Jeg gik hen og tømte mig i hvert eneste mørke hjørne jeg kom forbi, kæmpede med at undertrykke denne kvalme, der udhulede mig igen, knyttede hænderne og gjorde mig stærk, stampede i gaden og forsøgte rasende at sluge det der ville op – forgæves! Jeg løb til sidst ind i en port, krumbøjet, blind af vand der sprængte sig vej ud i mine øjne, og tømte mig igen.","The food started to work, it bothered me a lot and I was not allowed to keep it for long. I walked and emptied myself into every dark corner I passed, struggling to suppress this nausea that eroded me again, clasped my hands and made myself strong, stomped in the street and tried furiously to swallow what would come up - in vain! I eventually ran into a gate, hunched over, blinded by water that burst its way out into my eyes, emptying me again.","The food began to bother me, my stomach felt upset, and I would not be able to hold the food down very long. I walked along emptying my mouth, in every dark crook I passed, fought against the nausea which was making me hollow all over again, clenched my fists, steeled myself, stamped on the sidewalk, and swallowed again in a rage what was trying to come up--all in vain! I ran at last into a doorway, doubled over, blinded from the tears that sprang from my eyes, and vomited everything.","The food commenced to take effect. I suffered much from it, and could not keep it down for any length of time. I had to empty my mouth a little at every dark corner I came to. I struggled to master this nausea which threatened to hollow me out anew, clenched my hands, and tried to fight it down; stamped on the pavement, and gulped down furiously whatever sought to come up. All in vain. I sprang at last into a doorway, doubled up, head foremost, blinded with the water which gushed from my eyes, and vomited once more.","The food began to take effect, it gave me great pain and I wasn’t allowed to keep it for very long.

I ran at last into an entranceway where, hunched over and blinded with the water that flooded my eyes, I emptied myself once again."
"Jeg synes, dette er så besynderligt, at jeg uvilkårligt sætter farten ned; i dette øjeblik er der god ro og orden i mine tanker, men jeg er meget ophidset, mine nerver er tirrede efter det sidste måltid. Jeg går som sædvanlig lige forbi hende, kommer næsten hen til porten og skal til at gå indenfor. Så stopper jeg op. Jeg får i det samme et indfald. Uden at forklare det over for mig selv vender jeg om og går lige hen til damen, jeg kigger hende ind i ansigtet og hilser:","I think this is so strange that I involuntarily slow down; in this moment there is good calm and order in my thoughts but I am very excited, my nerves are tired after the last meal. I walk as usual right past her, almost come to the gate and have to go inside. Then I stop. I immediately get a whim. Without explaining it to myself, I turn around and walk straight to the lady, I look her in the face and greet:","I found this so extraordinary that involuntarily I slowed up. In that instant my brain was working well, even though it was rather excited, and my nerves on edge from the last meal. I walked as usual close to her and past her, got almost to the door, and was about to go inside. Then I stopped. I had an impulse suddenly. Without reasoning with myself at all, I turned around and walked over to the woman, looked into her face and said, ""Good evening!""","I find this so peculiar that I involuntarily slacken my pace. At this moment my thoughts are in good working order, but I am much excited; my nerves are irritated by my last meal. I pass her by as usual; am almost at the door and on the point of entering. There I stop. All of a sudden an inspiration seizes me. Without rendering myself any account of it, I turn round and go straight up to the lady, look her in the face, and bow.","I find this to be so odd that I instinctively slacken my steps. At this moment my thoughts are in proper order, but I am all worked up, my nerves being irritated by my last meal. I walk straight past her as usual, get almost to the door and am about to step inside. Then I stop. I have a sudden inspiration. Without trying to understand why, I turn around, walk straight up to the lady, look her full in the face and say, “Good evening, miss.”"
"Men lidt senere syntes hun godt, at jeg kunne følge med hende hen til porten. Herregud, det var der vel ikke noget galt med. Vel?","But a little later she felt good that I could follow her to the gate. My God, there was nothing wrong with that. Well?","But a minute later she thought I could certainly come with her to the door. After all, there was nothing wrong with that, was there?","But a second after she thought I might as well go as far as the door with her. Gracious me, there couldn't be anything wrong in that, could there?","But a moment later she thought I could certainly walk her to the door.

"Jeg tog andre midler i brug, talte skarpt og frabad mig mere vrøvl. Var det aldrig sket, at nogen andre havde betalt hende penge i forskud på en tilsvarende måde? Jeg mente selvfølgelig folk, som havde penge nok, for eksempel nogle af konsulerne? Aldrig? Ja, det skulle vel ikke gå ud over mig, at det var en fremgangsmåde, der var helt fremmed for hende. Det var skik og brug i udlandet. Hun havde måske aldrig været uden for landets grænser? Nej, der kan De se! Så kunne hun jo slet ikke udtale sig om denne sag ... Og jeg greb ud efter flere kager på bordet.","I took other means in use, spoke sharply and begged for more nonsense. Had it never happened that someone else had paid her money in advance in a similar way? I mean, of course, people who had enough money, for example, some of the consuls? Never? Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. It was customary abroad. Maybe she had never been outside the country's borders? No, there you can see! Then she could not comment on this matter at all ... And I reached for more cakes on the table.","I had to adopt other means. I spoke in a sharp tone and said I wanted no twaddle. Hadn't anyone ever paid her in advance for goods just as I had? I asked. For example, people of means, people in the consular service for instance? Never? Well, I could not be responsible for the fact that she was unfamiliar with that procedure. It was perfectly ordinary procedure in other countries. Had she ever, by the way, been out of this country? No? Well, there, you see! She really had no right to an opinion in this matter. . . . I picked up several more cakes from her table.","I had recourse to other expedients--spoke sharply, and bade a truce to all nonsense. Had it never happened to her before that any one had paid her in advance in this manner? I inquired--I meant, of course, people who could afford it--for example, any of the consuls? Never? Well, I could not be expected to suffer because it happened to be a strange mode of procedure to her. It was a common practice abroad. She had perhaps never been outside the boundaries of her own country? No? Just look at that now! In that case, she could of course have no opinion on the subject; ... and I took several more cakes from the table.","I tried another tack, spoke sharply and refused to listen to any nonsense. Hadn’t it ever happened to her to be paid in advance in the same way? I asked. Of course, I meant by people who were well off, some of the consuls, for example? Never? Well, it wasn’t fair that I should suffer because she was unfamiliar with that social custom. It was accepted practice in foreign countries. But maybe she had never been abroad? Ah, there you are! Then she didn’t have a word to say in this matter. . . . And I made a grab for several cakes on the table."
"Jeg havde ingen problemer med at få den leveret tilbage. Manden bragte mig selv vesten og bad mig om at undersøge alle lommerne med det samme; jeg fandt også et par lånesedler, som jeg stak til mig, og takkede den venlige mand for hans imødekommenhed. Jeg følte mig mere og mere tiltalt af ham, det blev i samme øjeblik magtpåliggende for mig at give dette menneske et godt indtryk af mig. Jeg slog en runde hen imod døren og vendte igen tilbage til disken, som om jeg havde glemt noget; jeg syntes, jeg skyldte ham en forklaring, en oplysning, og jeg gav mig til at nynne for at påkalde mig hans opmærksomhed.

"En og anden betjent, der havde haft vagt hele natten, var det eneste tegn på liv jeg så i gaderne; lidt senere var der også nogle mænd, der gik i gang med at slukke gaslygterne rundt omkring. Jeg drev rundt på må og få, kom op til Kirkegaden og gik ad vejen ned til Fæstningen. Kold og stadig søvnig, mat i knæene og ryggen efter den lange tur og meget sulten satte jeg mig på en bænk og døsede hen et langt stykke tid.

I walked up and down hard by the café, kept close to the iron railings, and kept a sharp watch on all who went in and came out of the door.

"Nede i Akersgaden kiggede jeg ind i et butiksvindue og så, at klokken bare var lidt over tolv.

Min følje-tons skæbne fyldte mig med mørke anelser; jo mere jeg tænkte på den, desto mere urimeligt forekom det mig, at jeg kunne have skrevet noget anvendeligt så pludseligt, næsten i søvne, med hjernen fuld af feber og drømme. Selvfølgelig havde jeg ført mig selv bag lyset og været glad hele formiddagen over ingenting! Selvfølgelig! ... Jeg bevægede mig i hurtig gang op ad Ullevålsvejen, forbi St. Hanshaugen, kom ud på åbne marker, ind i de trange, underlige gader ved Sagene, over byggetomter og pløjemarker og befandt mig til sidst på en landevej, jeg ikke kunne se hvor endte.","Down in Akersgaden I looked into a shop window and saw that it was just over twelve o'clock. This made me even more desperate, I had completely certainly hoped it was well past noon, and before four o'clock it was no use going up to the editor.

Of course, I had led myself behind the light and been happy all morning with nothing! Of course! ... I moved quickly up Ullevålsvejen, past St. Hanshaugen, came out on open fields, into the narrow, strange streets at Sagene, over building plots and plowed fields and finally found myself on a country road I could not see where ended.","Once on Akers Street again, I glanced into a shop window and saw that it was only a few minutes past twelve. This made me despair even more. I had been so sure it was long past noon; there was no sense in visiting the editor before four.

I had deceived myself, that's all, had been overjoyed all morning for nothing! That's all! . . .

Of course I had deceived myself and been happy all through the long morning for nothing!... Of course!... I rushed with hurried strides up Ullavold-sveien, past St. Han's Hill, until I came to the open fields; on through the narrow quaint lanes in Sagene, past waste plots and small tilled fields, and found myself at last on a country road, the end of which I could not see.","Down in Aker Street I glanced into a shop window and saw that it was only a few minutes past twelve.

Jeg kastede mig fladt på gulvet og græd af glæde over dette velsignede glimt af lys, hulkede af taknemmelighed, sendte vinduet fingerkys og opførte mig som en gal.

And I was also in this moment aware of what I was doing.

"Nu gik det udmærket i flere minutter. Replik efter replik opstod fuldt færdig i hovedet på mig, og jeg skrev uafbrudt. Jeg fylder den ene side efter den anden, farer af sted over stok og sten, klynker stille af henrykkelse over min gode stemning og er næsten ikke mig selv bevidst.

I got a new idea too, an excellent one, about a church bell that would suddenly burst out ringing at a certain point in the plot. Everything went marvelously.","Things went splendidly for a few minutes. Retort upon retort stood ready in my head, and I wrote uninterruptedly. I filled one page after the other, dashed ahead over stock and stone, chuckled softly in ecstasy over my happy vein, and was scarcely conscious of myself.

All was going ahead with overwhelming rapidity.","Now it went extremely well for several minutes. One speech after another sprang up in my head, perfectly finished, and I wrote without a break.

"Da jeg kom ned igen, smækkede jeg porten udefra og stillede mig hen i skæret fra lygten. Der var stille overalt, jeg hørte kun de tunge, klirrende fodtrin fra en betjent nede i sidegaden, og langt væk, i retning af St. Hanshaugen, en hund der gøede. Der var intet, der forstyrrede mig, jeg trak frakkeopslagene op om ørerne og gav mig til at tænke af alle kræfter. Det ville være en første klasses hjælp, hvis jeg var så heldig at kunne få fod på slutningen til denne lille afhandling.

Næh, nej, så lader jeg være med det, jeg kan se, at De bliver bange, jeg skal lade være, skal lade være, hører De. Herregud, hvorfor bliver De så forskrækket? Jeg står jo helt stille, jeg rører mig ikke ud af stedet. Jeg ville have lagt mig på knæ på tæppet i et minut, lige derhenne, på den røde farve lige for fødderne af Dem. Men De blev bange, jeg kunne straks se det på Deres øjne, at De blev bange, derfor blev jeg stående. Jeg tog ikke et eneste skridt, da jeg bad Dem om det; gjorde jeg vel? Jeg stod lige så ubevægelig som nu, hvor jeg viser Dem det sted, hvor jeg ville være faldet på knæ for Dem, derhenne på den røde rose i tæppet. Jeg peger ikke engang med fingeren, jeg peger overhovedet ikke, jeg lader være med at gøre det for ikke at gøre Dem forskrækket, jeg nikker bare med hovedet og kigger derhen, sådan! Og De forstår udmærket, hvad det er for en rose, jeg mener, men De vil ikke tillade mig at knæle der; De er bange for mig og tør ikke komme tæt på mig. Jeg fatter ikke, at De kan få Dem til at kalde mig gal. Ikke sandt, De tror heller ikke på det længere? Der var engang i sommer, for længe siden, dengang var jeg gal; jeg arbejdede for hårdt og glemte at gå og spise middag til tiden, når jeg havde meget at tænke på. Det skete den ene dag efter den anden; jeg burde have husket det, men jeg glemte det i ét væk. Ved Gud i himlen, det er sandt! Gud, lad mig aldrig komme levende herfra, hvis jeg lyver! Der kan De se, De behandler mig ikke retfærdigt. Det var ikke på grund af pengenød jeg gjorde det; jeg har kredit, masser af kredit, hos Engebret og Gravesen; jeg gik også tit med masser af penge på lommen og købte alligevel ikke mad, fordi jeg glemte det. Kan De så høre! De siger ikke noget, De svarer ikke, De går overhovedet ikke væk fra kaminen, De står bare og venter på, at jeg skal gå ...","Now I go, now I go! Can you not see that I already have my hand on the doorknob? Goodbye! Goodbye, I say! They would then like to answer me when I say goodbye twice and stand clapped and ready to go. I'm not even asking permission to meet you again, because that would be painful for you; but tell me once: Why did you not leave me alone? What have I done to you? I did not bother you then; did I? Why do you suddenly turn away from me, as if you no longer know me at all? Now you have completely undressed me to the skin, made me even more miserable than I have ever been. My God, but I'm not crazy. You know very well if you think that there is nothing wrong with me now. Then come and shake my hand! Or allow me to come to you! Do you want it? I will not hurt you, I will just kneel before you for a moment, kneel on the floor in front of you, just a moment; do i have to? Nah, no, then I'll let go of it, I can see you're scared, I have to let go, I have to let go, you hear. My God, why are you so frightened? I'm standing still, I'm not moving out of place. I would have knelt on the rug for a minute, right there, on the red color right at your feet. But you were afraid, I could immediately see in your eyes that you were afraid, therefore I stood. I did not take a single step when I asked you to; did I? I stood just as motionless as now, showing you the place where I would have fallen on my knees before you, there on the red rose in the rug. I do not even point with my finger, I do not point at all, I do not do it so as not to scare you, I just nod my head and look there, like that! And you understand very well what a rose it is, I mean, but you will not allow me to kneel there; They are afraid of me and dare not come close to me. I do not understand that you can make me call me crazy. Isn't that right, you do not believe in it anymore either? There was once this summer, a long time ago, then I was mad; I worked too hard and forgot to go and have dinner on time when I had a lot to think about. It happened one day after another; I should have remembered it, but I forgot it in one go. By God in heaven, it's true! God, never let me come alive from here if I'm lying! You can see there, you are not treating me fairly. It was not because of lack of money I did it; I have credit, lots of credit, at Engebret and Gravesen; I also often went with lots of money in my pocket and still did not buy food because I forgot. Can you hear then! You do not say anything, you do not answer, you do not walk away from the fireplace at all, you just stand and wait for me to go ...","""All right, I'm leaving, I'm leaving! Don't you see I already have my hand on the doorknob? Goodbye! I am saying goodbye! You could at least answer me when I say goodbye two times, and am standing here ready to leave.

I wasn't really bothering you, was I? And why were you suddenly cold to me as if you didn't know me any more? Now you've taken everything I had left, I'm worse off now than I was before. But so help me God, I'm not insane. You'll realize now if you think about it that there is nothing wrong with me. Come here then and give me your hand! Or let me come over to you! May I do that? I won't do anything bad, I will just kneel in front of you one minute, kneel there on the floor in front of you, just one moment-- may I? No, no, all right, I won't do it , I can see you're frightened, I won't, listen, I won't do it. But, my God, why are you so terrified? I'm standing still, I'm not moving a muscle. I wanted to kneel on the carpet a moment, right there, on that big red patch by your foot. But you became frightened, I could see instantly in your eyes that you were afraid, so I stood still. I didn't move an inch while I was asking you if I could do it, did I? I was just as motionless then, when I showed you the spot where I wanted to kneel, there on that red rose in the carpet, as I am now. I didn't even point with my finger, I didn't point at all , I let it go so as not to scare you, I just nodded over in that direction, like this! And you understood very well which rose I meant, but you won't allow me to kneel there-- you're afraid of me, and you don't dare come near me. I don't understand, though, how you could let yourself call me insane. That is not true, and you don't believe it yourself any longer, do you? One summer, a long time ago, I did go crazy--I was working too hard and I forgot to eat as I should have. My mind was full of ideas. I forgot day after day--I ought to have remembered to eat, but I constantly forgot. So help me God, it is the truth! May God strike me down right here if I am lying! There, you can see, you are being unjust with me. And I didn't do it from having no money --I had credit, my credit was excellent, at both Ingebret's Grocery and Gravesen's. I often had a lot of money in my pockets, and yet I never bought food--simply because I forgot to . It's really the truth!

I don't even ask to meet you again, for it would torment you. But tell me, why didn't you leave me in peace? What had I done to you? I didn't get in your way, now, did I? Why did you turn away from me all at once, as if you didn't know me any longer? You have plucked me now so thoroughly bare, made me even more wretched than I ever was at any time before; but, indeed, I am not insane. You know well, if you think it over, that nothing is the matter with me now. Come over, then, and give me your hand--or give me leave to go to you, will you? I won't do you any harm; I will only kneel before you, only for a minute --kneel down on the floor before you, only for a minute, may I? No, no; there, I am not to do it then, I see. You are getting afraid. I will not, I will not do it; do you hear? Lord, why do you get so terrified. I am standing quite still; I am not moving. I would have knelt down on the carpet for a moment--just there, upon that patch of red, at your feet; but you got frightened--I could see it at once in your eyes that you got frightened; that was why I stood still.

I don't point at all; I let it be, not to frighten you. I only nod and look over at it, like this! and you know perfectly well which rose I mean, but you won't let me kneel there. You are afraid of me, and dare not come near to me. I cannot conceive how you could have the heart to call me insane. It isn't true; you don't believe it, either, any longer? It was once in the summer, a long time ago, I was mad; I worked too hard, and forgot to go to dine at the right hour, when I had too much to think about. That happened day after day. I ought to have remembered it; but I went on forgetting it--by God in Heaven, it is true! God keep me from ever coming alive from this spot if I lie. There, you can see, you do me an injustice.

"Hvorfor kunne hun ikke lige så godt klart og tydeligt sige, at jeg skulle gå min vej? spurgte jeg. Jo, jo, hvorfor ikke? Hun skulle endelig ikke tage hensyn til mig. I stedet for at minde mig om, at pigen snart skulle komme hjem, kunne hun simpelthen have sagt følgende: Nu må De se at komme væk, for nu skal jeg hen og hente min mor, og jeg vil ikke have, at De følger med mig ned ad gaden. Nå, det var ikke det, hun havde tænkt? Ak jo, det var nok alligevel det, hun havde tænkt, det forstod jeg med det samme. Der skulle så lidt til, for at jeg forstod en hentydning; bare den måde hun havde grebet ud efter kåben på og igen ladet den blive liggende, havde overbevist mig med det samme.

Well, that was not what she had thought? Alas, that was probably what she was thinking anyway, I understood that right away. It took so little for me to understand a hint; just the way she had reached for the robe and left it lying there had convinced me immediately. Like I said, I had a hard time getting sensations.

Now, wasn't that what she was thinking? Oh yes, that is what she was thinking anyway , I understood it right away.

"Jeg så ud i luften. Netop det at det var så umuligt at trænge ind i denne mystiske sag, gjorde mig forstyrret af nysgerrighed. Jeg ledte i mine lommer efter noget at give manden for at komme i snak med ham, og jeg fik fat i min barberbog, men gemte den igen. Pludselig fik jeg den idé at være yderst fræk, jeg klappede mig på min tomme brystlomme og sagde:","I looked into the air.

It disappointed me a bit, I was expecting to see him get misled by my inventions.","""I'm not really surprised,"" the man replied calmly. That was all he said: he believed every word I had spoken and did not fall over with amazement.

"Hvor var det dog gået jævnt og sikkert ned ad bakke for mig! Jeg stod til sidst fuldstændig ribbet for alt, jeg havde ikke engang en kam tilbage eller en bog at læse i, når det blev for trist for mig. Hele sommeren havde jeg søgt ud på kirkegårdene eller op i Slotsparken, hvor jeg sad og skrev artikler til bladene, spalte efter spalte om de mest forskellige ting, underlige påhit, idéer, indfald fra min urolige hjerne; af ren og skær fortvivlelse havde jeg tit valgt de mest fremmedartede emner, som tog mig lang tid og store anstrengelser og aldrig blev antaget. Når en artikel var færdig, gik jeg i gang med en ny, og tit lod jeg ikke redaktørernes nej slå mig ud; jeg blev ved med at sige til mig selv, at engang ville det nok lykkes. Og sandt nok, nu og da når jeg havde held med mig og fik lavet noget der var godt, kunne jeg få fem kroner for en eftermiddags arbejde.","How had it gone smoothly and safely downhill for me though! I ended up completely ribbed for everything I didn’t even have a comb left or a book to read in when it got too sad for me. All summer I had searched in the cemeteries or up in Slotsparken, where I sat and wrote articles for the magazines, column after column about the most different things, strange inventions, ideas, whims from my restless brain; out of sheer despair I had often chosen the most foreign subjects, which took me a long time and great effort and was never accepted. When an article was finished, I embarked on a new one, and often I did not let the editors' no knock me out; I kept saying to myself that one day it would probably succeed. And true enough, now and then when I was lucky and got something done that was good, I could get five bucks for an afternoon job.","How steadily my predicament had gotten worse! By now I was so utterly denuded of objects that I didn't even have a comb left, or a book to read when I felt hopeless. I had spent the entire summer sitting in cemeteries or in the public gardens near the castle, writing articles intended for some newspaper: page after page on almost any subject, filled with odd ideas, inspirations, quirks rising from my restless brain. In desperation I would choose the most outré subjects; the pieces would cost me hours and hours of labor, and were never accepted. When a piece was done I plunged immediately into a new one, and therefore wasn't very often crushed by an editor's refusal; I told myself all the time that eventually my luck would turn. And in fact, sometimes when I had luck, and things were going my way, I could get five kroner for one afternoon's work.","How regularly and steadily things had gone downhill with me for a long time, till, in the end , I was so curiously bared of every conceivable thing. I had not even a comb left, not even a book to read, when things grew all too sad with me. All through the summer, up in the churchyards or parks, where I used to sit and write my articles for the newspapers, I had thought out column after column on the most miscellaneous subjects. Strange ideas, quaint fancies, conceits of my restless brain; in despair I had often chosen the most remote themes, that cost me long hours of intense effort, and never were accepted. When one piece was finished I set to work at another. I was not often discouraged by the editors' ""no. "" I used to tell myself constantly that some day I was bound to succeed; and really occasionally when I was in luck's way, and made a hit with something, I could get five shillings for an afternoon's work.","It had been going steadily downhill for me all along, and how!

"Uh, nu kommer pigen snart! sagde hun. Dette var det første, hun sagde.","Uh, now the girl is coming soon! she said.

"Pustet fuld af håb og tilfredshed, stadig optaget af min mærkelige skitse, som jeg hvert andet øjeblik hev op af lommen og læste i, ville jeg med det samme gøre alvor af det og gå i gang med flytningen. Jeg tog min bylt frem, et rødt lommetørklæde, der indeholdt et par rene flipper og noget sammenkrøllet avispapir, som jeg havde transporteret brød i, rullede mit sengetæppe sammen og stak min beholdning af hvidt skrivepapir i lommen. Derefter under-søgte jeg for en sikkerheds skyld alle hjørner for at sikre mig, at jeg ikke havde efterladt noget, og da jeg ikke fandt noget, gik jeg hen til vinduet og kiggede ud. Morgenstunden var mørk og våd; der var ingen til stede ovre ved den nedbrændte smedje, og tøjsnoren nede i gården stod stram fra væg til væg sammentrukket af væden. Jeg genkendte det hele fra tidligere, gik derfor væk fra vinduet, tog tæppet under armen, bukkede for fyrinspektørens bekendtgørelse, bukkede for jomfru Andersens ligsvøb og åbnede døren.","Breathed full of hope and satisfaction, still preoccupied with my strange sketch, which I every second moment lifted out of my pocket and read in, I would immediately take it seriously and embark on the move. I took out my bundle, a red handkerchief containing a pair of clean flip-flops and some crumpled newsprint in which I had transported bread, rolled up my bedspread, and tucked my stock of white writing paper into my pocket. Then, for safety's sake, I searched all the corners to make sure I had left nothing behind, and when I found nothing, I went to the window and looked out. The morning was dark and wet; there was no one present over by the burnt-down smithy, and the clothesline down in the yard stood tight from wall to wall contracted by the wet. I recognized it all from before, therefore walked away from the window, took the rug under my arm, bowed to the fire inspector's order, bowed to Virgin Andersen's shroud, and opened the door.","Borne up by hope and contentment, thinking all the time of my marvelous story, which I took out of my pocket every other minute to look at, I decided to get it over with right now and move. I took out my bundle, a red handkerchief which contained two clean collars and some crumpled newspaper which I had carried my bread home in, rolled it all together with my blanket, and added my store of white writing paper. Then, just to make sure, I looked in every corner to see that I hadn't left anything, and when nothing turned up, I walked to the window and looked out. The morning was dark and misty; no one had arrived yet at the burned-down smithy site and the clothesline down in the courtyard was stretched tight from wall to wall, shrunken by the mist. There was nothing new, so I turned away from the window, took the blanket under my arm, bowed to the Chief of Lighthouses' announcement, bowed to Miss Andersen's shroud, and opened the door.","Buoyed up by hope and satisfaction, constantly occupied with my remarkable sketch, which I drew forth every moment from my pocket and re-read, I determined to set seriously to work with my flitting. I took out my bundle, a red handkerchief that contained a few clean collars and some crumpled newspapers, in which I had occasionally carried home bread. I rolled my blanket up and pocketed my reserve white writing-paper. Then I ransacked every corner to assure myself that I had left nothing behind, and as I could not find anything, went over to the window and looked out. The morning was gloomy and wet; there was no one about at the burnt-out smithy, and the clothesline down in the yard stretched tightly from wall to wall shrunken by the wet. It was all familiar to me, so I stepped back from the window, took the blanket under my arm, and made a low bow to the lighthouse director's announcement, bowed again to Miss Andersen's winding-sheet advertisement, and opened the door.","Puffed up with hope and self-satisfaction and constantly absorbed by my interesting sketch, which I pulled out of my pocket to read every now and then, I decided to buckle down at once and get going with my move. I took out my bundle, a red handkerchief that contained a couple of clean collars and some crumpled newspapers I had carried my bread home in, rolled up my blanket and pocketed my stack of white writing paper. Then, to be on the safe side, I inspected every corner of the room to make sure I hadn’t forgotten anything, and when nothing turned up I went over to the window and looked out. The morning was wet and gloomy; no one had shown up at the burned-down blacksmith’s shop, and the clothesline down in the courtyard hung taut from wall to wall, shrunken by the wetness. I knew it all from before, so I stepped away from the window, took the blanket under my arm, bowed to the notice from the Director of Lighthouses, bowed to Madam Andersen’s shrouds, and opened the door."

"Jeg sad der på bænken og tænkte over alt dette og blev mere og mere bitter på Gud over hans vedholdende plagerier.

"Jeg gjorde et kast med hovedet, vendte mig væk fra „Jomfruen“ og kiggede ned ad gaden. Mit blik faldt på en rød kjole, der nærmede sig os, en kvinde ved siden af en mand. Hvis jeg ikke havde ført netop denne samtale med „Jomfruen“, hvis jeg ikke var blevet stødt af hans grove mistanke, og hvis jeg ikke havde gjort netop dette kast med hovedet og vendt mig fornærmet væk, ville denne røde kjole måske have passeret mig, uden at jeg havde lagt mærke til den.

I walk further out on the pier, find myself a crate to sit on and fold my hands, feeling my head getting more and more confused. I am quite motionless, not lifting a finger to tough it out any longer."

"Nej, overhovedet ikke, jeg kom for et lille stykke tid siden, svarede jeg. Og desuden, hvorfor skulle det have gjort noget, hvis jeg havde ventet længe? For resten tænkte jeg nok, at De ville komme fra en anden retning?","No, not at all, I came a little while ago, I replied. And besides, why should it have done anything if I had waited so long? By the way, I probably thought you would come from a different direction?","""No, not at all, I just came a moment ago,"" I answered. ""But nothing lost if I had. Do you know, I was positive that you would be coming from the other direction?""","""No, not at all; I only came a little while ago,"" I reply. "" And besides, would it matter if I had waited long?

Hvis jeg ville vente til efter klokken tolv, så kunne jeg måske få køkkenlampen. Hvorfor købte jeg mig ikke et lys?","But the madam had no lamp.

Why did I not buy myself a candle?","But the lady of the house had no lamp. She thought about it, but could not remember there being an extra lamp anywhere. If I wanted to wait until after midnight, maybe I could use the kitchen lamp. But why didn't I just buy a candle!","But madam had no lamp.

"Jeg forklarede, hvorfor jeg havde givet hende pengene, forklarede det dæmpet og eftertrykkeligt. Jeg plejede at gå frem på den måde, fordi jeg troede det bedste om alle mennesker.

"Hvad for noget? råbte jeg, lys frakke? Er De ikke rigtig klog? Tror De, det er en tekop jeg leder efter? Denne lyse frakke kom meget ubelejligt for mig og ødelagde manden for mig, som jeg havde forestillet mig ham.","What kind of thing? I shouted, light coat? Are you not really smart? Do you think this is a teacup I'm looking for? This light coat came very inconvenient to me and ruined the man for me as I had imagined him.","""What was that?"" I shouted. "" Light-colored coat?

"Vi begyndte at le og fjante, vi talte i et køre hele tiden, jeg vidste ikke, hvad jeg sagde, jeg var glad. Hun fortalte, at hun havde set mig en gang tidligere, for længe siden i teatret.

"Ja, svarer jeg uvilkårligt og sprang op og ledte mine lommer igennem. Men barnet tror, at jeg bare vil gøre nar af hende og fjerner sig straks uden at sige et ord. Denne stumme beskedenhed var for meget for mig; hvis hun havde skældt mig ud, ville det have føltes mere velkomment; smerten greb mig, og jeg kaldte hende tilbage.

I answered mechanically, and leaped up, rummaging in my pocket. The child, however, thought I was only mocking her, and backed off without saying a word.

Yes, that is a pretty name; I won't forget it. Till tomorrow, then....""","“Sure,” I answer automatically, jumping up and rummaging through my pockets.

"Hæ-hæ, sådan skulle man behandle svinene! Med den mest udsøgte uforskammethed! Det imponerede svinene, satte en skræk i svinene ... Jeg følte mig særdeles tilfreds med mig selv og gav mig igen til at synge en stump af en sang. Anspændt af ophidselse, uden at føle smerte længere, endda uden at føle nogen form for ubehag, gik jeg let som en fjer hen ad hele torvet, drejede op ved basarerne og slog mig ned på en bænk ved Vor Frelsers.","Ha-ha, that's how you should treat the pigs! With the most exquisite rudeness! It impressed the pigs, put a fright in the pigs ... I felt extremely happy with myself and again gave myself to singing a stump of a song.

With the most well-bred insolence! That impresses these animals, that puts the fear of God in them. . . . I was unusually pleased with myself and sang a few bars. Giddy with excitement, feeling no pain at all any more, feeling nothing at all unpleasant, I walked on, light as a feather, floated all around the market, curved around by the booths, and sat down on a bench near the Church of Our Saviour.","Ha, ha! That is the way to treat brutes! With the most refined effrontery! That impresses the brutes--puts the fear of God into them.... I was peculiarly satisfied with myself, and began to sing a little strain. Every nerve was tense with excitement. Without feeling any more pain, without even being conscious of discomfort of any kind, I walked, light as a feather, across the whole market, turned round at the stalls, and came to a halt--sat down on a bench near Our Saviour's Church.","Heh-heh, that’s the way to treat those brutes! With the most refined impudence! That impressed the brutes, gave them a fright. . . . I was extremely pleased with myself and began again to sing a snatch of song.

"Jeg kiggede mig omkring i det lille kontor; buster, litografier, udklip, en umådelig stor papirkurv, der så ud til at kunne sluge en mand med hud og hår.

"Hun boede oppe på St. Olavs Plads, ret så ensomt, sammen med sin mama, som man slet ikke kunne snakke med, fordi hun var så tunghør.

"Så kan jeg høre skridt på trapperne.

"Jeg var faldet i søvn der, hvor jeg lå, og blev vækket af betjenten. Der sad jeg så, ubarmhjertigt kaldt tilbage til livet og elendigheden. Min første følelse var en idiotisk forbavselse over at finde mig selv ude under åben himmel, men snart blev den afløst af et bittert mismod; jeg var lige ved at græde af sorg over stadig at være i live. Det havde regnet, mens jeg sov, mit tøj var fuldstændig gennemblødt, og jeg følte en rå kulde i kroppen. Mørket var blevet endnu mere tæt, det var kun med besvær, at jeg kunne ane betjentens ansigtstræk foran mig.","I had fallen asleep where I was lying, and was awakened by the officer. There I sat then, relentlessly called back to life and misery.

"En politibetjent står nogle skridt væk og iagttager mig; han står midt ude på gaden og lægger ikke mærke til andet end mig. Da jeg slår hovedet op, mødes vores øjne; måske havde han stået der i længere tid og bare kigget på mig. Jeg tager min hat op, sætter den på hovedet og går hen til manden.","A police officer stands a few steps away and watches me; he stands in the middle of the street and notices anything but me.

"Der blev nok alligevel ingen anden løsning end at gå ud i skoven et sted. Hvis jorden bare ikke havde været så fugtig! Jeg klappede på mit tæppe og følte mig mere og mere fortrolig med tanken om, at jeg skulle ligge ude. Nu havde jeg plaget mig selv så længe med at finde et logi i byen, at jeg var led og ked af det hele; det ville blive en behagelig nydelse at slå mig til tåls, lade stå til og drive hen ad gaden uden en tanke i hovedet. Jeg gik over til Universitetsuret og så, at klokken var over ti, derfra fulgte jeg vejen op gennem byen. Et sted på Hegdehaugen stod jeg stille uden for en kolonialhandel, hvor der var udstillet noget mad i vinduet. Der lå en kat og sov ved siden af et rundt franskbrød, lige bag ved den stod der en skål svinefedt og flere glas med gryn. Jeg blev stående et stykke tid og kiggede på disse madvarer, men da jeg ikke havde noget at handle for, vendte jeg mig bort fra dem og fortsatte marchen. Jeg gik meget langsomt, kom forbi Majorstuen, gik videre, hele tiden videre, gik time efter time og kom endelig ud i Bogstadskoven.","There was probably still no other solution than to go out into the woods somewhere. If only the soil had not been so moist! I patted my rug and felt more and more comfortable with the thought of having to lie out. Now I had tormented myself so long in finding a lodging in the city that I was saddened by it all; it would be a pleasant pleasure to beat myself up, let go, and drive down the street without a thought in my head. I went over to the University Clock and saw that it was over ten o'clock, from there I followed the road up through the city. Somewhere on Hegdehaugen I stood still outside a grocery store, where some food was on display in the window. There was a cat sleeping next to a round loaf of French bread, just behind it stood a bowl of lard and several glasses of groats. I stood for a while looking at these foods, but when I had nothing to shop for, I turned away from them and continued the march. I walked very slowly, came past Majorstuen, went on, all the time on, went hour after hour and finally came out in Bogstadskoven.","So there was no way out of it then but to find some place out in the woods. If only the ground hadn't been so damp! I patted my blanket and felt more and more relieved at the thought of sleeping out. I had spent so much time looking for a room in the city that I was sick and tired of the whole thing. I felt a delicious pleasure in letting it all go, just relaxing and floating along the street without a worry in my head. I walked to the clock at the university, saw that it was after ten, and from there I headed north. I stopped once on Haegdehaugen Street outside a grocery store that had some food displayed in the window. A cat lay there asleep beside a French loaf, just behind it was a bowl of lard and several jars of meal. I stood for a while looking at these groceries, but since I had nothing to buy them with, I turned away and pushed on. I walked very slowly, finally passed Majorstuen, walked on and on, walked for hours, and at last got out to the Bogstad Woods.","So there was no way out of it but to seek some place out in the woods. If only the fields were not so damp. I patted my blanket, and felt more and more at home at the thought of sleeping out. I had worried myself so long trying to find a shelter in town that I was wearied and bored with the whole affair. It would be a positive pleasure to get to rest, to resign myself; so I loaf down the street without thought in my head. At a place in Haegdehaugen I halted outside a provision shop where some food was displayed in the window. A cat lay there and slept beside a round French roll. There was a basin of lard and several basins of meal in the background. I stood a while and gazed at these eatables; but as I had no money wherewith to buy, I turned quickly away and continued my tramp. I went very slowly, passed by Majorstuen, went on, always on--it seemed to me for hours,--and came at length at Bogstad's wood.","Apparently there was no alternative but to go out into the woods somewhere. If only the ground hadn’t been so damp! I patted my blanket and felt more and more reconciled to the idea of sleeping under the open sky. I had taken such pains, for such a long time, to find a lodging in town that I was sick and tired of the whole thing. It gave me a sweet sense of pleasure to take it easy, resign myself and drift along the street without a thought in my head. I dropped by the University clock and could see it was after ten, and from there I headed uptown. Someplace in the Hægdehaugen area I stopped outside a grocery store where some food was displayed in the window. A cat lay asleep beside a round loaf of white bread, and just behind it was a bowl of lard and several jars of grits. I stood eyeing these eatables awhile, but since I didn’t have anything to buy with I turned away from them and continued my tramp. I walked very slowly, passed Majorstuen, continued onward, always onward, walked for hours, and finally got out to the Bogstad Woods."

"Det var besynderligt hvor stærkt hun strittede imod, alt for stærkt til at det bare var på grund af blufærdighed. Jeg kom til at vælte lyset, så det gik ud, hun gjorde fortvivlet modstand, udstødte endda et lille klynk.","It was strange how strongly she resisted, far too strongly that it was just because of embarrassment. I came to topple the light so it went out, she made desperate resistance, uttered even a small whimper.","She struggled rather hard, too hard to be struggling only from modesty. I knocked the candle over accidentally, so it went out. She made desperate opposition, and even gave out a little whimper.","I happened, as if inadvertently, to knock over the light, so that it went out. She made a despairing struggle--gave vent at last to a little whimper.","She fought me off vigorously, oddly enough, far too vigorously simply to arise from bashfulness.

"Hvis man nu bare havde haft penge til lidt mad på sådan en lys dag! Indtrykket af den glade morgen overvældede mig, jeg blev uregerligt tilfreds og gav mig til at nynne af glæde uden nogen bestemt grund. Uden for en slagterbutik stod en kone med en kurv på armen og spekulerede på pølser til middagen; idet jeg passerede hende, kiggede hun på mig. Hun havde kun én tand foran i undermunden. Nervøs og letpåvirkelig som jeg var blevet de sidste dage, gjorde konens ansigt straks et modbydeligt indtryk på mig; den lange gule tand så ud som en lille finger, der stod op fra kæben, og hendes blik var stadig fuldt af pølse, da hun rettede det mod mig. Jeg mistede med det samme appetitten og fik kvalme. Da jeg kom til handelstorvet, gik jeg hen til vandposten og drak lidt vand; jeg kiggede op – klokken var ti i Vor Frelsers tårn.","If only you had just had money for some food on such a bright day! The impression of the happy morning overwhelmed me, I became uncontrollably satisfied and gave myself to humming with joy for no particular reason. Outside a butcher shop, a wife stood with a basket on her arm, wondering about sausages for dinner; as I passed her, she looked at me. She had only one tooth in front of her lower mouth. Nervous and impressionable as I had become the last few days, the wife's face immediately made a disgusting impression on me; the long yellow tooth looked like a little finger rising from its jaw, and her gaze was still full of sausage as she aimed it at me. I immediately lost my appetite and got nauseous. When I got to the market square, I went to the water post and drank some water; I looked up — it was ten o'clock in Our Savior's tower.","If one only had something to eat, just a little, on such a clear day! The mood of the gay morning overwhelmed me, I became unusually serene, and started to hum for pure joy and for no particular reason. In front of a butcher's shop there was a woman with a basket on her arm, debating about some sausage for dinner; as I went past, she looked up at me. She had only a single tooth in the lower jaw. In the nervous and excitable state I was in, her face made an instant and revolting impression on me --the long yellow tooth looked like a finger sticking out of her jaw, and as she turned toward me, her eyes were still full of sausage. I lost my appetite instantly, and felt nauseated. When I came to the main market square, I went over to the fountain and drank a little water. I looked up: ten o'clock by the Church of Our Saviour.","If one only had just a little to eat on such a lightsome day! The sense of the glad morning overwhelmed me; my satisfaction became ill-regulated, and for no definite reason I began to hum joyfully. At a butcher's stall a woman stood speculating on sausage for dinner. As I passed her she looked up at me. She had but one tooth in the front of her head. I had become so nervous and easily affected in the last few days that the woman's face made a loathsome impression upon me. The long yellow snag looked like a little finger pointing out of her gum, and her gaze was still full of sausage as she turned it upon me. I immediately lost all appetite, and a feeling of nausea came over me. When I reached the market- place I went to the fountain and drank a little. I looked up; the dial marked ten on Our Saviour's tower.","If only one had a bite to eat on such a clear day! Overwhelmed by the impression of the happy morning, I experienced an irrepressible sense of well-being and started humming for joy for no particular reason. A woman with a basket on her arm stood outside a butcher shop pondering sausages for dinner; she glanced at me as I walked past. She had only a single tooth in the front of her mouth. Nervous and susceptible as I had become during the last few days, the woman’s face made a repellent impression on me right off; that long yellow tooth looked like a little finger sticking up from her jaw, and her eyes were still full of sausage as she turned toward me. I lost my appetite instantly and felt nauseated. When I reached the Arcades I went over to the fountain and drank some water. I looked up—the clock in the tower of Our Savior’s showed ten."
"Ja, da! svarer hun livligt. Pigen har også fået fri. Så jeg er fuldstændig alene hjemme.",Yes! she answers lively. The girl has also been released. So I'm completely alone at home.,"""Yes!"" she answered, gaily. "" The servant girl is off tonight too. So I am home all alone.""","""I see it's dark up in your windows.""

Run about the whole live-long day for a shilling, that would but keep life in me for a few hours longer.","Just why, then, had I been procrastinating?

"Men nu løber mine øjne pludselig fulde af vand over „Kommandantens“ venlighed, og jeg harker og hoster for at gøre mig stærk. „Kommandanten“ pruster en gang med næsen; han står og kigger på mig.","But now my eyes suddenly run full of water over the kindness of the ""Commander"", and I rake and cough to make myself strong.

"Jeg tav stadig. Ja, naturligvis ville „Hertugen“ trække af sted med hende! Godt for ham! Hvad kom det mig ved? Jeg gav pokker i hende og hendes yndigheder, pokker gav jeg! Og jeg forsøgte at trøste mig ved at tænke de værste tanker om hende, morede mig ligefrem med rigtigt at trække hende ned i sølet. Det ærgrede mig bare, at jeg havde løftet på hatten for parret, hvis jeg da virkelig havde gjort det. Hvorfor skulle jeg løfte på hatten for den slags mennesker? Jeg syntes ikke længere om hende, overhovedet ikke; hun var ikke længere det allermindste smuk, hun havde tabt sig, nej, for fanden, hvor hun dog var blegnet! Det kunne da godt være, at det kun var mig, hun havde kigget på; det undrede mig ikke; det var måske samvittigheden, der begyndte at indhente hende. Men jeg behøvede vel ikke af den grund at falde til patten og hilse som en nar, især ikke, når hun var falmet så betænkeligt i den sidste tid. „Hertugen“ kunne da bare beholde hende, velbekomme! Der kunne komme en dag, hvor jeg fik den idé at gå stolt forbi hende uden at kigge i den retning, hvor hun befandt sig. Det kunne ske, at jeg tillod mig selv at gøre dette, selv om hun gloede stift på mig og oven i købet gik i en blodrød kjole. Det kunne godt ske! Hæ-hæ, sikke en triumf det ville blive! Hvis jeg kendte mig selv ret, ville jeg være i stand til at færdiggøre mit drama i løbet af natten, og inden otte dage var gået, ville jeg have tvunget frøkenen ned i knæ. Sammen med hendes yndigheder, hæ-hæ, sammen med alle hendes yndigheder ...","I was still silent. Yes, of course ""The Duke"" would leave with her! Good for him! What did it occur to me? I gave a damn about her and her beauties, heck I gave! And I tried to comfort myself by thinking the worst thoughts about her, even amused myself by really pulling her down into the mud. It just annoyed me that I would have lifted the hat for the couple if I had really done so. Why should I lift my hat for that kind of people? I no longer liked her, not at all; she was no longer the slightest beauty she had lost, no, damn it, though she had faded! It could well be that it was only me she had looked at; it did not surprise me; it was perhaps the conscience that began to overtake her. But I guess for that reason I did not have to fall to the teat and greet like a fool, especially not when she had faded so worryingly lately. The ""Duke"" could then just keep her, welcome! There might come a day when I got the idea to walk proudly past her without looking in the direction where she was. It could happen that I allowed myself to do this, even though she glared stiffly at me and even walked in a blood-red dress. It could very well happen! Ha-ha, what a triumph it would be! If I knew myself right, I would be able to finish my drama during the night, and within eight days had passed, I would have forced the young lady down to her knees. Along with her pleasures, ha-ha, along with all her pleasures ...","I still remained silent. Yes, ""The Duke"" would obviously make the grade with her! So be it! What did that have to do with me? I said goodbye to her and all her charms: goodbye! I attempted to console myself by imagining the worst possible things about her, I took a positive pleasure in dragging her through the mud. The only thing that annoyed me was my taking off my hat to the couple, if I had really done it. Why should I tip my hat to people like that? She meant nothing to me any more, nothing at all. She wasn't even the slightest bit beautiful to me, she had lost all her beauty, frightful, how ugly she had become! It wasn't out of the question that she had looked only at me --that wouldn't surprise me: she was probably feeling remorse now. But that didn't mean that I had to fall down at her feet, and bow and scrape like a fool, especially when she had clearly lost so much of her good looks lately. "" The Duke"" could have her then, and good riddance! Perhaps one day I would simply walk proudly right past her without even glancing in her direction. It wasn't impossible that I might do that even if she were to look straight at me, and what's more even if her dress were absolutely blood red! That could very easily happen! Yes, that would be a triumph! If I knew anything about anything, I would finish my play this very night, and within eight days I would bring that girl to her knees. Charms and all, yes, even with all her charms.","I still kept silent. Yes, of course ""the Duke"" would make the pace with her. Well, what odds? How did it concern me? I bade her good-day with all her wiles: a good-day I bade her; and I tried to console myself by thinking the worst thoughts about her; took a downright pleasure in dragging her through the mire. It only annoyed me to think that I had doffed my hat to the pair, if I really had done so. Why should I raise my hat to such people? I did not care for her any longer, certainly not; she was no longer in the very slightest degree lovely to me; she had fallen off. Ah, the devil knows how soiled I found her! It might easily have been the case that it was only me she looked at; I was not in the least astounded at that; it might be regret that began to stir in her. But that was no reason for me to go and lower myself and salute, like a fool, especially when she had become so seriously besmirched of late. "" The Duke"" was welcome to her; I wish him joy! The day might come when I would just take into my head to pass her haughtily by without glancing once towards her. Ay, it might happen that I would venture to do this, even if she were to gaze straight into my eyes, and have a blood-red gown on into the bargain. It might very easily happen! Ha, ha! that would be a triumph. If I knew myself aright, I was quite capable of completing my drama during the course of the night, and, before eight days had flown, I would have brought this young woman to her knees--with all her charms, ha, ha! with all her charms....","I was still silent. Yes, the “Duke” would walk off with her, of course! Well and good! What business was it of mine? I didn’t give a hang about her, or about all her charms, not a hang! And I tried to comfort myself by thinking the worst possible things about her, took downright pleasure in rolling her in the mud. The only thing that annoyed me was that I had taken my hat off to the pair—if, indeed, I had done so. Why should I take my hat off to such people? I no longer cared for her, not at all; she wasn’t the least attractive anymore, she had lost her good looks—holy smoke, how she had faded! It might very well be she had looked only at me; it wouldn’t surprise me, perhaps remorse was beginning to gnaw at her. But that was no reason why I had to go down on my knees and bow to her like a fool, especially since she had faded so suspiciously lately. The “Duke” was quite welcome to keep her, much good might she do him! A day might come when I would take it into my head to walk proudly past her, without even glancing in her direction. I might venture to do this even if she looked hard at me, and was wearing a blood-red dress to boot! I might do it, all right. Ha-ha, what a triumph that would be! If I knew myself at all, I would be able to finish my play in the course of the night, and within a week I would have brought the young lady to her knees. With her charms and all, heh-heh, with all her charms."
"Jeg stod uden for en skomagerbutik nederst i Karl Johan, næsten nede ved Jernbanetorvet. Gud ved, hvorfor jeg netop var stoppet op uden for denne skomagerbutik!

"Jeg sad og fablede med disse fornemmelser en lang stund, måske en hel time.

Hun havde altså troet, at jeg var en af dem der gik rundt i gaderne om aftenen og kaprede småpiger? Havde hun virkelig så dårlige tanker om mig?

Maybe I had said something naughty to her in the beginning? Did you behave like me when you were in pain? In short, I had addressed her and followed her a few steps to see how far she would push it.

Did she really think something that bad about me? Had I ever said anything improper to her up to now? Did people who had evil ideas in mind behave as I did? The fact was I had addressed her and walked a few steps with her just to see how far she would allow it to go. My name, by the way, was such and such, Pastor such and such. Good night! Go and sin no more!","""What is your name?"" I inquired. "" Mary, eh? Well, listen to me now, Mary!"" and I set about explaining my behaviour. The girl grew more and more astonished in measure as I proceeded. Had she then believed that I, too, was one of those who went about the street at night and ran after little girls? Did she really think so badly of me? Had I perhaps said anything rude to her from the beginning? Did one behave as I had done when one was actuated by any bad motive? Briefly, in so many words, I had accosted her, and accompanied her those few paces, to see how far she would go on with it. For the rest, my name was So-and-so-- Pastor So-and-so.

I worked, too, for the space of an hour without getting tired.","My gaiety kept rising as I paced the floor talking to myself; I laughed aloud and felt mighty glad. It really looked as though all I needed was this brief happy hour, this moment of truly carefree delight without a worry on the horizon, to get my head in working order.

It didn’t go fast, but I thought the little I accomplished was altogether first-rate. Also, I worked for about an hour without getting tired."
"Jeg var over det værste også denne gang, jeg havde mad hver dag, optimismen steg, og jeg stak det ene jern efter det andet i ilden. Jeg havde tre eller fire afhandlinger under udarbejdning, der plyndrede min fattige hjerne for hver eneste gnist, for hver eneste tanke, der opstod i den, og jeg syntes, det gik bedre end tidligere. Den sidste artikel, som havde kostet mig så meget besvær, og som jeg havde haft så store forhåbninger til, havde jeg allerede fået leveret tilbage af redaktøren, og jeg havde tilintetgjort den med det samme, vred, fornærmet, uden at læse den igennem igen. Fremover ville jeg prøve med et andet blad for at åbne flere veje. I værste fald, hvis heller ikke det hjalp, havde jeg skibene jeg kunne ty til; Nonnen lå klar til at sejle nede ved kajen, og jeg kunne måske få arbejdet mig af sted på den til Arkhangelsk, eller hvor det nu var den skulle hen. Så jeg havde nok af fremtidsudsigter til flere sider.","I was over the worst too this time, I had food every day, optimism rose and I stuck one iron after another in the fire. I had three or four dissertations under preparation that plundered my poor brain for every single spark, for every single thought that arose in it, and I thought it went better than before. The last article, which had cost me so much trouble, and for which I had had high hopes, had already been delivered back by the editor, and I had destroyed it at once, angry, offended, without reading it again. . Going forward, I would try with a different magazine to open more avenues. At worst, if that didn't help either, I had the ships I could resort to; The nun was ready to sail down by the quay, and I might be able to work my way up it to Arkhangelsk, or wherever it was going. So I had plenty of future prospects for several sides.","I was over the worst this time again, I had food every day, my spirits rose, and I pushed one iron after the other into the fire.

The last article, in which I had put so much stock, for which I had so much hope, had akeady been returned by the editor. I tore it up immediately, angry and insulted, without even reading it over. I intended, in the future, to try another newspaper also, so as to have several outlets. In the last resort, if everything failed, I always had the ships to turn to. The Nun was lying off the pier ready to sail, and I could probably sign on to go to Archangel or wherever the ship was going at the moment. So there was no lack of possibilities on many sides.","I had got over the worst this time, too. I had had food every day, and my courage rose, and I thrust one iron after the other into the fire.

The theft rushed in upon me in all its details. I saw the little shop, the counter, my lean hands as I seized the money, and I pictured to myself the line of action the police would adopt when they would come to arrest me.
