"Nei, svarte hun og så forundret ut; nei jeg angrer ikke på det; hvorledes faller De på det? Nei det var en morsom natt, syntes jeg, skjønt herregud hvor jeg hele tiden var redd for den «lyktemannen» som De fortalte om. Jeg har også drømt om ham siden. En fryktelig drøm!","No, she replied, looking puzzled; no I do not regret it; how do you feel about it? No, it was a fun night, I thought, though my God, I was always scared of the ""lantern man"" you told me about. I've also dreamed of him since. A terrible dream!","“No,” she said, looking surprised. “I don’t regret it. What would make you say a thing like that? On the contrary, it was a very interesting evening, though I was terrified by that story you told me about the lantern man. I even dreamed about him—it was ghastly!”","“No,” she replied, looking surprised, “no, I don’t regret it. What makes you think that? It was an enjoyable night, I thought, though God knows I was scared stiff when you told me about that Jack-o’-Lantern. I’ve even dreamed about him. A terrible dream!”"
"Hvorfor jeg bad Dem om det stevnemøte? Frøken Kielland, vil De ikke heller at jeg skal spare Dem for å forklare det? Jeg har bragt Dem så mange ubehageligheter før. Jeg angrer på det, og ved Gud jeg ville gjøre hva det skulle være for å ha det ugjort. Men hvorfor jeg dengang bad Dem om et møte, det forstår De nok, jeg har ikke lagt skjul på det skjønt jeg burde ha gjort det. De må vise meg nåde. Jeg kan ikke si noe mere ….","Why did I ask you for that date? Miss Kielland, do not you also want me to spare you to explain it? I've brought you so many inconveniences before.

They must show me mercy. I can not say anything more….","he answered calmly: “Why did I ask you to meet me? Miss Kielland, wouldn’t you really prefer me not to explain?

Miss Kielland, wouldn’t you rather I spare you the explanation? I have caused you enough trouble as it is. I’m sorry about that, and God knows I would do anything to have it undone.

"De blir så stille? La nu bare ikke mitt skryt om min forstand på mennesker sette Dem fluer i hodet så De ikke tør røre Dem. Hehehe, jo det skulle se nett ut! Men nu glemte jeg det jeg ville ha sagt. Jaja, så sier jeg noe annet som ikke ligger meg på hjerte, men som jeg sier allikevel inntil jeg husker det andre som jeg glemte. Gud, hvor jeg vrøvler! Hva mener De om frøken Kielland? La meg høre Deres mening om henne. Min mening er den at frøken Kielland er i den grad en kokette at det i grunnen ville glede henne riktig vilt om også andre, helst så mange som mulig – meg selv iberegnet – gikk hen og tok livet av seg for hennes skyld. Det er min mening. Hun er deilig, ja det er hun, og det måtte være en søt smerte å føle seg trampet ned av hennes hæl, ja og derfor kommer jeg kanskje også til å be henne derom engang, det vil jeg ikke forsverge. Det foreligger forøvrig ikke ennu, jeg har tiden for meg …. Men Gud bevare meg hvor jeg visstnok skremmer Dem stiv med min tale iaften! Har jeg såret Dem, jeg mener Dem personlig?","They get so quiet? Now just do not let my boasting about my understanding of people put flies in your head so you do not dare to touch. Hehehe, yes it should look nice! But now I forgot what I wanted to say. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. God, where I'm rubbish! What do you think of Miss Kielland? Let me hear your opinion of her. My opinion is that Miss Kielland is so coquettish that it would basically make her really happy if others, preferably as many as possible - myself included - went and took their own lives for her sake. That is my opinion. She is lovely, yes she is, and it must be a sweet pain to feel trampled down by her heel, yes and therefore I may also ask her about it someday, I will not swear. By the way, it does not exist yet, I have the time for me…. But God save me where I supposedly scare you stiff with my speech tonight! Have I hurt you, I mean you personally?","Nagel drank some more wine and went on talking: “Why are you being so quiet? Don’t let my sounding off about how good a judge of character I am frighten you. Then I would really have made a mess of things! But again I’ve forgotten what I was about to say. Well, I’ll go on talking until it comes back to me. Good God, how I rattle on! Tell me, what do you think of Miss Kielland? I’d very much like to know. In my opinion, Miss Kielland is such a flirt that she would be extremely flattered if more men—the more the better—myself included, would lay down their lives for her sake. Anyway, that’s my impression. She is a lovely creature, and it must be an exquisite pain to be trampled on by her—perhaps I’ll even ask her to do it to me one day—by God, that’s an experience I’d like to have! Not now, though; I’m biding my time. But I’m scaring you out of your wits with my ranting tonight! Have I said something to offend you—personally, I mean?”","“You’ve become so quiet. Don’t let my brag about being a good judge of people turn your head so that you’re afraid to move. Heh-heh-heh, that would look nice, wouldn’t it? But now I’ve forgotten what I wanted to say. Oh well, I’ll just say something else, something that doesn’t concern me deeply but that I’ll say anyway, until I recall what I’ve forgotten. Good Lord, how I go on! What’s your opinion of Miss Kielland? Let me hear what you think of her. In my opinion, Miss Kielland is such an out-and-out flirt that she would be enormously pleased if others, too, preferably as many as possible—myself Included—went and took their own lives for her sake. That’s my opinion. She’s lovely, she most certainly is, and it must be a sweet pain, indeed, to feel trampled by her heel; one day, perhaps, I’ll ask her to do just that, I cannot promise I won’t. However, that’s not for now, I have plenty of time.... But good heavens, I believe I’m scaring you stiff with my talk tonight! Have I offended you, I mean personally?”"

"Hun var beveget, hennes munn dirret og hun anstrengte seg sterkt for ikke å briste i gråt. Da Nagel tidde la hun ennu til:","She was moved, her mouth trembling and she made a strong effort not to burst into tears. When Nagel was silent, she added:","She was very upset; her lips trembled and she was obviously trying to hold back her tears.

When Nagel remained silent she added, “You’re welcome to walk me home, all the way home, if you like, as long as you won’t make it uncomfortable for both of us."

"Da han var kommet til den siste brygge og hadde drevet noen ganger opp og ned over den øde kai steg han uten å tenke over det oppover bakken og begav seg inn i skogen. Han gikk i godt og vel en halv time, bestandig lenger og lenger inn i skogen, og stanset endelig på en liten sti. Alt var stille, ikke engang en småfugl var å se, og på himmelen var det ikke en sky. Han trakk seg enda noen skritt avsides, fant seg en tørr plett og la seg på ryggen i hele sin lengde. Tilhøyre hadde han prestegården, tilvenstre byen og ovenover seg det uendelige hav av blå himmel.","When he had reached the last pier and had driven a few times up and down the deserted quay, he rose without thinking about it up the hill and went into the woods. He walked for well over half an hour, constantly further and further into the forest, and finally stopped on a small path. Everything was quiet, not even a small bird was to be seen, and in the sky there was not a cloud. He took a few more steps aside, found a dry spot and lay on his back the entire length. To his right was the rectory, to his left the city and above him the endless sea of blue skies.","When he came to the last pier, which was deserted, he strolled up and down several times and then walked up the hill and without thinking headed toward the woods. He walked for a half hour or so, getting deeper and deeper into the woods, and at last came to a halt at a narrow path. There wasn’t a sound; there wasn’t even a bird to be heard, and not a cloud in the sky. He walked a few steps off the path, found a dry spot, and lay down on his back. To the right was the parsonage, to the left the town, and above, an endless sea of blue sky.","After reaching the last pier and wandering up and down the deserted jetty a few times, he walked unthinkingly up the hill and entered the forest.

Nagel gikk straks opp i hotellet hvor han la seg fullt påkledd på sin seng og sov i ett trekk tungt og rolig til bortimot kveld.,Nagel immediately went up to the hotel where he lay fully clothed on his bed and slept in one move heavy and calm until almost evening.,Nagel went back to the hotel and without removing his clothes lay down and slept until evening.,"Nagel went straight to the hotel, where he lay down on his bed fully dressed and slept soundly and quietly at a stretch until toward evening."
Begynnelsen er den at da dampskipet la til kaien ved sekstiden om kvelden viste det seg på dekket to tre reisende hvoriblant en mann i en avstikkende gul drakt og med en vid fløyels lue. Dette var om kvelden den 12te juni; for det flaggedes den dag på mange steder i byen i anledning av frøken Kiellands forlovelse som just ble bekjentgjort den 12te juni. Budet fra Central hotell steg straks ombord og mannen i den gule kledning overgav ham da sitt tøy; han leverte også med det samme sin billett til en av styrmennene; men derpå gav han seg til å drive opp og ned over dekket uten å gå iland. Han lot til å være i sterk bevegelse. Da dampskipet ringte for tredje gang hadde han ikke engang betalt sin regning til restauratøren.,"The beginning is that when the steamship docked at six o'clock in the evening, two or three passengers appeared on deck, including a man in a detached yellow suit and with a wide velvet hat. This was on the evening of the 12th of June; for it was flagged that day in many places in the city on the occasion of Miss Kielland's engagement which was just announced on the 12th of June. The courier from Central Hotel immediately boarded and the man in the yellow robe then handed him his clothes; he also immediately delivered his ticket to one of the helmsmen; but then he began to drift up and down the deck without landing. He seemed to be in strong motion. When the steamship called for the third time, he had not even paid his bill to the restaurateur.","It all started at six one evening when a steamer landed at the dock and three passengers appeared on deck. One of them was a man wearing a loud yellow suit and an outsized corduroy cap. It was the evening of the twelfth of June; flags were flying all over town in honor of Miss Kielland’s engagement, which had been announced that day. The porter from the Central Hotel went aboard and the man in the yellow suit handed him his baggage. At the same time he surrendered his ticket to one of the ship’s officers, but made no move to go ashore, and began pacing up and down the deck. He seemed extremely agitated, and when the ship’s bell rang the third time, he hadn’t even paid the steward his bill.","When the steamer docked around six o’clock in the evening, there appeared on deck two or three passengers, including a man wearing a loud yellow suit and a wide velvet cap.

"Jeg møtte fullmektigen, sa han, og han fortrakk ikke en mine, men spurte meg endog hvem jeg hadde fått frakken av. Så snedig var han til å stille meg på prøve.","I met the agent, he said, and he did not prefer a mine, but even asked me who I had gotten my coat from. He was so cunning as to put me to the test.","“I met Deputy Reinert,” he said. “He asked me point-blank who had given me the coat. He’s a sly one—he just wanted to test me.”","“I ran across the deputy,” he said, “and he didn’t move a muscle; he even asked me who had given me the coat. He was so wily, to put me to the test that way.”"

"Riktig, sier fullmektigen, De var full dengang, det medgir jeg. Hvorfor sitter De forresten og plaprer ut med dette i alle disse folks påhør? Det er mere enn jeg ville ha gjort.","Right, says the clerk, You were drunk then, I admit. By the way, why are you sitting and blabbering on with this in the audience of all these people? That's more than I would have done.","“That’s right,” said the deputy. “I admit that you were drunk at the time. But why do you sit there blabbering about it in the presence of all these people? That’s a stupid thing to do.”","“Right,” says the deputy. “You were drunk at the time, I admit that. Anyway, why are you blabbering about this in front of all these people?

"Det selsomme barn av en gammel pike! For et ord, en halv ytring blusset hennes hjerte opp og henrev henne til ømhet, til smil. Hun holdt ham i hånden like til han gikk, fulgte ham til døren og holdt ham enda i hånden. Ved trappen sa hun meget høyt godnatt til ham som om det kunne være noen i nærheten hun ville trosse.","The strange child of an old girl! For a word, a half utterance flared up her heart and ravaged her to tenderness, to smile. She held his hand until he left, followed him to the door and still held his hand. At the stairs she said very good night to him as if there might be someone nearby she wanted to defy.","What a strange blending of a child’s soul with that of a spinster! A single remark, a single word made her heart leap with joy, made her smile, moved her to tenderness. She held his hand until he got up to leave, and walked him to the door, still holding his hand. On the doorstep she said good night loudly, as if to defy anyone who might be within earshot.","What a queer child of an old maid!

"All den nervøse opphisselse han hadde vært i hele dagen gjorde ham tilsist ganske kjed av det hele. Han gav i grunnen altsammen fan!

Nå, men like så lite hadde han å bestille med velaktet jomfru Martha Gude hersteds.","All the nervous excitement he had been in all day made him quite sad at last. He basically gave it all a fan! What did it matter to him that God the Lord made a clash with the loss of human life on the Erieban deep in America? No, of course! Now, but just as little he had to order with the well-respected virgin Martha Gude here.","He had been in a state of nervous tension all day and was thoroughly sick of the whole business.

"Nagel slo albumet hurtig i, så ut i stuen og fikk et nesten redd uttrykk. Var det spill eller oppriktighet?

"Hun mønstrer oss begge et øyeblikk, bøyer så hodet dypt for meg og går bort til den lille mann. Hun gir seg uten å si et ord til å knappe hans klær opp og føle omkring på hans kropp som om hun leter efter noe, og litt efter trekker hun frem fra foret i hans kappe et brennende bluss, en liten vilt lysende lykt som hun henger på fingeren. Lykten skinnet så stridt at den fullstendig overstrålte lampen borte på muren. Mannen stod aldeles stille og lo like tyst mens han ble ransaket. Godnatt! sa kvinnen og pekte på en dør, og mannen, dette fryktelige, selsomme halvdyr, gikk. Jeg stod alene tilbake med en ny person.","She musts us both for a moment, then bows her head deeply to me and walks over to the little man. She says without saying a word to unbutton his clothes and feel around his body as if she is looking for something, and a little later she pulls out from the lining of his cloak a burning flame, a small wildly shining lantern which she hangs on the finger. The lantern shone so brightly that the completely radiant lamp was gone on the wall. The man stood perfectly still and laughed just as quietly as he was searched. Good night! said the woman, pointing to a door, and the man, this dreadful, strange half-animal, left. I was left alone with a new person.","“She looked at us both; then bowing to me, she walked up to the little man.

The man was standing absolutely still and laughed silently as before, while being searched. ‘Good night,’ said the woman, pointing to the door, and this strange, terrifying being, who was half man, half monster, left.

"Sannheten er den, svarte han, at det var meget uriktig av meg å fornærme fullmektigen. Men jeg er aldeles viss på at det blir godt igjen når jeg får talt med ham engang. Jeg er litt hastig, litt drøy, det hele kom av at han skubbet til meg idet han kom inn gjennom en dør. En bagatell altså, en uaktsomhet fra hans side; men jeg springer straks opp som en dåre og gir ham et par klengenavn, truer ham med en seidel under nesen og setter en bule i hans hatt. Så gikk han jo; som dannet menneske måtte han gå sin vei. Men bakefter angret jeg min oppførsel jeg også og jeg har bestemt meg til å gjøre det godt igjen. Naturligvis, litt kunne jo også jeg være å unnskylde, jeg var nervøs den dag og hadde hatt et par ergrelser. Men det vet jo ingen om, slikt noe kan man ikke fortelle, og så får jeg heller ta hele skylden.","The truth is, he replied, that it was very wrong of me to insult the attorney. But I'm pretty sure it's going to be okay when I talk to him someday. I'm a little hasty, a little overweight, it all came from him pushing me as he came in through a door. A trifle, then, a negligence on his part; but I immediately run up like a fool and give him a few nicknames, threaten him with a seidel under his nose and put a bulge in his hat. Then he left; as a human being he had to go his own way. But afterwards I regretted my behavior too and I have decided to make amends. Of course, I could also apologize a little, I was nervous that day and had had a few annoyances. But no one knows about that, you can not tell such a thing, and then I have to take the whole blame.","“I really shouldn’t have offended Mr. Reinert,” he said. “But I’m sure I can straighten it out when I have a chance to talk to him. I do admit I’m impulsive and outspoken; the whole thing started when he jostled me going through a door. It was nothing, really; I just felt he was being somewhat impolite. But like an idiot I jumped up, called him names, shook a beer mug under his nose, and bashed in his hat— whereupon he walked out. As a gentleman, there was nothing else he could do. But afterwards I was sorry for the way I’d behaved, and decided to make amends. Though I do have something to say in my defense. I was on edge that day, several things had happened which annoyed me immensely. But of course no one could possibly have known that. Those are things you can’t explain; so I prefer to take the blame.”","“The truth is,” he replied, “that it was quite wrong of me to offend the deputy. But I’m quite certain that it will be all right again when I’ve had a chance to talk to him. I’m a bit hasty, a bit too plain-spoken, the whole thing was due to his jostling me as he passed through a door. A trifle, that is, a carelessness on his part; but like a fool I immediately jump up and call him names, shake my tankard under his nose and dent his hat. Then he left; as a gentleman he simply had to take himself off. But afterward I came to regret my conduct, and I’ve decided to make it up with him. Naturally, I may have had an excuse of sorts; I was all nerves that day, having had several disappointments. But nobody knows about that, you can’t tell people such things, so I’d better take the whole blame.”4"
"Fruen lo en stund, så begynte hun å motsi ham heftig. Nei hun kunne ikke utstå den sort blasert snakk, – unnskyld, hun kalte det blasert snakk, – og hun følte seg viss på at hr. Nagel heller ikke mente hva han sa. Når man hørte slikt av dannede mennesker, hva måtte man da ikke vente av menigmann? Hvor ville man havne? Så kunne jo også doktorene pakke sammen?","The lady laughed for a while, then she began to contradict him fiercely. No, she could not stand the black blasé talk, - sorry, she called it blasé talk, - and she felt sure that Mr. Nagel also did not mean what he said. When one heard such things from educated people, what did one not have to expect from ordinary people? Where would you end up? So the doctors could also pack up?","At first Mrs. Stenersen laughed, but then she began to raise objections. No, she couldn’t take that kind of nonsense—he must excuse her—but she was sure he didn’t mean a word of it. When educated people talked like that, what could be expected of the man in the street? Where would it lead to—and, besides, wouldn’t the doctors have to close up shop?","Mrs. Stenersen had a good long laugh, but then began to protest vehemently. She just couldn’t stand that kind of cynical talk—sorry, but she called it cynical talk—and she felt certain that Mr. Nagel didn’t really mean what he said. When you heard educated people say such things, what could be expected of the ordinary joes? Where would we end up? Then even doctors might as well shut up shop."
"Å vil De ikke la være å gripe meg i armen; jeg løper ikke bort. Forresten er det ikke noe som foregår her, jeg har fornærmet den mann som just gikk ut og han ville forsvare seg, det er intet å si på det, alt er i orden.","Oh, you will not stop grabbing me by the arm; I'm not running away. By the way, there is nothing going on here, I have offended the man who just went out and he wanted to defend himself, there is nothing to say about it, everything is fine.","“I’m not going to run away. Besides, nothing is going on here. I made some remarks to the man who just left and he sought to defend himself. That’s all there is to it; everything is settled.”","“Oh, please, don’t grab me by the arm,” Nagel answered, “I won’t run away. Besides, nothing is going on here; I insulted the man who just left and he tried to defend himself. There’s nothing wrong with that, is there? Everything is all right.”"
"Nagel bet tennene sammen av forbitrelse. Hva hadde han sagt den natt på sitt værelse? Hadde han ikke uttrykkelig erklært at han ikke hadde mot til å bruke giften på seg selv? Og der hadde dog en hyklersk og bunnråtten vanskapning av en mannsling sittet på en stol ved siden av ham og i all hemmelighet ikke trodd på hans ord! Den usling, den muldvarp! Han var gått like hjem, hadde tømt glasset, hadde kanskje endog skyllet det godt og derpå fylt det halvt med vann. Og efter denne skjønne gjerning var han gått tilsengs og hadde sovet rolig!","Nagel bit his teeth together in bitterness. What had he said that night in his room? Had he not explicitly stated that he did not have the courage to use the poison on himself? And there, however, a hypocritical and bottomless deformity of a man had sat on a chair next to him and secretly did not believe his words! The bastard, the mole! He had gone straight home, had emptied the glass, had perhaps even rinsed it well and then filled it half with water. And after this beautiful deed he had gone to bed and had slept peacefully!","Nagel ground his teeth in fury and frustration. What was it he said that night in his room? Hadn’t he made a point of saying that he didn’t have the courage to use the poison on himself? And that misshapen rotten hypocritical creature had sat next to him, doubting his word all the time! That sneaky, dirty dog! He had gone straight home, emptied the vial, probably rinsed it several times, and then filled it half full of water. And after this noble deed he had gone to bed and slept peacefully!","Nagel clenched his teeth with indignation. What had he said that night in his room? Hadn’t he explicitly stated that he didn’t have the courage to use the poison on himself? And yet, that utterly rotten, hypocritical freak of a dwarf had been sitting on the chair next to him, secretly doubting his words! What a wretch, a real mole! He had gone straight home and emptied the vial, had perhaps even rinsed it thoroughly and then filled it half full with water. And after this noble deed he had gone to bed and slept soundly!"

"Forresten må De unnskylde meg. Også forrige gang jeg hadde den fornøyelse å se Dem hos meg bragte jeg Dem ut av fatning ved noen høyst dumme spørsmål. De husker at jeg blant annet bydde Dem så og så mange penger for å overta farskapet til et barn, hehehe. Men dengang gjorde jeg denne bommert fordi jeg ikke kjente Dem; nu derimot forbauser jeg Dem påny, og det uaktet jeg kjenner Dem såre vel og setter stor pris på Dem. Se, nu idag gjør jeg det ene og alene fordi jeg er nervøs og allerede høyst drukken. Det er hele forklaringen. De kan naturligvis godt merke at jeg er dørg full? Jovisst kan De så; hvorfor skal De forstille Dem? Men hva det var jeg ville sagt, – jo det skulle virkelig interessere meg å vite hvormeget De anser meg istand til å gjennomskue av den menneskelige sjel. Hehe, jeg mener å kunne merke for eksempel ganske fint en underlyd i dens stemme som jeg taler med, jeg hører utrolig godt. Når jeg sitter og passiarer med en mann så behøver jeg ikke å se på den mann for å følge nøye med i det han sier, jeg hører straks om han binder meg noe på ermet eller om han forfalsker noe. Stemmen er et farlig apparat. Forstå meg rett: jeg mener ikke nettopp stemmens materielle lyd, den kan være høy eller lav, klangfull eller rå, jeg mener ikke det stemmestofflige, tonetilværelsen, nei jeg holder meg til mysteriet bak den, den verden som den utgår fra …. Til helvede forresten med denne verden bak! Alltid skal det være en verden bak! Hva fan raker det meg?","By the way, you have to excuse me. Also the last time I had the pleasure of seeing you with me, I brought you out of composure by some very stupid questions. They remember that I, among other things, offered you so and so much money to take over the paternity of a child, hehehe. But then I made this mistake because I did not know you; now, on the other hand, I am amazed at you again, and despite that I know you very well and appreciate you very much. Look, today I do it solely because I'm nervous and already very drunk. That's the whole explanation. They can of course notice that I'm drunk? Of course you can so; why should you imagine? But what it was I wanted to say - yes, it would really interest me to know how much you consider me able to see through of the human soul. Hehe, I mean to be able to notice for example quite nicely an undertone in its voice that I speak to, I hear incredibly well. When I sit and pass with a man, I do not have to look at that man to follow closely what he says, I immediately hear if he ties something on my sleeve or if he forges something. The voice is a dangerous device. Understand me correctly: I do not mean the material sound of the voice, it can be high or low, sonorous or raw, I do not mean the vocal material, the tonal existence, no I stick to the mystery behind it, the world from which it emanates…. To hell by the way with this world behind! There should always be a world behind it! What the hell is wrong with me?","Nagel went on: “Please forgive me; the last time I had the pleasure of your visit, I seemed to have upset you by asking some indiscreet questions. You may remember that at that time I offered you some money to assume the paternity of a child—legally. Since I didn’t know you, I didn’t know how to express myself. But I seem to be offending you again, despite the fact that I now know you and have great respect for you. But I guess it’s because I’m nervous today and quite drunk. That’s all I can say in my defense. Of course you can see that for yourself. You can—why deny it? But what was I saying? Oh, yes: I wanted to know to what extent you consider me capable of judging human beings? I think I can detect undertones in the voice of the person I’m speaking with —I have a very sensitive ear. When I’m talking to someone, I don’t have to look at him to follow his thinking. I can sense immediately if he is lying or trying to put something over on me. The voice is a dangerous instrument. I don’t mean the timbre of the voice, which may be high or low, melodious or grating. I’m not talking about the sound but about the inner world from which it springs—the underlying mysteries. Oh, to hell with what lies behind the voice! What the devil do I care?”","Then Nagel goes on, “By the way, I owe you an apology. The last time I had the pleasure of seeing you in my place, I also upset you by asking some extremely stupid questions. You will remember that, for one thing, I offered you so and so much money to assume the paternity of a child, heh-heh-heh. But that blunder was committed because I didn’t know you then; now, however, I astonish you afresh, even though I know you extremely well and hold you in great esteem. Today, though, it’s happening solely because I’m nervous and already terribly drunk. That’s the whole explanation. Obviously, you can see I’m dead drunk. Of course you can, why pretend? But what was I going to say? Oh yes, I would really be interested to know to what extent you consider me capable of seeing through the human soul. Heh-heh! 7 For example, I think I can detect subtle undertones in the voice of the person I’m speaking to, I have an incredibly good ear. When I’m talking to someone, I don’t need to look at him in order to follow exactly what he’s saying, I can hear right away whether he’s shamming or pulling my leg. The voice is a dangerous instrument. Now, don’t misunderstand me: I do not mean the material sound of the voice, whether it be high or low, rich or raspy; I do not mean the physical voice, its tonal substance— no, I’m referring to the mystery back of it, the world from which it emanates.... Oh, to hell with the world back of it! Why should there always be a world behind everything? Why should I care a damn?”8"
Ja trodde hun så ikke at han skulle få henne til å holde av seg senerehen når de alltid levet sammen?,"Yes, she did not think he would make her stay away later when they always lived together?","Didn’t she think that he could bring her to love him in time, if they were always together?","So she didn’t believe, did she, that he could make her love him later on, when they would always be together?"
"Ja det hjalp ikke, han rørte den ikke. Og dessuten var organistens fiolin ødelagt av de små rubiner som var innsatt på gripbrettet, tonen fikk en glasslyd av dem, de skulle slett ikke ha vært anbragt der på det sted, det var ikke til å holde ut. Forresten kunne han ikke føre buen mere, ja han hadde for den saks skyld heller aldri kunnet det; ikke sant, han måtte dog vel selv vite om det? …. Men nu fortalte han hvorledes det var gått ham den første og eneste gang hans spill var blitt offentlig omtalt; det var nesten som et symbol deri. Han hadde fått avisen om kvelden og nytt den på sengen; han var meget ung dengang, han bodde hjemme og det var en lokalavis som hadde anmeldt ham. Å hvor han hadde vært lykkelig for den avis! Han leste den mange ganger og falt i søvn uten å slukke lysene. Om natten våknet han og var dødtrett ennu, lysene var brent ut, det var mørkt i hans rom; men han skimtet noe hvitt på gulvet, og da han visste at det var en hvit spyttbakke i hans værelse tenkte han: dette skal du se er den spyttbakken! Det var skam å si det, men så spyttet han og han hørte at det traff. Og da det traff så utmerket den første gang spyttet han en gang til og det traff. Så la han seg til å sove igjen. Men om morgningen så han jo at det var den dyrebare avis han hadde spyttet på, den meget velvillige offentlige mening om ham som han hadde spyttet på. Hehe, det var meget sørgelig!","Yes it did not help, he did not touch it. And besides, the organist's violin was destroyed by the small rubies that were inserted on the fingerboard, the tone got a glass sound from them, they should not have been placed there at all in that place, it was unbearable. By the way, he could no longer carry the bow, yes, for that matter he had never been able to either; not true, he must have known about it himself, right? …. But now he told how he had fared the first and only time his game had been publicly publicized; it was almost like a symbol in it. He had received the newspaper in the evening and put it to bed; he was very young at the time, he lived at home and it was a local newspaper that had reviewed him. Oh how he had been happy for that newspaper! He read it many times and fell asleep without turning off the lights. At night he woke up and was still dead tired, the lights were burnt out, it was dark in his room; but he glimpsed something white on the floor, and when he knew that there was a white saliva tray in his room he thought: this you shall see is that saliva tray! It was a shame to say it, but then he spat and he heard it hit. And when it hit so excellent the first time he spat again and it hit. Then he went to sleep again. But in the morning he saw that it was the precious newspaper he had spat on, the very benevolent public opinion of him that he had spat on. Hehe, that was very sad!","No, he just couldn’t. Besides, the organist’s violin was worthless, with those tiny rubies encrusted in the fingerboard. They made the instrument sound tinny. They should never have been put there; they spoiled the tone completely. Besides, he was out of practice; for that matter, he had never played well, and after all, he was the best judge of that, wasn’t he? Then he told them about the first and last time his playing had been accorded official mention; one might almost say the experience had been symbolic. That evening he had bought the newspaper and was reading it in bed; he was very young and was living at home at the time. The local paper had reviewed his performance—the review had made him so happy! He had read it over and over, till he finally fell asleep with the candles still burning. In the middle of the night he woke up, exhausted. The candles had burned out. The room was in total darkness, but he could discern something white on the floor, and as he knew there was a white spittoon in the room, he thought that must be it. He was embarrassed to say it, but he spat, and his aim was true. Pleased, he tried again and again hit the target, whereupon he fell asleep. In the morning he discovered that it had been the precious review he had spat on. It had upset him very much!","It was no use, he wouldn’t touch it. Moreover, the organist’s violin had been ruined by those tiny inlaid rubies on the fingerboard, which made it sound glassy; they should never have been put there, it was unbearable. Besides, he couldn’t wield the bow anymore—well, for that matter, he had never been able to; who would know that better than himself? ... And now he related what had happened to him the first and only time his playing had received public mention; it almost seemed symbolic. He’d got the paper in the evening and feasted on it in bed; he was very young at the time and living at home, and it was a local paper that had reviewed him. Oh, how happy that paper had made him! He read the review several times and fell asleep without snuffing out the candles. When he awoke during the night he was still dead tired; the candles had burned out and it was dark in the room. But he glimpsed something white on the floor, and since he knew there was a white spittoon in his room, he thought: That must be the spittoon, I imagine! He was ashamed to say it, but he gave a spit, and he heard that it hit the target. And since his aim was so excellent the first time, he spat again and made another hit. Then he went back to sleep. But in the morning he saw that,what he’d spat on was that precious newspaper, that it was the very favorable public opinion of him he’d spat on. Heh-heh, it was quite tragic!"
"Ja det går hurtig å forlove seg for slike folk! Han stikker hjem til foreldrene en tre ukers tid, og så en kveld …. Ja, de løytnanter!","Yes it is quick to get engaged to such people!

He comes home on leave for two or three weeks, and then one night—oh, those lieutenants!”","“Well, for such fellows getting engaged is quickly done! He drops by at his parents’ for two or three weeks, and then one evening ... Oh, those lieutenants!”"
"Allting tenker han over, hver tilfeldighet. Han setter seg igjen og teller de små sedler opp. Han teller ikke nøye, han gir henne alle de småsedler han har, tar på slump og ruller bunken sammen.","He thinks about everything, every coincidence. He sits down and counts up the small bills. He does not count carefully, he gives her all the notes he has, takes by chance and rolls up the pile.","He had carefully thought out every move. He sat down again and began counting out bills of smaller denomination. He counted them perfunctorily, gathered them together, and handed them to her.","He thinks of everything, every contingency.

By the way, he does not have a big house, but he does not need a bigger one either, when his son is gone, only the two old ones are left.

"Da han onsdag morgen stod opp av sengen undersøkte han først den lille giftflasken i sin vestelomme, rystet den, luktet til den og gjemte den igjen. Idet han derpå kledde seg på begynte han av gammel vane å tumle med en av disse lange og uordentlige tankerekker som idelig sysselsatte ham og aldri lot hans trette hode få hvile.

"Han var allerede gått tilsengs da han plutselig savnet sin ring som lå efterglemt på vaskevannsstolen, og som om han ikke kunne være denne usle jernring foruten stod han opp og tok den på igjen. Tilsist brøt han de tre telegrammer, men hadde ikke engang lest det første igjennom før han slo opp en liten kort, tyst latter. Han lå og lo ganske alene med seg selv; hans tenner var overordentlig smukke. Så ble igjen hans ansikt alvorlig og litt efter slengte han telegrammene vekk med den største likegyldighet. De lot allikevel til å angå en stor og viktig sak; det var tale om to og seksti tusen kroner for en landeiendom, ja et tilbud om hele summens utbetaling i kontanter hvis salg kom istand straks. Det var tørre, korte forretningstelegrammer og det var intet latterlig ved dem; men de var uten underskrift. Noen minutter efter var Nagel sovnet.

Then again his face became serious and a little later he threw the telegrams away with the greatest indifference. They nevertheless seemed to concern a great and important cause; it was a matter of sixty-two thousand kroner for a country estate, yes an offer for the full payment of the sum in cash if the sale came about immediately. These were dry, short business telegrams and there was nothing ridiculous about them; but they were without a signature. A few minutes later, Nagel was asleep.

"Han var hele tiden rolig, nesten sløv. Herregud hva var det å blåse opp og gjøre ståhei for! Et år før eller senere spilte ingen rolle, dessuten var jo dette en tanke som han hadde omgåttes med i lang tid. Nu var han også gått totalt trett av sine skuffelser, sine mange feilslagne håp, av humbugen overalt, dette fine daglige bedrag fra alle menneskers side. Han kom ennu engang til å tenke på Minutten som han også hadde husket med en konvolutt med noe i, skjønt hans mistanke til denne stakkars verkbrudne dverg aldri forlot ham. Han tenkte på fru Stenersen som syk og astmatisk snøt sin mann like for hans øyne og aldri røbet seg med en mine; på Kamma, denne lille pengegriske tøs som strakte sine falske armer ut efter ham hvor han reiste hen og stadig gramset i hans lommer efter mere, alltid mere. I øst og vest, i innland og utland hadde han truffet menneskene ens; alt var simpelt og uekte og skammelig troløst, like fra stodderen som bar en frisk hånd i bind, til den blå himmel som fløt av ozon. Og han selv, var han bedre selv? Nei, nei han var ikke bedre selv! Men nu var han også ved enden.","He was calm all the time, almost lethargic. My God, what was it like to blow up and make noise! A year before or later did not matter, moreover, this was a thought that he had been dealing with for a long time. Now he was also totally tired of his disappointments, his many failed hopes, of the hoax everywhere, this fine daily deception on the part of all people. He came to think once more of the Minute he had also remembered with an envelope with something in it, though his suspicion of this poor work-broken dwarf never left him. He thought of Mrs. Stenersen who, sick and asthmatic, snatched her husband right before his eyes and never revealed herself with a face; on Kamma, this little money-hungry slut who stretched his false arms out after him where he traveled and still rummaged in his pockets for more, always more. In the East and the West, at home and abroad, he had met the people alike; everything was simple and illegitimate and shamefully unfaithful, from the stutterer who carried a fresh hand in a bandage, to the blue sky that floated with ozone. And he himself, was he better himself? No, no he was no better himself! But now he was also at the end.","He was calm, almost in a stupor. Good Lord, why make a fuss about it? A year earlier or later wouldn’t make the slightest bit of difference; besides, it had been in the back of his mind for a long time. And now he had had his fill of disappointments, shattered hopes, hypocrisy and deceit. Again he thought of The Midget, whom he had also remembered with an envelope and an enclosure, though his suspicion of the wretched, crippled dwarf was as strong as ever. He thought of Mrs. Stenersen, who, though sickly and asthmatic, deceived her husband right before his eyes without batting an eyelash; of Kamma, the greedy litde golddigger who followed him around with her deceitful arms outstretched wherever he went and was always turning his pockets inside out for more, never satisfied. East and west, at home and abroad, he had always found people to be the same; the same vulgarity, the same hypocrisy—from the beggar who bandaged up a perfectly good hand, to the blue, ozone-filled sky. And he, Nagel, was he any better than the rest? No better, but this was the end.","He was calm all along, almost listless. Goodness, why play it up and make a fuss about it!

"Nagel holdt seg hjemme, drev om med mørke miner og så forpint og lidende ut; hans øyne var på disse to dager blitt ganske matte. Han talte heller ikke til noen, ikke engang til folk i huset. Han hadde en klut viklet om sin ene hånd; en natt han som sedvanlig hadde vært ute til henimot morgenstunden kom han hjem med sin ene hånd i lommetørkleet. De to sår han hadde sa han at han hadde fått ved å falle over en harv som var henslengt på bryggekaien.","Nagel stayed at home, wandering around with dark faces and looking tormented and suffering; his eyes had become quite dull in those two days.

The two wounds he had he said he had received by falling over a harrow that was thrown on the pier.","Nagel stayed at the hotel, wandering around aimlessly, obviously worried and tormented.

"Ikke sant, jeg må nok følge Dem hjem? Jeg vil si Dem noe.","Is not it true, I must follow you home?

"Han foretok seg således ingen ting den hele dag. Han hadde ingen forretninger i byen og gjorde ingen visitt, besøkte intet av kontorene og kjente ikke en sjel. I hotellet forundret man seg litt over hans påfallende likegyldighet for omtrent alt mulig, ja endog for sine egne ting. Således lå ennu de tre telegrammer åpne for enhver på bordet i hans værelse; han hadde ikke rørt ved dem siden om kvelden da de kom. Han kunne også unnlate å svare på likefremme spørsmål. Verten hadde to ganger forsøkt å få ut av ham hva han var for noe og hvorfor han var kommet til byen, men han hadde begge ganger slått det bort. Ennu et eiendommelig trekk kom tilsyne hos ham i løpet av dagen: skjønt han slett ikke kjente et menneske på stedet og ikke hadde henvendt seg til noen hadde han allikevel stanset foran en av byens unge damer ved inngangen til kirkegården, hadde stanset opp og sett på henne og hilst meget dypt uten å si et ord til forklaring. Vedkommende dame hadde rødmet over hele ansiktet. Derpå var det frekke menneske drevet rett utover landeveien, helt til prestegården og forbi den, – noe han forresten også gjorde de påfølgende dager. Det måtte stadig lukkes opp for ham efter at hotellet var stengt om kvelden, så sent kom han hjem fra sine vandringer.","He thus did nothing all day. He had no business in the city and made no visit, visited none of the offices and did not know a soul. In the hotel, people marveled a little at his striking indifference to just about anything, even to their own things. Thus the three telegrams were still open to anyone on the table in his room; he had not touched them since the evening they came. He could also fail to answer straightforward questions. The host had twice tried to find out from him what he was for and why he had come to town, but both times he had turned it down. Another peculiar feature appeared to him during the day: though he did not know a man at all on the spot and had not approached anyone, he had nevertheless stopped in front of one of the town's young ladies at the entrance to the cemetery, had stopped and looked on greeted her very deeply without saying a word of explanation. The lady in question had blushed all over her face. Then the rude man was driven straight across the country road, all the way to the rectory and past it - something he by the way also did the following days. It still had to be opened for him after the hotel was closed in the evening, so late he came home from his walks.","He managed to do nothing the rest of the day as well. He had no business to attend to in town, no offices to contact, and no calls to make, as he didn’t know a soul. The people in the hotel were baffled by his strange apathy toward everything, including his own affairs. The three telegrams lay open on the table in his room for everyone to read; he hadn’t looked at them again since the night they arrived. And sometimes, when asked a direct question, he didn’t even answer. Twice the hotelkeeper had tried to engage him in conservation to find out who he was and what had brought him to town, but both times Nagel had avoided the issue. Another instance of strange behavior occurred during the course of the day. Although he didn’t have a single acquaintance in town and had made no effort to get in touch with anybody, he had nevertheless stopped all of a sudden in front of one of the young ladies of the town at the entrance to the cemetery, fixed his eyes on her, and then bowed deeply, without a word of explanation. The young woman blushed to the roots of her hair, deeply embarrassed, whereupon the impudent fellow walked out of town on the main road, as far as the parsonage, and beyond. He did this several days in a row, always returning to the hotel after closing time, so that the front door had to be opened for him.","And so he did nothing the whole day. He had no business to take care of in the town, visited no offices, and paid no calls, not knowing a soul. The people in the hotel were rather surprised by his marked indifference to nearly everything, even his own affairs. Thus, the three telegrams were still lying on the table in his room, open to everyone; he hadn’t touched them since the evening they arrived. He also failed to answer direct questions at times. Twice the hotel keeper had tried to get out of him who he was and what had brought him to the town, but he had brushed the matter aside both times.1 Another peculiar trait of his became evident in the course of the day: although he didn’t know a soul in the place and hadn’t made contact with anybody, he had nonetheless stopped in front of one of the young ladies in town at the entrance to the churchyard—had stopped to look at her and bowed very deeply without a word of explanation. The lady in question had blushed all over her face. Afterward the impudent fellow had strolled right down the highway, as far as the parsonage and beyond, which he also did, incidentally, on the following days. He would return so late from his rambles that it was after closing time, and they constantly had to open the door for him at the hotel."
Hun ropte rasende:,She shouted furiously:,“Didn’t you hear me say no?”,“Didn’t I say no!
"Men jeg har ingen gamle ting, sa hun endelig, og hun så dyktig fortvilet ut.","But I have no old things, she finally said, and she looked skillfully desperate.","“But I don’t have any old things,” she said at last, looking desperate and quite bewildered.","“But I don’t have any old things,” she said at last, looking quite desperate."
"Den gale mann, var han da blitt rent forrykt? Sara lo, men hun begynte å bli halvt redd for hans mange underlige påfunn. Iforgårs hadde han gitt en kone mange flere penger enn hun skulle ha da hun bragte ham hans vask; idag ville han forære bort sin pels. Man talte også allehånde om ham ute i byen.","The mad man, had he gone mad? Sara laughed, but she began to be half afraid of his many strange inventions. The day before yesterday he had given a wife much more money than she should have when she brought him his wash; today he would give away his fur. There was also a lot of talk about him out in the city.","This madman—had he completely lost his mind? Sara laughed, but she was beginning to feel a litde apprehensive at all these strange goings-on. The day before yesterday he had given the laundress far more money than he owed her, and today he insisted on giving away his fur coat! All sorts of stories were circulating about him in town.","The crazy man, had he gone completely out of his mind? Sara laughed, but she was getting half frightened by his many strange ideas.

They were also saying all sorts of things about him in town."
"Ja ikke sant, jeg spøkte bare, det falt meg inn å gjøre litt løyer. Jo jeg har gudskjelov mange penger ennu; se her, vil De bare se!","Yes not true, I was just kidding, it occurred to me to do some lies. Yes, thank God I still have a lot of money; look here, you just want to see!",I thought I would have some fun with you. Thank God I still have lots of money left. Look here!”,"Heaving a delicious sigh of relief, he says, “Yes, of course, I was only joking; I suddenly felt like pulling a fast one on you. Sure, I still have lots of money, thank God; look here, just take a look!”"
"Morgningen efter befant Nagel seg i en fin og glad stemning. Den var kommet over ham mens han lå i sengen, det var som taket i hans værelse plutselig steg og steg oppover, steg i det uendelige oppover og ble til en fjern, klar himmelhvelving. Og han følte med én gang en mild, søt vind over seg som om han lå ute i grønt gress. Fluene summet også omkring i værelset; det var en varm sommermorgen.","The next morning, Nagel was in a nice and happy mood. It had come over him while he was lying in bed, it was as if the ceiling in his room suddenly rose and rose upwards, rose endlessly upwards and became a distant, clear sky. And he immediately felt a gentle, sweet wind over him as if he were lying out in the green grass. The flies also buzzed around the room; it was a hot summer morning.","THE next morning Nagel was in unusually good spirits. While still in bed, he had felt strangely exhilarated. It was as if the ceiling of his room kept on floating upward toward infinity and became one with the firmament. Suddenly he felt a soft, fragrant breeze sweep over him as if he were lying with the sky as his ceiling on a bed of green grass. It was a warm summer morning; flies were buzzing around the room.","THE FOLLOWING MORNING Nagel found himself in an excellent, joyful mood. It had come upon him while lying in bed; it was as though the ceiling of his room were suddenly rising higher and higher, rising endlessly until it became a clear, far-away vault of heaven. All at once he felt a sweet, mild breeze blowing on him, as if he were lying in a green meadow. And the flies were buzzing about the room; it was a warm summer morning."

"Nagel så på ham og smilte, gikk bort til bordet, tok fullmektigens hatt og rakte ham den med et bukk. Fullmektigen rev hatten til seg og ville i sitt raseri slenge den tilbake, men betenkte seg og satte den på hodet med et smell. Derpå vendte han seg om og gikk ut av døren. Han hadde to svære buler i sin hatt da han gikk og fikk derved et komisk utseende.","Nagel looked at him and smiled, went to the table, took the proxy's hat and handed it to him with a buck. The clerk tore the hat to himself and in his rage wanted to throw it back, but hesitated and put it on his head with a bang. Then he turned and walked out the door. He had two large dents in his hat when he walked and thus got a comical look.","Nagel looked at him and smiled, walked over to the table, picked up the deputy’s hat, and handed it to him with a bow. The deputy snatched the hat from Nagel and made a movement as if about to fling it back furiously, but then apparently changed his mind and, exploding with rage, he smacked it on his head and stormed out. It was bashed in on two sides and made him look like a clown.","Nagel looked at him and smiled, walked over to the table, picked up the deputy’s hat and handed it to him with a bow.

"Straks Minutten kom inn døren gikk Nagel bort til ham og bad om unnskyldning for at han hadde vrøvlet så altfor meget da de sist var sammen.

"Han reiste hodet og så på henne. Dette hvithårede fattiglem, pike i førti år, med et sort, glødende blikk ennu og allikevel med et vesen som minte om en nonne, denne sære og fremmedartede skjønnhet virket på ham og fikk ham for et øyeblikk til å vakle.

"Røken av Nagels cigar steg blå tilværs. Han gikk allerede og inndrakk duften fra skogen og gresset og en fornemmelse av gjennomtrengende tilfredshet grep ham, en sær og sterk glede som jog vann opp i hans øyne og nesten betok ham været. Han gikk ved Dagnys side; hun hadde intet sagt ennu. Da de var kommet forbi kirkegården hadde han ytret et par rosende ord om doktorens, men hun hadde ikke svart. Nu hadde nattens stillhet og skjønnhet beruset ham så dypt, trengt så lidenskapelig inn på ham, at hans åndedrett ble kort og hans blikk tåket. Ja hvor det var deilig i de lyse netter! Han sa med høy røst:","The smoke from Nagel's cigar rose blue. He was already walking and inhaling the scent of the forest and the grass and a feeling of piercing satisfaction gripped him, a strange and strong joy that jogged water up in his eyes and almost captivated him the weather. He walked by Dagny's side; she had not said anything yet. When they had passed the cemetery he had uttered a few words of praise about the doctor's, but she had not answered. Now the silence and beauty of the night had intoxicated him so deeply, penetrated him so passionately, that his breathing became short and his gaze hazy. Yes how lovely it was on those bright nights! He said in a loud voice:","The smoke from Nagel’s cigar rose in a blue spiral. He was already inhaling the fragrance of the woods and the grass, and he was filled with a sense of contentment. It was a feeling of intense joy, which brought tears to his eyes and choked him. He was walking next to Dagny; she still hadn’t said a word. As they passed the cemetery, he made a few complimentary remarks about the Stenersens, but she made no reply. The beauty and the stillness of the night filled him with such elation that his breath came in gasps and his eyes welled with tears. What magic in these white nights! In a loud voice, he exclaimed: “Just look how clearly one can see the ridges over there!","The smoke from Nagel’s cigar rose in blue swirls. Already taking in the fragrance of the grass and the woods, he was seized with a keen sense of contentment, a special, intense joy that made his eyes water and nearly took his breath away. He was walking beside Dagny, who hadn’t yet spoken. After passing the cemetery, he had uttered a few words of praise for the Stenersens, but she hadn’t answered. By now the stillness and beauty of the night had intoxicated him so profoundly, imbued him with such ardor, that his breath quickened and his eyes grew dim. Oh, how lovely these white nights were! “Just look at those hills over there, how clear they are!” he said in a loud voice."
"Og for Tolstoj, svarte Nagel, stillet det seg slik: det må være en viss grense for hvormeget jeg gir bort! Hvisårsak han lot sin kone påta seg skylden for at han ikke gir bort mere! Hehehe, nå, men det springer vi over …. Men hør: gir man da virkelig bort en krone fordi man er god eller fordi man mener å gjøre en god og moralsk gjerning derved? Hvor jeg synes at denne betraktningsmåte er naiv! Det gis folk som ikke kan annet enn gi bort. Hvorfor? Fordi de føler en sann psykisk nytelse derved. De gjør det ikke av logisk beregning, de stikker seg vekk og gjør det, de avskyr å gjøre det åpenlyst fordi dette ville bortta en del av behaget derved. De gjør det i hemmelighet, med skjelvende og hastige hender, med brystet gyngende av et sjelelig velvære som de ikke selv forstår. Det slår dem plutselig at de skal gi noe bort, det opptrer i form av en følelse i brystet, en øyeblikkelig og selsom trang, som skyter opp i dem og demmer deres øyne under vann. De gir ikke av godhet, men av drift, for sitt personlige velværes skyld; somme mennesker er slike! Man taler om de gavmilde mennesker med beundring, – som sagt: jeg må være anderledes innrettet enn andre folk, men jeg beundrer ikke gavmilde mennesker. Nei jeg gjør ikke det. Hvem fan vil ikke heller gi enn motta? Tør jeg spørre om det finnes et menneskebarn på jorden som ikke heller vil avhjelpe nød enn være nødlidende? For å benytte Dem selv, hr. doktor, som eksempel: De gav nylig en rorskar som De hadde fem kroner. Jeg hørte det tilfeldigvis. Nå, men hvorfor gav De bort disse fem kroner? Visselig ikke for å gjøre Gud en velbehagelig gjerning, det falt Dem visst ikke inn da; kanskje mannen slett ikke trengte det synderlig hårdt engang, men De gjorde det allikevel. Og De gav i det øyeblikk sikkert efter bare for en viss lys impuls i Dem til å slippe Dem noe av hende og glede andre …. Jeg synes det er så usigelig lurvet å gjøre vesen av den menneskelige godgjørenhet. Man går på gaten en dag, det er den og den sort vær og man ser de og de mennesker, hvilket altsammen opparbeider en stemning i en av den og den art. Plutselig får man øye på et ansikt, et barneansikt, et stodderansikt – la oss si et stodderansikt – som bringer en til å sitre. En selsom følelse skjelver gjennom sjelen og man stamper i gaten og stanser opp. Dette ansikt har slått an en usedvanlig ømtålig streng i en og man lokker stodderen inn i en port og presser ham en tikrone i hånden. Røber du det, nevner du ett ord, så dreper jeg deg! hvisker man, og man skjærer nesten tenner og gråter av heftighet når man sier det. Så meget er det en om å gjøre å forbli uoppdaget. Og dette kan gjenta seg dag efter dag så man mangen gang kommer i den verste knipe selv og ikke eier en øre mer i lommen …. Dette er ikke trekk fra meg selv naturligvis; men jeg kjenner en mann, en annen mann, ja jeg kjenner for den saks skyld to menn som er således beskaffen …. Nei man gir fordi man må gi, og dermed basta! Herfra vil jeg dog gjøre en unntagelse for de gjerriges vedkommende. De gjerrige og de grovt nærige bringer virkelig ofre når de gir noe bort, derom er det ikke tvil. Og derfor vil jeg si at slike folk er mere å akte for en øre som de overvinner seg til å avse enn en mann som De og han og jeg som av nytelse øser ut en krone. Hils Tolstoj med det at jeg gir ikke en styver for hele hans vemmelige utstillingsgodhet, – ikke før han gir bort alt han eier, og ikke engang da …. Forresten ber jeg om unnskyldning hvis jeg har forarget noen. En ny cigar, hr. Grøgaard. Hr. doktor, skål!","And for Tolstoy, Nagel replied, it was like this: there must be a certain limit to how much I give away! Why did he let his wife take the blame for not giving away more! Hehehe, now, but we skip that…. But listen: do you really give away a penny because you are good or because you mean to do a good and moral deed by it? How I think this view is naive! There are people who can only give away. Why? Because they feel a true psychic pleasure thereby. They do not do it by logical calculation, they run away and do it, they abhor doing it openly because this would take away some of the pleasure thereby. They do it in secret, with trembling and hasty hands, with their breasts rocking with a spiritual well-being that they do not even understand. It suddenly strikes them that they are going to give something away, it acts in the form of a feeling in their chest, an immediate and strange urge, which shoots up into them and dims their eyes under water. They do not give out of kindness, but out of drive, for the sake of their personal well-being; some people are like that! People talk about the generous people with admiration - as I said: I must be different from other people, but I do not admire generous people. No I do not do that. Who the hell would not give rather than receive? Dare I ask if there is a human child on earth who would not relieve distress rather than be in distress? To use yourself, Mr. doctor, as an example: You recently gave a helmsman who you had five kroner. I heard it by chance. Well, but why did you give away those five kroner? Certainly not to make God a pleasing deed, it certainly did not occur to you then; maybe the man did not even need it very hard at all, but you did it anyway. And at that moment you probably gave in just for a certain light impulse in you to let go of something and please others…. I think it is so unspeakably shabby to make the essence of human benevolence. You walk on the street one day, it is this and that black weather and you see them and those people, which all create a mood in one of this and that species. Suddenly you see a face, a child's face, a stodder face - let's say a stodder face - that makes one tremble. A strange feeling trembles through the soul and you stomp in the street and stop. This face has struck an unusually delicate string in one and the stutterer is lured into a gate and a tikrone is pressed into his hand. If you reveal it, you mention one word, and I'll kill you! you whisper, and you almost cut your teeth and cry violently when you say so. So much is there about doing to remain undiscovered. And this can be repeated day after day so many times you get into the worst trouble yourself and do not own a penny more in your pocket…. This is not a trait of myself of course; but I know one man, another man, yea, I know for that matter two men who are thus possessed…. No you give because you have to give, and thus basta! From here, however, I will make an exception for the stingy. The stingy and the coarse stingy really bring sacrifices when they give something away, there is no doubt about that. And therefore I would say that such people are more to beware of an ear that they overcome to dispose of than a man like You and he and I who out of pleasure pour out a penny. Greet Tolstoj with the fact that I do not give a stiff for all his horrible show goodness, - not until he gives away everything he owns, and not even then…. By the way, I apologize if I have offended anyone. A new cigar, mr. Grøgaard. Mr. Doctor, cheers!","“Tolstoy’s position was this,” replied Nagel, “ ‘I will give away a certain amount, and no more.’ That is why he let his wife take the blame when he had reached what he considered to be his limit. Well, we’ll let that go. But the point is this: do you give someone a crown out of the goodness of your heart, or because you must act according to your conscience and do a good deed? This seems like such simplistic thinking to me. There are people who are compulsive givers. Why? Because it satisfies their ego; it gives them real psychic pleasure. They don’t do it in an obvious or calculated way; they do it quietly and unobtrusively. They would hate to give openly because that would rob them of a great deal of pleasure. No, it has to be done secretly, with a quick movement of the trembling hand, accompanied by sentimentality and a feeling of inner satisfaction that they themselves do not understand. Suddenly they have an impulse to give something away. It manifests itself by a strange sensation in the chest, a strange urge that suddenly comes upon them and makes their eyes water. They don’t give out of kindness but by compulsion—for the sake of their peace of mind. That’s what drives some people. You speak of generous people with such admiration. As I said, I must be different from the rest of you—but I don’t admire them in the least. I’ll be damned if there is a single human being who wouldn’t rather give than receive! May I ask if there is a human being on earth who wouldn’t rather alleviate suffering than inflict it? To use you as an example, doctor: I heard you say that you’d given five crowns to a man who rowed you over. Why did you give him five crowns? You certainly didn’t do it to please God: I’m sure the thought never occurred to you. Maybe the man wasn’t even hard up, but you still had to do it. At that moment you simply yielded to an impulse to dispose of something, which at the same time meant giving pleasure to someone else. In my opinion, it’s nauseating to make such a fuss about charity. You’re walking along the street one day—the weather, the kind of people you meet, everything contributes to putting you in a certain frame of mind. Suddenly you see a face, a child’s face, the face of a beggar. Let’s take the beggar’s face—it shakes you. A strange feeling comes over you and you come to a dead stop. That face has touched a rare and sensitive spot in you. You lure the beggar into a doorway and press a ten-crown bill into his hand. ‘If you say a single word about this to anyone, I’ll kill you,’ you hiss, and you are on the verge of gnashing your teeth and crying with suppressed emotion. After all, you can’t afford to be caught doing this kind of thing! And this situation can come up day after day until you find yourself in the awkward position of not having a penny in your pocket. Mind you, this doesn’t apply to me, but I know a man—as a matter of fact, two—who are compulsive givers. No one gives because he is forced to, and that’s that—with the exception of misers and tightwads; they really make a sacrifice when they part with something—there’s no doubt about that. Those people deserve much more praise for the øre they reluctantly part with, I think, than a man like you, him, or me, who indulge in emotionalism when handing out a crown. Tell Tolstoy from me that I don’t give a damn about his disgusting show of generosity—not until he gives away all he owns, and not even then. But do forgive me if I’ve hurt anyone’s feelings. Have another cigar, Mr. Grøgaard. Cheers, doctor!”","“And for Tolstoy,” Nagel replied, “the situation was this: there must be a certain limit to how much to give away! For which reason he let his wife take the blame for not giving away more! Heh-heh-heh, well, we’ll skip that.... But look: does one really give away a krone because one is kind, because one intends to do a kind and moral deed? How naive this view appears to me! There are some people who cannot help giving. Why? Because they experience a real psychological pleasure in doing so. They don’t do it with an eye to their own advantage, they do it on the quiet; they detest doing it openly because that would take away some of the satisfaction. They do it in secret, with quick trembling hands, their breast rocked by a spiritual well-being which they do not themselves understand. Suddenly they are overcome by an impulse to give something away; it manifests itself as a sensation in their breasts, a mysterious momentary desire that springs up in them and floods their eyes with tears. They don’t give out of kindness, but from an urge, for the sake of their personal well-being; some people are like that! One speaks of generous people with admiration; as I’ve said, I must be differently made from the rest of you: I don’t admire generous people. No, I don’t. Who the hell wouldn’t rather give than receive! May I ask if there exists a human being on earth who wouldn’t rather relieve destitution than be destitute? To use you as an example, Doctor: Not long ago you gave your oarsman five kroner. I overheard it by chance. Now then, why did you give away those five kroner? Surely not to perform a deed pleasing to God, which probably didn’t occur to you then; maybe the man didn’t even need the money very badly, but you gave it to him all the same. At that moment, I suspect, you simply yielded to a certain happy impulse to relinquish something and give pleasure to someone else.... To me, it seems unspeakably shabby to make a fuss over charity. You’re walking along the street one day, the weather is so and so and you see such and such people, all of which builds up a certain mood in you. Suddenly you catch sight of a face, a child’s face, a beggar’s face—let’s say a beggar’s face—which makes you tremble. A strange sensation vibrates through your soul, and you stamp your foot and come to a halt. This face has struck an exceptionally sensitive chord in you, and you lure the beggar into an entranceway and press a ten-krone bill into his hand. If you give me away by as much as a word, I’ll kill you! you whisper, and you fairly grind your teeth and shed tears of anger saying it. That’s how important it is to you to remain undiscovered. And this can happen repeatedly, day after day, so that often you end up in the worst kind of scrape yourself, without a penny in your pocket.... These traits are not my own, of course; but I do know a man, another man—well, for that matter, I know two men who are thus constituted.... No, you give because you have to give, and that’s that! However, I’ll make an exception as far as misers are concerned. Misers and blatantly stingy people make real sacrifices when they give something away, there can be no doubt about that. And so I say that such people are more worthy of respect, for the one øre they bring themselves to spare, than a man like you, or him or me, who squanders a krone for the pleasure of it. Tell Tolstoy from me that I don’t give a stiver for all his nauseating show of kindness—not until he gives away all he owns, and not even then.... By the way, I apologize if I have given offense to anybody. Have another cigar, Mr. Grøgaard. Skoal, Doctor!”"
"Nu kom doktoren inn fra kontoret. Man måtte unnskylde ham, han måtte avsted; farlig tilfelle, forblødning.

Then she apologized again: there were so many people, she might not be able to raise the money here on the street, she had kept them so well….","She began to undo her bodice but then checked herself and looked around, confused. Again she apologized; there were so many people around. Maybe she couldn’t take out the money right here; she had it so well hidden.","She begins to unbutton her bodice, but suddenly checks herself and looks around, not knowing what to do.

He bowed countless times as he walked backwards up the street. But he did not get a word out, though he kept trying to say something.","The Midget took his leave, bowing repeatedly as he backed into the street; he kept trying to say something, but the words wouldn’t come.","Miniman left.

"Hva? Virkelig? Det hadde vært andre? Hva sier De, en dame? Ja disse fordervelige kvinnfolk, de skulle nu stikke sin snute inn allevegne! Hun hadde altså fått nyss om denne raritet av en stol og straks skulle hun slå den under seg. Jo det var fruentimmernes sedvanlige fremgangsmåte. Men hva bydde hun så, hvor høyt gikk hun? Jeg sier Dem, jeg slipper ikke stolen for noen pris, fan søkke meg om jeg gjør!","What? Really? There had been others? What do you say, lady? Yes, these pernicious women, they should now stick their snout in everywhere! So she had heard about this rarity from a chair and immediately she was going to put it under her. Yes, that was the usual procedure of the ladies' classes. But what did she bid then, how high did she go? I tell you, I do not drop the chair at any cost, damn seek me if I do!","“You had a client? A lady, did you say? Those darned women, always poking their noses into everything! This one probably got wind of the rare piece and immediately felt that she had to have it.

Indeed!” There had been others? “What are you saying, a lady? Oh, these pernicious women, poking their noses everywhere!” So, she had gotten wind of this rarity of a chair and had to snatch it up right away. Sure, that was the way those women operated. “But what did she offer, how high did she go? Let me tell you, I won’t let go of that chair for anything, the hell I will!”"

"Nei du gode Gud, hva har jeg gjort Dem? Kan De ikke la meg være i fred? Hvorfor skal nettopp jeg være til narr for alle? Den fremmede derborte ser hit, jeg har lagt merke til det, han holder øye med oss og ler formodentlig han også. Således er det bestandig, den første dag De kom hit som fullmektig hadde doktor Stenersen meg fatt og lærte Dem straks å drive løyer med meg og nu lærer De herren derborte det samme. Den ene efter den andre lærer det efter tur.","No you good God, what have I done to you? Can you not leave me alone? Why exactly should I be a fool to everyone? The stranger over there is looking here, I've noticed it, he's keeping an eye on us and he's probably laughing too. Thus it is always, the first day you came here as a proxy, Dr. Stenersen had caught me and immediately taught you to lie with me and now you teach the Lord over there the same thing. One after the other learns it in turn.","“Dear God in heaven, what harm have I done you? Can’t you leave me in peace? Why should I play the fool in front of everyone? I see that stranger over there looking at us. He keeps glancing in our direction and I suppose he’s laughing too. That’s always the way it is; the very first day you came here as deputy, Dr. Stenersen cornered me and taught you to make a fool of me, and now you’re encouraging the man over there to do the same. One passes it down to the other.”","“Good God, what harm did I ever do you? Can’t you just leave me alone? Why should I, of all people, be the laughingstock of everybody? That stranger over there is looking in our direction, I see; he’s keeping an eye on us and I dare say he’s laughing, too. Things never change; the very first day you came here as a deputy judge, Dr. Stenersen jumped on me and taught you right away to make fun of me, and now you’re teaching the gentleman over there to do the same.

"Men det gikk ikke, nei når han tenkte seg om måtte han kassere planen. Var det ikke best at han forklarte seg litt utførligere og sendte pengene med, for å være sikker på at de også ble ekspedert? Han rev telegrammet istykker, brente det straks og skrev et brev i hui og hast. Jo det var bedre, et helt lite brev var fullstendigere, det kunne virkelig gå an. Jo han skulle vise henne, la henne forstå ….","But it did not work, no when he thought about it he had to discard the plan. Wasn't it best that he explained himself in a little more detail and sent the money with him, to be sure that they were also expedited? He tore the telegram to pieces, burned it immediately, and wrote a letter in a hurry. Yes it was better, a very small letter was more complete, it could really work. Yes he should show her, let her understand….","But it wouldn’t work. After thinking it over, he decided against it. Wouldn’t it be better to explain and to send along the money, to be sure that it was forwarded? He tore up the telegram, burned it, and quickly dashed off a letter. Yes, that would be better; a letter conveyed more information; this way his plan had a far better chance of working. He would show her—make her understand!","But it wouldn’t work. No, on second thought he had to discard the plan. Hadn’t he better give a few more particulars, and enclose the money to ensure that it would be sent? He tore up the telegram, burned it at once and dashed off a letter. Yes, that was better; a letter, however brief, was more complete, it might really do. Oh, he would show her, give her to understand...."
"Si meg, – ja unnskyld at jeg ikke lar Dem snakke ut; men har kanskje også De litt av den evne å høre hva som bever bak frøken Kiellands materielle stemme! Men nu hører De ganske bestemt selv at jeg vrøvler kapitalt? Ja ikke sant? Altså! Men det skulle glede meg om også De forstod Dem litt på mennesker, så ville jeg nemlig lykkønske Dem med det og si: vi er to, i høyden er vi to, som forstår oss på dette herre, kom, la oss slutte oss sammen til et selskap, en liten forening, og aldri bruke vår viten mot hverandre – mot hverandre, forstår De – således at jeg for eksempel aldri bruker min viten mot Dem, selv om jeg gjennomskuer Dem nokså meget. Nå, nu blir De urolig og ser sky ut igjen! La Dem bare ikke narre av mitt skryt, jeg er full …. Men nu husker jeg tilfeldigvis hva jeg ville ha sagt for litt siden da jeg begynte å tale om frøken Kielland som ikke lå meg på hjerte. Hvorfor skulle jeg også plumpe ut med min mening om henne når De ikke hadde spurt meg! Jeg har nok aldeles spolert Deres gode humør; kan De huske hvor glad De var da De kom inn her for en times tid siden? Alt dette sludder kommer av vinen …. Men la meg nu ikke for annen gang glemme hva jeg skulle si: da De fortalte om det ungkarslag hos byfogden, De husker da De ble døpt, så oppstod selsomt nok den tanke i meg at også jeg ville holde et ungkarslag, jo på død og liv et ungkarslag for noen innbudne, jeg gir meg ikke på det, jeg vil ha det istand, og De må også komme, jeg gjør sikker regning på Dem. De skal være aldeles trygg for å bli døpt om igjen ennu en gang, jeg skal sørge for at De blir behandlet med den største forekommenhet og aktelse; i det hele tatt blir ingen stoler og bord knust. Men jeg ville gjerne se endel venner hos meg en kveld og helst så snart som mulig, la oss si i slutningen av uken. Hva mener De om det?","Tell me - yes, excuse me for not letting you speak; but perhaps you also have some of the ability to hear what is trembling behind Miss Kielland's material voice! But now you certainly hear for yourself that I'm rubbish capital? Yeah right? Therefore! But I should be glad if you also understood a little about people, then I would like to congratulate you on that and say: we are two, in the height we are two, who understand us on this lord, come, let us join together to a company, a small association, and never use our knowledge against each other - against each other, you understand - so that I, for example, never use my knowledge against you, even if I see through you quite a lot. Well, now you get restless and look shy again! Just do not be fooled by my boasting, I'm drunk…. But now I happen to remember what I would have said a little while ago when I started talking about Miss Kielland who was not on my mind. Why should I also plump out with my opinion of her when you had not asked me! I have probably completely spoiled your good mood; Do you remember how happy you were when you came in here an hour ago? All this nonsense comes from the wine…. But now let me not forget for the second time what I should say: when you told about the bachelor party at the town bailiff, You remember when you were baptized, the thought strangely arose in me that I too would hold a bachelor party, of course on death and live a bachelor party for some invited, I do not give in to it, I want it possible, and you must come too, I make sure of you. You will be perfectly safe from being baptized again, I will make sure that you are treated with the utmost care and respect; no chairs and tables are broken at all. But I would like to see some friends with me one evening and preferably as soon as possible, let's say at the end of the week. What do you think about it?","“Tell me, excuse me for interrupting you, but perhaps you are also sensitive enough to sense the undertones, the vibrations, in Miss Kielland’s voice? Now I’m talking nonsense, and I’m sure you’re aware of it, aren’t you? But I would be glad if I felt I had an ally in you—that you were also able to size up people. Then we could shake hands, have a sort of pact, and never betray each other. Do you understand what I mean? In other words, I would never use what I know about you, although I read you like a book. Now you have that harried and confused look again! Don’t take me seriously; I’ve had far too much to drink. But now I suddenly remember what I was going to say about Miss Kielland, and it couldn’t matter less. But then, why should I volunteer my opinion when you haven’t even asked me? I’m sorry if I’ve said something to displease you. “When you came here an hour ago, you were in such high spirits. All this talk comes from drinking too much wine. But I must try to stick to what I was trying to say. You were talking about the stag party at the mayor’s—you remember—when you were baptized. That suddenly gave me the idea that I would like to give a stag party. Just a few friends—and you must come too— I’m counting on you. Don’t worry—you won’t be baptized again. I’ll see to it that you’re treated with courtesy and respect. This time there won’t be any smashing of tables and chairs—I promise you! But I would like to get a few friends together here some evening—soon—over the weekend. How do you feel about that?”","“Tell me—hm, beg pardon for not letting you finish what you were saying—don’t you too, perhaps, have a modest gift for picking up the quavers at the back of Miss Kielland’s physical voice? But now I’m talking utter nonsense , you can certainly hear that, can’t you? Well! Nevertheless, I would be delighted if you, too, knew something about people, so that I could congratulate you and say: there are two of us, two at most, who know something about this; come, let’s get together and form a partnership, a small association, and never use our knowledge against each other—against each other, understand—so that I, for example, will never use my knowledge against you, even though I can read you like a book. There, there, now you’re getting that wary look and start fidgeting again! You mustn’t let yourself be fooled by my brag, I’m drunk.... But now I happen to remember what I wanted to say a short while ago, when I began talking about Miss Kielland, who wasn’t of vital concern to me. Why should I blurt out my opinion of her anyway, as long as you hadn’t asked me for it! It seems I have completely spoiled your good mood; do you remember how happy you were when you came here about an hour ago? All this twaddle is because of the wine.... But let me not forget a second time what I was going to say. When you told me about the bachelor party given by the justice of the peace, at which you were baptized, remember, it occurred to me, strangely enough, that I would also like to give a bachelor party— yes, come hell or high water, a bachelor party for a few invited guests, I won’t budge on that, I’m going to arrange it; and you must come, too, I’m counting on you. You won’t be baptized all over again, you can set your mind at ease on that score; I’ll see to it that you’re treated with the utmost courtesy and respect. And there won’t be any smashing up of tables and chairs. But I would like to have a few friends over some evening, the sooner the better, let’s say toward the end of the week. What do you think?”"
"Jo, sa han, jeg syntes nok at det ble litt galt for Dem hist og her; men hva fan, vi er dog ikke skjønnere allesammen.","Yes, he said, I probably thought it was a little wrong for you here and there; but what the hell, we are not all prettier though.","“Yes,” he said, “I noticed that you were a bit off key at times, but what does that matter? We’re not all connoisseurs.”","“Well,” he said, “I did feel you made a few mistakes here and there; but what the hell, we aren’t all of us connoisseurs, you know.”"
"Frakken? Nei ikke ennu. Men jeg får den nok, svarte Minutten. Må jeg ikke takke Dem så meget for igår – og takk for alt! Jaja, idag begraver vi da Karlsen! Å ja, i Guds navn, vi får finne oss i det.","The coat? No not yet. But I'll get it enough, replied the Minute. May I not thank you so much for yesterday - and thank you for everything! Well, today we bury Karlsen! Oh yes, in the name of God, we get to find ourselves in it.","“The coat? No, not yet, but I’m sure I will,” The Midget replied. “Thank you very much for last night—and thank you for everything. Well, today we’re burying Karlsen. I guess it’s God’s will.”","“The coat? No, not yet. But I’ll get it, all right,” Miniman replied. “I would like to thank you so much for last night—thanks for everything! Well, here we are, burying Karlsen! Hm, it’s God’s will, we have to resign ourselves to it.”"
"I løpet av formiddagen bestilte han ikke noe annet enn å skrive et par brever og å drive lesende i en bok opp og ned over gulvet i sitt værelse. Han kjøpte dessuten et par hansker i en butikk og litt senere da han gikk på torvet betalte han ti kroner for en liten rød hundehvalp som han straks derpå forærte hotellverten. Hvalpen hadde han til latter for alle mennesker døpt Jakobsen, og det uaktet det attpå kjøpet var en tispe.","During the morning, he ordered nothing more than to write a couple of letters and to drive readers in a book up and down the floor of his room. He also bought a pair of gloves in a shop and a little later when he went to the square he paid ten kroner for a little red puppy which he immediately afterwards gave to the hotel host. The puppy he had laughed at for all people was christened Jakobsen, and that despite the fact that at the time of the purchase was a bitch.","All he did that morning was to write a couple of letters and walk up and down his room reading a book. He also went to a shop and bought a pair of gloves, and then wandered over to the marketplace, where he bought a little reddish-brown puppy for ten crowns which he immediately presented to the hotelkeeper. Everyone thought it very amusing that he named the puppy Jacobsen, although it was a female.","In the course of the morning he did nothing except write a few letters and pace the floor of his room reading a book.

To everybody’s amusement, he had baptized the puppy Jakobsen, regardless of the fact that it was a female."
"Ved titiden våknet han igjen. Han var alene og lå ennu i sofaen. Et teppe som Sara hadde breid over ham var falt på gulvet, men han frøs ikke allikevel. Sara hadde også lukket vinduene og han åpnet dem igjen. Det forekom ham at han var klar i hodet; men han var matt og han skalv. Den dumpe redsel begynte igjen å gripe ham, han følte det gjennom marg og ben når det knakk i veggene eller når det lydde et rop fra gaten. Kanskje hvis han gikk tilsengs og sov til imorgen ville det gå over. Og han kledde seg av.","At ten o'clock he woke up again. He was alone and still lying on the couch. A blanket that Sara had spread over him had fallen to the floor, but he did not freeze anyway. Sara had also closed the windows and he opened them again. It seemed to him that he was clear in his head; but he was dull and he was shaking. The dull fear began to seize him again, he felt it through his marrow and bones when it cracked in the walls or when there was a shout from the street. Maybe if he went to bed and slept until tomorrow it would pass. And he undressed.","About ten o’clock he woke up. He was still lying on the sofa. The blanket that Sara had put on him had slipped down on the floor, but he wasn’t cold. Sara had also closed the windows, and he opened them. His head seemed to have cleared, but he felt faint and was trembling. Once more he was seized with terror and apprehension. When the walls creaked, or when there was a shout from the street, he felt the noise going through the very marrow of his bones. Maybe if he went to bed and slept until morning it would go away. He undressed.","He awoke again about ten. Alone, he was still lying on the sofa. The blanket that Sara had spread over him had fallen on the floor, but he didn’t feel cold.

"Hvor du gjør meg glad i deg, hvor du fyller meg med lykke!","Where you make me love you, where you fill me with happiness!",I can’t help loving you.’,"Stopping once more, I pressed her to my breast and said, ‘How dearly you make me love you, how you fill me with happiness!’"
"Ja, svarte Nagel, det har jeg også tenkt på.

But I don’t have the guts.” Pause. “I’m far from saying that I would have the courage, but if I should one day, I’ll have my pistol ready.

"Da han gikk inn gjennom hotelldøren hadde han allerede for lenge siden glemt all sin bitterhet; hans hjerte var uten nag, i hans indre strålte påny forestillingen om en båt av duftende tre og et lyseblått silkeseil som var klippet i en halvmåne.","When he entered through the hotel door he had long since forgotten all his bitterness; his heart was without grudge, in his interior shone again the notion of a boat of fragrant wood and a light blue silk sail cut in a crescent moon.","When he entered the hotel, his caustic and bitter mood was gone.

"Ja, svarte Nagel. Man må jo følge skikken, ligge på landet om sommeren og holde ferie, styrke seg til vinteren og ta fatt igjen …. Det er en morsom liten by De har her.","Yes, replied Nagel. You have to follow the custom, lie in the country in the summer and take a holiday, strengthen yourself for the winter and get back on track…. It's a fun little town you have here.","“Yes,” said Nagel. “One has to follow the fashion—have a summer vacation in the country, gather strength for the winter months, and start out fresh … This is a delightful little town.”","the doctor asked. “Yes,” Nagel replied. “One has to follow custom, you know, take one’s summer holiday in the country, gather strength for the winter, and then return to work....

"Nei, men du store min! sier han, Gud bevare meg hvor jeg tar feil! Hr. Grøgaard, jeg ber Dem virkelig om tilgivelse; det er sant som De sier, De har ikke sagt det! Glem det, kjære venn, det er en annen som har sagt det og ikke De, jeg husker det nu, jeg hørte det for et par uker siden. Hvorledes kunne jeg et eneste øyeblikk tro at De kunne utlevere en dame – og fremfor alt utlevere Dem selv – på en sådan måte! Jeg forstår ikke hvorledes det kunne falle meg inn, jeg må allikevel være temmelig gal …. Hør forresten: jeg erkjenner når jeg har tatt feil og jeg ber om unnskyldning straks, altså er jeg ikke gal da; vel? Når jeg allikevel taler noe uordnet, noe vilt, så må De ikke tro at jeg gjør det med vilje, jeg vil ikke forsøke på å snakke Dem rundt, det må De ikke tro. Det ville jo være så meget umuligere som De selv nesten ikke sier et ord. Nei jeg taler altså på denne underlige, uoverlagte måte fordi min stemning er således i øyeblikket, det er hele grunnen. Unnskyld denne avvikelse fra saken. De blir kanskje utålmodig og lenges efter den forklaring?","No, but you big mine! he says, God preserve me where I am wrong! Mr Grøgaard, I truly ask for your forgiveness; it is true as you say, you have not said it! Forget it, dear friend, it's someone else who said it and not you, I remember it now, I heard it a couple of weeks ago. How could I for one moment believe that you could betray a lady - and above all betray yourself - in such a way! I do not understand how it could occur to me, I still have to be pretty crazy…. Listen by the way: I admit when I have made a mistake and I apologize immediately, so I'm not crazy then; well? When I say something disorderly, something wild, you must not think that I do it on purpose, I will not try to talk you around, you must not believe it. It would be so much more impossible that you yourself hardly say a word. No, I speak in this strange, ill-considered way because my mood is thus in the moment, that is the whole reason. Excuse this deviation from the case. Maybe they get impatient and long for that explanation?","“Good God! What have I said? Mr. Grøgaard, I’ve made a terrible mistake—please forgive me! Of course you never said that! Forget it, my friend. Someone else said that, not you! Now I remember— I heard it a couple of weeks ago. How could I possibly think you’d compromise a lady, and more than that, give yourself away so flagrantly! I can’t understand how I could have gotten that into my head. I must be mad, after all! But when I’ve made a mistake I admit it, and apologize immediately, so I can’t be mad, can I? If my thoughts are a bit confused and rambling, you mustn’t think it’s intentional; I’m not trying to befuddle you; you mustn’t think that. Besides, it would be impossible, since you hardly open your mouth and there is no way of knowing what you’re thinking. I’m ratding on like this because I happen to be in a talkative mood at the moment—that’s the only reason. Excuse this digression; you must be anxious to hear my explanation?”","“Oh, but dear me!” he says, “good heavens, what a mistake I’m making! Mr. Grøgaard, please forgive me; you’re right , you didn’t say that! Forget it, my friend, it was someone else who said it, not you, I remember it now; I heard it a couple of weeks ago. How could I think for a moment that you would compromise a lady—and above all compromise yourself—in such a way! I don’t understand how it could have occurred to me, I must be pretty mad, after all.... But look: I acknowledge it when I’ve made a mistake and apologize at once, so I can’t be mad, can I? And if, for all that, my talk is a bit disorganized, a bit wild, you mustn’t think it’s done on purpose; I’m not trying to turn your head with talk, you mustn’t think that. In any case, since you scarcely utter a word, that would be pretty impossible. No, the fact of the matter is I talk in this odd, unpremeditated way because that’s how I feel at the moment, no other reason. Pardon this digression. You’re getting impatient, anxious to hear that explanation, aren’t you?”"
"Ifjor midt på sommeren ble en liten norsk kystby skueplassen for noen høyst usedvanlige begivenheter. Det dukket opp en fremmed i byen, en viss Nagel, en merkelig og eiendommelig sjarlatan som gjorde en masse påfallende ting og som forsvant igjen like så plutselig som han var kommet. Denne mann fikk endog besøk av en ung og hemmelighetsfull dame som kom i gud vet hvilket ærend og ikke torde være på stedet mere enn i et par timer før hun reiste sin vei. Men alt dette er ikke begynnelsen ….","Last year in the middle of the summer, a small Norwegian coastal town became the scene of some very unusual events. A stranger appeared in the city, a certain Nagel, a strange and peculiar charlatan who did a lot of striking things and who disappeared again as suddenly as he had come. This man was even visited by a young and secretive lady who came in god knows what errand and did not dare be on the spot more than a couple of hours before she left. But all this is not the beginning….","IN the middle of the summer of 1891 the most extraordinary things began happening in a small Norwegian coastal town. A stranger by the name of Nagel appeared, a singular character who shook the town by his eccentric behavior and then vanished as suddenly as he had come.

Han sa:,He said:,"But her eyes were full of fire, and when she laughed, her expressive face became quite animated.",he asked.
"Jo han ville det! Og han utvikler det nærmere alt imens han sitter og holder hennes lille svake hånd i sin og regnet slår mot rutene. Han taler meget sakte, innretter seg efter hennes forestillinger og sludrer iblant det simpleste barneprat. Å de skulle nok få det til å gå! De skulle reise bort, langt bort, gud vet hvorhen; men de skulle stikke seg vekk så ingen visste hvor de var blitt av. Ikke sant, det skulle de? Så skulle de kjøpe en liten stue og en jordflekk inne i en skog, en deilig skog et eller annet sted; dette skulle så være deres egen eiendom, og de ville kalle den Eden, og han skulle dyrke den, å hvor han ville dyrke den! Men så kunne det hende at han ble litt trist stundom; kjære, det kunne hende; det kunne falle ham noe inn, en erindring, en eller annen bitter opplevelse, som han kanskje kom til å huske; hvor lett kunne ikke det skje! Men da ville hun vel være litt tålmodig mot ham; ikke? Ja for han skulle ikke la henne merke det synderlig, aldri, det skulle han love. Han ville bare få sitte i fred og tumle med det alene, eller han ville gå bort, lenger inn i skogen og komme tilbake om en stund. Å, men det skulle aldri bli ytret et hårdt ord inne i deres stue! Og de skulle pynte den med de skjønneste ville vekster og mose og stener som de kunne finne; gulvet ville de strø med ener, han skulle nok hente den hjem. Og om julen ville de alltid huske å sette et nek ut til småfuglene. Men tenk bare hvor de skulle få tiden til å gå og hvor de skulle være lykkelige også! De måtte alltid være sammen, de skulle løpe ut og inn og ikke skilles ad; om sommeren ville de gjøre lange turer og iaktta hvorledes trær og gress skalv og vokste fra år til år. Herregud, hvor de også ville gjøre det godt for fremmede og veifarende som kanskje kunne komme forbi. De måtte ha noen kreaturer, et par store, blanke dyr, som de skulle lære opp til å spise av deres hender, og mens han spadde og hakket og dyrket jorden skulle hun passe dyrene ….","Yes he wanted it! And he develops it almost everything while he sits and holds her little weak hand in his and the rain hits the windows. He speaks very slowly, conforms to her performances and chats at times the simplest child talk. Oh, they should probably make it go! They were going away, far away, god knows where; but they were to flee so that no one knew where they had gone. Right, they should? Then they would buy a small living room and a patch of land inside a forest, a lovely forest somewhere; this would then be their own property, and they would call it Eden, and he would cultivate it, oh where he would cultivate it! But then he might get a little sad at times; dear, it could happen; something could occur to him, a memory, some bitter experience, which he might remember; how easily that could not happen! But then she would probably be a little patient with him; not? Yes, because he should not let her notice it very much, never, he should promise. He just wanted to sit in peace and tumble with it alone, or he would walk away, further into the woods and come back in a while. Oh, but a harsh word should never be uttered inside their living room! And they were to decorate it with the most beautiful wild plants and moss and stones they could find; the floor they would sprinkle with juniper, he would probably bring it home. And at Christmas they would always remember to put a neck out to the little birds. But just think where they should make the time go and where they should be happy too! They always had to be together, they had to run in and out and not separate; in the summer they would make long walks and observe how trees and grass trembled and grew from year to year. My God, where they would also do good for strangers and road users who might come by. They had to have some cattle, a couple of large, shiny animals, which they were to train to eat from their hands, and while he shoveled and chopped and cultivated the land, she was to look after the animals….","Yes, he did mean it! And he went on talking and explaining, holding her delicate hand in his, while the rain beat down on the windowpanes. He talked away quietly, trying to follow her train of thought, from time to time lapsing into senseless prattle. It would work out beautifully! They would go far away—God knows where—but they would disappear and no one would be able to find them. Wouldn’t that be wonderful! They would buy a cottage and a small plot of land somewhere in the woods, and they would call it Eden. It would be a beautiful place—their very own. He would till the ground and make it yield its fruits —how he would work! But he had a tendency to get depressed at times; it could happen—a memory of an incident in the past might suddenly emerge to haunt him, it could come over him for no apparent reason. But she’d be patient with him, wouldn’t she? He would promise never to worry her. He would ask only to be left alone to work it out, or to go into the forest for a while. No harsh word would ever be spoken in their cottage. And they would fill it with the most beautiful wild-flowers, stones, and moss. The floor would be covered with juniper branches that he would gather, and at Christmas time they would not forget to put a sheaf out for the birds. How quickly time would pass and how happy they would be! They would spend their days in and around their cottage, and never be far apart from each other. In the summer they would take long walks and note how the bushes and trees grew from year to year. And they would always welcome strangers who happened to be passing by. They would have catde, a couple of big, sleek animals that they would train to eat out of their hands. While he was hoeing and tilling the ground, she would look after them …","Oh yes, he did want it! And he explains more fully, holding her delicate little hand in his and hearing the rain beat against the windowpanes. Speaking very softly, he humors her, at times indulging in the most inane, childish prattle. Oh, they would be sure to make a go of it!5 They would go away, far away, God knows where; but they would steal off so that nobody knew what had become of them. That’s what they would do, right? Then they would buy a little cottage and a plot of ground in the forest, a lovely forest someplace or other; it would be their very own and they would call it Eden, and he would cultivate it— oh, would he cultivate it! But he might get to feel a little sad from time to time; dear, yes, it was quite possible. Something might cross his mind, a recollection, some bitter experience or other that came back to him perhaps; how easily that could happen! But then she would be patient with him, wouldn’t she? Anyway, he wasn’t going to let her notice it very much, never, that he promised. He would only want to be left alone to grapple with it, or he would withdraw, go farther into the woods, and return in a little while. Oh, but no harsh word would ever be uttered in their cottage! And they would trim it with the most beautiful wildflowers and moss and stones they could find; the floor would be sprinkled with juniper he’d brought home himself. And at Christmas they would always remember to put out a sheaf for the birds. Just think how they would while the time away and how happy they would be! They must always be together; they would run in and out and never be parted. In the summer they would go on long hikes and observe the trembling grass and trees, and how they grew year after year. And how helpful they would be to strangers and wayfarers who might be passing by, yes indeed! They had to have some cattle, a couple of large, sleek animals which they would train to eat out of their hands, and while he dug and chopped and tilled the ground, she would tend the animals...."
"Vent litt, la også oss få være med! ropte fruen. Og hun fylte vin i damenes glass, skjenket over av bare ivrighet og bydde brettet rundt med skjelvende hender.","Wait a minute, let's join us too! cried the lady. And she filled wine into the ladies' glasses, poured over with only eagerness and offered the board with trembling hands.","“Let’s all join in,” cried his wife. In her excitement she filled the ladies’ glasses to overflowing, and her hands shook as she passed the tray around.","“Wait a moment, let us too be in on it!” cried his wife.

"Nu løp all hans lidenskap over. I denne stund da hun stod ham så nær, med hodet lutende over hans hånd så han følte duften av hennes hår og hals, og ikke et ord ble talt, steg hans kjærlighet til galskap, til vanvidd. Han trykket henne til seg først med den ene arm, og derpå, da hun stridde imot, også med den andre arm, klemte henne varmt og lenge inn til sitt bryst og løftet henne nesten opp fra jorden. Han følte at hennes rygg bugnet og at hun gav tapt. Tung og deilig hvilte hun i hans favn og hennes øyne så halvt sløret opp i hans. Han talte til henne, sa at hun var herlig, herlig, og at hun til hans livs ende ville bli hans kjærlighets kjærlighet. En mann var før gått i døden for henne, ja det ville også han gjøre, på det minste vink, et ord. Å hvor han elsket henne! Og han vedble å si gang efter gang mens han trykket henne ømmere og ømmere inn til seg: Jeg elsker deg, jeg elsker deg!","Now all his passion ran out. In this moment when she stood so close to him, with her head leaning over his hand so that he felt the scent of her hair and neck, and not a word was spoken, his love for madness, for madness, rose. He pressed her to him first with one arm, and then, when she resisted, also with the other arm, squeezed her warmly and long into his chest and lifted her almost up from the ground. He felt her back bulge and that she gave lost. Heavy and delicious, she rested in his arms and her eyes looked half blurred into his. He spoke to her, saying that she was glorious, glorious, and that she would be the love of his love for the rest of his life. A man had before died for her, yes he would do the same, at the very least, a word. Oh how he loved her! And he kept saying time and time again as he pushed her harder and harder into him: I love you, I love you!","Now he lost control of his emotions. She stood so close to him, with her head bending over his hand so that he caught the scent of her hair and neck, and without a word spoken between them, his passion overwhelmed him. With one arm around her, he pressed her close to him, and when she resisted, he held her tight against him with both arms, almost lifting her off her feet. He felt her back grow limp as she succumbed to his embrace. She didn’t move away but looked up at him with misty eyes. He murmured words of endearment and said that he would love her until the day he died. One man had already given his life for her, and he would do the same at only a nod, a word from her. He loved her to distraction! As he held her tighter still, he whispered tenderly: “I love you, I love you!”","Then his passion ran away with him. At this moment, when she was standing so close, her head leaning over his hand so that he could take in the fragrance of her hair and the nape of her neck, and without a word being said, his love reached the point of frenzy, of madness. He drew her close, first with one arm and then, when she resisted, with his other arm as well, pressing her long and fervently to his breast and almost lifting her off her feet. He felt her back yield, she was giving in. Heavy and delicious, she rested in his embrace, her eyes half veiled as she looked up at his. Then he spoke to her, telling her she was enchanting, and that she would be his one and only love till his dying day. One man had already given his life for her, and he would do the same, at the slightest hint, a word. Oh, how he loved her!

Med små mellomrom nyttet Nagel leiligheten til å klinke med Minutten og viste ham i det hele tatt megen oppmerksomhet hele kvelden. Ennu en gang kom han tilbake til alle sine vrøvlhistorier sist de var sammen og ville ha Minutten til å glemme dem.,From time to time Nagel used the apartment to clink with Minutes and showed him a lot of attention throughout the evening. Once again he came back to all his nonsense stories the last time they were together and wanted the Minute to forget them.,"From time to time Nagel went over to The Midget, clinked glasses with him, and was very solicitous. He repeatedly referred to his rambling at their previous meeting and asked The Midget’s forgiveness.","At brief intervals, Nagel took the opportunity of clinking glasses with Miniman; in effect, he paid great attention to him all evening.

That's the truth.","His expression again became inscrutable as he answered: “Am I rich? Yes, there seems to be a story going around town that I have money and property of some value. It just isn’t true. I don’t have any property to speak of, except for a small piece of land that I own jointly with my sister. But that’s a total loss because of debts and mortgages.

I have no estate, in any case it’s extremely small and not even all mine, since I own it jointly with my sister; besides, it’s totally eaten up by debt and all kinds of mortgages.

Pause. Han falt et øyeblikk i tanker. Så så han igjen opp og spurte:,Break. He thought for a moment. Then he looked up again and asked:,"Pause. For a moment he was silent.

Shouldn't you really come up with something better? …. Now it does not concern me, I also say it only of old…. No, what do you think I have to do for my breast? Now it's about to explode!

"Nu skifter min natt og blir som et feeventyr, en rosenrød erindring. Tenk Dem en lys, lys natt …. Jeg var alene; mørket omkring meg var tungt og tykt som fløyel. Jeg var trett, jeg skalv i knærne, jeg var også litt fortumlet. Den kjeltring av en sinnssyk som hadde ført meg i ring i flere timer i vått gress, ledet meg som et stykke kveg, bare med sitt blikk og sitt kom, kom! Neste gang river jeg lykten fra ham og knuser hans flabb med den! Jeg var dyktig forbitret, tente i sinne en cigar og gikk tilsengs. Jeg lå en liten stund og så på gloen i min cigar, så hører jeg porten slås i nedenunder og alt blir stille.","Now my night changes and becomes like a fairy tale, a rosy memory.

Next time, I'll rip the lantern from him and smash his flab with it! I was very bitter, angrily lit a cigar and went to bed. I lay for a while and looked at the glow in my cigar, then I hear the gate slam downstairs and everything becomes quiet.","“Now my night turned into a fairy tale, a lovely, golden memory.

"Jeg har en gang tidligere hatt den fornøyelse å si Dem et par ord om min metode. De spør hvorfor jeg endog plaprer ut med de av mine hemmeligheter som skader meg og som jeg kunne holde skjult? Jeg svarer: av politikk, av beregning. Jeg tenker meg nemlig muligheten av at min åpenhjertighet dog gjør litt inntrykk på Dem tross Deres benektelse. Jeg kan iallfall tenke meg at De får en viss respekt for denne skjødesløse likegladhet med å utlevere meg selv. Kanskje regner jeg feil, det er nok mulig, det er det ingen råd med da. Men selv om jeg regner feil er De jo allikevel tapt og jeg setter intet mere til. Til dette punkt kan man komme, det er desperasjonen, hasarden. Jeg hjelper Dem selv til å skaffe anklager tilveie mot meg og styrker Dem derved efter ringe evne i Deres forsett å vise meg vekk, bare vekk. Hvorfor gjør jeg det? Fordi det byr min ringe sjel imot å tale til min egen fordel og vinne noe ved den slags tarvelighet, jeg kunne ikke få det over mine lepper. Men – kan De si – jeg søker således å oppnå det samme ved snedighet og omveier hva andre vil oppnå ved tarvelig likefremhet? Akk …. Nei jeg vil forresten ikke forsvare meg. Kall det humbug, hvorfor ikke, det er godt, det er treffende; jeg vil selv legge til at det er det mest lurvete falskneri. Godt, det er altså humbug og jeg forsvarer meg ikke, De har rett, mitt hele vesen er humbug. Men nu holder humbugen i mere eller mindre grad alle mennesker fanget, kan så ikke den ene sort humbug være like så god som en annen sort når det hele dog er humbug i sitt innerste? …. Jeg føler at jeg begynner å komme i ess, jeg er ikke uvillig til å ri en av mine kjepphester et øyeblikk …. Nei det vil jeg ikke forresten; Herregud i himmelen hvor jeg er trett av det altsammen! Jeg sier: la gå, la bare gå: Punktum …. Hvem skulle nu tro at det var noe galt fatt i for eksempel doktor Stenersens hus? Jeg sier heller ikke at det er noe galt fatt, derfor spør jeg også bare om det kunne falle noe menneske inn å tro noe galt om den aktverdige familie. Det er bare to personer, mann og kone, ingen barn, ingen alvorlige sorger, og allikevel er det kanskje en tredje person, Gud alene vet det, men kanskje er det når alt kommer til alt en person til, foruten mannen og konen, et ungt menneske, en altfor varm venn av huset, fullmektig Reinert. Hva skal man si? Det er kanskje feil på begge sider. Doktoren kan attpå kjøpet selv være vitende om det hele og allikevel ikke kunne gjøre noe ved det, i det minste drakk han voldsomt inatt og var så likeglad med alt, med allverden, at han foreslo menneskehetens totale utryddelse ved blåsyre, på det at rullan måtte gå. Stakkars mann! …. Men han er knapt den eneste som står tilknes i humbug, selv om jeg fraregner meg – Nagel – som står i humbug til midt på livet. Om jeg for eksempel nevnte Minutten? En kjær sjel, en rettferdig, en martyr! Alt godt er på hans side; men jeg har ham i kikkerten. Jeg sier Dem, jeg har ham i kikkerten! Det later til å forbause Dem? Har jeg forskrekket Dem? Det var ikke meningen. La meg også straks berolige Dem med at Minutten kan ingen rugge, han er sannelig rettferdig. Og hvorfor slipper jeg ham så ikke avsyne, hvorfor iakttar jeg ham klokken to om natten fra et hushjørne når han kommer hjem fra en uskyldig spasertur – klokken to om natten? Hvorfor spionerer jeg ham ut forfra og bakfra når han bærer sine sekker omkring og hilser på folk i gatene? For intet, kjære Dem, for intet! Han interesserer meg bare, jeg holder av ham og det gleder meg i dette øyeblikk å kunne stille ham opp som det rene menneske og den rettferdige midt i all den øvrige humbug. Derfor er det jo at jeg nevner ham og De forstår meg ganske sikkert. Hehehe …. Men for å komme tilbake til meg selv …. Ånei, nei jeg vil slett ikke komme tilbake til meg selv, jeg vil heller alt annet!","I have once before had the pleasure of telling you a few words about my method. They ask why I even chat with those of my secrets that hurt me and that I could keep hidden? I answer: by politics, by calculation. I imagine the possibility that my openness, however, makes a little impression on you despite your denial. At least I can imagine that you get some respect for this careless indifference to betraying myself. Maybe I'm miscalculating, it's probably possible, there is no way to afford it then. But even if I calculate incorrectly, you are still lost and I add nothing more. To this point one can come, it is desperation, chance. I help you to bring charges against me and thereby strengthen you to a small extent in your intent to show me away, just away. Why do I do that? Because my reluctant soul refuses to speak in my own favor and win something by that kind of triviality, I could not get it over my lips. But - can you say - I am thus seeking to achieve the same by cunning and detouring what others will achieve by meager equality? Akk…. No, by the way, I do not want to defend myself. Call it a hoax, why not, it's good, it's apt; I would even add that it is the most shabby forgery. Well, it's a hoax and I'm not defending myself, you're right, my whole being is a hoax. But now the hoax to a greater or lesser degree keeps all people trapped, so can not one black hoax be as good as another variety when it is all a hoax at its core? …. I feel like I'm starting to get ace, I'm not reluctant to ride one of my fads for a moment…. No, I do not want that by the way; My God in heaven where I'm tired of it all! I say: let go, just let go: period…. Who would now think that there was something wrong with, for example, Doctor Stenersen's house? Nor do I say that something is wrong, so I also just ask if it could occur to any human being to believe something wrong about the venerable family. There are only two people, husband and wife, no children, no serious sorrows, and yet there may be a third person, God alone knows it, but maybe it is after all another person, besides the husband and wife, a young man, an overly warm friend of the house, attorney Reinert. What can you say? There may be mistakes on both sides. The doctor may even be aware of the whole thing and still not be able to do anything about it, at least he drank heavily last night and was so indifferent to everything, with the whole world, that he suggested humanity's total extinction by hydrocyanic acid, that the roll had to go. Poor man! …. But he is hardly the only one who is deceived, even though I exclude myself - Nagel - who is deceived until the middle of life. For example, if I mentioned Minutes? A dear soul, a righteous, a martyr! All good is on his side; but I have him in my binoculars. I tell you, I have him in my binoculars! It seems to amaze you? Have I startled you? I did not mean. Let me also immediately reassure you that no one can rock the Minute, he is truly fair. And why do I not let him see, why do I watch him at two o'clock at night from a corner of the house when he comes home from an innocent walk - at two o'clock at night? Why do I spy on him from the front and back when he carries his bags around and greets people in the streets? For nothing, dear ones, for nothing! He only interests me, I love him and I am happy at this moment to be able to present him as the pure man and the righteous in the midst of all the other hoaxes. That's why I mention him and you certainly understand me. Hehehe…. But to get back to myself…. No, no I do not want to come back to myself at all, I would rather everything else!","Once before, you were kind enough to listen to me when I told you what my aims were. You ask why I still make confessions that put me in a bad light, confessions I could easily have kept to myself? My answer is that it’s part of the scheme—I’m doing it deliberately. I’m hoping, despite your remarks to the contrary, that my complete frankness will make some impression on you. Anyway, perhaps you’ll feel a certain respect for my utter honesty. Maybe I’m wrong, but I couldn’t have acted otherwise. Even if I could, you’re beyond reach and I’ve got nothing to lose. I am taking a last desperate chance. I provide you with strong arguments against me and so help you in your determination to send me away. Why do I do it? Because my wretched soul won’t let me plead my own case and profit by such cheap means. I just couldn’t do it. But perhaps you feel that I’m trying to achieve by guileful and devious means something that others gain by being bold and straightforward? No, I won’t even bother to defend myself. Call it fraud if you like. Why not? That’s the word for it. To put it stronger still, it’s the lowest kind of deception. All right, I don’t deny it. I am a phony. But we’re all phony to a greater or lesser extent; since that is a fact, one form of deceit is no worse than another. “I’m feeling in the mood to talk —I’d like to speak frankly for a moment. On second thought, no. Good God, how sick I am of everything! If only there were a way of getting out! Incidentally, who would ever have supposed that there’s anything wrong with the Stenersen marriage? I’m not saying that there is anything wrong in that respectable household , you understand; I’m just wondering if the thought would ever occur to anyone. There are only the two of them, no children, no major problems, but there may be a third person involved—who knows? Perhaps a young man who’s become too intimate a friend—I’m speaking of Reinert, the deputy. Who are we to judge? There are probably faults on both sides. Maybe the doctor is aware of the situation but powerless to do anything about it. Anyway, he drank a great deal last night and was so fed up with everything and everybody that he prescribed prussic acid for the whole human race and to hell with everything! Poor man! But he isn’t the only one who’s knee-deep in hypocrisy, even if I exclude myself—Nagel—because I’m up to my waist in it. And what about The Midget—a kind and just man, a martyr! He is a good soul, but I’m keeping an eye on him —I’m watching him. I’m telling you, I have my eye on him! You seem surprised. Did I shock you? I didn’t mean to. Let me reassure you; The Midget can’t be corrupted. He is a completely honest man. Then why don’t I let him out of my sight? Why do I spy on him from around a corner at two o’clock in the morning when he comes home from an innocent walk—at 2 A.M.? And why do I keep my eyes peeled when he carries his sacks of coal around, greeting people in the street? No reason whatever. He just happens to interest me, that’s all. I like him, and at the moment he represents truth and righteousness in the midst of all this phoniness. That’s why I mentioned him, and I’m sure you understand what I mean. But to come back to myself—no, I don’t want to come back to myself, anything but that!”","He continued, “I had the pleasure of telling you a few things about my method once before. You ask me why I even let out secrets which are damaging to me and could have been kept hidden. I reply, As a matter of policy, out of calculation. You see, I bank on the possibility that my candor will make some impression on you, despite your denial. Anyway, I can well imagine you might feel a certain respect for the devil-may-care nonchalance with which I give myself away. Maybe I’m making a mistake, that’s possible, then it can’t be helped. But even if I’m making a mistake, you’re still lost to me and I have nothing more to lose. One can get to such a pass that one becomes desperate and takes a gamble. I help you to contrive accusations against me and thus do my humble best to strengthen you in your resolve to send me away, always away. Why do I do it? Because it goes against the grain of my humble soul to speak in my own favor and to profit by that kind of shabbiness, I couldn’t make it pass my lips. But—you might say—I try in this way to achieve by cunning and devious means what others achieve by a shabby directness? Ah—. However, I won’t defend myself. Call it humbug, why not? That’s fine, very apt; I’ll even add that it is the crudest sort of fakery. All right, so it’s humbug, and I don’t defend myself ; you’re right, my whole nature is humbug. But, you know, everyone is more or less caught up in humbug, so may not one kind of humbug be just as good as another, since at bottom it’s all humbug anyway? ... I feel I’m getting into my element, I have nothing against riding one of my hobbyhorses for a moment. However, I won’t; good heavens, how tired I am of it all! I say, Let it pass, just let it pass, period.... Now, who would suspect, for instance, there was anything wrong with the Stenersens? I’m not saying there is anything wrong, and therefore I also merely ask if it would occur to anyone to suspect there was something wrong with that respectable family. There are only the two of them, man and wife, no children, no serious worries, and yet there may be a third person. God only knows, but perhaps when all is said and done there is one more person, besides the man and wife, a young person, a much too warm friend of the family, Mr. Reinert, the deputy. Well, what can one make of it? There may be faults on both sides. The doctor may even be wise to the situation and yet be powerless to do anything about it. In any case, he drank hard last night and showed such a devil-may-care attitude to everything, to the whole world, that he proposed the human race should exterminate itself with Prussic acid and let the show go on. Poor man! ... But he’s hardly the only one who is knee-deep in humbug, even if I exclude myself, Nagel, who is steeped in humbug to the waist. What if I mentioned Miniman, for example? A dear soul, a just man, a martyr! Everything that’s good is on his side, but I’ve got my eye on him. I’m telling you, I’ve got my eye on him! You appear to be surprised? Have I alarmed you? I didn’t mean to. Anyway, let me set your mind at rest at once by saying that nobody can get at Miniman , he’s truly righteous. Then why don’t I let him out of my sight? Why do I watch him from around the corner at two o’clock in the morning when he returns home from an innocent walk—at two in the morning? Why do I snoop on him from front and back when he carries his sacks around and greets people in the street? For no reason, bless me, no reason! He just interests me, I like him, and I’m very happy right now to be able to present him as someone pure and just in the midst of all the humbug otherwise. That’s why I mentioned him, and I’m quite sure you understand. Heh-heh-heh.... But to come back to myself—. Well, no, I don’t really want to come back to myself, anything but that!”"
Minutten ser mot jorden og svarer:,The minute looks at the ground and answers:,The Midget looked down and said: “Yes.”,"Miniman looks at the ground and answers, “Yes.”"

But already tonight Minuten was to put up posters in all sorts of places; one had even been allowed to stick one up on the cemetery gate…. By the way, he had come to inform about that violin.

That evening The Midget was going to start putting up posters all over. They even had permission to put one up by the cemetery gate. But his reason for coming was to report on the violin.

It belonged to the organist, who needed it for the bazaar; he was going to play a few selections.","It would open on Thursday, July 9, which was the Queen’s birthday.

Dagny lo.,Dagny lo.,Dagny laughed.,Dagny laughed.
"For noen dager siden? La meg se, var det for vel en uke siden? Så var det for frøken Kiellands forlovelse, Dagny Kiellands forlovelse. Å ja den ene efter den andre forlover seg og gifter seg og reiser bort. Jeg har venner og bekjente snartsagt over det hele land nu og det er ingen av dem jeg ikke ville møte igjen. Jeg har sett dem leke og gå på skolen og konfirmeres og bli voksne allesammen. Dagny var bare tre og tyve år og hun var hele byens barn. Hun var også pen. Hun ble forlovet med løytnant Hansen som i sin tid har forært meg denne selvsamme lue som jeg har her. Han er også herfra.","A few days ago? Let me see, was it about a week ago? Then it was for Miss Kielland's engagement, Dagny Kielland's engagement. Oh yes one after the other get engaged and get married and travel away. I have friends and acquaintances all over the country soon now and there are none of them I would not meet again. I have seen them play and go to school and be confirmed and grow up all together. Dagny was only twenty-three years old and she was the whole city's child. She was pretty too. She became engaged to Lieutenant Hansen who in his time has given me this very hat I have here. He's from here too.","“A few days ago? About a week ago? That must have been for Miss Kielland’s engagement—Dagny Kielland. They all get engaged, married, and leave town, one after the other.

"Unnskyld, svarer Minutten, bli ikke misfornøyd; men jeg vil gjerne gå hvis De synes så. De holder kanskje på meg her for å gjøre meg en glede skjønt De selv ingen fornøyelse kan ha av å høre om mine omstendigheter. Det kan også være at De taler med meg av en annen grunn som jeg ikke forstår, og i så fall er det godt. Men om jeg også går er det ingen som forulemper meg, det må De ikke tro. Jeg treffer egentlig ingen illesinnede mennesker. Fullmektigen står ikke og passer meg opp utenfor døren for å hevne seg, hvis det er det De frykter for. Og selv om han stod der ville han i ethvert tilfelle ikke fortredige meg, det tror jeg ikke.","Sorry, Minute replies, do not be dissatisfied; but I would like to go if you think so. They may be holding me here to make me happy, although they themselves can have no pleasure in hearing about my circumstances. It may also be that you are talking to me for another reason that I do not understand, and in that case it is good. But if I also go, no one will offend me, you must not believe it. I do not really meet any malicious people. The clerk is not standing and looking after me outside the door to take revenge, if that's what you're afraid of. And even if he stood there, he would not represent me in any case, I do not think so.","“Please don’t be offended, but I’m ready to leave whenever you wish. Maybe you asked me here out of kindness, although I can’t see how my affairs could be of interest to you. Or perhaps you’re talking to me for some reason which escapes me— if so, I don’t mind. But you mustn’t think that someone will bother me when I leave here. I never really have trouble with unkind people. The deputy won’t be waiting outside the door to take revenge if that’s what’s worrying you—and even if he were there, I don’t think he would do me any harm.”","“Pardon me,” Miniman answers, “don’t take it amiss, but I’ll gladly leave if you want me to.6 Perhaps you’re detaining me here to do me a kindness, since I don’t see how you can take any pleasure in hearing about my situation. Or maybe you’re talking to me for some other reason that escapes me, and if so it’s all right. But nobody would molest me if I were to leave now, you mustn’t think that. I don’t really meet any ill-natured people. The deputy won’t be lurking behind the door to take revenge, if that’s what you’re afraid of.

Da Johan Nagel ved nitiden kom inn i festsalen var huset fullt. Han fant seg en plass lengst nede ved døren hvor han stod i noen minutter og hørte på en tale.

Vet De, jeg er endelig med megen anstrengelse kommet i besiddelse av et stykke møbel som ingen samler i landet har maken til, det er jeg sikker på; det er denne stolen her. Se på den! Forstår De Dem på en perle, en aldeles enestående hollender? Jeg selger den ikke for en formue, ved Gud om jeg gjør! Og i den anledning ville jeg så gjerne drikke et glass med Dem hvis De ikke har noe imot det. Må jeg ringe? Ikke? Men de plakater kan De jo slå opp imorgen …. Nei jeg kan slett ikke glemme mitt store hell idag! De vet kanskje ikke at jeg er samler efter fattig leilighet og at jeg oppholder meg her også for å snuse opp sjeldenheter! Jeg har kanskje heller ikke fortalt Dem om mine kubjeller? Nei men herregud, så har De jo ikke noe begrep om hva jeg er for en mann. Naturligvis er jeg agronom, men jeg har jo også mine interesser ved siden av. Jo jeg har til dato to hundre og syv og seksti kubjeller. Det er ti år siden jeg begynte å bringe dem sammen og nu har jeg gudskjelov en samling av høy rang. Og denne stol her, vet De hvorledes jeg fikk kloen i den? Tilfeldighet, svinehell! Jeg går på gaten en dag, jeg passerer et lite hus nede ved kaien, og av gammel vane kikker jeg litt på snei inn gjennom vinduet idet jeg går forbi. Så holder jeg med én gang inne, jeg får øye på stolen og ser straks hva den er verd. Jeg banker på og går inn i huset, en aldrende, hvithåret dame tar imot meg …. ja hva var det nu hun hette? Nå det kan også være det samme, De kjenner henne kanskje ikke allikevel; frøken Gude var det visst, Martha Gude eller slikt noe …. Vel, hun vegrer seg ved å bli av med stolen, men så lenge lirker jeg jo at jeg får et bestemt løfte på den, og idag henter jeg den så til meg. Men det beste av alt er at jeg har fått den for intet, hun gav meg den gratis. Ja jeg slengte jo et par kroner på bordet for at hun ikke skulle ha noe å angre; men stolen er verd hundrer. Dette ber jeg Dem om å beholde for Dem selv; man vil jo nødig få et dårlig ord på seg. Jeg har heller intet å bebreide meg. Den frøken forstod seg ikke på handelen og jeg som var fagmann og kjøper hadde ingen forpliktelse på meg til å se på hennes fordel. Ikke sant, man skal dog ikke være dum, man skal passe sitt snitt, det er kampen for tilværelsen …. Men kan De så avslå å drikke et glass vin når De hører hvorledes det henger sammen?","But should we not take a quiet cup? I'll tell you I'm a little happy tonight, something happy has happened to me. You know, I'll finally, with a lot of effort, come into possession of a piece of furniture that no collector in the country has like, I'm sure; it's this chair here. Look at that! Do you understand yourself on a gem, a completely unique Dutchman? I do not sell it for a fortune, by God if I do! And on that occasion, I would like to drink a glass with you if you do not mind. Do I have to call? Not? But you can put up those posters tomorrow…. No I can not forget my great luck today! They may not know that I'm a collector for a poor apartment and that I'm staying here too to sniff out rarities! I may not have told you about my cube bells either? No, my God, you have no idea what a man I am. Of course I am an agronomist, but I also have my interests next to it. Yes, to date I have two hundred and sixty-seven cube bells. It's been ten years since I started bringing them together and now thank God I have a collection of high rank. And this chair here, do you know how I got the claw in it? Coincidence, pig hell! I walk on the street one day, I pass a small house down by the quay, and out of old habit I look a little slanting in through the window as I walk past. Then I immediately hold on, I spot the chair and immediately see what it is worth. I knock and go into the house, an aging, white-haired lady receives me…. yes what was her name now? Now it can also be the same, You may not know her anyway; Miss Gude was it, Martha Gude or something like that…. Well, she refuses to get rid of the chair, but as long as I pry that I get a certain promise on it, and today I then pick it up for me. But best of all is that I got it for free, she gave it to me for free. Yes, I threw a couple of kroner on the table so that she would have nothing to regret; but the chair is worth hundreds. I ask you to keep this to yourself; you do not want to get a bad word in you. I also have nothing to blame. That miss did not understand the trade and I, who was a professional and a buyer, had no obligation on me to look at her advantage. Not true, however, one should not be stupid, one should take care of one's cut, it is the struggle for existence…. But can you then refuse to drink a glass of wine when you hear how it is connected?","I’ve had a stroke of luck and I’m in a very good mood this evening. After a great deal of trouble I’ve acquired a chair that no collector in this country can match. Have a look at it! Do you know a treasure when you see one? It’s Dutch—the workmanship is unique. I wouldn’t sell it for anything! I would like to celebrate by having a drink with you. Shall I ring? No? But you can put up those posters tomorrow! I can’t stop thinking how lucky I was today. Perhaps you didn’t know that I’m something of a collector and that I’m here to see what I can find. Have I told you about my cowbells? Well, I see you don’t know anything about me. I’m an agronomist, of course, but I have other interests as well. Thus far I’ve collected two hundred and sixty-seven cowbells. I began ten years ago and now, I’m happy to say , I have a very fine collection. And do you know how I came upon this chair? It was pure luck. One day when I was walking along the street, I happened to pass a small house down by the docks, and as I went by, I looked in the window without thinking. What I saw made me stop in my tracks. The chair was there and I immediately realized its value. I knocked at the door and a white-haired lady of a certain age answered—what was her name? I’ve forgotten. Well, it doesn’t matter. You probably don’t know her. Miss Gude, I think it was—Martha Gude, or something like that … anyway, she didn’t want to part with the chair. But I worked on her until I got her to promise to let me have it, and today I went to fetch it. But, can you imagine, I got it for nothing—she gave it to me! Of course I put a couple of crowns on the table to keep her from having any regrets, but the chair is worth hundreds. Please don’t mention this to anybody; I don’t want to get a bad reputation around here—not that I have anything to reproach myself for. The lady didn’t understand the value of the piece, and since I’m a connoisseur and a buyer, I didn’t feel it was up to me to look out for her interests. One must use one’s head, take advantage of every opportunity—the age-old struggle for survival, you know … But surely you can’t refuse to drink a glass of wine with me, now that you know the story?”","As he stands there cap in hand, Nagel says, “But shouldn’t we have a little drink? You see, I’m sort of happy this evening, I’ve been lucky. Imagine, I’ve finally with great pains got possession of a piece of furniture which no collector in this country can match, of that I’m sure. It’s this chair. Take a look at it! Do you realize what a gem it is, a perfectly unique Dutch piece! I wouldn’t sell it for a fortune, by Jove I wouldn’t! To celebrate the occasion, I would very much like to have a drink with you, if you don’t mind. May I ring? No? But you can put up those posters tomorrow.... Oh, I simply can’t forget my good luck today! You don’t know, perhaps, that I am a collector in a small way and that one reason I’m staying here is to sniff out rarities? I probably haven’t told you about my cowbells either? Oh dear, then you don’t have any idea what sort of person I am. I’m an agronomist, of course, but I also have other interests. Anyway, as of today I’ve got two hundred and sixty-seven cowbells. It has been ten years since I began to acquire them, and now, thank God, I have a first-rate collection. And this chair here, can you guess how I got hold of it? Pure chance, a fluke! Walking along the street one day, I pass a little house down by the docks, and by force of habit I give a sidelong peek through the window as I go by. Suddenly I’m pulled up : I catch sight of the chair and see at once what it’s worth. I knock on the door and go in: I’m received by a white-haired lady getting on in years—uh, what was her name? Well, no matter, you probably don’t know her in any case; Miss Gude I believe it was. Martha Gude or something.... She doesn’t want to let go of the chair, of course, but I wangle so long that she finally gives her word I can have it, and today I picked it up. But the best part of it is that I got it for nothing, she gave it to me for free. Well, I threw a few kroner on the table so she wouldn’t have any regrets; but the chair is worth hundreds. I urge you to keep this to yourself; one would rather not get a bad name. Not that I have anything to reproach myself with. The woman had no business sense, but I, the expert buyer, was under no obligation to keep her interest in mind. One mustn’t be stupid, after all, one has to seize one’s chance , it’s the struggle for existence, right? ... Now that you know the truth of the matter, how can you refuse to have a glass of wine with me?”"
Ja hva tror De?,"Yes, what do you think?",Then he burst into laughter and asked: “What do you think?”,"Well, what do you think?”13"

Yes he swam too well, he might want to float up again and save himself.

Yes, he was a good swimmer; he would probably come up again and would be saved.

Nå, men nu blir altså det hele kullkastet ved Deres benektelse. Jeg ville gjerne ha utfrittet Dem litt mere om dette, det interesserte meg, og jeg har tenkt på det ofte; men når De fragår å ha sagt det så!

"Men Nagel fant på å tale om den ene ting efter den andre uten hell; Dagny hørte knapt på hva han sa. Han ble taus, han tenkte seg om. Var det ikke også fan hvor han kunne snakke dumt og gjøre seg til narr til enhver tid! Overfalle en ung dame, til og med sin hjertes dame, med snakk om frostblemmer og fire og tyve vogner! Og han husket plutselig at han også engang før hadde forløpet seg grundig med en flauhet om en eskimo og en brevmappe. Ved denne erindring ble han med ett het i kinnene, han gjorde uvilkårlig et rykk på seg og hadde nær stanset opp. Hvorfor satan tok han seg ikke i akt! Å hvor han måtte skamme seg! Disse øyeblikk han vrøvlet så dumt gjorde ham komisk, ydmyket ham og satte ham uker og måneder tilbake. Hva måtte hun nemlig tenke om ham!","But Nagel managed to talk about one thing after another without success; Dagny barely listened to what he was saying. He became silent, he thought about it. Wasn't he also a fan where he could talk stupid and make fun of himself at all times! Assault a young lady, even the lady of her heart, talking about frost blisters and twenty-four wagons! And he suddenly remembered that even before that he had gone through a lot of embarrassment about an Eskimo and a letter folder. At this recollection he became suddenly hot in the cheeks, he involuntarily made a jerk on himself and had almost stopped. Why satan did he not heed! Oh how he had to be ashamed! Those moments he nonsense so stupid made him comical, humiliated him and put him back weeks and months. What did she have to think about him!","Nagel embarked on one subject after another, but Dagny scarcely listened. Finally he stopped talking and was silent. Damn it, why was he always making a fool of himself, letting his tongue run away with him! To rant on to a young lady—one whom he loved—about frostbite and twenty-four carriages! Then he recalled that once before he had made a fool of himself with a stupid story about an Eskimo and a blotter. His cheeks flushed at the thought. He made an abrupt movement and almost stopped walking. Why the hell did he have to rattle on like that? God, he was ashamed of himself! These sudden streaks of rambling humiliated him, made him ridiculous, set him back weeks and months. What must she think of him!","But Nagel dreamed up one subject after another without any success; Dagny was barely listening to what he said. He fell silent, considering for a moment. Why the hell did he have to talk so stupidly, making a fool of himself all the time! To assault a young lady, the queen of his heart at that, with idle talk about cold blisters and twenty-four carriages! Suddenly he remembered that he had also forgotten himself badly once before, telling a stale joke about an Eskimo and a letter case. His cheeks flushed at the recollection; he gave a start and almost came to a stop. Why the hell didn’t he watch out! Oh, he ought to be ashamed of himself! These moments when he jabbered away so stupidly made him look ridiculous; they humiliated him and set him back weeks and months. What mustn’t she think of him!"

"Nagel så på ham, tok hans hånd og trykket den uten å si noe. De så på hverandre begge to; Nagels munn bevet en smule.","Nagel looked at him, took his hand and pressed it without saying anything.

"På den måten naturligvis at hun idelig bærer over med meg. På annen måte kan det jo ikke være. Jeg er nu og da på prestegården når jeg blir buden, og såvidt jeg har kunnet forstå har jeg heller ikke vært uvelkommen endog når jeg har gått dit ubuden. Frøken Dagny lånte meg også bøker da jeg var syk, ja hun kom selv herut med dem, bar dem hele veien under armen.","In the way, of course, that she constantly carries over with me. It can not be otherwise. I am now and then at the rectory when I am invited, and as far as I have been able to understand, I have not been unwelcome even when I have gone there uninvited.

Sometimes I go to the parsonage when I’m invited, but even when I’m not, I never have the feeling that I am unwelcome.

"Og atter overbeviste han henne om at han ville det, ja ville det med all den vilje han eiet. Hun skulle ikke komme til å lide nød selv om det gikk galt for dem en tid; han ville streve for dem begge, hun skulle ingen frykt ha. Han talte en hel time igjennom og rokket stykke for stykke hennes motstand. To ganger gjentok det seg i denne time at hun vegret seg, holdt hendene for ansiktet og begynte å rope nei, nei, og allikevel gav hun efter for ham, studerte hans ansikt og skjønte at det ikke var en blott og bar øyeblikkelig seier han ville vinne. I Guds navn da, når han ville det så! Hun var overvunnet, det nyttet henne ikke lenger å stri imot. Tilsist gav hun ham et rent ja.","And again he convinced her that he wanted it, yes he wanted it with all the will he owned. She was not going to suffer hardship even if things went wrong for them for a while; he would strive for both of them, she should have no fear. He talked for an entire hour and rocked her resistance piece by piece. Twice in this hour it was repeated that she refused, held her hands to her face and began to shout no, no, and yet she gave in to him, studying his face and realizing that it was not a mere and immediate victory he wanted win. In the name of God then, when he wanted it so! She was defeated, it was no longer useful for her to fight back. Finally, she gave him a clean yes.","And again he convinced her that he wanted her, that he meant every word he said, that he wanted her more than he had ever wanted anything. He would always take good care of her, but of course they would need some time to get on their feet; she mustn’t worry—he would work for both of them. He talked for an hour, and little by litde he broke down her resistance. Twice she backed down, hid her face in her hands, and cried, “No, no!” But in the end she surrendered. She looked into his eyes and convinced herself that it wasn’t a momentary triumph he was after. Could it be possible that he really wanted her! She yielded; she couldn’t fight it any more. Finally she said yes to him.","And again he convinced her that he wanted it, wanted it, in fact, as much as he could ever want anything. She wasn’t going to suffer privation even if things didn’t pan out for a while; he would toil for them both, she need have no fear. He talked for a whole hour, shaking her resistance bit by bit. Twice during this hour she refused to go along, covering her face with her hands and crying, “No, no!” And yet she gave in to him; studying his face, she understood that he didn’t merely want to win a momentary victory. In God’s name, then, since he wanted it that way! She was conquered, it was no use to fight him anymore. In the end she gave him a clear yes."
"Ikke sant, den så godt ut? Og de tre bokstaver i bitte små kapprubiner her øverst oppe på gripbrettet, de betydde Gustav Adolf Christensen. Nei å selge en sådan ting det var synd; hva skulle man så ha å glede seg ved når dagene ble lange? En annen sak var det hvis det bare var tale om å prøve den et øyeblikk, gjøre et strøk eller to ….","Right, it looked good? And the three letters in tiny little robes here at the top of the fingerboard, they meant Gustav Adolf Christensen. No to sell such a thing it was a shame; so what should one have to look forward to when the days get long? It was a different matter if it was just a matter of trying it for a moment, doing a stroke or two….","It was a marvel, wasn’t it? Those three initials set with rubies on the fingerboard stood for Gustav Adolf Christensen. To sell it would be out of the question. What would he have to comfort him in his old age? But Nagel was quite welcome to try it out—play a few notes on it.","It looked nice, didn’t it? And the three initials in tiny little Cape rubies here at the upper end of the fingerboard stood for Gustav Adolf Christensen. No, it would be wrong to sell a thing like that! What would then be left to be happy about on days when time hung heavy on one’s hands? It was something else if it was only a question of trying it out for a moment, making a stroke or two—."
"Det er kjedelig, fortsetter Nagel. Jeg hadde gledet meg til å få en passiar med Dem. De er det eneste mannfolk på stedet som min interesse vekkes for såsnart jeg ser Dem, den eneste som jeg så å si bryr meg om å holde et lite øye med. Hehe, holde øye med, altså. De heter jo attpå kjøpet Johannes? Min kjære venn, det har jeg visst lenge, uten at noen har fortalt meg det før iaften …. Ja la meg nu bare ikke skremme Dem igjen. Det er dog en skammelig ulykke ved meg at jeg alltid gjør folk redd for meg. Jo nekt det ikke, De stirret virkelig litt forferdet på meg et øyeblikk, uten at jeg just vil si at det også gikk et rykk gjennom Dem ….","It's boring, Nagel continues. I was looking forward to having a passiar with you. They're the only men in the place that pique my interest as soon as I see you, the only one I care about, so to speak. Hehe, keep an eye out, that is. They are called Johannes after the purchase? My dear friend, I have known that for a long time, without anyone telling me before tonight…. Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. However, it is a shameful misfortune for me that I always make people afraid of me. I do not deny it, you really stared at me a little terrified for a moment, without I just want to say that there was also a jerk through you….","“I’m sorry,” said Nagel. “I had been looking forward to having a talk with you. You’re the only man around here who interests me—the only one worth keeping an eye on—keeping an eye on, I said, ha ha. And your name is Johannes? My dear friend, I’ve known it all along, though no one had told me until tonight. But don’t let me frighten you. Unfortunately, I always seem to scare people. You looked terrified just now, though you tried to hide it.”","“That’s too bad,” Nagel continues. “I’d been looking forward to having a chat with you. You’re the only man in this place who interested me at first sight, the only one I care to keep an eye on, as it were. Heh-heh, keep an eye on, sure. Besides, your name is Johannes, isn’t it? My dear friend, that I’ve known a long time, though no one told me until this evening.... Now, don’t let me frighten you again. To my shame, I always have the misfortune to make people afraid of me. Oh yes, don’t deny it, you did stare in dismay at me for a moment, though I won’t exactly say you gave a start....”"
"Og dette sa hun uten å være nødt dertil, av fri vilje, umiddelbart, som om det var henne en glede å si det. Nagel så henne oppmerksomt inn i ansiktet og fikk vann på sin mølle igjen. Nervøst, impulsivt begynte han å legge ut om sankthansnatten, at skogen stod og vugget og suset, vugget og suset, at den gryende dag derborte gjorde en forandring med ham, bragte andre makter til herredømmet i hans indre. Grundtvig synger: «Det kjendes paa os som Lysets Børn at Natten den nu er omme!» – Men hvis han snakket formeget så kunne han kanskje heller vise henne et lite kunststykke med et strå og en kvist, hvorved strået ble sterkere enn kvisten. Alt ville han gjøre for henne …. Se der, la meg bare peke på den minste ting som gjør inntrykk på meg, den enlige enerklynge derborte. Den formelig bøyer seg imot oss og ser god ut. Og fra furu til furu spenner edderkoppen sine vever; de ligner slikt noe merkelig kinesisk arbeide, ligner soler, spunnet av vann. De fryser vel ikke? Jeg er sikker på at det danser varme, leende alvejenter om oss nu; men jeg vil allikevel tenne opp en nying hvis De fryser …. Det faller meg nettopp inn: var det ikke her i nærheten Karlsen ble funnet?","And she said this without having to do it, of her own free will, immediately, as if it were her pleasure to say so. Nagel looked her intently in the face and got water on his mill again. Nervously, impulsively, he began to lay out on the night of Sankthans, that the forest stood and rocked and hissed, rocked and hissed, that the dawning day over there made a change with him, brought other powers to the dominion within him. Grundtvig sings: ""It is known to us as the children of light that the night is now over!"" - But if he spoke shapely, he might rather show her a small piece of art with a straw and a twig, whereby the straw became stronger than the twig. Everything he wanted to do for her…. Look, let me just point out the smallest thing that impresses me, the lone cluster over there. It formally bends towards us and looks good. And from pine to pine the spider stretches its webs; they look like some strange Chinese work, look like suns, spun by water. They do not freeze, do they? I'm sure hot, laughing elves are dancing around us now; but I will still light a new one if you freeze…. It just occurs to me: was not it here near Karlsen was found?","She said it impulsively, spontaneously, as if she had a need to express herself. Nagel looked at her intently and again began talking. Nervously, he launched headlong into a monologue about Midsummer Eve; he said the trees were swaying and murmuring; that the coming of dawn was doing something strange to him, bringing him under the spell of magic powers. As Grundtvig expressed it in song: “We are children of light, and now for us the night is over!” But, instead of talking so much, maybe he could show her a trick with a straw and a twig, to prove that the straw was stronger than the twig. There wasn’t anything he wouldn’t do for her … “Look over there at that lonely juniper bush—sometimes the most insignificant thing catches my fancy. It seems to be bowing to us so friendlily. And the spider spins its web from tree to tree. It looks like a Chinese design, like suns spun out of water. You’re not cold, are you? I’m sure we’re surrounded by warm and smiling dancing elves at this very moment— but if you’re cold, I’ll make a fire. Incidentally, it just occurred to me— wasn’t Karlsen found somewhere near here?”","She said this without being obliged to, of her own free will, spontaneously, as if it were a pleasure to say it.21 A close look at her face gave Nagel fresh grist for his mill. Nervously, impulsively, he began to expatiate on Midsummer Night, how the forest swayed and soughed, swayed and soughed, how the breaking day yonder was effecting a change in him, bringing other forces to ascendancy in his heart. Grundtvig sings: “As children of light we feel that now the night is over!” But, instead of talking too much, maybe he could show her a little trick with a straw and a twig, whereby the straw proved stronger than the twig. There was nothing he wouldn’t do for her.... “Look, let me just point to the smallest thing that makes an impression on me, that solitary juniper cluster over there. It positively bends toward us, and it looks kindly. And the spider stretches its webs from one pine to another; they look like an interesting piece of Chinese work, like suns spun from water. You’re not cold, are you? I’m convinced that we’re surrounded by ardent elfin maidens right now, laughing and dancing, but if you’re cold I’ll make a fire.... Something just occurred to me: wasn’t Karlsen found somewhere around here?”"

"Hun lo ikke lenger. Dette lot til å være mannens alvor og hun begynte å tenke over det. Ville han oppnå noe hos henne, det gale menneske? Han hadde øyne til noe av hvert. Gud vet om han ikke pønset på noe, om han ikke la en snare. Hvorfor kom han nettopp til henne med sine penger? Endelig syntes hun å ha tatt en beslutning og hun sa:","She no longer laughed. This seemed to be the man's seriousness and she began to think about it. Would he achieve anything with her, the wrong man? He had eyes for each of them. God knows if he did not invent something, if he did not lay a snare. Why did he just come to her with his money? Finally she seemed to have made a decision and she said:","She was no longer smiling. He seemed to be serious and she was turning it over in her mind. Was this eccentric man trying to get something out of her? He had shifty eyes—he might be capable of anything. He seemed to have an ulterior motive; it was almost as if he were setting a trap for her. Why should he come to her, of all people, offering money? She apparently came to a decision and said: “If you insist on giving me a crown or two for the chair, I’ll appreciate it.","She was no longer laughing. The man appeared to be in earnest, and she began to think it over. Did that lunatic wish to curry favor with her? Judging by his eyes, he was capable of anything. God knows if he wasn’t dreaming up something, if he wasn’t setting a trap. Why did he come to her, of all people, with his money? Finally she seemed to have arrived at a decision, and she said, “If you insist on giving me something for the chair, let me have a krone or two"

Jeg skal si Dem, jeg har tenkt å bo her en tid, virkelig slå meg til her for noen måneder i sommer, hva mener De om det? Er De herfra?","Yes it's good. A man with your name and formation should not make such tricks. I came to think of…. yes, of course you know all the conditions of the city, right? I'll tell you, I'm going to live here for a while, really settle down here for a few months this summer, what do you think about that? Are you from here?","“That’s all right. A man with your name and breeding shouldn’t let himself be talked into doing a foolish thing like that. Incidentally, you know this town well, don’t you? I’ve been thinking of settling down here for a while during the summer. What do you think about that? You’re from here, aren’t you?”","“Very good. A man with your name and breeding can’t allow himself to play such foolish pranks, of course. I was just thinking —well, you obviously know this town inside out, do you not?

"De er et usselt menneske, å gud hvor De er ussel! Men det synes De kanskje ikke selv. Nei hvor kunne De, hvor kunne De gjøre det!","You are a wretched man, oh god how wretched you are!

Jeg kan dessuten fra mine vinduer se hele torvet og det er jo morsomt.","No thanks, it's not needed, the room is excellent, I'm happy with that. I can also see the whole square from my windows and it's fun.","“Thank you, but there’s no need for that. My room is quite satisfactory.

"Hvem er det som er sur? Er det meg? Hvor inderlig bunnforandret du dog er blitt på noen få måneder! Jeg kommer hit ens ærend for å ….

Ja det var min skyld, jeg skrek fordi jeg trodde den ville bite; nu, det ville den ikke, den ville bare leke, og da du hadde slått den krøp den på buken for oss og la seg ned istedetfor å løpe. Dengang gråt du over hunden og klappet den, du gråt i smug, jeg så det godt; men nu gråter du ikke, skjønt …. Men dette skal ikke være noen sammenligning; du innbiller deg vel ikke at jeg sammenligner meg med en hund? Gud Fader vet hva du finner på i ditt overmot. Når du har det ansikt så kjenner jeg deg.

Det var dog bare en liten forseelse av meg, når du bare tenker deg om. Det var dårlig gjort av meg at jeg ikke gikk ned til deg den kveld; du gav meg signal på signal og jeg gikk ikke ned; jeg angrer det ved Gud så dypt! Men han var ikke hos meg da, som du trodde, han hadde vært der, men han var der ikke da, han var gått. Jeg tilstår det jo og ber om nåde.

En times tid senere – klokken var ti – tente Nagel en cigar og gikk ut. Byen var ennu ikke gått til hvile; på veien bortimot prestegården sås en mengde spaserende som beveget seg frem og tilbake i sakte gang og rundt omkring i gatene gjenlydde ennu latter og rop fra lekende småbarn.

"En skjelvende glede gjennomfór ham, han glemte seg vekk, følte seg henført og forstakk seg inn i det rasende solskinn. Stillheten gjorde ham aldeles besatt av tilfredshet, intet forstyrret ham, bare oppe i luften suset den bløte lyd, lyden av det uhyre stampeverk, Gud som trådte sitt hjul. Skogen omkring rørte ikke et blad og ikke en nål. Nagel krøp sammen av behag, trakk knærne opp under seg og hutret fordi altsammen var så godt. Det kalte på ham og han svarte ja; han reiste seg opp på albuen og så seg om. Ingen var tilstede. Han sa ja ennu en gang og lyttet; men ingen viste seg. Dette var dog besynderlig, han hadde så tydelig hørt noen kalle på seg; men han tenkte ikke mere over det, det var kanskje bare en innbilning, i ethvert fall ville han ikke la seg forstyrre. Han var i en gåtefull tilstand, fylt av psykisk behag; hver nerve i ham var våken, han fornam musikk i sitt blod, følte seg beslektet med hele naturen, med solen og fjellene og alt annet, kjente seg omsuset av sin egen jegfølelse fra trær og tuer og strå. Hans sjel ble stor og fulltonende som et orgel inne i ham og aldri glemte han hvorledes den milde musikk likefrem gled opp og ned i hans blod.","A trembling joy pervaded him, he forgot himself, felt enchanted and hid in the raging sunshine. The silence made him utterly obsessed with contentment, nothing disturbed him, only up in the air whispered the soft sound, the sound of the immense pounding, God stepping on his wheel. The forest around did not touch a leaf and not a needle. Nagel crouched with pleasure, pulled his knees up under him and shivered because everything was so good. It called to him and he answered yes; he got up on his elbow and looked around. No one was present. He said yes once more and listened; but no one showed up. This, however, was strange, he had so clearly heard someone calling to him; but he did not think about it any more, it was perhaps just an imagination, at least he would not be disturbed. He was in an enigmatic state, filled with mental pleasure; every nerve in him was awake, he sensed music in his blood, felt related to all nature, to the sun and the mountains and everything else, felt overwhelmed by his own self-esteem from trees and tufts and straw. His soul grew large and full-toned like an organ inside him and he never forgot how the gentle music even slid up and down in his blood.","A tremor of ecstasy ran through him. He felt himself carried away and engulfed by the magic rays of the sun. The stillness filled him with an intoxicating sense of well-being; he was free from worry; the only sound was a soft murmur from above, the hum of the universal machinery—God turning his treadmill. Not a leaf stirred in the trees—not a pine needle dropped. Nagel hugged his knees in sheer delight; he felt exhilarated because life was good. It beckoned to him and he responded. He raised himself on his elbow and looked around him. There wasn’t a soul in sight. He said yes to life once more and listened, but no one came. Again he said yes, but there was no answer. Strange; he had distinctly heard someone calling him. But he dismissed the thought; perhaps he had imagined the whole thing. But nothing was going to shatter his joyful mood. He was in a strange, euphoric state of mind; his every nerve vibrated; music surged through his blood; he was part of nature, of the sun, the mountains; he was omniscient; the trees, the earth, the moss, spoke to him alone. His soul went into a crescendo, like an organ with all the stops pulled out. Never would he forget how this heavenly music seemed to pulsate through his blood.","A quivering joy shot through him; forgetting himself, he felt transported, hidden inside the fierce sunshine. The silence filled him with a perfect contentment, nothing disturbed him; only, up aloft a soft, soughing sound could be heard, the sound of the vast stamping mill, God treading his wheel. Not a leaf, not a needle stirred in the woods round about. Nagel curled up with pleasure, hugging his knees and shivering with well-being. Someone called him, and he answered yes; he raised himself on his elbow and looked about him. Not a soul to be seen. He said yes once more and listened, but no one appeared. How strange; he had definitely heard someone calling him. But he didn’t give it further thought, perhaps it was just a fantasy; in any case, he wasn’t going to be disturbed. He was in an enigmatic state, brimming with inward pleasure; every nerve in his body was awake, he perceived music in his blood, sensed a kinship with all of nature, with the sun and the mountains and all the rest, felt enveloped by his own sense of self as it came back to him from trees and tussocks and blades of grass. His soul grew big and rich, like the sound of an organ inside him, and he would never forget how this soft music positively glided up and down in his blood."

We walk again through a long corridor, there are numbered rooms on both sides, and in one of these rooms the woman slips in and slams the door in.

The woman slipped into one of them and shut the door. I waited for a while, but she didn’t reappear. I even tried the door, but it was locked.","“She goes off and I follow her.

"Han ble stadig verre og Sara satt som på nåler. Hun ville helst løpe sin vei, men han merket straks når hun reiste seg og spurte da om hun ville forlate ham. Hun ventet på at han skulle falle i fast søvn når han hadde sludret seg trett. Ja hvor han sludret, med stadig lukkede øyne og ansiktet rødt av hete og feber. Han hadde utspekulert en ny måte å renske fru Stenersens rips for lus. Den bestod i at han en vakker dag gikk inn i en butikk og kjøpte et blikkspann med parafin, derpå begav han seg ut på torvet, tok sine sko av og helte dem fulle av parafin. Så tente han ild på dem begge, på den ene sko efter den andre, og endelig danset han rundt dem i bare strømpene og sang til. Dette måtte skje en formiddag når han ble frisk igjen. Han skulle lage et formelig cirkus av det, en hel hesteopera, og han ville smelle med en svøpe.","He got worse and worse and Sara sat like on needles. She would rather run her way, but he immediately noticed when she got up and then asked if she would leave him. She was waiting for him to fall asleep when he had chatted tiredly. Yes, where he chatted, with ever-closed eyes and his face red with heat and fever. He had devised a new way of cleaning Mrs. Stenersen's currants of lice. It consisted of one day he went into a shop and bought a tin can of kerosene, then he went out into the square, took off his shoes and poured them full of kerosene. Then he lit a fire on both of them, on one shoe after another, and finally he danced around them in his bare stockings and sang along. This had to happen one morning when he recovered. He was going to make a formal circus out of it, a whole horse opera, and he wanted to slam a whip.","He was getting worse and Sara became alarmed. She would have liked nothing better than to get away, but the minute she tried to get up he asked if she was leaving him. She was waiting for him to talk himself into exhaustion and fall asleep. But he kept rambling on, his eyes shut and his face flushed with fever. He had thought of a new way of ridding Mrs. Stenersen’s currant bushes of lice. This was the idea: one day he’d go into a shop on the square and buy a can of kerosene, and then he’d go out on the square, fill his shoes with it, and set fire to both of them, one after the other. Then he would sing and dance around them in his socks. He was planning to do this one morning when he was well again. He would make a real circus of it, a real horse opera, and he would walk around cracking a whip.","He was constantly getting worse, and Sara was on tenterhooks. She would have liked to cut and run, but whenever she got up he noticed right away and asked if she was abandoning him. She waited for him to fall fast asleep, after he had tired himself out by his jabbering. Oh, what nonsense he talked, always with his eyes closed and his face red-hot with fever. He had contrived a new method of delousing Mrs. Stenersen’s red currant bushes. It consisted of his going into a store one fine day and buying a can of kerosene, after which he would go to Market Square, take off his shoes and fill them with kerosene. Then he would set fire to both shoes, one after the other, and conclude by dancing around them in his stocking feet and singing a song. This must be done some morning when he was well again. He would crack his whip and make a regular circus of it, a real horse opera."

"Hysj! En …. to …. tre; hvor den slår langsomt! Fire …. fem …. seks …. syv …. åtte; er den allerede åtte? Ni …. ti. Klokken er allerede ti! Ja så må jeg opp. Hvor slo den klokke henne? I kafeen kunne det vel ikke være? Nå det er likegyldig, likegyldig, likegyldig. Men var det ikke et ganske pussig opptrinn i kafeen igåraftes? Minutten skalv, jeg kom i grevens tid. Det hadde ganske bestemt endt med at han hadde drukket sitt øl med cigarasken og fyrstikkene i. Hva så? Tør man spørre ditt nesevise råskinn: hva så? Hvorfor blander jeg meg i andres affærer? Hvorfor er jeg overhodet kommet hit til byen? Skjedde det på grunn av en eller annen katastrofe i universet, for eksempel på grunn av Gladstones forkjølelse? Hehehe, Gud hjelpe deg, barn, hvis du sier som sant er: at du egentlig var på veien hjem, men at du med ett ble så levende beveget ved synet av denne by – så liten og elendig som den er – at du var nær ved å gråte av en hemmelighetsfull og fremmed glede da du så alle flaggene. Apropos: det var den 12te juni, det var frøken Kiellands forlovelse man flagget for. Og to dager senere traff jeg henne selv.","Hush! And…. to…. three; where it strikes slowly! Fire…. fem…. sex…. seven…. eight; is it already eight? Ni…. ten. It is already ten o'clock! Yes, I have to get up. Where did that bell strike her? In the cafe it could not be? Now it's indifferent, indifferent, indifferent. But wasn't it a pretty funny incident in the cafe last night? The minute shook, I came in the count's time. It had definitely ended up that he had drunk his beer with the cigarette and the matches in it. So what? Dare one ask your nasal rawhide: so what? Why do I get involved in other people's affairs? Why did I even come here to town? Did it happen because of some catastrophe in the universe, for example because of Gladstone's cold? Hehehe, God help you, children, if you say the truth is: that you were actually on the way home, but that you were suddenly so vividly moved at the sight of this city - as small and miserable as it is - that you were close by crying with a secret and strange joy when you saw all the flags. Speaking of which: it was June 12th, it was Miss Kielland's engagement that was flagged for. And two days later I met her myself.","Quiet! One … two … three; how slowly it strikes! Four … five … six … seven … eight … is it already eight o’clock? Nine … ten. Ten o’clock? I must get up. Where was that clock? Could it have been the one in the café? Well, it makes no difference, no difference at all. But that was really an amusing scene in the café last night, wasn’t it? The Midget was shaking all over and I came at precisely the right moment. He would have ended up drinking that beer—cigar ashes, matches, and all. Well, so what? What right do you have to meddle in other people’s business? Why did you come here in the first place? Was it because of some universal catastrophe—Gladstone’s cold, for instance? God help you if you told it the way it really was; that you were really on your way home but were intrigued by this town despite the fact that it looked so small and insignificant—that you almost wept with an inexplicable joy when you saw the flags flying. By the way, it was June 12 and it was in honor of Miss Kielland’s engagement that the flags were hoisted. Two days later I met her.","Sh-sh! One-two-three; how slowly it strikes! Four—five—six—seven—eight; is it eight already? Nine—ten. It’s already ten o’clock! Then I must get up.3 Where did that clock strike? It couldn’t be in the café, could it? Well, it doesn’t matter, not at all, not at all. That scene in the café last night was quite amusing, wasn’t it? Miniman was trembling, I came in the nick of time. He would definitely have ended up drinking that beer with the cigar ash and matches in it. Well, so what? May I ask you, brazen brute that you are: so what? Why do I meddle in other people’s affairs? Why did I come to this town in the first place? Was it because of some cosmic disaster, because of Gladstone’s cold, for example? Heh-heh-heh, God help you, child, if you tell the truth: that actually you were on your way home but were suddenly so deeply moved at the sight of this town—small and miserable as it is—that you almost wept with a strange, mysterious joy when you saw all those flags. By the way, it was June 12, and the flags were flying in honor of Miss Kielland’s engagement. And two days later I met her in person."

De stanset begge opp og så på hverandre. Han knuget hendene sammen og fortsatte aldeles forpint:,They both stopped and looked at each other.

"Ja det gjorde jeg nok; det vet jeg ikke, men jeg lovet kanskje å være fornuftig. Men jeg kan så dårlig. Nå, jeg skal være fornuftig, stol på det. Men hvorledes skal jeg gjøre det, vet De det? Lær meg det. Vet De at jeg har vært like på nippet til å trenge inn i prestegården en dag, åpne dørene og gå rett inn til Dem, selv om det var flere tilstede! Men jeg har også forsøkt av all makt å stå imot, det skal De tro, ja jeg har endog baktalt Dem og forsøkt å gjøre Deres makt over meg til intet ved å nedsette Dem i andres øyne. Jeg har ikke gjort det av hevn, nei De forstår at jeg virkelig er nær ved å bukke under. Jeg har gjort det for å heve meg selv, lære meg til å bite tennene sammen for ikke å bøye formeget rygg for meg selv i min egen bevissthet. Derfor har jeg gjort det. Men jeg vet ikke riktig om det nytter meg. Jeg har også forsøkt å reise min vei, jeg har forsøkt, jeg begynte å pakke alle mine saker sammen; men jeg gjorde meg ikke helt ferdig og jeg reiste heller ikke. Hvorledes kunne jeg reise! Jeg ville i det sted heller reise efter Dem hvis De ikke var her. Og om jeg aldri fant Dem ville jeg allikevel reise efter Dem og søke idelig og håpe å finne Dem engang tilsist. Men når jeg så at det allikevel ikke nyttet meg noe så ville jeg slå av og slå av på mine håp og tilslutt ville jeg takke inderlig bare for om mulig å få se et menneske som kunne ha stått Dem nær engang, en venninne som hadde trykket Deres hånd eller fått et smil av Dem i de gode dager. Således ville jeg gjøre det. Kan jeg så reise herfra? Nu er det dessuten sommer, hele skogen her er min kirke og fuglene kjenner meg, de ser på meg hver morgning når jeg kommer, de legger hodet på skakke og ser på meg og litt efter spiller de opp. Jeg glemmer heller aldri hvorledes byen flagget for Dem den første kveld da jeg kom; det gjorde det sterkeste inntrykk på meg, jeg ble likefrem betatt av en selsom sympati; og jeg gikk halvt bedøvet omkring på skipet og så på flaggene før jeg steg iland. Ja det var den kveld! …. Men også siden har jeg mangen gang hatt det herlig; jeg går daglig på de samme veier som De og stundom kan jeg være heldig og se Deres spor på veien likesom nu idag, og da venter jeg på Dem til De kommer forbi igjen, jeg stikker meg inn i skogen og legger meg flat bak en sten og venter på Dem. Jeg har sett Dem to ganger siden jeg sist talte med Dem, og engang ventet jeg i seks timer på Dem før De kom. Jeg lå alle disse seks timer bak stenen og reiste meg ikke, bare av frykt for at De kanskje kunne komme og få øye på meg. Gud vet hvor De var henne så lenge den dag ….","Yes, I did; I do not know, but I may have promised to make sense. But I can so bad. Well, I have to be sensible, trust it. But how do I do that, you know? Teach me that. Do you know that I have been on the verge of breaking into the rectory one day, opening the doors and going straight to you, even though there were more present! But I have also tried with all my might to resist, you will believe, yes, I have even slandered you and tried to nullify your power over me by degrading you in the eyes of others. I did not do it out of revenge, no You understand that I'm really close to succumbing. I have done it to raise myself, to learn to bite my teeth together so as not to bend a shaped back for myself in my own consciousness. That's why I did it. But I do not really know if it is useful to me. I have also tried to travel my way, I have tried, I started to pack all my things together; but I did not finish completely and I did not travel either. How could I travel! I would rather go after you instead if you were not here. And if I never found you, I would still go after you and search constantly and hope to find you someday. But when I saw that it still did me no good, I would turn off and turn off my hopes and finally I would like to thank you deeply just to, if possible, see a person who could have been close to you once, a friend who had pressed Your hand or received a smile from you in the good days. Thus I would do it. Can I then leave here? Now it's also summer, the whole forest here is my church and the birds know me, they look at me every morning when I come, they tilt their heads and look at me and a little later they play. I also never forget how the city flagged for you the first night I came; it made the strongest impression on me, I was even fascinated by a strange sympathy; and I walked half anesthetized around the ship and looked at the flags before I landed. Yes it was that night! …. But also since then I have many times had a wonderful time; I walk daily on the same roads as you and sometimes I can be lucky and see your tracks on the road like now today, and then I wait for you until you come by again, I stick myself into the woods and lie flat behind a rock and waiting for you. I've seen you twice since I last spoke to you, and once I waited for you for six hours before you arrived. I lay all these six hours behind the stone and did not get up, just for fear that you might come and see me. God knows where you were for so long that day….","“Yes, I guess I did; I’m not sure what I promised, but perhaps it was to be sensible. It’s so difficult, but I’ll behave myself; I promise. But how can I? Tell me! Teach me how! Do you know that one day I almost forced my way into the parsonage! I was ready to walk right in on you even if you had had visitors. I fought against that impulse with all my might, believe me. And all the while I have been saying unkind things about you, trying to break your spell over me by maligning you. I didn’t do it out of a desire for vengeance; you must see that I’m close to breaking down. I did it to assert myself in the hope that I’d build up some self-respect and not lose face completely. That was my reason; but I’m not sure that I’ve succeeded. I’ve also tried to leave town; I started to pack but I couldn’t finish, and I didn’t leave. How could I go away! I would be more likely to pursue you if you weren’t close by. And even if I never found you, I would go on searching for you, hoping to find you at last. But when it became futile, I’d gradually lose all hope, and then I’d be enormously grateful simply to meet someone who had been near you—a woman friend with whom you had laughed, whose hand you had touched. How could I possibly leave? Besides, summer is here; the forest is my place of worship and the birds know me. They greet me every morning; they cock their heads, look at me, and start to sing. I’ll never forget the sight of the flags flying in your honor the evening I arrived. It made such a deep impression on me; I felt as if I, too, were being welcomed, and I walked around the ship in a daze, looking at the flags before I went ashore. I’ll never forget that evening! But I’ve had many happy moments here. Every day I walk along the same roads as you, and sometimes I’m lucky enough to see your footprints, as I did today. Then, as I’ve done today, I wait for your return. I hide behind a rock in the woods and wait for you. I’ve seen you twice since our last meeting, and once I had to wait six hours before you came. I lay behind the rock all that time and didn’t get up once, because I was afraid you’d come by and see me. God knows what kept you so long that day.”","“Yes, I probably did; I don’t know, but maybe I promised to be reasonable. I’m so poor at it, though. All right, I’ll be reasonable, you can trust me. But how shall I go about it, can you tell me that? Teach me how.1 You know, one day I was on the verge of forcing my way into the parsonage, opening the doors and going straight in even if there were other people present! But I’ve also done all I can to stand fast, I assure you; I’ve even slandered you, trying to destroy your power over me by discrediting you in the eyes of others. I didn’t do it out of revenge, oh no ; you see, I’m really close to going under. I did it to raise myself up, to learn to clench my teeth so as not to stoop too low in my own eyes. That’s why I did it. But I don’t quite know if it was any use.2 I also tried to leave, I really did; I began to pack my things but didn’t quite finish, nor did I leave. How could I? Instead, I would rather follow you, if you weren’t here. And even if I never found you, I would still go after you and keep searching, hoping to find you at last. And if I realized it was no use, I would lower and lower my hopes, so that in the end I would be sincerely grateful simply to have a chance to meet someone who might have been close to you at one time, a woman friend who had shaken your hand or received a smile from you in the good old days. That’s what I would do. So how could I leave? Besides, it’s summer, this whole forest is my church and the birds know me; they look at me every morning when I come, cock their heads and look at me, and the next moment they start the music. And I’ll never forget how the flags were flying all over town for you the evening I arrived; it made the most powerful impression on me. In fact, I was moved to a mysterious sympathy and, half stunned, I walked about the ship watching the flags before deciding to step ashore. Ah, some evening that was! ... But I’ve also enjoyed many a delightful moment here since; I walk the same paths as you every day, and sometimes I may be lucky enough to see your footprints on the path, as I did today, and then I wait for you until you come by again— I slip into the woods and lie down behind a rock to wait for you. I’ve seen you twice since I last talked to you, and once I waited for six hours before you came. I lay behind the rock all those six hours; I didn’t get up simply for fear you might turn up and see me. God knows where you were keeping yourself for so long that day—”"

"Dermed kom han inn igjen og satte seg på sin plass like så alvorlig som før. Han var sterkt anløpen. Da doktor Stenersen endelig kastet seg over ham for hans sosialisme kunne han slett ikke gjøre rede for seg. Jo han var en deilig sosialist! En flåer var han, en jammerlig mellommann mellom makten og vanmakten, en jurist som levet av andres krangel og som tok seg betalt for å skaffe retthaveriet rett, lovlig rett! Og slikt noe ville være sosialist!","Thus he came in again and sat down in his place as seriously as before. He was strongly tarnished. When Dr. Stenersen finally threw himself at him for his socialism, he could not explain himself at all. Yes he was a lovely socialist! He was a skinner, a pitiful middleman between power and powerlessness, a lawyer who lived off the quarrels of others and who got paid to get the court right, legal right! And such a thing would be socialist!","Then he came back and settled down in his chair, as somber as before. By this time he was really in his cups. When at last Dr. Stenersen got around to him and challenged him on his socialism, he was unable to defend his ideas. A fine socialist he was! He was a bloodsucker, a wretched middleman between power and incompetence—an attorney who makes his living from other people’s miseries and who takes their money for championing rights which were theirs to begin with! And he had the nerve to call himself a socialist!","Then he went back in and sat down in his place, as serious as ever. He was quite pickled. When Dr. Stenersen finally pitched into him for his socialism, he was totally unable to explain himself. A fine socialist he was! A leech, that’s what he was, a miserable middleman between power and impotence, a man of the law who made a living from other people’s wrangling and charged a fee so the caviler could have his rights, his legal rights!

I really ought to take it away from you, but since you don’t have the guts …”","The doctor took the vial, looked at it, shook it a few times and said, “It’s enough, more than enough.... I really ought to take this vial away from you, but since you don’t have the courage—”"
Ja nu er altså frøken Kielland forlovet. Hvorledes ser han ut hennes kjæreste?,"Yes, now Miss Kielland is engaged. What does his girlfriend look like?",A moment later Nagel said: “So Miss Kielland is engaged. What is her fiancé like?”,"A moment later Nagel said, “And now Miss Kielland is engaged. What does her fiancé look like?”"
"Jo, sa hun igjen.","Yes, she said again.","“Yes,” she said again.","“Yes,” she said again."
Naturligvis. Det er riktig fornøyelig.,Of course. It's really enjoyable.,"Everyone laughed, and Mrs. Stenersen replied: “Of course; it’s very informal.”","Everyone laughed, and Mrs. Stenersen answered, “Of course. It will be quite amusing.”"
Gjorde De virkelig? Hvorledes gikk det til?,Did you really? How did it go?,“You did? What happened?”,"“You did, indeed? How did that happen?”"
Klokken var fire.,It was four o'clock.,It was now four o’clock.,It was four o’clock.
"Og hvorfor søkte du skogen med ditt lille briljante foretagende? Kjente du skogen og hadde den mere å si for deg enn en aker, en vei eller en sjø? I skogen smågutten gikk dagen lang, la la la la. Der har vi nu for eksempel Vardalsskogene, på veien opp fra Gjøvik. Ligge der og døse og glemme seg vekk, stirre opp i været, kikke fan ivold inn i himmelen, hehe, så man nesten får rede på hvorledes det hviskes og tiskes om en selv deroppe: Han der, sier salig mamma, nei kommer han hit så går jeg min vei, sier hun og gjør det til et kabinettsspørsmål. Hehe, svarer jeg og sier: Pst, la meg ikke forstyrre, la meg bare ikke forstyrre! Og dette sier jeg så vidt høyt at jeg tiltrekker meg almindelig oppmerksomhet hos et par hunnengler, velaktet Jairi datter og Svava Bjørnson. Hehehe.","And why did you search the forest with your little brilliant enterprise? Did you know the forest and it had more to say to you than an acre, a road or a sea? In the forest the little boy went all day long, la la la la. There we now have, for example, Vardalsskogene, on the way up from Gjøvik. Lying there and dozing and forgetting away, staring up into the air, looking fan ivold into the sky, hehe, so you almost get an idea of how it is whispered and whispered about oneself up there: He there, says blessed mother, no he comes here then I go my way, she says and makes it a cabinet question. Hehe, I answer and say: Pst, do not let me disturb, just do not let me disturb! And I say this so loudly that I attract the general attention of a couple of female angels, well-respected Jairi's daughter and Svava Bjørnson. Hehehe.","And why did you go into the woods for this rendezvous with death? Were you fond of these woods, and did they mean more to you than a field, a road, or a lake? The little boy walked there the whole livelong day, la la la la. Imagine the Vardal woods on the way from Gjøvik—you lie there and leave the world behind. Look straight up into heaven and you almost hear what they’re saying about you up there. “If he comes here,” says my blessed mother, “I’ll leave,” and she really makes a big issue of it. “Ha, ha, don’t worry,” I answer, “I won’t disturb you.” And I say this so loud that I attract the attention of two female angels, the Jari girl and Svava Bjørnson.","And why did you take to the wood with your brilliant little enterprise? Did you know the wood, and did it mean more to you than a field, a road, or a lake? “The little boy walked in the wood the livelong day, la la la la.” There are the Vardal Woods, for instance, on the way up from Gjøvik. You lie there dozing, leaving the world behind; you stare at the sky, peering like hell into the heavens, heh-heh, so that you can almost hear the tittle-tattle they’re whispering about you up there: That one there, says my dear departed mother, why, if he comes here I’ll be leaving, she says, prepared to cast a vote of no confidence. I reply with a heh-heh and say, Pst, don’t let me disturb you, just don’t let me disturb you! And I say this sufficiently loud to attract a modicum of attention from a couple of she-angels, venerated Jairus’s daughter and Svava Bjørnson. Heh-heh-heh."
"De lot noen hentydninger falle om fru Stenersen som ikke hadde behøvet å være halvt så drøye for å være lave. Minutten, en stakkars krøpling, slo De Dem også til ridder på. Det var virkelig så dårlig gjort, så simpelt gjort!","They dropped some hints about Mrs. Stenersen who had not had to be half as long to be low. The minute, a poor cripple, you also knighted. It was really so badly done, so simply done!","“You made some remarks about Mrs. Stenersen which were not only in bad taste but extremely crude besides,” she said angrily. “And then you try to make yourself important at the expense of a poor cripple like The Midget. It was a mean and shabby thing to do.”","She said sharply, “You dropped some hints about Mrs. Stenersen which didn’t need to be half as crude to be base. You also scored a cheap point by ridiculing Miniman, a poor cripple. That was really mean, so vulgar!”"
Jo det forstår jeg.,"Yes, I understand that.","“Yes, I understand.”","“I do, indeed.”"
Da de var kommet omtrent midt inne i skogen var hun uforsiktig nok til å spørre:,"When they had reached about the middle of the forest, she was careless enough to ask:","When they were about half way into the woods, she cast caution aside and asked him how long he would be staying in town.","When they were about halfway into the forest, she was careless enough to ask, “How long will you be staying here?”"
"Men Minutten bar seg besynderlig ad. Han stakk med én gang av til en krok av kafeen, løp med sine små forvredne skritt til denne krok og satte seg der uten å svare. Han satt med lutende hode og skulte til alle sider idet han flere ganger trakk knærne opp under seg som i angst.","But the Minute behaved strangely. He immediately ran off to a corner of the cafe, ran with his small twisted steps to this corner and sat down there without answering. He sat with his head tilted and shrugged to all sides, pulling his knees up several times as if in anxiety.","The Midget’s reaction was odd. With his short crooked gait, he shuffled off to a corner of the café and sat down without answering. His head was bent but his eyes were darting in all directions, and several times he jerked his knees up in a gesture of terror.","But Miniman behaved very strangely. He immediately slipped away to a corner of the café, running with short, crooked steps, and sat down there without answering. His head bowed, he looked furtively in every direction, repeatedly pulling up his knees as if terrified."
Men nu syntes hun atter likesom engang tidligere å få mistanke til hans hensikt; hun så usikkert på ham og sa:,"But now, as once before, she seemed to suspect his intent; she looked uncertainly at him and said:","But, now as before, she seemed to suspect his intentions.","But now, as once before, she seemed to suspect his purpose; giving him a doubtful look, she said, “No! ..."
"De synes naturligvis at jeg er en grov banditt og tølper som kan overfalle Dem med disse beskyldninger midt opp i Deres ansikt? Det er godt, det tar jeg ikke noe hensyn til, ha bare de meninger om meg som De ønsker. I Deres sjel sitter De i dette øyeblikk og vet at jeg har tatt Dem på kornet, det er meg nok. Men hvorfor tåler De at jeg bærer meg således ad mot Dem? Hvorfor reiser De Dem ikke, spytter meg i ansiktet og går Deres vei?","Do you naturally think that I'm a gross bandit and a bully who can attack you with these accusations right in the middle of your face? That's fine, I'm not taking that into account, just have the opinions about me that you want. In your soul you are sitting in this moment and know that I have taken you to the grain, that's enough for me. But why do you tolerate me behaving in this way towards you? Why do not you get up, spit in my face and go your way?","Nagel went on: “Naturally, you think me brutal and despicable for hurling these accusations at you. But that makes no difference to me; you may think what you like. You know in your soul that I’m right , that I’ve exposed you for what you are, and that is enough as far as I’m concerned. But how can you tolerate my treating you like this? Why don’t you get up, spit in my face, and walk out?”","Nagel goes on, “You think, naturally, that I’m an uncouth bandit and boor to attack you with these accusations straight to your face. That’s all right, I can’t consider that, have whatever opinion of me you like. You know in your heart right now that I’ve hit you off, and that’s enough for me. But how can you tolerate my treating you like this? Why don’t you get up, spit in my face and go your way?”"
"Nagel drev ned til hotellet igjen; men just som han skulle gå inn gjennom døren falt det ham noe inn. Han knipset i fingrene, slo opp en liten kort latter og sa høyt: Det skulle være morsomt å se om verset står der enda! Dermed gikk han atter opp til kirkegården og stanset foran Mina Meeks gravsten. Det var ingen mennesker å se noe sted; men verset var tørket av. Hvem hadde gjort det? Det var slett ikke spor tilbake av hans bokstaver.","Nagel drove down to the hotel again; but just as he was about to enter through the door, something fell into him. He snapped his fingers, raised a small short laugh and said aloud: It would be fun to see if the verse is still there! Thus he went up to the cemetery again and stopped in front of Mina Meek's tombstone. There were no people to be seen anywhere; but the verse was wiped away. Who had done that? There were no traces left of his letters at all.","Nagel wandered off in the direction of the hotel, but just as he was about to go in, a thought flashed through his mind. He snapped his fingers, chuckled, and said out loud: “It would be amusing to see whether the lines of verse are still there!” And he turned around and went back to the cemetery. He stopped at Mina Meek’s tombstone; there was nobody around, but the lines had been rubbed out. Who had done it? Not a trace of his writing remained.","Nagel strolled back to the hotel, but just as he was about to step through the door something occurred to him. He snapped his fingers, broke into a short little laugh and said out loud, “It would be interesting to see if the verse is still there!” With that he went back to the cemetery and stopped before Mina Meek’s tombstone. No people were to be seen anywhere; but the verse had been wiped off. Who had done it? There wasn’t the least trace left of his characters."
"Godaften, frøken! Jeg er en fremmed, tilgi meg, jeg går en tur og vet ikke hvor jeg er kommet hen.","Good evening, miss! I'm a stranger, forgive me, I'm going for a walk and I do not know where I'm going.","“Good evening, miss. I’m a stranger here. Excuse me, but I’m out for a walk and I’ve lost my way.”","“Good evening, miss! Forgive me, I’m a stranger here going for a walk, and I have no idea where I’ve ended up.”"
"Han bøyet seg over henne og talte sakte. Dette varte et par minutter. Plutselig springer hun opp med knyttede hender og med ansiktet hvitt av sinne, hun presser hendene mot brystet og sier rasende:","He leaned over her and spoke slowly. This lasted a few minutes. Suddenly she jumps up with clasped hands and with her face white with anger, she presses her hands to her chest and says furiously:","He leaned over her, speaking in a low voice. After a minute or so, she leaped up, her face white with rage, and pressing her clenched fists against her breasts, she cried: “You’re rotten through and through.","He bent over her and spoke softly. This went on for a minute or two. Suddenly she jumps up , her fists clenched and her face white with rage, and, pressing her hands against her breast"
"Ja, og foruten dette alle de fremmede som strømmet til! bemerket frøken Andresen; fremmede skuespillere, sangere, musikere, kunstnere av alle slag.","Yes, and besides this all the strangers who flocked to! remarked Miss Andresen; foreign actors, singers, musicians, artists of all kinds.","Yes, and it was also the meeting place of all foreigners, Miss Andresen added—actors, singers, musicians, and all kinds of people in the world of the arts.","“Yes; and what about all those foreigners who come flocking there!” Miss Andresen remarked. “Foreign actors, singers, musicians, artists of all kinds.”"
"Men han fikk intet svar, de to fremmede så like misfornøyde ut og talte verdig om politikk seg imellom. Nagels stemning sank straks. Han tidde og forlot spisestuen i stillhet. I en butikk nede i gaten gikk han inn og forsynte seg med cigarer og tok derpå som sedvanlig avsted til skogen. Klokken var halvtolv.","But he got no answer, the two strangers looked equally dissatisfied and spoke dignifiedly about politics among themselves. Nails mood soon sank. He paused and left the dining room in silence. In a shop down the street, he went in and supplied himself with cigars and then, as usual, set off for the forest. It was half past ten.",But there was no response to his remarks. The two strangers looked as forbidding as before and continued their political discussion. Nagel’s spirits fell. He said no more and quiedy left the dining room. He went down the street to get some cigars and then as usual headed for the woods. It was then eleven-thirty.,"But he received no answer, the two strangers looked as displeased as before and went on with their dignified political discussion. Nagel’s mood plummeted. He fell silent and quietly left the dining room. After visiting a shop down the street to get some cigars, he set out for the woods as usual. It was half-past eleven."
"Han merket til sin tilfredshet at hun ble mere og mere livlig. Hun var kommet lenger frem i stuen, var blitt stående nesten ved siden av ham mens han tumlet med stolen og aldri syntes å skue seg mett på den. Han talte ustanselig, gjorde sine bemerkninger om arbeidet, ble henrykt da han på baksiden av ryggstykket oppdaget en liten innlagt skive som det atter var innlagt en ny skive i, – simpelt arbeide, smakløst barneverk som ikke engang var nøyaktig utført. Stolen var råtten og han behandlet den meget forsiktig.","He noticed to her satisfaction that she was becoming more and more lively. She had advanced further into the living room, had stood almost beside him while he tumbled with the chair and never seemed to look at himself full of it. He talked incessantly, made his remarks about the work, was delighted when he discovered on the back of the back piece a small inlaid disc in which a new disc had been inserted again, - simple work, tasteless childish work that had not even been accurately done. The chair was rotten and he treated it very carefully.","He noticed with pleasure that she was responding to him and becoming increasingly more lively. She had moved toward him and stood quite close as he continued to inspect every detail of the chair, as if he couldn’t take his eyes off it. He kept remarking on the details and the workmanship; he talked incessantly. He was delighted to discover a small disk on the back, with another one superimposed on it—a crude piece of carving, sloppily done. The chair was falling apart and he handled it with great care.","He was pleased to note that she was becoming more and more animated. She had moved to the front of the room and now stood almost right next to him, while he fussed with the chair as though he couldn’t look his fill at it. He talked on and on, remarking on the workmanship and going into raptures when he discovered, on the reverse of the back, a small inlaid disk, in which another disk had been inlaid in turn—simple work, tasteless child’s play that hadn’t even been accurately executed. The chair was rotten, and he handled it very carefully."
"Nei De må unnskylde meg, jeg spiller heller ikke imorgenaften. Det er dumt overhodet å røre ved en fiolin når man ikke kan bruke den bedre enn jeg gjør. Det er da besynderlig at ikke De hørte bedre!","No, you must excuse me, I'm not playing tomorrow either. It's stupid to touch a violin when you can not use it better than I do. It's strange that you did not hear better!","“No, please excuse me, but I won’t play tomorrow either. I feel like an idiot even touching a violin when I play as I do. I would have thought that you were more musical!”","“No, you’ll have to excuse me, I won’t play tomorrow night either. It’s simply idiotic to touch a violin when one cannot play any better than I do. How curious that you didn’t hear any better!”"
"Ja, svarte hun.","Yes, she replied.","“Yes,” she said.","“Yes,” she replied."
"Tenk deg, han er skrekkelig hjelpeløs, fortsatte hun, han duger så lite til å sette hårdt mot hårdt. Stundom slår han i bordet og vil ha meg til å dra pokker ivold, ja han skjeller meg ut, sier at jeg ødelegger ham og er mere enn grov; men straks efter er han så ulykkelig igjen og kan ikke engang beslutte seg til å la meg gå. Hva skal jeg så gjøre når jeg ser hvor svak han er? Jeg oppsetter fra dag til dag å reise min vei skjønt jeg ikke har det for godt …. Men beklag meg ikke; De kan våge å vise meg Deres uforskammede medynk! Han er iallfall bedre enn de allerfleste og har gledet meg mere enn noen annen, mere enn De. Jeg elsker ham like fullt, så meget De vet det. Jeg er ikke kommet hit for å baktale ham. Når jeg kommer hjem og treffer ham vil jeg be ham på kne om forlatelse for det jeg allerede har sagt her om ham. Ja det vil jeg!","Imagine, he is terribly helpless, she continued, he is so little able to put hard against hard. Sometimes he hits the table and wants me to go to hell, yes he scolds me, says I destroy him and is more than rude; but immediately after he is so unhappy again and can not even decide to let me go. What should I do when I see how weak he is? I plan to travel my way from day to day even though I do not feel well…. But do not apologize to me; They can dare to show me your rude pity! At least he is better than most and has pleased me more than anyone else, more than you. I love him just as much, as much as you know. I did not come here to slander him. When I come home and meet him I will ask him on his knees for forgiveness for what I have already said here about him. Yes, I will!","“He is so helpless,” she said, “and a weakling too. Now and then he bangs his fist on the table and tells me to go to hell. He screams at me, tells me that I’m destroying him and that I’m vulgar.

But don’t you dare feel sorry for me; I don’t want any of your contemptuous pity. At any rate, he’s better than most men, and has made me happier than anyone—than you even. I want you to know that I love him; I didn’t come here to complain. When I go home to him, I’ll get down on my knees and beg his forgiveness for what I’ve just said about him— so help me, I will!”","“He’s so terribly helpless, you see,” she went on, “he doesn’t know how to give as good as he gets. Sometimes he bangs the table and tells me to go to blazes; yes, he rails at me, says I’m ruining him, and behaves worse than a boor. But the next moment he’s again brokenhearted and can’t brace himself to let me go. What shall I do, seeing what a weakling he is? I put off leaving him from day to day, though I’m anything but happy.... But don’t be sorry for me; just you dare show me your insolent pity! At any rate, he’s better than most and has given me more happiness than anyone else, more than you. And I love him all the same, I want you to know. I didn’t come here to slander him. When I see him again after getting home, I’ll go down on my knees and ask his forgiveness for what I just said about him. I certainly will!” “Dear Kamma, be a little reasonable!”"

"Nei det hadde hun også rett i; men det ble hennes sak; hun skulle bare motta den, gjøre ham den glede å motta den …. Og hennes friske latter fikk ham derpå til å le med; han begynte å spøke med henne: Gud, for noen skjønne aksler hun hadde! Men ville hun tro det, han hadde engang sett litt mere av henne enn hun selv visste om. Jo det var i spisestuen, hun stod på et bord og vasket taket over seg, han så henne gjennom dørsprekken; hennes kjole var høyt oppheftet, han så en fot, et stykke legg, jo han hadde virkelig sett en halv alen deilig legg. Hehehe. Men hvorom allting var så ville han forære henne et armbånd innen aften, innen et par timer; hun kunne tro ham. Og dessuten måtte hun huske at pelsen var hennes ….","No, she was right about that too; but that became her business; she should just receive it, make him the joy of receiving it…. And her fresh laughter then made him laugh; he began to joke with her: God, for some beautiful shoulders she had! But if she wanted to believe it, he had once seen a little more of her than she knew. Yes, it was in the dining room, she was standing at a table washing the ceiling over him, he saw her through the crack in the door; her dress was high up, he saw a foot, a piece of leg, for he had really seen a half-acre lovely leg. Hehehe. But if anything, he would give her a bracelet by evening, within a couple of hours; she could believe him. And besides, she had to remember that the fur was hers….","That was up to her, of course, if she would only do him the favor of accepting it—it would give him such pleasure. Her gay laughter was infectious; he found himself joining in. He even began teasing her. What lovely shoulders she had! But he had seen even more of her than she realized! It was in the dining room: she was standing on a table washing the ceiling when he caught a glimpse of her through the door. Her skirt was tucked up and he spotted a foot, part of a leg—as a matter of fact, he had seen quite a bit of lovely leg! That evening, in an hour or so, he would like to present her with a bracelet. That was a promise, but she mustn’t forget that the fur coat was hers too.","Well, he saw her point, but that was her business; all she had to do was to accept it, give him the pleasure of accepting it....

Well, it happened in the dining room, she was standing on a table washing the ceiling when he saw her through the crack in the door; her skirt was tucked up, he saw a foot, part of a leg—in fact, he had seen a good dozen inches of lovely leg. Heh-heh-heh. But however that might be, before nightfall, in a few hours, he would present her with a bracelet; she could take his word for it.

"Hansen var for sin part sosialist, om han så måtte si: litt videregående. Han var ikke meget tilfreds med valgene; hva slags frigjørelse røbet de i grunnen, kunne noen si ham det? Gå til helvede!

"Nagel forsvarte seg. Jo det ene var nesten like så godt som det andre. Det var viljen, det var troen og disposisjonen det kom an på hos pasienten. Men doktorene måtte ikke pakke sammen de heller, de hadde sin menighet, sine troende de også, de hadde de dannede mennesker, og de dannede mennesker helbrededes ved mikstur, mens kjetterne, menigmenn, helbrededes ved jernringer, brente mannben og kirkegårdsmuld. Så man ikke eksempler på at pasienter kom seg av det klare vann når man bare innbilte dem at det var et utsøkt legemiddel? Hvilke erfaringer hadde man ikke blant annet fra morfinsyke? Det var da, når man opplevet slike merkelige hendelser, at det ikke-doktrinære menneske kunne be fan gale seg og proklamere sin uavhengighet i troen på legevitenskapen. Nå, men forresten måtte man ikke få inntrykk av at han ville forstå seg på disse saker, han var ikke fagmann og hadde ikke kunnskapen. Til syvende og sist var han også i så godt humør for øyeblikket at han heller ikke ville ødelegge humøret for andre. Fruen måtte virkelig tilgi ham, allesammen måtte tilgi ham.","Nagel defended himself. Well, one was almost as good as the other. It was the will, it was the faith and disposition that depended on the patient. But the doctors were not allowed to pack them either, they had their congregation, their believers too, they had the educated people, and the educated people were healed by potion, while the heretics, ordinary people, were healed by iron rings, burnt male bones and graveyard soil. Did you not see examples of patients getting out of the clear water when you just imagined that it was a delicious medicine? What experiences did you not have, among other things, from morphine? It was then, when one experienced such strange events, that the non-doctrinaire man could ask the fan to go mad and proclaim his independence in the belief in medical science. Now, but by the way, one must not get the impression that he would understand these matters, he was not a professional and did not have the knowledge. In the end, he was also in such a good mood at the moment that he did not want to ruin the mood of others either. The wife really had to forgive him, everyone had to forgive him.","Nagel came to his own defense. One cure was as good as another. The important thing was the will, the faith, the character of the patient. But there was certainly no reason for doctors to close up shop. They had a faithful following. Their patients were educated people and they were cured by drugs, while heretics and peasants were cured by iron rings, charred human bones and mold from graveyards. Weren’t there instances of patients being healed by ordinary water because they were persuaded that water was an especially effective remedy? Weren’t there many such cases among morphine addicts, for example? On the strength of these remarkable cures, people who believed in non-scientific healing could tell medical science to go to the devil, and ignore its teachings. He hoped he wasn’t giving the impression that he thought he was an expert on these matters. He was not a professional and didn’t have the facts to back up his ideas. Besides, he was in a very good mood and didn’t want to depress anyone else by talking about unpleasant things. Mrs. Stenersen, and everyone, must forgive him.","Nagel defended himself. Sure, one thing was just about as good as any other. It was the patient’s will, his faith and disposition, everything depended on. Still, doctors didn’t have to shut up shop, they had their congregation after all, their faithful; they had the educated people, and the educated people were cured with medicines, while the heretics, the ordinary joes, were cured with iron rings, burned human bones and graveyard dirt. Weren’t there instances where patients got better by drinking ordinary water, as long as they were made to believe that it was a sophisticated remedy? And look at the experience gained from cases of morphine addiction! It was when he met with such strange happenings that the non-doctrinaire individual could say, “I’ll be damned!” and proclaim his independence as regards belief in medical science. However, he didn’t mean to leave the impression that he claimed to understand these matters, he was no expert and lacked the knowledge. Besides, when all was said and done, he was in such high spirits at the moment that he didn’t want to spoil anyone else’s. Mrs. Stenersen must really forgive him, they all must."
"Nagel satte seg igjen. Det begynte påny å rykke i hans aksler og flere ganger tok han seg heftig opp til hodet. Han satt meget sammensunken. Da Martha kom sprang han opp, et takknemlig blikk lyste opp i hans ansikt og han satte en stol tilrette for henne.","Nagel sat down again. His shoulders began to jerk again and several times he raised his head violently. He sat very sunken. When Martha came he sprang up, a grateful look lit up his face and he set a chair for her.","Nagel sat down again.

He was leaning over the table seemingly in a state of collapse, but when Martha came he jumped up and with a look of gratitude pulled out a chair for her.","Nagel sat down again. His shoulders started twitching anew, and he repeatedly clutched his head. He sat all hunched up. When Martha came he jumped up, a grateful look brightened his face, and he put out a chair for her."

"Nagel gav seg god tid, talte ikke med noen, mælte slett ikke et ord, men undersøkte derimot billedene på veggene i flere minutter, gikk fra vegg til vegg og så på hvert især. Endelig kom hans tur og han la seg i stolen.","Nagel gave himself plenty of time, did not talk to anyone, did not say a word at all, but instead examined the pictures on the walls for several minutes, went from wall to wall and looked at each one.

I can not cut higher, says the Minute, I really can not, God is my witness, You must believe me, now I can no more.","“I can’t do it any louder,” said The Midget. “I really can’t, as God is my witness —it’s the truth; I can’t any more.”","“There! I can’t grind them any louder,” Miniman says, “I really can’t, as God is my witness. Believe me, I can’t anymore.”"
"Ja. Og sett med Deres øyne var det riktig gjort, men sett med mine tar det seg anderledes ut. Hvorfor gjorde De det?","Yes. And from your point of view it was done right, but from my point of view it looks different. Why did you do that?","“Yes,” said The Midget at last. “From your point of view, it was the right thing to do, but from mine it was quite wrong. Why did you do it?”","“Yes. And seen with your eyes it was the right thing to do, but seen with mine it appears quite different. Why did you do it?”"
"Hun ble aldeles forvirret av denne likefremhet, hun holdt munnen åpen og visste ikke sin arme råd.

"I det samme går den hvithårede eggekone forbi, Martha Gude, med kurven foran seg under forkleet og de sorte øyne nedslagne. Minutten hilste, Nagel hilste også og hun svarte neppe, gikk bare hurtig forbi, hastet bort til torvet hvor hun leverte sine to tre egg og gikk så igjen derfra med sine skillinger i hånden. Hun hadde en grønn, tynn kjole på. Nagel slapp ikke denne grønne kjole avsyne. Han sa:","At the same time, the white-haired egg wife passes by, Martha Gude, with the basket in front of her under her apron and her black eyes downcast.

She was carrying her basket under her apron, her black eyes downcast. The Midget greeted her, and Nagel also bowed, but she scarcely looked up at them.

Nagel, his eyes fixed on the dress, said: “So you need the coat in three weeks?","At that moment the white-haired egg-wife, Martha Gude, went by, the basket under her apron and her black eyes downcast.

She was wearing a thin green dress. Nagel didn’t take his eyes off that green dress. He said, “So you will need that coat in three weeks?"
"Er det en medalje? Men hvorledes bærer De Dem ad med den, se på båndet! Hva slags medalje er det?","Is it a medal? But how do you carry it, look at the tape! What kind of medal is that?",“Is that a medal?” she asked. “But what a way to treat it! Just look at that ribbon! What kind of a medal is it?”,"Then she said, “A medal, is it?

"Endog i siste øyeblikk bad hun påny om en kam og uttalte sin bekymring for at hennes kjole kunne være blitt krøllet. Men jeg tåler ikke at du holder så meget til oppe hos den fru Stenersen, sa hun og skapte seg. Jeg tåler det ikke, jeg blir utrøstelig. – Og hun så ennu en gang efter om hun hadde forvart sine penger riktig godt. Hvor du er søt som gav meg alle de penger! utbrøt hun. Og med en hurtig bevegelse slo hun sløret opp og kysset ham på munnen, midt på munnen. Men hun var allikevel fullt opptatt av sitt underlige ærend til Martha Gude og spurte:","Even at the last moment, she asked for a comb again and expressed her concern that her dress might have been curled. But I can not stand that you stay so much up with that Mrs. Stenersen, she said and created herself. I can not stand it, I become inconsolable. - And she looked once more to see if she had kept her money really well. How sweet you are who gave me all that money! she exclaimed. And with a quick movement she opened the veil and kissed him on the mouth, in the middle of the mouth. But she was still fully occupied with her strange errand to Martha Gude and asked:","She was self-conscious about her appearance and, before leaving, again asked him for a comb and showed concern over her wrinkled dress. “But I won’t stand for your spending so much time with that Mrs. Stenersen,” she said mischievously. “I just won’t put up with it—it would break my heart.” And she glanced quickly at the money, to make sure it was safe. “How kind of you to give me all that money!” she exclaimed. Impetuously, she threw back her veil and kissed him on the mouth. But her mind was on her mysterious errand to Martha Gude.","At the very last moment she asked him again for a comb and expressed a concern that her dress might have gotten crumpled. “I really can’t stand the idea of your going to see that Mrs. Stenersen so often,” she said, shamming.3 “I just can’t stand it, I’ll be inconsolable.” She again checked whether her money had been safely stowed away. “How sweet of you to give me all that money!” she exclaimed.

"Jeg vet en fattig kone her, hun har sett så skamfull på meg som om hun ville be om noe, men har ikke våget det enda. Jeg er aldeles besatt av hennes øyne, enda hennes hår er hvitt, jeg har fire ganger gått en omvei for å unngå å treffe henne. Hun er ikke gammel, det er ikke av alderdom hun er hvit; hennes øyenhår er forferdelig sorte enda, gruelig sorte, så øynene ligger og ulmer. Hun bærer nesten alltid en kurv foran seg under forkleet og det er vel den hun er skamfull over. Når hun er kommet forbi meg vender jeg meg om og ser at hun går ned på torvet og tar noen få egg ut av kurven og disse to tre egg selger hun så til hvemsomhelst hvorpå hun igjen går hjem med kurven på samme måte under forkleet. Hun bor i et bitte lite hus nede ved kaien; huset er på én etasje og er ikke malt. Jeg har engang sett henne gjennom vinduet, det er ingen gardiner for, bare noen hvite blomster har jeg sett der, og hun stod langt inne i stuen og stirret på meg da jeg gikk forbi. Gud vet hva det er for et menneske; men hennes hender er ganske små. En almisse kunne jeg vel gi deg, hvite pike, men jeg ville heller gi deg en hjelp.","I know a poor wife here, she has looked at me as shamefully as if she wanted to ask for something, but has not dared to do so yet.

She almost always carries a basket in front of her under her apron and that is probably the one she is ashamed of. When she has passed me, I turn around and see that she goes down to the square and takes a few eggs out of the basket and she then sells these two or three eggs to anyone, after which she goes home with the basket in the same way under the apron. She lives in a tiny little house down by the quay; the house is on one floor and is not painted. I once saw her through the window, there are no curtains, only a few white flowers I have seen there, and she was standing deep in the living room staring at me as I walked by.

"Nu er det noe man kunne gjøre, man kunne gjøre sin innflytelse gjeldende for Indremisjonen, for Japans kunst, for Hallingdalsbanen, for hvasomhelst, bare at man gjør sin innflytelse gjeldende for noe og hjelper noe på fote.

"De sier ikke et ord, De faller ikke ut av rollen. Jeg får slett ikke rugget Dem av flekken, De er en stum kraft av en ganske sjelden art; jeg beundrer Dem og interesserer meg uhyre for Dem. Husker De dengang jeg talte med Dem en hel aften og blant annet fikserte Dem og mente at De gjorde rykk på Dem? Det gjorde jeg for å prøve meg frem. Jeg har holdt øye med Dem og prøvet meg frem ad forskjellige veier, nesten alltid uten hell, det tilstår jeg, fordi De er en uangripelig mann. Men jeg har ikke et øyeblikk tvilt om at De var en stille og hellig lønnsynder av et eller annet slag. Jeg har intet bevis imot Dem, det mangler jeg dessverre, så De kan være ganske trygg, det blir altsammen mellom oss. Men kan De da forstå at jeg er så sikker i min sak når jeg ingen beviser har? Se, det fatter De ikke. Og allikevel har De en måte å dukke hodet på når vi taler om noe; De har et par øyne med det og det uttrykk, øyne som nettopp blinker når De sier de og de ord eller når vi nærmer oss de og de spørsmål; De har dessuten en stemme med den sort suselyd, å, den stemme! Men endelig påvirker De meg antipatisk med Deres person, jeg føler det i været når De nærmer Dem, min sjel begynner straks å rykke i meg av mishag. Det forstår De ikke? Ikke jeg heller; men således er det. Ved Gud, jeg føler meg enn i denne stund overbevist om at jeg er på det riktige spor; men jeg kan ikke ramme Dem fordi jeg ingen beviser har. Jeg spurte Dem sist De var heroppe hvor De holdt Dem henne den 6te juni, – vil De vite hvorfor jeg spurte Dem om det? Nu vel, den 6te juni var Karlsens dødsdag og jeg trodde like til da at De hadde myrdet Karlsen.","They do not say a word, they do not fall out of the role. I can not shake you at all from the stain, You are a dumb force of a rather rare kind; I admire you and am extremely interested in you. Do you remember the time I talked to you for a whole evening and, among other things, fixed you and thought that you were jerking? I did it to try my hand. I have kept an eye on you and tried my hand at different ways, almost always without success, I confess, because you are an unassailable man. But I do not for a moment doubt that you were a quiet and holy secret sinner of some kind. I have no evidence against you, I'm unfortunately missing that, so you can be quite safe, it's all between us. But can you then understand that I am so sure of my case when I have no evidence? See, you do not understand. And yet you have a way of popping your head when we talk about something; They have a pair of eyes with that and that expression, eyes that just blink when you say those and those words or when we approach those and those questions; They also have a voice with that black hissing sound, oh, that voice! But finally you affect me antipathetically with your person, I feel it in the air as you approach, my soul immediately begins to twitch in me out of displeasure. You do not understand that? Neither do I; but so it is. By God, I feel than at this moment convinced that I am on the right track; but I can not hit you because I have no evidence. I asked you last time you were up here where you held her on the 6th of June, - do you want to know why I asked you about it? Well, June 6th was Karlsen's day of death and I thought until then that you had murdered Karlsen.","Nothing will make you budge; your silence is a powerful weapon. I admire you; you intrigue me. Do you remember the time I talked to you for a whole evening, staring intently at you several times and then implying that you had reacted with alarm? I did that to try to get something out of you. I’ve kept my eye on you and tried all sorts of ways to get at you, but I’ve been unsuccessful, because you’re inscrutable. I’ve never doubted for a moment that in your piousness you had a secret vice of some kind. I can’t prove it; unfortunately I have no evidence whatever against you, so you don’t have to worry. It will remain our secret. I suppose you can’t understand how I can be so sure when I have no proof. No, you can’t. And yet you have a way of looking down when we talk about certain things; your eyes assume an odd expression. They flinch at certain words, certain subjects. And a strange tone comes over your voice—I can still hear it. But to come to the point: you arouse a strong feeling of antipathy in me; I feel it the moment you approach me; my very soul is repulsed by your presence. You don’t understand it? Neither do I, but that’s the way it is. I’m convinced that I’m right, but I can’t do anything about it because I don’t have any proof. The last time you were here, I asked you where you were on June 6. Would you like to know the reason I asked? That was the day Karlsen died, and up to that time I believed you had murdered him.”","When Miniman begins to shake, his eyes casting anxious and perplexed looks in every direction, Nagel continues, “You don’t say a word, you don’t give yourself away.

I’ve kept an eye on you and tried all sorts of ways, almost always without success, I admit, because you are irreproachable. But I haven’t doubted for a moment that you were a quiet, sanctimonious secret sinner of some kind. I have no evidence against you, I’m afraid that is lacking, so you can feel quite safe, it will all be between the two of us. But since I have no evidence, how can I be so confident that I’m right , can you understand that? No, that you cannot grasp. And yet you have a way of ducking your head when we talk about certain things; you show a pair of eyes with this or that expression, eyes that blink at the very moment you utter such and such words or when we approach such and such questions. Besides, you have a voice with a sort of whistling sound, oh, what a voice! Ultimately, your person affects me with repugnance; I feel it in the air when you approach, my soul immediately winces with aversion. You can’t understand that, can you? Nor can I, but that’s the way it is. Even at this moment I feel convinced that I am on the right track, God knows I do, but I cannot catch you for lack of evidence. The last time you were here I asked you where you were on June 6—would you like to know why I asked you about that? All right, June 6 was the day Karlsen died, and until then I believed that you had murdered Karlsen.”"
"Fra hus til hus gjenlydde allerede pianoene; gjennom de åpne vinduer hørtes ulike melodier fra kvartal til kvartal og en nervøs hund svarte høyt opp i gaten med lange hyl.

The woman was walking in front of me and I had no doubt who she was; she was still wearing the cross. I had recognized her from the beginning, though I pretended not to. Now I wanted to overtake her and I walked as fast as I could, but I couldn’t reach her. She didn’t touch the ground but seemed to glide along without moving her feet. She went around a corner and disappeared.","“I look around me, and sure enough, a small rain begins to fall. The woman is walking away, I can see her in front of me; I knew her very well, she was still wearing the crucifix. I had recognized her from the beginning, but pretended I didn’t know her. Wanting to catch up with her, I walked for all I was worth; but I didn’t catch up with her. She didn’t use her feet, she glided along without stirring, turned a corner and disappeared."
Nei! svarer Minutten. Og han åpner døren.,No! answers the Minute. And he opens the door.,"“No,” said The Midget, opening the door.",“No!” Miniman replies. And he opens the door.
"Men ennu har jeg ikke hørt Dem anerkjenne noen ting eller noen mann, sa doktoren. Det skulle være morsomt å vite om det dog ikke finnes noen som også De kan med.","""But I have not yet heard you acknowledge anything or any man,"" said the doctor. It should be fun to know if there is no one you can join.","“But I’ve never yet heard you say anything constructive about any person or thing,” said the doctor. “It would be interesting to know if there is anybody who meets with your approval.”","“But so far I haven’t heard you express approval of anything or anybody,” the doctor said. “It would be interesting to know if there is someone with whom you, too, can hit it off.”"
"Jeg gråter slett ikke, svarte hun; det kunne ikke falle meg inn. Men jeg vil gjerne tilstå at denne drøm gjorde inntrykk på meg. Og det tror jeg nu forresten den gjorde på Dem også.","I'm not crying at all, she replied; it could not occur to me. But I would like to admit that this dream made an impression on me. And by the way, I think it did that to you too.",“Why should I? But I do admit that this dream made an impression on me—and I think you were moved by it too.”,"“I’m not crying at all,” she retorted, “it wouldn’t occur to me. But I do admit that this dream made an impression on me. And I dare say it made an impression on you, too.”"
"Akkurat hva jeg ventet! Jeg visste at De ville svare så, derfor spurte jeg. De er den mest gjennomførte renhet i to sko, den uangripeligste sjel i byen. Altsammen er godt og uegennyttig hos Dem, De er uten plett og rynke. Jeg ville engang sette Dem på prøve og leie Dem for betaling til å overta farskapet for et fremmed barn. Skjønt De var fattig og såre vel kunne trenge disse penger avslo De dog straks tilbudet. Deres sjel kom i opprør bare ved den blotte tanke på en slik uren handel og jeg kom ingen vei med Dem uaktet jeg endog bydde Dem to hundre kroner. Hadde jeg visst hva jeg nu vet ville jeg ikke ha fornærmet Dem så grovt. Jeg hadde ikke noe klart inntrykk av Dem enda, nu derimot vet jeg at overfor Dem skal man på én gang spore og holde an sin ganger. Nå, det er godt! Men la oss bli ved med det vi talte om …. Dette at De tar skoene av og danser barbent, uten å gjøre folk oppmerksom på det, uten å ense smertene ved det og uten å klage, det er nettopp et karaktertrekk hos Dem. De klynker ikke, De sier ikke som så: se jeg tar skoene av for ikke å slite dem, det er jeg nødt til, jeg er så fattig! Nei De virker, om jeg så må si, i stumhet. Det er et gjennomført prinsipp hos Dem at De aldri påkaller noe hos noen, De oppnår allikevel alt hva De vil oppnå, men De har ikke selv åpnet munnen. De er absolutt uangripelig, både overfor andre folk og hos Dem selv, i Deres egen bevissthet. Jeg slår fast dette karaktertrekk hos Dem og går videre; De skal ikke bli utålmodig, jeg kommer til forklaringen tilslutt …. De sa engang noe om frøken Gude som jeg ofte har tenkt over, De sa at hun kanskje ikke var så aldeles utilgjengelig enda, når man bar seg litt fint ad, i det minste hadde De oppnådd adskillig hos henne ….","Exactly what I was expecting! I knew you would answer so, so I asked. They are the most accomplished purity in two shoes, the most unassailable soul in the city. Everything is good and selfless with you, You are without spot and wrinkle. I would once put you to the test and hire you for payment to take over the paternity of a foreign child. Although you were poor and could very well need this money, you immediately turned down the offer. Your soul rebelled only at the mere thought of such an unclean trade and I came no way with you notwithstanding I even offered you two hundred kroner. Had I known what I know now, I would not have offended you so badly. I did not have a clear impression of you yet, but now I know that in front of you you have to track and hold your times at once. Well, that's good! But let's continue with what we talked about…. The fact that you take off your shoes and dance barefoot, without making people aware of it, without realizing the pain of it and without complaining, is just a characteristic of you. They do not whine, They do not say like that: look I take my shoes off so as not to wear them, I have to, I am so poor! No, they seem, I must say, in silence. It is an established principle with you that you never call on anyone, you still achieve everything you want to achieve, but you have not opened your mouth yourself. You are absolutely invulnerable, both to other people and to yourself, in your own consciousness. I establish this trait in you and move on; They should not be impatient, I will come to the explanation at the end…. You once said something about Miss God that I have often thought about, You said that she might not be so completely inaccessible yet, when you behaved a little nicely, at least you had achieved a lot with her….","“That’s what I thought your answer would be, and that’s why I asked you. You’re purity personified and the most irreproachable soul in town. Everything about you is noble and unselfish; you’re without stain or blame. Once I wanted to test you and offered to pay you to assume the paternity of a child that wasn’t yours. Although you’re poor and could have used the money, you rejected the offer without a moment’s hesitation. Your very soul revolted at the idea of such an infamous transaction, and I was unable to persuade you, though I offered you as much as two hundred crowns. Had I known you better, I wouldn’t have offended you so crudely. Now I know that in dealing with you one has to spur one ’s horse on, yet hold the reins tight at the same time. Well, let’s go back to what we were talking about. It is quite like you to take your shoes off and dance barefoot, displaying your disregard for pain. You don’t complain; you don’t say: ‘I’m taking my shoes off so as not to wear diem out. I have to, because I’m so poor!’ No, you seek to impress by your silence, if you’ll permit me to say so. It’s against your principles to ask a favor of anyone. But you manage to get what you want without opening your mouth. You are above reproach in your dealings with other people as well as in your personal ethics. I’m making a point of this character trait of yours, but to go on—don’t be impatient —I’m about to explain. You once said something about Miss Gude which has stuck in my mind.","“Just what I expected! I knew that would be your answer, that’s why I asked you. You are a walking image of immaculate purity, the most irreproachable soul in town. Everything about you is kind and unselfish, you’re without blemish or flaws. I tried to test you once, offering to pay you to assume the paternity of a strange child. Although you were poor and might need the money very badly, you promptly turned down the offer. Your soul revolted at the mere thought of such a shady deal, and I could get nowhere with you, though I offered you two hundred kroner. Had I known what I know now , I wouldn’t have insulted you so grossly. I didn’t yet have a clear impression of you, whereas now I know that vis-à-vis you one must at once spur one’s steed and rein him in. Well, that’s all right! But let’s go on with what we were talking about.... The fact that you take your shoes off and dance barefoot, without calling attention to yourself, without heeding the pain or complaining, just shows one of your character traits. You don’t whine, you don’t say, for instance: Look, I’m taking my shoes off so I won’t wear them out , I just have to, I’m so poor! No, you work, if I may say so, in silence. It’s a consistent principle of yours never to beg anything from anybody; you get all you want anyway, without opening your mouth. You are absolutely irreproachable, vis-à-vis other people as well as yourself, in your own consciousness. I place on record this character trait of yours and move on; you mustn’t be impatient , I’ll get to the explanation eventually.... You once said something about Miss Gude which I’ve often pondered; you said that she might not be quite so unapproachable at that, if one went about it in a nice way; at any rate, you had gotten quite far with her—”"
"Jaså, De takker meg ikke nu? Når takker De meg da? Hahaha, er De sønn av en prest! Men legg da merke til hvorledes De uttrykker Dem.","So, you do not thank me now? When will you thank me then? Hahaha, you are the son of a priest! But then notice how you express yourself.","“So you thank me, but not now? When will you thank me then? And you the son of a parson! You ought to be more careful how you express yourself.”","“So, you thank me, but not now? When will you thank me then? Ha-ha-ha, a fine parson’s son you are! Just look at the way you express yourself.”"
Hvis De vil ta Deres glass og slå det i hodet på den hvalp der så gir jeg Dem kontant en tikrone og redder Dem fra alle mulige følger. Han pekte rett på fullmektigens ansikt og gjentok: Jeg mener den hvalp der.,"If you want to take your glass and hit it on the head of the puppy there, I will give you a tikron in cash and save you from all possible consequences. He pointed directly at the proxy's face and repeated: I mean the puppy there.","He stopped in front of The Midget, put his hand on his shoulder, and said in a loud, distinct voice: “If you’ll pick up your glass and fling it at that bastard over there, I’ll give you ten crowns and offer you my protection besides. I mean that one,” he said, pointing straight at the deputy’s face.","Stopping beside Miniman, he puts his hand on his shoulder and says in a loud, clear voice, “If you pick up your glass and throw it in the face of that cub over there, I’ll give you ten kroner in cash and save you from all possible consequences.” He pointed straight at the deputy’s face and repeated: “ I mean that cub there.”"
Det synes De ikke å mene?,You do not seem to mean that?,“You don’t sound as though you mean that.”,“You don’t seem to mean that.”
"Jo så så jeg henne igjen idag. Det er derfor jeg nu og da har en følelse av angst. Jeg stod i vinduet på mitt værelse og så ut på gaten, så kom hun rett imot meg, tversover torvet, likesom fra bryggene og sjøen, stanset utenfor mine vinduer og så opp. Jeg var ikke sikker på om det var meg hun så på og jeg gikk over i et annet vindu; men da dreiet hun øynene efter og så på meg også der. Så hilste jeg ned til henne; men da hun så det vendte hun seg raskt om og svevet tilbake over torvet til bryggene igjen. Hvalpen Jakobsen reiste hårene og sprang ellevill ut av hotellet og gjødde. Dette gjorde litt inntrykk på meg. Jeg hadde nesten glemt henne i denne lange tid, og så kommer hun igjen idag. Kanskje ville hun advare meg for noe.","Yes, I saw her again today. That's why I have a feeling of anxiety every now and then. I stood in the window of my room and looked out on the street, then she came straight towards me, across the square, as if from the piers and the sea, stopped outside my windows and looked up. I was not sure if it was me she was looking at and I went over to another window; but then she turned her eyes and looked at me there too. Then I greeted her down; but when she saw it she turned quickly and hovered back over the square to the piers again. The puppy Jakobsen raised his hair and ran wildly out of the hotel and fertilized. This made a little impression on me. I had almost forgotten her for this long time, and then she's coming back today. Maybe she wanted to warn me of something.","“Yes, I saw her again today. That’s why I can’t seem to shake this uneasiness. I was standing at the window of my room looking out, and there she was, heading straight toward me across the square, as if she were coming from the harbor and the sea. She stopped beneath my windows and looked up. I wasn’t sure that she was looking at me, so I moved to the other window, but her eyes followed me. Then I bowed to her, whereupon she quickly turned and floated back across the square in the direction of the docks. The puppy Jacobsen bristled and darted out of the hotel, barking furiously. This struck me as rather odd. I had almost forgotten her after all this time, but here she was again. Perhaps she wanted to warn me about something.”","“Oh yes, I saw her again today. That’s why I have a feeling of dread off and on. I was standing by the window of my room looking out, and there she was, coming straight toward me across the square, as though from the docks and the sea; she stopped beneath my windows and looked up. I wasn’t quite sure it was me she was looking at, so I moved over to the other window ; but she turned her eyes and looked at me there, too. I waved a greeting to her, but on seeing that she quickly turned and floated back across the square to the docks again. Jakobsen, the puppy, raised her hackles and streaked out of the hotel, barking furiously. That somehow got to me. I had almost forgotten her after all that time, and here she turns up again. Maybe she wanted to warn me about something.”"
"Og efterhvert som han gikk videre ble han også mildere stemt ved denne varme, strålende morgen og den uavlatelige fuglesang i luften. En kjerre kom kjørende imot ham, kjøregutten hilser og Nagel hilser; en hund som følger med logrer for ham og ser ham opp i ansiktet …. Men hvorfor hadde det ikke lyktes for ham å dø ærlig og redelig inatt? Han sørget over det ennu; han hadde lagt seg til hvile full av behag over å være kommet til enden, en mild glede hadde gjennomtrengt ham, like til han lukket øynene og begynte å sove. Nu var Dagny stått opp, kanskje var hun allerede gått ut, og han hadde ikke kunnet glede henne på noen slags måte. Hvor han følte seg forsmedelig bedratt! Minutten hadde føyet en ny godhet til de mange andre hans hjerte var fylt av, han hadde gjort ham en tjeneste, hadde frelst hans liv, – akkurat den samme tjeneste som han selv engang hadde gjort en fremmed, en ulykkelig mann, som ikke ville komme iland i Hamburg. Det var ved den leilighet han fortjente sin redningsmedalje, hehe, fortjente sin redningsmedalje! Jo man frelser mennesker, man betenker seg ikke på å gjøre gode gjerninger iblant, man går resolutt hen og frelser folk fra døden!","And as he went on, he was also more mild-tempered by this warm, glorious morning and the incessant birdsong in the air. A cart came driving towards him, the carriage boy greets and Nagel greets; a dog that follows wags him and looks him up in the face…. But why had he not succeeded in dying honestly and honestly tonight? He mourned over it yet; he had laid down to rest full of pleasure at having come to an end, a mild joy had permeated him, until he closed his eyes and began to sleep. Now Dagny had gotten up, maybe she had already gone out, and he had not been able to please her in any way. How he felt despised! The minute had added a new kindness to the many others his heart was filled with, he had done him a favor, had saved his life, - just the same service he himself had once done to a stranger, an unhappy man, who would not come iland in Hamburg. It was at that apartment that he deserved his rescue medal, hehe, deserved his rescue medal! Yes, you save people, you do not hesitate to do good deeds sometimes, you resolutely go and save people from death!","As he walked along, he calmed down; the gentle morning air and the singing of birds restored his spirit. A horse-drawn cart approached him; the driver saluted and Nagel returned the greeting. A dog in tow looked at him and wagged his tail. But why hadn’t he been allowed to die during the night, honesdy and without complications? He was still fretting and was terribly confused. He had lain down with a feeling of infinite relief that the end was near. A sense of peace had enveloped him and he had closed his eyes and fallen asleep. By this time Dagny was up—perhaps she had already gone out—and he hadn’t been able to do a single thing to make her happy! He felt empty and betrayed; everything had been taken from him! The Midget had done one more good deed, he and his heart overflowing with kindness! The Midget had saved his life—the same service he himself had once rendered a stranger who for some reason didn’t want to arrive in Hamburg! That was the time he had earned the medal, and he hadn’t really deserved it—earned it, indeed! You save people instinctively, not to do a noble deed, it’s just reflex action!","As he walked on, his mood was softened by the bright, warm morning and the unceasing birdsong in the air. A cart came driving toward him; the boy driver says hello, Nagel does likewise, and a trailing dog wags his tail and looks him straight in the eye.... But why hadn’t he managed to die last night, fairly and squarely? He still grieved over it. He had laid himself to rest feeling quite satisfied to have reached the end; he was filled with a gentle happiness until he closed his eyes and fell asleep. By this time Dagny was up, maybe she had already gone out, and he hadn’t been able to do anything nice for her. He couldn’t have felt more ignominiously taken in! Miniman had added one more kindness to the many others his heart overflowed with, he had done him a favor and saved his life—the very same favor he himself had once done a stranger, an unfortunate who didn’t want to land in Hamburg. It was on that occasion he had earned his lifesaving medal, heh-heh, earned his lifesaving medal! Oh sure, you save people, you don’t hesitate to do a good deed sometimes, you go straight ahead and save people from death!"
"Ja se, det var nu bare utflukter; han kunne jo torsdag kveld?","Yes, look, it was just excursions; he could Thursday night?","That was just an excuse; he had played on Thursday night, hadn’t he?","Why, those were nothing but excuses; he could Thursday evening, right?"
Da spurte hun smilende:,Then she asked smiling:,"Smiling, she asked: “And what is your opinion about the possibility of a lasting peace?”","Then she asked, smiling, “"
Virkelig? Men det var dog hovedstaden allikevel. Der var jo møtestedet for alt hva som fantes i landet av storheter og berømmelser og kunst og teater og alt mulig.,Really? But it was the capital anyway. It was the meeting place for everything that existed in the country of greatness and fame and art and theater and everything.,"Really? But it was the capital, after all. It was the place where the great men and the celebrities of the country gathered, and it was the center of the arts, the theater—everything.","Really? Still, it was the capital. It was, after all, the meeting place for whatever the country had to offer of great and famous people, of art and theater, and everything under the sun."
"Jeg vet ikke, svarte hun.","I do not know, she replied.","he said at last. “I don’t know,” she replied.","“I don’t know,” she replied."
Pause. Nagel drakk og fortsatte:,Break. Nagel drank and continued:,Pause. Nagel drank some more wine and went on talking: “You may ask what this story has to do with you and me and the stag party.,Pause. Nagel drank and continued.
"De svære aksler på den korte kropp rykket igjen hele tiden da han gikk bortefter veien. Han så ingen av dem han møtte, kjente intet ansikt, og han sanset seg først efter at han hadde passert hele byen og fant seg stående utenfor hotellets trapp.","The heavy axles on his short body jerked all the time as he walked down the road. He saw none of those he met, felt no face, and he sensed himself only after he had passed the whole city and found himself standing outside the hotel stairs.","The broad shoulders on his short, sturdy body were shaking as he disappeared down the road. He looked straight through the people he met, not recognizing anyone. Only after he had walked through the town and reached the hotel did he regain control of himself.","Once again, those broad shoulders on the short body kept twitching as he walked down the road. He saw none of the people he met, didn’t recognize a single face, and he came to his senses only after he had crossed the whole town and found himself at the steps of the hotel."
"Hun så på ham. Hans ansikt var fullkommen rolig, hans øyne åpne som om han aldeles ikke løy. Hun hadde fremdeles medaljen i hånden.","She looked at him. His face was perfectly calm, his eyes open as if he had not lied at all. She still had the medal in her hand.","She looked at him. His expression was unruffled, and he looked her straight in the eyes, as if he were being completely sincere. She still held the medal in her hand.","She looked at him. His face was perfectly calm, his eyes candid, as if lying never entered his head. She was holding the medal in her hand."
"Nei han ville ikke kle seg av; hva tenkte hun på? Var det kanskje ikke midt på dagen? Han hørte tydelig fuglekvitter ennu. Hun skulle heller ikke hente doktoren. Nei doktoren ville bare gi ham en gul salve og en hvit salve, og disse to salver ville man så ta synderlig feil av og bruke dem forkjært og drepe ham på stedet. Karlsen var død av det; hun husket nok Karlsen? Ja han var død av det. Hvorledes det nu var eller ikke var så hadde Karlsen fått en fiskeangel i strupen, og da doktoren kom med sine medisiner så viste det seg at det bare var et glass ganske almindelig dåps- og brønnvann som kvalte ham. Hehehe, skjønt man ikke burde le av det …. Sara, De må ikke tro at jeg er full; vel? Idéassosiasjoner, hører De der? Encyklopedister med mere. Tell på knappene, Sara, og se om jeg er full …. Hør, nu går kvernene, byens kverner! Gud for en ravnekrok De lever i, Sara; jeg kunne ville utfri Dem av Deres fienders vold, som skrevet står. Gå til helvede, gå til helvede! Hvem er De forresten? I er falske allesammen og jeg skal sette hver især av jer mot veggen. De tror det ikke? Å, hvor jeg har hatt jer i kikkerten! Jeg er overbevist om at løytnant Hansen har lovet Minutten to ullskjorter, men se om han har fått dem! Og mener De at Minutten torde tilstå det? La meg rive Dem ut av den villfarelse, Minutten torde ikke tilstå det, han buktet seg vekk; er du med på den! Tar jeg ikke feil, hr. Grøgaard, så sitter De nu igjen og ler svinsk bak Deres avis? Ikke? Nå, det er meg også like meget …. Er De her ennu, Sara? Godt! Hvis De vil sitte her i fem minutter enda så skal jeg fortelle Dem noe; er det en avtale? Men tenk Dem nu først en mann på hvem øyenbrynene litt efter litt faller av. Kan De holde fast på det? På hvem øyenbrynene faller av. Dernest må det være meg tillatt å spørre Dem om De noensinne har ligget i en seng som har knirket? Tell på knappene og se om De har gjort det. Jeg har Dem sterkt mistenkt. Forresten har jeg hatt alle byens folk i kikkerten som mistenkt. Forresten. Og jeg har skilt meg godt fra mitt arbeide, jeg har gitt jer et snes overmåte rike samtaleemner av gangen og gjort livet uordentlig for jer, jeg har lagt den ene urolige scene efter den andre inn i jers skikkelige blindtarmtilværelse. Hoho, hvor kvernene har suset, hvor kvernene har suset! Hvorpå jeg råder Dem, velaktet pike Sara Kaffeknekt Josefsdatter til å spise klar kjøttsuppe mens den er varm, for står den til den blir kold er det Gud forbanne meg ikke annet enn bare vannet tilbake …. Mere konjakk, Sara, jeg har ondt i hodet, på begge sider av hodet og midt oppi hodet. Det er ganske forunderlig ondt ….","No he would not undress; what was she thinking? Maybe it was not in the middle of the day? He clearly heard the chirping of birds yet. She was not going to get the doctor either. No, the doctor would only give him a yellow ointment and a white ointment, and these two ointments would then be greatly mistaken for using them incorrectly and killing him on the spot. Karlsen was dead from it; she probably remembered Karlsen? Yes he was dead from it. How it was or not, Karlsen had got a fish angler in his throat, and when the doctor came with his medicine, it turned out that it was only a glass of fairly ordinary baptismal and well water that suffocated him. Hehehe, although you should not laugh at it…. Sara, You must not think I'm drunk; well? Idea associations, do you hear there? Encyclopedists and more. Count on the buttons, Sara, and see if I'm drunk…. Listen, now the grinders are going, the city grinders! God for a raven hook You live in, Sara; I could deliver you from the violence of your enemies, as it is written. Go to hell, go to hell! Who are you by the way? You are all fake and I will put each of you against the wall. They do not think so? Oh, how I have had you in the binoculars! I'm convinced that Lieutenant Hansen has promised Minutes two wool shirts, but see if he has got them! And do you think that Minute should admit it? Let me tear you out of that delusion, the minute did not dare to admit it, he bent away; are you in it! I'm not mistaken, sir. Grøgaard, are you now sitting back and laughing swineily behind your newspaper? Not? Well, it's just as much to me…. Are you here yet, Sara? Well! If you want to sit here for another five minutes, I'll tell you something; is it a deal? But first imagine a man on whom the eyebrows fall off little by little. Can you hold on to that? On whom the eyebrows fall off. Secondly, may I be allowed to ask you if you have ever slept in a creaking bed? Count on the buttons and see if you have done so. I strongly suspect you. By the way, I have had all the people of the city in the binoculars as suspects. By the way. And I have parted well from my work, I have given you a dozen extremely rich topics of conversation at a time and made life messy for you, I have put one restless scene after another into your proper appendix life. Hoho, where the grinders have whizzed, where the grinders have whizzed! Whereupon I advise you, well-respected girl Sara Kaffeknekt Josefsdatter to eat clear meat soup while it is hot, because it stands until it gets cold, God forbid I do nothing but just water back…. More brandy, Sara, I have a headache, on both sides of my head and in the middle of my head. It is quite a wonderful evil….","No, he didn’t want to undress. What was the matter with her—it was the middle of the day, wasn’t it? He distinctly heard the birds singing. She was not to get the doctor either. The doctor would only give him a yellow salve and a white salve; then they would make a fatal mistake, get them all mixed up, and he would be dead in no time. That’s how Karlsen had died; did she remember Karlsen? Yes, that was the way he died. Well, at any rate, Karlsen had gotten a fishhook in his throat, and when the doctor arrived with his medicines, it turned out to be a glass of pure, baptismal spring water that had choked him. But that was nothing to laugh at. “Sara, you mustn’t think I’m drunk. I’m just stringing ideas together —you know what I mean. The Encyclopedists, and so on. Count the buttons, Sara, and see if I’m drunk! Listen! The town mills are in motion! What a god-forsaken hole you live in, Sara! I’d like to deliver you from the hands of your enemies, as it says in the Bible. Oh, go to hell! Who are you, anyway? You’re hypocrites, every last one of you, and I’m going to call you to task for it, all of you! Don’t you believe me? I’ve been keeping my eye on you! I know that Lieutenant Hansen promised The Midget two wool shirts, but do you think he delivered them? And do you think The Midget would dare to admit that he hadn’t? Let me assure you that he would never dare! He squirms and avoids the subject, doesn’t he? If I’m not mistaken, Grøgaard, you’re sitting there grinning your swinish grin behind that newspaper. You’re not? Well, it makes no difference to me. Are you still here, Sara? Fine! If you’ll sit here five minutes longer, I’ll tell you a story—all right? But first try to imagine a man whose eyebrows are gradually falling out. You’ve got that? The man is losing his eyebrows. Next, may I ask you if you’ve ever slept in a bed that creaked? Count your buttons and see if you have. I’ve been most suspicious of you. I’ve been watching everyone in town, for that matter. And I think I’ve fulfilled a function. I’ve given all of you a dozen juicy topics of conversation, and no end of distraction in your dull lives. I’ve created one scandal after another in your dreary, conformist lives! What a terrible noise those mills are making—what a deafening roar! Therefore I advise you, respectable spinster, Sara Barmaid, daughter of Josef, to drink the clear meat broth while it’s hot, because if you let it get cold, you’ll have nothing left but water. More cognac, Sara; my head hurts on both sides and up the middle. It’s an odd kind of pain …”","No, he didn’t want to undress, what was she thinking of? Wasn’t it the middle of the day? He could still clearly hear the birds chirping. She mustn’t fetch the doctor either. Why, the doctor would only give him some yellow ointment and some white ointment, and then they would mistake one for the other and use them the wrong way, killing him on the spot. Karlsen had died of it; she remembered Karlsen, didn’t she? Yes, he’d died of it. Karlsen had somehow gotten a fish hook in his throat, but when the doctor came with his medicines it turned out he’d choked on a glass of quite ordinary christening water from the well.

Let me disabuse you on that score: Miniman did not dare admit it, he wriggled out of it. Do you get me? If I’m not mistaken, Mr. Grøgaard, you’re again laughing your dirty laugh behind your newspaper, aren’t you? No? Well, no matter.... Are you still there, Sara? Good! If you’ll sit here another five minutes, I’ll tell you something; is it an agreement? But first try to imagine a man whose eyebrows are gradually falling out. Can you hold on to that? Whose eyebrows are falling out. Next, may I ask if you’ve ever slept in a bed that creaked? Count on your buttons to see if you have. I’m very suspicious of you. For that matter, everyone in town is under suspicion, I’ve been keeping an eye on them all. For that matter. And I’ve acquitted myself well , I’ve given you all a score of extremely rich topics of conversation every time and turned your lives into disarray; I’ve contributed one turbulent scene after another to your respectable appendix-like existence. Ho-ho, how the mills have been whirring! Whereupon, my highly respected maiden, Sara Tosspot Josefsdatter, I advise you to eat your broth while it’s hot, because if you wait until it’s cold, I swear to God there won’t be anything left but water.... More cognac, Sara , I have a headache, on both sides of my head and in the middle. It’s quite strange, the way it hurts....”"

Han hilste på frøken Andresen som også hadde hvitt forkle; han bad om vin og hun bragte ham champagne.,"Nagel searched for Dagny; she was nowhere to be seen.

"Ja de var fra meg. Men det var ikke for å sprade med det at jeg gjorde det; Gud er mitt vidne. Det er heller ikke noe å tale om en sådan bagatell. Jeg kjøpte dem igåraftes efter at jeg gikk hjem fra Dem.

"Mens de sitter der kommer en høy, skjegget mann nedefter midtgangen. Han bærer en fiolinkasse i hånden. Det er organisten, han hadde levert sine numre og var ferdig til å gå hjem.

Minutten hadde ganske riktig vært hos ham og villet kjøpe den; men se, det var en umulighet, det var et arvestykke, han betraktet den akkurat som et lite menneske, så kjær var den ham.

"Men Nagel overtalte henne til iallfall å drikke et lite glass til. Martha var kledd i sort; den nye kjole satt smukt, men kledde henne ikke, den gjorde den sært utseende pike eldre og stakk formeget av mot hennes hvite hår. Bare øynene ulmet sterkt, og når hun lo ble dette fyrige ansikt ganske spillevende.","But Nagel persuaded her to at least drink another glass. Martha was dressed in black; the new dress sat beautifully but did not dress her, it made the strange looking girl older and ran shaped off against her white hair. Only her eyes smoldered strongly, and when she laughed, this fiery face became quite playful.","But Nagel persuaded her to have one more glass. Her new dress fitted very well but didn’t suit her. It made this curious woman look older and contrasted harshly with her white hair.

"Har jeg gjort det? Hva er det De sier? Hehe, De har narret Dem selv, gode mann. Jeg har ganske visst tømt flasken inatt; men merk Dem: jeg har ikke smakt innholdet selv.","Have I done that? What are you saying? Hehe, you fooled yourself, good man. I must have emptied the bottle last night; but note: I have not tasted the contents myself.","“What do you mean? I’m afraid you’re mistaken, my good man. I did empty the vial last night, but I certainly didn’t drink its contents.”","“I have? What are you saying? Heh-heh, you’ve fooled yourself, my good man. It’s quite true I emptied the bottle last night, but take note: I didn’t taste a drop of its contents.”"
"Nei, svarte Nagel atter og rystet på hodet; han smilte også. Det gjør jeg ikke. Men plutselig, uten noen foranledning reiser han seg opp og sier mens hans øyne blir ganske skinnende: Ja jeg er glad idag. Det har vært så deilig i hele dag, fra jeg våknet imorges; jeg har gått i den skjønneste drøm i ti timer. Vil De tenke Dem: jeg forfølges bokstavelig av forestillingen om å befinne meg i en båt av duftende tre og med et seil av lyseblå silke, klippet i en halvmåne. Er det ikke vakkert? Duften av båten kan jeg ikke beskrive, det kan jeg ikke gjøre om jeg aldri så gjerne ville, om jeg var aldri så flink til å finne det rette ord. Men tenk det forekommer meg at jeg er ute og fisker, og at jeg bruker en sølvangel. Unnskyld, synes ikke iallfall De, mine damer, at dette er …. Nei jeg vet ikke.","No, Nagel answered again, shaking his head; he smiled too. I do not. But suddenly, without any reason, he gets up and says while his eyes become quite shiny: Yes I am happy today. It's been so lovely all day, since I woke up this morning; I have been going in the most beautiful dream for ten hours. Do you want to think: I am literally haunted by the notion of being in a boat of fragrant wood and with a sail of light blue silk, cut in a crescent moon. Is not it beautiful? I can not describe the smell of the boat, I can not do it if I never wanted to, if I was never so good at finding the right word. But imagine it seems to me that I am out fishing, and that I use a silver rod. Sorry, at least you guys do not think this is…. No, i do not know.","“No, I don’t,” said Nagel again, smiling and shaking his head. Then suddenly, impulsively, he jumped to his feet, and with eyes that sparkled he said: “I’m so happy today. It’s been a wonderful day from the moment I woke up this morning. For ten hours I’ve been walking around in a most exquisite trance. I feel as if I were in a boat of scented wood with a crescent-shaped, pale-blue silk sail. Isn’t that a beautiful reverie? I couldn’t possibly describe the fragrance of that boat, no matter how I tried. I have the feeling that I’m out fishing—fishing with a silver hook. But, ladies, don’t you think that it’s … ? Well, I don’t know.”","“No,” Nagel replied again, shaking his head; he gave a smile as well. “I don’t.” But suddenly, apropos of nothing, he gets up and says, his eyes sparkling, “I’m so happy today. It has been so wonderful all day, from the moment I woke up this morning; for ten hours I’ve been walking around in a most beautiful dream. Can you imagine: I’m literally haunted by the idea of finding myself in a boat of aromatic wood with a sail of pale-blue silk, cut in the shape of a half-moon. Isn’t that pretty? I cannot describe the scent of the boat; no matter how hard I tried, or how skillful I was at finding the right words, I couldn’t do it. But just think, I feel as though I’m out fishing, that I’m fishing with a silver hook. Pardon me, ladies, but don’t you, at least, think1 it is ... Well, I don’t know.”"
"Hvem jeg er, for eksempel, sa han og så på henne. Med én gang farer en anelse gjennom hans hode, han forstår at noe har undergravet hennes tillit til ham, noe fiendtlig som har trengt seg mellom henne og ham; han spør:","Who I am, for example, he said, looking at her. As soon as a hint passes through his head, he realizes that something has undermined her trust in him, something hostile that has intruded between her and him; he asks:","“Who I am?” he repeated, looking straight at her. Suddenly he was struck by the thought that something had come between them, a hostile force that had shattered her confidence in him.","“Who I am, for example?” he said, looking at her. He’s instantly struck by a suspicion—he understands that something has undermined her confidence in him, something hostile that has forced its way between them."

"Herregud, nu var det nettopp slik stemning for det, især hadde damene formelig bestormet doktoren igåraftes om å få det i lås. Frøken Andresen hadde ikke gitt ham rist eller ro og frøken Kielland hadde endog trukket ham avsides og bedt ham om aldeles ikke å slippe Nagel før han hadde lovet å komme.","My God, now there was just such a mood for it, especially the ladies had formally stormed the doctor last night to get it locked. Miss Andresen had not given him rest or peace and Miss Kielland had even pulled him aside and asked him not to let go of Nagel at all until he had promised to come.","Just when everyone was so worked up about it! The ladies had insisted last night that the doctor must not come back until the arrangements had been made. Miss Andresen had been very insistent, and Miss Kielland had taken him aside and begged him to keep at Nagel until he promised.","With such a strong feeling in his favor right now, especially among the ladies; they had made a real nuisance of themselves last night, begging him to make it come off.

"Nu taler Nagel ustanselig, forteller i ett vekk løyerlige småhistorier og opplevelser, sludrer avsted om løst og fast, febrilsk, forsert, redd for at hun skulle gå hvis han tier. Han skifter kulør av anstrengelse, løper surr og tar seg hjelpeløst opp til hodet for å finne tråden igjen og Martha synes at han er morsom også da og ler troskyldig. Hun kjeder seg ikke, hennes gamle hjerte svulmer opp og hun bringes endog til selv å tale med. Hvor hun var merkelig varm og naiv! Da han sa at livet var ganske ubegripelig elendig, ikke sant? Skål på det! svarte hun, denne kvinne som år efter år levet så fattig av å selge egg på torvet, at livet …. nei det var ikke meget slemt, mangen gang var det godt!","Now Nagel talks incessantly, tells in one go ridiculous little stories and experiences, chats away about loose and firm, feverish, forced, afraid that she would leave if he was silent. He changes color from exertion, runs buzzing and helplessly goes up to his head to find the thread again and Martha thinks he is funny even then and laughs faithfully. She is not bored, her old heart swells and she is even brought to talk to herself. How strangely warm and naive she was! When he said life was pretty incomprehensibly miserable, right? Cheers to that! she replied, this woman who year after year lived so poorly by selling eggs on the market, that life…. no it was not very bad, many times it was good!","Then Nagel began talking incessantly, keeping up a steady flow of funny stories and anecdotes. He chatted away, covering every imaginable topic, speaking at an intense, feverish pace, terrified at the thought that she might leave if he stopped. The strain of it made him flush, he became confused and tapped his head in desperation, trying to pick up the thread of his story. Martha thought this was part of the fun and laughed like a child. She was far from bored. Her spinster’s heart leaped with joy , she lost her inhibitions, she even joined in the talk. There was such a warm glow about her, and how naïve she was! When he remarked that life was an unfathomable misery—didn’t she agree?—this woman, who had lived for years in poverty and had sustained herself by selling eggs at the marketplace, retorted that life wasn’t at all bad, often it was even quite good! Often life was good, she said!","And now Nagel speaks without letup, relating funny little stories and adventures one after the other; he jabbers on about this and that, feverishly and at a forced pace, fearful that she might leave if he stopped. The effort makes him flushed, he gets confused and, at his wits’ end, clutches his head trying to pick up the thread of his story; but Martha finds him amusing even then and laughs innocently. She’s anything but bored, her old heart swells, and she’s even moved to put in a word herself. How strangely warm and naive she was! When he said—and didn’t she agree?—that life was wretched past comprehension, she replied, “Let’s drink to that!”—this woman who eked out a meager living year after year by selling eggs in the marketplace, so that life ... No, it wasn’t so bad, often it was good!"

"Skal De nu begynne igjen! sa hun. Hvis De ikke selv har fortjent den, hvorledes kan De så gjemme på en slik ting, bære den på Dem?","Should you now start again! she said. If you did not deserve it, how can you hide such a thing, carry it on you?","“Are you going to start that all over again!” she said. “If you didn’t earn it, why do you carry it on you?”","“Starting again, aren’t you?3 If you didn’t earn it, how come you hang on to a thing like that, even wear it maybe?”"

"Ja værsågod! sier Nagel, der kan De selv se, der er bare papirer. Jeg forstår det ikke.","Yes, Please! says Nagel, there you can see for yourself, there are just papers. I do not get it.",“Go right ahead!” said Nagel. “You can see for yourself that it contains only identification papers.

"Til helvede, din usle, krypende snok! skriker Nagel og legger avsted i løp. Han raver oppefter veien som en full mann, snubler, faller og reiser seg igjen; alt danser rundt for ham og han løper fremdeles, løper i retning av byen. Nu hadde Minutten for annen gang krysset hans planer! I himmelens navn, hva skulle han tilsist finne på å gjøre? Hvor det svirret for hans øyne! Hvor det suset over byen! Han falt igjen.","To hell, you lousy, creeping snook! screams Nagel and sets off in a race. He roams up the road like a drunk man, stumbles, falls and gets up again; everything is dancing around for him and he is still running, running in the direction of the city.

He fell again.","Again The Midget, always The Midget. “May the devil take you, you filthy, crawling snake!” Nagel screamed, and began to run. He staggered along the road like a drunk, tripped, fell, got to his feet again. Everything was blurred, and he went on running and stumbling along in the direction of town. For the second time The Midget had wrecked his plans. In the name of God, what would he think of next? Everything swayed, and a strange roaring sound was coming from town—what was it? He fell again.","“Go to hell, you miserable, crawling snake!” Nagel screams, and starts running. He staggers up the road like a drunk, stumbles, falls and gets up again; everything is spinning before his eyes and he’s still running, running in the direction of the town. For the second time Miniman had frustrated his plans! In heaven’s name, what would he finally have to dream up? What swirling confusion before his eyes! What a soughing noise above the town! Again he fell."
"Det ble med ett aldeles stille. Minutten så skrekkslagen fra den ene til den andre og sa: Men …. Nei men ….? Lenger kom han ikke, men dette gjentok han gang på gang med dirrende røst og som om det var et spørsmål. Ingen annen sa noe. Fullmektigen trådte fortumlet et skritt tilbake og fant sin stol; han var blitt ganske hvit i ansiktet og sa ikke noe han heller. Hans munn stod åpen.","It suddenly became completely quiet. The minute looked terrified from one to the other and said: But…. No but ….? He did not come any further, but he repeated this again and again in a trembling voice and as if it were a question.

Terrified, The Midget looked from one to the other, stammering, “ But … No, but … ?” He didn’t get any further but kept on repeating the words over and over in a trembling voice as if they were a question.

"Hør, sa hun, De må ikke gå og forundre Dem over at jeg nu har vandret ute så sent på natten; vil De vel? Vi pleier å gjøre det så her. Vi er nemlig bare bønder her omkring, bare naturbarn. Adjunkten og jeg har gått om her på veien like til den lyse morgen og pratet.","Listen, she said, you must not go and marvel that I have now walked out so late at night; will you? We usually do that here. We are just farmers around here, just children of nature.

Dagny spurte:,Dagny asked:,“But don’t you think we have a rich mythology of our own?” said Dagny.,Dagny asked.
"Og hva så! For syvende og siste gang hva så? Jeg elsker deg allikevel, og, Dagny, du vet godt at jeg elsker deg allikevel og at jeg angrer alle mine bitre ord. Men hva så? Hva nytter det meg? Og dessuten, hvo vet om det ikke er best således? Hvis du sier at det er best således så er det også så, jeg føler det samme som du, jeg er en stanset vandrer. Men om du også hadde villet og du hadde brutt med alle andre og bundet deg til meg – hva jeg ikke fortjente, men allikevel, la oss sette det –, hva hadde det ført til? Du hadde i høyden villet hjelpe meg til å utføre mine bedrifter, å gjøre min gjerning i verden, – jeg sier deg, det gjør meg skamfull, mitt hjerte stanser av skam ved å tenke på det. Jeg ville gjøre som du ville fordi jeg elsker deg, men jeg ville lide ved det i min sjel …. Nå, hva i allverden skal det være godt for å sette den ene ting efter den andre, å oppstille umulige utgangspunkter? Du ville ikke bryte med alle andre og ikke binde deg til meg, du betakker deg, ler meg ut, håner meg; hva har jeg så med deg å bestille? Punktum.","And so what! For the seventh and final time what then? I love you anyway, and, Dagny, you know very well that I love you anyway and that I regret all my bitter words. But what then? What good is it to me? And besides, who knows if it's not best that way? If you say it's best that way then it's also so, I feel the same as you, I'm a stopped hiker. But if you also wanted to and you had broken with everyone else and bound yourself to me - what I did not deserve, but still, let's put it - what would it have led to? You wanted to help me do my business, to do my work in the world, I tell you, it makes me ashamed, my heart stops shining at the thought of it. I would do as you please because I love you, but I would suffer from it in my soul…. Now, what in the world would it be good to put one thing after another, to set up impossible starting points? You would not break with everyone else and not bind yourself to me, you cover yourself, laugh at me, mock me; so what do I have with you to order? Dot.","I fervendy pray the devil take you … But I’m asking myself for the last time: What good would it do? I would still love you; I’ll always love you, Dagny—you know that, and that I regret my bitter words. What is the good of anything? Besides, who knows if it isn’t better this way? If you say so, that is the way it will be. My wandering is at an end. But suppose you had wanted me—that you had broken off with the others and bound yourself to me—something I didn’t deserve, but let’s suppose for a moment—what would it have led to? Your aim would probably have been to help me perform great deeds, accomplish something in the world. I feel so ashamed, so utterly humiliated, when I think about it. I would do as you wish because I love you, but it would devastate my soul … What is the use of making all these conjectures, of setting up imaginary premises? You would never break with the world, and you would never accept me. You say no, thank you, scorn me, laugh at me—why then should I concern myself with you? Period.","And so what? For the seventh and last time, so what? I love you all the same, and you know very well, Dagny, that I love you all the same and that I regret my bitter words. But so what? What good does it do me? And besides, who knows whether it isn’t better this way? If you say it is, then in fact it is so; I feel the same as you , I’m a wanderer brought to a halt. But suppose you had gone along, that you had broken with everyone else and committed yourself to me—which I didn’t deserve, but let’s suppose it anyway—what would it have led to? At most you would have wanted to help me perform my tasks, fulfill my mission in the world. I tell you, it makes me feel ashamed, my heart stops with shame at the thought. I would do as you wished because I loved you, but it would make my soul suffer.... But what on earth is the use of supposing one thing after another, of setting up these impossible points of departure? You refused to break with everybody and commit yourself to me—you decline with thanks, laugh me to scorn, mock me; so what have I to do with you? Period."

"Da Nagel kom opp på kirkegården var ennu ingen å se. Han gikk bort til graven og kikket ned i den; det lå to hvite blomster nede i bunnen. Hvem hadde kastet dem der, og i hvilken hensikt? Jeg har sett disse hvite blomster før, tenkte han. Plutselig falt det ham inn at han var ubarbert. Han så på klokken, overveiet et øyeblikk og gikk så hurtig ned i byen igjen. Midt på torvet så han sorenskriverfullmektigen komme imot seg; Nagel stilet rett på ham og så på ham, men ingen av herrene sa noe, heller ikke hilste de. Nagel gikk inn i barberstuen. I det samme begynte kirkeklokkene å ringe for likfølget.","When Nagel arrived at the cemetery, no one was yet to be seen. He went to the tomb and looked down into it; there were two white flowers at the bottom. Who had thrown them there, and for what purpose? I've seen these white flowers before, he thought. Suddenly it dawned on him that he was unshaven. He looked at his watch, pondered for a moment, and then went quickly down into the city again. In the middle of the square he saw the assistant clerk coming towards him; Nagel looked straight at him and looked at him, but none of the gentlemen said anything, nor did they greet. Nagel went into the barber shop. At the same time, the church bells began to ring for the funeral procession.","WHEN Nagel got to the cemetery, he found himself alone. He went up to the grave and looked down into it; two white flowers were lying there. Who had thrown them down there, and why? He had the feeling that he had seen those flowers before. Suddenly it occurred to him that he needed a shave. He looked at his watch, and after a moment’s reflection, he quickly made his way back to town. When he got to the middle of the square, he saw the deputy coming toward him. Nagel kept on walking; they stared at each other but neither of them spoke, nor did they exchange greetings. Just as Nagel entered the barbershop, the church bells began ringing for the funeral.","WHEN NAGEL GOT TO THE CEMETERY, no one was yet to be seen.

"Johan Nagel våknet om morgningen ved at Sara banket på og bragte ham hans aviser. Han så dem flyktig igjennom og kastet dem på gulvet efterhvert som han ble ferdig med dem. Et telegram om at Gladstone hadde holdt sengen i to dager av forkjølelse, men nu var oppe igjen leste han to ganger igjennom og brast derpå i latter. Så la han armene bak sin nakke og falt inn i følgende tankerekke, alt imens han nu og da talte høyt med seg selv:","Johan Nagel woke up in the morning when Sara knocked and brought him his newspapers. He glanced through them and threw them on the floor as he finished them.

Then he put his arms behind his neck and fell into the following train of thought, all the while occasionally talking loudly to himself:","THE next morning Johan Nagel was awakened by Sara knocking on the door to bring him the papers.

"Nagel vridde seg litt: Sett nu at han kunne bare denne fattige stubb, dette ene usammenhengende potpourri, at han hadde øvet seg opp til det høyeste nettopp i disse par danser for å forbause folk en kveld! Og dessuten spilte han falskt som en synd; han holdt ikke ut å høre på det selv, neigu om han gjorde!","Nagel twisted a little: Suppose he only knew this poor stump, this one incoherent potpourri, that he had rehearsed to the highest just in these couple of dances to amaze people one night! And besides, he played falsely as a sin; he could not bear to listen to it himself, neigu if he did!","Nagel began to feel awkward. What if he said he couldn’t play anything except that miserable medley of tunes that he had learned just to make an impression that evening? Besides, he played so out of tune that he couldn’t even bear listening to himself!","Nagel squirmed. Suppose he knew only this poor fragment, this incoherent potpourri, that he had practiced these few dances to the highest level he could achieve to astonish people some evening!

"Jeg lo til det og svarte at det ville jeg ikke si, ikke til noe menneske, han måtte ha meg unnskyldt, farvel! …. Jo jeg skal nok svare ham ….

Nei jeg visste nok at jeg ville få frakken engang; hva sa jeg ikke? Det tar ofte litt tid, men jeg venter aldri forgjeves. Løytnant Hansen lovet meg engang to ullskjorter som han ikke brukte mere. Det er to år siden nu, men jeg er så sikker på å få dem som om jeg allerede hadde dem på. Slik er det alltid, folk husker det senere og gir meg hva jeg behøver når tiden kommer. Men synes De ikke at jeg er som et nytt menneske i ordentlige klær?","I laughed at it and replied that I would not say that, not to any man, he had to apologize to me, goodbye! …. Yes I will probably answer him…. Look, it's probably thirteen years now since I wore a new coat; I have calculated for…. I have to thank you for the last money you gave me. It was again too much money for a disabled man, what should I use it all for? You make me so dizzy with all your good deeds that it's a joke; it's like everything's loose inside me and can not be calm. Hahahaha. But God help me, I'm a child. No I knew enough that I would get the coat someday; what did i not say? It often takes some time, but I never wait in vain.

But do not you think I'm like a new person in proper clothes?","“I laughed and said I wouldn’t tell—not anyone—and he’d have to excuse me, goodby! Oh, I knew how to handle him! Well, I thought about it and came to the conclusion that it must be about thirteen years since I’ve had a new coat. I want to thank you for the money you gave me last time. It was far too much for someone like me. What am I going to do with all that money? You overwhelm me with kindness; I’m all mixed up inside. But I’m being very childish —I knew I would get the coat some day—I told you so, didn’t I? It sometimes takes time, but I’m never disappointed in the end. Lieutenant Hansen once promised me two wool shirts that he didn’t wear any more. That was two years ago, but I’m just as sure of getting them as if I were already wearing them.

"Nei om forlatelse, svarte han. Jo gjerne det forresten; hvorfor ikke? Det kommer ikke an på hva De kaller det. Jeg har vært deilig bergtatt i hele dag, enten det nu er hallusinasjon eller ei. Det begynte imorges mens jeg ennu lå i sengen. Jeg hørte en flue summe, dette var min første bevisste forestilling efter at jeg våknet; dernest så jeg solen sive inn gjennom et hull i gardinet og med ett slag var en fin, lys stemning oppstått i meg. Jeg fikk en fornemmelse av sommer i min sjel, tenk Dem en bløt susen i gresset, og at denne susen går gjennom Deres hjerte. Hallusinasjon, – ja det var det nok, det vet jeg ikke; men legg merke til at jeg måtte ha vært i en viss given tilstand av mottagelighet, at jeg hørte fluen nettopp i det rette øyeblikk, at jeg i dette øyeblikk trengte nettopp den sort og så meget lys, altså bare én stråle sol fra et hull i gardinet, og så videre. Men da jeg senere stod opp og gikk ut så jeg først en smukk dame i et vindu – dermed så han hen på frøken Andresen som slo øynene ned – dernest så jeg et stort antall skip, så en liten pike som holdt en katt i armene, og så videre, altsammen ting som gjorde hver sitt inntrykk på meg. Litt efter gikk jeg inn i skogen og det var der jeg fikk se båten og halvmånen, bare ved å ligge på ryggen og glane opp i himmelen.","No to forgiveness, he replied. Well, by the way; why not? It does not depend on what you call it. I have been lovely rocking all day, whether it is hallucination or not. It started this morning while I was still in bed. I heard a fly buzz, this was my first conscious performance after I woke up; then I saw the sun seep in through a hole in the curtain and with one blow a nice, bright mood arose in me. I got a feeling of summer in my soul, imagine a soft whistle in the grass, and that this whisper goes through your heart. Hallucination, - yes that was enough, I do not know; but notice that I must have been in a certain given state of receptivity, that I heard the fly at just the right moment, that at this moment I needed just that black and so much light, that is, only one ray of sun from a hole in the curtain, and so on. But when I later got up and went out I first saw a beautiful lady in a window - thus he looked at Miss Andresen who closed her eyes - then I saw a large number of ships, then a little girl holding a cat in her arms, and so on, all things that each made an impression on me. A little later I went into the woods and that was where I got to see the boat and the crescent, just by lying on my back and glancing up at the sky.","“No, it isn’t,” Nagel retorted. “Well, if you like, why not? It doesn’t matter what you call it. I’ve been living in an enchanted world all day, whether it’s hallucination or not. It all began this morning while I was still in bed. I heard a fly buzzing; this was the first sound I heard upon awakening. The next thing, I saw the sun seeping in through a hole in the curtain, and suddenly I felt extraordinarily happy. Summer was in my soul. The wind was stirring gently through the grass, and through my whole being. Hallucination—perhaps; I don’t know. But I do know that my mind was in tune even with the buzzing of that fly; and to make it perfect, there was that ray of sunlight that I needed just at that moment, filtering through the hole in the curtain. “When I got up and went out, the first thing I saw was a beauitful lady at a window—” He looked at Miss Andresen, who lowered her eyes. “Then I saw a lot of boats and a little girl holding a cat in her arms—one impression was superimposed on the other, but each made its separate impact on me. Then I went into the woods and it was there that I had the vision of the boat and the crescent sail; it came to me as I lay on my back, looking up into the sky.”","“No, I beg your pardon,” he replied. “Well, if you like, why not? It doesn’t matter what you call it. I’ve been under a delightful spell all day, whether it’s hallucination or not. It began this morning while I was still in bed. I heard a fly buzzing, that was my first conscious thought after I awoke; then I saw the sunlight filtering in through a hole in the curtain, and at one stroke a delicate, light mood sprang up within me. I had a sensation of summer in my soul—try to imagine a soft rustle in the grass and that this rustle passes through your heart. Hallucination—well, maybe it was, I don’t know; but don’t forget that I must’ve been in a certain prior state of susceptibility, that I heard the fly exactly at the right moment, a moment in which I needed just that kind of light and in that amount, namely, a single ray of sunlight from a hole in the curtain, and so on. After I got up and went out, the first thing I saw was an attractive woman in a window” —he cast a glance at Miss Andresen, who lowered her eyes—“next I saw a great number of ships, then a little girl with a cat in her arms, and so forth, all of it things that made an impression on me.

"Hun ble et øyeblikk aldeles slagen, hun holdt munnen åpen og så på ham, fant ikke et ord å si og glemte endog å sette glasset på bordet. Dette varte et helt minutt. Men hun fattet seg igjen, tilkastet ham et rasende blikk, fullt av alt det opprør hun følte i seg, et par øyne som gav ham et knusende svar, og vendte ham ryggen med ett. Da hun gikk slengte hun glasset fra seg på et bord nede ved døren. Hun forsvant inn i salen.","She was completely beaten for a moment, she kept her mouth open and looked at him, could not find a word to say and even forgot to put the glass on the table. This lasted a whole minute. But she regained her composure, gave him a furious look, full of all the rebellion she felt in her, a pair of eyes that gave him a crushing answer, and turned his back on him at once. When she left, she threw the glass away on a table down by the door. She disappeared into the hall.","and then he’ll probably remember.” For a moment she was stunned. She stared at him with her mouth open, unable to utter a word—she even forgot to put down her glass—and she stood there for a full minute as if frozen. But then she regained her composure, looked at him with all the exasperation and anger that had built up within her—a look she meant to annihilate him with—and turned and walked away. When she reached the door, she slammed her glass down on a nearby table and went back into the hall.","For a moment she was completely stunned; staring at him all agape, she couldn’t think of a word to say, even forgetting to put down her glass. This went on for a whole minute. Then she collected herself, threw him a furious glance imbued with all her inner tumult, from a pair of eyes that gave him a crushing answer, and abruptly turned her back on him. She slammed her glass down on a table by the door as she left. She disappeared into the hall."
"Hehe, er det ikke sant? Tror De at jeg sitter her og lyver for Dem?","Hehe, isn 't that right? Do you think I'm sitting here lying to you?",“It isn’t true? Are you accusing me of lying?”,"“Heh-heh, it’s not? Do you think I’m lying to you?”"
"Så føyet han henne heri, han tok en kniv opp av lommen og skar knappen av. I det samme han tok kniven opp falt noen småpenger og en medalje i et sørgelig mishandlet bånd ut av hans lomme. Han bøyet seg hastig ned og tok tingene opp mens hun stod og så på. Da sa hun:","Then he added her in it, he took a knife out of his pocket and cut off the button. As he picked up the knife, some small change and a medal in a sadly abused band fell out of his pocket. He quickly bent down and picked things up while she stood and watched. Da sa hun:","To please her, he pulled a knife out of his pocket and cut the button off. As he took the knife out, some coins and a medal with a frayed ribbon fell out. She watched him as he quickly bent down to pick them up.","Humoring her, he pulled a knife out of his pocket and snipped the button off. As he took the knife out, some change and a medal on a sadly abused ribbon fell out of his pocket. He quickly bent down and picked up the articles as she stood watching. Then she said, “A medal, is it?"
Nagel ble med ett livlig og svarte straks; uten noen rimelig grunn fikk han endog en lett rødme i ansiktet.,Nagel suddenly became lively and responded immediately; for no reasonable reason he even got a slight blush on his face.,Nagel suddenly seemed to come to life.,"Nagel suddenly became animated and replied at once; for no apparent reason, his face even showed a faint blush."
"Nu gjaldt det å gå efter nesen og slå seg ned på det første det beste tilfeldige sted. Fremfor alt ingen beregning og ingen sentimentalitet; hva hadde ikke Karlsen funnet på i sin latterlige fortvilelse! Og som om denne smule affære var så mange anstalter verd! …. Han merker at hans ene skobånd er gått opp og han stanser, setter foten på en tue og knytter det. Litt efter setter han seg ned.","Now it was time to go after the nose and settle down in the first the best random place. Above all, no calculation and no sentimentality; what had Karlsen not come up with in his ridiculous despair! And as if this bit of an affair was worth so many institutions! …. He notices that one of his shoelaces has gone up and he stops, puts his foot on a toe and ties it. After a while he sits down.","He walked straight ahead, looking for a place to stop. This was going to be done without deliberation, without sentimentality. What a fool Karlsen had made of himself in his desperation! As if a trifling love affair warranted such melodrama! He noticed that one of his shoelaces had come undone and he stopped, set his foot on a tuft, and tied it. Shortly afterwards he sat down.","Now he simply had to follow his nose and settle in any old place. Above all, no calculation and no sentimentality; look what Karlsen had come up with in his ridiculous despair! As if this trifling matter was worth making so much fuss about! ... Noticing that one of his shoelaces is undone, he stops, puts his foot on a tussock and ties it. A moment later he sits down."
Hvorledes kunne De vite det?,How did you know that?,“How could you possibly know that?”,“How could you know that?”
Nu var Minutten kommet til døren. Han syntes å ville gjøre kort prosess og forlate huset straks. Samtalen ble også mere og mere uhyggelig.,Now the Minute had come to the door. He seemed to want to make short process and leave the house immediately. The conversation also became more and more eerie.,The Midget had gotten as far as the door. He obviously wanted to end the conversation and get out as fast as possible. Things were getting more unpleasant by the minute.,Miniman had now reached the door. He evidently wanted to give him short shrift and make a speedy getaway. The conversation was getting more and more unpleasant.
"Tusen takk. Så ser De vel inn til meg igjen, når De synes så; De vet veien. Godmorgen!","Thank you. Then you will probably look at me again, when you think so; They know the way. Good morning!",“Thanks a lot. Stop by when you feel like it. You know where I am. Goodby.”,“Many thanks. I hope you’ll drop by again when you feel like it. You know the way. Have a good day!”
"Ingensomhelst kvalm! ropte han, ingensomhelst! Vil De holde styr så får De gå ut på gaten, men herinne vil jeg ikke på noen måte vite av det. Jeg mener folk blir gale!","Disgusting at all! he shouted, by no means! If you want to keep track, you can go out on the street, but I do not want to know about it in any way. I mean people go crazy!","If you want to fight, go out into the street, but not in here! Everyone seems to have gone berserk!”","“No ruckus here!” he cried, “no ruckus! If you want to have a brawl, go out into the street, in here I just won’t have it. Have the people gone out of their minds?”"
"Nei, nei aldeles ikke.","No, no not at all.","“No, not at all.”","“No, not at all.”"
Minutten sier stadig intet.,The minute still says nothing.,The Midget still said nothing.,Miniman still says nothing.
"Nå, så fikk han ikke gå igjen.","Well, he could not go again.","Well then, he had to join them.","Well, then he mustn’t go away."
"Jeg husker det; jeg ble fratatt ordet, hehehe. Godt, men jeg underskriver dette også; hvorfor ikke? Det blir vel ikke verre enn det alt er. Men døm meg mildt!","I remember it; I was deprived of the word, hehehe. Good, but I sign this too; why not? It will probably not get worse than it all is. But judge me mildly!","“Now I remember: they put me out for that. But I’ll admit to that too, and why not? It can’t make things any worse. But do judge me compassionately!”","“I remember; I was denied the floor, heh-heh-heh. Good, I endorse that too, why not? It can’t get worse than it is already. But judge me leniently!”"
Øyeblikkelig. Gjør ikke De det?,Immediately. Do not you?,“The minute my head hits the pillow. And you?”,“Instantly. Don’t you?”
"Ut, ut! skriker fullmektigen påny, helt tilbunns! Så ja, det var riktig. Så, nu setter vi oss og gjør grimaser. Først kan De skjære litt tenner, siden klipper jeg skjegget av Dem og gjør Dem ti år yngre. Men først skjærer De altså tenner.","Out, out! shouts the clerk again, completely to the bottom! So yes, that was right. So, now we sit down and make faces. First you can cut some teeth, then I will cut your beard and make you ten years younger. But first you cut your teeth.","“Bottoms up!” shouted the deputy again. “All the way! That’s fine! Now we’ll sit down and make some funny faces. First you’ll gnash your teeth for a while, and then I’ll take your beard off and make you look ten years younger. But first you have to gnash your teeth!”","“To the last drop!” the deputy shouts again, “bottoms up! There now, that’s right. And now we’ll sit down and make some faces. First, you can grind your teeth a little, and then I’ll snip off your beard and make you ten years younger. But first you’ll grind your teeth, all right?”"
Nei hun var jo ikke atten engang efter hva innskriften viser. Det var et bra menneske det også?,"No, she was not even eighteen according to what the inscription shows. It was a good person too?","“She wasn’t even eighteen, according to the epitaph. But was she also a ‘good’ girl?”","“She wasn’t even eighteen, according to the inscription. And she, too, was a good person?”"
Hva bruker De da pengene til?,What do you use the money for then?,“What do you spend the money on?”,“And what do you use the money for?”
"Hehe, svarte jeg. Jeg som ikke engang kjenner en dikter og aldri har talt med en; jeg som er agronom og har levet med guano og klisørpe fra jeg var liten, jeg som ikke kunne dikte om en paraply engang, enn si om døden og livet og den evige fred!","Hehe, I replied. I who do not even know a poet and have never spoken to one; I who am an agronomist and have lived with guano and klisørpe since I was little, I who could not even compose about an umbrella, let alone about death and life and eternal peace!","If you can say something as challenging as the writer,” she says, “you are entitled to speak your piece.” “I who have never even known a poet or an author, and never even talked to one! I’m an agronomist; I’ve lived with guano and bran mash since childhood. I can’t even make up a rhyme about an umbrella, let alone death and life and eternal peace.”","“Heh-heh!” I replied. “I who don’t even know a poet and never spoke to one! I who am an agronomist and have lived among guano and bran mash since I was a child; I who couldn’t even write a poem about an umbrella, much less about life and death and universal peace!”"
"Nei jeg takker Dem, ikke nu.","No I thank you, not now.","“No, thank you. Not now.”","“No, but thank you, not now.”"
Jeg kan ikke begripe hvorfor De går her og vrenger Dem ut inn for meg! De lovet jo å være snill.,I can not understand why you go here and turn in for me! They promised to be kind.,"Beside herself with anger, she cried out: “I can’t understand why you keep turning yourself inside out for me. You did promise to behave.”","Exasperated, she exclaimed, “I cannot figure out why you’re turning yourself inside out for me. After all, you promised to be good.”"
Gjorde han det?,Did he do that?,“He did?”,“He did?”
"Ikke sant? Jeg sa også med én gang til meg selv: pass på, dette er en hvit drøm, et varsel. Det skal være deg en påminnelse: fisk med rene angler, med rene angler! De spurte, doktor, om jeg spiller? Jeg spiller ikke, slett ikke; jeg trekker en fiolinkasse med, men det er ikke engang en fiolin i den, kassen er full av skittentøy dessverre. Jeg synes bare det ville se så godt ut å ha en fiolinkasse med blant koffertene, det var derfor jeg anskaffet meg den. Jeg vet ikke om De efter dette får et altfor dårlig inntrykk av meg; men det får ikke hjelpe skjønt det virkelig gjør meg ondt. Det er forresten sølvangelen som er skyld i det hele.","Right? I also immediately said to myself: watch out, this is a white dream, a warning. It should be a reminder to you: fish with pure anglers, with pure anglers! They asked, Doctor, if I was playing? I do not play, not at all; I bring a violin case, but there is not even a violin in it, the case is full of dirty clothes unfortunately. I just think it would look so good to have a violin case with me among the suitcases, that's why I got it. I do not know if you will get a too bad impression of me after this; but it does not help though it really hurts me. By the way, it is the silver ginger that is to blame for it all.","And I said to myself: Heed it , it’s a white dream, a warning; a reminder to fish with clean hooks—clean hooks! You were asking, Doctor, if I played the violin. No, I don’t. I carry a violin case around with me, but there is no violin in it, only a lot of soiled linen, unfortunately. But I thought it would look good to have a violin case as part of my baggage; that’s why I got it. Perhaps you won’t think too highly of me for this, but it can’t be helped, though I’m sorry about it. It’s all because of the silver hook, you see.”","“Yes, isn’t it? I said to myself straightaway: watch out, this is a white dream, an omen. It’s meant to be a warning to you: fish with clean hooks, clean hooks! You asked me, Doctor, if I play the violin? No, I don’t, not in the least. I’m dragging a violin case around with me, but there’s no violin in it; the case is full of dirty laundry, I’m sorry to say. I just thought it would look good to have a violin case as part of my luggage, that’s why I got it. This may give you a very poor impression of me, I don’t know, but it can’t be helped, though I’m truly sorry about it. Anyway, the silver hook is to blame for it all.”"
"Hør, det falt meg inn: De må gi meg regning når De vil. Det er jo meg det samme når jeg betaler.","Listen, it occurred to me: You have to give me a bill whenever you want. It's the same to me when I pay.","He got up and walked away rather abruptly, but a moment later he came back and said: “By the way, it just occurred to me, you can give me the bill any time you like. It makes no difference to me when I pay.”","A moment later he came back and said, “Oh, about the bill, I just had an idea; you can give it to me whenever you like. It doesn’t matter to me when I pay up.”"
"Jeg har kjøpt den! ropte han og lo. Den er jo min, min eiendom, jeg besidder den som jeg besidder min pennekniv, min trøyeknapp. Hvorfor skulle jeg så kaste den vekk?","I bought it! he shouted, laughing. It is mine, my property, I possess it as I possess my penknife, my shirt button. So why should I throw it away?","“I bought it!” he exclaimed, laughing. “It belongs to me; it’s my property, as is this penknife, this button—why should I throw it away?”","“I bought it!” he cried, laughing. “It’s mine, my property, I own it, just as I own my penknife, my jacket button. So why should I throw it away?”"
"Tilgi at jeg for siste gang nevner Minutten for Dem. Ja ta det med ro, jeg har mine grunner til å tale som jeg gjør. Jeg vil intet galt si om det menneske, tvertimot, De vil selv huske at jeg endog har sagt det beste jeg visste om ham opp i Deres egne ører. Jeg tenkte meg muligheten av at han kunne stå meg iveien hos Dem, jeg talte derfor til Dem om ham, jeg påstod blant annet at han kunne forsørge en familie like så godt som noen annen, og det tror jeg ennu at han kan når han blir hjulpet på vei i begynnelsen. Men De ville slett ikke høre på det, De hadde intet med Minutten å gjøre, De bad meg endog ikke å tale mere om ham. Godt! Men jeg er ennu ikke helt fri for mistanke, De har ikke overbevist meg, og jeg spør Dem igjen om det ikke er noe igjære mellom Dem og Minutten? Isåfall trekker jeg meg straks tilbake. Ja De ryster på hodet; men jeg forstår ellers ikke at De kan vegre Dem for å overveie saken til imorgen og gi meg beskjed da. Det er bare simpel rettferdighet. Og De som er så god!","Forgive me for mentioning the Minute for you for the last time. Yes, take it easy, I have my reasons for speaking as I do. I do not want to say anything wrong about that man, on the contrary, you will remember for yourself that I have even said the best I knew about him in your own ears. I imagined the possibility that he could stand in my way with you, I therefore spoke to you about him, I claimed, among other things, that he could support a family as well as anyone else, and I still think he can when he becomes helped on the way in the beginning. But you did not want to listen to it at all, you had nothing to do with the minute, you did not even ask me to talk more about him. Well! But I'm not yet completely free from suspicion, you have not convinced me, and I ask you again if there is no yeast between you and the Minute? In that case, I withdraw immediately. Yes You shake your head; but otherwise I do not understand that you can refuse to consider the matter until tomorrow and let me know then. It's just simple justice. And Those who are so good!","“Forgive me for mentioning The Midget once more. Now don’t get upset, but I have my reasons. I’m not going to say anything to discredit him; on the contrary. You remember how I spoke of his good qualities to you. I thought that he might possibly be a rival, and that’s why I brought him up. I even said I thought him capable of supporting a family if he had some help in getting started. But you vehemently denied it; you swore you had nothing to do with him, you even stopped me from talking about him. But I’m not entirely convinced that what you said is the truth; you haven’t allayed my suspicions, and I’m asking you again if there isn’t something between the two of you. If there is, I’ll immediately back out. You shake your head. But then I can’t understand why you refuse to think things over until tomorrow and give me your answer then. That would only be fair, after all. And you who are kindness personified!”","“Forgive me for bringing up Miniman again, it’ll be the last time,” he said. “Now, take it easy, I have good reasons for saying this. I’m not going to badmouth the man; on the contrary, you will recall I spoke to you about him in the most favorable way. I thought he might possibly stand in my way with you, and so I spoke to you about him; I maintained, among other things, that he could support a family like anyone else, and I still believe he can, if he gets some help to start with. But you flatly refused to listen, you had nothing to do with Miniman! You even begged me never to mention him again. Fine! But I’m still a bit suspicious, you haven’t convinced me, and I ask you again if there’s something going on between you and Miniman. If so, I withdraw at once. Ah, you shake your head; but then I don’t understand why you refuse to think the matter over till tomorrow and let me know then. That’s only fair. And you who are so kind!”"
Men adjunkten som ennu satt sammen med fullmektigen og ikke hadde vært oppe fra stolen i over en time begynte å bli temmelig beruset.,"But the assistant professor, who was still sitting with the clerk and had not been up from the chair for over an hour, began to get quite drunk.","Holtan, however, was still sitting at the table with Reinert. He hadn’t moved from his chair for over an hour and was in fact quite drunk.","But the teacher, who was still sitting with Mr. Reinert and hadn’t left his chair for over an hour, was getting rather intoxicated."
"Doktoren kunne gjerne ha satt tennene i Dagny da hun sa dette. Han rettet seg opp. Mannen ble frisk; ja men hva så? Det utelukket ikke at dumheten altså var himmelropende ute hos almuen. Mannen ble frisk, ja det ble han; men hva om mannen hadde svidd flabben av seg? Var det meningen å forsvare hans stutestupiditet?","The doctor could have put Dagny's teeth in when she said this. He straightened up. The man recovered; yes but so what? It did not rule out that stupidity was outrageous among the common people. The man recovered, yes he did; but what if the man had burned the flab off? Was it meant to defend his stud stupidity?","This remark of Dagny’s made him want to sink his teeth into her; he stiffened. The man got well, yes, but what did that prove? The ignorance of most people is enough to make one’s hair stand on end. The man got well, that’s right; but what if he had burned off his face? Was she really defending such abysmal ignorance?","The doctor could have dug his teeth into Dagny when she said this. He straightened up. The man got well, sure, and so what? That didn’t preclude the existence of scandalous stupidity out there among the common people. The man got well, all right; but what if he had burned up his chops? Did she mean to defend his bovine stupidity?"
"Da begynte følgende passiar imellom dem, en passiar som varte hele skogen igjennom, så sent de enn gikk, og som sprang fra det ene til det andre, fra stemning til stemning, med all den bevegede uro som var over dem begge:","Then began the following passiar between them, a passiar which lasted through the whole forest, as late as they went, and which ran from one to the other, from mood to mood, with all the moving turmoil that was over them both:","They began talking, and they talked during the entire walk through the woods, touching on one topic after another, going from one mood to another, both filled with the same agitation and restlessness.","Then the following conversation started up between them, a conversation that, no matter how slowly they walked, went on until they were at the other end of the forest, jumping from one thing to another, from mood to mood, with all the emotional restlessness they were both feeling."
"Nei det er løytnant Hansen. Han er ikke her, han er på tokt; det er flere dager siden han reiste; han reiste straks efter forlovelsen.","No, it's Lieutenant Hansen. He is not here, he is on a voyage; it has been several days since he left; he left immediately after the engagement.","“No, Lieutenant Hansen isn’t here; he’s on maneuvers. He left a few days ago, right after the engagement.”","“Lieutenant Hansen, no. He’s not here, he’s cruising; he left several days ago. He left right after the engagement.”"
"Hvor dette ærend var løpt uheldig av! Det hadde vært langt bedre intet å ha forsøkt. Nagel begav seg hjem, spiste frokost, leste aviser og lekte med hvalpen Jakobsen.","Where this errand had run unlucky from! There would have been far better nothing to have tried. Nagel went home, ate breakfast, read newspapers and played with the puppy Jakobsen.","This had really gone badly. It would have been much wiser to stay out of the whole thing. Nagel went home, had lunch, read the papers, and played with the puppy, Jacobsen.","How badly this business had turned out! It would have been much better if he had left things as they were. Nagel went back to the hotel, had breakfast, read the papers and played with Jakobsen, the puppy."
Ennu en gang følte hun efter pengene. En halvtimes tid bakefter hørte Nagel virkelig også en dampfløyte som pep fem korte ganger i trekk.,"Once again, she felt for the money. Half an hour later, Nagel really also heard a steam whistle beeping five short times in a row.",Again she made a quick movement to make sure the money was safely tucked away. A half hour later Nagel heard the steamboat whistle sound five blasts.,"Once more she checked on the money. Half an hour later Nagel did, in fact, hear a steam whistle blow five brief blasts."
"Ti minutter gikk. Legg merke til: jeg ligger klar våken på en seng og røker en cigar. Med én gang fylles hvelvingen av en susen som om ventiler åpnes allevegne oppe i taket. Jeg reiser meg på albuen og lar min cigar gå ut, stirrer omkring meg i mørket og kan intet oppdage. Jeg legger meg ned igjen og lytter og jeg synes å høre fjerne lyder, et vidunderlig tusenstemmig spill et sted utenom meg, dypt oppe under himmelen kanskje, men tusenstemmig og sakte. Dette spill lyder idelig og kommer nærmere og nærmere og tilsist bølger det ovenover meg, over tårnets tak. Jeg legger meg atter på albuen. Nu opplever jeg noe som ennu den dag idag beruser meg med en selsom, overnaturlig nytelse når jeg tenker på det: En strøm av bitte små blendende vesener bryter plutselig ned til meg; de er aldeles hvite, det er engler, myriader av småengler, som strømmer ned fra oven som en skrå mur av lys. De fyller hvelvingen, det er kanskje en million av dem, de driver om i bølger fra gulv til tak og de synger, de synger, og de er aldeles nakne og hvite. Mitt hjerte blir stille, det er engler overalt, jeg lytter og hører deres sang, de streifer mine øyenlokk og setter seg i mitt hår og hele hvelvingen fylles av duften fra deres små gapende munner.","Ten minutes passed. Note: I'm lying awake on a bed smoking a cigar. At once the vault is filled with a hiss as if valves are being opened everywhere up in the ceiling. I get up on my elbow and let my cigar go out, staring around me in the dark and can not detect anything. I lie down again and listen and I seem to hear distant sounds, a wonderful thousand-voice game somewhere outside me, deep in the sky perhaps, but a thousand-voice and slow. This game sounds idle and gets closer and closer and finally it waves over me, over the roof of the tower. I lay down on my elbow again. Now I experience something that still to this day intoxicates me with a strange, supernatural pleasure when I think about it: A stream of tiny little dazzling creatures suddenly breaks down to me; they are completely white, there are angels, myriads of little angels, flowing down from above like a sloping wall of light. They fill the vault, there are maybe a million of them, they drift in waves from floor to ceiling and they sing, they sing, and they are completely naked and white. My heart is silent, there are angels everywhere, I listen and hear their song, they stroke my eyelids and sit in my hair and the whole vault is filled with the scent of their little gaping mouths.","“About ten minutes passed. Now this is important: I was lying wide awake in bed smoking a cigar. All of a sudden I heard a murmur that came from the vaulted ceiling; it was as though the roof had been lifted. I leaned on my elbow, let my cigar go out, and stared into the darkness, but saw nothing. Again I lay down and listened, and this time I heard sounds that seemed to come from a distance; marvelous music—a choir of a thousand voices, somewhere outside me, perhaps from the sky, singing softly. The music kept coming closer and closer, until finally it was just above me, over the tower. Again I raised myself on my elbow, and I experienced something which fills me with supernatural rapture whenever I think of it: a myriad of tiny, luminous figures, dazzlingly white, appeared. Angels in countless numbers seemed to be descending on a diagonal beam of light. There were perhaps a million of them, floating about in waves from floor to roof as they sang, naked and white. I held my breath and listened. They brushed my eyelids, touched my hair, and the whole vault seemed to be filled with the fragrant breath from their tiny open mouths.","“Ten minutes went by. Keep in mind: I’m lying wide awake in bed smoking a cigar. All at once the vault is filled with a soughing noise, as though vents were opened all over the ceiling. Getting up on my elbow to put out my cigar, I stare about me in the darkness without discovering anything. I lie down again and listen; I seem to hear some sounds far away, a marvelous thousand-voiced music from somewhere outside me, from way up under the sky perhaps, thousand-voiced and soft. The music goes on and on, coming closer and closer until at last it surges above me, over the roof of the tower. Again I get up on my elbow. Then I experience something that even today intoxicates me with a mysterious, supernatural pleasure whenever I think of it: a stream of tiny little dazzling creatures suddenly descends upon me; they are perfectly white, angels, myriads of little angels streaming down from on high like an oblique wall of light. They fill the vault, there may be as many as a million; they float about the room in a wave-like motion, from floor to ceiling, and they sing, they sing, and they are perfectly naked and white. My heart stands still, there are angels everywhere, I listen and hear their song; they brush my eyelids and settle in my hair, and the entire vault is filled with the fragrance from their small open mouths."
"De var kommet inn i skogen, de gikk hverandre så nær at de ofte streifet hverandre med ermene, og været var så stille at de kun behøvet å tale ganske sakte. Nu og da kvitret en fugl.","They had entered the forest, they went so close to each other that they often stroked each other with their sleeves, and the weather was so quiet that they only needed to speak quite slowly. Every now and then a bird chirped.",They were now in the woods and were walking so close to each other that their arms often touched; there was no wind and they spoke softly. The only sound was the occasional chirping of a bird.,"By now they had entered the forest. They were walking so close to each other that their sleeves often touched, and the air was so calm that they could speak quite softly and still be heard. Now and then a bird twittered."
De gikk i to minutter uten å si noe. Hun var rørt og angret bitterlig sine hårde ord. Kanskje hadde han attpå kjøpet rett i det han sa; hva visste hun? Gud vet om ikke dette menneske hadde sett mere i uker enn hun i år.,They walked for two minutes without saying anything. She was touched and bitterly regretted her harsh words. Maybe he was right in what he said; what did she know? God knows if this man had not seen more in weeks than she this year.,"They walked on for a few minutes, neither of them saying anything. Again she was filled with compassion and regretted her outburst. Perhaps what he said was true—how was she to know? Wasn’t it possible that this man had seen as much in a few weeks as she had in as many years?","They walked for a couple of minutes without speaking. Touched, she bitterly regretted her harsh words. Maybe he was even right in what he said, what did she know? She couldn’t help wondering whether this person hadn’t seen more in a few weeks than she had in years."
"Hvor det var underlig! Men senere engang så hendte også noe. Jeg var kommet tilbake til Europa, jeg var hjemme. Jeg drev en varm natt omkring, kom ned til havnen, til pumpeverkene, hvor jeg oppholdt meg en tidlang og lyttet til det man satt og talte om på skipene. Alt var så stille, pumpene stod. Tilsist ble jeg trett og jeg ville dog ikke hjem fordi det var så varmt. Jeg steg opp i stokkverket på en av pumpene og satte meg der.

I drove around on a warm night, came down to the harbor, to the pumping stations, where I stayed for a while and listened to what people were talking about on the ships.

"Denne lille hendelse bragte ham straks i uro. Hva søkte hun efter og hva hadde hun å bestille med hans frakk? Han tenkte over det hele tiden og kunne ikke glemme det. Gud vet, kanskje hadde hun villet undersøke om han hadde skytevåpen i lommene; hun trodde ham kanskje gal nok til hva det skulle være. Men sett at hun hadde stukket et brev til ham? Han bragte det virkelig også til å tenke seg denne glade umulighet. Nei, nei, hun hadde nok bare lett efter sin kåpe, det var en tilfeldighet det hele; hvorledes kunne han nære så håpløse innbilninger! …. Litt senere da han så Dagny bane seg vei inn gjennom salen gikk han imidlertid straks ut og ransaket sine frakkelommer med bankende hjerte.

"Jo, jo! avbrøt han overordentlig beveget. Jeg vet også hva De ville si: at De er en annens for lenge siden og at jeg altså er en uhederlig person som trenger meg inn nu bakefter når det er forsent – hvorfor skulle jeg ikke vite det? Ja hvorfor har jeg så sagt Dem alt dette? Nuvel, for å påvirke Dem, for å gjøre inntrykk på Dem og få Dem til å tenke over det. Ved Gud, jeg taler sannhet nu, jeg kan ikke annet. Jeg vet at De er forlovet, at De har en kjæreste som De er glad i, og at jeg altså ingenvegne kan komme; ja, men allikevel ville jeg prøve å påvirke Dem litt, jeg ville ikke oppgi alt håp. Tenk Dem den tanke: å oppgi alt håp, så vil De kanskje forstå meg bedre. Når jeg før sa at jeg intet ventet å oppnå så løy jeg jo. Jeg sa det også bare for å berolige Dem foreløpig og vinne tid så De ikke skulle bli altfor angst med én gang. Kjære, snakker jeg galt? Jeg mener ikke å si at De noensinne har latt meg håpe noe og jeg har virkelig heller ikke innbilt meg at jeg kunne stikke noen ut. Akk, det har aldri falt meg inn engang. Men jeg har i trøstesløse timer tenkt ved meg selv: ja, hun er forlovet og hun reiser snart, farvel; men hun er jo ikke absolutt tapt ennu, hun er ikke allerede reist, ikke gift, ikke død; hvo vet! Og når jeg forsøkte alt så kanskje var det ennu tid! De er blitt min stadige tanke, min tvangstanke, jeg går og ser Dem i alle ting og jeg kaller alle blå elver Dagny. Jeg tror ikke det har gått en eneste dag i disse uker uten at jeg har tenkt på Dem. Det kan være ganske det samme hva tid på døgnet jeg går ut av hotellet, såsnart jeg åpner døren og stiger ut på trappen farer det håp igjennom mitt hjerte: kanskje møter du henne nu! Og jeg ser meg om efter Dem allevegne. Nei jeg forstår det ikke nu, jeg har ingen råd med det. Tro meg, har jeg nu overgitt meg så har jeg allikevel ikke overgitt meg uten motstand. Det er jo dog ikke oppmuntrende å vite med seg selv at ens anstrengelser er sørgelig spilt og man allikevel ikke kan la være å anstrenge seg; derfor stritter man også imot til det siste. Men når det absolutt ikke hjelper! Så mange, mange ting man kan uttenke når man sitter ved vinduet i sitt værelse en natt igjennom og ikke får sove. Man holder en bok i hånden, men man leser ikke; man biter atter og atter tennene sammen og leser tre linjer, så kan man ikke mere, og man lukker boken igjen med en hoderysten. Hjertet slår vilt, man hvisker stumt hemmelige, søte ord frem for seg, kaller på et navn og kysser det i sin tanke. Og klokken blir to, fire, seks; så vil man ha en ende på det og man beslutter seg til at neste gang man får en leilighet til det våger man spranget og tilstår det hele …. Hvis jeg torde be Dem om noe nu så ville jeg be Dem om å tie stille. Jeg elsker Dem, men ti stille, ti stille. Vent i tre minutter.","Yes, yes! he interrupted exceedingly. I also know what you would say: that you are someone else's long ago and that I am a dishonest person who needs me now afterwards when it's too late - why should I not know? So why did I tell you all this? Well, to influence you, to impress you and make you think about it. By God, I speak the truth now, I can do nothing else. I know that you are engaged, that you have a boyfriend that you love, and that I can get nowhere; yes, but still I would try to influence you a little, I would not give up all hope. Imagine that thought: to give up all hope, you might understand me better. When I said before that I did not expect to achieve anything, I lied. I also said it just to reassure you for the time being and gain time so you do not become too anxious right away. Dear, am I talking wrong? I do not mean to say that you have ever made me hope for anything and I have not really imagined that I could stick anyone out. Alas, it never occurred to me once. But in inconsolable hours I have thought to myself: yes, she is engaged and she will leave soon, goodbye; but she is not absolutely lost yet, she is not already raised, not married, not dead; who knows! And when I tried everything then maybe it was still time! You have become my constant thought, my obsession, I go and see you in all things and I call all blue rivers Dagny. I do not think a single day has gone by these weeks without me thinking about you. It can be quite the same what time of day I leave the hotel, as soon as I open the door and go up the stairs, hope passes through my heart: maybe you will meet her now! And I look after you everywhere. No I do not understand it now, I can not afford it. Believe me, if I have now surrendered, I still have not surrendered without resistance. However, it is not encouraging to know with yourself that one's efforts have been played out sadly and one can still not fail to make an effort; therefore one also resists to the last. But when it certainly does not help! So many, many things to think about when you sit by the window in your room all night and can not sleep. You hold a book in your hand, but you do not read; you bite your teeth together again and again and read three lines, then you can no longer, and you close the book again with a shake of the head. The heart beats wildly, you whisper dumb secret, sweet words in front of you, call on a name and kiss it in your mind. And it is two, four, six; then you want an end to it and you decide that the next time you get an apartment for it you dare the leap and confess it all…. If I dared to ask you anything now, I would ask you to keep quiet. I love you, but ten silent, ten silent. Wait for three minutes.","“Yes, yes!” he broke in violently. “You were going to say that you promised to marry someone else a long time ago, and that I am a scoundrel to try to force myself on you, now when it’s too late. Of course I know that! Well, why have I told you this? To try to sway you, to impress you, to make you think about it. As God is my witness, I’m speaking from the heart; there is nothing else I can do. I know that you are engaged, that you are in love with your fiancé, and that I don’t have a chance. But still I had to plead my cause; I just refuse to give up hope. Perhaps if you realize what it means to give up all hope, you’ll understand how I feel. When I said just now that I expected nothing, I was lying. I only said it to put your mind at ease, so that you wouldn’t panic, to gain time for myself. I seem to be making things worse, don’t I? You’ve never given me any encouragement, nor did I even for a moment think that I could take someone else’s place in your heart. But during these hours of anguish I’ve been thinking: ‘She’s engaged and she’ll soon be gone, farewell; but all is not yet lost. She’s still here, she isn’t married, she isn’t dead, so who knows? If I did my utmost, perhaps there’s still time! You’re an obsession with me; you’re never out of my mind. I see you everywhere, and every blue stream I pass I call Dagny. I don’t think there has been a single day during these past few weeks that I haven’t thought of you. No matter what time I leave the hotel, as soon as I open the door and walk down the steps I’m filled with hope and elation: ‘Maybe you’ll run into her!’ And I look for you everywhere. I don’t understand it; I’m powerless. Believe me, I’ve struggled hard to keep this to myself. It’s terribly frustrating to know that no word of mine can make the slightest impression on you, but even knowing this, I’m unable to give up; I shall hang on to the end. I know it’s hopeless. Still, so many things race through my mind when I spend a sleepless night sitting by the window in my room! I have a book in front of me, but I can’t read. I grit my teeth and read three lines, but I can’t go on, and I put the book down. My heart is pounding, and I whisper tender, secret words, evoke a name, and caress it with my thoughts. The clock strikes: two, four, six. I decide to put an end to the agony and at the next opportunity confess all. If I dared ask anything of you now, it would be not to say anything. I love you, but don’t say anything. Wait three minutes before you speak.”","“Oh sure, sure!” he cut in, exceedingly agitated. “I know what you were going to say: that you have belonged to someone else for a long time and that it’s dishonorable of me to try to force myself on you now, afterward, when it’s too late—how could I not know that? Why, then, have I told you all this? Well, to influence you, make an impression on you, get you to think it over. As God is my witness, I’m speaking the truth, I can do nothing else. I know you are engaged to be married, that you are in love with your young man, and that I cannot get anywhere with you. Still, I decided to try to influence you a little, I refused to give up hope. If you can imagine what it means to give up all hope, then perhaps you’ll understand me better. When I said just now that I didn’t expect to get anywhere, I was lying, of course. I only said it to set your mind at rest for the moment and to gain time, so you wouldn’t become all too alarmed at once. Oh dear, did I say something wrong? I didn’t mean to say that you ever gave me any hope, nor have I ever imagined I could cut anyone out. That never even occurred to me, alas. But in certain moments, when everything seemed hopeless, I have thought to myself : All right, she’s engaged and she’ll soon be leaving, goodbye; but she’s not utterly lost to me yet, she has not already left, she’s not married, or dead, so who knows? And if I gave it my all, perhaps there would still be time! You’ve become my constant thought, my obsession, I see you in everything and call every blue stream Dagny. I don’t believe a single day has gone by during these past few weeks without my thinking about you. No matter at what hour I leave the hotel, as soon as I open the door and find myself on the steps, the hope shoots through my heart: maybe you’ll meet her this time! And I look for you everywhere. It’s quite beyond me, I just can’t help it. If I have now surrendered, I certainly didn’t surrender without a fight, believe me. It’s not a happy thought to know in your heart that your efforts have been sadly wasted and yet to be unable to refrain from making an effort; that’s why one resists to the very end. But what if it doesn’t do any good? When you spend a sleepless night sitting by the window in your room, you dream up all sorts of things! You have a book in your hand, but you don’t read; you clench your teeth again and again and read three lines, then you can’t anymore and close the book, shaking your head. Your heart is beating wildly, you softly whisper some sweet, secret words to yourself, calling a name and kissing it in your thoughts. The clock strikes two, four, six; then you decide to make an end of it and to seize the first chance you have to take the plunge and confess all.... 6 If I might ask anything of you now, it would be not to talk. I love you, but don’t talk, don’t talk. Wait three minutes.”"

"Da han nesten var ferdig til å gå ned stakk Sara et brev inn gjennom døren til ham; det hadde ikke vært i posten, det var kommet ved bud.

"Nagel begynte å gå innover mot byen. Han var noenlunde uthvilt og tenkte bittert og klart over tingene. Nattens hendelse hadde ydmyket ham og gjort ham latterlig i hans egne øyne. Tenk, han hadde endog luktet mandler av dette vann, følt sin tunge snøret sammen av dette vann, hatt en fornemmelse av døden i seg ved dette vann! Og han hadde rast og gjort himmelhopp over stokk og sten for denne munnfull ganske almindelig dåps- og brønnvann! Sint og skamrød stanset han og skrek rett ut i været; men litt efter så han seg om, redd for at noen kunne ha hørt det, og slo over i å synge for å skjule det.","Nagel began to walk inward toward the city.

Angry and ashamed, he stopped and screamed straight into the air; but a little later he looked around, afraid that someone might have heard it, and turned to singing to hide it.","Nagel began walking toward town. He was more or less rested and his thinking was clear, but his thoughts were bitter beyond words. The experience he had just gone through made him feel humiliated, and utterly foolish.

And because he had swallowed a few drops of innocuous, baptismal spring water, he had hurtled over stumps and stones! Furious and flushed with shame, he stopped and screamed at the top of his lungs. He caught himself, looked around quickly, and afraid that someone might have heard him, began singing, to cover up the outcry.","Nagel began walking toward town.

To think that he had actually scented almonds in this water, felt his tongue shrivel up from it, and sensed death inside him because of it! And this mouthful of perfectly ordinary christening water from the well had made him rave and jump sky-high over stock and stone! Angry and blushing with shame, he stopped and let out a wild scream; but the next moment he looked about him, afraid someone might have heard him, and broke into a song to cover it up."
"Nagel sa dette på en ganske oppriktig måte og rystet Minuttens hånd. Han fulgte sin gjest ned og gikk med ham til ytterdøren, her tok han sin fløyels lue helt av likesom engang før og hilste dypt.","Nagel said this in a rather sincere way and shook the Minute's hand. He followed his guest down and went with him to the front door, here he took off his velvet hat completely as once before and greeted deeply.","Nagel’s words had an air of sincerity as he shook The Midget’s hand. He escorted his guest down the stairs and to the front door, and bowed deeply, doffing his corduroy cap as he had done once before.","Nagel said this quite sincerely as he shook Miniman’s hand. He saw his visitor downstairs and walked him to the front door, where he bowed deeply, doffing his velvet cap as once before."
"Jeg er stundom litt slem til å motsi, fortsatte Nagel, og iaften er jeg særlig oppsatt derpå. Det kommer dels av et par ubehagelige opplevelser som rammet meg litt hårdt iforgårs, dels av dette triste vær som jeg slett ikke kan utstå. Hr. doktor, det forstår nok De Dem på og unnskylder meg …. For å tale om Tolstoj: jeg er ikke istand til å finne hans ånd dypere enn for eksempel general Booths. Disse to er begge forkynnere, ikke tenkere, men forkynnere. De omsetter eksisterende produkter, populariserer en tanke som de forefinner ferdig, folkepopulariserer den til godtkjøp og holder styr med verden. Men når man skal omsette så gjelder det å omsette med profitt. Tolstoj omsetter med svimlende tap. Det var to venner som inngikk et veddemål engang: den ene satte tolv skilling på at han i tyve skritts avstand skulle skyte en nøtt ut av den andres hånd uten å beskadige hånden. Godt, han skjøt, skjøt skitt, skjøt hele hånden i filler, og det med glans. Da stønnet den andre og ropte med sin siste kraft: du tapte veddemålet, hit med tolvskillingen! Og så fikk han tolvskillingen. Hehe, hit med tolvskillingen, sa han! …. Gud hjelpe meg hvor Tolstoj sliter med å uttørke og uttørke menneskenes glade ulivskilder og gjøre verden meget tykk av kjærlighet til Gud og hvermann. Jeg blir skamfull innvortes. Det lyder nesevist å si at en greve gjør en agronom dypt skamfull; men det gjør han …. Jeg skulle aldri snakke om det hvis Tolstoj var en yngling som hadde fristelser å overvinne, en kamp å bestå, for å preke dyd og leve rent. Men mannen er jo en olding, uttørket i sine kilder, uten spor av menneskelige tilbøyeligheter mere. Men – kan man si – dette rammer ikke hans lære? Jo det rammer også hans lære! Først når man er blitt seig og vanntett av alderdom og mett og forherdet av nytelse går man til det unge menneske og sier: Forsak! Og det unge menneske smatter på det og tenker over det og erkjenner at det er riktig efter Skriften. Og det unge menneske forsaker allikevel ikke, men synder keiserlig i førti år. Så er naturens gang! Men når førti år er omme og den unge mann selv er blitt olding, da sadler også han sin hvite, hvite merr og rir avsted med korsfanen høyt i sin benete hånd og trompetstøter til verdens andakt ynglingens forsakelse og ynglingens forsakelse. Hehehehe, jo det er en alltid tilbakevendende komedie! Tolstoj morer mitt hode, jeg er henrykt over at den gamle mann ennu kan gjøre så meget godt; tilslutt går han nok inn til sin Herres glede! Men så er det jo det at han blott og bart gjentar hva så mangen olding før ham har gjort og så mangen olding efter ham vil gjøre. Det er bare det.","I'm sometimes a little naughty to contradict, Nagel continued, and tonight I'm particularly keen on that. It comes partly from a couple of unpleasant experiences that hit me a little hard the day before yesterday, partly from this sad weather that I can not stand at all. Mr Doctor, you probably understand that and apologize to me…. To speak of Tolstoy: I am not able to find his spirit deeper than, for example, General Booths. These two are both preachers, not thinkers, but preachers. They sell existing products, popularize an idea that they already have, popularize it for bargains and keep track of the world. But when it comes to turnover, it is important to trade at a profit. Tolstoj sells at a staggering loss. There were two friends who once made a bet: one put twelve shillings on him to shoot a nut out of the other's hand at a distance of twenty steps without damaging the hand. Well, he shot, shot dirt, shot his whole hand to shreds, and that with brilliance. Then the other moaned and shouted with his last strength: you lost the bet, hit with the twelve shillings! And then he got the twelve shillings. Hehe, here with the twelve shillings, he said! …. God help me where Tolstoy struggles to dehydrate and dehydrate people's happy sources of life and make the world very thick with love for God and everyone. I'm ashamed inside. It sounds nosy to say that a count makes an agronomist deeply ashamed; but he does…. I would never talk about it if Tolstoy was a young man who had temptations to overcome, a struggle to survive, to preach virtue and live clean. But the man is an old man, dried up in his springs, without a trace of human inclinations anymore. But - can one say - this does not affect his teachings? Yes, it also affects his teachings! Only when one has become tenacious and waterproof from old age and full and hardened by pleasure do one go to the young man and say: Forsak! And the young man snaps at it and thinks about it and acknowledges that it is right according to Scripture. And yet the young man does not forsake, but sins imperially for forty years. Then nature's walk! But when forty years are over and the young man himself has grown old, then he too saddles his white, white mare and rides away with the cross flag high in his bony hand and trumpet blows to the devotion of the world the youth's renunciation and the youth's renunciation. Hehehehe, yes it's an ever recurring comedy! Tolstoy amuses my head, I'm delighted that the old man can still do so much good; in the end he goes probably to the delight of his Lord! But then there is the fact that he merely repeats what so many old people before him have done and so many old people after him will do. That's just it.","“I’m sometimes a bit argumentative,” Nagel said, by way of reply, “and tonight I’m in the mood. It may be because of a few setbacks I had the day before yesterday, and also because of the weather, which depresses me no end. I’m sure you understand, Dr. Stenersen, and you will forgive me. To get back to Tolstoy, in my opinion his intellect is no greater than, say, General Booth’s. They are both preachers, not thinkers but preachers. They deal with the status quo, popularize already accepted ideas, reduce them to the lowest common denominator, and then sit back and watch them take root. But if you’re going to sell, you must do so at a profit, and Tolstoy’s enterprises show a staggering loss. Once two friends made a wager; one bet the other twelve shillings that he could shoot a nut out of the other fellow’s hand at a distance of twenty paces without grazing it. Well, he fired, missed, and blew the whole hand to shreds, but he did it with style. As he was about to faint, his injured friend moaned: ‘You lost the bet—give me the twelve shillings. Give me twelve shillings,’ he said! God, how Tolstoy labors to eliminate humanity’s happy vices and make the world full of love of God and mankind! It just fills me with shame. Maybe it sounds impertinent to say that an agronomist is ashamed of a count, but that happens to be the case. It would be different if Tolstoy were a young man struggling against temptation or if he had a battle to fight and tried to win it by preaching virtue and clean living. But his sources have run dry; he has no more humanity left to struggle with. You may say: But this has nothing to do with his philosophy. But it has everything to do with it! Oh, just wait until old age has made you self-satisfied and callous! Then you go to the young man and say: ‘Renounce all these superficial trappings.’ The young man ponders, sleeps on it, and comes to the conclusion that this indeed is what the Bible preaches. But he doesn’t ‘renounce’; he goes on sinning happily for the next forty years. And so it is. When the forty years are up and the young man has grown old, he saddles his snow-white mare and rides off with his crusader’s banner held high in his bony hand, calling out a pious message of renunciation to the youth of the world. It’s a comedy that endlessly repeats itself. I get a kick out of Tolstoy. I’m glad the old boy is still capable of so much munificence. He will surely be rewarded by going to his Maker in the end! But, after all, he is only doing what so many old men have done before him, what many others will continue to do after he is gone. It’s as simple as that.”","“Occasionally I have an inclination to contradict,” Nagel continued, “and this evening I’m particularly bent on doing so. It’s partly due to a couple of unpleasant experiences that hit me rather hard the day before yesterday, partly to this dismal weather which I simply cannot stand. You, Dr. Stenersen, surely know something about that and will pardon me.6 ... To speak about Tolstoy: I do not find his mind to be any deeper than, say, that of General Booth. They are both preachers, not thinkers but preachers. They sell existing products, popularize ready-made ideas, vulgarizing them for the masses at bargain prices and causing commotion in the world. But if you’re going to sell, you must do so at a profit. Tolstoy sells with staggering losses. Two friends once made a bet: one of them staked a shilling he would shoot a nut out of the other’s hand at twenty paces without hurting the hand. All right, he fired, missed badly, blew his whole hand to bits, and with flying colors. The other groaned and cried with his last strength, ‘You lost the bet, hand over the shilling!’ He got the money. Heh-heh, hand over the shilling, he said! ... God help me, how Tolstoy sweats over drying up people’s sources of life, of wild and joyful life, drying them up and making the world fat with love of God and everyman. It fills my heart with shame.7 It may sound impertinent to say that a count makes an agronomist feel deeply ashamed, but he does.... I would never have mentioned it if Tolstoy were a youth who had to overcome temptation, put up a fight, in order to preach virtue and live immaculately. But the man is old, after all, his fountains of life run dry, without a trace remaining of human affections. Well—you might say—that has no bearing on his teaching! Oh yes, it does have a bearing on his teaching! Only someone who has become slow and watertight with old age, satiated and hardened with pleasure, will go to a youth and say, Renounce! And the youth gives it a try; thinking it over, he recognizes it’s correct according to Scripture. And yet the youth renounces nothing, but sins royally for forty years. Such is the course of nature! But when the forty years are up and the young man has himself become old, he saddles his lily-white filly and rides off, holding the banner of the cross high in his bony hand and trumpeting youthful renunciation ad nauseam, while the world listens with grave attention. Heh-heh-heh-heh, it’s an ever-recurring comedy! I find Tolstoy amusing, I’m delighted that the old man can still do so much good; he will eventually enter into the joy of the Lord! The only trouble is that he’s merely repeating what so many old men have done before him and so many old men will do after him.8 Yes, that’s the trouble.”"
"Det er sant, frøken: vil De være så vennlig …. jeg ser Dem vel ikke mere …. vil De være så vennlig engang ved leilighet når De skriver til Deres forlovede å minne ham om to skjorter som han har lovet Minutten engang, for to år siden. Jeg ber Dem tilgi at jeg blander meg i dette som jo ikke vedkommer meg, jeg gjør det også bare for Minuttens skyld. Jeg håper De unnskylder min dristighet. Si at det er to ullskjorter, så husker han det nok.","It's true, miss: will you be so kind…. I guess I do not see you anymore…. will you be so kind even at the apartment when you write to your fiancé to remind him of two shirts that he promised Minutes once, two years ago. I beg your pardon that I interfere in this which does not concern me, I also do it just for the sake of the Minute. I hope you apologize for my boldness. Say there are two wool shirts, then he will probably remember.","Miss Kielland, I don’t suppose I’ll see you again, but when you write to your fiancé, would you remind him of the shirts he promised The Midget once, a couple of years ago? Please forgive me for meddling in something that doesn’t concern me; I’m only doing it for The Midget’s sake. Do excuse my presumptuousness, but tell him that it was two wool shirts","Suddenly this man, whom she had just thought annihilated, crushed by her mockery, says quite politely and nonchalantly, “By the way, Miss Kielland, will you be so kind —I don’t suppose I’ll see you again —will you be so kind when you write your fiancé to remind him sometime, at your own convenience, of a pair of shirts he promised Miniman once, two years ago now. I apologize for poking my nose into this, which after all doesn’t concern me, I’m only doing it for Miniman’s sake. I hope you will excuse my boldness. Tell him it was two woolen shirts, then he’ll be sure to remember.”"
"Tidlig den neste morgning møtte Minutten atter opp i hotellet. Han gikk stille inn i Nagels værelse, la hans ur, noen papirer, en stump blyant og den lille giftflaske på bordet og ville dermed fjerne seg. Da imidlertid Nagel våknet med det samme ble han nødt til å forklare hvorfor han var kommet inn.","Early the next morning, Minute met up again at the hotel. He went quietly into Nagel's room, put his watch, some papers, a blunt pencil and the small poison bottle on the table and wanted to get away.

He tiptoed into Nagel’s room and put his watch, some papers, a pencil stub, and the small vial containing poison on the table. He was just about to leave when Nagel woke up, and The Midget had to stay and explain his reason for being there.","EARLY THE NEXT MORNING Miniman again appeared at the hotel. He went quietly into Nagel’s room, put his watch, some papers, a pencil stub and the vial of poison on the table, and was about to go again.

"Da Nagel var kommet utenfor gav han seg til å gå bortover gaten med lange, hissige skritt. For en stivnakkethet hos denne pike, hvor hun var fattig og mistenksom! Så du sengen! sa han til seg selv; ikke engang halm i bunnen, ikke engang et laken over, men to underskjørter som hun kanskje måtte bruke begge to om dagen når det var koldt i været. Og allikevel så redd for å komme opp i noe ubekjent noe at hun avslår det beste tilbud! Men hva satan kom det forresten ham ved? Nei det kom ham egentlig ikke ved. Men det var dog som bare fan til pike; ikke? Om han sendte en mann til henne for å by på stolen, drive den i været, ville hun kanskje fatte mistanke da også? Det dumme menneske, det dumme menneske! Men hva ville han også der for å bli så knusende avvist?","When Nagel had come outside, he began to walk across the street with long, furious steps. What a stiff-neckedness in this girl, where she was poor and suspicious! You saw the bed! he said to himself; not even straw at the bottom, not even a sheet over, but two petticoats that she might have to wear both during the day when the weather was cold. And yet so afraid of coming up with something unknown that she declines the best offer! But by the way, what did Satan do to him? No, it did not really occur to him. But it was like just a fan to girl; not? If he sent a man to her to bid on the chair, to drive it up, maybe she would be suspicious too? The stupid man, the stupid man! But what did he also want there to be so crushingly rejected?","On leaving, Nagel furiously stalked up the street. What a stubborn creature she was—poor and suspicious! And that bed! Not even a straw mattress, not even a sheet, only those two petticoats —she probably had to wear them both in the daytime to protect herself against the cold! Yet she was so terrified of getting involved that she even refused a good offer! But what the devil did he care? He didn’t give a damn. But she really was the limit! Suppose he sent a man over to bid on the chair in order to drive the price up, would that also arouse her suspicions? What a stupid, stubborn creature! But why had he gone there and exposed himself to such a rebuff?","When Nagel got outside, he started walking down the street with long, agitated strides. What a stiff-necked woman, and how poor and suspicious she was! Did you see that bed? he said to himself; not even straw on the bottom, not even a sheet on top, only two petticoats, both of which she probably had to wear in the daytime when the weather was cold. And yet so afraid to get involved in something unfamiliar that she turned down the best of offers!10 But damn it all, what concern was it of his anyway? None, really. She was a helluva woman, though, wasn’t she? Suppose he sent a man over to make a bid on the chair, drive up the price, would that also arouse her suspicion? What an idiot, a real idiot! But why did he have to go there, only to be so crushingly refused?"
"Jeg daler, daler, lyset tar av, det blir mørkere og mørkere omkring meg, jeg ser jorden under mine øyne og jeg kjenner meg igjen, det er byer, vind og røk. Så stanser jeg. Jeg ser meg om, det er hav omkring meg. Jeg føler meg ikke lykkelig mere, jeg støter meg mot stener og jeg fryser. Det er hvit sandbunn under mine føtter og ovenover meg ser jeg intet annet enn vann. Jeg svømmer noen tak, jeg passerer mange underlige vekster, tykke, grønne bladplanter, havblomster, som står og duver frem og tilbake på stilker, – en stum verden hvor ikke en lyd høres, men hvor alt lever og beveges. Jeg svømmer igjen noen tak og kommer til et korallrev. Det var ingen koraller mere, revet var plyndret, men jeg sa: her har vært noen før! Og jeg følte meg ikke lenger så ensom da det hadde vært noen før. Jeg svømmer igjen, jeg vil komme iland, men jeg gjør dennegang blott et par tak, da jeg stanser. Jeg stanser fordi det ligger et menneske foran meg på bunnen; det er en kvinne, hun er lang og mager og hun ligger meget opprevet over en sten. Jeg rører ved henne og ser at jeg kjenner henne; men hun er død og jeg forstår ikke at hun er død, da jeg dog kjenner henne på korset med de grønne stener. Det er den samme kvinne som jeg nyss hadde fulgt efter gjennom de lange ganger, inn til de nummererte værelser. Jeg vil svømme videre, men jeg stanser og retter på henne; hun ligger spredt over en stor sten og det gjorde et uhyggelig inntrykk på meg. Hun holder øynene vidåpne, men jeg trekker henne med meg til en hvit plett og jeg ser korset om hennes hals, men jeg stikker det inn under hennes kjole for at ikke fiskene skal ta det fra henne. Så svømmer jeg bort ….","I fall, fall, the light fades, it gets darker and darker around me, I see the earth under my eyes and I recognize myself, there are cities, wind and smoke. Then I stop. I look around, there is sea around me. I do not feel happy anymore, I bump into rocks and I freeze. There is a white sandy bottom under my feet and above me I see nothing but water. I swim some roofs, I pass many strange plants, thick, green leafy plants, sea flowers, which stand and dove back and forth on stalks, - a dumb world where not a sound is heard, but where everything lives and moves. I swim some roof again and come to a coral reef. There were no more corals, the reef was looted, but I said: here have been some before! And I no longer felt so lonely when there had been someone before. I swim again, I want to come ashore, but this time I only do a few catches, when I stop. I stop because there is a human being in front of me at the bottom; it is a woman, she is tall and thin and she lies very upset over a rock. I touch her and see that I know her; but she is dead and I do not understand that she is dead, as I know her on the cross with the green stones. It's the same woman I had just followed through the long corridors, into the numbered rooms. I want to swim on, but I stop and correct her; she is lying scattered over a large rock and it made an eerie impression on me.

I swam a few strokes; around me were exotic plants, luscious green leafy plants, and flowers of the sea which swayed on their stems—a world of utter silence, but where everything lived and moved. I swam on and reached a coral reef. It had been plundered; all the coral was gone. I said to myself: ‘Somebody has been here before me,’ and I no longer felt so lonely. I started to swim toward the shore but stopped almost instantly. There was a body lying on the bottom right in front of me. It was a tall, slender woman. She was lying across a rock, her body badly mangled. I turned her over and realized that I had seen her before. I couldn’t understand how she could be dead; I recognized her by the cross with the green stones. It was the same woman I had followed through the long corridor with the numbered rooms. I wanted to swim on, but I felt I had to stop to straighten out her body; the way she was sprawled over that stone made a most ghastly impression on me. Her eyes were wide open.

Could I forget that face and that uniform ? After all, he’s a handsome man, and it isn’t that I find any fault with him; and yet I could wish him dead and gone. What’s the use of saying to myself, as I’ve done a hundred times: there you won’t get anywhere!7 Instead I try to avoid thinking about this impossibility, telling myself, Oh yes, I’ll get somewhere all right , lots of things can happen, there’s still hope.... And there is hope, isn’t there?”"

"Jeg skal så gjerne sludre vekk. Jeg er i det hele tatt i det hjørne i kveld; gud vet hva som går av meg …. Nå, den lille drøm det var nu forresten ikke noe. Jo jeg så altså en åpen myr, uten trær, bare med en hel masse røtter som lå omkring allevegne som underlig forvridde ormer. Det gikk så en gal mann om blant alle disse krokete trerøtter. Jeg ser ham ennu, han var blek og hadde et mørkt skjegg, men skjegget var så lite og tynt at hans ansikt overalt skinnet igjennom. Han stirret vidåpent omkring seg og hans øyne var fulle av lidelse. Jeg lå skjult bak en sten og jeg ropte til ham. Da ser han med én gang bort til stenen og stusset ikke på hvor ropet kom fra; det var som om han vel visste at det var nettopp der jeg lå, skjønt jeg var godt skjult. Han vedble å stirre på stenen hele tiden. Jeg tenkte: han finner meg allikevel ikke og i verste fall kan jeg springe min vei hvis han kommer. Og skjønt jeg ikke holdt av at han stod og stirret på meg så ropte jeg igjen for å erte ham. Han gjorde et par skritt imot meg, han hadde åpnet munnen og laget seg til å bite; men han kom ikke avsted, røttene dynget seg opp foran ham, han lessedes ned av røtter og kom ikke av flekken. Jeg ropte igjen; jeg ropte mange ganger i trekk, for å opphisse ham dyktig, og han gav seg til å arbeide med røttene og få dem vekk, han kastet dem bort i favnfuller og stridde tungt for å komme bort til meg; men det var forgjeves. Han begynte også å stønne så jeg hørte det helt bort til meg og hans øyne stod stive av smerte. Men da jeg så at jeg var så absolutt trygg reiste jeg meg opp og svinget luen og viste meg for ham i hele min skikkelse og ertet ham ved å rope hallo til ham uavlatelig og stampe i marken og rope hallo. Jeg gikk ham endog nærmere for å erte ham litt blodigere enda, jeg stakk fingrene ut og pekte på ham og ropte hallo i forsmedelig nærhet av hans øre, for å bringe ham om mulig ennu litt mere ut av fatning; derpå gikk jeg igjen tilbake og lot ham stå der og se på at jeg hadde vært ham så nær. Men han oppgav ennu ikke alt, han stridde fremdeles med røttene, slavet forherdet av smerte med å få dem bort, rev seg tilblods, slo seg over ansiktet, reiste seg på tærne og stod og skrek over til meg. Ja, vil De tenke Dem, han stod rett opp og ned på tærne og så på meg og skrek! Og da var hans ansikt dryppende av svette og fortrukket av en fryktelig lidelse fordi han ikke fikk fatt i meg. Jeg ville drive ham enda litt lenger, jeg gikk nærmere enda, knipset ham like foran nesen og sa tihihihihi med den grueligste hån. Jeg slengte en trerot mot ham, jeg traff ham over munnen, det lyktes meg å få ham nesten til å tumle om; men han spyttet bare blodet ut og tok seg opp til munnen og gav seg til å streve med røttene igjen. Da mente jeg at jeg kunne våge det, jeg strakte hånden ut og ville nå ham, jeg ville sette fingeren like på hans panne, og så trekke meg tilbake igjen. Men i det samme fikk han fatt i meg. Herregud, hvor det var redselsfullt da han fikk fatt i meg! Han gjorde et rasende grep og hugget seg fast i min hånd. Jeg gav et skrik; men han holdt meg bare i hånden, og så fulgte han meg. Vi gikk ut av myren, trerøttene var ham ikke lenger til noe mén da han hadde fått tak i hånden min, og vi kom til stenen der jeg først hadde skjult meg. Da vi kom dit kastet mannen seg ned for meg og kysset jorden der jeg hadde trådt; han lå blodig og sønderreven på kne foran meg og takket meg fordi jeg hadde vært god mot ham, han velsignet meg også og bad Gud velsigne meg til gjengjeld. Hans øyne var åpne og fulle av gode bønner for meg til Gud og han kysset ikke min hånd, nei ikke engang min sko, men jorden der mine sko hadde trådt. Jeg sa: Hvorfor kysser du jorden nettopp der jeg har gått? – Fordi, sa han, fordi min munn blør og jeg ikke vil smusse dine sko til. – Han ville ikke smusse mine sko til! – Så sa jeg igjen: Men hvorfor takker du meg når jeg dog har gjort deg ondt og bragt deg lidelse? – Jeg takker deg, svarte han, fordi du ikke bragte meg mere lidelse, fordi du var god mot meg og ikke martret meg mere enda. – Ja, sa jeg da, men hvorfor skrek du til meg og åpnet munnen for å bite meg? – Jeg ville ikke bite deg, svarte han, jeg åpnet munnen for å be deg om hjelp; men jeg kom ikke tilorde og du forstod meg ikke. Men da skrek jeg av riktig stor lidelse. – Var det derfor du skrek? spurte jeg igjen. – Ja derfor var det! …. Jeg så på den gale mann, han spyttet ennu blod ut, men bad allikevel til Gud for meg; jeg så at jeg hadde sett ham før og at jeg kjente ham; det var en halvgammel mann med grått hår og et lite usselt skjegg, – det var Minutten.","I'm so happy to chat away. I'm all in that corner tonight; god knows what's wrong with me…. Well, the little dream it was now by the way nothing. Well, I saw an open bog, without trees, only with a whole lot of roots that lay around everywhere like strangely twisted worms. Then a mad man walked among all these crooked tree roots. I can still see him, he was pale and had a dark beard, but his beard was so small and thin that his face shone through everywhere. He stared wide open around him and his eyes were full of suffering. I was hiding behind a rock and I shouted at him. Then he immediately looked over to the stone and did not wonder where the cry came from; it was as if he knew that was exactly where I was, although I was well hidden. He kept staring at the stone all the time. I thought: he will not find me anyway and in the worst case I can run my way if he comes. And although I did not like him standing and staring at me, I shouted again to tease him. He took a few steps towards me, he had opened his mouth and made himself bite; but he did not go away, the roots piled up in front of him, he was loaded down by roots and did not come off the stain. I shouted again; I cried many times in a row, to excite him skilfully, and he proceeded to work with the roots and get them away, he threw them away in embraces and struggled hard to get over to me; but it was in vain. He also started moaning so I heard it all the way to me and his eyes were stiff with pain. But when I saw that I was so absolutely safe, I got up and swung my hat and showed myself to him in my whole form and teased him by shouting hello to him incessantly and stomping in the ground and shouting hello. I went even closer to him to tease him a little bloodier even, I stuck my fingers out and pointed at him and shouted hello in disgusting proximity of his ear, to bring him if possible even a little more out of composure; then I went back and let him stand there and see that I had been so close to him. But he did not give up everything yet, he was still struggling with the roots, the slave hardened by the pain of getting them away, tore himself to death, slapped himself on the face, got up on his toes and stood and screamed at me. Yes, you will imagine, he stood straight up and down on his toes and looked at me and screamed! And then his face was dripping with sweat and preferred by a terrible affliction because he could not get hold of me. I wanted to drive him a little further, I went even closer, snapped him right in front of my nose and said tihihihihi with the most horrible mockery. I threw a tree root at him, I hit him over the mouth, I managed to make him almost tumble about; but he just spat the blood out and took it up to his mouth and began to struggle with the roots again. Then I thought I could dare, I stretched out my hand and wanted to reach him, I wanted to put my finger right on his forehead, and then pull myself back again. But at the same time he got hold of me. My God, how horrible it was when he got hold of me! He made a furious grip and grabbed my hand. I gave a scream; but he only held my hand, and then he followed me. We went out of the swamp, the tree roots were no longer to his detriment when he had got hold of my hand, and we came to the stone where I had first hidden. When we got there the man threw himself down before me and kissed the ground where I had entered; he lay bloody and torn on his knees in front of me and thanked me because I had been good to him, he also blessed me and asked God to bless me in return. His eyes were open and full of good prayers for me to God and he did not kiss my hand, no not even my shoes, but the ground where my shoes had stepped. I said: Why are you kissing the earth right where I have gone? - Because, he said, because my mouth is bleeding and I do not want to dirty your shoes. - He did not want to dirty my shoes! Then I said again: But why do you thank me when I have hurt you and brought you suffering? - I thank you, he replied, because you did not bring me more suffering, because you were good to me and did not torture me more yet. - Yes, I said then, but why did you scream at me and open your mouth to bite me? - I did not want to bite you, he replied, I opened my mouth to ask you for help; but I did not come to your senses and you did not understand me. But then I screamed of really great suffering. - Is that why you screamed? I asked again. - Yes, that's why it was! …. I looked at the mad man, he still spat blood out, but still prayed to God for me; I saw that I had seen him before and that I knew him; it was a middle-aged man with gray hair and a small, ugly beard - that was Minutes.","“I don’t mind talking. I’m just in the mood tonight; God knows what’s come over me. Well, the dream I mentioned wasn’t important. As I was saying, I saw a swamp, without trees, but with a myriad of roots sprawled in all directions like a mass of writhing serpents. Then I saw a madman walking among all those twisted roots. I can still see him; he was pale and had a dark beard, but it was so scraggly that his skin showed through. His eyes were full of suffering and he looked around distractedly. I was hiding behind a rock and I called out to him. He turned in my direction and wasn’t at all surprised at the sound of my voice. He seemed to know where I was, although I wasn’t visible. He kept on staring at the rock. He won’t find me, I thought, and if he does, I can make a dash for it. And although it made me uneasy to have him standing there staring, I shouted again, just to provoke him. He took a couple of steps toward me; his mouth was open as if he were about to bite, but he couldn’t get through the maze of roots. I cried out again, many times, to get him really worked up, and he began tugging at the roots to clear a path. He ripped them up by the armful and threw them aside in his struggle to reach me, but he got nowhere. He began groaning, too, and his eyes were bulging with pain and exertion. When I realized that I was safe, I got up, revealed myself to him in my full height and waved my cap, and drove him into a frenzy by stamping my feet and shouting hello over and over again. I even moved closer to him to rile him even more. I pointed my finger at him, yelling hello close to his ear to get him even more worked up. Then I crawled back behind my rock to taunt him and show him how close I was. But he hadn’t given up; he was still struggling with the roots, struggling stubbornly and wildly to rip them out of his path; they tore at him until he bled, his face was all scratched, but he raised himself on tiptoe and shouted at me. His face was distorted and steaming with sweat and rage because he couldn’t get at me. I wanted to egg him on even farther, so I edged closer still, snapped my fingers and jeered at him. I threw a root at him, which hit him right in the mouth. The blow almost knocked him down, but he spat out the blood, put his hand to his mouth, and went on fighting the roots. Then I decided to be daring and touch him; I wanted to poke my finger at his forehead and then pull away. But at that moment he grabbed me. Good God, did I panic! He lurched forward and grabbed my hand. I screamed, but all he did was to hold my hand and follow me. We made our way out of the swamp. The roots didn’t seem to bother him, now that he had a grip on my hand, and we reached the rock which had been my hiding place. He threw himself down and kissed the ground I had walked on. He knelt there before me, bloody and bruised, and thanked me for being so good to him. He blessed me too, and prayed to God to bless me for what I had done for him. His eyes were wide open and filled with supplications to God on my behalf. He didn’t kiss my hand or even my shoe but the earth my shoes had touched. ‘Why do you kiss the ground I have walked on?’ I asked. ‘Because my mouth is bleeding and I don’t want to soil your shoes,’ he said. ‘But why do you thank me when I’ve only hurt you and made you suffer?’ I persisted. ‘I thank you,’ he said, ‘for not causing me more suffering, because you were kind enough to torture me no further.’ ‘Yes, but why did you scream at me and open your mouth as if to bite me?’ ‘I wasn’t going to bite you,’ he said. ‘I opened my mouth to ask you for help, but the words wouldn’t come and you didn’t understand. And then I screamed in desperation.’ Is that what made you scream?’ I asked. ‘Yes, that was the reason.’ I looked at the crazed man, who was still spitting blood and still praying to God for me. Suddenly I realized that I had seen him before and that I knew him—a middle-aged man with gray hair and a scraggly beard: it was The Midget.” Nagel stopped.","Nagel said, smiling, “I’ll be glad to jabber away. All in all, I’m minded to this evening , God knows what’s come over me.... Well, actually, that little dream wasn’t anything to talk about. True, I did see an open marsh, without trees, only with lots of roots lying about everywhere, like strangely writhing serpents. And then a madman who was walking around among all those crooked tree roots. I can still see him, he was pale and had a dark beard, but the beard was so small and sparse that his skin showed through everywhere. He was staring about him with wide-open eyes, and his eyes were full of suffering. Hiding behind a rock, I called out to him. Then he instantly looked at the rock, without seeming to wonder where the call was coming from; it was as though he knew I was lying exactly there, though I was well hidden. He kept staring at the rock the whole time. He won’t find me anyway, I thought, and if worst comes to worst and he does, I can take to my heels. And though I didn’t like to have him staring at me, I called out once more to tease him. He took a couple of steps toward me, his mouth open and ready to bite, but he couldn’t get going; the roots were piling up before him—he was weighed down by roots and couldn’t budge. I called out again, many times in a row, to get him thoroughly worked up, and he began tackling the roots to clear them away, tossing them aside by armfuls in his laborious struggle to reach me. But it was no use. Then he started groaning, so loud that I could hear him despite the distance, his eyes fixed in a painful stare. When I saw I was perfectly safe, I got up and swung my cap, showing myself in my full height, teasing him by continually shouting halloo to him, stamping the ground and shouting halloo. I even went closer so I could tease him more cruelly still, thumbing my nose at him and crying halloo insultingly close to his ears, to bewilder him even more, if possible. Then I retraced my steps, leaving him there to realize how close to him I had been. But he wasn’t quite giving up; he was still struggling with the roots, inured to pain as he toiled to clear them away, getting scratched till the blood came and hurting his face, then raising himself on tiptoe to scream at me. Yes, can you imagine, he stood bolt upright on tiptoe staring at me and screaming! His face was dripping with perspiration, distorted by terrible suffering because he couldn’t get hold of me. Wanting to goad him even further, I went closer still, snapping my fingers under his nose and calling ‘tee-hee-hee-hee-hee’ with the most awful mockery. I flung a tree root at him, hitting him in the mouth, and almost succeeded in knocking him down; but he simply spat out the blood, put his hand to his mouth and continued to struggle with the roots. Then, thinking I could risk it, I stretched out my hand to touch him; I wanted to put my finger on his forehead and withdraw again. But at that moment he caught me. Good Lord, what a fright it gave me to be caught like that! He made a furious grab at me and clutched my hand. I screamed, but he simply held my hand and followed me. We walked out of the marsh—the tree roots no longer hampered him once he’d gotten hold of my hand—and came to the rock where I had at first been hiding. When we got there, the man prostrated himself before me and kissed the ground I had walked on; bloody and bruised, he kneeled before me, thanking me for having been kind to him. Then he blessed me, and prayed to God to bless me as well. His eyes were candid and filled with good prayers to God for me, and he didn’t kiss my hand, or even my shoes, but the ground where my shoes had trod. ‘Why do you kiss the ground exactly where I’ve walked?’ I asked.—‘Because,’ he said, ‘because my mouth is bleeding and I don’t want to dirty your shoes. ’—He didn’t want to dirty my shoes! Again I said, ‘But why do you thank me when I’ve done you harm and caused you pain?’—‘I thank you,’ he replied, ’‘because you didn’t cause me more pain, because you were kind enough not to torture me still more. ’—‘All right,’ I said, ‘but why did you scream at me and open your mouth to bite me?’—‘I wasn’t going to bite you,’ he replied, ‘I opened my mouth to ask you for help; but I couldn’t utter a word and you didn’t understand. And then I screamed because I suffered so terribly. ’—‘So that ’s why you screamed?’ I asked.—‘Yes, that’s why!’ ... I looked at the lunatic—he was still spitting blood but prayed to God for me all the same. I realized I had seen him before and that I knew him; he was a middle-aged man with gray hair and a miserable little beard—it was Miniman.” Nagel fell silent."

"De to tre mennesker som ennu sås i gatene hadde glade ansikter; inne på kirkegården gikk fremdeles en mann og trillet en trillebør og han sang sakte. Ellers var alt så stille at intet annet hørtes enn denne sang. Byen så ut fra høyden ved doktorens hus som et underlig, grenet kjempeinsekt, et fabeldyr som hadde kastet seg flatt på buken og strakt armer og horn og føletråder ut i alle retninger; bare hist og her rørte det et ledd eller trakk en klo til seg – som nu nede ved sjøen hvor en bitte liten dampjolle glidde lydløst innefter vågen og dro en fure i det sorte vann.","The two or three people still seen in the streets had happy faces; inside the cemetery a man was still walking and rolling a wheelbarrow and he was singing slowly. Otherwise, everything was so quiet that nothing else was heard but this song. The city looked from the heights of the doctor's house like a strange, branched giant insect, a fabulous animal that had thrown itself flat on its belly and stretched its arms and horns and feelers in all directions; only here and there did it touch a joint or pull a claw to itself - as now down by the sea where a tiny little steam dinghy slid silently down the ravine and pulled a furrow into the black water.","The few people who were still on the streets looked gay and animated. In the cemetery a man was pushing a wheelbarrow and singing to himself, despite the hour. Everything was so still that his voice was the only sound to be heard. The town lay sprawled below the doctor’s house like a strange, monstrous insect, flat on its belly with its tentacles stretched out in all directions. Here and there it would extend a leg or draw in a feeler, as now down on the fjord, where a small steamer glided along seemingly without a sound, leaving a black furrow behind it.","The two or three people who were still to be seen in the streets looked radiantly happy; in the cemetery a man was still trundling a wheelbarrow, singing softly. Otherwise, everything was so quiet that nothing could be heard except this song. From the elevation by the doctor’s house, the town looked like a weird, splayed giant insect, a fabulous creature that had thrown itself flat on its belly, extending arms and horns and feelers in all directions; only here and there did it move a joint or withdraw a claw—such as down by the seaside, where a tiny steam yawl glided soundlessly along the bay, leaving a furrow in the black water."

Han var så henrykt, så full av lykke, at han også lovet å tilse fru Stenersens have og da han var halvt fagmann undersøke jordbunnens beskaffenhet i havens nedre hjørne hvor den syke rips stod. Jo han skulle nok få bukt med lusen, om han så skulle lese over den, besverge den.","Now he was just waiting for the doctor to leave. At the view of this walk through the forest, he became livelier than before, talked about everything possible, made everyone laugh and was exquisitely gracious. He was so delighted, so full of happiness, that he also promised to look after Mrs. Stenersen's garden and when he was half a professional examine the condition of the soil in the lower corner of the garden where the sick currant stood. Yes, he would probably get rid of the lice, if he were to read over it, swear it.","He felt obliged to wait until the doctor returned. But the thought of walking with Dagny through the woods stimulated him; he talked incessantly, made everyone laugh, and was most affable. Elated as he was, he agreed to take a look at Mrs. Stenersen’s garden, since he considered himself something of an expert—particularly the corner where bugs had gotten at the currant bushes. He would get rid of them even if he had to exorcize them!","From now on he just waited for the doctor to be back so he could get going. At the prospect of this walk through the woods he became more vivacious, chatted with the guests about everything under the sun, making them all laugh, and was extremely amiable. He was so delighted, so filled with happiness, that he even promised to inspect Mrs. Stenersen’s garden and, in his capacity of a semi-expert, to examine the quality of the soil in the garden’s lower corner with the sick red currant bushes. He would get the better of the lice, all right, even if he had to read an incantation over them, exorcising them."
"Gud, var han syk?","God, was he sick?","Good God, was something wrong?","Good heavens, was he ill?"
"Han stusset, men fattet seg straks og ropte på Sara:","He was stunned, but immediately got up and shouted at Sara:",He started but then pulled himself together and asked Sara: “Is there somewhere we can talk for a moment?”,"Startled, he quickly composed himself and called to Sara, “Where could we go for a moment?”"
"Ja er det ikke en kar! fortsatte doktoren og smattet med tungen. Stakkar, han har vært forkjølet nu en stund, men det går forhåpentlig over. Det er ingen nu av politikere jeg så nødig ville miste som Gladstone. Du store min, når jeg tenker på ham så står han for meg som et fyrtårn, lysende ut over hele verden! …. De ser så fraværende ut, hr. Nagel; er De ikke enig?","Yes it's not a guy! continued the doctor, slapping his tongue. Poor thing, he's had a cold for a while now, but it's hopefully over. There are now no politicians I would be so reluctant to lose as Gladstone. You big mine, when I think of him he stands before me like a lighthouse, shining all over the world! …. They look so absent, mr. Nagel; do you not agree?","“There’s a real man for you,” exclaimed the doctor. “Poor fellow, he’s been down with a cold the past few days, but let’s hope he’s better. Gladstone is the statesman I personally feel we could least afford to lose. To me, he is like a lighthouse sending beams of light all over the world. You seem so far away, Mr. Nagel—don’t you agree?”","“Well, isn’t he a real man, though!” the doctor went on, smacking his tongue. “Poor fellow, he has had a cold for a while, but hopefully it will pass. There’s no living politician I would be so reluctant to lose as Gladstone. Goodness, when I think of him he appears like a lighthouse in front of me, sending its beams all over the world! ... You look so preoccupied, Mr. Nagel, don’t you agree?”"
Noe slemt for meg altså? La oss høre. Et mord for eksempel?,Something bad for me then? Let's hear. A murder for example?,"“Something terrible? Do tell. A murder, perhaps?”","“Something bad for me, then. Let’s hear. A murder, for instance?”"
"Hun holdt inne. Flere trekninger om munnen forrådte hennes bevegelse, hvert ord hun talte var heftig og inderlig, hun mente hva hun sa og la ikke fingrene imellom. Det ble en liten pause, så svarte han:","She held on. Several twitches around her mouth betrayed her movement, every word she spoke was fierce and earnest, she meant what she said and did not put her fingers in between. There was a short pause, and he replied:","She stopped. Her lips trembled, betraying her emotion. Every word had come straight from the heart—each had made a direct hit, as was her intention. After a short silence, he replied: “Yes, I know.","She broke off. The corners of her mouth twitched, betraying her emotion. Every word she spoke was impetuous and sincere, she meant what she said and pulled no punches. There was a brief pause before he answered."
"Nei, nei, gjør meg ikke aldeles fortvilet! ropte hun. Hva vil De ha meg til? Hva tenker De på? Mener De at jeg skal …. Herregud, la oss nu ikke tale mere om dette, så er De snill. Gå så! Nu har De ødelagt alt bare ved noen få dumme ord, endog alle våre samtaler har De spolert, og nu kan vi ikke treffes mere. Hvorfor gjorde De det? Nei hvis jeg hadde visst så galt! Ja ja, gjør nu ikke mere av det, jeg ber Dem både for Deres egen og for min skyld. De forstår da godt at jeg ikke kan være noe for Dem; jeg begriper ikke hvorledes De noensinne har kunnet tenke det. Så la det nu ikke vare lenger. De må gå hjem og forsøke å ta det med tål. Herregud, det gjør meg oppriktig ondt for Dem også; men jeg kan ikke handle anderledes.","No, no, do not make me completely despair! she yelled. What do you want me for? What are you thinking about? Do you think I should…. My God, let's not talk about this anymore, please. Go then! Now you have ruined everything with just a few stupid words, even all our conversations you have ruined, and now we can not meet again. Why did you do that? No if I had known so wrong! Yeah Al that sounds pretty crap to me, Looks like BT aint for me either. You understand then well that I can not be anything to you; I do not understand how you have ever been able to think that. So let it not last any longer. They have to go home and try to take it with them. My God, it sincerely hurts you too; but I can not act differently.","“Stop it! Don’t do this to me!” she cried. “What do you want from me? What can you be thinking of? Do you mean that I should … For God’s sake, let’s not talk about it any more, please! Now go! You’ve ruined everything with a few stupid remarks. You’ve spoiled everything—the talks we’ve had—and now we can’t see each other again! Why did you do it? I’ve never heard of anything so insane! I beg you, don’t mention this again, for your sake as well as mine. You know all too well that I can’t be anything to you. I can’t imagine how you could ever have gotten such an ideal Let’s put an end to this conversation. You just have to go home and try to accept it. I feel very sorry for you, but there’s nothing I can do.”","“No, no! Don’t bring me to utter despair!” she cried. “What do you want me to do? What are you thinking of? Do you mean that I should—. Good God, don’t let’s talk about it anymore, please. And now go! You’ve ruined everything with a few stupid words, you’ve even spoiled our talks, and now we won’t be able to meet anymore. Why did you do it? Oh, if I’d only had an inkling of it! Well, you must forget about it, I beg you, for your own sake as well as mine. You know very well I can never be anything to you ; I don’t see how you could ever get that idea. So don’t let us drag this out. You must go back to your room8 and try to resign yourself. Oh dear, I’m truly sorry for you, but there’s nothing else I can do.”"
"En stund efter falt han i en urolig slummer på sofaen, lå og vridde seg i drømme, talte høyt, sang, kalte på konjakk og drakk i halvsøvne og full av feber. Sara var jevnlig inne hos ham, og skjønt han talte nesten hele tiden med henne forstod hun bare lite av det han sa.

He lay with his eyes closed.","A while later, he fell into a fitful sleep on the sofa, writhing in nightmare, talking aloud, singing, calling for brandy, which he drank, feverish and only half awake.

"Hvorledes kan jeg få underrettet deg om at alt er gått godt? Jeg kan be kapteinen fløyte, hvis du synes så, fløyte fire eller fem ganger, går ikke det an? Der kan du se, jeg er ikke så dum.

"Ja gudskjelov, han hadde sin lille flaske i behold! Det luktet mandler av den og saften var klar som vann. Å jo, han ville allikevel få bruk for den meget snart, meget snart, når ingen annen råd fantes. Det ble allikevel enden. Og hvorfor ikke? Han hadde drømt så narraktig skjønt om en gjerning på jorden, noe som kunne «telle», noen bedrifter som kjøtteterne kunne korse seg over, – og det var falt dårlig ut; han hadde ikke maktet oppgaven.

"Han tvang seg straks til å være rolig, satte seg på en stol og tok opp fra gulvet en avis som han så i hist og her som om han leste.

"Om jeg kanskje kunne ha sagt noe som fikk dem til å gå løs på meg. Jeg tok dem i hånden og bad dem om forlatelse for å få dem til å gjøre meg så lite som mulig fortred. Men det nyttet ikke noe, de kledde meg grundig av. Doktoren fant også et brev som jeg hadde i lommen og dette brev gav han seg til å lese opp for de andre. Men da ble jeg litt edru igjen, for brevet var fra min mor som skrev til meg når jeg fór tilsjøs. Kort og godt: Jeg kalte doktoren en kran. For det var bekjent at han drakk meget. De er en kran! sa jeg. Herover ble han fryktelig hissig og ville ta meg i nakken, men det fikk de andre ham ifra. La oss heller slå ham full! sa byfogden om meg, som om jeg ikke var tilstrekkelig full før. Og de helte mere i meg enda fra forskjellige flasker. Bakefter kom så to av herrene som jeg nu ikke husker hvem var, men de kom inn med en balje vann; de satte baljen midt på gulvet og sa at jeg skulle døpes. Ja allesammen ville at jeg skulle døpes, de gjorde et veldig skrål i anledning av dette påfunn. Og de fant på å blande forskjellige ting i vannet for å gjøre det urent, de spyttet i det og tømte brennevin i det og var endog ute i sengeværelset efter det verste de kunne finne og helte det opp i vannet, og ovenpå dette strødde de så to skufler aske fra kakkelovnen for å gjøre det litt mere grumset for meg enda. Så skulle jeg døpes. Hvorfor kan De ikke like så godt døpe en av de andre? spurte jeg byfogden og holdt ham om knærne. Vi er allerede døpt, svarte han, døpt på selvsamme måte, sa han. Og det tror jeg også, for således ville han alltid ha det med dem han omgikkes, at de skulle døpes. Kom, jeg vil stede deg for mitt åsyn! sa så byfogden straks efter til meg. Men jeg gikk ikke med det gode, jeg stod stille og holdt meg fast i dørvrideren. Kom på timen, vil du komme på minutten! sa han; for han sa ikke minuttet, han var fra Gudbrandsdalen og talte slik. Men nei, jeg gikk ikke. Da brølte kaptein Prante: Minutten, Minutten, det er ordet! Han må døpes Minutten, døpes Minutten! Og allesammen var enige i å døpe meg Minutten fordi jeg var så liten. Men nu tok to mann og slepte meg til byfogden og stedte meg for hans åsyn, og da jeg var så ubetydelig av vekst tok byfogden ganske alene og dukket meg under i baljen. Han dukket mitt hode helt under og gnidde min nese mot bunnen av baljen hvor det lå aske og glasskår, og derpå tok han meg opp igjen og leste over meg. Så skulle fadderne gjøre sin gjerning med meg og den bestod i at de løftet meg hver især høyt opp fra gulvet og slapp meg ned igjen, og da de var kjede av dette stillet de seg i to partier og kastet meg som en ball fra det ene parti til det andre; dette gjorde de for at jeg skulle bli tørr igjen og de fortsatte med det like til de var aldeles kjede av det. Så ropte byfogden: Holdt! Og derpå slapp de meg og kalte meg Minutten allesammen og tok meg i hånden og kalte meg Minutten for å besegle min dåp. Men ennu en gang ble jeg kastet i baljen, det var doktor Kolbye som kastet meg dit igjen med hele min vekt så jeg knekket meg i siden, fordi han ikke kunne glemme at jeg hadde kalt ham en kran …. Fra den natt ble mitt klengenavn sittende på meg. Dagen efter visste hele byen at jeg hadde vært hos byfogden og var blitt døpt.","If only I could have said something that made them attack me. I took them by the hand and asked them for forgiveness to make them do me as little harm as possible. But it did not help, they thoroughly undressed me. The doctor also found a letter that I had in my pocket and this letter he read aloud to the others. But then I got a little sober again, because the letter was from my mother who wrote to me when I went to sea. In short: I called the doctor a crane. For it was known that he drank a lot. They're a crane! so I. Above, he became terribly angry and wanted to grab me by the neck, but the others got him out of it. Let's rather get him drunk! said the mayor about me, as if I had not been sufficiently drunk before. And they poured more into me even from different bottles. Afterwards came two of the gentlemen whom I now do not remember who were, but they came in with a tub of water; they put the tub in the middle of the floor and said I should be baptized. Yes, everyone wanted me to be baptized, they made a big noise on the occasion of this invention. And they thought of mixing different things in the water to make it unclean, they spat in it and emptied liquor in it and were even out in the bedroom after the worst they could find and poured it into the water, and on top of this they sprinkled so two shovels of ash from the tile stove to make it a little more cloudy for me even. Then I was to be baptized. Why can you not just as well baptize one of the others? I asked the mayor, holding him by the knees. We are already baptized, he replied, baptized in the same way, he said. And I think so too, for thus he would always have it with those with whom he associates, that they should be baptized. Come, I will present you before me! said the mayor immediately after to me. But I did not go with the good, I stood still and held on to the doorknob. Arrive on time, you will arrive on the minute! he said; for he did not say the minute, he was from Gudbrandsdalen and spoke like that. But no, I did not go. Then Captain Prante roared: The minute, the minute, that's the word! He must be baptized Minute, baptized Minute! And everyone agreed to baptize me Minutes because I was so small. But now two men took me and dragged me to the town bailiff and placed me in front of his face, and when I was so insignificant in stature, the town bailiff took me quite alone and hid me in the tub. He completely submerged my head and rubbed my nose against the bottom of the tub where there was ash and shards of glass, and then he picked me up again and read over me. Then the godparents were to do their deed with me and it consisted of them lifting me each high up from the floor and letting me down again, and when they were tired of this they stood in two parts and threw me like a ball from one party to the other; they did this to make me dry again and they continued to do so until they were completely bored of it. Then the mayor shouted: Held! And then they released me and called me Minutes all together and took me by the hand and called me Minutes to seal my baptism. But once again I was thrown in the tub, it was Dr. Kolbye who threw me there again with all my weight so I broke my side, because he could not forget that I had called him a crane…. From that night on, my nickname stayed with me. The next day the whole city knew that I had been to the town bailiff and had been baptized.","“I thought I might have said something that made them jump on me. I asked their forgiveness so that they would hurt me as little as possible. But it didn’t help—they still stripped me completely. The doctor found a letter in my pocket and began reading it out loud. That sobered me a little, because it was a letter from my mother, who used to write to me when I was at sea. Well, I ended up calling the doctor a sot, because everyone knew how much he drank. ‘You’re a sot!’ I cried, at which the doctor went wild and tried to grab me by the throat, but the others stopped him. ‘ Let’s get some liquor into him instead,’ the mayor said—as if I hadn’t had enough already. And then they began pouring it into me from all kinds of bottles. After that, two gentlemen—I don’t remember which ones they were—came in with a tub of water. They put the tub down in the center of the room and announced that they were going to baptize me. Well, they all thought this was a great idea, and let out terrific yells to show their approval. Then they proceeded to put all kinds of filth into the water; they spat into it, emptied liquor into it, and even went into the bedroom for the worst they could find and dumped it into the water. And, on top of it all, they poured two shovelfuls of cinders from the stove to make it still filthier. Then they were ready to begin the ceremony. ‘Why can’t you baptize one of the others?’ I asked, grabbing the mayor by the knees. ‘We’ve already been baptized,’ he said, ‘and in the same way!’ And I believed him because he always wanted the people he caroused with to be baptized. “‘Come here,’ the mayor demanded, but I wouldn’t yield, I just stood there hanging on to the doorknob for dear life. “ ‘Come right over here this minute!’ he cried, but I still refused. But he didn’t say ‘minute’; it sounded more like ‘midget,’ because he came from Gudbrandsdal and that’s the way they talk. But still I wouldn’t move. Then Captain Prante roared: The Midget, The Midget, that’s it. We have to baptize him The Midget!’ And everyone agreed to that, because I’m so small. Two of them grabbed me and dragged me off to the mayor, and I was such a lightweight the mayor lifted me all by himself and dunked me in the tub. He put my head under, rubbed my nose against the bottom of the tub, which was full of ashes and broken glass, whereupon he pulled me up and said prayers over me. Then the godfathers had to get into the act. Each of them lifted me up in the air and then dropped me, and when they got bored with that, they lined up on either side and tossed me from one to the other, like a ball. They said they were doing this to dry me off, and kept that game up until they tired of it. Then the mayor ordered them to stop, so they dropped me and called me The Midget, all of them; they all shook hands with me and called me The Midget to make the baptism official. Then they threw me into the tub again— this time it was Dr. Kolbye, and he was so violent that he hurt me badly on the side —apparently he couldn’t forget that I had called him a sot. Since that night my nickname has stuck. The next day the whole town knew that I had been at the mayor’s house and that I had been baptized.”","“In case I might have said something that made them jump at me.5 I shook hands with them and apologized, so they would do me as little harm as possible. But it was no use, they stripped me completely. Also, the doctor found a letter in my pocket and began reading it to the others. Then I sobered up a bit, for the letter was from my mother, who used to write to me when I went to sea. In plain words, I called the doctor a sponge. Everyone knew he was a heavy drinker. ‘You’re a sponge!’ I said. That made him terribly angry, and he tried to grab me by the scruff of the neck, but the others stopped him. ‘Let’s make him drunk instead!’ said the justice of the peace, as if I wasn’t sufficiently drunk already. And they poured still some more into me from several bottles. Afterward two of the men—I can’t remember who they were anymore—but, anyway, they came in with a tub of water. They put the tub in the middle of the room and said I was to be baptized. In fact, they all wanted me to be baptized and greeted this caprice with a tremendous hullabaloo. Then they had the idea of mixing all sorts of things into the water to make it dirty, spitting into it and pouring in liquor, even going to the bedroom for the worst thing they could find and dumping it into the water. And on top of it all they scattered two shovelfuls of ashes from the stove, to make it still more muddy for me. Then everything was ready for the baptism. ‘Why can’t you just as well baptize one of the others?’ I asked the justice of the peace, embracing his knees. ‘We’ve been baptized already,’ he replied, ‘baptized in the very same way,’ he said. And I believed him, because that was always what he wanted of those he associated with, that they should be baptized. The next moment the justice of the peace said to me, ‘And now I shall let you come before my countenance!’ But I refused to go willingly; I stood pat, hanging on to the doorknob. ‘ Come now, right this min—stir your stumps, mini man!’ he said. He was from upcountry and spoke like that. But no, I refused to budge. Then Captain Prante yelled, ‘Miniman, Miniman, that’s it! He shall be baptized Miniman, yes, Miniman!’ And everyone agreed to have me baptized Miniman, because I was so small. And now two of the men dragged me over to the justice of the peace and brought me before his countenance, and since I was so puny the justice of the peace ducked me under in the tub all by himself. He ducked my head all the way under and rubbed my nose against the bottom of the tub, which was covered with ashes and shards of glass; and then he pulled me out again and recited a prayer over me. Afterward the godparents were to do their thing, and that consisted of each of them lifting me high up from the floor and dropping me, and when they were tired of that they lined up in two teams and tossed me from one team to the other like a ball; this was done so I would dry again, and they kept it up until they were good and tired of it. Then the justice of the peace shouted, ‘Stop!’ And so they let me go and called me Miniman, every one of them, shook hands with me and called me Miniman to seal my baptism. But then I was again thrown into the tub, this time by Dr. Kolbye, who used such force that I fell with my whole weight and injured my side, because he couldn’t forget that I had called him a sponge.... My nickname has stuck to me ever since. The next day the whole town knew I’d been at the house of the justice of the peace and been baptized.”"
"Det er én ting som gleder meg over all måte, sa doktoren med helt fuktige øyne, det er at Gladstone lever ennu. Brygg nu, mine herrer, så drikker vi en skål for Gladstone, ja for Gladstone, denne store og rene demokrat, nutidens og fremtidens mann.","There's one thing that pleases me in every way, said the doctor with completely damp eyes, is that Gladstone is still alive. Brew now, gentlemen, and we'll drink a toast to Gladstone, yes to Gladstone, this great and pure Democrat, the man of the present and the future.","“But there is one thing that makes me very happy,” said Dr. Stenersen with tears in his eyes. “Gladstone is still alive. Fill your glasses, gentlemen, and we’ll drink to Gladstone—a great democrat, a man of the present and of the future.”","“There is one thing which makes me extremely happy,” the doctor said, his eyes quite moist, “namely, that Gladstone is still alive.

"Det synes De er en lang tid? Jeg sliter ikke en slik skjorte som et dyr, jeg gjør meg jo ikke noen flid for å få hull på den, derfor tar jeg den også av meg om natten og ligger naken, for ikke å slite den i unytte når jeg bare ligger og sover. På den måten får jeg den til å vare meget lenger og jeg kan fritt bevege meg blant folk uten å stå tilskamme av den grunn at jeg ingen skikkelig skjorte har.

Hun talte også om Dem ….","Do you think that is a long time? I do not wear such a shirt like an animal, I do not do my best to get a hole in it, therefore I also take it off me at night and lie naked, so as not to wear it to no avail when I just lie and sleep . That way I make it last much longer and I can move freely among people without being ashamed for the reason that I do not have a proper shirt. And now with the tableaux, I guess I still have a shirt that I can show myself in. Miss Dagny still insists that I perform. I met her yesterday at church. She also talked about you….","“Does that seem like a long time ago to you? I wouldn’t mistreat a fine shirt like this. I’m very careful with it and that’s why I take it off at night and sleep naked, so as not to give it needless wear and tear.

She also mentioned you …”","“For Christmas?” “You think that’s a long time ago?3 I don’t wear a shirt like that ragged, as if I were some animal, doing my worst to make holes in it; so I take it off at night and sleep naked, in order not to wear it out to no purpose when I’m sleeping.

"Hvis jeg hadde en gud, sa han da, en gud som var meg riktig høy og hellig, så ville jeg sverge ved den gud at jeg mener oppriktig alt hva jeg har sagt Dem, absolutt alt, og at jeg mener å gjøre det beste selv når jeg forvirrer Dem. De sa forrige gang vi talte sammen at jeg stod som en motsigelse til alt hva andre folk mente om tingene. Ja det er sant, jeg erkjenner at jeg er en levende motsigelse og jeg forstår det ikke selv. Men jeg er ute av stand til å begripe at ikke også alle andre mennesker mener det samme om tingene som jeg. I den grad greie og gjennomskuelige synes spørsmålene meg og så skinnende klart ser jeg sammenhengen i dem. Dette er min hjertens mening, frøken; gid jeg kunne få Dem til å tro meg, nu og alltid.","If I had a god, he said then, a god who was really high and holy to me, then I would swear by that god that I sincerely mean everything I have told you, absolutely everything, and that I mean to do the best myself when I confuse you. They said last time we talked that I stood as a contradiction to everything other people thought about things. Yes it is true, I admit that I am a living contradiction and I do not understand it myself. But I am unable to comprehend that not all other people think the same about things as I do. To the extent that the questions seem straightforward and transparent to me, and so shining clearly I see the connection in them. This is the meaning of my heart, miss; I wish I could make you believe me, now and always.","By way of answer, he said: “If I had a god who to me was sacred and omniscient, I would swear by that god that I meant every word I said to you and that I always mean to be honest even when I succeed only in confusing you. The last time we talked, you said that my thoughts and opinions were diametrically opposed to everyone else’s. I admit that; I’m a living contradiction, and I don’t understand it myself. I just can’t understand why other people don’t share my beliefs and convictions. These basic concepts appear perfecdy obvious to me, and the issues stemming from them seem to fall perfectly into place. This is truly what my heart tells me, Miss Kielland. How I wish I could make you believe that, now and for all time.”","“If I had a god,” he then said, “a god I regarded as truly high and holy, I would swear by that god that I sincerely mean everything I’ve said to you, absolutely everything, and that I have the best intentions even when I confuse you.

I simply cannot grasp why everyone else doesn’t share my view of things. That’s how plain and transparent all problems seem to me, and that’s how luminously clear my vision of the underlying truth behind them is. This is my deepest conviction, Miss Kielland. If only I could make you believe me, now and always.”"

"Han lå ennu i noen tid og nøt sin ensomhet. Så hørte han skritt nede på stien, virkelige skritt som han ikke kunne ta feil av. Han stakk hodet opp og så en mann som kom fra byen. Mannen bar et langt brød under armen og ledet en ku bak seg i et tau; han tørket også stadig vekk svetten av sitt ansikt og gikk i bare skjorteermene for varmens skyld, men hadde allikevel et tykt rødt ullskjerf to ganger om halsen. Nagel lå stille og iakttok bonden. Der hadde vi ham! Der var setesdølen, nordmannen, hehe, jo der var den innfødte, med kaka under armen og kua i hælene! Å, det var et syn! Hehehehehe, Gud hjelpe deg, du gjeve Norges viking, om du løste litt på skjerfet og slapp lusa ut! Du kunne ikke leve, du ville få frisk luft av det og dø. Og pressen ville beklage din fortidlige avgang og gjøre et nummer av det; men for å forebygge gjentagelser ville den liberale stortingsmann Vetle Vetlesen innbringe et forslag om streng fredning av det nasjonale utøy.","He lay still for some time enjoying his solitude. Then he heard footsteps down the path, real footsteps he could not mistake. He stuck his head up and saw a man coming from the city. The man carried a long loaf under his arm and led a cow behind him in a rope; he also constantly wiped away the sweat from his face and wore only his shirt sleeves for the sake of warmth, but still wore a thick red wool scarf twice around his neck. Nagel lay still and watched the farmer. There we had him! There was the seat-dweller, the Norwegian, hehe, yes there was the native, with the cake under his arm and the cow on his heels! Oh, that was a sight! Hehehehehe, God help you, you gift of the Vikings of Norway, if you loosened your scarf a little and let the lice out!

There he was—the Norwegian country bumpkin with bread under his arm and leading a cow on a rope! What a sight he made! God help you, bold Norse Viking! Pull your pants down and let the lice out!

"Nå, sier fruen ironisk ….

"Det gleder meg, sa han i en tørr tone, at De bestemmer Dem til å overlate meg stolen. Nu kommer vi til prisen. Nei om forlatelse, vent litt, la meg tale ut, jeg vil ikke ha Dem til å forlange, prisen bestemmer jeg alltid selv. Jeg takserer en ting, byr så og så meget for den, og dermed basta! De kunne ville forlange en ublu sum. De kunne ville trekke meg opp, hvorfor ikke? Mot dette kan De innvende at De vel egentlig ikke ser så glupsk ut, – godt, det erkjenner jeg villig; men allikevel, jeg har med mange slags mennesker å gjøre og jeg holder av å bestemme prisen selv, så vet jeg hva jeg gjør. Det er prinsipp hos meg. Hva hindrer Dem i å forlange for eksempel tre hundre kroner for den stol om De selv fikk råde? De kunne gjøre det så meget heller som De vet at det i virkeligheten er et kostbart og sjeldent møbel her er tale om. Men en slik fabelpris er det meg umulig å betale; jeg sier det rent ut for at De ikke skal gjøre Dem illusjoner. Jeg vil dog ikke ruinere meg, jeg måtte jo være gal om jeg betalte Dem tre hundre kroner for den stol; kort og godt: jeg gir Dem to hundre for den, ikke en skilling mere. Hva jeg finner en ting verd vil jeg betale, men ikke mere.","I'm glad, he said in a dry tone, that you decide to leave the chair to me. Now we come to the part where we talk about the middle ground. No about leaving, wait a minute, let me speak, I do not want you to demand, the price I always decide myself. I value a thing, bid so and so much for it, and thus basta! They could want to demand an exorbitant sum. They could want to pull me up, why not? Against this you can object that you do not really look so greedy - well, I admit it willingly; but still, I deal with many kinds of people and I like to decide the price myself, so I know what I'm doing. That's a principle with me. What prevents you from demanding, for example, three hundred kroner for the chair if you were allowed to do so yourself? You could do it as much as you know that it is in fact an expensive and rare piece of furniture. But such a fabulous price it is impossible for me to pay; I say it outright so that you do not have any illusions. I do not want to ruin myself, however, I must be mad if I paid you three hundred kroner for that chair; in short: I give you two hundred for it, not a penny more. What I find worth a thing I will pay, but no more.","“I’m glad that you’re willing to part with the chair,” he said casually. “Now let’s discuss the price—no, please let me finish. I won’t let you set the price; I always do that myself. I evaluate the object, offer a price, and that’s it! Otherwise you might ask far too much and try to force me to accept your terms—and why shouldn’t you? You might insist that your price is not excessive. That’s true enough, but still, I have to deal with all kinds of people, and I prefer to set the prices myself, to feel in control. It’s a question of principle. If it were up to you, what would prevent you from asking three hundred crowns for that chair? You would be justified since you know we are discussing a rare and valuable piece. But I couldn’t pay a fantastic price like that— I’m telling you this in all honesty, since I wouldn’t want you to have any false illusions. I’m not going to ruin myself financially; I would be out of my mind if I paid you three hundred crowns for that chair! I’ll give you two hundred for it and not a shilling more. I’m willing to pay what I consider an object to be worth, but I won’t go higher than that.”","“I’m glad,” he said in a dry tone of voice, “that you have decided to let me have the chair. And now we’ll discuss the price. No, pardon me, wait a moment , let me finish: I don’t want you to give me a price, I always set the price myself. I appraise the article, offer so and so much for it, and that’s that! You might want to ask an exorbitant sum. You might try to overcharge me, why not? To this you may object that you can’t really look that greedy—fine, I readily acknowledge that; but still, I have to deal with all kinds of people and I like to set the price myself, then I know what I’m doing. It’s a question of principle with me. What could stop you, for instance, from asking three hundred kroner for that chair, if you had your way? You would be all the more likely to do so knowing, as you do, that we are, in fact, talking about a rare and precious piece of furniture. But I couldn’t possibly pay such a fabulous price; I say this straight out so that you won’t have any illusions on that score. After all, I have no wish to ruin myself, I would be crazy if I paid three hundred kroner for that chair. In short, I’ll give you two hundred kroner for it, not a penny more. I’ll pay what I find an article to be worth, but no more.”"

Had she got up when he came to find out once again if he dared to approach her?,"An intense feeling of elation surged through him, and he almost came to a standstill at this astonishing sight. So she hadn’t gone to the bazaar this evening—or perhaps she was only taking a stroll before the tableaux went on? She walked very slowly, even stopping to look up at the birds that were beginning to stir among the trees. Had she seen him? Did she want to test him? Was she deliberately walking in front of him to see whether he would dare approach her?","A tremor shot through him from top to toe, and he almost came to a standstill for a moment; he was astounded. So she hadn’t gone to the bazaar this evening? Or was she simply taking a short walk before the tableaux began?

"Nu kan De si: men hva har denne historie å gjøre med Dem og meg og ungkarslaget? Nei, beste venn, ganske visst, den har såmenn intet å gjøre dermed. Men det falt meg inn å fortelle den allikevel, som en prøve på min stupiditet angående den menneskelige sjel. Akk, den menneskelige sjel! Hva synes De således om at jeg en morgenstund for noen dager siden griper meg i – griper meg Johan Nilsen Nagel i – å vandre utenfor konsul Andresens hus deroppe på bakken og grunde på hvor høyt eller hvor lavt det antagelig kunne være opp til taket i hans dagligstue? Hva synes De? Men dette er, om jeg så tør uttrykke det, den menneskelige sjel igjen. Ingen bagateller er den uvedkommende, altsammen har sin betydning for den …. Hva inntrykk gjør det for eksempel på Dem når De sent en natt kommer hjem fra et eller annet møte, en eller annen ekspedisjon, og De går i Deres lovlige ærend, og De da plutselig støter på en mann som står ved et hjørne og ser på Dem, ja som dreier hodet efter Dem, efterhvert som De passerer, og bare stirrer på Dem og intet sier? Nu setter jeg attpå kjøpet at mannen har sorte klær på og at De ikke kan se annet av ham enn hans ansikt og hans øyne, hva så? Akk, det foregår mangt i den menneskelige sjel! …. De kommer en kveld inn i et selskap, la oss si på tolv stykker, og den trettende – det kan være en telegrafistinne, en stakkars juridisk kandidat, en kontorist, en dampskipskaptein, kortsagt: en person uten noensomhelst betydning – sitter i en krok og deltar ikke i konversasjonen og gjør heller ikke på annen måte noen støy; men denne trettende person har allikevel sin verdi, ikke bare i og for seg, men også som en faktor i selskapet. Nettopp fordi han har den drakt, fordi han forholder seg så stum, fordi hans øyne ser såpass dumt og intetsigende omkring på de øvrige gjester og fordi hans rolle i det hele tatt er å være så lite betydelig, bidrar han til å gi selskapet dets karakter. Nettopp fordi han intet sier virker han negativt og skaper den svake tone av dysterhet i hele stuen som gjør at de andre gjester nettopp bare taler så høyt og ikke høyere. Har jeg ikke rett? Denne person kan derved bokstavelig bli selskapets mektigste mann. Jeg forstår meg, som sagt, ikke på mennesker, men det morer meg allikevel ofte å iaktta hvilken forferdelig verdi bagatellene kan inneha. Jeg har således engang vært vidne til at en vill fremmed stakkars ingeniør som absolutt ikke lukket sin munn opp …. Men det er en annen historie og vedkommer ikke denne, uten forsåvidt som de begge har passert min hjerne og avsatt sine spor. Men for å bli i lignelsen: hvo vet om ikke Deres taushet nu iaften nettopp legger den særegne tone over mine ord – min umåtelige beruselse ufortalt –, om ikke denne mine som De nu har i Deres ansikt, dette halvt sky og halvt uskyldige uttrykk i Deres øyne nettopp stimulerer meg til å tale som jeg gjør! Det er ganske naturlig. De lytter til det jeg sier – hva jeg en full mann sier –, De kjenner Dem nu og da på en eller annen måte rammet – for å benytte det allerede brukte uttrykk rammet –, og jeg føler meg fristet til å gå enda videre på og slynger Dem nok et halvt snes ord i ansiktet. Jeg anfører dette bare som et eksempel på bagatellenes verdi. Overse ikke bagatellene, kjære venn! For Guds skyld, bagatellene har en veldig verdi …. Kom inn!","Now you can say: but what does this story have to do with you and me and the bachelor party? No, best friend, of course, it has nothing to do with it. But it occurred to me to tell it anyway, as a test of my stupidity regarding the human soul. Alas, the human soul! So what do you think about the fact that one morning a few days ago I intervened - Johan Nilsen Nagel intervened - to walk outside Consul Andresen's house up there on the ground and ponder how high or how low it could probably be up to the ceiling in his living room? What do you think? But this is, if I dare say so, the human soul again. No trifle is the irrelevant, everything has its meaning for it…. What impression does it make on you, for example, when you come home late one night from some meeting, some expedition, and you go on your legal errands, and you then suddenly come across a man standing at a corner and watching You, yes, who turn their heads after you as you pass, and just stare at you and say nothing? Now I put on the purchase that the man is wearing black clothes and that you can see nothing of him but his face and his eyes, so what? Alas, a lot is going on in the human soul! …. They come into a company one night, let's say twelve, and the thirteenth - it could be a telegraph operator, a poor legal candidate, a clerk, a steamship captain, in short: a person without any significance - is sitting in a corner and does not participate in the conversation nor does it otherwise make any noise; but this thirteenth person still has its value, not only in and of itself, but also as a factor in the company. Precisely because he has that suit, because he behaves so dumb, because his eyes look so stupid and bland around the other guests and because his role at all is to be so insignificant, he helps to give the company its character . Precisely because he says nothing, he seems negative and creates the faint tone of gloom throughout the living room that makes the other guests just speak so loud and not louder. Am I not right? This person can thus literally become the most powerful man in the company. As I said, I do not understand people, but it still often amuses me to observe what terrible value the trifles can have. I have thus once witnessed a wild stranger poor engineer who absolutely did not open his mouth…. But it's a different story and does not relate to this one, except insofar as they have both passed my brain and left their mark. But to stay in the parable: who knows if not your silence this evening just puts the peculiar tone over my words - my immense intoxication unspoken -, if not this mine that you now have in your face, this half cloud and half innocent expression in Their eyes just stimulate me to speak as I do! It's pretty natural. You listen to what I say - what I say to a drunk man -, you know yourself now and then somehow affected - to use the already used expression affected -, and I feel tempted to go even further and throws another half a dozen words in your face. I cite this only as an example of the value of trifles. Do not overlook the trifles, dear friend! For God's sake, the trifles have a very value…. Come in!","Nagel drank some more wine and went on talking: “You may ask what this story has to do with you and me and the stag party. Nothing whatever, my friend. But I felt like telling it to you anyway to prove how dense I am when it comes to human behavior. Oh, that human psyche! What do you think I, Johan Nilsen Nagel, caught myself doing the other morning? I found myself pacing up and down in front of Consul Andresen’s house on the hill, trying to estimate the height of the ceiling in his living room! Isn’t that bizarre? But there you have the psyche rearing up its head again! It records the most insignificant detail; there isn’t anything that isn’t absorbed. How would you feel, for instance, if on your way home one night from work or from a meeting you suddenly came upon a man standing on a corner staring at you in silence and turning to follow you with his gaze as you walk by? And suppose that the man, to confound things further, is dressed in black, and all you can see are his face and eyes? Ah, the vagaries of human behavior! One evening you go to a party; there are twelve of you, let’s say, plus a thirteenth —it might be the girl in the telegraph office, an impoverished law student, a clerk, or even the captain of a steamer—in other words, someone of no importance. This person sits in a corner and doesn’t participate in the conversation but still makes his presence felt and, despite his silence, plays a distinct role in the group. It’s because he is dressed in a certain way, because he is so uncommunicative, because he looks at the others with such an empty and indifferent expression, and because he is a nobody, that he contributes to the gathering just by his presence. It’s precisely because he contributes nothing that he constitutes a negative force and creates the gloomy atmosphere that makes the other guests talk in muted voices. Don’t you agree? In this way, the person in question can become, paradoxically, the center of attraction. As I told you, I’m no judge of character, but it’s amusing to observe the importance of apparently insignificant things. “I was once present when an engineer, a complete stranger in the crowd, who didn’t even open his mouth… . But that’s another story and has nothing to do with what we’re talking about, except that it made a vivid impression on me. But to come back to the trend of thought that brought this on: maybe it’s your stony silence this evening that has given a different slant to my words—apart from the fact that I’m drunk. Or could it be your expression—that half-shy, half-innocent look in your eyes that makes me talk this way? It’s perfectly natural. You listen to me—to what a drunken man says—and now and then something hits home—I repeat—hits home. And I feel tempted to go still further and fling another dozen words in your face. I mention this again to emphasize the value of insignificant things. Don’t overlook trifles, my friend—they are of the utmost importance. “Come in!”","“Now, you may ask what this story has to do with you and me and the bachelor party. To be sure, my good friend, it has nothing whatever to do with it. But I decided to tell it to you anyway, to show my stupidity concerning the human soul. Alas, the human soul! For instance, what do you make of the fact that, the other morning, I catch myself—catch me, Johan Nilsen Nagel—walking in front of Consul Andresen’s house up there on the hill, wondering how high, or how low, the ceiling might be in his living room? What do you make of it? But here again we have—if I may so express it—the human soul. No trifle is irrelevant to it, everything is meaningful.... How would you feel, say, if one night, coming home late from some meeting or expedition having to do with your lawful business, you suddenly bump into a man who stands at a street corner watching you, turning his head to keep you in sight as you pass, all the while simply staring at you without a word? Suppose, further, that the man is dressed in black and that all you can see of him are his face and eyes. Well, what of it? Ah, who can fathom what takes place in the human soul! ... You join a company some evening, let’s say there are twelve of you, and the thirteenth—it may be a female telegraph operator, a poor law school graduate, an office clerk, or a steamship captain, in short, a person of no importance whatever—sits in a corner without taking part in the conversation, or making any other kind of noise; and yet, this thirteenth person does have a value, not only per se but also as a factor in the group. Just because he’s wearing this or that garb, because he remains so silent, because he looks around at the other guests with a rather stupid, inane expression, and because his role on the whole is to be so insignificant—just because of that, he helps to define the character of the group. Just because he says nothing, he has a negative effect and produces a faint, pervasive note of gloom in the room, which causes the other guests to speak just so loud and not louder. Am I not right? In this way, that person can literally become the most powerful member of the group. As I’ve said, I’m not a good judge of people, and yet I often find it amusing to notice the tremendous value trifles can sometimes have. Thus, I once witnessed how a total stranger, a poor engineer who absolutely refused to open his mouth ... But that’s another story and has nothing to do with this one, except insofar as they have both passed through my brain and left their traces. However, to pursue the matter in hand, who knows whether your silence this evening hasn’t given my words their special tone—with all due respect to my excessive intoxication—whether the expression of your face at this moment, that half wary, half innocent look in your eyes, doesn’t stimulate me to speak precisely the way I do! It’s quite natural. You listen to what I say—what a drunk man says—and somehow or other you feel smitten now and then, to employ a word I’ve already used; I feel tempted to go even further and throw another dozen words in your face. I refer to this simply as an example of the value of trifles. Don’t disregard trifles, my dear friend! Trifles have an enormous value, for Christ’s sake—. Come in!”"
"I Nagels hjerne oppstod det den ene lystige bitterhet efter den andre. Han reiste seg og gikk mismodig og opphisset hjem. Nei han fikk bestandig rett, det var bare lus og gammelost og Luthers katekismus overalt. Og menneskene var middelshøye borgere i tre etasjes hytter; de åt og drakk til nødtørft, koset seg med toddy og valgpolitikk og handlet dag ut og dag inn med grønnsåpe og messingkammer og fisk. Men om nettene når det tordnet da lå de og leste av bare angst i Johan Arendt. Ja skaff oss en eneste ordentlig unntagelse, se om det lar seg gjøre! Gi oss hit for eksempel en utviklet forbrytelse, en fremragende synd! Men ikke den latterlige og borgerlige ABC-villfarelse, nei den sjeldne og hårreisende utskeielse, den delikate ryggesløshet, kongesynden, full av helvedes rå herlighet. Nei det var smått det hele. Hva synes De om valgene, min herre? Jeg har den største frykt for Buskerud ….","In Nagel's brain, one merry bitterness after another arose. He got up and went home discouraged and agitated. No, he was always right, it was just lice and old cheese and Luther's catechism everywhere. And the people were middle-class citizens in three-story cottages; they ate and drank to distress, enjoyed toddy and election politics and shopped day in and day out with green soap and brass chamber and fish. But at night when it thundered then they lay and read only anxiety in Johan Arendt. Yes, get us one real exception, see if it is possible! Give us here, for example, a developed crime, an outstanding sin! But not the ridiculous and bourgeois ABC delusion, no the rare and hair-raising extravagance, the delicate backlessness, the royal sin, full of the raw glory of hell. No, it was all small. What do you think of the elections, my lord? I have the biggest fear for Buskerud….","Nagel’s mind produced one bitter sally after another. He got up, angry and despondent, and headed back toward the hotel. He was right, after all; there was nothing but lice, peasant cheese, and Luther’s catechism. And the people were middle-sized burghers living in three-story houses, eating and drinking to survive, filling their leisure with alcohol and politics, earning their living from laundry soap, metal combs, and fish. And at night when there was thunder and lightning, they lay abed trembling and read Johann Arndt. I’d like someone to find me a single exception—if there is one! For instance, I’d like to see a carefully planned crime, something to make one sit up and take notice! But none of your ridiculous minor trans gressions! It would have to be an extraordinarily vicious and terrifying piece of villainy, a superb instance of depravity, with all the raw splendors of hell. It was all empty, useless talk. And what is your opinion of the elections, sir? Buskerud chills me to the bone …","Nagel’s brain threw off one merry piece of sarcasm after another.

Oh, give us a real exception, just one, let us see if it can be done! Give us, for example, an advanced crime, a first-rate sin!

"Nagel åndet atter friere. Jo han skulle vinne hennes tillit påny; hvorfor skulle det ikke lykkes ham?

"Men hva fan er det for snakk? skrek doktoren straks. Skal det ikke være moral i tingene? Når folk hørte at det ikke var moral i tingene, hvormange var det da som torde bite på dem? Man måtte narre og fuske folk frem i utvikling og man måtte stadig holde moralen i ære. Doktoren holdt meget på Parnell; men når Gladstone fant ham umulig så måtte man vel kanskje innrømme at den mann forstod seg litt på det. Ja han ville naturligvis unnta hr. Nagel, sin ærede vert, som ikke engang kunne tilgi at Gladstone hadde rent mel i posen. Hahaha, å du gode gud! …. Apropos, hr. Nagel, De har jo ikke stort tilovers for Tolstoj heller? Jeg hørte av frøken Kielland at De også hadde Deres betenkeligheter ved å anerkjenne ham.","But what the hell is that for? the doctor shouted immediately. Shouldn't there be morality in things? When people heard that there was no morality in things, how many dared to bite them? One had to fool and cheat people forward in development and one had to constantly keep morale in honor. The doctor liked Parnell a lot; but when Gladstone found him impossible, one might have to admit that the man understood it a little. Yes, of course he wanted to exempt Mr. Nagel, his esteemed host, who could not even forgive that Gladstone had pure flour in the bag. Hahaha, oh you good god! …. Speaking of which, hr. Nagel, you do not have much left for Tolstoy either? I heard from Miss Kielland that you also had your reservations about acknowledging him.","“But you’re talking like a damned fool!” the doctor cried. “Are you against ethics in Parliament? If the voters felt that there was no morality in parliaments, how many do you think would go along?” You had to fool and cajole people by continuously waving the standard of morality and all that. Dr. Stenersen had a high opinion of Parnell, but if Gladstone was so opposed to him, he must know what he was about—with apologies to the host, Mr. Nagel, who couldn’t forgive Gladstone for being an honorable man. “By the way, Mr. Nagel, you don’t seem to have a very high opinion of Tolstoy either? Miss Kielland mentioned that you had some reservations about him.”","“How can you talk such damn nonsense?” the doctor yelled instantly. “Mustn’t there be morality in things?” If people heard there was no morality in things, how many would dare rise to the bait? You had to trick and fool people to make them progress, and you constantly had to honor morality. The doctor strongly supported Parnell, but if Gladstone found him to be impossible, it was only fair to assume that he knew what he was doing. Of course, he would make an exception of Mr. Nagel, his honorable host, who couldn’t even forgive Gladstone his clear conscience. “Ha-ha-ha, good Lord! ... By the way, Mr. Nagel, you aren’t very fond of Tolstoy either, are you? I was told by Miss Kielland that you also had some scruples about recognizing him.”"

"Men det er dog en påfallende oppriktighet De alltid legger for dagen overfor meg, sa hun uten å svare på hans spørsmål. Jeg vet ikke hva den skal tjene til. Deres anskuelser er noe usedvanlige av seg; nu sist lar De meg ane at egentlig er altsammen bare humbug, intet er edelt, intet rent, intet stort; er det Deres mening?

Your opinions are rather unorthodox. Now you are trying to make me believe that everything is false; that there is no such thing as nobility, purity, magnanimity. Is that the way you really feel?

"Nei man skal ta seg ivare for det slags. Min sønn, vokt deg for kvinnegunst, sier en stor forfatter, – eller hva det nu er en stor forfatter sier. Karlsen var en svak mann, en idealist som gikk i døden for sine store følelser, det vil si for sine tynne nerver, hva igjen vil si for mangel på kraftig kost og utearbeide …. hehe, og utearbeide. «Gid ditt stål var så skarpt som ditt siste nei!» Han spolerte hele sitt jordiske eftermæle med et sitat av en dikter. Jeg setter at jeg hadde truffet Karlsen i betimelig tid, gjerne hans siste dag, men dog en halv time før katastrofen, og han da hadde fortalt meg at han ville sitere noen i sin dødsstund, så hadde jeg kommet til å si som så: Se på meg, jeg har mine fem, jeg er på menneskehetens vegne interessert i at De ikke søler til Deres siste stund med et sitat av en eller annen stor dikter. Vet De hva en stor dikter er? Jo en stor dikter er et menneske som ikke skammer seg, som virkelig ikke blues. Andre narrer har øyeblikk da de skamrødmer for seg selv i enrom; men den store dikter ikke. Se på meg igjen: vil De sitere noen så siter en geograf og utlever Dem ikke. Victor Hugo – har De sans for det komiske? Baron Lesdain talte en dag med Victor Hugo. I samtalens løp spurte den intrikate baron Lesdain: Hvem er efter Deres mening Frankrikes største dikter? – Victor Hugo gren og bet seg i leppen og sa endelig: Alfred de Musset er den neststørste! Hehehe. Men De har kanskje ikke sans for det komiske? Vet De hva Victor Hugo gjorde i 1870? Han skrev en proklamasjon til jordens beboere hvori han på det strengeste forbydde de tyske tropper å beleire og bombardere Paris. Jeg har både dattersønner og annen familie her, jeg ønsker ikke å se dem rammet av granater, sa Victor Hugo.","No, you have to take care of that kind of thing. My son, beware of women's favor, says a great writer, - or whatever a great writer says. Karlsen was a weak man, an idealist who died in his great emotions, that is, for his thin nerves, which in turn means for lack of strong diet and outdoor work…. hehe, and work out. ""I wish your steel was as sharp as your last no!"" He spoiled his entire earthly legacy with a quote from a poet. I assume that I had met Karlsen in time, preferably his last day, but still half an hour before the disaster, and he had then told me that he would quote someone at the time of his death, so I had come to say as follows: See on me, I have my five, I'm on behalf of humanity interested that you do not spill to your last moment with a quote by some great poet. Do you know what a great poet is? After all, a great poet is a man who is not ashamed, who really does not blues. Other fools have moments when they blush for themselves in private; but the great poet does not. Look at me again: if you want to quote someone, quote a geographer and do not extradite you. Victor Hugo - do you have a sense of comedy? Baron Lesdain spoke one day with Victor Hugo. During the conversation, the intricate baron Lesdain asked: Who do you think is France's greatest poet? - Victor Hugo branched and bit his lip and finally said: Alfred de Musset is the second biggest! Hehehe. But you may not have a sense of the comic? Do you know what Victor Hugo did in 1870? He wrote a proclamation to the inhabitants of the earth in which he strictly forbade the German troops to besiege and bombard Paris. I have both grandchildren and another family here, I do not want to see them hit by grenades, said Victor Hugo.","No, one has to steer clear of that type. A great writer says: “My son, when a woman offers you her favors, beware,”—or whatever it is a great writer says. Karlsen was a weakling, an idealist who died because of his violent emotions; that is to say, because of his shattered nerves, which in turn is to say because of improper diet and lack of outdoor exercise. “Would that thy knife were as sharp as thy final no!” He spoiled his posthumous fame by quoting a poet! Let’s suppose that I had met Karlsen in time—the last day, or even half an hour before the tragedy—and he had told me that he would quote someone in his dying moments; I would probably have said: Look at me, I’m a sane and sensible man, and I ask you for the sake of mankind not to ruin your last hour by quoting a so-called great poet. Do you know what constitutes a great poet? He is a person without shame, incapable of blushing. Ordinary fools have moments when they go off by themselves and blush with shame; not so the great poet. Look at me again. If you really have to quote someone, quote a geographer; that way you won’t give yourself away. Victor Hugo—do you like a good laugh? One day Baron Lesdain was talking to Victor Hugo. During the course of the conversation, the crafty baron asked: “Who, in your opinion, is the greatest French poet?” Victor Hugo smiled, bit his lip, and after a moment ’s reflection said: “Alfred de Musset is the second greatest.” But maybe you don’t get the joke? Do you know what Victor Hugo did in 1870? He wrote a proclamation addressed to the people of this planet in which he strictly forbade the German troops to besiege and bombard Paris. “I have grandsons and other members of my family here, and I don’t want them to be hit by shells,” he said.","No, one has to watch out for that sort of thing. “My son, beware of women’s favor,” says a great writer—or whatever it is that a great writer says. Karlsen was a weakling, an idealist who died because of his strong feelings, that is to say, because of his weak nerves, which again is to say, because of the lack of a nourishing diet and outdoor work—heh-heh—and outdoor work. “May your steel be as sharp as your final no!” He ruined his entire earthly reputation by a quotation from a poet.8 If I had met Karlsen in time, on his last day as lief as any, but still half an hour before the disaster, and he’d told me that he would quote someone when he was dying, I would’ve said something like this: Look at me! As someone of sound mind, I’m concerned on behalf of humankind that you do not blacken your last moments by quoting some great poet or other. Do you know what a great poet is? Why, a great poet is a person without shame, someone who never blushes.9 Other fools have moments when they blush with shame by themselves, in private; not the great poet. Look at me again: if you want to quote someone, quote a geographer and don’t give yourself away. Victor Hugo—do you have a sense of humor? One day Baron Lesdain was talking to Victor Hugo. In the course of the conversation the artful baron asked, “Who, in your opinion, is the greatest French poet?” Victor Hugo made a face, bit his lip and finally said, “Alfred de Musset is the second greatest!” Heh-heh-heh. But perhaps you don’t have a sense of humor?10 Do you know what Victor Hugo did in 1870? He wrote a proclamation addressed to the inhabitants of the earth in which, in the strictest possible terms, he forbade the German troops to besiege and bombard Paris. “I have grandsons as well as other family here, and I don’t want them to be hit by shells,” said Victor Hugo.11"

"Nei! ropte Nagel med høy røst. Han gestikulerte og forsvarte Bjørnson med heftige ord: Man kunne ikke sammenligne Bjørnson og Tolstoj med hverandre, dels fordi det måtte stride mot enhvers likefremme agronomiske fornuft, dels fordi ens menneske måtte sette seg derimot. For det første var Bjørnson et geni likesom Tolstoj. Nagel satte ikke de ganske almindelige store og ordinære genier høyt – det skulle Gud vite at han ikke gjorde –, men til deres høyde hadde Tolstoj hevet seg, hvorimot Bjørnson gikk dem langt forbi. Dette hindret naturligvis ikke at Tolstoj kunne gjøre bøker som var bedre enn mange av Bjørnsons; men hva beviste det? Gode bøker kunne jo endog danske kapteiner, norske malere og engelske koner gjøre. For det annet var Bjørnson et menneske, en overveldende personlighet, intet begrep. Han støyer som et levende legeme på vår klode og trenger førti alburom. Han sitter ikke sfinks for folk og gjør seg stor og mystisk som Tolstoj på sin steppe eller Ibsen i sin kafé. Bjørnsons indre er som en skog i storm, han strider, er på ferde overalt og skader herligen sine affærer hos publikum på Grand. Han er anlagt en masse, han er en bydende ånd, en av de få befalere. Han kan stå på en tribune og stanse en begynnende pipning med en håndbevegelse. Han har en hjerne som det uavlatelig spirer og myldrer i; han seirer kraftig og feiler grovelig, men begge deler gjør han med personlighet og ånd. Bjørnson er vår eneste dikter med inspirasjon, med gudegnisten. Den begynner i ham som en susen i kornet sommerdag, og det ender med at intet, intet høres uten den, uten den; således er hans sjels bevegelsesform tilspranget – geniets bevegelsesform. Sammenlignet med Bjørnsons er for eksempel Ibsens diktning det rene mekaniske kontorarbeide. Ibsens vers består i høy grad i at rim treffer rim så det smeller; de fleste av hans skuespill er dramatisert tremasse. Hvor fan ville man hen …. Nå, la det nu forresten være godt; skål for det hele ….","No! shouted Nagel in a loud voice. He gesticulated and defended Bjørnson with harsh words: One could not compare Bjørnson and Tolstoj with each other, partly because it had to be contrary to everyone's straightforward agronomic reason, partly because one's human being had to oppose it. First, Bjørnson was a genius like Tolstoy. Nagel did not value the fairly ordinary great and ordinary geniuses - God would know that he did not - but to their height Tolstoy had risen, whereas Bjørnson went far past them. This, of course, did not prevent Tolstoy from making books that were better than many of Bjørnson's; but what did it prove? Even Danish captains, Norwegian painters and English wives could make good books. Secondly, Bjørnson was a human being, an overwhelming personality, no concept. He makes a noise like a living body on our planet and needs forty album rooms. He does not sit sphinx for people and makes himself big and mysterious like Tolstoj on his steppe or Ibsen in his café. Bjørnson's interior is like a forest in a storm, he fights, is on the move everywhere and gloriously damages his affairs with the audience at the Grand. He is a multitude, he is a compelling spirit, one of the few commanders. He can stand on a stand and stop an incipient beep with a hand gesture. He has a brain in which it incessantly sprouts and abounds; he triumphs greatly and fails miserably, but he does both with personality and spirit. Bjørnson is our only poet with inspiration, with the god spark. It begins in him like a hiss in the grainy summer day, and it ends with nothing, nothing being heard without it, without it; thus the movement form of his soul has sprung up - the movement form of the genius. Compared to Bjørnson's, for example, Ibsen's poetry is purely mechanical office work. Ibsen's verse largely consists of rhyming hitting rhymes so that it slams; most of his plays are dramatized wood pulp. Where the hell would you go…. Well, by the way, let it be good by the way; toast to it all….","“No!” cried Nagel in a loud voice. He defended Bjørnson with violent words and violent gestures. Bjørnson and Tolstoy couldn’t be compared: that would go against the sound, logical thinking of an agronomist; besides, one reacted against an invidious comparison like that with all one’s instincts. In the first place, Bjørnson was at least on the same level as Tolstoy. Nagel had no regard for run-of-the-mill great, ordinary writers, so-called geniuses—God knows he didn’t. Tolstoy had risen to their level, whereas Bjørnson had far surpassed them. This didn’t mean that Tolstoy hadn’t written books that were better than many of Bjørnson’s, but what did that prove? Good books could be written just as well by Danish sea captains, Norwegian painters, English women. Secondly, Bjørnson was a human being, a great person, not just a public image. “He moves around the world making himself seen and heard, and needs a lot of elbow room. He doesn’t sit like a sphinx or a mysterious sage, like Tolstoy on his steppe or Ibsen in his café. Bjørnson’s spirit is like a forest in a storm. He’s a fighter fighting everywhere, and wrecking his reputation with the clientele of the Grand Café. He is a man of great dimensions, a man with a commanding presence, a born leader. He can stand on a platform and with a gesture of his hand put a stop to the first signs of booing from the audience. His mind teems and seethes with new ideas. Whether he wins magnificently or fails abysmally, his spirit and personality are very much a part of it … Bjørnson is our only poet with soul, with a divine spark. His inspiration begins imperceptibly like a breeze rustling in a cornfield on a summer day; and when it ends, you hear nothing, nothing but his voice. His spirit gathers momentum until his true genius bursts forth. Compared with Bjørnson, Ibsen’s poetry is hack work. Ibsen’s poetry depends on finding the perfect rhyme; most of his plays are wood pulp in drama form. What the devil’s happened to people? Oh, well, let’s drop the subject. Cheers, everybody.”","“No!” Nagel cried in a loud voice. Waving his arms, he defended Bjørnson with angry words. One just couldn’t compare Bjørnson and Tolstoy, partly because it went against everyone’s simple agronomical sense, partly because one’s basic humanity was bound to oppose it. First of all, Bjørnson was a genius23 just like Tolstoy. Nagel didn’t have a high opinion of the perfectly ordinary geniuses, those of average greatness—he should say he didn’t24—and it was to their level Tolstoy had risen, whereas Bjørnson far surpassed them. To be sure, that didn’t preclude Tolstoy from being able to write better books than many of Bjørnson’s; but what did that prove? Good books could, after all, be written even by Danish captains, Norwegian painters, and English housewives. Secondly, Bjørnson was a human being, an overmastering personality, not a mere concept. “He’s a vivid, thunderous presence on our planet and needs forty elbowrooms. He doesn’t sit there like a sphinx before the people, making himself great and mysterious,25 like Tolstoy on his steppe or Ibsen in his café. Bjørnson’s mind is like a windswept forest; he’s a fighter, always on the go, and does glorious damage to his own interests with the Grand Café clientele. Everything about him is on a grand scale; he’s a masterful spirit, one of the few commanders. He can stand on a platform and stop the first hint of booing with a wave of his hand. He has a perpetually fertile, teeming brain; he wins great victories and makes grievous mistakes, but does both with personality and spirit. Bjørnson is our only poet of inspiration, blessed with a divine spark. It begins like a rustle within him, as of grain on a summer’s day, and ends by his hearing nothing else, nothing but that; his soul lives and moves by the principle of the running start—the way of genius. Compared to the poetry of Bjørnson, that of Ibsen, for example, is simply mechanical routine. Ibsen’s verse largely consists of one rhyme hitting another with a smack; most of his plays are dramatized wood pulp. What the hell were people thinking of? ... Well, that’ll do; let’s drink to it all....”"

Og så kommer De her og skjeller meg ut for å tale for høyt.","But my God, says the clerk, I just wanted to offer you a glass of beer.

"Ja De har rett, jeg har voldt Dem megen plage …. Det er klart at når man dag efter dag en måned igjennom passer en opp, merker seg alle hans ord og alt hva han foretar seg så finner man noe galt å hake seg fast i.

Byen her er ikke stor, jeg faller noe i øynene, man snubler i meg, alle går med et øye på hver finger når jeg er i sikte; det kan ikke unngås. Og jeg er jo ikke som jeg burde være.","Yes you are right, I have caused you a lot of trouble…. It is clear that when you look after yourself day after day for a month, notice all his words and everything he does, you will find something wrong to get caught up in.

The city here is not big, I fall something in the eyes, people stumble in me, everyone walks with one eye on each finger when I am in sight; it can not be avoided. And I'm not who I should be.","After a short silence, he replied: “Yes, I know. I’ve caused you a lot of anguish. But it goes without saying that if you carefully observe a man for a month and make a point of remembering everything he says and does, you can always find something to find fault with. You may be a bit unfair in your judgment of me, but that’s not important. This is a small town. I’m rather conspicuous, and everywhere I go, people recognize me and watch my every move.","“You’re right, I’ve caused you great pain.... Obviously, when people watch you day after day for a whole month, taking note of your every word and deed, they can always find something bad to latch on to. They may even do you an injustice, though not serious enough to do much harm, I admit. This is not a big town, I catch people’s eyes, they trip over me; they keep their eyes peeled when I am within sight, there’s no avoiding it. And, of course, I’m not as I should be.”"
"Godt, la det bero for idag. Men lov meg at De ikke selger stolen til noen annen før De underretter meg om det, vil De det? Jeg slipper den ikke så vidt De vet det, selv om den blir litt dyrere enda.

But promise me you'll not sell the chair to anyone else until you let me know, will you? I will not release it as far as you know, although it will be a little more expensive even. Anyway, I'm willing to pay as much as anyone else, and I'd come first.","All right. We’ll let it go for the moment. But will you promise not to sell that chair to anyone else without letting me know? Because I won’t let it go, even if the price goes up a bit. At any rate, I’m willing to match anyone else’s price, and remember, I was first!”","Since her stubbornness resisted all appeals, to save face he finally said, “All right, we’ll let the matter rest for now. But promise me that you won’t sell the chair to anyone else without informing me, will you? I won’t give it up, just so you know, even if I should have to pay some more.

He was not mistaken, there was no one else in town who wore such a yellow spring coat; it was really his, he also remembered exactly where he had hung it.

"Jeg må forøvrig be Dem om unnskyldning for at jeg idelig skifter samtaleemne. Disse mange og plutselige sprang i min tankegang kommer visstnok for endel av at jeg nu er så bedrøvelig full, men for endel er det også i det hele tatt en feil ved meg. Saken er: jeg er bare en simpel agronom, en elev fra et kuskittakademi, jeg er en tenker som ikke har lært å tenke. Nå, la oss ikke komme inn på så spesielle ting, de interesserer Dem ikke, og for meg som kjenner mine forhold før er de likefrem motbydelige. Vet De hva, det går ofte så vidt når jeg sitter her alene og tenker på mangehånde ting og jeg så føler meg selv efter i sømmene, da hender det ofte at jeg kaller meg Rochefort med høy røst og at jeg slår meg på knappen og kaller meg Rochefort. Hva vil De si når jeg forteller Dem at jeg engang bestilte et signet med et pinnsvin i? …. Dette bringer meg til å huske på en mann som jeg i sin tid kjente som en skikkelig og ganske almindelig og aktverdig filologisk studerende ved et tysk universitet. Mannen utartet, i løpet av to år ble han både drukkenbolt og romanforfatter. Traff han fremmede og man spurte ham hvem han var svarte han tilslutt bare at han var en kjensgjerning. Jeg er en kjensgjerning! sa han og knep munnen sammen av bare hovmodighet. Nå, dette interesserer Dem ikke …. De talte om en mann, en tenker som ikke hadde lært å tenke. Eller var det meg selv som talte om det? Om forlatelse, nu er jeg nemlig død drukken; men det gjør ingenting, la Dem bare ikke anfekte. Jeg ville forresten gjerne få lov til å forklare Dem dette med tenkeren som ikke kunne tenke. Såvidt jeg forstod Deres ytring ville De angripe mannen. Jo, jeg fikk virkelig det bestemte inntrykk, De talte i en hånlig tone; men den mann som De nevnte fortjener å bli sett noenlunde i sin sammenheng. For det første var han en stor narr. Jojo, det vil jeg ikke fragå, han var en narr. Han gikk alltid med et langt rødt slips og smilte av bare narraktighet. Ja så narraktig var han at han titt og ofte satt fordypet i en bok når noen kom til ham, skjønt han aldri leste. Han gikk også uten strømper i skoene bare for å ha råd til en rose i knapphullet. Slik var han. Men det beste av alt var at han hadde endel portretter, portretter av noen tarvelige, nette håndverkerdøtre, og disse portretter skrev han så noen høye og klangfulle navn på, bare for at man skulle få inntrykk av at han hadde så og så fornemme bekjentskaper. På et av billedene hadde han skrevet med tydelige bokstaver «Frøken Stang» for at man skulle tro hun var i slekt med statsministeren, skjønt mennesket i det allerhøyeste kunne hete Lie eller Haug. Hehehe, hva skal man si til slikt blæreri? Han innbilte seg at folk gikk og beskjeftiget seg med ham, baktalte ham. Folk baktaler meg! sa han. Hehehe, tror De virkelig at noen gadd baktale ham? Så var det altså en dag han kom inn i en juvelerbutikk, han gikk og røkte på to cigarer. På to cigarer! En bar han i hånden og den andre i munnen, men det var ild i dem begge. Han visste kanskje ikke at han hadde to cigarer i bruk på én gang, og som en tenker som ikke hadde lært å tenke spurte han heller ikke ….","By the way, I have to apologize to you for constantly changing the subject of conversation. These many and sudden leaps in my thinking are supposed to come partly because I am now so sadly drunk, but partly because I am also at all wrong. The thing is: I'm just a simple agronomist, a student from a couscous academy, I'm a thinker who has not learned to think. Now, let's not get into such special things, they do not interest you, and to me who know my relationships before, they are downright disgusting. You know what, it often goes so far when I sit here alone and think of many things and I then feel myself in the seams, then it often happens that I call myself Rochefort with a loud voice and that I hit the button and call meg Rochefort. What will you say when I tell you that I once ordered a sign with a hedgehog in it? …. This brings me to remember a man whom I once knew as a proper and quite ordinary and respectable philological student at a German university. The man degenerated, in the course of two years he became both a drunkard and a novelist. If he met strangers and they asked him who he was, he finally answered only that he was a fact. I'm a fact! he said, clenching his mouth in pride. Well, this does not interest you…. They were talking about a man, a thinker who had not learned to think. Or was it myself who talked about it? About forgiveness, now I am dead drunk; but it does not matter, just do not let it affect you. By the way, I would like to be allowed to explain this to you with the thinker who could not think. As far as I understood your statement, you would attack the man. Yes, I really got the definite impression, You spoke in a scornful tone; but the man you mentioned deserves to be seen somewhat in its context. First, he was a big fool. Jojo, I do not want to deprive him, he was a fool. He always wore a long red tie and smiled with mere foolishness. Yes, he was so stupid that he looked and often sat immersed in a book when someone came to him, although he never read. He also went without socks in his shoes just to afford a rose in the buttonhole. That's how he was. But the best of all was that he had a number of portraits, portraits of some tacky, neat artisan daughters, and these portraits he wrote some loud and sonorous names on, just to give the impression that he had so and so distinguished acquaintances. In one of the pictures he had written in clear letters ""Miss Stang"" to make one think she was related to the Prime Minister, although the man could at most be called Lie or Haug. Hehehe, what to say to such blistering? He imagined that people went and dealt with him, slandered him. People slander me! he said. Hehehe, do you really think anyone bothered to slander him? So one day he came into a jewelry store, he went and smoked two cigars. On two cigars! He carried one in his hand and the other in his mouth, but there was fire in them both. He may not have known that he had two cigars in use at once, and as a thinker who had not learned to think, he did not ask either.","He poured the last drop down his throat and continued: “I’m sorry about the way I keep flitting from one thing to another. But my mind keeps wandering, partly because I’m so drunk, but also because I know there ’s something basically wrong with me. I’m just a simple agronomist—you know that—a student from a cow-dung academy. I’m a philosopher who has never learned to think. Well, let’s not go into details , they’re of no interest to you, and because they’re part of my past, I find them repugnant. Do you know, it often gets to the point where I sit down here trying to come to terms with myself and then suddenly call myself Rochefort in a loud voice? I tap myself on the head and call myself Rochefort! Do you know once I actually ordered a signet ring with a hedgehog engraved on it? … That reminds me of a man I once knew—he was a respectable man, a philology student at a German university; nothing at all unusual about him. But he began to go to pieces; in two years he became an alcoholic, and a novelist to boot! When he met people who tried to ask him about himself, he merely answered that he was a fact. ‘I’m a fact!’ he would exclaim, his mouth drawn tight in arrogance. Well, this doesn’t concern you. You mentioned a philosopher who had never learned to think—or was it I who was talking about him? I’m sorry— by now I’m really drunk, but so what? Don’t let that bother you. But I’d like to explain about the philosopher who couldn’t think. If I understood you correctly, you wanted to attack the man. Your reaction was so violent that I really got that impression; you spoke of him so scornfully. But that man deserves to be judged more objectively. In the first place, he was crazy—I still insist he was crazy. He always wore a long, red tie and smiled his stupid smile. In fact, he was such a fool that he always had his nose buried in a book when anyone approached him, though he never read. And another thing: he never wore any socks, so he could afford a rose for his buttonhole. That’s the way he was. But the best part of all was that he had a collection of photographs of simple though decent-looking working-class girls on which he inscribed fancy-sounding names, to give the impression that he was moving in important circles. On one of the photos he had written ‘Miss Stang,’ to suggest that she was related to the prime minister, though the girl’s family name was probably only a Lie, or a Haug at the most. He he! What do you make of such phoniness! He imagined that people were talking about him behind his back—maligning him, he said. He he, do you think that anyone would ever even bother? Then one day he walked into a jewelry shop smoking two cigars—two cigars! He had one in his hand and one in his mouth; both were lit. Perhaps he wasn’t aware that he had two cigars going at one time, but since he was a thinker who hadn’t learned to think, he didn’t ask why …”","“By the way, I apologize for constantly changing the subject. Partly, I suppose, all these sudden jumps in my thinking are due to my being roaring drunk, but partly also to a general fault of mine. The fact is, I’m only a simple agronomist, a student from a cow-dung academy; I’m a thinker who never learned how to think. Well, let’s not go into these special matters; they are of no interest to you, and to me they are downright repugnant, since I’m already aware of my situation. You know, when I sit here alone thinking about different things, taking a long, hard look at myself, it often gets to a point— well, it often happens that I call myself Rochefort in a loud voice, tap my noodle and call myself Rochefort! What will you say if I tell you that I once ordered a seal with a hedgehog on it? ... That reminds me of a man I knew at one time as a decent and quite ordinary and respectable student of philology at a German university. The man became a degenerate—two years sufficed to make him both a drunkard and a novelist. If he met strangers and was asked who he was, in the end he merely replied that he was a fact. ‘I’m a fact!’ he said, pursing his lips in sheer arrogance. Oh well, this is of no interest to you.... You mentioned a man, a thinker, who had never learned how to think. Or was it I who brought that up? I’m sorry ; you see, I’m dead drunk. But that’s all right, don’t worry. However, I would very much like to explain to you this matter of the thinker who couldn’t think. If I understood you correctly, you wanted to attack the man. Oh yes, I definitely had that impression, you spoke in a scornful tone of voice; but the man you mentioned deserves to be seen more or less in perspective. First of all, he was a big fool. No, no, that I won’t take back, he was a fool. He always wore a long red tie and smiled out of pure vanity. In fact, he was so vain that time and again he would be buried in a book when someone came to see him, though he never read anything. Also, he never wore any socks, just so he could afford a rose in his buttonhole. That’s the way he was. But best of all, he had a number of portraits, the portraits of some modest but nice-looking artisan’s daughters, on which he had inscribed grand, high-sounding names to give the impression that he had such and such genteel acquaintances. On one of the pictures he had written, in clear letters, ‘Miss Stang,’ to make you believe she was related to the prime minister, though the girl’s name might be Lie or Haug, at the most. Heh-heh-heh, what can one say to such conceit? He imagined that people were occupying themselves with him, slandering him. ‘People are slandering me!’ he said. Heh-heh-heh, do you really believe that anyone would take the trouble to slander him? Then one day he walked into a jewelry store smoking two cigars! Two cigars! He had one in his hand, the other in his mouth, and both were lighted. Maybe he didn’t know he was sporting two cigars at once, and being a thinker who hadn’t learned how to think, he didn’t ask any questions—”"
"Og ung Øien spør: Men De vil jo dog selv sette Hans Eminense toppmålet på sin plass, De beundrer jo dog erkeånden som heller ikke selv har kjempet seg til sitt geni?","And young Øien asks: But you still want to put Hans Eminense's top goal in its place, do you still admire the arch-spirit who has not even fought for his genius?",Young Øien comments: “ But you yourself wish to see a paragon at the very top; you admire the supermind that didn’t achieve its genius through struggle.”,"Young Øien remarks, But you yourself want to put His Eminence Excess in his rightful place; you do, after all, admire the arch-spirit, who didn’t fight his way to genius by himself, either!"

"Nei, naturligvis …. Gud, for en makt De har! Jeg kan forstå at man kan drives til alt mulig for Deres skyld. Selv nu da De sa disse siste ord som jo ikke var så gledelige, selv nu var Deres røst som en sang. Det var formelig som om det begynte å blomstre innen i meg. Hvor det er underlig! Vet De at jeg har vandret om utenfor Deres hjem om nettene for om mulig å få se et glimt av Dem i et vindu, at jeg har ligget på kne her i skogen og bedt til Gud for Dem, jeg som ikke engang tror videre på Gud? Ser De det aspetre der? Jeg har valgt å stanse nettopp her nu fordi nettopp ved den asp har jeg ligget flere netter på kne, oppløst i fortvilelse, dum og fortapt, bare fordi De aldri kom meg ut av tankene mere.

I can understand that one can be driven to anything for your sake. Even now when you said these last words which were not so joyful, even now your voice was like a song. It was as if it was beginning to blossom within me. How strange! Do you know that I have wandered outside your home at night to see, if possible, a glimpse of you in a window, that I have been kneeling here in the woods and praying to God for you, I who do not even believe in God ? Do you see the aspeter there? I have chosen to stop right here now because precisely at that aspen I have been on my knees for several nights, dissolved in despair, stupid and lost, just because you never got me out of my mind again. From here I have said good night to you every night, I have been lying and asking the wind and the stars to greet you and I think you must have felt it icy.","God, what power you have over people! I can understand why a man can go mad over you. Even now as you spoke these unencouraging words, your voice was music. It thrilled me to the very core of my being. How strange it is. Do you known that I’ve been pacing up and down in front of your house at night, hoping to catch a glimpse of you at a window; that I’ve been kneeling here in the woods, praying to God for you, I with my feeble faith? Do you see that aspen? I had to stop at this spot now because of the many nights I have knelt under that tree, lost in frenzy and filled with silent despair, utterly dejected because I couldn’t get you out of my mind. In this spot I’ve said good night to you every evening. I’ve knelt and begged the wind and the stars to bring you my message, and I’m sure you must have sensed it in your sleep.”","“Yes, of course.... God, what power you have! I can well understand how a man might be driven to any extremity for your sake. Even now, as you uttered those last words, which weren’t so pleasant after all, even now your voice was like a song.

"Jo det var i bankens trapp og det var litt is på trinnene. Nu stiger jeg opp med en temmelig tung sekk. Da jeg var kommet vel midtveis ser jeg høyt oppe i trappen konsul Andresen som nettopp kommer ned. Jeg vil da vende om og gå ned igjen for at konsulen kan komme frem; han sa ikke at jeg skulle gjøre det, men det falt av seg selv og jeg ville også ha gjort det uoppfordret; men i det samme var jeg så uheldig å gli på trinnet og falle. Jeg kom ned på høyre aksel. Hvorledes er det med Dem? sier så konsulen til meg, De skriker ikke, De har altså ikke slått Dem? Nei, svarer jeg, jeg var litt heldig enda! Men det varte ikke fem minutter før jeg besvimte to ganger i trekk; dessuten hovnet jeg opp i underlivet på grunn av mitt gamle tilfelle. Konsulen betenkte meg forresten rikelig bakefter skjønt han ingen skyld hadde.","Yes it was in the bank stairs and there was some ice on the steps. Now I get up with a pretty heavy bag. When I had come well in the middle, I see high up in the stairs Consul Andresen who is just coming down. I will then turn around and go down again so that the consul can come forward; he did not say that I should do it, but it fell by itself and I would also have done it unsolicited; but at the same time I was so unlucky to slip on the step and fall. I came down on the right shaft. How are you? then the consul says to me, You do not shout, so you have not beaten you? No, I answer, I was a little lucky yet! But it did not take five minutes before I fainted twice in a row; moreover, I swelled up in the abdomen because of my old case. By the way, the consul thought of me a lot afterwards, although he had no guilt.","“It was on the steps of the bank. They were a bit icy. I started climbing them carrying a sack that was very heavy. When I had gotten about half way up, I noticed that Consul Andresen was on his way down. I wanted to turn around and go down so that he could get by. He told me not to, but it was the right thing to do and I did it without being asked. But unfortunately I slipped on the steps and landed on my right shoulder. ‘What’s the matter?’ the consul asked. ‘You haven’t hurt yourself, have you?’ ‘No,’ I said. ‘I guess I was lucky.’ But five minutes later I fainted twice in a row. I began to swell where I had been hurt before. By the way, the consul was most kind to me afterwards, although it hadn’t been his fault.”","“Well, it was on the steps of the bank, they were a bit icy. I’m coming up with a rather heavy sack. About halfway, I see Consul Andresen coming down high up. I want to turn around and go back down so the Consul can get by. He didn’t tell me to, it just came naturally and I would’ve done it regardless. But at that very moment I was unlucky enough to slip on the step and fall. I landed on my right shoulder.2 ‘How are you doing?’ the Consul asks, ‘you didn’t scream, so you haven’t hurt yourself, have you?’ ‘No,’ I reply, ‘I guess I was lucky.’ But less than five minutes later I fainted twice in a row; besides, my abdomen swelled up because of my old ailment. By the way, the Consul remembered me generously afterward, though he was in no way to blame.”"

Så den tredje morgen just som Nagel kom ut av sitt værelse ble han tiltalt av verten som hilste på ham og sa noen elskverdige ord. De drev ut på verandaen og satte seg begge to og verten fant på å gjøre ham et spørsmål angående forsendelsen av en kasse fersk fisk:,So the third morning just as Nagel came out of his room he was approached by the host who greeted him and said some kind words. They drifted out onto the porch and both sat down and the host decided to ask him a question regarding the shipment of a box of fresh fish:,"On the third morning, as Nagel was leaving his room, he ran into the hotelkeeper, who greeted him with a few pleasant remarks. They went out on the veranda and sat down; by way of making conversation, the hotelkeeper asked him about the shipment of a crate of fresh fish.","Then, just as Nagel came out of his room the third morning, he was accosted by the hotel keeper, who greeted him and said a few amiable words. They went out on the veranda and sat down."
"Ja, svarte hun, det var han kanskje. Men det får ikke hjelpe.","Yes, she replied, maybe he was. But that does not help.","“Well, perhaps he was,” she said, “but it can’t be helped.” “No, that’s right, it can’t be helped.","“Yes, maybe he was,” she replied. “But it can’t be helped.”"
"Ja det ville han spørre om efter at jeg endog hadde forklart ham min mening! Hehe, således ville det forme seg for ham. Nå, men jeg ville allikevel svare ham igjen det beste jeg formådde, jeg ville komme i ess og svare: Det er altså simpelthen en legion store menn; hører De nu hva jeg sier? Det er en legion av dem! Men av de største menn er det ikke, nei ikke mange. Se, det er forskjellen. Det blir snart en stor mann i hver kommune; men av de største menn kommer det kanskje aldri til å bli én i hvert årtusen. Ved stor mann forstår verden ganske simpelt et talent, et geni, og herregud, geni er et meget demokratisk begrep: så mange pund biff å ete hver dag gir geni i tredje, fjerde, femte, tiende ledd. Geniet i populær betydning er ikke det uhørte, et geni er bare et menneskelig apropos; man stanser ved det, men man steiler ikke for det. Tenk Dem: De står en stjerneklar aften i et observatorium og ser gjennom kikkert på Oriontåken. Så hører De at Fearnley sier: Godaften, godaften! De ser Dem om, Fearnley bøyer seg dypt, en stor mann er kommet inn døren, et geni, herren fra snipplosjen. Og ikke sant, da smiler De litt ved Dem selv og vender Dem igjen til Oriontåken? Dette har hendt meg …. Har De forstått min mening? Jeg vil si: heller enn å beundre de almindelige store menn som får menneskebarna til å dytte hverandre i siden av ærefrykt foretrekker jeg de små ubekjente genier, ynglinger som dør i skoledagene fordi deres sjel sprenger dem, fine, blendende sankthansormer som man må ha truffet mens de var ilive for å vite at de var til. Slik er min smak. Men fremfor alt sier jeg: det gjelder å skjelne det høyeste fra det høye geni, å holde det høyeste oppe så det ikke drukner i genienes proletariat. Jeg vil se den uhørte erkeånd på sin plass; gjør dog et utvalg, få meg til å rygge, skaff meg av med kommunegeniene, det gjelder å finne det toppmålte, Hans Eminense toppmålet ….","Yes he would ask after I even explained my opinion to him! Hehe, that's how it would be for him. Now, but I would still answer him again the best I could, I would come in ace and answer: So it is simply a legion of great men; Do you now hear what I say? It's a legion of them! But of the greatest men it is not, no not many. See, that's the difference. There will soon be a big man in every municipality; but of the greatest men there may never be one in every millennium. By big man, the world quite simply understands a talent, a genius, and oh my god, genius is a very democratic concept: so many pounds of beef to eat every day gives genius in the third, fourth, fifth, tenth paragraph. The genius in the popular sense is not the unheard of, a genius is just a human apropos; you stop at it, but you do not steal for it. Imagine: They are standing in a starry night in an observatory, looking through binoculars at the Orion Nebula. Then you hear Fearnley say: Good evening, good evening! They look at you, Fearnley bends deeply, a big man has come in the door, a genius, the lord of the snippet lodge. And right, then you smile a little at yourself and turn back to the Orion Nebula? This has happened to me…. Have you understood my opinion? I want to say: rather than admiring the ordinary big men who make human children push each other in the side of awe, I prefer the little unknown geniuses, young people who die in the school days because their souls blow them up, nice, dazzling Sankthan snakes that one must have met while they were ilive to know that they existed. Such is my taste. But above all I say: it is a matter of distinguishing the highest from the high genius, of keeping the highest up so that it does not drown in the proletariat of geniuses. I want to see the unheard of arch-spirit in its place; however, make a selection, make me back off, get rid of the municipal geniuses, it's about finding the top goal, Hans Eminense top goal….","Unable to grasp what I’m saying, he would keep on questioning me. And again I would try to explain. I’d get into the spirit of things and answer him: “On the contrary, there are hordes of great men, do you hear? Hordes of them! But of the very great there aren’t many. That’s the point. The day will come when every village will produce a great man; but a very great one we may see only once in a thousand years. What the world understands by a great man is simply someone with talent, someone who excels in something—good God, genius is a democratic conception! An X number of pounds of beef a day will produce a genius in the third, fourth, fifth, tenth generation. Genius in the popular sense has become common. Imagine being in an observatory on a clear night looking through a telescope at the Orion constellation. Then Fearnley the astronomer says good evening. You turn; Fearnley makes a deep bow. A great man has just come in, a genius, the gentleman from the theater box. Don’t you then smile to yourself and once again focus your attention on the Orion constellation? I once had this experience. Do you understand what I’m trying to say? Rather than admire the mediocre great men over whom passers-by nudge each other in awe, I venerate the young, unknown geniuses who die in their teens, their souls shattered—delicate, phosphorescent glowworms that one must see to know they really did exist. That’s how I feel. What I’m trying to say is, we have to distinguish the greatest from the merely great, so they won’t sink down into the proletariat of geniuses. I want to see the super-mind in its proper place; weed out carefully, for God’s sake; get rid of the village geniuses. We have to find His Eminence the Paragon.”","Yes, that’s what he would ask, even after I’d explained what I meant! Heh-heh, that’s how it would look to him. Well, I would still answer him as best I could; feeling in my element , I would say, There is simply a legion of great men. Do you hear what I’m saying? There is a legion of them! But of the greatest men there aren’t, no, there aren’t many. That’s the difference, you see. Soon there will be a great man in every village, but of the greatest men there will probably never be one even in a thousand years. What the world means by a great man is quite simply a talent, a genius, and genius, after all, is a very democratic concept: a diet of so many pounds of beef a day will produce genius in the third, fourth, fifth, or tenth generation. Genius in the popular sense is not the unprecedented, but merely a human apropos: it makes you stop, but not rear up. Imagine the following: You are standing in an observatory some starry night, looking through a telescope at the Orion nebula. Then you hear Fearnley say, “Good evening, good evening!” You look around, Fearnley makes a deep bow—a great man has just come in, a genius, the gentleman in the white-tie box. You smile to yourself and go back to the Orion nebula, isn’t that right? This happened to me once.... Do you understand what I mean? I’m saying that, instead of admiring the ordinary great men who make mortals nudge each other in the ribs with awe, I prefer the small, unknown geniuses, youths who die in their school days because their souls shatter them, delicate, dazzling glowworms one must have met in their lifetimes to know they really existed. That’s how I feel. But above all I say it’s important to distinguish between the highest and the high genius, to keep the highest afloat so that it doesn’t drown amid the proletariat of geniuses. I want to see the unprecedented arch-spirit in his proper place. Do make a selection, force me to sit up, get rid of all those village geniuses! We have to find what exceeds the standard, His Eminence Excess...."
"Dere er noen vidunderlig snille mennesker, sa han så. Dere vil hele tiden at jeg skal få gjøre meg gjeldende og snakke mitt lille snakk foran alle andre. Bare fordi jeg er fremmed.","You are some wonderfully kind people, he said. You always want me to assert myself and speak my little talk in front of everyone else. Just because I'm a stranger.","“You’re all terribly kind,” he said. “You keep on trying to draw me out, just because I’m a stranger.”","“You’re all very kind, wonderful people,” he went on. “You always want me to put myself forward, do my bit of chatter ahead of everybody else. Just because I’m a stranger.”17"
Nei det skulle De ikke.,"No, you should not.","“No, you shouldn’t have.”","“No, you shouldn’t.”"
Men det De sa om Tolstoj kan jo også sies om Bjørnson. De er ikke konsekvent i Deres tale ….,But what you said about Tolstoy can also be said about Bjørnson. You are not consistent in your speech….,"As he was leaving, Øien turned and remarked to Nagel: “What you said about Tolstoy also applies to Bjørnson. You’re not consistent in your arguments …”","In the doorway Øien turned to Nagel and said, “What you said about Tolstoy can also be said about Bjørnson, you know.

"Jeg forsvarte det religiøse liv i mennesket, svarte Nagel, ikke spesielt kristendommen, aldeles ikke, men overhodet det religiøse liv. De mente at alle teologer burde henges. Hvorfor? spurte jeg. Fordi deres rolle er utspilt, svarte De. Og dette var jeg ikke enig i. Det religiøse liv er et faktum. En tyrk roper: Allah er stor! Og dør for denne overbevisning; en nordmann kneler ved alteret og drikker Kristi blod den dag idag. En eller annen kubjelle har et folk å tro på, og i den tro dør det saligen. Det avgjørende er nemlig ikke hva man tror på, men hvorledes man tror på det ….","I defended the religious life of man, Nagel replied, not especially Christianity, not at all, but the religious life at all. They believed that all theologians should be hanged. Why? I asked. Because their role has been played out, you replied. And this I did not agree with. Religious life is a fact. A Turk shouts: Allah is great! And die for this conviction; a Norwegian kneels at the altar and drinks the blood of Christ to this day. Some cowbell has a people to believe in, and in that faith it dies blissfully. The decisive factor is not what you believe in, but how you believe in it….","“But I was defending the religious spirit in man,” Nagel replied, “not Christianity in particular—as a matter of fact, not Christianity at all. I was talking about spiritual life in general. You said that all theologians ought to be hanged. I asked you why, and you said they were finished. I couldn’t agree with you; religion is a fact. A Turk cries ‘Allah is great,’ and dies for his convictions; to this day, a Norwegian kneels at the altar and drinks the blood of Christ. There are even places where people believe they can attain salvation through cowbells! But what really matters is not what you believe but the faith and conviction with which you believe …”","“I defended man’s religious life,” Nagel replied, “not Christianity in particular, not at all, but the religious life in general. You were of the opinion that all theologians should be hanged. ‘Why?’ I asked. ‘Because their role has been played out,’ you replied. I didn’t agree with that. The religious life is a fact. A Turk cries, ‘Allah is great!’ and dies for this conviction; Norwegians kneel at the altar and drink Christ’s blood to this day.

"Jo, jo! sa hun med ett, kom bare med det, jeg skal nok besørge et brev fra Dem til frøken Gude. – Og da hun hadde stukket brevet i lommen nikket hun plutselig og sa: Jaja, takk for iaften. Nu må jeg gå.","Yes, yes! she said at once, just come with it, I'll probably get a letter from you to Miss God. And when she had put the letter in her pocket, she suddenly nodded and said: Well, thank you for tonight. Now I have to go.","“Yes, of course,” she said quickly. “Give it to me and I’ll see that she gets it.” When she had pocketed the letter, she nodded and said: “Well, thanks for your company. Now I have to go.”","“But certainly! ” she said of a sudden. “Just let me have it, you can trust me; Miss Gude will get your letter.” After pocketing the letter, she nodded abruptly and said, “Well, thanks for a pleasant evening. I have to go now.”"
"Nei, nei De sa det ikke. Han falt i tanker; hans øyne stirret på én plett uten å se. Nei De sa ikke at det var henne, De nevnte ikke hennes navn, vær bare rolig …. Og frøken Kielland har dog virkelig vært her, hun er kommet inn den dør der og er gått igjen den samme vei efter at hun har utrettet sitt ærend. Det var henne så meget om å gjøre at hun måtte gå ut idag, i dette vær. Hvor det er underlig! …. Kjære, gode Martha, gode sjel, jeg kneler for Dem fordi De er god! Tro meg allikevel, tro meg bare iaften, så skal jeg senere vise Dem hvor lite jeg har i sinne å bedra Dem. Ta ikke Deres løfte tilbake nu. Tenk over det ennu en gang, vil De det?

No You did not say it was her, You did not mention her name, just calm down…. And Miss Kielland has really been here though, she has come in that door there and has gone the same way again after she has done her errand. There was so much for her to do that she had to go out today, in this weather. How strange! …. Dear, good Martha, good soul, I kneel before you because you are good! Believe me anyway, just believe me tonight, and I'll show you later how little I have in mind to deceive you. Do not take back your promise now. Think about it one more time, will you? Think about it until tomorrow and let me meet you then….","“No, no, you didn’t,” he said, lost in thought, his eyes staring into space. “You didn’t say it was she; you didn’t even mention her name— you’ve got nothing to worry about. But Miss Kielland has been here. She came in through that door, and when she had accomplished what she came for, she left again the same way. Her mission was so important that she had to come out today, in this weather … Dearest Martha, I kneel before you because you are so good. Have confidence in me, just for tonight, and I’ll prove to you later that nothing was further from my mind than deceiving you. Don’t take back your promise! Will you think it over till tomorrow and let me see you then …”","“No, no, you didn’t.” He became lost in thought, his eyes staring unseeingly at one spot. “No, you didn’t say it was her, you didn’t mention her name, you may feel easy on that score.... And yet, Miss Kielland has certainly been here; she came in through that door and left the same way after accomplishing her errand. It was so important to her that she simply had to go out today, in this weather! How strange! ... Dear, kind Martha, you good soul, I kneel before you because you are good! Trust me in spite of everything, trust me just for tonight, and I’ll show you later how little I mean to deceive you. Don’t take back your promise. Think it over again, won’t you? Think it over till tomorrow and let me see you then2—”"
"For å påvirke Dem, frøken.","To influence you, miss.","Slowly, and completely in control of himself, he answered: ‘To make an impression on you, Miss Kielland.”","Slowly, in full control of himself, he replied, “To influence you, Miss Kielland.”"

"Ekte blåsyre, reneste vann! sa han. Men jeg får aldri mot; det faller meg altfor vanskelig …. Hr. doktor, De kan vel si meg om dette er nok. Jeg har allerede brukt opp den ene halvdel på et dyr og det virket utmerket. Det ble litt krampe, litt besk komikk i fjeset, to tre gisp, det var alt; matt i tre trekk.","Real hydrocyanic acid, purest water! he said. But I never get courage; it is too difficult for me…. Mr. Doctor, you can probably tell me if this is enough. I have already used up one half on an animal and it worked great. There was a little cramping, a little bitter comedy in the face, two or three gasps, that was all; matt in wood cover.","“Pure prussic acid—the purest water!” he said. “But I’ll never have the courage—I couldn’t go through with it. Doctor, is there enough? I’ve used half of it on an animal, and it worked perfectly. Some spasms, a few contortions of the muzzle, two or three gasps, and that was that.”","“Genuine Prussic acid, of the purest water!” he said. “But I’ll never have the courage; it’s just too difficult.... Doctor, you can probably tell me whether this is enough. I’ve already used half of it on an animal, and it worked perfectly. There were a few spasms, a touch of comic-sardonic mimicry, two or three gasps, that was all; checkmate in three moves.”"
"Bravo, doktor! brølte adjunkten igjen ildrød i hodet. Bravo! Men si det bitrere, si det grovt. Enhver har sin mening. En hoven betraktningsmåte, i sannhet en hoven betraktningsmåte av Dem! Jeg skal bevise det….","Bravo, Doctor! roared the assistant professor again fiery red in the head. Bravo! But say it bitterly, say it roughly. Everyone has their opinion. A swollen way of looking at it, truly a swollen way of looking at you! I have to prove it….","“Bravo, doctor!” roared Holtan, his face flushed. “Bravo! But you ought to express yourself a bit more sharply. Everyone is entitled to his own opinion. But you are being arrogant, Nagel. I can prove it!”","“Bravo, Doctor!” the teacher roared again, his face scarlet. “Bravo! But say it more bitterly, say it gruffly. Everyone has his own opinion. An arrogant view, verily an arrogant view on your part! I shall prove it—”"
"Men hva mente De egentlig med å be meg om det stevnemøte, hr. Nagel? Hva var Deres mening? Si meg nu det.","But what did you really mean by asking me for that date, sir? Nagel? What was your opinion?

"Hennes heftighet var virkelig ekte. Hun begynte å løpe surr i ham ved hans påståelighet som var så sikker, så uryggelig at den fikk henne til å vakle. Hun følte seg krenket ved således å bli snurret rundt. I sin opphisselse gikk hun og slo seg i hånden med parasollen.","Her fierceness was truly genuine. She began to buzz in him at his assertion which was so sure, so unshakable that it made her stagger. She felt offended by being spun around. In her excitement, she went and slapped her hand with the parasol.","Her anger was spontaneous and genuine. His blind, unshakable convictions so unnerved her that she momentarily lost her self-control. She was thoroughly irritated at having been shaken up like this, and showed it by thumping her parasol on the ground as she walked.","Her anger was, indeed, genuine. Her brain was starting to reel from his obstinacy, which was so cocksure, so unshakable that it made her waver. She felt insulted to have become muddled like this. In her agitation she was tapping her hand with the parasol as she walked."
"En times tid senere var Nagel allerede inne i prestegårdsskogen. Marken var ennu våt efter regnet fra om kvelden og solen var ikke meget varm. Han satte seg på en sten og holdt skarp utkikk med veien. Han hadde sett et par kjente fotspor i det bløte grus, han var nesten overbevist om at det var Dagnys fotspor og at hun var gått inn til byen. Han ventet temmelig lenge forgjeves, bestemte seg endelig til å gå henne imøte og reiste seg fra stenen.","An hour later, Nagel was already in the rectory forest. The field was still wet after the rain from the evening and the sun was not very hot. He sat down on a rock and kept a sharp eye on the road. He had seen a couple of familiar footprints in the soft gravel, he was almost convinced that it was Dagny's footprints and that she had entered the city. He waited quite a long time in vain, finally decided to go to meet her and got up from the stone.","An hour later Nagel was in the parsonage woods. The ground was still wet from the rain of the previous night, and the sun didn’t give off much warmth. He sat down on a stone, his eyes glued to the road. He had spotted some familiar footprints in the wet gravel. He was sure they were Dagny’s and that she had gone into town. He waited for a long time, but there was no sign of her, so he got up from the stone and decided to go meet her.","An hour later Nagel already found himself in the Parsonage Woods. The ground was still wet from the rain the previous evening, and the sun was not very warm. He sat down on a stone and kept a sharp lookout on the road. He had noticed some familiar footprints in the wet gravel; he was fairly sure they were Dagny’s and that she had gone into town. Having waited for quite a long time to no purpose, he decided at last to go and meet her and got up from the stone."
Nagel sa smilende:,Nail so smiling:,Nagel smiled.,"Nagel said, smiling, “I’ll be glad to jabber away."
Hun begynte selv å tale:,She began to speak herself:,"She was the first to speak: “I shall lie awake for the rest of the night, thinking.",Then she started talking: “I’ll lie awake all night thinking.
"Kjære, søte barn, som du vil! Hvor du er god! …. Nei du må ikke ligge våken inatt, du må ikke! Tenk på meg og si godnatt og sov. Du er vel ikke redd her alene?","Dear, sweet children, as you will! Where you are good! …. No, you must not be awake tonight, you must not! Think of me and say goodnight and sleep. You're not scared here alone, are you?","“Dearest child, wear anything you like! How good you are! But you mustn’t stay awake tonight! Say good night, think of me, and go to sleep. You’re not afraid to be here alone?”","“My dear sweet child,” he replied, “you decide!

"Jada, jada.","Yes, yes.","“Yes, of course.”","“All right, all right.”"
Ja.,Yes.,“Yes.” “Don’t worry.,“Yes.”
Men Hansen ville ikke bli av med sine briller og doktoren vendte seg fra ham i uvilje. Han satte seg igjen ved siden av Nagel.,But Hansen did not want to get rid of his glasses and the doctor turned away from him reluctantly. He sat down next to Nagel.,"But Hansen wouldn’t part with his glasses, and Dr. Stenersen turned away from him in utter disgust. Again he sat down next to Nagel.","But Hansen refused to part with his glasses, and the doctor turned away from him in a huff. He again took a seat beside Nagel."
"Dagny, nu er det min tur: jeg betakker meg, jeg ler deg ut, jeg håner deg; hva har du så med meg å bestille? Jeg blir aldri en stor mann ….","Dagny, now it's my turn: I consider myself, I laugh at you, I mock you; so what do you have with me to order? I'll never be a big man….","Dagny, now it’s my turn; I’m saying no to you; I’m laughing at you, sneering at you, so why don’t you let go of me? I will never join the ranks of great men …","Dagny, it’s my turn now : I decline with thanks, I laugh you to scorn, I mock you; so what do you have to do with me? I’ll never be a great man."
"Min tankegang er i korthet denne: Hva vinning er det i grunnen – unnskyld forresten hvis jeg kanskje har spurt om dette engang før – hva vinning er det i grunnen endog rent praktisk talt at man ribber livet for all poesi, all drøm, all skjønn mystikk, all løgn? Hva er sannhet, vet De det? Vi beveger oss jo frem bare gjennom symboler, og disse symboler skifter vi efterhvert som vi skrider frem. La oss forresten ikke glemme glassene.","My thinking is in short this: What a profit it is in principle - sorry by the way if I may have asked about this once before - what a profit it is in fact even practically that one ribs life for all poetry, all dream, all beautiful mystery , all lies? What is truth, do you know it? We move forward only through symbols, and we change these symbols as we progress. By the way, let's not forget the glasses.","Nagel thought for a moment and said: “It’s very simple: what are we gaining—excuse me if I’m repeating myself—what are we gaining by a pragmatism that robs our life of poetry, dreams, mysticism—are these all lies? What is truth? Can you tell me that? We can only struggle along by using symbols, and we change them as we alter our views. By the way, let’s not neglect our drinks.”","After considering a moment, Nagel said, “My way of thinking is briefly this:15 What would it profit us, after all—pardon me, by the way, if I’ve asked this before—what would it profit us, after all, even from a purely practical viewpoint, if we stripped life of all poetry, all dreams, all beautiful mysteries, all lies? What is truth, can you tell me that? You see, we only advance by way of symbols, and we change these symbols as we progress.16 However, let’s not forget our drinks.”"
"Minutten gikk dog ut fra at De var et ærlig menneske, fortsatte Nagel, og De burde ikke bedra ham.","The minute, however, assumed that you were an honest person, Nagel continued, and you should not deceive him.","“The Midget took you for an honest man,” Nagel went on, “and you mustn’t disappoint him.”","“Miniman took you for an honest man,” Nagel went on, “and you shouldn’t swindle him.”"
Så sier han:,Then he says:,Pause.,"Then he says, “And now you admire me because of this?”"
Dette spørsmål kom ham så uventet at han et øyeblikk så forvirret på henne. Han svarte dempet og med klappende hjerte:,This question came to him so unexpectedly that for a moment he looked at her confused. He replied softly and with a beating heart:,"Her words were so unexpected that for a moment he looked at her in astonishment. In a hushed voice, his heart pounding, he said: “Miss Kielland, the last time we met I promised that I would talk about everything except the one subject you have forbidden me to mention.","This question came so unexpectedly that he looked at her in bewilderment for a moment. He replied softly, his heart going pitapat: “Miss Kielland, the last time we were together I promised that, if I was allowed to see you once more, I would talk about anything but what I had been forbidden to talk about."
Men De har tatt feil! roper hun bestyrtet. Det var mere enn to hundre i småsedler.,But you are wrong! she shouts in astonishment. There were more than two hundred in leaflets.,“But you made a mistake!” she cried in dismay. “There were more than two hundred crowns in small notes.”,"“But you made a mistake!” she cries, dismayed. “There was more than two hundred in small bills.”"
Nu brast doktoren i latter.,Now the doctor burst into laughter.,The doctor burst into laughter.,Then the doctor burst out laughing.
"Skål! sa Nagel, la oss ikke glemme hva vi er her for. Vil De virkelig si, doktor, at det å gi bort en tirubel når man har en blank million tilbake er noen beundring verd? Jeg forstår ikke Deres og alle folks tankegang, jeg må være anderledes innrettet. Om man krevet mitt liv for det så kan jeg ikke innse at noen – allerminst en rikmann – fortjener beundring for at han gir bort en almisse.","Toast! said Nagel, let's not forget what we're here for. Do you really want to say, Doctor, that giving away a hurricane when you have a blank million left is worth admiring? I do not understand the thinking of you and all the people, I must be different. If my life was demanded for it, I can not realize that anyone - at least a rich man - deserves admiration for giving away alms.","“Your health!” said Nagel. “We musn’t forget why we’re here. Do you mean to say, doctor, that a man deserves credit for giving away a ten-ruble note when he has a cool million left? I can’t follow your thinking on this—or anyone else ’s, for that matter. I must have a different conception of things from the rest of you. For the life of me, I can’t see why anyone—least of all, a wealthy man—should be commended for charitable deeds.”","“Skoal!” Nagel said. “Let’s not forget what we’re here for.10 Do you really mean to say, Doctor, that giving away a ten-ruble note when one has a cool million left is worth admiring? I can’t understand the way you, and everybody else, regard this matter; I must be differently made. For the life of me, I cannot see how anybody—least of all a wealthy man—deserves to be admired for giving a bit of alms.”"
Dette lo man av igjen; sakføreren klinket begeistret med alle de glass han så på bordet og drakk. Men Dagny sa plutselig:,This was laughed at again; the lawyer clinked excitedly with all the glasses he saw on the table and drank. But Dagny suddenly said:,This brought forth another sally of laughter. Hansen gaily clinked all the glasses on the table and drank. Suddenly Dagny remarked: ‘They say all naval officers are clods.,"This brought renewed laughter; the lawyer enthusiastically clinked all the glasses on the table and drank. But suddenly Dagny said, “Lieutenants are supposed to be so ungifted."
"Han beholdt sin stemning den hele dag. Han gikk ut igjen mot kveld, la atter veien ned mot sjøen og fant påny de tusen småting som satte ham i henrykkelse. Solen dalte, det brutale, brennende lys dempedes og gjød seg bløtt over vannet; om det så var støyen ute fra skipene så lydde den mere stille. Nagel så at flagg heisedes her og der utover vågen, fra flere huser i byen viftet også flagg og litt efter stanset arbeidet ved alle brygger.","He kept his mood all day. He went out again towards evening, made his way down to the sea again and found again the thousand little things that put him in awe. The sun went down, the brutal, burning light dimmed and softened over the water; if there was noise from the ships, it sounded quieter. Nagel saw that flags were hoisted here and there beyond the wave, from several houses in the city also waved flags and a little later the work stopped at all piers.","This state of euphoria lasted for the rest of the day. Toward evening he again went out. He took the road leading toward the sea, and again found himself enchanted by a thousand small wonders. The sun was going down. Its harsh glare faded into a soft, diffused glow which spread over the water. Even the noise from the ships was muted. Nagel noticed flags flying here and there all around the fjord; several houses in town also had flags hoisted, and gradually all work came to a standstill on the docks.","This mood stayed with him all day. Toward evening he went out once more and, taking the same road down to the sea, found anew a thousand little things that made him go into raptures.

Nagel saw flags being hoisted here and there along the bay; flags were also fluttering at several houses in town, and shortly afterward work came to a standstill on all the piers."
"Nu foreslo sakføreren i sin galgenstemning at de også skulle knuse resten av glassene. Nagel motsatte seg intet, og nu moret fire voksne menn seg med å slynge det ene glass efter det andre mot veggen. Derefter drakk de av flaskene, skrålte som matroser og danset rundt. Klokken ble fire før kommersen endte. Doktoren var da overstadig full. Ennu i døren vendte student Øien seg om mot Nagel og sa:","Now the lawyer suggested in his gallows mood that they should also break the rest of the glasses.

For Nagel, that is, Johan Nagel? Oh dear, three telegrams! Say, do me the favor to take away that picture on the wall, will you? So I won’t have it staring me in the face. It would be so tiresome to lie in bed looking at it all the time. Napoleon III, you see, didn’t have such a green beard. Thank you!”"
"Efter en liten stunds forløp vendte også hans ro tilbake. Man talte så velsignet livlig om den ene ting efter den andre; hans lyse glede bemektiget seg ham igjen og fikk hans røst til å beve. Han levet jo, han var ikke død og han skulle heller ikke dø. Omkring et bord med hvit duk og blankt sølvtøy satt i denne grønne, løvrike have et selskap av glade mennesker som lo og spilte med øynene; var det så grunn til å være uhyggelig tilmote?","After a while, his calm also returned. One spoke so blessedly lively about one thing after another; his bright joy seized him again and made his voice tremble. He lived, he was not dead, nor was he to die. Around a table with white tablecloth and shiny silverware sat in this green, leafy garden a company of happy people who laughed and played with their eyes; was there such a reason to be sinister?","After a few moments he regained his composure. The conversation was animated. Once again his happy frame of mind returned, making his voice unsteady. He was alive, not dead, and not about to die! A gay, lively group of people were sitting around this table with its snowy tablecloth, bright-eyed and laughing. How could he possibly feel dejected?","After a short while his composure returned. The conversation was refreshingly lively, moving from one topic to another; once again his keen joy took possession of him, making his voice tremble.

"Tenk, jeg visste det! sa Dagny Kielland med én gang. – Jeg kjente ham like fra det øyeblikk De sa at han knelte og kysset jorden. Jeg forsikrer Dem at jeg kjente ham igjen. Har De talt noe videre med ham?","Think, I knew it! said Dagny Kielland at once. - I knew him right from the moment you said he knelt and kissed the ground. I assure you I recognized him. Have you talked to him any further?",“I knew it!” Dagny Kielland burst out. “I knew it the moment you said he knelt down and kissed the ground. I knew immediately who it was. Have you had a chance to talk to him?”,“I knew it!” Dagny Kielland said of a sudden. “I recognized him the moment you said he kneeled down and kissed the ground. I assure you I recognized him. Have you talked to him at any length?”
"Flasken har glasspropp, over glassproppen ligger en tredobbelt papirhette påbundet med blå apotekerstreng. Han løser strengen og tar proppen opp. Klart som vann, med en svak lukt av mandler! Han holder glasset opp for øynene, det er halvt fullt. I det samme hører han en lyd langt borte, et par sangrende slag; det var kirkeklokken som slo to i byen. Han hvisker: Klokken slo! Og han hever glasset hurtig til munnen og tømmer det.","The bottle has a glass stopper, above the glass stopper is a triple paper cap tied with a blue pharmacy string.

"Om jeg bare kunne berolige Dem, frøken! sa Nagel igjen. Det er dog ikke alltid man blir så redd for meg når jeg kommer inn et sted, hehehe; det er nemlig ikke første gang jeg er inne hos folk her i byen; det er ikke bare Dem jeg har hjemsøkt. Jeg går fra hus til hus, jeg forsøker meg overalt, ja De har kanskje hørt om det? Ikke? Men det er dog så. Min bestilling fører det med seg, jeg er altså samler, jeg samler alle slags gamle ting, jeg kjøper foreldede saker og betaler for det hva det kan være verd. Ja bli nu ikke forskrekket, frøken, jeg stjeler ikke noe med meg når jeg går, hehehe, jeg har i det hele tatt ikke den uvane. De skal bare være trygg. Får jeg ikke kjøpt noe med godt og gode så er det ingen råd med det.","If only I could calm you down, miss! said Nagel again. However, you do not always get so scared of me when I enter a place, hehehe; it is not the first time I have been with people here in the city; it's not just you I have haunted. I go from house to house, I try everywhere, yes You may have heard of it? Not? But it is so. My order brings with it, I am a collector, I collect all kinds of old things, I buy obsolete things and pay for what it may be worth. Yes, do not be frightened now, miss, I do not steal anything with me when I go, hehehe, I do not have the habit at all. They just need to be safe. If I can not buy something with good and good, then there is no way to afford it.","“Please, I would like to assure you that you have nothing to worry about,” said Nagel. “I usually don’t frighten people when I come to call. This isn’t the first time I’ve called on people here in town, so you aren’t the only one. I go from house to house and try my luck everywhere—perhaps you’ve heard about me? No? Well, it’s true. It’s part of my job —I’m a collector —I buy all kinds of old things and pay whatever they might be worth. Don’t be alarmed! I’m not a thief —I assure you I’m not in the habit of walking off with other people’s belongings. You are quite safe with me. If I can’t bargain in a friendly way and buy what I want to the satisfaction of both parties, I’m not interested.”","“If only I could put you at ease, miss!” Nagel said once more. “You know, people don’t always get so frightened when I call on them, heh-heh-heh; this is not, you see, the first time I’ve been to someone’s house here. You’re not the only one I’ve inflicted myself on. I go from house to house, trying my luck everywhere. Well, perhaps you’ve heard about it? No? It’s true, though. It comes with my occupation, I’m a collector, you see; I collect all kinds of old things, buy antiquated articles and pay what they may be worth. Now, don’t get frightened, miss, I don’t sneak off with anything when I leave, heh-heh-heh, I certainly don’t have that bad habit. You may rest assured of that. If I fail to obtain an article by friendly means, that cannot be helped.”"
"Samme regn, samme mørke, tunge vær den neste dag. Det syntes som om alt det vann som ustanselig skyllet ned gjennom takrennene og drev mot rutene aldri ville høre opp. Time efter time gikk, hele formiddagen gikk, og himmelen ble ikke klarere.

It seemed as if all the water that was constantly washing down through the gutters and drifting towards the windows would never stop.

"Dette kolde og overmåte riktige svar vakte først hans likefremme beundring. Han satt i begrep med å påskjønne det med en eller annen artighet, men betenkte seg.

Nei, hører du, nei! Hva skal jeg gjøre? Jeg vil ikke? Himmelske Gud, hva skal jeg gjøre?","Yes he was going to die, he sensed so clearly how the acid made its effect in his intestines. No why now, why immediately? My God, that did not have to happen right now! No, it had to, right? Where it already began to blacken before his eyes!

I will not? Heavenly God, what shall I do?","He clearly felt the acid burning his entrails. But why now, why this minute? In the name of God, he couldn’t die just yet! How dark it was getting!

Good God, I don’t want to die, what shall I do?","Yes, he was going to die, he clearly felt the acid doing something to his insides. No, why now, why at once?

Plutselig ropte han over til adjunkten:","Break. Nagel put the glass back in his vest pocket. The doctor sank more and more, drank from his glass, looked around with dead eyes and spat on the floor.

"Han åpnet et vindu og la seg på albuene i karmen, brutt, tilintetgjort av bevegelse. Nu var hans vrede forbi, han krympet seg sammen og begynte å hulke, hulke med hodet ned i sine armer, stumt, med tørre øyne og rystende kropp. Således var det løpt av! Å hvor han angret det, hvor han ønsket det ugjort! Hun hadde kastet sitt lommetørkle ned, kanskje med vilje, kanskje for å ydmyke ham; men hva så? Han kunne kanskje ha tatt det opp, stjålet det og gjemt det på sitt bryst gjennom hele livet. Det var aldeles snehvitt og han trådte det ned i den bløte vei! Hun hadde kanskje slett ikke villet ta det fra ham når han først hadde fått det i hendene; kanskje hadde hun latt ham beholde det; gud vet! Men hadde hun allikevel rakt hånden ut efter det ville han ha kastet seg ned og bedt om det, med opprakte hender bønnfalt om det som et minne, en nåde. Og hva hadde det gjort om hun igjen hadde hånet ham?","He opened a window and lay on his elbows in the frame, broken, destroyed by movement. Now his anger was over, he shrank and began to sob, sob with his head down in his arms, dumb, with dry eyes and trembling body. Thus it was run off! Oh how he regretted it, how he wanted it undone! She had thrown down her handkerchief, perhaps on purpose, perhaps to humiliate him; but so what? Maybe he could have picked it up, stolen it and hidden it on his chest all his life. It was completely snow white and he stepped it into the soft road! She might not have wanted to take it from him at all once he had got it in his hands; perhaps she had let him keep it; God knows! But if she had stretched out her hand after that, he would have thrown himself down and asked for it, with outstretched hands begging for it as a memory, a grace. And what would it have done if she had mocked him again?","He opened the window and leaned on the windowsill, crushed and defeated. His anger was gone; he collapsed, sobbing convulsively; his whole body shook. So this was the end! How he regretted it —how he wished none of it had ever happened! She had dropped her handkerchief, most likely on purpose, most likely to humiliate him, but what did that matter? He could have picked it up, pocketed it, and carried it next to his heart for the rest of his life. It was snow-white and he had trampled it into the mud! Maybe she wouldn’t have taken it away from him once he held it in his hands; maybe she would have let him keep it! But had she reached for it, he would have gone down on his knees and begged her to let him keep it, a token of her charity. And would it really have mattered if she had scorned and ridiculed him once more?","He opened a window and leaned forward, his elbows on the sill, broken, crushed by emotion. His anger was gone; clinching up, he started sobbing, sobbing with his head in his hands, mutely, with dry eyes, his body shaking. How could this have happened? Oh, how he regretted it, how he wished it undone! She had tossed her handkerchief down, maybe on purpose, maybe to humiliate him, but so what? He could have picked it up, stolen it, and kept it in his bosom for the rest of his life. It was white as snow, and he had trampled it in the mud! Once he had gotten hold of it, perhaps she would have refused to take it back; perhaps she would have let him keep it! Heaven knows. But if she had held out her hand for it, he would have thrown himself at her feet and pleaded, imploring her with raised hands to let him keep it as a remembrance, out of pity.

"Nei ikke alltid. Kjære, vær ikke sint på meg! De er så fremmed her, jeg vet ingenting før De sier meg det; kanskje mener De det ærlig nu, men angrer altsammen senere.

"Det var også mange store sedler, en masse penger i tusenkroner; verten måtte gå ut og veksle før han kunne få sitt.

"På hjemveien ble Nagel gående ved Dagny Kiellands side. Han hadde ingen bestrebelser gjort for å komme til å gå der, det skjedde ganske tilfeldig; frøkenen gjorde heller intet for å forebygge det. Hun hadde nettopp sagt at hun allerede gledet seg til imorgen aften fordi det alltid var så hyggelig og fritt hos doktorens, de var så utmerkede mennesker, de forstod å gjøre det så morsomt, – så sa Nagel plutselig og med lav røst:","On the way home, Nagel walked by Dagny Kielland's side. He had made no effort to get there, it happened quite by accident; the miss did nothing to prevent it either. She had just said that she was already looking forward to tomorrow night because it was always so nice and free with the doctor's, they were such excellent people, they knew how to make it so funny, - so Nagel said suddenly and in a low voice:","On the way home Nagel found himself walking next to Dagny Kielland. He hadn’t maneuvered it; it had happened quite by accident, but she had made no effort to avoid him.

"Dette var Karlsen. Slik så han ut. Nagel tenkte ved seg selv at til dette ansikt svarte blå hender og teologi. Han satt nettopp og skulle bemerke at det var et uhyggelig ansikt, da han la merke til at fullmektig Reinert flyttet sin stol bort til Dagnys og gav seg til å tale med henne. Så bladde han videre frem og tilbake i albumet og tidde for ikke å forstyrre.","This was Karlsen. This is what he looked like. Nagel thought to himself that blue hands and theology corresponded to this face.

Then he flipped back and forth in the album and kept quiet so as not to disturb.",So this was Karlsen! Nagel thought: those veined hands and an interest in theology were suited to a face like this. He was just about to say that there was something very sad about Karlsen’s countenance when he noticed that Reinert moved his chair closer to Dagny and began talking to her. Nagel withdrew and went on thumbing through the album.,"This was Karlsen. That’s how he looked. Nagel thought to himself that the face tallied with blue hands and theology.

So he continued turning the pages of the album, back and forth, and remained silent so as not to disturb."
"Nagel gav et lite utrop av forundring. Han henvendte seg til en mann og spurte hva blussene og flaggene skulle bety. Mannen så på ham, spyttet, så på ham igjen og svarte at det var den 23de juni, det var sankthansaften. Nå, det var sankthansaften! Ja det hadde forresten sin riktighet, det var ikke til å misforstå, det passet også med datoen. Tenk, sankthansaften iaften, det ene gode dynget seg på det andre, det var attpå kjøpet sankthansaften! Nagel gnidde seg fornøyd i hendene og drev bort til dampskipskaien han også, og flere ganger gjentok han for seg selv at det var da et makeløst hell han var ute for.","Nagel gave a small exclamation of astonishment. He turned to a man and asked what the flares and flags meant. The man looked at him, spat, looked at him again and replied that it was the 23rd of June, it was Christmas Eve. Well, it was Christmas Eve! Yes, by the way, it was correct, it was not to be misunderstood, it also matched the date. Think, on Christmas Eve, one good thing piled on top of the other, it was on Christmas Eve! Nagel rubbed his hands happily and drove to the steamship quay he too, and several times he repeated to himself that it was then an incomparable luck he was out for.","With an exclamation of surprise, Nagel turned to a man standing nearby and asked the reason for the flags and the bonfires. The man looked at him and spat and looked at him again before answering; it was June 23, Midsummer Eve! So it was Midsummer Eve! That was it, of course! There had been one pleasant surprise after another today, and now this, too, into the bargain! Nagel, happy as a child, joined the crowd on the pier, delighted at his good fortune.","Nagel gave a brief exclamation of surprise. Turning to a man, he asked him what the bonfires and the flags were supposed to mean. The man looked at him, spat, looked at him again and replied that it was June 23, Midsummer Eve. Ah, it was Midsummer Eve! That was quite correct, of course, there was no mistaking it; it also tallied with the date. Just imagine, it was Midsummer Eve tonight—one good thing came on top of another, and it was Midsummer Eve to boot! Nagel rubbed his hands with pleasure and strolled over to the steamship landing like the rest, repeating to himself several times how incredibly lucky he was."

"Han reiste seg på kne og rugget pinefullt frem og tilbake med hodet. Hør, nu ropte det fra sjøen! Klokken ble snart tolv og ringen var ikke funnet. Og et vesen kom efter ham, han hørte lyden av det, et skjelldyr med slunken mave som slepte efter jorden og dro en våt vei, en gruelig hieroglyf med armer ut fra hodet og en gul klo på nesen. Vekk, vekk! Det ropte igjen fra sjøen og han holdt hendene hylende opp for ørene for ikke å høre det.","He got up on his knees and rocked back and forth painfully with his head. Listen, now it's shouting from the sea! It was almost twelve o'clock and the ring had not been found.

There was a cry from the sea! It was almost midnight and the ring was still missing. Something was coming after him; he heard the sound of a scaly beast with a scrawny belly dragging itself along the ground, leaving a damp trail behind, a gruesome monster with arms growing out of its head and a yellow claw protruding from its nose. Get away! Get away! Again there was a cry from the sea, and he put his hands to his ears so as not to hear it.","Having gotten to his knees, he rocked his head painfully back and forth.

"Nei for et nydelig barn han hadde! Den dag jeg traff henne på gaten regnet det; hun bar et spann i hånden og hadde mistet sine penger til dampkjøkkenet, hun gikk og gråt. Salig mamma, så du fra din himmel at jeg ikke eiet en eneste skilling til å glede barnet med? At jeg slet meg i håret på gaten og ikke eiet en øre? Så kom musikken forbi; den smukke diakonisse vendte seg om engang og gav meg et blankt blikk; så gikk hun stille hjem, lutende med hodet, formodentlig sørgende over seg selv for det blanke blikk hun hadde gitt meg.

Did you see me tearing my hair on the street because I didn’t have an øre to give her? At that moment the band marched by; the pretty girl who works at the parish turned and smiled at me; then she walked home, subdued, with head bowed, probably regretting the glance she had given me.

"Videre måtte de ta seg en dag eller to i uken fri, så skulle de gå på jakt og fiskeri sammen, begge to, hånd i hånd, hun i kort kjole og et belte om livet, han i bluse og spennesko.

"Han tenkte ikke noe over det, han drev atter opp i skogen, drev frem og tilbake, gikk like til prestegårdens uthuser og så innover gårdsplassen. Derfra gikk han atter inn i skogen, boret seg inn på det dunkleste sted han kunne finne og satte seg på en sten. Han støttet hodet i den ene hånd og trommet med den andre på kneet. Han satt således en lang stund, kanskje en hel time, og da han endelig reiste seg og gikk var solen helt nede. Den første tone av skumring var kommet over byen.","He did not think anything of it, he drifted up into the forest again, drifted back and forth, went straight to the rectory outbuildings and looked into the courtyard. From there he went back into the forest, drilled into the darkest place he could find and sat down on a rock. He supported his head with one hand and drummed with the other on his knee. He thus sat for a long time, perhaps an entire hour, and when he finally got up and left, the sun was completely down.

He remained in this position for a long time, an hour perhaps, and when he finally got up to leave, the sun had sunk below the horizon and dusk was settling over the town.","Without giving it any thought, he wandered off into the woods again; after walking back and forth, he went as far as the outbuildings of the parsonage and looked into the yard.

Hun var overordentlig interessant og jeg beslutter meg til å gjøre noe. Jeg kunne låne henne disse penger for å se hvorledes det ville løpe av. Det var bare av nysgjerrighet jeg gjorde det og bakefter stikker jeg ennu en dollar til henne for å se hvorledes hun også ville bruke den. Det måtte bli særdeles morsomt å se.,She was extremely interesting and I decide to do something. I could lend her this money to see how it would turn out. It was only out of curiosity that I did it and afterwards I stick another dollar to her to see how she would use it too.

I thought it might prove amusing; I even slipped an extra dollar into her hand, just to get her reaction.","“She was unusually interesting and I decided to do something.

"Ja, svarer Minutten, det er den 6te juli. Dermed legger han hånden på dørvrideren.","Yes, the Minute answers, it's the 6th of July.

"I de første øyeblikk satt han ennu opprett, med lukkede øyne, med det tomme glass i den ene hånd og med proppen i den andre. Det hele var gått så villig at han ikke hadde fulgt riktig med. Nu bakefter begynte tankene litt efter litt å strømme ham til hodet, han åpnet øynene og så seg forvillet om. Alt dette, disse trær, denne himmel, denne jord skulle han nu aldri se mere. Hvor det var forunderlig! Allerede snikte giften seg om inne i ham, trakk seg gjennom fine vever, brøt seg en blå vei inn til hans årer; om litt fikk han krampe, litt efter lå han stiv.","For the first few moments he was still sitting upright, with his eyes closed, with the empty glass in one hand and the stopper in the other. It had all gone so willingly that he had not followed correctly. Now, after a while, thoughts began to flow to his head little by little, he opened his eyes and looked around confused. All this, these trees, this heaven, this earth he should never see again. How wonderful it was! Already the poison snuck around inside him, pulled through fine weaves, broke a blue path into his veins; in a little while he got cramps, a little later he lay stiff.","For a few moments he sat upright still, with his eyes closed, holding the vial in one hand and the stopper in the other. It had been so effordess that he didn’t quite realize what had happened. Now thoughts gradually suffused his conscious mind. He opened his eyes and looked around in a daze. These trees, this sky, this earth, he was seeing all this for the last time. How strange that seemed! The poison was already spreading through his body, penetrating the tissues, forcing a blue path through his veins. In a while the cramps would come, and then he would be lying there rigid and still.","The first few moments he still sat upright, his eyes closed, the empty vial in one hand and the stopper in the other. The whole thing had gone so briskly that he hadn’t quite kept up with it. Now, afterward, his thoughts gradually began to crowd in on him, he opened his eyes and looked about him in a daze. These trees, this sky, this earth—all this he would now never see again. How strange! The poison was already sneaking about inside him, seeping through the fine tissues, making its blue way into his veins; in a moment he would go into convulsions, and a little later he would be dead and stiff."
"Godt! svarer jeg, hehehe, godt, jeg skal ikke si mere. Men i det samme får jeg øye på hennes deilige munn og jeg sier: Unnskyld, min frue, at jeg har oppholdt Dem med sludder og snakk så lenge. Må jeg ellers takke så meget for Deres velvilje. Deres munn er vidunderlig skjønn når De smiler. Adjø.","Well! I answer, hehehe, well, I need say no more. But at the same time I catch sight of her lovely mouth and I say: Sorry, my lady, that I have kept you with nonsense and talk for so long. May I thank you so much for your kindness. Your mouth is wonderfully beautiful when you smile. Goodbye.","“All right, I won’t say any more.” But focusing my eyes on her lovely mouth, I say: “I’m sorry I talked on at such length. But thank you for your kind attention. Your mouth is beautiful when you smile. Goodby.”","“All right!” I reply, “heh-heh-heh, all right, I won’t say any more.” But at that very moment I notice her lovely mouth and I say, “I’m sorry, madam, for having taken up so much of your time with stuff and nonsense. But thank you so much for your kindness. Your lips are divinely beautiful when you smile. Goodbye.”"
"Nei, sier Minutten også og trer spakferdig tilbake.","No, Minute also says and steps back in full swing.","“Nothing,” said The Midget, and meekly withdrew.","“No,” Miniman says, quietly withdrawing."
"Så kommer den unge gutt tilbake, lydløst, som en ånd, glidende på filtsko. Han sier ingenting, jeg sier heller ingenting; men han rekker meg en bitte liten porselenspipe med langt, tynt rør og jeg tar imot pipen. Så holder han en glo til og jeg røker.

Neither of us said anything, but he handed me a small porcelain pipe with a long stem, which I accepted. Then he put what looked like a glowing charcoal into it and I proceeded to smoke.

"Nei men Dagny! hvisker frøken Andresen og reiser seg. Minutten reiser seg også. Alle er meget pinlig berørt. Nagel så opp, hans ansikt forrådte ikke megen bevegelse, men alle la merke til at han slapp sitt glass og vridde sine hender et par ganger og at han åndet hurtig. Hva ville han gjøre? Hva betydde det at han smilte litt og straks igjen ble alvorlig? Til alles forundring svarte han med rolig røst:","No, Dagny! Miss Andresen whispers and gets up. The minute also rises. Everyone is very embarrassed. Nagel looked up, his face not betraying much movement, but everyone noticed that he released his glass and twisted his hands a few times and that he breathed fast. What would he do? What did it mean that he smiled a little and immediately became serious again? To everyone's astonishment, he replied in a calm voice:","“Dagny!” whispered Miss Andresen, getting to her feet. Everyone felt awkward. Nagel looked up. His face showed no emotion, but they all noticed that he put down his glass and began wringing his hands. He was breathing heavily. What would he do?

"Tolv år eldre! utbryter han henrykt over at hun følger med, at hun dog ikke taper hodet helt. Altså tolv år eldre, det er utmerket, det er likefrem herlig! Ja og tror De at tolv år er noen hindring? Jeg mener De er gal, menneske! Men hvorom allting er: om De så var tre ganger tolv år eldre, når jeg nu er blitt glad i Dem og jeg mener oppriktig hvert ord jeg sier i denne stund, hva så? Jeg har tenkt på dette lenge, ja egentlig ikke lenge, men dog i flere dager, jeg lyver slett ikke, tro meg nu for himmelens skyld når jeg ber Dem så innstendig. Jeg har tenkt på det i ganske mange dager og har ikke sovet om nettene av den grunn. De har så underlige øyne, de har dradd meg fra første gang jeg så Dem. For jeg kan dras til verdens ende av et par øyne; akk engang har en gammel mann trukket meg rundt i en skog en halv natt igjennom bare med sine øyne. Mannen var besatt …. Nå, det er en annen historie! Men Deres øyne har virket på meg. Kan De huske engang De stod herinne midt på gulvet og så på meg da jeg gikk forbi utenfor? De vendte ikke hodet efter meg, De bare fulgte meg med øynene, jeg glemmer det aldri. Men da jeg også traff Dem engang og fikk talt med Dem ble jeg rørt av Deres smil. Jeg vet ikke at jeg noensinne har sett noen le så hjertelig varmt som De; men det vet De ikke selv, og det er nettopp så vidunderlig skjønt at De ikke vet det selv …. Nu vrøvler jeg noe ganske forskrekkelig. Jeg hører det nok; men jeg har følelsen av at jeg må tale ustanselig, ellers tror De meg ikke, og dette får meg til å forvirre meg. Men hvis De bare ikke satt således på sprang, jeg mener: så ferdig til å reise Dem og gå, så skulle jeg straks få det bedre til. Jeg ber Dem, la meg få holde Deres hånd igjen så skal jeg nok tale klarere. Så, takk! …. De forstår, jeg vil virkelig intet annet oppnå av Dem enn det jeg har sagt; jeg sitter ikke her med baktanker. Og hva er det så som forbløffer Dem så ved mine ord? De kan ikke fatte at jeg har fått denne gale tanke, De kan ikke begripe at jeg – at jeg – vil, nei, og De synes ikke det kan være mulig; ikke sant, det er det De sitter og tenker på?","Twelve years older! he exclaims delighted that she follows, that she does not lose her head completely. So twelve years older, it's excellent, it's just wonderful! Yes and do you think that twelve years is an obstacle? I mean you're crazy, man! But what is it all about: if you were three times twelve years older, now that I have fallen in love with you and I sincerely mean every word I say at this moment, what then? I've been thinking about this for a long time, not really long, but for several days, I'm not lying at all, believe me now for heaven's sake when I ask you so earnestly. I've been thinking about it for quite a few days and have not slept at night for that reason. They have such strange eyes, they have drawn me from the first time I saw you. For I can be drawn to the end of the world by a pair of eyes; alas, once an old man has dragged me around a forest for half a night through with only his eyes. The man was obsessed…. Now, that's a different story! But your eyes have worked on me. Do you remember once you stood here in the middle of the floor and looked at me as I passed outside? They did not turn their heads after me, They just followed me with their eyes, I will never forget it. But when I also met you once and got to talk to you, I was touched by your smile. I do not know that I have ever seen anyone laugh as warmly as you; but you do not know it yourself, and it is just so wonderful though that you do not know it yourself…. Now I'm rubbing something pretty awful. I hear it enough; but I have the feeling that I have to speak incessantly, otherwise you will not believe me, and this will confuse me. But if you just did not run like that, I mean: so ready to get up and go, I should immediately get better. I beg you, let me hold your hand again and I'll probably speak more clearly. So, thank you! …. You understand, I really do not want to achieve anything from you other than what I have said; I'm not sitting here with ulterior motives. And what is it then that astonishes you by my words? You can not comprehend that I have been given this wrong thought, You can not comprehend that I - that I - will, no, and You do not think it can be possible; right, that's what you're sitting and thinking about?","“Twelve years older!” he exclaimed, terribly pleased that she had been paying attention to him and hadn’t panicked. “That’s splendid—as a matter of fact, it’s marvelous! Do you think that twelve years make any difference? You can’t really mean that! Even if you were three times twelve years older—if I care deeply for you, and I mean it, what would that matter? I’ve been thinking about this for a long time— well, for a couple of days, anyway— and I’m telling you the truth. I implore you to believe me! For several days and nights I’ve had this on my mind and haven’t been able to sleep. You have such mysterious eyes; they captivated me from the first moment I saw you. Eyes have a particular fascination for me; they could entice me to the ends of the earth. Once an old man lured me around a forest for the better part of the night by the magic of his eyes alone. The man was obsessed. Well, that’s another story. — Your eyes have a strange effect on me. Do you remember the day you were standing here in the middle of the room looking at me as I passed by? I’ll never forget that moment—you didn’t turn your head, but your eyes followed me. And once I’d met you and had a chance to talk to you, your smile went straight to my heart. I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone with a warmer and more genuine laugh than yours. But you are completely oblivious of it—therein lies the magic and the charm. I know I’m talking a lot of nonsense. But I feel I must go on talking; otherwise, you won’t believe me, and the mere thought makes me desperate. If only you wouldn’t sit there so rigid, as if you were about to get up and go away, it would be easier for me to gather my thoughts. Please let me hold your hand; it would be so much easier for me to say what is in my heart. Bless you! I’m not asking any more of you than what I’ve just said. I’m hiding nothing. What have I said that shocks you so? You think it’s an insane idea, you can’t understand that I want to marry you—and you refuse to believe that I mean it.","“Twelve years older!” he exclaims, delighted that she’s paying attention, that she isn’t losing her head completely. “So, you’re twelve years older, that’s splendid , it’s simply grand! You don’t think, do you, that twelve years is an obstacle? Why, you must be mad! But however that may be—even if you were three times twelve years older, what difference would it make, as long as I’m in love with you and mean every word that passes my lips at this moment? I’ve been thinking about this for a long time, well, not that long, but for several days anyway, that’s the truth; for heaven’s sake, believe me, I implore you. I’ve been thinking about it for a number of days and spent sleepless nights because of it. You have such strange eyes, I was drawn by them from the moment I saw you; I could be drawn to the world ’s end by a pair of eyes. Once an old man, alas, dragged me around a forest for half a night by his eyes alone. The man was possessed—. Well, that’s another story. But your eyes have affected me.

But once I met you and had a chance to talk to you, I was also moved by your smile. I don’t think I’ve ever seen anybody laugh with such heartfelt warmth as you; but that’s something you don’t know about, which is just the wonder and the beauty of it, that you don’t know about it.... Oh, what frightful drivel I’m talking. I can hear it well enough, but I have the feeling that I must talk continuously, otherwise you won’t believe me, and that makes me confused.4 If only you didn’t sit there like that, about to take off—I mean, ready to get up and go—I would do better right away. Please let me hold your hand again, then I’ll be sure to speak more lucidly. There, thank you! ... You see, all I really want from you is what I’ve just told you, nothing more; I have no ulterior motives. So what have I said that you find so disconcerting? You can’t fathom how I came up with this crazy idea, you can’t understand that I—that I—really want to, right?"
"La meg bare underrette Dem om, fortsatte Nagel blek av sinnsbevegelse, at hvis De noen gang sier et ord om det par skillinger så slår jeg Dem ihjel – ihjel! Ved Gud i himmelen! Forstår De meg? Og la også Deres onkel holde tett.","Let me just inform you, Nagel continued pale with emotion, that if you ever say a word about that couple of shillings, I'll kill you - kill! By God in heaven! Do you understand me? And also let your uncle hold tight.","“Just let me tell you,” said Nagel, white with fury. “If you ever breathe a word about those few shillings, I’ll kill you! Kill you! Do you understand?

"Ennu en hel time bakefter fant han dette puss aldeles fortreffelig når han tenkte på det. Det skulle komme over henne som et vidunderlig himmelbrev, ovenifra, fra høyden, sluppet ned på henne av ukjente hender. Og hva ville hun ikke si når hun fikk disse skillinger! Men da han igjen spurte seg om hva hun ville komme til å si, hvorledes hun ville ta det hele, ble han atter motløs: Planen var farlig, altfor dristig, det var en dum og dårlig plan. Det var nettopp det at hun intet fornuftig ville si, men bære seg ad som en gås. Når brevet kom ville hun simpelthen ikke forstå seg på det, men overlate til andre å finne det ut. Hun ville bre det frem på posthusets disk så hele byen kom til å tumle med det, ville på stedet legge det hele i postbetjentens skjønn, kanskje ville hun endog skape seg stedig og si: nei behold Deres penger! Så legger postbetjenten sin finger på nesen og roper: Vent litt, stopp en hal’, det foresvever meg noe! Og han slår opp i bøkene og finner at den samme sum er avsendt herfra for et par dager siden, nettopp den selvsamme sum for ikke å si kanskje de selvsamme sedler, to hundre og ti kroner til den og den adresse i Kristiania. Avsenderen viser seg å være en Johan Nagel, en fremmed, som for tiden bor i Central …. Jo slike postbetjenter hadde en nese så lang som så til å snuse med ….","Another full hour later, he found this plaster absolutely superb when he thought about it. It was to come upon her like a wonderful celestial letter, from above, from the heights, dropped on her by unknown hands. And what would she not say when she got these pennies! But when he again asked himself what she would say, how she would take it all, he became discouraged again: The plan was dangerous, too bold, it was a stupid and bad plan. It was precisely that she would not say anything sensible, but behave like a goose. When the letter arrived, she simply would not understand it, but leave it to others to find out. She wanted to spread it on the post office's counter so that the whole town would tumble with it, would put it all in the postman's discretion on the spot, maybe she would even create herself constantly and say: no, keep your money! Then the postman puts his finger on his nose and shouts: Wait a minute, stop a haul ', it bothers me a bit! And he looks up in the books and finds that the same sum was sent from here a couple of days ago, precisely the same sum, not to say perhaps the same banknotes, two hundred and ten kroner to it and the address in Kristiania. The sender turns out to be a Johan Nagel, a stranger, who currently lives in Central…. After all, such postal officers had a nose as long as they could sniff with….","For the next hour he was very pleased with his scheme. The money would fall on her like manna from heaven, be wafted down to her by unseen hands—a miracle. What would be her reaction when all this money rained down on her! But the more he thought about it, the more despondent he became. The idea was crazy and much too risky; he had acted too hastily. When the money came, she would become confused and panicky and would turn it over to others. She would spread it out over the counter at the post office so that the whole town would be in on it. Or perhaps she would become obstinate and say: “Keep your money!” Whereupon the clerk would put his finger to his nose and say: “Wait a second. I’ve got an idea.” And he would thumb through the ledger and find that the same sum had been sent from here a few days ago—exactly the same amount, maybe even the same bills—two hundred and ten crowns to a Christiania address. The sender would turn out to be Johan Nagel, a stranger staying at the Central. Those post-office clerks were snoopy characters …","A whole hour later he still regarded this trick as just great when he thought about it. The letter would descend upon her like a miracle from heaven, from up above, from on high, dropped down on her by unknown hands. Just imagine what she would say when she received all that money! But when he asked himself again what she would say, how she would react to the whole thing, he felt disheartened: the plan was dangerous, all too bold; it was a poor, stupid plan. The catch was that she wouldn’t say a sensible word but behave like a goose. When the letter arrived she would simply fail to understand and leave it to others to find out. She would spread it out on the post-office counter, making the whole town get in on it; she would leave the whole matter to the postal clerk’s discretion right then and there, maybe even act bullheaded and say: Keep your money! Whereupon the postal clerk puts his finger to his nose and cries, Wait a bit, half a mo, I have an idea!

Alt dette så jeg i et sekund. Synet slo meg med forbauselse, jeg lukket uvilkårlig øynene og gikk et halvt skritt tilbake. Da jeg atter så opp var mannen borte ….","He shone himself. He shone with a marvelous light that seemed to be behind him, to radiate from his back and make him transparent; even his clothes became as clear as a day, his trousers were worn and much too short.

When I looked up again, the man was gone….","“He radiated a light of his Own. There was a strange glow about him that seemed to come from behind him and which made him transparent.

Ja.,Yes.,“Yes.”,“Yes.”
"Og for ikke å vekke hennes mistanke om at han bare så på én plett, ett enkelt punkt av det hele, gav han seg til å spørre henne hvem hver især av de opptredende var, og allikevel hørte han knapt på hva hun svarte. De stod der til det røde lys var like på nippet til å slukne og teppet rullet ned.","And in order not to arouse her suspicion that he was only looking at one spot, a single point of it all, he proceeded to ask her who each of the performers was, and yet he hardly listened to what she answered.

"Dagny sprang opp. Det unnslapp henne et ånei! Men litt efter satte hun seg ned igjen. Ja, men billedet er dårlig, sa hun så; han ser meget bedre ut enda.","Dagny jumped up. It escaped her again! But a little later she sat down again.

An “oh no!” escaped her, but shortly she sat down again. “The picture is so poor,” she said, “he’s much better-looking than that.”"
"Jaja, kjære, så var det intet å gjøre ved det da! Så måtte hun ikke gråte mere for den skyld. Det fikk ikke hjelpe det hele. Hun måtte tilgi at han hadde trengt inn på henne med sine bønner. Han hadde dog ment det til det beste ….","Well, dear, there was nothing to do about it then! Then she must not cry any more for that reason. It did not help it all.

Efter en kort stillhet sa Nagel:,"After a short silence, Nagel said:","After a moment’s silence, Nagel said: “Two flowers were lying at the bottom of the grave, two white flowers.","After a brief silence Nagel said, “There were two flowers on the bottom of the grave, two white flowers—you wouldn’t know where they came from, would you?”"

Kan De si meg hvor jeg kunne få lånt en fiolin henne? spurte han. Vet De om det er noen som spiller fiolin her i byen?,Can you tell me where I could borrow a violin from her? he asked.

Hun hadde hørt på ham aldeles bestyrtet og ikke fremført et eneste ord til svar. De stod fremdeles stille.,She had listened to him utterly appalled and not uttered a single word in response.

"Han betalte skyndsomt sin regning, sa godnatt til frøken Andresen og fulgte Martha ut. Hun hadde intet overtøy, bare en paraply som hun søkte å skjule fordi den var så hullet. Da de gikk ut av døren la Nagel merke til at Minutten så efter dem med et langt, smertelig blikk. Hans ansikt var usedvanlig skjevt.","He hurriedly paid his bill, said goodnight to Miss Andresen and followed Martha out.

"Du Jetta, jeg gav den mann som hentet meg fem kroner, så du vet om det. Hahaha, jeg har aldri sett en slik fyr, hele baken av hans bukse var borte; men en styrke i kroppen og en likegladhet! En ren satan! Han sang hele veien utover. Han trodde fullt og fast at han kunne rekke himmelen med en fiskestang når han stod på toppen av Etjefjellet. Du måtte nok stå på tærne da, sa jeg. Ja det skjønte han ikke, han tok det alvorlig og svor på at han kunne stå på tærne så godt som noen. Hahaha, har man hørt slikt! Men morsom var han.","Du Jetta, I gave the man who picked me up five kroner, so you know. Hahaha, I've never seen such a guy, the whole butt of his pants was gone; but a strength in the body and an indifference! A pure satan! He sang all the way out. He firmly believed that he could reach the sky with a fishing rod when he stood on top of Etjefjellet. You probably had to stand on your toes then, I said. Yes, he did not understand that, he took it seriously and swore that he could stand on his toes as well as anyone. Hahaha, have you heard that! But he was funny.","I just want you to know. He was an odd character! The seat of his pants was all worn, but that didn’t seem to bother him in the least. He was the very devil, and strong as an ox. He sang the whole way and assured me that he could reach right up to heaven with a fishing rod if he stood at the top of Etje Mountain. ‘I guess you’d have to stand on tiptoe, though,’ I said. But he took me seriously and assured me that he could stand on tiptoe as well as anyone. He was certainly an odd character, and very amusing.”","Then he suddenly said, “Jetta, look, I gave the man who picked me up five kroner, just so you know. Ha-ha-ha, I’ve never seen such a fellow; the whole seat of his pants was gone, but what strength there was in him, and what nonchalance! A helluva guy! He sang all the way rowing out. He was sure as sin he could reach the sky with a fishing rod if he stood on top of Mount Etje. ‘You would have to stand on tiptoe, then,’ I said. That he didn’t understand; he took it seriously and swore he could stand on tiptoe as well as anybody. Ha-ha-ha, would you believe it! But he certainly was amusing.”"
"Hehehe, nu har jeg aldri hørt så galt. Det innskrenker seg til at jeg i disse dager har fått en smule morsarv, noen få tusen kroner. Det er det hele. Noen landeiendom har jeg derimot ikke, det er en mystifikasjon.","Hehehe, now I've never heard so wrong. It is limited to the fact that these days I have received a bit of maternal inheritance, a few thousand kroner. That's it. However, I do not have any country estate, it is a mystification.",“That’s utter nonsense. It so happens that I’ve recently inherited a few thousand crowns from my mother. But I don’t own any property. Where that rumor came from is a mystery to me.”,"“Heh-heh-heh, I’ve never heard anything so absurd. What it comes down to is that I’ve just received a small inheritance from my mother, a few thousand kroner. That’s all. But I have no landed estate, that’s a mystification.”"
"Nei langt, langt ifra! svarer frøken Andresen; og jeg skal med fornøyelse få fatt på henne nu med det samme. Jeg vet hvor hun sitter henne.","No, far, far away! Miss Andresen answers; and I will gladly get hold of her now at once. I know where she's sitting.","“Not at all,” Miss Andresen replied. “I’ll be glad to go and look for her.

"Ja takk, svarte verten, det haster ikke. Blir De her i lengre tid må vi jo regne noe billigere da. Jeg vet ikke om De har tenkt å bli her i lengre tid?","Yes thank you, replied the host, it is not urgent. If you stay here for a longer period of time, we must expect something cheaper then.

Are you planning to stay for some time?”","“Thanks,” the hotel keeper replied, “there’s no hurry. If you stay for any length of time, we’ll have to charge you somewhat less, of course.

Han svarte ikke. Så fortsatte hun ganske langsomt og alvorlig:,He did not answer. Then she continued quite slowly and seriously:,"He didn’t answer, and she continued, weighing her words slowly and deliberately: “I just don’t understand you.","He didn’t answer.

Nagel svarte likegyldig:,Nagel answered indifferently:,"“Oh, no, I’ve given that up,” Nagel replied in an offhand manner.","Nagel replied nonchalantly, “Oh no, I’m through with that.”"

"Jeg synes De bør drikke litt. Neinei, gjør som De vil. Jeg vil drikke iaften, jeg er nervøs og litt trist. Vil De tillate meg et nærgående spørsmål?

"Så faller uret på gulvet og han springer opp av sengen. Det roper! hvisker han og ser ut av vinduet med oppspilte øyne. Hurtig trekker han noen klær på, åpner dørene og springer ut på gaten. Han ser seg om, ingen iakttar ham. Så setter han avsted i sprang ned mot havnen, hans hvite vesterygg lyser hele tiden. Han når bryggene, følger veien helt ut til den ytterste kai og hopper med én gang i havet.","Then the clock falls on the floor and he jumps out of bed. It's shouting! he whispers, looking out the window with wide-open eyes. He quickly puts on some clothes, opens the doors and runs out into the street. He looks around, no one is watching him.

He reaches the piers, follows the road all the way to the outer quay and immediately jumps into the sea.","The watch fell to the floor and he leaped out of bed. “Someone is calling,” he whispered, and looked out the window with eyes bursting out of their sockets.

"Han springer opp av sengen igjen, river klærne på seg og tumler som en gal omkring i værelset.

De skal vite, frøken, at jeg har anstrengt meg i hele kveld for å mildne det inntrykk De først måtte ha fått av meg. Jeg har ikke sagt et ord uten at det har vært for Deres skyld. Hva sier De til det? Husk på, jeg hadde forbrutt meg sterkt imot Dem og jeg måtte noe gjøre. Jeg bekjenner at jeg riktignok har vært i en litt usedvanlig sinnsstemning i hele dag; men jeg har dog gjort meg adskillig verre enn jeg var og jeg har spilt litt fordektig nesten hele tiden. Det var meg nemlig om å gjøre å få Dem til å tro at jeg virkelig var noe uberegnelig av meg, at jeg overhodet begikk bisarre forgåelser; derved håpet jeg å få Dem til å unnskylde meg så meget lettere.

Oh yes I thank you that I have never thanked in my life! Well why am I not like other people?

It’s true that I have been in a strange mood all day long, but I have made myself appear a good deal worse than I really am, and I’ve been playing a devious game most of the time.

"Ikke? Men jeg vet aldeles ikke om De sier sant, nei det vet jeg ikke. Jeg tviler på Dem, jeg mistror Dem og mistenker Dem for snart sagt hva det skal være.

Well, that’s not a bad idea at all; you’ve come up with far worse things, Jetta.” Suddenly the doctor was in high spirits, his whole face wreathed in a good-natured smile at the prospect of the party. “Just don’t be late,” he said, “and cross your fingers that I won’t be called away.”"
"Dagny satt og slo seg i hånden med en sammenbrettet avis. Hennes lange, hvite fingrer hadde ingen ringer. Nagel mønstret henne i smug.

Gjorde han sin rett vendte han om til hotellet og hånet dem litt. Hva var det for slags høyvelbårne herrer! Agenter i gryn, i amerikanske huder, gud vet om ikke i simpelt krustøy. Jo det var riktig noe å steile bakover for! Og allikevel hadde de gjort det av med hans glade tanker i et eneste øyeblikk. De så ikke engang altfor godt ut! Jo, den ene så litt godt ut, men den andre – han med hudene – hadde en skjev munn som var åpen bare til den ene siden så den lignet et knapphull. Han hadde også en masse grått skjegg i ørene. Tvi, han var ubehagelig som en synd! Men ikke sant, man måtte ikke synge en stubb av glede når den mann var i mattrauet!","Yes, people were not always the same! There now sat these two lawyers or commercial agents or proprietors, whatever they were, they sat up in the dining room and talked politics and looked evil and modest just because he was going to hum a little bit of joy in their hearing. And they chewed their breakfast with exceedingly sensible faces and could not stand the disturbance. Hehe, they both had hanging bellies and baggy, fat fingers; the napkin they had stuck just up under the chin. If he did his right thing, he turned to the hotel and mocked them a little. What kind of high-heeled gentlemen were that! Agents in groats, in American skins, god knows if not in simple croissants. Yes, there was something to steer backwards for! And yet they had done away with his happy thoughts in a single moment. They did not even look too good! Yes, one looked a little good, but the other - he with the skin - had a crooked mouth that was open only to one side so it looked like a buttonhole. He also had a lot of gray beard in his ears. Two, he was uncomfortable as a sin! But not true, one must not sing a stump of joy when that man was in the trough!","People were all alike, weren’t they! There they sat, these lawyers, salesmen, landowners, or what have you, talking politics, and looking sour and grim just because he happened to be humming cheerfully. They solemnly chewed away at their breakfast, refusing to be side-tracked. They both had paunches and puffy, fat fingers; their napkins were tucked under their chins. He ought to go back to the hotel and taunt them a little. Who did they think they were, anyway? Probably grain merchants, dealers in American hides, or perhaps in ordinary crockery. Important men, were they? And still, with one look they had managed to deflate his high spirits! They weren’t particularly impressive either. One wasn’t too bad, but the other one—the hide merchant—had a crooked mouth that opened on one side of his face only, so that it looked like a buttonhole. He also had a lot of gray hair growing out of his ears. God, he was a repulsive sight! But no joyful sounds allowed while this man had his nose in the trough!","People never changed, did they! There they sat, those two lawyers or agents or landowners, or whatever they were, discussing politics in the dining room and looking hateful and sour just because he happened to be humming for joy in their presence. Chewing away at their breakfasts with an exceedingly reasonable air, they couldn’t tolerate being interrupted. Heh-heh, they both had swag bellies and fat, pudgy fingers; their napkins were tucked under their chins. By rights, he ought to go back to the hotel and taunt them a little. What sort of high and mighty gentlemen were they anyway? Agents in grits, in American hides—God knows if it wasn’t in cheap crockery. Truly something to bowl you over! And yet they had put an end to his happy thoughts in an instant. They weren’t even particularly good-looking! Well, one of them didn’t look too bad, but the other—the one with the hides—had a crooked mouth that only opened on one side, so that it reminded you of a buttonhole. He also had a lot of gray hair growing out of his ears. He was ugly as sin, pfui! But, of course, one mustn’t express one’s joy in a snatch of song when that man had his face in the food trough!"

Den 12te juni ….","Have you thought of me? Really? But I must have thought much, much more of you.

"Da reiser plutselig Nagel seg opp fra sitt bord ved vinduet, legger avisen ned og går tversover gulvet. Han forhaster seg ikke og gjør ingen støy, men allikevel tiltrakk han seg alles oppmerksomhet. Han stanser ved Minutten, legger sin hånd på hans aksel og sier med høy, klar røst:","Then Nagel suddenly gets up from his table by the window, lays the newspaper down and walks across the floor.

"Endelig reiste frøken Andresen seg for å gå og allesammen reiste seg da. Da Nagel sa godnatt takket han så varmt, så oppriktig for seg at han ganske avvæpnet doktoren som hadde vært litt sur mot ham det siste kvarter. Kom snart igjen! Si meg, har De en cigar? Tenn endelig en cigar. Og doktoren nødet ham inn efter en ny cigar.","Finally Miss Andresen got up to go and everyone got up then. When Nagel said goodnight, he thanked so warmly, so sincerely to himself that he quite disarmed the doctor who had been a little angry with him the last quarter of an hour. Come back soon! Tell me, do you have a cigar? Finally, light a cigar. And the doctor nodded him in for a new cigar.","Finally Miss Andresen got up to leave, and so did everyone else. When Nagel said good night, he expressed his thanks so warmly and so sincerely that the doctor, who had been annoyed with him the last quarter of an hour, was quite disarmed. “Come back soon,” he said. “Do you have a cigar? Have one of mine!” And he insisted that Nagel have another cigar.","Finally Miss Andresen got up to leave, whereupon everybody else did the same. When Nagel said good night, he thanked his hosts so warmly, so sincerely, that the doctor, who had been slightly cross with him the last quarter of an hour, was quite disarmed. “Come back soon!

Jo kanskje også talt med henne. – Og Nagel legger tankefullt til for seg selv: Var det frøken Kielland!,Maybe even talked to her. - And Nagel thoughtfully adds to himself: Was it Miss Kielland!,But perhaps you haven’t had a chance to talk to her yet?” “I may have.” And Nagel added pensively to himself: Could that have been Miss Kielland?,"“Oh yes, I may have talked to her, too.” And Nagel adds pensively to himself, Was that Miss Kielland?"

"Ja hva så? Skinnet ikke solen og var han ikke lykkelig over at han ennu levet og kunne gå hvorhen han ville? Var noen herlighet stengt for ham? Solen lå over torvet og sjøen, fuglene sang i de små nydelige haver ved hvert hus og flyttet seg uavlatelig fra gren til gren; allevegne lå gull og fløt, gruset i gatene badet seg i det og oppe på kirkespiret stod den forsølvede kule og dirret mot himmelen som en uhyre diamant.","Yes so what? Did not the sun shine and was he not happy that he was still alive and could go where he wanted? Was any glory closed to him?

The sun was shining, and he was happy to be alive and free to go wherever he liked. The whole world seemed to be at his feet.

"Han hadde nettopp åpnet sin fiolinkasse da Sara kom inn, og hun så da til sin store forbauselse at denne kasse som hun alltid hadde behandlet så forsiktig bare inneholdt skittentøy og noen papirer og skrivesaker på bunnen, men ingen fiolin.

"Han la veien om bryggene for å se skipene ennu en gang, og da han passerte den siste kai tok han plutselig sin jernring av fingeren og kastet den på sjøen. Han så hvor den falt ned langt ute.

"Nå, det kan også være like meget enten jeg søker lege eller ei, fortsatte hun som et egensindig barn. Hvem skulle sørge over meg om jeg døde? …. Men plutselig slo hun om, gjorde som om hun betenkte seg og sa: Når jeg overveier det, hvorfor skulle jeg ikke motta Deres penger? Hvorfor ikke like så godt nu som før? Jeg er da ikke så overstadig rik at jeg av den grunn skulle …. Ja men nu har De gang på gang passet på å tilby meg dem i et øyeblikk da jeg har vært oppirret, så De på forhånd kunne vite at jeg ville avslå dem. Jo De har! De har beregnet det nøye, bare for å spare Deres penger, skjønt De har så mange av dem nu; tror De ikke jeg har merket det? Og selv om De byr meg dem nu igjen, ennu en gang, så gjør De det for å ydmyke meg og glede Dem over at jeg tilsist er nødt til å motta dem. Men det får ikke hjelpe, jeg mottar dem dog og er deg takknemlig. Gud gi jeg ikke trengte til deg!

Who would mourn over me if I died? …. But suddenly she turned around, pretended to think and said: When I consider it, why should I not receive your money? Why not as good now as before? I'm not so overly rich that I should for that reason…. Yes, but now you have repeatedly made sure to offer them to me in a moment when I have been upset, so you could know in advance that I would reject them. Yes You have! You have calculated it carefully, just to save your money, though you have so many of them now; do not you think I noticed it? And even if you now offer them to me again, once more, you do it to humble me and rejoice that I finally have to receive them. But it does not help, I receive them and I am grateful to you. God give I did not need to you! But as much as you know, that was not why I came here today, it was not for the money, whether you believe me or not. I can not believe you are so simple to think it…. But how much can you spare, Simonsen? My God, you should not get too close, I beg you, and now you will believe I am sincere….","“It doesn’t really matter whether I go to the doctor or not,” she went on like a stubborn child. “Who would mourn for me if I died?” Then suddenly, seeming to think it over, she changed her attitude and said: “On second thought, why shouldn’t I accept your money? Since I did before, why not now? I’m not so rich that I can afford to … Time after time I’ve refused you, as you knew I would, when I was upset. You counted on that—yes, you did! You don’t want to part with your money, though you seem to have a lot at the moment—don’t you think I’ve noticed that?

I wish to God I didn’t have to appeal to you! But you must believe me, that isn’t why I came here today. You couldn’t possibly be petty enough to think such a thing.

After all, I’m not so filthy rich that I should for that reason—. But time and again you have offered it to me, on purpose, at a moment when I was exasperated, so that you knew beforehand I would refuse it. You have, all right!

"Det forbauser meg å høre den sort snakk, sa doktoren forarget. Jeg spør meg virkelig ennu en gang om De ikke er bare en forkledd høyremann i grunnen. Her kommer den ene vitenskapelige kritikk efter den andre over teologer og teologiske bøker, den ene skribent efter den andre fremstår og skriver den prekensamling og den teologiske avhandling sønder og sammen, og allikevel gir De Dem ikke på at for eksempel den komedie med Kristi blod har verdi ennu i våre dager. Jeg forstår ikke Deres tankegang.","It amazes me to hear that black talk, said the doctor indignantly. I really wonder once again if you are not just a disguised right-winger in the ground. Here comes one scientific critique after another of theologians and theological books, one writer after another appears and writes the collection of sermons and the theological treatise to pieces, and yet you do not realize that, for example, the comedy with the blood of Christ has value even today. I do not understand your thinking.","“That kind of talk offends me!” exclaimed the doctor, scandalized. “I’m once more asking myself whether you aren’t a conservative, masquerading as something else. You make one erudite pronouncement after another about theologians and books on religion. Any number of intellectuals make mincemeat out of that myth, and still you hold on to the fable of Christ’s blood having meaning in our time. I can’t follow your line of reasoning.”","“It amazes me to hear that sort of talk,”14 the doctor said indignantly. “In fact, I’m once again asking myself whether, at bottom, you aren’t simply a disguised Conservative. Here we have one scientific critique of theologians and theological books after another, writers come along, one after the other, cutting up this or that book of sermons, this or that theological treatise, and even so you won’t admit, say, that this farce regarding Christ’s blood is no longer of any value in our time. I don’t understand your way of thinking.”"

"Hvor hun var mektig dette menneske, så ganske almindelig som hun var, med en lang flette og et forstandig hjerte! Han forstod den arme mann som ikke ville leve foruten henne, ham med stålet og det siste nei. Han forundret seg ikke lenger over ham, stakkaren hadde innstillet, og hva annet hadde han hatt å gjøre? …. Hvor hennes blå fløyelsøyne skal tindre når nu også jeg går samme vei! Men jeg elsker deg, elsker deg derfor også, ikke bare for dine dyders skyld, men også for din ondskaps. Du piner meg bare altfor meget med din overbærenhet; hvorfor tåler du at jeg har mere enn ett øye? Du skulle ta det andre, ja begge to; du skulle ikke finne deg i at jeg fikk gå i fred på gaten og at jeg har tak over hodet. Du har revet Martha bort fra meg, jeg elsker deg tross dette, og du vet at jeg elsker deg tross dette og du fniser derav, og også derfor elsker jeg deg at du fniser derav. Kan du forlange mere? Er det ikke nok? Dine lange, hvite hender, din røst, ditt lyse hår, din ånde og din sjel elsker jeg som intet annet og jeg kan ikke berge meg for det og jeg kan ikke råde ved meg mere, Herren hjelpe meg! Ja du må gjerne inderlig håne meg mere og le av meg, hva gjør det, Dagny, når jeg elsker deg? Jeg innser ikke at det gjør hverken fra eller til; for meg må du gjøre hva som faller deg inn og du er like skjønn og elskelig i mine øyne derfor, jeg tilstår det villig. Jeg har skuffet deg på en eller annen måte, du finner meg dårlig og slett, du tror meg istand til alt galt. Hvis jeg kunne hjelpe på min lave vekst ved et eller annet bedrag så ville jeg endog gjøre det. Ja, og hva så? Når du sier det så er det også således for meg, det er også godt for meg, og jeg forsikrer deg at min kjærlighet begynner å synge i meg når du sier det også. Selv om du ser ringeaktende på meg eller du vender meg ryggen uten å svare på et spørsmål fra meg eller du søker å innhente meg på gaten for å ydmyke meg, også da skjelver mitt hjerte imot deg av kjærlighet. Du må forstå meg, jeg bedrar ingen av oss nu; men det er meg også det samme om du atter ler, det forandrer ikke min følelse; således er det. Og hvis jeg fant en diamant engang så skulle den hete Dagny fordi bare ditt navn gjør meg het av glede. Men endog så vidt kan jeg gå at jeg kunne ville høre ditt navn uavlatelig, høre det nevne fra alle mennesker og dyr og alle berg og alle stjerner, at jeg var døv for alt annet og bare hørte ditt navn som en endeløs tone mot mitt øre natt og dag mitt hele liv igjennom. Jeg kunne ville innstifte en ny ed til ære for deg, en ed til bruk for alle jordens folkeslag, bare til ære for deg. Og hvis jeg syndet derved og Gud advarte meg derimot så ville jeg svare ham: skriv det på meg, før det opp, jeg betaler det med min sjel, i tidens fylde, når klokken slår ….","Where she was mighty this man, as quite ordinary as she was, with a long braid and a sensible heart! He understood the poor man who would not live without her, him with the steel and the last no. He no longer marveled at him, the poor man had stopped, and what else had he had to do? …. Where her blue velvet eye will sparkle when now I also go the same way! But I love you, therefore love you also, not only for your virtues, but also for your wickedness. You just torment me too much with your indulgence; why do you tolerate that I have more than one eye? You should take the other, yes both; you should not find yourself in that I was allowed to walk in peace on the street and that I have a roof over my head. You have torn Martha away from me, I love you in spite of this, and you know that I love you in spite of this and you giggle about it, and also therefore I love you that you giggle about it. Can you demand more? Is that not enough? I love your long, white hands, your voice, your fair hair, your breath and your soul like nothing else and I can not save myself from it and I can no longer afford it, the Lord help me! Yes, you must sincerely mock me more and laugh at me, what does it do, Dagny, when I love you? I do not realize that it does neither from nor to; for me you must do what comes to your mind and you are just as beautiful and lovable in my eyes therefore, I confess it willingly. I have disappointed you somehow, you find me bad simply, you believe me capable of everything wrong. If I could help my low growth by some deception then I would even do it. Yes, and so what? When you say that, it's so for me too, it's good for me too, and I assure you that my love begins to sing in me when you say that too. Even if you look at me contemptuously or you turn your back on me without answering a question from me or you seek to catch up with me on the street to humiliate me, even then my heart trembles against you out of love. You must understand me, I deceive none of us now; but it's the same to me if you laugh again, it does not change my feeling; thus it is. And if I ever found a diamond, it would be called Dagny because only your name makes me hot with joy. But even so far I can go that I could hear your name incessantly, hear the mention from all people and animals and all mountains and all stars, that I was deaf to everything else and only heard your name as an endless tone to my ear night and day my whole life. I could want to institute a new oath in honor of you, an oath to use for all the peoples of the earth, just in honor of you. And if I sinned thereby and God warned me against it then I would answer him: write it on me, bring it up, I pay it with my soul, in the fullness of time, when the clock strikes….","What power that girl wielded, though there was nothing striking or unusual about her— that is, unless one considered her long braid and her common sense! He sympathized with the poor man who couldn’t live without her, the one with the knife and the final no. He had given up—what else was there for him to do? How her velvety blue eyes will sparkle when I go the same way! But I love you for your wickedness too, not merely for your virtues, though you torture me to the breaking point with your condescending air. You can’t seem to stand the fact that I have more than one eye. You ought to gouge the other one out—take both of them. You won’t let me walk along the street in peace , you begrudge me a roof over my head. You’ve managed to wrest Martha from me, and I love you in spite of it. You know it, and it makes you laugh, but I love you for that too. Your scornful laugh! Can you ask for more? Isn’t that enough? Your slender white hands, your voice, your blond hair, your very breath, your soul—I love all of you as I’ve never loved anything before. I can’t help it— it’s beyond my control —God save me! You may despise and ridicule me, but, Dagny, what does it matter? I love you! I know it makes no difference. You can do anything you like with me, and you’ll still be just as beloved and just as beautiful; I gladly make this confession. I have disappointed you in some way. I’m thoroughly corrupt in your eyes —you think me capable of anything. If there were some means by which I could make myself taller, I would even resort to that. Whatever you say I accept with my whole heart; my love wells up within me as you say it. Even when you give me a scathing look, or turn your back on me without speaking, or try to overtake me in the street to humiliate me, my heart sings with love for you. I’m not trying to delude you or myself, and even if you laugh again it doesn’t matter. Nothing can change my feeling for you. If I should happen to find a diamond one day, I would call it Dagny, because the very sound of your name thrills me. I only wish that I could forever hear your name, hear it spoken by all men and beasts, by every mountain and every star. I wish I were deaf to every sound except your name ringing in my ears day and night for the rest of my life. I would like to introduce a new oath that would invoke your name—an oath that all the peoples on this earth would swear by. If this were blasphemy and God admonished me for it, I would say: “Inscribe it in my ledger, I’ll pay for it with my soul when the time comes, when the clock strikes …”","What power that woman had,1 quite ordinary as she was, with her long braid and her wise heart! He understood the poor man who refused to live without her, the one with the steel and the final no. He was no longer surprised at him; the poor devil had quit, what else could he have done? ... How her blue velvet eyes will sparkle when I soon take the same path! But I love you, I love you for that too, not only for your virtues, but also for your malice. If anything, I suffer all too much by your being so indulgent with me; why do you tolerate that I have more than one eye? You should take one of them, well, both, why not? You shouldn’t put up with my being allowed to walk the street in peace and having a roof over my head. You have torn Martha away from me, but I love you in spite of it, and you know I love you in spite of it; it makes you snicker at me, and I also love you because you snicker at me. Can you ask for more? Isn’t that enough?

You may mock me to your heart’s content and laugh at me, I don’t mind; what does it matter, Dagny, since I love you? I don’t see that it makes any difference; as far as I’m concerned, you can do whatever strikes your fancy, you’ll still be just as beautiful and lovable in my eyes, I willingly admit it. Somehow or other I’ve disappointed you ; you regard me as wicked and mean and believe me capable of anything. If I could add to my low stature by some deception or other, I would even do that. Well, what about it? If you say so, it’s true for me as well, and a good thing; I assure you that my love begins to sing within me when you say it. Even if you look disdainfully at me or turn your back on me without answering my question, or you try to overtake me in the street to humiliate me, even so my heart thrills with love for you. Try to understand, I’m deluding neither you nor myself: it doesn’t really matter to me if you laugh again, it doesn’t change my feelings. That’s the way it is. And if I should find a diamond some day it would be called Dagny, because your name is enough to make me warm with joy. I would even go so far as to wish to hear your name perpetually, hear it spoken by all men and beasts, by every mountain and every star, as to wish I were deaf to everything else and only heard your name as an endless note in my ear night and day all my life long. I would want to institute a new oath in your name, an oath that all the peoples on earth would swear by, in your honor. And if that would be a sin and God warned me against it, I would answer him: charge it to my account, enter it on the books, I’ll pay for it with my soul in the fullness of time, when the clock strikes...."
"Ja svarer Nagel. Men han reiser seg ikke og viser heller ingen tegn til utålmodighet, tvertimot, han setter seg bedre tilrette og spør: De kjente kanskje også den Karlsen som man fant død her borte i skogen forleden? Var det ikke en sørgelig tildragelse?","Yes, Nagel answers. But he does not get up and shows no signs of impatience, on the contrary, he settles down better and asks: Maybe they also knew the Karlsen who was found dead here in the forest the other day? Was it not a sad event?","“Yes,” Nagel said. But he didn’t get up, nor did he show any sign of impatience. On the contrary, he settled back in his chair and asked: “Did you know this man named Karlsen who was found dead in the woods the other day? An awful business, wasn’t it?”","“Yes,” Nagel answers.

"Jeg har ikke glemt din fødselsdag, sa hun; jeg husker den alltid. Du vet ikke hvor jeg gråter for deg mangen natt når jeg ikke kan sove bare for tanker …. Gutten min, du har din samme røde munn ennu! Jeg tenkte på så meget ombord, jeg tenkte: mon hans munn er like rød ennu? …. Hvor dine øyne flakker omkring! Du er vel ikke utålmodig, vel? Ellers er du den samme, men dine øyne flakker virkelig som om du sitter og pønser på å bli av med meg snarest mulig. La meg heller sitte på stolen ved siden av deg, det synes du visst bedre om; ikke sant? Jeg har så meget, så meget å tale med deg om og jeg må skynde meg, for snart går dampskipet, og nu sitter du bare og forvirrer meg med dine likegyldige miner. Hva skal jeg si for å få deg til å høre nøye på meg? Du er i grunnen ikke det spor takknemlig for at jeg har husket denne dag og er kommet hitopp …. Har du fått mange blomster? Ja det har du vel. Fru Stenersen har vel også husket deg? Si meg, hvorledes ser hun ut, denne fru Stenersen, som du går og er agronom for? Hahaha, nei din make! …. Jeg ville også ha bragt noen blomster med til deg hvis jeg hadde hatt råd til det; men jeg var for fattig nettopp nu …. Herregud, hør nu litt på meg disse par fattige minutter, vil du ikke det? Hvor dog alt er forandret nu! Kan du huske engang – men det husker du naturligvis ikke, og det er unødig å minne deg om det; men engang kjente du meg i lang avstand bare på min hattefjær og kom løpende såsnart du så den. Du vet meget godt at det er sant, gjør du ikke? Det hendte engang på festningsvollen. Men nu husker jeg ikke lenger hvorfor jeg omtaler dette med hattefjæren, herregud, jeg har glemt hva jeg skulle bruke det til imot deg skjønt det var et godt argument …. Hva nu? Hvorfor springer du opp?","I have not forgotten your birthday, she said; I always remember it. You do not know where I cry for you many nights when I can not sleep just for thoughts…. My boy, you still have your same red mouth! I thought about so much on board, I thought: is his mouth still as red? …. Where your eyes wander around! You're not impatient, are you? Otherwise you are the same, but your eyes really flicker as if you are sitting and trying to get rid of me as soon as possible. Let me rather sit on the chair next to you, you probably like that better; right? I have so much, so much to talk to you about and I have to hurry, because soon the steamship leaves, and now you just sit and confuse me with your indifferent faces. What should I say to make you listen carefully to me? You are basically not that trace grateful that I have remembered this day and have come here…. Have you received many flowers? Yes, you have. Mrs. Stenersen must have remembered you, too? Tell me, what does she look like, this Mrs. Stenersen, for whom you are an agronomist? Hahaha, no your make! …. I would also have brought some flowers for you if I could afford it; but I was too poor right now…. My God, listen to me these few poor minutes, will you not? Where however everything has changed now! Can you even remember - but of course you do not remember, and it is unnecessary to remind you of that; but once you knew me from a long distance only on my hat feather and came running as soon as you saw it. You know very well that it's true, do not you? It once happened on the fortress rampart. But now I no longer remember why I mention this with the hat feather, my God, I forgot what I was going to use it for against you even though it was a good argument…. What now? Why are you running up?","“I didn’t forget your birthday,” she said. “I never will. You’ve no idea how often I cry over you at night, when I can’t sleep for thinking of you. My dearest, you still have the same red lips! I thought about so many things on board ship—I wondered whether your lips were still as red. How your eyes wander! You’re annoyed, aren’t you? You haven’t changed at all. But your eyes are wandering, as if you were trying to think of some way to get rid of me as fast as possible. I think you’d be more comfortable if I sat next to you. I’ve got so many things to talk to you about, and I have to make it quick because the boat will be leaving very soon. But your air of indifference upsets me. What can I say to make you listen to me? You don’t appreciate my coming here, remembering your birthday… . Did you get a lot of flowers? I’m sure you did! Mrs. Stenersen must have remembered you! Tell me, this Mrs. Stenersen for whom you’re playing agronomist—what does she look like? You haven’t changed a bit! I would have bought you some flowers too, if I’d had the money, but I’m in a tight spot at the moment. For God’s sake, won’t you listen to me these few minutes? How changed everything is! Do you remember— but of course you don’t—how you once recognized me from a distance by the feather in my hat and you came running to me? You must remember that! It happened one day on the Ramparts—but now I can’t remember why I mentioned the feather. I’ve forgotten the point I was going to make, but I was going to use it against you. What’s the matter? Why do you jump up like that?”","“I didn’t forget your birthday,” she said, “I always remember it. You have no idea how often I weep over you at night, when I can’t sleep for just thinking.... My dear boy, you still have the same red lips! I thought about so many things on board; I wondered, Are his lips just as red still? ... How your eyes wander! You aren’t getting impatient, are you? Otherwise you are the same; but your eyes do wander, as if you were trying to figure out how to get rid of me as soon as possible. Why don’t I sit on the chair next to you, you will like that better, won’t you? I’ve got so much, so much, to talk to you about, and I have to hurry up, because the steamer will be leaving very soon, and right now you’re simply confusing me with your indifferent air. What can I say to make you sit up and listen to me? You aren’t the least bit grateful that I remembered your birthday and came up here.... Did you get lots of flowers? I trust you did. Mrs. Stenersen remembered you too, didn’t she? Tell me, this Mrs. Stenersen, for whom you serve as agronomist, what does she look like? Ha-ha-ha, what a man! ... I would have brought you some flowers too, if I had been able to afford it; but I’m too poor right now.... Ye gods, why don’t you listen to me these few paltry minutes, won’t you, please! How everything has changed! Do you remember how once— but you obviously don’t, and it’s pointless to remind you of it— well, once you recognized me a long way off simply by the feather in my hat, and as soon as you saw it you came running. You know quite well this is true, don’t you? It happened one day on the Ramparts.1 But now I can’t remember anymore why I mentioned that about the feather. Oh dear, I’ve forgotten how I was going to use it against you, though it was a good argument.... What now? Why jump up like that?”"

He's a naval officer, he's gone to Malta - was not it to Malta?","“Miss Kielland’s fiancé has just gone to sea again,” said the hostess, addressing herself to Nagel. “He’s a naval officer; he went to Malta— wasn’t it Malta?”","“You see, Miss Kielland’s fiancé has gone to sea again,” Mrs. Stenersen told Nagel. “He’s a naval officer, he’s gone to Malta— wasn’t it Malta?”"
Til hans store forundring reiste Dagny seg også da han var like på nippet til å gå. Hun sa:,"To his great astonishment, Dagny also got up when he was about to leave. She said:",He was astonished to see Dagny also getting up as he was about to leave. “You’ve all been telling such horrible stories that I feel all shaken.,"To his great surprise Dagny also stood up as he was about to leave. She said, “You’re all telling such creepy stories that I’m scared stiff, too."
"Men herregud, ta den – ta den!","But my God, take it - take it!",she cried.,Martha cried.
"Men jeg beregner det, ja jeg beregner dette også. De skal selv innse det. Når jeg bekjenner, går her og bekjenner, så risikerer jeg egentlig ikke noe ved det, ikke meget risikerer jeg. Det er nemlig for det første ikke sikkert at den jeg bekjenner for tror meg. De for eksempel tror meg i dette øyeblikk ikke. Men hva er følgen derav? Jo derav er følgen den at jeg tjener dobbelt, jeg tjener enormt, min gevinst vokser som en lavine, min storhet blir høy som et berg. Nå, men for det andre vil jeg i ethvert tilfelle gå ut av spekulasjonen med profitt, også om De trodde meg. De ryster på hodet? Nei gjør ikke det; jeg forsikrer Dem, jeg har brukt denne fremgangsmåte nokså ofte og har stadig vunnet på den. Trodde De virkelig at min bekjennelse var sannferdig så ville De iallfall bli aldeles slagen av min åpenhet. De ville si: vel, han har snytt meg, men han forteller det bakefter og det uten å behøve det; hans frekkhet er mystisk, han skyr absolutt intet, han sperrer meg formelig veien med sine tilståelser! Kort sagt: jeg driver Dem til å stirre på meg, jeg hisser Deres nysgjerrighet til å beskjeftige seg med meg, jeg får Dem til å steile. Det er jo ikke mere enn et minutt siden De selv sa: Nei jeg forstår meg ikke på Dem! Se, dette sa De fordi De hadde forsøkt å studere meg ut, – noe som igjen kildrer meg, ja som likefrem er søtt for meg. I alle tilfelle tar jeg altså min profitt hjem hva enten De tror eller ikke tror.","But I calculate it, yes I calculate this too. They must realize it themselves. When I confess, go here and confess, I do not really risk anything about it, I do not risk much. First of all, it is not certain that the one I confess to believes me. For example, they do not believe me at the moment. But what is the consequence of that? The consequence of this is that I earn double, I earn enormously, my gain grows like an avalanche, my greatness becomes high like a mountain. Now, but secondly, I will in any case leave the speculation with profit, even if you believed me. They shake their heads? No do not; I assure you, I have used this method quite often and have constantly won on it. If you really believed that my confession was true, you would at least be completely struck by my openness. They would say: well, he has cheated on me, but he tells it afterwards and without having to; his impudence is mysterious, he shuns absolutely nothing, he formally blocks my way with his confessions! In short: I drive you to stare at me, I excite your curiosity to deal with me, I make you stare. It's not more than a minute since you yourself said: No I do not understand you! Behold, you said this because you had tried to study me out - something which again tickles me, yes which is downright sweet to me. In any case, I take my profit home, whether you believe it or not.","He was silent for a moment, and then he said, without wavering: “But, on the contrary, it’s part of my scheme. I’ll try to make you understand what I mean. I’m risking nothing if I reveal myself to you, as I just did—at least, not very much. I can’t be sure that the person I open up to will believe me. At the moment you don’t believe me, but even so, in the end I will gain doubly, enormously; I will reap rich rewards and my soul will soar to the mountain tops. Even if you did believe me, I would come out on top. You shake your head in disbelief? I assure you, I’ve operated this way quite a number of times, and it always works. Even if you believed what I just confessed to you, you would still be taken aback by my candor. You would say to yourself: ‘He deceived me, but he confessed afterwards, though there was no reason for him to do so. His audacity mystifies me; his self-abasement confounds me!’ What it really amounts to is that I force you to notice me; I arouse your curiosity and make you pay attention to me; I shock you into taking notice. A minute ago, you said you couldn’t figure me out. You said it because you were thinking about me, which thrills and delights me. I do have a lot to gain, whether you believe me or not.”","But I do calculate it, oh yes, I calculate that too, as you’ll come to realize. When I confess, as I’m doing right now, I really don’t risk anything by it, not much anyway. You see, in the first place I can’t be sure that the person I confess to will believe me. You, for one, don’t believe me at this moment. And what’s the consequence? Well, the consequence is that I make a double profit; I profit enormously, my prize grows like an avalanche, my greatness becomes mountain-high. Yes. But in the second place, I would come away from the speculation with profit in any case, even if you believed me. You’re shaking your head? Oh, please, don’t; I’ve acted on this assumption often enough, I assure you, and I’ve always gained by it. If you really believed that my confession was truthful, you would at least be quite struck by my candor. You would say, Well, he has fooled me, but he tells me so afterward, and without any need to; his impudence is mysterious, he shuns absolutely nothing, he positively bars my way with his admissions! In short, I force you to stare hard at me, I excite your curiosity to occupy itself with me, I make you bridle. No more than a minute ago you said yourself, ‘I just don’t understand you!’ Now, you said this because you had tried to puzzle me out—which again tickles me, feels directly sweet to me, in fact. So, at all events I bring my profit home whether you believe me or not.”"
"Ja fra Helsingfors. Det vil si fra Helsingfors sist. Jeg er agronom, jeg har vært der en kort tid ved skolen.","Yes, from Helsinki. That is, from Helsinki last.

"Nei, svarte Dagny, hr. Nagel tør jeg ikke mere gå sammen med! Han er så full av innfall. Han har – mellom oss sagt – endog bedt meg om et stevnemøte engang. Virkelig sant! Under et tre, sa han, et stort aspetre, der og der står det! Nei hr. Nagel er meg for uberegnelig! For nylig krevet han meg høyt og dyrt efter et par skjorter som min kjæreste skal ha lovet Grøgaard engang. Og Grøgaard selv vet slett ikke noe om det hele! Ikke sant, Grøgaard? Hahaha, det er høyst besynderlig!","No, replied Dagny, mr. I no longer dare to go along with Nagel! He's so full of whims. He has - between us said - even asked me for a date once. Really true!

Recently he demanded me loud and expensive for a pair of shirts that my boyfriend should have promised Grøgaard once. And Grøgaard himself does not know anything about it at all! Isn't that right, Grøgaard? Hahaha, that's very strange!","“No, I don’t dare walk with Mr. Nagel any more. One never knows what he’ll do next. This is strictly between you and me, but once he actually asked me to meet him in secret! It’s true—under a tree—a big aspen at a certain spot in the woods. No, Mr. Nagel is too unpredictable. Just now he actually asked me in all seriousness about a couple of shirts my fiancé once promised Grøgaard. Grøgaard doesn’t know a thing about it, do you, Grøgaard? It’s all very odd!”","“No,” Dagny replied, “I don’t dare walk with Mr. Nagel anymore. He’s so full of whims. Between you and me, he even asked me for a rendezvous once. It’s the truth! ‘ Under a tree,’ he said, ‘a big aspen, it stands in such and such a place’! No, Mr. Nagel is too unpredictable for me! Just now he solemnly pressed me for a pair of shirts which my fiance is supposed to have promised Grøgaard at one time. And Grøgaard himself has no idea what it’s all about! Isn’t that so, Grøgaard? Ha-ha-ha, it’s all very odd!”"
"Det kan jeg ikke for mitt tilfelles skyld, jeg duger ikke til å trekke.

Men det går ikke dårlig med en sekk heller.","I can not for my own sake, I am not good enough to draw. I can withstand a lot of weight when I load myself with care, but I can not hang in and pull and exert myself in that way, so I wear myself out and fall on my nose with great pain. But it does not go bad with a backpack either.","“I can’t because of my injury. I can carry a lot of weight if I’m careful, but I can’t push or pull anything. If I do, I strain myself and fall flat on my face in great pain. But carrying one sack isn’t so bad.”","“I can’t because of my handicap, I’m no good at pulling. I can withstand considerable weight, if I load myself with care, but I cannot go all out and pull and strain that way; if I did, I would overtax myself and fall flat on my face in great pain.

I’ve never heard of anything so insane! How could you be sure that I would ever find out what really happened? Tell me—no, don’t—it would only be another lie! What horrible things you’ve been saying! When you make such careful calculations and fabricate your story to suit your ends, and then undo everything by confessing your deviousness—or deceit, as you call it —what am I to think!

"Som et lyn slår det ned i ham at glasset allikevel hadde vært i fremmede hender. Han stanser og knipser uvilkårlig i fingrene. Ja det var ikke til å ta feil av, Minutten hadde hatt det hos seg en hel natt.

Da Minutten igjen begynte å ryste og hans øyne så angstfulle og rådville ut i alle retninger fortsetter Nagel:,"When the Minute again began to shake and his eyes looked anxious and bewildered in all directions, Nagel continues:","As The Midget had started to tremble, his eyes terrified, darting wildly in every direction, Nagel continued: “You don’t open your mouth; you’re still playing the part.","When Miniman begins to shake, his eyes casting anxious and perplexed looks in every direction, Nagel continues, “You don’t say a word, you don’t give yourself away."
"De nevnte Ibsen, vedble Nagel fremdeles like opphisset og uten at Ibsens navn var blitt nevnt. Efter hans mening var det bare én dikter i Norge, og det var ikke Ibsen. Nei det var det ikke. Man talte om Ibsen som tenker; var det ikke best å skjelne litt mellom populært resonnement og virkelig tenkning? Man talte om Ibsens berømmelse, slo oss om ørene med hans mot; var det ikke best å skjelne litt mellom det teoretiske og det praktiske mot, mellom den uegennyttige, hensynsløse revolusjonstrang og den huslige opprørsdristighet? Det ene stråler i livet, det andre forbløffer i teateret. Den norske forfatter som ikke pustet seg opp og førte en knappenål som en lanse var jo ikke en norsk forfatter; en eller annen grindstolpe måtte man finne å aksle seg imot, ellers ble man ikke betraktet som en modig maur. Ja det var virkelig såre fornøyelig å se til på frastand. Det var nemlig en slagtummel og et mannemot som i en napoleonsk trefning, men en fare og en risiko som i en fransk duell. Hehehe …. Nei en mann som ville revoltere han fikk ikke være et lite skrivende kuriosum, et blott og bart litterært begrep for tyskere, men et sprellende, virkende menneske i livets tummel. Ibsens revolusjonsmot skulle såvisst aldri føre sin mann ut på tynn is; dette med torpedoen under arken var en stakkars departementsteori, sammenlignet med den levende og blussende bedrift. Nå, forresten var kanskje det ene like så godt som det andre, alldenstund vi lå nesegrus for et slikt fruentimmerarbeide som det å sitte og skrive bøker for folk. Om det så var aldri så usselt hadde det iallfall såpass verdi som Leo Tolstojs uforskammede filosofiske vås. Fan ta det hele.","They mentioned Ibsen, Nagel remained just as excited and without Ibsen's name having been mentioned. In his opinion, there was only one poet in Norway, and that was not Ibsen. No it was not. There was talk of Ibsen thinking; was it not best to distinguish a little between popular reasoning and real thinking? People talked about Ibsen's fame, hit us on the ears with his courage; was it not best to distinguish a little between the theoretical and the practical courage, between the selfless, ruthless urge for revolution and the domestic boldness of rebellion? One radiates life, the other amazes in the theater. The Norwegian author who did not breathe and carried a pin like a lance was not a Norwegian author; one had to find a gatepost to shoulder, otherwise one was not considered a brave ant. Yes it was really very enjoyable to watch from a distance. It was a tumult and a manly courage as in a Napoleonic clash, but a danger and a risk as in a French duel. Hehehe…. No, a man who wanted to revolt, he was not allowed to be a little writing curiosity, a mere literary concept for Germans, but a bouncy, active man in the tumult of life. Ibsen's courageous revolution should certainly never lead her husband out on thin ice; this with the torpedo under the ark was a poor departmental theory, compared to the living and flaring enterprise. Well, by the way, maybe one was just as good as the other, all the while we were nosy for such a lady's job as sitting and writing books for people. If it was never so wretched, it would at least have as much value as Leo Tolstoy's shameless philosophical prowess. Fan take it all.","“You mentioned Ibsen,” Nagel continued, in the same state of agitation, though no one had mentioned the name. In Nagel’s opinion there was only one poet in Norway, and it was not Ibsen! Ibsen was known as a philosopher—but wouldn’t it be to the point to distinguish between vox populi thinking and philosophy? People were always talking about Ibsen’s fame; his courage was always being drummed into you. But was there no difference between theoretical courage and courage put to the test? between an altruistic and passionate desire for reform and plain domestic upheaval? One is a source of inspiration; the other merely plays on our emotions as in the theater. The Norwegian writer who didn’t give himself airs and wield a pen as if it were a lance was not a bona fide Norwegian writer. A true Norwegian must have issues and causes to pit himself against if he wanted to be thought of as having courage and guts. It was really very funny if one cared to look at it with detachment. The causes and issues engendered as much fanfare and manipulating as one of Napoleon’s battles, but the element of risk was no greater than in a French duel! Ha ha! No, a man who wanted to revolt couldn’t be a little scribbler with a literary penchant for the Germans; he had to be a vital being, caught up in the turmoil of life. Ibsen’s spirit of revolution would certainly never bring a man onto thin ice! All that business about torpedoing the ark was a bureaucratic platitude compared to vigorous action. Well, when all was said and done, perhaps one was no worse than the other: we seem to venerate the kind of work best suited to women—just sitting around writing books for people. It was all empty and meaningless, but it had at least as much value as Leo Tolstoy’s presumptuous philosophical ramblings. To hell with all of it!","“You mentioned Ibsen,” Nagel went on, still as agitated and without Ibsen ’s name having been mentioned. In his opinion Norway had only one poet, and it was not Ibsen. No, it was not. People spoke about Ibsen as a thinker, but hadn’t we better distinguish between popular argument and real thought? People talked about Ibsen’s fame and assaulted our ears with his courage; hadn’t we better distinguish between theoretical and practical courage, between a ruthless, unselfish revolutionary urge and the daring of domestic revolt? The former shines forth in life, the latter astounds in the theater. A Norwegian author who didn’t puff himself up and brandish a pin like a lance was not a Norwegian author, of course; you would have to find some gatepost or other to square up to, otherwise you weren’t seen as a plucky fellow. It was really a very amusing sight if viewed from a distance. There was a turmoil of battle and a show of true mettle as in a Napoleonic engagement, while the danger and risk were those of a French duel. Heh-heh-heh.... No, a man who wanted to rebel20 couldn’t be just a scribbling curiosity, a merely literary concept for Germans, but had to be an active, kicking human being in the turmoil of life. Ibsen’s revolutionary courage would certainly never lead him onto thin ice; that bit about putting a torpedo under the ark was a pitiful bureaucratic theory, as compared to the living, flaming deed. Oh well, come to that, perhaps one thing was no worse than another 21 as long as we groveled before the sort of womanish work involved in writing books for people. But however paltry it might be, it was at least as much worth as Leo Tolstoy’s22 impertinent philosophical drivel. The devil take it all!"

"Det lå to blomster på bunnen av graven, to hvite blomster, – De skulle ikke vite hvor de er kommet fra?","There were two flowers at the bottom of the grave, two white flowers, - They should not know where they came from?","After a moment’s silence, Nagel said: “Two flowers were lying at the bottom of the grave, two white flowers.","After a brief silence Nagel said, “There were two flowers on the bottom of the grave, two white flowers—you wouldn’t know where they came from, would you?”"
"Nu hadde Nagel fått stolen i hendene, han vendte og dreiet den til alle sider og overså den på hvert punkt. Den var uten forgylling, bare med en eneste forsiring ovenpå ryggstykket, et slags krone, skåret av mahogni. Ryggen var forøvrig opphakket med kniv. På rammen om setet var på flere steder blitt karvet tobakk; merkene sås ennu.","Now Nagel had the chair in his hands, he turned and turned it to all sides and overlooked it at every point. It was without gilding, only with a single decoration on top of the back piece, a kind of crown, cut from mahogany. The back was otherwise chopped with a knife. Tobacco had been carved in several places on the frame around the seat; the marks were still seen.","Nagel was examining the chair, turning it around and carefully looking over every detail. The gilding was gone, and the only decoration was a sort of crown on the backrest, carved in mahogany. Someone had hacked at it with a knife, and the woodwork around the seat bore marks of having been used for cutting tobacco.","By this time Nagel was holding the chair in his hand, twisting and turning it every way and inspecting it at every point. It had no gilding, only a single ornament on its back, a sort of coronet carved out of mahogany. Incidentally, the back had been cut up with a knife. The frame around the seat had been used for shredding tobacco in several places; the marks could still be seen."
Nei men …. slik gikk det jo ikke til? Jeg har hørt det på en annen måte.,"No but …. that's not how it went, was it? I have heard it in a different way.","But Dagny stopped abruptly, looked him straight in the eyes, and said, utterly astonished: “ But that isn’t the way it happened!

"Denne litt ondskapsfulle oppmerksomhet gjorde ham allikevel livligere enn han hadde vært. Han bad henne drikke et glass med og hun satte seg virkelig med ett skjønt hun hadde dyktig travelt. Han takket henne for hennes elskverdighet, komplimenterte henne for hennes drakt, ble henrykt over en gammel sølje hun bar i sin halslinning. Hun tok seg godt ut; det lange, aristokratiske ansikt med den store nese var overmåte fint, nesten sykelig fint, og det vekslet ikke, gjorde ingen nervøse bevegelser. Hun talte med behersket ro, man hadde en følelse av trygghet i hennes selskap, det var damen, kvinnen.","This slightly vicious attention still made him livelier than he had been. He asked her to have a drink with her and she really sat down with one though she was busy. He thanked her for her kindness, complimented her on her costume, was delighted by an old brooch she wore around her neckline. She looked good; the long, aristocratic face with the big nose was exceedingly fine, almost morbidly fine, and it did not change, made no nervous movements. She spoke with restrained calm, one had a feeling of security in her company, it was the lady, the woman.","This somewhat impudent remark brought him to life. He asked her to join him and she sat down, though she was very busy. He was appreciative when she accepted, complimented her on her dress, and was fascinated by an old filigree brooch she was wearing. She was a handsome girl; her long, aristocratic face with its prominent nose was delicately chiseled—it looked almost fragile—and there was no mobility in her face, no change of expression. She spoke quietly and with reserve. One felt comfortable in her presence. She was a woman and a lady.","While rather malicious, this compliment nevertheless made him livelier than he had been so far. He asked her to have a drink with him, and she sat down then and there, though she was very busy. He thanked her for her courtesy, complimented her on her costume, and was delighted by an old filigree brooch she was wearing on her neck band. She made a good appearance: her long aristocratic face with its rather large nose was extremely fine, almost morbidly fine, and it never changed; there were no nervous tics. She spoke with quiet composure, her presence conveyed a sense of security; she was a lady, the epitome of woman."
"Nei, svarte Dagny.","No, Dagny replied.","“No,” said Dagny.","“No,” Dagny replied."
Kan du se byen?,Can you see the city?,“But all she said was: ‘Can you see the town from here?’,"“But she merely replied, ‘Can you see the town?’"
"Ja hva jeg trenger! …. Gud, dampskipet går vel ikke ifra meg? …. Jeg trenger kanskje meget, men …. kanskje flere hundre kroner, men ….","Yes what I need! …. God, the steamship is not leaving me, is it? …. I may need a lot, but…. maybe several hundred kroner, but….","“How much do I need? Good Lord, I won’t miss the boat, will I? I need a lot … maybe several hundred crowns, but …”","“Oh, what I need! ... Good Lord, I won’t miss the steamer, will I? ... I may need a lot, but—maybe several hundred kroner, but—”"
"Ja, sa han, hun ville advare Dem mot å gå hit til oss.","Yes, he said, she would warn you not to come here to us.","“She only wanted to warn you about coming to see us,” he said.","“Sure,” he said, “she wanted to warn you against coming to see us.”"
"Han så på henne. Hennes hår var hvitt, men hennes smil var ungt og fyrig og hennes tenner deilige. Da hun lo ble hennes øyne blanke av vann. For en sortøyet gammel jomfru! Nagel fortrakk ikke en mine.","He looked at her. Her hair was white, but her smile was young and fiery and her teeth delicious. As she laughed, her eyes glistened with water. What a black-eyed old virgin! Nagel did not prefer a mine.","He looked at her. Although her hair was white, her smile was the bright smile of a young woman, and her teeth were exquisite. When she smiled, her eyes glistened. What a stunning, dark-eyed spinster! Nagel’s expression did not change.","she said. He looked at her. Her hair was white, but her smile was youthful and spirited, and her teeth were fine. When she laughed her eyes grew moist and glistened. What a black-eyed old maid! Nagel didn’t move a muscle."
Ja sa jeg det så ber jeg om unnskyldning.,"Yes, I said that, so I apologize.","“If I said that, I shouldn’t have.”","“Oh, if I said so, I apologize.”"
Pause.,Break.,Pause.,Pause.
Og han tok stolen til seg.,And he took the chair.,"“I hope you have no objection to my taking the chair with me now,” he said, laying hands on it.",And he picked up the chair.
Ånei jeg har holdt opp med det.,"No, I've stopped doing that.","“Oh, no, I’ve given that up,” Nagel replied in an offhand manner.","Nagel replied nonchalantly, “Oh no, I’m through with that.”"
Da han ennu hadde gått noen skritt frem reiser seg plutselig et menneske opp fra veikanten og gir seg til å gå foran ham. Det var Dagny; den lyse flette hang nedover hennes rygg utenpå regnkåpen.,"When he had gone a few steps further, a man suddenly rose from the roadside and began to walk in front of him. It was Dagny; the light braid hung down her back on top of the raincoat.","When he had walked a few paces, a figure suddenly darted out from the side of the road and started to walk ahead of him; it was Dagny.

"Dagny ble rød, lo av forlegenhet og svarte:","Dagny turned red, laughed with embarrassment and replied:","Dagny blushed, and answered laughingly: “Yes, of course.","Dagny blushed, laughed shyly and replied, “Certainly I’m thinking about him."
Nei.,No.,“No.”,“Good.
"Det faller ham noe inn, han spør:","Something comes to his mind, he asks:",Suddenly something occurred to him and he said: “Am I perhaps being too hard on you?,"Something occurs to him and he asks, “Do you feel I’m treating you badly?"
"Hans gode stemning vedvarer og han blir vekk i lyse tanker. Nyss hadde han hatt et skarpt oppgjør med Minutten og det var allerede halvt utvisket av hans erindring, han husket det bare som fra en drøm. Minutten hadde ikke villet motta hans brev; men hadde han ikke også et brev til Martha? I sin trang til å meddele andre av sin overstrømmende glede ville han nu gjøre en utvei til å få brevet avsted. Hvorledes skulle han bære seg ad? Han undersøkte sin lommebok og fant brevet. Han torde vel ikke i all hemmelighet sende det til Dagny? Nei han torde ikke sende det til Dagny. Han tenkte efter og ville absolutt ha brevet avsted straks; det inneholdt et par sedler, intet brev, ikke et ord; han kunne kanskje be doktor Stenersen besørge det? Og tilfreds med denne tanke går han til doktor Stenersen.","His good mood persists and he disappears in bright thoughts. Recently he had had a sharp confrontation with the Minute and it was already half erased by his memory, he remembered it only as from a dream. The minute had not wanted to receive his letter; but did he not also have a letter to Martha? In his urge to share his overflowing joy with others, he now wanted to find a way to get the letter out. How should he behave? He examined his wallet and found the letter. He did not dare secretly send it to Dagny, did he? No, he did not dare send it to Dagny. He thought about it and would definitely have sent the letter away immediately; it contained a few notes, no letter, not a word; maybe he could ask Dr. Stenersen to take care of it? And satisfied with this thought, he goes to Dr. Stenersen.","His jubilant mood didn’t leave him, and his mind wandered off in a myriad of happy thoughts. The scene he had had with The Midget was blurred and almost erased from his memory. The Midget had refused to accept his letter, but he had one for Martha also. In his desire to share his elation, he looked about for someone to deliver it to her. But how? He opened his wallet and found the letter. Couldn’t he send it to Dagny, marked confidential? No, that wouldn’t do. He kept turning it over in his mind. He was determined to get the letter off immediately. Actually, it wasn’t really a letter; it was just an envelope containing some money—no note, no word. Perhaps he could ask Dr. Stenersen to take care of it? And convinced that that was the best way, he went to see Dr. Stenersen.","His good mood persists and he is lost in cheerful thoughts. The harsh showdown he had had with Miniman recently was already half erased from his memory; it seemed like something from a dream. Miniman had refused to accept his letter. But hadn’t he also a letter for Martha? In his desire to share his exuberant joy with others, he now decided to find a way of getting the letter sent. How should he go about it? He checked his wallet and found the letter. He didn’t dare send it secretly to Dagny, did he? No, he didn’t dare send it to Dagny. After a moment’s thought, he was determined to get the letter off at once; it contained a couple of bank notes, no message, not a word. Maybe he could ask Dr. Stenersen to take care of it? And happy at this thought, he goes to see Dr. Stenersen."
"Hysj, du snakker for høyt nu også, Gudrun. Han hørte deg, jo han gjorde, han vendte seg. Men du, la du merke til …. når han ble avbrutt gjorde det ham ikke det spor heftig; ikke sant? Han så nesten sørgmodig på oss alle. Tenk nu begynner jeg å angre på det vi sitter her og sladrer på ham. Ja fortell Deres historie fra keiserbesøket, fullmektig.","Hush, you're talking too loud now too, Gudrun. He heard you, yes he did, he turned. But you, did you notice…. when he was interrupted it did not make him that trail violent; right? He looked at us all almost sadly. Think now I'm starting to regret what we're sitting here gossiping about him. Yes, tell your story from the emperor's visit, attorney.","“Gudrun, you’re talking too loud again. I’m sure he heard you, because he turned around. But did you happen to notice that when he was interrupted he didn’t show the least sign of impatience? He just looked sad.

He heard you, yes, he did, he turned around. But did you notice—when he was interrupted, he never lost his temper, did he? He just gave us all an almost sorrowful look.
