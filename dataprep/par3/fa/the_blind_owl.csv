ناگهان یک قوه مافوق بشر در خودم حس کردم: پیشانیم خنک شد، بلند شد معبای زردی که داشتم روی دوشم انداختم، شال گردنم را دوسه بار دور سرم پیچیدم، و پاورچین به اطاق آن لکاته رفتم -دم در که رسیدم اطاق در تاریکی غلیظی غرق شده بود. بدقت گوش دادم صدایش راشنیدم میگفت:,"Suddenly I felt a superhuman force in me: my forehead cooled down, I got up, threw the yellow robe I had on my shoulder, wrapped my scarf around my head twice, and went to the room with that pawn - when I arrived, the room was drowned in thick darkness. have been. I listened carefully and heard his voice say:","Suddenly I felt within me a superhuman force. My forehead grew cool. I rose, threw a yellow cloak over my shoulders and wrapped my scarf two or three times around my neck. I bent down, went into the closet and took out the bone-handled knife which I had hidden in the box. Then I went on tiptoe towards the bitch’s room. When I reached the door I saw that the room was in complete darkness. I listened and heard her voice saying, “Have you come? Take your scarf off.” Her voice had a pleasant quality, as it had had in her childhood. It reminded me of the unconscious murmuring of someone who is dreaming. I myself had heard this voice in the past when I was in a deep sleep. Was she dreaming? Her voice was husky and thick.","I felt a superhuman power in myself, my forehead became cool. I got up, I took the yellow cloak I had and placed it on my shoulders, I wrapped the scarf several times around my head, I bent over, I went and took out the bone-handled jackknife that I had hidden in the box and tiptoed, tiptoed, in the direction of the whore ’s room.—When I reached her door, I saw that her room was drowning in a thick darkness. I listened carefully and I heard her voice say, “You came?"
و بی آنکه منتظر جواب من بشود با بیلچه و کلنگی که همراه داشت مشغول کندن شد. من چمدان را زمین گذاشتم و سرجای خودم مات ایستاده بودم. پیرمرد با پشت خمیده و چالاکی آدم کهنه کاری مشغول بود، در ضمن کند و کو چیزی شبیه کوزهء لعابی پیدا کرد آنرا در دستمال چرکی پیچیده بلند شد و گفت:,"And without waiting for my answer, he started digging with the shovel and pickaxe he had with him. I dropped my suitcase and stood motionless in my seat. The old man was busy with the old man's bent back and agility.","Without waiting for an answer, he began at once to dig with a small spade and a pick which he had brought with him. I set the suitcase down and stood beside it in a kind of torpor. The old man, bent double, was working away with the deftness of one who was used to the job.","he said. And without waiting for my reply, he started digging with a trowel and pick that he had with him. I placed the suitcase on the ground and stood there astounded. With his hunched-over back and the nimbleness of an experienced worker, the old man toiled away."
پلکهای چشمم که پایین می‌آمد، یک دنیای محو جلوم نقش می‌بست. یک دنیایی که همه اش را خودم ایجاد کرده بودم و با افکار و مشاهداتم وفق میداد.,My drooping eyelids were engulfed in a fading world. A world I had created myself and adapted to my thoughts and observations.,"As my eyes closed a dim, indistinct world began to take shape around me. It was a world of which I was the sole creator and which was in perfect harmony with my vision of reality.","When my eyelids began to close, a hidden world would materialize before me, a world that I had created in its entirety and which accommodated my ideas and perceptions."
آنچه که در تاریکی شبها گم شده است، یک حرکت مافوق بشر مرگ بود.,What was lost in the darkness of the night was a superhuman movement of death.,"I burst out laughing. My nurse’s face was motionless. Her lustreless eyes were fixed on me but they were empty of surprise, irritation or sadness. Generally speaking, it is ordinary stupid conduct that makes one laugh, but this laughter of mine arose from a deeper cause. The vast stupidity that I saw before me was part of the general inability of mankind to unravel the central problems of existence and that thing which for her was shrouded in impenetrable darkness was a gesture of death itself.","I laughed uncontrollably, my nanny was motionless. Her dull eyes were staring at me, but they were without amazement or anger or sadness—Generally speaking, a foolish act will make one laugh, but my laughter was much deeper than that. This great absurdity was related to all those other things in the world that have not been discovered and the understanding of which is difficult, that which is lost in the depths of the night’s darkness—the one act that is beyond man is death."
با عمامه شیرو شکری و سه قبضه ریش وارد شد. او افتخار می‌کرد دوای قوت باه به پدر بزرگم داده، خاکه شیر و نبات حلق من ریخته و فلوس بناف عمه ام بسته است. باری، همینکه آمد سر پائین من نشست نبضم را گرفت، زبانم را دید، دستورداد شیرماچه الاغ و ماشعیر بخورم و روزی دومرتبه بخور کندر و زرنیخ بدهم – چند نسخه بلند بالا هم بدایه ام داد که عبارت بود از جوشانده و روغن های عجیب و غریب از قبیل:,"She entered with Shiro Shukri turban and three beards. He was proud to give my grandfather strong medicine, spilled milk powder and candy on my throat and closed my aunt's umbilical cord. Once, as soon as he came down, he took my pulse, saw my tongue, ordered me to eat donkey milk and donkey milk and give frankincense and arsenic twice a day - he also gave me a few long prescriptions, which were decoctions and strange oils. Such as:","He came into the room in an embroidered turban and with a beard three hand’s-breadths long. It was his boast that he had in his time given my grandfather drugs to restore his virility, administered grey powders to me and forced cassia down the throat of my aunt. He sat down by my bedside and, after feeling my pulse and inspecting my tongue, gave his professional advice : I was to go onto a diet of ass’s milk and barley water and to have my room fumigated twice a day with mastic and arsenic. He also gave my nurse a number of lengthy prescriptions consisting of herbal extracts and weird and wonderful oils – hyssop, olive oil, extract of liquorice, camphor, maidenhair, camomile oil, oil of bay, linseed, fir-tree nuts and suchlike trash.","He entered with his cream-colored turban and his three-fists-long beard. He was proud of the fact that he had given my grandfather medicine to strengthen his virility, that he poured rocket seed and rock candy down my throat, and forced cassia upon my father’s sister. Anyway, as soon as he arrived, he sat at my bedside, took my pulse, looked at my tongue, instructed me to drink barley water and the milk of a she-donkey, and to fumigate with frankincense and orpiment twice a day— He gave my nanny several long prescriptions which consisted of jooshandeh and strange oils and extracts such as: hyssop, olive, lilies of the valley, camphor, maidenhair, chamomile oil, goose oil, linseed, fir tree seeds, and other such nonsense."
بالاخره نقاشی خودم را پهلوی نقاشی کوزه گذاشتم، بعد رفتم منقل مخصوص خودم را درست کردم، آتش که گل انداخت آوردم جلوی نقاشیها گذاشتم - چند پک وافور کشیدم و در عالم خلسه به عکسها خیره شدم، چون میخواستم افکار خودم را جمع کنم و فقط دود اثیری تریاک بود که میتوانست افکار مرا جمع کند و استراحت فکری برایم تولید بکند.,"Finally I put my painting next to the jar painting, then I went and made my own brazier, I brought the fire that threw flowers in front of the paintings - I drew a few packs and stared at the pictures in a trance world, because I wanted to collect my thoughts and just smoke. It was an opium poppy that could gather my thoughts and give me peace of mind.","I set my painting beside that upon the jar and went and kindled the charcoal in my opium brazier. When it was burning well I set the brazier down in front of the two paintings. I drew a few whiffs of the opium pipe and, as the drug began to take effect, gazed steadily at the pictures. I felt that I had to concentrate my thoughts, and the only thing that enabled me to do so and to achieve tranquillity of mind were the ethereal fumes of opium.","Finally I placed my painting next to the painting on the jug, then I prepared my special brazier; when the charcoals were glowing I placed it in front of the paintings—I smoked the opium pipe several times and, in a state of euphoria, stared at the paintings for I wanted to gather my thoughts and it was only the ethereal smoke of opium that could gather my thoughts and cause me to have mental quietude."
خنده خشک و زننده چندش انگیزی کرد. مو بتن آدم راست میشد.,Dry and nasty laughter made him excited. Adam's concrete hair straightened.,"He burst into a hollow, grating, gooseflesh-raising peal of laughter, of a quality to make the hairs on one’s body stand on end.","He gave out a dry, grating and repulsive laugh that made the hairs on one’s body stand on end, so hard that his shoulders were shaking, but he did not look in our direction."
میان حاشیه لوزی صورت او... صورت زنی کشیده شده بود که چشم هایش سیاه درشت، درشت تر از معمول، چشمهای سرزنش دهنده داشت، مثل اینکه از من گناه های پوزش ناپذیری سر زده بود که خودم نمی‌دانستم.چشمهای افسونگر که در عین حال مضطرب و متعجب، تهدید کننده و وعده دهنده بود. این چشمها می‌ترسید و جذب می‌کرد و یک پرتو ماوراء طبیعی مست کننده در ته آن می‌درخشید. گونه های برجسته، پیشانی بلند، ابروهای باریک بهم پیوسته، لبهای گوشتالوی نیمه باز و موهای نامرتب داشت که یک رشته از آن روی شقیقه هایش چسبیده بود.,"Between the rhombus of her face ... was drawn the face of a woman whose big black eyes, larger than usual, had reproachful eyes, as if she had committed unforgivable sins that I did not know. The charming eyes that at the same time Anxious and surprised, he was threatening and promising. These eyes were frightening and absorbing, and a intoxicating supernatural ray shone at the bottom. He had prominent cheeks, a long forehead, narrow eyebrows, half-open plump lips, and untidy hair, a strand of which clung to his temples.","In the almond-shaped panel was her portrait… the face of a woman with great black eyes, eyes that were bigger than other people’s. They wore a look of reproach, as though they had seen me commit some inexpiable sin of which I had no knowledge. They were frightening, magic eyes with an expression of anxiety and wonder, of menace and promise. They terrified me and attracted me and an intoxicating, supernatural radiance shone from their depths. Her cheekbones were prominent and her forehead high. Her eyebrows were slender and met in the middle. Her lips were full and half open. Her hair was dishevelled, and one strand of it clung to her temple.","the face of a woman was painted whose eyes were large and black, eyes larger than normal, she had rebuking eyes, as if she had uncovered unforgivable sins in my person that I myself was unaware of. Terrifying and enchanting eyes that were at once restless and bewildered, intimidating and full of promise. These eyes were fear-inducing and alluring, and a supernatural and intoxicating radiance shone from their depths; she had prominent cheeks, a high forehead, slender eyebrows that were conjoined, full-bodied lips that were half-open and hair that was tousled, with a single tress hanging over her temple."
در این وقت صدای یکدسته گزمه مست از توی کوچه بلند شد که میگذشتند و شوخی های هرزه با هم می‌کردند. بعد دستجمعی زدند زیر آواز و خواندند:,"At that moment, the sound of drunken patrols rose from the alley, passing by and making jokes. Then they sang in unison and sang:",Just then the voices of a band of drunken policemen rose loud from the street. As they marched by they were joking obscenely among themselves. Then they began to sing in chorus:,"At this time the clamor of a band of drunken night watchmen rose from the alley, they were passing by and telling each other lewd jokes; then they collectively started singing:"
از میان شال گردن دو دندان کرم خورده اش،یک خنده زننده خشک کرد که مو به تن آدم راست میشد و گفت: آیا ندیده میخری؟ این کوزه قابلی نداره هان، با لحن مخصوصی گفت: قابلی نداره خیرشو ببینی.ننجون برایم خبرش را آورده بود، به همه گفته بود... بایک گدای کثیف! دایه ام گفت رختخواب زنم شپش گذاشته بود و خودش هم بحمام رفته -آری جای دو تا دندان زرد کرم خورده که از لایش آیه های عربی بیرون میامد روی صورت زنم دیده بودم.همین زن که مرا به خودش راه نمیداد که مرا تحقیر میکرد ولی با وجود همه اینها او را دوست داشتم. با تمام وجود اینکه تا کنون نگذاشته بود یکبار روی لبش را ببوسم!.بیش از این ممکن نیست.... تحمل ناپذیر است.... ناگهان ساکت شدم.بعد با حالت شمرده و بلند با لحن تمسخر آمیز میگفتم: (بیش ازین..)بعد اضافه میکردم:,"From the scarf of his two worm-eaten teeth, he dried a laugh that made his hair stand on end and said: Do you buy without seeing it? This jar is not suitable, Han said in a special tone: It is not possible for you to see Khairshoo. My midwife said that my wife's bed had left lice and she had taken a bath herself - yes, instead of two worm-eaten yellow teeth coming out of the Arabic verses, I had seen them on my wife's face. I loved him for all this. Despite the fact that he had never let me kiss his lips once! It is not possible anymore .... It is unbearable .... Suddenly I became silent. ..) Then I would add:","He looked at me over the folds of the scarf that muffled his face. Two decayed teeth emerged from under the harelip and he burst into laughter. It was a grating, hollow laugh, of a quality to make the hairs on one’s body stand on end. He said, “Do you usually buy things without looking at them? This jar’s not worth bothering about. Take it, young man. Hope it brings you luck.” I put my hand into my pocket and took out two dirhems and four peshiz* which I laid on the corner of the canvas sheet. He burst into laughter again. It was a grating laugh, of a quality to make the hairs on one’s body stand on end. I could have sunk into the ground with shame. I covered my face with my hands and walked back to the house. From all the articles laid out before him came a rusty smell as of dirty discarded objects which life had rejected. Perhaps his aim was to show people the discarded things of life and to draw attention to them. After all, was he not old and discarded himself? All the articles in his collection were dead, dirty and unserviceable. But what a stubborn life was in them and what significance there was in their forms! These dead objects left a far deeper imprint upon my mind than living people could ever have done. But Nanny had told me this story about him and had passed it on to everyone else… With a dirty beggar! My nurse told me that my wife’s bed had become infested with lice and she had gone to the baths. I wonder how her shadow looked on the steamy wall of the bathhouse. No doubt it was a voluptuous shadow with plenty of self-confidence. All things considered, my wife’s taste in men did not offend me this time. The old odds-and-ends man was not a commonplace, flat, insipid creature like the stud males that stupid randy women usually fall for. The old man with his ailments, with the rind of misfortune that encrusted him, and the misery that emanated from him was, probably without realizing it himself, a kind of small-scale exhibition organized by God for the edification of mankind. As he sat there with his squalid collection of wares on the ground in front of him, he was a sample and a personification of the whole creation. Yes, I had seen on my wife’s face the mark of the two dirty, decayed teeth between which he used to recite the Arabic verses of the Koran. This was the same wife who would not let me come near her, who scorned me, and whom I loved in spite of everything, in spite of the fact that she had never once allowed me to kiss her on the lips. The sun was setting. From somewhere came the high-pitched, plaintive sound of a kettle drum. It was a sound expressive of entreaty and supplication, which awoke in me all my ancestral superstitions and, with them, my fear of the dark. The crisis, the approach of which I had felt in advance and which I was expecting from moment to moment, came upon me. My whole body was filled with burning heat and I felt that I was suffocating. I collapsed onto my bed and shut my eyes. It seemed to me in my feverish condition that everything had expanded and had lost all distinctness of outline. The ceiling, instead of sinking, had risen. I felt oppressed by the weight of my clothes. For no reason I stood up and sat down again upon my bed, murmuring to myself, “The thing has reached the limit… This is beyond endurance…” Then I stopped abruptly. After a little I began again slowly and distinctly, in an ironical tone of voice: “The thing has…” I stopped, and added, “I am a fool.” I paid no attention to the meaning of the words I uttered. I was merely amusing myself with the vibration of my voice in the air.","From underneath his shawl his two rotten teeth emerged between his harelip, and then he gave a dry, grating laugh that made the hairs on one’s body stand on end, and said, “Are you buying without even seeing it? This jug’s not worth anything, take it young man, may it bring you good luck!” In a peculiar way he said, “It’s not worth anything, may it bring you good luck.” I put my hands in my pockets, I placed two dirhams1 and four pashiz on the edge of his sofre, and again he laughed. He gave a grating laugh that made the hairs on one’s body stand on end. I wanted to sink into the ground from the weight of shame, I covered my face with my hands and returned. The rusty smell of filthy, discarded things that have been rejected by life emanated from all his wares. Maybe he wanted to flaunt, or show people, the discarded things of life.—Was he not old and cast aside himself? The things that were laid out were all dirty, broken and dead, but what stubborn lives and meaningful forms they had! These dead objects were able to indelibly make their impressions on me in a manner that no living person could. But Nane-joon had brought me the news, she had told everyone . . . with a filthy beggar! My nanny said lice had infested my wife’s bedding and she had gone to the bathhouse—how did her shadow fall on the dripping-wet wall of the bathhouse? Perhaps a lustful shadow that was self-confident. But all in all, this time I did not disapprove of my wife’s taste, for the old peddler was not a common, flat and insipid person, like all those useless men who attract voluptuous and vacant women—These pains, these incrustations of misfortune that were patched together on the old man’s face and body, and the misery that was dripping off of him, maybe he himself was unaware, but it gave him the appearance of a minor deity, and with the filthy sofre that was in front of him, he was the representative and manifestation of Creation. Yes, I had seen the impression of two rotten, yellow teeth through which Arabic verses pass, the impression of his teeth on my wife’s face: this same wife who did not give herself to me, who humiliated me, but whom I loved despite all of this, even though until now she had not once let me kiss her on the lips— It was a yellow sun, the burning sound of the kettle drum rose up, a clamoring and wailing sound that awakened the fear of darkness and all inherited superstitions—the moment of crisis, the moment that I had been waiting for, arrived. A burning heat covered me from head to toe, I was suffocating, I collapsed on my bed and closed my eyes— The intensity of the fever was such that it seemed that everything had become enlarged and had acquired borders; the ceiling, instead of coming down, had ascended, my clothes were pressing against my body. I aimlessly got up, sat on my bed; I was murmuring to myself, “Any more would be impossible . . . it’s unbearable . . .” Suddenly I became quiet. Then in a measured way and out loud, I mockingly told myself, “Any more . . .” then I added, “I’m a fool!”—I was not aware of the meaning of the words I was uttering, I only enjoyed the vibration of my voice in the air, maybe I was talking to my shadow to dispel the loneliness—"
گویا اراده من در آنها موثر نبود.ولی این مطلب مسلم هم نیست، مناظری که جلو من مجسم می‌شد خواب معمولی نبود، چون هنوز خوابم نبرده بود.من در سکوت و آرامش، این تصویرها را از هم تفکیک می‌کردم و با یکدیگر می‌سنجیدم.بنظرم می‌آمد که تا این موقع خودم را نشناخته بودم و دنیا آنطوری که تاکنون تصور می‌کردم مفهوم و قوه خود را از دست داده بود و بجایش تاریکی شب فرمانروائی داشت – چون بمن نیاموخته بودند که بشب نگاه بکنم و شب را دوست داشته باشم.,"It seems that my will was not effective in them. But this is not certain either, the scenes that were imagined in front of me were not ordinary dreams, because I had not slept yet. It turned out that I had not known myself until now, and the world had lost its meaning and power as I had hitherto imagined, and was replaced by the darkness of the night - because I had not been taught to look at the night and love the night.","They faded and reappeared at will and my volition appeared to exercise no control over them. This point, however, is not certain. The scenes which passed before my eyes were no ordinary dream, for I was not yet asleep. In silence and tranquillity I distinguished the various images and compared them with one another. It seemed to me that until now I had not known myself and that the world as I had conceived it hitherto had lost all significance and validity and had been replaced by the darkness of night. For I had not been taught to gaze at and to love the night.","When I closed my eyes, my real world was revealed to me—These scenes had a life of their own, freely vanishing and reappearing, as if my desire had no effect on them but I am not certain of this; the scenes that appeared before me were not ordinary dreams for I had yet to fall asleep, in silence and tranquility I separated these scenes and compared them to each other. It seemed to me that I had not known myself until now, and the way in which I had viewed the world until now had lost its strength and meaning, and in its place the darkness of the night ruled—for they had not taught me to peer at the night and to love the night."
تمام شب را باین فکر بودم. چندین بار خواستم بروم از روزنهء دیوار نگاه بکنم ولی از صدای خندهء پیرمرد ترسیدم، روز بعد را بهمین فکر بودم. آیا می‌توانستم از دیدارش بکلی چشم بپوشم؟ فردای آنروز بالاخره با هزار ترس و لرز تصمیم گرفتم بغلی شراب را دوباره سر جایش بگذارم ولی همین که پردهء جلو پستو را کنار زدم و نگاه کردم دیوار سیاه تاریک، مانند همان تاریکی که سرتاسر زندگی مرا فرا گرفته بود - اصلا هیچ منفذ و روزنه ای به خارج دیده نمی‌شد- روزنه چهارگوشهء دیوار بکلی مسدود و از جنس آن شده بود، مثل اینکه از ابتدا وجود نداشته است- چهارپایه را پیش کشیدم ولی هرچه دیوانه وار روی بدنهء دیوار مشت میزدم و گوش میدادم یا جلوی چراغ نگاه می‌کردم کمترین نشانه ای از روزنه دیوار دیده نمی‌شد و به دیوار کلفت و قطور ضربه های من کارگر نبود - یکپارچه سرب شده بود.,"I thought about it all night. Several times I wanted to go and look through the hole in the wall, but I was afraid of the old man's laughter, so I thought the next day. Could I completely ignore his visit? The next day, with a thousand fears and shivers, I finally decided to put the wine next to it again, but as soon as I pulled back the front curtain of the closet and looked at the dark black wall, like the darkness that had filled my whole life - no pores at all. It could not be seen from the outside - the quadrangular opening of the wall was completely blocked and made of material, as if it did not exist from the beginning - I pulled the stool forward, but I fisted madly on the body of the wall and listened or looked in front of the lamp. The hole in the wall could not be seen, and it did not work against the thick wall of my blows - it was uniformly leaded.","All that night I thought about these things. Again and again I was on the point of going to look through the aperture in the wall, but fear of the old man’s laughter held me back. The next day also I could think of nothing else. Would I be able to refrain altogether from going to look at her? Finally, on the third day I decided, despite the dread which possessed me, to put the bottle of wine back in its place. But when I drew the curtain aside and looked into the closet I saw in front of me a wall as blank and dark as the darkness which has enshrouded my life. There was no trace of aperture or window. The rectangular opening had been filled in, had merged with the wall, as though it had never existed. I stood upon the stool but, although I hammered on the wall with my fists, listening intently, although I held the lamp to it and examined it with care, there was not the slightest trace of any aperture. My blows had no more effect upon the solid, massive fabric of the wall than if it had been a single slab of lead.","All night I was thinking of this, several times I wanted to go and peer through the opening in the wall but I was scared of the old man’s laughter, and the next day I only thought of the same. Could I really tolerate not seeing her? The day after that, notwithstanding my intense fear, I decided to place the flask of wine back in its place— But as soon as I pulled the closet’s curtain aside and looked inside, the dark black wall, with the same darkness that has covered my entire life, was in front of me. There was absolutely no trace of any opening or passage leading to the outside— The small square opening was completely closed off and had become part of the wall, as if it had never even existed. I pulled the stool forward, but no matter how many times I madly pounded on the wall and listened, or brought the lamp forth and looked, the slightest trace of that opening could not be seen and my blows had no effect on that thick and sturdy wall—it had become a solid mass of lead."

After which she began to console me in a way that suggested she knew the truth. Sometimes she would fetch me home-made remedies from the neighbours or she would consult magicians and fortune-tellers about my case.","several days ago she told me that her daughter (meaning that whore) in an astrologically timely way was knitting a qiyamat1 shirt for the baby, for her baby, then as if she, herself, also knew, she consoled me.

I felt as though a heavy weight had been lifted from my chest, and a wonderful sensation of peace permeated my whole being. I looked around me.

حالم بدتر شده بود؛ فقط دایه ام، دایه او هم بود، با صورت پیر و موهای خاکستری گوشه اطاق، کنار بالین من می‌نشست، به پیشانیم آب سرد می‌زد و جوشانده برایم می‌آورد. از حالات و اتفاقات بچگی من و آن لکاته صحبت می‌کرد. مثلا او به من گفت: که زنم از توی ننو عادت داشته همیشه ناخن چپش را می‌جویده، بقدری می‌جویده که زخم می‌شده و گاهی هم برایم قصه نقل می‌کرد – بنظرم می‌آمد که این قصه ها سن مرا به عقب می‌برد و حالت بچگی درمن تولید می‌کرد. چون مربوط به یادگارهای آن دوره بوده است وقتی که خیلی کوچک بودم و در اطاقی که من و زنم توی ننو پهلوی هم خوابیده بودیم.یک ننوی دو نفره. درست یادم هست همین قصه ها را می‌گفت. حالا بعضی از قسمتهای این قصه ها که سابق بر این باور نمی‌کردم برایم امر طبیعی شده است.,"I was feeling worse; Only my midwife was his midwife, with an old face and gray hair in the corner of the room, sitting by my bed, pouring cold water on my forehead and bringing me a decoction. He talked about my childhood and that of Lakata. For example, he told me that my wife was accustomed to chewing on her left fingernail from time to time, chewing so hard that she would get hurt, and sometimes telling me stories - it seemed to me that these stories would push me back in age and produce my childhood. Because it was related to the relics of that period when I was very small and in the room where my wife and I slept in Nano Pahlavi. A two-person Nano. I remember telling the same stories. Now some parts of these stories that I previously did not believe have become natural to me.","My condition grew worse. Only my old grey-haired nurse, who was her nurse also, attended me, bringing me my medicine or sitting beside my bed, dabbing cold water on my forehead. She would talk about the time when the bitch and I were children. For example, she told me how my wife from early childhood had a habit of biting the nails of her left hand and would sometimes gnaw them to the quick. Sometimes she would tell me stories and then I would feel that my life had reversed its course and I had become a child again, for the stories were intimately associated with my memories of those days. I remember quite plainly that when I was very little and my wife and I used to sleep together in the one cradle, a big double cradle, my nurse used to tell the same stories. Some things in these stories which then used to strike me as far-fetched now seem perfectly natural and credible to me.","My condition worsened, it was only my nanny, it was her nanny too, with her weathered face and grey hair, who would sit by my bedside in the corner of the room, rubbing cold water on my forehead, bringing me jooshandehs. She would speak of the various episodes and different aspects of my and that whore’s childhood.—For example she would tell me that ever since she was in the nanoo, my wife had a habit of chewing on the fingernails of her left hand, she would chew so much that they would become raw. And sometimes she would tell a story— It seemed to me these tales turned back my age and created in me the state of a child, for they were related to the memories of that period— When I was very small and in the room in which my wife and I lay next to each other in the nanoo—a large two-person nanoo, I precisely remember she would tell these very same stories, parts of these stories that in the past I did not believe because they seemed incredible now seemed the natural state of affairs."
چهارشنبه آخر سال رفته بود فالگوش یک کاسه آورد که در آن پیاز، برنج و روغن خراب شده بود – گفت اینها را بنیت سلامتی من گدائی کرده و همه این گندو کثافتها را دزدکی بخورد من می‌داد. بلافاصله هم جوشانده های حکیم باشی را بناف من می‌بست.,"On the last Wednesday of the year, Falgoosh had brought a bowl in which onions, rice and oil were spoiled - he said that my health begged them and he would stealthily eat all this filth.

دایه ام منقل را برداشت و باگامهای شمرده بیرون رفت، من عرق روی پیشانی خودم را پاک کردم. بعد نمی‌دانم این ترانه را کجاشنیده بودم و با خودم زمزمه کردم:,"My midwife picked up the brazier and the bagamas went out, I wiped the sweat from my forehead. Then I do not know where I heard this song and I whispered to myself:","She took the brazier and walked with deliberation out of the room. I wiped the sweat from my forehead. My hands were covered with white flecks. I leant against the wall, pressing my head to the bricks, and began to feel better. After a little I murmured the words of a song which I had heard somewhere or other:","My nanny picked up the brazier and left with measured steps. I wiped the sweat off my forehead, white spots had appeared on my palms. I leaned on the wall, I pressed my head against the pillar, it seemed I was feeling better.

I was in front of my house, I hurried into my room, I put the jar on the table, I went to the tin can, the same tin can that I had rolled up and I was standing in the back of my room, I came to the door to give the can to the old man in the carriage instead He had disappeared, no trace of his work could be seen in his carriage - I returned to my room disappointed again, turned on the lamp, took the jar out of the napkin, wiped the dirt off it with my sleeve, the jar had an old transparent purple glaze the color of a golden bee.

I was outside the door of my own house. I hurriedly went in and entered my room. I put the jar down on the table, went straight into the closet and brought out from its hiding place the tin box which served me as a safe. I went to the door, intending to give it to the old hearse-driver in lieu of payment, but he had disappeared; there was no sign of him or of his hearse. Frustrated, I went back to my room. I lit the lamp, took the jar out of the handkerchief in which it was wrapped and with my sleeve rubbed away the earth which coated it. It was an ancient vase with a transparent violet glaze which had turned to the colour of a crushed blister fly. On one side of the belly of the vase was an almond-shaped panel framed in blue flowers of morning glory, and in the panel…","The hearse stopped. I picked up the jug and jumped down from the carriage.

But he had vanished, there was no trace of him or his carriage— I once more dejectedly returned to my room, lit the lamp, uncovered the jug, wiped its dirt with my sleeve.

میدیدم که درد و رنج وجود دارد ولی خالی از هر گونه مفهوم و معنی بود – من میان رجاله ها یک نژاد مجهول و ناشناس شده بود، بطوری که فراموش کرده بودند که سابق بر این جزو دنیای آنها بوده ام. چیزی که وحشتناک بود حس می‌کردم که نه زنده زنده هستم و نه مرده مرده، فقط یک مرده متحرک بودم که نه رابطه با دنیای زنده ها داشتم و نه از فراموشی و آسایش مرگ استفاده می‌کردم.,"I saw that there was suffering, but it was devoid of any meaning - I had become an unknown race among the scoundrels, so that they had forgotten that I had been part of their world before. What was horrible was that I felt that I was neither alive nor dead, I was just a moving dead who had no connection with the living world and did not use the forgetfulness and comfort of death.","I saw that pain and disease existed and at the same time that they were void of sense and meaning. Among the men of the rabble I had become a creature of a strange, unknown race, so much so that they had forgotten that I had once been part of their world.

I was a living corpse, unrelated to the world of living people and at the same time deprived of the oblivion and peace of death.","I saw that pain and suffering existed but they were devoid of any purpose or meaning— Amongst the rabble I had become an unknown and unfamiliar breed, so much so that they had forgotten that before this I was a part of their world.

مثل یک جانور درنده به او حمله کردم و گرسنه به او حمله کردم و درته دلم از او اکراه داشتم، بنظرم می امد که حس عشق و کینه با هم توام بود.,"I attacked him like a predator and I attacked him hungry and in my heart I was reluctant from him, it seemed to me that the feeling of love and resentment were together.","Clasped her? No, I sprang upon her like a savage, hungry beast and in the bottom of my heart I loathed her. To me love and hatred were twins.","No, I attacked her like a hungry, rapacious beast and in the depths of my heart I was repulsed by her , it seems that the feeling of love and spite were conjoined."

بنظرم آمد تا مدتی که کوزه روی رف است خوابم نخواهد برد –یکجور ترس بیجا برایم تولید شده بودکه کوزه خواهد افتاد، بلند شدم که جای کوزه را محفوظ کنم، ولی بواسطه تحریک مجهولی که خودم ملتفت نبودم دستم را عمدا بکوزه خورد، کوزه افتاد و شکست، بالاخره پلکهای چشمم را به هم فشار دادم، اما بخیالم رسید که دایه ام بلند شده بمن نگاه می‌کند مشتهای خود را زیر لحاف گره کردم، اما هیچ اتفاق فوق العاده ای رخ نداده بود. در حالت اغما صدای در کوچه را شنیدم، صدای پای دایه ام را شنیدم که نعلینش بزمین میکشید و رفت نان و پنیر را گرفت.,"It seemed to me that I would not fall asleep as long as the jar was on the shelf - a kind of unreasonable fear had arisen in me that the jar would fall. Failure, I finally squeezed my eyelids, but I imagined that my midwife got up to look at me, I clenched my fists under the duvet, but nothing extraordinary happened. In a coma, I heard the sound in the alley, the sound of my nanny's footsteps falling to the ground, and she went and got some bread and cheese.","I felt that no one until then had ever set foot there. All at once I saw a little girl appear from behind the cypress trees and set off in the direction of the castle. She was wearing a black dress of very fine, light material, apparently silk. She was biting the nail of one of the fingers of her left hand, and she glided by with an unconstrained, carefree air. I had the feeling that I had seen her before and knew who she was but could not be sure. Suddenly she vanished. Where she had gone, the distance between us and the glare of the sun prevented me from making out. I remained petrified, unable to make the slightest movement. I was quite sure that I had seen her with my own two eyes walk past and then disappear. Was she a real being or an illusion? Had I seen her in a dream or waking? All my attempts to call her face to mind were vain. I experienced a peculiar tremor down my spine. It occurred to me that this was the hour of the day when the shadows of the castle upon the hill returned to life, and that this little girl was one of the old-time inhabitants of the ancient city of Rey. The landscape before my eyes all at once struck me as familiar. I remembered that once in my childhood on the thirteenth day of Nouruz I had come here with my mother-in-law and “the bitch”. That day we ran after each other and played for hours on the far side of these same cypress trees. Then we were joined by another band of children – who they were, I cannot quite remember. We played hide-and-seek together. Once when I was running after the bitch on the bank of the Suran her foot slipped and she fell into the water. The others pulled her out and took her behind the cypress tree to change her clothes. I followed them. They hung up a woman’s veil as a screen in front of her but I furtively peeped from behind a tree and saw her whole body. She was smiling and biting the nail of the index finger of her left hand. Then they wrapped her up in a white cloak and spread out her fine-textured black silk dress to dry in the sun. I stretched myself out at full length on the fine sand at the foot of the old cypress tree. The babbling of the water reached my ears like the staccato, unintelligible syllables murmured by a man who is dreaming. I automatically thrust my hands into the warm, moist sand. I squeezed the warm, moist sand in my fists. It felt like the firm flesh of a girl who has fallen into the water and who has changed her clothes. I do not know how long I spent thus. When I stood up I began automatically to walk. The whole countryside was silent and peaceful. I walked on, completely unaware of my surroundings. Some force beyond my control compelled me to keep moving. All of my attention was concentrated on my feet. I did not walk in the normal fashion but glided along as the girl in black had done. When I came to myself I found that I was back in the city and standing before my father-in-law’s house. His little son, my brother-in-law, was sitting on the stone bench outside. He and his sister were like two halves of the one apple. He had slanting Turkoman eyes, prominent cheekbones, a complexion the colour of ripe wheat, sensual nostrils and a strong, thin face. As he sat there he was holding the index finger of his left hand to his lips. I automatically went up to him, put my hand into my pocket, took out the two cakes, gave them to him and said, “These are for you from Mummy” – he used to call my wife “Mummy” for want of a real mother. He took the cakes with some hesitation and looked at them with an expression of surprise in his Turkoman eyes. I sat down beside him on the bench. I set him on my lap and pressed him to me. His body was warm and the calves of his legs reminded me of my wife’s. He had the same unconstrained manner as she. His lips were like his father’s, but what in the father aroused my aversion I found charming and attractive in the boy. They were half open, as though they had only just broken away from a long, passionate kiss. I kissed him on his half-open mouth, which was so much like my wife’s. His lips tasted like the stub end of a cucumber: they were acrid and bitter. The bitch’s lips, I thought, must have the same taste. At that moment I caught sight of his father, the bent old man with the scarf around his neck, coming out of the doorway. He passed by without looking in my direction. He was laughing convulsively. It was a horrible laugh, of a quality to make the hairs on one’s body stand on end, and he laughed so that his shoulders shook. I could have sunk into the ground with shame. It was shortly before sunset. I stood up, wishing that I could somehow escape from myself. Mechanically, I took the direction that led to my own house. I saw nothing and nobody in the street. It seemed to me that I was walking through a strange, unknown city. Around me were weird isolated houses of geometrical shapes, with forlorn, black windows. One felt that no creature with the breath of life in it could ever have dwelt in them. Their white walls gave off a sickly radiance. A strange, an unbelievable thing was this: whenever I stopped, my shadow fell long and black on the wall in the moonlight, but it had no head. I had heard people say that if anyone cast a headless shadow on a wall that person would die before the year was out. Overcome with fear, I went into my house and shut myself up in my room. At the same moment I began to bleed from the nose. After losing a great quantity of blood I collapsed upon my bed. My nurse came in to see to me. Before I went to sleep I looked at myself in the mirror. My face was ravaged, lifeless and indistinct, so indistinct that I did not recognize myself. I got into bed, pulled the quilt over my head, huddled myself up and, with eyes closed, pursued the course of my thoughts. I was conscious of the strands which had been woven by a dark, gloomy, fearful and delightful destiny; I moved in the regions where life and death fuse together and perverse images come into being and ancient, extinct desires, vague, strangled desires, again come to life and cry aloud for vengeance. For that space of time I was severed from nature and the phenomenal world and was prepared to accept effacement and dissolution in the everlasting flux. I murmured again and again, “Death, death… where are you?” The thought of death soothed me and I fell asleep. In my sleep I dreamt. I was in the Mohammadiyye square. A tall gallows tree had been erected there and the body of the old odds-and-ends man whom I used to see from my window was hanging from its arm. At its foot were several drunken policemen drinking wine. My mother-in-law, in a state of great excitement, with the expression which I see on my wife’s face when she is badly upset – bloodless lips, staring, wild eyes – was dragging me by the arm through the crowd, gesticulating to the red-clad hangman and shouting, “String this one up too!” I awoke in terror. I was glowing like a furnace, my body was streaming with sweat and my cheeks were burning. In order to get the nightmare out of my mind I rose, drank some water and dabbed my head and face. I went back to bed but could not fall asleep. Lying there in the transparent darkness I gazed steadily at the water jug that stood on the topmost shelf. I had an irrational fear that it was going to fall and decided that so long as it stood there I should be unable to fall asleep. I got up, intending to put the jug in a safe place, but by some obscure impulsion that had nothing to do with me my hand deliberately nudged it so that it fell and was smashed to pieces. I was able to close my eyes at last but I had the feeling that my nurse had come into the room and was looking at me. I clenched my fists under the quilt but in fact nothing out of the ordinary happened. In a state of semi-consciousness I heard the street door open and recognized the sound of my nurse’s steps as, shuffling her slippers along the ground, she went to buy bread and cheese for breakfast.","It was a pleasant and secluded area, it seemed as if until now no one had set foot in this area. Suddenly I took notice: I saw a small girl come out from behind the cypress tree and go towards the fort. She was wearing a black dress that had been woven with an extremely thin and light warp and woof, perhaps silk, she was chewing the fingernail of her left hand and she was gliding, passing by with carefree and easy movements. It seemed to me that I had seen her before and knew her, but from this far a distance, under the rays of the sun, I could not tell how she suddenly disappeared. I was frozen in place without being able to make the slightest movement, but this time I had seen her pass in front of me with my own eyes and then disappear. Was she an actual being or an illusion? Had I been dreaming or awake? No matter how much I tried to remember, it was useless—I felt a particular trembling in my spine, it seemed to me that in this hour all the shadows of the fort that were cast upon the mountain had come to life, and that the small girl was one of the former inhabitants of the ancient city of Rey. The scene that was before me seemed at once familiar, I remembered a Sizdahbedar from my childhood when we had come to this place, my mother-in-law and that whore were also there—how we played that day and ran after each other behind these same cypress trees, then a group of other kids, that I can not remember precisely, joined us. We were playing sarmamak,1 and one time when I was going after this whore, it was near this same Suren River, her leg wobbled and she fell in the river— They brought her out, took her behind the cypress tree to change her clothes. I followed after her, they were holding a prayer veil in front of her but I furtively saw her entire body from behind the tree. She was smiling and chewing on the index finger of her left hand, then they wrapped a white cloak around her body and laid out, in the sun, her black silken dress that had been woven with a thin warp and woof. Finally I lay on the sand, at the foot of the old cypress tree. The sound of the water, like choppy and unintelligible speech that murmurs in the realm of sleep, was reaching my ears. I involuntarily sank my hands into the warm and damp sand, I was squeezing the warm and damp sand in my fists, it was like the firm flesh of a girl’s body who has fallen in the water and changed her clothes. I do not know how much time passed. When I got up I unconsciously started to walk. It was quiet and still everywhere, I was moving but I did not see my surroundings, a force that was beyond my control was compelling me to move, all of my attention was focused on my own steps, I was not walking but, like that black-clad girl, I was gliding on my feet and passing by. As soon as I came to, I saw that I was in town and in front of my father-in-law’s house— I do not know why I ended up at my father-in-law’s house— His son, my brother-in-law, was sitting on the bench— He and his sister were like an apple that has been cut in two: He had slanted Turkoman eyes, prominent cheeks, wheat-colored complexion, a sensuous nose and a thin and strong face, and as he sat there, the index finger of his left hand was in his mouth. I unconsciously went forward, took out the kolooches that were in my pocket, and gave them to him and said, “Shah-joon gave these for you,” for he called my wife, instead of his own mother, “Shah-joon.”—He hesitantly held the kolooches in his hands and gazed wondrously at them with his Turkoman eyes. I sat on the bench, placed him in my lap and pressed him against myself. His body was warm and his calves were the same as my wife’s calves, and he had the same relaxed mannerisms that she had— His lips resembled his father’s—but that which in his father caused a feeling of repulsion in me was quite the opposite in him, seeming charismatic and attractive—it was as if his half-open lips had just separated from a long, warm kiss— I kissed his half-open mouth because it looked similar to my wife’s— His lips tasted like the end of a cucumber, acrid and bitter, perhaps the lips of that whore had this same taste. At the same time I saw his father—that humpbacked old man who was wearing a scarf, exit the door of the house. He passed by without looking at me, laughing convulsively, so hard was he laughing that his shoulders were shaking, it was a frightful laugh that made the hairs on one’s body stand on end. I wanted to sink into the ground from the weight of shame— It was nearing dusk , I stood up, it was as if I wanted to escape from myself. Unconsciously I started on my way home , I did not see anyone or anything, it seemed to me that I was moving through an unfamiliar and foreign city. All around me there were strange and peculiar houses, in cut-up geometrical shapes, with bleak black windows, as if no living creature could ever dwell in these houses, but their white walls shone with an unearthly light, and what was strange, what I could not believe was that when I stood opposite each of these walls, in front of the moonlight, my shadow would fall upon the wall, thick and enormous, but it was without a head— my shadow was headless—I had heard that if the shadow of a person cast upon a wall was headless they would die by the year’s end. I entered my house in an anxious state and sought the refuge of my room. At the same time my nose started to bleed, and after a large amount of blood came out of my nose I fell unconscious on my bed.—My nanny began to look after me. Before I fell asleep, I looked at my face in the mirror, I saw that my face looked broken, faint and lifeless , it was so faded that I did not recognize myself— I got into bed, pulled the quilt over my head, turned, faced the wall, curled up my legs, closed my eyes and continued where I had left off with my thoughts—those threads that made up my dark, depressing, horrific and intoxicating destiny—that place where life intertwines with death and distorted images are born—long-extinguished and bygone desires, strangled and buried desires again come to life and scream revenge— At this time I was torn from nature and the illusory world, and was willing to be destroyed and obliterated in the current of eternity —Several times I whispered to myself, “Death . . . death . . . where are you?” It was this that soothed me and I fell asleep. After my eyes closed, I saw that I was in Mohammadieh Meydan. They had erected a high gallows, and had hung, on the gallows tree, the old peddler who always sat in front of my room—Several drunken policemen were drinking wine at the foot of the gallows— My mother-in-law, with a blazing expression, with an expression I have seen on my wife’s face when she is angry, with her lips blanched and her pupils round and horrified, was pulling my hand, guiding me through the crowd, pointing me out to the hangman dressed in red, and saying, “Hang this one too.” I woke up from sleep in a state of fright—I was burning like an oven, my body was drenched in sweat and a stinging heat was flaming across my cheeks— In order to rid myself of this nightmare, I got up and drank some water and splashed some on my face. I lay down again but sleep did not come to my eyes. In the shadows and light of the room, I was staring at the jug of water that was on the top shelf—it seemed to me that as long as the jug of water was on the top shelf I would not fall asleep—I was overtaken by an irrational fear that the jug was going to fall, I got up to secure the jug but, by an invisible force that I was unaware of, my hand deliberately hit the jug, and the jug fell and broke. Finally, I forced shut my eyelids but I thought that my nanny had gotten up and was looking at me. I balled up my fists under the blanket but nothing out of the ordinary had happened. In a state of unconsciousness I heard the sounds of the front door, I heard the sound of my nanny, who dragged her slippers on the ground as she went to get bread and cheese."
او قبلا دستمال پرمعنی را درست کرده بود، خون کبوتر به آن زده بود، نمیدانم. شاید همان دستمالی بود که از شب اول عشقبازی خودش نگهداشته بود برای اینکه بیشتر مرا مسخره بکند – آن وقت همه بمن تبریک میگفتند - بهم چشمک میزدند، و لابد توی دلشان میگفتند (یارو دیشب قلعه رو گرفته؟) و من بروی مبارکم نمیآوردم - بمن می‌خندیدند، بخریت من میخندیدند. با خودم شرط کرده بودم که روزی همه اینها را بنویسم.,"He had already made a meaningful handkerchief, he had dove blood on it, I do not know. Maybe it was the handkerchief he had kept from the first night of his courtship to make fun of me more - then everyone was congratulating me - they were winking at me, and they were probably saying in their hearts (Yaro took the castle last night?) And I would not bring it to you - to me They laughed, they laughed at me. I bet I would write all this one day.","She had prepared her virginity token beforehand. I don’t know – perhaps she had sprinkled the cloth with the blood of a partridge or perhaps it was a cloth she had kept from the first night of her gallantries in order to make a bigger fool of me. At the time everyone was congratulating me. They were winking at one another and I suppose they were saying to one another, “The lad took the fortress by storm last night”, while I put the best face on it that I could and pretended I noticed nothing. They were laughing at me, at my blindness. I made a resolution to write the whole story down some day.","She had taken care of that portentous handkerchief2 beforehand, placing pigeon’s blood on it, I do not know, perhaps it was the same handkerchief she had saved from her first night of lovemaking—in order to make a bigger fool out of me— At the same time everyone was congratulating me, winking at me, and in their hearts, they must have been saying, “He conquered the fort last night!” and I pretended not to hear—they were laughing at me, laughing at my stupidity.

در دنیای جدیدی که بیدار شده بودم محیط و وضع آنجا کاملا به من آشنا و نزدیک بود، به طوری که بیش از زندگی و محیط سابق خودم بآن انس داشتم - مثل اینکه انعکاس زندگی حقیقی من بود - یک دنیای دیگر ولی بقدی بمن نزدیک و مربوط بود که بنظرم میآمد در محیط اصلی خودم برگشته ام - در یک دنیای قدیمی‌اما در عین حال نزدیکتر و طبیعی تر متولد شده بودم.,"In the new world I woke up to, the environment was so familiar and close to me, that I enjoyed it more than my previous life and environment - as if it were a reflection of my real life - another world, but so close and relevant to me. It was as if I was back in my original environment - in an old world, but at the same time I was born closer and more natural.","When i awoke in a new world everything that I found there was perfectly familiar and near to me, so much so that I felt more at home in it than in my previous surroundings and manner of life, which, so it seemed to me, had been only the reflection of my real life. It was a different world but one in such perfect harmony with me that I felt as though I had returned to my natural surroundings. I had been born again in a world which was ancient but which at the same time was closer and more natural to me than the other.","In the new world I had woken up into, the surroundings and circumstances were completely intimate and familiar to me, so much so that I was more fond of it than my previous life and surroundings—as if it was the true reflection of my life—another world, yet it was so connected and familiar to me that it seemed I had returned to my original home— I had been born into an ancient world, yet at the same time, more natural and more intimate."
لازم داشتم که این کیف را بکنم - از دریچه اطاقم میان ابرها یک سوراخ کاملا آبی عمیق روی آسمان پیدا بود، به نظرم آمد برای اینکه بتوانم بآنجا برسم باید از یک نردبان خیلی بلند بالا بروم. روی کرانه آسمان را ابرهای زرد غلیظ مرگ آلود گرفته بود، به طوری که روی همه شهر سنگینی می‌کرد. - یک هوای وحشتناک و پر از کیف بود، نمی‌دانم چرا من به طرف زمین خم میشدم، همیشه در این هوا بفکر مرگ میافتادم. ولی حالا که مرگ با صورت خونین و دستهای استخوانی بیخ گلویم را گرفته بود، حالا فقط تصمیم گرفته بودم، که این لکاته را هم با خودم ببرم تا بعد از من نگوید: خدا بیامرزدش، راحت شد!,"I needed to make this bag - there was a completely blue hole in the sky through the window of my room, it seemed to me that I had to climb a very high ladder to get there. The sky was covered with thick yellow deadly clouds, so heavy that it covered the whole city. - It was a terrible air and full of bags, I do not know why I was leaning towards the ground, I was always thinking of death in this air. But now that death had taken hold of my throat with a bloody face and bony hands, I had just decided to take this lakata with me so that he would not say after me: God bless him, he is relieved!","I could see from my window a patch of perfect, deep blue in the midst of the clouds. It seemed to me that I should have to climb a very long ladder to reach that patch of sky. The horizon was covered with thick, yellow, deathly clouds which weighed heavily upon the whole city. It was horrible, delicious weather. For some reason which I cannot explain I crouched down to the floor. In this kind of weather I always tended to think of death. But it was only now, when death, his face smeared with blood, was clutching my throat with his bony hands, that I made up my mind. I made up my mind to take the bitch with me, to prevent her from saying when I had gone, “God have mercy on him, his troubles are over.”","I cleaned the blade with the end of my tunic and placed it under my pillow—I had come to this decision a long time ago—but I do not know what it was in the movements of the butcher when he would cut up the thighs of the sheep, weigh them, and then give an admiring look, that I unconsciously felt that I had to emulate him, that I needed to feel this pleasure—From the window of my room, between the clouds, a completely deep and blue hole was visible in the sky; I thought that in order to reach there, I had to climb a very tall ladder. The horizon was covered by thick, yellow, deathly clouds such that they were weighing down over the entire city— It was terrifying and exhilarating weather, I do not know why I was not bending over toward the ground, I always thought of death in this kind of weather, but now that Death had me by the throat with its bony hands and bloody face, only now did I decide— but I had decided to take this whore with me so that afterwards she would not say of me, “God bless him, his suffering is over!”"
من هراسان عبایم را رو کولم انداختم و به اطاق خودم رفتم. جلوی نور پیه سوز مشتم را باز کردم دیدم چشم او میان دستم بود و تمام تنم غرق خون شده بود.رفتم جلوی آینه ولی از شدت ترس دستهایم را جلو صورتم گرفتم - دیدم شبیه نه اصلا پیرمرد خنزری شده بودم. موهای سر وریشم مثل موهای سر و صورت کسی بود که زند ه از اطاقی بیرون بیاید که یک مارناگ در آنجا بوده - همه سفید شد ه بود، لبم مثل لب پیرمرد دریده بود، چشمهایم بدون مژه، یکمشت موی سفید از سینه ام بیرون زده بود و روح تازه ای در تن من حلول کرده بود. اصلا طور دیگر فکر می‌کردم.همینطورکه دستم را جلوی صورتم گرفته بودم بی اختیار زدم زیر خنده،یک خند ه سخت تر از اول که وجود مرا بلرزه انداخت. خنده عمیقی که معلوم نبود از کدام چاله گمشده بدنم بیرون میامد. من پیرمرد خنزری شده بودم.از شد ت اضطراب، مثل این بود که از خواب عمیقی بیدار شده باشم چشمهایم را مالاندم. در همان اطاق سابق خودم بودم، تاریک روشن بود و ابرو میغ روی شیشه ها را گرفته بود -در منقل روبرویم گلهای آتش تبدیل به خاکستر سرد شده بود و بیک فوت بند بود.اولین چیزی که جستجو کردم گلدان راغه بود که در قبرستان از پیرمرد کالسکه چی گرفته بودم ولی گلدان روبروی من نبود.,"Frightened, I threw my cloak over my shoulder and went to my room. I opened my fist in front of the tallow light and saw that his eyes were between my hands and my whole body was covered in blood. My hair was like the hair on my head and face like someone coming out of a room where there was a marmalade - it was all white, my lips were torn like the old man's lips, my eyes were without eyelashes, a handful of white hair came out of my chest And a new spirit had dissolved in my body. I thought differently. As I put my hand in front of my face, I involuntarily laughed, a harder laugh than the first, which shook my being. A deep laugh that it was not clear from which lost hole my body was coming out. I had become a piggy old man. Out of anxiety, it was as if I had woken up from a deep sleep and rubbed my eyes. I was in my former room, it was dark and my eyebrows were on the glass - in front of the brazier the flowers of fire had turned to cold ashes and I was about to die. I was in a carriage, but the vase was not in front of me.","In terror I threw my cloak over my shoulders and hurried back to my own room. I opened my hand in the light of the oil lamp: in the palm of my hand lay her eye, and I was drenched in blood. I went over and stood before the mirror. Overcome with horror, I covered my face with my hands. What I had seen in the mirror was the likeness, no, the exact image, of the old odds-and-ends man. My hair and beard were completely white, like those of a man who has come out alive from a room in which he has been shut up along with a cobra. My eyes were without lashes, a clump of white hairs sprouted from my chest and a new spirit had taken possession of my body. My mind and my senses were operating in a completely different way from before. A demon had awoken to life within me and I was unable to escape from him. Still holding my hands before my face, I involuntarily burst into laughter. It was a more violent laugh than the previous one had been and it made me shudder from head to foot. It was a laugh so deep that it was impossible to guess from what remote recess of the body it proceeded, a hollow laugh which came from somewhere deep down in my body and merely echoed in my throat. I had become the old odds-and-ends man. 5 The violence of my agitation seemed to have awakened me from a long, deep sleep. I rubbed my eyes. I was back in my own room. It was half dark and outside a wet mist pressed against the windowpanes. Somewhere in the distance a cock crowed. The charcoal in the brazier beside me had burnt to cold ashes which I could have blown away with a single breath. I felt that my mind had become hollow and ashy like the coals and was at the mercy of a single breath. The first thing I looked for was the flower vase of Rhages which the old hearse-driver had given me in the cemetery, but it had gone.","’s body stand on end— Horrorstricken, I threw the cloak over my shoulders and went to my room— In front of the tallow-burner I opened my fist , I saw that her eyes were in my hands and that my entire body was drowning in blood—I went in front of the mirror but I covered my face with my hands because of the intensity of the fear— I saw that I looked like, no, as a matter of fact I had become the old peddler. The hair of my beard and head was like the hair of a person who walks out alive from a room that has a Naja snake in it— all of it had turned white, my lip was split open like the old man’s, my eyes were without eyelashes, a bunch of white hair was sticking out from my chest and a new spirit had taken possession of my body. I was essentially thinking differently, feeling differently and I could not free myself from it—from the demon that had awakened in me— As I held my hands in front of my face I involuntarily started laughing, a laugh much harder than the first one that shook my soul, a deep laugh such that it was uncertain from which forgotten crevice of my body it came out of, an empty laugh that just echoed in my throat and came out of the emptiness.—I had become the old peddler. The intensity of the apprehension was such that it seemed I had awoken from a long and deep sleep. I rubbed my eyes, I was in that same old room of mine, it was twilight and the mist and fog had covered the windows— The rooster’s cry was heard from afar— In the brazier in front of me the flowers of fire had turned into cold ashes that could be blown away with a single breath, I felt that my thoughts had turned into ashes and nothingness, like the flowers of the fire, and that they could be blown over with a single breath. The first thing that I looked for was the Ragheh flower vase that I had gotten from the old carriage driver in the graveyard, but the vase was not in front of me, I looked and saw a person with a bent shadow, no, this person was a humpbacked old man who had covered his face and head with a scarf, and had something resembling a vase wrapped up in a grimy handkerchief under his arm—"
نمیخواهم کسی این پرسش را از من بکند، ولی اصل کار صورت او- نه، چشمهایش بود و حالا این چشمها را داشتم، روح چشمهایش را روی کاغذ داشتم و دیگر تنش بدرد من نمی‌خورد، این تنی که محکوم به نیستی و طعمه کرم ها و موشهای زیرزمین بود! حالا از این ببعد او در اختیار من بود، نه من دست نشاندهء او. هر دقیقه که مایل بودم می‌توانستم چشم هایش را ببینم - نقاشی را با احتیاط هر چه تمامتر بردم در قوطی حلبی خودم که جای دخلم بود گذاشتم و در پستوی اطاقم پنهان کردم.,"I do not want anyone to ask me this question, but the essence of his face - no, it was his eyes and now I had these eyes, I had the spirit of his eyes on paper and I no longer use tension, this body that is doomed to nothingness and the prey of worms and It was basement rats! From now on he was in my possession, not me his puppet. I could see his eyes every minute I wanted to - I took the painting as carefully as I could, put it in my tin can, where I was hiding, and hid it in the closet of my room.","I prefer not to be asked this question. But the essential was her face, or, rather, her eyes – and now they were in my possession. I had fixed on paper the spirit which had inhabited those eyes and I had no further need of the body, that body which was doomed to disappear, to become the prey of the worms and rats of the grave. Henceforth she was in my power and I had ceased to be her creature. I could see her eyes whenever I felt inclined to do so. I took up my picture as carefully as I could, laid it in a tin box which served me as a safe and put the box away in the closet behind my room.","I do not want anyone to question me on this, but the main thing was her face—no, her eyes, and now I had possession of these eyes, I had on paper the soul of her eyes and I no longer had any use for her body, her body that was condemned to nothingness, the prey of worms and underground rats— Now, from here on out she was under my control , I was her minion no longer. Any moment that I was so inclined I could see her eyes—I placed the painting, with even greater care, in the tin box in which I kept my earnings and hid it in the closet of my room."
این زندگی من است!هر کس دیروز مرا دیده، جوان شکسته و ناخوشیدیده است ولی امروز پیرمرد قوزی می‌بیند که موهای سفید، چشمهای واسوخته و لب شکری دارد. من میترسم از پنجره اطاقم به بیرون نگاه بکنم، در آینه بخودم نگاه کنم. چون همه جا سایه های مضاعف خودم را میبینم - اما برای اینکه بتوانم زندگی خودم را برای سایه خمیده ام شرح بدهم باید یک حکایت نقل بکنم - او، چقد ر حکایتهایی راجع به ایام طفولیت،راجع بعشق، جماع، عروسی و مرگ وجود دارد و هیچکدام حقیقت ندارد - من از قصه ها و عبارت پردازی خسته شده ام. من سعی خواهم کرد که این خوشه را بفشارم ولی آیادر آن کمترین اثر از حقیقت وجود خواهد داشت یا نه - این را دیگر نمی‌دانم - من نمیدانم کجا هستم و این تکه آسمان بالای سرم، یا این چند وجب زمینی که رویش نشسته ام مال نیشابور یا بلخ و یا بنارس است - در هر صورت من به هیچ چیز اطمینان ندارم.,"This is my life! Everyone who saw me yesterday, the young man is broken and unhappy, but today the old man sees Ghozi with white hair, burnt eyes and sugary lips. I'm afraid to look out the window of my room, to look in the mirror. Because I see my double shadows everywhere - but in order to be able to describe my life for my curved shadow - I have to tell a story - how many tales there are about childhood, about love, sexual intercourse, marriage and death, and None of this is true - I'm tired of stories and phrases. I will try to squeeze this cluster, but whether or not there will be the slightest trace of the truth in it - I do not know this anymore - I do not know where I am and this piece of sky above my head, or these few wajibs of land on which I am sitting belong to Neishabour or Balkh or Varanasi - in any case, I do not trust anything.","He surely understands… It is my wish, when I have poured the juice – rather, the bitter wine – of my life down the parched throat of my shadow, to say to him, “This is my life.” Whoever saw me yesterday saw a wasted, sickly young man. Today he would see a bent old man with white hair, burnt-out eyes and a harelip. I am afraid to look out of the window of my room or to look at myself in the mirror, for everywhere I see my own shadow multiplied indefinitely. However, in order to explain my life to my stooping shadow, I am obliged to tell a story. Ugh! How many stories about love, copulation, marriage and death already exist, not one of which tells the truth! How sick I am of well-constructed plots and brilliant writing! I shall try to squeeze out the juice from this cluster of grapes, but whether or not the result will contain the slightest particle of truth I do not yet know. I do not know where I am at this moment, whether the patch of sky above my head and these few spans of ground on which I am sitting belong to Nishapur or to Balkh* or to Benares. I feel sure of nothing in the world.","As I squeeze, drop by drop, the juice, nay, the bitter wine of my life into the parched throat of my shadow, I want to say to him, “This is my life!” Whoever has seen me yesterday saw a hapless and sickly youth, but today they see a humpbacked old man who has white hair, festering eyes, and a harelip.

شلاق در هوا صدا کرد، اسبها نفس زنان براه افتادند. خیزهای بلند و ملایم برمی‌داشتند. پاهای آنها آهسته و بی صدا روی زمین گذاشته می‌شد. صدای زنگوله گردن آنها در هوای مرطوب به آهنگ مخصوصی مترنم بود - از پشت ابر ستاره ها مثل حدقه چشمهای براقی که از میان خون دلمه شده سیاه بیرون آمده باشند روی زمین را نگاه می‌کردند - آسایش گوارایی سرتاپایم را فراگرفت، فقط گلدان مثل وزن جسد مرده ای روی سینه مرا می‌فشرد - درختهای پیچ در پیچ با شاخه ها ی کج و کوله مثل این بود که در تاریکی از ترس اینکه مبادا بلغزند و زمین بخورند، دست یکدیگر را گرفته بودند. خانه های عجیب و غریب به شکلهای بریده بریده هندسی با پنجره های متروک سیاه کنار جاده رنج کشیده بودند. ولی بدنه دیوار این خانه مانند کرم شبتاب تعشع کدر و ناخوشی از خود متصاعد می‌کرد، درختها بحالت ترسناکی دسته دسته، ردیف ردیف، می‌گذشتند و از پی هم فرار می‌کردن ولی بنظر می‌آمد که ساقه نیلوفرها توی پای آنها می‌پیچند و زمین می‌خورند.,"A whip sounded in the air, the horses gasped. They raised long and gentle rises. Their feet were slowly placed on the ground. The sound of their bells ringing in the humid air was a special melody to me - from behind the superstars they looked at the earth like glittering eyes dripping with black scalded blood - comfort pervaded my feet, just a vase like the weight of a dead corpse. O squeezing my chest - the twisting trees with crooked branches were as if holding hands in the dark for fear of slipping and falling. Strange houses suffered in geometric cut shapes with abandoned black windows along the road. But the body of the wall of this house radiated like opium like a firefly, and the trees passed in fright, in rows, in rows, and fled in succession, but it seemed that the stems of the lilies twisted at their feet and fell to the ground.","The whip whistled through the air; the horses set off, breathing hard. They moved with high, smooth paces. Their hoofs touched the ground gently and silently. The bells around their necks played a strange tune in the damp air. In the gaps between the clouds, the stars gazed down at the earth like gleaming eyes emerging from a mass of coagulated blood. A wonderful sense of tranquillity pervaded my whole being. All that I could feel was the jar pressing against my chest with the weight of a dead body. The interlocking trees with their wry, twisted branches seemed in the darkness to be gripping one another by the hand for fear they should slip and crash to the ground. The sides of the road were lined with weird houses of individual geometrical shapes, with forlorn, black windows. The walls of the houses, like glow worms, gave forth a dim, sickly radiance. The trees passed by alarmingly in clumps and in rows and fled away from us. But it appeared to me that their feet became entangled in vines of morning glory which brought them to the ground.","The whip cracked in the air, the horses started moving with labored breaths. They moved with long and soft leaps, their hooves silently and gently touching the ground.

I was going to lose myself, like a stray dog that knows it must die. Like birds that hide when they die. I ran away from home, I ran away from the misfortune that had befallen me, I passed through the alleys without any definite purpose, I passed through the messes, all of them greedy and looking for money and fame. I did not need to see them because one of them was a representative. The rest was theirs.","When my condition improved I made up my mind to go away, to go somewhere where people would never find me again, like a dog with distemper who knows that he is going to die or like the birds that hide themselves when the time to die has come. Early one morning I rose, dressed, took a couple of cakes that were lying on the top shelf and, without attracting anyone’s attention, fled from the house. I was running away from my own misery. I walked aimlessly along the streets, I wandered without set purpose among the rabble-men as they hurried by, an expression of greed on their faces, in pursuit of money and sexual satisfaction. I had no need to see them since any one of them was a sample of the lot.","When my health improved, I decided to leave, to go and lose myself, like a leper dog that knows it must die, like the birds that hide as they are dying—I awoke early in the morning, put on my clothes, picked up two kolooches1 that were on the shelf and fled the house in a way no one would find out. I ran from the misery that had taken hold of me—I passed through the alleys unhindered, without a particular destination, I passed by the rabble who all had avaricious faces and who chased money and carnality—I did not need to see them, for one of them was a representative for all—they were all one mouth connected to a heap of intestines which ended in their reproductive organs."

پشت کوه یک محوطه خلوت، آرام و باصفا بود، یک جایی که هرگز ندیده بودم و نمی شناختم ولی به نظرم آشنا آمد مثل اینکه خارج از تصور من نبود - روی زمین از بته های نیلوفر کبود بی بو پوشیده شده بود، به نظر می آمد که تاکنون کسی پایش را در این محل نگذاشته بود - من چمدان را روی زمین گذاشتم، پیرمرد کالسگه چی رویش را برگرداند و گفت:,"Behind the mountain was a secluded, quiet area, a place I had never seen or known, but it seemed familiar to me as if it were beyond my imagination - the ground was covered with odorless lotus bushes.

از وقتی او را گم کردم، از زمانیکه یک دیوار سنگین، یک سد نمناک بدون روزنه بسنگینی سرب جلو من و او کشیده شد، حس کردم که زندگیم برای همیشه بیهوده و گم شده است. اگر چه نوازش نگاه و کیف عمیقی که از دیدنش برده بودم یکطرفه بود و جوابی برایم نداشت؛ زیرا او مرا ندیده بود، ولی من احتیاج باین چشمها داشتم و فقط یک نگاه او کافی بود که همهء مشکلات فلسفی و معماهای الهی را برایم حل کند - بیک نگاه او دیگر رمز و اسراری برایم وجود نداشت.,"Ever since I lost him, since a heavy wall, a damp barrier without a heavy lead hole was pulled in front of me and him, I have felt that my life has been lost and lost forever. Although the caress of the look and the deep bag I had taken from seeing it was one-sided and had no answer for me; Because he had not seen me, but I needed those eyes, and just one look was enough to solve all my philosophical problems and divine mysteries - with his look there was no more mystery for me.","Ever since I had lost her, ever since the aperture had been blocked and I had been separated from her by a heavy wall, a dank barrier as massive as a wall of lead, I felt that my existence had become pointless, that I had lost my way for all time to come. Even though the caress of her gaze and the profound delight I had experienced in seeing her had been only momentary and devoid of reciprocity – for she had not seen me – yet I felt the need of those eyes. One glance from her would have been sufficient to make plain all the problems of philosophy and the riddles of theology. One glance from her and mysteries and secrets would no longer have existed for me.","From the moment that I lost her, from the time a massive wall, a damp dam without an opening, as heavy as lead, was erected between us, I felt as if my life had become forever meaningless and lost. Even if my caressing gaze and the deep pleasure I took in seeing her were onesided and unrequited, it was only because she had not seen me. But I needed these eyes, and one look from her was enough to solve all philosophical problems and riddles of the divine—one look from her and secrets and riddles no longer had any meaning for me."
به نظرم آمد اگر یکی از پاهایم را تکان می‌دادم تعادلم از دست می‌رفت، یکنوع حالت سرگیجه برایم پیدا شده بود – زمین و موجوداتش بی اندازه از من دور شده بودند.,"It seemed to me that if I shook one of my legs I would lose my balance, I would feel dizzy - the earth and its creatures were far away from me.",It seemed to me that if I were to move one of my feet I should lose my balance.

نزدیک نهر سورن که رسیدم جلوم یک کوه خشک خالی پیدا شد. هیکل خشک و سخت کوه مرا بیاد دایه ام انداخت، نمی‌دانم چه رابطه ای بین آنها وجود داشت. از کنار کوه گذشتم، در یک محوطه کوچک و با صفائی رسیدم که اطرافش را کوه گرفته بود و بالای کوه یک قلعه بلند که با خشت های وزین ساخته بودند دیده می‌شد.,"When I reached the Soren creek, an empty dry mountain was found in front of me. The dry and hard structure of the mountain reminded me of my midwife, I do not know what the relationship was between them. I passed by the mountain, and reached a small, clear area surrounded by mountains, and at the top of the mountain was a tall castle made of heavy bricks.","I had nearly reached the river Suran when I found myself at the foot of a barren, stony hill. Its lean, hard contours put me in mind of my nurse; there was an indefinable resemblance between them. I skirted the hill and came upon a small, green enclosure surrounded on every side by hills. The level ground was covered with vines of morning glory, and on one of the hills stood a lofty castle built of massive bricks.",". . . When I neared the Suren River,1 a bare, dry mountain appeared. The parched and rigid figure of the mountain reminded me of my nanny, I do not know what connection there was between the two.

The ground was covered with patches of bruised morning glories and, on top of the mountain, a tall fort that had been made from heavy mud bricks was visible."
دوباره سکوت و تاریکی همه جا را فرا گرفت – من پیه سوز اطاقم را روشن نکردم، خوشم آمد که در تاریکی بنشینم – تاریکی، این ماده غلیظ سیال که در همه جا و در همه چیز تراوش میکند. من بان خو گرفته بودم.درتاریکی بودکه افکار گم شده ام، ترسهای فراموش شده، افکار مهیب باور نکردنی که نمی‌دانستم در کدام گوشه مغزم پنهان شده بود، همه از سر نو جان می‌گرفت، راه میافتاد و بمن دهن کجی میکرد – کنج اطاق، پشت پرده، کنار در، پر از این افکار و هیکلهای بی شکل و تهدید کننده بود.,"Silence and darkness spread everywhere again - I did not light the tallow in my room, I liked to sit in the dark - darkness, this concentrated fluid that seeps everywhere and in everything.

It was more pleasant to sit in the dark, that dense liquid which permeates everything and every place. I had grown accustomed to the dark. It was in the dark that my lost thoughts, my forgotten fears, the frightful, unbelievable ideas that had been lurking in some unknown recess of my brain, used to return to life, to move about and to grimace at me.

شب پاورچین پاورچین می‌رفت. گویا باندازهء کافی خستگی در کرده بود، صداهای دور دست خفیف بگوش می‌رسید، شاید یک مرغ یا پرندهء رهگذری خواب میدید، شاید گیاه ها میروییدند- در این وقت ستاره ای رنگ پریده پشت توده های ابر ناپدید می‌شدند. روی صورتم نفس ملایم صبح را حس کردم و در همین وقت بانگ خروس از دور بلند شد.,"Powerchin night PowerChin was going.

Everyone in the house had long been in bed. It was the hour just before dawn, the time when, as sick people know, one’s being seems to transcend the boundaries of the world. My heart was beating hard but I experienced no fear. My eyes were open but I could see no one, for the darkness was intense. Several minutes passed. An idea, a sick man’s idea, came into my mind.

It seemed to me that I had long known her name. The radiance of her eyes, her complexion, her perfume, her movements, all appeared familiar to me, as though, in some previous existence in a world of dreams, my soul had lived side by side with hers, had sprung from the same root and the same stock and it was inevitable that we should be brought together again.","During this time I was beside myself, it was as if I had known her name from before. The sparkle of her eyes, her color, her smell and movements all seemed familiar to me, as if in a former life, in the realm of purgatory, our souls had been conjoined, of one source and one substance, destined to join again."
من خودم را تا این اندازه بدبخت و نفرین زده گمان نمیکردم، ولی بواسطه حس جنایتی که در من پنها ن بود، در عین حال خوشی بی دلیلی، خوشی غریبی بمن دست داد - چون فهمیدم که یک نفر همدرد قدیمی‌داشته ام - آیا این نقاش قدیم، نقاشی که روی این کوزه را صدها شاید هزاران سال پیش نقاشی کرده بود همدرد من نبود؟ آیا همین عوالم مرا طی نکرده بود؟,"I did not think I was so miserable and cursed, but because of the sense of guilt that lurked in me, I also felt unreasonable, strange joy - because I realized I had an old sympathizer - - is this an old painter? Was not the painting he painted on this jar hundreds, maybe thousands of years ago my sympathy? Did not these worlds pass me by?","I had not known that I was ill-starred and accursed to such a degree as this. And yet at the same time the sense of guilt that lurked in my mind gave rise to a strange, inexplicable feeling of comfort. I realized that I had an ancient partner in sorrow. Was not that ancient painter who, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago, had decorated the surface of this jar my partner in sorrow? Had he not undergone the same spiritual experiences as I?","I had not considered myself unfortunate and accursed to such a degree. However, by way of a sense of malefaction that was hidden in me, at the same time an unfamiliar happiness, a reasonless happiness, came over me—because I understood that I had a commiserator from the past—was not this painter from times past, a painter who painted on this jug hundreds, maybe thousands of years ago, my commiserator? Did not the same worlds pass through me?"
خانه ایکه فقط روی قلمدانهای قدیم ممکن است نقاشی کرده باشند. باید همه ء اینها را بنویسم تا ببینم که بخودم مشتبه نشده باشد، باید همهء اینها را بسایهء خودم که روی دیوار افتاده است توضیح بدهم - آری، پیشتر برایم فقط یک دلخوشکنک مانده بود. میان چهار دیوار اطاقم روی قلمدان نقاشی می‌کردم و با این سرگرمی‌مضحک وقت را می‌گذرانیدم، اما بعد از آنکه آن دو چشم را دیدم، بعد از آنکه او را دیدم اصلا معنی، مفهوم و ارزش هر جنبش و حرکتی از نظرم افتاد - ولی چیزی که غریب، چیزیکه باورنکردنی است نمی‌دانم چرا موضوع مجلس همهء نقاشیهای من از ابتدا یک جور و یک شکل بوده است. همیشه یک درخت سرو می‌کشیدم که زیرش پیرمردی قوز کرده شبیه جوکیان هندوستان عبا به خودش پیچیده، چنباتمه نشسته و دور سرش شالمه بسته بود و انگشت سبااه دست چپش را به حالت تعجب به لبش گذاشته بود. - روبروی او دختری با لباس سیاه بلند خم شده به او کل نیلوفر تعارف میکرد- چون میان آنها یک جوی آب فاصله داشت - آیا این مجلس را من سابقا دیده بوده ام، یا در خواب به من الهام شده بود؟ نمی‌دانم، فقط می‌دانم که هر چه نقاشی می‌کردم همه اش همین مجلس و همین موضوع بود، دستم بدون اراده این تصویر را می‌کشید و غریب تر آنکه برای این نقش مشتری پیدا میشد و حتی بتوسط عمویم از این جلد قلمدانها بهندوستان می‌فرستادم که می‌فروخت و پولش را برایم میفرستاد. این مجلس در عین حال بنظرم دور و نزدیک میآمد،درست یادم نیست - حالا قضیه ای به خاطرم آمد- گفتم: باید یادبودهای خودم را بنویسم، ولی این پیش آمد خیلی بعد اتفاق افتاده و ربطی به موضوع ندارد و در اثر همین اتفاق از نقاشی بکلی دست کشیدم - دوماه پیش، نه، دو ماه و چهار روز میگذرد. سیزده نوروز بود. همه مردم بیرون شهر هجوم آورده بودند - من پنجرهء اطاقم را بسته بودم، برای اینکه سر فارغ نقاشی بکنم، نزدیک غروب گرم نقاشی بودم یکمرتبه در باز شد و عمویم وارد شد- یعنی خودش گفت که عموی من است، من هرگز او را ندیده بودم، چون از ابتدای جوانی به مسافرت دوردستی رفته بود. گویا ناخدای کشتی بود، تصور کردم شاید کار تجارتی با من دارد، چون شنیده بودم که تجارت هم می‌کند - بهرحال عمویم پیرمردی بود قوزکرده که شالمهء هندی دور سرش بسته بود، عبای زرد پاره ای روی دوشش بود و سر و رویش را با شال گردن پیچیده بود، یخه اش باز و سینه پشم آلودش دیده می‌شد. ریش کوسه اش را که از زیر شال گردن بیرون آمده بود می‌شد دانه دانه شمرد، پلک های ناسور سرخ و لب شکری داشت - یک شباهت دور و مضحک با من داشت. مثل اینکه عکس من روی آینه دق افتاده باشد - من همیشه شکل پدرم را پیش خودم همین جور تصور می‌کردم، بمحض ورود رفت کنار اطاق چنباته زد- من به فکرم رسید که برای پذیرایی او چیزی تهیه بکنم، چراغ را روشن کردم، رفتم در پستوی تاریک اطاقم، هر گوشه را وارسی کردنتا شاید بتوانم چیزی باب دندان او پیدا کنم، اگر چه می‌دانستم که در خانه چیزی به هم نمی‌رسد، چون نه تریاک برایم مانده بود و نه مشروب - ناگهان نگاهم ببالای رف افتاد - گویا بمن الهام شد، دیدم یک بغلی شراب کهنه که به من ارث رسیده بود - گویا بمناسبت تولد من این شراب را انداخته بودند - بالای رف بود، هیچوقت من به این صرافت نیفتاده بودم اصلا به کلی یادم رفته بود،که چنین چیزی در خانه هست. برای اینکه دستم به رف برسد چهارپایه ای را که آنجا بود زیر پایم گذاشتم ولی همین که آمدم بغلی را بردارم ناگهان از سوراخ هواخور رف چشمم به بیرون افتاد - دیدم در صحرای پشت اطاقم پیرمردی قوزکرده، زیر درخت سروی نشسته بود و یک دختر جوان، نه - یک فرشتهء آسمانی جلو او ایستاده، خم شده بود و با دست راست گل نیلوفر کبودی به او تعارف می‌کرد، در حالی که پیرمرد ناخن انگشت سبابهء دست چپش را میجوید.,"A house that may have been painted only on old pens. I have to write it all down to see if I'm not suspicious of myself, I have to explain it all by myself on the wall - yes, I used to have only one happiness left. I used to paint on the pen between the four walls of my room and spend time with this ridiculous pastime, but after seeing those two eyes, after seeing him, I completely lost the meaning, concept and value of every movement - but something strange. , Which is unbelievable I do not know why the subject of the assembly of all my paintings has been the same from the beginning. I always planted a cedar tree with an old man hunched over like an Indian jockey, wrapped in a robe, sitting cross-legged and wearing a shawl around his head, and the sabah finger of his left hand on his lip in surprise. - In front of him, a girl in a long black dress bowed and complimented him on the whole lotus - because there was an atmosphere of water between them - had I seen this house before, or was it inspired by me in a dream? I do not know, I only know that everything I painted was all about this house and this subject, my hand involuntarily drew this picture, and strangely enough, a client could be found for this role, and I even sent it to my friends through this volume of pens that he sold and paid for. He was sending it to me. At the same time, I think this assembly was coming and going, I do not remember correctly - now I remembered a case - I said: I have to write my memoirs, but this happened much later and has nothing to do with the subject and as a result of this painting. I gave up completely - two months ago, no, two months and four days have passed. It was the thirteenth of Nowruz. Everyone was rushing out of the city - I had closed the window of my room, to paint my head, I was painting near sunset. The door suddenly opened and my uncle entered - meaning he said he was my uncle, I had never seen him. , Because from the beginning of his youth he had gone on a long journey. As if he were the captain of a ship, I thought maybe he was doing business with me, because I had heard that he was doing business too - after all, my uncle was an old man with a hooded Indian shawl around his head, a torn yellow robe on his shoulder and a scarf It was tangled, its ice was open and its woolly chest was visible. His shark's beard, which protruded from under his scarf, could be counted as grainy, had red rosy eyelids and a sugary lip - it bore a ridiculous resemblance to mine. It was as if my picture had been knocked on the mirror - I always imagined my father's face to me like this, as soon as he entered he went to the room - he thought - I would prepare something for his reception, I turned on the light, I went to the post office Dark in my room, checking every nook and cranny so I might find something on his teeth, even though I knew there was nothing wrong with the house, because I had no opium left and no alcohol - I suddenly looked up at the shelf - as if inspired, I saw An old wine bottle that I had inherited - as if it had been dumped on my birthday - was on the shelf, I had never been in such a state, I had completely forgotten that such a thing is at home. To put my hand on the ledge, I put the stool under it, but as soon as I came to pick it up, my eyes suddenly fell out of the vent hole of the ledge - I saw an old man hunched over in the desert behind my room, sitting under a survey tree, and a young girl. No - a celestial angel was standing in front of him, bent over and greeting a blue lotus flower with his right hand, while the old man bit the fingernail of his left hand.","They are the sort of houses which one finds depicted only on the covers of ancient pen cases. I am obliged to set all this down on paper in order to disentangle the various threads of my story. I am obliged to explain it all for the benefit of my shadow on the wall. Yes, in the past only one consolation, and that a poor one, remained to me. Within the four walls of my room I painted my pictures on the pen cases and thereby, thanks to this ludicrous occupation of mine, managed to get through the day. But when once I had seen those two eyes, once I had seen her, activity of any sort lost all meaning, all content, all value for me. I would mention a strange, an incredible thing. For some reason unknown to me the subject of all my painting was from the very beginning one and the same. It consisted always of a cypress tree at the foot of which was squatting a bent old man like an Indian fakir. He had a long cloak wrapped about him and wore a turban on his head. The index finger of his left hand was pressed to his lips in a gesture of surprise. Before him stood a girl in a long black dress, leaning towards him and offering him a flower of morning glory. Between them ran a little stream. Had I seen the subject of this picture at some time in the past or had it been revealed to me in a dream? I do not know. What I do know is that whenever I sat down to paint I reproduced the same design, the same subject. My hand independently of my will always depicted the same scene. Strangest of all, I found customers for these paintings of mine. I even dispatched some of my pen-case covers to India through the intermediary of my paternal uncle, who used to sell them and remit the money to me. Somehow I always felt this subject to be remote and, at the same time, curiously familiar to me. I don’t remember very well … It occurs to me that I once said to myself that I must write down what I remember of all this – but that happened much later and has nothing to do with the subject of my painting. Moreover, one consequence of this experience was that I gave up painting altogether. That was two months, or, rather exactly, two months and four days ago. It was the thirteenth day of Nouruz. * Everyone had gone out to the country. I had shut the window of my room in order to be able to concentrate on my painting. It was not long before sunset and I was working away when suddenly the door opened and my uncle came into the room. That is, he said he was my uncle. I had never seen my uncle in my life, for he had been abroad ever since his early youth. I seem to remember that he was a sea captain. I imagined he might have some business matter to discuss with me, since I understood that he was interested in commerce as well. At all events my uncle was a bent old man with an Indian turban on his head and a ragged yellow cloak on his back; his face was partly concealed by a scarf wrapped around his neck; his shirt was open and revealed a hairy chest. It would have been possible to count the hairs of the sparse beard protruding from under the scarf which muffled his neck. His eyelids were red and sore and he had a harelip. He resembled me in a remote, comical way like a reflection in a distorting mirror. I had always pictured my father something like this. On entering the room he walked straight across to the opposite wall and squatted on the floor. It occurred to me that I ought to offer him some refreshment in honour of his arrival. I lit the lamp and went into the little dark closet which opens off my room. I searched every corner in the hope of finding something suitable to offer him, although I knew there was nothing of the sort in the house – I had no opium or drink left. Suddenly my eye lighted on the topmost of the shelves on the wall. It was as though I had had a flash of inspiration. On the shelf stood a bottle of old wine which had been left me by my parents. I seem to remember hearing that it had been laid down on the occasion of my birth. There it was on the top shelf. I had never so much as given it a thought and had quite forgotten there was such a thing in the house. To reach the shelf I got up onto a stool which happened to be there. As I reached towards the bottle, I chanced to look out through the ventilation hole above the shelf. On the open ground outside my room I saw a bent old man sitting at the foot of a cypress tree with a young girl – no, an angel from heaven – standing before him. She was leaning forwards and with her right hand was offering him a blue flower of morning glory. The old man was biting the nail of the index finger on his left hand.","—I do not know what tasteless or mad man from time immemorial built this house; when I close my eyes I not only see all of its nooks and crannies, but I also feel their entire weight upon my shoulders—a house that could only have been painted on ancient pen cases. I have to write down all of this to make sure I have not been in error myself, I have to explain all of this to my shadow that is cast on the wall— Yes, previously there was only one thing that was left that made me happy—between the four walls of my room I painted on pen cases and passed the time with this absurd diversion, but after I saw those two eyes, after I saw her, the meaning and the worth of any movement or action left my mind—but what is strange, what is unbelievable, is that I do not know why, from the beginning, all the scenes of my paintings appeared exactly the same: I always painted a hunched-over old man that looked like a Hindu yogi, wearing a cloak with a turban wrapped around his head, squatting underneath a cypress tree, who, with an astonished look, placed the index finger of his left hand to his lips— In front of him a damsel in a long black dress, bent over, was offering him a morning glory flower1—for between them there was a small stream —had I seen this scene before or did it appear before me in a dream? I do not know. The only thing I am certain of is that I always ended up painting the same subject and the same scene, my hand involuntarily painted this scene, and stranger still, there were customers interested in this subject and, through my uncle, I even sent these pen cases to India where he would sell them and send the money back to me. This scene seemed to me at once both familiar and distant, I can not exactly recall —I have just remembered this —I said I have to write down my memories—but this incident happened much later and has nothing to do with this, and it was because of this incident that I put aside my paintbrush—two months ago— no two months and four days have gone by. It was the thirteenth day of Norooz.1 The entire populace had swooped down upon the countryside—I had closed the window of my room in order to paint without interruption. It was dusk, I was engrossed in painting when suddenly the door opened and my uncle entered—that is to say , he himself told me he was my uncle , I had never seen him before, he had been on a faraway journey since the beginning of my childhood, perhaps he was the captain of a ship— I imagined he had some business dealing with me because I heard he was a merchant as well— In any case my uncle was a hunched-over old man with an Indian turban on his head, wearing a tattered yellow robe with a shawl wrapped around his face, his hairy chest visible underneath his open collar —you could count, one by one, the hairs of his beard that stuck out from underneath his shawl, he had a harelip and red, festering eyelids. He had a remote and comical similarity to myself, as if my image had been cast upon ayine-ye deq2—I always imagined that my father looked like this. As soon as he entered, he went to the corner of the room and squatted—It occurred to me that I should offer him something —I lit the lamp, went into the dark closet of my room and searched all around to see if I could find something—even if I knew there was nothing in the house as I did not have any opium or wine left— Suddenly my gaze turned to the top shelf —perhaps it was a revelation, I saw that a flask of old wine that I had inherited—maybe they made this wine for the commemoration of my birth—was on the top shelf, never had I entertained such a notion, I had completely forgotten that there was such a thing in the house— In order to reach the top shelf, I stood on top of the stool but as I reached for the flask my gaze suddenly shifted to the small vent that led to the outside— In the field behind my room, I saw a hunched-over old man sitting underneath a cypress tree, and a damsel—no, a celestial angel was standing in front of him, slightly bent over, offering a bruised morning glory to him with her right hand, meanwhile, the old man was chewing the fingernail of his left index finger."
به هرحال، من بچه شیرخوار بودم که در بغل همین ننجون گذاشتندم و ننجون دختر عمه ام، همین زن لکاته مرا هم شیر میداده است. و من زیر دست عمه ام آن زن بلند بالا که موهای خاکستری روی پیشانیش بود، در همین خانه با دخترش بزرگ شدم.,"Anyway, I was a baby when I put the same nun next to me and my cousin's nun, the same Lakata woman also breastfed me. And I grew up in the same house with her daughter under my aunt, the tall woman with gray hair on her forehead.","At all events I was a little baby when I was entrusted to the care of my nurse. Nanny also suckled my aunt’s daughter, the bitch my wife. I grew up in the family of my aunt, the tall woman with the grey hair around her temples, in the same house as the bitch, her daughter.","In any case, I was a nursing baby when they placed me in the arms of this same Nane-joon, and Nane-joon also nursed my aunt’s daughter, this same whore of mine, and I was raised by my aunt, that tall lady with the grey hair hanging over her temple, in this same house, with her daughter, this same whore—As soon as I came to know myself, I took my aunt for my mother and loved her, so much"
بالاخره حکیم باشی را خبر کردند، حکیم رجاله ها، حکیم خانوادگی که بقول خودش ما را بزرگ کرده بود.,"Finally, they announced Hakim Bashi, the sage of the rijals, the sage of the family who, according to him, had raised us.","At last they sent word to the doctor, the rabble doctor, the family doctor who, in his own words, had “brought us all up”.","In the end, they sent word to Hakim-bashi,1 the doctor of the rabble, the family doctor who, in his own words, “raised us.”"
وقتی که خواستم در رختخواب بروم چند بار با خودم گفتم:,"When I wanted to go to bed, I said to myself several times:","When at last I went back to bed, I said to myself, “Death…death…”","When I wanted to go to bed, several times I uttered to myself, “Death . . ."
(من احمقم) در این وقت یک چیز باور نکردنی دیدم. در باز شد و آن لکاته آمد.معلوم میشود که گاهی بفکر من میافتد - باز هم جای شکرش باقی است. فقط می‌خواستم بدانم آیا میدانست که برای خاطر اوبود که من میمردم.این لکاته که وارد اطاقم شد افکار بدم فرار کرد.نمیدانم چه اشعه ای از وجودش، از حرکتش تراوش میکرد که بمن تسکین میداد آیا این همان زن لطیف، همان دختر ظریف اثیری بود که لباس سیاه چین خورده می‌پوشید و کنار نهر سورن با هم سرمامک بازی میکردیم.تا حالا که باو نگاه میکردم درست متوجه نمیشدم. راستش از صورت او، از چشمهای او خجالت می‌کشیدم. زنی که بهمه کس تن در میداد الا بمن و من فقط خودم را بیاد بود موهوم بچگی او تسلیت میداد م. آنوقتی که یک صورت ساده بچگانه، یک حالت محو گذرنده داشت و هنوز جای دندان پیر مردخنزری سر گذر روی صورتش دیده نمیشد - نه این همانکس نبود.او به طعنه پرسید که (حالت چطوره؟) من جوابش دادم: (آیا تو آزاد نیستی) آیا هر چی دلت می‌خواد نمیکنی - بسلامتی من چکارداری؟او در را بهم زد و رفت. اصلا برنگشت بمن نگاه بکنه. او همان زنی که گمان می‌کرد م عاری از هر گونه احساسات است از این حرکت من رنجید.چند بار خواستم بلند شوم بروم روی دست و پایش بیفتم گریه بکنم پوزش بخواهم. چند دقیقه، چند ساعت،یا چند قرن گذشت نمیدانم.,"(I'm stupid) I saw something incredible at this time. The door opened and Lakata came. It turns out that sometimes he thinks of me - there is still room for gratitude. I just wanted to know if he knew it was because of him that I was dying. This stuttering that entered my room made my thoughts run away. He was wearing a black pleated dress and we were playing cold games together by the Soren creek. Until now, when I looked at Bao, I did not understand. Honestly, I was ashamed of his face, of his eyes. The woman who accepted everyone except me and I only remembered myself. Her imaginary childhood comforted me. When he had a simple childish face, a fading state, and no trace of the old man's tooth on his face could be seen yet - no, it was not the same. He asked sarcastically, ""How are you?"" Aren't you doing whatever you want - what are you doing to my health? He slammed the door and left. Do not look at me at all. She was the same woman who thought she was free of any emotions. I was upset by this move. I do not know how many minutes, how many hours, or how many centuries have passed.","Perhaps I was talking to my shadow in order to dispel my loneliness. And then I saw an incredible thing. The door opened and the bitch came into the room. So then, she used to think of me at times and in spite of everything I still had reason to feel grateful to her. She knew that I was still alive, that I was suffering, that I was slowly dying. In spite of everything I still had reason to feel grateful to her. I only wondered whether she knew that I was dying because of her. If she did know that I would die perfectly happy. At that moment I was the happiest man on the face of the earth. Merely by coming into the room the bitch had driven away all my evil thoughts. Some sort of radiation emanated from her, from her movements, and brought me relief. On this occasion she was in better health than when I had last seen her. She was plump and comfortable-looking. She had on a cloak of Tus material. Her eyebrows were plucked and were stained with indigo. She was wearing a beauty spot and her face was made up with rouge, ceruse and kohl. In a word she was turned out to perfection. She appeared to be well pleased with life. She was unconsciously holding the index finger of her left hand to her lips. Was this the same graceful creature, was this the slim, ethereal girl who, in a black pleated dress, had played hide-and-seek with me on the bank of the Suran, the unconstrained, childlike, frail girl whose ankles, appearing from under her skirt, had so excited me? Until this moment, when I had looked at her I had not seen her as she really was. Now it was as though a veil had fallen from my eyes. For some reason the thought of the sheep hanging by the door of the butcher’s shop occurred to me. She had become for me the equivalent of a lump of butcher’s meat. Her old enchantment had gone. She had become a comfortable, solid woman with a head full of commonplace, practical ideas – a genuine woman. I realized with affright that my wife was now a grown-up while I had remained a child. I actually felt ashamed in her presence, under her gaze. This woman who yielded her body to everyone but me while I consoled myself with fanciful memories of her childhood, when her face was simple and innocent and wore a dreamy, fleeting expression, this woman whose face still bore the tooth-marks of the old odds-and-ends man in the square – no, this was not the same person as I had known. She asked me in a sarcastic tone, “How are you feeling?” I replied, “Aren’t you perfectly free? Don’t you do everything you feel like doing? What does my health matter to you?” She left the room, slamming the door behind her. She did not turn to look at me. It seems as though I have forgotten how to talk to the people of this world, to living people. She, the woman who I had thought was devoid of all feelings, was offended at my behaviour! Several times I thought of getting up and going to her to fall at her feet, weeping and asking her to forgive me. Yes, weeping; for I thought that if only I could weep I should find relief. Some time passed; whether it was to be measured in minutes, hours or centuries I do not know.","then I added, “I’m a fool!”—I was not aware of the meaning of the words I was uttering, I only enjoyed the vibration of my voice in the air, maybe I was talking to my shadow to dispel the loneliness— At this moment I saw an unbelievable thing— The door opened and that whore came in, it was apparent that she thought of me once in a while—there is still a reason to be grateful—she also knew that I was still alive and suffering, and that I would die slowly—there was still a reason to be grateful—I only wanted to know if she knew that it was for her I was dying—if she knew, then I could die in peace and happiness—then I would be the luckiest person on earth—When this whore entered the room, all my dark thoughts fled, I do not know what rays were emanating from her body, from her movements, that soothed me— This time she was feeling better, she looked plump and mature—she wore an arkhalogh1 with dark grey samboosehs, she had plucked her eyebrows, painted on a mole, she had colored her eyebrows, she had applied rouge, white powder, and eyeliner. In short, she had entered my room completely dressed up. It was as if she were completely content with her life, and she unconsciously placed the index finger of her left hand in her mouth— Was this the same fair woman, the same delicate ethereal girl who used to wear a wrinkled black dress and who used to play sarmamak with me by the banks of the Suren River, the same girl who had a fleeting and childlike aura of freedom and whose lust-inspiring ankles could be seen underneath her skirt? Until now, when I looked at her, I had not fully comprehended, but now it was as if a veil had been lifted before my eyes— I do not know why I was reminded of the sheep in front of the butcher’s shop —She had become but a piece of boneless meat and had completely lost that alluring quality of the past —she had become a solid, mature and rosy-colored woman who was preoccupied with life, a genuine woman—my wife!—Frightened and terrified, I saw that my wife had grown up and become mature while I remained in the state of childhood— To be truthful, I felt embarrassed before her eyes, her face—a wife who gave her body to everyone but me, and I merely consoled myself with the fanciful memory of her childhood, a time when she had a plain childlike face, when she had an evanescent and fleeting state of being, and when the impression of the old peddler’s teeth had yet to be seen on her face— no, this was not that same person. With derision she asked, “How are you doing?” I answered, “Aren’t you free, don’t you do whatever you like— what’s my health to you?” She slammed the door and left, she did not even turn to look at me. It seems I had forgotten the manner of speaking with the people of the world, with living people—She—the same woman who I thought was devoid of any kind of feeling, was offended by this act of mine. Several times I wanted to get up and throw myself at her feet, to cry, to ask for forgiveness—yes, cry, for I thought if I could cry, I would find relief—Several minutes, several hours or several centuries past"
اغلب برا ی فراموشی، برا ی فرار از خودم، ایام بچگی خودم را بیاد می‌آورم. برای اینکه خودم را در حال قبل از ناخوشی حس نکنم – حس بکنم که سالمم – هنوز حس می‌کردم که بچه هستم و برای مرگم، برای معدوم شدنم یک نفس دومی‌بود که بحال من ترحم میاورد، به حال این بچه ای که خواهد مرد – در مواقع ترسناک زندگی خودم، همین که صورت آرام دایه ام را می‌دیدم، صورت رنگ پریده، چشمهای گود و بیحرکت و کدر و پره های نازک بینی و پیشانی استخوانی پهن او را که میدیدم، یادگارهای آنوقت درمن بیدار می‌شد – یک خال گوشتی روی شقیقه ام بود که رویش مو در آورده بود – گویا فقط امروز متوجه خال او شد م، فقط پیشتر که بصورتش نگان می‌کردم اینطور دقیق نمی‌شدم.,"I often remember my childhood days for forgetfulness, to escape from myself. In order not to feel sick before - to feel healthy - I still felt like a child, and for my death, to be annihilated, there was a second breath that took pity on me, now that the child was going to die - at times. The horror of my own life, as soon as I saw the calm face of my nanny, the pale face, the sunken and motionless eyes and the dimness and the thin nostrils and the broad bony forehead that I saw, the memories of that time awoke in me - there was a mole on my forehead He had hair on his face - it was as if I only noticed his mole today, I just was not so precise when I was painting his face.","I often used to recall the days of my childhood in order to forget the present, in order to escape from myself. I tried to feel as I did in the days before I fell ill. Then I would have the sensation that I was still a child and that inside me there was a second self which felt sorry for this child who was about to die. In my moments of crisis one glimpse of my nurse’s calm, pallid face with its deep set, dim, unmoving eyes, thin nostrils, and broad, bony forehead, was enough to revive in me the sensations of my childhood. Perhaps she emitted some mysterious radiation which created this peace of mind in me. On her forehead there was a fleshy birthmark with hairs sprouting from it. I do not remember having noticed it before today. Previously when I looked at her face I did not scrutinize it so closely.","Often, in order to forget, in order to escape from myself, I will reminisce about my childhood so that I may feel the way I did prior to becoming ill—feel that I am healthy—I still felt that I was a child but that for my death, for my extinction, there was a second breath that would feel pity for my plight, for the plight of this child that was about to die—During the terrible times of my life, as soon as I saw the tranquil face of my nanny, as soon as I saw her pale face, motionless and opaque deep-set eyes, thin nostrils and broad bony forehead, the remembrances of those days would awaken in me—Perhaps mysterious beams were emanating from her, causing a tranquility in me—she had a fleshy mole that was hairy on her temple—it seems that it was only on this day that I noticed her mole, previously when I looked at her face I did not pay such close attention."
آنجا کنار پرده یک هیکل ترسناک نشسته بود تکان نمی‌خورد، نه غمناک بود و نه خوشحال. هر دفعه که بر می‌گشتم توی تخم چشمم نگاه می‌کرد – به صورت او آشنا بودم، مثل این بود که در بچگی همین صورت را دیده بودم –یکروز سیزده به در بود، کنار نهر سورن من به بچه ها سرمامک بازی میکردم، همین صورت بنظرم آمد ه بود که با صورتهای معمولی دیگر که قد کوتاه و مضحک و بی خطر داشتند، بمن ظاهر شده بود، صورتش شبیه همین مرد قصاب روبروی دریچه اطاقم بود. گویا این شخص در زندگی من دخالت داشته است و اورا زیاد دیده بودم – گویا این سایه همزاد من بود و در دایره محدود زندگی من واقع شده بود...,"There sat a curtain of a frightening body, it did not move, it was neither sad nor happy. Every time I came back he would look me in the eye - I knew his face, it was as if I had seen the same face as a child - one day it was thirteen o'clock, by the Soren creek I was playing cold games with the children, this is how I thought He had appeared to me with other ordinary faces that were short, ridiculously and harmlessly tall, his face resembling that of a butcher in front of the door of my room. It seems that this person has been involved in my life and I have seen him a lot - it seems that this shadow was my twin and was located in the limited circle of my life ...","There, beside the curtain, sat one fearful shape. It never stirred, it was neither gloomy nor cheerful. Every time I came back to my room it gazed steadily into my eyes. Its face was familiar to me. It seemed to me that I had seen that face at some time in my childhood. Yes, it was on the thirteenth day of Nouruz. I was playing hide-and-seek with some other children on the bank of the river Suran when I caught sight of that same face amid a crowd of other, ordinary faces set on top of funny, reassuring little bodies. It reminded me of the butcher opposite the window of my room. I felt that this shape had its place in my life and that I had seen it often before. Perhaps this shadow had been born along with me and moved within the restricted circuit of my existence…",". . . There, beside the curtain, a terrifying figure was seated, unmoving, he was neither happy nor sad, each time that I turned around he stared into the depths of my eyes— His face was familiar to me, as if I had seen this very face in my childhood— It was on a Sizdahbedar, I was playing sarmamak with some children by the bank of the Suren River, it had seemed to me that this same face appeared beside the ordinary faces of those who were short, funny and harmless— His face was similar to this same butcher outside my window, across the street. It seems that this individual has been involved with my life and I had seen him often—as if this shadow were my twin and situated in the narrow circle of my life."
چون در نتیجه این آزمایش اختلال فکری برایش پیدا شده بوده زندگی سابق خود را بکلی فراموش کرده و بچه را نمیشناخته. از این رو تصور کرده اند که عمویم بوده است - آیا همه این افسانه مربوط بزندگی من نیست، یا انعکاس این خنده چندش انگیز و وحشت این آزمایش تاثیر خودش را در من نگذاشته و مربوط به من نمیشود؟,"Because as a result of this test, he was found to have a mental disorder, he completely forgot his previous life and did not know the child. So they thought it was my uncle - is not all this myth about my life, or the reflection of this multifaceted laughter and horror of this experiment not affecting me and not me?",The “trial” had deranged his mind and he had completely lost his memory. He did not recognize the infant and it was this that made them decide he must be my uncle. May it not be that this story has some strange bearing upon my personal history and that that gooseflesh-raising peal of laughter and the horror of the “trial by cobra” have left their imprint upon me and are somehow pertinent to my destiny?,"for at the completion of this trial a disturbance of his mental faculties had resulted, he had utterly forgotten his former life and did not recognize the baby. For this reason, they imagined him to be my uncle— Are not all these stories relevant to my life, have not the echo of this repulsive laughter and the horror of this trial left their impression on me, and are they not relevant to me?"
اغلب حالت وحشت برایم کیف و مستی خاصی داشت بطوری که سرم گیج می‌رفت وزانوهایم سست می‌شد و می‌خواستم قی بکنم. ناگهان ملتفت شدم که روی پاهایم ایستاده بودم.,"I was often in a state of panic and drunkenness, so my head was dizzy and my knees were weak and I wanted to vomit. Suddenly I realized I was standing on my feet.","The sensation of horror as usual aroused in me a feeling of exquisite, intoxicating pleasure which made my head swim and my knees give way and filled me with nausea. Suddenly I realized that I was still standing.",Oftentimes the state of fear created pleasure and a particular drunkenness such that I would become dizzy and my knees would become weak and I would have the urge to vomit —Suddenly I was aware that I was standing on my own two feet—
حالت افسرده و شادی غم انگیزش همه اینها نشان میداد که او مانند مردمان معمولی نیست، اصلا خوشگلی او معمولی نبود، او مثل یک منظره رویای افیونی به من جلوه کرد... او همان حرارت عشقی مهر گیاه را در من تولید کرد. اندام نازک و کشیده با خط متناسبی که از شانه، بازو، پستانها، سینه، کپل و ساق پاهایش پایین می‌رفت مثل این بود که تن او را از آغوش جفتش بیرون کشیده باشند - مثل مادهء مهر گیاه بود که از بغل جفتش جدا کرده باشند.,"The depressed state and sadness of all this showed that he was not like ordinary people, his beauty was not ordinary at all, he seemed to me like a scene of an opium dream ... He produced the same love heat of plant love in me. The slender, elongated limb, with a well-proportioned line descending from her shoulders, arms, breasts, chest, hips, and legs, was as if her body had been pulled out of her mate's arms - like the seal of a plant severed from her mate.","Her air of mingled gaiety and sadness set her apart from ordinary mankind. Her beauty was extraordinary. She reminded me of a vision seen in an opium sleep. She aroused in me a heat of passion like that which is kindled by the mandrake root. It seemed to me that as I gazed at her long slender form, with its harmonious lines of shoulder, arm, breasts, waist, buttocks and legs, that she had been torn from her husband’s embrace, that she was like the female mandrake which has been plucked from the arms of its mate.","Her sad expression and her joy filled with sorrow, all of these showed that she was not like ordinary people , for certain her beauty was not pedestrian, she appeared before me as having stepped out of an opium-laced paradise. She created an arousal in me like that which is derived from mandrake. Her long and slender limbs and the symmetric line that went down from her shoulders, arms, breasts, chest, buttocks and calves seemed as if they had just been torn from her lover’s embrace—as if she was the female mandrake that had just been torn from her lover’s embrace."
میان چهاردیواری که اطاق مرا تشکیل میدهد و حصاری که دور زندگی و افکار من کشیده، زندگی من مثل شمع خرده خرده آب میشود، نه، اشتباه میکنم - مثل یک کنده هیزم تر است که گوشه دیگدان افتاده و بآتش هیزمهای دیگر برشته و زغال شده، ولی نه سوخته است و نه تر و تازه مانده، فقط از دود و دم دیگران خفه شده. اطاقم مثل همه اطاقها با خشت و آجر روی خرابه هزاران خانه های قدیمی‌ساخته شده، بدنه سفید کرده و یک حاشیه کتیبه دارد - درست شبیه مقبره است - کمترین حالات و جزئیات اطاقم کافی است که ساعتهای دراز فکر مرا بخودش مشغول بکند، مثل کار تنک کنج دیوار. چون از وقتی که بستری شده ام بکارهایم کمتر رسیدگی میکنند - میخ طویله ای که بدیوار کوبیده شده جای ننوی من و زنم بوده و شاید بعدها هم وزن بچه های دیگر را متحمل شده است.,"Between the four walls that make up my room and the fence that surrounds my life and my thoughts, my life melts like a crumbling candle, no, I'm wrong - it 's like a log of wood falling into the corner of a pot and roasting and charring other firewood, But it is neither burnt nor fresh, just suffocated by the smoke and tail of others. My room, like all rooms, is made of bricks and rubble on the ruins of thousands of old houses, whitewashed, and has an inscription margin - just like a tomb - the smallest details and details of my room are enough to keep me busy for long hours, like a thin corner Wall. Because my work is less taken care of since I was hospitalized - the long nail that was driven into the wall was the place of my wife and I, and maybe later bore the weight of other children.","Within the four walls that form my room, this fortress which I have erected around my life and thoughts, my life has been slowly wasting away like a candle. No, I am wrong. It is like a green log which has rolled to one side of the fireplace and which has been scorched and charred by the flames from the other logs; it has neither burnt away nor remained fresh and green; it has been choked by the smoke and steam from the others. My room, like all rooms, is built of baked and sun-dried bricks and stands upon the ruins of thousands of ancient houses. Its walls are whitewashed and it has a frieze around it. It is exactly like a tomb. I am capable of occupying my thoughts for hours at a stretch with the slightest details of the life of the room – for example, with a little spider in a crevice of the wall. Ever since I have been confined to my bed people have paid little attention to me. In the wall there is a horseshoe nail which at one time supported the swinging cradle where my wife and I used to sleep and which since then may have supported the weight of other children.","Between the four walls that make up my room, and the fence erected around my thoughts and existence, my life melts bit by bit like a candle, no, I am mistaken—it is like a wet log that lies in the corner of the fireplace, charred and roasted by the fire of the other wood, neither burnt nor untouched, it has merely suffocated from the smoke and steam of others.—My room, like all rooms, has been made with baked and sun-dried bricks on top of the ruins of thousands of ancient houses. It is whitewashed and has a border of inscriptions—it precisely resembles a tomb— The minutest details of my room, such as the cobwebs in the corner of the wall, are enough to busy my thoughts for many long hours—because since I have become bedridden, they have not attended to my affairs as much— The horseshoe nail that has been pounded in the wall was the place for the nanoo1 of my wife and I, and perhaps even later it bore the weight of other children."

آیا میتوانستم به کلی صرف نظر کنم؟ اما دست خودم نبود، از این به بعد مانند روحی که در شکنجه باشد، هر چه انتظار کشیدم - هر چه کشیک کشیدم، هر چه جستجو کردم فایده ای نداشت.- تمام اطراف خانه مان را زیر پا کردم، نه یک روز، نه دو روز؛ بلکه دو ماه و چهار روز مانند اشخاص خونی که به محل جنایت خود برمی‌گردند،هر روز طرف غروب مثل مرغ سرکنده دور خانه مان می‌گشتم، به طوری که همه سنگها و همه ریگهای اطراف آن را می‌شناختم. اما هیچ اثری از درخت سرو، از جوی آب و از کسانی که آنجا دیده بودم پیدا نکردم - آنقدر شبها جلو مهتاب زانو بزمین زدم، از درختها، از سنگها، از ماه که شاید او به ما نگاه کرده باشد، استغاثه و تضرع کرده ام و همهء موجودات را به کمک طلبیده ام ولی کمترین اثری از او ندیدم - اصلا فهمیدم که همه این کارها بیهوده است، زیرا او نمی‌توانست با چیزهای این دنیا رابطه و وابستگی داشته باشد -مثلا آبی که او گیسوانش را با آن شستشو می‌داده بایستی از یک چشمه منحصربفرد ناشناس و یا غاری سحرآمیز بوده باشد. لباس او از تاروپود ابریشم و پنبه معمولی نبوده و دستهای مادی، دستهای آدمی‌آن را ندوخته بود - او یک وجود برگزیده بود- فهمیدم که آن گلهای نیلوفر گل معمولی نبوده، مطمئن شدم اگر آب معمولی برویش می‌زد صورتش می‌پلاسید و اگر با انگشتان بلند و ظریفش گل نیلوفر معمولی را می‌چید انگشتش مثل ورق گل پژمرده می‌شد.,"Could I give up altogether? But it was not my hand; Day; Rather, for two months and four days, like bloodthirsty people returning to their crime scene, I walked around our house every day at dusk like a roaming chicken, recognizing all the rocks and all the gravel around it. But I found no trace of the cypress tree, of the atmosphere of the water, and of those whom I had seen there - I knelt before the moon so many nights, begging from the trees, from the rocks, from the moon that he might have looked at us. And I asked all the creatures for help, but I did not see the slightest trace of him - I did not realize at all that all this was in vain, because he could not relate to the things of this world - for example, the water with which he washed his hair must be from one Unique spring or magical cave. His clothes were not made of ordinary silk and cotton tarpaulins, and material hands had not been sewn by human hands - he was a chosen being - I realized that those lotus flowers were not ordinary flowers, I was sure that if ordinary water hit him, his face would crack and if with his long and delicate fingers He picked an ordinary lotus flower and his finger withered like a flower petal.","Could I abandon the hope of ever seeing her again? It was not within my power to do so. Henceforth I lived like a soul in torment. All my waiting, watching and seeking were in vain. I trod every hand’s-breadth of ground in the neighbourhood of my house. I was like the murderer who returns to the scene of his crime. Not one day, not two days, but every day for two months and four days I circled around our house in the late afternoon like a decapitated fowl. I came to know every stone and every pebble in the neighbourhood but I found no trace of the cypress tree, of the little stream or of the two people whom I had seen there. The same number of nights I knelt upon the ground in the moonlight, I begged and entreated the trees, the stones and the moon – for she might have been gazing at that moment at the moon – I sought aid from every created thing, but I found no trace of her. In the end I understood that all my efforts were useless, because it was not possible that she should be connected in any way with the things of this world: the water with which she washed her hair came from some unique, unknown spring; her dress was not woven of ordinary stuff and had not been fashioned by material, human hands. She was a creature apart. I realized that those flowers of morning glory were no ordinary flowers. I was certain that if her face were to come into contact with ordinary water it would fade; and that if she were to pluck an ordinary flower of morning glory with her long fine fingers they would wither like the petals of a flower.","Could I have abandoned this completely? But it was not in my hands, from henceforth I was like a soul in torture. All my waiting, all my standing guard, all my searching, all was in vain—I searched all the areas around my house, not one day, not two days, rather for two months and four days like a murderer who returns to the scene of the crime, every day around dusk, like a headless chicken I paced around our house, so much so that I came to know all the pebbles and stones in the area, but I found no trace of the cypress tree, of the stream and the people I had seen there—So many nights I knelt before the moonlight, and I begged and pleaded with the trees, with the rocks, with the moon, for she may have looked at the moon, and I called on all the creatures for help but I found no trace of her. I essentially understood that all of this was useless, for she could not be connected or related to earthly things—For example, the water with which she washed her hair must have come from a spring forbidden to the unacquainted, or from an enchanted cave; the warp and woof of her clothes were not made from ordinary cotton and wool, they were not woven by earthly hands, the hands of humans— She was a chosen one—I understood that those morning glories were not ordinary flowers, I was sure that if she washed her face with ordinary water, her face would wither, and if she picked up an ordinary morning glory flower with her long and slender fingers, her fingers would wilt like a flower petal—I understood all of this."

کسانیکه دم مرگ هستند آنها هم می‌دیدند. اضطراب و هول وهراس و میل زندگی درمن فروکش کرده بود از دور ریختن عقاید ی که به من تلقین شده بود آرامش مخصوصی در خود حس می‌کردم - تنها چیزی که از من دلجوئی می‌کرد امید نیستی پس از مرگ بود - فکر زندگی دوباره مرا می‌ترساند و خسته می‌کرد -من هنوز باین دنیائی که در آن زندگی می‌کردم، انس نگرفته بودم، دنیای دیگر بچه درد من میخورد؟ حس می‌کردم که این دنیا برای من نبود، برای یکدسته آدمهای بی حیا، پررو، گدامنش، معلومات فروش چاروادار و چشم ودل گرسنه بود - برای کسانی که به فراخور دنیا آفریده شده بودند واز زورمندان زمین و آسمان مثل سگ گرسنه جلو دکان قصابی که برای یک تکه لثه دم می‌جنباندند گدائی می‌کردند و تملق می‌گفتمد -فکر زندگی دوباره مرا می‌ترساند و خسته می‌کرد -نه، من احتیاجی به بدیدین این همه دنیاهای قی آور و این همه قیافه های نکبت بار نداشتم - مگر خدا آنقدر ندیده بدیده بود که دنیاهای خودش را بچشم؟ - اما من تعریف دروغی نمی‌توانم بکنم و در صورتی که دنیای جدیدی را باید طی کرد، آرزومند بودم که فکر و احساسات کرخت و کند شده می‌داشتم. بدون زحمت نفس می‌کشیدم و بی آنکه احساس خستگی کنم، می‌توانستم در سایه ستونهای یک معبد لینگم برای خودم زندگی را به سر ببرم - پرسه می‌زدم بطوری که آفتاب چشمم را نمی‌زد، حرف مردم وصدای زندگی گوشم را می‌خراشید.,"Those who are on the verge of death also saw it. Anxiety, panic, and desire for life had subsided in me. - I still did not get used to the world in which I lived, the other world of my child hurts? I felt that this world was not for me; They gnawed on a piece of gum, begged and flattered - the thought of life again frightened and bored me - No, I did not need to see so many vomiting worlds and so many miserable faces - but God had not seen his worlds so much. To taste? - But I can not define falsehood, and if a new world had to go through, I wished I had dulled thoughts and feelings. I could breathe effortlessly, and without feeling tired, I could live for myself in the shadows of the pillars of a Ling temple - I wandered so that the sun did not catch my eye, the words of the people and the sound of life scratched my ear.","Sometimes I imagined that the visions I saw were those which appeared to everyone who was at the point of death. All anxiety, awe, fear and will to live had subsided within me and my renunciation of the religious beliefs which had been inculcated into me in my childhood had given me an extraordinary inner tranquillity. What comforted me was the prospect of oblivion after death. The thought of an afterlife frightened and fatigued me. I had never been able to adapt myself to the world in which I was now living. Of what use would another world be to me? I felt that this world had not been made for me but for a tribe of brazen, money-grubbing, blustering louts, sellers of conscience, hungry of eye and heart – for people, in fact, who had been created in its own likeness and who fawned and grovelled before the mighty of earth and heaven as the hungry dog outside the butcher’s shop wagged his tail in the hope of receiving a fragment of offal. The thought of an afterlife frightened and fatigued me. No, I had no desire to see all these loathsome worlds peopled with repulsive faces. Was God such a parvenu that He insisted on my looking over His collection of worlds? I must speak as I think. If I had to go through another life, then I hoped that my mind and senses would be numb. In that event I could exist with effort and weariness. I would live my life in the shadow of the columns of some lingam temple.","The realization of death is in itself frightening, imagine the feeling of one who thinks he is already dead! There are old persons who die with a smile on their lips, as if they are going from one sleep to another, like a tallow-burner that burns out. But a strong youth who suddenly dies and whose entire strength battles against death for a time, what feelings will he experience? Many times I would think about death and the decomposition of the pieces of my body, so much so that this thought did not frighten me. Quite the opposite, I truly wished to die and become nonexistent. The only thing I feared was that the particles of my body would mix with the particles of the bodies of the rabble, this thought was unbearable to me— Sometimes I wished that after dying I would have long hands with long, sensitive fingers so that I could gather all the bits of my body together and hold them in my hands so that the pieces of my body, which belonged to me, would not flow into the bodies of the rabble. At times, I thought that which I was seeing was also seen by those about to die; the anxiety, trepidation, dread and pleasure of living had abandoned me. By casting aside beliefs that had been forced upon me, I felt a particular sense of inner peace— The only thing that comforted me was the hope of nothingness after death—the thought of a second life made me frightened and weary—I still had not grown fond of the world I was living in, of what use to me was another world? I felt that this world was not for me, it was for a bunch of shameless, insolent, beggarly, pedantic muleteers and coldhearted, discontented people—for those who were created suitable for this world and who begged and flattered the brutes of heaven and earth, like a hungry dog wagging its tail for a piece of offal in front of the butcher’s shop— The thought of a second life made me frightened and weary—no, I had no use for all these nauseating worlds and all these repulsive faces —Was God so parvenu that he had to display all his worlds to me?—But I can not write falsehoods, and in the event that one must travel through a new life, I wished that I would breath without difficulty, that I would have deadened and dull thoughts and feelings, and without feeling weary I would be able to live my life under the shade of the columns of a Lingam temple—"

It was these common needs of life that surprised me - the similarity that bothered me the most was that men like me liked this woman as much as I did, and she was more interested in them - I'm sure there was a flaw in her. Has been one of us.","A thought which I found intolerably painful was this: whereas I felt that I was far removed from all people whom I saw and among whom I lived, yet at the same time I was related to them by an external similarity which was both remote and close. My surprise at the fact was diminished by the knowledge that my physical needs were the same as theirs. The point of resemblance which tortured me more than any other was the fact that the rabble-men were attracted as I was to the bitch, my wife, she feeling a stronger appetite for them than for me. I am certain that there was something lacking in the make-up of one of us.","What is unbearable is that despite feeling distant from all these people whom I saw and lived amongst, we were connected by a superficial resemblance, a remote and faint, yet at the same time close, resemblance— It was these shared necessities of life that diminished my astonishment— The resemblance that tortured me more than any other was that the rabble fancied this whore, my wife, just as I did, and that she was more fond of them —I am certain that there was a deficiency in one of our beings."

It was impossible to imagine from what remote cavity of my body it proceeded. It resembled the coughing of the horses that bring the sheep carcasses each morning to the butcher’s shop opposite my window.","I wish I could go back to the time when I was an oblivious child, and gradually fall asleep—a peaceful sleep without disturbance—When I would wake up my cheeks would become red, the color of the meat hanging in front of the butcher’s shop, my body was hot and I was coughing— what deep, frightful coughs!—Coughs such that it was uncertain from which forgotten crevice of my body they were coming out of, like the coughs of the packhorses that bring the carcasses of the sheep to the butcher’s in the early morning."
تمام بدبختیهای زندگی ام دوباره جلو چشمم مجسم شد - آیا فقط چشمهای یکنفر در زندگیم کافی نبود؟ حالا دونفر با همان چشمها، چشمهایی که مال او بود بمن نگاه می‌کردند! نه، قطعا تحمل ناپذیر بود - چشمی‌که خودش آنجا نزدیک کوه کنار تنه درخت سرو، پهلوی رودخانه خشک بخاک سپرده شده بود. زیر گلهای نیلوفر کبود، در میان خون غلیظ، درمیان کرم و جانوران و گزندگانی که دور او جشن گرفته بودند و ریشه گیاهان بزودی در حدقه آن فرو میرفت که شیره اش را بمکد حالا بازندگی قوی سرشار بمن نگاه میکرد!,"All the misery of my life was re-imagined before my eyes - weren't just one person's eyes enough in my life? Now two people were looking at me with the same eyes, the eyes that belonged to him! No, it was definitely unbearable - the eye of which was buried near the mountain by the trunk of a cypress tree, by the dry river. Under the blue lotus flowers, in the thick blood, among the worms and the animals and the bites that had celebrated around him, and the roots of the plants soon sank into its socket to suck its sap, now a strong loss was looking at me!","All that wretchedness of my life rose again before my eyes. Was it not enough that in the course of my life I should encounter one person with such eyes as these? And now two people were gazing at me from the same eyes, her eyes. The thing was beyond endurance. Those eyes to which I had given burial there, by the hill, at the foot of the dead cypress tree, beside the dry river bed, under the blue flowers of morning glory, amid thick blood, amid maggots and foul creatures which were holding festival around her, while the plant roots were already reaching down to force their way into the pupils and suck forth their juices – those same eyes, brimful of vigorous life, were at that moment gazing at me.","Once more, all the misfortunes of my life materialized before my eyes—were not the eyes of one person in my life enough? Now two people with those same eyes, eyes that belonged to her, were looking at me! No, this was absolutely unbearable—eyes that themselves were buried near a mountain, next to the trunk of a cypress, and by a dried-up river, under bruised morning glories, amid thick blood, amid worms, beasts and biting creatures that were feasting on her, and the roots of plants that would soon penetrate her eye sockets to suck up their juices, these eyes now looked at me with strength, brimming with life!"
فقط بزندگی بیشتر اظهار علاقه می‌کرد و از مر گ می‌ترسید، مکس هائی که اول پائیز به اطاق پناه می‌آوردند. اما زندگی من در هر روز و هر دقیقه عوض می‌شد. به نظرم می‌آمد که طول زمان و تغییراتی که ممکن بود آدمها در چندین سال انجام بکنند، برای من این سرعت سیرو جریان هزاران بار مضاعف و تند تر شده بود. در صورتی که خوشی آن بطور معکوس بطرف صفر میرفت و شاید از صفر هم تجاوز میکر – کسانی هستند که از بیست سالگی شروع به جان کندن می‌کنند در صورتی که بسیاری از مردم فقط درهنگام مرگشان خیلی آرام و آهسته مثل پیه سوزی که روغنش تمام بشود خاموش می‌شوند. ظهر که دایه ام ناهار را آورد، من زدم زیر کاسه آش، فریاد کشیدم، با تمام قوایم فریاد کشیدم، همه اهل خانه آمدند جلو اطاقم جمع شدند. آن لکاته هم آمد و زود رد شد. بشکمش نگاه کردم، بالا آمده بود. نه، هنوز نزائیده بود.,"Only life was more interested in and afraid of death, the Max who took refuge in the room at the beginning of autumn. But my life was changing every day and every minute. It seemed to me that the length of time and the changes that people might have made over the years had doubled and accelerated thousands of times faster for me.

At noon, when my midwife brought lunch, I knocked under the bowl of soup, shouted, shouted with all my might, all the people of the house came and gathered in front of my room. That Lakata also came and passed quickly. I looked at his belly, he had come up. No, she was not yet born.","The only difference was that she evinced a greater fondness for life and seemed afraid of death, in which she reminded me of the flies which take refuge indoors at the beginning of the autumn. I on the other hand changed with every day and every minute. It seemed to me that the passage of time had become thousands of times more rapid in my case than in that of other people and that the alterations I daily observed in myself should normally have been the work of years, whereas the satisfaction I should have derived from life tended, on the contrary, towards zero and perhaps even sank below zero. There are people whose death agonies begin at the age of twenty, while others die only at the very end, calmly and peacefully, like a lamp in which all the oil has been consumed. When my nurse brought me my dinner at midday I upset the soup bowl and began to shriek at the top of my voice. Everyone in the house came running to my room and gathered at the door. The bitch came along with the rest but she soon went away again. I had a look at her belly. It was big and swollen. No, she had not had the baby yet.","Although Nane-joon had outwardly changed, her thoughts had remained the same, she only showed more of an attachment to life and a fear of death, like the flies that seek refuge indoors at the beginning of autumn. But my life was changing every day and every minute. It seemed to me that the several years’ time that it might take for a change to take place in a person, multiplied and sped up a thousand times for me, while conversely its pleasure was heading towards zero and perhaps even sinking below zero—There are those who start their death throes at the age of twenty, while many others begin to extinguish only while dying, very calmly and quietly, like a tallow-burner whose oil has run out. At noontime, when my nanny brought my lunch, I slapped the underside of the ash1 bowl and screamed, I screamed with all my might. The entire household gathered in front of my room, that whore also came and quickly passed by. I looked at her belly, it was swollen— No, she had not delivered yet"

When I looked at her face I experienced a kind of vertigo which made me forget the faces of all other people. Gazing at her, I began to tremble all over and my knees felt weak. In the depths of her immense eyes I beheld in one moment all the wretchedness of my life. Her eyes were wet and shining like two huge black diamonds suffused with tears. In her eyes, her black eyes, I found the everlasting night of impenetrable darkness for which I had been seeking and I sank into the awful, enchanted blackness of that abyss. It was as though she was drawing some faculty out of my being. The ground rocked beneath my feet and if I had fallen I should have experienced an ineffable delight.","I regarded her as a woman, though at the same time she carried within her something that was beyond human. Her face produced a dizzying forgetfulness of all other faces, so much that my knees became weak and my limbs were brought to a tremble when I watched her—In that instant I saw the painful story of my own life behind her large, extremely large eyes, shiny and wet eyes, like round black diamonds thrown into teardrops—in her eyes, in her black eyes I found the eternal night and concentrated darkness that I was looking for, and I was engulfed in their dark and terrifying enchantment, as if a force were being pulled out of me, as if the ground underneath my feet was shaking, and if I had fallen, I would have experienced an indescribable euphoria.—"

شب آخری که مثل هر شب بگردش رفتم، هوا گرفته و بارانی بود و مه غلیظی در اطراف پیچیده بود - در هوای بارانی که از زنندگی رنگ ها و بی حیایی خطوط اشیا میکاهد، من یکنوع آزادی و راحتی حس می‌کردم و مثل این بود که باران افکار تاریک مرا می‌شست - در این شب آنچه که نباید بشود شد - من بی اراده پرسه می‌زدم ولی در این ساعت های تنهایی، در این دقیقه ها که درست مدت آن یادم نیست خیلی سخت تر از همیشه صورت هول و محو او مثل این که از پشت ابر و دود ظاهر شده باشد صورت بی حرکت و بی حالتش مثل نقاشی های روی جلد قلمدان جلو چشمم ظاهر بود.,"The last night I walked around like every night, it was windy and rainy with a thick fog all around - in the rainy weather that diminished the vibrancy of colors and the shamelessness of the lines of things, I felt a kind of freedom and comfort, and it was like rain.

A dense mist had fallen over the surrounding country. In the fine rain which softened the intensity of the colours and the clarity of the outlines, I had experienced a sense of liberation and tranquillity. It was as though the rain was washing away my black thoughts. That night what ought not to have happened did happen. I wandered, unconscious of my surroundings. During those hours of solitude, during those minutes which lasted I know not how long, her awe-inspiring face, indistinct as though seen through cloud or mist, void of motion or expression like the paintings one sees upon the covers of pen cases, took shape before my eyes far more clearly than ever before.","The last night on which I took a stroll like every other night, the weather was muggy and wet, and a thick fog had unfurled all around— In the rainy weather that dulls colors and the brazen lines of things, I felt a sort of ease and freedom, as if the rain were washing away my dark thoughts— In this night that which should not have happened did happen—I was aimlessly roaming, but in these lonely hours, in these minutes the duration of which now escapes me, much more intensely than before, her terrified and obscure face, as if emerging from behind smoke and clouds, her motionless and expressionless face, as if a painting on a pen case cover, appeared before my eyes."
کبریت زدم که جای کلید را پیدا کنم ولی نمی‌دانم چرا بی اراده چشمم به طرف هیکل سیاهپوش متوجه شد و دو چشم مورب، دو چشم درشت سیاه که میان صورت مهتابی لاغری بود، همان چشم هایی را که بصورت انسان خیره میشد بی آنکه نگاه بکند شناختم، اگر او را سابق بر این ندیده بودم، می‌شناختم-نه، گول نخورده بودم.این هیکل سیاهپوش او بود - من مثل وقتی که آدم خواب می‌بیند، خودش می‌داند که خواب است و می‌خواهد بیدار بشود اما نمی‌تواند. مات و منگ ایستادم، سر جای خودم خشک شدم- کبریت تا ته سوخت و انگشتهایم را سوزانید، آن وقت یک مرتبه بخودم آمدم، کلید را در قفل پیچاندم، در باز شد، خودم را کنار کشیدم -او مثل کسی که راه رابشناسد از روی سکو بلند شد، از دالان تاریک گذشت.در اطاقم را باز کرد و من هم پشت سر او وارد اطاقم شدم. دستپاچه چراغ را روشن کردم، دیدم او رفته روی تختخواب من دراز کشیده. صورتش در سایه واقع شده بود. نمی‌دانستم که او مرا می‌بیند یا نه، صدایم را می‌توانست بشنود یا نه، ظاهرا نه حالت ترس داشت و نه میل مقاومت. مثل این بود که بدون اراده آمده بود.,"I lit a match to find the key, but I do not know why my eyes involuntarily turned to the black-clad body, and I recognized the two oblique eyes, the two large black eyes between the slim moonlit face, the same eyes that stared at the human face without looking. If I had never seen him before, I would have known - no, I would not have been deceived. I stood dumbfounded, dried in my place - the match burned to the bottom and burned my fingers, then I came to myself once, I locked the key, the door opened, I pulled myself aside - he's like someone who knows the way from the top The platform rose, passed through the dark corridor. He opened the door of my room and I entered my room behind him. Embarrassed, I turned on the light and saw him lying on my bed. His face was in the shadows.

It was as if he had come without a will.","I struck a match to find the keyhole and for some reason glanced involuntarily at the figure in black.

No, it was not an illusion. This black-robed form was she. I stood bemused, like a man dreaming, who knows that he is dreaming and wishes to awake but cannot. I was unable to move. The match burned down and scorched my fingers. I abruptly came to myself and turned the key in the lock. The door opened and I stood aside. She rose from the bench and passed along the dark corridor like one who knew the way. She opened my door and I followed her into the room. I hurriedly lit the lamp and saw that she had gone across and lain down upon my bed. Her face was in shadow. I did not know whether or not she could see me, whether or not she could hear my voice. She seemed neither to be afraid nor to be inclined to resist. It was as though she had come to my room independently of any will of her own.","I struck a match to see the keyhole but I do not know why my eyes involuntarily drifted toward the figure clad in black, and I immediately recognized, without even looking, the two slanted eyes, the two large black eyes set in the thin moonlit face, those same eyes that in a human form dazzled— If I had not seen her prior to this, I would still have recognized her— No, I was not fooled, this figure clad in black was her—I was frozen in place, I stood there stunned and dizzy, like a person who is dreaming and who himself knows he is dreaming and wants to wake up but can not—The match burned till the very end and burned my fingers, then I suddenly came to.

ما میدونستیم که بچه.... خودش میگفت تو حموم آبستن شده، شب رفتم کمرش رو مشت ومال بدم دیدم رو بازوش گل گل کبود بود.دوباره گفت هیچ میدونستی خیلی وقت زنت آبستن بوده؟ من خندیدم و گفتم:لابد شکل بچه شکل پیرمرد قارییه. بعد ننجون به حالت متغیر از در خارج شد.نه هرگز ممکن نبود که بچه برروی من جنبیده باشد. بعد از ظهر در اطاقم باز شد برادر کوچکش، برادر کوچک لکاته در حالی که ناخونش را میجوید وارد شد.وارد اطاق که شد با چشمهای متعجب به من نگاه کرد و گفت: شاه جون میگه حکیم باشی گفته تومیمیری، از شرت خلاص میشم. مگه آدم چطورمیمیره؟من گفتم: بهش بگو من خیلی وقته که مرده ام.شاه جون گفت: اگه بچه ام نیفتاده بود همه این خونه مال ما میشد.,"We knew that the baby .... he himself said that he got pregnant in the bathroom, I went to punch his waist at night and gave him a towel and saw that his arm was bruised. He said again, ""Did you know that your wife has been pregnant for a long time?"" I laughed and said: Probably the shape of a child is the shape of an old man reading. Then Nenjun came out of the door in a changeable state. No, it was never possible for the child to move on me. In the afternoon, he opened the door to my room. His little brother, Lakata's little brother, entered while looking for his fingernails. When he entered the room, he looked at me with surprised eyes and said: How does a person die? I said: Tell him I have been dead for a long time. Shah Joon said: If my child had not fallen, this whole house would have been ours.","According to her, she got pregnant at the baths. * I went to her room to massage her belly during the night and I noticed her arms were all black and blue. She showed them to me and said, ‘I went down to the cellar at an unlucky time, and the Good People gave me an awful pinching.’” She went on, “Did you know your wife’s been pregnant for a long time?” I laughed and said, “I dare say the child’ll look like the old man that reads the Koran. I suppose it gave its first leap when she was looking at the old man’s face.” * Nanny looked at me indignantly and went out of the room. Apparently she had not expected such a reply. I rose hastily, picked up the bone-handled knife with a trembling hand, put it away in the box in the closet and shut the lid. No, it was out of the question that the baby should have leapt when she was looking at my face. It must have been the old odds-and-ends man. Some time during the afternoon the door of my room opened and her little brother came in, biting his nail. You could tell the moment you saw them that they were brother and sister. The resemblance was extraordinary. He had full, moist, sensual lips, languid, heavy eyelids, slanting, wondering eyes, high cheekbones, unruly, date-coloured hair and a complexion the colour of ripe wheat. He was the image of the bitch and he had a touch of her satanic spirit. His was one of those impassive, soulless Turkoman faces which are so appropriate to a people engaged in an unremitting battle with life, a people which regards any action as permissible if it helps to go on living. Nature had shaped this brother and sister over many generations. Their ancestors had lived exposed to sun and rain, battling unceasingly with their environment, and had not only transmitted to them faces and characters modified correspondingly but had bequeathed to them a share of their stubbornness, sensuality, rapacity and hungriness. I remembered the taste of his lips, faintly bitter, like that of the stub end of a cucumber. When he came into the room he looked at me with his wondering Turkoman eyes and said, “Mummy says the doctor said you are going to die and it’ll be a good riddance for us. How do people die?” I said, “Tell her I have been dead for a long time.” “Mummy said, ‘If I hadn’t had a miscarriage the whole house would have belonged to us.’” I involuntarily burst out laughing. It was a hollow, grating laugh, of a quality to make the hairs on one’s body stand on end. I did not recognize the sound of my own voice. The child ran from the room in terror.",". . we know that the child . . . she said she got pregnant in the bath. At night I had gone to rub and massage her back and I saw bruises on her biceps, she showed them to me and said, ‘I went into the basement at the wrong time and az-ma-behtaroon2 pinched me!’” She continued, “Did you even know that your wife was pregnant?” I laughed and said, “Maybe the baby looks like the old Koran reader, perhaps the baby jumped3 upon seeing his face. ”—Then Nane-joon walked out the door with indignation, as if she were not expecting such a response. I immediately got up and, with trembling hands, took the bone-handled jackknife to the closet, placed it inside the box and shut its lid. No, there was no way that the baby jumped upon seeing my face; the baby must have jumped to the old peddler’s face. In the afternoon the door to my room opened. Her brother, the brother of this same whore, entered the room while chewing on his finger. Anyone who saw them would immediately know they were brother and sister, such a similarity! He had a small, tight mouth, full-bodied lips that were wet and sensuous, intoxicating curved eyelids, bewildered slanted eyes, prominent cheeks, unkempt date-colored hair and a wheat-colored complexion—he looked just like that whore and had a piece of her devilish soul. One of these stoic, soulless Turkoman faces that was appropriately created for the fight against the world, a face that justified any action for the continuation of life, as if nature had predicted this beforehand, as if their ancestors had lived underneath the sun and rain for a long time and had fought nature, and not only had they given them, with some changes, their appearance and character, but they had bequeathed their perseverance, their avarice and hunger and lust onto them. The taste of his mouth I knew to be a mild bitter taste like the end of a cucumber. When he entered my room, he looked at me with his bewildered Turkoman eyes and said, “Shah-joon says that Hakim-bashi said that you will die, that we will finally be rid of you; say, how does a person die anyway?” I said, “Tell her I’ve been dead for a long time.” “—Shah-joon said if the baby wasn’t stillborn the entire house would be ours.”1 I involuntarily burst out laughing in such a way that I did not recognize my own voice; it was a dry, grating laugh that made the hairs on one’s body stand on end. The child ran out of the room in a state of fright."
یاد روزهای دور دست خودم افتادم ولی همه این یاد بودها بطرز افسون مانندی از من دور شده بود و آن یادگار باهم زندگی مستقلی داشتند. در صورتیکه من شاهد دور و بیچاره ای بیش نبودم و حس می‌کردم که میان من و آنها گرداب عمیقی کنده شده بود.حس می‌کردم که امروز دلم تهی و بته های عطر جادوئی آنزمان را گم کرده بودند، درختهای سرو بیشتر فاصله پیدا کرده بودند، تپه ها خشکتر شده بودند – موجودی که آنوقت بودم دیگر وجود نداشت و اگر حاضرش می‌کردم و با او حرف می‌زدم نمی‌شنید و مطالب مرا نمی‌فهمید. صورت یک نفر آدمی‌را داشت که سابق برین با او آشنا بوده ام ولی از من و جزومن نبود.,"I remembered my distant days, but all these memories were magically gone from me, and those memories lived independently together. If I had seen nothing but misery and misery, I would have felt that a deep vortex had been plunged between me and them. They had become drier - the creature I was then no longer existed, and if I had been present and talked to him, you would not have heard and understood what I was saying. He had the face of a man whom I had known before, but he was not of me and of me.","Long past days of my life came back to me, but all these memories, in some strange fashion, were curiously remote from me and led an independent life of their own, in such a way that I was no more than a passive and distant witness and felt that my heart was empty now and that the perfume of the plants had lost the magic which it had had in those days. The cypress trees were more thinly spaced, the hills had grown more arid. The person that I had been then existed no longer. If I had been able to conjure him up and to speak to him he would not have listened to me and, if he had, would not have understood what I said. He was like someone whom I had known once, but he was no part of me.","In the desert I recognized the thorns, rocks, tree trunks and small shrubs of thyme—I recognized the familiar fragrance of the fields—I remembered my own long-forgotten days, but all these remembrances had magically become distanced from me and those memories now had a separate life of their own, while I was but an unfortunate and distant witness and I felt that a deep whirlpool had been formed between myself and them , I felt that my present-day heart was empty and that the shrubs had lost their enchanting scent of yesteryear, the cypress trees had become more spaced apart , the hills had become drier—the being that I was at that time no longer existed and if I could bring him back and talk to him, he could not hear or understand me, he had the face of a person that I once knew but who was not me or a part of me."
در اینجور مواقع هر کس بیک عادت قوی زندگی خود، به یک وسواس خود پناهنده می‌شود: عرق خور میرود مست می‌کند، نویسنده می‌نویسد، حجار سنگ تراشی می‌کند و هرکدام دق دل و عقدهء خودشان را به وسیله فرار در محرک قوی زندگی خود خالی میکنند و در این مواقع است که یکنفر هنرمند حقیقی می‌تواند از خودش شاهکاری به وجود بیاورد- ولی من، من که بی ذوق و بیچاره بودم، یک نقاش روی جلد قلمدان چه می‌توانستم بکنم؟ با این تصاویر خشک و براق و بی روح که همه اش بیک شکل بود چه می‌توانستم بکشم که شاهکار بشود؟ اما در تمام هستی خودم ذوق سرشار و حرارت مفرطی حس می‌کردم، یکجور ویر و شور مخصوصی بود، می‌خواستم این چشمهایی که برای همیشه بسته شده بود روی کاغذ بکشم و برای خودم نگهدارم.,"In such cases, everyone, without a strong habit of life, takes refuge in an obsession of his own: he sweats, gets drunk, the writer writes, carves a stone, and each empties his own heart and complex by escaping the strong stimulus of his life, and It is at these times that a true artist can create a masterpiece of his own - but what could I, a tasteless and poor painter, do on the cover of a pen? What could I do to become a masterpiece with these dry, shiny, soulless images, all of which were unique? But in my whole being I felt full of taste and excessive heat, it was a kind of fervor, I wanted to draw these eyes, which were closed forever, on paper and keep them to myself.","At such times as this every man takes refuge in some firmly established habit, in his own particular passion. The drunkard stupefies himself with drink, the writer writes, the sculptor attacks the stone. Each relieves his mind of the burden by recourse to his own stimulant and it is at such times as this that the real artist is capable of producing a masterpiece. But I, listless and helpless as I was, I, the decorator of pen-case covers, what could I do? What means had I of creating a masterpiece when all that I could make were my lifeless, shiny little pictures, each of them identical with all the rest? And yet in my whole being I felt an overflowing enthusiasm, and indescribable warmth of inspiration. I desired to record on paper those eyes which had closed forever; I would keep the picture by me always.","At such times, each person seeks refuge in the one strong habit they call their own, in their one compulsion: the drinker goes out and gets drunk, the writer writes, the stonecutter cuts stone, and in the impetus of their compulsion, each, as a means of escape, empties their frustrations and sorrows, and it is at such a time that a true artist can create a masterpiece from within—but I, I who was talentless and pitiful, a painter of pen case covers, what could I do? With these images that were empty, glossy and soulless, that all looked the same, what could I paint that would become a masterpiece? But I was feeling an overflowing enthusiasm and brimming talent in my entire being, it was a special kind of exhilaration. I wanted to paint on paper and keep for myself these eyes that had become forever closed."

People who have not known suffering themselves will not understand me when I say that my attachment to life had grown so strong that the least moment of ease compensated for long hours of palpitation and anguish.","— No, the fear of death would not loosen its grip on my collar— Those who have never experienced pain will not understand these words—so much had the sense of life grown in me that the slightest moment of pleasure made up for all the long hours of anxiety and suffocation."
ولی پیرمرد بساطی از سر سفره خودش جم نخورد. همه مردم چه صورت جدی بخودشان گرفته بودند! شاید یاد فلسفه مرگ و آن دنیا افتاده بودند - دایه ام که برایم جوشانده آورد دیدم اخمش درهم بود، دانه های تسبیح بزرگی که دستش بود می‌انداخت و با خودش ذکر می‌کرد- بعد نمازش را آمد پشت در اطاق من بکمرش زد و بلند بلند تلاوت می‌کرد (اللهم،اللهم...) مثل اینکه من مامور آمرزش زنده ها بودم! ولی تمام این مسخره بازیها در من هیچ تاثیری نداشت. برعکس کیف می‌کردم که رجاله ها هم اگر چه موقتی و دروغی اما اقلا چند ثانیه عوالم مرا طی می‌کردند - آیا اطاق من یک تابوت نبود، رختخوابم سردتر و تاریکتر از گور نبود؟,"But the simple old man did not jam from his own table. How seriously all the people took themselves! Maybe they remembered the philosophy of death and that world - my midwife who brought me a decoction, I saw that she was frowning, she threw the large rosary beads in her hand and mentioned them to herself - then she came and prayed behind my door and recited aloud (Allah, Allah ...) As if I was the agent of forgiving the living! But all these ridiculous games had no effect on me. On the contrary, I felt that the scoundrels, though temporary and false, passed through my world for at least a few seconds - was not my room a coffin, was my bed colder and darker than the grave?","But the old pedlar man did not stir from his place beside his wares. How serious everybody suddenly looked! Doubtless their thoughts had turned abruptly to the subject of death and the afterlife. When my nurse brought me my medicine I observed that she looked thoughtful. She was fingering the beads of a large rosary and was muttering some formula to herself. Then she took up her position outside my door, beat her breast and recited her prayers in a loud voice: “My God! My Go-o-o-d!” Anyone might have thought it was my business to pardon the living! All this buffoonery left me completely cold. It actually gave me a certain satisfaction to think that, for a few seconds at any rate, the rabble-men were undergoing, temporarily and superficially it is true, something of what I was suffering. Was not my room a coffin? This bed that was always unrolled, inviting me to sleep, was it not colder and darker than the grave? The thought that I was lying in a coffin had occurred to me several times. At night my room seemed to contract and to press against my body. May it not be that people have this same sensation in the grave? Is anything definite known about the sensations we may experience after death? True, the blood ceases to circulate and after the lapse of twenty-four hours certain parts of the body begin to decompose. Nevertheless the hair and the nails continue to grow for some time after death. Do sensation and thought cease as soon as the heart has stopped beating or do they continue a vague existence, alimented by the blood still remaining in the minor blood vessels? The fact of dying is a fearful thing in itself but the consciousness that one is dead would be far worse. Some old men die with a smile on their lips like people passing from sleep into a deeper sleep or like a lamp burning out. What must be the sensations of a young, strong man who dies suddenly and who continues for some time longer to struggle against death with all the strength of his being? I had many times reflected on the fact of death and on the decomposition of the component parts of my body, so that this idea had ceased to frighten me. On the contrary, I genuinely longed to pass into oblivion and non-being. The only thing I feared was that the atoms of my body should later go to make up the bodies of rabble-men. This thought was unbearable to me. There were times when I wished I could be endowed after death with large hands with long, sensitive fingers: I would carefully collect together all the atoms of my body and hold them tightly in my hands to prevent them, my property, from passing into the bodies of rabble-men.","But the old peddler did not budge from his sofre—What serious looks were on the faces of all the people, maybe they remembered the concept of death and the other world— When my nanny brought me jooshandeh, I saw that she was crestfallen, she was passing the prayer beads through her fingers and reciting to herself— Then she came and prayed behind the door of my room, loudly reciting, “Allahom, il-Allahom,”1 as if I were the functionary in charge of absolving the living—but all of this buffoonery had no effect on me, quite the opposite, I took pleasure in the fact that even if temporary and false, yet for at least a few seconds the rabble traversed through my world—Was not my room a coffin? Was not my bedding colder and darker than a grave? The bedding that was always laid out and inviting me to sleep—several times this thought came to me that I was in a coffin— at night it seemed my room would shrink and press on me. Do they not feel the same thing in the grave? Does anyone know what is felt after death? Although the blood turns still in the body and some parts begin to decompose after the passage of a night and a day, the hair on the head and the nails grow until some time after death—"
مثل این بود که این لکاته از شکنجه من کیف و لذت میبرد، مثل اینکه دردی که مرا میخورد کافی نبود - بالاخره من از کار و جنبش افتادم و خانه نشین شدم - مثل مرده متحرک. هیچکس از رمز میان ما خبر نداشت، دایه پیرم که مونس مرگ تدریجی من شده بود بمن سرنش میکرد - برای خاطر همین لکاته پشت سرم، اطراف خودم می‌شنیدم که در گوشی به هم می‌گفتند:,"It was as if Lakata was enjoying my torture, as if the pain I was suffering from was not enough - I finally quit my job and settled down - like a walking dead. No one knew the secret between us.","While I wasted away in agony, the bitch for her part seemed to derive an exquisite pleasure from torturing me. In the end I abandoned all the activities and interests that I had and remained confined to my room like a living corpse. No one knew the secret which existed between us. Even my old nurse, who was a witness of my slow death, used to reproach me – on account of the bitch! Behind my back, around me, I heard people whispering.","It seemed as if this whore took pleasure and delight in my being tortured, as if the pain that was gnawing away at me was not enough— In the end I fell out of work and the hustle and bustle, and became housebound—Like the moving dead, no one knew of the secret between us."
اطاقم یک پستوی تاریک و دو دریچه با خارج، با دنیای رجاله ها دارد. یکی از آنها رو بحیاط خودمان باز میشود و دیگری رو بکوچه است - از آنجا مرا مربوط به شهر ری میکند - شهری که عروس دنیا مینامند و هزاران کوچه پس کوچه و خانه های توسری خورده، و مدرسه و کاروانسرا دارد - شهری که بزرگترین شهر دنیا بشمار می آید، پشت اطاق من نفس میکشد و زندگی میکند. ای«جا گوشه اطاقم وقتی که چشمهایم را بهم میگذارم سایه های محو و مخلوط شهر: آنچه که در من تاثیر کرده با کوشکها، مسجدها و باغهایش همه جلو چشمم مجسم میشود. این دو دریچه مرا با دنیای خارج، با دنیای رجاله ها مربوط میکند.,"My room has a dark closet and two vents on the outside, with a world of scum. One of them opens onto our courtyard and the other is on the alley - from there it connects me to the city of Rey - the city that is called the bride of the world and has thousands of back alleys and dilapidated houses, and a school and inn - the largest city in the world It counts, it breathes and lives behind my room.

The city which is accounted the greatest city in the world is breathing and living its life there beyond my room. When I close my eyes here in my little room the vague, blurred shadows of the city (of which my mind is at all times aware, whether consciously or not) all take substantial form and rise before me in the shape of pavilions, mosques and gardens.

سکوت کامل فرمانروایی داشت، بنظرم آمد که همه مرا ترک کرده بودند، به موجودات بی جان پناه بردم. رابطه ای بین من و جریان طبیعت، بین من و تاریکی عمیقی که در روح من پایین آمده بود تولید شده بود - این سکوت یکجور زبانی است که ما نمی‌فهمیم، از شدت کیف سرم گیج رفت؛ حالت قی بمن دست داد و پاهایم سست شد. خستگی بی پایانی در خودم حس کردم؛ رفتم در قبرستان کنار جاده روی سنگ قبری نشستم، سرم را میان دو دستم گرفتم و بحال خودم حیران بودم - ناگهان صدای خنده خشک زننده ای مرا بخودم آورد، رویم را برگردانیدم و دیدم هیکلی که سرورویش را با شال گردن پیچیده بود پهلویم نشسته بود و چیزی در دستمال بسته زیر بغلش بود، رویش را بمن کرد و گفت:,"There was complete silence, I felt that everyone had left me, I took refuge in inanimate beings. There was a connection between me and the flow of nature, between me and the deep darkness that descended on my soul - this silence is a kind of language that we do not understand, confused by the intensity of my bag; I vomited and my legs became weak. I felt endless tiredness in myself; I went to the graveyard, sat on the gravestone, held my head between my hands, and was astonished - suddenly the sound of a dry laugh came over me, I turned around and saw a body wrapped around my head with a scarf sitting next to me. There was something in a handkerchief under his armpit, he turned to me and said:","There was complete silence everywhere. I felt that all mankind had rejected me and I took refuge with inanimate things. I was conscious of a relationship between me and the pulsation of nature, between me and the profound night which had descended upon my spirit. This silence is a language which we do not understand. My head began to swim, in a kind of intoxication. A sensation of nausea came over me and my legs felt weak. I experienced a sense of infinite weariness. I went into a cemetery beside the road and sat down upon a gravestone. I held my head between my hands and tried to think steadily of the situation I was in. Suddenly I was brought to myself by the sound of a hollow, grating laugh. I turned and saw a figure with its face concealed by a scarf muffled around its neck. It was seated beside me and held under its arm something wrapped in a handkerchief. It turned to me and said:","Absolute silence commanded everything, it seemed as if everyone had abandoned me. I took refuge in lifeless creatures.

I felt an unending weariness in myself, I walked to the cemetery by the side of the road and sat on one of the tombstones, I held my head between my two hands and was bewildered by my present state—Suddenly the sound of a dry, grating laugh brought me to myself. I turned, and seated next to me was a figure whose face was covered with a scarf, and who had something wrapped with a handkerchief under his arm; he turned to me and said, “You must’ve wanted to go to town, lost the way, yes?"
از تمام منظره شهر دکان قصابی حقیری جلو دریچه اطاق من است که روزی دو گوسفند بمصرف میرساند - هردفعه که از دریچه به بیرون نگاه میکنم مرد قصاب را می‌بینم، هر روز دو یابوی سیای لاغر - یابوهای تب لازمی‌که سرفه های عمیق خشک میکنند و دستهای خشکیده آنها منتهی بسم شده، مثل اینکه مطابق یک قانون وحشی دستهای آنها را بریده و در روغن داغ فرو کرده اند و دو طرفشان لش گوسفند آویزان شده؛ جلو دکان می آوردن. مرد قصاب دست چرب خود را بریش حنا بسته اش میکشد، اول لاشه گوسفندها را با نگاه خریداری ورانداز میکند، بعد دو تا از آنها را انختاب میکند، دنبه آنها را با دستش وزن میکند، بعد میبرد و به چنگک دکانش میآویزد - یابوها نفس زنان براه می‌افتند. آن وقت قصاب این جسدهای خون آلود را با گردن ها بریده، چشمهای رک زده و پلکهای خون آلود که زا میان کاسه سر کبودشان در آمده است نوازش میکند، دست مالی میکند، بعد یک گز لیک دسته استخوانی برمیدارد تن آنها را بدقت تکه تکته میکند و گوشت لخم را با تبسم بمشتریانش می‌فروشد. تمام اینکارها را با چه لذتی انجام میدهد! من مطمئنم یکجور کیف و لذت هم میبرد - آن سگ زرد گردن کلفت هم که محله مان را قرق کرده و همیشه با گردن کج و چشمهای بیگناه نگاه حسرت آمیز بدست قصاب میکند، آن سگ هم همه اینها را میأاند - آن سگ هم میداند که قصاب از شغل خودش لذت میبرد!,"From all over the city, there is a small butcher shop in front of the door of my room, which consumes two sheep a day - every time I look out the window I see the butcher, every day two skinny Ciabans - the necessary feverfew - who have a deep cough and dry hands. They are led to the tail, as if, according to a savage law, their hands were cut off and dipped in hot oil, and on either side of them was hung the lamb; Bringing the front of the shop. The butcher man rubs his greasy hand on his henna wrap, first throws the carcasses of the sheep with the buyer's gaze, then folds two of them, weighs their tails with his hand, then takes them and hangs them on the hook of his shop. They were moving. The butcher then cuts off these bloody corpses with their necks, caresses their open eyes and bloody eyelids, which are embedded in the bowl of their bruised head, hands them, then removes a bunch of bony bones and carefully cuts their bodies into pieces. And he sells lean meat to his customers with a smile. What a pleasure to do all this! I'm sure he also enjoys some kind of bag - that big yellow-necked dog that surrounds our neighborhood and always looks at the butcher with a crooked neck and innocent eyes, that dog brings all this - that dog also knows that the butcher Enjoys his job!","The central feature of the city landscape as seen from my window is a wretched little butcher’s shop directly opposite our house. It gets through a total of two sheep per day. I can see the butcher every time I look out of the window. Early each morning a pair of gaunt, consumptive-looking horses are led up to the shop. They have a deep, hollow cough and their emaciated legs terminated by blunt hoofs give one the feeling that their fingers have been cut off in accordance with some barbarous law and the stumps plunged into boiling oil. Each of them has a pair of sheep carcasses slung across its back. The butcher raises his greasy hand to his henna-dyed beard and begins by appraising the carcasses with a buyer’s eye. He selects two of them and feels the weight of their tails with his hand. Finally he lugs them across and hangs them from a hook at the entrance to the shop. The horses set off, breathing hard. The butcher stands by the two bloodstained corpses with their gashed throats and their staring bloody-lidded eyes bulging from the bluish skulls. He pats them and feels the flesh with his fingers. Then he takes a long bone-handled knife and cuts up their bodies with great care, after which he smilingly dispenses the meat to his customers. How much pleasure he derives from all these operations! I am convinced that they give him the most exquisite pleasure, even delight. Every morning at this time the thick-necked yellow dog which has made our district his preserve is there outside the butcher’s shop. His head on one side, he gazes regretfully with his innocent eyes at the butcher’s hand. That dog also understands. He also knows that the butcher enjoys his work.","Of all the views of the city, a lowly butcher’s shop that finishes off two sheep a day is right in front of my window—Every time I look out the window I see the butcher—Each morning, they bring two thin, black packhorses with the carcasses of sheep hanging on both sides to the front of the store— consumptive packhorses that give deep, dry coughs and have withered legs that end in hooves, as if according to some barbaric law, their hands were cut off and dipped in boiling oil. The butcher strokes his henna-dyed beard with his greasy hands. First he inspects the carcasses of the sheep with a buyer’s eye, then picks two from the pile, weighs their fatty tails in his hands, and takes them inside and hangs them on the hook—With labored breaths the packhorses start to move. Then, these bloody carcasses with slit throats, gaping eyes and bloody eyelids that protrude from their bruised sockets, the butcher takes and rubs them, caresses them, then he picks up a bone-handled jackknife and carefully cuts up their bodies and, with a smile, sells the boneless meat to his customers. All of these things he carries out with such pleasure! I am certain he also experiences some sort of intoxication and euphoria—that yellow bully of a dog that has staked out our neighborhood and who always looks enviously at the butcher’s hands with a crooked neck and innocent eyes, that dog, too, knows all of these things—that dog, too, knows that the butcher takes pleasure in his work!"
کوههای بریده بریده، درخت های عجیب و غریب توسری خورده، نفرین زده از دو جانب جاده پیدا که از لابلای آن خانه های خاکستری رنگ باشکال سه گوشه، مکعب و منشور و با پنجره های کوتاه و تاریک بدون شییه دیده می‌شد - این پنجره ها بچشمهای گیج کسی که تب هذیانی داشته باشد شبیه بود. نمی‌دانم دیوارها با خودشان چه داشتند که سرما و برودت را تا قلب انسان انتقال می‌دادند. مثل این بود که هرگز یک موجود زنده نمی‌وانست در این خانه ها مسکن داشته باشد، شاید برای سایهء موجودات اثیری این خانه ها درست شده بود.,"Cut-off mountains, weird, crooked, cursed trees can be found on both sides of the road, overlooking the gray triangular houses, cubes and prisms, with short, dark, windowless windows - these windows are eye-catching. The confusion of someone with delusional fever was similar. I do not know what the walls had with them that carried the cold to the human heart. It was as if a living thing could never live in these houses, perhaps built in the shadow of the ethereal beings of these houses.","On each side of the road was a line of hills standing quite clear of one another. At the foot of the hills there were numbers of weird, crouching, accursed trees, between which one caught sight of ash-grey houses shaped like pyramids, cubes and prisms, with low, dark windows without panes. The windows were like the wild eyes of a man in a state of delirium. The walls of the houses appeared to possess the property of instilling intense cold into the heart of the passer-by. One felt that no living creature could ever have dwelt in those houses. Perhaps they had been built to house the ghosts of ethereal beings.","A new and singular scenery that I had neither seen in wakefulness nor sleep surrounded me: jagged mountains, strange sickly looking trees, accursed trees, lined both sides of the road, and through them those grey houses could be seen, houses shaped like triangles, cubes and prisms, with squat, dark and glassless windows—these windows resembled the dazed eyes of one with fevered hallucinations. I do not know what the walls were made of that enabled them to transfer the chill and cold to the heart of man. It was as if no living creature could ever dwell in these houses, maybe it had been made for the shadows of ethereal creatures."
آیا روزی به اسرار این اتفاقات ماوراء طبیعی، این انعکاس سایهء روح که در حالت اغماء و برزخ بین خواب و بیداری جلوه می‌کند کسی پی خواهد برد؟ من فقط بشرح یکی از این پیش آمدها می‌پردازم که برای خودم اتفاق افتاده و بقدری مرا تکان داده که هرگز فراموش نخواهم کرد و نشان شوم آن تا زنده ام، از روز ازل تا ابد تا آنجن که خارج از فهم و ادراک بشر است زندگی مرا زهرآلود خواهد کرد- زهرآلود نوشتم، ولی می‌خواستم بگویم داغ آنرا همیشه با خودم داشته و خواهم داشت. من سعی خواهم کرد آنچه را که یادم هست، آنچه را که از ارتباط وقایع در نظرم مانده بنویسم، شاید بتوانم راجع بآن یک قضاوت کلی بکنم؛ نه، فقط اطمینان حاصل بکنم و یا اصلا خودم بتوانم باور بکنم - چون برای من هیچ اهمیتی ندارد که دیگران باور بکنند یا نکنند-فقط میترسم که فردا بمیرم و هنوز خودم را نشناخته باشم- زیرا در طی تجربیات زندگی به این مطلب برخوردم که چه ورطهء هولناکی میان من و دیگران وجود دارد و فهمیدم که تا ممکن است باید خاموش شد، تا ممکن است باید افکار خودم را برای خودم نگه دارم و اگر حالا تصمیم گرفتم که بنویسم، فقط برای اینست که خودم را به سایه ام معرفی کنم - سایه ای که روی دیوار خمیده و مثل این است که هرچه می‌نویسم با اشتهای هر چه تمامتر می‌بلعد –برای اوست که می‌خواهم آزمایشی بکنم: ببینم شاید بتوانیم یکدیگر را بهتر بشناسیم. چون از زمانی که همه روابط خودم را با دیگران بریده ام می‌خواهم خودم را بهتر بشناسم. افکار پوچ!-باشد، ولی از هر حقیقتی بیشتر مرا شکنجه می‌کند - آیا این مردمی‌که شبیه من هستند، که ظاهرا احتیاجات و هوا و هوس مرا دارند برای گول زدن من نیستند؟ آیا یک مشت سایه نیستند که فقط برای مسخره کردن و گول زدنمن بوجود آمده اند؟ آیا آنچه که حس می‌کنم، می‌بینم و می‌سنجم سرتاسر موهوم نیست که با حقیقت خیلی فرق دارد؟ من فقط برای سایهء خودم می‌نویسم که جلو چراغ به دیوار افتاده است، باید خودم را بهش معرفی بکنم.,"Will anyone ever discover the secrets of these supernatural events, this reflection of the shadow of the soul that appears in a state of coma and purgatory between sleep and wakefulness? I am just describing one of these events that happened to me and shocked me so much that I will never forget and show that I am alive, from the beginning of time to eternity to the point that is beyond human comprehension. My life is poisonous. Will do - I wrote poisonous, but I wanted to say hot I always have it with me and I will have it. I will try to write what I remember, what I have in mind about the connection of events, maybe I can make a general judgment about it; No, I're just sure or I can believe it myself - because it does not matter to me whether others believe it or not - I'm just afraid to die tomorrow and still do not know myself - because during my life experiences I have come to know what There is a terrible abyss between me and others, and I realized that as much as possible I should be silent, as much as possible I should keep my thoughts to myself, and if I decide to write now, it is only to introduce myself to my shadow - the shadow The one who is crouched on the wall and it is as if everything I write swallows me with the utmost appetite - it is for him that I want to experiment: to see if we can get to know each other better. Because I want to know myself better since I cut all ties with others. Absurd thoughts! - Yes, but it tortures me more than any truth - Aren't these people who are like me, who seem to have my needs, moods and desires, to deceive me? Aren't they a handful of shadows created just to make fun of me? Is not what I feel, see and measure all imaginary, which is very different from reality? I only write for my own shadow that has fallen on the wall in front of the lamp, I have to introduce myself to him.","Will anyone ever penetrate the secret of this disease which transcends ordinary experience, this reverberation of the shadow of the mind, which manifests itself in a state of coma like that between death and resurrection, when one is neither asleep nor awake? I propose to deal with only one case of this disease. It con­cerned me personally and it so shattered my entire being that I shall never be able to drive the thought of it out of my mind. The evil impression which it left has, to a degree that surpasses human understanding, poisoned my life for all time to come. I said “poisoned”: I should have said that I have ever since borne, and will bear for ever, the brand mark of that cautery. I shall try to set down what I can remember, what has remained in my mind of the sequence of events. I may perhaps be able to draw a general conclusion from it all – but no, that is too much to expect. I may hope to be believed by others or at least to convince myself; for, after all, it does not matter to me whether others believe me or not. My one fear is that tomorrow I may die without having come to know myself. In the course of my life I have discovered that a fearful abyss lies between me and other people and have realized that my best course is to remain silent and keep my thoughts to myself for as long as I can. If I have now made up my mind to write it is only in order to reveal myself to my shadow, that shadow which at this moment is stretched across the wall in the attitude of one devouring with insatiable appetite each word I write. It is for his sake that I wish to make the attempt. Who knows? We may perhaps come to know each other better. Ever since I broke the last ties which held me to the rest of mankind, my one desire has been to attain a better knowledge of myself. Idle thoughts! Perhaps. Yet they torment me more savagely than any reality could do. Do not the rest of mankind who look like me, who appear to have the same needs and the same passion as I, exist only in order to cheat me? Are they not a mere handful of shadows which have come into existence only that they may mock and cheat me? Is not everything that I feel, see and think something entirely imaginary, something utterly different from reality? I am writing only for my shadow, which is now stretched across the wall in the light of the lamp. I must make myself known to him. 2","Will there be a day when someone discovers the secrets of these supernatural events, that reflection of the shadow of the soul that manifests itself between awakening and sleep, in a state of purgatory and unconsciousness?

I will attempt to write all that I remember, all that remains in my mind from the interconnections between the events, maybe I can come to a general judgment about it— No, perhaps it is for reassurance, or essentially so that I can believe it myself—because for me it absolutely does not matter if others believe it or not , my only fear is that I will die tomorrow and still not know myself—for in the course of my life experiences I came to this understanding that there existed a dreadful chasm between myself and others, and I understood that as much as possible one should remain inaudible, as much as possible I should keep my thoughts to myself, and if now I have decided to write, it is only to introduce myself to my shadow—a bent shadow on the wall, and it is as if the more I write, it devours it with an even greater appetite— It is for him that I wish to carry out an experiment: to see if we can come to know each other better—because from the time that I cut myself off from others, I have wanted to know myself better. Empty thoughts!—That may be, but they torture me more than any reality —Are these people who look similar to me, that on the surface have the same needs and wants as myself, are they not here for me to be deceived? Are they not just a handful of shadows that were created for the purpose of deceiving and mocking me? Is not all that I feel, see and ponder completely illusory, far from reality?

زنده شده، عشق من در کالبد او روح دمیده - اما از نزدیک بوی مرده، بوی مردهء تجزیه شده را حس می‌کردم - روی تنش کرم های کوچک در هم میلولیدند و دو مگس زنبور طلایی دور ا و جلو روشنایی شمع پرواز می- کردند- او کاملا مرده بود ولی چرا، چطور چشمهایش باز شد؟ نمیدانم. آیا در حالت رویا دیده بودم، آیا حقیقت داشت.,"Resurrected, my love breathed into his body - but I could smell the dead, the smell of decomposed dead up close - on the tension small worms fluttered and two golden bee flies flew away and in front of the candlelight - he He was completely dead, but why, how did his eyes open? I do not know. Did I dream, was it true?","The image of those eyes seemed suddenly to have been effaced from my memory. All my efforts were useless. However much I might study her face, I was unable to bring their expression to mind. All at once as I looked at her a flush began to appear upon her cheeks. They gradually were suffused with a crimson colour like that of the meat that hangs in front of butchers’ shops. She returned to life. Her feverish, reproachful eyes, shining with a hectic brilliance, slowly opened and gazed fixedly at my face. It was the first time she had been conscious of my presence, the first time she had looked at me. Then the eyes closed again. The thing probably lasted no more than a moment but this was enough for me to remember the expression of her eyes and to set it down on paper. With the tip of my paintbrush I recorded that expression and this time I did not tear up my picture. Then I stood up and went softly to the bedside. I supposed that she was alive, that she had come back to life, that my love had infused life into her dead body. But at close quarters I detected the corpse smell, the smell of a corpse in the process of decomposition. Tiny maggots were wriggling on her body and a pair of blister flies were circling in the light of the candles. She was quite dead. But why, how, had her eyes opened? Had it been a hallucination or had it really happened?","I was busy with an image that I thought had turned out better than the rest, but the eyes, those rebuking eyes that seemed to have uncovered unforgivable sins in my person, I could not bring out those eyes on paper— All of a sudden the remembrance and entire existence of those eyes were erased from my memory— My efforts were useless, no matter how many times I looked at her face, I could not remember their expression—Suddenly I saw that her cheeks slowly began to glow with life, with a red jegarki1 color, like the meat in the front of a butcher’s shop, and her wide open and wondrous eyes, eyes which had gathered all the radiance of life and which shone with an ailing light, her sick-looking, rebuking eyes very slowly opened and looked at my face— It was the first time that she had become aware of me, she looked at me and then her eyes closed once more—Perhaps this event lasted no longer than a moment but it was enough for me to capture the expression of her eyes and bring it out on paper— with the tip of the paintbrush I painted this expression and this time I did not tear up the painting. Then I stood up, slowly moved close to her, thinking that she was still alive, that she had come alive, that my love had breathed life into her corpse. But up close I sensed the smell of the dead, the smell of the decomposing dead—on her body small worms were squirming on top of one another and two greenbottle flies were circling over her, in the candlelight— She was thoroughly dead but why, how did her eyes open? I do not know. Did I see it in an imaginary state, was there any truth in it?"
صورت او همان حالت آرام و بی حرکت را داشت ولی مثل این بود که تکیده تر و لاغرتر شده بود. همین طور دراز کشیده بود ناخن انگشت سبابه دست چپش را می‌جوید- رنگ صورتش مهتابی و از پشت رخت سیاه نازکی که چسب تنش بود خط ساق پا، بازو و دو طرف سینه و تمام تنش پیدا بود. برای این که او را بهتر ببینم من خم شدم، چون چشمهایش بسته شده بود. اما هرچه بصورتش نگاه کردم مثل این بود که او از من بکلی دور است- ناگهان حس کردم که من بهیچوجه از مکنونات قلب او خبر نداشتم و هیچ رابطه ای بین ما وجود ندارد.,"His face was the same calm and motionless, but it was as if he had become more stressed and thin. He was also lying down, chewing on the fingernails of his left index finger - the color of his face was moonlit, and from behind a thin black cloth glued with tension, the line of his legs, arms, and both sides of his chest was full of tension. I bent down to see him better, because his eyes were closed. But every time I looked at him, it was as if he was far away from me - I suddenly felt that I had no knowledge of his secrets and that there was no connection between us.","Her face preserved the same stillness, the same tranquil expression, but seemed to have grown thinner and frailer. As she lay there on my bed she was biting the nail of the index finger of her left hand. Her complexion was pale as the moon and her thin, clinging black dress revealed the lines of her legs, her arms, her breasts – of her whole body. I leant over her in order to see her more plainly. Her eyes were closed. However much I might gaze at her face, she still seemed infinitely remote from me. All at once I felt that I had no knowledge of the secrets of her heart and that no bond existed between us.","Her face carried the same calm and motionless expression, but it seemed as if she had become thinner and frailer. She was chewing the index finger of her left hand as she lay there— The color of her face was like the moonlight and, behind the delicate black dress that clung to her body, I could see the outline of her calf, arms and two breasts, and her entire body. Because she had closed her eyes, I bent over to see her better, but the more I looked at her face, the farther away from me she seemed. Suddenly I felt that I was not in the least privy to the secrets of her heart and that there was no connection between us—I wanted to say something"
***,***,She is holding a flower of morning glory in her hand.,"A damsel in a long black dress, perhaps a Bogam Dasi, is dancing with unworldly movements in front of him; she is holding a morning glory flower in her hands and between them there is the distance of a stream."
بعد صدای دور دست فروشنده ای آمد که میخواند: (صفر ابره شاتوت؟),Then came the distant voice of a salesman who sang: (Zero cloud shot?),"Then came the far-off cry of a street vendor, “Mulberries for your bile!”","Then came the faraway sounds of a merchant who was shouting, “Mulberries, it cuts through bile!”"
مثل اینکه هیچ مانع و عایقی در جلو فکر و تصورم وجود نداشت، زمان و مکان تاثیر خود را از دست می‌دادند - این حس شهوت کشته شده که خواب زاییده آن بود، زاییده احتیاجات نهایی من بود.اشکال و اتفاقات باور نکردنی ولی طبیعی جلو من مجسم می‌کرد. و بعد از آنکه بیدار می‌شدم، در همان دقیقه هنوز بوجود خودم شک داشتم، از زمان و مکان خودم بیخبر بودم - گویا خوابهایی که می‌دیدم همه اش را خودم درست کرده بودم و تعبیر حقیقی آنرا می‌دانسته ام.,"It was as if there was no barrier in front of thought, time and place were losing their effect - this sense of killed lust that was born of sleep was the product of my ultimate needs. Unbelievable but natural shapes and events in front of me. Embodied. And after I woke up, at that moment I was still skeptical of myself, unaware of my time and place - as if I had made all the dreams I had myself and knew the true meaning of them.","In it time and place lost their validity. My repressed lusts, my secret needs, which had begotten this dream, gave rise to shapes and to happenings which were beyond belief but which seemed natural to me. For a few moments after waking up I had no sense of time or place and doubted whether I really existed. It would seem that I myself created all my dreams and had long known the correct interpretation of them.","In any case it was much more real and natural than my wakeful world, as if there were no hindrance or obstacle in front of my thoughts, as if time and place were losing their hold.—This extinguished feeling of lust, the offspring of which was sleep, was the offspring of my ultimate necessities, conjuring up before me unbelievable yet natural figures and happenings, and after I would awaken, in that same moment I was unaware of the time and place of my being, I still doubted my own existence—maybe the dreams I had were all made up by myself and I knew their truthful interpretations beforehand."
هر چه بیشتر در خودم فرو می‌رفتم، مثل جانورانی که زمستان در یک سوراخ پنهان می‌شوند، صدای دیگران را با گوشم می‌شنیدم و صدای خودم را در گلویم می‌شنیدم - تنهایی و انزوائی که پشت سرم پنهان شده بود مانند شبهای ازلی و غلیظ و متراکم بود، شبهائی که تاریکی چسبنده، غلیظ و مسری دارند و منتظرند روی سر شهرهای خلوت که پر از خوابهای شهوت و کینه است فرود بیایند - ولی من در مقابل این گلوئی که برای خودم بودم بیش از یک نوع اثبات مطلق و مجنون چیز دیگری نبودم - فشاری که در موقع تولید مثل دونفر را برای دفع تنهایی به هم می‌چسباند در نتیجه همین جنبه جنون آمیزاست که در هر کس وجود دارد و با تاسفی آمیخته است که آهسته به سوی عمق مرگ متمایل می‌شود....تنها مرگ است که دروغ نمی‌گوید!حضور مرگ همه موهومات را نیست و نابود می‌کند. مابچه مرگ هستیم و مرگ است که ما را از فریب های زندگی نجات می‌دهد، و درته زندگی اوست که ما را صدا می‌زند و به سوی خودش می‌خواند - در سن هائی که ما هنوز زبان مردم را نمی‌فهمیم اگر گاهی در میان بازی مکث می‌کنیم، برای این است که صدای مرگ را بشنویم..... و درتمام مدت زندگی مرگ است که به ما اشاره می‌کند - آیا برای کسی اتفاق نیفتاده که ناگهان و بدون دلیل به فکر فرو برود و بقدری در فکر غوطه ور بشود که از زمان و مکان خود ش بیخبر بشود و نداند که فکر چه چیز را می‌کند؟ آنوقت بعد باید کوشش بکند برای این که بوضعیت و دنیای ظاهری خودش دوباره آگاه و آشنا بشود - این صدای مرگ است.درین رختخواب نمناکی که بوی عرق گرفته بود و وقتی که پلکهای چشمم سنگین می‌شد و می‌خواستم خودم را تسلیم نیستی و شب جاودانی بکنم، همه یادبودهای گمشده و ترس های فراموش شده ام، از سر جان می‌گرفت: ترس اینکه پرهای متکا تیغه خنجر بشود - دگمه ستره ام بی اندازه بزرگ باندازه سنگ آسیا بشود -ترس اینکه تکه نان لواشی که به زمین میافتد مثل شیشه بشکند -دلواپسی اینکه اگرخوابم ببرد روغن پیه سوز بزمین بریزد و شهر آتش بگیرد، وسواس اینکه پاهای سگ جلو دکان قصابی مثل سم اسب صدا بدهد،هول و هرا س اینکه صدایم ببرد و هر چه فریاد بزنم کسی بدادم نرسد...من آرزو می‌کردم بچگی خودم را بیاد بیاورم، اما وقتی که میامد و آن را حس می‌کردم مثل همان ایام سخت ودردناک بود!سرفه هائی که صدای سرفه یا بوهای سیاه لاغر جلو دکان قصابی را میداد، و تهدید دائمی‌مرگ که همه افکار او را بدون امید برگشت لگد مال می‌کند و میگذرد بدون بیم وهراس نبود.نمیدانم دیوارهای اطاقم چه تاثیر زهر آلودی با خودش داشت که افکار مرا مسموم می‌کرد - من حتم داشتم که پیش از مرگ یکنفر دیوانه زنجیری درین اطاق بوده، نه تنها دیوارهای اطاقم، بلکه منظره بیرون و همه و همه دست بیکی کرده بودند برا ی این افکار را در من تولید بکنند.!چند شب پیش همینکه در شاه نشین حمام لباسهایم را کند م افکارم عوض شد. استاد حمامی‌که آب روی سرم می‌ریخت مثل این بود که افکار سیاهم شسته می‌شد.در حمام سایه خودم را به دیوار خیس عرق کرده دیدم.به تن خودم دقت کردم، ران، ساق پا و میان تنم یک حالت شهوت انگیز ناامید داشت.سایه آنها هم مثل ده سال پیش بود مثل وقتی که بچه بودم. سر بینه که لباسم را پوشیدم، حرکات قیافه و افکارم دوباره عوض شد.مثل اینکه در محیط و دنیای جدیدی داخل شده بودم، مثل اینکه در همان دنیائی که از آن متنفر بودم دوباره بدنیا آمده بودم.,"The more I immersed myself, like the animals hiding in a hole in the winter, the more I heard the voices of others, and the more I heard my own voice in my throat - the loneliness and isolation hidden behind me was like the eternal, dense nights. Nights where the darkness is sticky, thick and contagious, waiting to land on secluded cities full of dreams of lust and resentment - but I was nothing more than a kind of absolute and insane proof in front of my throat - a pressure that During reproduction, it binds two people together to repel loneliness. As a result, this is the insane aspect that exists in everyone and is mixed with regret, which slowly tends to the depths of death .... It is only death that does not lie! The presence of death It does not destroy all illusions. We are children of death, and it is death that saves us from the deceptions of life, and it is in his life that he calls us and calls us to himself - at an age when we still do not understand the language of the people, if we sometimes pause in the game, It is to hear the voice of death ..... and it's all our lives that death points to us - has it not happened to someone that he suddenly thinks for no reason and becomes so immersed in thought that from time and place Unaware of himself and does not know what he is thinking? Then he must strive to become aware of his own state and world of appearance again - this is the sound of death. All the lost memories and forgotten fears came to life: the fear that the feathers leaning on the blade of the dagger - my big button would become too big for an Asian stone - the fear that a piece of lavash bread falling to the ground would break like glass - the fear that if I slept He pours the tallow oil on the ground and sets the city on fire, obsessed with the dog's feet in front of the butcher shop sounding like a horse's hoof, the horror of making a noise and not letting anyone yell at me ... I wished I could remember my childhood. , But when he came and I felt it, it was like those hard and painful days! The coughs that gave the sound of coughing or the faint black smells in front of the butcher shop, and the constant threat of death that kicks all his thoughts without hope of return and passes without fear. I was not afraid. I do not know what poisonous effect the walls of my room had on me, which poisoned my thoughts - I must have The theme that was a chain in this room before the death of a crazy person, not only the walls of my room, but also the view outside and everyone and everyone had their hands full to produce these thoughts in me! My thoughts changed. The master of the bath, whose water was pouring on my head, was as if my black thoughts were being washed away. In the bath, I saw my shadow sweating on the wet wall. It was like ten years ago, when I was a kid. The moment I put on my clothes, the movements of my face and thoughts changed again. It was as if I had entered a new environment and world, as if I had been born again in the same world that I hated.","I retired as deep as I could into the depths of my own being like an animal that hides itself in a cave in the wintertime. I heard other people’s voices with my ears; my own I heard in my throat. The solitude that surrounded me was like the deep, dense night of eternity, that night of dense, clinging, contagious darkness which awaits the moment when it will descend upon silent cities full of dreams of lust and rancour. From the viewpoint of this throat with which I had identified myself I was nothing more than an insane abstract mathematical demonstration. The pressure which, in the act of procreation, holds together two people who are striving to escape from their solitude is the result of this same streak of madness which exists in every person, mingled with regret at the thought that he is slowly sliding towards the abyss of death… Only death does not lie. The presence of death annihilates all superstitions. We are the children of death and it is death that rescues us from the deceptions of life. In the midst of life he calls us and summons us to him. At an age when we have not yet learnt the language of men, if at times we pause in our play it is that we may listen to the voice of death… Throughout our life death is beckoning to us. Has it not happened to everyone suddenly, without reason, to be plunged into thought and to remain immersed so deeply in it as to lose consciousness of time and place and the working of his own mind? At such times one has to make an effort in order to perceive and recognize again the phenomenal world in which men live. One has been listening to the voice of death. Lying in this damp, sweaty bed, as my eyelids grew heavy and I longed to surrender myself to non-being and everlasting night, I felt that my lost memories and forgotten fears were all coming to life again: fear lest the feathers in my pillow should turn into dagger blades or the buttons on my coat expand to the size of millstones; fear lest the breadcrumbs that fell to the floor should shatter into fragments like pieces of glass; apprehension lest the oil in the lamp should spill during my sleep and set fire to the whole city; anxiety lest the paws of the dog outside the butcher’s shop should ring like horses’ hoofs as they struck the ground; dread lest the old odds-and-ends man sitting behind his wares should burst into laughter and be unable to stop; fear lest the worms in the foot bath by the tank in our courtyard should turn into Indian serpents; fear lest my bedclothes should turn into a hinged gravestone above me and the marble teeth should lock, preventing me from ever escaping; panic fear lest I should suddenly lose the faculty of speech and, however much I might try to call out, nobody should ever come to my aid… I used to try to recall the days of my childhood but when I succeeded in doing so and experienced that time again it was as grim and painful as the present. Other things which brought their contribution of anxiety and fear were my coughing, which sounded like that of the gaunt, black horses in front of the butcher’s shop; my spitting, and the fear lest the phlegm should some day reveal a streak of blood, the tepid, salty liquid which rises from the depths of the body, the juice of life, which we must vomit up in the end; and the continuous menace of death, which smashes for ever the fabric of the mind and passes on. Life as it proceeds reveals, coolly and dispassionately, what lies behind the mask that each man wears. It would seem that everyone possesses several faces. Some people use only one all the time, and it then, naturally, becomes soiled and wrinkled. These are the thrifty sort. Others look after their masks in the hope of passing them on to their descendants. Others again are constantly changing their faces. But all of them, when they reach old age, realize one day that the mask they are wearing is their last and that it will soon be worn out, and then, from behind the last mask, the real face appears. The walls of my room must have contained some virus that poisoned all my thoughts. I felt sure that before me some murderer, some diseased madman, had lived in it. Not only the walls of the room itself, but the view from the window, the butcher, the old odds-and-ends man, my nurse, the bitch and everyone whom I used to see, even the bowl from which I ate my barley broth and the clothes that I wore – all these had conspired together to engender such thoughts in my brain. A few nights ago when I took off my clothes in a cubicle at the bathhouse my thoughts took a new direction. As the attendant poured water over my head I felt as though my black thoughts were being washed away. I observed my shadow on the steamy wall of the bathhouse. I saw that I was as frail and thin as I had been ten years earlier, when I was a child. I remembered distinctly that my shadow had fallen then in just the same way on the wet wall of the bathhouse. I looked down at my body. There was something lascivious and yet hopeless in the look of my thighs, calves and loins. Their shadow too had not changed since ten years before, when I was only a child. I felt that my whole life had passed without purpose or meaning like the flickering shadows on the bathhouse wall. Other people were massive, solid, thick-necked. Doubtless the shadows they cast on the steamy wall of the bathhouse were bigger and denser and left their imprint for some moments after they had gone, whereas mine was effaced instantaneously. When I had finished dressing after the bath my gestures and thoughts seemed to change again. It was as though I had entered a different world, as though I had been born again in the old world that I detested. At all events I could say that I had acquired a new life, for it seemed a miracle to me that I had not dissolved in the bath like a lump of salt. My life appeared to me just as strange, as unnatural, as in­explicable, as the picture on the pen case that I am using this moment as I write.","The more I sank into myself, like an animal that seeks refuge in a burrow during wintertime, the more I heard the voices of others with my ears and the more I heard the voice in my throat—the loneliness and isolation that had hidden behind me were like eternal nights, thick and compressed, nights that have a viscous, dense and contagious darkness and that wait before descending upon the deserted cities that are full of dreams, lustful and spiteful—but besides being a certain insane and abstract proof for this voice that I considered my own, I was nothing— During the act of procreation, the force that bonds two people together escaping solitude is in essence a trait that exists in each person, a madness which is imbued with a grief that slowly draws toward the depths of death. Only Death does not lie! The presence of Death destroys and annihilates all superstitions. We are the children of Death and it is Death that rescues us from the falsehoods of life, and at the end of life it is He that calls us and summons us closer to himself—During the tender age when we still do not understand human speech, if we pause for a moment while at play, it is to hear the sound of Death . . . and throughout life it is Death that is pointing at us— Has such an occurrence not happened for everyone whereby suddenly and without reason they go into thought and so immersed are they in thought that they become unaware of their surroundings and time, and forget what it was that they were thinking of? Then one has to struggle to once more become aware of and familiar with their surroundings and the visible world— This is the sound of Death. In this damp bed that had come to smell like sweat, when my eyelids became heavy and I wanted to surrender myself to nothingness and the eternal night, all of my lost memories and forgotten fears again came to life: the fear that the pillow feathers would become dagger blades, that the button on my cloak would expand to the size of a millstone—the fear that the piece of lavash1 falling to the floor would shatter like glass; the worry that if I should fall asleep the oil of the tallow-burner would spill on the ground and raze the city; the obsession that the paws of the dog in front of the butcher’s would begin to sound like horse’s hooves; the anxiety that the old peddler would begin to laugh as he sat in front of his wares, so hard would he laugh that he could not control himself; the fear that the worm in the footbath of our house would turn into an Indian snake; the fear that my hands would become leaden; the fear that my bedding would turn into a hinged tombstone and by sliding on itself, it would lock its marble teeth and entomb me; the anxiety that my voice would leave me and no matter how much I would shout, no one would come to my aid. . . . I used to wish that I could bring back the memories of my childhood, but when they came and I experienced them, they were as painful and difficult as they were at the time! The following things were not without fear and anxiety: the continuous threat of death, which incurably tramples all thoughts and forges ahead; coughs that sounded like the coughs of the skinny, black packhorses in front of the butcher’s shop; being forced to bring up the mucous and the fear lest a spot of blood be found in it—blood, this flowing, tepid, salty liquid that emerges from the depths of the body, the elixir of life that must be forcibly disgorged. Life, with coolness and indifference, will reveal to each person their mask—perhaps each person carries several masks— Some only continuously use one of these masks and, naturally, it will become dirty, gathering wrinkles and folds. This group is frugal— The other group saves their masks for their offspring, and others continuously change their faces but as soon as they grow old they realize that they are using their last face and that it will soon become worn out, after which their real face will emerge from behind the mask. I do not know what toxic effects the walls of my room had on my thoughts so as to poison them—I was certain that before me someone who was a murderer, a chained lunatic, was in this room; not only the walls in my room but also the view outside, the butcher, the old peddler, my nanny, that whore and all the people that I saw, and also the bowl in which I ate my barley ash and the clothes that I wore, all of these things had come together to create these thoughts in me—Several nights ago, just as I was taking my clothes off in the alcove of the bathhouse, my thoughts changed— When the bath attendant was pouring water over my head, it was as if my dark thoughts were being washed away. In the bathhouse I saw my shadow on the dripping-wet wall, I saw that I was as skinny and fragile as I had been ten years ago when a child, I precisely remember that my shadow would fall on the dripping-wet wall in this same manner—I inspected my body. My thigh, calf and loins looked somehow hopelessly lustful— their shadows, too, were like ten years prior, like when I was a child—I felt that my life, like a shadow that wanders aimlessly, like the shadows that tremble on the bathhouse wall, had entirely passed by without meaning or purpose. But others were strong, sturdy and thick-necked, certainly their shadows cast larger and more colorfully on the dripping-wet bathhouse wall, and they left their impressions for a time, while mine quickly became erased—When I dressed again in the alcove, my appearance, movement and thoughts changed once more, as if I had entered into a new world, as if I had been reborn into the very world I despised."
ولی تلفظ این کلمات از ته دل نبود، چون من بیشتر خوشم می‌آمد با یک نفر دوست یا آشنا حرف بزنم تا با خدا، با قادر متعال! چون خدا از سرمن زیاد تر بود.,"But the pronunciation of these words was not from the bottom of my heart, because I would rather talk to a friend or acquaintance than to God, the Almighty! Because God was greater than Sarman.","The words were not spoken from the heart. I found it pleasanter to talk to a friend or acquaintance than to God, the high and mighty One. God was too important a personage for me.","During prayer I would close my eyes and hold my palms in front of my face—in this night that I had created for myself, like the words they unconsciously repeat while sleeping, I would pray, but the utterance of these words was not from deep within my heart, for I would much rather talk to a friend or an acquaintance than with God, with Almighty God! For God was too much for me."
در هر صورت خیلی حقیقی تر و طبیعی تر از دنیای بیداریم بود.,"In any case, it was much more real and natural than the waking world.","At all events it was far more real and natural to me than my waking world and presented no obstacle, no barrier, to my ideas.","In any case it was much more real and natural than my wakeful world, as if there were no hindrance or obstacle in front of my thoughts, as if time and place were losing their hold.—This extinguished feeling of lust, the offspring of which was sleep, was the offspring of my ultimate necessities, conjuring up before me unbelievable yet natural figures and happenings, and after I would awaken, in that same moment I was unaware of the time and place of my being, I still doubted my own existence—maybe the dreams I had were all made up by myself"
درهمین وقت صدای اذان بلند شد. یک اذان بی موقع بود گویا زنی، شاید آن لکاته مشغول زائیدن بود، سرخشت رفته بود. صدای ناله سگی از لابلای اذان صبح شنیده می‌شد. من با خودم فکر کردم: (اگر راست است که هر کسی یک ستاره روی اسمان دارد،ستاره من باید دور، تاریک و بی معنی باشد – شاید اصلا من ستاره نداشته ام!),"At the same time, the call to prayer was heard. It was an untimely call to prayer, as if a woman, maybe that Lakata was giving birth, had lost her glow. The sound of a dog moaning could be heard from the morning call to prayer. I thought to myself: (If it is true that everyone has a star in the sky, my star must be far away, dark and meaningless - maybe I did not have a star at all!)","As I watched I heard from somewhere the voice of a muezzin, although it was not the time for the call to prayer. It sounded like the cry of a woman – it could have been the bitch – in the pangs of childbirth. Mingled with the cry was the sound of a dog howling. I thought to myself, “If it is true that everyone has his own star in the sky mine must be remote, dark and meaningless. Perhaps I have never had a star at all.”","At this time the call to prayer started, it was an ill-timed call to prayer—perhaps a woman, maybe that whore, was in labor, was busy delivering. The howling of a dog was heard amidst the call to prayer; I thought to myself, “If it’s true that each person has a star in the sky, then mine must be far, dark and meaningless—maybe I never had a star.”"

It’s a flower vase from Rhages, comes from the ancient city of Rey. Yes. That’s all right, you can have the jar. Keep it to remember me by.” I put my hand into my pocket and took out two krans and one abbasi. The old man, with a hollow laugh which brought out gooseflesh all over my body, said: “No, no.

Come and I’ll drive you home.","was a figure whose face was covered with a scarf, and who had something wrapped with a handkerchief under his arm; he turned to me and said, “You must’ve wanted to go to town, lost the way, yes?

Please take it , it’s nothing, I’ll give you this jug so you have something to remember me by.” I put my hands in my pocket and pulled out two gherans and one abbasi. With a dry, repulsive laugh the old man said, “Never, it’s nothing, I know you. I know where you live as well —I have a carriage hearse right next to here , let me take you to your house,"
در این لحظه افکارم منجمد شده بود، یک زندگی منحصر بفرد عجیب در من تولید شد.چون زندگیم مربوط بهمهء هستیهایی میشد که دور من بودند، بهمهء سایه هایی که در اطرافم میلرزیدند و وابستگی عمیق و جدایی ناپذیر با دنیا و حرکت موجودات و طبیعت داشتم و بوسیلهء رشته های نامریی جریان اضطرابی بین من و همهء عناصر طبیعت برقرار شده بود - هیچگونه فکر و خیالی بنظرم غیر طبیعی نمی‌آمد- من قادر بودم بآسانی برموز نقاشی های قدیمی، باسرار کتابهای مشکل فلسفه، به حماقت ازلی اشکال و انواع پی ببرم. زیرا در این لحظه من در گردش زمین و افلاک، در نشو و نمای رستنیها و جنبش جانوران شرکت داشتم، گذشته و آینده، دور و نزدیک با زندگی احساساتی من شریک و توام شده بود.,"At this moment my thoughts were frozen, a strangely unique life was produced in me. Because my life was related to all the beings around me, to all the shadows that shook around me, and I had a deep and inseparable connection with the world and the movement of beings and nature. And through the invisible strings a stream of anxiety was established between me and all the elements of nature - no thought seemed imaginary to me - I was able to easily, through the old paintings, through the difficult books of philosophy, realize the eternal folly of forms and forms. Because at this moment I was participating in the rotation of the earth and the heavens, in the growth and development of plants and the movement of animals, the past and the future, far and near, shared with my emotional life.","At that moment my thoughts were numbed. Within me I felt a new and singular form of life. My being was somehow connected with that of all the creatures that existed about me, with all the shadows that quivered around me. I was in intimate, inviolable communion with the outside world and with all created things, and a complex system of invisible conductors transmitted a restless flow of impulses between me and all the elements of nature. There was no conception, no notion which I felt to be foreign to me. I was capable of penetrating with ease the secrets of the painters of the past, the mysteries of abstruse philosophies, the ancient folly of ideas and species. At that moment I participated in the revolutions of earth and heaven, in the germination of plants and in the instinctive movements of animals. Past and future, far and near had joined together and fused in the life of my mind.","In this moment my thoughts froze, a life belonging to that of an extraordinary person was born in me. As my life was tied to all the beings around me, to all the shadows that quivered around me, and because of the profound and inseparable connection I had with the world, the movements of creatures and nature, and because of the restless current between myself and all the elements of nature that had been established by way of invisible threads—no idea or thought seemed unnatural to me—I was entirely content to uncover the secrets of ancient paintings, the mysteries of abstruse philosophical texts, the eternal depths of species and forms, for in this moment I was partaking in the turning of heaven and earth, in the design and appearance of plant life, in the movement of beasts. Past and future, near and far became partner to and melded with my spiritual existence."
