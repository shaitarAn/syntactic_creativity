"- Azért nem is kerested, ugye? Pedig talán csak a kezedet kellett volna kinyújtani. De most még egy sanszod van. Ide hallgass. Te, azt hiszem, megtaláltam Ervint.","- You didn't look for it, did you? And maybe you should have just reached out. But now you have another chance. Listen here. You, I think I found Ervin.","“So you didn’t try, right? Even though perhaps all you had to do was stretch out your hand. But now you’ve another chance. Listen to this. I think I’ve traced Ervin.”","“So you didn’t even bother, is that it? All you had to do was to reach out your hand. There’s still a chance. Listen to me. I think I may have found Ervin.”"
"Meg kellene még nézni sok olasz várost, azok bizonyára még sok mindent rejtegetnek. Elhatározta, hogy írni fog haza, és pénzt kér.","There are still many Italian cities to see, they certainly have a lot to hide. He was determined to write home and ask for money.",He still had so many Italian cities to see. They would surely have so much for him to discover. He decided to write home and ask for money.,"There were so many Italian cities left to see, cities shrouded in great mysteries. He made up his mind to write home and ask for money."

"Az idő lejárt. Mihály meggyógyult, és el kellett hagynia a kórházat. A rab, mikor húsz évi fogság után kiengedik, érezheti magát ilyen mindentől elszakadtnak és ilyen céltalannak, mint Mihály, amikor kis poggyászával - mert nem volt más tulajdona, mint amit Perugiában igen takarékosan összevásárolt szökése napján - végighaladt Foligno alacsony házai közt.","Time's up. Michael recovered and had to leave the hospital. The prisoner, when released after twenty years in captivity, may feel as detached and as pointless as Michael when he passed through the low houses of Foligno with his small luggage — because he had no property other than what he bought very sparingly in Perugia on the day of his escape.","HIS TIME was up. Mihály was well again and due to leave the hospital. No thief released after twenty years’ prison could have felt more cut off from everything, or more devoid of purpose, than Mihály did when, with his little suitcase (his only possessions were the few frugal purchases he had put together on the day of his escape) he made his solitary way between the low-roofed houses of Foligno.","It was time. Mihály recovered and had to leave the hospital. Even an inmate, once he’s allowed to go free after twenty years’ imprisonment, would feel as disconnected from everything and as aimless as Mihály felt with his puny satchel packed with all his earthly possessions, cheap odds and ends he’d scrambled to buy in Perugia on the day of his escape. It was in this state that he lumbered along the strangely-built squat houses of Foligno."
"Bementek a szobába, Vannina körülnézett, és azt kérdezte:","They went into the room, Vannina looked around and asked:","They went into the room. Vannina looked round, and asked:",Vannina looked around and asked if the signora was home.
"- A Pater Prior jósága révén abban a szerencsés helyzetben vagyok, hogy megkínálhatlak egy kis borral - mondta Ervin. Mihályban most tudatosodott az az enyhe idegenszerűség, ahogy Ervin beszélt. Hiszen annyi éve nem beszélt már magyarul... - Mindjárt be is töltök. Jól fog esni neked a hosszú út után.","""Because of the goodness of Pater Prior, I'm in the fortunate position of offering you some wine,"" Ervin said. Michael was now aware of the slight alienation that Ervin had spoken. You haven't spoken Hungarian in so many years ... - I'll fill it in soon. It will be good for you after a long journey.","“Thanks to the goodness of Pater Prior we are in the happy situation of being able to offer a little wine,” said Ervin. Mihály was struck by the peculiar way he spoke. No doubt he hadn’t spoken Hungarian for so many years … “Now for a drink. I’ll pour you some straight away. It’ll do you good to take something after the long walk.”","“Thanks to Father Prior’s generosity, I have the good fortune of being able to offer you a little wine,” said Ervin. Mihály sensed something peculiar about Ervin’s speech. It was obvious he hadn’t spoken Hungarian for years. “Here,” Ervin said, “let me fill your glass. It will do you good after your long journey.”"
"- A dolog nem volt egészen nekem való, mert én kissé talán túlságosan is fogékony vagyok az ilyen természetű dolgok iránt, mégis kénytelen voltam ott maradni, orvosi kötelességből. Egyébként a várakozás egyáltalán nem volt kellemetlen, a hölgy nem volt rémült vagy eksztatikus, csodálatosan józan, sőt, anélkül hogy dicsekedni akarnék vele, valósággal kacéran viselkedett velem szemben... Szinte el is felejtettem, hogy miért jöttem oda, és hogy az éjfél közeledik. Éjfél előtt egyszer csak kézen fogott, a másik kezébe mécsest vett, és levezetett abba a földszinti terembe, amelybe a halottak kapuja nyílt.","“It wasn’t quite for me, because I’m a little perhaps too receptive to things like that, yet I was forced to stay there, out of medical duty. Anyway, the wait wasn't uncomfortable at all, the lady wasn't terrified or ecstatic, she was wonderfully sober, in fact, without wanting to brag about her, she was really flirtatious with me ... I almost forgot why I came there and that midnight was approaching . One night before midnight, he took her by the hand, took a candle in the other hand, and led her down to the room on the ground floor where the gate to the dead opened.","“This was not exactly what I would have wanted, because I am perhaps a little too impressionable in these matters, but I really had no alternative than to stay, out of my duty as a doctor. The waiting was not otherwise unpleasant. The woman was neither terrified or crazed. She was remarkably calm, indeed rather cheerful. In fact, though I don’t wish to seem boastful, her behaviour was frankly quite flirtatious towards me … I almost forgot why I was there, and that midnight was approaching. Just before midnight she suddenly seized my hand, took a night-light in the other, and led me down to the ground floor room, the one into which the door of the dead opened.","“I wasn’t cut out to deal with cases like this. I’m somewhat gullible about things of this nature. Still I was obliged to stay. Out of my duty as a physician. The wait itself was not at all unpleasant. The patient exhibited no signs of anxiety or hysteria. She was quite composed, in full possession of her senses, in fact — and I hope you don’t take this the wrong way — she was rather the flirt with me. I had nearly forgotten why I’d come, and that it was close to midnight. Then suddenly, right before midnight, she took up a candle, grasped my hand, and led me downstairs to the room containing the door of the dead."
"Mihálynak nagyon nagy kedve lett volna Sienába menni, Millicenttől eltekintve is. Folignót már halálosan unta, Siena után pedig nagyon vágyódott, mert most, hogy apátiája elmúlt, Olaszország városai megint édes-kínosan kezdték követelni, hogy megnézze valamennyiüket, és élje át titkukat, amíg nem késő. Mint nászútja kezdetén, megint úgy hordta magában azt a valamit, amit Olaszország jelentett, mint egy nagyon törékeny kincset, amit egyik percről a másikra kiejthet kezéből. Millicent pedig, amióta megcsókolta, sokkal kívánatosabb volt, mint azelőtt, és az ilyen kalandoknak az a természetük, hogy az ember szeret a végükre járni.","Michael would have liked to go to Siena, apart from Millicent. Foligno was already bored to death, and longing for Siena, because now that his apathy was over, the cities of Italy were once again beginning to sweetly and embarrassingly demand to see them all and go through their secrets until it was too late. As at the beginning of his honeymoon, he was once again carrying something that Italy meant as a very fragile treasure that he could get out of his hand from one minute to the next. And Millicent, since he kissed her, has been much more desirable than before, and the nature of such adventures is that one loves to end them.","Mihály very much wanted to go to Siena, even without considering Millicent. Foligno by now bored him to death, and he really longed to go to Siena because, now that his apathy had lifted, the Italian cities once again began to press their sweet, terrible claim, that he should see every one of them and experience their secrets before it was too late. As at the start of his honeymoon, he again carried inside him the mystery Italy stood for, like a great delicate treasure he might at any moment let slip from his hands. Moreover, ever since he had kissed her, Millicent had become much more desirable, and it is in the nature of such adventures that a man likes to see them through.","Mihály was elated by the prospect of going to Siena, regardless of Millicent. Foligno had started to bore him to death, and now that he was over his depression, he was eager to see Siena and all the other Italian towns which once again beckoned him with siren-like urgency. He had to share in their mysteries before it was too late. Once again he felt as he had at the beginning of his honeymoon, when he carried inside him all that Italy meant to him as if it were a fragile relic that, from one moment to the next, could fall out of his hands. And regarding Millicent, ever since he’d kissed her, she’d become much more desirable. And it was only natural for him to pursue his desire to its natural, inevitable conclusion."
"- Semmi közöm Pataki álláspontjához, és az egész dologhoz most már semmi közöm. Beszéljetek Erzsivel. Én mindenbe belemegyek, amit ő akar.","""I have nothing to do with Pataki's position, and I have nothing to do with the whole thing right now."" Talk to Ersi. I go into everything he wants.","“Pataki’s point of view is none of my business, and the whole affair is none of my business. You talk to Erzsi. I’ll fall in with whatever she wants.”",“I have nothing to do with Pataki’s position. I have nothing to do with any of this. Talk to Erzsi. I’ll agree to anything she wants.”
"- Ezek hosszú és semmitmondó szavak. Meg kell próbálnia. Át kell mennie Gubbióba, ott él egy csodatévő szerzetes, fent, Sant Ubaldo kolostorában.","- These are long and meaningless words. You have to try. You have to go over to Gubbio, where a miraculous monk lives, up in the convent of Sant Ubaldo.","“Those are long meaningless words. You really should try. You should go to Gubbio. There is a monk up there, in the Sant’ Ubaldo monastery, who works miracles.”",“Big words. The usual windbag reservations. You’ll just have to give it a go. You’ll need to travel to Gubbio. There’s a monk up in the Saint Ubaldo monastery who works miracles.”
"Mihály borzongva nézett körül Waldheim szobájának vidám káoszában. Valamelyest emlékeztetett a régi szobára az Ulpius-házban. Valami jelet keresett, valamit, ami egész konkrét formában igazolná... Tamás közelségét, Tamásét, akinek a gondolatait Waldheim tudományos tisztasággal és tárgyilagossággal adja itt elő, ebben a nyári éjszakában. Waldheim hangja most már metszően éles, süvítő volt, mint mindig, mikor magyarázata a „lényeget” súrolta. Mihály gyorsan felhajtott egy pohár bort, és az ablakhoz lépett, hogy levegőt szívjon; valami nagyon ránehezedett.","Michael looked around in the merry chaos of Waldheim's room. It was somewhat reminiscent of the old room in the House of Ulpius. He was looking for a sign, something that would justify it in a very concrete form ... the proximity of Thomas, whose thoughts Waldheim presents here with scientific purity and objectivity, this summer night. Waldheim's voice was now sharply sharp, hissing, as always, as his explanation scrubbed the ""essence."" Michael quickly rolled up a glass of wine and went to the window to breathe; something was very difficult.","Mihály looked around with a shiver at the cheerful chaos of Waldheims’s room. It reminded him subtly of that other room, in the Ulpius house. He was looking for a sign, something specific to focus … perhaps the near-presence of Tamás, Tamás whose inner thoughts Waldheim, with his brilliant scholarly objectivity and clarity, had expressed here, this summer night. Waldheim’s voice was again edged with that sharp, inspired quality it always took on when he talked about the ‘divine essence’. Mihály rapidly downed a glass of wine and went over to the window for a breath of air. Something oppressed him deeply.","In a daze Mihály surveyed the cheerful chaos of Waldheim’s room. Something about it made him think of the old room in the Ulpius house. He looked for a sign, something concrete which would affirm the presence of Tamás. Yes, Tamás whose thoughts Waldheim was echoing with such intellectual clarity and objectivity on this summer night. Waldheim’s voice neared its cutting edge, as it usually did when he closed in on the heart of his argument. Mihály quickly polished off another glass of wine and stepped to the window for air. Something depressed him profoundly."
"- Igen. De Mihály nem olyan, mint más ember. Azért is mentem hozzá.",- Yes. But Michael is not like any other person. That's why I went to him.,“Yes. But Mihály isn’t like other people. That’s why I chose him.”,“Yes. Mihály isn’t like any other man. That’s why I married him.”
"Felkelt, megmosdott, és elindult csavarogni a nyári éjszakában. Nemsokára az Acqua Paolához ért, és gyönyörködött a klasszikus vízesésben, amely időtlen nyugalommal, gőggel és méltósággal végezte mesterségét a holdfényben. Eszébe jutott a kis magyar szobrász, akivel a Collegium Hungaricumban ismerkedett meg Waldheim révén. A szobrász gyalog jött Drezdából Rómába, a Via Flaminián jött be, azon az úton, amelyről gimnazista korában megtanulta, hogy ott vonultak be mindig észak felől a győzelmes idegenek. Azután ide ért fel az első este, a Gianicolóra. Megvárta, amíg a parkból mindenkit kikergetnek, és bezárják a kaput. Akkor átmászott a falon, és ott aludt egy bokorban, Róma fölött, lábánál a Város. Hajnalban felkelt, levetkőzött, és megfürdött az Acqua Paola medencéjében, a klasszikus vizekben.","He got up, washed up, and set off to roam the summer night. He soon reached the Acqua Paola and admired the classic waterfall, which carried out his craft in the moonlight with timeless serenity, pride and dignity. He remembered the little Hungarian sculptor he had met at the Collegium Hungaricum through Waldheim. The sculptor came on foot from Dresden to Rome, on the Via Flaminia, on the road he had learned in his high school years that victorious strangers had always marched in from the north. Then he got here on the first night to the Gianicolo. He waited until everyone was driven out of the park and the gate was closed. Then he climbed over the wall and slept there in a bush above Rome, at the foot of the City. He got up at dawn, undressed, and bathed in the pool of Acqua Paola, the classic waters.","He got up, washed, and set off for a stroll in the summer night. Soon he reached the Acqua Paola and stood delighting in the classical waterfall as, with timeless calm and proud dignity, it exercised its mystery in the moonlight. He remembered the little Hungarian sculptor in the Collegium Hungaricum whom he had got to know through Waldheim. The sculptor had walked from Dresden to Rome along the Via Flaminia, which, as Mihály knew from school, was the route always taken by victorious invaders from the north. Then on his first evening he had come up here, on to the Gianicolo. He had waited for them to clear everyone from the park and lock the gate, then he climbed over the wall and lay down in a bush, high above Rome, with the city at his feet. When morning came he rose, undressed and bathed in the pool of the Acqua Paolo, the classical waterfall.","He got up, washed, and went out into the cool summer night. Soon he reached the Acqua Paola, and there he found himself marvelling at the classic waterfall in the moonlight, how it mastered the art of falling with grace, haughty grandeur, and timeless serenity. It reminded him of the little Hungarian sculptor he’d met through Waldheim at the Collegium Hungaricum. The sculptor had come on foot all the way from Dresden to Rome on the Via Flaminia, the ancient road from the north so many victorious armies had marched through in the course of history (a morsel of knowledge he’d retained from his schooldays). On his first night the sculptor had come up here to Gianicolo Hill. He’d waited until everybody was chased from the park and the gates closed, then he climbed over the wall and reclined by a bush, overlooking all of Rome, the entire city at his feet. He rose at dawn, took his clothes off and bathed in the sublime waters of the Acqua Paola."
"Kidüllesztette hatalmas mellkasát, azután megmutatta karizmait, kissé cirkuszias mozdulattal, és már a lábát is fel akarta emelni, de Sári leintette:","He pushed out his huge chest, then showed his charisma with a slight circus motion, and he wanted to lift his leg, but Sari waved.","He puffed out his powerful chest, then displayed his biceps, somewhat in the circus manner, and was about to raise a leg when Sári intervened: “Slow down.","He pumped up his massive chest, then flexed his arm in the manner of a circus performer and was about to roll up his trousers to show-off his calf muscle when Sári checked him: “Not so fast."
"- Nem azért. Azok a rangok, amelyeket én elérhetnék, összeegyeztethetők az alázatossággal, annál is inkább, mert az embernek alkalmat adnának gőgjének a legyőzésére. Egész más okból nem akartam karriert csinálni. Azért nem, mert előmenetelemet nem annak köszönhettem volna, hogy jó szerzetes vagyok, hanem olyan tulajdonságaimnak, amelyeket még világi életemből, sőt az őseimtől hoztam magammal. A nyelvtehetségemnek meg annak, hogy egyes dolgokat néha gyorsabban és jobban meg tudok fogalmazni, mint rendtársaim egy része. Szóval a zsidó tulajdonságaimnak. És azt nem akartam.","- Not because. The ranks I could attain are compatible with humility, all the more so because they would give man a chance to overcome his pride. For a completely different reason, I didn’t want to make a career. Not because I could not owe my progress to being a good monk, but to qualities I had brought with me from my worldly life and even from my ancestors. My language skills and the fact that I can sometimes articulate certain things faster and better than some of my fellow citizens. So to my Jewish qualities. And I didn't want to.","“Not because of that. The kind of office I could attain would be consistent with the ideal of humility, or rather, would give the opportunity to overcome pride. No, I refused a career for quite other reasons. Really, because any advancement would not have been due to my being a good monk but for the sort of qualities I brought with me from the outside world, and in fact from my ancestors—my ability with languages and the fact that I can sometimes deal with matters more quickly and effectively than some of my fellow monks. In a word, my Jewish qualities. And I didn’t want that.”","“No. Whatever rank or promotion I’d achieve would be consistent with the virtue of humility. Especially since it gives us the opportunity to overcome our pride. I had a totally different reason for avoiding a career. Any advancement I’d get wouldn’t be because I was a good monk, but because of things I brought over from my secular life, especially from my ancestors. Like my gift for languages and my knack for being articulate. And, I suppose, I could deal with matters faster and more efficiently than some of my fellow monks. In short, my Jewish assets. And that I didn’t want.”"

You shouldn’t drink when you drive,” said an irritated János."
"Rettenetes meleg nap volt. Mihály délután bódultan járkált a Borghese-kertben, korán lefeküdt, fáradtan elaludt, azután megint felébredt.","It was a terrible hot day. Michael walked stunned in the Borghese Garden in the afternoon, went to bed early, fell asleep tired, then woke up again.","The day was appallingly hot. In the afternoon Mihály walked in a daze round the Borghese gardens, went to bed early, fell asleep in his exhaustion, and later woke again.","The day was beastly hot. A dazed Mihály stumbled around the Borghese Garden in the afternoon, retired early, slept uneasily, but then awakened again in a twilight between wakefulness and dreams."
"El is mentem, mert kíváncsi voltam. Van olyan férfi, akit nem izgat a telefonban megcsendülő ismeretlen és kellemes női hang? A nők, ha ismernék a férfiakat, mindent telefonon és ismeretlenül kérnének tőlük. Az utca - a Roland Street - Londonnak abban az ellenszenves részében terül el, a Tottenham Court Road mögött, a Sohótól északra, ahol azok a művészek és prostituáltak laknak, akiknek már arra sem telik, hogy a Sohóban vagy a Bloomsbury negyedben lakjanak. Nem tudom biztosan, de nagyon valószínűnek tartom, hogy itt szoktak lakni Londonban a vallásalapítók, a gnosztikusok és a szerényebb spiritiszták. Az egész negyed a vallási lecsúszottságot fejezi ki. Szóval ide kellett mennem. Tudnia kell, hogy hihetetlen mértékben fogékony vagyok az utcák és a tájak hangulata iránt. Amint mentem a sötét utcákon át, a Roland Streetet keresve, a ködben - nem fog volt, csak mist, olyan fehér, szemező, tej szerű köd, igazi novemberi - annyira elfogott a vallási lecsúszottság érzése, hogy majdnem tengeri beteg lettem.","I even left because I was curious. Is there a man who isn’t excited by the unknown and pleasant female voice on the phone? Women, if they knew men, would ask them everything over the phone and anonymously. The street - Roland Street - is located in the disgusting part of London, behind Tottenham Court Road, north of Soho, home to artists and prostitutes who no longer have to live in Soho or Bloomsbury. I don’t know for sure, but I think it’s very likely that religious founders, Gnostics, and more modest spiritualists tend to live here in London. The whole quarter expresses religious slippage. So I had to go here. You need to know that I am incredibly receptive to the atmosphere of the streets and landscapes. As I walked through the dark streets, looking for Roland Street, in the fog — it wasn’t going to be just mist, such a white, eye-catching, milky fog, a real November — the feeling of religious slump was so captured that I became almost seasick.","“I went because I was curious. Is there any man who wouldn’t respond to the dulcet tones of an unknown woman on the telephone? If women really knew men they would ask us for everything over the telephone—in unfamiliar voices. The street, Roland Street, was in that rather forbidding bit of London behind Tottenham Court Road, just north of Soho, where the painters and prostitutes live who can’t afford Soho proper or Bloomsbury. I don’t know for certain, but I think it very likely that this is the part of London where you find the founders of new religions, Gnostics and the seedier kinds of spiritualist. The whole area gives off an aura of religious dereliction. Well, anyway, that’s where I had to go. You have to understand I am incredibly sensitive to the atmosphere of streets and places. As I made my way through the dark streets looking for Roland Street in the fog—it was mist rather than fog, a white, transparent, milky mist, typical of November—I was so overcome by this sense of spiritual abandonment I was almost seasick.","“I went because my curiosity got the better of me. What man could resist the alluring, melodious voice of a female over the telephone? If women ever caught on to how the male mind worked, they would always request things anonymously over the telephone. The address on Roland Street is in that seedy section of London behind Tottenham Court Road, north of Soho, where artist types and prostitutes live, the ones who can’t even afford Soho or Bloomsbury. I don’t know for certain, but I presume this district of London is home to esoteric religions, Gnostics, psychics and other sham spiritualists. The entire neighbourhood suggests spiritual decadence. Well, that’s where I had to go. I should warn you I’m ridiculously sensitive to the atmosphere created by certain streets and neighbourhoods. As I crossed the dark streets looking for Roland Street in the fog, more of a seedy mist really, but still a milk-white November mist, I was so overcome by a sense of decay that I was on the verge of something akin to seasickness."
"- Az nem lehet - mondta a lány sértődötten. - A francia úr mondta. Azt mondta, egy nagyon szép tehén van rajta, meg egy liba, meg egy macska.","""It can't be,"" she said indignantly. - The Frenchman said. He said he had a very nice cow and a goose and a cat on it.","“That’s impossible,” said the girl, somewhat offended. “The French gentleman said there was. He said there’s a wonderful cow in it, with a goose and a duck.”","“Why, that’s not possible,” said the girl, somewhat hurt. “The French gentleman said so. He said there was a lovely cow on it, and a goose and a cat.”"
"Pedig, úgy látszik, más megoldás csakugyan nem nyílt. Ha megfizeti adósságát Millicentnek, nem marad pénze, hogy továbbra is Rómában maradjon. Mélyen nyugtalanította az is, amit Tivadar apjukról írt. Tudta, hogy Tivadar nem túloz, apja depresszióra hajlamos, és az egész ügy, amelyben anyagi, társadalmi és emocionális kellemetlenségek oly bonyolultan láncolódnak össze, nagyon is alkalmas arra, hogy apja lelki békéjét megzavarja. Ha más nem volna, magában az is, hogy kedvenc fia ilyen lehetetlenül viselkedett. Csakugyan haza kell mennie, hogy legalább ezt jóvátegye, hogy megokolja apja előtt, mennyire nem tehetett mást, Erzsi érdekében sem. Meg kell mutatnia, hogy nem szökevény, vállalja tettét, amint gentlemanhez illik.","Yet, no other solution seems to have opened up. If you pay your debt to Millicent, you won’t have any money left to stay in Rome. He was also deeply disturbed by what Tivadar had written about their father. He knew that Tivadar was not exaggerating, that his father was prone to depression, and that the whole affair in which material, social, and emotional inconveniences were so intricately intertwined was very apt to disturb his father's peace of mind. If nothing else, it was in himself that his favorite son behaved so impossibly. He really had to go home to at least make up for that, to justify to his father how much he couldn't do anything, not for Erzsi's sake. He must show that he is not a fugitive, he will take action as soon as he fits a gentleman.","But, it seemed, there really was no alternative. If he paid back the loan from Millicent there would be nothing left for him to live on in Rome. What also disturbed him deeply was what Tivadar had said about his father. He knew that Tivadar was not exaggerating. His father had a tendency to depression, and the whole disaster, in which material, social and emotional problems were linked together in such a complicated way, was just the sort of thing to destroy his peace of mind. If the other elements failed to achieve this, it was enough in itself that his favourite son had behaved so impossibly. He really would have to go home, if only to make amends for this, to explain to his father that he simply could not have done other than he did, not even for Erzsi’s good. He needed to show that he was not a runaway, that he took full responsibility for his action, as a gentleman should.","But the harsh reality was that he’d run out of options. If he paid back the loan to Millicent, he’d be left with no money to stay on in Rome. And he was rather upset about what Tivadar had written about his father. Tivadar had not exaggerated, his father tended toward depression, and this whole financial, social, emotional mess hitting him all at once affected his father’s mental health. It was enough that his favourite son behaved so disgracefully. Mihály felt that he ought to go home, if for no other reason than to set things right, to explain to his father that there was nothing else he could’ve done, not even in Erzsi’s interests. He had to show he was not a fugitive, but a gentleman who’d take full responsibility for what he’s done."

"Akármikor be lehetett hozzájuk állítani, az ember sosem zavarta őket, tovább folytatták a maguk életét, mintha az ember ott se lenne. Éjszaka is szívesen látták az embert, de gimnazista koromban éjjel nem mehettem hozzájuk az otthoni fegyelem miatt, legfeljebb színház után, rövid időre - s folyton arról ábrándoztam, hogy milyen jó volna náluk aludni. Érettségi után gyakran maradtam ott éjszakára.","Whenever they could be set up, they never bothered them, they continued their lives as if they weren’t even there. They liked to see people at night, but when I was in high school, I couldn't go to them at night because of home discipline, at most after a theater, for a short time - and I kept dreaming about how good it would be to sleep with them. After graduation, I often stayed there for the night.","“One could call on them at any time. Visitors never bothered them. They just carried on with their own lives as if no-one else was present.

But while I was still at school I couldn’t visit them at night because of family rules: at the very most, after the theatre and then very briefly, and I dreamed constantly about how wonderful it would be to sleep at their house. Once I’d left school, I often spent the night there.","“When visitors did show up at their house, the two never allowed themselves to be disturbed, but continued whatever they were doing, as if nobody were there. One was welcomed all hours of the night. I myself couldn’t pay them nightly visits because of my curfew, the rare exception being after the theatre and only for a short time. I would fantasize about how great it would be to sleep there. But after I graduated I frequently spent the night."

Don’t let scampi, frutti di mare or other water monster eat you because you get a rash from it.","4 Don’t let her eat scampi, frutti di mare, or any other disgusting sea creature—they give her a rash.","4.

"Valahonnan a padló rejtelmei közül egy nagy csomagot vett elő, az íróasztalról számos tárgyat és kéziratot az asztal alá helyezett, letette a csomagot és kibontotta. Rengeteg nyers olasz sonka és szalámi és kenyér bukkant elő.","Somewhere out of the mysteries of the floor, he took out a large package, placed a number of objects and manuscripts from the desk under the table, put the package down, and unpacked it. Lots of raw Italian ham and salami and bread emerged.","From somewhere among the arcana of the floor he produced a large package, removed several objects and papers from the desk and placed them under it, put the package down and opened it. A mass of raw Italian ham, salami and bread spilt out into view.","From the baffling clutter on the floor, he produced a large package, swept his desk clear of various objects and manuscripts, laid down the package, and opened it. Mounds of Italian raw ham, salami, bread."
"Először is az anyagiak. Mihály a „gazdasági szükségszerűséget” mérhetetlenül tisztelte. Talán éppen azért, mert neki oly kevés érzéke volt hozzá. Ha valaki azt mondta neki: „anyagi okok arra kényszerítenek, hogy így meg így cselekedjem”, Mihály mindjárt elhallgatott, és minden aljasságot igazolva látott. Éppen ezért rendkívül nyugtalanította a dolognak az az aspektusa, ami előtte már régebben is felmerült, de Erzsi mindig tréfásan elütötte, hogy ti. Erzsi anyagilag nagyon rosszul járt vele, azelőtt egy gazdag ember felesége volt, most pedig egy polgári közepesé - ez előbb-utóbb meg fogja bosszulni magát, amit a józan és anyagiakban oly otthonos Pataki Zoltán máris tisztán lát.","First, the material ones. Michael respected the “economic necessity” immeasurably. Maybe just because he had so little sense of it. When someone said to him, “I am compelled to do so for material reasons,” Michael immediately fell silent and saw all the meanness. That's why he was extremely worried about the aspect of the thing that had arisen before, but Erzsi was always jokingly struck that you were. Erzsi did very badly for him financially, before he was the wife of a rich man, and now he is a bourgeois medium - this will sooner or later get revenge, which Zoltán Pataki, who is so sober and financially homely, already sees clearly.","First of all, the financial considerations. Mihály had an extreme respect for ‘economic necessity.’ Perhaps precisely because he had so little talent for it. If someone said to him, “material considerations compel you to this or that course of action,” he would immediately fall silent, and see the justification for every form of baseness. For just that reason, this aspect of the matter made him particularly uneasy. It had arisen as an issue long before the present, but Erzsi had always treated it as a joke. From a materialistic point of view she had made a very poor choice in him. Previously married to a man of substance, now the wife of a modest bourgeois—this sooner or later was bound to make itself felt, as the cool-headed and worldly Zoltán Pataki had already seen so clearly.","Starting with the matter of his finances. Mihály had infinite respect for economic necessity. Perhaps for the very reason that he had no real grip on it. If someone told him that “in the name of economic necessity, such and such had to be done”, Mihály was immediately silenced, allowing all sorts of shady actions to be justified. This aspect of his behaviour made him rather uneasy, and he had voiced his concern earlier, only to have Erzsi pass it off as laughable. When it came to money, he was a very poor match for Erzsi, the former wife of a rich man, and now she was doomed to the middle-class. And sooner or later she would regret it — as the clear-headed and financially clever Zoltán Pataki indicated all too clearly."
1,1,XIII,Chapter 13
"Egy este színházban voltak, és mikor utána visszaérkeztek a hotel halljába, Mihály úgy érezte, hogy nagyon szívesen meginna még valamit. Nem tudta pontosan, hogy mit, még leginkább valami édes borra vágyódott, eszébe jutott a szamoszi bor különös, klasszikus íze, és hogy milyen gyakran kóstolgatta Párizsban, a Rue des Petits Champs 7. szám alatt egy kis borkereskedésben, és arra gondolt, hogy Velence félig-meddig már Görögország, itt bizonyára lehet szamoszi bort kapni vagy esetleg mavrodaphnét, mert az olasz borokkal még nem volt tisztában. Megkérte Erzsit, menjen fel egyedül, majd mindjárt utánajön, csak iszik valamit - igazán csak egy pohárral -, mondta komolykodva, mert Erzsi, ugyancsak álkomolysággal, mértékletességre intette, mint fiatalasszonyhoz illik.","They were in a theater one night, and when they returned to the hotel lobby after that, Mihály felt very happy to drink something else. He did not know exactly what, most of all, he longed for some sweet wine, he remembered the peculiar, classic taste of Samos wine and how often he tasted it in a small wine shop on Rue des Petits Champs in Paris, and he thought that Venice as long as Greece, you can probably get Samos wine or maybe mavrodaphne here, because you weren't aware of Italian wines yet. He asked Erzs to go up alone and then he would come after him, just drinking something - really only with a glass - he said seriously, because Erzsi, also with pessimism, motioned for moderation as befits a young woman.","One evening, returning to their hotel after the theatre, Mihály felt he somehow needed another drink. Quite what of he wasn’t yet sure, but he rather hankered after some sort of sweet wine and, remembering the somewhat special, classical, taste of Samian, and the many times he had tried it in Paris, in the little wine merchant’s at number seven rue des Petits Champs, he reasoned that, Venice being effectively Greece, here surely he might find some Samian, or perhaps Mavrodaphne, since he wasn’t yet quite au fait with the wines of Italy. He begged Erzsi to go up without him. He would follow straightaway. It would be just a quick drink, “really, just a glass” he solemnly insisted as she, with the same mock-seriousness, made a gesture urging moderation, as befits the young bride.","After the theatre one evening, once they returned to their hotel lobby, Mihály felt like he could use another drink. He didn’t know what exactly, a sweet wine, perhaps the distinctly classic taste of Greek Samian wine he’d often sampled in Paris in a little wine shop at the Rue des Petits Champs 7. Venice was close enough to Greece, and he could probably get some Samian wine or at least Mavrodafni. He wasn’t familiar yet with Italian wines. He asked Erzsi to go on up by herself; he just needed to drink something and would be right up, really nothing more than a glassful, he told her in earnest. Erzsi affected a young wife’s concern and hinted at moderation."
"Aznap meglehetősen meleg volt; egész nap fagylaltot ettek és beszélgettek. Mihályban megvolt az a képesség, ami az angol diplomatákat oly félelmessé teszi kartársaik szemében: hogy szükség esetén rendkívül buta tudott lenni. Millicent nem vett észre semmi észbeli nívókülönbséget kettejük közt, sőt művészettörténeti tudása révén fölényben érezte magát, és ez nagyon jólesett neki.","It was quite hot that day; they ate and talked about ice cream all day. Michael had the ability to make English diplomats so frightening in the eyes of their comrades: that he could be extremely stupid when needed. Millicent did not notice any difference in mental level between the two of them, and even felt superior in her knowledge of art history, and it was very good for her.","That day was rather hot. They spent the whole of it eating ice-cream and talking. Mihály had the skill that makes English diplomats so feared in their profession: he knew how to be extremely dim when the need arose. Millicent noticed nothing of the intellectual distance between them. Indeed, she felt herself at an advantage because of her art history studies, and this rather flattered her.","It was especially hot that day. They spent most of it chatting, eating ice cream. Like any esteemed English diplomat, Mihály had the ability, in times of need, to appear astonishingly stupid. Millicent was not bothered by the intellectual disparity between them; on the contrary, her expertise in art history gave her a sense of superiority, and this made her feel rather good."
"Lassanként a takarékosság lett legfőbb foglalkozása. Eszébe jutott, hogy mindig is nagy hajlamot érzett a takarékosságra. Mint gyermek, az ajándékba kapott csokoládébonbonokat rendszerint addig tette félre, amíg megpenészedtek, szép ruháit is mindig eldugta, és kisasszonyai néha a legmegdöbbentőbb helyeken fedeztek fel, elpiszkolódva és tönkremenve, egy selyemsált, egy pár finom harisnyát, egy drága kesztyűt. Később az élet nem engedte meg, hogy Erzsi kiélje takarékossági szenvedélyét. Mint fiatal lánynak reprezentálnia kellett apja mellett, sőt könnyelműnek kellett lennie, hogy emelje apja hitelét. Zoltán feleségének pedig álmodni sem lehetett takarékosságról. Ha egyszer lemondott egy drága cipőről, Zoltán másnap három pár még drágábbal lepte meg. Zoltán „nagyvonalú ember volt”, a művészetet és művésznőket is pártfogolta, és feltétlenül ragaszkodott ahhoz, hogy feleségét mindennel elhalmozza, részben lelkiismerete megnyugtatására is; és ezenközben Erzsi legfőbb szenvedélye, a takarékosság, kielégítetlen maradt.","Gradually, thrift became his main occupation. He remembered that he had always felt a great tendency to save. As a child, he usually set aside the chocolate chocolates he received as a gift until he was moldy, he always hid his beautiful clothes, and his little ones sometimes discovered in the most shocking places, dirty and ruined, a silk scarf, a pair of delicate stockings, an expensive glove. Later, life did not allow Erzsi to live out her passion for thrift. As a young girl, she had to represent her father and even be light-hearted to raise her father’s credit. And Zoltán's wife could not even dream of thrift. Once he gave up an expensive shoe, the next day Zoltán surprised him with three more expensive ones. Zoltán was a “generous man”, he also patronized art and women, and he insisted on accumulating his wife with everything, partly to reassure his conscience; and meanwhile Erzsi's main passion, thrift, remained unsatisfied.","By degrees the saving of money became her chief preoccupation. She realised she had always had a strong inclination to save. As a child, chocolate bonbons given to her as presents would usually be stored away until they went mouldy. She hid her best clothes, any length of silk, pair of fine stockings or expensive gloves, and the maids would find them in the most surprising places, grubby and ruined. Her later life did not permit any expression of this economising passion. As a young girl she had to be on show beside her father, and conspicuous extravagance was required if she was to do him credit. And as Zoltán’s wife she could not possibly have dreamed of saving money. If she declined an expensive pair of shoes, Zoltán would surprise her the following day with three even more expensive pairs. Zoltán was a ‘generous’ man. He patronised art and artists (female), and made an absolute point of showering largesse on their husbands, partly to ease his sense of guilt. And in all this Erzsi’s ruling passion, the saving of money, remained unexpressed.","Gradually her obsession with saving money became her chief occupation. Even in her childhood she’d had a tendency for saving things, when she’d squirrel away gifts like chocolate bonbons until they turned mouldy. Later she’d hide articles of her finest clothing the maids would have to unearth from the most unseemly places, a dirty and ruined crepe-de-chine scarf here, a pair of silk stockings there, expensive gloves somewhere else. Life didn’t always permit Erzsi to give full vent to her passion for thrift. As a young girl she’d often had to be on display as a trophy of spoiled extravagance beside her father who encouraged her to be a spendthrift and boost his prestige. And as Zoltán’s wife she couldn’t have dreamed of economizing, even remotely. If she’d refused a pair of expensive shoes, the next day Zoltán would surprise her with three pairs even more expensive. Zoltán had a reputation to uphold as a “big spender,” a patron of the arts and of female artists, and he’d insisted on showering his wife with everything, and at the same time soothe his guilty conscience. Meanwhile, Erzsi’s chief obsession, economising, remained unfulfilled. Erzsi’s passion for economizing remained unsatisfied."
"- Miért árultál el? - kérdezte Évától. Éva nagyon szégyellte magát, és nem felelt.",- Why did you tell me? she asked Eva. Eve was very ashamed of herself and didn't answer.,“‘Why did you give me away?’ he asked Éva. She was covered in shame and didn’t reply.,“‘Why did you betray me?’ he asked Éva. She looked as if she were ashamed and didn’t answer.
"- De itt legalább nem hallom. Meg aztán... nem, nem mehetek haza Zoltán miatt sem.","- But at least I can't hear you here. And then ... no, I can't go home because of Zoltán either.","“But at least here I don’t have to listen. And then … no, no, I can’t go back, because of Zoltán.”",“At least here I don’t have to listen to it. And then… there’s Zoltán.”
"Akkor megint úrrá lett rajta egyszerre jólneveltsége, úrinő-volta, jó tanuló-volta, takarékossága, minden, ami elől menekült valaha. Nem, nem, nem meri... Az ijedtség erőssé és találékonnyá tette. Pillanatok alatt minden bútort odarángatott a be nem zárható ajtó elé, még a súlyos ágyat is megfogta, és sírva, könnyeit nyelve, odavonszolta azt is az ajtó elé. Azután kimerülten ráesett.","Then her well-being, her mistress, her good student, her frugality, everything she had ever escaped, took over again. No, no, he doesn't dare ... The fright made him strong and resourceful. In a moment, he dragged all the furniture to the door that could not be locked, grabbed even the heavy bed, and, crying and tearing his tears, dragged it to the door. Then he fell exhausted.","Suddenly it all enfolded her once again: her good upbringing, her character as genteel lady, as model pupil, her thrift, everything she had once fled. No, no, she did not dare … Fear lent her strength and cunning. Within seconds she had piled up every bit of furniture against the unlocked door. She even seized hold of the massive bed and, sobbing, gulping down her tears, dragged that too up to the door. Then she collapsed on to it, exhausted.","Suddenly the girl with the good upbringing took charge, the good student, Madame, thrifty Madame, everything she’d always longed to escape from. No, no, no, she did not dare. Fear was making her bold and resourceful. In seconds she’d lugged every piece of furniture in front of the unfastened door, taken even the heavy bed, which she dragged, between sobs, to the door. And, exhausted, she fell on it."
"Egy ideig még feküdt, egyre növekvő nyugtalanságban, azután megpróbált felkelni. De a mozdulatok nehezére estek, és az érverés a fejébe nyilallt. Inkább fekve maradt. Fülelt. Szeme megszokta a sötétséget és füle a hallgatást. Ezer kis zajt, furcsa, közeli, olasz zajt hallott mindenfelé. A ház köröskörül ébren volt. Az ajtó alól halvány világosság ugrott be.","He lay still for a while, in growing unrest, then tried to get up. But the movements fell hard, and the beating shot in his head. He preferred to lie down. He listened. His eyes were accustomed to the darkness and his ears were listening. He heard a thousand little noises, a strange, near-Italian noise everywhere. The house was awake all around. A faint light jumped in from under the door.","He remained prostrate for a while, in steadily increasing restlessness, then tried to get up. But his movements ran into difficulty, and the blood throbbed painfully in his head. Better to stay lying down. He listened intently. His eyes became used to the darkness and his ears to the silence. A thousand little noises, strange, nearby, distinctly Italian sounds, could be heard all around. The house was more or less awake. A dim light came in from under the door.","For a while he lay still, but as his anxiety got the better of him, he tried getting up. But blood hammered in his head at the slightest movement. He lay back down. He listened intently. His eyes got used to the darkness, and his sense of hearing sharpened. He heard a thousand tiny voices, strange and Italian, and very near. Every crevice and corner lay awake, seething. A sliver of light glared at him from under the door."
- Amiatt. Már a pályaudvaron várna virágcsokorral.,- Because of that. He would be waiting at the train station with a bouquet of flowers.,“Because of him. He’d be waiting at the station with bunches of flowers.”,"“Yes, him. He’d be at the train station with a bouquet of flowers.”"
"- Nem is tudom. Hazamenni nincs kedvem, ezer és egy okból, és nincs is kedvem egyedül lenni.","- I do not know. I don’t feel like going home, for a thousand and one reasons, and I don’t even feel like being alone.","“I don’t know. I don’t want to go home, for a thousand and one reasons, and I really don’t want to be alone.”",“I don’t know. I don’t want to go home for a thousand and one reasons. And I don’t want to be alone.”
"Mihály csakugyan így is gondolta. Megrendítette az Erzsiből feléje áramló asszonyi melegség, hálás és gyermekien boldog volt.","Michael really thought so. She was shaken by the feminine warmth flowing towards her from Ersi, grateful and childishly happy.","He really thought that. He had been stunned by the womanly warmth in which she bathed him, and was gratefully, childishly happy.",Mihály said this sincerely. He was touched by Erzsi’s nurturing warmth which made him so happy and secure that all he felt was eternal gratitude.
"- De hát, uram, maga akkor az emberiség ellensége - mondta Sári. - Terjeszti a fehér mérget. Tönkreteszi szegény kínaiak százezreinek az életét. És még csodálkozik, hogy minden becsületes ember összefog maga ellen.","""But, sir, you are the enemy of mankind,"" Sari said. - Spreads white poison. It is ruining the lives of hundreds of thousands of poor Chinese. And it is even more surprising that all honest people come together against themselves.","“But that, sir, makes you a public enemy,” declared Sári. “You’re peddling white poison. You’re destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of destitute Chinese. And then you’re surprised that all thinking people are united against you.”","“Excuse me,” said Sári, “but doesn’t that make you a threat to mankind? Spreading the white pestilence. Ruining the poor Chinese by the hundreds of thousands. And then you wonder why every decent person unites against you?”"
"- Jól kezded - mondta Mihály. De titokban egy kicsit örült, hogy Erzsi csak hülyének tartja és nem gazembernek.","""You're starting well,"" Michael said. But he was a little happy that Erzsi thought he was just stupid and not a villain.","“That’s a good start,” said Mihály. But he was secretly rather pleased that she considered him a fool and not a villain.","“That’s a good start,” said Mihály. Actually he was a little glad that Erzsi considered him to be juvenile and not a crook."
"- Mégis, hát mi lesz velem? Mit csináljak holnap és holnapután? Tőled vártam a csodálatos feleletet. Babonásan bíztam abban, hogy tanácsot fogsz adni. Menjek haza Pestre, mint a tékozló fiú, vagy kezdjek új életet, menjek el munkásnak? hiszen kitanultam a mesterséget, szakmunkás is lehetnék. Ne hagyj magamra, úgyis olyan nagyon egyedül vagyok. Mit tegyek?","- Still, what about me? What should I do tomorrow and the day after tomorrow? I was expecting a wonderful answer from you. I superstitiously trusted that you would give me advice. Should I go home to Pest as a prodigal son, or should I start a new life, go as a worker? since I learned the craft, I could also be a skilled worker. Don't leave me alone, I'm so alone anyway. What to do?","“But what will become of me? What shall I do tomorrow, and the day after? I expected a miraculous answer from you. I superstitiously believed that you would give me advice. Should I go back to Budapest, like the Prodigal Son, or start a new life, as a worker? Because I have done an apprenticeship. I’ve got a trade. It would be possible. Don’t leave me to myself. I’m so alone already. What shall I do?”","“But what will become of me? What am I to do tomorrow, and the day after that? I expected a miracle from you. My blind trust in whatever advice you’d give verged on superstition. Should I go back to Budapest, like the Prodigal Son, or start a new life, take a job somewhere? I learned the tools of the trade. I could be a skilled labourer. Don’t let me do this by myself. I’m very much alone. What should I do?”"
"Mihály levetette kalapját, és odament, hogy közelről lássa a szertartást. A halottkapu nyitva volt. Be lehetett látni a házba, egy sötét terembe, amelyben a ravatal állt. Papok és ministránsok álltak füstölőkkel a koporsó körül és énekeltek. Majd nemsokára felemelték a koporsót, és a halottkapun át kiadták az utcára, a csuklyások a vállukra emelték.","Michael took off his hat and went over to see the ceremony up close. The dead gate was open. It was possible to see the house, a dark room in which the coffin stood. Priests and ministers stood with incense around the coffin and sang. Then soon the coffin was lifted and released into the street through the dead gate, the hooded people lifting it over their shoulders.","Mihály removed his hat and edged closer for a better view of the ceremony. The door of the dead stood open. Through it he could see into the house, into a dark room containing the bier. Priests and their assistants stood around the coffin, chanting and swinging censers. After a few minutes they lifted it up and passed it through the door of the dead into the street, where the hooded relatives hoisted it on to their shoulders.","Mihály took off his hat and crept near for a closer view of the service. The door of the dead was open wide enough for him to see inside the darkened room where the bier holding the coffin stood. Chanting priests and altar boys dangled smoking incense around the coffin. Before long, they lifted the coffin and carried it through the door of the dead into the street where hooded pallbearers propped it on their shoulders."
"Erre nem a lemondó gesztus következett, hanem fejébe szaladt a vér és: - Meghalni, meghalni, más megoldás nincsen...","This was not followed by a resignation gesture, but blood ran through his head and: - To die, to die, there is no other solution ...","This time what followed was not the gesture of resignation, but a rush of blood to the head and: “Death, death, there’s nothing else for it … ”","Instead of his usual gesture of resignation, something else happened. Hot blood rushed to his head. Die, die, there was nothing for him to do but die."
"Megint kiszakította magát a fasiszta kezéből, aki közben megint megragadta volt, felugrott az induló vonatra, és becsapta maga mögött az ajtót.","He tore himself out of the fascist's hand again, grabbing him again, jumping on the departing train, and slamming the door behind him.","Once again he tore himself away from the man, who had renewed his grip, jumped onto the moving train, and slammed the door behind him.","The Fascist made another attempt to restrain him, and Mihály had to tear himself away again just in time to jump on the moving train and slam the door behind him."
"Egy kicsit kipihenem magam, és meggondolom, hogy mit is akarok, és akarom-e, amit akarok, és csak azután írok majd Évának. Mert helyzetem vele szemben kissé fonák, és ha elmondanám, hogy miért nem jöttem haza tegnap éjjel, talán el sem hinné, olyan ostoba dolog.","I’ll relax myself a little bit and think about what I want and want what I want, and only then will I write to Eve. Because my situation with him is a bit backsliding, and if I could tell you why I didn’t come home last night, you might not believe it, it’s such a stupid thing.","“I’ll rest for a bit, and think carefully about what I actually want, and whether I really want it; and only then will I write to Éva. Because my position with her is rather ridiculous, and if I were to tell her why I didn’t come home last night, perhaps she wouldn’t believe me, it’s all so stupid.”","First he’d rest up, then mull over what he wanted to do, and whether he really wanted to do it or not, and then and only then would he write Éva. His situation with her was a bit awkward, and were he to tell her why he didn’t come home last night, it would sound so bizarre that she’d never believe him."
- Kitűnő. Ravennában épp az ellenkezőjét mondta. Eléggé meg is sértett.,"- Excellent. In Ravenna, he said just the opposite. He was quite offended.",“Wonderful. In Ravenna you said exactly the opposite. I was pretty offended.”,“Really? I had just the opposite impression in Ravenna. I felt pretty insulted.”
"- De mondd, Mihály... oly nehéz elképzelni... évekig folyton együtt voltatok, és semmiféle ártatlan flört nem fejlődött ki közted és Ulpius Éva közt?","""But tell me, Michael ... it's so hard to imagine ... you've been together for years, and no innocent flirtation has developed between you and Eva Ulpius?""","“But tell me, Mihály … this is rather difficult to believe … you were with her for years on end, and there was never any question of an innocent flirtation between you and Éva Ulpius?”","“Really, Mihály, you expect me to believe that you and Éva Ulpius were together for years, and not one innocent flirtation?”"
"- Szörnyen szeretem a nőket - mondta Waldheim útközben. - Talán túlságosan is. Tudod, fiatal koromban nem jutottam annyit nőkhöz, mint kellett volna, és mint szerettem volna, részben mert fiatal korában az ember oly buta, és részben mert szigorú nevelésem tiltotta. Engem az anyám nevelt, aki egy pfarrernek a lánya, egy igazi birodalmi német pfarrernek; gyerekkoromban egyszer náluk voltam, és nem tudom már miért, megkérdeztem az öregúrtól, hogy ki volt Mozart. Der war ein Scheunepurzler, mondta, ami körülbelül annyit jelent, hogy bukfencekkel szórakoztatja a közönséget egy pajtában; ebbe a fogalomba foglalta össze az öreg a művészeket. És szóval, mostanában úgy érzem, hogy sose fogom pótolhatni azt, amit huszonöt éves koromig nőkben mulasztottam. De itt vagyunk. Hát várj meg, kérlek, rögtön jövök.","""I love women terribly,"" Waldheim said on the way. - Maybe too much. You know, when I was young, I didn’t get as many women as I should have, and as I wanted to, partly because I was so stupid at a young age and partly because my strict upbringing forbade it. I was raised by my mother, who is the daughter of a pfarrer, a real imperial German pfarrer; I was with them once as a child, and I don’t know why anymore, I asked the old man who Mozart was. Der war ein Scheunepurzler, he said, which is about to entertain the audience with somersaults in a barn; the old man summed up the artists in this concept. And so, lately, I feel like I’ll never be able to make up for what I missed in women until I was twenty-five. But here we are. Well wait, please, I'll be right back.","“I’m extremely fond of women,” Waldheim announced as they walked along. “Perhaps excessively. You know, when I was young I didn’t get my share of women as I wanted to, and as I should have, partly because when you’re young you’re so stupid, and partly because my strict upbringing forbade it. I was brought up by my mother, who was the daughter of a pfarrer, a real Imperial German parish priest. As a child I was once with them and for some reason I asked the old man who Mozart was. ‘Der war ein Scheunepurzler,’ he said, which means, more or less, someone who does somersaults in a barn to amuse the yokels. For the old man all artists fell into that category. So nowadays I feel that I can never do enough to make up for what I missed in the way of women when I was twenty-five. But here we are. Hang on a moment, won’t you. I shan’t be long.”","“I have a terrible weakness for women,” Waldheim said as they walked. “Too much so. You know, when I was young, I couldn’t get my hands on all the women I should’ve or would’ve liked to, partly because I was a witless idiot and partly because of my rigid upbringing. My mother brought me up, daughter of a pastor, a real German pastor in Austria-Hungary. As a boy, I’d been over to my grandfather’s house, and I no longer know why, but I’d asked the old gentleman who Mozart was. ‘Der war ein Scheunepurzler,’ he said, which roughly means that he was a show-off performing somersaults for a barnful of idiots. This pretty much summed up the old man’s idea of artists. Anyhow, lately I feel I’ll never be able to make up for all the women I missed out on my first twenty-five years. All right, we’re here. Please wait for me, I’ll be back in no time.”"
"A házaspár ott maradt, és sokáig hallgatott. Erzsi bosszankodott, és egyúttal komikusnak is találta a helyzetet. Osztálytársak, ha találkoznak... Úgy látszik, Mihályt ezek a diákkori dolgok egészen mélyen érintik. Meg kellene egyszer kérdezni, ki volt ez az Ervin és ez a Tamás... bár olyan ellenszenvesek. Erzsi általában nem szerette a fiatalokat és a félig készeket.","The couple stayed there and listened for a long time. Erzsi was annoyed and found the situation comical. Classmates, if they meet ... Michael seems to be deeply affected by these student things. One should ask once who this Ervin and this Thomas were ... though they are so disgusted. Erzsi usually did not like young and semi-finished.","The married couple remained where they were, and for a long time did not speak. Erzsi was furious, and at the same time found the situation rather ridiculous. “When old classmates meet,” she thought … “It seems Mihály was deeply affected by these old schoolboy doings. I suppose for once I’d better ask who this Ervin and this Tamás were, however ghastly they might be.” She had little patience with the young and immature.","The newlyweds stayed riveted to their seats, and for a long time nothing was said. Erzsi was seething, but at the same time found the situation rather farcical. Quite a reunion. It seems Mihály was still deeply affected by these silly schoolboy shenanigans. She ought to ask him just who Ervin and Tamás were… though they sounded like absolute bores. Erzsi was not particularly fond of adolescent males."

"Vacsora után egy előkelő dancingba mentek. Itt egyéb ismerősök csatlakoztak hozzájuk, nagy asztalnál ültek, és összevissza beszélgettek, amennyire a lárma engedte. Erzsi a perzsától messze került. Szepetneki János felkérte, és táncolni kezdtek.","After dinner they went to an upscale dance. Here other acquaintances joined them, sat at a large table, and conversed as far as the noise would allow. Erzsi was far from Persian. János Szepetneki asked and they started dancing.","After the meal they went to a fashionable dancing-place. Here they were joined by some other acquaintances. They sat round a large table and made conversation, in so far as the general din allowed. Erzsi kept her distance from the Persian. János Szepetneki asked her to join him, and they began to dance.","After supper they went to a fashionable cabaret. Here, they were joined by other acquaintances at a large table and conversed by fits and starts as the uproar allowed. Erzsi maintained a healthy distance from the Persian.

"Elvezette Mihályt az ospizióba. Ahhoz a mély megrendüléshez, amely Mihályon erőt vett, illett ez a félhomályos terem, amelybe évszázadok zarándokai álmodták bele szenvedésüket, vágyukat és reményüket valami csodálatos gyógyulásban. A fekvőhelyek nagy része üres volt, de két-három zarándok aludt a terem távolabbi részében.","He took Mihály to the ospision. To the deep shock that took hold of Michael was this dimly-filled room into which pilgrims of centuries had dreamed of their suffering, desire, and hope for some wonderful healing. Most of the beds were empty, but two or three pilgrims slept in the far part of the room.","He led Mihály to the hospice. Given the deep state of distress that gripped him there seemed a fitness in the semi-darkened hall in which pilgrims down the centuries had dreamed of miraculous cures for their sufferings, yearnings and dearest hopes. Almost all the bunks were empty, though two or three pilgrims were asleep at the further end.","He led Mihály to the ospizio, the guest hospice. The dim hall suited Mihály’s melancholy desperation. It was a place where for centuries pilgrims dreamed of their suffering, their longing, their hope for some miraculous cure. Most of the beds stood empty, but two or three pilgrims lay sleeping on the far side of the hall."

"Másnap hajnalban Mihály felébredt, felkelt, és kibámult az ablakon. Az ablak kinézett a városból, a hegyek felé. A toszkán tájon könnyű lilaszínű ködök úsztak, és az aranyszín lassan és bátortalanul készült elő a nappalra. És semmi sem volt, csak ez a lila-arany derengés, a távoli hegyek alatt.","The next morning, Michael woke up, got up, and stared out the window. The window looked out of the city towards the mountains. Light purple mists floated in the Tuscan countryside, and the golden color slowly and timidly prepared for the day. And there was nothing but this purple-gold twilight under the distant mountains.","The following day he woke at dawn, rose and stared out of the window. The window looked out from the city towards the hills. Slight, lilac-coloured clouds were sailing over the Tuscan landscape, and a tinge of gold slowly and timidly prepared for dawn. And nothing existed but lilac and the gold of first light over distant hills.","At dawn the next day Mihály woke, got up, and stared out the window overlooking the hills. Wisps of lilac-colored the Tuscan landscape, its golden highlights hedging coyly toward morning. Nothing had any existence but lilac and gilt-edged dawn under the distant hills."
"Erzsi meg is jelent, rendeltek, és Pataki igyekezett úgy viselkedni, mintha semmi sem történt volna köztük, sem házasság, sem válás. Két okos pesti, egy asszony meg egy férfi, ha Párizsban találkoznak. Bőven és ízletesen adta elő az újabb pesti pletykákat közös ismerőseikről. Erzsi figyelemmel hallgatta.","Erzsi appeared, they ordered, and Pataki tried to act as if nothing had happened between them, marriage or divorce. Two smart people from Pest, a woman and a man when they meet in Paris. He gave more and more delicious rumors about their common acquaintances in Pest. Erzsi listened intently.","Erzsi appeared. They ordered, and Pataki strove to behave as if nothing had happened between them: no marriage, no divorce. Two clever Budapesti, a man and a woman, happening to meet in Paris. He treated her to the latest gossip from home, full and fully spiced, concerning their close acquaintances. Erzsi listened attentively.","When Erzsi appeared and they ordered, Pataki went all-out to act as if nothing had happened between them, no marriage, no divorce. Just two mature adults from Budapest, a man and a woman, who happened to meet in Paris. With great aplomb he presented the latest morsels about their mutual friends in Budapest. Erzsi followed him attentively."
- Gondolod?,- You think?,“Do you really think so?”,“You really think so?”
"A kis vonat Norciába ment, fel a hegyek közé. Mikor kiszállt, már a Sibillini-hegyek álltak előtte, kétezer méternél magasabb ormaikkal és jobbra a Gran Sasso, Olaszország legmagasabb hegycsoportja.","The little train went to Norcia, up into the mountains. When he got out, the Sibillini Mountains were already in front of him, with their ridges higher than two thousand meters, and to the right was the highest mountain range in Gran Sasso, Italy.","The little train went up to Norcia, in the hills. When he disembarked the Sibilline mountains stretched out before him with their two-thousand-metre peaks. To the right lay the Gran Sasso, Italy’s highest range.","The little train steamed to Norcia among the mountains. When he got off, Monti Sibillini’s peaks, said to be higher than 6000 feet, spread before him, and to his right towered the Gran Sasso, Italy’s highest mountain range."
"Nagyon sokáig hallgattak. Mihály próbálta megérteni Ervint. Nem lehet másképp, bizonyára mindent kiirtott magából. Minthogy el kellett szakadnia mindenkitől, kiásta lelkéből még a gyökereket is, amelyekből az embert emberhez fűző érzések kicsírázhatnak. Most már nem fáj, de itt maradt ugaron, terméketlenül, kopáron, a hegyen... Megborzongott.","They listened for a very long time. Michael was trying to understand Ervin. There can be no other way, surely he has wiped everything out of himself. As he had to break away from everyone, he even dug out the roots from his soul, from which man's feelings to man could sprout. It doesn't hurt now, but he stayed here fallow, barren, barren, on the mountain ... He shivered.","There was a long silence between them. Mihály was trying to understand Ervin. It couldn’t be otherwise. He must have purged everything from himself. Since he had had to tear himself away from everyone, he had dug up from his soul the very roots of anything that might flower into those feelings that bind people together. Now there was no pain, but he lived on in this fallow, this barren, land, on the bare mountain … Mihály shuddered to think of it.","The palpable silence between them lingered. Mihály was trying to make sense of the new Ervin. There could be only one answer: he must’ve exorcised everything from himself. Knowing he had to tear himself away from everyone, he uprooted from his soul anyone he might conceivably be bound to. Ervin didn’t feel emotional pain anymore, but he’d exiled himself on this barren mountain, idle and unproductive. Mihály shuddered."
"Magában jól tudta, hogy Erzsinek most sem közömbös. Különben nem jött volna Erzsi Rómába. De úgy érezte, a lovagiasság azt követeli, hogy ne vegye észre, hogy Erzsi még mindig vonzódik hozzá. Egyébként a férfi-kényelmesség is azt követelte.","She knew for herself that Erzsi wasn't indifferent now either. Otherwise, Erzsi would not have come to Rome. But he felt the chivalry required him not to notice that Erzsi was still attracted to him. Anyway, male comfort also demanded it.","Deep down, he was well aware that Erzsi was not disinterested. Otherwise she would not have come to Rome. But he felt, and chivalry dictated, that he ought to ignore the fact (which his male ego would normally have insisted on) that she might still be attracted to him.",Deep down Mihály knew he still mattered to her. Otherwise she wouldn’t have come to Rome. His sense of gallantry dictated that he turn a blind eye to the fact that she was still attracted to him. His male pride insisted on it.
"Erzsi, köszönő mozdulattal, egy pillanatra rátette kezét a perzsáéra. Keze alatt a perzsa keze összehúzódott, és olyan lett, mint egy karom. Erzsi megijedt, és elhúzta kezét.","With a thankful gesture, Erzsi put her hand on the Persian for a moment. Under his hand, the Persian's hand contracted and became like an claw. Erzsi was scared and pulled her hand away.","Erzsi, in a gesture of thanks, placed her hand for a moment on the Persian’s. Beneath it he closed his, making it like a claw. She was alarmed, and withdrew hers.","Erzsi placed her hand on the Persian’s to thank him. Under her touch the Persian’s hand contracted into a claw. Frightened, Erzsi withdrew her hand."
"Millicent szorgalmasan, bár unatkozva, meg-meglátogatta. Estefelé benézett Ellesley, és együtt mentek el Mihálytól.","She visited Millicent diligently, though bored. In the evening, Ellesley looked in and they left Michael together.","Millicent visited him regularly and dutifully, though she seemed rather bored. She would call in on Ellesley towards evening, and they would also leave together after the visit.","A weary Millicent visited him dutifully. In the evening Ellesley looked in on him, and the two of them left together."
"Mihály itt elhallgatott, és tenyerébe hajtotta fejét. Aztán felkelt, és kibámult az ablakon a sötétbe. Majd visszajött, és szórakozott mosollyal simogatta Erzsi kezét.",Michael fell silent here and put his head in the palm of his hand. Then he got up and stared out the window into the darkness. Then he came back and stroked Erzsi's hand with an amused smile.,"Here Mihály fell silent and buried his head in his hands. After a while he got up and stared out of the window into the darkness. Then he came back, and, with an absent smile, stroked Erzsi’s hand.","Mihály suddenly fell silent and buried his head in his hands. Then he stood up, walked to the window and stared into the darkness. He shuffled back to Erzsi and with a vacant smile patted her hand."

"Mi volt ez a furcsa bűvölet és eksztázis, ami elfogta itt a sikátorok közt, miért érezte úgy magát, mint aki végre hazaérkezett? Talán a gyermek álmodhatott ilyesmiről - a gyermek, aki kertes villák lakója volt, de félt a tágas dolgoktól -, talán a kamasz akart élni olyan szűk helyen, ahol minden félnégyzetméternek külön értelme van, tíz lépés már határsértést jelent, évtizedek telnek el egy rozoga asztal mellett, és emberéletek egy karosszékben; de ez sem biztos.","What was this strange fascination and ecstasy that took him here among the alleys, why did he feel like he had finally come home? Maybe the child could have dreamed of something like this - the child who was a resident of garden villas but was afraid of spacious things - maybe the teenager wanted to live in a tight place where every half square meter makes sense, ten steps are a borderline beside, and human lives in an armchair; but that's not for sure either.","What was the strange attraction, the peculiar ecstasy, that seized him among the back-alleys? Why did it feel like finally coming home? Perhaps a child dreams of such places, the child raised in a gardened cottage who fears the open plain. Perhaps there is an adolescent longing to live in such a closed world, where every square foot has a private significance , ten paces infringe a boundary, decades are spent around a shabby table, whole lives in an armchair … But this is speculation.","What was this strange fascination, this feeling of bliss that caught up with him here among the alleys? Why did he feel as if he’d finally come home? Was it a dream a child dreams, a child in a fenced-in house who’s threatened by vast, open spaces? The adolescent who’d rather live in a place so cramped that every inch was significant, where ten feet could mean the violation of a frontier? Where decades could be spent behind a rickety desk, where one could sink his behind into a comfy chair as an entire life passes by? If only he could be certain…"
- Visszamegyek a szállodába. Az uraknak olyan megbeszélnivalóik vannak...,- I'm going back to the hotel. The gentlemen have something to discuss ...,"“I’m going back to the hotel. Your topics of conversation, gentlemen, are such that … ”","She got up from her seat and announced, “I’m going back to the hotel room. I’m sure you two have plenty to talk about.”"
"Ünnepi érzését hatalmas ünnepi étrend összeállításában és drága bor rendelésében fejezte ki. Erzsi ismerte Mihályt, tudta, hogy a nagy vacsora nagy hangulatot jelent, és igyekezett ő is felemelkedni a szituációhoz. A beszélgetést ügyesen úgy irányította, egy-két kérdést téve fel Firenze történetére vonatkozólag, hogy Mihály gondolatait történelmi irányba terelje, mert tudta, hogy Mihályt a történelmi asszociációk a bornál is jobban és ünnepélyesebben átlelkesítik, sőt ez az egyetlen dolog, ami Mihályt közönyéből kiragadja. Mihály csakugyan lelkes, színes és adataiban megbízhatatlan magyarázatokat adott, majd csillogó szemmel azt próbálta elemezni, mit jelent a számára, mennyi csodát és eksztázist, maga ez a szó: Toszkána. Mert ennek a földnek nincs egy darabja sem, amit történelmi hadseregek, császárok és francia királyok nagyszerű kosztümös csapatai ne tapostak volna, itt minden ösvény valami nagyon fontos helyre vezet, és Firenze egy utcájára több történelem esik, mint odahaza hét vármegyére.","He expressed his festive feeling by putting together a huge festive diet and ordering expensive wine. Erzsi knew Mihály, she knew that the big dinner meant a great atmosphere, and she tried to get up to the situation. He deftly directed the conversation by asking a question or two about the history of Florence to steer Michael's thoughts in a historical direction, because he knew that Michael was more and more solemnly inspired by historical associations than wine, and that was the only thing that snatched Michael out of his indifference. Michael was indeed enthusiastic, colorful, and unreliable in his data, and then, with sparkling eyes, he tried to analyze what miracles and ecstasy meant to him, the word itself: Tuscany. Because there is not a single piece of this land that would not have been trampled by the great costumed troops of historic armies, emperors, and French kings, here every path leads to something very important, and one street in Florence has more history than seven counties back home.","This sense of occasion he expressed by ordering a huge festive meal and calling for the most expensive wine. Erzsi knew Mihály. She knew that the fine meal signified a special mood, and she did her best to rise to the occasion. She skilfully directed the conversation, putting one or two questions bearing on the history of Florence, prodding him to think about such matters, because she knew that historical associations, together with wine, drew him out of his solemnity, and were in fact the only thing that could overcome his apathy. Mihály poured out enthusiastic, colourful, factually unreliable explanations, then with shining eyes tried to analyse the meaning for him, the wonder, the ecstasy of the mere word: Tuscany. “Because there is no part of this land that hasn’t been trodden by the armies of history. The Caesars, the gorgeously apparelled troops of the French kings, all passed this way. Here every pathway leads to some important site and one street in Florence holds more history than seven counties back home.”","His musings put him in an elated mood. An elated mood meant an extravagant dinner and expensive wine. Knowing Mihály, Erzsi understood that such a dinner also meant an impassioned air, and she strove to rise to the occasion. She cleverly steered the subject of their conversation toward his favourite subject by asking Mihály a question or two concerning historical Florence. She knew how historical associations could fire him up, even more than wine. Reliably, Mihály gushed with enthusiastic, colourful, and factually somewhat unreliable details as he probed with blazing eyes the mystery and rapture connected with the word Tuscany. “ Because,” he told her, “not an inch of ground here is left untrodden by history, by emperors, by the fabulously arrayed armies of French kings. Every byway leads toward a historic site, and a single street in Florence teems with more history than seven Hungarian counties back home.”"
"Sokáig csavargott a Gianicolón, a Tevere partján és a Trastevere sikátoraiban. Késő éjszaka volt, de az az olasz nyári éjszaka, amikor azért mindenfelé ébren van valaki, és zavartalanul kalapál vagy énekel - ez a nép nem ismeri az északi fajták álmosságát és megszentelt kábulati idejét -, és az ember időnként teljesen megokolatlan kisgyerekekbe botlik, akik éjszaka háromtól négyig golyóznak az utcán, vagy egy borbély hirtelen kinyitja a boltját, és fél négykor megborotvál néhány jókedvű vőlegényt.","He roamed the Gianicolo, the banks of the Tevere, and the alleys of Trastevere for a long time. It was late at night, but that Italian summer night is when someone is awake everywhere and is hammering or singing undisturbed - this people do not know the drowsiness and consecrated time of the northern races - and one sometimes stumbles upon completely unscrupulous little children who night they play ball on the street from three to four, or a barber suddenly opens his shop and shaves some cheerful groom at half past four.","He wandered for hours on the Gianicolo, along the bank of the Tiber and down the alleyways of the Trastevere. The night was late, but this was an Italian summer night, with people therefore awake on every side, hammering away or singing without embarrassment. This nation is quite innocent of northern notions of sleep as a time of consecrated stupor. At any moment you might stumble without rhyme or reason upon small children playing marbles in the street between three and four in the morning, or a barber will suddenly open his shop at three-thirty to shave a few merry bridegrooms.","Mihály spent a long time wandering on the Gianicolo, on the banks of the Tiber, in the alleys of Trastevere. The hours trickled late into night, the kind of Italian summer night where just about everywhere he went, someone was awake, hammering away happily or singing. These people didn’t seem to be familiar with the sleep pattern of the northern races and that hallowed time-clock known as drowsiness. Here, it wasn’t so unusual to stumble into children playing marbles on the street from three to four in the morning, or for a barber to suddenly open his shop at three-thirty to shave some jolly groom."

"- Nem lehet csodálni - mondta Mihály. - Ez a város hullaszagú. Ravenna dekadens város, több mint ezer év óta állandóan hanyatlik. A baedeker is mondja.

"A menet elindult a koporsóval, nyomában a pap és a gyászmenet. Mihály is beállt a végére, és levett kalappal ballagott a távoli camposanto felé, fel a hegyoldalra.

"Mind a kettőnkre nézve végzetesen nagy jelentősége volt annak, hogy a mérget Évától kaptuk.

Meg is történt.","For both of us, it was fatal that we got the poison from Eve. It also belonged to our game, to those sick games that we have been forced to modify heavily since Ervin and John joined. Ecstasy has always been that we die by or for Eve. That Eve had given me the poison, she was finally convinced that I had to take it. It happened.","“For both of us it was fatally significant that the poison came from Éva. This was all part of the world of our dramatics, those sick little plays which we had had to change so much after Ervin and János arrived. The thrill was always in the fact that we died for Éva, or because of her. The fact that she had provided the poison finally convinced me that I should take it. And that’s what happened.","“Getting the poison from Éva was fatally significant for both of us. This also belonged to our game playing. Our games had become nuanced with a darker twist, once Ervin and János joined our group. Dying through Éva or for Éva had always been the real source of our ecstasy. The fact that Éva provided the morphine was what finally convinced me that I should take it. And I did."
"Minden más körülmények közt valami detektívregényszerű dolog jutott volna eszembe, hiszen annyit olvashat az ember idegenekről, akik Londonban nyom nélkül eltűntek, és az én történetem szabályosan úgy kezdődött, mint ahogy az ember ilyen eltűnési históriák kezdetét elképzeli. Mondom, a természetes az lett volna, hogy megijedek, bűntényt sejtek, és védekező attitűdbe helyezkedem. De nem ezt tettem. Mozdulatlanul, megdermedve ülve maradtam. Mert, uram, az a szem ismerős volt...","Under all other circumstances, something of a detective novel would have occurred to me, as you can read so much about the aliens who disappeared without a trace in London, and my story began correctly as one imagines the beginning of such disappearance stories. I say, it would have been natural for me to be scared, to suspect a crime, and to take a defensive attitude. But that's not what I did. I remained motionless, frozen. Because, sir, that eye was familiar ...","“In any other circumstances it would have seemed to me like something out of a detective novel. You read so much about foreigners vanishing in London without trace, and this seemed just the sort of start you would imagine for such a story. I tell you, the natural thing would have been for me to panic, suspect criminal intent, and put myself in a defensive posture. But I didn’t. I just sat there, stock-still, frozen with terror. Because, you see, I recognised the eye.”","“The whole situation was surreal like a scene from one of those popular detective novels in which foreigners in London seem to vanish into thin air. My predicament had all the trappings of a first chapter — at least the way I imagined it. What I’m trying to say is that the natural thing would’ve been for me to lose my nerve, suspect foul play, and look for ways to defend myself. Well, I didn’t. I simply remained sitting, petrified, still as a statue. Because, my friend, I recognized that eye.”"

"Ulpius Tamásék fent laktak, egy nagyon öreg és rozzant házban. De csak kívülről volt a ház öreg és rozzant, belülről az is nagyon szép és lakályos volt, mint ezek az öreg olasz hotelek. Bár sok tekintetben kísérteties is volt nagy szobáival és műtárgyaival, olyan volt, mint egy múzeum. Mert Ulpius Tamás apja archeológus volt és múzeumigazgató. A nagyapja pedig valamikor órás volt, a boltja régebben ott volt abban a házban. Most már csak magánszorgalomból játszadozott nagyon régi órákkal és mindenféle különös óraműves játékszerekkel, amit maga talált fel.","Tamás Ulpius lived upstairs in a very old and dilapidated house. But only the outside of the house was old and ruined, inside it was also very nice and cozy like these old Italian hotels.

And his grandfather was once an hour old, his shop used to be there in that house. Now he was only playing with very old watches and all sorts of special watchmaking toys that he invented himself out of private diligence.","“Tamás’s family lived in the upstairs part of a very old and run-down house.

The grandfather had been a clockmaker—his shop had been in the house. Now he just tinkered for his own amusement with antique clocks and all sorts of weird clockwork toys of his own invention.","“The Ulpius family lived on the second floor in an old, ramshackle mansion. But it only looked that way on the outside. The inside was quite elegant and homey. Like these old Italian hotel rooms.

And his grandfather a clockmaker, ages ago when his store occupied the ground floor of the house.

"Erzsi, mikor megkapta a sürgönyt, amelyet Mihály a kis fasiszta útján adott fel, nem maradt tovább Rómában. Hazamenni nem akart, mert nem tudta, hogy adja elő Pesten házassága történetét. Bizonyos földrajzi gravitációt követve, ő is Párizsba utazott, mint azok az emberek szoktak, akik teljesen reménytelenül új életet akarnak kezdeni.","Erzsi, when he received the urgency that Michael had given up on the path of the little fascist, did not stay in Rome. He did not want to go home because he did not know how to tell the story of his marriage in Pest. Following a certain geographical gravity, he also traveled to Paris, as is the custom for people who want to start a new life completely hopelessly.","WHEN ERZSI received the telegram Mihály had sent via the little fascista she did not linger in Rome.

Nor did she want to go back to Budapest, since she didn’t quite know how to explain away her marriage.

"Mihelyt ágyban volt, az alternatíva megint teljes kínzóságában állt előtte. Erzsi Párizsban; vagy egyedül van, rettenetesen egyedül, talán nem is eszik rendesen, ki tudja, milyen gyalázatos kis prix-fixes helyekre jár - vagy pedig nincs egyedül. Ezt a gondolatot nem lehetett elviselni. Mihályt valahogy már megszokta. Furcsa módon Mihályt képtelen volt komolyan venni, annak dacára, hogy csakugyan megszöktette Erzsit. Mihály nem számít. Mihály nem ember. A tudata mélyén meg volt győződve, hogy egyszer még valamiképp kiderül, hogy nem is... Erzsinek és Mihálynak esetleg viszonyuk volt, házaséletet éltek, de mégsem tartoztak úgy össze, mint férfi és nő. Azt Mihályról nem lehet elképzelni. De most Párizsban... az ismeretlen férfi... az ismeretlen férfi százszor gyötrőbb minden ismerős csábítónál. Nem, ezt nem lehet kibírni.","As soon as he was in bed, the alternative was again in complete torment. Erzsi in Paris; or he’s alone, terribly alone, maybe he’s not eating properly, who knows what disgraceful little prix-fixes he’s going to - or he’s not alone. This idea could not be tolerated. Michael was somehow used to it. Strangely, Michael was unable to take him seriously, despite the fact that he had escaped Erzsi. Michael doesn't matter. Michael is not a man. Deep in his consciousness, he was convinced that one day it would turn out that he didn't ... Ersi and Mihály might have had an affair, they were married, but they didn't belong together like men and women. It is impossible to imagine Michael. But now in Paris ... the unknown man ... the unknown man is a hundred times more excruciating than any familiar seductress. No, that can't be tolerated.","As soon as he was in bed the alternative again stood before him in all its misery. Erzsi in Paris: either she was alone, horribly alone, perhaps not eating properly (who knows what ghastly little prix-fixe places she was going to); or indeed she was not alone. That thought was not to be borne. Mihály he had somehow got used to. For some odd reason he was unable to take Mihály seriously, even though he had actually run off with her. Mihály didn’t count. Mihály wasn’t human. Deep in his consciousness lurked the conviction that one day, somehow, it would transpire that no such person existed … his affair with Erzsi had been a chance thing, they had lived in a marriage but had never had a real relationship, man and woman. That was something he could not imagine of Mihály. But now, in Paris … the unknown man … the unknown man was a hundred times more disturbing than any familiar seducer. No, the thought could not be endured.","Once in bed, his options floated before his eyes again in their agonizing pageantry: Erzsi in Paris. Either alone, horribly alone, perhaps not eating right, who knew what kind of monstrous little dumps she’d been forced to eat in. Or — she wasn’t alone. This latter thought was intolerable. Since he was already used to him, Mihály was no longer a threat. Oddly enough, he couldn’t take Mihály seriously, even though he had been the one she had eloped with. Mihály did not count. Mihály was not a man. Underneath it all he was convinced it would someday come to light that Mihály was not a man after all. Erzsi and Mihály might have been married, even slept together, but they did not belong to each other as man and wife. He couldn’t imagine it of Mihály. But now in Paris there was the nameless lover. The nameless lover could be a hundred times more tormenting than anyone familiar. Oh, it was unbearable."
- Nos?,- Well?,“Well?”,“Yes?”
"Nem is tudod elképzelni, mennyire irreálisak voltak, mennyire irtóztak minden gyakorlati valóságtól. Újság sosem volt a kezükben, sejtelmük sem volt, hogy mi történik a világban. Pedig akkor világháború volt; de őket nem érdekelte. Az iskolában egyszer kiderült, felelés közben, hogy Tamás sosem hallott Tisza Istvánról. Mikor Przemysl elesett, Tamás azt hitte, hogy egy orosz tábornokról van szó, és udvariasan örömét fejezte ki; majdnem megverték. Később az intelligensebb fiúk már Adyról és Babitsról vitatkoztak; Tamásnak az volt az elmélete, hogy mindenki tábornokról beszél, és Adyról is sokáig azt hitte, hogy tábornok. Az intelligensebb fiúk Tamást butának tartották, éppúgy, mint tanárai. Különös géniusza, történelmi tudása teljesen ismeretlen maradt az iskolában, amit ő egyébként egy csöppet sem sajnált.","You can’t even imagine how unreal they were, how disgusted they were with all practical realities. They never had a newspaper in their hands, they had no idea what was going on in the world. Yet it was a world war at the time; but they didn't care. Once in school, it turned out in response that Tamás had never heard of István Tisza. When Przemysl fell, Thomas thought he was a Russian general, and he politely expressed his joy; he was almost beaten. Later, the smarter boys were already arguing about Ady and Babits; Thomas had the theory that everyone was talking about a general, and Ady had long thought he was a general. The smarter boys thought Thomas was stupid, as did his teachers. His peculiar genius, his knowledge of history, remained completely unknown at school, which he did not regret in the slightest.","“You can’t begin to imagine how out of touch they were, how they shrank from every practical reality. They never held a newspaper in their hands, they had no idea what was happening in the world. There was a world war going on at the time—it didn’t interest them. At school it became obvious once during questions that Tamás had never heard of István Tisza. When Przemysl fell, he thought it was something to do with a Russian general, and politely expressed his pleasure. They nearly thrashed him. Later, when the more intelligent boys discovered Ady and Babits, he thought they were talking about generals, and he actually believed for ages that Ady was a general. The clever boys thought Tamás was stupid, as did his teachers. His real genius, his knowledge of history, went totally unnoticed in the school, which he for his part didn’t mind in the least.","“You can’t begin to appreciate how naïvely unrealistic they were, how they were repelled by anything practical. They never held a newspaper in their hands or had a clue about what was going on in the world. And it was wartime then. They couldn’t be bothered. Once when he was called on in school, it was painfully obvious Tamás had no idea István Tisza was the prime minister. And when we heard about Przemyśl falling, Tamás believed they were talking about a Russian general, when, as we all know, it was a crushing defeat for our armies. His less than tactful attempt to laugh off his gaffe nearly got his teeth knocked out. Later, when the more intelligent boys argued about the literary giants Ady and Babits, Tamás thought they were still talking about generals, and for the longest time he believed the poet Ady to be a generalissimo. His classmates considered Tamás to be an ignoramus, as did his teachers. His eccentric genius, his knowledge of history went unheralded in school, something which he didn’t mind in the least."
"Hát ez a házasság, gondolta, ennyire nem érti, ilyen reménytelen minden magyarázat? Igaz, hogy én sem értem.","Isn't this marriage, he thought, so incomprehensible, all such explanations? It's true that I don't understand either.","“So this is marriage,” he thought. “What does it amount to, when every attempt to explain is so hopeless? Mind you, I don’t fully understand all this myself.”",So — this was married life. So hopelessly over his head. There was no getting around how little he understood any of it. The truth of the matter was he couldn’t understand himself.
"Ráeszmélt, hogy ez az Utolsó Ítélet, ahogy egy kínai keresztény látja. Micsoda szakértelem és tárgyilagosság!","He realized this was the Last Judgment, as a Chinese Christian sees it.

What craftsmanship, and what objectivity!","It occurred to Mihály that this may be the Last Judgment, the way a Chinese Christian may have envisioned it. But the craftsmanship! The attention to the smallest detail!"

"5. Nagyon kényes dolog, nem is tudom, hogy írjam meg. Talán fel kellene tételeznem, hogy te is tisztában vagy ezzel, de nem tudom, az ilyen elvont és filozofikus természetű ember tisztában szokott-e lenni ilyesmivel, a női természet mérhetetlen törékenységével, és hogy mennyire uralkodnak rajta bizonyos testi dolgok. Arra kérlek, jól jegyezd meg magadnak Erzsi dátumait. Egy héttel a dolog bekövetkezése előtt légy elnéző és türelmes a végletekig. Erzsi ilyenkor nem egészen beszámítható. Keresi a civakodást. Legokosabb, ha csakugyan civakodsz vele, az levezeti az ingerültségét. De ne veszekedj komolyan. Gondold meg, hogy csak egy fiziológiai folyamatról vagy miről van szó. Ne ragadtasd el magad, ne mondj olyasmit, amit később megbánnál, és főképp ne engedd, hogy Erzsi mondjon olyant, mert később nagyon megbánja, és az rosszat tesz az idegeinek.","5. It’s a very delicate thing, I don’t even know how to write it. Perhaps I should assume that you are also aware of this, but I do not know whether a man of such an abstract and philosophical nature used to be aware of this, of the immeasurable fragility of female nature, and of the dominance of certain bodily things. Please memorize Erzsi's dates. A week before the thing happens, be forgiving and patient to the extreme. Erzsi is not quite credible in this case. He's looking for a fight. The smartest thing to do is really quarrel with it, it will distract you. But don't argue seriously. Think of it as just a physiological process or something. Don’t get carried away, don’t say something you’ll regret later, and most of all, don’t let Erzsi say that, because you’ll regret it a lot later and it will hurt your nerves.","5 A rather delicate matter. I don’t know how to put this. Perhaps I should just assume you’re aware of it, but I really don’t know if such an absentminded, philosophical sort of person is aware of such things as the incredible frailty of women, and how much they are at the mercy of certain physical functions. But I beg you to take careful note of Erzsi’s times of the month. A week before the onset you must be patient and tolerant in the extreme. At such times she is not fully responsible. She will pick quarrels. The wisest course is to stand your ground. It gives her an outlet for her irritation. But you mustn’t quarrel in earnest. Remember, it’s just a physiological function you’re dealing with. Don’t get carried away, and don’t say anything you might later regret. Above all, don’t let Erzsi say anything that she might later regret, as that’s no good for her nerves.","5. This next thing is very delicate, and I hardly know how to begin. Maybe I should presume that you know about all this, but I have no way of telling whether a withdrawn and philosophical creature such as yourself would know such things about the female, how immeasurably frail she is, and how certain things relating to the body can possess her entire being. I would like to ask you to take precise note of her menstrual cycle. Be especially indulgent and patient in the extreme one week before it begins. Erzsi cannot be held accountable for anything during this time. She may look for a fight. It’s best to indulge her. Fighting works off her passion. But don’t take the quarrels seriously. Think of them as part of a physiological process. Don’t allow yourself to be carried away by saying something you regret later, and, above all, don’t allow Erzsi to say anything which she will regret later. Very bad on her nerves."

"Ekkor az ajtó kinyílt, Vannina lépett be, kezében valami mécsszerű dologgal. Kémlelve nézett az ágy felé, majd mikor meglátta, hogy Mihály ébren van, mintha csodálkozó arcot öltött volna, és odalépett az ágyhoz.

"- Először odahaza voltam, Magyarországon, ott voltam novícius, Gyöngyösön, azután sokáig az egri rendházban voltam. Azután a magyarországi rendtartománynak ki kellett küldeni egy pátert Rómába, bizonyos ügyben, hát engem küldtek ki, mert addigra megtanultam olaszul. Miután azt az ügyet elintéztem, újra Rómába hívtak, mert ott nagyon megszerettek, bár igazán nem érdemeltem meg, és ott akartak tartani a generális mellett. De én attól féltem, hogy ez arra vezetne, hogy idővel... karriert csinálnék, már persze a szónak csak ferences értelmében, hogy házfőnök legyek valahol, vagy valami rangot töltsek be a generális mellett, és azt nem akartam. Megkértem a generális atyát, hogy helyezzen ide, Gubbióba.","- First I was back home, in Hungary, I was there in Novi Sad, in Gyöngyös, then I was in the convent in Eger for a long time. Then the Hungarian police had to send a priest to Rome, in some cases, so I was sent out because I had learned Italian by then. After I settled that matter, they called me to Rome again because they loved me there, although I really didn’t deserve it, and they wanted to keep me there with the general. But I was afraid it would lead me to make a career over time, of course only in the Franciscan sense of the word, to be a housekeeper somewhere, or to hold some rank next to the general, and I didn't want to. I asked the general to put him here in Gubbio.","“At first I remained back home, in Hungary. I was a novice in Gyöngyös, then for a long time at the monastery in Eger. Then the Hungarian branch of the Order had to send a father to Rome on some business, and I was chosen because I had been learning Italian. Then, some time after I had dealt with that, I was called to Rome again, because they had taken a great liking to me, though I certainly didn’t deserve it, and they wanted to keep me there to work with the Pater Prior. But I was concerned that this might lead, in due course, to my making a career, purely in the Franciscan context, naturally—becoming the head of a house somewhere, or filling some rank at Head Office. And that I didn’t want. So I asked Pater Prior to place me here in Gubbio.”","“It started back home in Hungary where I had become a novitiate, in the town of Gyöngyös. Then for a long time I lived in a monastery in Eger. Then the Order in Hungary had to send one of the Fathers to Rome on some official business, and they sent me, since by that time I had become fluent in Italian. After the matter was concluded, I was again called back to Rome. They had taken a liking to me there, although I had done little to deserve it. Anyway, I was to help the Abbot-General. But I feared that in time this would lead to, um, a career, in the Franciscan sense. I mean, a rectorship or some rank as Assistant Abbot-General, something I didn’t want. I requested the Abbot-General to transfer me here to Gubbio.”"
"Mihály felkelt és nyugtalanul járkált a szobában. Most, most bántani kezdte, hogy így kiadta magát. Erzsinek... egy idegen nőnek...","Michael got up and walked restlessly in the room.

"Tudom, hogy minden más ember a lelkére beszélt volna, vagy sürgönyzött volna jobbra és balra, segítséget kért volna barátaitól és a rendőrségtől és a mentőktől, és nem tudom, honnan szokás. Nekem is az volt az első érzésem, hogy tennem kellene valamit, segítségért kellene kiáltanom. Nem tettem, és kétségbeesetten vigyáztam Tamás lépéseire. De azután egyszerre megvilágosodott bennem, hogy Tamásnak igaza van. Hogy honnan tudtam, nem mondhatom meg... de emlékszel, mindig milyen közel voltunk egymáshoz, mennyire tudtam, mi történik benne - és most tudtam, hogy nem lehet rajta segíteni. Ha nem most, hát akkor máskor, nemsokára, és ha én nem leszek ott, akkor egyedül fog meghalni, és az szörnyű lesz, mind a kettőnknek.","I know every other person would have spoken to his soul, or rushed right and left, asked for help from his friends and the police and ambulances, and I don’t know where he got used to. I also had my first feeling that I should do something, cry for help. I didn’t, and I was desperately watching Thomas ’footsteps. But then at once it became clear to me that Thomas was right. I can't tell you how I knew it ... but you remember how close we were to each other, how much I knew what was going on in it - and now I knew you couldn't help it. If not now, then another time, soon, and if I am not there, he will die alone, and it will be terrible, for both of us.","“I know that anyone else would have reasoned with him, or sent off telegrams right and left, called for help from his friends and the police and the emergency services and whatever else one does. That was my first feeling too, that I ought to do something, I ought to call for help. I didn’t, and I watched his preparations with despair. But then suddenly it dawned on me that Tamás was right. How I knew this I can’t say … but you remember how close we always were, how I always knew what was going on inside him—and now I knew that he was beyond help. If it didn’t happen now, then some other time, soon; and if I wasn’t there then he would die alone, and that would be terrible, for both of us.","“Maybe someone else would’ve tried to talk him out of it or send telegrams all over the place, get help from friends, ambulance, the police, from anywhere you’re supposed to. That was my first instinct, too. That I should do something. Scream for help. But I didn’t. Hopelessly I watched his every step. Then it suddenly dawned on me Tamás was right. I can’t tell you how I knew, but… you remember how close we were, what was going on inside him, and I realized he couldn’t be helped. If not now, then another time, soon. And if I wasn’t with him, he’d die alone, and that would be terrible for both of us."

"Ez az érzés egyébként nem tartott sokáig, és nem is volt sok ilyen rohamom. Nagyon kellemetlen volt egyszer természetrajz órán. Éppen megnyílt melletted a föld, mikor kihívtak felelni. Én meg se mozdultam, csak ültem tovább a helyemen. A tanár egy ideig még szólongatott, majd mikor látta, hogy nem mozdulok, felkelt, és odajött hozzám. - Mi bajod van? - kérdezte. Persze nem feleltem. Erre egy darabig nézett rám, azután visszament a katedrára, és mást hívott ki felelni. Olyan finom papi lélek volt, hogy nem szólt soha egy szót sem az esetről. Annál többet beszéltek róla az osztálytársaim. Azt hitték, hogy lázadásból, dacból nem mentem ki felelni, és hogy a tanár megijedt tőlem. Egy csapásra híres jópofa lettem, és hallatlan népszerűségnek örvendtem az egész iskolában. Egy héttel később a természetrajztanár Szepetneki Jánost hívta ki. Ezt a Szepetneki Jánost, akit ma láttál. Szepetneki legkalandorabb arcát vette magára, és ülve maradt. A tanár erre felkelt, odament Szepetnekihez, és rettenetesen felpofozta. Szepetneki attól kezdve meg volt győződve arról, hogy nekem óriási protekcióm van.","This feeling didn’t last long anyway, and I didn’t have many such seizures. It was very uncomfortable once in nature classes. The ground just opened up next to you when you were challenged to answer. I didn't move, I just sat in my seat. The teacher spoke for a while, then when he saw that I was not moving, he got up and came to me. - What's wrong with you? - asked. Of course I didn't answer. He looked at me for a while, then went back to the cathedral and called someone else to answer. He was such a fine priestly soul that he never said a word about the case. My classmates talked about it all the more. They thought I hadn’t gone out of my way out of rebellion, defiance, and that the teacher was scared of me. I became a famous good man in one fell swoop and enjoyed unheard of popularity throughout the school. A week later, the natural history teacher summoned János Szepetneki. This John of Szepetnek you saw today. He took on the most adventurous face of Szepetnek and remained seated. The teacher got up to this, went to Szepetneki, and slapped him terribly. From then on, Szepetneki was convinced that I had tremendous protection.","“All the same, the feeling didn’t last very long, and the attacks weren’t frequent. There was a really bad one once, during a natural history lesson. Just as I was called on to answer a question, the ground opened beside me. I couldn’t move, I just stayed sitting in my place. The teacher kept on at me for a while, then when he saw that I wasn’t going to move, got up and came over to me. ‘ What’s the matter?’ he asked. Of course I didn’t reply. So he just looked at me for a while, then went back to his chair and asked someone else to answer. He was such a fine, priestly soul: he never said a word about the incident. But my classmates talked about it all the more. They thought I had refused to reply out of cheek, or stubbornness, and that the teacher was afraid of me. At a stroke, I had become a public character and enjoyed unprecedented popularity throughout the school. A week later, the same teacher called out János Szepetneki—the one you met today. Szepetneki put on his tough-guy face and stayed in his seat. The teacher got up, went over to him, and soundly boxed his ears. From that time on Szepetneki was convinced I had some special status.","“The feeling, by the way, never lasted long, and I had only a few of these attacks.

He studied me for some time, then went back to his desk and called on someone else. He was such a fine priestly soul that he never said a word about it. But my classmates latched on to it with a vengeance. They were certain I was a rebel who refused to answer out of defiance, and that the teacher was now afraid of me. In a single stroke I became the man of the hour, incredibly popular throughout the school. A week later the teacher called on János Szepetneki. The same János Szepetneki you saw today. Szepetneki put on his best hooligan face and deliberately defied the teacher. At this, the teacher got up, walked over to him and slapped him across the face.

He took his new hat, bought out of the money received from Pataki, and hurried off to the hotel where she was staying.","To say he was confounded would be an understatement.

"jól tudom, kissé émelygős dolog, hogy hosszú és barátságos levelet írok neked, miután „elcsábítottad és megszöktetted” a feleségemet, de te sosem voltál a konvenciók embere, és ezért talán nem is fogsz megütődni rajta, ha én, bár mindig vén konformistának neveztél, ez egyszer szintén nem törődöm a viselkedésünket irányító szabályokkal. Írok neked, mert másképp nem volnék nyugodt. Írok neked, mert őszintén megvallva, nem tudom, miért ne írnék, hiszen azzal mind a ketten tisztában vagyunk, hogy nem haragszom rád. A látszatot csak tartsuk meg a világ előtt, mert Erzsi önérzetének bizonyára jobban esik az a romantikus beállítás, hogy mi miatta halálos ellenségek vagyunk, de magunk közt, Mihályom, tudod jól, hogy mindig nagyra becsültelek, és ezen nem változtat az a tény, hogy elcsábítottad és megszöktetted a feleségemet. Nem mintha ez a „tetted” nem tört volna teljesen össze, hiszen azt sem kell tagadnom előtted - de persze ez is maradjon közöttünk -, hogy mennyire imádom most is Erzsit. De tisztában vagyok vele, hogy te nem tehetsz semmiről. Általában nem hiszem, ne haragudj, hogy te tehetnél valamiről ezen a világon.","I know it's a little nauseous to write you a long and friendly letter after you ""seduced and escaped"" my wife, but you were never a man of conventions, so you might not even be struck by me, even though you always called me an old conformist, this one day I also don’t care about the rules that govern our behavior. I am writing to you because otherwise I would not be calm. I am writing to you because, frankly, I do not know why I would not write, for we are both aware that I am not angry with you. Let's just keep the appearance in front of the world, because Erzsi's self-esteem is certainly better for the romantic setting that we are mortal enemies because of him, but among you, Michael, you know that I always appreciate you, and the fact that you seduced and escaped my wife. It's not as if this ""act"" of yours hasn't completely shattered, as I don't have to deny you - but of course it should remain with us - how much I love Elizabeth even now. But I am aware that you cannot do anything. I don’t usually think you’re angry that you could do something about this world.","I know it’s a bit much, my writing you a long and friendly letter after you ‘seduced and ran off with’ my wife, but you never were a conventional sort of chap, and so perhaps you won’t be shocked if I too disregard convention just this once, even though you’ve always branded me an old conformist. I’m writing to you because I won’t be at rest until I do. I’m writing to you because, quite honestly, I don’t see why I shouldn’t, since we are both perfectly aware that I’m not angry with you. We only keep up the appearance because it’s better for Erzsi’s self-esteem to have the romantic situation where we are locked into deadly enmity over her. But between ourselves, my dear Mihály, you are well aware that I always thought highly of you, and this hasn’t changed simply because you ‘seduced and ran off with’ my wife. Not as if this ‘crime’ of yours hasn’t left me absolutely distraught. I needn’t deny—this of course is strictly between us—how much I still adore her. But I realise you aren’t responsible for that. As a general fact—don’t take this amiss—I don’t believe you’re responsible for anything I can think of in the whole world.","I know it’s sickeningly sweet of me to be writing a long and friendly letter to you after you “seduced and kidnapped” my wife, but you were never a man of conventions, and for that reason will not be shocked if I — although you’ve often called me an old conformist — refuse just this once to care about the rules that govern our behaviour. I’m writing to you for my own peace of mind. I’m writing to you — I must confess I don’t know why I shouldn’t be writing to you — since it is quite clear to both of us that I’m not angry with you. We may want to keep up the masquerade in the eyes of the world; it is certainly beneficial to Erzsi’s self-esteem to think of it in these romantic terms, that we are mortal enemies, but between us, Mihály, you know very well how I have always valued you, and the fact that you seduced and kidnapped my wife does not change any of this. Not that this “deed” of yours didn’t destroy me, and why should I deny — this should also stay between us — the fact that I still adore Erzsi. But it is clear to me that you didn’t do anything wrong. Forgive me, but as a rule I don’t think you are capable of doing anything wrong in the world."

"Esteledett, mikor ott állt a kis kocsma előtt, a Trastevere negyedben, ahol előtte való este Szepetneki Jánossal találkozott. A helyi szokásokhoz való alkalmazkodásképpen fejébe nyomta rozzant kalapját, és belépett a füstös helyiségbe. Látni nem látott, de Szepetneki hangját mindjárt meghallotta. Szepetneki most is a lánnyal foglalkozott.","It was evening when he was standing in front of the small pub in the Trastevere district, where he had met János Szepetneki the night before. Adapting to local customs, he pressed his rosy hat into his head and entered the smoky room. He didn't see it, but he immediately heard Szepetneki's voice. Szepetneki was still dealing with the girl.","Night was already falling when he reached the little tavern in the Trastevere quarter where he had met János Szepetneki the evening before. Following the local custom, he pressed his shabby old hat down on his head and stepped into the smoky interior. His eyes could distinguish nothing, but Szepetneki’s voice was immediately audible. As before, Szepetneki was busy with the girl.","Night fell as he stood in front of the little taverna in the Trastevere, where he’d met with János Szepetneki the night before. Keeping with local custom, he pressed his ragged hat down on his head and went into the smoky place. He couldn’t see much, but he heard Szepetneki’s voice. He was occupying himself with the girl again."
"De leginkább, mindenen túl, azért reagált Szepetneki közeledésére, mert női ösztönével érezte, hogy ez elsősorban Mihály asszonyának szól. Tudta, hogy Szepetneki milyen furcsa relációban volt Mihállyal, hogy mindig és minden eszközzel be akarta bizonyítani, hogy ő a különb kettejük közül, és ezért akarja most elszeretni Mihály feleségét. Erzsi beteg és özvegyes vigasztalódással fürdött Szepetneki vágyában, és úgy érezte, hogy most, ezzel a vággyal, ennek a felkeltésével válik igazán Mihály asszonyává, most lép be a bűvös körbe, a régi, Ulpius-körbe, ami Mihály számára az egyetlen realitás.","But most of all, after all, she reacted to Szepetneki's approach because she felt with her feminine instinct that it was primarily for Mihály's wife. He knew what a strange relationship Szepetneki had with Michael, that he always and by all means wanted to prove that he was one of the two of them, and that is why he now wanted to love Michael's wife. Erzsi bathed in Szepetneki's desire with sickness and widow's consolation, and she felt that now, with this desire, arousing her, she would truly become Michael's wife, now entering the magic circle, the old Ulpius circle, which is the only reality for Michael.","But above all she responded to Szepetneki’s advances because she felt with her woman’s instinct that he was treating her essentially as Mihály’s wife. She knew what a strange relationship Szepetneki had with Mihály, how he always, by whatever means, wanted to prove that he was the better of the two; and this was why he now wished to seduce Mihály’s wife. Erzsi bathed in Szepetneki’s desire with a sickly, widow-like need for consolation, and she felt that now, with this desire, this awakening, she was becoming Mihály’s authentic wife, she was entering the magic circle, the old Ulpius circle, Mihály’s true reality.","But the overriding reason she responded to Szepetneki’s advances was because she knew, deep down, that his advances were directed not at her but at Mihály’s wife. She was quite aware of the curiously competitive relationship between him and Mihály, and how Szepetneki would resort to any and all means to prove he was superior, even if it meant seducing his friend’s wife. Sick and tired of being the abandoned woman, Erzsi allowed herself to languish in Szepetneki’s desire, feeling that through this desire, its sensual arousal, she’d truly become Mihály’s lover and enter the enchanted circle of the Ulpius house, her husband’s one and only reality."

"Mihály legnagyobb meglepetésére Szepetneki Jánost ismerte fel. Hirtelenjében nem tudott mást mondani, mint hogy:","To Michael's greatest surprise, he recognized János Szepetneki. Suddenly he could say nothing but that:","Mihály to his astonishment recognised János Szepetneki.

"Mikor magához tért, még mindig nem tudott egy szót sem olaszul. Az ápolónőtől magyarul kérdezte, fáradt és ijedt hangon, a szokásos kérdéseket, hogy hol van, és hogy került ide. Minthogy az ápolónő nem tudott felelni, magától is rájött - nem volt nagyon nehéz -, hogy kórházban van. Arra is visszaemlékezett, hogy milyen furcsán érezte magát a hegyek közt, és megnyugodott. Csak arra volt kíváncsi, hogy mi baja. Fájdalmat nem érzett, csak nagyon gyenge és fáradt volt.","When he recovered, he still didn't know a word of Italian. She asked the nurse in Hungarian, in a tired and frightened voice, the usual questions of where she was and how she got here. Since the nurse could not answer, she realized for herself - it was not very difficult - that she was in the hospital. He also recalled how strange he felt in the mountains and calmed down. He was just wondering what was wrong. He felt no pain, only very weak and tired.","WHEN HE RECOVERED consciousness he was still unable to speak a word of Italian. In a weary, timorous voice, using Hungarian, he asked the nurse the usual questions: where was he, and how had he got there? The nurse being unable to reply, he worked out for himself—it was not very difficult—that he was in hospital. He even remembered the strange feeling he had experienced in the mountains, and grew calmer. All he wanted to know was, what was wrong with him? He felt no pain, just very weak and tired.","When he came to, he still couldn’t recall a single word of Italian.

"Találkoznia kell Waldheimmel; a gyakorlati megoldásnak valami lehetősége is derengett feléje. Abban a cikkben, amely Waldheim előadásáról számolt be, szó esett valami recepcióról is, melyet a Palazzo Falconieriben, a Collegium Hungaricum székházában adtak. Mihálynak eszébe jutott, hogy Rómában van egy Collegium Hungaricum, ahol ösztöndíjas fiatal művész- és tudósjelöltek élnek; itt bizonyára tudni fogják Waldheim címét, ha ugyan nem lakik ő is ott.","You have to meet Waldheim; there was also some possibility of a practical solution. The article, which reported on Waldheim's presentation, also mentioned a reception given at the Palazzo Falconieri, the headquarters of the Collegium Hungaricum.

One possible way of effecting this now seemed to offer itself. In the article reporting the lecture, mention was made of a reception to be given in the Palazzo Falconieri, the headquarters of the Collegium Hungaricum.

Here they would at least be able to give him Waldheim’s address, if he were not actually living there.","He had to see Waldheim. He may be his last and only glimmer of salvation.

"És negyednap már nem kértem számon az órát. Átláttam, hogy ha csakugyan ő vitte el, akkor azért vitte el, mert Évának pénzre volt szüksége. És valószínűleg Éva tudtával vitte el, hiszen az egész átöltözés-mókát Éva indítványozta - és az a jelenet, amikor kettesben ültem Évával, talán arra való volt, hogy ne vegyem mindjárt észre az óra eltűnését. Mikor erre a lehetőségre rájöttem, bele is törődtem a dologba. Ha Éváért történt, jól történt. Akkor ez is hozzátartozik a játékhoz, a régi játékhoz az Ulpius-házban.","And on Thursday, I didn't ask for an hour. I saw that if he really took it, he took it because Eve needed money. And he probably took it with Eve’s knowledge, as the whole change of dressing fun was suggested by Eve — and the scene when I was sitting alone with Eve was maybe not for me to notice the disappearance of the clock right away. When I realized this possibility, I cared about it. If it happened for Eve, it happened well. Then it also belongs to the game, the old game in the House of Ulpius.","“And on the fourth day I still hadn’t been able to challenge him about it. I was sure that only he could have taken it, and that he had done so because Éva needed money. In all probability he had taken it with her full knowledge. She had set up the whole clothes-swapping game—and that was the point of the scene when I sat alone with her. Perhaps its whole purpose was so that I wouldn’t immediately notice that it had gone. When I stumbled on this possibility I was able to accept what had happened. If it happened because of Éva, it was all right. It was all part of the game, the old games in the Ulpius house.","“On the fourth day I no longer asked about the watch. It was plain that only he could’ve taken it because Éva needed money. Most likely with her consent. Come to think of it, the whole clothes swapping charade started at Éva’s suggestion. And her being alone with me was just a ploy so I wouldn’t notice my watch was gone. Once I realized this, I resigned myself to the whole matter. If it was staged by Éva, so be it. It was all a game, one of our quaint Ulpius house games."

Mihály was well acquainted with love’s pauses, its blank intermissions, when, between the more ardent periods of passion, we become suddenly quite indifferent to the beloved, and look into the beautiful unfamiliar face wondering whether this actually is the woman … this was one of those pauses, but more pronounced than any he had known before. Éva had gone cold.","He felt a coldness pass through him, a strange and sick coldness, as after an anaesthetic, where a part of the body became gradually numb, alien and terrifying. That’s how something called Éva died in him. Mihály was familiar with love’s ellipses, those missed beats in its most tempestuous moments when it became suddenly empty of dream, and now he could only marvel at the beauty of a face that was becoming alien right in front of his eyes, amazed that she had ever been the one. It was that same feeling. Empty. Devoid of all emotion. And the Éva he’d known was suddenly cold."
"De nem sok ideje volt ezen elmélkedni, mert figyelemmel hallgatta Szepetnekit. Azt remélte, hogy megtud tőle valami nagyon fontosat Mihályra vonatkozólag. Szepetneki boldogan mesélt a közösen töltött évekről; de persze az ő beállításában minden eltorzult, és másképp festett, mint Mihályéban. Csak Tamás maradt nagyszerű: halálraszánt királyfi, akit az élet nem érdemel meg; elment korán, mielőtt meg kellett volna alkudnia. Szepetneki szerint Tamás olyan finom volt, hogy nem tudott aludni, ha a harmadik szobában megmozdult valami, és egy erősebb szaggal ki lehetett kergetni a világból. Csak az volt a baj, hogy szerelmes volt a húgába. Viszonyuk volt, és amikor Éva teherbe esett, Tamás lelkiismeretfurdalásában megölte magát. Évába különben mindenki szerelmes volt. Ervin azért ment szerzetesnek, mert reménytelenül szerette Évát. Mihály is reménytelenül szerelmes volt Évába. Úgy ment utána, mint egy kiskutya. Komikus volt. És Éva kihasználta. Minden pénzét elszedte. És ellopta az aranyóráját. Mert az órát természetesen Éva lopta el, nem ő, de ezt nem akarták Mihálynak megmondani, delicatesse-ből. De Éva egyiküket sem szerette. Csak őt. Szepetneki Jánost.","But he didn't have much time to think about it, because he listened intently to Szepetnek. He hoped to learn something very important from him about Michael. Szepetneki happily recounted the years they spent together; but of course everything in his setting was distorted and painted differently than in Michael's. Only Thomas remained great: a prince destined to die, whom life does not deserve; he left early before he had to bargain. According to Szepetnek, Tamás was so delicate that he could not sleep if something moved in the third room and could be driven out of the world by a stronger odor. The only problem was that she was in love with her sister. They had an affair, and when Eve got pregnant, Thomas killed herself in remorse. Otherwise, everyone was in love with Eve. Ervin went to be a monk because he loved Eve hopelessly. Michael was also hopelessly in love with Eve. He went after him like a puppy. He was a comedian. And Eve took advantage of it. He took all his money. And he stole his gold watch. Because the watch was, of course, stolen by Eve, not her, but they didn't want to tell Michael from delicatesse. But Eve did not love any of them. Just him. János Szepetneki.","But she had little time for these reflections because she was listening intently to Szepetneki. He clearly hoped to learn something important about Mihály from her. He chatted happily away about their years together, though of course everything was slanted to fit his point of view, and he painted rather a different picture from Mihály’s. Only Tamás remained wonderful: princely, death-marked, a young man who was too good for this world. He had left it young before he had to compromise with it. According to Szepetneki, Tamás was so sensitive he couldn’t sleep if someone was moving about three rooms away and a strong smell would have completely finished him off. The only problem was, he was in love with his sister. They had become lovers, and, when Éva fell pregnant, Tamás killed himself from remorse. In fact, everyone was in love with Éva. Ervin had become a monk because of his hopeless passion for her. Mihály too was hopelessly in love with her. He followed her around like a puppy. It was comical. And how she treated him! She took all his money. And she stole his gold watch. Because of course it was Éva, not himself, who stole it, but he didn’t want to say that to Mihály out of delicacy. But she was in love with neither of them. Only with him, János Szepetneki.","She didn't waste any more time ruminating, because she was listening intently now to what Szepetneki was saying. She hoped he’d disclose something important about Mihály. She hoped he’d disclose something important about Mihály. He spoke affectionately about their years together, but everything was so skewed by his viewpoint that the picture emerging vastly differed from Mihály’s. Only Tamás was worthwhile: a fatal prince the world didn’t deserve. He died without ever compromising himself. According to Szepetneki, Tamás was so sensitive he couldn’t sleep if something stirred three rooms away. A strong odour could drive him off the face of the earth. But the real problem was, he was in love with his sister. They had relations, and when Éva got pregnant, Tamás offed himself as a matter of conscience. Everyone, incidentally, was in love with her. Ervin became a monk because he was hopelessly in love with her. Mihály was also hopelessly in love with Éva. Mihály followed her around like a love-sick puppy. It was comical. And Éva used Mihály horribly. Took all his money. And stole Mihály’s gold watch. Naturally it was Éva who had stolen the watch, not him. But out of a sense of delicacy no one had told Mihály. Éva didn’t really love any of them. Except him — János Szepetneki."
"Lámpát hoztak, és a lány elmerült Mihály tenyerének a vizsgálatába.","A lamp was brought in, and the girl was immersed in examining Michael's palm.",A lamp was brought and the girl immersed herself in the examination of Mihály’s palm.,"They brought a lamp, and the girl soon became absorbed in examining Mihály’s palm."
"Amint ott ült töltőtollal kezében, és várta, hogy eszébe jussanak a példásan fegyelmezett mondatok, egyszerre csöngettek. Mihály erősen összerezzent. Hétszámra nem jön hozzájuk senki, ki lehet ez éppen most? Egy pillanatra megnevezhetetlen sejtelmek futottak át rajta. A háziasszony nem volt otthon. Nem, nem nyit ajtót, most már igazán nincs értelme, most már nincs dolga senkivel.","As he sat there with a fountain pen in his hand, waiting for the exemplary disciplined sentences to come to mind, they rang at once. Michael shuddered. No one comes to them for seven, who could it be right now? Unforgettable conjectures ran through him for a moment. The housewife was not at home. No, it doesn’t open doors, it really doesn’t make sense now, it has nothing to do with anyone anymore.","As he sat there with the pen in his hand, waiting for the words of exemplary discipline to enter his head, there was a sudden knocking at the door. Mihály started violently. A week could go by and no-one called on him. Who could this be, just now? For a moment nameless suspicions flitted through his head. The lady of the house was not at home. No, he wouldn’t open the door. There was truly no reason now why he should. He had no business with anyone now.","As he sat there, fountain pen in hand, waiting to compose his careful and loving characters, the doorbell rang. Mihály shuddered. No one had ever come midweek. Who could it be? All sorts of remote possibilities crossed his mind. The landlady was not at home. No, he wasn’t going to open the door. It was utterly senseless now. He had nothing more to say to anybody."
"A lány kezével intett, hogy az már mindegy. Azután Ellesleyhez fordult:",She gestured that it didn't matter. Then he turned to Ellesley:,Her hand made a gesture of indifference. Then she turned to Ellesley:,With a sweep of her hand the girl indicated it was all the same. She turned to Ellesley.
"Mihály mérhetetlen fáradtságot érzett, mintha eddig két kezében görcsösen összeszorítva tartotta volna életét, és most hagyná, hogy elszaladjon tőle.","Michael felt immeasurably tired, as if he had held his life convulsively in both hands until now, and now let him run away from him.","Mihály felt an immeasurable fatigue. It was as if he had all the while been anxiously clutching his life in his hands, and had just let it slip away.","Mihály felt a profound weariness, as if he’d been holding life in a death grip, until his knuckles turned white, and now he was about to let go."
"Tamás anyja már nem élt. Tamás és húga, Éva, gyűlölték apjukat, és azzal vádolták, hogy hideg komorságával halálba kergette anyjukat, mikor az még egészen fiatal volt. Ez volt az első megdöbbentő élményem az Ulpius-házban, mindjárt első látogatásomkor. Éva azt mondta az apjáról, hogy olyan a szeme, mint a cipőgomb - amiben egyébként teljesen igaza is volt, és Tamás a világ legtermészetesebb hangján azt mondta: - Mert tudod, az apám rendkívül undorító fráter - amiben szintén igaza volt. Én, hiszen tudod, erősen összetartó családi körben nőttem fel, szüleimet és testvéreimet nagyon szerettem, az apámat mindig imádtam, és nem is tudtam elképzelni, hogy szülők és gyermekek ne szeressék egymást, vagy hogy a gyermekek éppúgy bírálják el szüleik viselkedését, mint idegen emberekét. Ez volt az első, a nagy, primordiális lázadás, amivel életemben találkoztam. És ez a lázadás furcsa módon végtelenül rokonszenves volt a számomra, bár magamnak eszem ágában sem volt fellázadni apám ellen.","Thomas' mother was no longer alive. Thomas and his sister Eve hated their father and accused him of chasing his mother to death with his cold gloom when he was very young. This was my first shocking experience at the House of Ulpius on my very first visit. Eve said of her father that her eyes were like a shoe button — which she was absolutely right about anyway, and Thomas said in the most natural voice in the world, “Because, you know, my father is an extremely disgusting frater — that she was also right about. I, as you know, grew up in a very cohesive family, I loved my parents and siblings very much, I always loved my father, and I couldn’t even imagine parents and children not loving each other, or children judging their parents as much as strangers. . This was the first major primordial rebellion I have ever encountered in my life. And this rebellion was strangely infinitely sympathetic to me, even though I had no idea to rebel against my father.","“Tamás’s mother was no longer alive. He and his younger sister Éva hated their father. They blamed him for driving their mother to her death with his cold gloominess when she was still a young woman. This was my first, rather shocking, experience of the Ulpius household at the start of my first visit. Éva said of her father that he had eyes like shoe-buttons (which, by the way, was very true), and Tamás added, in the most natural voice you can imagine, ‘because, you know, my father is a most thoroughly loathsome fellow,’ in which he too was right. As you know, I grew up in a close-knit family circle. I adored my parents and siblings, I worshipped my father and couldn’t begin to imagine that parents and children might not love one another, or that the children should criticise their parents’ conduct as if they were strangers. This was the first great primordial rebellion I had ever encountered in my life. And this rebellion seemed to me in some strange way endlessly appealing, although in my own mind there was never any question of revolt against my own father.","“Tamás’s mother had died. Tamás and his sister Éva hated their father. They accused him and his moroseness of driving their young mother to her death. It was the first of many startling revelations at the Ulpius house. On my first visit, Éva said her father’s eyes were like shoe buttons — which is exactly what they looked like, by the way. And Tamás, in the most natural of voices, pronounced, ‘If you must know, my father is a totally repulsive old fart.’ Which is exactly what he was. “As you know, I grew up in a very close-knit family. I loved my parents and my brothers and sister very much, adored my father, and could not imagine parents and children not loving each other, or that children would speak disparagingly about their parents as if they were strangers. When I first witnessed it, the experience struck me as a sort of great primordial rebellion. In a strange way I identified with their rebellion, although it never crossed my mind to challenge my own father."

A kapus testvér csodálkozva nézett végig Mihály ruházatán.,The goalkeeper brother looked at Michael's clothes in amazement.,The gate-brother was gazing up and down in amazement at his clothes.,The gatekeeper brother was quite taken by Mihály’s clothes.
"Úgy kell elképzelned, hogy a két testvér élete az Ulpius-házban állandóan színház volt, állandó commedia dell’arte. A legcsekélyebb dolog elég volt, hogy megindítsa a dolgot, hogy Tamás és Éva megjátsszanak valamit, illetve hogy játsszanak, ahogy ők mondták. A nagyapa mesélt valamit egy várbeli grófnőről, aki szerelmes volt a kocsisába, és Éva mindjárt grófnő lett és Tamás kocsis; vagy elmesélte, hogyan ölték meg Majláth országbírót oláh inasai, és Éva országbíró lett és Tamás oláh inasok; vagy sokkal hosszabb, komplikáltabb és folytatásos történelmi rémdrámák fejlődtek ki. A játékok természetesen csak nagy vonásokban jelezték az eseményeket, mint a commedia dell’arte: egy-két ruhadarabbal, főképp a nagyapa kifogyhatatlan és megdöbbentő ruhatárából, jelezni tudták a kosztümöt, azután következett egy nem nagyon hosszú, de rendkívül barokk, nyakatekert dialógus, majd a gyilkosság vagy öngyilkosság. Mert ahogy most visszagondolok, ezek a rögtönzött színjátékok mindig az erőszakos halál képei felé csúcsosodtak ki. Tamás és Éva naponta egyszer megfojtották, megmérgezték, ledöfték vagy olajba főzték egymást.","You have to imagine that the lives of the two brothers in the House of Ulpius were constantly theater, permanent commedia dell’arte. The slightest thing was enough to start the thing, for Thomas and Eve to play something, or to play as they said. The grandfather told me something about a countess in the castle who was in love with her carriage, and Eve immediately became a countess, and Thomas became a carriage; or he told how the sons of Maathlath were killed by the servants of Olah, and Eve the chief judge, and Thomas the servants of Olah; or much longer, more complicated, and continuous historical horror dramas developed. The games, of course, only signaled events in great features, like the commedia dell'arte: with one or two pieces of clothing, mainly from the grandfather's inexhaustible and startling wardrobe, they were able to signal the costume, followed by a not very long but extremely baroque, neck-wrapped dialogue. murder or suicide. Because as I think back now, these impromptu plays have always culminated in images of violent death. Thomas and Eve strangled, poisoned, stabbed, or boiled each other once a day.","“You have to understand that life for these two in the Ulpius house was non-stop theatre, a perpetual commedia dell’arte. The slightest thing was enough to set them off on some dramatisation, or rather, they acted things out as they talked. The grandfather would tell some story about a local countess who had fallen in love with her coachman, and instantly Éva was the countess and Tamás the coachman. Or, he would tell how the state judge Majláth was murdered by his Wallachian footman, so Éva became the judge and Tamás the footman. Or they would develop some historical melodrama, much longer and more involved, as an ongoing serial. Naturally these plays sketched the events only in broad strokes, like the commedia dell’arte. With one or two items of clothing, usually from the grandfather’s inexhaustible and amazing wardrobe, they would suggest costume. Then would ensue some dialogue, not very long, but highly baroque and convoluted, followed by the murder or suicide. Because, as I think back now, these little improvisations always culminated in scenes of violent death. Day after day, Tamás and Éva strangled, poisoned, stabbed or boiled one another in oil.","“You need to imagine life at the Ulpius house as an ongoing theatre, an endless commedia dell’arte. The smallest trifle was enough to set things in motion, for Éva and Tamás to start acting, or to play, as they would call it. The grandfather would narrate a story about a countess from the castle who was in love with her coachman, and without the least bit of hesitation Éva became the countess and Tamás the coachman. Or how the magistrate Majlath was killed by his Wallachian servants. Éva would play the magistrate, Tamás one of the murderous servants. Sometimes these bits evolved into longer, more complicated, almost serialized horror stories. Of course the plays resembled events only in bold strokes as in commedia dell’arte, sometimes a few odd pieces from the grandfather’s inexhaustible wardrobe being enough to suggest a costume. What followed next was dialogue, not particularly long, but awfully baroque and twisted. Then, always: murder or suicide. As I think back on it, these spontaneous enactments always culminated in scenes of violent death. A day didn’t go by without Tamás and Éva strangling, poisoning, stabbing or boiling each other in oil."

Even now, he did not come to Italy, but on a honeymoon, which is quite different. Anyway, she could have come now because she was already a husband. Now, he thought, was not threatened by the danger that Italy was.","The trip to Italy might well have been postponed forever, but for the fact that he was now married and they had decided on the conventional Italian holiday for their start to married life. Mihály had now come, not to Italy as such, but on his honeymoon, a different matter entirely. Indeed, it was his marriage that made the trip possible. Now, he reasoned, there was nothing to fear from the danger Italy represented.","If he hadn’t married with the intent of embarking on a conventional life with a proper Italian honeymoon, he might have kept postponing his Italian trip until his dying day. Now he’d come not so much to Italy itself as on his honeymoon, which was another matter entirely. Besides, he was entitled to visit now, since he wore the shoes of a husband. This way, he assured himself, he’d sidestep the gaping abyss that was his Italy."

"Azután apjuk elhatározta, hogy valaminek történnie kell a gyermekeivel, ez így nem mehet tovább. Évát sürgősen férjhez akarta adni. Leküldte egy gazdag vidéki nagynénjéhez, aki nagy házat vitt, hogy ott megyebálozzék, és nem tudom mit csináljon. Éva persze egy hét múlva visszajött nagyszerű történetekkel, és flegmatikusan vágta zsebre az apai pofonokat. Tamásnak nem volt ilyen szerencsés természete. Apja hivatalba adta. Rettenetes rágondolni, most is könnyes lesz a szemem, ha rágondolok, hogy szenvedhetett Tamás a hivatalban. A városházán dolgozott, normális kispolgárok között, akik nem tartották épelméjűnek. A lehető legbutább, legsablonosabb munkákat bízták rá, mert nem tételezték fel róla, hogy meg tudna valamit csinálni, ami némi gondolkodást vagy önállóságot igényel. És talán igazuk is volt. A kollégák részéről rengeteg megaláztatásnak volt kitéve: nem mintha bántották volna, ellenkezőleg, sajnálták és kímélték. Tamás sosem panaszkodott nekünk, csak Évának néha; így tudom. Tamás csak elsápadt és elhallgatott, ha a hivatalát említettük.","Then their father decided that something had to happen to their children, so it couldn’t go on. She wanted to marry Eve urgently. He sent it to a wealthy country aunt who took a big house to be there for the county ball and I don’t know what to do. Of course, Eva came back a week later with great stories and phlegmatically pocketed the paternal slaps. Thomas did not have such a lucky nature. He was fired by his father. It is terrible to think about it, it will still be a tear in my eyes to think that Tamás may have suffered in office. He worked at the town hall, among normal little citizens who did not consider him sane. He was entrusted with the dumbest, most stenciled work possible because he was not assumed to be able to do something that required some thought or independence. And maybe they were right. He was subjected to a great deal of humiliation on the part of his colleagues: it was not as if he had been hurt, on the contrary, he was sorry and spared. Thomas never complained to us, only to Eve sometimes; so i know. Thomas only paled and fell silent when we mentioned his office.","“At that point their father decided that things really couldn’t carry on as they were. Something would have to be done about his children. He wanted to marry Éva off as a matter of urgency. He bundled her off to a rich old aunt in the country, who took a large house where she could go to county balls and Lord knows what else. Éva of course returned after a week, with some marvellous stories, and submitted phlegmatically to her father’s chastisement. Tamás did not share his sister’s easy nature. His father put him in an office. It’s horrible to think … even now it brings tears to my eyes when I think how he suffered in that office. He worked in the city hall, with conventional petty-bourgeois types who regarded him as mentally unsound. They gave him the most stupid, most dully routine work possible, because they reckoned he wouldn’t be able to cope with anything requiring a little thought or initiative. And perhaps they were right. The worst of the many humiliations he received at their hands amounted to this: not that they insulted him, but that they pitied and cosseted him. Tamás never complained to us, just occasionally to Éva. That’s how I know. He just went pale and became very withdrawn whenever the office was mentioned.","“Then their father decided something had to be done about his children. Things simply couldn’t go on as they were. Éva had to be married off and in a hurry. He sent her packing to a rich aunt’s house in the country where Éva could attend county balls and whatnot. After a week she returned with fantastic tales, and reacted to her father’s slaps across her face with cynical indifference. Tamás was less docile. His father sent him to work in an office. It’s impossible to think about it with dry eyes. How Tamás must’ve suffered in that office. He worked in city hall among little clerical types who considered him mentally deficient. They kept throwing the dullest, most mundane tasks at him, assuming he wouldn’t be able to handle anything requiring the least bit of practical thought or independence. Perhaps they were right. He was subjected to repeated humiliations from his colleagues. It wasn’t so much that they bullied him, but on the contrary, they pitied and indulged him. As far as I know, Tamás never complained to any of us, only to Éva. He became pale and depressed at the mere mention of the office."

This is how Eve smiled when I was the victim.","“Now … that’s it,” said Mihály. “When you smile down at me like that. That’s how Éva smiled when I was the victim.”","“Yes. This is what I mean,” said Mihály. “When you smile at me like that. When you look down at me. That’s how Éva smiled when I was her victim.”"
"Vajon csakugyan kíván-e meghalni? Vajon vágyódik még Tamás halála után? Felidézte magában ezt a vágyat, és kereste a vele járó édességet. De íme, semmi édességet nem érzett, ellenkezőleg, csömört és fáradtságot, mint amilyent szeretkezés után érez az ember.","Do you really want to die? Is he still longing for Thomas' death? He recalled this desire within himself and sought the sweetness that came with it. But behold, he did not feel any sweetness, on the contrary, he was ashamed and tired as one feels after making love.","Did he really want to die? Did he still hanker after a death like Tamás ’s? He focused his mind on that longing and looked for the sweetness associated with it. But now he could discover no sweetness, but, on the contrary, nausea and fatigue, such as a man feels after love-making.","Did he really want to die? Did he still long after Tamás’s death? He summoned this particular longing and waited for its sweet aura. But he felt no sweetness. Only tiredness. Depleted but full, to the point of queasiness he had experienced after lovemaking."
"Mihály mélyen elgondolkozott. Az élet tele van megokolatlan koincidenciákkal. Ez a Pater Severinus hátha csakugyan Ervin, és a hölgy Éva volt, akit Tamás emléke kísért...","Michael thought deeply. Life is full of unreasonable coincidences. This Pater Severinus may have been Ervin, and the lady was Eva, who was accompanied by the memory of Tamás ...","Mihály thought profoundly. Life was full of inexplicable coincidences. This Father Severinus could be Ervin, and the woman Éva, haunted by the memory of Tamás …","Mihály lost himself to his thoughts. A far-off country. Life was full of far-fetched coincidences. What if this Father Severinus was really Ervin, and the woman Éva, haunted by her brother’s memory?"
"- Egy szobát a signorának és a signorénak? - kérdezte előzékenyen a portás a szállodában, amely előtt megállt öreg konflisuk. Mihály igenlőleg bólintott. Millicent pedig nem értette, hogy miről van szó, csak fent jött rá, de nem tiltakozott.","- A room for the signor and the signor? asked the porter at the hotel, in front of which an old conflict had stopped. Michael nodded. And Millicent didn't understand what it was, she just figured it out, but she didn't protest.","“Will the signore and signora require a room?” was the obliging inquiry of the porter of the hotel outside which their hansom-cab had stopped. Mihály nodded in affirmation. Millicent, unaware of the significance of the exchange, simply went up, but registered no protest on arrival.","“A single room for the signore and the signora?” asked an obliging porter in front of the hotel where their ancient taxi came to a halt. Mihály nodded yes. As for Millicent, she appeared not to understand what was going on until they were upstairs, and even then she didn’t protest."
"- Miért? - kérdezte -, hiszen nagyon jó volt így is, és különben is szeretlek.","- Why? he asked, because it was very good anyway, and I love you anyway.","“Why?” she asked. “It was so good that way, and anyhow I love you.”","“Why?” she asked. “It was fine, even like that. Besides, I love you.”"
"- Figyeled, a szeme hogy jár, mi? Ki tud ilyet Pesten?","- You're watching your eyes, aren't you? Who knows that in Pest?","or: “How’s that for a pair of eyes, eh! You don’t see them like that in Pest” or:","“Are you watching her eyes? Wow! Who could do that in Budapest, eh?”"
"- Pedig olyan jó volt magával lenni, Mike - szipogta, és kezét Mihályéba tette.","""It was so good to be with you, Mike,"" he sniffed, placing his hand in Michael's.","“But it was so good to be with you, Mike,” she sniffled, and put her hand in his.","“But I’m having such a good time with you, Mike,” she pouted, using the endearing pet name she’d given him. And she squeezed Mihály’s hand."
"Csak a mécses nyugtatta meg kissé, a mécses, amely lobogott, és olyan árnyakat vetett a falra, mint egykor gyermekszobájában. A mécsesről eszébe jutott Vannina nagyon finom vonalú keze, amit az előbb bámult, anélkül hogy figyelt volna rá, mikor a lány a mécsest tartotta.","Only the candlestick calmed him down a bit, the candlestick that fluttered and cast shadows on the wall like it had once in his nursery. The candlestick reminded Vannina of a very fine-lined hand that she had been staring at without paying attention to her as she held the candle.","The only thing that calmed him slightly was the night-light, which flared and cast the sort of shadows on the walls he remembered in his room as a child. The night-light led him to think of Vannina’s finely-shaped hand: earlier, when it held the lamp, he had stared at it for some time without really paying attention.",The flutter of the lamp that threw looming shadows on the wall as in his childhood seemed a source of comfort now. The lamp made him think of Vannina’s delicate hands he’d stared at earlier when she’d held the lamp over his bed.
"Ervintől hallottunk először freudizmusról, szocializmusról, március-körről, ő volt az első közöttünk, akiben jelentkezett az a furcsa világ, ami később Károlyi-forradalom lett. Gyönyörű verseket írt, Ady Endre modorában.","We first heard from Frevin about Freudianism, socialism, the March circle, he was the first of us to appear in the strange world that later became the Charles Revolution. He wrote beautiful poems in the manner of Endre Ady.","“It was from Ervin that we first heard about Freud, Socialism, the March Circle.

He was the first among us to spout liberal ideas and subscribe to the strange world of progressive politics later known as the Károlyi revolution.

"Erzsi nem felelt. A perzsa megint megkísérelte kinyitni az ajtót, ezúttal, úgy látszik, már nekifeküdt a vállával. A bútorok egy kicsit engedtek.","Erzsi didn't answer. The Persian tried to open the door again, this time he seemed to be lying on his shoulder. The furniture let go a little.","She did not answer. Again he tried to open the door, this time, it seemed, with the weight of his shoulder. The pile of furniture gave a little.","Erzsi didn’t answer. The Persian experimented with the door again, this time, it seemed, with his shoulders. The furniture gave a little."
Vége,It's over,,
"Mihály elgondolkozott. Most kezdte igazán érezni, micsoda világok választják el Pater Severinustól, aki valaha Ervin volt.","Michael thought. Now he was beginning to really feel what worlds separated him from Pater Severinus, who had once been Ervin.","Mihály thought deeply. He was beginning to understand what sort of worlds separated him from Father Severinus, who had been Ervin … “How long have you been in Gubbio?”","For a moment Mihály was lost in thought. He started to sense that he and Father Severinus, and the person who was once Ervin were worlds apart."

"- Fenét salsifraga - gondolta Mihály. - Salsifraga a kövirózsa lehet. Mondjuk, hogy ez a Júdásfa.","""Damn it,"" Michael thought. - Salsifraga can be a stone rose. Let's say it's the Judah tree.","“Like hell it’s salsify,” thought Mihály. “Salsify would be the house-leek. This must be the Judas tree.”",How on earth could that be? Mihály thought. She was mispronouncing Saxifraga of the stone crop family. A Judas tree?
"Az első délután rettenetes volt. Tamás tartózkodó és főhercegi volt, csak időnként mondott valami egyáltalán nem odavaló dolgot, hogy megdöbbentse a burzsoákat. De Ervin és János nem döbbentek meg, mert nem voltak burzsoák. János beszélt egész délután, bálnavadászati tapasztalatairól és nagy üzleti terveiről a kókuszdió-termelés ügyesebb felhasználása körül. Ervin hallgatott, cigarettázott, és nézte Évát; Éva pedig egészen más volt, mint egyébkor. Nyafogott, kényeskedett, nőies lett. A legrosszabbul én éreztem magam. Úgy éreztem magam, mint a kutya, aki azon veszi észre magát, hogy mától fogva két másik kutyával kell megosztania eddigi monopóliumát, hogy az asztal alatt ülhessen, mikor a család ebédel. Morogtam, de sírni szerettem volna.","The first afternoon was awful. Thomas was an aloof and archduke, only occasionally saying something not at all worth it to shock the bourgeoisie. But Ervin and John were not shocked because they were not bourgeois. John talked all afternoon about his whaling experience and big business plans around the smarter use of coconut production. Ervin listened, smoked, and looked at Eve; And Eve was very different than ever. She whimpered, tender, feminine. I felt the worst. I felt like a dog realizing that from today, it would have to share its previous monopoly with two other dogs so it could sit under the table when the family had lunch. I growled, but I wanted to cry.","“That first afternoon was horrible. Tamás was aloof and aristocratic, contributing only the occasional totally irrelevant remark, pour épater les bourgeois. But Ervin and János were not épatés because they weren’t bourgeois. János talked the entire afternoon about his whale-hunting experiences and the plans of some big company to harvest coconuts. Ervin listened, smoked, and gazed at Éva. Éva was quite unlike her usual self. She simpered, she put on airs, she was womanish. I was utterly miserable. I felt like a dog discovering that two other dogs have come to share his privileged place under the family table. I growled, but really I wanted to howl with misery.","“The afternoon visit was a disaster. Tamás acted standoffish, aristocratic, occasionally spitting out uncouth remarks meant to shock our middle-class sensibilities. But he was wasting his time on Ervin and János who were anything but petit bourgeois. János dominated the afternoon with his stories about his whale-fishing sorties and his grandiose plans revolving around coconut production. Ervin kept quiet, smoked, and watched Éva. Éva’s demeanour changed in front of our eyes. She put on airs, acted coy, spoiled, irresistibly feminine. I felt awful. I felt like the dog fighting for a bone under the dinner table. I growled, but I would’ve rather cried."

"- Azt nem tudom. Úgy látszik, exorcizálta a kísértetet. Miután egy óra hosszat beszélgetett a hölggyel valami ismeretlen nyelven, visszament a hegyre; a hölgy pedig megnyugodott, és elutazott Gubbióból, és azóta senki sem látta, sem őt, sem a szellemet.","- I do not know that. He seems to have exorcized the ghost. After an hour of talking to the lady in some unfamiliar language, she went back to the mountain; and the woman departed from Gubbio, and henceforth saw no man, neither the spirit.","“That I don’t know. It seems he exorcised the ghost. After he’d talked with her for a full hour in some strange tongue, he went back up the mountain. She calmed down and left Gubbio. And after that nobody ever saw her again, or the ghost.”","“Now that, I don’t know. It seems he exorcised her ghost. After an hour or so of speaking with the woman in some strange tongue, he clambered back up the mountain. The woman was cured. She left Gubbio, and no one has seen her, or the ghost, since.”"
"- Még valamire kell, hogy figyelmeztesselek, de nagyon kínos, mert esetleg félreérthetnéd, hogy miért mondom.

You would even think jealousy speaks for itself.","“There is something else I must warn you about, but it’s rather painful because you might perhaps misunderstand my reason for saying it. Would you still think I’m speaking out of jealousy?”","“There is something else I have to warn you about, something rather awkward, and you may misunderstand why I’m bringing it up in the first place. You’re liable to think I was doing it out of jealousy.”"
- Ön nem francia?,- Aren't you French?,“You aren’t French?”,"The girl brooded for a moment, then asked Mihály: “You’re not French, are you?”"
"A pénzről Évának kellett gondoskodnia. Tamás előtt ezt a szót, hogy pénz, nem volt szabad kiejteni. Éva gondoskodott is; pénzszerzés dolgában rendkívül leleményes volt. Minden eladható holmijukat jó áron el tudta adni; időnként a ház muzeális értékeiből is el-eladott valamit, de ez nagyon kockázatos volt apjuk miatt, és Tamás sem vette jónéven, ha valami megszokott régiség hiányzott. Néha egészen meglepő kölcsönöket vett fel Éva, a zöldségesnél, a cukrászdában, a patikában, sőt a villanyszámla-inkasszánstól is. És ha mindez nem segített, akkor lopott. Lopott a szakácsnétól, halálmegvető bátorsággal lopott az apjától, felhasználva annak részegségét. Ez volt még a legmegbízhatóbb és bizonyos tekintetben legtisztességesebb jövedelmi forrásuk. De egyszer egy cukrász kasszájából sikerült kiemelnie tíz koronát, amire nagyon büszke volt. És bizonyára voltak olyan esetek is, amelyeket nem mondott el. És lopott tőlem is. Majd amikor észrevettem, és keserűen tiltakoztam ellene, lopás helyett rendszeres adót vetett ki rám, hetente bizonyos összeget be kellett szolgáltatnom a családi alapra. Tamásnak persze nem volt szabad tudni erről.","Eva had to take care of the money. Before Thomas this word, that money, was not allowed to be pronounced. Eve also took care; he was extremely resourceful in making money. He was able to sell all their things for sale at a good price; at times he also sold something from the museum values of the house, but it was very risky because of their father, and Thomas did not take it in good faith if some of the usual antiques were missing. Sometimes Eva took out quite surprising loans from the greengrocer, the patisserie, the pharmacy, and even the electricity bill collector. And if all that didn't help, he stole. He stole from the cook, stole from his father with death-defying courage, using his drunkenness. It was still their most reliable and in some respects fairest source of income. But once he managed to pick up ten crowns from the confectioner's coffers, which he was very proud of. And there must have been cases he didn’t tell. And he stole from me too. Then when I noticed and bitterly protested against it, instead of stealing it imposed a regular tax on me, I had to submit a certain amount per week to the family fund. Of course, Thomas was not allowed to know about this.","“It was Éva’s job to think about money. The word was not to be uttered in front of Tamás. Éva took charge. In such matters she was highly inventive. She could find a good price for anything they possessed which might sell. From time to time she would sell off some priceless museum-piece from the house, but this was very risky because of their father, and also Tamás took it badly if some familiar antique went missing. Sometimes she made really surprising loans—from the greengrocer, in the confectionery, in the pharmacy, even from the man collecting the electricity money. And if none of this worked, then she stole. She stole from the cook, she stole with death-defying courage from her father, taking advantage of his drunkenness. This was the surest and in some respects the least reprehensible source of income. But on one occasion she managed to lift ten crowns from the confectioner’s till. She was very proud of that. And no doubt there were other episodes she didn’t mention. She even stole from me. Then, when I found out, and bitterly remonstrated with her, instead of stealing she imposed a regular levy on me. I had to pay a certain sum into the family kitty every week. Tamás was of course never allowed to know of this.”","“Money was Éva’s responsibility. The word ‘money’ was not to be uttered in Tamás’s presence. Éva handled all financial affairs. She could be quite ingenious. She’d sell all their saleable belongings at good prices. She even resorted to peddling rare museum pieces, but this proved risky business because of the father. And Tamás didn’t take kindly to having a favourite antique go missing. Sometimes Éva surprised them with loans from the grocer, the sweet shop, the pharmacy, even the electric meter man. If still short on funds, she stole. She stole from the cook, and she stole from her father with death-defying courage, usually when he was drunk. This proved to be the most reliable, and in many respects, most decent source of their income. Once, she lifted ten koronas from a sweet shop cash register, a feat she was immensely proud of. No doubt there were occasions when she did things she didn’t brag about. She also stole from me. When I found out and protested bitterly, she found a way to levy a tax on me, and I was obliged to pay each week into the ‘family foundation’. Needless to say, Tamás was not to know about any of this.”"

"Vacsora közben keveset beszéltek, de meghitten és gyengédséggel, Erzsi tele volt vigasztaló jószándékkal, Mihályt fájdalma és a fájdalmában nagy mennyiségben elfogyasztott bor ellágyította. Elnézte, hogy Erzsi mennyire szereti még most is; milyen boldogság volna, ha ő is Erzsit szeretné, és meg tudna szabadulni a múlttól és a halottaktól. De tudta, hogy nem lehet.","They spoke little during dinner, but with intimacy and tenderness, Erzsi was full of comforting goodwill, and Michael was softened by his pain and the wine he consumed in large quantities.

But he knew it couldn't be.","During the meal they exchanged few words, but those were full of intimacy and tender feeling. Erzsi was filled with a loving desire to console, Mihály with his own suffering, and the great quantity of wine he got through in his unhappiness made him gentle.

"Mikor felemelte szemét, különös emberek álltak mellette. Egy gyönyörű szép és kétségkívül angol nő, egy beöltözött nurse és két nagyon szép angol gyermek, egy kisfiú és egy kislány. Csak álltak, zavartan nézték a sírt, egymást és Mihályt, mozdulatlanul. Mihály ott maradt, és várta, hogy majd csak mondanak valamit, de nem mondtak semmit. Egy idő múlva egy elegáns úr érkezett, éppolyan kifejezéstelen arccal, mint a többiek. Nagyon hasonlított az asszonyra, ikertestvérek lehettek, vagy legalábbis testvérek. Megállt a sír előtt, és az asszony rámutatott a sírfeliratra. Az angol bólintott, nagyon komolyan és zavartan nézte felváltva a sírt, a családot és Mihályt, és ő sem szólt egy szót sem. Mihály kissé odébb ment, mert azt gondolta, hogy talán őelőtte szégyellik magukat, de azok csak álltak tovább, időnként bólogattak, és zavartan egymásra néztek; a két gyermek arca éppolyan zavart és kifejezéstelenül szép volt, mint a felnőtteké.","As he raised his eyes, strange people stood beside him. A beautiful beautiful and no doubt English woman, a dressed nurse and two very beautiful English children, a little boy and a little girl. They just stood, looking confused at the grave, each other and Michael, motionless. Michael stayed there waiting for them to just say something, but they didn't say anything. After a while, an elegant gentleman arrived with the same expressionless face as the others. She looked very much like a woman, they could have been twin brothers, or at least brothers. He stopped in front of the tomb and the woman pointed to the inscription on the tomb. The Englishman nodded, looking very seriously and confused at the grave, the family, and Michael, and he didn't say a word. Michael went a little further because he thought he might be ashamed of himself before him, but they just stood there, nodding at times and looking at each other in confusion; the faces of the two children were as confused and expressionlessly beautiful as those of the adults.","When he raised his eyes some rather unusual people were standing beside him. They were an enchantingly beautiful and undoubtedly English woman, a second woman dressed as a nurse, and two lovely English children, a little boy and girl. They simply stood motionless, looking rather awkwardly at the grave, at each other, and at Mihály. He stood and waited for them to say something, but they did not speak. After a while an elegant gentleman arrived, with the same expressionless face as the others. He bore a strong resemblance to his wife: they might have been twins, or at least brother and sister. He stood before the grave, and the wife pointed out the inscription. The Englishman nodded, and with great solemnity and some embarrassment gazed in turn at the grave, at his family, and at Mihály. And he too said nothing. Mihály moved a step further away, thinking that perhaps they were discomposed by his presence, but they simply remained standing, nodding from time to time, and looking self-consciously at one another. The two children’s faces were every bit as embarrassed and blankly beautiful as the adults’.","When Mihály looked back up, strangers were standing next to him. A woman, exquisite and English from head to toe, a nursemaid in uniform, and two charming English children, a boy and a girl. They just stood there, absorbed but unmoved, looking at the grave, at each other, and at Mihály. Mihály stayed and waited for them to say something, but they didn’t. A bit later a distinguished-looking gentleman came up to them. He had the same blank stare as the others. He resembled the woman, presumably his wife, to such a degree they could’ve been twins or at least brother and sister. He stopped before the tombstone, and the woman pointed to the inscription. The Englishman nodded solemnly as he took a closer look at the words, a mere glance at his family, at Mihály, but not a word. Not one word. Mihály retreated a pace, thinking perhaps they were embarrassed by his presence, but they continued standing, nodding now and again, looking at each other with bewildering faces, the two children just as curious and as breathtakingly beautiful as the grownups. Mihály turned around and stared at them brazenly."

She was the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my life. No, that's not accurate either. She was a beautiful woman and I have been measuring all her beauty ever since. All my subsequent love resembled something, one with his feet up, the other with his head raised, the third with his voice on the phone.","“Ugly? She was the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen. No, that isn’t quite right. She was the one beautiful woman against whom I have since measured all others. All my later loves were like her in some particular. With one, it would be the legs, with another, the way she lifted her head, with a third, her voice on the telephone.”","“Homely? She was the most beautiful girl I’ve ever seen in my life. No, that isn’t quite right. She was so breathtakingly beautiful that since then all beauty is measured against her.

"Mindkettejükben feltámadt az a szenvedély, amely oly marcangolóan összefűzte őket, amikor Erzsi még Zoltán felesége volt. Akkor is mind a ketten védekeztek a bennük élő vágy ellen, de a vágy erősebb volt, és az ellenállás csak még vadabbá tette. Most is nagy ellenálláson keresztül érkeztek egymáshoz, a köztük történt és jóvátehetetlennek látszó sértések szörnyen szétválasztották őket, de csak annál erősebb lett a szenvedély, amely egymás karjába dobta őket. Mihály újra és a ráismerés csodálatos örömével fedezte fel Erzsi testét, amelyet mint testet, minden más nő testénél jobban kívánt most, Erzsi gyengédségét, Erzsi vadságát, Erzsi egész éjszakai lényét, ami semmiben sem hasonlított ahhoz az Erzsihez, aki a világosságban, szavakban és tettekben revelálódott, a szenvedélyes, szerelmes és szerelmében tudós Erzsit. Erzsi pedig azt szerette, mennyire ki tudja vetkőztetni Mihályt abból a letargikus közönyből, amellyel az napjainak nagy részét leéli.","In both of them, the passion had risen that bound them so badly when Erzsi was still Zoltán's wife. Even then, they both defended themselves against the desire that lived in them, but the desire was stronger, and the resistance only made it even wilder. Even now, they came together through great resistance, and the insults between them that seemed irreparable separated them terribly, but only the passion that threw them into each other's arms grew stronger. Michael rediscovered Erzsi's body again, and with the wonderful joy of realization, which he wanted now more than any other woman's body, Erzsi's tenderness, Erzsi's all-night being, which was nothing like Erzsi in light, words and deeds. revelated, the passionate, loving and loving scientist Erzsit. And Erzsi loved how much she could undress Michael from the lethargic indifference she spent most of her days with.","The passion that had driven them so painfully together when Erzsi was still Zoltán’s wife now rose again in both of them. During those months they had both tried to fend off their desire, but the desire had been stronger and opposition only made it more savage. Now again they met in the teeth of a major obstacle. All that had happened between them, the seemingly irreparable grievances driving them so violently apart, served only to intensify the passion that threw them into one another’s arms. With the miraculous joy of recognition Mihály discovered it all again: Erzsi’s body which, physically, he desired more than the body of any other woman, Erzsi’s gentleness, Erzsi’s wildness, Erzsi’s whole night-time being which was utterly unlike the Erzsi who was revealed in the words and deeds of daylight, the passionate, loving Erzsi, so wise in the ways of love. And Erzsi revelled in her capacity to strip Mihály of the lethargic indifference in which he spent so much of his days.","The awakening passion was the same one that had tortuously bound them together when Erzsi belonged to Zoltán. They had both fought against the desire, but the desire had always gotten the better of them, and resisting it just incited their passion. Once again they found each other through great conflict, separated by what had happened between them, by irreparable insults, which only seemed to heighten their passion and fling them into each other’s arms. Mihály rediscovered the pleasures of Erzsi’s body which he desired more now than that of any other woman: Erzsi’s gentleness, Erzsi’s wildness, Erzsi’s night persona, which in no way resembled her sensible daytime self and its prosaic words and actions. The lover Erzsi. The Erzsi who loved to strip Mihály of his apathy and rouse him from the numbness which settled on him most of his waking hours."

This city, where Theodoric the Great and Dante lie buried? This city, besides which Venice is a parvenu?”",“You mean Ravenna thrives on artificial fertilizer?

"Olcsó szobát bérelt egy olcsó albergóban - nagy választék ezen a kis helyen amúgy sem volt -, és vacsora előtt még egy kis sétára indult Spoleto sikátoraiban. A holdat felhők fedték, sötét volt, és a fekete város sikátorai fojtogatóan szűkültek össze körülötte, nem olyan ölelően, mint Velence rózsaszín utcácskái. Valahogy egy olyan városrészbe ért, ahol lépésről lépésre sötétebbek és fenyegetőbbek lettek az utcák, a szabadlépcsők egyre sejtelmesebb ajtók felé vezettek, embert már nemigen lehetett látni, az utat is elvesztette - és akkor egyszerre kétségtelenné vált, hogy valaki jön utána.","He rented a cheap room in a cheap albergo - there wasn’t a large selection in this little place anyway - and before dinner he took a short walk through the alleys of Spoleto. The moon was covered in clouds, it was dark, and the alleys of the black city narrowed choking around it, not as embracing as the pink streets of Venice. Somehow he reached a part of town where step by step the streets became darker and more threatening, the free stairs led to more and more mysterious doors, one could hardly see a man, he lost his way - and then it became doubtful that someone would come after him.","He took a cheap room in a cheap albergo—there really wasn’t much choice in this tiny place—and then set off for one more little stroll before dinner round the back streets of Spoleto. Clouds veiled the moon. It was dark and the narrow lightless alleys of the sombre town closed around him, but not in the welcoming way the little pink streets had in Venice. Somehow he ended up in the sort of district where, with every step, the lanes grew darker and more menacing, the stairways led to ever more mysterious doors. He could see absolutely no-one about—he had quite lost his way—and then he suddenly felt sure that someone was following him.","He rented a cheap room in a cheap albergo. Not much to select from in such a small town. Before supper, he took a brisk walk through the alleys of Spoleto. Clouds covered the moon, blackening the city’s already dark streets, and instead of embracing him as did the rose-coloured alleys of Venice, they constricted his spirit. Somehow he had come to a section where the streets became darker, more insidious with each step, where open walkways led to doors, each more enigmatic than the next. There was hardly a soul in sight when he lost his way — except for the person following him."
"Valamikor együtt nézték ezeket, Ervinnel, Ulpius Tamással és Évával, Tamás húgával, egy nagy francia könyvben Ulpiuséknál, ideges és megmagyarázhatatlan félelemmel, egy karácsony-éjszakán. Az óriási szomszéd szobában Ulpius Tamás apja magányosan járt fel-alá. Az asztalra könyökölve nézték a képeket, és a képek arany háttere úgy csillogott feléjük, mint ismeretlen forrású fény a bányafolyosó mélyén. A bizánci képekben volt valami, ami felkavarta bennük a lélek legmélyén alvó iszonyatot. Háromnegyed tizenkettőkor nagykabátot vettek fel, és gémberedett szívvel elindultak az éjféli misére. Éva akkor elájult; ez volt az egyetlen alkalom, amikor Éva idegeivel baj volt. Azután egy hónapig minden Ravenna volt, és Mihályban máig is Ravenna maradt a félelemnek egy meghatározhatatlan fajtája.","They once watched these together, with Ervin, Thomas Ulpius, and Eve, Thomas’s sister, in a large French book with the Ulpians, with nervous and inexplicable fear, on a Christmas night. In the huge adjoining room, Tamás Ulpius' father walked up and down alone. They looked at the pictures with their elbows on the table, and the golden background of the pictures gleamed towards them like light from an unknown source deep in the mine corridor. There was something in the Byzantine pictures that stirred the horror in the depths of the soul. At three-quarters of twelve they put on their overcoats and set off for the midnight Mass with a boomed heart. Eve then fainted; it was the only time Eva's nerves were in trouble. Then for a month everything was Ravenna, and in Michael, Ravenna remains an indefinable kind of fear.","Once in the Ulpius house he, together with Ervin, Tamás, and Tamás’s sister Éva, poring over these mosaics in a large French book, had been seized by a restless and inexplicable dread. It was Christmas Eve. In the vast adjoining room Tamás Ulpius’s father walked back and forth alone. Elbows on the table, they studied the plates, whose gold backgrounds glittered up at them like a mysterious fountain of light at the bottom of a mineshaft. Within the Byzantine pictures there was something that stirred a sleeping horror in the depth of their souls. At a quarter to twelve they put on their overcoats and, with ice in their hearts, set off for midnight mass. Then Éva fainted, the only time her nerves ever troubled her. For a month afterwards it was all Ravenna, and for Mihály Ravenna had remained to that day an indefinable species of dread.","It was on Christmas Eve. He and Ervin were at the house of Tamás Ulpius and his sister Éva; the four of them were mesmerized by the images in a large French art book. They pored over the mosaics with awe and inexplicable terror. The only sound in the house was the echo of Tamás Ulpius’s father pacing back and forth in the vast and empty room next door. With elbows on the table they stared at the images. In one, the gold tesserae of the background gleamed and beckoned toward them like a mysterious light at the bottom of a mineshaft. Something about that Byzantine picture stirred up a primal fear from the depths of their very beings. At a quarter to twelve they donned their heavy coats and with an icy feeling in their hearts set off for midnight Mass. Éva fainted. This was the only time Éva had difficulty with her nerves. Afterwards, for an entire month, it was all about Ravenna, and for Mihály, Ravenna continued to be a source of mysterious terror all its own."

"- Mert fel kellene jönnöd a kolostorba. Mi onnan nem jöhetünk ki, hacsak nem lelkipásztorkodási okokból, mint ahogy például most kijöttem erre a temetésre. És fent a kolostorban minden órának megvan a szigorú kötelessége. Csak egy mód volna, hogy nyugodtan beszéljünk egymással. Tudod, mi éjfélkor templomba megyünk, zsolozsmákat mondani. Kilenckor le szoktunk feküdni, és éjfélig alszunk. De ez az alvás nem kötelező. Ezt az időszakot nem szabályozza a regula, a hallgatás sincs előírva. Ebben az időben beszélhetnénk egymással. A legokosabb volna, ha vacsora után beállítanál a kolostorba. Jöjj mint zarándok, mi a zarándokokat meg szoktuk vendégelni. Hozz valami kis ajándékot Szent Ubaldónak, a testvérek kedvéért is. Néhány gyertyát talán, az szokásos. És kérd meg a kapus testvért, hogy helyezzen el a zarándokok szobájában éjszakára. Hát tudod, nem nagyon kényelmes, már a te körülményeidhez képest, de nem tudok mást mondani. Mert, hogy éjfélkor nekiindulj, és visszagyere a városba, azt nem szeretném, ahhoz ismerned kellene a hegyet. Annak, aki nem ismeri, nagyon barátságtalan vidék. Fogadj majd egy kisfiút, hogy felvezessen. Jó lesz így?","- Because you should come up to the monastery. We can't get out of there unless for pastoral reasons, like I just came out for this funeral. And every hour up in the convent has a strict duty. There is only one way to talk to each other in peace. You know, we go to church at midnight to say psalms. We used to go to bed at nine and sleep until midnight. But this sleep is not mandatory. This period is not regulated by the regulation, nor is silence required. We could talk to each other at this time. It would be wisest to set up in the convent after dinner. Come as a pilgrim, we used to host pilgrims. Bring some small gifts to St. Ubaldo, for the sake of the brothers as well. Some candles maybe, the usual. And ask the goalkeeper brother to place him in the pilgrims' room for the night. Well, you know, it's not very comfortable, given your circumstances, but I can't say anything else. Because to set off at midnight and come back to town, I don't want you to know the mountain. For the unfamiliar, it is a very unfriendly country. You'll pick up a little boy to lead you up. Will it be good that way?","“Because you’ll have to come up to the monastery. We are never allowed out, except on pastoral duty, like the funeral today, for example. And up in the monastery every hour of the day has its tasks. There’s only one way we could speak together without interruption. You know we go to church at midnight to say psalms. At nine we usually go to bed and sleep till midnight. But this sleep isn’t obligatory. The period isn’t governed by regulation, and silence is not prescribed. That’s when we could talk together. The wisest thing would be for you to come up to the monastery after dinner. Come as a pilgrim. We’re always receiving pilgrims. Bring a small gift for Sant’ Ubaldo, to please the brothers. A few candles perhaps, that’s the usual thing. And ask the brother at the gate to put you into the pilgrims’ room for the night. You realise it’ll be pretty uncomfortable compared with what you’re used to—but I won’t say anything more. Because, if you left at midnight to go back to the town, I’d be very worried. For that you would have to know your way about the hill. If you aren’t familiar with it, it can be a very unfriendly place. Hire a boy to bring you up. Will that be good?”","“Well, you’d have to come to the monastery. We’re not permitted outside except to minister to the flock. Like at this funeral. In the monastery every hour is strictly accounted for. We have only one opportunity to talk. Every midnight we go into the church to chant our psalms. Nine in the evening we go to bed and sleep till midnight. But we’re not required to sleep. There are no rules for those hours, including the rule of silence. We’d be able to talk then. The wisest thing would be for you to come up to the monastery after supper. Come as a pilgrim. We receive pilgrims all the time. Bring some small gift for Saint Ubaldo. For the brothers.

"- Ez is olyan európai elképzelés. Az igaz, hogy ha egy európai elkezd ópiumot szívni, az ő számára nincs megállás. Mert az európaiak mindenben mértéktelenek, a falánkságban, a házépítésben és a vérontásban egyaránt. De mi meg tudjuk őrizni a helyes mértéket. Vagy úgy találja, hogy árt nekem az ópium? Pedig rendszeresen szívom, sőt eszem.","- This is also a European idea. It is true that if a European starts smoking opium, there is no stopping him.

I smoke it regularly, and I eat it.”","“That is another European misconception. If a European starts to smoke opium, he does not know when to stop. Because Europeans are excessive in everything from eating to building to blood-letting. We, on the other hand, practice moderation. Or do you find that opium is bad for me?

"És amerikai volt. Mégis abból a fajtából, amely annak idején a csodálatos gyönyörűeket exportálta Párizsba, mikor Mihály még fiatal volt. Az „idegen nő” is az ifjúsághoz, a vándorévekhez tartozik. És később örök nosztalgia marad utánuk, mert az ember a vándorévek alatt még ügyetlen és gyáva, és elszalasztja a legjobb alkalmakat. Mihály most már sok éve Pesten élt, szerelmei mind pestiek voltak. Az idegen nő egy kissé az ifjúságát jelentette. És a felszabadulást, Erzsi után, a komoly házasság után, a sok komoly év után. Végre egy kaland, valami, ami váratlanul jön, és váratlan végkifejlet felé gravitál.","And he was American. Yet from the kind that exported the beautiful beauties to Paris at the time when Michael was still young. The “foreign woman” also belongs to the youth, the migratory years. And later eternal nostalgia remains after them, because one is still clumsy and cowardly during the wandering years and misses the best opportunities. Mihály has been living in Pest for many years now, his loves were all from Pest. The foreign woman meant a little bit of her youth. And liberation, after Erzsi, after a serious marriage, after many serious years. It’s finally an adventure, something that comes unexpectedly and gravitates towards an unexpected ending.","And she was American. Indisputably of that class of wonderful creatures exported to Paris in Mihály’s youth. The ‘foreign woman’ is an element of young manhood, of footloose youth. What remains in later years is the undying nostalgia, for in the footloose years we are still gauche and timid, and let slip the better opportunities. Mihály had now lived for so long in Budapest that his lovers had all been from that city. The ‘foreign woman’ now rather denoted his youth. And liberation: after Erzsi, after the serious marriage, after so many serious years. An adventure, at last: something coming unexpectedly and moving towards an unforeseen conclusion.","And she was American. From the same exotic species that were exported to Paris when Mihály was young. Exotic “foreign women” were also the province of youth and adventure, even though they left nothing in their wake apart from eternal nostalgia. Because during those adventuresome years he was naïve and afraid, and missed out on the most opportune moments. Mihály, for most of his life, had lived and loved in Budapest. And now this exotic foreign girl was rekindling the heady free-wheeling days of his youth. After Erzsi, it was liberation. After a proper marriage, after all those years of bondage, doing what was expected of him, being proper and respectable — finally, an adventure. Something that comes out of the blue, pulls him in and plays itself out toward its surprising yet inevitable conclusion."

My God, my God, better to be dead … ”","Pataki hung his head and took a huge gulp from his tea. Which one was it? Or was it both? Oh, God, my God, it would be so much easier to just die."

With us, people have always been built in the valleys, under the mountains, and here up the mountain, above the plain. What kind of image of an ancient enemy lived in the nerves of the founders, what horrors they always fled upward, under the protection of the steep cliffs? Where a hill grew out of the plain, a city was immediately built there.","“The land of the Franciscans, and the true hilltop town. Back home, they always built down in the valleys, under the hills. But here they build up on the hills, above the plain. Did those early founders harbour some obscure race memory of enemy attack? What was the terror that drove them ever upwards to the protection of steep rocks? Wherever a hill rose up out of the plain they immediately built a town on it.","Franciscan country. The classic hilltop town. Back home in Hungary, people always built their cities in the valleys, at the foot of a hill, but here they scaled up the hill, high above the flatland. What ancient enemy must have lurked in the minds of the city builders, what terror kept propelling them upward into the safety of steep bedrock? Wherever a hill reared up out of the flatland, they were quick to build a city."

So ... how can I say ... look, Michael, I know for whom you are in Rome. John said. He wrote to him that you had seen each other.","“Perhaps we should leave this—this question of my feelings,” Erzsi said with some exasperation. “They really have nothing to do with it. So … as I say … look, Mihály, I know perfectly well on whose account you’re in Rome. János told me. The person concerned wrote to him that you’d seen each other.”","“Maybe we’re better off to leave my feelings out of this,” said Erzsi hotly. “They have nothing to do with anything.

"De Mihály keveset tapasztalt a társaság vegyességéből és érdekességéből. Megint olyan lélekállapotban volt, hogy csak mintegy fátyolon át, ködön át érkeztek hozzá a dolgok: a nyári éjszaka fűszeres, magáért való boldogsága, összekeveredve a tánczenével, az italokkal és a nőkkel, akikkel elbeszélgetett, maga sem tudta, mit. Pierrot-kosztümje és dominója teljesen elvonatkoztatta: nem is ő volt ott, hanem valaki más, egy álmos dominó.","But Michael experienced little of the mixture and curiosity of the company. Again, he was in such a state of mind that things only came to him through a veil, through a fog: the spicy, self-blessed happiness of the summer night, mixed with the dance music, the drinks, and the women he had talked to, he didn’t even know what. Pierrot's costume and domino made him completely abstract: he wasn't there either, but someone else, a sleepy domino.","But Mihály experienced little of the variety and interest of the company. He was again in that state of mind in which everything seemed to reach him through a veil of fog—the scented enchantment of the summer night, blending with the dance-music, the drinks and the women he chatted to, he had no idea about what. His Pierrot costume and his domino mask and cape completely distanced him. It wasn’t himself there, but someone else, a dream-locked domino mask.","But Mihály experienced very little of this extraordinarily diverse and interesting mixture. Once again he was in such a mental state that he observed everything as through a fog or a veil: the summer night’s balmy fragrance swirling with the dance music, the cocktails, the women and the small talk, about what, he didn’t have the foggiest idea. Pierrot’s costume and its dominoes completely distracted him. If it was Pierrot. Or was it something else, just a drowsy domino?"

"Olyan buzgó katolikus volt, amilyenek zsidók szoktak néha lenni, akikben az évszázadok öröksége még nem koptatta el a katolicizmus nagy megrendüléseit. Nem úgy volt katolikus, mint az áhítatos és szegény sorsú osztálytársak, akik naponta áldoztak, kongregációba jártak, és egyházi pályára készültek. Azoknak a katolicizmusa alkalmazkodás volt, az övé lázadás, szembeszállás az egész hitetlen vagy közömbös világgal. Mindenről katolikus véleménye volt, a könyvekről, a háborúról, az osztálytársakról, a tízórai vajaszsemléről. Sokkal intranzigensebb és dogmatikusabb volt, mint legszigorúbban vallásos tanáraink. „Aki kezét az eke szarvára tette, hátra ne tekintsen”, ez a bibliai mondás volt a jelszava. Kikapcsolt az életéből mindent, ami nem volt egészen katolikus. Revolverrel őrködött lelki üdvössége fölött.","He was as zealous a Catholic as he used to be Jews, in whom the legacy of centuries had not yet wiped out the great upheavals of Catholicism. He was not as Catholic as his reverent and destitute classmates who sacrificed daily, attended congregation, and prepared for church careers. Their Catholicism was an adaptation, his rebellion a confrontation with the whole unbelieving or indifferent world. He had a Catholic opinion on everything, books, war, classmates, the ten o'clock buttermilk. He was far more intriguing and dogmatic than our most strictly religious teachers. “He who put his hand on the horn of the plow should not look back,” was the slogan of the biblical saying. He turned off everything in his life that wasn’t quite Catholic. He guarded his spiritual salvation with a revolver.","“He was a really devout Catholic, as Jewish converts often are. Their centuries of tradition haven’t been eroded the way they have for us. He wasn’t like his pious and impoverished schoolmates who worshipped every day, went to mass, and trained for a career in the church. Their Catholicism was a matter of conformity, his a form of rebellion, a challenge to the whole unbelieving and uncaring world. He took the Catholic line on everything—books, the war, his classmates, the mid-morning buttered roll. He was much more inflexible and dogmatic than even the most severe of our religious teachers. ‘ No man, having put his hand to the plough, should look behind him’. That text was his motto. He cut out of his life everything that was not purely Catholic. He guarded his soul’s salvation with a revolver.","“He was a fanatical Catholic, the kind some Jewish converts often are, for whom Catholicism’s great upheavals kept it from stagnating for century after century of orthodox tradition. He wasn’t a Catholic like his poor and pious classmates, who took daily communion, were active in the congregation and prepared themselves for a religious vocation. Their Catholicism was conformity, whereas his was rebellion, a stand against an indifferent Godless world. His opinions about everything had to be categorically Catholic: literature, war, his classmates, the bread he buttered at recess. He was more inflexible and dogmatic than our most severe religion teachers. The biblical proverb that says, ‘Whoever puts his hand on the plow’s handle better not look back,’ became his rallying cry. He purged his life of all things not wholly Catholic. And he guarded his spiritual salvation with a revolver."
"Mécsest gyújtott, és úgy vezette Mihályt, irdatlan, fehérre meszelt és teljesen üres termeken, folyosókon és kis szobákon át, ahol egy lélek sem járt, csak lépésük visszhangzott.","He lit a candle and led Michael through it, through desolate, whitewashed and completely empty halls, corridors, and small rooms where not a single soul walked, only their footsteps echoed.","He lit a taper and led Mihály through vast, totally empty whitewashed halls, corridors and smaller rooms, with no sign of a living soul: nothing but their echoing footsteps.","He lit a candle and led Mihály through barren whitewashed halls, tunnel-like passages and tiny rooms without a soul anywhere or a sound, other than their echoing footfalls."

Mihály, amikor félévi kínos töprengés után arra a határozatra jutott, hogy Erzsit, akivel akkor már egy éve viszonya volt, elválasztja az urától, és feleségül veszi, azért szánta el magát erre a következményteljes lépésre, hogy „mindent jóvátegyen”, továbbá, hogy komoly házassága révén végleg bevonuljon a felnőtt, komoly emberek sorába, hogy egyenrangú fél legyen például éppen Pataki Zoltánnal. Éppen ezért megfogadta, hogy minden erejéből igyekezni fog jó férj lenni. El akarta feledtetni Erzsivel, milyen jó férjet hagy el a kedvéért, és különben is, „mindent jóvá akart tenni”, kamaszkorára visszamenőleg. Pataki levele most meggyőzte vállalkozása reménytelenségéről. Olyan jó férj sohasem tud lenni, mint Pataki Zoltán, aki íme hűtlen és távollevő feleségét is, a távolságon át is, több gonddal és hozzáértéssel tudja megvédelmezni, mint ő, aki itt van vele, és a védelmező szerepére annyira alkalmatlan, hogy még a szálloda- és egyéb földi gondokat is Erzsi nyakába varrja, azzal a nagyon is átlátszó ürüggyel, hogy Erzsi jobban tud olaszul.","But the biggest trouble was not the material ones, but the morals ... Michael, when, after six months of embarrassing contemplation, he decided to separate Erzsi, with whom he had been in a relationship for a year, and marry him, to this consequential step, to “make amends for everything”, and to join the ranks of adult, serious people permanently through his serious marriage, to be on an equal footing with, for example, Zoltán Pataki. That is why she promised that she would do her best to be a good husband. She wanted to forget with Erzsi what a good husband she was leaving for her sake, and anyway, she “wanted to make everything right,” going back to adolescence. Pataki's letter now convinced him of the hopelessness of his venture. You can never be such a good husband as Zoltán Pataki, who can protect his unfaithful and absent wife, even over the distance, with more care and skill than he who is here with him, and so unfit for the role of protector that even the hotel - and sews other earthly problems around Erzsi's neck, with the very transparent excuse that Erzsi knows Italian better.","But the greatest problem was not financial but moral. When after six months of agonised deliberation he had finally decided to detach Erzsi, with whom he had been having an affair for a full year, from her husband, and take her as his wife, he had taken that momentous step in order to ‘atone for everything’, and indeed, through a serious marriage, to enter at last into man’s estate and become a serious person on the same level as, for example, Zoltán Pataki. So he had pledged to try with all his might to be a good husband. He wanted to make Erzsi forget what a fine spouse she had left on his account, and in particular he wanted to ‘make amends’ retrospectively for his adolescence. Pataki’s letter had now shown him the hopelessness of this undertaking. He could never become as good a husband as this man, who could look after a wife, so unfaithful and now so distant, with more care and skill than he, who was actually with her, but so unused to the role of protector that he had already had to load her with the responsibility of their hotel and other practical arrangements on that most transparent of pretexts, that she spoke better Italian.","A greater concern than money was one of morality. After six months of agonizing, Mihály had decided that Erzsi, who’d been sleeping with him for a year now, should separate from her husband and marry him. By marrying Erzsi, he had resigned himself to take the momentous step to do the proper thing and “set everything right”, so he could join the ranks of responsible men — someone exactly like Zoltán Pataki. He made a vow to himself to be a good husband. He wanted Erzsi to forget the good husband she had left behind for him, while he “set everything right” by atoning for everything all the way back to his adolescence. Pataki’s letter convinced him of the utter futility of his great enterprise. He can never be like Zoltán Pataki, who can look after his faithless and absent wife with more care and competence than he ever could. So ill-suited is he to the role of a husband that he saddles her with getting a hotel and other mundane burdens on the rather transparent pretext that she speaks better Italian."
"Alapjában véve Erzsi ehhez igazán nem volt hozzászokva. Gazdag, csinos, jól öltözött, mutatós nő volt, a férfiak vonzónak vagy legalábbis rokonszenvesnek találták. Tudta, Mihály ragaszkodásában is nagyon nagy szerepet játszik az, hogy Erzsiről minden férfi elismerőleg beszélt. Sokszor már arra is gyanakodott, hogy Mihály nem is a saját szemével nézi őt, hanem a többiek szemével. Mintha azt mondaná magában: mennyire szeretném ezt az Erzsit, ha én is olyan volnék, mint más ember. És most jön ez a strici, és neki nem tetszik. Nem állhatta meg, hogy ne tegye szóvá.","Basically, Erzsi wasn't really used to it. She was a rich, pretty, well-dressed, showy woman, found attractive or at least sympathetic by men. He knew that the fact that every man spoke appreciatively about Erzsí also played a very important role in Mihály's insistence. Many times he suspected that Michael was not looking at him with his own eyes, but with the eyes of others. It's like saying to yourself, how much I want this Elizabeth if I were like any other person. And now this pimp is coming, and he doesn't like it. He couldn't stop talking.","Basically, Erzsi was not used to this sort of situation. She was a rich, pretty, well-dressed, attractive woman. Men found her charming, or at the very least sympathetic. She knew it played a large part in Mihály’s continuing devotion that men always spoke appreciatively of her. Indeed she often suspected that he looked at her not with his own eyes but those of others, as if he said to himself, “How I would love this Erzsi, if I were like other men.” And now along comes this pimp, and he finds me unattractive. She simply had to say something.","Erzsi wasn’t used to being insulted like this. After all, she was wealthy, good-looking, well-dressed, and glamorous. Men found her rather attractive or at the very least congenial. She knew how much the admiration of Mihály’s male friends figured in his attachment to her; in fact, she often suspected Mihály of not seeing her with his own eyes but through the eyes of other men. As if he would say to himself: I could really love Erzsi if I were like other men. And now this low-life of a man had to show up and proclaim her unattractive. She couldn’t leave it alone without saying something."
"Pataki hallani vélte, hogy Erzsi hangját elfojtja a szívdobogás. Jó jel ez?",Pataki thought Erzsi's voice was muffled by the beating of her heart. Is this a good sign?,Pataki thought he could hear suppressed agitation in her voice. Was this a good sign?,Zoltán imagined that her voice was choked off by heart palpitations. A good sign?

"- Hagyjon békében - mondta Mihály kissé ingerülten. - Mondja azt, hogy agyvérszegény vagyok, és írjon fel kínai vasbort és brómot az idegeimnek. Az a maga dolga.","""Leave me alone,"" Michael said, a little irritated. ""Tell me I'm poor in blood and write Chinese iron wine and bromine to my nerves."" That's your business.","“Leave me in peace,” said Mihály, with mild exasperation. “Tell me that I have cerebral anaemia and prescribe iron tonic and bromide for my nerves. That’s what you’re supposed to do.”",“Just let me be.” Mihály was annoyed. “Tell me I suffer from iron deficiency in the brain. Prescribe red wine and a bromide for my nerves. That’s your job.”
"Lassanként a játékhoz is visszatértünk, de a játék sokkal kidolgozottabb lett, János kalandori és Ervin költői fantáziájával meggazdagodva. János természetesen kitűnő színésznek bizonyult. Állandóan túlszavalt és túlzokogott mindenkit (mert főképp reménytelen szerelmest szeretett játszani), úgyhogy meg kellett állni a játékban, és bevárni, amíg lecsillapodik. Ervin kedvenc szerepe a vadállat volt; kitűnően bevált mint az a bölény, amelyet Ursus (én) legyőzök, és nagyon tehetséges unikornis volt. Hatalmas egyszarvával minden akadályt, függönyöket, lepedőket, miegymást szét tudott hasítani.","We also slowly returned to the game, but the game became much more elaborate, enriched by the imaginative imagination of John the Adventurer and Ervin. John, of course, proved to be an excellent actor. He was constantly reciting and sobbing everyone (because he loved to play mostly a hopeless lover), so he had to stop in the game and wait until he calmed down. Ervin’s favorite role was the beast; he excelled as the bison Ursus (I) defeated and was a very talented unicorn. With his huge unicorn, he was able to tear apart all obstacles, curtains, sheets, and more.","“In time we got back to the play-acting, but the plays were now much more crafted, enriched by János’s escapades and Ervin’s poetical fantasy. János naturally proved a great actor. His declamation and sobbing were always over the top (because what he really wanted to play was unrequited passion). We had to stop in mid-scene for him to calm down. Ervin’s favourite role was a wild animal. He did a wonderful bison, slain by Ursus (me), and an extremely accomplished unicorn. With his single mighty horn he shredded every obstacle—curtains, sheets, and the rest of us put together.","“Gradually we returned to our games, and these became more and more extravagant, enriched by János’s bravado and Ervin’s lyrical fantasies. János naturally proved to be an excellent actor. He had no problem being overly dramatic and cried more passionately than anyone else (he loved the role of the dejected lover). Sometimes we had to stop a scene and wait until he calmed down. Ervin’s favourite roles were fantastic beasts. He was a superb bull, felled by Ursus (played by me), and his interpretation of a unicorn was brilliant. His enormous single horn pierced through everything, shredding curtains, bed sheets, anything at all."
"- Csak egy kis saját gyártmányú spenglerei-jel tudok felelni. Hogy az északi népek beléptek a keresztény népszövetségbe, az európai civilizációba, annak, ha emlékszel, az volt az egyik első következménye, hogy két évszázadon keresztül nem volt szó másról, mint a halálról: a X. és XI. században, a clunyi szerzetesi reform századaiban. A kora-román korban a kereszténységet az a veszedelem fenyegette, hogy a legsötétebb halálvallás lesz belőle, valami olyasmi, mint a mexikói indiánoké volt. De azután mégis előtört eredeti mediterrán és humánus jellege. Mi történt? A halálvágyat a mediterránoknak sikerült szublimálni és racionalizálni, vagyis magyarul, a halálvágyat túlvilági utáni vággyá hígították, átalakították a halál-szirén szörnyű sexappealjét a mennyei karok és rendek angyali zenéjű hívószavává. Most már nyugodtan vágyódhatott a hivő szép halál után; nem a meghalás pogány örömei után vágyódott, hanem a mennyország civilizált és tisztes örömei után. A nyers, ősi, pogány halálvágy pedig száműzetésbe ment, a vallás alatti rétegekbe, a babona, boszorkányság, sátánosság elemei közé. Minél erősebb lesz a civilizáció, annál jobban tudat alá kerül a halál szerelme.","- I can only respond with a small self-made spenglerei sign. The fact that the northern peoples entered the Christian People's Alliance, European civilization, was one of the first consequences, if you remember, that for two centuries it was nothing more than death: in the 10th and 11th centuries. century, in the centuries of Cluny monastic reform. In early Romanian, Christianity was threatened with the danger of becoming the darkest religion of death, something like that of the Mexican Indians. But then his original Mediterranean and humane character broke out. What happened? The desire for death was sublimated and rationalized by the Mediterranean, that is, in Hungarian, the desire for death was diluted into a desire for the afterlife, transforming the terrible sex appellate of the death-siren into an angelic slogan of the heavenly arms and orders. Now the believer could have longed for a beautiful death; he longed not for the pagan pleasures of death, but for the civilized and honorable pleasures of heaven. And the raw, ancient, pagan desire for death went into exile, into the sub-religious strata, among the elements of superstition, witchcraft, and satanism. The stronger civilization, the more subconscious the love of death becomes.","“I can only answer with a bit of home-made Spenglerism. When the people of the north came into the community of Christendom, in other words European civilisation, one of the first consequences was, if you remember, that for two hundred years everything revolved around death. I’m referring to the tenth and eleventh centuries, the centuries of the monastic reforms begun at Cluny. In early Roman times Christianity lived under constant physical threat, so that it became the darkest of death-cults, rather like the religion of the Mexican Indians. Later of course it took on its truly Mediterranean and humane character. What happened? The Mediterraneans succeeded in sublimating and rationalising the yearning for death, or, in plain language, they watered down the desire for death into desire for the next world, they translated the terrifying sex-appeal of the death-sirens into the heavenly choirs and rows of angels singing praises. Nowadays you can yearn comfortably after the glorious death that awaits the believer: not the dying pagan’s yearning for erotic pleasure, but the civilised and respectable longing for heaven. The raw, ancestral pagan death-desire has gone into exile, into the dark under-strata of religion. Superstition, witchcraft, Satanism, are among its manifestations. The stronger civilisation becomes, the more our yearning for death thrives in the subconscious. “Think about it.","“The best I can offer is my own version of Spengler. When the northern peoples joined the Christian community, or European civilization, one of the first consequences, you’ll recall, was that for the next two centuries they did nothing but talk about death. In the 10th and 11th centuries, during the time of the Cluny Monastic Reform. In the early Roman period, Christianity was in danger of becoming a dark death cult, something akin to that of the Mexican Indians. But eventually, its original Mediterranean and humane spirit prevailed. What happened? The people of the Mediterranean succeeded in sublimating and rationalizing the death-wish, in other words, diluting it as a longing for an after-life, thereby transforming the sexually provocative death sirens to the heavenly embraces of saints and the lure of angelic choirs as a call to religious life. The faithful can now safely long after a beautiful death. Not after the pagan joy of dying, but after the rapture in a heaven that was pure and beatific. The naked, ancient, pagan death-wish went into exile underground, into the rarefied layers of pseudo-religions, into superstition, witchcraft, Satanism. The more authoritative a civilization becomes, the more the romance of death lies dormant, lurking under our consciousness. “Consider this."
"Mihályt a levél mélységesen kihozta a sodrából. Nagyon émelyítette Pataki férfiatlan „jósága”, ami tulajdonképpen nem is jóság, csak férfiatlanság, de ha jóság, akkor sem sokkal rokonszenvesebb, mert Mihálynak nem volt valami nagy véleménye a jóságról. És ez az udvariasság! Hiába, Pataki csak kereskedősegéd maradt, akárhogy meg is gazdagodott.","Michael was deeply taken out of the stream by the letter. Pataki's unmanly ""goodness"" made him very nauseous, which isn't really goodness, just unmanlyness, but if it's good, he's not much more sympathetic, because Michael didn't have any big opinion about goodness. And this is courtesy! In vain, Pataki remained only a merchant's assistant, however rich.","The letter left Mihály very angry. He felt nauseated by Pataki’s effete ‘decency’, which, properly speaking, was not ‘decency’ but unmanliness, or, if it was genuine, then hardly more acceptable because he had rather a low opinion of that quality. And such obsequiousness! It was no good. Pataki, for all his acquired wealth, still had the soul of a shop-assistant.","The letter made Mihály furious. He was nauseated by Pataki’s “goodness”, which had less to do with goodness than male pride, and were it goodness, Mihály cared for it even less. He didn’t have a very high opinion of anything sanctimonious in the guise of goodness. And this patronizing politeness! Pataki would always be a shopkeeper’s assistant no matter how wealthy he’d become."

The Siena Primitives are probably almost identical to the Umbrian Primitives you saw in Perugia. And anyway, does it really matter whether you see ten pictures more or less?”","“Damn that infernal old witch,” erupted Mihály. “Look, Millicent, listen to me. Forget the Primitives of Siena. The Primitives of Siena are probably just like the ones in Umbria, and those you’ve already seen in Perugia. Either way, does it really make any difference if you see ten paintings more or ten less?”"

"De ahhoz, hogy színházba menjenek, pénz kellett, apjuk pedig, azt hiszem, egyáltalán nem adott nekik zsebpénzt.

But all this, of course, was not enough to satisfy the theatrical passion of the Ulpians.","“But going to the theatre requires cash, and their father, I am sure, never gave them pocket money. One small source of income was their cook, the slovenly old family housekeeper, who set aside a few pennies for the two youngsters from her housekeeping money.

But of course none of this was enough to satisfy their passion for the theatre.","“Of course going to the theatre required money, and their father was not one for handouts.

A trifle amount trickled in from their old cook, the scruffy manager of the Ulpius house’s earthly needs, who put aside a few fillérs for Tamás and Éva and once in a while the grandfather would unearth a korona or two from the most unlikely sources. I suspect some may have come from his tinkering with clocks. But none of this was nearly enough to satisfy the Ulpius’s rage for the theatre."

"Azután lementek a Campóra, a város kagyló alakú főterére, amely már alakjánál fogva is olyan volt, mint a város mosolya.

"- Mi van velem? Micsoda gyalázatos, legsötétebb kamaszkoromra emlékeztető idegállapotba estem megint? Ezeken az embereken nyilván semmi más különös nincs, mint hogy szégyenlős és rendkívül ostoba angolok, akik szembetalálkoztak azzal a ténnyel, hogy ez itt Keats sírja, és nem tudták, hogy mihez kezdjenek vele, talán, mert nem tudták, hogy kicsoda Keats, talán tudták, de nem jutott eszükbe, mit illik csinálnia egy jól nevelt angolnak Keats sírja fölött, és ezért szégyellték magukat egymás előtt és előttem. Semmitmondóbb és mindennapibb jelenetet igazán nem lehet elképzelni, és nekem mégis szívemre szállt a világ egész kimondhatatlan iszonyata. Igen; az iszonyat nem az éjszaka és a félelem dolgaiban a legerősebb, hanem akkor, mikor fényes nappal bámul ránk valami mindennapi dologból, egy kirakatból, egy ismeretlen arcból, egy fa ágai közül...","- What about me? What a disgraceful nervous state reminiscent of my darkest adolescence again? There is obviously nothing special about these people other than that they are shy and extremely stupid Englishmen who have encountered the fact that this is Keats' grave and didn't know what to do with it, maybe because they didn't know who Keats was, maybe they knew but they had no idea what a well-educated Englishman should do over the tomb of Keats, and therefore they were ashamed of themselves before and before me. A more telling and mundane scene is really unimaginable, and yet the whole unspeakable horror of the world has hit my heart. Yes; horror is not the strongest in the things of the night and fear, but when you are staring at us from something everyday, a shop window, an unknown face, the branches of a tree on a bright day ...","“What’s wrong with me? What sort of mental state have I fallen into again? It was like a dark, shameful reminder of my adolescence. These people were quite clearly nothing other than self-conscious, thoroughly stupid English, confronted by the fact that this was Keats’s grave and not knowing where to begin, perhaps because they had no idea who Keats was. Or perhaps they knew, but couldn’t think how to behave appropriately at the grave of Keats the famous Englishman, and because of this they were embarrassed in front of each other and of me. A more insignificant or banal scene you really couldn’t imagine, and yet I immediately thought of the most unspeakable horror in the world. Yes. Horror isn’t at its most intense in things of night and fear. It’s when you are staring in full sunlight at some mundane thing, a shop window, an unknown face, between the branches of a tree … ”","What was wrong with him? The state of his mind had all the trappings of the dark, abysmal days of his youth. What was his mind doing to him now? Probably nothing wrong with these people, except for… being English. They were reserved and remarkably dull people who had to face the fact that this was Keats’s grave, and they didn’t know what to make of it, perhaps because they didn’t know who Keats was, or they knew, but it didn’t occur to them how well-bred Englishmen ought to act when confronted with Keats’s grave, and that’s why they were embarrassed in front of him. It was hard to imagine a more meaningless and trite scene, yet here he was, victimized by this baffling all-consuming anxiety. Yes, anxiety was most intense when it went beyond night fears and gripped him by the light of day, lurking in everyday things, a store-front window, unfamiliar faces, the spaces between the trees."

"Mihály megállapította, hogy aludt már megnyugtatóbb környezetben is, de a környezetnél is inkább nyugtalanította, hogy az útlevele lent volt a zordon és egyben sunyiképű házigazdánál, aki nem volt hajlandó belemenni Mihály ravasz indítványába, hogy majd ő maga kitölti a bejelentőlapot, minthogy passzusa érthetetlen idegen nyelven van írva. A fogadós ragaszkodott ahhoz, hogy Mihály útlevele nála maradjon, amíg Mihály a fogadóban tartózkodik. Úgy látszik, rossz tapasztalatai lehettek. A fogadó egészben véve olyan volt, hogy fel lehetett tételezni, hogy gazdájának a legsötétebb tapasztalatok jutottak osztályrészül. Nappal valószínűleg csak lecsúszott vigécek járnak erre, gondolta Mihály, és éjszaka lótolvajok szellemei kártyáznak röhögve a sala da pranzónak mondott, konyhaszagú étkezőhelyen...","Mihály found that he had slept in a more reassuring environment, but even more disturbed by the fact that his passport was down at the harsh and at the same time sunny host, who refused to go into Mihály's sly motion that he himself fill out the application form, as his passport is incomprehensible to a stranger. is written in. The innkeeper insisted that Michael's passport remain with him while Michael was in the inn. Looks like you may have had a bad experience. The host as a whole was such that it could be assumed that its host had the darkest experience as part of the class. During the day, there are probably only slippery greets, Mihály thought, and at night the ghosts of horse thieves play cards in the kitchen-smelling dining room called sala da pranzo ...","Mihály decided that he had slept in more reassuring places. What worried him even more was that his passport was downstairs with the grim-faced, but no less sly-looking, proprietor, who had resisted his cunning suggestion that he fill in the registration form himself on the pretext that his passport was written in an incomprehensible foreign tongue. The innkeeper insisted that the passport should remain in his keeping as long as Mihály continued on the premises. It seemed he had had some bad experiences. The inn was indeed just the sort to guarantee its owner his fair share of those. During the day, Mihály reckoned, probably only down-at-heel revellers frequented the place, while in the evening horse-thieving types guffawed over cards in the so-called sala da pranzo, an eating area pervaded with kitchen smells.","There was no question he had slept in more tranquil surroundings, but what worried him now was that he left his passport downstairs in the hands of a shifty innkeeper, who refused Mihály’s cunning offer to fill in the register himself, on the pretext that his passport was in an unintelligible foreign language. The innkeeper insisted on retaining Mihály’s passport for the duration of his stay. It seemed the innkeeper had his fill of nasty experiences. By the looks of it, the hotel was the sort that would invite a lion’s share of nasty experiences. In daylight the place was an open invitation to derelicts, thought Mihály. But by night the ghost of horse thieves haunted the premises while they frittered away the hours whooping it up over cards in a kitchen-smelling dining hall."

"Beszédével teljesen le tudta foglalni hallgatóit. Valami romantikus átlelkesültség áradt ebből az emberből, valami középkorias, valami nyersebb és igazabb emberség, amit még semmi sem gépesített el.

Something romantic overflowed from this man, something medieval, something raw and truer humanity that nothing had mechanized yet.

"János aggálytalan módszerei nekem nagyon nem tetszettek.

"Párizsban felkereste gyermekkori barátnőjét, Tolnai Sárit. Sári már fiatal korában is férfias egyéniségéről és rendkívüli használhatóságáról volt nevezetes. Férjhez sose ment, nem volt ideje hozzá, mindig éppen égető szükség volt rá a vállalatnál, cégnél vagy újságnál, ahol dolgozott. Szerelmi életét oly futtában bonyolította le, mint egy kereskedelmi utazó. Idővel, mikor már mindentől nagyon undorodott, Párizsba emigrált, hogy ott új életet kezdjen, és folytatta ugyanazt, amit Pesten csinált, csakhogy most francia vállalatoknál, cégeknél és újságoknál. Mikor Erzsi Párizsba ért, éppen egy nagy mozigyár titkárnője volt. Ő volt az a bizonyos egyetlen csúnya nő a házban, a sziklaszirt, akihez nem ér fel a szakmával együttjáró erotikus atmoszféra, akinek a józanságában és elfogulatlanságában mindig meg lehet bízni, aki sokkal többet dolgozik, és sokkal kevesebbet keres, mint a többiek. Közben megőszült, és rövid hajával olyan nemes feje volt, mint egy tábori püspöknek, törékeny és kislányos teste fölött. Mindenki megfordult utána, és ő erre nagyon büszke volt.","He visited his childhood girlfriend, Sarai Tolnai, in Paris. From a young age, Sári was notable for her masculine personality and extraordinary usability. She never got married, she didn't have time for it, she was always in dire need of the company, firm or newspaper where she worked. He made his love life as running as a commercial traveler. Over time, when he was very disgusted with everything, he emigrated to Paris to start a new life there and continued what he had done in Pest, but now with French companies, firms and newspapers. When Erzsi arrived in Paris, she was the secretary of a large cinema. She was the only one nasty woman in the house, the cliff, who could not reach the erotic atmosphere of the profession, whose sobriety and impartiality could always be trusted, who worked much more and earned much less than the others. Meanwhile, with gray hair, he had a noble head like a camp bishop, above his fragile and girlish body. Everyone turned after him, and he was very proud of that.","In Paris she looked up her childhood friend Sári Tolnai. Even as a young girl Sári had been notorious for her somewhat unfeminine character and practical capability. She had never married, not having the time for it. It always happened that there was some burning need for her services in the company, the business or the newspaper where she was working. Her love life was conducted on the move, as it were, like a commercial traveller’s. In due course, having become bored with everything, she emigrated to Paris to begin a new life, and continued in just the same way, but in French companies, businesses and newspapers. At the time when Erzsi arrived in Paris, she was working as the secretary of a large commercial film studio. She was the statuary sole unattractive woman in the house, the pillar of stone who remained untouched by the general erotic ambience of the profession, whose common-sense and impartiality could always be relied upon, who worked so much harder, and expected so much less, than everyone else. Meanwhile, her hair had turned grey. Cut very short, it gave the head on her delicate girlish body the distinction of a military bishop. People would turn to stare at her, of which she was very proud.","In Paris she looked up a childhood friend, Sári Tolnai. From her youth Sári had been known for her manly independence and her practical ingenuity. She had neither time nor use for a husband. The demands on her time at the firm, office or newspaper were always all-consuming. She managed her love life on the go in the fashion of a traveling salesman. In time she got fed up with everything and emigrated to Paris to start anew, only to continue where she left off in Budapest, except that now she was at a French firm, office or newspaper. When Erzsi got to Paris, Sári happened to be a secretary for a large film studio. She was the odd bird in the office, the solid rock on whom the erotic climate of the workplace was lost completely, whose practical and no-nonsense manner could always be trusted, who always worked more and made less money than anyone else. Her prematurely white hair, cut into a short bob, presided over her girlish figure with the gallant military air of Jeanne d’Arc. She’d usually get a second look, and this was something she was rather fond of."

"De beszéljünk Ulpius Tamásról. Egy nap leesett az első hó. Alig vártam, hogy vége legyen az iskolának, és bekapjam az extraebédet, rögtön rohantam fel a Várba. A hó különösen nagy passzió volt nekem, és az, hogy hóban a városrészek egészen mások, olyannyira, hogy el is lehet tévedni az ismerős utcák közt. Sokáig csavarogtam, azután kimentem a Bástyasétányra, és bámultam a budai hegyek felé. Egyszerre megint megnyílt mellettem a föld. Az örvény ezúttal annál plauzibilisabb volt, mert csakugyan magaslaton álltam. Minthogy akkor már többször találkoztam az örvénnyel, nem voltam annyira megrémülve, sőt bizonyos flegmával vártam, hogy majd már újra összenő a föld, és az örvény eltűnik. Így vártam egy ideig, nem tudnám megmondani, meddig, mert ilyenkor éppúgy elhagyja az embert az időérzéke, mint álmában vagy szeretkezés közben. De annyi bizonyos, hogy ez az örvény sokkal tovább tartott, mint az előzők. Már besötétedett, és még mindig örvény volt. Ez a mai örvény nagyon makacs, gondoltam. És akkor rémülten vettem észre, hogy az örvény növekszik, hogy már csak mintegy tíz centiméter választ el a szélétől, és az örvény lassan-lassan közeledik a lábam felé. Még néhány perc, és végem, lezuhanok. Görcsösen belekapaszkodtam a korlátba.","But let's talk about Tamás Ulpius. One day the first snow fell. I couldn’t wait for school to end and grab the extra lunch, I immediately rushed up to the Castle. The snow was a particularly big passion for me, and the fact that in the snow the neighborhoods are quite different, so much so that you can get lost in the familiar streets. I wandered for a long time, then went out to the Bastion Promenade and stared at the Buda hills. At once the earth opened up to me again. The vortex was all the more plausible this time because I was really standing high. Since I had encountered the vortex several times then, I was not so frightened, I even expected with a certain phlegm that the earth would reunite and the vortex would disappear. So I waited for a while, I couldn’t tell how long, because then the sense of time leaves a person just as much as he does in a dream or while making love. But what is certain is that this vortex lasted much longer than the previous ones. It was getting dark and it was still a vortex. This vortex today is very stubborn, I thought. And then I was horrified to notice that the vortex was growing, that it was only about ten inches apart from the edge, and the vortex was slowly approaching my feet. A few more minutes and I'm done crashing. I clung to the railing convulsively.","“But to get onto Tamás Ulpius. One day the first snow fell. I could barely wait for school to finish. I gulped down my solitary lunch and ran straight to Castle Hill. Snow was a particular passion of mine. I loved the way it transformed the city, so that you could get lost even among streets you knew. I wandered for ages, then came to the battlements on the western side, and stood gazing out at the Buda hills. Suddenly the ground beside me opened again. The whirlpool was all the more believable because of the height. As so often before, I found myself not so much terrified by it as waiting with calm certainty for the ground to close again, and the effect vanish. So I waited there for a while, I couldn’t say how long, because in that state you lose your sense of time, as you do in a dream or in love-making. But of this I am sure: that whirlpool lasted much longer than the previous ones. Night was already falling and it was still there. ‘This one’s very stubborn,’ I thought to myself. And then to my horror I noticed it was growing in size, that just ten centimetres remained between me and the brink, and that slowly, slowly, it was approaching my foot. A few more minutes and I would be done for: I’d fall in. I clung grimly on to the safety railing.","“But getting back to Tamás Ulpius. It was the first fall of snow. I could hardly wait for school to let out, wolfed down the supper set aside for me, and charged up to the castle district. I was passionate about snow, the way it would transform certain sections of the city, so that it’s possible to get lost in familiar streets. After tramping about for what seemed like hours, I went up to the bastion and stared at the Buda hills. Suddenly the earth opened up again. From this great height, the abyss seemed more menacing. Since I had these attacks before, I didn’t panic. I kept my composure as I stood there and waited for the earth to close up again and for the abyss to disappear. I waited like this for some time. I can’t tell you exactly how long, since at times like this one loses all sense of time, like in a dream or while making love. But this attack was definitely longer than the others. It started to get dark, but the abyss was still there. This attack is relentless, I said to myself. I was near the edge when to my horror the abyss widened, inching closer to my feet. A few seconds more and it would be all over. I’d go hurtling down. I clung to the railing with an iron grip."
"Talán találkozhattam volna még vele. A következő években egyszer-kétszer lett volna alkalmam. János néha felbukkant, homályos célzásokat tett, hogy esetleg meg tudja csinálni, hogy láthassam Évát, és szívesen látná, ha szolgálatait honorálnám. De én akkor már nem akartam találkozni Évával; ezért mondta az előbb János, hogy én vagyok az oka, hogy elszakadtam ifjúságomtól, holott csak a kezemet kellett volna kinyújtanom... Igaza van. Mikor Tamás meghalt, azt hittem, megbolondulok - és azután elhatároztam, hogy megváltozom, kirántom magam ebből a bűvöletből, nem akarok úgy járni, mint Tamás, én rendes ember leszek. Otthagytam az egyetemet, kitanultam az apám szakmáját, kimentem külföldre, hogy jobban értsek a dolgokhoz, azután hazamentem, és igyekeztem olyan lenni, mint más ember.","Maybe I could have met him again. I would have had the opportunity once or twice in the following years. John sometimes showed up, making vague hints that he might be able to do it so I could see Eve, and she would love to see her services rewarded. But then I no longer wanted to meet Eve; that is why John said earlier that I am the reason I broke away from my youth even though I should have just reached out ... He is right. When Thomas died, I thought I was going crazy - and then I decided to change, I pull myself out of this spell, I don’t want to walk like Thomas, I will be a normal person. I left university, learned my dad’s profession, went abroad to get a better understanding of things, then went home and tried to be like any other person.","“Perhaps I might have been able to meet her. Once or twice in the following years there might have been a chance. From time to time János would pitch up out of the blue, make obscure reference to the fact that he could possibly arrange for me to see her, and would be happy to do so I if I would reward his services. But by then I had no desire to meet Éva. That’s why János said earlier tonight that it was my fault, because I walked out on the friends of my youth, when all I had to do was hold out my hand … He was right. When Tamás died I believe I went out of my mind. And then I decided I would change, I would tear myself away from the spell. I didn’t want to go the way he went. I would become a respectable person. I left the university, trained for my father’s profession, went abroad to get a better grasp of things, then went home and worked hard to become just like everyone else.","“Perhaps I could’ve still seen her. An opportunity arose once or twice in the following years. János showed his face now and then, dropped vague hints that he could arrange a meeting between Éva and me, and that he’d welcome some compensation for his services. But by then I was no longer interested in seeing her. That’s why earlier János insisted it was my fault, that I was the one who had severed ties to my youth, when all I had to do was to reach out a hand. He’s right. When Tamás died I had a nervous breakdown. I was afraid I’d end up like Tamás and I made a conscious effort to change, to pull myself out of the spell I was under. I wanted to be a respectable person. I left the university, learned my father’s business, travelled abroad to get a better handle on things, and then I went home and worked at being like everyone else."
"És ekkor Mihály kikelt az ágyából. Miután meggyőződött róla, hogy Erzsi alszik, a toalettasztalhoz lépett, amelyen Erzsi retikülje feküdt. Megkereste benne a csekkeket - mert Erzsi volt a pénztáros. Megtalálta a Nemzeti Bank két líra-csekkjét, mindegyik egyforma összegről szólt, az egyik az ő nevére, a másik Erzsiére. Kivette a saját csekkjét, és helyébe egy ugyanolyan alakú papirost csempészett be, a csekket pedig nagy gonddal eltette a tárcájába és visszafeküdt.","And then Michael got out of bed. After making sure Erzsi was asleep, she walked over to the dressing table on which Erzsi's purse lay. He looked for checks in him - because Erzsi was the cashier. He found two lira checks from the National Bank, each for the same amount, one for his name and the other for Ersi. He took out his own check and smuggled it in the same shape as a piece of paper, and put the check in his wallet with great care and lay back.","He climbed out of bed. As soon as he was sure she was still asleep he went to the dressing table where her reticule lay. He rummaged in it for the cheques (Erzsi was their cashier). He found the two National Bank lire cheques, each for the same amount, one in his name, the other in hers. He withdrew his own, and in its place smuggled in a sheet of paper of similar size. Then, very carefully, he put it in his wallet, and went back to bed.","Mihály got out of bed. Once he was sure Erzsi was asleep, he padded to the dressing table where her purse lay. He found the cheques — Erzsi was the banker — made out in liras in two equal amounts from the National Bank, one in his name, the other in Erzsi’s. He pulled out his cheque, and replaced it with a similar piece of paper. He carefully slipped the cheque into his wallet and went back to bed."
"- Igen. És most el is mesélem, mert talán ez a történet meggyőzi. Ugyanis éppen erről a szerzetesről van szó benne.","- Yes. And now I’m telling it, because maybe this story will convince me. This is exactly what this monk is all about.","“Yes. And now I will tell you about it, because the story might persuade you. It’s about that very monk.”",“Yes. And I should tell you about it for no other reason than to convince you. It’s about the same monk.”
"- Na, mit szólsz?!",- What do you say?!,“What are you saying?”,"“Well, what do you think, eh?”"
"Így is volt. Mihály vágya a távoli Erzsinek szólt, annak, akiről tudta, hogy majd elhagyja őt, és aki már inkább úgy élt benne, mint egy szép emlék. Azért is ivott annyit, hogy megőrizze magában ezt a hangulatot, hogy elhitesse magával, hogy nem Erzsivel van együtt, hanem Erzsi emlékével, Erzsivel mint történelemmel.","That's right. Michael's desire was for the distant Erzsi, the one he knew would leave him, and who already lived in it more than a beautiful memory. He also drank enough to keep that mood within himself to convince himself that he was not with Erzsi, but with Erzsi's memory, with Erzsi as history.","So it was. Mihály’s desire spoke to her across a distance, in the knowledge that she would leave him. Already she had become for him a sort of beautiful memory. He drank heavily to sustain this mood, to make himself believe that he wasn’t with Erzsi but with the memory of Erzsi. With Erzsi as history.","And that’s how things stood. Mihály’s longing was meant for a distant Erzsi, someone he knew would leave him and who was already living inside him as a beautiful memory. That’s why he drank so much, to persevere in his conviction that he wasn’t with Erzsi, but with Erzsi as a memory, Erzsi as history. In the meantime Erzsi was keeping pace with Mihály’s drinking."
"Közben öntudatlanul teljesítette keresztapai funkcióit, Vannina mellette állt és dirigálta. A szertartás végetértével kétszáz lírát adott az anyának, és nagy erőfeszítések közt megcsókolta keresztfiát, aki immár a Michele nevet viselte.","Meanwhile, he unconsciously performed his godfather functions, standing next to Vannina and conducting. At the end of the ceremony, she gave the mother two hundred lyres and, with great effort, kissed her godson, who now bears the name Michele.","Meanwhile he mechanically performed his function as godfather, with Vannina standing at his side directing him. At the conclusion of the service he gave the mother two hundred lire, and with enormous effort managed to kiss his godson, who now bore the name Michele.","Through all this he intuitively performed his godfather functions. Vannina stood next to him, guiding him. At the end of the ceremony he gave two hundred liras to the mother, and with great effort brought himself to kiss his godson, who had already been given the name Michele, which was Italian for Mihály."
"És azután csakugyan elért az örvény. Lábam alól kicsúszott a föld, és ott lógtam az űrben, kezemmel a vaskorlátba fogózkodva. Ha a kezem elfárad, gondoltam, le fogok esni. És csendben, rezignáltan, imádkozni kezdtem, készültem a halálra.","And then the vortex really did. The ground slipped from under my feet and I hung there in space, clutching the iron railing with my hand. If my hand gets tired, I thought I was going to fall. And in silence, resignedly, I began to pray, preparing for death.","“And then the whirlpool actually reached me. The ground opened under my feet and I hung there in space, gripping the iron bar. ‘If my hand gets tired,’ I thought, ‘I shall fall.’ And quietly, with resignation, I began to pray and prepare for death.","“The abyss reached me. The earth slid from my feet and I hung in space, my hand gripping the railing. If my hand gives, I thought, I’m going to fall. With quiet resignation, I prayed and prepared myself to die."
- Hogyan? Nem változott?,- How? Unchanged?,“How? She hadn’t changed?”,“What? She hadn’t changed?”
"Mihály nem tudott válaszolni, sértődött arccal bújt ágyába, és nagyon keserű érzéssel aludt el.","Michael couldn't answer, he hid in bed with an offended face and fell asleep with a very bitter feeling.","Mihály was unable to reply, but with an offended look climbed into bed and drifted towards sleep, full of bitter resentment.","He climbed into bed with a sullen expression and fell asleep, bitter and bewildered."
"Egyszer csak kopogtak. A parasztasszony egy ázott suhancot vezetett be; a háziak ismerték. A suhanc elbeszéléséből kiderült, hogy János átért a szomszéd faluba, de ott nem talált megfelelő szíjat, ellenben kificamította a lábát, és legjobbnak gondolja, ha az éjszakát ott tölti az ottani orvosnál, aki nagyon kedves ember. Kéri, hogy jöjjenek majd érte, ha az autót valahogy rendbehozták.","They just knocked. The peasant woman introduced a soaked snuff; the housemates knew it. Suhanc's narrative revealed that John had crossed into the neighboring village, but he could not find a suitable strap there, but he sprained his leg and thought it best to spend the night there with the doctor there, who was a very kind man. He asks them to come for him if the car is sorted out somehow.","Suddenly there was a knock at the door. The peasant-woman brought in a thoroughly sodden youth, who was obviously known to the host couple. From what the lad had to say it transpired that János had reached the neighbouring village but had not found a suitable fan belt there. However he had sprained his leg, and thought it best to spend the night with the local doctor, who was a most kindly man. He asked if they would come and collect him, should they somehow manage to repair the car.","There was a knock on the door. The peasant woman brought in a boy, drenched to the skin. He seemed to be an acquaintance of their hosts. From his message it quickly became apparent that János had reached the next village but could not find a fan belt. He did, however, succeed in spraining his ankle and thought it best to spend the night in the care of a kind village physician. He asked the others to come and pick him up once the car was operational again."

"- A halálvágy a legfontosabb mítosztermelő erők egyike - magyarázta tovább Waldheim, most már inkább magának és izgatottan. - Ha jól olvassuk az Odysseiát, hát másról sem szól az egész. Ott vannak a halál-hetairák, Kirke, Kalypso, akik barlangjukba csalogatják az utast a boldog halott-szigeten és nem akarják továbbengedni; egész halottbirodalmak, a lotophagok, a phaiakok földje, és ki tudja, nem halott-ország maga Ithaké is?... Messze nyugaton, a halottak a nappal mindig nyugatra hajóznak... és Odysseus nosztalgiája és visszatérése Ithakébe talán a nem-létezés utáni nosztalgiát, a visszaszületést jelenti... Lehet, hogy Pénelopé annyit jelent, mint kacsa, és eredetileg lélekmadár volt, de ezt egyelőre még nem tudom bizonyítani. Látod, ez olyan téma, amivel feltétlenül sürgősen foglalkozni kellene; neked is... Kidolgozhatnál egy részletet, hogy belejöjj a vallástudományi módszerbe. Például nagyon érdekes volna, ha írnál valamit Pénelopéról mint lélekkacsáról.","""The desire to die is one of the most important myth-producing forces,"" Waldheim explained, now more to himself and excited. ""If we read the Odyssey well, it's not about anything else."" There are the weeks of death, Kirke, Kalypso, who lure the passenger into their cave on the happy dead island and do not want to pass on; the whole realm of the dead realms, the lotophagus, the Phaiians, and who knows, not the land of the dead is also that of Ithak himself? it means nostalgia, rebirth ... Maybe Penelope means as much as a duck and was originally a soul bird, but I can't prove that yet. You see, this is an issue that should definitely be addressed urgently; for you too ... You could work out a snippet to get into the method of theology. For example, it would be very interesting if you could write something about Penelope as a soul duck.","“The death-yearning was one of the strongest sources of myth,” Waldheim continued, talking now rather to himself than to Mihály in his excitement. “If we read The Odyssey aright, it speaks of nothing else. There are the death-hetaira, Circe, Calypso, who from their caves lured men on to the journey towards the happy islands and never let them go; the whole empire of death, the Lotus-Eaters, the land of the Phaia. And who knows, perhaps the land of the dead was Ithaca itself? Far to the west … the dead are always sailing by day into the west … and Ulysses’s nostalgia for and his journey back to Ithaca perhaps represents the nostalgia for non-being, signifying rebirth … Perhaps the name Penelope actually carries its latent meaning of ‘duck’, and originally was the spirit-bird, but for the time being I can’t be sure of that. You see this is the sort of idea that really should be looked into without delay. And you … You could do the groundwork for a section, so that you can get into the professional way of doing things. For example, it would be really interesting if you wrote something about Penelope as the spirit-duck.”","“The death-wish is one of the strongest myth-making forces,” Waldheim explained, having worked himself up to a state of agitation. “If we pay close attention to the Odyssey, there is little else in it. Circe and Calypso are nothing more than death sirens enticing travellers to their caves on the happy isles of the dead, determined to keep them there. Entire realms of the dead, the land of the lotus-eating Lötophagoi, the Phaeacians, and then there’s Ithaca. Who knows if Ithaca is nothing more than a metaphor for death? The dead always sail westward with the sun. And Odysseus’s nostalgic longing to return to Ithaca is, perhaps, a longing for non-being, for a second birth. It may well be that Penelope, whose name means ‘duck,’ was originally a psychic bird, although this is something I have yet to substantiate. You see, here’s a subject in desperate need of further scrutiny. This is where you come in. You could work up a section just to get a feel for the methods of historical research. It would be rather interesting, for instance, if you could write something about Penelope-the duck as a psychic decoy.”"

"Tamás éppolyan mániákusa volt a régi dolgoknak, mint én. Nála nem is lehetett csodálni: egyrészt apai örökség volt, másrészt a házuk olyan volt, mint egy múzeum. Tamás számára a régiség volt a természetes dolog, és a modern a furcsa, idegen. Állandóan Olaszországba vágyódott, ahol minden régi és neki való. És íme, én most itt ülök, és ő sose jutott el... Az én vonzódásom a régi dolgokhoz inkább csak passzív élvezés és intellektuális vágy a megismerés után, Tamás vonzódása aktív fantázia-tevékenység volt.","Thomas was as manic of old things as I was. He could not be admired: on the one hand it was a paternal heritage and on the other hand their house was like a museum. For Thomas, antiquity was a natural thing, and modern is a strange, foreign one. He constantly longed for Italy, where everything is old and for him. And behold, I am sitting here now, and he has never come ... My attraction to old things is more of a passive enjoyment and an intellectual desire to learn, Tamás' attraction was an active fantasy activity.","“Tamás was just as crazy about old things as I was. In his case it was hardly surprising. Partly it was inherited from his father, and partly it was because their house was like a museum. For Tamás what was old was natural, and what was modern was strange and foreign. He constantly yearned for Italy, where everything was old and right for him. And, well, here am I sitting here, and he never made it. My passion for antiquity is more of a passive enjoyment, an intellectual hankering. His was the active involvement of the whole imagination.","“Tamás obsessed about old things the same way I did. It was no wonder since the mansion he lived in was not only an ancestral legacy but a museum. For him, anything antique was natural, but even the remotely modern was odd, strange.

"Az előbb, ott lent, a lámpa alatt, nagyon vágyódott a perzsa ölelésére. Nem a legegyenesebb vággyal, több volt benne a kíváncsiság, az egzotikum vágya.

Milyen furcsa és félelmetes az ilyen készülődés és várakozás!","Earlier, down there, under the lamp, he longed to embrace the Persian. Not with the straightest desire, there was more curiosity, a desire for exoticism. But then he didn't think it could come true. And now, in a short time, you will feel the volcanic glow you guessed in Persia with your whole body. How strange and awesome such preparation and waiting!","Before this, under the lamp downstairs, she had longed for the Persian’s embraces. Not perhaps with the most single-minded passion: there was more curiosity in it, a yearning for the exotic. For she had not thought at the time that it might become reality.

How strange and fearful was the preparation and the waiting!","A while ago, downstairs, under the lamp, she’d wanted the Persian to take her in his arms.

"Negyedik, ötödik vagy talán hatodik nap egy hegyi ösvényen érte az alkonyat. A lemenő nap rózsaszín és arany árnyalatai most, lázas állapotában is elragadták, sőt most talán jobban, mint józan korában; mert józanul restellt volna ennyire reagálni a szokott, régi és teljesen célszerűtlen mennyei színekre. Mikor pedig a nap lebukott egy hegy mögé, lázas ötlettől megragadva hirtelen felkapaszkodott egy sziklára, abban a hiszemben, hogy annak az ormáról még egy ideig láthatja a napot. De ügyetlen keze rossz helyen kapaszkodott, lecsúszott az útmenti árokba, és akkor már nem volt annyi ereje, hogy felkeljen. Ott maradt fekve.","On the fourth, fifth, or perhaps sixth day, it reached dusk on a mountain trail. The shades of pink and gold of the setting sun captivated him now, even in his feverish state, and perhaps now more than in his sober age; for it would have been sober to react so much to the usual, old, and utterly impractical colors of heaven. And when the sun had set behind a mountain, he was seized by a feverish idea and suddenly climbed a rock, believing that he could see the sun from its ridge for some time to come. But his clumsy hand clung to the wrong place, slipped into the roadside ditch, and at that time he no longer had the strength to get up. He stayed there.","On the fourth, fifth or perhaps sixth day, on a narrow mountain path, he became aware of the sunset. The pink and gold hues of the setting sun were, to his fevered condition, quite overwhelming, even more so perhaps than when he was rational. In his saner moments he would have been ashamed to respond so strongly to the familiar, banal and utterly meaningless colours of the sky. But as the sun went down behind a mountain he suddenly clambered impulsively onto a rock, seized with the feverish notion that from its top he would be able to watch for a little longer. In his clumsiness he took a wrong hold and slithered down into the ditch beside the road, where he no longer had the strength to get up. There he remained prostrate.","On the fourth, fifth, or maybe sixth day, the setting sun followed him along a mountain trail. The sunset’s gold and roseate colours enchanted him more in this feverish state than when he was utterly sure of his senses, because then he would’ve been too self-conscious to react so dramatically to these familiar, old and totally meaningless changing colours in the sky. When the sun was going down behind a mountain, he was seized by a feverish impulse to pull himself up by an outcropping of wall to keep watching it go down. His clumsy hand grasped a loose stone and he came tumbling down until he dropped into a roadside ditch. With no strength left in him to get up, he lay there helpless."

"- De ez nem az a vonat - mondta az olasz olyan gyönyörűséggel, mintha élete legjobb tréfáját hallaná. - A római vonat már előbb elment. Ez a Perugia-Ancona-i vonat. Terontolában van a szétágazás. Óriási! És a signore nyugodtan utazik Róma felé!","""But this is not the train,"" the Italian said, as if he heard the best joke of his life. - The Roman train is gone. This is the train from Perugia to Ancona. The branch is in Terontola. Giant! And the signore travels calmly to Rome!","“But that wasn’t this train,” the Italian replied with glee, as if this was the greatest joke of his life. “The train to Roma went earlier. This is the Perugia-Ancona train. The line forks at Terontola. Wonderful! And the signora is happily on her way to Roma.”","“But this is not the same train,” said the man, astonished, as if he just heard the world’s best joke. “The train to Roma already left.

"Hogy miért katolizált? Nyilván azért, mert a katolicizmus számára idegenszerű szépsége vonzotta. És vonzotta a hittételek és erkölcsi parancsok kérlelhetetlen szigorúsága. Azt hiszem, volt benne valami, ami az aszkézis felé vágyódott, mint ahogy más ember élvezetek után sóvárog. Szóval mindazok az okok, amikért más is meg szokott térni, és buzgó katolikus lesz. És azonkívül még valami, amit akkor még nem láttam ilyen tisztán. Ervin is, mint engem kivéve az Ulpius-házban mindenki, szerepjátszó természet volt. Ha most visszagondolok, kisdiák korától kezdve állandóan megjátszott valamit. Megjátszotta az intellektuelt és a forradalmárt. Nem volt közvetlen és természetes, mint ahogy illene lenni, távolról sem volt az. Minden szava és mozdulata stilizált volt. Régies szavakat használt, zárkózott volt, állandóan a nagy szereplehetőségeket kereste. De nem úgy játszott, mint az Ulpiusok, akik a következő pillanatban elfelejtkeztek szerepükről, és másik játékba kezdtek: egész életével meg akart játszani egy szerepet, és a katolicizmusban megtalálta végre a nagy, méltó és nehéz szerepet. Többet azután nem is változtatott attitűdöt, és a szerep befelé egyre mélyült.","Why did you Catholicize? Probably because he was attracted to Catholicism by its alien beauty. And he was attracted by the relentless rigor of beliefs and moral commandments. I think there was something about it that longed for asceticism, as other people long for pleasures. So all the reasons others tend to convert and become a zealous Catholic. And besides, something I hadn’t seen so clearly at the time. Ervin, like everyone else in the House of Ulpius, was a role-playing nature. If I think back now, he’s been playing something all the time since he was a little student. He played the intellectual and the revolutionary. It was not as direct and natural as it should be, it was far from it. Every word and move was stylized. He used old words, was aloof, constantly looking for great role opportunities. But he did not play like the Ulpians, who for the next moment forgot their role and began another game: he wanted to play a role all his life, and he finally found a big, worthy, and difficult role in Catholicism. He didn’t even change his attitude after that, and the role deepened inward.","“Why did he become a Catholic? Ostensibly, because he was drawn to the strange beauty of the religion. He was also attracted by the dogma and the harshness of its moral code. I do believe there was something in him that craved austerity the way other people crave pleasure. In a word, all the usual reasons why outsiders convert … And he became a model Catholic. But there was another side to it too, which I didn’t see so clearly at the time. Ervin, like everyone else in the Ulpius house except me, was a role-player by nature. When I think back now, even as a younger pupil he was always playing at being something. He played the intellectual and the revolutionary. He was never relaxed and natural, the way a boy should be, not by a long way. Every word and gesture was studied. He used archaic words, he was always aloof, always wanting the biggest role for himself. But his acting wasn’t like Tamás’s and Éva’s. They would just walk away from their part the moment it was over and look for something new. He wanted a role to fill with his whole being, and in the Catholic religion he finally found the hugely demanding role he could respect. After that he never altered his posture again. The part just grew deeper and deeper.","“Why? Apparently he was drawn to the religion’s exotic beauty. And to the doctrines and to the implacable severity of the moral commandments. I believe there was something in him that craved the ascetic life. Just as another may crave earthly pleasures. In other words, the usual reasons which make others convert and become zealous Catholics. But there was something else which I didn’t see at the time. Ervin, like everyone else at the Ulpius house, except for me, was a natural actor. As I recall, even from his early school days he was always playing some role. Often it was the intellectual and the revolutionary. His manner wasn’t naturally carefree, like most boys, not even remotely. His every word and movement were, how should I put it… stylized. He used archaic words, stayed aloof and always sought grandiose roles. He acted differently from Tamás and Éva, who would forget their roles the moment they ended and go on to the next play. Ervin wanted his whole life to be one great act, and in Catholicism he found at last his greatest and most difficult role, one that was worthy of himself. After that he stopped playing games, but that one role endured and continued to deepen."

"Akkoriban nagyon el voltam keseredve, főképp apám miatt. Az érettségi után beiratkoztam az egyetemre bölcsésznek. Apám több ízben megkérdezte, hogy mi akarok lenni, mire azt feleltem, hogy vallástörténész. - És miből akarsz élni? - kérdezte apám. Erre a kérdésre nem tudtam felelni, és nem is akartam gondolkozni rajta. Tudtam, hogy apám azt akarja, hogy dolgozzam a vállalatnál. Egyetemi stúdiumaim ellen nem volt súlyosabb kifogása, mert úgy gondolta, hogy csak díszére fog válni a vállalatnak, ha az egyik beltag doktor lesz. Az egyetemet végeredményben én is csak úgy tekintettem, mint néhány évi haladékot. Időt nyerni, mielőtt felnőtt leszek.","I was very bitter at the time, mainly because of my father. After graduation, I enrolled in college as a humanities. My father repeatedly asked me what I wanted to be, and I replied that he was a religious historian. - And what do you want to live on? my father asked. I couldn’t answer that question, and I didn’t even want to think about it. I knew my dad wanted me to work for the company. He had no major objections to my college studies because he thought it would only become an ornament for the company if one of the inmates became a doctor. In the end, I also saw the university as just a few years off. To gain time before I grow up.","“At that time I was in utter despair, mainly because of my father. When I matriculated I enrolled as a philosophy student at the university. My father asked me several times what I wanted to be, and I told him a religious historian. ‘ And how do you propose to earn your living?’ he would ask. I couldn’t answer that, and I didn’t want to think about it. I knew he wanted me to work in the firm. He had no real objection to my university studies because he thought it would simply give status to the firm if one of the partners had a doctorate. For my part, I looked on university, in the last analysis, as a few years’ delay. To gain a bit of time, before becoming an adult.","You can see I’m still here. “I was very depressed in those days, mostly because of my father. After graduating, I had registered at the university’s school of philosophy. My father kept asking what I wanted to be, to which I replied: ‘A historian. Of philosophy and religion.’ ‘And how will you live?’ he’d ask. I didn’t answer. I didn’t want to think about it. My father wanted me to work at his company. He had no special objections to my university studies, thinking it would be an honour for the company to have one of its partners hold a doctorate. What I was really doing was spending a few years at the university as a way of postponing life. To gain some time before the onslaught of adulthood."
"Ezen az éjszakán, mikor Erzsi új Erzsi volt és egyben történelmi, emlék-Erzsi is, és amikor Pataki Zoltán levele és az Ulpiusok körülötte kerengő emléke mélyen megrendítette, Mihály megfeledkezett régebben tett fogadalmáról, és házaséletébe olyan elemeket vitt bele, amiket Erzsitől mindig távol akart tartani. A szerelemnek bizonyos kamaszos, fiatal fiúk és szűz lányok közt divatozó módjára gondolunk, amellyel a gyönyört kerülő úton meg lehet szerezni és minden felelősség nélkül. Vannak emberek, akik mint Mihály, ezt a felelőtlen gyönyört jobban szeretik a teljes komolyságú és szinte hivatalos jellegű élvezeteknél. De Mihály önmaga előtt is mérhetetlenül szégyellte ezt a hajlandóságot, mert tisztában volt kamaszosságával, kamaszkori kötöttségével, és mikor Erzsivel, igazán komoly, felnőtt szerelmével intimitásba került, elhatározta, hogy Erzsivel mindig csak a hivatalos szerelmi formák közt fog érintkezni, mint ahogy illik két komoly, felnőtt szerelmeshez.","On this night, when Erzsi was a new Erzsi and also a historical, memorial Erzsi, and when the letter of Zoltán Pataki and the memory of the Ulpius around him shook him deeply, Mihály forgot his old vow and introduced elements into his marriage that he always wanted away from Erzssi. to keep. We think of the fashionable way of love between certain adolescent young boys and virgin girls that can be used to get pleasure on the detour and without any responsibility. There are people who, like Michael, prefer this irresponsible pleasure to pleasures of a full-blown and almost official nature. But Mihály was immeasurably ashamed of this inclination in himself, because he was aware of his adolescence, his adolescence, and when he became intimate with Erzsi, his really serious adult love, he decided that he would always come into contact with Erzsivi only between two serious forms of love. for adult lovers.","That night, when she was at once the new Erzsi and the Erzsi of history, Erzsi-as-memory, when Zoltán Pataki’s letter, with its implicit reminder of the Ulpius days, had so deeply shaken him, Mihály forgot his long-standing resolution and admitted elements into his married life which he had always wanted to keep away from Erzsi. There is a kind of lovemaking fashionable among certain adolescent boys and still-virgin girls, which lets them seek pleasure in a roundabout way, avoiding all responsibility. And there are people, like Mihály, who actually prefer this irresponsible form of pleasure to the serious, adult, and, as it were, officially approved variety. But Mihály, in his heart, would have been thoroughly ashamed to acknowledge this inclination, being fully aware of its adolescent nature, of its adolescent limitations. Once he had arrived at a truly serious adult relationship with Erzsi he had determined it would express itself only along the ‘officially approved lines’, as befitting two serious-minded adult lovers.","That night, while Erzsi was new yet historical, the Erzsi of his memory, and he was still dazed by Zoltán Pataki’s letter, and with his own memories of the Ulpius house swirling in his head, Mihály forgot himself and introduced into his married life certain things he vowed to keep from Erzsi. A certain practice adolescent boys and virgin girls indulged in, where it was possible to achieve climax without any responsibility. There are men who, like Mihály, prefer this carefree variety of pleasure to earnest and official lovemaking. Mihály was immensely ashamed of this tendency, knowing it for the adolescent fixation that it was, and once he and Erzsi had become more intimate, he vowed to be earnest and official, doing only what was proper between two serious, adult lovers."
"Azzal magához húzta Mihályt, és erősen megcsókolta, könnyes szemmel, szánalomból. János felnevetett - bravó -, kiáltotta, Mihály zavarba jött.","With that, he pulled Michael close and kissed her tightly, with teary eyes and pity. John laughed - bravo - and shouted, Michael was embarrassed.","With that she pulled Mihály to her and kissed him fiercely, with tears in her eyes. János laughed out loud and cried “Bravo!” Mihály was overcome with embarrassment.","Teary-eyed, she drew Mihály to herself and kissed him full on the mouth. János’s laugh was shrill. “Bravo,” he shouted and succeeded in embarrassing Mihály."

"Az órák kellemes kábulatban teltek, már nagyon késő volt, és most megint ott fent állt a pázsitos kis domb tetején, a pinea alatt, és megint azokat a különös, megmagyarázhatatlan hangokat hallotta, amelyek az éjszaka folyamán újra és újra nyugtalanították.","The hours passed in a pleasant daze, it was very late, and now he was standing up there again at the top of the grassy little hill under the pinea, and again he heard the strange, inexplicable sounds that disturbed him again and again during the night.","The hours passed in a pleasant daze.

Ez éppolyan, mintha azért aggódnék, hogy a párizsi munkások túlságosan sok pezsgőt isznak. És ha a párizsi gazdagoknak nem tiltják meg, hogy pezsgőt igyanak, amikor kedvük van, mi jogon tiltják meg a kínaiaknak?","""Ma chère,"" the Persian said with surprising temper, ""don't talk about something you don't understand."" He is being misled by the silly humanitarian rhetoric of European newspapers. How could opium harm the “poor” Chinese? Do you think they have money for opium? They're happy to have enough rice. Opium in China is smoked only by the very rich because it is expensive and the privilege of the privileged like other good things in this world. It’s as if I’m worried that Parisian workers are drinking too much champagne. And if the rich in Paris are not forbidden from drinking champagne when they feel like it, what right is it forbidden to the Chinese?","“Ma chère,” said the Persian with unexpected anger, “you shouldn’t talk of things you know nothing about. You’ve been taken in by the stupid humanitarian platitudes of the European newspapers. How could this opium harm the ‘destitute’ Chinese? Do you think those people have money for opium? They’re glad of a bellyful of rice. In China only the very rich smoke opium, because it is expensive and the prerogative of the wealthy, like all the other good things of this world. It’s as if I were to start worrying about the excessive amounts of champagne consumed by the working classes of Paris. And if they don’t stop the Parisian rich drinking champagne when they want to, by what right do they meddle with the Chinese?”","“Ma chère,” said the Persian with surprising fury, “do not speak about things you do not understand. You are deceived by the European newspapers and their foolish humanitarian slogans. How could opium be bad for the ‘poor’ Chinese? Do you think they have money for opium? They are happy to afford a bowl of rice. In China only the very rich smoke it because it is expensive, and like many good things in this world, it is enjoyed by the privileged. Now, should I worry about how much champagne the working classes drink in Paris? It is the same thing.

"Mihály a katedrálisból kijövet, a Via de Consolira kanyarodott be. - Ez az utca, amelyről Ellesley beszélt - gondolta. Erről az utcáról csakugyan sok mindent el lehetett hinni.

It was a street to make the imagination riot: medieval houses, blackened by age, with a bleak, penniless dignity, and, one suspected, inhabitants to match, people living off bread and water in the shadow of a glorious past that had vanished centuries before.","Mihály emerged from the cathedral and turned into the Via dei Consoli, the street Ellesley mentioned.

It's very difficult to tell you anything at all, Michael. A clueless and clueless pilgrim like you rarely comes to Sant Ubaldo.

"- És azután következik majd Pest megdolgozása - folytatta Erzsi. - Olyan híredet költi majd, hogy nem mehetsz végig az utcán. Hiszen istenem, tudom, hogy az a becstelenség, amit el akartál követni, nem olyan ritka becstelenség, rengetegen szaladgálnak Pesten, akik valamilyen formában eladták a feleségüket, és általános tiszteletnek örvendenek, különösen ha szépen kerestek és Isten áldása kísérte további üzleteiket - de Zoltán majd gondoskodik róla, hogy a heti sajtó és a közvélemény többi irányítója úgy tálalja a dolgot, hogy ne mehess végig az utcán. Kint kell majd maradnod külföldön, amit te nem fogsz nagyon bánni, de a családod alig fog tudni támogatni, vagy egyáltalán nem, mert Zoltán bizonyára minden tőle telhetőt el fog követni, hogy tönkretegye apád vállalatát.","""And then Pest's work will follow,"" Erzsi continued. ""You're going to have a reputation for not being able to walk down the street."" For God's sake, I know that the dishonesty you wanted to commit is not such a rare dishonesty, there are plenty of people running around Pest who have sold their wives in some form and enjoy general respect, especially if they earned a nice deal and God's blessing accompanied their further business - but Zoltán will make sure the weekly press and other public opinion leaders serve the thing so you can’t go down the street. You will have to stay abroad, which you will not regret much, but your family will hardly be able to support or not at all, because Zoltán will surely do his best to ruin your father's company.","“And after that he’ll get to work in Pest,” Erzsi continued. “He’ll make up such a story about you, you won’t be able to walk down the street. Because, my God, I know that the crime you wanted to commit is not so very unusual. There are hordes of people running around Pest who in one way or another have sold their wives and continue to enjoy general respect, especially if they’re in the money and God’s blessing goes with their businesses—but Zoltán will make quite sure that the weekly press, and other leaders of public opinion, will see it in a way that will mean you won’t be able to walk down the street. You’ll have to live abroad, which won’t worry you very much, except that your family will barely be able to support you, or in fact not at all, since Zoltán will certainly do his utmost to destroy your father’s business.”","“Then he’ll work on your reputation in Budapest,” continued Erzsi. “He’ll spread such rumours, you won’t be able to walk down the street again. My God, I’m not blind to the fact that the despicable bit you’d tried to pull is nothing new these days. There are lots of people running around Budapest who have, in one form or another, sold their wives and continue to enjoy all sorts of respectability, especially if they struck it rich and keep doing so with God’s blessing — but Zoltán will see to it that once the daily press and other gossip-mongers are done with you, you won’t be able to walk down the street again. You’ll have to stay abroad, something which shouldn’t be a problem for you, except that your family will find it difficult, if not impossible, to support you. Because Zoltán will do everything in his power to see to it that your father’s business goes bankrupt.”"
- Még most is ennyire bánt? - kérdezte csendesen Erzsi.,- Do you still hurt me so much? Erzsi asked quietly.,“Does it still hurt so much?” she asked softly.,“You’re still hurting this much?” she said gently.
"Tamás nemsokára magához tért, csak pár perce lehetett, hogy felakasztotta magát, nem történt semmi baja.","Tamás recovered soon, it must have been about a few minutes that he had hanged himself, nothing wrong.","“Tamás quickly regained consciousness.

"Egyszer csak elsápadt, felugrott, és sikítva hívott, hogy menjünk fel a padlásra, nézzük meg, mi van Tamással. Nem tudtam, miről van szó, de rémülete rám is átragadt. A padláson már meglehetősen sötét volt. Mondom, zegzugos, óriási, régi padlás volt, mindenfelé titokzatos deszkaajtók nyíltak, és a folyosón időnként ládák és deszkák álltak keresztbe, a fejemet is beütöttem alacsony gerendákba, és váratlan lépcsőkön kellett fel- és lerohanni. De Éva habozás nélkül szaladt a sötétben, mint aki tudja, hogy hol lehet Tamás. A folyosó legvégén egy alacsony és nagyon hosszú fülke volt, és a végén egy kis, kerek ablak világossága látszott. Éva megtorpant, és sikoltva kapaszkodott belém. Az én fogam is vacogott, de már akkor is olyan voltam, hogy éppen a legnagyobb félelem tesz váratlanul bátorrá. Bementem a sötét fülkébe, magam után vonva a belém kapaszkodó Évát.","Suddenly he turned pale, jumped up, and screamed and called to go up to the attic to see what happened to Tamás. I didn’t know what it was all about, but his horror stuck with me too. It was already quite dark in the attic. I mean, it was a zigzagging, huge, old attic, mysterious plank doors opened everywhere, and in the hallway at times chests and planks crossed, I also punched my head in low beams, and had to run up and down stairs. But Eve ran in the dark without hesitation, as if she knew where Thomas might be. There was a low and very long cabin at the very end of the corridor, and at the end there was the light of a small round window. Eva stopped and clung to me, screaming. My teeth chattered, too, but even then, it was the greatest fear that made me unexpectedly brave. I went into the dark cabin, pulling Eve clinging to me.","“Suddenly she turned pale, leapt to her feet, and screamed at me that we should go up to the attic to see what was wrong with Tamás. I had no idea what this was all about, but her fear ran through me. In the attic it was as black as could be. I tell you, it was a vast ancient place, full of nooks and crannies, with the doors of mysterious bureaux open everywhere, and trunks and desks blocking the main passage at intervals. I bumped my head on low-hanging beams. There were unexpected steps to go up and down. But Éva ran through the darkness without hesitation, as if she already knew where he might be. At the far end of the corridor there was a low and very long niche, and at the end of that the light of a small round window could be seen. Éva came to a sudden stop, and with a scream grabbed hold of me. My teeth were also chattering, but even at that age I was the sort of person who finds unexpected courage in moments of greatest fear. I went into the darkness of the niche, dragging Éva along, still clinging to me.","“All of a sudden she turned white, jumped up and screamed about going up to the attic. Something must’ve happened to Tamás. I didn’t know what she was talking about, but her terror was contagious. The attic was exceedingly dark. As I said, it was a huge old attic with nooks and corners, all kinds of secret passages, cedar chests and wood planks blocking the way. I banged my head on a low rafter as I tried hurdling a set of unexpected steps. But Éva rushed through the blackness without hesitation, as if she knew exactly where to find Tamás. Near the end of a dark passage was a low and narrow alcove dimly lit by a small round window. Éva froze and screamed as she clung to me. My teeth chattered, but even then something in me would find sudden courage in times of terror. With Éva still clinging to me, I stepped into the alcove’s half dark."
- Nem. Csak maga nekem rögtön oly rokonszenves volt.,- No. Only you were so sympathetic to me right away.,“No. Just that I instantly found you so attractive.”,“No. It’s just that I was attracted to you right away.”

"Mert Waldheim szobája, modora, egész ember-volta annyira a megrögzött és javíthatatlan egyetemi hallgató, a soha felnőni nem tudó stud. phil. benyomását tette rá, hogy nem tudott feleséget és gyermeket hozzáképzelni.","Because Waldheim's room, his manners, his whole manhood were so much that he was an obsessed and incorrigible university student, a stud who could never grow up. phil. he gave the impression that he could not imagine a wife and a child.","For Waldheim’s room, his manners, his whole being were so much that of the perpetual and incurable university student, with the stamp of the ‘I never want to grow up’ stud. phil. so clearly upon him, that Mihály simply couldn’t imagine him with a wife and child.","Waldheim’s room, manner, his entire being suggested the incurable, eternal graduate student, incapable of ever outgrowing the identity of a doctoral candidate in philology.

"Még egy kényes kérdést kell itt érintenem. Jól tudom, hogy te, illetve kedves édesapád, akinek a vállalatánál működsz, jómódú emberek vagytok, és feleséged nem fog semmiben sem hiányt szenvedni. Azért néha mégis aggódom, mert tudom, hogy Erzsi mennyire el van kényeztetve, és félek, hogy az ilyen elvont ember, mint te, nem számol kellőképpen Erzsi igényeivel. Te magad, tudom, kedvesen, bohémesen igénytelen természet vagy, mindig igen szolid életet éltél, más életnívón, mint amihez Erzsi hozzászokott. Mármost egyikteknek alkalmazkodni kell a másik életstandardjához. Ha Erzsi alkalmazkodik a tiédhez, ez előbb-utóbb meg fogja bosszulni magát, mert déclassée-nak fogja érezni magát abban a pillanatban, amint régi miliőjével érintkezésbe jön. Mit tudom én, Olaszországban találkozhattok egy barátnőjével, aki felhúzza az orrát, amikor meghallja, hogy egy nem egészen elsőrangú hotelben laktok. A másik lehetőség az, hogy te alkalmazkodsz az ő standardjához; ez meg előbb-utóbb anyagi következményekkel fog járni, mert - ne haragudj - én valószínűleg jobban ismerem vállalatotok teherbíró képességét, mint te, aki olyan elvont ember vagy, és amellett négyen vagytok testvérek, és kedves édesapád kissé konzervatív, meglehetősen szigorú felfogású úriember, inkább a tartalékolásnak, mint a jövedelem felélésének a híve... szóval, hogy rövid legyek, nem vagy abban a helyzetben, hogy Erzsi szokott életstandardját a te oldaladon fenntarthassa. Minthogy pedig nekem nagyon fekszik, hogy Erzsinek mindene meglegyen, nagyon kérlek, ne vedd rossz néven, ha kijelentem neked, hogy szükség esetén feltétlenül rendelkezésedre állok, ha parancsolod, hosszúlejáratú kölcsön formájában is. Bevallom őszintén, legszívesebben állandó havi összeget fizetnék, de tudom, hogy ez szemtelenség lenne. De ennyit mindenesetre tudomásodra kell hoznom: ha bármikor szükséged volna, csak fordulj hozzám.","I have to touch on another delicate issue here. I am well aware that you and your dear father, whose company you work for, are wealthy people and your wife will not be short of anything. Sometimes, though, I worry because I know how pampered Erzsi is, and I’m afraid that an abstract person like you won’t take enough account of Erzsi’s needs. You yourself, I know, are a kind, bohemianly unassuming nature, you have always lived a very solid life, at a different standard of living than Erzsi is used to. Now one of you has to adapt to the other’s standard of living. If Erzsi adapts to yours, it will sooner or later take revenge on her, because she will feel like a déclassée the moment she comes into contact with her old milieu. As far as I know, in Italy you may meet a girlfriend who pulls her nose up when she hears you are living in a not-so-prime hotel. The other option is for you to conform to his standard; this will have financial consequences sooner or later, because - don't be angry - I probably know your company's resilience better than you, who are such an abstract person and you are four siblings and your dear father is a somewhat conservative, rather strict gentleman, rather a proponent of saving as a means of earning an income ... so to be short, you're not in a position to maintain Erzsi's usual standard of living on your side. And since it is very difficult for me to have everything for Ersi, please do not take it in a bad name if I declare to you that I will definitely be at your disposal if necessary, also in the form of a long-term loan. I confess honestly, I would prefer to pay a fixed monthly amount, but I know that would be impudence. But that’s all I need to make you aware of anyway: if you ever need it, just contact me.","There is another delicate matter I have to touch upon. I realise that you (or rather your father whose firm you work for) are well off, and your wife will lack for nothing. But I do sometimes worry, because I know how pampered Erzsi has been, and I fear that someone as absent-minded as you might not take proper account of her needs. Your own nature is that of an amiable bohemian, undemanding, always bound up in your own solid existence, on a rather different level to what Erzsi is accustomed to. Now one of you is going to have to adapt to the other’s standard. If she adapts to yours, that will sooner or later create trouble, because she is going to feel herself déclassée the moment she comes into contact with the old set. For example, in Italy you might meet one of her girlfriends, who pulls a face when she hears you’re staying at a hotel that isn’t exactly top notch. The alternative is that you move up to Erzsi’s level, and this, sooner or later, will have material consequences because—if you will forgive me—I probably know the strength of the firm better than you do, you being such an abstracted sort of fellow—not to mention that you are four brothers, and your respected father a somewhat conservative, rather puritanical old gentleman who believes in saving rather than using his income … in a word, to be brief, you are hardly in a position to maintain Erzsi’s standard of living on your own account. And since it is a matter close to my heart that she should never want for anything, I beg you not to take it amiss when I tell you that should the need ever arise I am absolutely at your disposal, should you ever ask for help in the form of a long-term loan. Quite frankly, I would much prefer to pay you a regular monthly sum, but I know that would be an impertinence. But in any event this much I have to tell you: if ever you are in need, just turn to me.","I must broach another delicate matter. I well know that you, or rather your father, in whose company you work, is well off, and there should not be anything your wife will lack. Still, I cannot help but worry, because I know to what degree Erzsi is spoiled, and I fear that a withdrawn person such as yourself will not be able to attend to Erzsi’s needs properly. You are used to living a nice, unassuming, bohemian life, solid in its own way, but really quite different from the style Erzsi is accustomed to. Now, one of you will have to adjust to the other’s living standard. Should Erzsi adapt to yours, sooner or later she will regret it, because she will feel déclassé the moment she comes into contact with her old milieu. You never know. In Italy you may run into a friend of hers who will turn up her nose when she learns you are not staying at a first class hotel. The other possibility is that you adapt to her standard; sooner or later this will carry with it financial consequences, because — forgive me — I know your father’s company better than you, who is so distant from everything, and, besides, you have two brothers and a sister, and your dear father is a bit conservative, a gentleman of fairly orthodox ideas, inclined more toward saving than consuming revenue… in brief, you are not in a position to maintain the style of living to which Erzsi is accustomed. Since it is in my interest that Erzsi have everything, I ask of you not to take it the wrong way if I tell you that if the need arises, I am unconditionally at your service, if you think it necessary… even in the form of a long term loan. To be perfectly frank, I would much rather give you a monthly sum, but I know how insulting that would be. In any case, I want you to know that you can turn to me anytime you need to."
"Már rég a Gianicolón lakott, egy nagyon ócska kis szobában, amelyet Waldheim fedezett fel, egy nagyon ócska öregasszonynál, aki többnyire ebédet is főzött neki, pasta asciuttát, és Mihály hozott magával egy kis sajtot, néha egy narancsot is. A szoba minden ócskasága dacára sokkal szobább volt, mint egy hotelszoba, a benne levő bútorok régi, igazi bútordarabok voltak, nagyok és arányaikban nemesek, nem olyan ál-bútorok, mint amik szállodákban szoktak állni. Mihály szerette volna szobáját, ha a tisztálkodási és egészségügyi mellékkörülmények nem töltötték volna el újra és újra a lecsúszottság gyötrő érzésével. Panaszkodott is Waldheimnek, de az kinevette, és görögországi és albániai tapasztalatairól tartott hosszú és nem egészen étvágykeltő előadásokat.","He had long lived in the Gianicolo, in a very old little room that Waldheim had discovered, with a very old old woman who had mostly cooked lunch for him, pasta ascites, and Michael had brought some cheese, sometimes an orange. Despite all the clumsiness of the room, it was much more roomy than a hotel room, the furniture in it was old, real pieces of furniture, large and noble in proportions, not as pseudo-furniture as they used to be in hotels. Michael would have liked his room if the ancillary conditions of bathing and health had not filled him again and again with the excruciating feeling of slipping. He also complained to Waldheim, but he laughed and gave long and not quite appetizing lectures about his experiences in Greece and Albania.","For some time now he had been living on the Gianicolo Hill, in a shabby little room Waldheim had discovered, where a scruffy crone cooked most of his meals, simple pasta asciutta, which Mihály supplemented with a bit of cheese and sometimes an orange. Despite its creaking antiquity it was much more the real thing than any hotel room. The furniture was ancient—real furniture, large and nobly proportioned, not the pseudo-furniture one finds in large hotels. Mihály would have been very fond of his room had its state of cleanliness and hygiene not constantly provoked the painful sense of having come down in the world. He even complained to Waldheim, who simply laughed and delivered lengthy and not very appetising lectures on his experiences in Greece and Albania.","He’d been living for a while in the Gianicolo in a shabby little room Waldheim had obtained from a shabby old woman who’d cook him dinner, pasta asciutta mostly, and Mihály would sometimes bring home a little cheese, a few oranges. In spite of its shabbiness, the room was a great deal homier than a hotel room. Its furnishings were ancient but also authentic, oversized but also grand, not the sham furniture usually found in hotel rooms. Mihály could’ve loved this room were it not for the grimy, unsanitary conditions which kept gnawing at his sense of well-being. He’d complained to Waldheim, who only laughed in his face, delivering mini-lectures about his Greek and Albanian experiences that were not altogether appetizing."

"Eltűnt egy sötét kapualjban. Mihály tűnődve, de jókedvűen sétált fel és alá. Egy idő múlva furcsa, humoros köhögést hallott; felnézett, Waldheim kidugta fényes, kerek fejét egy ablakon.","He disappeared into a dark doorway. Michael walked up and down wonderingly but cheerfully. After a while he heard a strange, humorous cough; looking up, Waldheim poked his shiny round head out a window.","He disappeared through a dark doorway. Mihály walked up and down, thoughtfully but in good spirits. After a while he heard an odd, amused coughing. He looked up. Waldheim had thrust his bright round head out of a window.","He disappeared into a dark doorway. An amused Mihály took a cheerful walk up and down the street.

"- Tudtam, hogy nagyon beteg - mondta Mihály. - Próbáltam is rábeszélni, hogy gyógyíttassa magát. Gondolod, hogy talán jobban kellett volna rábeszélnem? Talán ott kellett volna maradnom Gubbióban, és el nem mennem addig, amíg valami nem történik gyógyulása érdekében?","""I knew he was very ill,"" Michael said. ""I tried to persuade him to heal himself."" Do you think I should have persuaded you better? Maybe I should have stayed there in Gubbio and not left until something happened to heal?","“I knew he was very ill,” said Mihály. “I tried to persuade him to get himself seen to. Do you think I should perhaps have tried a bit harder? Perhaps I should have stayed in Gubbio and not left until something was done about getting him well?”","“I knew he was very sick,” Mihály said. “I tried to persuade him to get treatment. You think maybe I wasn’t forceful enough with him? Maybe I should’ve stayed in Gubbio and not have left until something was done to get him back on his feet.”"
"Mihály még mindig nem tudta elszánni magát, hogy hozzálépjen. Úgy érezte, hogy Ervin, aki oly szent ember lett, bizonyára szégyelli világias ifjúságát, és nemes undorral gondol vissza rá, mint Szent Ágoston. Bizonyára mindent átértékelt, és Mihályt talán ki is dobta magából, nem is akar emlékezni rá. Talán jobb volna, ha most elutaznék és beérné avval a csodával, hogy látta Ervint.","Michael was still unable to resolve himself. He felt that Ervin, who had become such a holy man, must be ashamed of his worldly youth and think back to him with noble disgust like St. Augustine. He must have reevaluated everything, and maybe he threw Mihály out of himself, he doesn't even want to remember it. Maybe it would be better if I traveled now and caught up with the miracle of seeing Ervin.","Mihály still could not make up his mind whether to approach him. He felt that Ervin, now that he had become such a holy person, would surely be ashamed of his worldly youth, and, like St Augustine, would look back upon it with lofty disdain. Surely he would see it all quite differently, and had doubtless dismissed him, not wanting even to think about him. Perhaps it would be better to leave straightaway, and be content with the miracle of simply having seen him.","Mihály couldn’t bring himself to walk up to him. He felt that Ervin, who’d become a saintly man, would perhaps be mortified by memories of his worldly youth and look back at them with self-righteous aversion as had Saint Augustine. Perhaps he’d taken an inventory of his life and purged Mihály from his consciousness, never wanting to be reminded of him again. Perhaps it would be better if he left now, content with the miracle that he’d seen Ervin in the flesh."

"Csak akkor rezzent fel, amikor megjelent a fiatal anya, karján a bambinóval. Mihály megijedt az anya sovány és beteg csúnyaságától és a bambinó citromszerű jellegétől. A gyermekeket sosem szerette, sem újszülött, sem későbbi állapotukban, idegenkedett és félt tőlük; és az anyákkal szemben is mindig kényelmetlen érzése volt. De ez az anya és ez az újszülött egész különösen iszonyatos volt - a csúf anya gyengédségében és a csúf csecsemő esendőségében valami sátáni Madonna-paródiát érzett, az európai ember legnagyobb szimbólumának valami kaján megcsúfolását. Olyan „késői” dolog volt ez... mintha az utolsó anya megszülte volna az utolsó gyermeket, és ezek itt körül nem is tudják, hogy ők az utolsó emberek, a történelem salakos üledéke, a haldokló Idő-isten utolsó és öngúnnyal teljes gesztusa.","It only vibrated when the young mother appeared, with the bambino in her arms. Michael was frightened by the mother's skinny and sick ugliness and the lemon-like nature of the bambino. He never loved children, neither in their newborns nor in their later condition, he was averse and afraid of them; and she had always felt uncomfortable with her mothers as well. But this mother and this newborn were all particularly horrible — in the tenderness of the ugly mother and in the tenderness of the ugly baby she felt something of a satanic parody of the Madonna, a mischievous mockery of the greatest symbol of European man. It was such a “late” thing ... as if the last mother had given birth to the last child, and they don’t even know around here that they are the last people, the slag sediment of history, the last and selfish gesture of the dying Time God.","Only when the young mother appeared with the bambino in her arms did he feel the full horror. The skinny, sickly ugliness of the mother and the yellowness of the baby terrified him. He had never liked children, whether new-born or in their later stages. He detested and feared them, and had always felt uncomfortable with their mothers. But this mother and this new-born babe were loathsome in a quite special way. In the ugly mother’s tenderness and the ugly babe’s defencelessness he sensed some kind of satanic parody of the Madonna, some malicious uglification of European man’s greatest symbol. It was such an apocalyptic kind of thing … as if the last mother had given birth to the last child, and none of those present had any idea that they were the last people alive, the excremental deposit of history, the dying Time-god’s final and absolute gesture of self-mockery.","The only time he stirred was when the young mother appeared with the bambino on her arm. The sickly, emaciated mother and the bambino’s jaundiced complexion frightened him. He never liked children. Infants and toddlers only heightened his apprehension, and he always felt estranged from them. And mothers always made him uncomfortable. But this mother and her infant were especially repulsive. The ugly, rattle-boned mother and this frail and ugly child suggested a satanic parody of the Madonna and Child, European man’s most cherished icon. The scene struck an ‘apocalyptic’ note, as if the last mother on earth had given birth to the last child, and the people surrounding them had no idea that they were the last people, history’s final dregs, the last, self-effacing gesture of time’s dying God."
"- Jó - mondta Mihály -, de beszélj, kérlek, tovább, nem is hiszed, mennyire érdekel. Hogyan szűnt meg az emberiség vágyódni a halott-szigetek után, vagy talán még most is vágyódik? Szóval mi a történet vége?","""Good,"" Michael said, ""but talk, please, keep thinking you don't care."" How has humanity ceased to long for the dead islands, or perhaps still longs? So what's the end of the story?","“Fine,” said Mihály. “But say a bit more, if you would. You’ve no idea how much this interests me. Why did it come to an end, this human yearning for the islands of the dead? Or perhaps the feeling is still with us? In a word, where does the story end?”","“All right,” said Mihály, “but carry on. You’ve no idea how interesting this is to me. Now, why did mankind stop longing for the isles of the dead, or are we still longing? In other words, how does the story end?”"
"De tulajdonképpen egészen más bosszantotta. Természetesen az bosszantotta, hogy Szepetneki Jánosnak annyira nem tetszett. Nem mintha a legkisebb mértékben is fontos volna, hogy mit gondol róla egy ilyen... egy ilyen kétes egzisztencia. De mégis, nincsen végzetesebb dolog a világon egy nő számára, mint a férj barátainak a véleménye. A férfiak hihetetlenül befolyásolhatók, ha nőkről van szó. Igaz, hogy ez a Szepetneki Mihálynak nem barátja. Vagyis hogy nem barátja a szónak konvencionális értelmében, de úgy látszik, mégis valami nagyon erős kapcsolat van közöttük. És különben is, a legocsmányabb férfi is befolyásolni tudja a másik férfit ilyen dolgokban.","But he was actually quite annoyed. Of course, it annoyed that János Szepetneki didn't like him so much. It's not as if what's so important about such ... such a dubious existence that matters. But still, there is nothing more fatal in the world for a woman than the opinion of her husband’s friends. Men are incredibly influential when it comes to women. It is true that this is not a friend of Mihály Szepetneki. That is, he is not a friend in the conventional sense of the word, but there still seems to be some very strong connection between them. And anyway, even the ugliest man can influence the other man in things like that.","But in truth something quite different bothered her. Naturally she was upset that she had made so little impression on János Szepetneki. Not that it would have had the slightest significance what such a … such a dubious creature might think about her. All the same there is nothing more critical, from a woman’s point of view, than the opinion held of her by her husband’s friends. In the matter of women men are influenced with incredible ease. True, this Szepetneki was not Mihály’s friend. That is to say, not his friend in the conventional sense of the word. But there was apparently a powerful bond between them. And of course the most foul-minded of men can be especially influential in these matters.","Actually she was a little galled. Galled that János Szepetneki had found her unattractive. Not that it really mattered what that… that sleaze, that lowlife thought of her. But still, nothing could be more calamitous for a woman than the negative opinion of her husband’s friends. When it came to the subject of women, men could be absurdly gullible. True, Szepetneki was no friend of Mihály, at least not in the conventional sense. Still, the ardent connection between them was hard to overlook. Strange how a vile creature like this could hold sway over a man in these things. Damn it all anyhow!"
"Félálomban úgy hallotta, mintha a szomszéd szobában beszélnének. Valami nyers férfihang dörmögését hallotta, időnként egy másik férfi gyors beszédét és közben a lány sztakkató suttogását. Kétségkívül most azon tárgyalnak, hogy megöljék-e. A lány talán védi, talán ellenkezőleg. Most, most fel kellene ébrednie. Ó, hányszor álmodta ezt, hogy közeledik valami szörnyű veszedelem, és ő nem tud felébredni, akárhogy is erőlködik, és íme, most álma valóra vált.

Oh, how many times have you dreamed this that some terrible peril is approaching, and he cannot wake up, no matter how hard he is, and behold, now his dream has come true. Then he dreamed something flashed in front of his eyes and woke up growling.","In this half-dream he seemed to hear them talking in the next room. There was a man’s voice that seemed to growl roughly, the rapid speech of another man from time to time, and the constant staccato whispering of the girl. Without doubt they were now discussing whether to kill him. The girl was perhaps protecting him, perhaps the opposite. Now, now, he really ought to wake. How often had he had this dream, that some terrible danger was approaching and he couldn’t wake however hard he tried: and now it was coming true. Then he dreamed that something was flashing before his eyes, and, with a rattle in his throat, he awoke.","In this half slumber, he thought he heard voices in the next room. A man’s grumbling voice, then another man’s rant mixed with Vannina’s staccato whispering. Without question, they were talking about killing him. Perhaps the girl was taking his side, perhaps she was their ring leader. He ought to get up now. But he was paralyzed. How many times had he felt this way before, that something horrible was happening to him, and he was unable to get up, no matter how hard he struggled? The paralysis was back, and then something flashed before his eyes and startled him awake to a terrifying death-rattle in his throat."

"Most Mihály rémült meg. Vacogó és kamaszos rémület fogta el, az apától, az apai jóindulat elvesztésétől való ősi félelem. Letette az aranciátás poharat, és fejét kezébe hajtotta.

He suddenly regressed to a boy’s teeth-chattering fear of the father, the primal fear of losing the father’s good graces. He set down his glass of aranciata and buried his head in his hands. Erzsi may have at least understood his motives, but his father would be another story. In his father’s eyes, he’d lose whatever respect he had, once and for all."
"- Érdekes - mondta kedvetlenül. - Te valamit biztosan elhallgatsz. Nem baj. Nem tartom kötelességednek, hogy mindent elmondj. Én sem érzek semmi lelkiismeret-furdalást, hogy nem beszéltem neked a kamaszéveimről. Nem is tartom fontosnak. De mondd... te abba a lányba szerelmes voltál. Ez csak kifejezés dolga. Minálunk ezt úgy hívják, hogy szerelem.","""Interesting,"" he said reluctantly. - You must be silent about something. No problem. I do not consider it your duty to tell you everything. Nor do I feel any remorse for not telling you about my adolescence. I don't even think it's important. But tell me ... you were in love with that girl. It's just a matter of expression. For us, this is called love.","“Very interesting,” she said, somewhat crestfallen. “You’re certainly holding something back. Never mind. I don’t consider it necessary that you should tell me everything. I don’t feel any pangs of conscience about the fact that I’ve not told you about my adolescence. I don’t think it very important. But tell me—you were in love with this girl. It’s just a matter of words. Where I come from it was what you would call love.”","“How interesting,” she said dourly. “It’s obvious you’re hiding something. Not that it matters. You’re not obliged to tell me everything. And I don’t feel guilty not telling you about my adolescent years. I don’t even consider them important. But you, you were in love with that girl. A matter of semantics only. From where I come from we call it love.”"
"Nemsokára egy középkorú, vidékiesen öltözött francia jött eléjük, alaposan megszemlélte őket, mialatt János neki is előadta az esetet. Arca lassanként felderült, és nagyon barátságos lett.","Soon a middle-aged Frenchman dressed in the countryside came before them, watching them intently as John presented the case to him. His face slowly brightened and he became very friendly.","Soon a middle-aged Frenchman in country attire stood before them. He looked them up and down while János repeated his account of what had happened.

- Akkor bizonyára továbbutazik Anconáig. Nem jól teszi. Szálljon ki Perugiában; nagyon régi város.,"""Then he must travel on to Ancona."" It doesn't do well. Get off in Perugia; very old town.",“Then you must be going on to Ancona. That’s not a good idea. Stop off at Perugia. It is a very old city.”,“Then you are going all the way to Ancona. You are making a mistake. You should get off in Perugia. A very old city.”
"János leplezetlen ellenszenvvel nézte végig Erzsit, meghajolt, kezet fogott, és attól kezdve nem vette tudomásul az asszony jelenlétét. Egyáltalában nem szólt semmit, csak limonádét rendelt.","John looked at Ersi with undisguised dislike, bowed, shook hands, and from then on did not acknowledge the woman's presence. He said nothing at all, just ordered lemonade.","János looked Erzsi up and down with undisguised hostility, bowed, shook her hand, and thereafter totally ignored her presence. Indeed, he said nothing at all, except to order lemonade.","János looked Erzsi over with undisguised repugnance, bowed, shook her hand, and from that point on ignored her. Other than to order lemonade, he said nothing."
"- Látja, most eszembe jut - mondta Mihály -, hogy a londoni novemberben egyszer én is megéltem valamit, ami a magához hasonló emberekben bizonyára megerősítette volna azt a hitet, hogy a halottak vannak valamiképp. Engem csak abban erősít meg, hogy valami baj van az idegrendszeremben. Hallgasson ide. Egy délelőtt bent dolgoztam a gyárban (mondom, november volt), mikor telefonhoz hívtak. Egy ismeretlen női hang arra kért, hogy délután okvetlenül, rendkívül fontos ügyben jöjjek el ide és ide - megmondott egy ismeretlen címet és nevet. Tiltakoztam, hogy bizonyára tévedés lesz a dologban. „De nem”, mondta a női hang, „egy magyar gentlemant keresek, aki a Buthroyd-gyárban dolgozik, mint volontaire - van ott több is olyan?” Nincs, mondtam, és a nevem is stimmel. De mondja meg, hogy miről van szó. Nem mondhatja meg... Sokáig beszéltünk, végül mégis megígértem, hogy elmegyek.","""You see, it reminds me now,"" said Michael, ""that once in November in London, I experienced something that would have confirmed the belief that the dead were somehow in people like you."" It only confirms me that there is something wrong with my nervous system. Listen here. I was working inside the factory one morning (I say, it was November) when I was called on the phone. An unknown female voice asked me to come here and here on an extremely important matter in the afternoon, ”she said with an unknown address and name. I protested that there would surely be a mistake in this. ""But no,"" said the female voice, ""I'm looking for a Hungarian gentleman who works at the Buthroyd factory as a volontaire - is there more like that?"" No, I said, and my name is right. But tell me what it's about. You can't tell ... We talked for a long time, but in the end I promised to leave.","“You see,” Mihály continued, “now it comes back to me: in London one November I also experienced something which, with people like yourself, would no doubt have strengthened their belief that the dead somehow survive. In me it only strengthens the conviction that there is something wrong with my nervous system. Listen to this. One morning I was working down in the factory (as I said, this was in November) when I was called to the telephone. An unknown woman asked me to go without fail that afternoon, on important business, to such and such a place, and gave me an unfamiliar name and address. I protested that there must be some error. ‘ Oh no,’ said this unknown female voice, ‘I’m trying to contact a Hungarian gentleman who works in the Boothroyd factory as a volunteer. Is there another one of that description?’ ‘No-one,’ I replied, ‘and you have my name correctly. But tell me, what is it about?’ She couldn’t say. We talked about it for some time and eventually I agreed to go.","“Come to think of it,” Mihály said, “I had this experience one November in London which — for people like you — would surely confirm the belief that the dead do exist in one form or another. All it did for me was to confirm there was something very wrong with my nervous system. You may find it amusing. One morning I was working in the factory as an international business intern — as I said, it was in November — when I was called to the telephone. An unfamiliar female voice urged me to meet her that afternoon about a pressing matter at such and such a place. She gave me an unknown name and address. I protested. Surely, there was some mistake. ‘ But no,’ said the voice, ‘I’m looking for a Hungarian gentleman working at the Buthroyd factory as a volontaire. Are there others matching that description?’ I told her no, and that the name was also correct. I insisted she tell me what it was about. She couldn’t. We bantered back and forth for some time before I agreed to go."

"Szóval egy délután beállítottam Ulpiusékhoz, és hívtam Tamást, jöjjön sétálni, szép, tavaszias délután volt. Kijutottunk Óbudára, és beültünk egy üres kiskocsmába, egy Szent Flórián-szobor alá. Sokat ittam, és közben keseregtem apám miatt, kilátásaim miatt, az ifjúság egész rettenetes szomorúsága miatt.","So one afternoon I set up for the Ulpians and called Tamás, come for a walk, it was a nice spring afternoon. We got out to Óbuda and sat in an empty small pub under a statue of St. Florian. I drank a lot and meanwhile grieved for my father, for my prospects, for all the terrible sadness of the youth.","“But to be brief. One afternoon I called at the Ulpius house and invited Tamás to come for a walk. It was a fine afternoon in spring.

I had a lot to drink, and moaned about my father, my prospects, the whole horrible misery of youth.","“So — getting back to the suicide. One afternoon I went to Tamás’s so we could take a walk on what started out as a bright spring afternoon. We got as far as Óbuda when we stopped in an empty little pub by Saint Florian’s statue. I drank way too much and whined about my father, my future, about the whole ghastly business of being young."
"Mihály fizetett, és tántorogva ment ki a kávéházból. A jelek nem csaltak, ezért kellett Rómába jönnie, mert Éva itt van. Most már azt is tudta, hogy nosztalgiájának ez volt a kikötője: Éva, Éva...","Michael paid and staggered out of the coffee shop. The signs were not deceived, so he had to come to Rome because Eve is here. Now he knew that this was the harbor of his nostalgia: Eve, Eve ...","He paid for his drinks and staggered out of the café.

"A kis auberge, ahová vacsorázni mentek, abba a típusba tartozott, amely ófranciának van stilizálva, kockás függönyökkel és kockás abrosszal, kevés asztal, drága és nagyon jó koszt. Erzsi, mikor Zoltánnal járt Párizsban, gyakran evett ilyen és jobb helyeken, de most, takarékosságának mélységeiből felbukkanva, meghatódott, amint az étterem meghitt, gazdag-emberi atmoszférája megcsapta. De meghatottsága csak egy pillanatig tartott, mert már elébük sietett a nagyobb szenzáció, Szepetneki János. Nagyon udvariasan és jó dzsentri modorban csókolt kezet Erzsinek, akit nem ismert meg, Sárinak bókot mondott barátnőinek tehetséges megválogatásáért, és azután odavezette a hölgyeket az asztalhoz, ahol barátja már várta őket.","The little auberge they went to for dinner belonged to the type stylized for the French, with checkered curtains and checkered tablecloths, few tables, expensive and very good dirt. Erzsi, when she visited Zoltán in Paris, often ate in such and better places, but now, emerging from the depths of her frugality, she was touched as the restaurant's intimate, rich-human atmosphere struck her. But his touch lasted only for a moment, because the bigger sensation was already in front of them, János Szepetneki. He kissed Erzsi, whom he did not know, very politely and in a good gentry manner, praised Sari for her talented selection of girlfriends, and then led the ladies to the table where her boyfriend was already waiting for them.","The little auberge where they went to dine was of the type classified as Old French: check curtains and table-cloths, very few tables, excellent and hugely expensive food. During her earlier visit with Zoltán, Erzsi had often eaten in such places, or better. Now, coming to it from the depths of her penny-pinching, she was strongly affected as she caught the first whiff of the familiar atmosphere of wealth. But this emotion lasted only a moment before the arrival of the greater sensation, János Szepetneki. Not recognising Erzsi, he kissed her hand with elaborate courtesy and formality, complimented Sári on her excellent choice of friends, and led the ladies to the table where his friend was waiting for them.","The little auberge where they went to have supper belonged to the old French style, checkered drapery and checkered tablecloth, few tables, expensive but very good food. When Erzsi had been in Paris with Zoltán, they’d often dine in such places or better. But now, as she resurfaced from her miserly abyss, her senses were all the more awakened by the little tavern’s cosy, sumptuous ambience. But her elation was short-lived. They were quickly met by a greater sensation, János Szepetneki. Without a hint of recognition he acted every bit the gentleman and kissed Erzsi’s hand gallantly and with exaggerated finesse, complimented Sári on her splendid taste in friends, and escorted the ladies to the table where his friend already waited."

"Mihály megdöbbenve nézett rá. Eszébe jutott a lány jóstehetsége. Úgy érezte, hogy a lány átlát rajta, és tudja, miről van szó. Hirtelen elszégyellte magát, mint egy tettenért iskolásfiú. Most nem látott semmi magasztosat abban, hogy meg akar halni. Deferált a nagyobb úr, a hétköznap előtt, mint mindig. A papot csakugyan nem szabad megvárakoztatni... Pénzt tett a tárcájába, vette a kalapját, és elindultak.","Michael looked at him in shock. He remembered her talent. She felt the girl see through it and know what it was all about. He was suddenly ashamed of himself as a schoolboy for an act. Now he saw nothing sublime in wanting to die. The bigger gentleman was deferred before the weekday, as always. The priest really shouldn't wait ... He put money in his wallet, took his hat, and they left.","Mihály looked at her in amazement. He remembered her gift of prophecy. He had the distinct feeling that the girl could see into him and had understood the situation. He suddenly felt ashamed, like a schoolboy caught red-handed. Now he saw nothing sublime in his wish to die. The elevated gave way to the mundane, as always happened. One really couldn’t keep the priest waiting … He put some money in his wallet, took his hat, and they set off.","Mihály looked at her with a start. He’d almost forgotten Vannina was psychic. She’d seen right through him and knew what was going on. He was a schoolboy caught in the act, and there was nothing grandiose anymore about wanting to die. Once again he had to bow before the everyday things of this world. The priest must not be kept waiting. He put money in his wallet, took his hat, and they started off."
"- Futok. Különben nem tudnék elaludni. Lemegyek a Tevere partjára, és ott futok fel és alá. A rendőrök már ismernek, és nem szólnak rám. Éppúgy, mint otthon. Na gyere.

"Felüzent Erzsiért, aki nemsokára le is jött, és mosoly nélkül üdvözölte Mihályt. Mihály első benyomása az volt, hogy nem sok jót várhat ettől a találkozástól. Erzsi magasra húzta szemöldökét, mint mikor bosszankodott, és le sem engedte. Szép volt, magas, és minden ízében elegáns, de egy lángpallosú angyal... Hallgatva mentek egymás mellett, miután szűkszavúan elvégezték az utazásra és egymás egészségére vonatkozó kérdezősködést.","He whispered for Erzsi, who soon came down and greeted Mihály without a smile. Michael's first impression was that he couldn't expect much good from this encounter. Erzsi raised an eyebrow as if annoyed and didn't let go. She was beautiful, tall, and elegant in every taste, but a flamethrower angel ... They walked side by side after they narrowly conducted a survey about travel and each other's health.","Word was sent up to her, and she soon came down to greet Mihály unsmilingly. His first impression was that he could expect little good from this meeting. Her brows were knitted into the frown she wore when she was angry, and she did not relax it. She was beautiful, tall, in every matter of taste elegant, but an angel with a flaming sword … After a few terse inquiries about the journey and one another’s health, they walked together in silence.","The reception desk rang Erzsi’s room, and she soon came down and greeted Mihály without a smile. Mihály’s initial impression was anything but encouraging. Erzsi’s eyebrows were at their critical high, a sign she was truly aggravated. And for the time being they stayed that way. Still, she looked beautiful. Tall. An angel, elegance radiating from every particle and limb, brandishing a flaming sword. For a while they walked side by side without saying anything, and once they spoke, they limited themselves to curt little questions about the trip and each other’s health."

"Így elképzelheted, hogy nem voltam egészséges, sem testileg, sem lelkileg. Vérszegény voltam, és rettenetes depressziók gyötörtek. Tizenhat éves koromban, egy tüdőgyulladás után, hallucinációim kezdtek lenni. Mikor olvastam, sokszor úgy éreztem, hogy valaki áll a hátam mögött, és benéz a könyvbe, amit olvasok. Hátra kellett fordulnom, hogy meggyőződjem róla, hogy nincs ott senki. Vagy éjszaka rettenetes rémülettel arra ébredtem, hogy valaki áll az ágyam mellett, és néz engem. Persze nem volt ott senki. És állandóan szégyelltem magam. Családomban helyzetem lassanként tarthatatlanná vált állandó szégyenkezésem miatt. Ebéd közben egyre elvörösödtem, és egy időben már a legkisebb ok is elég volt, hogy úgy érezzem, hogy rögtön sírva fakadok. Ilyenkor kiszaladtam a szobából. Tudod, hogy szüleim mennyire rendes emberek; képzelheted, mennyire meg voltak döbbenve, és fel voltak háborodva, és hogy bátyáim és Edit mennyit gúnyolódtak. Végre odáig ment a dolog, hogy kénytelen voltam azt hazudni, hogy fél háromkor külön francia órám van az iskolában, és így magamban ebédelhettem, korábban, mint a többiek.","So you can imagine that I wasn’t healthy, either physically or mentally. I was anemic and tormented by terrible depressions. When I was sixteen, after a pneumonia, I started having hallucinations. When I read it, I often felt like someone was standing behind me and looking into the book I was reading. I had to turn around to make sure no one was there. Or at night, with awful horror, I woke up to someone standing by my bed watching me. Of course, no one was there. And I was constantly ashamed of myself. My situation in my family has slowly become untenable due to my constant shame. I turned red and red during lunch, and at the same time the slightest reason was enough to make me feel like I was about to cry. That's when I ran out of the room. You know how ordinary people my parents are; you can imagine how shocked and outraged they were and how much they mocked my brothers and Edit. The thing finally went so far that I was forced to lie that I had a separate French class at school at half past three and so I could have lunch on my own, earlier than the others.","“So you can imagine I was pretty sick in mind and body. I was anaemic, and subject to fits of terrible depression. When I was sixteen, after a bout of pneumonia, I began to have hallucinations.

Or in the night I would wake with the terrifying sensation that someone was standing beside my bed staring down at me. Of course there was no-one there. And I was permanently ashamed of myself. In time my position in the family became unbearable because of this constant sense of shame. During meals I kept blushing, and at one stage the least thing was enough to make me want to burst into tears. On these occasions I would run out of the room. You know how correct my parents are. You can imagine how disappointed and shocked they were, and how much my brothers and Edit teased me. It got to the point where I was forced to pretend I had a French lesson at school at two-thirty, and so was able to eat on my own, before the others did.","“As you can imagine, I was not healthy. Not in mind, not in body. I was anaemic. Plagued by terrible depression. When I was sixteen, after a bout with pneumonia, I began to hallucinate.

Or I would awaken to the eerie sensation that someone was standing next to my bed, watching me. Of course there was no one there. I always felt ashamed of myself. It gradually made anything that had to do with family unbearable, my face would redden at dinner, and at one point, the smallest trifle triggered a crying jag that sent me running from the room. You know how proper my parents are. You can imagine their shock and dismay, and how my brothers and Edit teased me. Things got so bad I started lying to them. Telling them I had a special French class at half past two. This way I could eat alone, earlier than the others."

"Eleinte külön szobája volt, aztán összeköltöztek, mert úgy olcsóbb. Együtt vacsoráztak, fent a szobájukban, a hoteles tilalma ellenére, magukkal hozott holmit. Kiderült, hogy Sári a vacsorakészítésben is éppoly ügyes, mint minden másban. Ebédelnie egyedül kellett, mert Sári bent evett a városban, szendvicset és kávét, állva, azután rögtön visszament irodájába. Erzsi eleinte kipróbált különféle jobb vendéglőket, de azután rájött, hogy a jobb vendéglők kiuzsorázzák az idegeneket, és inkább kis cręmerieket kezdett látogatni, ahol „ugyanazt meg lehet kapni, de sokkal olcsóbban”. Eleinte mindig ivott feketekávét ebéd után, mert imádta a jó párizsi feketét, de azután belátta, hogy az sem feltétlen életszükséglet, és lemondott róla, csak hetenként egyszer, minden hétfőn, elment a Nagy Boulevard-on levő Maison de Caféba, és ott megivott egy csészét a híres feketéből.","At first he had a separate room, then they moved in because it was cheaper. They had dinner together, upstairs in their room, despite the hotel’s ban, they brought something with them. It turned out that Sári was just as good at making dinner as anyone else. He had to have lunch alone because Sari ate inside the city, sandwiches and coffee, standing, and then immediately went back to his office. At first, Erzsi tried various better restaurants, but then she realized that better restaurants were crowding out strangers, and she started visiting smaller Cręmerians, where “you can get the same, but much cheaper”. At first he always drank black coffee after lunch because he loved good Parisian black, but then he realized it wasn’t an absolute necessity for life either, and he gave it up only once a week, every Monday, went to the Maison de Café on Grand Boulevard and had a drink there. cup of the famous black.","Initially she had her own room, then they moved in together because it was cheaper. In defiance of hotel regulations they took things up to their room and made supper together. It became apparent that Sári was as skilled at preparing dinners as she was at everything else. They had to lunch separately because Sári ate in town, coffee and sandwiches, taken standing up before hurrying straight back to the office. Erzsi at first tried various of the better restaurants, but became aware that these places mercilessly overcharged foreigners, so she took instead to visiting little crémeries, where “you can buy the identical thing, but so much cheaper.” Likewise, at first she would always drink black coffee after lunch because she adored the fine Parisian café noir, but then she came to realise that it was not absolutely essential for survival and gave it up, except that once a week, every Monday, she went to the Maison de Café on the Grand Boulevard to regale herself with a cup of the famous beverage.","At first she had her own room, then they moved in together to economize. Despite the hotel’s rules, they smuggled up groceries and made supper in their room. It turned out Sári was just as apt at cooking supper as she was at everything else. Erzsi ate lunch alone, because Sári liked to eat in the city centre, a croissant sandwich and coffee which she gulped down standing up, before she dashed back to the office. In the beginning Erzsi tried the better restaurants, but she soon found out these were pricey tourist traps, and frequented little crêmeries, where she could get the same meals much cheaper. After lunch, she’d made a habit of having the Parisian black coffee she absolutely adored, before she realized it was not a life-necessity and gave it up, but not entirely.

Egyik zsebében sem volt.","If they're planning something ... What a crazy thing to bring money with you! Where did you put your money? But since he’s dressed, he has to be in his wallet. He touched his wallet. He was out of place. He had no pockets.","If these people were planning something … What madness it was to have brought money with him! And where had he put his money? But of course, he had lain down fully dressed. It must be in his wallet. He groped for the wallet. It was not in its place. It was not in any of his pockets.",These people had a plan. And he’d been stupid enough to bring money with him! Where did he put his money? He was lying with his clothes on… it should be in his wallet. He felt for his wallet. It wasn’t there.

"Erzsi már eddig is nyugtalanul feszengett a helyén, mert emberismerete segítségével Szepetneki János arcáról és kezéről már rég leolvasta, hogy olyan ember, aki időnként el szokott lopni egy aranyórát, és idegesen magához szorította retiküljét, amelyben a passzuszok és utazócsekkek voltak. Nagyon meglepte, és rosszulesett neki, hogy az egyébként oly tapintatos Mihály szóvá tette ezt az óraügyet, de ezt a csendet, ami most beállt, nem lehetett elviselni, ezt a csendet, amikor az egyik ember azt mondja a másiknak, hogy ellopta az aranyóráját, azután hallgatnak. Felkelt, és azt mondta:","Erzsi was already anxiously tense in his place, because with the help of his human knowledge he had long read from the face and hand of János Szepetneki that he was a man who used to steal a gold watch from time to time and nervously clutched his purse containing passes and travelers' checks. He was very surprised and upset that Michael, who was otherwise so tactful, made this watch a matter of words, but this silence that had now set in could not be tolerated, this silence when one man tells the other that he had stolen his gold watch, then they listen. He got up and said,","Erzsi during all this had been fidgeting restlessly in her chair. From experience she had been aware for some time, looking at János’s face and hands, that he was just the sort of person to steal a gold watch every now and then. She nervously drew her reticule towards her. In it were the passports and traveller’s cheques. She was astonished, and dismayed, that the otherwise so diplomatic Mihály should have brought up this watch business, but what was really unendurable was the silence in which they sat, the silence when one man tells another that he stole his gold watch and then neither says a word. She stood up and announced:","Erzsi squirmed in her seat. She knew people enough to read from János Szepetneki’s face and hands that he was the kind of man who would steal a gold watch now and then. She kept a tight grip on her purse containing their passports and traveller’s cheques. She was astounded and dismayed that her otherwise tactful husband brought up the watch business in the first place, but what bothered her even more was the deadly silence left in its wake, the kind of silence which comes after one man tells another he stole his watch. She got up from her seat and announced, “I’m going back to the hotel room."

"- Jó - gondolta Mihály. - Én Perugiába utazom. De mit csinál majd Erzsi? Valószínűleg továbbutazik Rómába, és ott vár a következő vonatra. De az is lehet, hogy már a következő állomáson kiszáll. Esetleg visszamegy Terontolába. Akkor sem fog megtalálni. Az nehezen fog eszébe jutni, hogy én a perugiai vonattal utaztam el.","""Good,"" Michael thought. - I'm traveling to Perugia. But what will Erzsi do? He will probably travel on to Rome and wait there for the next train. But he might as well get off at the next station. Maybe go back to Terontola. You won't find it either. It will be hard to remember that I traveled by train from Perugia.","“Great,” thought Mihály. “I’m on my way to Perugia. But what will Erzsi do? Probably go on to Rome and wait there for the following train. But she might also get off at the next station. Perhaps she’ll go back to Terontola. And she won’t find me there. It won’t be easy for her to work out that I left on the Perugia train.","Nice one, thought Mihály. Here he was on his way to Perugia. What about Erzsi? She’d likely to continue on to Rome and wait for the next train. It was also possible she’d get off at the next station. Perhaps go back to Terontola. She wouldn’t find him there. It would not be easy for her to figure out that he had left on the train bound for Perugia."

"- Mihály, ide hallgass. Történetesen megismerkedtem egy Pataki Zoltán nevű úrral, akiről kiderült, hogy a feleséged férje. De ez semmi. Az is kiderült, hogy ez a Pataki még most is halálosan imádja őnagyságát, akár hiszed, akár nem. Vissza akarja venni. Abban reménykedik, hogy most, hogy te dobtad a hölgyet, talán mégis meg fog jönni az esze, és visszamegy hozzá. Ami kétségkívül a legjobb megoldás volna mindhármatok részére. Nem szólsz semmit? Jó. Nem érted még, hogy hol az üzlet, és hogy mi közöm nekem ehhez. De tudod, hogy én már rég leszoktam minden tapintatról. Az én pályámon... Szóval, ide hallgass. Feleséged őnagysága nemcsak hogy nem akar elválni tőled, hanem titokban még mindig abban bízik, hogy ti egykor boldog és békés hitvesek lesztek, talán még gyermekkel is megáldja frigyeteket az ég. Tudja, hogy te más vagy, de nincs fogalma se róla, hogy mi az, amikor valaki más. Nagyon sokat gondol rád, bosszantóan sokat, és olyankor, amikor nem kellene. De azért ne sajnáld. Egészen jól megvan, csak nem akarok pletykálni. Egészen jól megvan nélküled is...","- Mihály, listen here. I happened to meet a gentleman named Zoltán Pataki, who turned out to be your wife's husband. But this is nothing. It has also been revealed that this Pataki still worships His Majesty to death, believe it or not. He wants to take it back. He hopes that now that you've thrown the lady, maybe his mind will come and go back to her. Which would undoubtedly be the best solution for all three. Aren't you saying anything? Good. You still don’t understand where the business is and what I have to do with it. But you know, I've been used to all tact for a long time. On my track ... So, listen here. Not only does your wife's majesty want to divorce you, but she secretly still trusts that you will one day be a happy and peaceful spouse, perhaps even a child will be blessed by heaven. You know you’re different, but you have no idea what it is when someone else is. He thinks a lot about you, an annoying lot, and when he shouldn’t. But don't be sorry. I'm fine, I just don't want to gossip. You're fine without you ...","“Mihály, listen here. I happened to meet a man, a man by the name of Zoltán Pataki, who, it turns out, was your wife’s first husband. But that’s nothing.

He hopes that now you’ve chucked her over, she’ll perhaps come to her senses, and go back to him. Which would undoubtedly be, for all three of you, the best solution. Well, have you nothing to say? Great. You still don’t understand where the business lies in this, and what business it is of mine. But you know me, I gave up tact a long time ago. In my profession … So, listen to this. Your lady wife not only doesn’t want to divorce you, she still secretly believes that one day you’ll make a happy and contented couple, and perhaps heaven will bless the marriage with children. She knows that you’re not like other people, though she really has no idea what that actually means. She thinks about you a very great deal, to the point of nuisance, and at times when she really shouldn’t. But you needn’t feel bad about her. She’s getting along very nicely, though I don’t want to spread gossip. She’s doing very nicely without you.”","János, panting from the climb, spoke rapidly between breaths: “Mihály, listen to me. I happened to meet a Zoltán Pataki who turns out to be none other than your wife’s ex-husband. But that’s not where it ends. Well, it also turns out that this Pataki still worships the ground she walks on, believe it or not. He wants to take her back. He’s hoping that since you abandoned her, she’ll wise up and go back to him. Which would indubitably be best for all three of you. You’re not saying anything. Alright, you don’t see how this could be business, and how it might concern me. You know me well enough to know I’ve given up being tactful way back when. In my line of work… Look, are you listening? … Not only does your dear wife not want a divorce but secretly hopes you’ll reconcile and live in perfect harmony as a loving couple, and, heaven willing, even be blessed with children. She knows you’re not like other men, but has no idea what that means when it comes to you. Thinks about you all the time, too much, to the point of exasperation, and at the worst times.

"- Nem volt nehéz. Évát az a palota tette kísértetlátóvá, a halottak kapuja másokat is megzavart már. Csak arra kellett rábírnom, hogy elmenjen onnét. Meg azután, azt hiszem, egy kissé meg is játszotta az egészet; hiszen ismerted... Attól félek, hogy nem is látta sosem Tamást, víziója sem volt, bár lehet, hogy volt. Nem tudom. Tudod, nekem annyi látomással volt dolgom, és annyi kísértettel az évek során, különösen itt Gubbióban, a halott-kapuk városában, hogy meglehetősen szkeptikus lettem ezen a téren...","- It was not hard. Eve was made haunted by that palace, and the gates of the dead had already disturbed others. I just had to get him out of there.

You know, I've had so many visions and so many ghosts over the years, especially here in Gubbio, the city of the dead gates, that I've become quite skeptical about this ...","“It wasn’t difficult. The old house made her see ghosts. Those doors of the dead have affected others in the same way. I merely had to persuade her to move out. Then again, I believe she played the whole thing up a little. Well, you know Éva … I’m afraid she never actually saw Tamás. She wasn’t having visions. Although it is possible that she was. I can’t say. You know, I’ve had to deal with so many apparitions and ghosts over the years, especially here in Gubbio with its doors of the dead, I’ve become rather sceptical in this respect … ”","“It wasn’t difficult. It all came down to the mansion. Its doors. Strictly speaking, one special door is called ‘porta del morto’ or the ‘gate of the dead,’ the other doors are for the living. Éva wasn’t the first to become unhinged by the gate of the dead. I simply had to convince her to leave the place. Later she did her usual bit of play-acting. A little drama. You know Éva. I’m afraid she never saw Tamás or had visions. Of course, I could be wrong. Dead wrong,” he smiled. “I’ve been involved with so many visions, so many ghosts over the years, especially here in Gubbio. The city of gates. Of the dead. And, to tell you the truth, I’ve become quite the sceptic in this area.”"

"Megírta Tivadarnak, hogy - amint bizonyára úgyis tudja már - Erzsi meg ő szétváltak, de teljes békében, és rövidesen rendezni fog mindent, amint gentlemanhez illik. Hogy miért váltak szét, majd élőszóban elmondja, levélben kissé körülményes volna. Azért nem írt mostanáig, mert nagybetegen feküdt itt, Folignóban, a kórházban. Most már egészséges, de az orvosok azt mondják, hogy még feltétlenül pihenésre van szüksége, és szeretné rekonvaleszcens idejét itt, Olaszországban tölteni. Arra kell tehát kérnie Tivadart, küldjön pénzt. Mégpedig minél előbb és minél többet. Mert pénze már elfogyott, és kénytelen volt egy itteni barátjától kölcsönkérni háromszáz dollárt, és azt szeretné mielőbb visszaadni. A pénzt küldje egyenesen barátja, Richard Ellesley doktor címére. Reméli, hogy otthon mindnyájan jól vannak, és hogy nemsokára viszontlátják egymást. A leveleket is Ellesley címére kéri Folignóba, mert ő innen továbbutazik, de még nem tudja biztosan, hogy hol marad hosszabb ideig.","He wrote to Tivadar that, as you probably already know, Erzsi and he were separated, but in complete peace, and would soon arrange everything as befits a gentleman. Why they split up and then telling him live would be a bit tricky in a letter. He hadn't written until now because he was lying here in a hospital in Foligno with a large patient. He’s healthy now, but doctors say he still absolutely needs a break and wants to spend his reconvalescent time here in Italy. So you have to ask Tivadar to send you money. Namely, as soon as possible and as much as possible. Because he had run out of money and was forced to borrow three hundred dollars from a friend here and wanted to return it as soon as possible. Send the money straight to your friend, Dr. Richard Ellesley. She hopes they are all well at home and that they will see each other again soon. He also asks for letters from Ellesley to Foligno, as he travels on from here, but is not yet sure where to stay for a long time.","He told Tivadar that, as he no doubt already knew, he and Erzsi had separated, but quite amicably, and that as a gentleman he would soon put everything to rights. Just why they had separated, he should say straight out, was too complicated to put in a letter. The reason he had not written earlier was that he had been lying in hospital, very ill, in Foligno. Now he was well again, but the doctors absolutely advised rest, and he would like to spend the period of convalescence here in Italy. So he really had to ask Tivadar to send him some money. In fact, as soon as possible, and as much as possible. His money had run out, and he had had to borrow three hundred dollars from a local friend, which he would like to repay as soon as possible. The money should be sent direct to his friend, at Dr Richard Ellesley’s address. He hoped everyone was well at home, and that they would see each other again soon. Any letters should be sent to the Ellesley address in Foligno, because he was moving on but did not yet know where he would be spending any length of time.","He wrote to Tivadar that — as he no doubt already knew — he and Erzsi separated, quite amicably, and he would shortly take care of everything and do what was proper for a gentleman. Why they had separated he would tell Tivadar in person, to do otherwise would be a little complicated. The reason he’d not written until now was because he had been gravely ill, lying in a hospital bed in Foligno. He was better now, but the doctors said he needed absolute rest, and recommended he convalesce here in Italy. He had no other choice, but to ask Tivadar for money. The more the better, and the sooner the better. Because his funds had completely dried up, he’d had to borrow three hundred dollars from a friend here, and was anxious to repay it as soon as possible. The money should be sent directly to his friend, Dr. Richard Ellesley’s address. He hoped that everybody was doing well at home, and that they’d see one another again soon. All letters should be addressed to Dr. Ellesley’s residence in Foligno, since he had to move on but was not certain where he’d be staying for an extended period."

A rendetlenség mindig zavarba hozta, és ez a rendetlenség méghozzá valahogy a tudomány szentségének tiszteletet parancsoló auráját árasztotta.","He swept a few books from the top of one of the stacks of books, and it turned out that the chair was, and Michael sat down shyly. The mess always confused him, and this mess somehow flooded the awe-inspiring aura of the sanctity of science.","He swept a few books from the top of a tall pile, now revealed as a chair, and Mihály sat down nervously. Chaos always disconcerted him, and in addition this particular chaos somehow exuded an aura that demanded respect for the sanctity of learning.","He swept off some books from a pile, and a chair appeared, into which Mihály sank uneasily. Disorder always made Mihály nervous, although from this disorder emanated an aura of venerable scholarship."

"Mindennap elolvasta az olasz újságokat, nagyon vegyes érzéssel. Élvezte azt a paradox ötletet, hogy az olasz lapokat olaszul írják, ezen a hatalmas, bőséges áradású nyelven, ami napihírekbe törve olyan, mintha egy folyam varrógépet hajtana. De a lapok tartalma mélységesen deprimálta. Az olasz újságok állandóan eksztatikusan boldogok, olyanok, mintha nem is emberek írnák őket, hanem diadalmas szentek, akik éppen most szálltak le Fra Angelico egyik festményéről, hogy a tökéletes államrendet ünnepeljék. Boldogságra mindig van ok, mert egyszer egy intézmény lesz éppen tizenegy, máskor egy út éppen tizenkét éves. Ilyenkor valaki nagyszabású beszédet mond, és a nép lelkesen ünnepli, legalábbis a sajtó tanúsága szerint.","He read the Italian newspapers every day with a very mixed feeling. He enjoyed the paradoxical idea that Italian papers are written in Italian, in this vast, abundantly flooded language that, breaking into the daily news, is like a river driving a sewing machine. But the content of the pages deeply depressed him. Italian newspapers are constantly ecstatically happy, as if they were not written by people, but by triumphant saints who had just descended on a painting by Fra Angelico to celebrate the perfect state order. There is always a reason for happiness, because once an institution will be just eleven, other times a journey will be just twelve. At such times, someone gives a large-scale speech and the people celebrate enthusiastically, at least according to the testimony of the press.","EVERY DAY he read the newspapers, but with rather mixed feelings. He enjoyed the paradox that they were written in Italian, that potent and voluminous language, but (in their case) with the effect of a mighty river driving a sewing-machine. But the contents deeply depressed him. The Italian papers were always ecstatically happy, as if they were written not by humans but by saints in triumph, just stepped down from a Fra Angelico in order to celebrate the perfect social system. There was always some cause for happiness: some institution was eleven years old, a road had just turned twelve. So someone would make a monumental speech, and the people would enthusiastically applaud, at least according to accounts in the press.","Every day he read the Italian newspapers with mixed feelings. He relished the paradox of the Italian press, written in the Italian of the day, how that robust and bountiful sea of a language, once typeset into the daily paper, was nothing more than a sewing-machine driven by a single current. And their content depressed him. The Italian papers always sounded ecstatically happy, as if written not by human beings but by triumphant saints flown down from a Fra Angelico painting to celebrate the perfect state. There was always a reason for a celebration: An institution will sooner or later reach its eleventh year of existence, just as a roadway its twelfth, and on such anniversaries somebody always delivered a pompous speech, and the people cheered wildly, at least according to the papers."
"Ez egy pillanatig tartott, a nő csak éppen hogy megjelent az autó ajtajában, de Mihály felismerte benne, inkább intuíciójával, mint a szemével Ulpius Évát. Mihály is felugrott és úgy látta, hogy Éva tekintete egy pillanatra súrolja őt, sőt mintha valami nagyon vékony mosoly jelennék meg Éva arcán, de mindez egy pillanatig tartott csak, és Éva eltűnt az autóban és az estében.","It took a moment, the woman had just appeared in the door of the car, but Michael recognized her in her intuition rather than Eva Ulpius with her eyes. Michael also jumped up and saw that Eve's gaze was rubbing against him for a moment, and it was as if some very thin smile was appearing on Eve's face, but it only took a moment and Eva disappeared into the car and into the evening.","It took but an instant. The woman had appeared in the open car door for no more than a moment, but Mihály had recognised her, as much by intuition as by sight. It was Éva Ulpius. He too had leapt to his feet, had seen her glance fall on him for just a moment, and caught the very faint smile that appeared on her face. But it was over in a flash, and Éva had disappeared inside the car and vanished into the night.","As the woman materialized in the car door as an afterthought, and more with his mind’s eye than anything else, he recognized Éva Ulpius. Mihály bolted from his chair, certain that when their eyes locked, if only for an instant, a fleeting smile appeared on Éva’s face, before the limousine and the night swallowed her up."
"Ezt a boldogságot sem adták persze ingyen. Ahhoz, hogy otthon lehessek az Ulpius-házban, nekem is el kellett szakadnom a tények világától. Vagy-vagy: nem lehetett kétlaki életet folytatni. Én is leszoktam az újságolvasásról, és szakítottam intelligens barátaimmal. Lassanként engem is olyan hülyének tartottak, mint Tamást; nekem ez nagyon fájt, mert hiú voltam, és tudtam, hogy okos vagyok - de nem lehetett rajta segíteni. Az otthoniaktól teljesen elszakadtam; szüleimhez és testvéreimhez azzal a kimért udvariassággal beszéltem, amelyet Tamástól tanultam; azt a szakadást, ami akkor állt be közöttünk, azóta sem tudtam megszüntetni, bármennyit igyekeztem, és azóta is rossz a lelkiismeretem családommal szemben. Később azután ezt a távolságérzést engedelmességgel igyekeztem korrigálni, de az már más történet...","Of course, this happiness was not given for free either. To be at home in the House of Ulpius, I too had to break away from the world of facts. Or-or: it was not possible to live a two-person life. I also quit reading the newspaper and broke up with my smart friends. Slowly, I was considered as stupid as Thomas; it hurt a lot for me because I was in vain and I knew I was smart - but I couldn’t help it. I was completely detached from my home; I spoke to my parents and brothers with the measured courtesy I learned from Tamás; the rift that then arose between us I have not been able to end since I tried, and my conscience against my family has been bad ever since. Later, I tried to correct this feeling of distance with obedience, but that's a different story ...","“This happiness was not of course without a price. In order to belong to the Ulpius house I had to renounce the objective world. Or rather, it became impossible to lead a double life. I gave up reading newspapers, broke off with my more intelligent friends. Gradually they came to think I was as stupid as Tamás. This really hurt, because I was proud, and I knew I was clever. But it couldn’t be helped. I severed all links with the family at home. To my parents and siblings I spoke with the measured formality I had learnt from Tamás. The rift that this brought between us I have never been able to repair, however hard I try, and ever since I’ve felt guilty towards my family. Later on I laboured to remove this sense of estrangement by being extremely compliant, but that’s another story.","“Such happiness was not without a price. To fit in at the Ulpius house, I had to break with objective reality as I knew it. In short, leading a double-life was no longer an option. I also gave up reading the newspapers and severed ties with my studious friends, who started to say I was as dim-witted as Tamás. I was vain enough to think my intelligence was superior and found their remarks irksome. But it couldn’t be helped. I became estranged from my family. To my parents and siblings I spoke with an aloof courtesy I had picked up from Tamás. The rift I caused I would never be able to repair, no matter what I did, and to this day I feel guilty about my family. Later, I tried to make amends by going out of my way to please them, but that’s another story."

"- Tulajdonképpen nincs is tovább. Ami ezután jön, teljesen értelmetlen. A szobába belépett egy idősebb asszony, különös, régimódi, ellenszenves, nagyszemű nő, és meglehetősen kifejezéstelen arccal kérdezett valamit tőlem. Nem értettem, nem angolul beszélt. Megpróbáltam franciául, németül, magyarul is, de a hölgy szomorúan rázta fejét. Azután valamit mondott egy ismeretlen nyelven, most már növekvő élénkséggel, és közben egyre kérdésekkel ostromolva. Én füleltem, hogy legalább arra jöjjek rá, hogy milyen nyelven beszél. Jó fülem van a nyelvekhez, azokhoz is, amelyeket nem értek: megállapítottam, hogy az a nyelv, amelyen a nő beszél, nem latin, nem germán, nem szláv nyelv, de még csak nem is finnugor, mert valamikor tanultam finnül az egyetemen. És akkor egyszerre biztos voltam benne, hogy azon a nyelven ő beszél egyedül a világon. Hogy miért gondoltam, nem tudom. De annyira megrémültem, hogy felugrottam, és végigrohantam vissza a szobákon át, ki a házból.","- Actually, it's gone. What comes next is completely pointless. An older woman, a strange, old-fashioned, disgusting, big-eyed woman, entered the room and asked me something with a rather expressionless face. I didn't understand, he didn't speak English. I tried French, German and Hungarian, but the lady shook her head sadly. Then he said something in an unfamiliar language, now besieged with increasing vibrancy and meanwhile more and more questions. I listened to at least figure out what language he spoke. I have good ears for languages, even those I don’t understand: I found that the language the woman speaks is not Latin, not Germanic, not Slavic, but not even Finno-Ugric because I once studied Finnish at university. And then at once I was sure he spoke the only language in the world. I don't know why I thought so. But I was so horrified that I jumped up and ran back through the rooms, out of the house.","“Properly speaking, that’s all there was. But what happened next is quite inexplicable. An old lady came into the room, a strange, old-fashioned, repulsive, large-eyed woman, and with a fairly expressionless face asked me something. I didn’t understand, because she wasn’t speaking English. I tried her in French, German, even Hungarian, but she just shook her head sadly. Then she said something in a strange tongue, with much greater expression, besieging me with more and more questions. I listened hard, if only to try and catch what language she was speaking. I have a good ear for languages, especially those I don’t speak. I decided that what she was talking was not Latinate, Germanic, or Slav. It was not even Finno-Ugric, because I had studied Finnish at one stage at university. And then suddenly I just knew that she was the only person in the whole world speaking that language. Where that idea came from, I really don’t know. But I was so horrified I jumped up, rushed out of the room and back home.”","“Actually that’s the end of it. What followed next is a total mystery. Into the room stepped an older woman, strange, old-fashioned, repulsive, with large oafish eyes and a rather bland face. She asked me something. I didn’t understand her. She didn’t speak in English. I tried French, German, even Hungarian, but the woman just shook her head ominously. Then she said something in a strange tongue, this time with growing animation followed by a flurry of questions. I listened, if for no other reason than to guess the language. I have a good ear for languages, even those I don’t understand. I concluded that the tongue the woman spoke was not Italic, Germanic or Slavic, or even Finno-Ugric. Sometime back I studied Finnish at the university. And now I was certain that in the entire world she alone spoke that language. Why I thought so, I don’t know. But in a terror-filled frenzy I jumped up, stormed through all the rooms and out of the house.”"

"Mihály egy szót sem tudott szólni. Csak nézte Ervin arcát, hogy milyen hosszú és sovány lett, és szemét, amelyből kiégett az ifjúkori tűz, és olyan mélységes szomorúság nézett belőle a pillanatnyi örömön keresztül, mint Gubbio házaiból.

He just looked at Ervin's face, how long and thin he was, and the eyes from which the youthful fire had burned, and he looked at him with as deep sadness through momentary joy as from Gubbio's houses. So far, there was only one word for Michael that he was a “monk,” now he understood that Ervin was a monk, and his eyes became teary. He turned his face.","Mihály was unable to say a word. He simply gazed at Ervin’s face, now so long and so thin, and his eyes, in which the youthful fire still blazed. Beneath the happiness of the moment he could see in that face the same profound sombreness he had found in the old Gubbio houses. He could think of only one word, ‘monk’. It was borne in upon him that Ervin really was a monk, and his eyes filled with tears. He turned his face away.","Mihály was speechless. He kept staring at Ervin’s face. It had become drawn, emaciated, and the eyes, no longer blazing with youth, hid a profound sadness behind their momentary glow, not unlike the houses of Gubbio. The word “monk” had always been just a word for Mihály, but now it ached in his throat, because now he understood that Ervin was truly a monk, and his eyes welled up. He had to turn his face away."

"Másnap este a kis piazzán ültek, az egyik kávéház előtt, Erzsi fagylaltot evett, Mihály valami számára ismeretlen, keserű italt próbált ki, de nem volt megelégedve, és törte a fejét, hogy mivel vigye le az ital ízét.","The next night they sat in the small piazza, in front of one of the cafes, Erzsi ate ice cream, Mihály tried a bitter drink unknown to him, but he was not satisfied, and he broke his head to take off the taste of the drink.","The next evening they were sitting in the little piazza outside a café.

"Bementek a kis kocsmába, amelynek szagán kívül legjellegzetesebb vonása a sötétség volt. A szagot Mihály bírta, különös módon az olasz szagok nem zavarták egyébként kényes orrát. Itt még a bűzben is volt valami megrendítő, valami romantikus. De a sötétséget nem szerette. Szepetneki mindjárt kiáltott is lámpáért. A lámpát egy lompos és gyönyörű olasz lány hozta be, nagy fülbevalókkal, villogó szemmel és megdöbbentően soványan. Szepetneki, úgy látszik, már régi ismerőse volt, mert megveregette a lányt, mire az nagy fehér fogakkal mosolygott, és belekezdett egy történetbe, trasteverei tájnyelven, amiből Mihály úgyszólván egy szót sem értett, de János, aki nyelvtehetség volt, mint a szélhámosok általában, szakszerű megjegyzéseket hallatott. A lány bort hozott, leült az asztalukhoz és beszélt. János örömmel hallgatta, Mihályról egészen megfeledkezett. Legfeljebb néha kommentálta magyarul, ilyenformán:","They went into the small pub, the most characteristic feature of which, apart from the smell, was the darkness. The smell was endured by Michael, especially the Italian smells did not disturb his otherwise delicate nose. There was something poignant, something romantic, even in the stench. But he didn't like the darkness. Szepetneki immediately shouted for a lamp. The lamp was brought in by a sloppy and beautiful Italian girl with big earrings, blinking eyes and startlingly skinny. Szepetneki seems to have been an old acquaintance because he patted the girl by the time he smiled with his big white teeth and began a story in the Trastevere dialect, of which Michael, so to speak, did not understand a word, but János, who was as talented as the crooks in general, he made professional remarks. She brought wine, sat down at their table, and spoke. John listened with pleasure, completely forgetting Michael. At most he sometimes commented in Hungarian, like this:","They entered the little tavern, whose strongest feature, apart from the smell, was the darkness. The smell Mihály could tolerate. For some reason the smells of Italy did not bother his normally sensitive nostrils. In this particular smell there was something romantic, a hint of fatality. But the darkness he did not like. Szepetneki immediately shouted for a lamp. It was brought by a ravishing, distinctly slovenly Italian girl, shockingly thin, with flashing eyes and huge earrings. It appeared Szepetneki was an old acquaintance. He slapped her on the back, at which she smiled with her great white teeth and launched into a story in the Trastevere dialect, of which Mihály understood not a single word, though János, who, like all con-men, had a flair for languages, interjected skilfully. The girl brought wine, sat down at the table, and talked. János listened with delight, ignoring Mihály completely, or, at most, offering the occasional comment in Hungarian, such as:","They went into the little tavern, whose chief feature, besides its smell, was its all-encompassing darkness. The smell didn’t bother Mihály. Curiously enough, Italian smells didn’t annoy his otherwise sensitive nostrils. Here, even the pungent smell carried with it a genuine earthiness. But the darkness was a problem. Szepetneki immediately called for a lamp. A lamp was brought out by a slovenly but beautiful girl with blazing eyes and large hoop earrings. But she was rather thin. Szepetneki, it seemed, already knew her, because he kept patting her behind, and she in turn smiled with great appreciation and with great white teeth. She started to tell a story in her Trastevere dialect which Mihály had difficulty following, but which János, a polyglot like most swindlers, kept commenting on with well-oiled efficiency. The girl brought them wine, sat down at their table and continued talking. János listened with delight, nearly forgetting about Mihály. At most, he injected a few quips in Hungarian, which went something like this: “She’s something, isn’t she?”"

"Gyorsan újra felvette blúzát.

"János tapintatos gazember volt. Egész idő alatt nem említette „üzleti ügyüket”.

"Az első fájdalmas pillanat az volt, amikor ez eszébe jutott. Eddig csak tompa, fáradt rosszkedvet érzett, ködöt, amelyben titokzatosan, zölden foszforeszkált az utolsó percek várt teljesedése és a Tamásra való gondolás. De most, hogy szüleire gondolt, erős fájdalmat érzett, erős, világos fájdalmat, a köd kitisztult, sajnálni kezdte szüleit, és sajnálta magát, bután, szentimentálisan, fonákul. Elszégyellte magát, és elővette a töltőtollat, hogy példás fegyelmezettséggel és közönnyel, de azért meleg szavakban bejelentse tettét, nyugodtan, fölénnyel, halálrutinnal.","The first painful moment came to mind. So far, he had only felt a dull, tired mood, a fog in which the expected fulfillment of the last minutes and the thought of Thomas mysteriously phosphoresced green. But now that he thought of his parents, he felt severe pain, strong, light pain, the fog cleared, he began to feel sorry for his parents, and he felt sorry for him, butanely, sentimentally, in the back. He was ashamed of himself and took out his fountain pen to announce his deed with exemplary discipline and indifference, but still in warm words, calmly, with superiority, with a routine of death.","That was the first real moment of pain, when this idea struck him. Until then he had felt nothing more than a weary, dull depression, a fog, through which filtered the mysterious green glitter of the awaited climax of his last moments, and his thoughts of Tamás. But as he began to consider his parents he felt a sharp pang, a sharp, bright pang: the fog cleared, and he began to pity them, and to pity himself, stupidly, sentimentally, absurdly. Feeling ashamed, he took out his pen. With exemplary discipline and detachment, but therefore in words warm with feeling, he would announce his deed, calmly, masterfully, as one experienced in death.","This was his first painful moment. Earlier, the feeling had been a vague tiredness, low spirits, fog, in which he waited for his last moments to float mysteriously toward their fulfilment and Tamás as some kind of glittering phosphorescence. But now that he thought of his parents, the fog lifted and left in its wake a twinge of pain that became acute and crushing. He started to feel sorry for his parents and for himself. And he felt maudlin and foolish. It was in this mood that he took out his fountain pen to write in loving and carefully formed characters what he was about to do, calmly, competently, with the practiced efficiency of someone versed in death."

"- Ez mind igaz. Ezek a népek valószínűleg még sokkal jobban féltek a haláltól, mint mi. Mi a civilizációtól már olyan nagyszerű lelki apparátust kapunk készen, hogy életünk túlnyomó részében el tudjuk felejteni, hogy egyszer meghalunk; lassanként a halált éppúgy félre fogjuk tolni a tudatból, mint ahogy már félretoltuk Isten létezését. Ez a civilizáció. De az archaikus ember számára semmi sem volt jelenvalóbb, mint a halál és a halott, maga a halott, akinek titokzatos továbblétezése, sorsa, bosszúja állandóan foglalkoztatta. Rettenetesen féltek a haláltól és a halottaktól, csakhogy az ő lelkükben még inkább ambivalens volt minden, mint a miénkben, a nagy ellentétek még közelebb voltak egymáshoz. Halálfélelem és halálvágy egészen közeli szomszédok voltak a lelkükben, és a félelem sokszor vágy volt és a vágy sokszor félelem.","- It's all true. These peoples were probably far more afraid of death than we were. We already have such a great spiritual apparatus ready from civilization that for the vast majority of our lives we can forget that we will die once; we will slowly push death aside from consciousness as we have pushed God’s existence aside. This is civilization. But for the archaic man there was nothing more present than death and the dead, the dead himself, whose mysterious survival, fate, revenge was constantly preoccupied with him. They were terribly afraid of death and the dead, but in their souls everything was even more ambivalent than in ours, the great differences were even closer. Fear of death and desire for death were very close neighbors in their souls, and fear was often desire, and desire was often fear.","“That’s all true. These peoples probably feared death even more than we do. Our civilisation presents us with a marvellous mental machinery designed to help us forget, for most of our lives, that one day we too will die. In time we manage to push death out of our consciousness, just as we have done with the existence of God. That’s what civilisation does. But for these archaic peoples nothing was more immediately apparent than death and the dead, I mean actual dead people, whose mysterious para-existence, fate, and vengeful fury constantly preoccupied them. They had a tremendous horror of death and the dead. But then of course in their minds everything was more ambiguous than it is for us. Opposites sat much closer. The fear of death and the desire for death were intimately juxtaposed in their minds, and the fear was often a form of desire, the desire a form of fear.”","“All that is true,” Waldheim said. “These people were probably a great deal more afraid of death than we are. Civilization gives us such ready-made psychological templates that most of our lives we’re able to forget that one of these days we’re going to die. Eventually we’ll put it out of mind as we have God’s existence. This is civilization. But for ancient man, nothing was more immediate than death and the dead, whose shrouded after-life, destiny, vengeance, continually obsessed them. They were immensely afraid of death and the dead, except their psyches were much more ambivalent than ours. The great contraries lay closer to each other then. Death-fear and death-wish were more than just neighbours, and many times the fear was a wish and the wish a fear.”"
"Mihályt mérhetetlenül meglepte apjának váratlan megjelenése, de domináló érzése mégsem a meglepetés volt. Nem is a zavar és szégyen, amikor apja körülnézett a szobában, görcsösen igyekezve, hogy arca ne árulja el az undorodást, amelyet a szegényes környezet kivált belőle. Egy más érzés töltötte el Mihályt, egy érzés, amit kisebb mértékben ismert régebbről, abból az időből, amikor gyakran volt külföldön. Akkor is mindig ez fogta el, ha hosszabb idő után hazaérkezett: a rémület azon, hogy apja közben öregebb lett. De ennyit, nem, ennyit még sosem öregedett apja. Hiszen mikor utoljára látta, még mindig az a parancsoló gesztusú, magabiztos férfi volt, akinek egész életében ismerte. Vagy legalábbis még annak látta, mert most már évek óta otthon élt, és ha közben végbe is ment valami változás apján, nem vette észre a lassú átalakulást. Annál élesebben látta most, miután néhány hónapig nem találkozott apjával. Az idő betört az arcra és az alakra. Valami, nem sok, de tagadhatatlanul jelenvaló aggastyánosság volt apjában: szája elvesztette régi feszességét, szeme fáradt és beesett (igaz, hogy egész éjjel utazott, ki tudja, talán harmadikon, amilyen takarékos ember), haja még fehérebb, beszéde mintha kevésbé szabatos lenne, valami furcsa és első percben ijesztő selypesség van benne - nem lehet megmondani, mi az, de itt van egész szörnyű valóságában a tény: apja öreg már.","Michael was immensely surprised by his father's unexpected appearance, but his dominant feeling was not a surprise. Not even the embarrassment and shame as his father looked around the room, convulsively trying to keep his face from betraying the disgust the poor environment had caused him. A different feeling filled Michael, a feeling he knew to a lesser extent from an older time, when he was often abroad. He was always caught up when he came home after a long time: the horror of getting older during his father's life. But so much, no, his father has never been so old. For when he last saw her, he was still the confident, confident man he had known all his life. Or at least he still saw it because he had lived at home for years now, and even if something had changed in his father, he hadn't noticed the slow transformation. He saw it all the more sharp now after not meeting his father for a few months. Time broke into the face and shape. There was something, not much, but undeniably present in his father: his mouth had lost his old firmness, his eyes were tired and sunken (it is true that he had traveled all night, who knows, perhaps a third, as a frugal man), his hair was even whiter, his speech seemed less precise, there’s something strange and scary about silk in it at first - you can’t tell what it is, but here’s the whole awful reality: the father is old now.","Mihály was immensely surprised at his father’s unexpected appearance, but surprise was not in fact his predominant feeling. Nor indeed was it the embarrassment and shame when his father looked around the room, struggling painfully to stop his face betraying his horror at the shabby milieu. A quite different feeling filled him, a feeling he had known of old, in lesser degree, in the days when he often went abroad. The same feeling had always affected him when he came home from his longer absences: the terror that his father had in the meantime grown older. But never, never, had his father aged so much. When he had last seen him he was still the self-confident man of the commanding gestures he had known all his life. Or at least that was how Mihály had still thought of him, because he had then been at home for some years, and if any change had occurred in his father during that time he had not noticed its gradual workings. He now registered it all the more sharply because he had not seen his father for a few months. Time had punished his face and his figure. There were just a few, but quite undeniable, signs of anxiety: his mouth had lost its old severity, his eyes were tired and sunken (true, he had been travelling all night, who knows, perhaps third class, he was such a parsimonious man), his hair was even whiter, his speech seemed rather less precise, with a strange, and at first quite alarming hint of a lisp. It was impossible to say exactly what it was, but there was the fact, in all its dreadful reality. His father had grown old.","Mihály was, to say the least, surprised by his father’s unexpected appearance, yet the prevailing sentiment was not one of surprise. Nor was it shame and humiliation when his father looked around the room, trying hard to conceal his disgust for his son’s shabby life. Another kind of sentiment overwhelmed Mihály, familiar but to a lesser degree, something from an earlier time when his father spent long periods abroad. He’d felt the same way then, after his father returned from a long absence. The sentiment was always one of fear. He had been afraid, almost horrified, that while his father was gone he had aged and so much. But this much? Never. When Mihály had last seen him, he was still that cocksure businessman he’d known all his life. Or at least that’s how he remembered him, because then he’d been at home for years, and, if his father changed at all, the transformation had been too gradual to notice. He saw him all the more clearly now after a hiatus of several months. Time had wreaked havoc on the face and body. There was something frail and elderly about his father, not much, but it was undeniable: his firm mouth was slack, the eyes haggard, sunken (of course he’d been travelling all night, perhaps third class, the miser that he was), his hair much whiter, his speech a bit less precise, and that odd lisp, so upsetting to hear that first minute. It was difficult if not impossible to express in words what he saw now in its awful starkness as fact: his father had grown old."

"Most tisztán hallotta, hogy a falon túl énekelnek, többen, valószínűleg férfiak, valami jajgató és semmire sem hasonlító dalt, amelyben bizonyos kivehető, de érthetetlen szavak ritmikusan visszatérnek. Mélységes és megrendítő fájdalom volt ebben a dalban, de valami nem emberi, emberen inneni is, valami az állatok elnyúlt éjszakai jajgatására emlékeztető, valami fájdalom, ami még a fák korából maradt fenn, a pineák korából. Mihály leült a pinea alá, és behunyta szemét. Nem, nem is férfiak ezek, akik odaát énekelnek, hanem asszonyok, és már látta is őket maga előtt, különös társaságot, még leginkább Naconxipanra emlékeztetett, az őrült Gulácsy festette csodaország lakóira, erős, bódítóan lilaszínű ruhákban, azután arra gondolt, hogy isteneket sirathattak így, Attist, Adonist... Tamást, Tamást, aki megsiratatlanul halt meg az idők kezdetén, és most felravatalozva fekszik odaát a falon túl, arcán a holnapi hajnal dereng.","Now he could clearly hear them singing beyond the wall, several, probably men, some wailing and nothing-like song in which certain removable but incomprehensible words returned rhythmically. There was a profound and shocking pain in this song, but something non-human to drink in as well as something reminiscent of the elongated wailing of the animals, something that survived from the age of the trees, the age of the pines. Michael sat under the pinea and closed his eyes. No, these are not men singing over there, but women, and he had already seen them in front of him, a strange company, most reminiscent of Naconxipan, the inhabitants of the crazy wonderland painted by Gulácsy, in strong, intoxicating purple clothes, then he thought they could mourn the gods so, Attist, Adonis ... Tamás, Tamás, who died indiscriminately at the beginning of time, and now lies buried over the wall, tomorrow dawn on his face.","Now he could hear quite distinctly that the voices beyond the wall were singing, and there were several of them, probably men, intoning a dirge unlike anything ever heard, in which certain distinct but unintelligible words rhythmically recurred. There was a profound, tragic desolation in the song, something not quite human, from a different order of experience, something reminiscent of the howling of animals on long dark nights, some ancient grief from the great age of trees, from the era of the umbrella pines. Mihály sat back under the pine and closed his eyes. No, the singers beyond the wall were not men but women, and he could already see them in his mind’s eye, a strange company, something out of Naconxipan, the mad Gulácsy painting of the denizens of wonderland in their oppressive lilac-coloured attire, and he thought that this was how one would mourn for the death of a god, Attis, Adonis, Tamás … Tamás, who had died unmourned at the beginning of time, and now lay in state out there beyond the wall, with the sunrise of tomorrow dawning on his face.","They sang clearly on the other side of the wall, men probably, a keening chant unlike anything else, in which certain distinct yet nonsensical words returned with a rhythmic insistence. A deep and tragic note ran through the melody, not a human voice so much, but beyond that, more like an animal howl in the night, an ancient cry of pain, left over from the age of balsam, from the age of trees. Mihály sat down, leaned against the balsam tree and closed his eyes. These were not men’s voices from the other side but the voices of women, and already they were passing in front of him in a curious cast, reminding him of the surreal world of Nakonxipan in a Gulácsy painting, its haunting figures dressed in flowing lilac-hued vestments, and it occurred to him that they were mourning the gods, Attis, Adonis… and Tamás Ulpius, his dear friend Tamás, who had to die unmourned, who lay in state now since the beginning of time, over whose pale features day was breaking on the other side of the wall."

"Másnap csakugyan elmentek a Valle Giuliába. Megnézték a sírokat, a szarkofágokat, amelyek fedelén az öreg halott etruszkok vígan éltek, ettek, ittak és ölelgették feleségüket, hirdetve az etruszk filozófiát, amit ugyan le sosem írtak, mert az etruszkok oly bölcsek voltak, hogy irodalmat egyáltalán nem fejlesztettek ki kulturális életük folyamán, ellenben a szobrok arcáról félreérthetetlenül le lehet olvasni: csak a pillanat számít, és a szép pillanat sosem múlik el.","The next day they did go to the Valle Giulia. They looked at the tombs, the sarcophagi, on the cover of which the old dead Etruscans lived happily, ate, drank and hugged their wives, proclaiming Etruscan philosophy, which was never described because the Etruscans were so wise that they did not develop a cultural life at all. , but the face of the sculptures can be read unequivocally: only the moment matters, and the beautiful moment never passes.","THE NEXT DAY they did indeed visit the Villa Giulia. They looked at the graves and the sarcophagi, with their lids supporting terracotta statues of the old Etruscan dead enjoying their lives—eating, drinking, embracing their spouses, and proclaiming the Etruscan philosophy. This, being wise enough not to have developed literature in the evolution of their cultural life, they never committed to writing, though of course it can be read unmistakably on the faces of their statues: only the present matters, and moments of beauty are eternal.","The following day they did go to the Valle Giulia. They saw the stone coffins, the sarcophagi, adorned with statues and terracotta reliefs showing the ancient Etruscan dead living merrily, eating, drinking, carousing, embracing their women, and spreading the Etruscan gospel, which in their infinite wisdom they had never written down, never pausing long enough to develop a literature to express their cultural singularity. Yet their way was unmistakably carved on their statues’ faces: only the moment counts, and the beauty of the moment shall never pass."

"Pedig ekkor éppen nagyon kellemesen kezdett alakulni a hangulat, mindenkin erőt vett az a szubtilisebb és erősebb részegség, amit már nem az alkohol vált ki, hanem az éjszaka. Az ember túljut az alvásküszöbön, végképp elmúlt az az idő, amikor le szokott feküdni, most már úgyis mindegy, most már lelkiismeret-furdalása sincs, és nyugodtan átengedi magát az éjszakának. Waldheim a Szép Helénából énekelt részleteket, Mihály egy lengyel asszonnyal foglalkozott, és minden nagyon kellemes volt, mikor megint meghallotta azt az éneket. Bocsánatot kért, és felment a domb tetejére, egyedül állt ott, kis szívdobogással és feszülten figyelve, mintha minden attól függne, hogy ezt a rejtélyt megoldja.","Yet it was at this time that the mood began to develop very pleasantly, the more subtle and stronger drunkenness that was no longer triggered by alcohol, but by night. One gets past the threshold of sleep, the time when he used to lie down is over, now it doesn't matter anyway, he doesn't have a remorse anymore, and he calmly gives in to the night. Waldheim sang the details from the Beautiful Helena, Michael dealt with a Polish woman, and everything was very pleasant when she heard that song again. He apologized and went up to the top of the hill, standing alone there, with a small heartbeat and watching intently, as if everything depended on solving this mystery.","They did so just at a time when the general mood had begun to develop agreeably, as everyone slipped towards the subtler, deeper stages of drunkenness, the effect of the night rather than the alcohol. They had passed beyond the threshold of dreams, the habitual hour of sleep. Now distinctions were becoming blurred, rational morality was in retreat as they surrendered themselves to the night. Waldheim was singing extracts from The Fair Helen, Mihály was busy with a Polish lady and everything was quite delightful, when he again heard the voices. He excused himself, went back to the top of the mound, and stood there alone, his heart palpitating in the tenseness of his concentration, as if everything depended on resolving this enigma.","Just as the mood of the evening was perking up not so much from the cocktails as from the intoxicating power of the night, Mihály found himself in that strange twilight on the threshold of sleep when it no longer mattered anymore how late it was, when nothing mattered, and he could simply surrender to the night. Waldheim sang portions of Beautiful Helena, Mihály occupied himself with a Polish woman, and everything was quite pleasant, when the wailing sound came to him with even greater insistence. Excusing himself, he climbed to the top of the mound and just stood there alone and frightened, with his heart in his throat, as if everything depended on his solving this riddle of the voices."

"Hosszúra nyúlt vándorévei alatt mindenfelé megfordult, Angliában és Franciaországban éveket töltött, de Olaszországot mindig elkerülte, úgy érezte, még nincs itt az ideje, még nem készült fel rá. Olaszországot is a felnőtt dolgok közé tette el, mint az ivadékok nemzését, titokban félt is tőle, félt, mint az erős napsütéstől, a virágok szagától és a nagyon szép nőktől.","During his long wanderings, he turned everywhere, spent years in England and France, but always avoided Italy, he felt he didn’t have time yet, he wasn’t ready for it yet. He also put Italy among the adult things as the birth of offspring, secretly afraid of it, afraid of the strong sunshine, the smell of flowers, and the very beautiful women.","During his protracted years of wandering he had travelled in many lands, and spent long periods in France and England. But Italy he had always avoided, feeling the time had not yet come, that he was not yet ready for it. Italy he associated with grown-up matters, such as the fathering of children, and he secretly feared it, with the same instinctive fear he had of strong sunlight, the scent of flowers, and extremely beautiful women.","His far-reaching travels had taken him everywhere. He’d spent years in France and England, but always avoided Italy, feeling the timing was never quite right, that he wasn’t prepared for it just yet.

"Ettől kezdve mindent, ami történt, az utolsó nap és éjszaka groteszken szomorú távlataiban élt át. Amint végignyüzsögtek a Trastevere szűk utcáin, és oda-odakiáltottak nyüzsgő ismerőseiknek, amint beözönlöttek a kis templomba, és minden mozdulatuk olyan furcsán fürge és kicsiny volt, mindig tisztábban látta maga előtt:","From then on, he experienced everything that had happened in his grotesquely sad perspectives on the last day and night. As they bustled through the narrow streets of Trastevere and shouted back and forth to their bustling acquaintances as they flooded into the little church and their every move was so strangely agile and small, he could always see more clearly in front of him:","From then on he lived through everything that happened from the grotesque, melancholy perspective of the last day and night on earth. Remembering how they had crowded through the narrow Trastevere streets, shouting out here and there to their teeming friends as they swarmed along to the little church, their every movement so strangely nimble and busily diminutive, he saw with ever greater clarity:","He was experiencing what was happening to him through the grotesque vision of the Last Judgment. As the people swarmed through the Trastevere’s narrow alleys, shouting to acquaintances pouring into the tiny church, their small and squiggly movements reminded him of one thing only."
"- Persze. Igazam is volt. Csak jobb szó híján nevezem szerelemnek azt, amit Éva iránt éreztem. Ez az érzés semmiben sem hasonlított ahhoz, ahogy téged szeretlek, és ahogy egy-két elődödet szerettem, ne haragudj. Valahogy egészen a negatívuma annak. Téged azért szeretlek, mert hozzám tartozol, őt azért, mert nem tartozott hozzám - az, hogy téged szeretlek, önbizalmat és erőt ad, az, hogy őt szerettem, megalázott és megsemmisített... persze ezek szónokias antitézisek csak. Akkor úgy éreztem, hogy a régi játék valósággá válik, és én lassan elpusztulok a nagy beteljesedésben. Elpusztulok Éva miatt, Éva által, úgy ahogy megjátszottuk kamaszkorunkban.","- Of course. I was right. For lack of a better word, I call love what I felt for Eve. That feeling was nothing like the way I love you, and the way I loved one or two of your predecessors, don’t be angry. Somehow quite the downside to that. I love you because you belong to me, because he didn’t belong to me - the fact that I love you gives me confidence and strength, the fact that I loved him, humiliated and destroyed ... of course these are just rhetorical antitheses. Then I felt like the old game was becoming a reality and I was slowly perishing in the great fulfillment. I will perish because of Eve by Eve as we played in our teens.","“Of course. I was quite right to. It’s only for want of a better word that I call what I felt for her, love. That feeling wasn’t in the least like the feeling I have for you, and had, if you’ll forgive me, for one or two of your predecessors. In a way it was quite the reverse. I love you because you’re part of me. I loved Éva because she wasn’t. That’s to say, loving you gives me confidence and strength, but when I loved her, it humiliated and annihilated me … Of course these expressions are merely antithetical. When it happened, I felt that the truth of the old plays was supreme, and I was being slowly destroyed in the great climax. I was being destroyed because of Éva, through Éva, just as we had played it in our adolescence.”","“Naturally. And rightly so. I’m calling what I felt for Éva love, for lack of a better word. In no way does it resemble what I feel for you or — forgive me — the way I felt toward one or two of your predecessors. I would venture to say it’s quite the opposite. I love you because you belong to me, and her because she didn’t. Loving you is a positive: you give me confidence and strength. Loving her was a negative: she humiliated and destroyed me. Of course these are just rhetorical opposites. What I felt then was that the old game was becoming too real, and I’d be destroyed in its fulfilment. I would be destroyed because of Éva and by Éva in the manner of our adolescent plays.”"
"Megint olyan mosollyal, amelyben az elismerés a saját bőkezűségének szólt: hogy hajlandó drágább helyen is kifizetni a saját fogyasztását, Mihály kedvéért.","Again with a smile in which the recognition was for his own generosity: that he was willing to pay for his own consumption in a more expensive place, for Michael's sake.","Again came the smile that spoke consciousness of great generosity, as he added that, also as a favour to Mihály, he would be quite happy to pay for his own drinks in the more expensive place.",The grin appearing on his face was an acknowledgment of his clever generosity.

I can't fall now.","He took a few steps in the courtyard, then staggered and fell. And that was very pleasant.

It was more like he had been expecting this meeting for a long time.","But this was mere cordiality. It was clear from his tone that he was not in the least surprised. Rather, it was as if he had long anticipated this meeting.","To Mihály, the words tumbled out of Ervin’s mouth with a sense of renewed kinship, for they were a familiar refrain from their childhood folk tales.

Great ascetics will not be from cold and impassive people, but from the most fiery, those who have something to give up. That is why the Church does not allow a gelding to be a priest.","“Because, my dear, in the spiritual life opposites meet. It’s not the cold passionless ones who become great ascetics, but the most hot-blooded, people with something worth renouncing. That’s why the Church won’t allow eunuchs to become priests.”","“Spiritual sacrifice requires the conflict of opposites, my dear. Ascetics are not born of cold passionless beings but those with fire in their veins who have something worth sacrificing. That’s why the Church never allowed eunuchs to become priests.”"

"Nem is tudnám megmondani, miből állt ez a változás, amit szüleim oly nyugtalanul észleltek. Igaz, hogy a két Ulpius minden tekintetben megkövetelte, hogy az ember alkalmazkodjék hozzájuk, és én szívesen, sőt boldogan alkalmazkodtam is. Leszoktam a jó tanulásról. Revideáltam véleményeimet, és undorodtam egy csomó dologtól, ami addig tetszett nekem: a katonaságtól és a harctéri dicsőségtől, az osztálytársaimtól, a magyaros ételektől, mindentől, amire az iskolában azt mondhatták volna, hogy „stramm” vagy „jó pofa”. Abbahagytam a futballt, amit addig szenvedéllyel űztem; a vívás volt az egyetlen megengedett sport, azt annál nagyobb szorgalommal gyakoroltuk mind a hárman. Rengeteget olvastam, hogy Tamással lépést tartsak, bár ez nem esett nehezemre. Ebből az időből datálódik érdeklődésem a vallástörténet iránt, amiről azután később leszoktam, mint annyi másról, mikor megkomolyodtam.","I couldn’t even tell you what this change was about, which my parents noticed so uneasily. It is true that the two Ulpiuses in every way required man to conform to them, and I gladly and even happily adapted. I'm used to learning well. I revised my opinions and disgusted with a lot of things that I liked until then: the military and the glory on the battlefield, my classmates, the Hungarian food, everything the school could say “stramm” or “good muzzle”. I quit the football I had been passionate about until then; fencing was the only sport allowed, the more diligent we all practiced it. I read a lot to keep up with Tamás, although I didn’t have a hard time. It is from this time that my interest in the history of religion dates back, which I then quit later than so many others when I became serious.","“I really couldn’t say what caused this change which my parents noted with such alarm. It’s true that Tamás and Éva demanded absolutely that one should fit in with them, and I heartily, even happily, went along with this. I ceased to be a good student. I revised my opinions and came to despise a whole lot of things which up till then I had liked—soldiers and military glory, my classmates, native Hungarian cooking—everything that would have been described in school terms as ‘cool’ and ‘good fun’. I gave up football, which until then I had followed passionately. Fencing was the only permissible sport, and the three of us trained for it with all the more intensity. I read voraciously to keep up with Tamás, although this wasn’t difficult for me. My interest in religious history dates from this time. Later, I gave it up, like so many other things, when I became more serious.","“There’s no way I can explain all the changes that alarmed my parents so much. True, Tamás and Éva demanded I conform to them in every respect, which I did. And happily. I disciplined myself against my studies. I revised my opinions, and I developed an aversion for a number of things which I used to like: the military and glory in battle, my classmates, my favourite Hungarian dishes, all the things my school friends raved about like a ‘swell time’ or a ‘great game’. I gave up soccer, a game I’d pursued passionately. Fencing remained the only sport we allowed ourselves, and the three of us trained like professionals. I read immense amounts to keep up with Tamás, although this wasn’t a hardship. My interest in religious history began at this time, but as with so many other things, I gave it up once I became a responsible adult."

Do you think I wouldn’t have happily gone with that Persian if he had asked me? But did he ask me? It was in his mind. What a wonderful man! Otherwise, you did well not to get involved with this Szepetneki. He’s very good-looking, I won’t deny, and very much the man, but I have the feeling … look, what I’m trying to say, but you know this already, he’s a crook. He’ll end up taking your money. ‘ Take very great care, my child.’ He once stole five hundred francs from me on a similar occasion. So, night night.”","“Surely. But then she should stay clear of men. Here, it’s the only way to preserve any semblance of decency. Just do what I do. What’s the big deal about decency anyhow? Well, what is it? You think I wouldn’t have gone off with that Persian, if he’d only asked me? Did he ask me? Uppermost in his mind, I’m sure. What a beautiful man! You were smart, by the way, not to go with this Szepetneki. I’m not saying he’s not good looking and masculine , you know what I mean, but he’s still a gangster. May even take your money. You have to be very careful, kiddo. Once someone stole five hundred francs from me in a situation like this. All right, sweet dreams.”"

"Hajnalban felébredt a hidegre és az első világosságra, és álmosan szétnézett a kertben. A ciprusok alján mindenfelé sírkeresztek álltak: a városka camposantójában, temetőjében aludt! Hiszen ebben még nem lett volna semmi borzasztó; az olasz halottak városai talán még az élőkénél is barátságosabbak és hívogatóbbak, nappal is, és holdvilágban is. De Mihály számára ennek is rettentő, szimbolikus jelentősége volt. Megint futva menekült, és ettől kezdve lehet számítani tulajdonképpen a betegség kitörését. Ami azután történt vele, arra később nem tudott visszaemlékezni.","He woke up at dawn to the cold and the first light and looked sleepily in the garden. At the bottom of the cypresses stood crosses everywhere: he slept in the camposanto, the cemetery of the town! For this would not have been terrible; the cities of the Italian dead are perhaps even friendlier and more inviting than the living ones, even during the day and moonlight. But for Michael, this also had a terrible, symbolic significance. He fled again, and from then on, an outbreak of the disease can actually be expected. What happened to him afterwards he could not recall later.","He awoke at dawn, with cold and the first light, and looked sleepily around the garden. At the foot of the cypress trees, extending in all directions, stood crosses marking graves. He had slept in the town’s garden of rest, the cemetery. Nothing could have been more horrible. By day, and perhaps also by moonlight, the Italian cities of the dead were indeed perhaps more friendly and inviting than those of the living, but for Mihály the episode had a horrific symbolic meaning. Again he fled in terror, and from that moment one might properly date the onset of his illness. What happened to him afterwards he was unable to recall.","At dawn he woke to the cold and the first light of day, and with unfocused eyes looked around the garden. Tombstones with crosses fanned out in all directions under the cypresses. He had slept in the town’s campo santo. The cemetery. By itself, this was not so terrible. In Italy, be in the moonlight or the light of day, the land of the dead looked more inviting than the land of the living. But Mihály, as usual, was all too aware of its symbolic portent. He fled once again, running as if he were pursued by a ghost, and this marked the true onset of his illness. What happened to him next he could not remember."

"Lassanként az is kibontakozott, hogy a lány igen gazdag philadelphiai szülők gyermeke, hogy odahaza igen nagy tekintélynek örvend a jó társaságban, legalábbis ő úgy tudja magáról, és úgy látszik, valami rousseau-ista hajlam szállta meg a magány és a természet iránt, amit a számára Európa jelentett. Párizsban, Bécsben és egyéb jó helyeken hallgatott féléveket - de semmi sem fogott rajta. Megőrizte szellemének amerikai romlatlanságát.","Gradually, it also unfolded that the girl, a child of very wealthy Philadelphia parents, enjoys great prestige in good company at home, at least she knows about herself, and there seems to be some rousseauist tendency toward loneliness and nature that the for Europe. He listened to semesters in Paris, Vienna, and other good places — but nothing caught him. He preserved the American integrity of his spirit.","It gradually emerged that she was the daughter of wealthy Philadelphia parents who enjoyed considerable influence in high society, at least as she saw it, but that some Rousseauistic tendency in her drove her towards solitude and nature, which from her point of view meant Europe. She had attended study semesters in Paris, Vienna and other fine places, but none of it had had any effect. Her soul had preserved its American innocence.","Bit by bit she let them know she was the daughter of well-to-do Philadelphia parents, and that at home she enjoyed quite a reputation among good society , at least that was her impression, and it seemed she was possessed by a Rousseauian tendency toward solitude and nature, which Europe embodied for her.

"- Talán igaza van Patakinak - gondolta -, hogy nagyon is elvont és befelé fordult természet vagyok. Persze ez szimplifikáció, az ember sosem ilyen megfogalmazható, de annyi biztos, hogy rendkívül ügyetlen és inkompetens vagyok a világ dolgaiban, egyáltalában nem vagyok az a férfi, akinek nyugodt felsőségében megbízhat egy asszony. Márpedig Erzsi az a nő, aki szereti teljesen rábízni magát valakire, szereti tudni, hogy valakihez feltétlenül odatartozik: nem az anyáskodó asszonyok közül való - talán ezért is nincs gyereke -, hanem azok közül, akik a szeretőjük gyermeke szeretnének lenni. Istenem, milyen szerencsétlen lesz előbb-utóbb mellettem, aki, azt hiszem, még tábornok is könnyebben lehetnék, mint hogy apaszerepet játsszak, ez az a humánum, ami teljesen hiányzik belőlem, többek közt. Nem bírom, ha valaki függ tőlem, akárha kiszolgáló személyzet formájában, azért csináltam mindent egyedül legénykoromban. Nem bírom elviselni a felelősséget, és rendszerint meggyűlölöm azokat, akik várnak tőlem valamit...","""Perhaps Pataki is right,"" he thought, ""that I am a very abstract and introverted nature."" Sure, it’s a simulation, a man can never be so articulate, but I’m so sure I’m extremely clumsy and incompetent in the things of the world, I’m not at all the man a woman can trust in her calm superiority. And Erzsi, the woman who loves to trust her completely, loves to know that she definitely belongs to someone: not one of the mothering women - maybe that's why she doesn't have a child - but one of those who wants to be the child of their lover. God, how unfortunate it will be next to me, who, I think, could be even easier than a general, than to play the role of a father, is the humanity I completely miss, among other things. I can’t stand someone dependent on me, even in the form of service staff, that’s why I did everything alone when I was a boy. I can't stand the responsibility, and I usually hate those who expect something from me ...","“Perhaps it’s true what Pataki says,” he thought. “I am so abstracted and introverted by nature. Of course that’s a simplification—no-one can ever be so neatly categorised—but this much is certain, that I am singularly useless and incompetent in all practical matters, and generally not the man in whose calm superiority a woman can trust. And Erzsi is precisely the sort of woman who loves to entrust herself to someone, who likes to know that she belongs completely to someone. She isn’t one of those motherly types (perhaps that’s why she has no children) but one of those who really want to be their lover’s child. My God, how deceived she is going to be in me, sooner or later. I could more easily become a Major-General than play the role of father. That’s one human quality I completely lack, amongst others. I can’t bear it when people depend on me, not even servants. That’s why I did everything on my own, as a boy. I hate responsibility and I always come to despise people who expect things from me.","Perhaps Pataki was right, Mihály thought. He was rather aloof and introverted by nature. Of course this might be an oversimplification. No person was ever that easy to characterize, but this much was certain: He was exceptionally clumsy and incompetent when it came to worldly things, hardly the man of quiet confidence who inspired trust in a woman. And Erzsi was the kind of woman who liked to depend on a man, and she liked knowing she belonged to someone completely. She was not the mothering type — perhaps that was why she has no children — she was really more of a child herself who needed a father figure. My God, thought Mihály, sooner or later she was going to be sorely disappointed if she expected him to be a father to her. It would’ve been easier for him to be a general than a father. Among other things, fatherhood was one human condition totally alien to his nature. He couldn’t bear anyone being dependent on him, including servants. From the time he was a child, he had done everything for himself. He couldn’t and wouldn’t bear any kind of responsibility for anyone other than himself, and he despised those who expected something from him."

"De aznap éjszaka, mikor testük jóllakva elvált egymástól, és Mihály egyedül maradt abban a súlyos egyedüllétben, amit akkor érez az ember, amikor olyan nővel ölelkezett, akihez semmi köze sincs, megint megnyílt az örvény (vagy csak eszébe jutott?), és ezúttal nagyon sokáig tartott. Tudta, hogy csak a kezét kellene kinyújtania, hogy megérezze a másik, a kedves test jóleső realitását, de nem tudta kezét sem kinyújtani, és magányosan gyötrődött, úgy tetszett, órák hosszat.","But that night, when their bodies were separated, and Michael was left alone in the serious loneliness he feels when he hugged a woman he had nothing to do with, the vortex opened again (or did he just remember?), And this time very took a long time. He knew he would only have to reach out to feel the benevolent reality of the other, the lovely body, but he couldn't reach out either, and he was lonely alone, he liked it for hours.","But that evening, when their sated bodies finally turned away from each other, and he was alone in that profound solitude that a man feels after he has embraced a woman with whom he has nothing in common, the whirlpool opened again (or was he just remembering it?) and this time it remained. He knew he had only to stretch out his hand to feel the presence of the other person, the comforting reality of the friendly body. But he could not bring himself to reach out, and he lay in solitary distress, by choice, for endless hours.","That night, once their spent bodies separated, Mihály found himself in that profound loneliness he’d felt after making love to someone he wasn’t really attached to. As if on cue the abyss opened up again (or did some half-conscious memory bring it on?) and this time it lingered. He had only to reach out his hand to take comfort in knowing Millicent’s body was real, but he could not reach out his hand and agonized instead in his loneliness for what seemed like hours."

"Így bolyongott a sikátorok közt, míg arra nem eszmélt, hogy hajnalodik már, és ő Velence túlsó oldalán van, az Új Parton, ahonnan a temető szigetét látni és távolabb a titokzatos szigeteket, köztük a San Francesco in Deserto szigetét, ami egykor a leprások tábora volt, és nagytávol Murano házait. Itt a szegény velenceiek laktak, akikhez csak messziről és kevésbé ért el az idegenforgalom haszna, a kórház itt volt, és a halottak gondolái innen indultak el. Most már ébredeztek egyesek, és munkájukba mentek; és a világ olyan mérhetetlenül sivár volt, mint mikor az ember nem aludt éjszaka. Talált egy gondolást, aki hazavitte.","So he wandered through the alleys until he realized it was dawn, and he was on the other side of Venice, on the New Coast, from where to see the island of the cemetery and further afield the mysterious islands, including the island of San Francesco in Deserto, which was once a camp of lepers was and far from Murano's houses. Here lived the poor Venetians, who had access to tourism only from afar and less, the hospital was here, and the gondolas of the dead set off from here. Now some had awakened and went to their work; and the world was as immeasurably bleak as when man could not sleep at night. He found an idea who took him home.","He was still wandering among the alleys when it occurred to him that day was already breaking and he was on the far side of Venice, on the Fondamenta Nuova, within sight of the burial island and, beyond that, the mysterious islands which include San Francesco Deserto, the former leper colony, and, in the far distance, the houses of Murano. This was where the poor of Venice lived, too remote and obscure to profit from the tourist traffic. Here was the hospital, and from here the gondolas of the dead began their journey. Already people were up and on their way to work, and the world had assumed that utter bleakness as after a night without sleep. He found a gondolier, who took him home.","This is how he rambled on among the alleys, oblivious to the first light of day. He stood on the other side of Venice, on the Fundamenta Nuova from which he could see the island of cemeteries and, farther off, the island of secrets, among them San Francesco in Deserto Island, once a leper colony. And beyond that the houses of Murano. Poor Venetians seldom touched by the profit of the tourist trade lived there, the hospital was there, gondolas carrying the dead departed from there. A few were already awakening or starting out for work. The world seemed like an empty, cheerless place for a man who hadn’t slept through the night. He found a gondolier to take him home."
"Aznap este várakozásteljes idegességében és elációjában magányosan leitta magát, és mikor éjszaka felébredt nagy szívdobogásra, megint érezte azt a veszendőség-érzést, amely fiatal korában Éva iránti szerelmének legfőbb kísérője volt. Tudta jól, most sokkal világosabban, mint előttevaló nap, hogy haza kellene mennie, ezer és egy okból; és amikor Éva miatt - és milyen bizonytalan, hogy látja-e valaha Évát - mégis Rómában marad, nagyon sokat kockáztat, talán helyrehozhatatlanul vét családja és polgár-mivolta ellen, és nagyon bizonytalan napok elébe megy. De egy percig sem jutott eszébe, hogy másképp is cselekedhetnék. Ez is hozzátartozott a játékhoz, ez a kockázat és ez a veszendőség-érzés. Nem holnap és nem holnapután, de egyszer majd találkoznak, és addig is él, újra él, nem úgy, mint az elmúlt éveken át. Incipit vita nova.","That night, in his expectant nervousness and elation, he swallowed himself alone, and when he awoke to a big heartbeat at night, he felt again the sense of loss that was the main companion of his love for Eve at a young age. He knew well, now much more clearly than the day before, that he should go home, for a thousand and one reasons; and when he remains in Rome because of Eve — and how uncertain he will ever see Eve — he risks a great deal, perhaps irreparably, against his family and citizenship, and goes before very uncertain days. But it never occurred to me for a minute that I could do otherwise. It was also part of the game, it was the risk and that was the sense of loss. Not tomorrow and not the day after tomorrow, but they will meet one day, and in the meantime they will live again, not as they have in recent years. Incipit vita nova.","That evening, in his elation, his nervous excitement after the feverish waiting, he got drunk on his own, and when he woke later in the night with a violently palpitating heart he again knew the terrible feeling of mortality which in his younger days had been the strongest symptom of his passion for Éva. He well knew, now even more clearly than he had the day before, that for a thousand and one reasons he really had to go home; and that if despite that knowledge he remained in Rome because of Éva—and how uncertain it was that he actually had seen her—he was putting everything at risk, perhaps doing irreparable offence against his family and his own status as a bourgeois, and that very uncertain days lay ahead. But not for one minute did it occur to him that there was anything else he could do. All this, the great gamble and the death-haunted feeling, was so much part of those adolescent games. Not tomorrow, and not the day after, but one day he and Éva would meet, and, until then, he would live. His life would begin anew, not as it had been during all the wasted years. Incipit vita nova.","That evening, his frayed nerves struggled with his new elation, and he drank more than he could handle, and when he awoke in the middle of the night to frightful heart palpitations, he knew his death anxiety was back and with a vengeance, that very same terror from his youth, the one that haunted his love for Éva. He understood more clearly now than the day before, that for a thousand and one reasons, he should go home. But now Éva meant everything to him. Though he might never see her again, he’d remain in Rome forever, if need be, and risk everything, perhaps irrevocably sin against his family and his class, and face some very uncertain tomorrows. It didn’t occur to him for a single moment that he should do otherwise. All of this was part of the game, the risk, the danger, the terror. Perhaps not tomorrow or the day after, but they would meet again, and till then, unlike his last few years, he’d feel alive, live again. His new life was about to begin. Incipit vita nova."

"A tárgyalás után következett a nap legnehezebb része, az este. Pataki olvasta egyszer, hogy a házasember és a legényember közt az a leglényegesebb különbség, hogy a házasember mindig tudja, kivel fog vacsorázni aznap este. Csakugyan, amióta Erzsi otthagyta, ez volt Pataki életének legfőbb problémája. Kivel vacsorázzék? A férfiakat sosem szerette, a barátság intézményét nem ismerte. A nők? Ez volt a legfurcsább. Amíg Erzsi férje volt, rengeteg nő kellett neki, folyton újak, minden nő tetszett neki, az egyik azért, mert olyan sovány, a másik azért, mert olyan kövér, a harmadik azért, mert éppen a helyes középút. Minden szabad idejét és sokszor a nemszabad idejét is nőkkel töltötte. Ott volt a színházzal valami kifürkészhetetlen módon összefüggő maîtresse de titre, aki rengeteg pénzbe került, de egyúttal propaganda volt a bank számára, azután időnként úri szerelmek, egy-egy kollégájának a felesége, de legfőképp a gépírónők és néha egy-egy cseléd is a változatosság kedvéért; szörnyű galéria. Erzsi joggal bánkódott, és Pataki, optimistább perceiben, úgy tudta, hogy Erzsi ezért hagyta ott. Pesszimistább perceiben tisztán látta, hogy Erzsi másért hagyta ott, hiányokért, amelyeket nem tudott betölteni, és ez a tudat irtózatosan megalázó volt. Mikor Erzsi elment, gavalléros végkielégítéssel elbocsátotta a maîtresse de titre-t, illetve mindjárt át is adta egy idősebb kollégájának, aki már rég pályázott erre a megtiszteltetésre, a titkárnőit „átszervezte”, a bank egyik legcsúnyább munkaerejét ültette maga mellé, és önmegtartóztató életet élt.","The trial was followed by the hardest part of the day, the evening. Pataki once read that the most important difference between a married man and a groom is that the married man always knows who he is going to have dinner with that night. Indeed, since Erzsi left, this has been the main problem of Pataki's life. Who to have dinner with? He never loved men, he did not know the institution of friendship. The women? That was the strangest. While Erzsi was her husband, she needed a lot of women, she was constantly new, she liked every woman, one because she was so skinny, the other because she was so fat, and the third because she was just the right middle ground. She spent all her free time and often her free time with women. There was a maîtresse de titre that was inextricably linked to the theater, which cost a lot of money, but it was also propaganda for the bank, then sometimes the love of gentlemen, a wife of a colleague, but most of all a typist and sometimes a maid. for the sake of; terrible gallery. Erzsi was right, and Pataki, in his more optimistic minutes, knew Erzsi had left him there. In his more pessimistic minutes, he could clearly see that Erzsi had left him there for something else, for shortcomings he could not fill, and that consciousness was horribly humiliating. When Erzsi left, he dismissed the maîtresse de titre with severance pay, and immediately handed it over to an older colleague, who had long applied for the honor, ""reorganized"" his secretaries, planted one of the bank's poorest laborers, and saved himself. .","After the meeting came the most difficult part of the day, the evening. Pataki had once read that the most important difference between a married man and a bachelor was that the married man always knew who he would dine with that evening. And indeed, since Erzsi had left him, this had been the greatest problem in Pataki’s life: who would he dine with? He had never got on with men, had never known the institution of male friendship. Women? This was the oddest thing. While he was married to Erzsi he had needed endless women, one after the other. Every one seemed to please him, one because she was so thin, another because so plump, a third because she was so exactly in between. All his free time, and much that was not free, was filled with women. There had been a maîtresse de titre obscurely connected with the theatre, who had cost him a great deal of money (though she had brought with her a degree of publicity for the bank), then various gentlemanly diversions, the wives of one or two colleagues, but chiefly the typists, with the occasional maid-servant for the sake of variety: an inglorious collection. Erzsi had a real grievance in law, and Pataki in his more optimistic moments reckoned that this was why she had left him. In his more pessimistic mode he had to acknowledge that there was another reason, certain needs which he had been unable to meet, and that consciousness was particularly humiliating. When Erzsi left he had discharged the maîtresse de titre with a handsome redundancy payment, that is to say, made her directly over to an older colleague who had long aspired to the honour, he had ‘reorganised’ his secretarial staff, surrounded himself with one of the ugliest workforces in the bank, and lived a life of self-denial.","The conference was followed by the most difficult part of the day, evening. Pataki read somewhere that the only difference between a married man and a bachelor was that the married man could always count on someone to dine with. Since Erzsi left him, this turned out to be Pataki’s greatest trial. Who was he going to have dinner with? He didn’t like men, and understood little of the institution of friendship. And women? This was most curious. As long as he was Erzsi’s husband, he needed a lot of women, new women. Every kind of woman appealed to him, one because she was thin, another because she was well-nourished, the third because she was the golden in-between. He spent all his free time, and time that wasn’t so free, with women. There was the maîtresse en titre with her mysterious connection with the theatre, expensive, but perhaps a good investment for the bank, then a series of fashionable affairs, wives of colleagues, but mostly secretaries, and, once in a great while, a servant girl or two, for the sake of variety. A frightful gallery. Erzsi was justifiably outraged, and Pataki, in his better, more optimistic moments, let himself believe that that was why Erzsi left him. In darker moments he saw clearly that Erzsi left him because of something else. Because of deficiencies he could never reverse. This thought was utterly humiliating. When Erzsi left him, he dispatched the maîtresse en titre with courtesy bordering on chivalry, which meant he bestowed her on a senior colleague, who’d been waiting in the wings for some time now. He reorganized his secretarial staff, appointing the company’s most hideous employee as his personal secretary. And he led a life of celibacy."
"De Erzsi persze nem gondolhatta meg, mert Erzsi szerelmes volt Mihályba, és vele szemben nem volt bölcs, nem ismerte fel Mihály hibáit, úgy látszik, mindmáig nem ismerte fel. De ez csak az érzékek játéka; Erzsi egészen nyers, gátlástalan étvággyal kívánja a szerelmi boldogságot, amit Pataki oldalán nem talált meg, de hátha egyszer jóllakik, mert az ilyen érzéki szenvedély nem szokott túlságosan sokáig tartani...","But of course Erzsi couldn't think of it, because Erzsi was in love with Michael, and he wasn't wise, he didn't recognize Michael's mistakes, he still doesn't recognize him. But this is only a game of the senses; Erzsi wishes her love happiness with a rather raw, unscrupulous appetite, which she did not find on Pataki's side, but maybe she will be satisfied once, because such a sensual passion doesn't last too long ...","But of course Erzsi couldn’t have thought it through, because she was in love with Mihály, and, when it came to him, was not wise, had not recognised his shortcomings, and still, it seems, did not recognise them. It was just a game of feelings. Erzsi with raw, uninhibited appetite was seeking the happiness in love she had never found with Pataki. But perhaps once she had had her fill, because such passionate feeling does not usually last very long …","Mihály was wholly unaware that Erzsi was following her heart, not her head and never gave it a second thought. She was in love with him. When it came to him, she was not wise and ignored Mihály’s faults even now. She was blinded by her passion. Erzsi craved the joys of love with a raw and uninhibited appetite that even Pataki couldn’t satisfy. But once she’s satisfied, what then? Because passion of this intensity can never last too long."
"Így történt, hogy másnap, mikor kikísérte Millicentet a vasúthoz, mielőtt a jegyet megváltották volna, azt mondta:","It so happened that the next day, when he escorted Millicent to the train before the ticket was redeemed, he said:","It so happened that the next day, when he had escorted her to the station, and they were about to buy the ticket, he said:","What happened was that the following day, after he’d accompanied Millicent to the station and before she’d purchased her ticket, he came out with: “Why go back to Perugia?"
"- Nekem nem olyan nagyon rossz, mint ahogy te gondolod - mondta Erzsi, és mosolya most őszintén gőgös és elégedett volt. - Az életem most is nagyon teljes, és ki tudja, még milyen nagyszerű dolgok várnak rám. Párizsban kissé megtaláltam magam és azt, amit kerestem a világban. Csak azt sajnálom, hogy te kimaradsz az életemből.","""It's not as bad for me as you think,"" Erzsi said, her smile now sincerely haughty and pleased. ""My life is still very full, and who knows what great things await me."" In Paris, I found myself a bit and what I was looking for in the world. I'm just sorry you're missing out on my life.","“It’s not as bad for me as you think,” said Erzsi, and her smile was now genuinely proud and satisfied. “My life is very full now, and who knows what wonderful things lie in store for me? In Paris I’ve found myself to some extent, and what I want in life. My only regret is that you’re not part of it.”","“I don’t have it as bad as you think,” Erzsi said, her smile exuding self-satisfaction. “My life’s fairly complete now, and who knows what surprises are in store for me. I found myself and what I was looking for in Paris. I’m only sorry that you won’t be a part of it.”"

Mihály arca azonnal megváltozott. A harag és a megdöbbenés az örvendező kíváncsiságnak adott helyet.,Michael's face changed immediately. Anger and shock gave way to joyful curiosity.,Mihály’s face changed instantly. Rage and shock gave way to delighted curiosity.,Mihály’s expression suddenly changed. Anger and shock gave way to eager curiosity.
"- Óriási. Ez igen. Ez Mihály stílusa. Nem változott semmit az öreg fiú. Világéletében mindig mindent abbahagyott. Nincs semmihez se türelme. Például ő volt a legjobb centerhalf nemcsak a gimnáziumban, hanem merem állítani, hogy az ország összes középiskolájában. És akkor egy szép nap...","- It's huge. That's right. This is Michael's style. The old boy didn't change anything. He has always stopped everything in his world. He has no patience for anything. For example, he was the best centerhalf not only in high school but also dared to claim to be in all high schools in the country. And then a nice day ...","“Great. That’s really great. That’s Mihály’s style. The old boy hasn’t changed one little bit. All his life he’s always given up. No stamina for anything. For example, he was the best centre-half, not just in the school but, I dare say, of any school in the whole country. And then one fine day … ”","“Damn sensational! Really something. That’s Mihály’s style, alright. He hasn’t changed a bit, the old boy. In his whole life he never followed through with anything. Zero patience. In high school he was the best centre-half soccer player, not only locally but, I dare say, across the country. And then one nice day — ”"
"- Mi az, hogy a legjobb? Kitűnő. Gazdag ember, jó ember, imád téged, nem is értem, hogy hagyhattad ott. Most mindjárt írj neki, és pakolj és utazz. Erzsim... Milyen jó neked. És hogy fogsz nekem hiányozni.","- What's the best? Excellent. Rich man, good man, he loves you, I don't even understand how you could leave him there. Now write to him right now and pack up and travel. Erzsim ... How good you are. And how I'm going to miss you.","“What’s this ‘better’? He’s wonderful. A rich man, a good man, he worships you, I can’t understand how you ever left him. Now, this minute, write to him, pack up your things, and go. My Erzsi … How nice for you. And how I shall miss you.”","“What do you mean your best bet? He’s great. Wealthy, kind, and he adores you. I really don’t know why you left him. Write to him at once, pack and be off with you. Erzsi, my dear, you don’t know how lucky you are. And how I will miss you.”"
"Másnap reggel fájt a feje, és szeme iszonyúan égett az álmatlanságtól.",The next morning his head ached and his eyes burned terribly from insomnia.,The next morning his head ached and his eyes were horribly red from sleeplessness.,"The morning after, his head throbbed and his red-rimmed eyes burned from sleeplessness."
"Tovább mentek, bizonytalanul. Se ember, se jármű az egész környéken.","They went on, uncertainly. No people, no vehicles in the whole area.","They drove further on, in some uncertainty. No-one, not a vehicle, in the whole countryside.","They kept driving blindly. Not a soul, no cars, no lights, nothing anywhere."
"Erzsi is ott vett szobát, ahol Sári lakott, abban a modern, íz- és szagtalan hotelban a Jardin des Plantes mögött, ahonnan látni lehetett a nagy libanoni cédrust, amint idegen, keleti méltósággal nyújtotta párnás, tenyeres ágait az izgága párizsi tavaszba. Erzsinek nem tett jót a cédrus. Idegenségéről mindig egy másik, neki idegen és nagyszerű élet jutott eszébe, amelynek eljövetelét hiába várta.","Erzsi also took a room where Sari lived, in the modern, tasteless and odorless hotel behind the Jardin des Plantes, from where she could see the great Lebanese cedar as she stretched her cushioned, palmy branches with strange oriental dignity into the excited Paris spring. Cedar did no good to Ersi. His strangeness always reminded him of another life that was foreign and great to him, and he was waiting in vain for it to come.","Erzsi took a room in the same hotel as Sári: a modern hotel, free from smells and aromas, behind the Jardin des Plantes. From it you could see the great cedar of Lebanon, with foreign, oriental dignity stretching out its many-handed branches to the unruly Parisian spring. The cedar was not very good for Erzsi. Its foreignness always made her think of some exotic and wonderful life whose advent she longed for in vain.","Erzsi rented a room where Sári lived, in that modern, tasteless-odourless hotel behind the Jardin des Plantes with a view of an immense cedar of Lebanon whose sprawling branches reach out their evergreen arms to lend an eastern dignity to the restless Parisian spring. But such an association was not good for Erzsi. The tree’s exotic character suggested to her another kind of life, strange and wonderful, one for which she would have to wait forever."
"Akkor ritkább vendég is lettem; igyekeztem olyankor jönni, amikor Ervin és János nincs ott. Különben is érettségi előtt álltunk; komolyan neki kellett látnom, és azonkívül Tamásba is igyekeztem beleverni az elkerülhetetlen tudnivalókat. Valahogy meg is úsztuk az érettségit. Tamást sikerült erőszakkal odahurcolnom, pedig egyáltalán nem is akart aznap felkelni. És azután újra kezdődött a nagy élet az Ulpius-házban.","I also became a rarer guest then; I tried to come when Ervin and John were not there. We were about to graduate anyway; I had to see him seriously, and I also tried to infuse the inevitable with Tamás. Somehow we swam to graduation. I managed to drag Tamás up by force, even though he didn't want to get up that day at all. And then the great life in the house of Ulpius began again.","“I began to visit less often. I arranged to call when Ervin and János weren’t there. Besides, we were approaching our school-leaving exams. I had to take them seriously. What’s more, I made a huge effort to drill the essential information into Tamás. Somehow we got by, Tamás on the strength of my cramming him—mostly he didn’t even want to get out of bed. And after that there began a whole new phase of life at the Ulpius house.","“I visited less and less. And preferably when Ervin and János weren’t there. I was also facing my final examinations and needed to apply myself. Helping Tamás cram was an extra burden. Somehow we made it through the graduation. I ended up having to drag Tamás out of bed to get there. After that, we carried on in the grand style of the Ulpius house."
Mihály meghatva csókolt kezet. Késő délután már Folignóban voltak.,Michael touched and kissed her hand. They were already in Foligno late in the afternoon.,He kissed her hand with emotion. They reached Foligno late that afternoon.,Mihály was touched and kissed her hand. By late afternoon they were in Foligno.
"- Írd meg, kérlek, azt is Patakinak - mondta Szepetneki -, hogy átvetted tőlem a küldött pénzt, de nem kell összegszerűleg megjelölnöd, ne legyen mégse olyan, mint egy nyugta vagy egy üzleti levél, hiszen érted, az nem lenne elegáns.","""Please write to Pataki, too,"" Szepetneki said, ""that you have received the money sent from me, but you do not have to indicate the amount, let it not be like a receipt or a business letter, because you understand it would not be elegant.""","“Would you please write to Pataki as follows,” said Szepetneki: “you have received, from me, the money he sent. But you must not specify the exact sum. After all, it shouldn’t really be like a receipt or a business letter. That would be rather indelicate, as I’m sure you’ll understand.”","“In your letter, be sure to tell Pataki,” Szepetneki added, “that you received the money. But there’s no need for you to refer to the actual amount. We wouldn’t want it to appear like a receipt or a mere business transaction."
"Közben végéhez közeledett az Évának adott haladék. Az öreg Ulpius néha bedobbant a szobába, és rettenetes jeleneteket csinált. Ekkoriban már sosem volt józan. A vőlegény is megjelent, ősz hajjal és bocsánatkérő mosollyal. Éva még egy hetet kért. Hogy egy hétre nyugodtan elutazhassék Tamással, és elbúcsúzhassanak egymástól. Valahonnan pénze is volt az utazásra.","Meanwhile, the procrastination given to Eve was coming to an end. Old Ulpius sometimes burst into the room and made terrible scenes. He was never sober then. The groom also appeared, with gray hair and an apologetic smile. Eva asked for another week. So that they can leave with Thomas for a week and say goodbye to each other. He also had money to travel from somewhere.","“Meanwhile the delay Éva had been granted was coming to its end. Old Ulpius would occasionally burst into her room and make terrible scenes. In those days he was never sober. The fiancé himself appeared, with his greying hair and apologetic smile. Éva asked for one more week. So that she could go away with Tamás, in a calm atmosphere, so they could take their leave of one another. Somehow money was found for the journey.",“In the meantime the postponement of Éva’s wedding was up. Old man Ulpius would storm into her room in a rage. He was rarely sober. The grey-haired fiancée appeared with a pleading smile. Éva wanted more time. A week to spend with Tamás and say goodbye. She even had travel money from somewhere.
"Keze önkéntelenül tárcája után tapogatódzott. A tárca ott volt a helyén, a szíve fölött, ahol a közép-európai ember, nem minden szimbolikus jelentőség híján, a pénzét tartja. Megdöbbenve megállt, és kivette tárcáját. A kétszáz líra és a kis aprópénz, néhány tízlírás, hiánytalanul benne volt.","His hand involuntarily groped after his wallet. The portfolio was in place, above his heart, where the Central European man, not lacking any symbolic significance, kept his money. He stopped in shock and took out his wallet. The two hundred lira and the little change, a few tens of writing, were in it.","His hand unconsciously groped for his wallet. The wallet was there in its place, next to his heart, where the Middle-European, not entirely without a touch of symbolism, keeps his money. He stopped in surprise, and took the wallet out. The two hundred lire and the small change, a few ten-lire coins, were unmistakably there.","His hand instinctively went to his inside pocket. The wallet was in its place, by his heart, where Central Europeans, significantly enough, kept their money. He stopped to examine his wallet. Untouched. The two hundred liras and some change, a few ten-lira coins were still in it."
"- Elsősorban figyelmeztetni akarlak. Zoltán azt hiszi, hogy a további kelepcékbe is éppoly gyanútlanul be fogsz sétálni, mint ebbe. Például nagyszerű állást akar neked kínálni, hogy hazagyere Pestre. Hogy ott légy a helyszínen, mikor kitör a botrány. Pedig neked most semmi áron sem szabad hazamenned. És azután óvni akartalak egy... barátodtól. Tudod, hogy kitől.","- First of all, I want to warn you. Zoltán thinks that you will walk into the other traps as unsuspectingly as you do. For example, he wants to offer you a great job to come home to Pest. To be there on the scene when the scandal erupts. And now you are not allowed to go home at any cost. And then I wanted to protect you from a ... friend of yours. You know who.","“In the first place, I want to warn you. Zoltán believes that you’ll walk as unsuspecting into his other traps as you have into this. For example, he wants to offer you a wonderful job, so that you’ll go back to Pest. So that you’ll be right on the spot when the scandal breaks. But you mustn’t go back, at any price. And then I want to warn you about a … friend of yours. You know who.”","“First of all, I wanted to warn you. Zoltán thinks you’ll walk into his trap, gullible as ever. For starters, he’s going to offer you a promising job to lure you back to Budapest. So you could be on hand for the scandal-mongering. Under no circumstances should you go home now. Plus, I needed to spare you from a friend. I think you can guess — ”"

"Az egyik kapu felirata így hangzott: Cor magis tibi Sena pandit, jobban kinyitja szívedet Siena... Itt még a kapuk is bölcset és igazat beszélnek, jobban kinyitja szívedet Siena, hogy megteljék az élet egyszerű és könnyű mámorával és vággyal, amint illik az évszak fátyolozott szépségéhez.","The inscription on one of the gates sounded like this: Cor magis tibi Sena pandit, better opens your heart Siena ... Here even the gates speak wisdom and truth, better opens your heart Siena to fill life with simple and easy intoxication and desire as the season fits to his veiled beauty.","Over one gate was an inscription which read: Cor magis tibi Sena pandit— Siena opens its heart to you. “Here,” Mihály thought, “the gates still utter wisdom and truth: ‘Siena opens its heart’ so that life can be filled with the simple delirium of yearning, in harmony with the veiled beauty of the season.”",Mihály read the inscription on one of the gates: Cor magis tibi Sena pandit (Siena will open your heart). No truer words have been said than what is written here: Siena will open every heart to life’s simple joys and fill every longing as naturally as unveiling the beauty of the seasons.
"- Ez ki, ez a csúnya nő és ez a kisfiú? - kérdezte Mihály ügyesen.","""Who is this, this ugly woman and this little boy?"" Mihály asked skillfully.","“Who are these? This hideous woman with her brat?” Mihály asked, tactfully.",“Who’s the ugly one with the boy?” Mihály asked nimbly.
"Erzsi gyönyörködve hallgatta. Toszkána történelmisége ugyan pillanatnyilag egyáltalán nem érdekelte, de nagyon szerette Mihályt, amint így áttüzesedett; szerette, hogy éppen ilyenkor, történelmi révedezéseiben, tehát amikor a legtávolabb járt az emberek itteni és mostani világától, ilyenkor felengedett közönye, és ő is olyan volt, mint egy ember. A rokonszenv Erzsiben csakhamar erősebb érzésekbe ment át, és örömmel gondolt az este várható folytatására, annál is inkább, mert előző este Mihály rosszkedvű volt, és mihelyt lefeküdt, elaludt vagy legalábbis úgy tett.","Erzsi listened admiringly. Although he was not at all interested in the history of Tuscany at the moment, he loved Michael very much as he was so fiery; he loved that at this very time, in his historical delusions, so when he was furthest from the world here and now, his indifference was released at this time, and he too was like a man. The sympathy in Erzsi soon turned into stronger feelings, and he gladly thought about the expected continuation of the evening, all the more so because the night before, Mihály was in a bad mood, and as soon as he went to bed, fell asleep, or at least did so.","Erzsi listened with delight. The actual history of Tuscany did not for one minute interest her, but she adored him when he came alive like this. She loved the way that at these moments, in his historical day-dreams, precisely when he reached the furthest point from actual living people and the present world, his remoteness left him and he became a normal person. Her sympathy soon merged with more powerful feelings, and she thought with pleasure of the expected sequel later that night, all the more because the night before he had been in a bad mood, and fell asleep, or pretended to, the moment he lay down.","Erzsi delighted in listening to him. She was not really interested in Tuscany’s history, but she did like to see Mihály fired up as he raved about history. When he was farthest from the present, far removed from the mundane world, he could really let himself go. At times like this he was almost like a man. Erzsi’s admiration gave way to intense arousal, and she thought happily about what the night would bring, especially since Mihály had been grouchy the night before and fell promptly asleep, or pretended to."
"A jövőjüket nem tudták másképp elképzelni, mint a színházzal összefüggésben, amennyiben egyáltalán gondoltak jövőjükre. Tamás drámaírónak készült, Éva pedig nagy színésznőnek. De a készülés szó nem egészen helyes, mert Tamás sosem írt drámát, és Évának álmában sem jutott eszébe, hogy színiiskolába kellene járnia. Annál nagyobb szenvedéllyel jártak színházba. Csak a Nemzetibe; a könnyű színpadtól Tamás éppúgy undorodott, mint a modern építészettől; leginkább a klasszikus drámákat szerette, amelyekben bőven van gyilkosság és öngyilkosság.","They could not have imagined their future other than in the context of theater, if they thought about their future at all. Tamás was a playwright and Éva a great actress. But the word preparation isn't quite right, because Thomas never wrote a drama, and Eve never dreamed that she should go to a school. They went to the theater with greater passion. Only to the National; from the light stage, Thomas was as disgusted as he was from modern architecture; he loved the classic dramas, in which there is plenty of murder and suicide.","“They could imagine no future for themselves, if they ever did think about one, outside the theatre. Tamás was preparing to be a playwright, Éva a great actress. But to call it ‘preparation’ is a bit inaccurate, because he never wrote any plays, and it never occurred to Éva in her dreamworld that she would have to go to drama school. But they were all the more passionate in their theatre-going. But only to the National: Tamás despised the popular stage in exactly the same way he despised modern architecture. He preferred the classical repertoire, with its wealth of murder and suicide.","“They could not imagine a future without theatre, if they thought about the future at all. Tamás was preparing to be a playwright, Éva a great actress. The word ‘preparing’ is not quite exact. Tamás never wrote a single play, and Éva, in her wildest dreams, never considered going to acting school. But about going to the theatre they were fanatical. And only at the National Theatre. Tamás had the same aversion for the popular stage as for modern architecture. He preferred classical tragedy with plenty of mayhem and suicide."

- Miért szerettél áldozat lenni? - kérdezte Erzsi.,- Why did you like to be a victim? Erzsi asked.,“Why did you enjoy being the victim?” asked Erzsi.,“What was it that you liked so much about being the victim?” Erzsi asked.
"Hogy miért kellettem ehhez én?... és hogy miért tettem meg... látod, ezt csak te tudod talán megérteni, te, aki együtt játszottál velünk annak idején.","Why did I need to do this? ... and why did I do it ... you see, maybe only you who played with us at the time can understand that.","“Why did I have to do it? … and why did I do it? … you see, this is something perhaps only you can understand, Mihály. You played and acted with us, in those years.","“Why did he need me there? And why did I do it? Maybe only you can understand, you, who played those games with us back then."

"- Ervin zsidó fiú volt, akkoriban katolizált, talán a paptanárok hatása alatt, de inkább belső útját követve, azt hiszem. Előzőleg, tizenhat éves korában, ő volt a legintelligensebb az intelligens és beképzelt fiúk közt, a zsidó fiúk korábban érnek. Tamás nagyon utálta is őt intelligenciájáért, és egyenesen antiszemita lett, ha Ervinről volt szó.","“Ervin was a Jewish boy, Catholic at the time, perhaps under the influence of priestly teachers, but rather following his inner path, I think. Previously, at the age of sixteen, he was the most intelligent of the intelligent and arrogant boys, the Jewish boys maturing earlier. Thomas also hated him very much for his intelligence and became downright anti-Semitic when it came to Ervin.","“Ervin was a Jewish boy who’d converted to Catholicism, perhaps under the influence of the priests who taught us, but more probably I think following his own inner promptings. Earlier, at sixteen, he’d been the brightest of all the clever and conceited boys: Jewish boys tend to mature early. Tamás really hated him for his cleverness, and became thoroughly anti-Semitic whenever he was mentioned.","“Ervin was a Jewish boy who converted to Catholicism, perhaps under the influence of his teachers, the priests, but more likely because he followed his inner voice. Earlier, at sixteen, he was the most gifted in his snooty circle of geniuses. Jewish boys happen to be more precocious. Tamás hated him for it and became glaringly anti-Semitic when it came to Ervin."
"Waldheim vitalitásának emléke váratlanul üdítően hatott rá. Abból a hirtelen rátörő vágyból, ami elfogta, hogy legalább rövid időre Waldheimmal találkozzék, egyszerre ráeszmélt, milyen mérhetetlen magányban élt most már hetek óta. A magány ugyan elkerülhetetlenül hozzátartozott végzet-várásához, ami Rómában egyetlen foglalkozása volt, és amit senkivel sem lehetett megosztania. De most vette csak észre, mily mélyre kezdett süllyedni ebben a türelmes és álmatag várakozásban és veszendőség-tudatban, ami hínárosan lehúzta különös, mélyvízi csodalények felé; hirtelen kiütötte fejét a vízből, és lélegzetet vett.","The memory of Waldheim's vitality was unexpectedly refreshing. Out of the sudden onslaught that had taken him to meet Waldheim for at least a short time, he realized at once how immeasurable loneliness he had lived for weeks now. Although loneliness inevitably belonged to his expectation of doom, which was his only occupation in Rome and which he could not share with anyone. But now he only noticed how deep he began to sink into this patient and sleepy anticipation and consciousness of loss, which dragged him down to strange, deep-water wonders; he suddenly knocked his head out of the water and took a breath.","Thoughts of Waldheim’s vitality had an unexpectedly invigorating effect on Mihály. Ambushed by a sudden urge to see him again, even if briefly, he suddenly realised how utterly lonely his life had been in recent weeks. Loneliness was an inescapable part of awaiting one’s fate, which was his sole occupation in Rome and impossible to share with anyone. It was now brought home to him for the first time how deep he had sunk into this passive, dreamy waiting, this immersion in the sense of mortality. It was like a tangle of seaweed sucking him down towards the wonders of the deep: then suddenly his head had burst out of the water, and he breathed again.","The recollection of Waldheim’s vitality refreshed him unexpectedly. His sudden desire to see him again, if only for a brief meeting, made him realize just how isolated he’d been for weeks now. Solitude came with the territory for someone awaiting his destiny, his chief preoccupation in Rome, something which he wasn’t quite ready to share with the world. Only now did he realize how close to the bottom he’d been sinking, mired in his waking dream while he waited for his final destiny, and how this longing had been pulling him down in a tangle of seaweed toward the bottom of the abyss among the deep’s luminous creatures. All at once he broke to the surface and he caught his breath."
"- Most menj aludni. Mindjárt éjfél, nekem a templomba kell mennem. Menj aludni, majd elvezetlek a szállásodra. És matutinum alatt majd gondolkozom rajtad.

Go to sleep and I'll take you to your accommodation. And under matutinum, I'll think of you. Maybe it's becoming clear ... it's happened another time. Maybe I can tell you something tomorrow morning. Now go to sleep. Come.","“Right now, go and sleep. It’s almost midnight. I have to go to chapel. Go and sleep. I’ll take you to the room. And during my matutine I’ll think about you.

It’s almost midnight, and I have to go to the chapel. Go and sleep. I’ll take you to your bed. And during matins, my morning prayers, I’ll turn all this over in my head.

"A többi mozaik már nem is érdekelte. Visszament a hotelba, megvárta, amíg Erzsi elkészül, azután együtt és szakszerűen megnéztek és megbeszéltek minden látnivalót. Mihály persze nem mondta meg, hogy reggel már volt a San Vitaléban, kissé szégyenkezve osont be a templomba, mintha valami elárulhatná, és azt mondta, nem is olyan érdekes, hogy reggeli megrendülését kompenzálja.","He was no longer interested in the other mosaics. He went back to the hotel, waited until Erzsi was done, then together and professionally they looked at and discussed all the sights. Michael, of course, did not say that he was already in the San Vitale in the morning, he crept into the church with some embarrassment, as if something could betray him, and said it was not so interesting as to compensate for his morning shake.","The other mosaics held no further interest for him. He went back to the hotel, waited for Erzsi to make herself ready, then together they systematically visited and discussed all there was to see. Mihály did not of course mention that he had already been to San Vitale. He slipped rather ashamedly into the cathedral, as if something might betray his secret, and pronounced the place of little interest, to atone for the morning’s painful disclosure.","He had no real interest in other mosaics and went back to the hotel, and waited for Erzsi to get ready so they could tour the city with practiced efficiency, see what there was to see and discuss what they saw. Of course he didn’t confess his secret visit to San Vitale. He entered the church sheepishly as if the smallest slip up might give him away, and to mask his morning’s drama, he told her the place wasn’t really all that interesting."
"Az életkedv ebben az időben nem volt erős oldalam. A veszendőség-érzés egyre erősebb lett bennem, és akkoriban már a katolicizmus sem vigasztalt, sőt csak növelte bennem gyengeségem tudatát. Nem voltam szerepjátszó természet, és akkor már tisztán láttam, hogy életem és lényem mennyire gyógyíthatatlanul távol áll a katolikus életideáltól.","The zest for life at this time was not my strong point. The feeling of loss became stronger and stronger in me, and at that time Catholicism did not comfort me, it even increased my awareness of my weakness. I was not a role-playing nature, and by then I could clearly see how incurably far away my life and being were from the Catholic ideal of life.","“Joie de vivre wasn’t my strong point during that time. The feeling of mortality, of transience, grew stronger in me, and by then my Catholicism was no longer a consolation. In fact it increased my sense of weakness. I wasn’t a role-player by nature, and by that stage I could clearly see that my life and being fell hopelessly short of the Catholic ideal.","“During that gloomy period I couldn’t enjoy anything in life. If anything, it was a vague death-wish that took on a life of its own. Even my Catholic faith ceased to be a source of comfort. It actually made things worse. I was not in the mood to play any more games, and the sobering truth was that my life and my very being were irretrievably astray of the Catholic ideal."
"Erzsi elkomolyodott. Mindenesetre várta ezt a kérdést, erotikus hiúsága is megkívánta ezek után... De hogy a valóságban szó lehet-e róla?... Sokáig habozva és vizsgálódva nézte Mihályt.","Erzsi was serious. In any case, he waited for this question, and his erotic vanity demanded it after that ... But how could it be in reality? ... He looked at Mihály for a long time, hesitating and examining.","Erzsi grew serious. She had of course expected this question, if only because her sexual vanity required it … but could it be a realistic proposition? … For a long time she gazed at Mihály, hesitant and questioning.","Erzsi became solemn. After everything else, she needed to be flattered by the question to soothe her pride. But was anything like that really possible? She hesitated as she studied Mihály."
"- Mondd, szerelmes voltál Ulpius Évába?","""Tell me, were you in love with Eva Ulpius?""","“Tell me, were you in love with Éva Ulpius?”","After a moment Erzsi asked, “Were you in love with Éva Ulpius?”"
"Mihály értette. Fejében mindjárt kalkulációt csinált, hogy vajon Szepetneki mennyit vágott zsebre a neki küldött pénzből. Talán ötven százalékot, semmi esetre sem többet. Nem baj, hadd keressen.","Michael understood. He immediately made a calculation in his head to see how much Szepetneki had pocketed the money sent to him. Maybe fifty percent, by no means more. No problem, let me search.","Mihály understood. In his head he instantly calculated how much Szepetneki had pocketed of the money sent to him. Perhaps fifty percent, certainly not more. Never mind, let him have it.","You know what I mean. It would look vulgar.” Mihály understood. He made a quick calculation in his head to determine just how much Szepetneki skimmed off the deal. Fifty percent maybe, not a jot more. No problem, let him run with it."
"Tamás észrevette, hogy beletörődtem, és közölte velem, hogy melyik nap fog megtörténni. Aznap még csónakáztunk a halott tavon, de délután már esett az eső, és bementünk a szobánkba. Soha annyira ősz nem volt ezen a világon, Mihály.","Thomas noticed that I had put up with it and told me which day was going to happen. We were still boating on the dead lake that day, but it was raining in the afternoon and we went into our room. There has never been so much autumn in this world, Michael.","“Tamás realised I had become resigned to the idea and he told me the day when it would happen. That day we went boating on the dead lake, but in the afternoon the rain came down and we went into our room. There was never such an autumn since the world began, Mihály.","“Tamás noticed I reconciled myself to it, and he let me know the day it was to happen. On that day we were still rowing on the dead lake, but by afternoon it started to pour, and we went into our shared room. Never in my life had I seen such an autumn day. Never."
"Amint felfelé haladt a kis utcákon, lassanként annyira ránehezedett az az érzés, hogy valaki jön utána, hogy nem kanyarodott el balra, a hegyre felvezető útra, hanem tovább csavargott a Trastevere sikátorain, azon gondolkozva, hogy megfelelő helyen be fogja majd várni azt, aki nyomában jön. Egy kis kocsma előtt megállt.","As he walked up the small streets, he slowly felt so hard that someone was coming after him, not turning left on the road leading up the mountain, but still wandering the alleys of Trastevere, thinking that he would be waiting in the right place for someone who is following in his footsteps. He stopped in front of a small pub.","As he made his way up the narrow streets the feeling gradually became so insistent again that he decided not to turn left, up towards the hill, but to continue on through the Trastevere alleyways with the idea of waiting for the pursuer in some suitable place. He stopped outside a little tavern.","As he headed up the narrowing streets, the feeling he was being followed so overwhelmed him that, instead of turning left and up the hill, he continued on the twists and turns of the Trastevere alleys, thinking he’d stop at an opportune place and confront his pursuer. He stopped in front of a little taverna."
"Mintha minden elő lett volna készítve. Erzsi ekkor már nem is kételkedett abban, hogy minden elő volt készítve. Bizonyára János tervelte ki ezt a kis színjátékot, amit most megjátszottak a tiszteletére. Az autódefekt, a kis kastély az útban, János balesete, és most jön majd az utolsó felvonás, happy enddel.","It was as if everything was prepared. At that time, Erzsi no longer doubted that everything was prepared. Surely John had designed this little play that was now being played in his honor. The car defect, the little castle on the way, is John’s accident, and now comes the last act, with a happy ending.","It was as if everything had been prepared in advance. Of this Erzsi no longer had any doubt. The little play being enacted in her honour was no doubt the brainchild of János: the problem with the car, the little château by the roadside, his accident, and now the final scene with the happy ending.","Everything had been prepared in advance and so well-orchestrated to the last detail that Erzsi no longer doubted herself. In fact, the little scenario performed for her benefit bore János’s unique signature as regisseur. The car breaking down, the little château off the road, János’s sprain, and now the highly anticipated final scene with its happy ending."
"És különösen az nem tetszett, hogy ellopta az aranyórámat. Ez egy nagy mulatság alkalmával történt, valahol kint, egy akkor divatos nyári vendéglőben, a nevére már nem is emlékszem. Sokan voltunk, Éva társasága, két-három külföldi tiszt, inflációs-gazdag fiatalemberek, furcsa nők, az akkori évek rendkívül merész ruháiba és viselkedésébe öltözve. Veszendőség-érzésemet már az is kiváltotta, hogy Tamás meg én ennyire nem nekünk való társaságba keveredtünk, emberek közé, akikkel semmi más közösségünk nem volt, mint éppen ez az érzés, hogy most már úgyis minden mindegy. Mert akkor a veszendőséget már nemcsak én éreztem, hanem az egész város is, a levegőben volt. Az embereknek rengeteg pénzük volt, és tudták, hogy hiába, egyik napról a másikra el fog veszni, a katasztrófa úgy lógott a kerthelyiség fölött, mint egy csillár.","And I especially didn’t like the fact that he stole my gold watch. It happened on a big party, somewhere out there, in a then fashionable summer restaurant, I don’t even remember her name anymore. There were many of us, Eve’s company, two or three foreign officers, inflation-rich young men, strange women, dressed in the extremely bold clothes and demeanors of the time. My feeling of danger was already triggered by the fact that Tamás and I were not so much involved in our company, among people with whom we had no other community, than the very feeling that now it doesn't matter anyway. Because then not only did I feel the loss, but the whole city was in the air. People had a lot of money, and they knew that in vain, he would lose it overnight, the disaster hung over the garden room like a chandelier.","“And what I particularly didn’t like was his stealing my gold watch. It happened on the occasion of a grand ‘do’ out of doors somewhere, in a then fashionable summer inn, I no longer remember the name. There were several of us present—Éva’s friends, two or three foreign officers, some young inflation-millionaires, some strange women, remarkably daring for those times in their dress and general behaviour. My usual sense of impermanence was made worse by the fact that Tamás and I were mixing with people not our own, people we had nothing in common with, and by the same old feeling that nothing mattered. But then I wasn’t the only one with this sense of impermanence. The whole city had it, it was in the air. People had a lot of money and they knew that it made no difference: it might vanish from one day to the next. The sense of impending disaster hung over the garden like a chandelier.","“And I despised him for stealing my gold watch. It happened during a summer party, in some then-fashionable garden restaurant whose name I’ve forgotten. There were several of us, Éva’s friends, two or three foreign officers, nouveau riche young men who made a bundle from speculating on business fluctuations, eccentric young women whose daring dress and behaviour were a hallmark of the times. My sense of doom was triggered when Tamás and I mingled with people we had nothing in common with except perhaps the familiar feeling that nothing mattered anymore. I was not the only one feeling this way. It seemed to permeate the city, the very air. People quickly made enormous amounts of money and knew they could just as quickly lose it from one day to the next. The sense of looming catastrophe hung above the garden restaurant like the sword of Damocles."
- Milyen többiek?,- What kind of others?,“What others?”,“What others?”
"Valamelyik este egy nagyobbfajta hegyi városba érkezett. Ekkor már olyan irreális lélekállapotban volt, hogy a város neve után nem is érdeklődött, annál kevésbé, mert már aznap délben észrevette, hogy egyetlenegy olasz szó sem jut eszébe. Így nekünk sem kell a városka nevét feljegyeznünk. A város piazzáján barátságosabb képű albergo állt, ide betért, és igen jó, normális étvággyal megvacsorázott, gnocchit paradicsomos szósszal, környékbeli kecskesajtot, narancsot és fehér bort. De mikor fizetésre került a sor, úgy találta, hogy a fogadós leánya gyanakodva nézi, és összesúg a két emberrel, aki rajta kívül még a teremben ült. Azonnal elrohant, és nyugtalanul kószált a városka fölött elterülő bozótos, „macchiás” hegyen, de itt fent nem maradhatott, mert erős szél fújt, hát leereszkedett egy meredek hegyoldalon.","One evening he arrived in a larger mountain town. By this time he was in such an unreal state of mind that he was not even interested in the name of the city, much less because he had noticed at noon that day that he could not think of a single Italian word. So we don’t even have to record the name of the town. A more friendly-looking albergo stood in the town’s piazza, and he came in and had a very good gnocchi with tomato sauce, goat cheese, oranges, and white wine. But when it was his turn to pay, he found the innkeeper's daughter watching with suspicion and whispering to the two men who were still sitting in the hall outside of him. He immediately ran away and wandered restlessly on the bushy, “macchia” hill above the town, but he couldn’t stay up here because a strong wind was blowing, so he descended a steep hillside.","One evening he arrived in one of the larger hill towns. By then he was in such a surreal state of mind that he never enquired after the name, being all the more reluctant to do so since he had realised, around midday, that he could not remember a single word of Italian —so we need not record the name of the town. In the main square stood a friendly-looking albergo, where he called in, and dined with a perfectly good, normal appetite on gnocchi in tomato sauce, the local goat’s cheese, oranges and white wine. But when the time came to pay he noticed the waitress looking at him suspiciously and whispering with two other people sitting in the room. He instantly rushed out, then roamed restlessly up and down on the scrubby macchia-covered hill above the town until, forced to leave by a howling wind, he let himself down a steep hillside.","One night he arrived at a sizable hilltop town. By then his emotional state had become so irrational that he didn’t bother to inquire about the town’s name, and by noon the next day he realized he couldn’t recall a single word of Italian. The town was destined to remain nameless. He wandered into a friendly albergo by the piazza and dined with a healthy appetite on gnocchi with tomato sauce, local goat cheese, oranges and white wine. But when it came time to pay the bill, he thought the innkeeper’s daughter eyed him suspiciously, whispering with two men, the only patrons other than himself still in the room. He bolted. His agitated rambling took him up a hill of dense evergreen shrubs that stretched above the town; eventually howling gusts ambushed him and forced him to scramble down the steep hillside."
"De az embernek könnyű megnyugtatnia lelkiismeretét, ha nagyon akar valamit. Hisz csak nagyon rövid lejáratú kölcsönről van szó, kis összegről, nem is fog ötszáz dollárt elfogadni, száz dollár is elég lesz, mondjuk kétszáz, mondjunk talán mégis háromszázat... Most mindjárt ír haza, és a pénzt rövidesen vissza fogja fizetni.","But it is easy for a person to reassure his conscience if he really wants something. It's just a very short-term loan, a small amount, you won't even accept five hundred dollars, a hundred dollars will be enough, say two hundred, let's say three hundred ... You're writing home right now, and you're going to pay it back soon.","But the conscience is easily placated when we really want something. Of course it was just a matter of a very short-term loan, a small sum. He wouldn’t take five hundred dollars: one hundred would be enough. Or, let’s say, two. Perhaps after all we should say three hundred … He would write home straightaway, and pay the money back very shortly.","By the same token it was not very difficult to allay the prick of his conscience if he wanted something bad enough. Maybe he’d accept a short-term loan and only a trifle amount, certainly not five hundred dollars. One hundred, perhaps, or two. Three hundred, tops! He must write home right away. He’d pay it all back in no time."
"- Hogyhogy? Hát még mindig nem érted az egészet? Téged beugrattak, Szepetneki János és az a gyalázatos Zoltán. Csak azt akarta, hogy írásba add a jellemtelenséged.

"Egy keskeny sikátoron át lement a párhuzamos utcába, amely nem volt fiatalabb, csak valamivel kevésbé komoran előkelő; mintha itt mégis laknának élő lények. És, úgy látszik, halottak is. Mert az egyik ház előtt különös, megdöbbentő embercsoport tűnt szemébe. Ha nem tudta volna rögtön, hogy miről van szó, bizonyára azt hitte volna, hogy látomása van. A ház előtt csuklyával elfödött arcú emberek álltak, gyertyával kezükben. Temetés volt, és itt még régi olasz szertartás szerint csuklyás hozzátartozók, a contraternitas tagjai viszik ki a halottakat.","He went down a narrow alley to the parallel street, which was no younger, only slightly less grimly upscale; as if living beings still lived here. And they seem dead, too. Because in front of one of the houses, a strange, startling group of people appeared in his eyes. If he hadn't known right away what he was talking about, he would have thought he had a vision. In front of the house stood a hooded man with a candle in his hand. It was a funeral, and here, according to an old Italian ceremony, hooded relatives, members of the contraternitas, take the dead out.","He went down a narrow back-alley to the street running parallel behind. This was no less ancient, only a little more gloomily patrician, but it did seem that living beings might reside there. And also, it seemed, dead ones. For outside one particular house a group of people met his astonished eye. Had he not immediately realised what was happening he would have thought it was a vision. People were standing outside the house holding candles, their faces covered with hoods. A funeral was taking place, and here, still following the ancient Italian ritual, members of the family, a hooded fraternity, were taking out the dead.","He crossed an alley and went down a parallel street, not much newer but less gloomy in its elegance. At least the living were out in the street. But so were the dead, it would seem. Because what met his eyes was a curious knot of people standing in front of a house. Had he not guessed what went on, he would’ve been convinced he was hallucinating. Hooded men holding candles. It had to be a funeral. Ancient Italian customs still prevailed here, and only these hooded family members were permitted to be pallbearers of the dead."

"- De mennyire, hogy nem arra születtem. És épp ezért... Kérlek, most már értem, hogy mi volt a tegnapi ijedelem alapja. Arra gondoltam, hogy hová fog ez vezetni. A perzsa után jöhet egy venezuelai, azután egy japán és esetleg egy néger... Arra gondoltam, hogy ha az ember egyszer elkezdi ezt, akkor nincs megállás, mert mi az ördög állítsa meg? És azt mégsem. Az mégsem lehet, hogy én egy olyan legyek, nem igaz? Ettől ijedtem meg, önmagamtól, attól, hogy mi mindenre lennék én képes, hogy még mi minden történhetnék velem. De nem, ezt azért mégsem. Valami kell, ami visszatartson egy nőt. És akkor már a legjobb Zoltán.","- But how much I wasn't born. And that's why ... Please, I understand now what was the basis of yesterday's scare. I was wondering where this was going to lead. The Persian may be followed by a Venezuelan, then a Japanese and possibly a Negro ... I thought that once you start doing this, there is no stopping it, because what the hell does it stop? And not yet. It can't be one, can it? I was frightened by that, by myself, by what I would be able to do, what else could happen to me. But no, that's not it. You need something to hold back a woman. And then Zoltán is the best.","“And I certainly wasn’t born for that! And just because … Excuse me, but I’ve just realised what was the basis of my fear yesterday. I started thinking where all this would lead. After the Persian there would be a Venezuelan, then a Japanese, and perhaps a Negro … I reckoned that once a girl starts off down that road there’s no going back: what the devil is there to stop you? And that’s not all. It could be that I really am like that, yes? That’s what I was frightened of—myself, and everything I might be capable of, and everything that could still happen to me. But no, it’s not that either. There has to be something to hold a woman back. And in that case, better Zoltán.”","“You can bet your bottom dollar I wasn’t born for that. That’s it exactly. Now I know why I was afraid yesterday. I thought about where all this was going to lead. After the Persian will come a Venezuelan, then a Japanese, perhaps even an African. Once a person starts rolling down that hill there’s no way to stop. Why in the devil should one stop? No, you can’t. You shouldn’t start anything you can’t stop, right? That’s what frightened me the most. I’m frightened of myself, of all the things that could happen if I do the things I can do. I need to be told, ‘No, you can’t.’ There should always be something or somebody to put a stop to such a person. And Zoltán is my best bet.”"
"- Erzsi, én a szívem mélyén oly ártatlan vagyok a kettőnk dolgában - mondta. - Igaz, hogy ezt könnyű mondani. De látod, annyi éven át mindent megtettem, hogy konformizálódjam, és mikor azt hittem, hogy most már minden rendben van, már békét kötöttem a világgal, akkor feleségül vettelek, hogy megjutalmazzam magam. És akkor törtek rám az összes démonok, az egész ifjúságom és minden nosztalgia és minden lázadás. Nosztalgia ellen nincs orvosság. Talán nem lett volna szabad Olaszországba jönnöm. Ezt az országot királyok és költők nosztalgiájából építették. Olaszország a földi paradicsom, de csak úgy, ahogy Dante látta; a földi paradicsom a Purgatórium hegyének ormán csak átmeneti állomás, csak túlvilági repülőtér, ahonnan a lelkek elindulnak a távoli égi körök felé, amikor Beatrice leveti fátyolát, és a lélek „a régi vágynak érzi nagy hatalmát...”","""Erzsi, I'm so innocent of the two of us,"" he said. - It's true that it's easy to say. But you see, I’ve done everything I can for so many years to conform, and when I thought everything was fine now, I had already made peace with the world, I married you to reward myself. And then all the demons, all my youth and all nostalgia and all rebellion broke upon me. There is no cure for nostalgia. Maybe I shouldn't have come to Italy. This country was built out of the nostalgia of kings and poets. Italy is a paradise on earth, but only as Dante saw it; the paradise on earth on the ridge of Mount Purgatory is only a temporary station, only an afterlife airport from which souls set off to distant celestial circles as Beatrice takes off her veil and the soul ""feels the great power of the old desire ...""","“Erzsi, in the depths of my heart I wasn’t to blame for what happened between us,” he said. “True, that is easily said. But you see, for so many years I had done everything to make myself conform, and I only married you, as a kind of reward, when I really thought that at last everything was all right, that I had at last made my peace with the world. And then all the demons turned on me—my entire youth and all that nostalgia and rebellion. There’s no cure for nostalgia. Perhaps I should never have come to Italy. This country was created out of nostalgia, by kings and poets. Italy is the earthly paradise, but only as Dante saw it: the earthly paradise on the peak of Mount Purgatory, a mere stopping place on a journey, a supernatural aerodrome where spirits take off for the distant circles of heaven, when Beatrice lifts her veil, and the soul ‘feels the great power of the old yearning … ’”","“Erzsi, in my heart of hearts, I’m innocent,” he said. “I know it’s easy to say. But, you see, all these years I did just about everything to conform, and when I thought that everything was all right, that I made peace with the world, I married you. To reward myself. And that’s when all my demons returned. All my youth, the rebellion, the nostalgia. There’s no cure for nostalgia. Perhaps I should not have come to Italy. This country was pieced together by the longing sighs of kings and poets. Italy might be earthly paradise, but only as Dante saw it. Only the tip of Purgatory, a way station, a rarefied airport in the void. From there the soul launches its journey toward the heavenly spheres, and as Beatrice removes her veil, the soul surrenders to the power of its ancient longing.”"
"- Pedig nekem mérhetetlenül fog hiányozni, ha most elmegy. Talán soha többé nem látjuk egymást ebben az életben.","""And I'll miss you immensely if you leave now.""

But I don’t want to write to him because he doesn’t need to know that I’m running away from him, he doesn’t need to know that he’s the only solution. Believe me, I'm sorry. Otherwise, he would still trust himself.","“No, my dear, truly I’m not afraid of that. But I don’t want to write to him, because he must never know that I’m going to him as a refugee. He mustn’t know that he’s the only answer. Let him think I felt sorry for him. Otherwise, he’d be so full of himself!”","“No, darling, that’s one thing I’m not afraid of. I don’t want to write to him because he doesn’t need to know I’m escaping to him, that he’s my last resort. Let him think I feel sorry for him. Otherwise he may get cocky.”"
"- Az elején látni lehet majd - felelte Szepetneki - egy egyszerű, jólelkű, konzervatív perzsa ópiumtermelőt békés családja körében. Leányát, a hősnőt, csak akkor tudja rangjának megfelelően férjhez adni a fiatalemberhez, akit az szeret, ha sikerül elhelyeznie évi ópiumtermését. Erre az intrikus, aki szintén szerelmes a leányba, de gaz és mindenre kész kommunista, feljelenti az apát az ellenőrző hatóságnál, és éjszaka, rajtaütésszerűen lefoglalják az egész ópiumkészletét. Ez nagyon izgalmas lesz, autókkal és szirénákkal. De később a leány ártatlansága és lelki nemessége megrendíti a zordon ezredest, és visszaadja a lefoglalt ópiumot, ami csilingelő szekereken vígan utazik Kína felé. Ez volna nagyobbára a meséje...","""In the beginning,"" Szepetneki replied, ""you will see a simple, benevolent, conservative Persian opium producer among his peaceful family."" He can only marry his daughter, the heroine, to the young man he loves according to his rank if he manages to place his annual opium crop. For this, the intrigue, who is also in love with the girl but is a greedy and ready-made communist, reports the abbot to the control authority and seizes his entire opium stock overnight. It will be very exciting, with cars and sirens. But later, the girl’s innocence and spiritual nobility shake the grim colonel and return the seized opium, which travels happily to China on chirping carts. That would have been more of a tale ...","“The opening shots,” replied Szepetneki, “take you into a family living peacefully on a simple, kind-hearted, traditional opium farm in Persia. For reasons of social rank they can only marry their daughter (the heroine) to the young man she loves if they can find a buyer for the year’s harvest. Whereupon the bad guy, who is also in love with the girl, but is a wicked communist prepared to do anything, betrays the father to the authorities and, in a night ambush, seizes the entire stock. This bit will be very exciting, with car chases and sirens blowing. But later the girl’s innocence and nobility of soul so impresses the hard-nosed general that he returns the seized opium, which sets off merrily for China, in tinkling wagons. That would be the outline of the story … ”","“The film,” Szepetneki explained, “would open with a simple, kind-hearted, conservative Persian opium producer surrounded by his peaceful family. Now, for the daughter, the heroine, to marry the man she loves in a way that is appropriate to their caste, the father has to reach his annual opium quota. Enter an intriguer, also in love with the girl, but who’s a rat and a communist provocateur. He reports the father to the authorities, and that very night they raid the family business and seize all the opium. This is going to be very exciting with cars, sirens and everything. Later, the girl’s innocence and soulful nobility move the stern general, and he gives back the seized opium, which in the final scene we see in wagons rolling and jingling merrily toward China. That’s the plot more or less.”"
"A vasárnap délután Auteuilben szép és unalmas volt, filmszerű jelenségek ezúttal nem voltak, az egésznek mondain és előkelő jellege volt, a francia magas burzsoázia volt képviselve, de Erzsit nem érdekelte ez a világ, amely még konformisabb és még tigristelenebb, mint a pesti. Csak akkor lélegzett fel, amikor Auteuilből hazafelé jövet Szepetneki János vacsorázni vitte, azután pedig táncolni mentek. János sátáni volt, itatta, hencegett, szavalt, sírt, és időnként nagyon férfias volt - de minderre tulajdonképpen alig volt szükség. János most is túljátszotta szerepét, mert ha egy szót sem szólt volna, Erzsi valószínűleg akkor is nála tölti az éjszakát, a dolgok belső logikáját követve, és keresve a sárga tigriseket.","Sunday afternoon in Auteuil was beautiful and boring, there were no cinematic phenomena this time around, the whole thing was legendary and upscale in nature, the French high bourgeoisie was represented, but Eliza was not interested in a world that was even more conformist and tiger-like than Pest. He only breathed when John Szepetneki took him home from Auteuil for dinner, and then they went dancing. John was satanic, drank, boasted, recited, wept, and at times was very masculine — but all that was hardly needed. John was still overplaying his role, because if he hadn't said a word, Erzsi would probably spend the night with him, following the inner logic of things and looking for the yellow tigers.","The Sunday afternoon at Auteuil was elegant and dull. The actress-types were not there this time, and the company entirely mondain and well-heeled, typical of the French grande bourgeoisie. But this world did not interest Erzsi, being even more conformist and devoid of tigers than its Budapest equivalent. She began to breathe freely only when, on the way home, they called to take János Szepetneki out to dinner, and then went on to dance. János was demonic. He drank, showed off, recited poetry, wept and was at times extremely manly. But all this was really quite superfluous. He was thoroughly overdoing his part because, not to put too fine a point on it, Erzsi was without doubt already disposed to spend the night with him, following the inner logic of events, and in quest of the burning tiger.","Sunday afternoon in Auteuil turned out to be nice and boring, nothing that could be exploited for its cinematic potential. The character of the whole was fashionable and mundane and French high society which didn’t really interest Erzsi. This world was even more pretentious and tigerless than the one in Budapest. The only time she could really breathe again was when János Szepetneki took her out to dinner on their way home from Auteuil, after which they went dancing. János behaved satanically, wined her, boasted, recited poetry, cried, acted time and time again with manifest virility, though all this was hardly necessary. János had overplayed his part. Because even if he’d said nothing, Erzsi, with her penchant for burning tigers, would’ve still slept with him."
"- Te, láttuk mi idejövet ezt a tavat? - kérdezte Jánostól.","""You, have we seen this lake here?"" he asked John.","“Tell me, did we see that lake when we came?” he asked János.",“Did we pass a lake on our way?” he asked János.
"De a levél megírását napról napra halogatta. Addig is ott maradt Folignóban, ahol az egyetlen ember él, akihez valami halvány köze volt, Ellesley doktor. Szobát bérelt, és csendesen élt, olvasta az angol regényeket, amiket a doktor kölcsönzött neki, és örült az ebédnek és a vacsorának. Az olasz ételek íze volt az egyetlen, ami a valósághoz fűzte ezekben a fásult napokban. Szerette az olasz konyha leplezetlen érzelmességét: a francia-európai konyha általában a letompított, finom és csak jelzett ízeket kedveli, fegyelmezett, mint a férfi-ruházkodás színei. Az olasz szereti a nagyon édeset, a nagyon savanyút, a nagyon karakterisztikus ízeket, és még a mérhetetlen tészta-masszáknak is szentimentális jelleget tud adni.","But he postponed writing the letter day by day. Until then, he remained in Foligno, where the only person with anything to do with anything, Dr. Ellesley, lives. He rented a room and lived quietly, reading the English novels the doctor had lent him, and rejoicing at lunch and dinner. The taste of Italian food was the only thing that brought reality to these wooded days. He loved the undisguised emotionality of Italian cuisine: French-European cuisine tends to like dampened, delicate, and only marked flavors, disciplined as the colors of men’s clothing. The Italian loves the very sweet, the very sour, the very characteristic flavors, and can even give a sentimental character to immeasurable pastas.","But he put off the business of writing the letter from one day to the next. He had so far remained in Foligno to be near Dr Ellesley, the only person with whom he had any connection, however slight. He took a room, where he lived quietly, read the English novels the doctor lent him, and enjoyed his lunches and dinners. Food was the only thing that tied him to reality in those blank days. He loved the undisguised sentimentality of Italian cooking. Conventional French-European cuisine approves only subtle, subdued, qualified flavours, like the colours of men’s suits. The Italian loves intense sweetness, extreme tartness, strongly distinctive aromas. Even the huge servings of pasta could be seen as an expression of this sentimentality.","But he kept postponing the actual writing of the letter from one day to the next. Meanwhile he’d stay in Foligno to be near the only man with whom he had at least some connection, Dr. Ellesley. He rented a room and lived quietly, read the English novels the doctor lent him, and looked forward to lunch and dinner. The taste of Italian food was the only thing binding him to reality during those rather bland days. He enjoyed the primal sensuousness of Italian cooking. French and other European cuisines are, on the whole, more inclined toward the subtle and the refined, mixing and harmonizing flavours like the colours of a gentleman’s wardrobe. Italians love the very sweet and the very sour, any distinct flavour with character, and are able to impart a sensuality to the most incredible heaps of pasta."

"Úgy érezte, haza nem utazhat. Családja előtt lehetetlenné vált szökése által, amit úgy sem tudna és nem is akarna megmagyarázni. Különben sem tudta elviselni azt a gondolatot, hogy Pestre menjen, bejárjon az irodájába, üzleti dolgokkal foglalkozzék, és pihenésképp bridzzsel és csevegéssel.","He felt he couldn't travel home. It became impossible for his family to escape, which he could not and would not want to explain. Anyway, he couldn't stand the thought of going to Pest, going to his office, doing business, and relaxing with a bridge and chatting.","He was in no mood to go home. It would have been impossible to appear among his family after his desertion, which he would be unable and unwilling to explain. And he could not bear the thought of returning to Pest, going in to the office, involving himself in the firm’s business, and relaxing over bridge and small talk.","He couldn’t go back home. After he abandoned his family the way he did, facing them had become impossible, and he could not and would not want to explain it. And he couldn’t bear the thought of going back to Budapest, to the confines of his office just so he could busy himself with business matters, and fill up his idle hours with bridge and small talk."

"Ott álltak Erzsi hotelja előtt. Mihály búcsúzásul még egyszer jól megnézte Erzsit. Igen, Erzsi sokat változott. Előnyére vagy hátrányára, ki tudja. Nem volt olyan finom jelenség, mint azelőtt, valami megtört volt benne, valami belső csapzottság, ami ruhájában is kifejezésre jutott és abban, hogy párizsi módon túlságosan festette magát. Erzsi valamivel közönségesebb lett, és egy idegen férfi jelenléte volt valahogy körülötte, egy titokzatos és irigylésre méltó idegené. Vagy talán Jánosé, az ellenfélé... Ez az új valami a rég ismert asszonyban kimondhatatlanul vonzó és nyugtalanító volt.","They were standing in front of Erzsi's hotel. Michael said goodbye to Erzsí once again as a farewell. Yes, Erzsi has changed a lot. Pros or cons, who knows. It wasn’t as subtle a phenomenon as it had been before, something was broken in it, something of an inner delusion that was also expressed in her dress and in the fact that she painted herself too much in a Parisian way. Erzsi became a little more ordinary, and the presence of a stranger was somehow around him, a mysterious and enviable stranger. Or maybe John's, the opponent's ... This new something in the long-known woman was unspeakably attractive and disturbing.","They were standing outside Erzsi’s hotel. Taking his leave of her, Mihály looked again at Erzsi. Yes, she had changed a great deal. For better or worse, who could say? She was no longer the fine presence she had been: there was something broken in her, some inner coarsening of texture that showed in the way she dressed and spoke, and overpainted her face in the Parisian fashion. Erzsi had become somehow more common, was somehow surrounded by the ambience of some stranger, some mysterious and enviable stranger. Or perhaps of János, his arch-rival … This element of newness in the woman he had so long known was inexpressibly seductive and disturbing.","They stood outside Erzsi’s hotel. Mihály took a long last look at Erzsi. Yes, she’d changed a great deal. For better or for worse, who would know? Her appearance was not as delicate as before. Perhaps something fragile had broken inside her, leaving a calloused surface in the wake of some inner upheaval, visible in her very manner, in the way she dressed, in her overdone Parisian make-up. She’d become a bit naughty, surrounded perhaps by another man’s aura, by his mysterious, enviable presence. Was it János? His enemy? It disturbed him how this new and unknown presence could make a woman he’d taken for granted so ineffably alluring."
"Így értek be a fogadószobába, egy bolthajtásos, óriási, üres terembe, amelynek egyik sarkában asztal és néhány rozoga faszék állott. Az asztalon egy kancsóban vörösbor és egy pohár.","That's how they got into the reception room, a huge, empty room with a vaulted corner, a table and some shabby wooden chairs in one corner. On the table is a jug of red wine and a glass.","And so they reached the reception room, a huge, arched, empty hall, in one corner of which stood a table and a few rickety wooden chairs. On the table was a pitcher of red wine and a glass.","They arrived in the sitting room, a vaulted hall, spacious and empty.

"A lámpaernyő meleg narancssárga reflexe Éva arcára hullt, és arca most még sokkal inkább ugyanaz az arc volt, amit Éva az Ulpius-házban hordott, olyankor... olyankor, amikor játszottak, és Tamás és Mihály meghaltak érte vagy általa. Micsoda fantázia vagy emlék játszhat most benne? Mihály fájó és dobogó szívére szorította kezét, és ezer dolog futott keresztül fején: a régi játékok beteg örömének emléke és az etruszk szobrok a Valle Giuliában, Waldheim magyarázatai, a Másik Vágy és a halálhetéra.","The warm orange reflex of the lampshade fell on Eva's face, and her face was now even more the same face that Eva wore in the house of Ulpius, at a time when they were playing and Thomas and Michael died for him or through him. What fantasy or memory can play in it now? Michael pressed his hand to his sore and pounding heart, and a thousand things ran through his head: the memory of the sick joy of the old toys and the Etruscan statues in the Valle Giulia, Waldheim's explanations, the Second Desire, and the Death Week.","The warm orange glow from the lampshade fell on Éva’s face and it became much more like the face she had shown in those years in the Ulpius house when … when they played their games and Tamás and Mihály died for her, or at her hands. What kind of fantasy, or memory, might now be stirring in her? He clutched his hand to his aching, pounding heart, and a thousand things flitted through his head: memories of the sick pleasure of the old games, the Etruscan statues in the Villa Giulia, Waldheims’s explanations, the Other Wish and the death-hetaira.","The amber glow from the lampshade fell on Éva’s face, and now the face seemed more like the face she had at the Ulpius house, when they played their games. When Tamás and Mihály died for her or because of her. What fantasy, what memory could be playing in her mind now? Mihály felt his heart pound behind his ribs, a thousand images fluttered through his mind, fragments of memory, bits from their old plays, the thrill of forbidden pleasures, the erotic Etruscan figures at the Valle Giulia, Waldheim’s lectures, that Other Longing for a second birth in the setting sun. Images of death sirens…"
"- Kérlek, egy kicsit hirtelen jött a dolog - mondta Mihály, felrázkódva merengéséből. - Ma reggel még mindenre gondoltam volna, csak arra nem, hogy hazamenjek Pestre.","""Please, it came a little suddenly,"" Michael said, shaking in contemplation. ""I would have thought of everything this morning, except to go home to Pest.""","“Please, this is all a bit sudden,” said Mihály, emerging from his day-dream. “This morning I was thinking of anything but going home to Pest.”",“Oh… ah… it’s awfully sudden.” The jolt was enough to snap Mihály out of his ruminating. “The last thing I thought of this morning was going back to Budapest.”

"De ezt olyan kínlódva mondta, hogy Mihályon sejtelem futott át. Vajon csakugyan? Milyen furcsa volna... De rögtön feltámadt nagyfokú diszkréciója, és elnyomta magában a kíváncsiságot; ha ez lehet, hogy így van, nem szabad többet Szepetneki Jánosról beszélni.","But he said this with such embarrassment that a conjecture ran through Michael. Is it really? How strange it would have been ... But he immediately had a high degree of discretion, and he suppressed curiosity; if this may be the case, we should not talk more about János Szepetneki.","But she said this with so much apparent deliberation that suspicion flashed through Mihály’s mind. Was it really? … How strange it would be … But his considerable discretion instantly rebelled and he suppressed his curiosity.

"Mihály szeme könnyel telt meg. Íme itt nyugszik Keats, a legnagyobb költő, amióta a világ világ... bármily oktalan is az ilyen meghatottság, mert hiszen teste már réges-rég nem nyugszik ott, és lelkét minden sírveremnél hívebben őrzik versei. De milyen nagyszerű, mennyire angolos, kedvesen kompromisszumos és ártatlanul képmutató az a mód, ahogy tiszteletben tartották utolsó óhaját, és azért mégis félreérthetetlenül hírül adják, hogy Keats az, aki itt nyugszik a kő alatt.","Michael's eyes filled with tears. Here is where Keats rests, the greatest poet ever in the world ... no matter how unreasonable such touch may be, for his body has long since rested there, and his soul is kept more faithful than any tomb. But how great, how English, kindly compromising, and innocently hypocritical is the way their last wish was respected, and yet it is unequivocally proclaimed that Keats is the one resting here under the stone.","Mihály’s eyes filled with tears. So here lay Keats, the greatest poet since the world began … though such emotion was somewhat irrational, given that the body had been lying there for a very long time, and the spirit was preserved by his verses more faithfully than by any grave-pit. But so wonderful, so truly English, was the manner of this gentle compromise, this innocent sophistry, that perfectly respected his last wishes but nonetheless announced without ambiguity that it was indeed Keats who lay beneath the stone.","Mihály’s eyes moistened. Yes, here rested Keats, perhaps the greatest of poets since the beginning of time. A misplaced sentiment, however moving. It’s not so much his body that is preserved but the body of his work, his spirit preserved more faithfully by his poems than by any vault. How marvellous, how English, to accede to the poet’s last wish with such innocent, dear sanctimony, and at the same time proclaim to the world so no one misunderstood that it was Keats, the world’s greatest poet, who lay under the stone."
"Foied vinom pipafo, cra carefo. Ma bort iszom, holnap nem lesz. A bor elfogyott, elfogyott a titokzatos nedv ott belül, ami reggelenként felébreszti az embert, és abba az illúzióba ringatja, hogy érdemes felkelnie. És abban a mértékben, amint a bor elfogyott, emelkedett alulról a sötét tenger, a tengerszem, amely mélységeiben az óceánnal függ össze, a Másik Vágy, az élettel ellenkező és az életnél hatalmasabb.","Foied vinom pipafo, cra carefo. I'm drinking wine today, it won't be tomorrow. The wine is gone, the mysterious juice inside is gone, which wakes you up in the morning and rocks you into the illusion that you should get up. And to the extent that the wine has run out, the dark sea, the ocean, which in its depths is connected to the ocean, has risen from below, the Other Desire, the opposite of life and more powerful than life.","FOIED VINOM PIPAFO, CRA CAREFO. Enjoy the wine today, tomorrow there’ll be none. The wine had run out: the mysterious inner spring that wakes a man day after day and sustains him with the illusion that life is worth getting up for, had run dry. And as the spring, like the wine, ran dry, it had been replaced from below by waters rising from the dark sea, the inner lake, connected through its depths to the great ocean, the Other Wish, antagonistic to life and more powerful than it.","Foied vinom pipafo, cra carefo. I drink today, for there is no tomorrow. The wine ran dry, as did the secret inner well of sustenance which made it possible for him to awaken mornings to the illusion that it was worthwhile to awaken. And as the wine ran dry, so did a dark hurricane surge underneath, in whose eye that Other Longing hovered over the ocean depths, larger than life, the nemesis of all life."
"Körülnézett szobájában. Az ajtót gondosan bezárta, azután elmosolyodott: a szobának még egy ajtaja volt, és annak nem volt kulcsa. Óvatosan kinyitotta ezt az ajtót, egy sötét szoba volt előtte. De a sötét szoba szemben levő falában ajtó volt, és alóla világos csík látszott ki. Csendesen odalopódzott; a szomszéd szobában valaki járkált. Visszaemlékezett a szobák elhelyezésére, amint végigjöttek a folyosón, és megállapította, hogy az ajtó mögött a perzsa szobája van. A perzsa bizonyára nem fogja bezárni ajtaját. Kényelmesen át fog sétálni az ő szobájába. És természetes is: az után, hogy oly intimen üldögéltek ott lent, a lámpa alatt. Visszament szobájába.","He looked around his room. He closed the door carefully, then smiled: the room had another door and no key. He opened this door carefully, there was a dark room in front of him. But there was a door in the opposite wall of the dark room, and a light stripe stood out from under it. He snuggled quietly; someone was walking in the next room. He recalled the location of the rooms as they walked down the hall and found that there was a Persian room behind the door. The Persian will certainly not close its door. He will walk comfortably through his room. And natural, too: after sitting so down there under the lamp so intimate. He went back to his room.","She looked round her room. She carefully locked the door, and then had to smile. There was another door in the room, and this had no key. She cautiously opened this second door. It revealed an unlit room. But in the far wall of the darkened room was another door, under which a strip of light appeared. She tip-toed over to it. Someone was walking about in the next room. She thought back to the arrangement of the rooms as they had gone along the corridor, and decided that the one behind the door was the Persian’s. He was certainly not going to lock his door. Through it he would make his way comfortably to her room. And this was quite natural, after the intimate way they had sat together down below, under the lamp. She returned to her room.","She surveyed her room. She took great pains to secure her door, then smiled wryly: of course, there was another door but that one had no key. Cautiously she opened it to a very dark room. On the opposite wall, a sliver of light ran along the bottom of a door. She crept there without making a sound. Someone was moving around in the adjoining room. The layout of the rooms she’d noted in the hall flashed through her mind and confirmed her suspicion that it was the Persian behind the door. Surely the Persian wasn’t going to lock his door. All he had to do was to casually waltz through the door over to her room. Nothing would be more natural, after the intimate way they had carried on. She went back to her room."

"Így is volt két foglalkozása, és ez a kettő teljesen elég volt neki. Az egyik az volt, hogy Waldheim utasításai alapján „beleolvasta magát” az etruszk dolgok tudományába, könyvtárakba és múzeumokba járt, és esténként hallgatta Waldheimnek és olykor Waldheim tudományos barátainak a beszélgetését. Az igazi, nagy waldheimi lelkesedést a tárgy iránt egy pillanatig sem érezte, de görcsösen ragaszkodott a módszeres tanuláshoz, mert ez kissé enyhítette a fojtogató polgári rosszallást, amit - hiába - tétlen élete miatt mégis érzett. Mihály ugyan sosem szeretett dolgozni, polgári esztendeiben mégis rengeteget dolgozott, mert nagyon szerette este azt a tudatot, hogy napközben dolgozott volt. És a tanulás ideig-óráig elterelte figyelmét másik és fontosabb foglalkozásától, ami az volt, hogy várta, hogy találkozzék Évával.","Even so, he had two occupations, and those two were quite enough for him. One was that, under Waldheim’s instructions, he “read himself” into the science of Etruscan affairs, visited libraries and museums, and in the evenings listened to conversations between Waldheim and sometimes Waldheim’s scholarly friends. He did not feel the real, great Waldheim enthusiasm for the subject for a moment, but he cramped his systematic learning because it alleviated the stifling civic disapproval he had felt — in vain — because of his idle life. Although Michael never liked to work, he still worked a lot during his civic years, because he loved the knowledge that he worked during the day. And learning diverted his attention from time to time from his other and more important occupation, which was waiting for him to meet Eve.","Anyway, he already had two occupations, and between them they were quite enough for him. The first was, on Waldheim’s instructions, to ‘read up’ on everything Etruscan, to frequent libraries and museums, and listen every evening to the conversation of Waldheim and his current academic friends. Mihály did not for a moment feel anything of Waldheim’s immense, genuine enthusiasm for the subject, but he clung desperately to the routine of study for the slight relief it gave from the suffocating middle-class guilt which he still felt, so pointlessly, about his life of idleness. Mihály had never really liked work, but in his bourgeois years had applied himself obsessively because he loved the feeling at night of having done a good day’s worth. Moreover, study momentarily diverted his attention away from his second and more important occupation: waiting for a meeting with Éva.","He already had two occupations which took up all his time. One was studying. On Waldheim’s advice, he’d immerse himself reading everything about Etruscan scholarship, visit museums, bibliotheca, and evenings he’d listen to Waldheim or to scholarly discussions Waldheim conducted with his scholarly friends. He’d never felt, not even for a moment, Waldheim’s enthusiasm for the subject. Nevertheless he’d latched on to structured methodical study in a last ditch effort to distract himself from the wreckage that was his life — something he’d feel more keenly when idle. Although Mihály had never been in love with work, he’d exerted himself plenty during his working years, and had been familiar with the nightly satisfaction that came from an honest day’s work. But his studies were short-lived interruptions from his other, full-time occupation — waiting to run into Éva."
"- Igen, de véletlenül. Az nem számít. Különben is nagyon jól tudod, hogy nem rólam van szó.","- Yes, but by accident. It does not matter.

"Ekkor a gótikus kapunyílásban megjelent a karinges pap.

He turned his pale, ivory face to the sky with a sad and unseen look, tilted his head aside, and folded his hands with some unspeakably kind gesture reminiscent of old things.","Then in the gothic doorway a priest appeared in flowing robes. His pale ivory face, with its sombre, all-unseeing eyes, glanced at the heavens. Then with bowed head he placed his hands together in an ancient gesture of inexpressible gentleness.","A priest in ceremonial vestments emerged from the gothic doorway. His pallid, almost ivory-coloured face turned a sad, vacant gaze toward the sky. The familiar and endearing way he bowed his head and clasped his hands in prayer brought back a slew of old memories."
"- Istenem, a halálvágy nem archaikus dolog, hanem örök emberi - védekezett Mihály saját gondolatai ellen. - Mindig voltak és mindig lesznek fáradtak és életuntak, akik a haláltól várják a megváltást.","""My God, the desire to die is not an archaic thing, but an eternal human one,"" Michael defended himself against his own thoughts. “They have always been, and always will be, tired and life-long waiting for salvation from death.","“My God, the death-wish isn’t some archaic thing, but eternally human,” said Mihály, fending off his real innermost thoughts. “There always were and always will be people worn out and weary of life, who long for the release of death.”","“My God, the death-wish is not something archaic but something that persists in the present.” Mihály offered in defence against his own foreboding. “There are always going to be fractured, life-weary souls who expect death to redeem them.” “There you go again."
"Már mikor a motoscafon az állomásról befelé hajóztak, és elhagyták a Canale Grandét a rövidebb út kedvéért, Mihálynak feltűntek jobbra és balra a sikátorok. De ekkor még nem sokat törődött velük, mert eleinte teljesen lefoglalta Velence velencesége: a víz a házak között, a gondolák, a lagúna és a város téglavörös-rózsaszín derűje. Mert Mihály most volt először Olaszországban, harminchat éves korában, a nászútján.","As soon as the sailboat sailed inwards from the station and left the Grand Canal for a shorter journey, Michael saw the alleys to the right and left. But at that time he did not care much for them, because at first he was completely occupied by the Venetian Venetian: the water between the houses, the gondolas, the lagoon and the brick red-pink serenity of the city. Because Michael was in Italy for the first time at the age of thirty-six on his honeymoon.","Mihály first noticed the back-alleys when the motor-ferry turned off the Grand Canal for a short cut and they began appearing to right and left. But at the time he paid them no attention, being caught up from the outset with the essential Veniceness of Venice: the water between the houses, the gondolas, the lagoon, and the pink-brick serenity of the city. For it was Mihály’s first visit to Italy, at the age of thirty-six, on his honeymoon.","It was when the vaporetto ferried back from the main station and abandoned the Canale Grande for a shorter route that Mihály first noticed the alleys on his right and on his left. At the time he was barely aware of them, being then enchanted with all that was Venetian in Venice: the water shimmering between houses, gondolas, the lagoon, the city’s brick-red and pink gaiety. This was Mihály’s first time in Italy, at the age of thirty-six, on his honeymoon."

"- Szélhámos - gondolta magában Erzsi, amint álmatlanul feküdt. - Hiszen éppen ez az. Erzsi egész életében mintakislány volt: dadáinak és fräuleinjeinek szerelme, apja büszkesége, az osztály legjobb tanulója, még tanulmányi versenyre is kiküldték. Egész élete védetten és rendezetten folyt, a jó polgári élet megszentelt statutumainak szigorú szem előtt tartásával. Amikor ideje eljött, férjhezment egy gazdag emberhez, elegánsan öltözött, és vitte az úri házat, reprezentált, és ideális háziasszony volt. Mindig ugyanazokat a kalapokat hordta, mint a többi asszony, aki vele egy társadalmi osztályba tartozott, odament nyaralni, ahová illett, az volt a véleménye a színdarabokról, és azokat a bemondásokat mondta, amiket illett; mindenben konformis volt, ahogy Mihály mondaná. De azután unatkozni kezdett, az unalom egészen a szívneurózisig fokozódott, és akkor kiválasztotta magának Mihályt, mert érezte, hogy Mihály nem egészen konformis, Mihályban van valami, ami a polgári élet kereteitől teljesen idegen. Azt hitte, Mihály révén majd ő is túljut a falakon, ki a vad bozóttal benőtt árterületre, ami ott kívül terül el, ismeretlen messzeségek felé. De Mihály éppen rajta keresztül akart konformizálódni, őt használta fel eszközül, hogy rendes polgárember lehessen, és az árterületekre csak egyedül és lopva járt ki, amíg meg nem unta a konformitást, és meg nem szökött, vissza a bozótba, egyedül. Vajon Szepetneki János, aki nem is akar konformizálódni, aki mintegy foglalkozásszerűen portyáz kívül a falakon, aki sokkal töretlenebb és egészségesebb, mint Mihály, vajon... Tigris, tigris, éjszakánk Erdejében sárga láng...","""A rogue,"" Erzsi thought to herself as she lay asleep. - That's exactly it. Erzsi had been a model girl all her life: the love of her nanny and fräulein, the pride of her father, the best student in the class, she was even sent to a study competition. His whole life was protected and orderly, with strict observance of the consecrated statutes of good civil life. When the time came, she married a rich man, dressed elegantly, and took the manor house, was represented, and was an ideal housewife. She always wore the same hats as the other women who belonged to a social class with her, went on vacation where she belonged, had an opinion about the plays, and said the announcements she was entitled to; it was conforming in everything, as Michael would say. But then he got bored, the boredom intensified all the way to cardiac neurosis, and then he chose Michael for himself, because he felt that Michael was not quite conformist, there was something in Michael that was completely foreign to the framework of civil life. He thought that through Michael, he too would cross the walls, out into the floodplain overgrown with wild bush, to unknown distances. But Michael was about to conform through it, he used it as a means to become an ordinary citizen, and he walked into the floodplains alone and stealthily until he was bored of conformity and escaped, back into the bush, alone. Is János Szepetneki, who does not even want to conform, who is raiding the walls outside the walls, who is much more unbroken and healthier than Mihály, whether ... Tiger, tiger, yellow flame in the forest of our night ...","“A crook,” Erzsi thought to herself, as she lay without sleeping. “That’s just what he is.” All her life she had been the model of a good girl, adored by her nannies and fräuleins, her father’s pride and joy, the best pupil in the form, sent abroad to academic competitions. Her whole life had been sheltered and ordered, the good bourgeois life consecrated to a sternly supervised moral order. In due course she married a wealthy man, dressed elegantly, took on a grand house and presided over it as a model housewife. She always wore the identical hat sported by every other woman of the same rank in society. She took her summer holidays where fashion dictated, held the same opinions about theatrical productions, uttered the turns of phrase currently de rigueur. In everything she was a conformist, as Mihály would say. Then she began to get bored. The boredom developed into a full neurosis, and then she chose Mihály for herself, because she felt that he was not entirely conformist, that in him there was something utterly alien to the conventions of bourgeois existence. She believed that through him she too could get beyond the walls, into the badlands, the wide flood-plain and what lay there in the unknown distances. But Mihály was simply trying, through her, to become a conformist himself, using her as a means to become a regular bourgeois, only stealing out into the badlands, into the bushes, furtively and alone, until conformity no longer bored him and he was used to it. Now if János Szepetneki, who had no wish to conform, who lived more or less as a professional bandit beyond the walls, who was so much more untamed and vigorous than Mihály … if he … “Tiger, Tiger, burning bright/ In the forests of the night … ”","A gangster! Erzsi was thinking as she lay sleepless in her bed. That’s exactly what he was. All her life she’d been a model little girl. The darling of her governess and nannies, the apple of her father’s eye, the best in the class, sent on scholarly competitions. But then she was also sheltered, living her life according to the sacrosanct precepts of middle class morality. When the time came she got married to a wealthy gentleman, dressed fashionably, and maintained a great household as the ideal wife with a certain panache. She selected her hats with the same discriminating taste as the other women in her social circle, frequented the same fashionable resorts, entertained the same opinions about the theatre, saying the same clever things. With just about everything, she’d been a conformist, as Mihály would point out. But then she got bored. Bored to the point of mind-numbing neurosis, and that’s when she sought out Mihály, sensing that he at least was a man, an individual who resisted the insufferable taboos inherent in social boundaries and their rock-solid walls. She believed that with Mihály she could scale those walls, beyond which were wild thickets and forbidden pastures that spread far toward an exotic horizon. But, as it turned out, Mihály was actually conforming through her, using her as a means to become respectable, and he’d only rarely break out and wander off to graze among those forbidden pastures, usually when he got fed up with following the herd and retreated back as far as the thickets. Now she wondered about János Szepetneki. The man had not the slightest interest in any conformity. He’d already camped outside the walls of social order by his profession as a gangster. Much more of a man than Mihály. He was certainly stronger and fiercer, possibly even more than a man, possibly a… tiger. A tiger burning bright in the forests of the night."

Mihály eladott Zoltánnak, még levélben is igazolta az alku megtörténtét, és most János elad a perzsának, és isten tudja, a perzsa idővel micsoda görögnek vagy örménynek ad majd el; és amellett folyton olyan férfiak adnak el, akiknek egyáltalán nem képezem tulajdonát. - Törte a fejét, hogy mi lehet az benne, amiért a férfiak eladják? Vagy talán nem is benne van a hiba, hanem a férfiakban, akikkel összekerült, Mihályban és Jánosban és abban, hogy mind a ketten Évát szeretik, aki eladó nő, és másképp nem tudják elképzelni?","- Why is everyone selling me? Michael sold it to Zoltán, even in a letter confirming the bargain, and now John sells it to the Persians, and God knows what kind of Greek or Armenian the Persian will sell in time; and besides, I keep selling to men I don’t own at all. ""He wondered what it might be like for men to sell."" Or maybe it's not the fault, but in the men he met, Michael and John, and the fact that they both love Eve, who is a woman for sale, and can't imagine otherwise?","“Why do they all try to sell me? Mihály sold me to Zoltán—even his letter made it clear that there had been a deal—and now János sells me to the Persian, and, God knows, in time the Persian will sell me to some Greek or Armenian; and after that I’ll be sold again and again by men who don’t even view me as their own property.” She racked her brains to discover what there might be in her that made men do this. Or perhaps the fault lay not in her, but in the men she fell in with, Mihály and János, and the fact that both of them had loved Éva, a woman who was for sale, and were therefore unable to see her as any different?","Why was it that everyone ended up selling her? Mihály had sold her to Zoltán, the deal sealed in a letter, and now János was selling her to the Persian, and God only knew what the Persian would, in time, do with her. Sell her to a Greek or an Armenian? How dare those men even think of selling her? She wasn’t their property. She racked her brains trying to find an answer as to why these men looked at her as a piece of merchandise to buy and sell. She didn’t feel she did anything to cause this, but perhaps it was the type of men she’d attracted, like Mihály and János, who both loved Éva, a woman who was used to being sold, and they just assumed all women were like that."
"Mihályt hirtelen türelmetlenség fogta el. Mindent el kell mondania Ervinnek, mindent, dolgokat, amelyeket Erzsinek sem mesélhetett el... Ervin mindenre fog írt tudni, hiszen őrá már egy másik világból hull ez a glória, ez a sugár...","Michael was suddenly caught up in impatience. You have to tell Ervin everything, everything, things you couldn't tell Erzsi either ... Ervin will know everything, because this halo, this ray, is already falling on him from another world ...","Mihály was filled with a sudden impatience. He must tell Ervin everything, everything, things he couldn’t tell Erzsi … Ervin would know a balm for everything, now that he was bathed in the glory and the radiance of another world …","A sudden impatience seized Mihály. He felt compelled to tell Ervin everything in one sudden gush, all the things he couldn’t tell Erzsi. Because Ervin would have all the answers. There was this unmistakable aura about him, something beatific, radiant."
- Nem zavarlak? - kérdezte Mihály nevetve.,- Aren't you bothering me? Mihály asked laughing.,“I hope I’m not disturbing you?” Mihály asked with a laugh.,“Am I intruding?” Mihály laughed.

"Mikor világosodni kezdett, nagyon rosszul lettem, és hogy utána kissé kijózanodtam, észrevettem, hogy az aranyórám eltűnt. Rettenetesen meg voltam döbbenve, kétségbeesésem eksztatikus volt. Meg kell értened: egy aranyóra elvesztése magában nem olyan nagy szerencsétlenség, még akkor sem, ha az ember húszéves, és más értéktárgya ezen a világon nincsen, mint az aranyórája. De mikor az ember húszéves, és hajnalban arra józanodik ki, hogy ellopták az aranyóráját, hajlandó arra, hogy a veszteségnek mélyen szimbolikus jelentőséget tulajdonítson. Az aranyórát apámtól kaptam, aki egyébként nem nagyon ajándékozó természetű ember. Mondom, egyetlen értéktárgyam volt, egyetlen szóba jöhető magántulajdonom, és szememben éppen vaskos és közönséges, nagyképű nyárspolgárisága által képviselte mindazt, amit annyira nem szerettem, de aminek az elvesztése, most hogy szimbolikus formában megjelent előttem, páni rémülettel töltött el. Az volt az érzésem, hogy most már végleg el vagyok jegyezve az alsó hatalmaknak, ellopták azt a lehetőséget, hogy valamikor mégis kijózanodjam, és visszatérjek a polgári világba.","As it began to lighten, I became very ill, and that I was a little sober afterwards, I noticed that my gold watch was gone. I was terribly shocked, my despair was ecstatic. You have to understand that losing a gold watch is not such a big misfortune in itself, even if you are twenty years old and have no other valuables in this world than your gold watch. But when one is in his twenties and sobers up at dawn that his gold watch has been stolen, he is willing to attach deep symbolic significance to the loss. I got the gold watch from my dad, who is not a very gifted person anyway. I say, I had only one valuable, my only private property, and in my eyes, through its chunky and ordinary, grandiose skewer, it represented all that I did not like so much, but the loss of which, now appearing before me in symbolic form, filled me with panic. I had the feeling that I was now finally committed to the lower powers, stealing the opportunity to someday still sober up and return to the bourgeois world.","“By the time it started to become light I felt really ill. Then, when I’d sobered up a bit, I realised my gold watch had disappeared. I was really shocked. My despair verged on hysteria. You have to understand: the mere loss of a gold watch is not in itself such a misfortune, not even when you are twenty and have nothing else of value in the world, nothing but your gold watch. But when you are twenty, and you sober up in the light of dawn to find your gold watch has actually been stolen, then you begin to see a symbolic importance in the loss. I had it from my father, who is not by nature a great giver of gifts. I tell you, it was my only object of value, the only one worth mentioning—admittedly a bulky, commonplace thing, whose pretentious, petty-bourgeois quality stood for everything I disliked. But its loss, now that it appeared to me in its full symbolic significance, filled me with panic. It was the feeling that I was now irrevocably damned: that they had stolen the very possibility that I might one day sober up and get back to the bourgeois world.","“By the first light of dawn, I was feeling sick, and as I sobered up I noticed my gold watch was missing. I was in a state of shock verging on hysteria. You have to understand: merely losing a gold watch is, in itself, no great tragedy, even when you’re twenty and it’s the only article of value in your life. But when you’re all of twenty and sobering up by the morning light only to find your gold watch stolen, you’re more likely to add a deeply symbolic dimension to your sense of doom. The watch was a gift from my father who normally doesn’t hand out presents. As I said, it was the only thing of value I owned, the one thing you could call my possession, something I had taken for granted, even disdained it as a tacky trinket of middle-class self-importance. I still panicked. What terrified me was how I mourned not only the watch but its mounting symbolism. My feeling was that I was already damned by the forces of darkness who stole my last shred of respectability, and along with it my chance to return to a normal life. In case I decided to sober up one day."

"Hármuk vacsoráját a perzsa fizette ki. Erzsit ez kissé idegesítette. Szinte olyan, mintha János tálalná őt a perzsának, mintha az impresszáriója lenne, enyhén szólva, és maga szerényen háttérbe vonulna... De elkergette ezt a gondolatot. Jánosnak biztosan megint nincs pénze, azért hagyja, hogy a perzsa fizessen. Vagy a perzsa ragaszkodik hozzá, keleti magnificenciájával. Különben is Párizsban mindig egy fizet csak.","The dinner was paid for by the Persians. Eliza was a little annoyed. It was almost as if John was serving him in Persia, as if he were his impresario, to put it mildly, and he was humbly in the background ... But he chased the thought away. John must have no money again, so let the Persian pay. Or the Persian clings to it, with its eastern magnificence. Anyway, in Paris there is always only one pay.","The Persian met the bill for all three of them. Erzsi was a little irritated by this. It was almost as if János had found her for the Persian, as if, not to put too fine a point on it, he were his impresario, now withdrawing modestly into the background … but she dismissed this thought. Most likely János was again out of funds and that was why he allowed the Persian to pay. Or the Persian, with his oriental magnificence, had insisted on it. Besides, in Paris one person always paid.","The three dinners were paid by the Persian. Erzsi fidgeted a little nervously. It was as if she were being served by János to the Persian, as if he were his regisseur, the man who ‘arranged’ things, to put it nicely, with the intent to retreat into the background. But she dispelled the thought as outlandish. More than likely János was short again, and he let the Persian pay. Or it was the Persian’s eastern magnanimity. And in Paris one usually paid for an entire party."

"Sokat beszélgettek Angliáról is, Ellesley doktor másik hazájáról, ahová nagyon vágyódott. Mihály is nagyon szerette Angliát. Két nagyon komoly és álmodozó évet töltött ott, mielőtt Párizsba és haza ment volna. Londonban a magány orgiáit ülte, néha hetekig nem beszélt senkivel, csak munkásokkal külvárosi sörházakban és azokkal is csak néhány szót. Szerette a szörnyű londoni klímát, vizes, püffedt, ködös puhaságát, amelybe úgy el lehet süllyedni, oly hűséges kísérője a magánynak és a spleennek.","They also talked a lot about England, Dr. Ellesley's other homeland, which he longed for. Michael also loved England. He spent two very serious and dreamy years there before going to Paris and home.

Végre az ötödik szobában... különben túlzás azt mondani, hogy végre, mert az ötödik szobában sem volt senki, de itt legalább nem csukódott be előttem egy ajtó. Ennek a szobának csak egy ajtaja volt, az, amelyen át beléptem. De aki előttem járt, nem volt a szobában.","I found an open door and a dimly lit room above, there was no one in the room, but the door opposite closed just as if someone had left the room at that moment. Remembering the maid's instruction, I walked through the room and opened the door that had just closed. Again, I get into a dim, old-fashioned, dusty, and tasteless room that had no one in, but the door opposite closed just again, as if someone had just left. I went through the room again and opened it into the third and then the fourth room. A door in front of me kept closing softly, as if someone were walking in front of me. At last in the fifth room ... otherwise it's an exaggeration to say that at last, because there was no one in the fifth room, but at least a door didn't close in front of me. There was only one door to this room, the one I entered. But whoever was in front of me was not in the room.","“At the top of the stairs I found an open door and a room in semi-darkness. There was no-one in it. Just then the door opposite closed, as if someone had just that instant left the room. Remembering the maid’s instructions, I crossed the room and opened the door that had just closed. I found myself in another semi-dark, old-fashioned, dusty and tasteless room, with no-one in it, and again the door across the way closed, as if someone had just that instant gone out. Again I crossed the room and entered a third room, then a fourth. Always a door quietly closing before me, as if someone was walking ahead of me. Finally, in the fifth room … well, it’s an overstatement to say finally, because although there was no-one in that fifth room, there at least was no door closing before me. In this room there was only one door, the one I had come through. But whoever had been walking ahead of me was not in the room.","“I went up and found an open door and a dim room but not a soul inside. But then the door across the room just closed, as if someone had left that very moment. With the servant’s directions still fresh in my mind, I crossed the room and opened the door that had closed. Once again I entered a dim, old-fashioned room, dusty and vulgar in its décor — with no one inside. Then again the door opposite just finished closing as if someone had just gone out. Again I crossed the room and stepped into a third, then a fourth room. Each time a door silently closed in front of me, as if someone were walking ahead. Finally, in the fifth room — though it’s an exaggeration to say ‘finally,’ since there was nobody in the fifth room either — but here at least the door did not close in front of me. This room had only one door, the one I had come through. But the person walking ahead of me was not in the room."

"- Éva magára maradt, és ettől kezdve nem lehetett vele bírni. Ebben az időben Budapest a síberek és az entente-tisztek kezében volt. Éva, hogy, hogy nem, az entente-tisztek körébe került. Nyelveket tudott, és a viselkedésében volt valami nem magyaros-vidékies, hanem igazán világvárosi. Úgy tudom, nagyon népszerű volt. Ekkor lett, egyik napról a másikra, kis kamaszlányból gyönyörű nővé. Ekkor került a szemébe, az addigi pajtásos és nyílt kifejezés helyett, az a másik tekintet: mindig úgy nézett, mintha közben valami távoli, halk hangokra figyelne.","""Eve was left alone, and she couldn't handle it from then on."" At that time, Budapest was in the hands of skiers and entente officers. Eve, that she didn't, was among the entente officers. He knew languages, and there was something about his behavior that was not Hungarian-rural, but really world-class. I know it was very popular. It was then, overnight, that she grew from a little teenage girl to a beautiful woman. It was then that he got the other eye in his eyes, instead of the previously buddy and open expression: he always looked as if he was watching something distant, soft in the meantime.","“Éva remained unattached, and from this point on she was impossible to put up with. By this time Budapest was in the hands of the currency sharks and the officers of the Entente. Éva somehow or other got herself into the officers’ set. She knew various languages and her manner was somehow not typically Hungarian but more cosmopolitan. I know she was very much in demand. She went, from one day to the next, from a little adolescent girl to a stunning woman. This was when, in place of the earlier friendly and open expression, her eye took on that other quality: that look, as if she were listening to some far off, murmuring sound.","“Éva preferred to be alone. And from this point on, she became impossible. In those days Budapest was occupied by unscrupulous speculators. And by the victors of World War I, the Entente Powers.

"- Jó - mondta Erzsi -, meséld tovább. Mi történt az Ulpiusokkal?","""Good,"" Erzsi said, ""tell me more."" What happened to the Ulpians?","“Yes, yes,” said Erzsi, “just get on with it. What happened to Tamás and Éva?”","“All right already,” said Erzsi. “Go on. So, what happened with Éva and Tamás?”"
"És most megint magamról kell beszélnem. Te engem mindig úgy ismertél már, mint izmos, széles, idősebb fiatalembert, kisimult, nyugodt arccal, azzal az arccal, amire Pesten azt mondják, hogy pléhpofa, és úgy tudod, hogy mindig többé-kevésbé álmos vagyok. Hát kérlek, gimnazista koromban még egészen más voltam. Mutattam neked az akkori arcképemet, láthattad, milyen vékony, éhes, nyugtalan, eksztatikus lobogású arcom volt. Sejtem, hogy nagyon csúnya lehettem - de mégis jobban szeretem az akkori arcomat. És képzelj hozzá egy megfelelő kamasztestet, egy vékony, szögletes, a gyors növéstől hajlott hátú fiút. És egy megfelelő nyurga és éhes karaktert.","And now I have to talk about myself again. You’ve always known me as a muscular, wide, older young man with a smooth, calm face, the face that is said in Pest to be a teddy bear, and you know I’m always more or less sleepy. Well, please, I was quite different when I was in high school. I showed you my portrait at the time, you could see how thin, hungry, restless my ecstatic flag was. I guess I could have been very ugly - but I still prefer my face at the time. And imagine a proper adolescent body, a thin, square boy with a back bent out of rapid growth. And a proper nagging and hungry character.","“But to get back to me. You’ve always known me as a thickset, well-built, mature young man, with a smooth calm face, what they call a ‘po-face’ in Budapest. And as you know I’ve always been rather dreamy. Let me tell you, when I was at school I was very different. I’ve shown you my picture from those days. You saw how thin and hungry, how restless my face was, ablaze with ecstasy. I suppose I must have been really ugly, but I still much prefer the way I looked then. And imagine, with all that, an adolescent body to match—a skinny, angular boy with a back rounded by growing too fast. And a corresponding lean and hungry character.","“And me? You know me as an athletic, broad-shouldered mature fellow with an impassive face, a face that some in Budapest may even call a poker face, the expressionless face of a daydreamer. Well, in my school days I was really different. I showed you a photograph from those days, and you saw how gaunt, hungry and restless I looked. It was a face blazing with passion. I sense I must have been rather homely, but I loved that face more than this one. Much more. Picture an adolescent body, a gangly, angular boy, stooping because he’s suddenly too tall. And a needy, perhaps conscientiously eccentric personality to match."
"Mihály szeme megint megtelt könnyel. Nem, ezt nem tudta elképzelni. Mindent hajlandó volt elhinni Ervinről, bizonyára szöges ciliciumot hord ruhája alatt, és halála előtt meg fogja kapni a sztigmákat... de hogy nem dohányzik!","Michael's eyes filled with tears again. No, he couldn't imagine that. He was willing to believe everything about Ervin, he must be wearing spiky silicon under his clothes and he will get the stigmas before he dies ... but that he doesn't smoke!","Mihály’s eyes again filled with tears. No, this was beyond imagining. He could have believed anything of Ervin—that he wore a spiked hairshirt under his clothing, that he would receive the stigmata before his death—but his not smoking!","Mihály’s eyes filled with tears. No, this he could not believe. Anything else he’d accept without question about Ervin, that under his robe he wore a cilicium of nails, that before his death he’d receive the stigmata, but that he quit smoking?"

"- Éppen most akarok róluk beszélni. Éveken át nem volt más vendége az Ulpius-háznak, mint én. Mikor nyolcadikosok lettünk, megváltozott a helyzet. Akkor csatlakozott Ervin és Szepetneki János. Ők Évához jöttek, nem Tamáshoz, mint én. A dolog úgy történt, hogy az iskola abban az évben is színielőadást rendezett, mint minden évben, és minthogy mi voltunk a nyolcadikosok, mi vittük a főszerepet az egész ünnepélyen. Valami alkalmi színdarabról volt szó, ami nagyon szép volt, csak az volt a baj, hogy egy eléggé terjedelmes női szerep volt benne. A fiúk elhozták erre a célra jégpályai és tánciskolai kis ideáljaikat, de a tanár, aki az előadást rendezte, egy nagyon okos és a nőket nagyon utáló, fiatal pap, egyiket sem találta alkalmasnak. Én valahogy szóvá tettem a dolgot Éva előtt. Évának attól kezdve nem volt nyugta, úgy érezte, itt az alkalom, hogy színésznői karrierjét elkezdje. Tamás persze hallani sem akart a dologról, hátborzongatóan nem előkelőnek találta, hogy az iskolával ilyen közeli, úgyszólván családi nexusba kerüljön. De engem Éva addig terrorizált, amíg megemlítettem a dolgot az illető tanárnak, aki engem nagyon szeretett, és megbízott, hogy hozzam el Évát. El is vittem. Éva csak kinyitotta a száját, és a tanár mindjárt azt mondta: - Maga fog játszani, maga és senki más. Úgyhogy még Évának állt feljebb, hivatkozott atyja szigorú és színházellenes világfelfogására, egy félóráig kérette magát, amíg végre beleegyezett.","- I want to talk about them right now. For years, the House of Ulpius had no other guests than me. When we became eighth graders, the situation changed. Then Ervin and János Szepetneki joined. They came to Eve, not to Thomas like me. The thing was, the school had a color show that year, like every year, and since we were eighth graders, we took the lead throughout the ceremony. It was a casual play that was very beautiful, the only problem was that it had a fairly voluminous female role in it. The boys brought their little ideals from ice rinks and dance schools for this purpose, but the teacher who directed the performance, a very clever young priest who hated women very much, found none suitable. I somehow made it clear to Eve. Eva had no receipt from then on, she felt this was the time to start her career as an actress. Of course, Tamás didn't even want to hear about it, he found it creepy not to get into a school nexus so close to school, so to speak. But Eve terrorized me until I mentioned it to the teacher in question, who loved me very much and entrusted me to bring Eve. I took it. Eve just opened her mouth and the teacher immediately said, ""You're going to play, you and no one else."" So she stood above Eve, citing her father's strict and anti-theatrical worldview, asking for half an hour until she finally agreed.","“I’m about to explain. For years there was no other visitor at the Ulpius house but me. When we were eighteen the situation changed. Then we were joined by Ervin and János Szepetneki. They came to see Éva, not Tamás, as I did. What happened was that around that time the school put on a drama festival, as it did every year, and as we were the final year group we did the main item of the whole event. Any chance to do a play was good news. The only trouble was that there was a large female role in it. To fill it, the boys brought along their fantasy-heroines from the skating rink and the dancing school, but the teacher producing the play, an extremely clever young priest who hated women, didn’t find any of them suitable. I somehow mentioned the fact in Éva’s hearing. From that moment she would not rest. She felt that this was her chance to begin her career as an actress. Tamás of course wouldn’t hear of it. He thought it grotesque and degrading that she should begin in the context of school, such an intimate, almost family setting. But Éva positively terrorised me until I took the matter up with the teacher in question. He was very fond of me, and told me to bring her along. This I did. She had barely opened her mouth before he declared, ‘You must have the part, you and no-one else.’ Éva plucked up the nerve to raise the subject with her puritanical, theatre-hating father and pleaded with him for half-an-hour until at last he consented.","“I’m about to tell you. For years no one else frequented the Ulpius house other than myself. In the eighth grade, things changed. That’s when Ervin and János Szepetneki joined us. They came for Éva, not for Tamás, as I did. It all started when the school staged its annual drama festival, as it did every year, and since we were eighth graders, we took the lead during the entire festival. There was talk of putting on this play which was very good, except for the fact that it called for a demanding female role. To fill it, the boys brought their dancing or skating partners, but the teacher-director, a very clever but woman-hating young priest, found none of them right for the part. I happened to bring it up to Éva. From then on she couldn’t rest. This was her opportunity to launch her theatrical career. Tamás wouldn’t hear of it and bristled at the indignity of it all. It was beyond outrageous to have his sister connected in any way with the school, especially by involving herself in one of their mediocre plays. But Éva kept tormenting me until I mentioned her to the teacher in question, who happened to like me enough to let her audition. All Éva had to do was open her mouth, and the teacher said, ‘You’re playing the part and no one else.’ Éva had the nerve to play hard-to-get. She parroted her father’s hardnosed sentiments about the theatre and needed a half-hour’s persuading before she would agree."
"- Éva, miért üzented, hogy ne keresselek? - kérdezte végre Mihály. - Miért nem akarsz találkozni velem?","""Eve, why did you tell me not to look for you?"" Mihály finally asked. - Why don't you want to meet me?","“Éva, why did you send me that message not to look for you?” Mihály finally asked. “Why don’t you want to see me?”","“Éva, why did you send word I shouldn’t look for you?” Mihály finally asked. “Why don’t you want to see me?”"
"Ekkor már Mihály háza előtt álltak. Mihály alig várta, hogy fent legyen.",By this time they were standing in front of Michael's house. Michael couldn't wait to be upstairs.,By this time they had reached Mihály’s door. He could hardly wait to get inside.,By this time they’d arrived at Mihály’s place. Mihály was dying to get upstairs.
"- Hát azt hiszed, hogy még... ne haragudj: hogy még visszajön hozzád?","""Do you think you're still ... don't be mad: he's coming back to you?""",“But do you really think he’ll still … do excuse me … that he’ll still come back to you?”,“Do you actually believe that he… I’m sorry… that he’ll come back to you?”
"Gyalog vágott neki a hegyeknek. Kis hegyi falvak körül csavargott; a lakosság megnyugtatóan viselkedett, nem üldözték. Elfogadták, mint őrült turistát. De ha egy polgárember találkozott volna vele bolyongásának harmadik vagy negyedik napján, bizonyára nem tartotta volna turistának, csak őrültnek. Nem borotválkozott már, és nem mosdott, nem aludt levetkőzve, csak menekült. És belsejében is minden összekavarodott, itt a kegyetlen hegyek szikár vonalai közt, az emberentúli magányban és elhagyatottságban. A cél leghalványabb gondolatárnya sem bukkant fel tudatában, csak azt tudta, hogy nincs visszatérés. A sok üldöző személy és dolog, az évek és az intézmények vizionáló agyában mind valami konkrét szörnyetegszerű formát öltöttek, az atyai gyárat úgy érzékelte, mint egy óriási, ütésre emelt acélrudat, de még azt is látni tudta, hogy lassan megöregszik, valahogy saját testének lassú, de látható elváltozási processzusaiban, mintha a bőre összezsugorodott volna, olyan tempóban, mint ahogy az órán a nagymutató halad. Mindezek már az idegláz delíriumos tünetei voltak.","He cut him to the mountains on foot. He wandered around small mountain villages; the population behaved reassuringly, not persecuted. He was accepted as a mad tourist. But if a citizen had met him on the third or fourth day of his wanderings, he certainly wouldn’t have considered him a tourist, just crazy. He hadn’t shaved anymore, he hadn’t washed, he hadn’t slept undressed, he had just fled. And inside, everything is confused, here between the lean lines of cruel mountains, in inhuman loneliness and desolation. Not the faintest thought of the goal appeared in his mind, he only knew there was no going back. The many persecuting people and things, years and institutions in their visionary brains, all took on some concrete monstrous shape, perceiving the paternal factory as a giant, striking steel bar, but he could even see it aging slowly, somehow its own body slowly , but in his visible lesion processes, as if his skin had shrunk, at a pace as the watch was moving in the clock. All of these were already delirium symptoms of fever.","He made his way on foot up into the hills and meandered around the villages. The natives remained peaceful, did not pursue him. They accepted him as just another crazy tourist. But a middle-class person meeting him on the third or fourth day of his wanderings would have taken him not for a tourist but a madman. He was unshaven, unwashed, and sleeping in his clothes: he was simply a man on the run. And inside, he was utterly in turmoil, up there among the harsh outline of pitiless mountains, the inhuman solitude, the utter abandonment. The faintest shadow of purpose never flickered across his consciousness. All he knew was that there was no going back. The whole horde of people and things pursuing him, the lost years and the entire middle-class establishment, fused in his visionary consciousness into a concrete, nightmarish shape. The very thought of his father’s firm was like a great steel bar raised to strike him. At the same time he could see that he was slowly ageing, his body was somehow caught up in slow but visible processes of change, as if his skin was shrivelling at the speed of a minute hand ticking round a clock. These were the first signs of a delirious fever of the nerves.","He set out for the hills on foot and roamed around tiny hilltop villages. The inhabitants were comforting in that they didn’t persecute him. They accepted him as a lunatic tourist. But if a respectable person would’ve run into him on day three or four, he would have taken him not for a tourist but just a lunatic. He didn’t shave or wash, or undress before he went to bed. He was a man on the run. And everything inside him twisted into a confused snarl, here among the rocky, unforgiving terrain, in its desolate outlines, in his isolation from humanity, in his solitude. He didn’t have the faintest idea where he was going, but he knew there was no turning back. The countless persons and things persecuting him, the years, the institutions, took on monstrous shapes in his heated brain. His father’s factory loomed like a crane hoisting a massive steel girder high overhead ready to let go and crush him. He could see himself aging and his body deteriorate slowly but vividly as if his skin were shrivelling up right before his eyes to the slow ticking of a clock. These were already the symptoms of a delirious fever."

"Mikor éjszaka magához vette csekkjét és passzusát, arra gondolt - persze nem egész komolyan -, hogy útközben esetleg úgy alakulhat, hogy elszakadnak egymástól. Mikor Terontolában kiszállt, megint átfutott fején, hogy hagyja Erzsit továbbmenni a vonattal. De most, hogy csakugyan megtörtént, meglepődött, és zavarban volt. De mindenesetre - megtörtént!","When he picked up his check and passport at night, he thought — not very seriously, of course — that on the way, they might break up. When he got out in Terontola, he ran over his head again to let Ersi go on the train. But now that it had indeed happened, he was surprised and embarrassed. But in any case - it's done!","When he had taken his cheque and passport the night before he had thought—of course, not really seriously—that they might perhaps find themselves separated during the journey. When he got off at Terontola it had again flitted across his mind that he might leave Erzsi to continue on the train. But now that it had really happened he was amazed and disturbed. But at all events—it had happened!","Why had he taken his cheque and passport the night before? On the off chance they got separated from each other? Of course. Things like that happen all the time on trips. But when he got off in Terontola, it did cross his mind that he could let Erzsi continue on by herself. Now that it had really happened, he was stunned and bewildered. At any rate, it had happened!"
"Kezével lemondó mozdulatot tett, száját furcsán elhúzta, és nagy-nagy fáradtságot érzett. Az utóbbi időben ez a négy, egymásra kapcsolt és egymást automatikusan követő aktus úgy tért vissza, mint a tic-es embereknél a rángatózás: eszébe jutott Erzsi, lemondó gesztust csinált, félrehúzta a száját, és nagy fáradtságot érzett, napjában harmincszor is. Talán mégis orvoshoz kellene menni, e miatt a fáradtság miatt? Ugyan; túléljük, apukám, túléljük.","He made a resignation with his hand, pulled his mouth strangely, and felt very tired. Lately, these four interconnected and automatically consecutive acts have returned like twitching in the people of Tic: he remembered Erzsi, made a resignation gesture, pulled his mouth aside, and felt very tired, thirty times a day. Maybe I should go to the doctor after all, because of this fatigue? Come on; we survive, my father, we survive.","His hand made a gesture of resignation, he pursed his lips oddly, and he felt very very tired. In recent days these four connected acts kept recurring in automatic sequence, like a sort of nervous tic. Thirty times a day he thought of Erzsi, made the resigned gesture, pulled the wry face, and felt a wave of exhaustion. “Perhaps I should see the doctor about this tiredness after all? Oh, come off it. We’re getting on, old chap, getting on in years.”","He waved his hand in a sign of resignation, he screwed his lips into a pout, and felt a great tiredness come over him. Lately, these little gestures, connected and sequential, returned as some uncontrollable tic. Each time he thought of Erzsi, they came on. The resigned wave. The pout. The tiredness. About thirty times a day. Maybe he should see a doctor about this tiredness? Go on, man, he told himself. We all live through it."

"- Nem, dehogy, csak előnyömre volt. Mert akadtak egyes rendtársaim, akik éreztették velem, hogy mennyire idegenkednek a fajtámtól, és így alkalmat nyújtottak nekem a szelídség és önmegtagadás gyakorlására. Meg azután Magyarországon, amikor faluhelyen lelkipásztorkodtam, valahogy mindig híre ment a dolognak, és a derék falusi hívek úgy néztek rám, mint valami csodabogárra, és sokkal nagyobb figyelemmel hallgattak. Itt Olaszországban pedig senki sem törődik vele. Itt már nekem is alig jut eszembe, hogy zsidó voltam.","- No, no, it was just to my advantage. Because there were some of my fellow policemen who made me feel like they were averse to my kind and thus gave me an opportunity to practice meekness and self-denial. And then in Hungary, when I was a pastor in a village, somehow there was always news of it, and the waisted village believers looked at me like some kind of miracle beetle and listened to him with much more attention. And here in Italy, no one cares. It hardly reminds me here that I was a Jew.","It worked only to my benefit. I did run into individual fellow-monks who made it clear how much they disliked my race, but that just presented opportunities to practise meekness and self-control. And then in Hungary, when I was a country pastor, the fact always somehow got about, and the good village faithful saw me as some sort of oddity and paid much greater attention to what I said. Here in Italy nobody bothers about it. I hardly ever think about it myself.”","More of an advantage. There were always a few who let me know of their aversion to my race, and gave me a chance to practice modesty and self-denial. And in Hungary, when I was a village pastor, somehow the news always got around, and the village faithful regarded me as a queer fish and for that reason listened to my sermons with greater interest. Here in Italy no one seems to care. Here it hardly ever occurs to me that I had been a Jew.”"
"Annál kevésbé, mert gondolhatod, hogy az adott körülmények következtében feleséged is igényekkel, méghozzá teljesen jogos igényekkel lépett fel velünk szemben, és ezeket az igényeket természetesen elsőrendű kötelességünk kielégíteni. Feleséged ez idő szerint Párizsban tartózkodik, és egyelőre beéri azzal, hogy ott-tartózkodásának költségeit viseljük; végleges elszámolásra majd csak hazajövetele alkalmával fog sor kerülni. Nem kell külön magyaráznom, hogy ez a végleges elszámolás a gyárat mily rendkívül kellemetlen helyzetbe hozhatja. Tudod jól, hogy a készpénzt, amit feleséged a vállalatba hozott, mind befektettük gépekbe, a propaganda kiépítésébe és a vállalat más úton való továbbfejlesztésébe, úgyhogy ennek az összegnek likviddé tétele nemcsak hogy nehézségeket okozna, hanem úgyszólván alapjaiban rendítené meg a vállalatot. Azt hiszem, más ember ezt is tekintetbe vette volna, mielőtt otthagyta volna feleségét nászútja alkalmából. Nem mintha eljárásod önmagában is, minden gazdasági meggondolástól függetlenül is nem lenne kvalifikálhatatlan és abszolúte ungentlemanlike, különösen egy olyan kifogástalan, korrekt úrinővel szemben, mint a feleséged.","All the less so because you may think that, as a result of your circumstances, your wife has also made claims against us, and it is, of course, our primary duty to satisfy those needs. Your wife is in Paris at this time, and for the time being we will bear the cost of her stay there; final settlement will only take place on return. I do not have to explain how extremely embarrassing this final settlement can be for the factory. You know full well that the cash your wife brought to the company has all been invested in machinery, building propaganda, and further developing the company in other ways, so making that amount liquid would not only cause difficulties, but would fundamentally shake up the company. I think another man would have taken that into account before leaving his wife on his honeymoon. It is not as if your procedure alone, regardless of any economic considerations, is unqualified and absolutely ungentlemanlike, especially to an impeccable, fair lady like your wife.","Even less so, since, as you would expect, as a result of the situation she finds herself in, your wife has herself approached us with certain demands, quite properly in our view, and these demands we naturally must satisfy as a highest priority. Your wife is at present in Paris, and for the time being has stipulated that we should meet her living expenses there. The final settlement can only be drawn up when she comes home. I really can’t overstate what an exceptionally difficult position that final settlement could put us in. As you well know, all the ready money she brought into the firm was invested in machinery, the prestige building, and other current developments, so that liquidating all these sums will not only cause us difficulties, but will practically shake the firm to its foundations. I really do think anybody else would have taken all this into account before abandoning his wife on their honeymoon. I need hardly add that, quite apart from all the financial considerations, your conduct was in itself absolutely and utterly ungentlemanly, particularly towards such a correct and blameless lady as your wife.","Especially when you consider the problems your current state of affairs created, including your wife’s demands, quite legitimate demands which she has taken up with us. Satisfying these has naturally become our top priority. For now, your wife is living in Paris, and for the time being is satisfied that we cover her expenses there. A final settlement can only be possible once she returns home. I need not remind you that this final settlement could place the factory in a very precarious position. You are well aware that the cash your wife brought into the company had already been invested in machinery, our advertising campaign and other venues like research and development. Liquidating such assets would not only be fraught with great difficulties, but practically shake our very foundation. Any other man would’ve considered this, I think, before leaving his wife on their honeymoon. This is not to say that your behaviour, in itself, independent of every economic consideration, is incalculably and utterly ungentlemanly, especially to someone so unassailable and so correct as your wife."

"Azután elmondta életrajzát, onnan kezdve, hogy Mihályt utoljára látta, egyetemi pályafutását, filológiai világhírét, amellyel oly kedvesen és naivul tudott dicsekedni, mint egy kisfiú. „Véletlenül éppen nála voltak” újságcikkek, különböző nyelveken, amelyek igen udvarias hangon emlékeztek meg egy-egy előadásáról, köztük az is, amelyet Mihály látott a Popolo d’Italiában. Azután levelek kerültek elő, nevezetes külföldi tudósok és írók baráti sorai, és meghívó Doornba, a német ex-császár archeológiai munkaközösségének nyaranként tartott összejövetelére. Valahonnan előbűvölt egy ezüstserleget is, az ex-császár monogramjával.","He then recounted his biography, from the last time he saw Michael, his university career, his world-famous philological fame, which he could brag as kindly and naively as a little boy. “He happened to be with him” newspaper articles, in different languages, commemorating one of his performances in a very polite voice, including the one Michael saw in Popolo d’Italia. Letters were then unearthed, circles of friends from prominent foreign scholars and writers, and an invitation to Doornba, the German ex-emperor’s archeological work community, to hold a summer meeting. He also conjured a silver goblet from somewhere, with the ex-emperor's monogram.","Then he described what had happened to himself since he had last seen Mihály, his academic career and his world fame as a philologist, about which he boasted with the naïve charm of a little boy. He “just happened to have with him” newspaper clippings, in a variety of languages, which deferentially reported his various lectures, among them the one Mihály had seen in the Popolo d’Italia. Then he turned up some letters from a string of eminent foreign scholars and writers, all very friendly, and an invitation card to Doorn, to the annual summer convention of the Former Emperor’s Society of Post-Imperial German Archaeologists. From somewhere or other he produced a silver goblet inscribed with the ex-Emperor’s monogram.","Then Waldheim narrated his curriculum vitae, beginning from the last time he saw Mihály, mentioning the hallmarks of his academic career, his international renown in the field of philology, about which he bragged with the charming naïveté of a child. He “just happened to have” some news clippings, in various languages, touting his lectures, among them the one Mihály had seen in the Popolo d’Italia. Soon a stack of letters appeared, sent from world-famous scholars, who just happened to be his friends, among them a letter inviting him to Doorn to a summer conference of the German ex-Kaiser’s Archaeological Society. He conjured up a silver trophy from somewhere, with the ex-Kaiser’s monogram."
"- Nem, nincs senkim - mondta Mihály, és ideges gyengeségében sírva fakadt. A lágyszívű orvos nagyon megsajnálta az elhagyott embert, és azontúl még nagyobb szeretettel bánt vele. Pedig Mihály nem azért sírt, mert csakugyan nem volt senkije, hanem ellenkezőleg, azért, mert annyi mindenkije volt, és félt, hogy nem őrizheti meg sokáig magányát, amelyet itt a kórházban annyira élvezett.","""No, I have no one,"" Michael said, crying in his nervous weakness. The soft-hearted doctor felt very sorry for the abandoned man and treated him with even greater love ever since. Yet Michael did not cry because he really had no one, but on the contrary, because he had so much of everyone and was afraid that he would not be able to keep the solitude he had enjoyed so much here in the hospital for long.","“No, no-one,” said Mihály, and, in his state of nervous debilitation, burst into tears. The tender-hearted doctor felt extremely sorry for this poor abandoned soul and began to treat him with even greater kindness. But Mihály had not wept because he had no relations, just the opposite—because he had so many—and he feared he would not long be able to preserve the solitude he so much enjoyed in the hospital.","“No, I have no one.” Mihály faltered weakly before he broke into sobs. The kind doctor took pity on the abandoned man, and thereafter treated him with even greater care. Mihály wasn’t upset because he had nobody, but, on the contrary, because he had everybody, and he was afraid of losing the solitude he cherished so much in the hospital."
- Hát mégis te loptad el?,- Did you steal it?,“So it was you who took it?”,“It was you after all?”
"- Te nagyon jó vagy, Mihály, de azért nem kell, hogy sajnálj - mondta Ervin köhögve. - Látod, az is csak áldásomra van, hogy beteg vagyok. Azért egyeztek bele, hogy ne maradjak Rómában, hanem idejöhessek Gubbióba, ahol olyan egészséges a levegő. Talán meg is fogok gyógyulni. Meg aztán a testi szenvedés hozzátartozik a mi életünk rendjéhez. Másnak gyötörnie kell a testét, énnálam a test gondoskodik magától gyötrelemről... De hagyjuk ezt. Te azért jöttél, hogy magadról beszélj, ne vesztegessük a drága időt olyasmire, amin se te, sem én nem tudunk segíteni.","""You're very good, Michael, but you don't have to be sorry,"" Ervin said, coughing. ""You see, I'm just blessed to be sick."" They agreed not to stay in Rome but to come here to Gubbio, where the air is so healthy. Maybe I'll recover. And then physical suffering is part of the order of our lives. Someone has to torment your body, for me the body takes care of itself ... But let's leave this. You came to talk about yourself, let’s not waste precious time on something that neither you nor I can help.","“You’re very good, Mihály, but you mustn’t grieve about it,” he said, coughing. “You see, it’s simply a blessing for me, being ill. Because of it they agreed that I could leave Rome to come here to Gubbio, where the air is so healthy. Perhaps I really will get better. Then again, physical suffering is part of our monastic system. Others have to mortify the body—in my case the body takes care of this itself … But let’s leave all this. You came here to talk about yourself. We shouldn’t be wasting precious time on things neither you nor I can do anything about.”","“Kind of you, Mihály, but don’t feel sorry for me,” said Ervin, coughing. “You see, even my illness is a blessing. That’s why they let me leave Rome and come here to Gubbio where the air is much healthier. There’s even a chance I may recover. But truth be told, bodily suffering is in keeping with our vows here. Some look for creative ways to torture their bodies. Mine takes care of that for me. But let’s forget all this. You came here to talk about yourself, so let’s not waste our precious time on something that neither you nor I can help.”"

"- Ez itt Erzsi. Lényegesen nem változott, hiszen nem múlt el olyan sok idő azóta, hogy a feleségem volt. Egy-két párizsi ruhadarab van rajta, sikkesek, de az az érzésem, hogy nem a legjobb minőségűek. Erzsi kissé meg van törve. A hangjában van valami nagyon enyhe fátyolozottság, ami megfájdítja a szívemet. Szegénykém! Az a gazember Mihály! Hát kellett ez neki? Úgy látszik, még nem heverte ki... vagy talán Párizsban újabb csalódások érték? Az ismeretlen férfi... Ó, Istenem, Istenem, én itt Bodrogi Péter sógornőjéről beszélek, és közben legjobban szeretnék meghalni.","- This is Erzsi. It hasn’t changed significantly since not so much time has passed since I was my wife. It’s a couple of Parisian garments on it, chic, but I feel like they’re not the best quality. Erzsi is a little broken. There is something very mild veiled in his voice that hurts my heart. Poor thing! That bastard Michael! Did he need it? Looks like you haven't figured it out yet ... or maybe it's another disappointment in Paris? The unknown man ... Oh, my God, I'm talking here about Peter Bodrogi's sister-in-law, and I want to die the most.","“Here’s Erzsi. Essentially she hasn’t changed, not even after all that’s happened and all the time that’s passed since she was my wife. She’s wearing one or two bits and pieces of Paris clothing, chic enough, but, I fear, not of the best quality. She’s a bit down. In her voice there’s a certain, very slight, veiled quality that breaks my heart. Poor little thing! That bastard Mihály! What did she need him for? It seems she hasn’t yet got over him … or perhaps she’s suffered new disappointments in Paris? The unknown man … Oh my God, my God, here am I chattering on about Péter Bodrogi when I’d rather die.","This was his Erzsi. In essence she hadn’t changed, but then not much time had elapsed since she’d been his wife. She wore one or two Parisian pieces, chic, but he noted with qualm, not of the best quality. Erzsi looked a little tired. The faint tremor in her voice broke his heart. Poor darling! That beastly Mihály! Did she need this? Seemed she was not over him yet. Or maybe in Paris she suffered new disappointments in love? The nameless lover. Oh, God. And here he was gossiping about Péter Bodrogi’s sister-in-law, when all he wanted to do was die."
"- Monsieur Lutphali Suratgar - mutatta be. Erzsi szemébe egy sasorr mögül egy kegyetlenül intenzív szempár sugara fúródott. Erzsi összerázkódott. Sári is szemlátomást meg volt döbbenve. Első érzésük az volt, hogy egy felületesen szelídített tigrissel ülnek egy asztalhoz.","""Monsieur Lutphali Suratgar,"" he introduced. A ray of a cruelly intense pair of eyes pierced Erzsi's eyes behind a row of eagles. Erzsi shuddered. Sari was also visibly shocked. Their first feeling was that they were sitting at a table with a superficially tamed tiger.","“Monsieur Suratgar Lutphali,” he announced. From behind an aquiline nose two fiercely intense eyes met Erzsi’s, causing her to shudder. Sári too was shocked by the penetrating stare. Their first feeling was that they had sat down at table with a somewhat imperfectly tamed tiger.","“Monsieur Lutphali Suratgar,” began his introduction. An eagle nose and a pair of unmercifully penetrating eyes met Erzsi’s gaze. She nearly shuddered. Sári was also visibly affected.

Pedig hát... És most még azt is mondod majd nyilván, hogy szép kis barátaim vannak. Erre azt felelhetném, hogy Szepetneki nem barátom, ami persze csak kibúvás volna a kérdés alól. De... hogy is mondjam... ilyen emberek is vannak... Az óralopás gyerekes előgyakorlat volt. Szepetneki azóta virágzó szélhámos lett, volt már nagyon sok pénze is, és akkor erőszakos módon rám tukmált különböző összegeket, amiket nem tudtam visszaadni neki, mert nem tudtam, hol csavarog, és ült már börtönben is, és írt már nekem Bajáról, hogy küldjek neki öt pengőt. És időnként felbukkan, és mindig valami nagyon kellemetlen dolgot tud mondani. De mondom, vannak ilyen emberek is. Ha nem tudnád, most legalább láttad.

Szepetneki has since become a thriving rogue, he already had a lot of money, and then he forcibly pushed me various sums that I couldn't give him back because I didn't know where he was going and he was already in jail and he wrote me about Baja to send him five pengos. And he shows up sometimes and can always say something very unpleasant. But I say, there are people like that. If you didn't know, at least you've seen it now.

And every now and then he turns up and always manages to say something really unpleasant. But as I say, people like him do exist. If you didn’t know that, at least now you’ve seen it.

Since then he’s become a big-time swindler. There was a time he had tons of money, and he’d thrust various amounts at me, which I couldn’t pay back because I never knew where he was creeping around. He was in jail once. Another time, he wrote me from Baja asking for money. He surfaces now and then with a knack for saying the rudest things. I’m telling you, there are people like this.

"Akkor történt. A kút mellett a föld megnyílt, és újra ott volt lába előtt az örvény. Csak egy pillanatig tarthatott, azután elmúlt. Minden a helyén volt.

"De tisztában volt vele, hogy csakugyan tetszik Szepetneki Jánosnak, hogy az megkívánta a testét, éhes, kamaszos módon, minden férfibölcsesség nélkül, egyszerűen, utálatosan. És ez oly jólesett neki, hogy egész testében meggyorsult a vérkeringés bőrfelülete alatt, mint mikor iszik az ember. Nem volt hozzászokva ehhez a nyers ösztönösséghez. Hozzá a férfiak általában szerelemmel és finom szavakkal közeledtek. Szerelmük mindig a művelt és jó családból való úri nőnek szólt. És azután Szepetneki annak idején mélyen megsértette női hiúságában. Házasságának összeomlása talán akkor kezdődött, és Erzsi azóta is fájdalmasan hordta magában Szepetneki szavait. És most itt az orvosság, az elégtétel. Olyan kacéran viselkedett Szepetnekivel szemben, hogy nem is hitte magáról, hogy ezt is tudja: hogy a végén annál hidegebben utasíthassa vissza, bosszút állva Ravennáért.","But he knew that John Szepetneki really liked that he needed his body, in a hungry, adolescent way, without any masculine wisdom, simply, disgustingly. And it was so good for him that his blood circulation throughout his body was accelerated like when a person was drinking. He was not used to this crude instinct. Men usually approached him with love and subtle words. Their love was always for a gentleman from an educated and good family. And then Szepetneki at that time deeply offended her female vanity. The collapse of his marriage may have begun then, and Erzsi has been painfully carrying Szepetneki's words ever since. And now here is the medicine, the satisfaction. He acted so flirtatiously against Szepetnek that he didn't even think he knew it: that in the end he could reject it even colder, taking revenge for Ravenna.","But she was fully aware that she really did attract János Szepetneki: that he desired her body, in a hungry, adolescent way, devoid of adult restraint, single-mindedly, obscenely. And this so delighted her that through her whole being the blood moved faster under the skin, as if she had been drinking. She wasn’t used to this raw instinctuality. Men generally approached her with love and fine words. Their addresses were always to the well-born, well-educated daughter of a good family. And then Szepetneki had come along, that time in Ravenna, and deeply offended her female vanity. Perhaps that had been the start of the collapse of her marriage, and she had ever since carried inside her the sting of Szepetneki’s words. Now here was her remedy, her satisfaction. She behaved so coquettishly towards him that she actually ceased to believe what she really knew: that she was at last taking revenge for the insult at Ravenna, a revenge all the colder for the delay.","But it was abundantly clear János Szepetneki wanted her. He wanted her body, hungrily, greedily as an adolescent. Without reason. Simply. Repulsively. It actually made her feel good, so good in fact that her pulse raced under her skin, flooding her with warmth like the effect of robust wine. She wasn’t used to such unbridled instinct. The men she was accustomed to typically approached her with tender, loving words. They conducted their affairs with sophisticated women from solid, dignified families. In Ravenna, Szepetneki had injured her womanly dignity. Perhaps that insult was the beginning of her marriage breaking up, and ever since she’d been smouldering with its painful burden. And now, getting back at him would be sweet revenge. She’d been deliberately leading him on, and flirted with him so shamelessly she could hardly believe it, but in the end she’d reject him all the more cruelly. Payback for Ravenna."

Today, everything is work: work is the reward for the young person who starts, for his studies, and the work is also for penance and punishment for those who have failed. If he goes home and works properly, his father will sooner or later forgive him.","And once home he would have to knuckle down to work. Now everything would be work. Work was the promised reward for a young man setting out, for completing his studies, and work was the penitential act and punishment for those who met with failure. If he went home and worked steadily, sooner or later his father would forgive him.","And back in his father’s company, once and for all he’d buckle down to work. Work was everything. Work was a reward and a fresh start for a young man after years of study, but work was also an act of penance for someone who’d botched things up badly.

"Az Ulpius-házban ott ültek Ervin és János. Én jókedvűen előadtam nekik, hogy fejenként tizenöt centigramm morfiumot vettünk be, és most rövidesen meg fogunk halni, de előbb még el akarunk búcsúzni. Tamás már egészen fehér volt és tántorgott, rajtam nem látszott semmi más, mint hogy sok bort ittam, és sűrűn beszélek, mint a részegek.

I am cheerfully telling them that we have taken fifteen centigrams of morphine per head, and now we are going to die soon, but we want to say goodbye first. Tamás was already quite white and staggered, I could see nothing but drinking a lot of wine and speaking like a drunk. John immediately ran away, phoned the ambulance, announcing that there were two young men here who had taken in fifteen centigrams of morphine per head.","“In the Ulpius house we found Ervin and János in their usual chairs. I gaily announced the fact that we had each taken fifteen centigrams of morphine and would soon be dead, but first we wanted to say goodbye. Tamás was already white as a sheet and staggering. I just looked as if I had had a glass too many, and I had the thick speech of a drunk. János instantly rushed out and phoned Casualty to tell them there were two youths who had each taken fifteen centigrams of morphine.","“Ervin and János waited for us at the Ulpius house. I took perverse delight in telling them we each took fifteen centigrams of morphine and would soon be dead. But first we wanted to say goodbye. Tamás, white as a sheet, was already staggering.

"Mikor aznap estefelé hazament, már sürgöny várta, amelyben Waldheim kérte, hogy menjen el hozzá vacsorára. Mihály mindjárt fel is ült egy villamosra, és legördült a Palazzo Falconierihez. Szerette a C-t, ezt a fantasztikus villamosvonalat, amely a pályaudvartól odavitt, megkerülve a fél várost, itt-ott erdőségeken haladt át, a Colosseum előtt megállt, súrolta a Palatinus romjait, száguldott a Tevere partján, a sínek két oldalán évezredek cavalcadéja vonult fel, és az egész csak egy negyedóra hosszat tartott.","When he went home that evening, there was an emergency in which Waldheim asked him to go to him for dinner. Michael immediately boarded a tram and dropped off at Palazzo Falconieri. He loved the C, this fantastic tram line that took him from the train station, bypassing half the city, passing through woods here and there, stopping in front of the Colosseum, scrubbing the ruins of the Palatinus, rushing on the two sides of the rails for thousands of years. and it all lasted only a quarter of an hour.","When he arrived home late that afternoon a telegram was waiting for him. Waldheim had invited him to dinner. Mihály immediately boarded a tram and set off for the Palazzo Falconieri. He loved the ‘C’ line, that wonderful route which would take him there from the main railway station skirting half the city, passing through various areas of woodland, stopping at the Coliseum, brushing past the Palatine ruins and racing alongside the Tiber, the cavalcade of the millennia passing in procession on either side of the rails, and the whole journey taking just a quarter-of-an-hour.","When he returned home early evening, a telegram had already arrived in which Waldheim extended an invitation to supper. Mihály promptly stepped on a tram that looped down to the Palazzo Falconieri. He liked taking the C-Line, that scenic tram-line which ran from the main terminal and bypassed half the city, rolling through stretches of dappled woods, stopping in front of the Coliseum, rolling past the Palatine ruins, and then sweeping along the banks of the Tiber, a cavalcade of thousands of years rushing by on either side, the entire trip taking only fifteen minutes."

Te persze nem képzeled, hogy vallástörténettel mennyire meg lehet hódítani a nőket. Eszik a kezemből a vallástörténetet. Egyébként attól félek, hogy a nőket differenciálszámítással és kettős könyvvitellel is meg lehet hódítani, ha az ember kellő intenzitással mondja el. A szövegre úgysem figyelnek. És ha figyelnek, nem értik. És néha mégis megtévesztik az embert. Néha egészen olyanok, mintha emberek volnának. Nem baj. Szeretem őket. És ők is engem, az a fő. Na, ide bemegyünk.","""She's a very nice woman,"" he said as he came down. - Her breasts are a little hanging, but that's okay, she's used to it. I met him at the Forum, conquering him by telling him that Black Stone might have phallic significance. Of course, you can’t imagine how conquered women can be with religious history. It eats the history of religion out of my hands. By the way, I am afraid that women can be conquered through differential calculations and double-entry bookkeeping, if you tell them with enough intensity. They don't pay attention to the text anyway. And if they listen, they don't understand. And sometimes people are still deceived. Sometimes they are quite like people. No problem. I love them. And they're me, that's the main thing. Well, we're going in here.","“A very nice lady,” he said as he emerged. “Breasts hang down a bit, but it’s not a problem. You have to get used to that here. I met her in the Forum and made a conquest of her by telling her that the Black Stone was probably a phallic symbol. You really can’t imagine how useful religious history can be for getting around women. They eat it out of my hand. Mind you, I fear you could probably do the same with differential calculus or double-entry book-keeping, so long as you talked about it with the proper intensity. They never listen to what you actually say. Or if they do listen, they never understand. All the same they can sometimes have you on. Sometimes they really are almost human. Never mind. I love them. And they love me, that’s the main thing. So, let’s go in here.”","“A very charming woman,” Waldheim said once he was down and they started walking. “Breasts a little droopy, but you get used to them. I bumped into her at the Forum and won her over by telling her the Black Stone had phallic significance. You probably had no idea that religious history had such power over women. They eat it out of my hand. Ah, I’m afraid one could do the same thing through differential equations, even accounting, provided one does it with the requisite intensity. They really just pretend to listen, and those that actually do don’t get it. Though sometimes they can surprise you. Sometimes a woman can be almost like a man. Doesn’t matter. I love them all. And they love me, and that’s the main thing. All right, we’ll go in here.”"

"- Ja, éppen azt akarom elmondani. Mikor látták, hogy orvos, legalábbis ilyen orvos, mint én vagyok, nem segíthet, elhívatták Pater Severinust a Sant Ubaldo kolostorból. Ez a Pater Severinus nagyon különös és szent ember. Valami messzi országból vetődött Gubbióba, nem lehet tudni, honnan. A városban nemigen lehetett látni, csak nagy ünnepeken vagy temetéseken, különben nem jött le a hegyről, ahol szigorú önmegtagadó életet élt. Most valahogy mégis sikerült rábírni ezt a Pater Severinust, hogy lejöjjön, és látogassa meg a beteg hölgyet. A találkozásuk, azt mondják, igen megrázó és drámai volt. A hölgy, amint meglátta Pater Severinust, nagyot sikoltott és összeesett. Pater Severinus is elsápadt és megtántorodott. Úgy látszik, érezte, milyen nehéz dologról van szó. Azután mégis sikerült neki.","- Yeah, that's what I want to say. When they saw that a doctor, at least a doctor like me, could not help, they called Pater Severinus from the convent of Sant Ubaldo. This Sater Severinus is a very strange and holy man. He was thrown into Gubbio from some distant country, it is not known where. It was hard to see in the city, only at big holidays or funerals, otherwise it did not come down the hill where it lived a strict self-denial life. Now, somehow, he still managed to persuade this Pater Severinus to come down and visit the sick lady. Their meeting, they say, was very shocking and dramatic. The lady screamed loudly and collapsed as soon as she saw Pater Severinus. Pater Severinus also paled and staggered. He seemed to feel how hard it was. Then he succeeded.","“Ah, I was just coming to that. When they realised that a doctor, or rather my sort of doctor, was no use, they called in Father Severinus, from the Sant’ Ubaldo monastery. This Father Severinus was a very special and holy person. He had turned up in Gubbio from some faraway country, no-one could discover which. He was rarely seen in the town. Apart from major festivals or funerals he never left the mountain, where he lived his life of strict self-denial. However he was now somehow prevailed upon to come down and visit the disturbed woman. The meeting between them, they say, was harrowing and dramatic. When she caught sight of him she screamed and collapsed. Father Severinus himself turned pale and staggered on his feet. It seems he realised what a difficult case it would be. But he did succeed in the end.”","“Yes, I was getting to that. When they conceded that a doctor, at least a doctor like myself, could not help, they called in Father Severinus from the Saint Ubaldo monastery. This Father Severinus had a reputation as a uniquely gifted holy man. He journeyed to Gubbio from a faraway country, from where exactly I couldn’t tell you. You’d hardly ever see him in the city. With the exception of feast days or funerals when he’d make his way down the mountain, he never left the monastery where he lived a life of rigorous self-denial. Somehow it was possible to persuade Father Severinus to come down and visit this sick woman. Their meeting, it is said, was dramatic and harrowing. The woman, as soon as she saw Father Severinus, screamed and then fainted. Father Severinus, himself, was visibly shaken. It seems he was overcome by the enormity of his task. Nevertheless he succeeded.”"

"- Mi is ezt mondtuk, de ő nem akart elköltözni. Nagyon boldog volt, hogy a halott meglátogatta. Egész nap csak feküdt, mint maga, és várta az éjszakát.

He was very happy that the dead had visited him. He lay just like himself all day waiting for the night. Meanwhile, he was rapidly thinning, and the housemates were very worried about him.

I was actually called to persuade the lady to move.","“That’s what we said, but she didn’t want to move. She was very happy to be visited by the dead person. She just slept all day, as you do, and waited for the night. Meanwhile she was rapidly losing weight, and the people of the house were very worried about her. And they weren’t exactly pleased about a dead man calling at the house every night. It was a rather patrician family with strict moral views. The truth was, they had sent for me so that I would use my authority as a doctor to make her leave.”","“Exactly. But she didn’t want to. She was quite happy with these visitations. Just like you, she spent the entire day in bed waiting for the night. Meanwhile she was wasting away at an alarming pace, and the residents of the house started to worry about her.

They asked me to take the case for no other reason than to use my professional clout as a doctor to make her move.”"

Love needs distance so the lovers can draw near each other. Of course it’s all illusory because love really estranges. Love is polar — in that two lovers are attracted by opposite charges.”"
"- Jön eszembe. Szálljak ki, mert Dante ilyen disznóságokat ír? Arezzo poros kis fészek, biztosan van benne egy dóm a XIII. századból, egy Palazzo Communale, a Duce arcképe minden sarkon és megfelelő nemzeti feliratok, sok kávéház és egy Stella d’Italia nevű szálloda. Nem vagyok rá kíváncsi. Unom. Szeretnék már Capriban lenni.","- It comes to mind. Should I get out because Dante writes pigs like that? Arezzo is a dusty little nest, it must have a dome from the 13th century. century, a Palazzo Communale, a portrait of the Duce on every corner and appropriate national inscriptions, many cafés and a hotel called Stella d’Italia. I'm not curious about it. Unom. I want to be in Capri already.","“I see. We’re getting off at Arezzo because Dante wrote that sort of rubbish. Arezzo will be just another dusty little bird’s nest, doubtless with a thirteenth-century cathedral, a Palazzo Communale, a bust of the Duce on every street-corner, with the usual patriotic inscriptions, several cafés, and a hotel called the Stella d’Italia. I really am not very interested. I’m bored. I just wish I was already in Capri.”","That it wasn’t simply imagined by Dante when he compared its athletes with devils who fashioned wind instruments out of their asses.” “So, I should get off just because Dante happened to write something vulgar? Arezzo is likely a dirty little nest, with a dome from the 13th century no less, a Palazzo Comunale, a poster of Il Duce on every corner with the usual nationalist propaganda, coffeehouses galore, and a hotel by the name of Stella d’Italia. I’m not interested. Tired of it. I’d like to be in Capri already.”"
És lemondóan intett a kezével.,And he waved his hand resignedly.,And he made a gesture of hopelessness.,And with his hand he made a gesture of resignation.
"Azonnal írt Tivadarnak, hogy egészségi állapota nem engedi meg a hosszú utazást. A pénzt nem küldi el Millicentnek. Millicent olyan jómódú, hogy nem határoz nála; ha eddig tudott várni, várhat még egy kicsit. A késedelemért Tivadar felelős, miért nem küldött több pénzt neki.","He immediately wrote to Tivadar that his state of health did not allow for a long journey. He won't send the money to Millicent. Millicent is so affluent that he does not decide for him; if you could wait so far, you could wait a little longer. Tivadar is responsible for the delay, which is why he did not send him more money.",He wrote at once to Tivadar to say that his state of health would not permit an extended journey. He did not send the money to Millicent. Millicent was so rich she could manage without it. If she had waited all this time she could wait a bit longer. The delay was Tivadar’s fault for not sending more money.,"He wrote to Tivadar at once, telling him his health didn’t allow for a long trip. The money he owed Millicent would be delayed. Millicent was so well-to-do, it wouldn’t matter to her anyhow. If she’d waited this long, she could wait a little longer. He thanked Tivadar, for not sending him more money."
"De nagyon sokat nem foglalkozott ezzel a kérdéssel. Ösztönei azt mondták, hogy Olaszországban tulajdonképpen egészen mindegy, kik vannak uralmon, és milyen eszmék nevében kormányozzák a népet. A politika csak a felszínt érinti, a nép, a vegetatív, tengerszerű olasz nép csodás passzivitással hordozza hátán a változó időt, és nem vállal közösséget nagyszerű történelmével. Az volt a gyanúja, hogy már a köztársasági és császári Róma is, óriási gesztusaival, hősiességével és disznóságaival, csak a felszín férfias színjátéka volt, néhány zseniális színész magánügye volt az egész rómaiság, és azalatt az olaszok nyugodtan ették a tésztát, dalolták a szerelmet, és nemzették megszámlálhatatlan ivadékaikat.","But he didn’t deal with this issue very much. His instincts said that in Italy, in fact, it did not matter who was in power and in whose name they governed the people. Politics only touches the surface, the people, the vegetative, sea-like Italian people carry the changing time on their backs with miraculous passivity and do not take communion with its great history. It was suspected that even Republican and Imperial Rome, with its tremendous gestures, heroism, and harshness, was only a masculine play of the surface, all of Rome was a private affair of some genius actor, and in the meantime the Italians ate the pasta calmly, sang love, and gave birth to their innumerable offspring.","However he did not occupy himself at great length with this question. His instincts told him that in Italy it was all very much the same whoever happened to be in power and whatever the ideas in whose name they ruled. Politics touched only the surface. The people, the vegetative sea of the Italian masses, bore the changing times on their back with astonishing passivity, and lived quite unconnected with their own remarkable history. He suspected that even Republican and Imperial Rome, with its huge gestures, its heroics and bestial stupidities, had been nothing more than a virile drama on the surface, the whole Roman Empire the mere private affair of a few brilliant actors, while down below the Italians placidly ate their pasta, sang songs of love, and begat their countless offspring.","He tried not to become too carried away by the subject. His instincts told him it didn’t really matter who was in power in Italy, or what ideology governed its people. Politics skimmed only the surface, and the people, like a sentient ocean, endured the changing times with remarkable passivity, oblivious to their monumental history. He entertained a fleeting suspicion that both the Republic and the Empire, in their epic gestures, famed heroism and infamous orgies, were nothing more than superficially heroic plays acted out by superficially masculine men, and the whole production that was Rome was nothing more than the brainchild of a few brilliant actors, and it was in this historically happy state that the Italians stuffed themselves with their pasta, sang their love songs, and sired their innumerable bambini."
"De legjobban mégis a budai várat szerettem. Régi utcáit sose untam meg. A régi dolgok akkor is jobban vonzottak, mint az újak. Csak annak volt mélyebb valósága a szememben, amibe sok-sok emberélet ivódott már bele, amit úgy tett maradandóvá a múlt, mint Kőmíves Kelemenné magas Déva várát.","But I still loved the castle of Buda the most. I never got bored of its old streets. Even then, old things are more attractive than new ones. There was only a deeper reality in my eyes, into which many, many human lives had been immersed, which the past had made permanent, like the castle of Deva, the high-spirited Clement of Masonry.","“But best of all I loved the Castle Hill district of Buda. I never tired of its ancient streets. Even in those days old things attracted me more than new ones. For me the deepest truth was found only in things suffused with the lives of many generations, which hold the past as permanently as mason Kelemen’s wife buried in the high tower of Deva.","“But above all I loved the castle district of Buda. I never tired of its old streets. Older things attracted me more than the new. In my eyes, only objects steeped in many, many lives held a deeper reality, one which made the past enduring. Like Déva Castle with its unique legend of Kelemen, the master mason, sacrificing his wife and mixing her ashes with the mortar to hold the tower in place."
"- Ja, azt csak azért mondtam, mert kíváncsi voltam, hogy Mihály pofon üt-e. De Mihály senkit sem üt pofon. Ez az ő baja. Egy pofon annyi mindent felszabadít... de hogy visszatérjek: maga az első pillanattól kezdve nagy hatást tett rám.","""Yeah, I only said that because I was wondering if Michael would slap me."" But Michael doesn't slap anyone. This is his problem. A slap frees so much ... but to return: I was very impressed from the first moment.","“Yes, I only said that to see if Mihály would slap my face. But Mihály doesn’t slap anyone’s face. That’s what’s wrong with him. He always turns the other cheek. But to get back to the point: from the first moment you had an enormous effect on me.”","“Oh, yes. I only said that to see if Mihály would hit me. But Mihály doesn’t hit anyone. That’s his chief problem. A backhand across the face can be so liberating on so many levels. But getting back to my point. My point is, you had a profound effect on me the very first time I saw you.”"
"nagyon szomorú hírt kell közölnöm Önnel. Pater Severinus, a gubbiói szerzetes, súlyosan megbetegedett. Illetve már régebben tüdőbeteg volt, és most elérkezett abba a stádiumba, amikor már nem maradhatott tovább a kolostorban, és idehozták a kórházba. Azokban az órákban, amikor sem betegsége, sem az áhítatosság nem vették igénybe, alkalmam volt elbeszélgetni vele, és némi bepillantást nyertem csodálatos lelkivilágába. Azt hiszem, ezt az embert régibb századokban szentként tisztelték volna. Pater Severinus sokszor és a legnagyobb szeretet hangján beszélt önről, tőle tudtam meg - mily megdöbbentőek a Gondviselés útjai -, hogy önök gyermekkori jóbarátok voltak és mindig nagyon szerették egymást. Megkért, hogy értesítsem önt, ha az elkerülhetetlen be fog következni. Ezt a kérését most teljesítem is, mert Pater Severinus tegnapról mára virradó éjjel meghalt. Utolsó percig eszméleténél volt, és ágya mellett ülő rendtársaival együtt imádkozott, mikor eljött távozásának ideje.","I have very sad news to tell you. Pater Severinus, a monk from Gubbio, was seriously ill. Or he had a lung disease in the past and had now reached a stage where he could no longer stay in the convent and was taken here to the hospital. In the hours when neither illness nor reverence was used, I had the opportunity to talk to him and gain some insight into his wonderful soul. I think this man would have been revered as a saint in older centuries. Pater Severinus spoke of you many times and in the voice of the greatest love, and I learned from him — how shocking the ways of Providence are — that you were good friends of childhood and always loved each other very much. He asked me to let you know if the inevitable would happen. I am complying with this request now, for Pater Severinus has died the night before yesterday. He was conscious until the last minute, praying with his fellow officers sitting next to his bed when it was time for him to leave.","I have some very sad news for you. Father Severinus, the Gubbio monk, recently fell seriously ill. More precisely, he had a long-standing tubercular condition which got to the stage where he could no longer remain in the monastery and they brought him to the hospital here. During those hours when neither his illness nor his devotions claimed him, I had the opportunity to talk with him, and gained some small insight into his remarkable state of mind. I have no doubt that in earlier centuries this man would have been venerated as a saint. He spoke of you often and in terms of the greatest affection, and I learnt from him—how mysterious are the ways of Providence—that in your youth you and he had been close friends and always very attached to one another. He asked me to let you know when the inevitable happened. This request I now fulfil, for Father Severinus died in the night, towards dawn this morning. He was alert to the last, praying with his fellow Franciscans seated by his bed, when the moment of departure came.","I must give you some very sad news.

"Szerencsére volt a kórházban egy orvos, aki félig angol volt, ezt hívták Mihály ágyához. Mihály sokáig élt Angliában, és az angol nyelv annyira átment a vérébe, hogy most sem felejtette el, és jól megértették egymást.","Luckily, there was a doctor in the hospital who was half English, this was called to Michael's bed. Michael had lived in England for a long time, and the English language had passed into his blood so much that he did not forget it now, and they understood each other well.","Luckily there was in the hospital a doctor who was half English, and who was called to his bed. Mihály had lived in England for many years and the language flowed in his veins, so much so that it did not desert him now, and they could communicate fully.","A doctor at the hospital who happened to be part English was called to his bedside. This turned out to be a lucky break for Mihály who had spent years living in England. English came so naturally to him, it was practically in his blood. He and the doctor understood each other perfectly."
