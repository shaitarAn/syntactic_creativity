玄德自到新野，軍民皆喜，政治一新。建安十二年春，甘夫人生劉禪。是夜有白鶴一隻，飛來縣衙屋上，高鳴四十餘聲，望西飛去。臨分娩時，異香滿室。甘夫人嘗夜夢仰吞北斗，因而懷孕，故乳名阿斗。此時曹操正統兵北征。玄德乃往荊州，說劉表曰：“今曹操悉兵北征，許昌空虛，若以荊襄之衆，乘間襲之，大事可就也。”表曰：“吾坐據九郡足矣，豈可別圖？”玄德默然。表邀入後堂飲酒。酒至半酣，表忽然長歎。玄德曰：“兄長何故長歎？”表曰：“吾有心事，未易明言。”玄德再欲問時，蔡夫人出立屏後。劉表乃垂頭不語。須臾席散，玄德自歸新野。,"Since Xuande arrived in Xinye, both the army and the people were happy, and the politics were renewed. In the spring of the 12th year of Jian'an, Mrs. Gan gave birth to Liu Chan. That night, a white crane flew to the county government house, shouted for more than forty times, and flew to the west. When I was about to give birth, the fragrance filled the room. Mrs. Gan tasted a night dream of swallowing the Big Dipper, so she became pregnant, so she was named Adou. At this time, Cao Cao's orthodox troops marched north. Xuande went to Jingzhou and said to Liu Biao, ""Now Cao Cao is marching to the north, and Xuchang is empty. If the crowd of Jingxiang were to attack it, then a major event could be done."" , why don't you take pictures?"" Xuande was silent. Invited to drink in the back hall. When the wine was half full, the watch suddenly sighed. Xuande said, ""Why is your brother sighing so long?"" The table said, ""I have something on my mind, but I haven't made it clear."" When Xuande wanted to ask again, Mrs. Cai came out behind the screen. Liu Biao lowered his head and said nothing. After a while, the banquet was scattered, and Xuande returned to Xinye.","Xuande agrees to go to defend the city of Xinye, and it is here that his son Liu Shan is born to his wife, Lady Gan, in the spring of AD 207. Auspicious signs herald the birth of Liu Shan. On the night of his birth, a white crane lands on the roof and sings before flying west. And Lady Gan dreams that she has swallowed the stars of the Northern Dipper, and that this is why she conceived. To Xuande’s great frustration, Liu Biao refuses to exploit Cao Cao’s attention being taken up with battles in the north. ‘We could easily capture his capital,’ says Xuande. But Liu Biao replies, ‘I am happy with the lands I have. What would I do with more?’ Then he turns to Xuande, saying, ‘I’ve something troubling me. I would like your opinion.’ But before he can unburden himself, Lady Cai appears, and the conversation stops. Late in the year, in deep winter, Xuande is summoned to Jingzhou to see Liu Biao.","The arrival of Liu Bei in Xinye was a matter of rejoicing to all the inhabitants, and the whole administration was reformed. In the spring of the twelfth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 207), Liu Bei's wife, Lady Gan, game birth to a son who was named Liu Shan. The night of his birth a crane settled on the roof of the house, screeched some forty times and then flew away westward. Just at the time of birth a miraculous incense filled the chamber. Lady Gan one night had dreamed that she was looking up at the sky and the constellation of the Great Bear had fallen down her throat. And she conceived soon after. While Cao Cao was absent from the capital on his northern expedition, Liu Bei went to Liu Biao and said to him, “Why do you not take this opportunity to march against the capital? An empire might follow from that.” “I am well placed here,” was the reply. “Why should I attempt other things?” Liu Bei said no more. Then the Imperial Protector invited him into the private apartments to drink; and while they were so engaged, he suddenly began to sigh despondently. “O Brother, why do you sigh thus?” asked Liu Bei. “I have a secret sorrow that is difficult to speak about,” said Liu Biao. Liu Bei was on the point of asking what it was when Lady Cai came and stood behind the screen, whereat Liu Biao hung his head and became silent. Before long host and guest bade each other farewell, and Liu Bei went back to his own place at Xinye."

布見了此馬，大喜，謝肅曰：“兄賜此良駒，將何以為報？”肅曰：“某為義氣而來，豈望報乎！”布置酒相待。酒酣，肅曰：“肅與賢弟少得相見；令尊却常會來。”布曰：“兄醉矣！先父棄世多年，安得與兄相會？”肅大笑曰：“非也：某說今日丁刺史耳。”布惶恐曰：“某在丁建陽處，亦出於無奈。”肅曰：“賢弟有擎天駕海之才，四海孰不欽敬？功名富貴，如探囊取物，何言無奈而在人之下乎？”布曰：“恨不逢其主耳。”肅笑曰：“‘良禽擇木而棲，賢臣擇主而事。’見機不早，悔之晚矣。”布曰：“兄在朝廷，觀何人為世之英雄？”肅曰：“某遍觀羣臣，皆不如董卓。董卓為人敬賢禮士，賞罰分明，終成大業。”布曰：“某欲從之，恨無門路。”肅取金珠、玉帶列於布前。布驚曰：“何為有此？”肅令叱退左右，告布曰：“此是董公久慕大名，特令某將此奉獻——赤兔馬亦董公所贈也。”布曰：“董公如此見愛，某將何以報之？”肅曰：“如某之不才，尚為虎賁中郎將；公若到彼，貴不可言。”布曰：“恨無涓埃之功，以為進見之禮。”肅曰：“功在翻手之間，公不肯為耳。”布沈吟良久曰：“吾欲殺丁原，引軍歸董卓，何如？”肅曰：“賢弟若能如此，眞莫大之功也！但事不宜遲，在於速決。”布與肅約於明日來降，肅別去。,"When Bu saw the horse, he was overjoyed, and Xie Su said, ""Brother gave this good horse, what will you do in return?"" Su said, ""Someone came here for the sake of loyalty, how can you expect retribution!"" They arranged wine and treated each other. When the wine was drunk, Su said: ""Su and my wise brother rarely meet each other; your esteemed lord often comes here."" Bu said, ""Brother is drunk! My late father left the world for many years, how can I meet my brother?"" Su laughed loudly and said, """" No: You said that Ding Shi Er is today."" Bu panicked and said, ""Someone is in Ding Jianyang, but also out of helplessness."" Su said: ""My worthy brother has the talent to lift the sky and drive the sea, who is not respected by the world? How can you say that you have no choice but to be under people when you search for things?"" Bu said: ""I wish I could meet the ears of their masters."" Su Xiao said: ""'Good birds choose wood to perch, and worthy ministers choose their masters to do things.' It’s too late to regret.” Bu said: “Brother is in the imperial court, who is the hero of the world?” Su said: “A certain number of ministers are not as good as Dong Zhuo. Great cause."" Bu said: ""Someone wants to follow it, but hates that there is no way out."" The gold beads and jade belts were collected and listed in front of the cloth. Bu was startled and said, ""Why is there this?"" Su Ling hurried back, and announced to Bu, ""This is the name of Duke Dong's long-time mum, and I have specially ordered a certain person to donate it - the red rabbit horse was also given by Duke Dong."" Bu said: ""Dong Gong sees love like this, how can a certain general repay it?"" Su said: ""If a certain person is not talented, he will still be a tiger and a middle-ranking general. Gong, I think of it as a ceremony for entering and seeing."" Su said: ""The power is between the hands, and the public is not willing to listen to it."" Bu thought for a long time and said, ""I want to kill Ding Yuan and lead the army to Dong Zhuo, what should I do?"" Su said: ""If your virtuous brother can do this, it will be a great achievement! But it's not too late, it's about making a quick decision.""","Fording rivers and galloping at mountains Even the very skies part when he comes! Shaking his reins and his gem-studded harness He’s like a fiery dragon Coming down from Heaven itself. Making his way stealthily into the enemy camp, Li Su finds Lü Bu and says to him, ‘You deserve a fine master. The wise bird carefully chooses its branch; the wise servant likewise is careful in the choice of his master.’ And so with silken words and treasures such as Red Hare, Li Su brings Lü Bu over to Dong Zhuo’s side.","Lu Bu was delighted with the horse and said, “What return can I hope to make for such a creature?” “What return can I hope for? I came to you out of a sense of what is right,” replied Li Su. Wine was brought in and they drank. “We have seen very little of each other, but I am constantly meeting your honorable father,” said Li Su. “You are drunk,” said Lu Bu. “My father has been dead for years.” “Not so; I spoke of Ding Yuan, the man of the day.” Lu Bu started. “Yes, I am with him but only because I can do no better.” “Sir, your talent is higher than the heavens, deeper than the seas. Who in all the world does not bow before your name? Fame and riches and honors are yours for the taking. And you say you can do no better than remain a subordinate!” “If I could only find a master to serve!” said Lu Bu. “The clever bird chooses the branch whereon to perch; the wise servant selects the master to serve. Seize the chance when it comes, for repentance ever comes too late.” “Now you are in the government. Who think you is really the bravest of all?”, asked Lu Bu. “I despise the whole lot except Dong Zhuo. He is one who respects wisdom and reveres scholarship; he is discriminating in his rewards and punishments. Surely he is destined to be a really great man.” Lu Bu said, “I wish that I could serve him, but there is no way, I fear.” Then Li Su produced his pearls and gold and the jeweled belt and laid them out before his host. “What is this? What does it mean?” said Lu Bu. “Send away the attendants,” requested Li Su. And he went on, “Dong Zhuo has long respected your valor and sent these by my hand. Red-Hare was also from him.” “But, if he loves me like this, what can I do in return?” Li Su said, “If a stupid fellow like me can be a general in the Imperial Tiger Army, it is impossible to say what honors await you.” “I am sorry I can offer him no service worth mentioning.” Li Su said, “There is one service you can do, and an extremely easy one to perform; but you would not render that.” Lu Bu pondered long in silence, then he said, “I might slay Ding Yuan and bring over his soldiers to Dong Zhuo's side; what think you of that?” “If you would do that, there could be no greater service. But such a thing must be done quickly.” And Lu Bu promised his friend that he would do the deed and come over on the morrow."
却說周瑜、魯肅回寨。肅曰：“都督如何亦許玄德取南郡？”瑜曰：“吾彈指可得南郡，落得虛做人情。”隨問帳下將士：“誰敢先取南郡？”一人應聲而出，乃蔣欽也。瑜曰：“汝為先鋒，徐盛、丁奉為副將，撥五千精銳軍馬，先渡江。吾隨後引兵接應。”,"But Zhou Yu and Lu Su returned to the village. Su said: ""How can the governor also allow Xuande to take Nanjun?"" Yu said: ""I can get Nanjun with a finger, but I will be a fake."" He asked the soldiers under the tent: ""Who dares to take Nanjun first?"" One person came out in response, it was Jiang Qin. Yu said, ""You are the vanguard, Xu Sheng and Ding Feng are the lieutenants, and you will send 5,000 elite troops and horses to cross the river first. I will then lead troops to respond.""","When Zhou Yu leaves, Xuande asks Kong Ming what this is all about. Kong Ming says, ‘Let Zhou do the fighting. We will be sitting inside Nanjun before long!’ As far as Zhou Yu is concerned, his promise is meaningless, as he is now determined to be the one to take Nanjun. So the struggle for the city begins. Zhou Yu sends an advanced party, which is roundly defeated by Cao Ren’s men.","In the meantime Zhou Yu and Lu Su returned to their own camp, and the latter said, “Why did you tell Liu Bei that he might attack Nanjun?” “I can take it with a flick of my finger,” replied Zhou Yu, “but I just manifested a little pretended kindliness.” Then he inquired among his officers for a volunteer to attack the city. Jiang Qin offered himself, and was put in command of the vanguard, with Xu Sheng and Ding Feng as helpers. He was given five thousand of veterans, and they moved across the river. Zhou Yu promised to follow with supports."

却說曹兵十七萬，日費糧食浩大，諸郡及荒旱，接濟不及；操催軍速戰，李豐等閉門不出。操軍相拒月餘，糧食將盡，致書於孫策，借得糧米十萬斛，不敷支散。管糧官任峻部下倉官王垕入稟操曰：“兵多糧少，當如之何？”操曰：“可將小斛散之，權且救一時之急。”垕曰：“兵士倘怨，如何？”操曰：“吾自有策。”垕依命，以小斛分散。操暗使人各寨探聽，無不嗟怨，皆言丞相欺衆。操乃密召王垕入曰：“吾欲問汝借一物，以壓衆心，汝必勿吝。”垕曰：“承相欲用何物？”操曰：“欲借汝頭以示衆耳。”垕大驚曰：“某實無罪！”操曰：“吾亦知汝無罪，但不殺汝，軍必變矣。汝死後，汝妻子吾自養之，汝勿慮也。”垕再欲言時，操早呼刀斧手推出門外一刀斬訖，懸頭高竿，出榜曉示曰：“王垕故行小斛，盜竊官糧，謹按軍法。”於是衆怨始解。,"But they said that Cao's army was 170,000, and the daily cost of food was huge, and the counties and the drought were not enough to help them; Cao's army refused for more than a month, and the food was about to run out, so he sent a letter to Sun Ce, borrowing 100,000 husks of grain and rice, which was not enough to disperse. The grain officer, Ren Jun's subordinate warehouse officer, Wang Hao, came into Cao and said, ""If there are too many soldiers and little grain, what should we do?"" What if there is a complaint?"" Cao said, ""I have a plan of my own."" According to his orders, Xiu scattered with Dendrobium. Cao secretly made people in various villages to listen, all complained, and all said that the prime minister deceived the public. Cao Nai secretly called Wang Cao into him and said, ""I want to ask you to borrow something to suppress people's hearts. You must not be stingy."" Cao said, ""What do you want to use?"" Cao said, ""I want to borrow your head to show it. All ears."" Hao was shocked and said, ""You are not guilty!"" Cao said, ""I also know that you are innocent, but if I don't kill you, the army will change. After you die, your wife will be taken care of by me, so don't worry about it. When Yao was about to speak again, Cao Zao called the knife and axe out of the door and slashed with a knife, hanging his head high on the pole, and appeared on the list, saying: ""Wang Yao is a small dendrobium, stealing official food, and following the military law."" Begin to solve.","Jia Xu has noticed something. He has been watching Cao Cao’s activities. He notices that he is beginning to pay attention to one particular section of the city wall. ‘ He knows,’ says Jia Xu, ‘that the southeastern part of the city wall is weakest. The earth ramparts are crumbling, and the wall is really just wooden stakes. However, he’s also pretending not to have noticed. This is why he has piled up wood and other materials on the northwest side to make it look as if he is planning to attack there.’ ‘So what can we do?’ asks a troubled Zhang Xiu. ‘We can play the same trick on him,’ says Jia Xu. ‘Move your crack troops to the southeast wall and have them hide out of sight, inside houses, down lanes and alleys. Then dress up ordinary folk in armour and have them crowd onto the wall on the northwest side. When Cao Cao attacks what he thinks is the weakest part of the wall on the southeast side and breaks through, we can trap him and his men and annihilate them.’ The trick works.","Cao Cao's army of one hundred seventy thousand needed daily no inconsiderable quantity of food; and as the country around had been famine-stricken for several years, nothing could be got there. So he tried to hasten the military operations and capture the city. On the other hand, the defenders knew the value of delay and simply held on. After a month's vigorous siege, the fall of Shouchun seemed as far off as it was at first, and supplies were very short. Letters were sent to Sun Ce who sent a hundred thousand carts of grain. When the usual distribution became impossible, the Chief of the Commissariat, Ren Jun, and the Controller of the Granaries, Wang Hou, presented a statement asking what was to be done. “Serve out with a smaller measure,” said Cao Cao. “That will save us for a time.” “But if the soldiers murmur, what then?” “I shall have another device.” As ordered the controller issued grain in a short measure. Cao Cao sent secretly to find out how the army took this; and when he found that complaints were general and the soldiers were saying that the Prime Minister was fooling them, he sent a secret summons to the controller. When Wang Hou came, Cao Cao said, “I want to ask you to lend me something to pacify the soldiers with. You must not refuse.” “What does the Prime Minister wish?” “I want the loan of your head to expose to the soldiery.” “But I have done nothing wrong!” exclaimed the unhappy man. “I know that, but if I do not put you to death there will be a mutiny. After you are gone, your wife and children shall be my care. So you need not grieve on their account.” Wang Hou was about to remonstrate further, but Cao Cao gave a signal. The executioners hustled Wang Hou out, and he was beheaded. His head was exposed on a tall pole, and a notice said, “In accordance with military law, Wang Hou had been put to death for peculation and the use of a short measure in issuing grain.” This appeased the discontent."
紹覽檄大喜，卽命使將此檄遍行州郡，並於各處關津隘口張挂。檄文傳至許都，時曹操方患頭風，臥病在牀。左右將此檄傳進，操見之，毛骨悚然，出了一身冷汗，不覺頭風頓愈，從牀上一躍而起，顧謂曹洪曰：“此檄何人所作？”洪曰：“聞是陳琳之筆。”操笑曰：“有文事者，必須以武略濟之。陳琳文事雖佳，其如袁紹武略之不足何！”遂聚衆謀士商議迎敵。,"Shao Lan was overjoyed at the arraignment, and he ordered the arrondissement to be distributed throughout Xingzhou County, and hung up in various Guanjin passes. When the decree spread to Xudu, Cao Cao suffered from head wind and was bedridden. He passed this order to the left and right, and when Cao saw it, he was horrified, broke out in a cold sweat, and the wind suddenly healed. He jumped up from the bed and asked Cao Hong, ""Who did this order?"" Chen Lin's pen."" Cao laughed and said, ""If you have literary affairs, you must use military tactics to help them. Although Chen Lin's literary affairs are good, what's the inadequacy of Yuan Shao's military strategy!""","The document is copied and distributed around the country until eventually, of course, it reaches Cao Cao. He is ill in bed with a migraine but on reading the document he leaps from bed, shaking with anger, and demands to know who has written this. When told it is the scholar Chen Lin he laughs out loud and says, ‘Without an army what is the use of even a great scholar’s pen? Can Chen Lin’s skills in writing make up for Yuan Shao’s weakness in battle?’","He at once ordered copies to be posted everywhere, in towns and cities, at gates, tax stations, ferries, and passes. Copies found their way to the capital, and one got into Cao Cao's palace. That day he happened to be in bed with a bad headache. The servants took the paper to the sick man's room. He read it and was frightened from the tips of his hair to the marrow of his very bones. He broke out into a cold perspiration, and his headache vanished. He bounded out of bed and said to Cao Hong, “Who wrote this?” “They say it is Chen Lin's brush,” replied he. Cao Cao laughed, “They have the literary gift; they would rather have the military too to back it up. This fellow may be a very elegant writer, but what if Yuan Shao's fighting capacity falls short?”"

却說董卓在殿上，回頭不見呂布，心中懷疑，連忙辭了獻帝，登車回府；見布馬繫於府前；問門吏，吏答曰：“温侯入後堂去了。”卓叱退左右，逕入後堂中，尋覓不見；喚貂蟬，蟬亦不見。急問侍妾，侍妾曰：“貂蟬在後園看花。”卓尋入後園，正見呂布和貂蟬在鳳儀亭下共語，畫戟倚在一邊。卓怒，大喝一聲。布見卓至，大驚，回身便走。卓搶了畫戟，挺着趕來。呂布走得快，卓肥胖趕不上，擲戟刺布。布打戟落地。卓拾戟再趕，布已走遠。卓趕出園門，一人飛奔前來，與卓胸膛相撞，卓倒於地。正是：,"But he said that Dong Zhuo was in the palace, and he couldn't see Lü Bu when he looked back. He was suspicious, so he quickly resigned from Emperor Xian and boarded the carriage to return to the mansion. Zhuo Xiu retreated to the left and right, and went straight into the back hall, looking for and not seeing him; calling Diaochan, but the cicada was also not seen. He asked the concubine urgently, and the concubine said, ""Diaochan is looking at flowers in the back garden."" Zhuo Xun entered the back garden and saw Lu Bu and Diaochan talking together under the Fengyi Pavilion, with the painted halberd leaning on the side. Zhuo anger, shouted loudly. Seeing Zhuozhi, Bu was shocked, turned around and left. Zhuo grabbed the halberd and rushed forward. Lu Bu walked so fast that Zhuo Fatty couldn't catch up, so he threw his halberd to stab the cloth. The cloth fell to the ground. Zhuo Shiji rushed again, and Bu was far away. Zhuo drove out of the gate of the garden, and one person rushed forward, collided with Zhuo's chest, and Zhuo fell to the ground. Exactly:","Back at the palace, Dong Zhuo has noticed that Lü Bu is absent. And so, quickly taking his leave of the emperor, he sets off home. When he arrives he sees Lü Bu ’s horse tied up outside and upon questioning the servants hears that his adopted son is inside. Unable to find him, he calls out for Diao Chan. ‘She’s in the Phoenix Garden,’ a maid tells him. Rushing into the garden, Dong Zhuo sees to his horror the two of them locked in an embrace together. He lets out a terrifying roar. Lü Bu spins round when he hears the noise and, seeing it is Dong Zhuo, runs. Dong Zhuo spots the halberd in a corner and hurls it after him. Lü Bu dodges the weapon and keeps running. Dong Zhuo tries to race after him but he is too fat and slow, and Lü Bu is long gone by the time Dong Zhuo charges out of the garden gate and collides with someone who is running into the garden the opposite way. Who on earth can this be?","In the meantime Dong Zhuo missed his henchman, and doubt filled his heart. Hastily taking leave of the Emperor, he mounted his chariot and returned to his palace. There at the gate stood Lu Bu's well known steed Red-Hare, riderless. Dong Zhuo questioned the doorkeepers, and they told him the General was within. He sent away his attendants and went alone to the private apartments. Lu Bu was not there. He called Diao Chan, but there was no reply. He asked where she was, and the waiting maids told him she was in the garden among the flowers. So Dong Zhuo went into the garden, and there he saw the lovers in the pavilion in most tender talk. Lu Bu's trident halberd was leaning on the railing beside him. A howl of rage escaped Dong Zhuo and startled the lovers. Lu Bu turned, saw who it was, and ran away. Dong Zhuo caught up the halberd and ran in pursuit. But Lu Bu was fleet of foot while his master was very stout. Seeing no hope of catching the runaway, Dong Zhuo hurled the halberd. Lu Bu fended it off and it fell to the ground. Dong Zhuo picked it up and ran on. But by this time Lu Bu was far ahead."

却說曹操見典韋殺出去了，四下裏人馬截來，不得出南門；再轉北門，火光裏正撞見呂布挺戟躍馬而來。操以手掩面，加鞭縱馬竟過。呂布從後拍馬趕來，將戟於操盔上一擊，問曰：“曹操何在？”操反指曰：“前面騎黃馬者是他。”呂布聽說，棄了曹操，縱馬向前追趕。曹操撥轉馬頭，望東門而走，正逢典韋。韋擁護曹操，殺條血路，到城門邊，火燄甚盛，城下推下柴草，遍地都是火。韋用戟撥開，飛馬冒煙突火先出。曹操隨後亦出。方到門道邊，城門上崩下一條火梁來，正打着曹操戰馬後胯，那馬撲地倒了。操用手托梁推放地上，手臂鬚髮，盡被燒傷。典韋回馬來救，恰好夏侯淵亦到。兩個同救起曹操，突火而出。操乘淵馬，典韋殺條大路而走。直混戰到天明，操方回寨。,"But they said that Cao Cao saw that Dian Wei was killed, and he was intercepted by people from all over the place, and he could not go out to the south gate; when he turned to the north gate, he saw Lü Bu jumping on his horse with a halberd in the firelight. Use your hands to cover your face, and whip your horse to pass. Lü Bu slapped his horse from behind and struck Cao Cao's helmet with a halberd. He asked, ""Where is Cao Cao?"" chase before. Cao Cao turned his horse's head, looked at the east gate and walked away, just in time to meet Dian Wei. Wei supported Cao Cao, killed a bloody road, and reached the gate of the city, the flames were very strong, the firewood was pushed down from the city, and there was fire everywhere. Wei used the halberd to push aside, and the Pegasus came out first with smoke and fire. Cao Cao followed suit. When Fang arrived at the doorway, a beam of fire collapsed from the city gate. He was hitting the rear crotch of Cao Cao's war horse, and the horse fell to the ground. The operator pushed the hand joist to the ground, his arms were beard and hair, and all were burned. Dian Wei returned to Malaysia to rescue him, just in time for Xiahou Yuan to arrive. The two rescued Cao Cao together and burst out of the fire. Riding the Yuanma, Dian Wei killed the road and walked away. The melee continued until dawn, and the party returned to the village.","Lü Bu rides off in hot pursuit, and Cao Cao turns and rides for his life towards the east gate. As he approaches the east gate, Dian Wei appears beside him and slashes a pathway through the soldiers, creating utter chaos. But just as Cao Cao is riding under the gate a burning wooden beam crashes down upon his horse. Cao Cao tries to fend off the burning beam with his arm but is badly burned in the process. In real pain and shock, he seems about to fall. Once again he is rescued by Dian Wei, who takes control of Cao’s horse, and through the gate they charge to safety. By stages, moving as stealthily as possible, they get beyond the battle scene until at last they are able to make their way back to their camp.","When Cao Cao saw his sturdy protector Dian Wei cut his way out and disappear leaving him surrounded, he again made an attempt to reach the north gate. On the way, sharply outlined against the glow, he saw the figure of Lu Bu coming toward him with his trident halberd ready to kill. Cao Cao covered his face with his hand, whipped up his steed and galloped past. But Lu Bu came galloping up behind him and tapping him on the helmet with the halberd cried, “Where is Cao Cao?” Cao Cao turned and, pointing to a dun horse well ahead, cried, “There; on that dun! That's he.” Hearing this Lu Bu left pursuing Cao Cao to gallop after the rider of the dun. Thus relieved Cao Cao set off for the east gate. Then he fell in with Dian Wei, who took him under his protection and fought through the press, leaving a trail of death behind till they reached the gate. Here the fire was raging fiercely, and burning beams were falling on all sides. The earth element seemed to have interchanged with the fire element. Dian Wei warded off the burning pieces of wood with his lance and rode into the smoke making a way for his lord. Just as they were passing through the gate a flaming beam fell from the gate tower. Cao Cao just warded it off with his arm, but it struck his steed on the quarters and knocked the steed down. Cao Cao's hand and arm were badly burned and his hair and beard singed. Dian Wei turned back to his rescue. Luckily Xiahou Yuan came along just then, and the two raised Cao Cao and set him on Xiahou Yuan's horse. And thus they got him out of the burning city. But they had to go through heavy fighting till daybreak. Cao Cao returned to his camp."
却說周瑜引衆將立於山頂，遙望江北水面艨艟戰船，排合江上，旗幟號帶，皆有次序；回看文聘與韓當、周泰相持。韓當、周泰奮力攻擊，文聘抵敵不住，回船而走。韓、周二人，急催船追趕。周瑜恐二人深入重地，便將白旗招颭，令衆鳴金。二人乃揮棹而回。周瑜於山頂看隔江戰船，盡入水寨。瑜顧謂衆將曰：“江北戰船，如蘆葦之密；操又多謀；當用何計以破之？”衆未及對，忽見曹軍寨中，被風吹折中央黃旗，飄入江中。瑜大笑曰：“此不祥之兆也！”正觀之際，忽狂風大作，江中波濤拍岸。一陣風過，刮起旗角於周瑜臉上拂過。瑜猛然想起一事在心，大叫一聲，往後便倒，口吐鮮血。諸將急救起時，却早不省人事。正是：,"However, it was said that Zhou Yu led the generals to stand on the top of the mountain, and looked at the warships on the north of the river, lined up on the river, and the flags and numbers were all in order; looking back at Wen Ping, Han Dang and Zhou Tai stalemate. Han Dang and Zhou Tai attacked hard, but Wen Ping couldn't stand the enemy, so they returned to the boat and left. Han and Tuesday people hurriedly urged the boat to catch up. Zhou Yu was afraid that the two would go deep into the heavy ground, so he hoisted the white flag, causing everyone to shout gold. The two waved back. Zhou Yu watched the warships across the river from the top of the mountain, all entering the water village. Yu Gu said to the generals, ""The warships in the north of the Yangtze River are like the dense reeds; they are tricky and resourceful; what strategies should be used to break them?"" into the river. Yu laughed loudly and said, ""This is an ominous omen!"" Just as he was watching, there was a sudden gust of wind, and waves in the river crashed against the shore. A gust of wind blew, and the horn of the flag blew across Zhou Yu's face. Yu suddenly remembered something on her mind, shouted, fell backwards, and vomited blood. When the generals were rescued, they were already unconscious. Exactly:","Watching the huge armada sailing down upon them, Zhou Yu’s commanders ask him how they are to confront such a vast horde. Suddenly they are all pointing at the great ship in which Cao Cao is sailing. The huge yellow banner’s pole has snapped, and the great flag comes crashing down. Not a good sign, as they all agree, but then something else unexpected happens. A strong wind arises and whips Zhou Yu’s standard into his face. A foreboding comes into his mind, and with a loud cry he collapses, blood pouring from his mouth. His men rush to him, but he is unconscious.","Zhou Yu with his officers stood on the summit of a mountain and watched his own and the enemy ships out on the river. The flags and the ensigns were all in perfect order. Then he saw Wen Ping and his own fleets engaged in battle, and soon it was evident that the former was not a match for his own sailors. Wen Ping turned about to retire, Han Dang and Zhou Tai pursued. Zhou Yu fearing lest his sailors should go too far, then hoisted the white flag of recall. To his officers Zhou Yu said, “The masts of the northern ships stand thick as reeds; Cao Cao himself is full of wiles; how can we destroy him?” No one replied, for just then the great yellow flag that flapped in the breeze in the middle of Cao Cao's fleet suddenly fell over into the river. Zhou Yu laughed. “That is a bad omen,” said he. Then an extra violent blast of wind came by, and the waves rose high and beat upon the bank. A corner of his own flag flicked Zhou Yu on the cheek, and suddenly a thought flashed through his mind. Zhou Yu uttered a loud cry, staggered, and fell backward. They picked him up; there was blood upon his lips, and he was unconscious. Presently, however, he revived."
張昭知孫權欲興兵，遂與衆議曰：“中了孔明之計也！”急入見權曰：“昭等聞主公將興兵與曹操爭鋒。主公自思比袁紹若何？曹操向日兵微將寡，尚能一鼓克袁紹；何況今日擁百萬之衆南征，豈可輕敵？若聽諸葛亮之言，妄動甲兵，此所謂負薪救火也。”孫權只低頭不語。顧雍曰：“劉備因為曹操所敗，故欲借我江東之兵以拒之，主公奈何為其所用乎？願聽子布之言。”孫權沈吟未決。張昭等出，魯肅入見曰：“適張子布等，又勸主公休動兵，力主降議，此皆全軀保妻子之臣，為自謀之計耳。願主公勿聽也。”孫權尚在沈吟。肅曰：“主公若遲疑，必為衆人誤矣。”權曰：“卿且暫退，容我三思。”肅乃退出。時武將或有要戰的，文官都是要降的，議論紛紛不一。,"Zhang Zhao knew that Sun Quan wanted to raise troops, so he said to the crowd, ""You have hit Kong Ming's plan!"" He rushed to see Quan and said, ""Zhao et al have heard that your lord will raise an army to fight against Cao Cao. How is your lord thinking better than Yuan Shao? If you listen to Zhuge Liang's words and move armored soldiers rashly, this is what is called fighting the fire with a salary."" Sun Quan just lowered his head and said nothing. Gu Yong said: ""Because Liu Bei was defeated by Cao Cao, he wanted to borrow my troops from Jiangdong to reject him. How could the lord use it for him? I would like to hear what Zibu has to say."" Sun Quan pondered. When Zhang Zhao and others left, Lu Su came in and said: ""It is appropriate to Zhang Zibu and others, who also persuaded the lord to suspend the army and force the lord to surrender. These are all ministers who protect their wives with their whole bodies, and they are their own plans. I hope the lord will not listen. ""Sun Quan was still groaning. Su said, ""If your lord hesitates, you will be mistaken for everyone."" Quan said, ""Your Excellency, please retreat for a while, please allow me to think twice."" Su Nai withdrew. When the military generals may want to fight, the civil officials are all about to surrender, and there are different discussions.","At these words, all Sun Quan’s doubts disappear, and he finally agrees to join Xuande in confronting Cao Cao.","When Zhang Zhao heard of the decision he met his colleagues and said to them, “Our master has fallen into the trap set by this Zhuge Liang.” They went in a body to their lord and said, “We hear you are going to attack Cao Cao; but how do you stand when compared with Yuan Shao? In those days Cao Cao was comparatively weak, and yet he overcame. What is he like today with his countless legions? He is not to be lightly attacked, and to listen to Zhuge Liang's advice to engage in a conflict is like carrying fuel to a fire.” Sun Quan made no reply, and Gu Yong took up the argument. Gu Yong said, “Liu Bei has been defeated, and he wants to borrow our help to beat his enemy. Why must our lord lend himself to his schemes? Pray listen to our leader's words.” Doubts again surged up in the mind of Sun Quan. When the troop of advisers had retired, Lu Su came in, saying, “They came to exhort you not to fight, but to compel you to surrender simply because they wish to secure the safety of their families. They distort their sense of duty to serve their own ends, and I hope you will not take their advice.” Sun Quan being sunk in thought and saying nothing, Lu Su went on, “If you hesitate, you will certainly be led astray by the majority and—” “Retire for a time,” said his master. “I must think it over carefully.” So Lu Su left the chamber. Among the soldiers some wished for war, but of the civil officers, all were in favor of surrender; and so there were many discussions and much conflict of opinion."
幹思曰：“原來蔡瑁、張允結連東吳！……”遂將書暗藏於衣內。再欲檢看他書時，牀上周瑜翻身，幹急滅燈就寢。瑜口內含糊曰：“子翼，我數日之內，敎你看曹賊之首！”幹勉強應之。瑜又曰：“子翼，且住！……敎你看曹賊之首！……”及幹問之，瑜又睡着。幹伏於牀上，將近四更，只聽得有人入帳喚曰：“都督醒否？”周瑜夢中做忽覺之狀，故問那人曰：“牀上睡着何人？”答曰：“都督請子翼同寢，何故忘却？”瑜懊悔曰：“吾平日未嘗飲醉；昨日醉後失事，不知可曾說甚言語？”那人曰：“江北有人到此。”瑜喝：“低聲！”便喚：“子翼。”蔣幹只妝睡着。瑜潛出帳。幹竊聽之，只聞有人在外曰：“張、蔡二都督道：‘急切不得下手。’……”後面言語頗低，聽不眞實。少頃，瑜入帳，又喚：“子翼。”蔣幹只是不應，蒙頭假睡。瑜亦解衣就寢。幹尋思：“周瑜是個精細人，天明尋書不見，必然害我。”睡至五更，幹起喚周瑜；瑜却睡着。幹戴上巾幘，潛步出帳，喚了小童，逕出轅門。軍士問：“先生那裏去？”幹曰：“吾在此恐誤都督事，權且告別。”軍士亦不阻當。,"Gan Si said, ""It turns out that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are connected to Soochow!..."" Then he hid the book in his clothes. When he was about to read his book again, Zhou Yu rolled over on the bed and hurriedly turned off the lights to go to bed. Yu said vaguely, ""Ziyi, within a few days, I will teach you to see the leader of Cao's thieves!"" Gan reluctantly responded. Yu said again, ""Ziyi, stay here!...I'll teach you to see the leader of Cao's thief!..."" After asking him, Yu fell asleep again. Gan crouched on the bed, nearly four watch, only to hear someone entering the tent and calling, ""Is the governor awake?"" Zhou Yu was suddenly awake in a dream, so he asked the man, ""Who is sleeping on the bed?"" The answer was: ""The governor asked Ziyi to sleep together, why did he forget?"" Yu said regretfully, ""I have never been drunk on weekdays; ""Whisper!"" Then he called, ""Ziyi."" Jiang Gan only fell asleep. Yu sneaked out of the tent. When I was eavesdropping, I only heard someone outside saying: ""Second Governor Zhang and Cai said: 'I can't start in a hurry.'..."" The words behind him were rather low, and he couldn't hear the truth. After a while, Yu entered the tent and called again: ""Ziyi."" Jiang Gan just didn't respond, and slept with his head covered. Yu also undressed and went to bed. Gan Xunsi: ""Zhou Yu is a delicate person. If I can't find the book in the morning, it will definitely hurt me."" Sleeping until the fifth watch, Gan wakes up Zhou Yu, but Yu falls asleep. Gan put on the towel, sneaked out of the tent, called the child, and walked out of the gate. The sergeant asked, ""Where are you going, sir?"" Gan said, ""I'm afraid I'll make a mistake here, so let's say goodbye."" The sergeant didn't stop him either.","As the evening draws to a close, Zhou Yu, now apparently the worse for wear through drink, invites Jiang Gan to come and sleep in his tent. But his apparent drunken state is a ruse. Pretending to be sleeping deeply, Zhou Yu snores reassuringly. This encourages Jiang Gan, who has quickly realized during the evening that he has no hope of persuading Zhou Yu to change sides. So he takes the opportunity to explore what is lying around in the tent. He soon discovers a letter which appears to come from Cai Mao and Zhang Yun. In the letter they say they were forced into serving Cao Cao. However, as a result and through deceit and cunning, they are now within reach of striking and killing Cao Cao, whose head they will deliver to Zhou Yu. Jiang Gan steals the letter, realizing that, even if he will not be forgiven for failing to bring Zhou Yu over to Cao Cao’s side, this letter with its explosive revelations will gain him Cao Cao’s approval. After a fraught night of anxiety, fearful that Zhou Yu will wake or notice that the letter has gone, Jiang Gan slips away in the early morning and makes good his escape. Arriving back at Cao Cao’s camp, he goes directly to Cao Cao, where he has to confess that Zhou Yu will not change sides.","“Those two were connected with the South Land in the beginning,” thought Jiang Gan, so he secreted the letter in his dress and began to examine the others. But at that moment Zhou Yu turned over, and so Jiang Gan hastily blew out the light and went to his couch. Zhou Yu was muttering as he lay there as if dreaming, saying, “Friend, I am going to let you see Cao Cao's head in a day or two.” Jiang Gan hastily made some reply to load on his host to say more. Then came, “Wait a few days; you will see Cao Cao's head. The old wretch!” Jiang Gan tried to question him as to what he meant, but Zhou Yu was fast asleep and seemed to hear nothing. Jiang Gan lay there on his couch wide awake till the fourth watch was beating. Then some one came in, saying, “General, are you awake?” At that moment as if suddenly awakened from the deepest slumber, Zhou Yu started up and said, “Who is this on the couch?” The voice replied, “Do you not remember, General? You asked your old friend to stay the night with you; it is he, of course.” “I drank too much last night,” said Zhou Yu in a regretful tone, “and I forgot. I seldom indulge to excess and am not used to it. Perhaps I said many things I ought not.” The voice went on, “A man has arrived from the north.” “Speak lower,” said Zhou Yu, and turning toward the sleeper, he called him by name. But Jiang Gan affected to be sound asleep and made no sign. Zhou Yu crept out of the tent, while Jiang Gan listened with all his ears. He heard the man say, “Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, the two commanders, have come.” But listening as he did with straining ears, he could not make out what followed. Soon after Zhou Yu reentered and again called out his companion's name. But no reply came, for Jiang Gan was pretending to be in the deepest slumber and to hear nothing. Then Zhou Yu undressed and went to bed. As Jiang Gan lay awake, he remembered that Zhou Yu was known to be meticulously careful in affairs, and if in the morning Zhou Yu found that a letter had disappeared, he would certainly slay the offender. So Jiang Gan lay there till near daylight and then called out to his host. Getting no reply, he rose, dressed, and stole out of the tent. Then he called his servant and made for the camp gate. “Whither are you going, Sir?” said the watchmen at the gate. “I fear I am in the way here,” replied Jiang Gan, “and so I have taken leave of the Commander-in-Chief for a time. So do not stop me.”"

且說袁紹在冀州，聞知曹操與呂布相持，謀士審配進曰：“呂布，豺虎也：若得兗州，必圖冀州。不若助操攻之，方可無患。”紹遂遣顏良將兵五萬，往助曹操。細作探知這個消息，飛報呂布。布大驚，與陳宮商議。宮曰：“聞劉玄德新領徐州，可往投之。”布從其言，竟投徐州來。有人報知玄德。玄德曰：“布乃當今英勇之士，可出迎之。”糜竺曰：“呂布乃虎狼之徒，不可收留；收則傷人矣。”玄德曰：“前者非布襲兗州，怎解此郡之禍？今彼窮而投我，豈有他心？”張飛曰：“哥哥心腸忒好。雖然如此，也要準備。”,"Let’s say that Yuan Shao was in Jizhou, and he heard that Cao Cao and Lü Bu were stalemate, and his counsellor Shen Peijin said: “Lü Bu, Jackal Tiger: If you get Yanzhou, you must go to Jizhou. If you don’t help Cao to attack it, then you will be safe.” Shao then sent Yan Liang. 50,000 soldiers were sent to help Cao Cao. Make careful work to find out the news, and report it to Lu Bu. Bu was shocked and discussed with Chen Gong. The palace said: ""I heard that Liu Xuande was newly leading Xuzhou, so he can go to cast it."" Bu followed his words and went to Xuzhou. Someone reported to Xuande. Xuande said: ""Bu is a heroic man of today, and he can go out to meet him."" Mi Zhu said, ""Lu Bu is a disciple of tigers and wolves, and he cannot be taken in; if he takes it in, he will hurt people."" Xuande said: ""The former is not to attack Yanzhou, how can it be? Solve the disaster in this county? Now that he is poor and casts for me, does he have any heart?"" Zhang Fei said, ""Brother has a very good heart. Even so, be prepared.""","In desperation Lü Bu turns for help first to Yuan Shao, but he refuses and instead goes to support Cao Cao. So Lü Bu turns to Xuande. As it was Lü Bu’s attack on Cao Cao’s army that caused the siege of Xuzhou to be lifted, Xuande offers him sanctuary. Not that this pleases Zhang Fei, to put it mildly.","The news of the fighting between Cao Cao and Lu Bu had reached Jizhou, and one of Yuan Shao's advisers, Shen Pei, warned him, saying, “Lu Bu is a savage beast. If he gets possession of Yanzhou, he will certainly attempt to add this region to it. For your own safety you should help to crush him.” Wherefore Yuan Shao sent Yan Liang with fifty thousand troops to destroy Lu Bu. The spies heard this and at once told Lu Bu, who was greatly disturbed and called in Chen Gong. “Go over to Liu Bei, who has lately succeeded to Xuzhou.” Hence Lu Bu went thither. Hearing this, Liu Bei said, “Lu Bu is a hero, and we will receive him with honor.” But Mi Zhu was strongly against receiving him, saying, “He was a cruel, bloodthirsty beast.” But Liu Bei replied, “How would misfortune have been averted from Xuzhou if he had not attacked Yanzhou? He cannot be our enemy now that he comes seeking an asylum.” “Brother, your heart is really too good. Although it may be as you say, yet it would be well to prepare,” said Zhang Fei."
畢竟袁紹性命如何，且聽下文分解。,"After all, how is Yuan Shao's life, let's hear the breakdown below.",And what happens next to Yuan Shao?,The fate of Yuan Shao will be disclosed in later chapters.
却說玄德在袁紹處，旦夕煩惱。紹曰：“玄德何故常憂？”玄德曰：“二弟不知音耗，妻小陷於曹賊；上不能報國，下不能保家，安得不憂？”紹曰：“吾欲進兵赴許都久矣。方今春煖，正好興兵。”便商議破曹之策。田豐諫曰：“前操攻徐州，許都空虛，不及此時進兵；今徐州已破，操兵方銳，未可輕敵。不如以久持之，待其有隙而後可動也。”紹曰：“待我思之。”因問玄德曰：“田豐勸我固守，何如？”玄德曰：“曹操欺君之賊，明公若不討之，恐失大義於天下。”紹曰：“玄德之言甚善。”遂欲興兵。田豐又諫。紹怒曰：“汝等弄文輕武，使我失大義！”田豐頓首曰：“若不聽臣良言，出師不利。”紹大怒，欲斬之。玄德力勸，乃囚於獄中。沮授見田豐下獄，乃會其宗族，盡散家財，與之訣曰：“吾隨軍而去，勝則威無不加，敗則一身不保矣！”衆皆下淚送之。,"But he said that Xuande was at Yuan Shao's place, and he was troubled every day. Shao said, ""Why is Xuande always worried?"" Xuande said, ""Second brother doesn't know the sound consumption, and his wife and children are trapped in Cao's thieves; I can't serve the country above, and I can't protect my family below, so don't worry about peace?"" Shao said, ""I want to go into the army. It’s been a long time since I’ve been to Xudu. It’s warm in the spring, and it’s time to start the army.” Then they discussed the strategy of breaking Cao Cao. Tian Feng admonished: ""The previous attack on Xuzhou, Xudu was empty, and it was not enough to advance the army at this time; now Xuzhou has been broken, and the army is sharp, and the enemy can't be underestimated. It is better to hold on for a long time and wait until there is a gap before moving."" Shao said ""Wait for me to think about it."" Because he asked Xuande, ""Tian Feng advised me to stick to it, what should I do?"" Xuande said: ""Cao Cao is a thief who deceives the king. Said: ""Xuande's words are very good."" Then he wanted to raise troops. Tian Feng remonstrated again. Shao said angrily, ""You have made me lose the righteousness of your martial arts!"" Tian Feng nodded and said, ""If you don't listen to the good words of your ministers, it will not be good for you to be a teacher."" Shao was furious and wanted to kill him. Xuande persuaded, but was imprisoned in prison. When Ju Shou saw that Tian Feng was in prison, he gathered his clan, scattered his family wealth, and said to him, ""I will go with the army. If I win, I will increase my power, and if I lose, I will lose my whole body!"" Everyone sent him in tears.","Meanwhile, Xuande is safe with Yuan Shao but in great distress. He is desperately worried about what might have happened to his two brothers. And having had no news other than their capture by Cao Cao, he is also anxious about the well-being of his family. When spring comes the two leaders agree it is time to go to war. They decide to attack the capital despite some speaking-out against this and predicting doom and failure.","Liu Bei went to Yuan Shao for refuge. Here Liu Bei was always sorrowful and, when asked the reason, said he did not know where his brothers were nor what had happened to his family since they fell into the hands of Cao Cao. “Why should I not be sad when I have failed towards my country and my family?” said he. “I have long wished to attack Xuchang,” said Yuan Shao. “Now it is autumn and just the time for an expedition, so let us discuss plans for the destruction of Cao Cao.” Tian Feng at once opposed this. “When Cao Cao attacked Xuzhou and Xuchang was undefended, you let the chance slip by. Now that Xuzhou has been captured, and their soldiers are flushed with victory, it would be madness to attempt it. It is necessary to await another chance.” “Let me think about it,” said Yuan Shao. He asked advice from Liu Bei whether to attack or to hold on. Liu Bei replied, “Cao Cao is a rebel. I think you are failing in your duty if you do not attack him.” “Your words are good,” said Yuan Shao. He made up his mind to move. But again the adviser Tian Feng intervened. Then Yuan Shao grew angry, saying, “You fellows who cultivate literature and despise war have made me miss a lot!” Tian Feng bowed his head and said, “Neglect your servant's wise words, and you will fail in the field.” Yuan Shao was so angry that he wanted to put Tian Feng to death. However, Liu Bei begged him off and he was only imprisoned. Seeing the fate of his colleague, another adviser, Ju Shou, assembled his clan and distributed among them all his possessions, saying, “I go with the army. If we succeed, then nothing can exceed our glory, but if we are defeated, the risk I run is great.” His friends wept as they said farewell."
曹操收軍回營，滿寵引徐晃入見。操大喜，厚待之。於是迎鑾駕到許都，蓋造宮室殿宇，立宗廟社稷、省臺司院衙門，修城郭府庫；封董承等十三人為列侯。賞功罰罪，並聽曹操處置。操自封為大將軍武平侯，以荀彧為侍中尚書令，荀攸為軍師，郭嘉為司馬祭酒，劉曄為司空掾曹，毛玠、任峻為典農中郎將：催督錢糧，程昱為東平相，范成、董昭為洛陽令，滿寵為許都令，夏侯惇、夏侯淵、曹仁、曹洪皆為將軍，呂虔、李典、樂進、于禁、徐晃皆為校尉，許褚、典韋皆為都尉；其餘將士，各各封官。自此大權皆歸於曹操：朝廷大務，先稟曹操，然後方奏天子。,"Cao Cao withdrew his army and returned to the camp, and Man Chong led Xu Huang to see him. Overjoyed, treat him favorably. So Yingluan drove to Xudu, built palaces and palaces, established ancestral temples, shrines, and yamen of provincial Taisiyuan, and repaired the city and Guo's treasury; thirteen people such as Dong Cheng were enthroned as marquis. Reward and punish crimes, and listen to Cao Cao's disposal. Cao proclaimed himself the Marquis of Wu Ping, the general, with Xun Yu as the minister of the central minister, Xun You as the military advisor, Guo Jia as the wine sacrifice to Sima, Liu Ye as the Sikong Cao, Mao Jie and Ren Jun as the Dian Nong Zhong Lang: urging money and grain , Cheng Yu is the minister of Dongping, Fan Cheng and Dong Zhao are the commanders of Luoyang, Man Chong is the commander of Xu Du, Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Cao Ren, and Cao Hong are all generals, and Lu Qian, Li Dian, Le Jin, Yu Jin, and Xu Huang are all commanders. The commanders, Xu Chu and Dian Wei were all commanders; the rest of the officers and men were appointed officials. Since then, all the power has been attributed to Cao Cao: the important affairs of the court are reported to Cao Cao first, and then to the emperor.","Once settled in Xuchang, Cao Cao has increasing control over the emperor. But he is troubled by Xuande and Lü Bu. ‘Xuande has taken up residence in Xuzhou and has the province in his power,’ he says, ‘and now Lü Bu has gone to join him and has taken up residence in Xiaopei.","When Cao Cao returned to camp, the newly surrendered general was presented and well received. Then again the cavalcade set out for the new capital. In due time they reached Xuchang, and they built palaces and halls, an ancestral temple and an altar, terraces and public offices. The walls were repaired, storehouses built and all put in order. Then came the rewards for Cao Cao's adherents and others. Dong Cheng and thirteen others were raised to rank of lordship. All good service was rewarded; certain others again, who deserved it, were punished, all according to Cao Cao's sole decision. He himself was made Prime Minister, Regent Marshal, and Lord of Wuping. Xun Yu was made Imperial Counselor and Chair of the Secretariat; Xun You, Minister of War; Guo Jia, Minister of Rites and Religion; Liu Ye, Minister of Works; Mao Jie, Minister of Agriculture, and together with Ren Jun, they were put over the military stores. Cheng Yu was appointed Lord of Dongping; Dong Zhao, Magistrate of Luoyang; Man Chong, Magistrate of Xuchang.

次日，操自選馬步軍士五千，準備往烏巢劫糧。張遼曰：“袁紹屯糧之所，安得無備？丞相未可輕往。恐許攸有詐。”操曰：“不然：許攸此來，天敗袁紹。今吾軍糧不給，難以久持；若不用許攸之計，是坐而待困也。彼若有詐，安肯留我寨中？且吾亦欲劫寨久矣。今劫糧之舉，計在必行，君請勿疑。”遼曰：“亦須防袁紹乘虛來襲。”操笑曰：“吾已籌之熟矣。”便敎荀攸、賈詡、曹洪同許攸守大寨，夏侯惇、夏侯淵領一軍伏於左，曹仁、李典領一軍伏於右，以備不虞。敎張遼、許褚在前，徐晃、于禁在後，操自引諸將居中：共五千人馬，打着袁軍旗號，軍士皆束草負薪，人銜枚，馬勒口，黃昏時分，望烏巢進發。是夜星光滿天。,"The next day, Cao self-selected 5,000 sergeants in horses and prepared to go to Wuchao to rob food. Zhang Liao said: ""The place where Yuan Shao is stockpiling food is unprepared? The prime minister is not ready to go there lightly. I am afraid that Xu You will be deceived."" If you don't use Xu You's plan, you will be sitting and waiting for sleepiness. If he is deceitful, will he be able to stay in my village? And I also want to rob the village for a long time. The plan for the robbery of food is a must, please don't. Doubtful."" Liao said, ""We must also guard against Yuan Shao's attack."" Cao laughed and said, ""I have already prepared it."" He then ordered Xun You, Jia Xu, and Cao Hong to guard the Dazhai with Xu You, and Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan led an army to fall on the left. , Cao Ren and Li Dian led an army to lie down on the right, just in case. Zhang Liao and Xu Chu were in the front, Xu Huang and Yu Jin were in the back, and Cao Zi cited the generals in the middle: a total of 5,000 men and horses, under the banner of the Yuan army, the sergeants were all paid to the grass, with a number of rank, Mahlerkou, and at dusk, watch Wuchao set off. It's a starry night.","whereupon Xu You shows the captured letter. ‘So what can I do now?’ asks Cao Cao. ‘Yuan Shao’s supplies are all at Wuchao, and that old drunkard Chunyu Qiong is in charge. Lead a crack troop of your men down there. Pretend you are Jiang Qi, who has just been commissioned to protect the supplies. Get inside and destroy the grain.","Forthwith he chose five thousand of horse and foot ready for the expedition. Zhang Liao protested, saying, “The enterprise will be futile as the grain depot will certainly be well guarded. Without caution, we may be victims of the treachery on the part of the newly arrived Xu You.” “Xu You is no traitor,” said Cao Cao. “He has come sent by Heaven to defeat Yuan Shao. If we do not get grain, it will be hard to hold out; and I have either to follow his advice or sit still and be hemmed in. If he were a traitor, he would hardly remain in my camp. Moreover this raid has been my desire for a long time. Have no doubts; the raid will certainly succeed.” “Well, then, you must look out for an attack here while the camp is undefended.” “That is already well provided for,” said Cao Cao gleefully. The arrangements for the raid on the grain depot were made with extreme care to ensure success. Cao Cao assigned Xun You, Jia Xu, and Cao Hong to guard the main camp, together with Xu You; Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan to guard the left camp; Cao Ren and Li Dian to guard the right camp. When all was ready they set out, Cao Cao himself in the center, with Zhang Liao and Xu Chu as van leaders and Xu Huang and Yu Jin as rear guard. The army showed the ensigns of their opponents. The troops carried bundles of grass and faggots to make a blaze. The soldiers were gagged and the horses tied round the muzzles so as to prevent any noise. They set out at dusk. The night was fine and the stars shone brightly."

玄德正憂悶間，忽報公子劉琦差伊籍到來。玄德感伊籍昔日相救之恩，降階迎之，再三稱謝。籍曰：“大公子在江夏，聞荊州已故，蔡夫人與蔡瑁等商議，不來報喪，竟立劉琮為主。公子差人往襄陽探聽，回說是實；恐使君不知，特差某齎哀書呈報，並求使君盡起麾下精兵，同往襄陽問罪。”玄德看書畢，謂伊籍曰：“機伯只知劉琮僭立，更不知劉琮已將荊襄九郡，獻與曹操矣！”籍大驚曰：“使君從何知之？”玄德具言拿獲宋忠之事。籍曰：“若如此，使君不如以弔喪為名，前赴襄陽，誘劉琮出迎，就便擒下，誅其黨類，則荊州屬使君矣。”孔明曰：“機伯之言是也。主公可從之。”玄德垂淚曰：“吾兄臨危託孤於我，今若執其子而奪其地，異日死於九泉之下，何面目復見吾兄乎？”孔明曰：“如不行此事，今曹兵已至宛城，何以拒敵？”玄德曰：“不如走樊城以避之。”,"While Xuande was feeling depressed, he suddenly reported that his son Liu Qi had arrived from Iraq. Xuande was grateful to Yi Ji for saving him in the past, so he stepped down to welcome him, and thanked him again and again. Ji said: ""The eldest son was in Jiangxia, and when he heard that Jingzhou had passed away, Mrs. Cai discussed with Cai Mao and others, and did not come to report the funeral, but instead appointed Liu Cong as the chief. The son sent people to Xiangyang to investigate, and he replied that it was true; Send a letter of mourning to report, and ask the monarch to mobilize all the elite troops under his command and go to Xiangyang to inquire about the crime."" After reading the book, Xuande said to Yiji, ""Uncle Ji only knew that Liu Cong was arrogant, and he didn't even know that Liu Cong had sent Jingxiang to the nine counties. Now, present it to Cao Cao!"" Ji was shocked and said, ""How did you know about it?"" Xuande made a statement about the acquisition of Song Zhong. Ji said: ""If this is the case, it would be better for the emperor to go to Xiangyang in the name of mourning, and lure Liu Cong to greet him, then he will be captured and his party members will be executed, then Jingzhou will belong to the envoy."" It is true. The lord can follow it.” Xuande wept and said: “My brother was in danger and left me alone, but now if he takes his son and seizes his land, and he will die under the Jiuquan in the future, how can he see my brother again? Kong Ming said, ""If you can't do this, Cao's army has already reached Wancheng. Why should you resist the enemy?"" Xuande said, ""It's better to go to Fancheng to avoid it.""","Brought before Xuande, the captured messenger confesses all, showing Xuande the letter. This reduces Xuande to tears at such a betrayal. Following Kong Ming’s advice, Xuande decides to retreat to the city of Fan. Xuande is a man of honour and virtue. He realizes that he cannot simply abandon the people who have followed him or the people in Xinye who rely upon him for protection. He decides he must move all the ordinary folk, who have faithfully followed him, out of Xinye and across the river to the safety of Fan. This is a huge undertaking and makes them all vulnerable to attack. So Xuande and Kong Ming sit down to plan how to hold back the army of Cao Cao, which is almost upon them, encamped at Bowang nearby, while the people are helped to escape.","Liu Bei was very sad. Presently Yi Ji from Jiangxia was announced. Liu Bei was very fond of this man and went down the steps to welcome him. Then said Yi Ji, “The heir has heard that his father is dead, but his stepmother and her family are keeping back the news so that they may set up Liu Zong. He knows the news is true, as he sent a special messenger to find out. He thinks you, O Prince, may not know and has sent me to inform you, and his letter begs you to lead all the troops you can to Xiangyang to help him assert his claims.” Liu Bei opened and read the letter. Then he said, “Yes; you know that the younger son has usurped the lordship, but you have not heard that he has already sent to offer Jingzhou to Cao Cao.” This news shocked Yi Ji, who asked, “How know you this?” Liu Bei told of the capture of Song Zhong. Yi Ji said, “You can go to Xiangyang as if to attend the mourning ceremonies and so draw Liu Zong into coming out of the city to welcome you. Then you can seize him, slay his party, and take the region.” “Your advice is good,” said Zhuge Liang, “and my lord ought to take it.” Liu Bei wept, saying, “In his last interview, my brother confided his son and heir to my care. If I lay hands upon another son and seize upon the inheritance, how shall I be able to look my brother in the face when I meet him by and by beyond the grave?” “If you do not act in this way now, how will you repel Cao Cao, who has already reached Wancheng?” said Zhuge Liang. “Our best plan is to take refuge in Fankou,” replied Liu Bei."

譚從其言，問曰：“何人可為使？”圖曰：“辛評之弟辛毗，字佐治，見為平原令。此人乃能言之士，可命為使。”譚卽召辛毗。毗欣然而至。譚修書付毗，使三千軍送毗出境。毗星夜齎書往見曹操。時操屯軍西平伐劉表，表遣玄德引兵為前部以迎之。未及交鋒，辛毗到操寨。見操禮畢，操問其來意，毗具言袁譚相求之意，呈上書信。操看書畢，留辛毗於寨中，聚文武計議。程昱曰：“袁譚被袁尚攻擊太急，不得已而來降，不可准信。”呂虔、滿寵亦曰：“丞相旣引兵至此，安可復舍表而助譚？”荀攸曰：“三公之言未善。以愚意度之：天下方有事，而劉表坐保江、漢之間，不敢展足，其無四方之志可知矣；袁氏據四州之地，帶甲數十萬，若二子和睦，共守成業，天下事未可知也；今乘其兄弟相攻，勢窮而投我，我提兵先除袁尚，後觀其變，并滅袁譚，天下定矣。此機會不可失也。”操大喜，便邀辛毗飲酒，謂之曰：“袁譚之降，眞耶詐耶？袁尚之兵，果可必勝耶？”毗對曰：“明公勿問眞與詐也，只論其勢可耳。袁氏連年喪敗，兵革疲於外，謀臣誅於內；兄弟讒隙，國分為二；加之饑饉並臻，天災人困：無問智愚，皆知土崩瓦解。此乃天滅袁氏之時也。今明公提兵攻鄴，袁尚不還救，則失巢穴；若還救，則譚踵襲其後。以明公之威，擊疲憊之衆，如迅風之掃秋葉也。不此之圖，而伐荊州，荊州豐樂之地，國和民順，未可搖動。況四方之患，莫大於河北。河北旣平，則霸業成矣：願明公詳之。”操大喜曰：“恨與辛佐治相見之晚也！”卽日督軍還取冀州。玄德恐操有謀，不敢追襲，引兵自回荊州。,"Tan followed his words and asked, ""Who can be an envoy?"" The picture said: ""Xin Ping's younger brother Xin Pi, whose name is Zuozhi, is seen as a plaintiff. This person is a man who can speak and can be appointed as an envoy."" Tan Yu called Xin. adjoin. Bixin came. Tan Xiushu paid Pi and ordered three thousand troops to send Pi out of the country. Pi Xingye went to see Cao Cao with a book. At that time, Cao's army in Xiping attacked Liu Biao, and Biao dispatched Xuande to lead troops as the front to welcome him. Before the confrontation, Xin Pi went to Cao Village. Seeing that the ceremony was over, Cao asked him about his intentions, and Pi expressed the intention of Yuan Tan's request, and submitted a letter. After Cao finished reading the book, he left Xin Pi in the village, and gathered together to discuss civil and military plans. Cheng Yu said, ""Yuan Tan was attacked too quickly by Yuan Shang, so he had to come down and surrender, so we cannot be trusted."" Lu Qian and Man Chong also said, ""The prime minister has led troops here, can you please give up the watch and help Tan?"" Xun You said: ""The words of the three princes are not good. I use my foolishness to deal with them: there is something in the sky, and Liu Biao is sitting between the Jiang and Han, and he does not dare to show his fullness. Hundreds of thousands, if the two sons were in harmony and defended their careers together, the world would not be known. Now take advantage of their brothers to attack each other, and they are weak and join me. I will send troops to remove Yuan Shang first, and then watch the changes and destroy Yuan Tan. The world will be settled. This opportunity should not be missed."" Cao was overjoyed, so he invited Xin Pi to drink, saying: ""Yuan Tan's surrender, is it true Ye Shou? Yuan Shang's army will surely win?"" Pi replied, ""Don't ask Ming Gong. The truth and deceit are both, and we can only talk about their potential. The Yuan family has been defeated for years, the army is exhausted outside, the ministers are executed inside; the brothers are slandered, the country is divided into two; Everyone knows that the earth will collapse. This is the time when the Yuan Dynasty will be destroyed. Today, Duke Ming raises troops to attack Ye. If Yuan Shang does not rescue him, he will lose his nest; The crowd is like the swift wind sweeping the autumn leaves. If you don’t follow this picture, you will attack Jingzhou, the land of Jingzhou’s prosperity, and the country and the people will not be shaken. The troubles in the four directions are no greater than Hebei. Now: I hope that the public will make it clear."" Cao was overjoyed and said, ""I hate meeting Xin Zuozhi too late!"" Xuande feared that he had a plan and did not dare to pursue him, so he led his troops back to Jingzhou.","The people resent the Yuans; the family is divided and, unlike in the Jingzhou region, the ruling family has no support. The deal is done. Cao Cao advances, and when Yuan Shang withdraws from besieging Pingyuan, Yuan Tan comes out to give chase, harrying him from behind.","“Supposing this scheme be attempted, who is the man for a messenger?” “I have one Xin Pi, Xin Ping's younger brother; he is the magistrate here in this very place. He is a fluent speaker and good scholar and suited to your purpose.” So Xin Pi was summoned and came readily enough. Letters were given him and an escort of three thousand soldiers took him beyond the border. He traveled as quickly as possible. At that time Cao Cao's camp was at the Xiping Pass and he was attacking Liu Biao, who had sent Liu Bei out to offer the first resistance. No battle had yet taken place. Soon after his arrival, Xin Pi was admitted to the Prime Minister's presence; and after the ceremonies of greeting, Cao Cao asked the object of the visit. Xin Pi explained that Yuan Tan wanted assistance and presented his dispatches. Cao Cao read them and told the messenger to wait in his camp while he called his officers to a council. The council met. Cheng Yu said, “Yuan Tan has been forced into making this offer because of the pressure of his brother's attack. Put no trust in him.” Lu Qian and Man Chong said, “You have led your armies here for a special purpose; how can you abandon that and go to assist Yuan Tan?” “Gentlemen, not one of you is giving good advice,” interposed Xun You. “This is how I regard it. Since there is universal trouble, in the midst of which Liu Biao remains quietly content with his position between the River Zhang and the River Han, it is evident that he has no ambition to enlarge his borders. The Yuans hold four regions and have many legions of soldiers. Harmony between the two brothers means success for the family, and none can foresee what will happen in the empire. Now take advantage of this fraternal conflict and let them fight till they are weakened and have to yield to our Prime Minister. Then Yuan Shang can be removed, and when the times are suitable, Yuan Tan can be destroyed in his turn. Thus peace will ensue. This present combination of circumstances is to be taken advantage of to full measure.” Cao Cao realized the truth of this and treated Xin Pi well. At a banquet Cao Cao said, “But is this surrender of Yuan Tan real or false? Do you really think that Yuan Shang's army is sure to overcome him?” Xin Pi replied, “Illustrious Sir, do not inquire into the degree of sincerity; rather regard the situation. The Yuans have been suffering military losses for years and are powerless without, while their strategists are put to death within. The brothers seize every chance to speak evil of each other and their country is divided. Add to this famine, supplemented by calamities and general exhaustion, and everybody, wise as well as simple, can see that the catastrophe is near and the time ordained of Heaven for the destruction of the Yuans is at hand. Now you have a force attacking the capital of Jizhou—Yejun—and if Yuan Shang will not return to give aid, the place of refuge is lost. If he helps, then Yuan Tan will follow up and smite him, making use of your power to destroy the remnant of his brother's army, just as the autumn gale sweeps away the fallen leaves. Now Liu Biao's Jingzhou is rich, the government peaceful, the people submissive, and it cannot be shaken. Moreover, there is no greater threat to it than the North of Yellow River. If that be reduced, then the task is complete. I pray you, Sir, think of it.” “I am sorry that I did not meet you earlier,” said Cao Cao, much gratified with this speech. Forthwith orders were given to return and attack Jizhou. Liu Bei, fearing this retirement was only a ruse, allowed it to proceed without interference and himself returned to Jingzhou."

Cheng said, ""Just push me to be sick, but I can't see you."" The doorman reported back. Teng said angrily, ""I came at night outside the Donghua Gate, and I saw him come out with a golden robe and jade belt. Why did he put off his illness! I came here without incident, so why would you refuse me!"" Cheng Qi said: ""Don't wait for the princes, temporarily allow Cheng to come out."" After the ceremony, take a seat. Teng said: ""Teng has entered the audience and will return, so I came to say goodbye, why do you see rejection?"" Cheng said: ""The poor body is violent, and it is a serious crime to miss the reception."" Teng said: ""The face is spring, and there is no sick face. ""Cheng was speechless. Teng flicked his sleeves up, sighed and went downstairs, saying, ""All of them are not the people who save the country!"" In response to what he said, he kept him and asked, ""Who do you call the person who is not the person who saves the country?"" His chest is still full of anger; the duke is the most relative of the country, and he is still dying in wine, and he does not think about harassing thieves, and he is a person who can help the royal family in disasters and disasters!"" Cheng was afraid of his deceit, and pretended to be shocked: ""Prime Minister Cao is the minister of the country. , the court relies on, why did you say this?"" Teng said angrily, ""Do you still regard Cao thief as a good person?"" Cheng said: ""The eyes and ears are very close, please keep your voice low."" Teng said: ""I am greedy for life and afraid of death. Disciple, it's not enough to talk about big things!"" After speaking, he wanted to get up again. Cheng knew Teng Zhongyi, so he said: ""President, please calm down. I asked the prince to see something."" So he invited Teng to enter the academy and took an edict to show him. After Teng finished reading, his hair stood on end, he gnawed his teeth and chewed his lips, and his mouth was bleeding. Said Cheng: ""If the prince has any action, I will command the soldiers of Xiliang as an external response."" Cheng asked Teng to meet with the princes, took out the letter of righteousness, and gave Teng the title of the book. Teng Nai took the wine and blood as an alliance and said: ""We swear to death to live up to the promise!"" Refering to the five people sitting on the table, he said: ""If you get ten people, the big things will be harmonious."" Cheng said: ""There are not many loyal and righteous people. If the person you are dealing with is not a human being, then the opposite will be harmful."" Teng Ji took the ""Preface to the Mandarin Duck Xinglu"" to examine it. When they found the Liu clan, they clapped their hands and said, ""Why don't we discuss with this person?"" Everyone asked who it was. Ma Teng took it easy and said the man. Exactly:","And so saying, he hands back the robe and belt to a hugely relieved Dong Cheng. At last Dong Cheng reaches the safety of his home. Here he puzzles over the emperor’s words and examines the belt in detail. But he cannot see any hidden secret compartment. After long hours worrying about this, he falls asleep. As he sleeps a spark falls from the candle and burns a hole in the lining. Smelling the burning material, he wakes up with a start. Then and only then does Dong Cheng sees that beneath the lining is a document. Pulling it out, he stares with astonishment at this document written in the emperor’s own blood. It commands him to create a group of patriots who will rid the empire of the rebels gathered around Cao Cao and restore the dignity of the dynasty. It is the year AD 199. The infamous incident during the hunt has outraged many. Soon Dong Cheng has literally signed up on a long piece of white silk as co-conspirators the following courageous men: Wang Zifu; Chong Ji; Wu Shi; Wu Zilan; Ma Teng.","While there, a new visitor, Ma Teng, Governor of Xiliang, was announced. “Say I am indisposed,” said the host, “and cannot receive visitors.” The doorkeeper took the message, whereat Ma Teng angrily said, “Last night at the Donghua Gate, I saw him come out in robe and girdle. How can he pretend illness today? I am not come from mere idleness, why does he refuse to see me?” The doorkeeper went in again and told his master what the visitor had said and that he was very angry. Then Dong Cheng rose, excused himself saying he would soon return, and went to receive Ma Teng. After the visitor had saluted and they were both seated, Ma Teng said, “I have just come from a farewell audience and wished to bid you adieu. Why did you want to put me off?” “My poor body was taken suddenly ill; that is why I was not waiting to welcome you,” said Dong Cheng. “You do not look as if you were ill; your face wears the very bloom of health,” said Ma Teng bluntly. His host could say no more and was silent. The visitor shook out his sleeves and rose to depart. He sighed deeply as he walked down the steps, saying to himself, “Not one of them is any good; there is no one to save the country.” This speech sank deeply into Dong Cheng's heart. He stopped his guest, saying, “Who is no good to save the country? Whom do you mean?” “That incident at the hunt the other day, the shooting of the stag, filled my breast with anger. But if you, a near relative of the Emperor, can pass your time in wine and idle dalliance without a thought of doing away with rebellion, where can any one be found who will save the dynasty?” However, Dong Cheng doubts were not set at rest. Pretending great surprise, he replied, “The Prime Minister is of high rank and has the confidence of the court; why then do you utter such things?” “So you find that wretch Cao Cao a good man, eh?” “Pray speak lower; there are eyes and ears very near us.” “The sort of people who covet life and fear death are not those to discuss any great undertaking.” So saying, Ma Teng rose to go sway. By this time his host's doubts were set at rest; he felt that Ma Teng was loyal and patriotic. So Dong Cheng said, “Do not be angry any more. I will show you something.” Whereupon he invited Ma Teng to go into the room where the others were seated and then showed him the decree. As Ma Teng read it, his hair stood on end; he ground his teeth and bit his lips till the blood came. “When you move, remember the whole force of my army is ready to help,” said Ma Teng. Dong Cheng introduced him to the other conspirators, and then the pledge was produced, and Ma Teng was told to sign his name. He did so, at the same time smearing the blood as a sign of the oath and saying, “I swear to die rather than betray this pledge.” Pointing to the five he said, “We require ten for this business, and we can accomplish our design.” “We cannot get many true and loyal people. One of the wrong sort will spoil all,” said Dong Cheng. Ma Teng told them to bring in the list of officials. He read on till he came to the name Liu, of the imperial clan, when clapping his hands he cried, “Why not consult him?” “Whom?” cried they altogether. Ma Teng very slowly and deliberately spoke his name."
一日，帝在後園與十常侍飲宴，諫議大夫劉陶，逕到帝前大慟。帝問其故。陶曰：“天下危在旦夕，陛下尚自與閹官共飲耶！”帝曰：“國家承平，有何危急？”陶曰：“四方盜賊並起，侵掠州郡。其禍皆由十常侍賣官害民，欺君罔上。朝廷正人皆去，禍在目前矣！”十常侍皆免冠跪伏於帝前曰：“大臣不相容，臣等不能活矣！願乞性命歸田里，盡將家產以助軍資。”言罷痛哭。帝怒謂陶曰：“汝家亦有近侍之人，何獨不容朕耶？”呼武士推出斬之。劉陶大呼：“臣死不惜！可憐漢室天下，四百餘年，到此一旦休矣！”武士擁陶出，方欲行刑，一大臣喝住曰：“勿得下手，待我諫去。”衆視之，乃司徒陳耽——逕入官中來諫帝曰：“劉諫議得何罪而受誅？”帝曰：“毁謗近臣，冒瀆朕躬。”耽曰：“天下人民，欲食十常侍之肉，陛下敬之如父母，身無寸功，皆封列侯；況封諝等結連黃巾，欲為內亂：陛下今不自省，社稷立見崩摧矣！”帝曰：“封諝作亂，其事不明。十常侍中，豈無一二忠臣？”陳耽以頭撞階而諫。帝怒，命牽出，與劉陶皆下獄。是夜，十常侍卽於獄中謀殺之；假帝詔以孫堅為長沙太守，討區星。,"One day, the emperor was having a banquet with the ten permanent attendants in the back garden, admonishing the doctor Liu Tao, and went straight to the emperor to mourn.

Tao said: ""The thieves from all over the world have come together to invade the prefectures and prefectures. Selling officials and harming the people, deceiving the king is reckless. All the officials of the court are gone, and the disaster is now!"" All the ten permanent servants knelt before the emperor without their crowns and said: ""The ministers are not compatible, the ministers and others can't live! May I beg my life to return to the field , I will use my family property to help the military."" After he finished speaking, he wept bitterly. The emperor angrily said to Tao: ""Your family also has close attendants, why not let me alone?"" Liu Tao shouted: ""I will not hesitate to die! Poor the Han family, more than 400 years, once it is over!"" The warriors rushed out of the pot and wanted to execute the execution. .” Everyone looked at it, and it was the Situ Chen Dan who went straight into the officials and came to remonstrate with the emperor, “What crime did Liu Jianjian commit and get executed?” The people want to eat the flesh of the ten permanent servants, and Your Majesty respects them like their parents, and they have no merit, so they are all appointed as Marquis; if the seals and others are connected with the yellow turban, they want to cause civil strife: Your Majesty is not self-examination now, and the government will soon collapse!"" The emperor said. : ""Feng Xu is in chaos, and the matter is unclear. Among the ten permanent servants, is there not one or two loyal ministers?"" Chen Dan remonstrated with his head hitting the steps. The emperor was angry, and ordered him to be taken out, and both Liu Tao and he were imprisoned. That night, the ten permanent servants murdered him in prison; the fake emperor ordered Sun Jian to be the prefect of Changsha to attack the district star.","He too feels the inspector should die but he also points out to Xuande that the position the court has given him is barely worth his time, and that this pompous inspector has simply confirmed that he is destined for greater things. ‘Brother!’ says Guan Yu, using an old proverb. ‘Does a glorious phoenix belong in a mere prickly bush? Let’s finish him off and get out of here.’ Xuande removes his seal of office and hangs it around the inspector’s neck. He tells him that because of his corruption, and the terrible damage this does to the ordinary people, they should kill him. ‘But we’ll spare you, so take this back to the court!’ he says. Then he and his two brothers in arms mount their horses and, turning their backs on the inspector, ride away. Needless to say, when the inspector returns to his superior, he tells him what has happened, and orders for the arrest of the three brothers are sent out. But by this time the three are long gone and have taken refuge with friends. Back at the imperial court the Ten Eunuchs continue to get rid of anyone who stands in their way. The least worthy men are promoted, and this leads to rebellions breaking out across the land. Yet the Ten act as if nothing is wrong. Brave men still try to open the emperor’s eyes to the evils the Ten are bringing upon the country, but the Ten claim they are the most loyal of subjects. And behind the emperor’s back they are murdering everyone who stands in their way. Xuande is quietly recommended to help in the suppression of another revolt and he is so successful that his offence against the inspector is forgotten.","One day the Emperor was at a feast in one of the gardens with the Ten, when High Counselor Liu Tao suddenly appeared showing very great distress. The Emperor asked what the matter was. “Sire, how can you be feasting with these when the empire is at the last gasp?” said Liu Tao. “All is well,” said the Emperor. “Where is anything wrong?” Said Liu Tao, “Robbers swarm on all sides and plunder the cities. And all is the fault of the Ten Eunuchs who sell offices and injure the people, oppress loyal officials and deceive their superiors. All virtuous ones have left the services, and misfortune is before our very eyes.” At this the eunuchs pulled off their hats and threw themselves at their master's feet. “If Minister Liu Tao disapproves of us,” they said, “we are in danger. We pray that our lives be spared and we may go to our farms. We yield our property to help defray military expenses.” And they wept bitterly. The Emperor turned angrily to Liu Tao, saying, “You also have servants; why can't you bear with mine?” And thereupon the Emperor called to the guards to eject Liu Tao and put him to death. Liu Tao cried aloud, “My death matters nothing. The pity is that Han Dynasty, after four centuries of reign, is falling fast.” The guards hustled him away and were just about to carry out the Emperor's order when a minister stopped them, shouting, “Strike not! Wait till I have spoken with His Majesty.” It was the Minister of the Interior, Chen Dan. He went in to the Emperor, to whom he said, “For what fault is Counselor Liu Tao to be put to death?” “He has vilified my servants; and has insulted me,” said the Emperor. “All the empire would eat the flesh of the eunuchs if they could, and yet, Sire, you respect them as if they were your parents. They have no merit, but they are created nobles. Moreover, Feng Xu was in league with the Yellow Scarves. Unless Your Majesty looks to it, the state will crumble!” “There was no proof against Feng Xu,” replied the Emperor. “About the Ten Eunuchs, are there none faithful among them?” Chen Dan beat his forehead on the steps of the throne and did not desist from remonstrance. Then the Emperor grew angry and commanded his removal and imprisonment with Liu Tao. That night Liu Tao and Chen Dan were murdered. Then the eunuchs sent a forged edict to Sun Jian making him Governor of Changsha, with orders to suppress the rebellion of Ou Xing."
兩朝旺氣皆天數，從此乾坤鼎足成。,"The two dynasties were prosperous for the number of days, and from then on, the universe was complete.","The creation of two Houses Heaven decrees And from now on, there will be three.",Thus fate then declared for the dynasties two And the tripartite rule there began.
操顧謂衆文官曰：“武將旣以騎射為樂，足顯威勇矣。公等皆飽學之士，登此高臺，可不進佳章以紀一時之勝事乎？”衆官皆躬身而言曰：“願從鈞命。”時有王朗、鍾繇、王粲、陳琳一班文官，進獻詩章。詩中多有稱頌曹操功德巍巍、合當受命之意。曹操遂一覽畢，笑曰：“諸公佳作，過譽甚矣。孤本愚陋，始舉孝廉。後值天下大亂，築精舍於譙東五十里，欲春夏讀書，秋冬射獵，以待天下淸平，方出仕耳。不意朝廷徵孤為典軍校尉，遂更其意，專欲為國家討賊立功，圖死後得題墓道曰：‘漢故征西將軍曹侯之墓’，平生願足矣。念自討董卓、剿黃巾以來，除袁術、破呂布、滅袁紹、定劉表，遂平天下，身為宰相，人臣之貴已極，又復何望哉？如國家無孤一人，正不知幾人稱帝，幾人稱王。或見孤權重，妄相忖度，疑孤有異心，此大謬也。孤常念孔子稱文王之至德，此言耿耿在心。但欲孤委捐兵衆，歸就所封武平侯之國，實不可耳：誠恐一解兵柄，為人所害；孤敗則國家傾危；是以不得慕虛名而處實禍也。諸公必無知孤意者。”衆皆起拜曰：“雖伊尹、周公，不及丞相矣。”後人有詩曰：,"Cao Gu asked the civil servants: ""The military general Zhang enjoys riding and shooting, and he is full of power and courage. The public and others are all well-educated men, and if they are on this high platform, can they not enter the good chapter to discipline the victory of the moment?"" All the officials bowed. The body said: ""I would like to obey Jun's life."" At that time, Wang Lang, Zhong Yao, Wang Can, and Chen Lin, a group of civil servants, contributed poems. In the poems, there are many praises for Cao Cao's merits and virtues, and it is meant to be ordered. When Cao Cao looked at it, he smiled and said, ""The excellent works of the masters are too well-known. They were ignorant and stupid, and they were filial and honest at first. Later, when the world was in chaos, they built the Jingshe fifty kilometers east of Qiao. When the world is at peace, the party goes out of office. I didn’t care that the imperial court Zheng Gu was the commander of the Dian Army, so I changed my mind and wanted to make meritorious deeds for the country. My wish is enough. Since I wanted to attack Dong Zhuo and suppressed the Yellow Turbans, except Yuan Shu, destroying Lv Bu, destroying Yuan Shao, and Ding Liu Biao, I have pacified the world. As a prime minister, people and ministers are extremely valuable, so what can I hope for? I just don’t know how many people are called emperors and how many people are called kings. Or seeing the power of the solitary, arrogantly thinking about the relationship, and suspecting that the solitary has a different heart. Donating a large number of troops and returning to the kingdom of the Marquis of Wuping is really unacceptable: since you are afraid that you will be harmed by others if you disarm your troops; if you are alone, the country will be in danger; I mean."" All the people stood up and said, ""Although Yi Yin and Zhou Gong are not as good as the prime minister."" Later, there was a poem saying:","This self-congratulatory prose causes all the officials present to kowtow and proclaim how immensely wise he is, unequalled by any of the great ministers of the past, not even those historic heroes Yi Yin and the duke of Zhou.","Civil officers of repute and generals of renown drank one to another, and hearty felicitations were exchanged. Cao Cao looked around to those about him, saying, “Since the military officers have competed in mounted archery for our enjoyment and displayed their boldness and their skill, you, Gentlemen Scholars, stuffed full of learning as you are, can surely mount the terrace and present some complimentary odes to make the occasion a perfect success.” “We are most willing to obey your commands,” they replied, all bowing low. At that time there was a band of four scholars named Wang Lang, Zhong Yao, Wang Can, and Chen Lin, and each of them presented a poem. Every poem sang the praises of Cao Cao's valuable services and great merits and said he was worthy to receive the highest trust of all. When Cao Cao had read them, he laughed, saying, “You gentlemen are really too flattering. As a fact I am but an ignoramus who began life with a simple bachelor's degree and recommendations for filial devotion. And when the troubles began, I built for myself a little cottage in the country near Qiao, where I could study in spring and summer and spend the rest of the year in hunting till the empire was once more tranquil and I could emerge and take office. “To my surprise, I was chosen for a small military office which changed my intentions, and I determined to repress the rebellion and so make a name for myself. I thought that I might win an inscription on my tomb to the effect that it covered the remains of the “Lord Cao Cao Who Restores Order in the West.” That would have been ample for a life's work. I recall now how I destroyed Dong Zhuo and smote the Yellow Scarves; then I made away with Yuan Shu and broke the power of Lu Bu; next I exterminated Yuan Shao; and at the death of Liu Biao, I had subdued the whole empire. “As a minister of state I have attained the topmost pinnacle of honor, and I have no more to hope for. Were it not for poor me, I know not how many there would be styling themselves emperors and dubbing themselves princes. Certain there be who, seeing my great authority , think I have some ulterior aim. But they are quite wrong. I ever bear in mind what Confucius said of King Wen of Zhou, that he was perfectly virtuous, and this saying is ever engraved on my mind1. If I could, I would do away with my armies and retire to my fief with my simple title of Lord of Wuping. Alas! I cannot. I am afraid to lay down my military powers lest I should come to harm. Should I be defeated, the state would totter; and so I may not risk real misfortune for the sake of an empty reputation for kindness. There be some of you who do not know my heart.” As he closed, they all rose and bowed their heads, saying, “None are your equals, O Prime Minister, not even Duke Zhou or the great Minister Yi Yin2.” A poem has been written referring to this:"
却說周瑜聞諸葛瑾之言，轉恨孔明，存心欲謀殺之。次日點齊軍將，入辭孫權。權曰：“卿先行，孤卽起兵繼後。”瑜辭出，與程普、魯肅領兵起行，便邀孔明同往。孔明欣然從之。一同登舟，駕起帆檣，迤邐望夏口而進。離三江口五六十里，船依次第歇定。周瑜在中央下寨，岸上依西山結營，周圍屯住。孔明只在一葉小舟內安身。,"But it is said that Zhou Yu heard Zhuge Jin's words, turned his hatred on Kong Ming, and planned to murder him. The next day, he ordered the generals of Qi and resigned from Sun Quan. Quan said, ""Your Excellency will go first, and Gu You will raise troops to follow."" Yu resigned, and Cheng Pu and Lu Su led the troops and invited Kong Ming to go with him. Kong Ming readily followed. Boarding the boat together, driving the sails, and looking forward to Xiakou. Fifty or sixty miles away from Sanjiangkou, the boats stopped one by one. Zhou Yu settled down in the center of the village, set up camp on the west mountain, and settled in the surrounding area. Kong Ming only settled in a small boat.","Zhou Yu’s plan is simple. He suggests that Kong Ming, along with Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong and a thousand men, should penetrate deep behind the enemy lines and destroy their supplies. Kong Ming realizes that this is in truth a suicide mission, designed primarily to ensure his death, but, unable to immediately think of a way out, he has to agree. When later Lu Su challenges Zhou Yu as to the reason for this mission, Zhou Yu is honest enough to admit he wants Cao Cao’s soldiers to kill Kong Ming and thus not have the blame fall upon himself.","He continued his preparations for war, and when the troops were all mustered and ready, he went in for a farewell interview with his lord. “You go on first, Noble Sir,” said Sun Quan. “I will then march to support you.” Zhou Yu took his leave and then, with Cheng Pu and Lu Su, marched out with the army. He invited Zhuge Liang to accompany the expedition, and when Zhuge Liang cheerfully accepted, the four embarked in the same ship. They set sail, and the flotilla made for Xiakou. About twenty miles from Three Gorges the fleet anchored near the shore, and Zhou Yu built a stockade on the bank near the middle of their line with the Western Hills as a support. Other camps were made near his. Zhuge Liang, however, took up his quarters in a small ship."
且說李傕、郭汜旣掌大權，殘虐百姓，密遣心腹侍帝左右，觀其動靜。獻帝此時舉動荊棘。朝廷官員，並由二賊陞降。因採人望，特宣朱儁入朝，封為太僕，同領朝政。一日，人報西涼太守馬騰、并州刺史韓遂二將引軍十餘萬，殺奔長安來，聲言討賊。原來二將先曾使人入長安，結連侍中馬宇、諫議大夫种邵、左中郎將劉範三人為內應，共謀賊黨。三人密奏獻帝，封馬騰為征西將軍、韓遂為鎮西將軍，各受密詔，併力討賊。當下李傕、郭汜、張濟、樊稠聞二軍將至，一同商議禦敵之策。謀士賈詡曰：“二軍遠來，只宜深溝高壘，堅守以拒之。不過百日，彼兵糧盡，必將自退，然後引兵追之，二將可擒矣。”李蒙、王方出曰：“此非好計。愿借精兵萬人，立斬馬騰、韓遂之頭，獻於麾下。”賈詡曰：“今若卽戰，必當敗績。”李蒙、王方齊聲曰：“若吾二人敗，情愿斬首；吾若戰勝，公亦當輸首級與我。”詡謂李傕、郭汜曰：“長安西二百里盩厔山，其路險峻，可使張、樊兩將軍屯兵於此，堅壁守之；待李蒙、王方自引兵迎敵，可也。”李傕、郭汜從其言，點一萬五千人馬與李蒙、王方。二人忻喜而去，離長安二百八十里下寨。,"Let's say that Li Jue and Guo Bian were in power, cruelty to the people, and secretly dispatched their confidants to serve the emperor around and watch their movements. At this time, Emperor Xian acted as a thorn. Officials of the court, and ascended and descended by two thieves. Because of the popularity of the people, Zhu Jun was specially announced to enter the court, and he was named a servant and led the government together. One day, it was reported that Ma Teng, the prefect of Western Liang, and Han Sui, the prefect of Bingzhou, led more than 100,000 troops, and rushed to Chang'an to kill them, claiming that they would punish the thieves. It turned out that the two generals had first sent people to Chang'an, and joined Ma Yu, the counselor, Chong Shao, and Liu Fan, the general of the left, as internal advisers, conspiring against the gang. The three secretly played to the emperor, appointed Ma Teng as the general of Zhengxi, and Han Sui as the general of Zhenxi. At the moment, Li Jue, Guo Si, Zhang Ji, and Fan Chou heard that the second army was approaching, and discussed the strategy of defending the enemy together. Adviser Jia Xu said: ""When the two armies are coming from afar, it is only advisable to hold them in deep trenches and high fortifications to resist them. In just a hundred days, they will run out of supplies, and they will retreat on their own, and then lead their troops to pursue them, and the two generals can be captured."" Wang Fangchu said: ""This is not a good plan. I would like to borrow thousands of elite soldiers to cut off the heads of Ma Teng and Han Sui, and offer them to his subordinates."" Jia Xu said: ""If you fight now, you will be defeated."" Li Meng and Wang Fangqi The voice said: ""If the two of us are defeated, I would rather be beheaded; if I win, the duke should also lose the head with me."" He said to Li Jue and Guo Si: ""The road to Sucui Mountain, two hundred miles west of Chang'an, is steep and steep. You can make General Zhang and Fan station their troops here and defend it; it’s okay to wait for Li Meng and Wang Fang to lead their own troops to meet the enemy.” Li Jue and Guo Si followed their words and ordered 15,000 men and horses to join Li Meng and Wang Fang. square. The two left with joy and went down to the village two hundred and eighty li from Chang'an.","Emboldened by their success, the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si then said to each other, ‘Why don’t we go the whole way and get rid of the emperor and so create our own dynasty?’","So now Li Jue and Guo Si wielded the real power of the scepter, and they were hard upon the people. They also removed the attendants from the Palace and replaced them by their own creatures, who maintained a most perfect watch over every movement of the Emperor so that he was greatly hampered and embarrassed. All appointments and demotions were made by the two rebels. For the sake of popularity they especially summoned Zhu Jun to court, made him Minister of the Palace Bureau and associated him with the government. One day came a report that the Governor of Xiliang, Ma Teng, and the Imperial Protector of Bingzhou, Han Sui, with one hundred thousand troops, are rapidly approaching the capital with the intention of attacking the rebels in the name of the Emperor. Now these leaders from the west had laid careful plans. Ma Teng and Han Sui had sent trusty friends to the capital to find out who would support them. They had conspired with three officials—Court Counselors Ma Yu and Chong Shao, and Imperial Commander Liu Fan—to be their inside allies and plot against the rebels. These three obtained from the Throne two secret edicts conferring the ranks of Commander Who Conquers the West on Ma Teng and Commander Who Guards the West on Han Sui. With these powers the two commanders joined forces and began their march. The four leaders of the party in power—Li Jue, Guo Si, Fan Chou, and Zhang Ji—held a consultation with their generals as to how to meet the attack. Adviser Jia Xu said, “Since the attackers are coming from a distance, our plan is to fortify and wait till shortage of food shall work for us. In a hundred days their supplies will be consumed, and they must retire. We can pursue and we shall capture them.” Li Meng and Wang Fang rose and said, “This plan is bad. Give us ten thousand troops, and we will put an end to both of them and offer their heads before your ensign.” “To fight forthwith means defeat,” said Jia Xu. Li Meng and Wang Fang cried with one voice, “If we fail, we are willing to lose our heads; but if we win, then your head is forfeit.” Jia Xu then suggested to Li Jue and Guo Si, saying, “Seventy miles west of the capital stand the Zhouzhi Hills. The passes are narrow and difficult. Send Generals Zhang Ji and Fan Chou to occupy this point of vantage and fortify themselves so that they may support Li Meng and Wang Fang.” Li Jue and Guo Si accepted this advice. They told off fifteen thousand horse and foot, and Li Meng and Wang Fang left in high spirit. They made a camp ninety miles from Changan."
曹操於几案上翻覆將書看了十餘次，忽然拍案張目大怒曰：“黃蓋用苦肉計，令汝下詐降書，就中取事，却敢來戲侮我耶！”便敎左右推出斬之。左右將闞澤簇下。澤面不改容，仰天大笑。操敎牽回，叱曰：“吾已識破奸計，汝何故哂笑？”澤曰：“吾不笑你。吾笑黃公覆不識人耳。”操曰：“何不識人？”澤曰：“殺便殺，何必多問！”操曰：“吾自幼熟讀兵書，深知奸偽之道。汝這條計，只好瞞別人，如何瞞得我！”澤曰：“你且說書中那件事是奸計？”操曰：“我說出你那破綻，敎你死而無怨：你旣是眞心獻書投降，如何不明約幾時？如今你有何理說？”闞澤聽罷，大笑曰：“虧汝不惶恐，敢自誇熟讀兵書！還不及早收兵回去！倘若交戰，必被周瑜擒矣！無學之輩！可惜吾屈死汝手！”操曰：“何謂我無學？”澤曰：“汝不識機謀，不明道理，豈非無學？”操曰：“你且說，我那幾般不是處？”澤曰：“汝無待賢之禮，吾何必言！但有死而已。”操曰：“汝若說得有理，我自然敬服。”澤曰：“豈不聞‘背主作竊，不可定期’？倘今約定日期，急切下不得手，這裏反來接應，事必泄漏。但可覷便而行，豈可預期相訂乎？汝不明此理，欲屈殺好人，眞無學之輩也！”操聞言，改容下席而謝曰：“某見事不明，誤犯尊威，幸勿挂懷。”澤曰：“吾與黃公覆，傾心投降，如嬰兒之望父母，豈有詐乎？”操大喜曰：“若二人能建大功，他日受爵，必在諸人之上。”澤曰：“某等非為爵祿而來，實應天順人耳。”操取酒待之。,"Cao Cao turned over and read the book more than ten times in several cases, and suddenly slapped the case and opened his eyes in anger, saying: ""Huang Gai used a bitter plan to order you to defraud and surrender the book. Launch the slash left and right. Left and right will Kan Ze cluster down. Ze Mian did not change his face, and laughed loudly. Cao Chi took it back and shouted: ""I have seen through the trick, why are you laughing?"" Ze said: ""I don't laugh at you. I laugh at Duke Huang who doesn't know people's ears."" Cao said: ""Why don't you know people?"" Ze said Cao said: ""I have been familiar with military literature since I was a child, and I know the ways of treason. You have to hide this plan from others, how can you hide it from me!"" Ze said: ""Let's talk about it. Is that incident in the book a treachery?"" Cao said, ""I told you about your flaws, and I will teach you to die without any complaints: You sincerely offered a book and surrendered, why don't you know when? What's your reasoning now?"" Kan After listening to Ze, he laughed loudly and said, ""It's a shame that you didn't panic, you dare to boast that you are familiar with the military book! Don't withdraw your troops as soon as possible! If you fight, you will be captured by Zhou Yu! Uneducated people! It's a pity that I surrender to your hands!"" Cao said ""What do you mean I have no learning?"" Ze said: ""You don't know the tricks, don't know the truth, don't you have no learning?"" ""Why should I say it! But there is death."" Cao said: ""If you are right, I will naturally respect it."" Ze said: ""Don't you hear that 'betraying the master and committing theft cannot be fixed'? If you can’t handle it, you will respond here, and things will leak. But you can do it at your own pace, how can you expect it? You don’t understand this reason, and you want to kill a good person, but you are an uneducated person!” Cao heard the words and changed his face. Xie Xie said: ""Someone sees something unclear, and mistakenly violated honor and prestige. Fortunately, don't worry about it."" Ze said: ""I and Huang Gong are overwhelmed, and I surrender with all my heart, like a baby looking to its parents, how can it be deceitful?"" Cao was overjoyed and said: ""If the two of them can make great achievements, the other day they will be awarded titles, and they will be above everyone else."" Ze said: ""A certain class is not here for the title, and it should be in accord with people's ears."" He took the wine and treated him.","‘This is the old trick of a flogging followed by an apparent desertion,’ he cries, and he orders the execution of Kan Ze. As he is about to be dragged away to be killed, Kan Ze suddenly laughs. Surprised by this, Cao Cao orders him brought back. ‘I know what you are up to, so why are you laughing?’ ‘I am not laughing at you,’ replies Kan Ze, ‘but at poor Huang Gai, who thinks he understands men. Just get on with the execution, will you, please, and stop asking questions!’ ‘You can’t fool me,’ replies Cao Cao. ‘I have studied the books of warfare and know this old trick when I see it.’ ‘What trick?’ asks Kan Ze. ‘Where in this letter do you find this “trick” – show me!’ ‘Huang Gai doesn’t say a date or time when he will desert. If he was really wanting to come over he would have set a time.’ ‘You claim to know the books of war,’ says Kan Ze, ‘but really you know nothing! Don’t you know the old saying that there is no set time for betraying your lord? What if he had said a day and time but for unforeseen circumstances was unable to be there on time. Then the whole venture might collapse. You can’t fix a time to slip away. Really, you are a fool!’ This all makes Cao Cao stop and reflect. ‘I’m sorry,’ he says. ‘You see, both Huang Gai and I want to come over to you,’ says Kan Ze confidently.","Leaning there on the low table by his side, Cao Cao turned this letter over and over and read it again and again. Then he smacked the table, opened his eyes wide with anger, saying, “Huang Gai is trying to play the personal injury trick on me, is he? And you are in it as the intermediary to present the letter. How dare you come to sport with me?” Cao Cao ordered the lictors to thrust forth the messenger and take off his head. Kan Ze was hustled out, his face untroubled. On the contrary, he laughed aloud. At this Cao Cao told them to bring him back and harshly said to him, “What do you find to laugh at now that I have foiled you and your ruse has failed?” “I was not laughing at you; I was laughing at my friend's simplicity.” “What do you mean by his simplicity?” “If you want to slay, slay; do not trouble me with a multitude of questions.” “I have read all the books on the art of war, and I am well versed in all ways of misleading the enemy. This ruse of yours might have succeeded with many, but it will not do for me.” “And so you say that the letter is a vicious trick?” said Kan Ze. “What I say is that your little slip has sent you to the death you risked. If the thing was real and you were sincere, why does not the letter name a time of coming over? What have you to say to that?” Kan Ze waited to the end and then laughed louder than ever, saying, “I am so glad you are not frightened but can still boast of your knowledge of the books of war. Now you will not lead away your soldiers. If you fight, Zhou Yu will certainly capture you. But how sad to think I die at the hand of such an ignorant fellow!” “What mean you? I, ignorant?” “You are ignorant of any strategy and a victim of unreason; is not that sufficient?” “Well then, tell me where is any fault.” “You treat wise people too badly for me to talk to you. You can finish me and let there be an end of it.” “If you can speak with any show of reason, I will treat you differently.” “Do you not know that when one is going to desert one's master and become a renegade, one cannot say exactly when the chance will occur? If one binds one's self to a fixed moment and the thing cannot be done just then, the secret will be discovered. One must watch for an opportunity and take it when it comes. Think: is it possible to know exactly when? But you know nothing of common sense; all you know is how to put good humans to death. So you really are an ignorant fellow!” At this Cao Cao changed his manner, got up, and came over to the prisoner bowing, “I did not see clearly; that is quite true. I offended you, and I hope you will forget it.” “The fact is that Huang Gai and I are both inclined to desert to you; we even yearn for it as a child desires its parents. Is it possible that we should play you false?” “If you two could render me so great a service, you shall certainly be richly rewarded.” “We do not desire rank or riches; we come because it is the will of Heaven and the plain way of duty.” Then wine was set out, and Kan Ze was treated as an honored guest."
操大喜。回寨，請入帳中，置酒共飲，同說兵機。統高談雄辯，應答如流。操深敬服，慇懃相待。統佯醉曰：“敢問軍中有良醫否？”操問何用。統曰：“水軍多疾，須用良醫治之。”時操軍因不服水土，俱生嘔吐之疾，多有死者。操正慮此事，忽聞統言，如何不問？統曰：“丞相敎練水軍之法甚妙，但可惜不全。”操再三請問。統曰：“某有一策，使大小水軍，並無疾病，安穩成功。”操大喜，請問妙策。統曰：“大江之中，潮生潮落，風浪不息。北兵不慣乘舟，受此顚播，便生疾病。若以大船小船各皆配搭，或三十為一排，或五十為一排，首尾用鐵環連鎖，上鋪闊板，休言人可渡，馬亦可走矣。乘此而行，任他風浪潮水上下，復何懼哉？”曹操下席而謝曰：“非先生良謀，安能破東吳耶？”統曰：“愚淺之見，丞相自裁之。”操卽時傳令，喚軍中鐵匠，連夜打造連環大釘，鎖住船隻。諸軍聞之，俱各喜悅。後人有詩曰：,"Overjoyed. Back to the village, please enter the account, drink wine together, and talk about the military machine. All talk eloquently, and the answers are fluent. Cao deeply respect, treat each other with kindness. Tong pretended to be drunk and said, ""Dare to ask if there are good doctors in the army?"" Tong said: ""The navy army suffers from many diseases, and it is necessary to use a good doctor to treat them."" Because the Shi Cao army did not accept the water and soil, all of them suffered from vomiting and many deaths. Cao Zheng was thinking about this, and suddenly heard the common words, how could he not ask? Tong said: ""The prime minister's method of training the navy is very good, but unfortunately it is not complete."" Cao asked again and again. Tong said: ""Someone has a strategy, so that the large and small sailors have no disease and are stable and successful."" Cao was overjoyed and asked for a good strategy. Tong said: ""In the big river, the tide rises and falls, and the wind and waves are constant. The northern soldiers are not used to riding boats, and they will suffer from diseases when they are sow. It is a row, the head and tail are chained with iron rings, and the top is covered with wide boards, so that people can cross, and horses can leave. Ride this way, let him go up and down the wind and waves, why should you be afraid?"" Cao Cao got off the table and thanked him. He said, ""It's not your master's good plan, can Anneng break the Eastern Wu?"" Tong said, ""It's a foolish and shallow view, and the prime minister will kill it himself."" Cao Youshi sent an order to call the blacksmiths in the army to build a series of big nails overnight and lock the ship. When the soldiers heard this, they were all delighted. A later poem says:","Needless to say, Cao Cao is intrigued but also confused to hear this. In fact, there has been an outbreak of illness among his men, and this has worried him. ‘The problem is,’ says Pang Tong, ‘that your men on the boats are at risk, but there’s a way of preventing this.’ Cao Cao, of course, wants to know what that could be, so Pang Tong tells him. ‘It’s all down to how you’ve set up your naval depots. The river is a turbulent one, and this constant movement is making your landlubber men sick. Now, if you were to tie up your various ships in groups of, say, between thirty and fifty and linked them with broad walkways, then this would stabilize them and keep them still even in a storm.’ Cao Cao leaps up with delight and thanks Pang Tong. Within hours, the blacksmiths are ordered to create huge chains and fixtures to link the ships together.","Cao Cao was mightily pleased. They rode back to the chief tent and wine was brought. They discussed military matters, and Pang Tong held forth at length. Remarks and comments flowed freely between the two, and Cao Cao formed an exalted opinion of his new adherent's abilities and treated him with the greatest honor. By and bye the guest seemed to have succumbed to the influence of many cups and said, “Have you any capable medical people in your army?” “What are they for, Master?” said Cao Cao. “There is a lot of illness among the marines, and you ought to find some remedy.” The fact was that at this time Cao Cao's men were suffering from the climate; many were vomiting and not a few had died. It was a source of great anxiety to him, and when the newcomer suddenly mentioned it, of course he had to ask advice. Pang Tong said, “Your marine force is excellent, but there is just one defect; it is not quite perfect.” Cao Cao pressed him to say where the imperfection lay. “I have a plan to overcome the ailment of the soldiers so that no one shall be sick and all fit for service.” “What is this excellent scheme?” said Cao Cao. “The river is wide, and the tides ebb and flow. The winds and waves are never at rest. Your troops from the north are unused to ships, and the motion makes them ill. If your ships, large and small, were classed and divided into thirties, or fifties, and joined up stem to stem by iron chains and boards spread across them, to say nothing of soldiers being able to pass from one to the next, even horses could move about on them. If this were done, then there would be no fear of the wind and the waves and the rising and falling tides.” Coming down from his seat, Cao Cao thanked his guest, saying, “I could never defeat the land of the south without this scheme of yours.” “That is my idea;” said Pang Tong, “it is for you to decide about it.” Orders were then issued to call up all the blacksmiths and set them to work, night and day, forging iron chains and great bolts to lock together the ships. And the soldiers rejoiced when they heard of the plan. In the Red Cliffs' fight they used the flame,"

且說孫權退入內宅，寢食不安，猶豫不決。吳國太見權如此，問曰：“何事在心，寢食俱廢？”權曰：“今曹操屯兵於江、漢，有下江南之意。問諸文武，或欲降者，或欲戰者。欲待戰來，恐寡不敵衆；欲待降來，又恐曹操不容：因此猶豫不決。”吳國太曰：“汝何不記吾姐臨終之語乎？”孫權如醉方醒，似夢初覺，想出這句話來。正是：,"Let's say that Sun Quan retreated into the inner house, was restless and hesitant to sleep and eat. Wu State Tai saw Quan like this, and asked: ""What is in the mind, sleep and food are all useless?"" Quan said: ""Now Cao Cao has stationed troops in Jiang and Han, and has the intention of going to the south of the Yangtze River. Ask the civil and military, whether they want to surrender, or who want to fight. When the battle comes, I am afraid that I will be outnumbered; if I want to come, I am afraid that Cao Cao will not tolerate it: so I hesitate."" Wu Guotai said: ""Why don't you remember my sister's dying words?"" Sun Quan woke up like a drunk, like the beginning of a dream Feel, come up with this sentence. Exactly:","At these words, all Sun Quan’s doubts disappear, and he finally agrees to join Xuande in confronting Cao Cao. But his advisers are horrified and, led by Zhang Zhao, they argue furiously that such a course would be disastrous. Once again Sun Quan finds himself in a quandary of indecision. Despite Lu Su’s efforts, Sun Quan is unable to make up his mind.","Sun Quan went to his private apartments greatly perplexed. There his worry was easily discernible, and he neither ate nor slept. He was quite unable to decide finally upon a course of action. Then Lady Wu, the sister of his late mother, whom he also regarded as his own mother, asked him what so troubled him, and he told her of the threatened danger of Cao Cao and the different opinions his advisers held one and another and all his doubts and fears. “If I fight, I might fail; and if I offer to surrender, perhaps Cao Cao will reject my proposal,” said he. Then she replied, “Have you forgotten the last words of my sister?” As to one recovering from a fit of drunkenness, or waking out of a dream, so came to him the dying words of the mother who bore him."

却說玄德引十數萬百姓、三千餘軍馬，一程程挨着往江陵進發。趙雲保護老小，張飛斷後。孔明曰：“雲長往江夏去了，絕無回音，不知若何。”玄德曰：“敢煩軍師親自走一遭。劉琦感公昔日之敎，今若見公親至，事必諧矣。”孔明允諾，便同劉封引五百軍先往江夏求救去了。當日玄德自與簡雍、糜竺、糜芳同行。正行間，忽然一陣狂風就馬前刮起，塵土沖天，平遮紅日。玄德驚曰：“此何兆也？”簡雍頗明陰陽，袖占一課，失驚曰：“此大凶之兆也。應在今夜。主公可速棄百姓而走。”玄德曰：“百姓從新野相隨至此，吾安忍棄之？”雍曰：“主公若戀而不棄，禍不遠矣。”玄德問：“前面是何處？”左右答曰：“前面是當陽縣。有座山名為景山。”玄德便敎就此山紮住。時秋末冬初，涼風透骨；黃昏將近，哭聲遍野。至四更時分，只聽得西北喊聲震地而來。玄德大驚，急上馬引本部精兵二千餘人迎敵。曹兵掩至，勢不可當。玄德死戰。正在危迫之際，幸得張飛引軍至，殺開一條血路，救玄德望東而走。文聘當先攔住。玄德罵曰：“背主之賊，尚有何面目見人！”文聘羞慚滿面，引兵自投東北去了。張飛保着玄德，且戰且走。奔至天明，聞喊聲漸漸遠去，玄德方纔歇馬。看手下隨行人，止有百餘騎；百姓老小并糜竺、糜芳、簡雍、趙雲等等一干人，皆不知下落。玄德大哭曰：“十數萬生靈，皆因戀我，遭此大難；諸將及老小，皆不知存亡；雖土木之人，寧不悲乎！”,"However, Xuande said that he led hundreds of thousands of people and more than 3,000 soldiers and horses to set off for Jiangling. Zhao Yun protects the young and old, and Zhang Fei is broken. Kong Ming said, ""Yunchang has gone to Jiangxia, but there is absolutely no reply. I don't know what to do."" Xuande said, ""I dare to bother the military advisor to go there in person. Liu Qi is grateful for the teachings of the Duke in the past. ."" Kong Ming promised, and together with Liu Feng, he led five hundred troops to Jiangxia to ask for help. On that day, Xuande went with Jian Yong, Mi Zhu, and Mi Fang. While walking, a gust of wind suddenly blew up in front of the horse, and the dust rose to the sky, covering the red sun. Xuande was startled and said, ""What is this omen?"" Jian Yong was quite clear about yin and yang, and he held a lesson in his sleeve. He was startled and said, ""This is a great omen. It should be tonight. The lord can quickly abandon the people and leave."" Xuande said: ""The people have followed each other from Xinye to this point, so I can bear to abandon them?"" Yong said, ""If your lord loves you but doesn't give up, the disaster will not be far away."" Xuande asked, ""Where is the front?"" The left and right replied, ""The front is Dangyang County. There is a mountain called Jingshan."" Xuande then ordered to stay on this mountain. At the end of autumn and beginning of winter, the cool wind is blowing through the bones; At the fourth watch, only the northwest shouts came from the ground. Xuande was startled, and hurriedly mounted his horse to lead more than 2,000 elite troops from his headquarters to meet the enemy. Cao's army was covering up, and it was unstoppable. Xuande fought to the death. At the time of the crisis, Zhang Fei was fortunate to lead the army, cut a bloody road, and save Xuande Wangdong. Wen Ping stopped first. Xuande scolded him, ""A thief who backs his master, what face does he have to see?"" Wen Pin was ashamed, and led his troops to the northeast. Zhang Fei protects Xuande, fights and walks. Rushing to dawn, hearing the shouts gradually fade away, Xuande just stopped his horse. Looking at the entourage, there were more than a hundred cavalry; the whereabouts of the common people, including Mi Zhu, Mi Fang, Jian Yong, Zhao Yun, and others, were unknown. Xuande cried and said, ""Hundreds of thousands of living beings have suffered this great disaster because of their love for me; all the generals, old and young, do not know whether they will survive or die; although people of civil engineering and construction, they would rather not be sad!""","Meanwhile, as Xuande advances with the people, protected by Zhang Fei and Zhao Zilong, he sends Guan Yu to seek reinforcements from Liu Qi in Jiangxia. One day, as they are travelling, a sudden gust of wind blows up in front of Xuande. The dust cloud is so dense it blots out the sun, and Xuande knows this is not an auspicious omen. Quite the reverse. He consults Jian Yong, who is skilled in the reading of auguries and omens, and he tells Xuande that this is a very bad sign indeed and that a terrible fate awaits them that very night. Jian Yong tries to persuade Xuande to flee in order to save his life and that he must abandon the people. But once again Xuande refuses. Instead, they take up defensive positions on a nearby hill and await what the night will bring. It is a bitterly cold winter night, and in the early hours of the morning, before the sun comes up, Cao Cao’s men attack. Soon the night air is rent with terrible shrieks and cries. Despite his most gallant efforts, Xuande is unable to hold them back and he is almost slain in the midst of this chaos, but Zhang Fei arrives just in time to rescue him, cutting his way through the attackers to rescue his beloved brother. Turning east, they run into Wen Ping, who is now on Cao Cao’s side since the surrender of Jiangyang and the deaths of Liu Zong and his mother. ‘You traitor!’ cries Xuande. ‘How dare you even look at me?’ Wen Ping is overcome with shame and turns his men away, allowing Xuande and Zhang Fei to escape. But their path is far from clear. Other enemy commanders come to the attack. Zhang Fei slashes left and right, cutting a path through the enemy troops for Xuande as they flee, until dawn at last appears. Xuande looks around in the pale dawn light and sees just about a hundred of his men left. Of the whereabouts of his family or his people he has no idea. ‘Untold numbers of lives,’ he cries, ‘are undergoing terrible suffering because of me. And all because they wouldn’t leave me. My family, my staff, all gone. So overwhelming is this sorrow that even if I was made of wood or brick I would be weeping right now.’","As has been said Liu Bei was traveling with a huge multitude of followers, to guard whom he had taken what precautions were possible. Zhang Fei was in charge of the rear guard, and Zhao Yun was to protect his lord's family. Guan Yu had been sent to Jiangxia. One day Zhuge Liang came in and said, “There is as yet no news from Jiangxia; there must be some difficulties.” “I wish that you yourself would go there,” said Liu Bei. “Liu Qi would remember your former kindness to him and consent to anything you proposed.” Zhuge Liang said he would go and set out with Liu Feng, the adopted son of Liu Bei, taking an escort of five hundred troops. A few days after, while on the march in company with three of his commanders—Jian Yong, Mi Zhu, and Mi Fang— a sudden whirlwind rose just in front of Liu Bei, and a huge column of dust shot up into the air hiding the face of the sun. Liu Bei was frightened and asked, “What might that portend?” Jian Yong, who knew something of the mysteries of nature, took the auspices by counting secretly on his fingers. Pale and trembling he announced, “A calamity is threatening this very night. My lord must leave the people to their fate and flee quickly.” “I cannot do that,” said Liu Bei. “If you allow your pity to overcome your judgment, then misfortune is very near,” said Jian Yong. Thus spoke Jian Yong to his lord, who then asked what place was near. His people replied, “Dangyang is quite close, and there is a very famous mountain near it called Prospect Mountain.” Then Liu Bei bade them lead the way thither. The season was late autumn, just changing to winter, and the icy wind penetrated to the very bones. As evening fell, long-drawn howls of misery were heard on every side. At the middle of the fourth watch, two hours after midnight, they heard a rumbling sound in the northwest. Liu Bei halted and placed himself at the head of his own guard of two thousand soldiers to meet whatever might come. Presently Cao Cao's men appeared and made fierce onslaught. Defense was impossible, though Liu Bei fought desperately. By good fortune just at the crisis Zhang Fei came up, cut an arterial alley through, rescued his brother, and got him away to the east. Presently they were stopped by Wen Ping. “Turncoat! Can you still look humans in the face?” cried Liu Bei. Wen Ping was overwhelmed with shame and led his troops away. Zhang Fei, now fighting, protected his brother till dawn. By that time Liu Bei had got beyond the sound of battle and there was time to rest. Only a few of his followers had been able to keep near him. He knew nothing of the fate of his officers or the people. He lifted up his voice in lamentation, saying, “Myriads of living souls are suffering from love of me, and my officers and my loved ones are lost. One would be a graven image not to weep at such loss.”"
却說玄德擁着百姓，緩緩而行。孔明曰：“追兵不久卽至，可遣雲長往江夏求救公子劉琦，敎他速起兵乘船會於江陵。”玄德從之，卽修書令雲長同孫乾領五百軍往江夏求救；令張飛斷後；趙雲保護老小；其餘俱管顧百姓而行。每日只走十餘里便歇。,"But he said that Xuande embraced the people and walked slowly. Kong Ming said: ""The chasing troops will arrive soon, and you can send Yunchang to Jiangxia to ask for help, Young Master Liu Qi, and tell him to raise troops quickly and take a boat to Jiangling."" Xuande obeyed and ordered Yunchang and Sun Qian to lead 500 troops to Jiangling. Jiang Xia asked for help; Zhang Fei was cut off; Zhao Yun protected the young and old; Only walk ten miles a day and then rest.","The older folk are entranced by his compassion. Back in Xiangyang, Cao Mao and Zhang Yun persuade Liu Zong to surrender to Cao Cao.","The progress of Liu Bei, with the crowd of people in his train, was very slow. “The pursuers will be upon us quickly,” said Zhuge Liang. “Let us send Guan Yu to Jiangxia for succor. Liu Qi should be told to bring soldiers and prepare boats for us at Jiangling.” Liu Bei agreed to this and wrote a letter which he sent by the hands of Guan Yu and Sun Qian and five hundred troops. Zhang Fei was put in command of the rear guard. Zhao Yun was told to guard Liu Bei's family, while the others ordered the march of the people."

曹操連飲數盃，不覺沈醉，喚左右捧過筆硯，亦欲作銅雀臺詩。剛纔下筆，忽報：“東吳使華歆表奏劉備為荊州牧，孫權以妹嫁劉備，漢上九郡大半已屬備矣。”操聞之，手脚慌亂，投筆於地。程昱曰：“丞相在萬軍之中，矢石交攻之際，未嘗動心；今聞劉備得了荊州，何故如此失驚？”操曰：“劉備，人中之龍也，生平未嘗得水。今得荊州，是困龍入大海矣。孤安得不動心哉！”程昱曰：“丞相知華歆來意否？”操曰：“未知。”昱曰：“孫權本忌劉備，欲以兵攻之；但恐丞相乘虛而擊，故令華歆為使，表薦劉備。乃安備之心，以塞丞相之望耳。”操點頭曰：“是也。”昱曰：“某有一計，使孫、劉自相吞併，丞相乘間圖之，一鼓而二敵俱破。”操大喜，遂問其計。程昱曰：“東吳所倚者，周瑜也。丞相今表奏周瑜為南郡太守、程普為江夏太守，留華歆在朝重用之；瑜必自與劉備為讎敵矣。我乘其相併而圖之，不亦善乎？”操曰：“仲德之言，正合孤意。”遂召華歆上臺，重加賞賜。當日筵散，操卽引文武回許昌，表奏周瑜為總領南郡太守、程普為江夏太守。封華歆為大理少卿，留在許都。使命至東吳，周瑜、程普各受職訖。,"Cao Cao drank several cups in a row, and he was intoxicated without realizing it. Just now when I wrote, I suddenly reported: ""Hua Xin made Liu Bei the shepherd of Jingzhou, and Sun Quan married Liu Bei with his younger sister, and most of the nine commanderies in Han Dynasty are ready."" Cheng Yu said: ""The prime minister was among the ten thousand armies, and when the arrows and stones attacked, he was not moved. Now that I heard that Liu Bei had won Jingzhou, why was he so startled?"" To gain Jingzhou, it is a trapped dragon entering the sea. I won’t be moved by the peace!” Cheng Yu said, “Does the prime minister know what Hua Xin’s coming?” Cao said, “I don’t know.” Yu said, “Sun Quan was jealous of Liu Bei, and he wanted to attack with troops. However, I was afraid that the Prime Minister would take advantage of the weakness and attack, so Hua Xin was appointed as the envoy to express his recommendation to Liu Bei. This is because of his peace of mind, so as to prevent the Prime Minister's ears."" Cao nodded and said, ""Yes."" Yu said, ""Someone has a plan. , so that Sun and Liu Zi were annexed by each other, and the prime ministers multiplied each other, and the two enemies were defeated with one drum."" Cao was overjoyed and asked his plan. Cheng Yu said: ""The one that Eastern Wu relies on is also Zhou Yu. The prime minister now declares that Zhou Yu is the prefect of Nanjun, and Cheng Pu is the prefect of Jiangxia, and he will be used by Huaxin in the dynasty; Yu will definitely be the enemy of Liu Bei. Wouldn’t it be good to compare them with each other?” Cao said, “Zhongde’s words are exactly what he wanted.” He summoned Hua Xin to power and gave him more rewards. On the same day, the banquet was over, and he returned to Xuchang with a slogan, citing Wen and Wu, and played Zhou Yu as the commander-in-chief of Nanjun and Cheng Pu as the prefect of Jiangxia. Feng Huaxin was appointed Shaoqing of Dali and stayed in Xudu. The mission went to Soochow, and Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu each received their posts.","This shatters Cao Cao’s aplomb, and he erupts with fury. Asked by Cheng Yu why this news so upsets him, Cao Cao says, ‘Xuande is truly a dragon standing in the midst of everyone else. However, he’s not until now been able to find his true destiny. Now he’s like a dragon released into the ocean. That’s why I am troubled!’ Cheng Yu says, ‘All this is a plot by Sun Quan to get you to attack Xuande, because he too fears Xuande. He wants you to take him on so he can win by divide and rule. But I’ve a plan to outwit them both and turn Sun and Xuande upon each other.’ His plot is to have Zhou Yu given a senior appointment as governor of Nanjun, elevate Cheng Pu as governor of Jiangxia and give Hua Xin a post of honour at court.","After this oration Cao Cao drank many cups of wine in quick succession till he became very intoxicated. He bade his servants bring him brush and inkstone that he might compose a poem. But as he was beginning to write, they announced, “The Marquis of Wu has sent Hua Xin as an envoy and presented a memorial to appoint Liu Bei Imperial Protector of Jingzhou. Sun Quan's sister is now Liu Bei's wife, while on the River Han, the greater part of the nine territories is under Liu Bei's rule.” Cao Cao was seized with quaking fear at the news and threw the pen on the floor. Cheng Yu said to him, “O Prime Minister, you have been among fighting soldiers by myriads and in danger from stones and arrows many a time and never quailed. Now the news that Liu Bei has got possession of a small tract of country throws you into a panic. Why is it thus?” Cao Cao replied, “Liu Bei is a dragon among humans. All his life hitherto he has never found his element, but now that he has obtained Jingzhou; it is as if the dragon, once captive, had escaped to the mighty deep. There is good reason for me to quake with fear.” “Do you know the reason of the coming of Hua Xin?” said Cheng Yu. “No; I know not,” said the Prime Minister. “Liu Bei is Sun Quan's one terror, and Sun Quan would attack Liu Bei were it not for you, O Prime Minister. Sun Quan feels you would fall upon him while he was smiting his enemy. Wherefore he has taken this means of calming Liu Bei's suspicions and fears and at the same time directing your enmity toward Liu Bei and from himself.” Cao Cao nodded; “Yes,” he said. Cheng Yu continued, “Now this is my plan to set Sun Quan and Liu Bei at one another and give you the opportunity to destroy both; it can be done easily.” “What is your plan?” asked Cao Cao. “The one prop of the South Land is Zhou Yu; remove it by memorializing that Zhou Yu be appointed Governor of Nanjun. Then get Cheng Pu made Governor of Jiangxia, and cause the Emperor to retain this Hua Xin in the capital to await some important post. Zhou Yu will assuredly attack Liu Bei, and that will be our chance. Is not the scheme good?” “Friend Cheng Yu, you are a man after my own heart.” Wherefore Cao Cao summoned the emissary from the South Land and overwhelmed him with gifts. That day was the last of the feastings and merry-makings; and Cao Cao, with all the company, returned to the capital where he forthwith presented a memorial assigning Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu to the governorships of Nanjun and Jiangxia, and Hua Xin was retained at the capital with a post of ministry. The messenger bearing the commissions for their new offices went down to the South Land, and both Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu accepted the appointments."

衆官席散，操只留王子服等四人夜宴。四人魂不附體，只得留待。操曰：“本不相留，爭奈有事相問。汝四人不知與董承商議何事？”子服曰：“並未商議甚事。”操曰：“白絹中寫着何事？”子服等皆隱諱。操敎喚出慶童對證。子服曰：“汝於何處見來？”慶童曰：“你迴避了衆人，六人在一處畫字，如何賴得？”子服曰：“此賊與國舅侍妾通奸，被責誣主，不可聽也。”操曰：“吉平下毒，非董承所使而誰？”子服等皆言不知。操曰：“今晚自首，尚猶可恕；若待事發，其實難容！”子服等皆言並無此事。操叱左右將四人拏住監禁。,"The official banquet was scattered, and only the prince's clothes were left for the evening banquet for four people. The four souls were not possessed, so they had to stay. Cao said: ""I don't want to stay with each other, but I have something to ask each other. You four don't know what to discuss with Dong Cheng?"" Zifu said, ""I haven't discussed anything."" Cao said, ""What is written on the white silk?"" Sub clothes and so on are all hidden. Cao Cao called out Qingtong to testify. Zifu said, ""Where did you meet me?"" Qingtong said, ""You avoided the crowd, and the six of you were painting in one place, how could you be relied upon?"" Zifu said, ""This thief committed adultery with his uncle and his concubine. If you are accused of falsely accusing the master, you should not listen to him."" Cao said, ""Ji Ping's poison was not ordered by Dong Cheng, but who?"" Zifu and the others all said nothing. Cao said: ""Tonight's surrender is still forgivable; if the incident happens, it's really hard to bear!"" Zifu and the others all said that there was no such thing. The four people were held and imprisoned.","Why don’t you just finish me off?’ ‘There were six original conspirators, weren’t there?’ says Cao Cao. ‘And you became the seventh.’ But Ji Ping continues to deny this, while the four conspirators in the room stare with horror and deepening fear. Despite continued beatings, Ji Ping holds to his statement that he is alone in this, and eventually Cao Cao has him dragged away. Dismissing the other officials, he orders just the four conspirators to stay behind. Imagine their terror! Then the slave Qin Qingtong is brought in. Wang Zifu tries to discredit the slave by pointing out that he is a runaway and therefore unreliable. But Cao Cao points out that the slave told him about Ji Ping, and this has proved to be true. So saying, he gives orders for the imprisonment of the four officials.","At the close of the banquet, when the guests were dispersing, four of them, the four conspirators, were invited to remain behind to supper. They were terrified so that their souls seemed no longer to inhabit their bodies, but there was no saying nay to the invitation. Presently Cao Cao said, “Still there is something I want to speak about, so I have asked you to stay for a time longer. I do not know what you four have been arranging with Dong Cheng.” “Nothing at all,” said Wang Zifu. “And what is written on the white silk?” asked Cao Cao. They all said they knew nothing about it. Then Cao Cao ordered the runaway servant to be brought in. As soon as Quin Quington came, Wang Zifu said, “Well, what have you seen and where?” Quin Quington replied, “You five very carefully chose retired places to talk in, and you secretly signed a white roll. You cannot deny that.” Wang Zifu replied, “This miserable creature was punished for misbehavior with one of Uncle Dong Cheng's maids, and now because of that he slanders his master. You must not listen to him.” “Ji Ping tried to pour poison down my throat. Who told him to do that if it was not Dong Cheng?” said Cao Cao. They all said they knew nothing about who it was. “So far,” said Cao Cao, “matters are only beginning, and there is a chance of forgiveness. But if the thing grows, it will be difficult not to take notice of it.” The whole four vigorously denied that any plot existed. However Cao Cao called up his henchmen, and the four men were put into confinement."

I have enlisted expert archers and strong bowmen. In Bingzhou my armies have crossed the Taihang Range, and in Qingzhou they have forded River Ji and River Ta. They have coasted down the Yellow River to attack his van, and from Jingzhou the armies of Liu Biao have descended to Wancheng and Wangye to smite his rearguard.

且說袁紹見玄德不回，大怒，欲起兵伐之。郭圖曰：“劉備不足慮。曹操乃勁敵也，不可不除。劉表雖據荊州，不足為強。江東孫伯符威鎮三江，地連六郡，謀臣武士極多，可使人結之，共攻曹操。”紹從其言，卽修書遣陳震為使，來會孫策。正是：,"Moreover, Yuan Shao was furious when he saw that Xuande would not return, and wanted to attack him. Guo Tu said: ""Liu Bei has nothing to worry about. Cao Cao is a formidable enemy, and he must be eliminated. Although Liu Biao is based in Jingzhou, he is not strong enough. Jiangdong Sun Bo Fuwei Town Sanjiang, the land is connected to six counties, there are many advisors and warriors, and people can form a relationship with him. Let’s attack Cao Cao together.” Shao Cong said, and Xiu Shushu sent Chen Zhen as his envoy to meet Sun Ce. Exactly:","Once Yuan Shao realizes he has been tricked into letting Xuande and Jian Yong go, he is determined to have his revenge. But his counsellor Guo Tu, who advised against letting either Xuande or Jian Yong go, now advises him to ignore Xuande. ‘You need now to focus on the greater threat of Cao Cao. To overcome him, I suggest that you create a new alliance. This time with Sun Ce to the south of the Great River, in the southlands of the Three Rivers with its six districts. Join with him to attack Cao Cao,’ says Guo Tu, and, following his advice, Yuan Shao sends Chen Zhen to speak for him. The warrior from the north has gone;","Yuan Shao was much annoyed when Liu Bei did not return and at first was for sending a force after him. However Guo Tu dissuaded him. “Liu Bei needs cause you no anxiety; Cao Cao is your one enemy and must be destroyed. Even Liu Biao, though strongly posted on the river, is none too terrible. There is Sun Ce on the southeast of the Great River, strong, feared, with wide domain of six territories, a large army, and able counselors and leaders; you should make an alliance there against Cao Cao.” Guo Tu won his chief to his view and wrote to Sun Ce, sending the letter by Chen Zhen. Just as one warrior leaves the north,"
金風——西風、秋風。古人以所謂“五行”（金、木、水、火、土）配四方（實際指四方加“中方”）和四時（實際指四時加“四季月”），西方和秋天屬金，所以西風、秋風，也可以叫做金風。,"Golden wind - west wind, autumn wind.

寫畢，遞與周瑜曰：“此都督病源也。”瑜見了大驚，暗思：“孔明眞神人也！早已知我心事！只索以實情告之。”乃笑曰：“先生已知我病源，將用何藥治之？事在危急，望卽賜敎。”孔明曰：“亮雖不才，曾遇異人，傳授奇門遁甲天書，可以呼風喚雨。都督若要東南風時，可於南屏山建一臺，名曰‘七星壇’：高九尺，作三層，用一百二十人，手執旗旛圍遶。亮於臺上作法，借三日三夜東南大風，助都督用兵，何如？”瑜曰：“休道三日三夜，只一夜大風，大事可成矣。只是事在目前，不可遲緩。”孔明曰：“十一月二十日甲子祭風，至二十二日丙寅風息，如何？”瑜聞言大喜，矍然而起。便傳令差五百精壯軍士，往南屏山築壇；撥一百二十人，執旗守壇，聽候使令。,"After writing it, he handed it over to Zhou Yu and said, ""This is the source of the disease."" Yu was shocked when he saw it, and thought to himself, ""Kong Ming is a genius! He already knew what I was thinking! I just told the truth."" He smiled and said, ""Mr. Knowing the source of my illness, what medicine will I use to treat it? The matter is in critical condition, and I hope you will teach me."" Kong Ming said: ""Although Liang is not talented, he has met strangers and taught Qimen Dunjia Heavenly Book, which can call for wind and rain. If the governor wants the southeast wind, , you can build a platform in Nanping Mountain, called 'Seven Stars Altar': nine feet high, three floors, surrounded by 120 people, holding flags and flags. Great wind, how about helping the governor to use his troops?"" Yu said, ""Retire the road for three days and three nights, with only one night of strong wind, the great event can be accomplished. But the matter is now, so don't delay."" Kong Ming said: ""November 20th Jiazi sacrifices to the wind, how about the wind in Bingyin on the 22nd day?"" Yu heard that she was overjoyed, and got up. They sent orders to send 500 elite soldiers to build an altar on Nanping Mountain; 120 people were dispatched to guard the altar with flags and wait for orders.","Zhou Yu is once again astonished and fearful of the unerring powers of Kong Ming and says, ‘So you know what troubles me. What remedy can you offer, and quickly too?’ ‘I’ve little in the way of skills,’ says Kong Ming, ‘but I did learn from some magic books how to command the winds and call down rain. If we’re going to need a southeasterly wind I’ll need a special altar built – the Altar of the Seven Stars – and this must be built on Nanping mountain, nine feet high, with three levels and surrounded by one hundred and twenty men carrying banners. With this I should be able to create a wind that will blow for three days and nights. Will that do?’ And Zhou Yu agrees that this will more than do but it must happen quickly. He then rises, his sickness cured, and orders that Kong Ming be supplied with whatever he needs. So Kong Ming travels with his workforce of five hundred men and the one hundred and twenty banner carriers, and with Lu Su he starts work on creating the altar on Nanping mountain.","This he gave to the sick general, saying, “That is the origin of your illness.” Zhou Yu read the words with great surprise, and it confirmed his secret opinion that Zhuge Liang really was rather more than human. He decided that the only course was to be open and tell him all. So he said, “Since you know the cause of the disease, what do you recommend as treatment? The need of a remedy is very urgent.” “I have no great talent,” said Zhuge Liang, “but I have had to do with humans of no ordinary gifts from whom I have received certain magical books called Concealing Method. I can call the winds and summon the rains. Since you need a southeast breeze, General, you must build an altar on the Nanping Mountains, the Altar of the Seven Stars. It must be nine spans high, with three steps, surrounded by a guard of one hundred and twenty humans bearing flags. On this altar I will work a spell to procure a strong southeast gale for three days and three nights. Do you approve?” “Never mind three whole days;” said Zhou Yu, “one day of strong wind will serve my purpose. But it must be done at once and without delay.” “I will sacrifice for a wind for three days from the twentieth day of the moon; will that suit you?” Zhou Yu was delighted and hastily rose from his couch to give the necessary orders. He commanded that five hundred men should be sent to the mountains to build the altar, and he told off the guard of one hundred and twenty to bear the flags and be at the orders of Zhuge Liang."
公沈吟曰：“汝說我有三罪，欲我如何？”遼曰：“今四面皆曹公之兵，兄若不降，則必死；徒死無益，不若且降曹公；却打聽劉使君音信，如知何處，卽往投之。一者可以保二夫人，二者不背桃園之約，三者可留有用之身：有此三便，兄宜詳之。”公曰：“兄言三便，吾有三約。若丞相能從，我卽當卸甲；如其不允，吾寧受三罪而死。”遼曰：“丞相寬洪大量，何所不容？願聞三事。”公曰：“一者，吾與皇叔設誓，共扶漢室，吾今只降漢帝，不降曹操；二者，二嫂處請給皇叔俸祿養贍，一應上下人等，皆不許到門；三者，但知劉皇叔去向，不管千里萬里，便當辭去：三者缺一，斷不肯降。望文遠急急回報。”張遼應諾，遂上馬，回見曹操，先說降漢不降曹之事。操笑曰：“吾為漢相，漢卽吾也。此可從之。”遼又言：“二夫人欲請皇叔俸給，并上下人等不許到門。”操曰：“吾於皇叔俸內，更加倍與之。至於嚴禁內外，乃是家法，又何疑焉？”遼又曰：“但知玄德信息，雖遠必往。”操搖首曰：“然則吾養雲長何用？此事却難從。”遼曰：“豈不聞豫讓衆人國士之論乎？劉玄德待雲長不過恩厚耳。丞相更施厚恩以結其心，何憂雲長之不服也？”操曰：“文遠之言甚當，吾願從此三事。”,"Duke Shen said: ""You said that I have three crimes, what do you want me to do?"" Liao said: ""Now there are soldiers of Duke Cao on all sides. If my brother does not surrender, he will die. It is useless to die, it is better to surrender to Duke Cao; , if you know where to go, go to cast it. One can protect the second wife, the two do not break the pact in Taoyuan, and the third can keep a useful body: there are these three conveniences, brother should pay attention to it.” The public said: “Brother If the Prime Minister can obey, I will remove my armor; if not, I would rather suffer three crimes and die."" Liao said, ""The Prime Minister is generous and generous, why would you not tolerate it? I would like to hear about three things. The duke said: ""One, I have sworn an oath with the uncle to support the Han family, and now I will only surrender the emperor of the Han, not Cao Cao; the other, the second sister-in-law, please provide the uncle's salary and support, and one should be the upper and lower people, etc. All three are not allowed to come to the door; for the three, if they know where Uncle Liu is going, no matter how many miles away, they should resign: if one of the three is missing, they will not surrender. I hope Wenyuan will return in a hurry."" Zhang Liao agreed, mounted his horse, and returned to Cao Cao. , Let me first talk about the matter of surrendering Han but not Cao Cao. Cao laughed and said: ""I am the Prime Minister of the Han, and I am also the Han. I can follow this."" Liao also said: ""The second lady wants to ask the emperor's uncle to pay, and the upper and lower people are not allowed to come to the door."" Cao said: ""I am in the emperor's house. Inside the uncle’s salary, it is even more so. As for the strict prohibition of inside and outside, it is a family law, so why should you doubt it?” Liao also said: “But if you know the information of Xuande, you must go even if you are far away.” Cao shook his head and said, “Then I raise What is the use of Yunchang? This matter is difficult to follow."" Liao said: ""Don't you hear the argument that Yu has made the people of the country? Liu Xuande treats Yunchang with kindness. Don’t you agree?” Cao said, “Wen Yuan’s words are very worthy, and I wish to do three things from now on.”","Now what do you want me to do about that?’ ‘Submit,’ says Zhang Liao. ‘You are surrounded. If you submit you’ll have three advantages. You can protect Xuande’s ladies; you will be faithful to the vow you made in the peach orchard; and finally you will still be alive!’ ‘You have given your three advantages, now I have three conditions. Firstly, as a defender of the Han, I will only surrender to the emperor, not to Cao Cao. Secondly, I must have total control over how my sisters-in-law are to be protected. Thirdly, whenever I find out where Xuande is, I will be free to go to him.’ When Zhang Liao reports back to Cao Cao, he doesn’t want to agree to the third condition.","Then he said, “You have spoken of my three faults. What do you desire?” “You are surrounded with the certainty of death if you do not yield. There is no advantage in a useless death. Wherefore your best course is to yield to Cao Cao till you hear news of Liu Bei and can rejoin him. Thus you will ensure the safety of the two ladies and also keep inviolate the Peach Garden compact. You will preserve a useful life. Brother, you must reflect on these things.” “Brother, you have spoken of three advantages; now I have three conditions. If the Prime Minister concede these, then will I doff my armor. If he refuses, then I prefer to be guilty of the three faults and die.” “Why should the Prime Minister not concede them? He is most liberal and large minded. I pray you let me hear your conditions.” “The first is that as I and the Imperial Uncle have sworn to support the Hans, I now submit to the Emperor and not to His Prime Minister Cao Cao. The second condition is that suitable provision be made for the two ladies under my care and that no one shall be allowed to approach them. The third is that I shall be allowed to set off to rejoin Uncle Liu Bei so soon as I shall hear where he is, whether it be far or near. I require all these to be satisfied; failing a single one, I will not submit. Wherefore, Zhang Liao, I pray you hasten back and announce them.” Zhang Liao lost no time but rode back to Cao Cao. When he spoke of Guan Yu's intention to submit to the Hans but not to Cao Cao, the latter laughed, saying, “As I am the Minister of Han, so am I Han. I grant that.” Zhang Liao then spoke of provision due to their rank and security from molestation for the ladies, to which Cao Cao replied, “I will give them twice the regular amount for an Uncle of the Emperor; as for securing them from molestation, that is simple. The ordinary domestic law is enough. Why should there be any doubt?” Then said Zhang Liao, “Whenever he shall get news of the whereabouts of Liu Bei, he must go to him.” At this Cao Cao shook his head, saying, “Then I am merely to feed Guan Yu; what is the use of this? I cannot consent.” Zhang Liao replied, “You must know of Yu Rang's saying: the difference in behavior brought about by difference of treatment? Liu Bei treats Guan Yu just kindly and liberally; you can surely engage Guan Yu's heart and support by being kinder and more liberal.” “What you say is much to the point. I will grant the three conditions,” said Cao Cao."

Ci smiled and said, ""I don't know."" Ce laughed, please enter the tent, invite you to sit on the table, and hold a banquet. Hospitality. Ci said: ""Liu Jun is newly broken, and the soldiers are disaffected. A certain person wants to clean up the rest of the people to help Ming Gong. Can you believe it?"" Ce Qi Xie said: ""This is a sincere policy. , I hope that the Duke will come and pay back."" Ci answered the promise and left. The generals said, ""Tai Shi Ci will never come here."" Ce said, ""Ziyi is a man of faith and righteousness, and he will never turn his back on me."" All of them did not believe him. The next day, stand at the camp gate to wait for the shadow of the sun. Just in the middle of the day, Taishi Ci led more than a thousand people to the village. Sun Ce was overjoyed. Everyone is obedient. So Sun Ce gathered tens of thousands of people and went down to the east of the Yangtze River. The people of Jiangdong are all called ""Sun Lang"". But when they heard that Sun Lang's troops were coming, they all fled. When the army arrives, no one is allowed to plunder, the chickens and dogs are not alarmed, and the people are happy, and the army is brought to the village with ox and wine. The policy answered him with gold and silk, and there were cheers everywhere. Liu Yao's old army was willing to obey the army, but he was unwilling to give rewards to the army and return to the farmers. People in the south of the Yangtze River are all praised. Because the army is prosperous. Ce Nai welcomed his mother, uncle and all the younger brothers to Qu A, and sent his younger brothers Sun Quan and Zhou Tai to guard Xuancheng. Policy led troops south to take Wu County.","‘If you had captured me when we fought by the temple,’ asks Sun Ce, ‘would you have killed me?’ To this Taishi replies, ‘I really don’t know!’ Laughing at this, Sun Ce invites him to dine with him. Moved by this virtuous man, Taishi Ci says, ‘Liu Yao’s troops are disheartened and divided. If you’ll trust me, I can go and bring them over to your side.’ And sure enough, Sun Ce does trust him, and Taishi Ci recruits thousands of the enemy troops to join Sun Ce. Moving across the river into the south, Sun Ce’s army at first spreads panic and chaos, but soon people see that this army never steals anything, nor harms any of the ordinary folk.","Sun Ce seized his hand and said, laughing, “If you had taken me at that fight we had near the shrine, would you have killed me?” “Who can say?” said Taishi Ci smiling. Sun Ce laughed also and they entered his tent, where Taishi Ci was placed in the seat of honor at a banquet. Taishi Ci said, “Can you trust me so far as to let me go to muster as many as I can of the soldiers of my late master. Under the smart of this defeat they will turn against him, and they would be a great help to you.” “Exactly what I most desire. I will make an agreement with you that at midday tomorrow you will return.” Taishi Ci agreed and went off. All the generals said he would never return. “He is trustworthy and will not break his word,” said the chief. None of the officers believed he would come back. But the next day they set up a bamboo rod in the gate of the camp, and just as the shadow marked noon Taishi Ci returned, bringing with him about a thousand troops. Sun Ce was pleased, and his officers had to confess that he had rightly judged his man. Sun Ce thus marched his army to the South Land, and his enemies fled or surrendered before his force. He had now several legions and the southeast of the Great River was his. He improved the conditions of the people and maintained order so that his adherents and supporters daily increased. He was called Sun Ce the Bright. When his army approached, the people used to flee in terror; but when it had arrived and they saw that no one was permitted to loot and not the least attempt was made on their houses, they rejoiced and presented the soldiers with oxen and wine, for which they were in turn duly rewarded. Gladness filled the country side. The soldiers who had followed Liu Yao were kindly treated. Those who wished to join Sun Ce's army did so; those who preferred not to be soldiers were sent home with presents. And thus Sun Ce won the respect and praise of every one and became very powerful. Sun Ce then settled his mother and the remainder of the family in Que, setting his brother, Sun Quan, and Zhou Tai over the city of Xuancheng. Then he headed an expedition to the south to reduce Wujun."
六月，何進暗使人鴆殺董后於河間驛庭，舉柩回京，葬於文陵。進託病不出，司隸校尉袁紹入見進曰：“張讓、段珪等流言於外，言公鴆殺董后，欲謀大事。乘此時不誅閹宦，後必為大禍。昔竇武欲誅內豎，機謀不密，反受其殃。今公兄弟部曲將吏，皆英俊之士；若使盡力，事在掌握。此天贊之時，不可失也。”進曰：“且容商議。”左右密報張讓，讓等轉告何苗，又多送賄賂。苗入奏何后云：“大將軍輔佐新君，不行仁慈，專務殺伐。今無端又欲殺十常侍，此取亂之道也。”后納其言。少頃，何進入白后，欲誅中涓。何后曰：“中官統領禁省，漢家故事。先帝新棄天下，爾欲誅殺舊臣，非重宗廟也。”進本是沒決斷之人，聽太后言，唯唯而出。袁紹迎問曰：“大事若何？”進曰：“太后不允，如之奈何？”紹曰：“可召四方英雄人士，勒兵來京，盡誅閹豎。此時事急，不容太后不從。”進曰：“此計大妙！”便發檄至各鎮，召赴京師。主簿陳琳曰：“不可！俗云：‘掩目而捕燕雀’，是自欺也。微物尚不可欺以得志，況國家大事乎？今將軍仗皇威，掌兵要，龍驤虎步，高下在心：若欲誅宦官，如鼓洪爐燎毛髮耳。但當速發雷霆，行權立斷，則天人順之。却反外檄大臣，臨犯京闕，英雄聚會，各懷一心：所謂倒持干戈，授人以柄，功必不成，反生亂矣。”何進笑曰：“此懦夫之見也！”傍邊一人鼓掌大笑曰：“此事易如反掌，何必多議！”視之，乃曹操也。正是：,"In June, He Jin secretly sent people to kill Dong Hou in the Hejian Yiting, lift the coffin back to Beijing, and be buried in Wenling. When Jin Tuo did not get sick, Yuan Shao, the captain of the Sili school, came to Jin and said: ""There are rumors such as Zhang Rang, Duan Gui and others, saying that the Duke's Poison killed Queen Dong and wanted to do something big. Take advantage of this time not to punish the eunuch, and there will be a big disaster in the future. In the past, Dou Wu wanted to kill Neizhi, but he was not secretive, but he suffered from it. Today, the public and the brothers and the generals and officials are all handsome men; Jin said, ""Let's discuss."" The left and right secretly reported to Zhang Rang, and Rang waited to tell He Miao, and sent more bribes. Miao Jin played He Houyun: ""The generals assist the new emperor, do not show mercy, and specialize in killing. Now I want to kill the ten permanent servants for no reason. This is the way of chaos."" He later accepted his words. After a short while, He entered Bai Hou and wanted to be punished. The Empress He said: ""The middle officials command the forbidden province, the story of the Han family. The first emperor abandoned the world, and you want to kill the old ministers, not the temple."" Jinben was an undecided person. Yuan Shaoying asked, ""What's the big deal?"" Jin said, ""The Queen Mother refuses to allow it, so what should I do?"" Shao said, ""You can call heroes from all over the world, force soldiers to come to Beijing, and kill the eunuchs as much as possible. The matter is urgent at this time, and the Queen Mother cannot be ignored. Follow."" Jin said, ""This is a great plan!"" Then he sent orders to the towns and summoned them to the capital. The chief clerk Chen Lin said: ""No! It is common to say: 'covering one's eyes and catching the bird's sparrow' is self-deception. Small things can't be deceived to gain ambition, what about national affairs? Step, high and low: If you want to punish eunuchs, it's like a drum and a furnace burning your ears. But when thunder is quick, and you exercise power decisively, then the gods and people will obey. But against foreign ministers, when they commit crimes in Jingque, heroes gather, each Huai Yixin: The so-called upside-down fighting, giving people a handle, the merit will not succeed, but instead will lead to chaos."" He Jin laughed and said, ""This is a coward's view!"" A person nearby clapped and laughed and said, ""This matter is easy, why bother. Discuss!"" Seeing it, it was Cao Cao. Exactly:","In the confusion Empress Dong, the dead emperor’s mother, tries to reassert her power but fails, because the Ten Eunuchs do not support her. She is sent off to the countryside, where she is murdered six months later. Yuan Shao still wants to exact revenge on the eunuchs, but Grand Administrator He Jin opposes this for the simple reason that the new emperor’s mother, Empress He, his sister, is against it. ‘Who cares?’ shouts General Yuan Shao. ‘Let’s summon the brave men of the land and storm the capital, killing those eunuchs!’ This time Grand Administrator He Jin is swayed by Yuan Shao’s enthusiasm and sends forth the order to summon the troops. And the person who supports him, while others stand against him, is Cao Cao, who says something that changes the tide of the destiny of the Han dynasty. As the saying goes, ‘Wise advice can counter the influence of treacherous officials, if and when it is heeded.’ So what is it that Cao Cao said?","Her remains were brought to the capital and buried in Wen Tombs. He Jin feigned illness and did not attend the funeral. Commander Yuan Shao went one day to see He Jin, saying, “The two eunuchs, Zhang Rang and Duan Gui, are spreading the report outside that you has caused the death of the late empress and is aiming at the throne. This is an excuse for you to destroy them. Do not spare them this time, or you will pay like Dou Wu and Chen Fan, who in the previous reign missed their chance because the secret had not been kept, and they paid by their own deaths. Now you and your brother have many commanders and officers behind, so that the destruction of the eunuchs can be but an ease. It is a heaven-sent opportunity. Delay no further!” But He Jin replied, “Let me think it over.” He Jin's servants overheard the discussion and secretly informed the intended victims, who sent further gifts to the younger brother He Miao. Corrupted by these, he went in to speak with his sister Empress He and said, “The General is the chief support of the new Emperor, yet he is not gracious and merciful but thinks wholly of slaughter. If he slays the eunuchs without cause, it may bring about revolution.” Soon after He Jin entered and told her of his design to put the eunuchs to death. She argued with him, “Those officials look after palace affairs and are old servants. To kill the old servants just after the death of their master would appear disrespectful to the dynasty's ancestral temple.” And as He Jin was of a vacillating mind, he murmured assent and left her. “What about it?” said Yuan Shao on meeting him. “She will not consent; what can be done?” “Call up an army and slay them; it is imperative. Never mind her consent.” “That is an excellent plan,” said He Jin. And he sent orders all round to march soldiers to the capital. But Counselor Chen Lin objected, “Nay; do not act blindly. The proverb says 'To cover the eyes and snatch at swallows is to fool oneself.' If in so small a matter you cannot attain your wish with covered eyes, what of great affairs? Now by virtue of the imperial prestige and with the army under your hand you may do as you please. To use such enormous powers against the eunuchs would resemble lighting up a furnace to burn a hair. But act promptly; use your powers and smite at once, and all the empire will be with you. But to summon forces to the capital, to gather many bold persons into one spot, each with one's own schemes, is to turn our weapons against our own person, to place ourselves in the power of another. Nothing but failure can come of it, nothing but confusion.” “The view of a mere book-worm,” said He Jin with a smile. Then one of those about He Jin suddenly clapped his hands, laughing, “Solving this issue is as easy as turning over one's hand! Why so much talk?” The speaker was Cao Cao. Wouldst thou withdraw wicked people from thy prince's side"
肅領命而去。次日至館驛中見孔明，又囑曰：“今見我主，切不可言曹操兵多。”孔明笑曰：“亮自見機而變，決不有誤。”肅乃引孔明至幕下。早見張昭、顧雍等一班文武二十餘人，峨冠博帶，整衣端坐。孔明逐一相見，各問姓名。施禮已畢，坐於客位。張昭等見孔明丰神飄洒，器宇軒昂，料道此人必來游說。張昭先以言挑之曰：“昭乃江東微末之士，久聞先生高臥隆中，自比管、樂。此語果有之乎？”孔明曰：“此亮平生小可之比也。”昭曰：“近聞劉豫州三顧先生於草廬之中，幸得先生，以為如魚得水，思欲席捲荊襄。今一旦以屬曹操，未審是何主見？”孔明自思張昭乃孫權手下第一個謀士，若不先難倒他，如何說得孫灌，遂答曰：“吾觀取漢上之地，易如反掌。我主劉豫州躬行仁義，不忍奪同宗之基業，故力辭之，劉琮孺子，聽信佞言，暗自投降，致使曹操得以猖獗。今我主屯兵江夏，別有良圖，非等閒可知也。”昭曰：“若此，是先生言行相違也。先生自比管、樂：管仲相桓公，霸諸侯，一匡天下；樂毅扶持微弱之燕，下齊七十餘城；此二人者，眞濟世之才也。先生在草廬之中，但笑傲風月，抱膝危坐；今旣從事劉豫州，當為生靈興利除害，剿滅亂賊。且劉豫州未得先生之前，尚且縱橫寰宇，割據城池；今得先生，人皆仰望：雖三尺童蒙，亦謂彪虎生翼，將見漢室復興，曹氏卽滅矣；朝廷舊臣，山林隱士，無不拭目而待：以為拂高天之雲翳，仰日月之光輝，拯民於水火之中，措天下於袵席之上，在此時也。何先生自歸豫州，曹兵一出，棄甲拋戈，望風而竄；上不能報劉表以安庶民，下不能輔孤子而據疆土；乃棄新野，走樊城，敗當陽，奔夏口，無容身之地：是豫州旣得先生之後，反不如其初也。管仲、樂毅，果如是乎？愚直之言，幸勿見怪！”孔明聽罷，啞然而笑曰：“鵬飛萬里，其志豈羣鳥能識哉？譬如人染沈疴，當先用糜粥以飲之，和藥以服之；待其腑臟調和，形體漸安，然後用肉食以補之，猛藥以治之：則病根盡去，人得全生也。若不待氣脈和緩，便投以猛藥厚味，欲求安保，誠為難矣。吾主劉豫州，向日軍敗於汝南，寄跡劉表，兵不滿千，將止關、張、趙雲而已；此正如病勢尪羸已極之時也。新野山僻小縣，人民稀少，糧食鮮薄，豫州不過暫借以容身，豈眞將坐守於此耶？夫以甲兵不完，城郭不固，軍不經練，糧不繼日，然而博望燒屯，白河用水，使夏侯惇、曹仁輩心驚膽裂：竊謂管仲、樂毅之用兵，未必過此。至於劉琮降操，豫州實出不知；且又不忍乘亂奪同宗之基業，此眞大仁大義也。當陽之敗，豫州見有數十萬赴義之民，扶老攜幼相隨，不忍棄之，日行十里，不思進取江陵，甘與同敗，此亦大仁大義也。寡不敵衆，勝負乃其常事。昔高皇數敗於項羽，而垓下一戰成功，此非韓信之良謀乎？夫信久事高皇，未嘗累勝。蓋國家大計，社稷安危，是有主謀。非比誇辯之徒，虛譽欺人，坐議立談，無人可及；臨機應變，百無一能：誠為天下笑耳！”這一篇言語，說得張昭並無一言回答。,"Go away solemnly. The next day, when I went to the station to see Kong Ming, he said, ""When I see my lord now, I must not say that Cao Cao has many troops."" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""Liang sees opportunities and changes, and there is no mistake."" Su Nai led Kong Ming to the curtain. . I saw Zhang Zhao, Gu Yong and other more than 20 civil and military people, led by E Guanbo and sitting upright. Kong Ming met one by one and asked each of them their names. After the ceremony is over, sit in the guest seat. Zhang Zhao and the others saw Kong Mingfeng's god floating in the air, and his arrogance was high, and they expected that this person would come to lobby. Zhang Zhaoxian picked it up and said: ""Zhao is a scholar at the end of the Jiangdong Province. I have heard for a long time that Mr. Li is lying high in the middle, and he compares himself to pipe and music. Does this sentence really exist?"" Kong Ming said: ""This Liang's life is a small comparison."" Zhao said: ""I recently heard that Mr. Liu Yuzhou Sangu was in the grass hut. He was fortunate to have him. He thought that he was like a fish in water, and his thoughts swept Jingxiang. Now that he belongs to Cao Cao, what is his opinion before the trial?"" Kong Ming thought to himself that Zhang Zhao was Sun Quan's subordinate. The first counselor, if he didn't stumped him first, how could Sun Guan be able to say, he replied, ""I think it would be easy to take the land of the Han Dynasty. My lord Liu Yuzhou practiced benevolence and righteousness. The son of Liu Congru, listened to the words of Ning and surrendered in secret, which caused Cao Cao to become rampant. Now my master is stationing troops in Jiangxia, and there is no good plan, and it is not easy to know."" Zhao said: ""If this is the case, the words and deeds of the master are contrary. The master compares himself. Guan and Le: Duke Huan, the prime minister of Guan Zhong, dominates the feudal feudal lords and conquers the whole world; Le Yi supports the weak Yan and descends to more than seventy cities; these two people are truly talented in helping the world. Mr. is in the grass hut, but he is proud of the wind and moon , hugging his knees and sitting dangerously; today, he is engaged in Liu Yuzhou, and he should exterminate evil for the sake of life and profit, and exterminate rogue thieves. And before Liu Yuzhou won the master, it was still vertical and horizontal, and divided the city; , also known as a tiger with wings, will see the revival of the Han Dynasty, and the Cao clan will be wiped out; the old court officials, the hermits in the mountains and forests, all wait and see: they think that the clouds in the high sky, the brilliance of the sun and the moon, save the people from water and fire In the middle, the world is on the bench, and it is at this time. Mr. He returned to Yuzhou, and once Cao's troops came out, he abandoned his armor and threw his armies, and rushed to the wind; Territory; abandon Xinye, go to Fancheng, defeat Dangyang, go to Xiakou, and have no place to live: after Mr. Yuzhou, it is not as good as before. Guan Zhong, Le Yi, if so? Silly words, fortunately not Weird!"" After listening to Kong Ming, he laughed dumbly and said, ""Peng flying thousands of miles, how can a flock of birds know his ambition? For example, when a person gets sunken, he should first drink it with porridge, and then take it with medicine; Reconcile, the body gradually becomes stable, then use meat to supplement it, and use strong medicine to cure it: then the root of the disease will be gone, and the person will have a full life. If you don’t wait for the qi and pulse to relax, you will use strong medicine and strong flavor, and you want to be safe. It’s really difficult. Lord Liu Yuzhou, defeated the Japanese army in Runan, and sent Liu Biao to Liu Biao. The soldiers were less than 1,000, and they stopped Guan, Zhang, and Zhao Yun. This is just like the time when the disease was extremely sick. Xinye Mountain is a small county, the people are scarce, and the food is fresh. Bo, Yuzhou is only a temporary shelter, why is it true that the general will sit here? The army is not finished, the city is not strong, the army is not trained, and the food is not enough, but Bowang burns the village, and the White River uses water, so Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren The hearts of the generation are terrified: they say that Guan Zhong and Le Yi’s use of troops may not have exceeded this. As for Liu Cong’s surrender, Yuzhou did not know it; Seeing that there are hundreds of thousands of people who go to justice, support the old and bring the young to accompany them, they cannot bear to abandon them, they travel ten miles a day, do not think about making progress in Jiangling, and are willing to lose together. This is also a great benevolence and justice. In the past, Emperor Gao was defeated by Xiang Yu, but Gai succeeded in the next battle. Is this not Han Xin's good plan? Fu Xin has been with Gao Huang for a long time, and he has not won many times. He has a master plan for the country's plan, and the safety of the community. , false reputation deceives others, sits and talks, no one can reach; , Incomparable: Sincerity is the world's laughing ear! ""This sentence, said Zhang Zhao without a word to answer.","The next day Kong Ming is brought to meet some twenty of Sun Quan’s advisers, led by Zhang Zhao. What follows is nothing less than an inquisition of Kong Ming by the advisers. Zhang Zhao goes first, asking why, if Xuande is so pleased to have secured Kong Ming’s services, he has lost all the lands around Jingzhou and Xiangyang. Kong Ming knows that Zhang Zhao is the most important of Sun Quan’s advisers and that unless he can convince him all is lost. He replies carefully, only to have Zhang Zhao accuse him of being nothing more than an irrelevant hermit, before whose arrival Xuande was seen as the great hero. Now he is in flight, unable to protect his lands. Using the metaphor of treating a man who is seriously ill, Kong Ming rebukes Zhang Zhao: ‘How can a simple bird understand the roc, who can fly ten thousand miles without tiring? When someone is ill, you first have to build up his strength with simple, plain food and medicine. Then you give him meat and more powerful drugs to bring him back to full health. Too much too soon will harm the patient. ‘Yes, Xuande was defeated at Runan and had to find sanctuary with Liu Biao because he had so few soldiers – in fact just three officers. Xinye was a stopping place, basic and without resources. But from there we destroyed Cao Cao’s camps at Bowang, then we flooded his army at the river and finally we scared off his key generals. Not bad really! ‘Xuande didn’t know about Liu Zong’s disgraceful surrender and was far too honourable to take advantage of that. He is, as you know, followed by a vast crowd of ordinary folk whom he refuses to abandon, even though it makes things far, far more difficult. What an example of his virtue! ‘Remember, the founder of the Han dynasty, Gao Zu, was defeated many times but eventually he overcame his great foe, aided by his adviser Han Xin. It’s true Gao Zu and Han Xin weren’t always successful. But then real success relies upon a grand vision and plan, not the usual nonsense that over-confident armchair generals and pompous academics spout who can’t actually deal with the realities on the ground!’ That shuts Zhang Zhao up!","With these instructions Lu Su retired. Next day he went to the guest-house and conveyed Sun Quan's commands to the guest, particularly saying, “When you see my master, say nothing of the magnitude of Cao Cao's army.” Zhuge Liang smiled, saying, “I shall act as circumstances dictate; you may be sure I shall make no mistakes.” Zhuge Liang was then conducted to where the high officers, civil and military to the number of forty and more, were assembled. They formed a dignified conclave as they sat in stately ranks with their tall headdresses and broad girdles. Zhang Zhao sat at the head, and Zhuge Liang first saluted him. Then, one by one, he exchange the formal courtesies with them all. This done he took his seat in the guest's chair. They, on their part, noted with interest Zhuge Liang's refined and elegant manner and his commanding figure, thinking within themselves, “Here is a persuader fitted for discourse.” Zhang Zhao led the way in trying to bait the visitor. He said, “You will pardon the most insignificant of our official circle, myself, if I mention that people say you compare yourself with those two famous men of talent, Guan Zhong and Yue Yi. Is there any truth in this?” “To a trifling extent I have compared myself with them,” replied Zhuge Liang. “I have heard that Liu Bei made three journeys to visit you when you lived in retirement in your simple dwelling in the Sleeping Dragon Ridge, and that when you consented to serve him, he said he was as lucky as a fish in getting home to the ocean. Then he desired to possess the region about Jingzhou. Yet today all that country belongs to Cao Cao. I should like to hear your account of all that.” Zhuge Liang thought, “This Zhang Zhao is Sun Quan's first adviser; and unless I can nonplus him, I shall never have a chance with his master.” So he replied, “In my opinion the taking of the region around the Han River was as simple as turning over one's hand. But my master Liu Bei is both righteous and humane and would not stoop to filching the possession of a member of his own house. So he refused the offer of succession. But Liu Zong, a stupid lad, misled by specious words, submitted to Cao Cao and fell victim to his ferocity. My master is in camp at Jiangxia, but what his future plans may be cannot be divulged at present.” Zhang Zhao said, “Be it so; but your words and your deeds are something discordant. You say you are the equal of the two famous ones. Well, Guan Zhong, as minister of Prince Huan, put his master at the very head of the feudal nobles, making his master's will supreme in all the land. Under the able statesmanship of Yue Yi, the feeble state of Yan conquered Qi, reducing nearly eighty of its cities. These two were men of most commanding and conspicuous talent. “When you lived in retirement, you smiled scornfully at ordinary people, passed your days in idleness, nursing your knees and posing in a superior manner, implying that if you had control of affairs, Liu Bei would be more than human; he should bring good to everybody and remove all evil; rebellion and robbery would be no more. Poor Liu Bei, before he obtained your help, was an outcast and a vagabond, stealing a city here and there where he could. With you to help him, he was to become the cynosure of every eye, and every lisping school child was to say that he was a tiger who had grown wings; the Hans were to be restored and Cao Cao and his faction exterminated; the good old days would be restored and all the people who had been driven into retirement by the corruption of political life would wake up, rub the sleep out of their eyes, and be in readiness to lift the cloud of darkness that covered the sky and gaze up at the glorious brilliancy of the sun and moon, to pull the people out of fire and water and put all the world to rest on a couch of comfort. That was all supposed to happen forthwith. “Why then, when you went to Xinye, did not Cao Cao's army throw aside their arms and armors and flee like rats? Why could you not have told Liu Biao how to give tranquillity to his people? Why could you not aid his orphan son to protect his frontiers? Instead you abandoned Xinye and fled to Fankou; you were defeated at Dangyang and fled to Xiakou with no place to rest in. Thus, after you had joined Liu Bei, he was worse off than before. Was it thus with Guan Zhong and Yue Yi? I trust you do not mind my blunt speech.” Zhuge Liang waited till Zhang Zhao had closed his oration, then laughed and said, “How can the common birds understand the long flight of the cranes? Let me use an illustration. A man has fallen into a terrible malady. First the physician must administer hashish, then soothing drugs until his viscera shall be calmed into harmonious action. When the sick man's body shall have been reduced to quietude, then may he be given strong meats to strengthen him and powerful drugs to correct the disorder. Thus the disease will be quite expelled, and the man restored to health. If the physician does not wait till the humors and pulse are in harmony, but throws in his strong drugs too early, it will be difficult to restore the patient. “My master suffered defeat at Runan and went to Liu Biao. He had then less than one thousand soldiers and only three generals—Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Yun. That was indeed a time of extreme weakness. Xinye was a secluded, rustic town with few inhabitants and scanty supplies, and my master only retired there as a temporary refuge. How could he even think of occupying and holding it? Yet, with insufficient force, in a weak city, with untrained men and inadequate supplies, we burned Xiahou Dun at Bowang Slope, drowned Cao Ren and Cao Hong and their army in the White River, and set them in terror as they fled. I doubt whether the two ancient heroes would have done any better. As to the surrender of Liu Zong, Liu Bei knew nothing of it. And he was too noble and too righteous to take advantage of a kinsman's straits to seize his inheritance. As for the defeat at Dangyang, it must be remembered that Liu Bei was hampered with a huge voluntary following of common people, with their aged relatives and their children, whom he was too humane to abandon. He never thought of taking Jiangling, but willingly suffered with his people. This is a striking instance of his magnanimity. “Small forces are no match for large armies. Victory and defeat are common episodes in every campaign. The great Founder of the Hans suffered many defeats at the hands of Xiang Yu, but Liu Bang finally conquered at Gaixia, and that battle was decisive. Was not this due to the strategy of Han Xin who, though he had long served his master Liu Bang, had never won a victory. Indeed real statesmanship and the restoration of stable government is a master plan far removed from the vapid discourses and debates of a lot of bragging babblers and specious and deceitful talkers, who, as they themselves say, are immeasureably superior to the rest of humankind but who, when it comes to deeds and decisions to meet the infinite and constant vicissitudes of affairs, fail to throw up a single capable person. Truly such people are the laughing stock of all the world.” Zhang Zhao found no reply to this diatribe. But another in the assembly lifted up his voice, saying, “"

幕府董統鷹揚，掃除兇逆。續遇董卓，侵官暴國，於是提劍揮鼓，發命東夏，收羅英雄，棄瑕取用。故遂與操同諮合謀，授以裨師；謂其鷹犬之才，爪牙可任。至乃愚佻短略，輕進易退；傷夷折衂，數喪師徒。幕府輒復分兵命銳，修完補輯，表行東郡領兗州刺史，被以虎文，獎（足戚）威柄，冀獲秦師一尅之報。而操遂承資跋扈，恣行凶忒，割剝元元，殘賢害善。,"The shogunate, Dong Tong Ying Yang, swept away the rebels. Continuing to meet Dong Zhuo, he invaded the government and violently invaded the country, so he took up the sword and played the drum, and ordered Dong Xia to collect heroes and use them. Therefore, he conspired with Cao Tongzi, and gave him a mentor; he said that he was a hawk and dog, and his minions could be arbitrary. Even the foolish and short, easy to advance and easy to retreat; to hurt the barbarians, to lose several teachers and students. The shogunate divided the troops and ordered them sharply. After completing the supplementary edition, he represented the governor of Yanzhou, who was in charge of Dongjun County. And then Cao was domineering and domineering, and he acted arrogantly, cut off Yuan Yuan, and killed the good and the good.","For example, moving the capital; murdering officials who disagreed with him; looting the imperial tomb of Prince Xiao, a member of the founding clique of the Zhou dynasty; aiding rebels; and effectively imprisoning the emperor within his own palace by posting his own men around the buildings.","“Now I, Yuan Shao, a man of war, have mustered my armies and displayed my might that I may sweep away and destroy the evil opponents of government. I have already had to deal with Dong Zhuo, the ruffian who invaded the official circle and wrested the government. At that time I grasped my sword and beat the drums to restore order in the east. I assembled warriors, selected the best, and took them into my service. In this matter I came into relations with this Cao Cao and conferred with him to further my scheme. I gave him command of a subordinate force and looked to him to render such petty service as he was equal to. I suffered his stupidities and condoned his shortcomings, his rash attacks and facile retreats, his losses and shameful defeats, his repeated destruction of whole armies. Again and again I sent him more troops and filled the gaps in his depleted ranks. I even addressed a memorial to the Throne for him to be appointed Imperial Protector of Yanzhou. I made him feel as he were a tiger. I added to his honors and increased his authority, hoping that eventually he would justify himself by a victory against Dong Zhuo such as Qin used Meng Ming against Jin. “But Cao Cao availed himself of the opportunity to overstep all bounds, to give free rein to violence and evil. He stripped the common people, outraged the good, and injured the virtuous."
不數日，人報黃巾賊將程遠志統兵五萬來犯涿郡。劉焉令鄒靖引玄德等三人，統兵五百，前去破敵。玄德等欣然領軍前進，直至大興山下，與賊相見。賊衆皆披髮，以黃巾抹額。當下兩軍相對，玄德出馬，左有雲長，右有翼德，揚鞭大罵：“反國逆賊，何不早降！”程遠志大怒，遣副將鄧茂出戰。張飛挺丈八蛇矛直出，手起處，刺中鄧茂心窩，翻身落馬。程遠志見折了鄧茂，拍馬舞刀，直取張飛。雲長舞動大刀，縱馬飛迎。程遠志見了，早吃一驚；措手不及，被雲長刀起處，揮為兩段。後人有詩讚二人曰：,"A few days later, it was reported that Cheng Yuanzhi, the general of the Yellow Turbans, had invaded Zhuo County with 50,000 troops. Liu Yan ordered Zou Jing to lead Xuande and the other three, commanding five hundred troops, to attack the enemy. Xuande and others happily led the army forward until they reached the foot of Daxing Mountain, where they met the bandit. All the thieves wore their hair and wiped their foreheads with yellow scarves. At the moment when the two armies were facing each other, Xuande stepped forward, with Yunchang on the left and Wingde on the right. He raised his whip and cursed: ""An anti-national traitor, why not surrender earlier!"" Cheng Yuanzhi was furious and sent his deputy general Deng Mao to fight. Zhang Fei straightened out the snake spear, stabbed Deng Mao in the heart where his hand started, and turned over and fell from the horse. Cheng Yuanzhi saw that Deng Mao had been smashed, slapped the horse and danced the knife, and took Zhang Fei directly. Yun Chang danced his sword and flew his horse to meet him. Cheng Yuanzhi was taken aback when he saw it; he was caught off guard by Yun Changdao and swung it into two sections. Later generations have a poem to praise the two, saying:","Needless to say, he is delighted, not least when, just a few days later, a Yellow Headband army of around fifty thousand men attacks the Zhuo district. Xuande leads his men forward. Flanked by Guan Yu on his left and Zhang Fei to his right, he challenges the rebels, crying, ‘You traitors, surrender now!’ In the battle that follows, Zhang Fei slays the enemy champion with his giant spear, while Guan Yu slices the champion’s companion in two. The rebels flee; many are taken prisoner. This valiant effort is honoured by a poem:","Before many days it was announced that the rebellion had actually broken out, and a Yellow Scarves chieftain, Cheng Yuanzhi, had invaded the region with a body of fifty thousand rebels. Liu Yan bade Zhou Jing and the three brothers to go out to oppose them with the five hundred troops. Liu Bei joyfully undertook to lead the van and marched to the foot of the Daxing Hills where they saw the rebels. The rebels wore their hair flying about their shoulders, and their foreheads were bound with yellow scarves. When the two armies had been drawn up opposite each other, Liu Bei rode to the front, Guan Yu to his left, Zhang Fei to his right. Flourishing his whip, Liu Bei began to hurl reproaches at the rebels, crying, “O malcontents! Why not dismount and be bound?” Their leader Cheng Yuanzhi, full of rage, sent out one general, Deng Mao, to begin the battle. At once rode forward Zhang Fei, his octane-serpent halberd poised to strike. One thrust and Deng Mao rolled off his horse, pierced through the heart. At this Cheng Yuanzhi himself whipped up his steed and rode forth with sword raised ready to slay Zhang Fei. But Guan Yu swung up his ponderous green-dragon saber and rode at Cheng Yuanzhi. At the sight fear seized upon Cheng Yuanzhi, and before he could defend himself, the great saber fell, cutting him in halves. Two heroes new to war's alarms,"
袁紹移軍逼近官渡下寨。審配曰：“今可撥兵十萬守官渡，就曹操寨前築起土山，令軍人下視寨中放箭。操若棄此而去，吾得此隘口，許昌可破矣。”紹從之，於各寨內選精壯軍人，用鐵鍫土擔，齊來曹操寨邊，壘土成山。曹營內見袁軍堆築土山，欲待出去衝突，被審配弓弩手當住咽喉要路，不能前進。十日之內，築成土山五十餘座，上立高櫓，分撥弓弩手於其上射箭。曹軍大懼，皆頂着遮箭牌守禦。土山上一聲梆子響處，箭下如雨。曹軍皆蒙楯伏地，袁軍吶喊而笑。曹操見軍慌亂，集衆謀士問計。劉曄進曰：“可作發石車以破之。”操令曄進車式，連夜造發石車數百乘，分布營牆內，正對着土山上雲梯。候弓箭手射箭時，營內一齊拽動石車，礮石飛空，往上亂打。人無躲處，弓箭手死者無數。袁軍皆號其車為“霹靂車”。由是袁軍不敢登高射箭。審配又獻一計：令軍人用鐵鍫暗打地道，直透曹營內，號為“掘子軍”。曹兵望見袁軍於山後掘土坑，報知曹操。操又問計於劉曄。曄曰：“此袁軍不能攻明而攻暗，發掘伏道，欲從地下透營而入耳。”操曰：“何以禦之？”曄曰：“可遶營掘長塹，則彼伏道無用也。”操連夜差軍掘塹。袁軍掘伏道到塹邊，果不能入，空費軍力。,"Yuan Shao moved his army and approached Guandu to settle down. Shen Pei said: ""Now we can send 100,000 troops to guard Guandu, build a mountain in front of Cao Cao's fortress, and let the soldiers look down and shoot arrows in the fortress. If Cao abandons this place, I will get this pass, and Xuchang can be broken."" Shao From then on, select the best and strong soldiers from each village, and use the iron scorpion to carry the earth, and they all come to the edge of Cao Cao's village, and build the earth into a mountain. Cao Ying saw that Yuan Jun was building a mountain of earth and wanted to go out for a conflict. He was judged to be a crossbowman who was used as the chokepoint and could not move forward. Within ten days, more than 50 earthen hills were built, high turrets were erected on them, and bowmen were assigned to shoot arrows on them. Cao's army was terrified, and they all stood guard with their shields. At the sound of a clapper on the mountain, the arrows rained like rain. Cao's army all fell to the ground, Yuan army shouted and laughed. Cao Cao saw that the army was in a panic, and gathered all his advisors to ask for a plan. Liu Yejin said, ""It can be used as a chariot to break it."" He ordered Yejin to build hundreds of chariots overnight. They were distributed inside the camp wall, facing the cloud ladder on the Tushan Mountain. When the archers were waiting to shoot the arrows, the battalion pulled the stone carts together, and the rocks flew into the air, hitting them indiscriminately. There was no place to hide, and countless archers died. Yuan Junjie named his car ""Thunderbolt Car"". Because of this, Yuan Jun did not dare to climb high and shoot arrows. Shen Pei offered another plan: order the soldiers to use iron scorpions to secretly hit the tunnel and penetrate directly into Cao's camp, called ""Digzi Army"". Cao's soldiers saw Yuan's army digging a hole in the back of the mountain and reported to Cao Cao. Cao asked Liu Ye again. Ye said: ""The Yuan army cannot attack the light but the dark, and they want to find a way to hide. They want to penetrate the camp from the ground and enter their ears."" It's useless."" Cao sent troops to dig a moat all night. Yuan Jun dug the road to the edge of the cut, but if he couldn't enter, he wasted his air force.","In response, Yuan Shao moves his camp to confront them. Here stalemate ensues, despite all sorts of military tactics such as trying to tunnel under Cao Cao’s camp and blow them up. This is thwarted by Cao Cao’s men digging a deep moat around their camp and thus foiling the enemy plan.","They fled away toward Guandu, and Yuan Shao advanced another stage. He camped near them. Then Shen Pei said, “Now send one hundred thousand soldiers to guard Guandu, and get near Cao Cao's camp; then build up observation mounds to get a clear view of the enemy, and choose vantage points whence to shoot arrows into the midst of their host. If we can force him to evacuate this place, we shall have gained a strategic point whence Capital Xuchang can be attacked.” Yuan Shao adopted this suggestion. From each of the camps, they sought out the strongest veterans who dug with iron spades and carried earth to raise mounds near Cao Cao's camp. Cao Cao's soldiers saw what their enemies were doing and were anxious to make a sortie and drive them off. But the archers and crossbowmen came out commanding the narrow throat through which it was necessary to attack and stayed them. At the end of ten days, they had build up more than half a hundred mounds, and on the summit of each was a lofty tower, whence the archers could command their opponents' camp. Cao Cao's soldiers were greatly frightened and held up their bucklers to keep off the various missiles. From the mounds the arrows flew down like a fierce rain after each roll of drums. The soldiers of Yuan Shao's army laughed and jeered when they saw their enemies crouching under their shields and crawling on the ground to avoid their missiles. Cao Cao saw that his troops were getting out of hand under this attack, so he called a council. Liu Ye spoke up, saying, “Let us make catapults and so destroy them.” Cao Cao at once had models brought and set cunning workers to make these stone-throwing machines. They soon constructed some hundreds and placed them along the walls of the camp inside, just opposite the high ladders on the enemy's mounds. Then Cao Cao's troops watched for Yuan Shao's archers to ascend the towers. As soon as the archers began to shoot, all the catapults began to heave stone balls into the skies and they wrought great havoc. There was no shelter from the falling stones, and enormous numbers of the archers were killed. Yuan Shao's troops called these machines “Rumblers,” and after their appearance the archers dared not ascend the mounds to shoot. Then Shen Pei, the strategist, thought out another plan. He set troops to tunnel under the walls into the midst of Cao Cao's camp and called this corps “The Sappers.” Cao Cao's soldiers saw the enemy digging out pits behind the mounds and told the chief, who at once sought a counter plan from Liu Ye. “As Yuan Shao can no longer attack openly, he is attacking secretly and is tunneling a road under ground into the midst of our camp,” said Liu Ye. “But how to meet it?” “We can surround the camp with a deep moat which renders their tunnel useless.” So a deep moat was dug as quickly as possible, and when the enemy sappers arrived thereat, lo!"

The same thing happens the next day, and again and again until Guan Yu realizes this is part of a strategy to deny him the right to leave.

The first pass is called Dongling Pass. The gatekeeper was surnamed Kong and named Xiu, and he led 500 soldiers to guard the mountain. On that day, Guan Gong escorted the car to the ridge, and the sergeant reported to Kong Xiu, and the show came out of Guan to welcome him. Guan Gong dismounted and bowed to Kong Xiu. Xiu said, ""Where is the general going?"" The public asked, ""Someone has bid farewell to the prime minister and went to Hebei to look for his brother."" Xiu said, ""Yuan Shao, Hebei, is the counterpart of the prime minister. If the general goes here, he must have the diploma of the prime minister."" The public said, """" I was in a hurry because of the travel period, so I didn’t get it.” Xiu said, “I don’t have a diploma, so I can’t let me go until I send someone to report to the prime minister.” Guan Gong said, “When I go to report, I must miss my itinerary.” Xiu said ""I have to be detained by Fadu."" Guan Gong said, ""You won't allow me to pass the gate?"" Xiu said, ""If you want to pass, keep the old and the young as a pledge."" Guan Gong was furious and killed Kong Xiu with his sword. Xiu retreated into the pass, thumped the drums and gathered the army, put on a horse, slaughtered the pass, and shouted, ""Do you dare to pass!"" show. Show a gun to welcome. When the two horses crossed, they only joined together. At the beginning of the steel knife, Kong Xiu's corpse dismounted. The army left. Guan Gong said: ""The sergeant is off. I have no choice but to kill Kong Xiu. I have nothing to do with you. Through the mouths of your army, I spread the word to Prime Minister Cao, saying that Kong Xiu wanted to harm me, so I killed him."" Worship before the horse.","That same morning Guan Yu and the convoy set off for Luoyang. When they reach the borders of Cao Cao’s territory at the Dongling pass, they are stopped. The commander there has five hundred men on guard duty and he wants to know where the party are going. He expresses considerable surprise on hearing that they are heading north over the river. ‘That’s Yuan Shao’s territory. Our enemy,’ says the commander. ‘I assume you have written permission to go there?’ ‘We had to leave at very short notice. There was no time for such formalities,’ replies Guan Yu. ‘Well, I’m sorry,’ says the commander, ‘but you’ll have to wait until written permission has been obtained.’ ‘Such a wait is not possible.’ ‘I have no option,’ says the commander. ‘That is what the army orders command.’ ‘So you’re saying we cannot leave?’ ‘Only if you leave the ladies behind as security.’ ‘I cannot allow such a delay,’ says Guan Yu and he draws his sword. The commander withdraws only to return shortly with his men all armed and ready. ‘ Try and get past me!’ shouts the commander, and Guan Yu charges. With one swift blow he slays the commander. The troops, terrified, bowed down to Guan Yu, who pardons them, and the convoy goes through the pass, heading for Luoyang.","Next day, after an early meal, the ladies got into their carriage, the host handed his letter to Guan Yu, and the little party once more took the road. They went toward Luoyang. Presently they approached a pass known as the Dongling Pass, guarded by Commander Kong Xiu and five hundred soldiers. When the soldiers saw a carriage being pushed toward the pass, they ran to tell their commander, who came out to accost the travelers. Guan Yu dismounted and returned the officer's salute, and Kong Xiu said, “Whither are you going?” “I have left the Prime Minister to go into the North of Yellow River to find my brother.” “But Yuan Shao is my master's rival. You have authority from him to go thither?” “I left hurriedly and could not get it.” “If you have no authority, you must wait while I send to request orders.” “To remain while you send and receive an answer will delay me greatly,” said Guan Yu. “I must stand by my instructions; that is the only thing to do,” said Kong Xiu. “Then you refuse to let me pass?” “If you want to go through, leave the family as a gage.” At this Guan Yu got very angry and made to cut at the commander on the spot, but Kong Xiu withdrew into the gate and beat the drums for an attack. Thereupon the soldiers armed themselves, mounted, and came down to oppose the passage, crying, “Dare you go through, eh?” The carriage was sent off to a safe distance, and then Guan Yu rode at full speed directly at the commander of the guard, who set his spear and came to meet him. The two steeds met and the men engaged, but at the first stroke of the green-dragon saber the commander of the gate fell to the earth dead. His troops fled. “Soldiers, do not flee!” cried Guan Yu. “I killed him because I could do no otherwise. I have nothing against you, but I would ask you to tell the Prime Minister how this thing came to pass, that Kong Xiu wished to kill me, and so I slew him in self defense.” The soldiers bowed before him, and Guan Yu, with the carriage, passed through the gates and continued their way to Luoyang."

The table asked all the advisors: ""Yuan Benchu sent envoys here again, and Cao Mengde sent Mi Heng here again, what should I do?"" Also. If it is not the case, I will choose the good ones to follow. Now that Cao Cao is good at using troops, and there are many wise men, he will definitely take Yuan Shao first, and then move his troops to Jiangdong, fearing that the general will not be able to defend; Treat the general very seriously.” Biao said: “You will go to Xudu, observe its movements, and then have a discussion.” Song said: “The ruler and the minister each have their own set points. Song is a general today, although he is going through fire and water, he is only ordered. If the general is If you can go up to the Son of Heaven and go down to Duke Cao, make Song Ke; if you are in doubt and undecided, Song goes to the capital, and the Son of Heaven bestows Song an official, then Song will be a minister of the Son of Heaven, and will no longer be a general.” The table said, “You Let's go and watch it first. I have no idea."" Song said, and went to Xudu to see the drill. Cao then worshipped Song as his attendant and led Lingling Prefect. Xun Yu said: ""Han Song came to observe the movement and still, but he did not perform any small work, so he added this position again. Mi Heng has no sound, and the prime minister sent him without asking. Why?"" Ask again?"" He then sent Han Song back to Jingzhou to speak to Liu Biao. Song returned to see Biao, praised the court's virtue, and persuaded Biao to invite his son to serve. Biao was furious and said, ""You have two hearts!"" He wanted to kill him. Song shouted, ""The general has lost Song, and Song has not lost the general!"" Kuailiang said, ""Before Song left, I said this first."" Liu Biao then pardoned him.","At last, and against his will, Mi Heng is despatched to Jingzhou to see Liu Biao. Here his behaviour is no better! In praising Liu Biao, he actually manages to insult and humiliate him. One of Liu Biao’s advisers says, ‘Kill him! He has insulted you.’ Liu Biao is no fool. ‘ Cao Cao was also insulted but didn’t kill him. He knows how bad this’ll look – to kill a famous scholar. That’s why he sent him here – for me to do his dirty work for him. However, I’m going to send him to Huang Zu. That’ll show Cao Cao that I too can play this game!’ And so Mi Heng is despatched to Huang Zu. While this is going on, Yuan Shao’s envoy turns up, also proposing an alliance. Uncertain what to do, Liu Biao equivocates, first going one way then another.","At that time a messenger from Yuan Shao was also there with certain proposals for an alliance, and it was necessary to decide which aide to espouse. All the advisers came together to consider the question. Then Commander Han Song said, “As you have now two offers, you can please yourself and choose your own way to destroy your enemies; for if one refuses, you can follow the other. Now Cao Cao is an able general and has many capable officers in his train. It looks as though he may destroy Yuan Shao and then move his armies across the river. I fear, my lord, you would be unable then to withstand him. That being so it would be wise to support Cao Cao, who will treat you with respect.” Liu Biao replied, “You go to the capital and see how things tend. That will help me to decide.” Han Song said, “The positions of master and servant are clearly defined. Now I am your man prepared to go all lengths for you and obey you to the last, whether in serving the Emperor or in following Cao Cao. But lest there should be any doubt you must remember that if the Emperor gives me any office, then I shall become his servant and shall not be ready to face death for you.” “You go and find out what you can. I have ideas in my mind.” So Han Song took his leave and went to the capital, where he saw Cao Cao. Cao Cao gave him rank and made him Governor of Lingling. Adviser Xun Yu remonstrated, saying, “This man came to spy out how things were moving. He has done nothing to deserve reward, and yet you give him an office like this. There were no such suspicious rumors connected with poor Mi Heng, and yet you sent him off and would never test his power.” “Mi Heng shamed me too deeply before all the world. I am going to borrow Liu Biao's hand to remove him. And you need say no more,” said Cao Cao. Then Cao Cao sent Han Song back to his former master to tell him what had happened. Han Song came and was full of praise for the virtues of the court and was keen on persuading Liu Biao to espouse that side. Then Liu Biao suddenly turned angry, charged him with treachery, put him in prison, and threatened him with death. “You turn your back on me,” cried Han Song. “I did not betray you.” Kuai Liang remarked, “Han Song had foretold this possibility before he left; it is only what he expected.” Liu Biao, who was just and reasonable, went no further."

於是揀選良馬、名鷹、俊犬，弓矢俱備，先聚兵城外，操入請天子田獵。帝曰：“田獵恐非正道。”操曰：“古之帝王，春蒐夏苗，秋獮冬狩，四時出郊，以示武於天下。今四海擾攘之時，正當借田獵以講武。”帝不敢不從，隨卽上逍遙馬，帶寶雕弓、金鈚箭，排鑾駕出城。玄德與關、張各彎弓插箭，內穿掩心甲，手持兵器，引數十騎隨駕出許昌。曹操騎爪黃飛電馬，引十萬之衆，與天子獵於許田。軍士排開圍場，週廣二百餘里。操與天子並馬而行，只爭一馬頭。背後都是操之心腹將校。文武百官，遠遠侍從，誰敢近前。當日獻帝馳馬到許田，劉玄德起居道傍。帝曰：“朕今欲看皇叔射獵。”玄德領命上馬，忽草中趕起一兔。玄德射之，一箭正中那兔。帝喝采。轉過土坡，忽見荊棘中趕出一隻大鹿。帝連射三箭不中，顧謂操曰：“卿射之。”操就討天子寶雕弓、金鈚箭，扣滿一射，正中鹿背，倒於草中。羣臣將校，見了金鈚箭，只道天子射中，都踴躍向帝呼萬歲。曹操縱馬直出，遮於天子之前以迎受之。羣皆生色。玄德背後雲長大怒，剔起臥蠶眉，睜開丹鳳眼，提刀拍馬便出，要斬曹操。玄德見了，慌忙搖手送目。關公見兄如此，便不敢動。玄德欠身向操稱賀曰：“丞相神射，世所罕及！”操笑曰：“此天子洪福耳。”乃回馬向天子稱賀，竟不獻還寶雕弓，親自懸帶。圍場已罷，宴於許田。宴畢，駕回許都。衆人各自歸歇。雲長問玄德曰：“操賊欺君罔上，我欲殺之，為國除害，兄何止我？”玄德曰：“‘投鼠忌器’。操與帝相離只一馬頭，其心腹之人，週迴擁侍；吾弟若逞一時之怒，輕有舉動，倘事不成，有傷天子，罪反坐我等矣。”雲長曰：“今日不殺此賊，後必為禍。”玄德曰：“且宜秘之，不可輕言。”,"So he chose good horses, famous eagles, handsome dogs, and prepared bows and arrows. First, he gathered his troops outside the city and brought them in to invite the emperor to hunt in the fields. The emperor said: ""The field hunting is probably not the right way."" Cao said: ""The ancient emperors searched for summer seedlings in spring, autumn and winter hunting, and went out to the suburbs at four o'clock to show their martial arts in the world. Today, when the four seas are turbulent, it is time to use the field to hunt to teach. Martial arts."" The emperor did not dare to disobey, so he followed the swastika on the free-spirited horse, brought a precious carved bow and golden arrows, and drove out of the city with a platoon of horses. Xuande and Guan and Zhang each bent their bows and inserted arrows, pierced the heart armor, held weapons, and led dozens of cavalry out of Xuchang. Cao Cao rode on a horse with yellow claws, and led a hundred thousand people to hunt with the emperor in Xutian. The sergeants lined the paddock, more than 200 li around. Cao walks side by side with the Son of Heaven, and only fights for a horse's head. Behind them are the confidants of the school. Civil and military officials, servants from afar, who dares to approach. On the same day, the emperor galloped to Xutian, and Liu Xuande lived beside the road. The emperor said, ""I want to watch Uncle Huang shoot and hunt."" Xuande led the order to mount a horse, and suddenly a rabbit was caught in the grass. Xuande shot it, and the arrow hit the rabbit. God applauds. Turning around the slope, I suddenly saw a big deer driven out from among the thorns. The emperor failed to shoot three arrows in a row, and Gu said Cao, ""Sir, shoot it."" Cao asked for the emperor's treasured carved bow and golden arrows, buckled for one shot, hit the back of the deer, and fell into the grass. All the ministers and generals, seeing the golden arrow, only the emperor shot him, all eagerly shouted long live to the emperor. Cao steered his horse to go straight out, covering him in front of the emperor to receive him. The crowd is colorful. Behind Xuande, Yunchang was angry, tickled the eyebrows of the lying silkworm, opened the eyes of the phoenix, and went out with a knife and slapped his horse, wanting to behead Cao Cao. When Xuande saw it, he hurriedly waved his hand to look away. Guan Gong did not dare to move when he saw his brother like this. Xuande bowed his body and greeted Cao, saying, ""The prime minister's divine shot is rare in the world!"" Cao laughed and said, ""This emperor is Hong Fu'er."" He went back to his horse to congratulate the emperor, but instead of returning the treasured carved bow, he slung the belt himself. The paddock is over, and the banquet is held in Xu Tian. After the banquet, drive back to Xudu. Everyone went to rest. Yunchang asked Xuande, ""It's useless to bully the emperor. I want to kill him and destroy the country. What's more than me?"" Xuande said, ""'Take a rat to avoid weapons'. Cao is only one horse away from the emperor. If my brother shows his anger for a while, he will act lightly, and if things don’t work, he will hurt the emperor, and the crime will sit with me.” Yun Chang said, “If I don’t kill this thief today, I will do it later. Disaster."" Xuande said, ""It should be kept secret, not lightly spoken.""","His first step is to propose an imperial hunt – and then to subvert it. Going on a hunt is not something the emperor wants to do. But he has found it increasingly difficult to say no to Cao Cao. So, against his better judgement, the emperor agrees, and the date is set. The whole event is planned by Cao Cao, so although the court officials accompany the emperor, it is Cao’s men who staff the hunt. The emperor is escorted to the hunt by Cao Cao. The emperor carries the imperial jewelled bow and the imperial gold-tipped arrows. The three brothers-in-arms accompany the emperor as bodyguards. However, with Cao Cao riding beside the emperor and Cao Cao’s men massed behind, the courtiers and ministers are forced to the rear. This is completely contrary to traditional protocol. Suddenly a stag is disturbed and breaks cover. The emperor fires three times with his bow but misses each time. ‘Now you try!’ cries the emperor to Cao Cao, who takes hold of the imperial bow and arrows and with one shot brings the stag down. Seeing the imperial arrow strike the stag, all the courtiers and ministers assume the emperor fired it himself. They break into sycophantic applause, pressing forward to congratulate the emperor, crying, ‘May the emperor live for ten thousand years!’ But it is Cao Cao, not the emperor, who acknowledges the praise. Praise reserved for an emperor! Shocked, the courtiers and ministers visibly pale, wondering what this could mean for the future. Guan Yu is so furious that his great eyebrows rise in anger, and his piercing eyes glare. Urging on his horse, he charges forward, his great sword drawn, determined to slay the upstart Cao Cao. Just in time, Xuande catches his eye and hastily signals that he must not attack. Furious, but obedient to his elder brother, Guan Yu reins in and sullenly puts his sword back in its sheath. Xuande faces Cao Cao and congratulates him on such a great shot. But Cao Cao, laughing, says, ‘It is only possible because of the blessing of the emperor’, and so saying he rides over to the emperor to express his congratulations. But he does not return the imperial bow. Instead, he hangs it over his own shoulder. After they have all returned to the court, Guan Yu demands an answer from Xuande. ‘Why? Why did you stop me? That man is a traitor, and I could’ve saved the emperor from him.’ Xuande says, ‘I did it to protect both the emperor and you from the violence that Cao Cao’s followers would have unleashed.’ ‘If we don’t deal with him now, then he’ll be a plague by tomorrow,’ retorts Guan Yu. ‘Discretion now, my friend,’ says Xuande.","This expedition being decided upon they got together fleet horses, famous falcons, and pedigree hounds, and prepared bows and arrows in readiness. They mustered a strong force of guards outside the city. When the Prime Minister proposed the hunting expedition, the Emperor said he feared it was an improper thing to do. Cao Cao replied, “In ancient times rulers made four expeditions yearly at each of the four seasons in order to show their strength. They were called Sou, Miao, Xien, and Shou, in the order of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Now that the whole country is in confusion, it would be wise to inaugurate a hunt in order to train the army. I am sure Your Majesty will approve.” So the Emperor with the full paraphernalia for an imperial hunt joined the expedition. He rode a saddled horse, carried an inlaid bow, and his quiver was filled with gold-tipped arrows. His chariot followed behind. Liu Bei and his brothers were in the imperial train, each with his bow and quiver. Each party member wore a breastplate under the outer robe and held his especial weapon, while their escort followed them. Cao Cao rode a dun horse called “Flying-Lightning,” and the army was one hundred thousand strong. The hunt took place in Xutian, and the legions spread out as guards round the hunting arena which extended over some one hundred square miles. Cao Cao rode even with the Emperor, the horses' heads alternating in the lead. The imperial attendants immediately following were all in Cao Cao's confidence. The other officers, civil and military, lagged behind, for they dared not press forward into the midst of Cao Cao's partisans. One day the Emperor was riding toward the hunting grounds and noticed his newly found uncle respectfully standing by the roadside. “I should like to see my uncle display his hunting skill,” said the Emperor. Liu Bei mounted his steed at once. Just then a hare started from its form; Liu Bei shot and hit it with the first arrow. The Emperor, much struck by this display, rode away over a slope. Suddenly a deer broke out of the thicket. He shot three arrows at it but all missed. “You try,” said the Emperor turning to Cao Cao. “Lend me Your Majesty's bow,” Cao Cao replied; and taking the inlaid bow and the golden-tipped arrows, he pulled the bow and hit the deer in the shoulder at the first shot. It fell in the grass and could not run. Now the crowd of officers seeing the golden-barbed arrow sticking in the wound concluded at once that the shot was the Emperor's, so they rushed up and shouted “O King, live forever!” Cao Cao rode out pushing past the Emperor and acknowledged the congratulations. They all turned pale. Guan Yu, who was behind Liu Bei, was especially angry. The silkworm eyebrows stood up fiercely, and the red phoenix eyes glared as, sword in hand, he rode hastily forth to cut down the audacious Prime Minister for his impertinence. However, Liu Bei hastily waved him back and shot at him a meaning glance so that Guan Yu stopped and made no further move. Liu Bei bowing toward Cao Cao said, “Most sincere felicitations! A truly supernatural shot, such as few have achieved!” “It is only the enormous good fortune of the Son of Heaven!” said Cao Cao with a smile. Then he turned his steed and felicitated the Emperor. But he did not return the bow; he hung it over his own shoulder instead. The hunt finished with banqueting; and when the entertainments were over, they returned to the capital, all glad of some repose after the expedition. Guan Yu was still angry of the Prime Minister's breach of decorum. One day Guan Yu said to Liu Bei, “Brother, why did you prevent me from killing that rebel and so ridding the world of a scoundrel? He insults the Emperor and ignores everybody else.” “When you throw stones at a rat, beware of the vase,” quoted Liu Bei. “Cao Cao was only a horse's head away from Our Lord, and in the midst of a crowd of his partisans. In that momentary burst of anger, if you had struck and failed, and harm had come to the Emperor, what an awful crime would have been laid to us!” “If we do not rid the world of him today, a worse evil will come of it,” said Guan Yu. “But be discreet, my brother. Such matters cannot be lightly discussed.”"

In the midst of hatred, people reported that Wu Hou sent his younger brother Sun Yu to arrive. Zhou Yu came in and spoke clearly. Sun Yu said, ""I'm here to help the governor on my brother's order."" Then he ordered the army to move forward. On the way to Baqiu, Liu Feng and Guan Ping, who were the upper class of the people, led the army to intercept the waterway.

Despite a last-minute attempt by Sun Quan’s brother Sun Yu to continue the expedition, it comes to nothing, blocked as they are by Xuande’s troops. Not long after, Zhou Yu receives a letter from Kong Ming. In it he sternly reprimands Zhou Yu for his foolish plans.","Then he was carried to his boat. It only added to his rage and mortification to be told that Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang could be seen on the top of one of the hills apparently feasting and enjoying some music. He lay grinding his teeth with vexation. “They say I shall never be able to get Yiazhou! But I will; I swear I will.” Soon after Sun Quan's brother Sun Shao arrived, and Zhou Yu told him his vexations. “My brother sent me to assist you,” said Sun Shao. Zhou Yu ordered Sun Shao to press the army forward for Yiazhou, and they got to Baqiu. There they stopped, for the scouts reported large forces under Liu Bei's generals—Liu Feng and Guan Ping—barring the water route in the Great River. This failure did not make the Commander-in-Chief any calmer. About this time a letter from Zhuge Liang arrived, which ran like this:"
天地反覆兮，火欲殂；,"Heaven and earth are going up and down, and the fire wants to die;",Heaven and Earth are upside down – oh my god! The heat has gone out of the fire. A great house is shaken … heavens!,"“The universe is rived, O!"
肅見孔明禮畢，問曰：“向慕先生才德，未得拜晤；今幸相遇，願聞目今安危之事。”孔明曰：“曹操奸計，亮已盡知；但恨力未及，故且避之。”肅曰：“皇叔今將止於此乎？”孔明曰：“使君與蒼梧太守吳臣有舊，將往投之。”肅曰：“吳臣糧少兵微，自不能保，焉能容人？”孔明曰：“吳臣處雖不足久居，今且暫依之，別有良圖。”肅曰：“孫將軍虎踞六郡，兵精糧足，又極敬賢禮士，江表英雄，多歸附之；今為君計，莫若遣心腹往結東吳，以共圖大事。”孔明曰：“劉使君與孫將軍自來無舊，恐虛費詞說——且別無心腹之人可使。”肅曰：“先生之兄，現為江東參謀，日望與先生相見。肅不才，願與公同見孫將軍，共議大事。”玄德曰：“孔明是吾之師，頃刻不可相離，安可去也？”肅堅請孔明同去。玄德佯不許。孔明曰：“事急矣，請奉命一行。”玄德方纔許諾。魯肅遂別了玄德、劉琦，與孔明登舟，望柴桑郡來。正是：,"After seeing Kong Ming's ceremony, he asked, ""Mr. Xiang Mu is so virtuous and virtuous that I have not been able to meet him; I am fortunate to meet him today, and I would like to hear about the safety and security of the moment."" Kong Ming said, ""Cao Cao's tricks are well known to Liang; It’s too late, so let’s avoid it.” Su said, “Is Uncle Huang going to stop here now?” Kong Ming said, “Your Majesty has an old relationship with Cangwu’s prefect, Wu Chen, and will go to him.” Su said, “Wu Chen has little food. The soldiers are weak, and they can’t protect themselves, so how can they tolerate people?” Kong Ming said: “Although Wu Chen’s place is not enough to live for a long time, let’s rely on it for the time being, and don’t have a good plan.” Su said, “General Sun’s tigers are in the six counties, and the soldiers are fine food. You are also very respectful to virtuous and ceremonial scholars, and Jiang is a hero, and many are attached to them; now, for the monarch’s plan, don’t send his confidants to join Eastern Wu, so as to plan great things together.” Kong Ming said: “Liu Shijun and General Sun have never been old. , I'm afraid to waste words and say - and there is no one who can be trusted."" Su said: ""Master's brother, now a staff officer in Jiangdong, Riwang will meet with Master. Su is not talented, and I would like to meet General Sun with the public. Let’s discuss important matters together.” Xuande said, “Kong Ming is my teacher, and we cannot be separated for a while, so is it safe to go?” Su Jian asked Kong Ming to go with him. Xuande pretended not to. Kong Ming said: ""The matter is urgent, please follow your orders."" Xuande just promised. Lu Su then bid farewell to Xuande and Liu Qi, boarded a boat with Kong Ming, and looked forward to Chaisang County. Exactly:","In response they are very likely to turn to Xuande for assistance. This way, as Kong Ming points out, ‘If the south wins, then that is the end of Cao Cao. If the north wins, we are there and can take over much of Wu.’ Kong Ming is therefore delighted when Lu Su arrives offering precisely such a partnership. However, Kong Ming advises Xuande to be deliberately vague about not only how strong Cao Cao is but also about whether such an alliance is really in his best interests. In the end, this strategy results in Lu Su inviting Kong Ming to come to see his brother, who is an adviser to Sun Quan, and to discuss a possible alliance.","When the ceremonies were over, Lu Su said, “I have long admired your genius but have never been fortunate enough to meet you. Now that I have met you, I hope I may speak of present politics.” Replied Zhuge Liang, “I know all Cao Cao's infamies and wickednesses, but to my regret we were not strong enough to withstand him. That is why we avoided him.” “Is the Imperial Uncle going to stay here?” “The Princely One is an old friend of Wu Ju, Governor of Changwu, and intends to go to him.” “Wu Ju has few troops and insufficient supplies; he cannot ensure safety for himself. How can he receive the Uncle?” said Lu Su. “Changwu is not one to remain in long, but it is good enough for the present. We can make other plans for the future.” Lu Su said, “Sun Quan is strongly posted in the six southern territories and is exceedingly well supplied. He treats able people and scholars with the greatest courtesy and so they gather round him. Now if you are seeking a plan for your Prince, you cannot do better than send some friend to confer with him.” “There have never been any relations between my master and yours,” said Zhuge Liang. “I fear there would be nothing but a waste of words. Besides, we have no one to send.” “Your elder brother Zhuge Jin is there as adviser and is longing to see you. I am but a simple wight, but I should be pleased to discuss affairs with my master and you.” “But Zhuge Liang is my Directing Instructor,” said Liu Bei, “and I cannot do without him. He cannot go.” Lu Su pressed him. Liu Bei pretended to refuse permission. “It is important; I pray you give me leave to go,” said Zhuge Liang. Then Liu Bei consented. And they soon took leave and the two set out by boat for Sun Quan's headquarters. A little boat sailed down the stream"

却說獻帝回宮，泣謂伏皇后曰：“朕自卽位以來，奸雄並起：先受董卓之殃，後遭傕、汜之亂。常人未受之苦，吾與汝當之。後得曹操，以為社稷之臣；不意專國弄權，擅作威福。朕每見之，背若芒刺。今日在圍場上，身迎呼賀，無禮已極！早晚必有異謀，吾夫婦不知死所也！”伏皇后曰：“滿朝公卿，俱食漢祿，竟無一人能救國難乎？”言未畢，忽一人自外而入曰：“帝、后休憂：吾舉一人，可除國害。”帝視之，乃伏皇后之父伏完也。帝掩淚問曰：“皇丈亦知操賊之專橫乎？”完曰：“許田射鹿之事，誰不見之？但滿朝之中，非操宗族，則其門下。若非國戚，誰肯盡忠討賊？老臣無權，難行此事。車騎將軍國舅董承可託也。”帝曰：“董國舅多赴國難，朕躬素知；可宣入內，共議大事。”完曰：“陛下左右皆操賊心腹，倘事泄，為禍不淺。”帝曰：“然則奈何？”完曰：“臣有一計：陛下可製衣一領，取玉帶一條，密賜董承；却於帶襯內縫一密詔以賜之，令到家見詔，可以晝夜畫策；神鬼不覺矣。”帝然之，伏完辭出。,"But he said that Emperor Xian returned to the palace and cried to Empress Fu, saying: ""Since I took the throne, I have been a traitor and a hero. First I suffered from Dong Zhuo's disaster, and then I suffered from the chaos of Jui and Si. Ordinary people did not suffer from it. After I got Cao Cao, I thought it was a minister of the Sheji; I didn't want to dominate the country and gain power, and I was presumptive to be a blessing. Every time I saw him, my back was like a thorn. Today in the paddock, I greeted him with congratulations, and it was extremely rude! My wife and I don’t know where they died!” Empress Fu said, “The ministers of the Manchu Dynasty all eat Han Lu, but none of them can save the country?” Before the words were finished, suddenly one person entered from outside and said, “Emperor, you are worried: If I raise one person, I can eliminate the country's harm."" The emperor regarded it as Fu Wan, the father of Empress Fu. The emperor covered his tears and asked, ""Does the emperor also know the tyranny of Cao thieves?"" Wan said, ""Who didn't see Xu Tian shooting a deer? But in the Manchu dynasty, if it wasn't the Cao clan, it would be under his sect. Willing to be loyal to the thief? The old minister has no power, so it is difficult to do this. The general of the chariot and cavalry, the uncle Dong Cheng, can be trusted."" The emperor said: ""Uncle Dong has gone to many national disasters. ""Wan said: ""Your Majesty is all about thieves' confidants. If something is leaked, it will not be easy."" The emperor said: ""But what can I do?"" Wan said: ""I have a plan: Your Majesty can make a collar of clothes, take a jade belt, and keep it secret. I gave Dong Cheng; but I sewed a secret edict on the inside of the lining to give him, so that when I see the edict at home, I can draw a plan day and night;","On his return to the empress, the emperor breaks down and tells her of his fears. ‘Ever since I ascended the throne, I’ve been surrounded by vicious ministers. First it was the awful Dong Zhuo; then the rebellion of Li Jue and Guo Si. You and I’ve had to suffer such sorrows, more than anyone could imagine. And now we have Cao Cao pretending to defend our honour but actually usurping it. Today, in the hunt he tricked my ministers and officials into giving him praise – which was really meant for me! I fear that he is planning to lead a rebellion. I don’t think we are fated to die natural deaths!’ At this point they are joined by her father, Fu Wan. ‘I know how to get rid of this man,’ he says. ‘So you saw what he did?’ replies the emperor. ‘Impossible to miss. But we have to be careful. The court is full of his cronies,’ says Fu Wan. ‘But I believe I’ve a solution. Let’s ask Dong Cheng, the brother of the imperial concubine, to assist us. But beware! All your staff are in the pay of Cao Cao, so we must do this in great secrecy. This is why I’ve a plan. Have a special robe and jade belt made for Dong Cheng and present it to him formally. But, within the jade belt, create a hidden pouch, and there hide a secret formal imperial decree. This he will discover when he gets home and examines the gift. The decree will give him authority to take whatever actions he deems necessary. Then he can act, and not even the deities above or the ghosts below will know anything about this.’ So the emperor writes the secret decree. Biting the tip of his finger, he writes it with his own blood. No more powerful sign of his serious intent can be imagined.","With tears in his eyes, he related what had occurred in the hunt to his consort, Empress Fu. “Alas for me!” said he. “From the first days of my accession, one vicious minister has succeeded another. I was the victim of Dong Zhuo's evil machinations; then followed the rebellion of Li Jue and Guo Si. You and I had to bear sorrows such as no others have borne. Then came this Cao Cao as one who would maintain the imperial dignity, but he has seized upon all real authority and does as he wishes. He works continually for his own glorification, and I never see him but my back pricks. These last few days in the hunting field, he went in front of me and acknowledged the cheers of the crowd. He is so extremely rude that I feel sure he has sinister designs against me. Alas, my wife, we know not when our end may come!” “In a whole court full of nobles, who have eaten the bread of Han, is there not one who will save his country?” said she. Thus spoke the Empress, and at the same moment there stepped in a man who said, “Grieve not, O Imperial Pair! I can find a savior for the country.” It was none other than the father of the Empress, Fu Wan. “Have you heard of Cao Cao's wanton and perverse behavior?” said the Emperor, drying his eyes. “You mean the deer shooting? Who did not see that, indeed? But the whole court is full of his clan or his creatures. With the exception of the relatives of your Consort, there is not one loyal enough to deal with a rebel. I have no authority and can do nothing, but there is General Dong Cheng, the State Uncle, who could do it.” “Could Uncle Dong Cheng come in to consult about this? I know he has had much experience of state troubles.” Fu Wan replied, “Every one of your attendants is a partisan of Cao Cao, and this sort of thing must be kept most profoundly secret or the consequence will be most serious.” “Then what can be done?” said the Emperor. “The only plan I can think of is to send gifts of a robe and a jade girdle to Dong Cheng, and in the lining of the girdle hide a secret edict authorizing him to take certain steps. When he gets home and has read the edict, he can elaborate plans as quickly as possible, and neither the spirits above nor the demons below will know anything about them.”"
却說袁紹欲斬玄德。玄德從容進曰：“明公只聽一面之詞，而絕向日之情耶？備自徐州失散，二弟雲長未知存否；天下同貌者不少，豈赤面長鬚之人，卽為關某也？明公何不察之？”袁紹是個沒主張的人，聞玄德之言，責沮授曰：“誤聽汝言，險殺好人。”遂仍請玄德上帳坐，議報顏良之讎。帳下一人應聲而進曰：“顏良與我如兄弟，今被曹賊所殺，我安得不雪其恨？”玄德視其人：身長八尺，面如獬豸，乃河北名將文醜也。袁紹大喜曰：“非汝不能報顏良之讎。吾與十萬軍兵，便渡黃河，追殺曹賊！”沮授曰：“不可：今宜留屯延津，分兵官渡，乃為上策。若輕舉渡河，設或有變，衆皆不能還矣。”紹怒曰：“皆是汝等遲緩軍心，遷延日月，有妨大事！豈不聞‘兵貴神速’乎？”沮授出，歎曰：“上盈其志，下務其功；悠悠黃河，吾其濟乎！”遂託疾不出議事。玄德曰：“備蒙大恩，無可報効，意欲與文將軍同行：一者報明公之德，二者就探雲長的實信。”紹喜，喚文醜與玄德同領前部。文醜曰：“劉玄德屢敗之將，於軍不利。旣主公要他去時，某分三萬軍，敎他為後部。”於是文醜自領七萬軍先行，令玄德引三萬軍隨後。,"But Yuan Shao wanted to kill Xuande. Xuande entered calmly and said: ""Ming Gong only listens to one side of the words, but never has a love for the sun? Bei has been separated from Xuzhou, and the second brother Yun Chang is unknown. A certain person? Why didn’t Duke Ming look into it?” Yuan Shao, a person who had no opinion, heard Xuande’s words and blamed Jushu: “I misunderstood what you said, and risked killing a good person.” He then invited Xuande to sit in the tent and reported to Yan Liang. of 雠. A person under the tent responded and said, ""Yan Liang and I are like brothers, but now they were killed by Cao bandits, so I can't feel any resentment?"" and also. Yuan Shao was overjoyed and said, ""It's not because you can't report Yan Liang's guilt. I and a hundred thousand soldiers will cross the Yellow River and hunt down Cao's thieves!"" Ju Shu said: ""No: now it is advisable to stay in Yanjin, and divide troops into officers to cross, which is the best policy. If you cross the river lightly, there may be changes, and everyone will not be able to return."" Shao said angrily, ""It's all because you are slow in the army, delaying the sun and the moon, and it's a big deal! Haven't you heard that the soldiers are very fast?"" Ju sent out, He sighed and said, ""The top is profitable, and the bottom is responsible for its merits; the Yellow River is long, and I am good enough!"" Xuande said: ""Be prepared to receive great favors, but there is no retribution, and I want to go with General Wen: one is to repay Duke Ming's virtue, and the other is to explore the truth of Yunchang."" Shaoxi, called Wen Chou and Xuande to lead the same department. Wen Chou said: ""Liu Xuande's repeated defeats are not good for the army. When the lord wants him to go, he will be divided into 30,000 troops, and he will be sent to the rear."" So Wen Chou led the 70,000 troops first, and ordered Xuande to lead the 30,000 troops to follow. .","Xuande remains calm and says to Yuan Shao, ‘This claim that I plotted this and Guan Yu executed it is just a rumour. Many people look like Guan Yu, so why assume it was him? Let’s see if it is true first.’ Yuan Shao, who is always easily swayed, agrees, reprimanding the official who had told him it was Guan Yu. All are agreed that the death of Yan Liang has to be avenged. This unites everyone in the desire to attack Cao Cao as soon as possible. Yan Liang’s friend Wen Chou steps forward, eager to lead the attack. When Xuande asks to join the expedition in order to find out what has happened to Guan Yu, Wen Chou is far from happy. ‘Xuande has lost battle after battle,’ he says, ‘and will therefore bring bad luck.’ But Yuan Shao insists, so Wen Chou puts Xuande at the rear with thirty thousand men while he leads the main force of seventy thousand.","As the last chapter closed, Liu Bei had been condemned to die. Liu Bei spoke up, however, and said, “Pray hear one word, Illustrious Sir, before you decide. I have lost sight of my brother since my misfortune at Xuzhou and know not whether Guan Yu be dead or alive. There are many men in the world who resemble him. Is every red-faced man with a beard named Guan Yu? Should you not rather seek some evidence?” Now Yuan Shao was impulsive and facile by nature, and when Liu Bei spoke thus, he suddenly turned upon Ju Shou, saying, “By wrongly regarding what you said, I nearly killed an innocent person.” Then Yuan Shao requested Liu Bei once more to resume his seat in the tent and give advice on how to avenge Yan Liang. Soon from the lower end a voice was heard, saying, “Yan Liang and I were as brothers, and can I allow any other to avenge his death?” The speaker was a man of middle height with a face like a linlion, a famous leader from the North of Yellow River, named Wen Chou. Yuan Shao was pleased and said, “You are the only man who can do it. I will give you one hundred thousand troops, and you can cross the Yellow River, and quickly smite that rebel Cao Cao. “You cannot do it; he will fail,” said Ju Shou. “The proper course is to hold Yenjin and detach a force to Guandu. If you rashly cross the river and anything goes wrong, not a soul will return.” Yuan Shao said, “That is always the way with you fellows, always delaying and taking the dash out of the army. You put off today and postpone tomorrow till success has become impossible. Do you forget that promptitude is what each soldier honors?” The adviser withdrew sadly, saying. “Superiors do not curb their ambitions; inferiors crave for achievements; things are undone. Eternal is the course of Yellow River, shall I change it?” Thereafter Ju Shou feigned illness and went no more to the council. Liu Bei said, “I have received much kindness at your hands and have been unable to show my gratitude. I would accompany General Wen Chou that I may repay your bounty and also that I may hear news of my brother.” Yuan Shao gladly consented and ordered Wen Chou to share his command with Liu Bei. But the former objected, saying, “Liu Bei has been so often defeated that it will augur ill for success this time. Since you wish, I will give Liu Bei command of the rear guard of thirty thousand soldiers.” And this being approved, three legions were told off under Liu Bei's special command to follow the main body."

太史慈得脫，星夜投平原來見劉玄德。施禮罷，具言孔北海被圍求救之事，呈上書札。玄德看畢，問慈曰：“足下何人？”慈曰：“某太史慈，東海之鄙人也。與孔融親非骨肉，比非鄕黨，特以氣誼相投，有分憂共患之意。今管亥暴亂，北海被圍，孤窮無告，危在旦夕。聞君仁義素著，能救人危急，故特令某冒鋒突圍，前來求救。”玄德斂容答曰：“孔北海知世間有劉備耶？”乃同雲長、翼德點精兵三千，往北海郡進發。管亥望見救軍來到，親自引兵迎敵；因見玄德兵少，不以為意。玄德與關、張、太史慈立馬陣前，管亥忿怒直出。太史慈却待向前，雲長早出，直取管亥。兩馬相交，衆軍大喊；量管亥怎敵得雲長，數十合之間，靑龍刀起，劈管亥於馬下。太史慈、張飛兩騎齊出，雙鎗並舉，殺入賊陣。玄德驅兵掩殺。城上孔融望見太史慈與關、張趕殺賊衆，如虎入羊羣，縱橫莫當，便驅兵出城。兩下夾攻，大敗羣賊，降者無數，餘黨潰散。,"Taishi Ci was freed, and Xingye threw himself into the plain to see Liu Xuande. After giving the salute, he stated that Kong Beihai was besieged and asked for help, and submitted a letter. After Xuande finished reading, he asked Ci, ""Who are you under your feet?"" Ci said, ""A certain Taishi Ci, the servant of the East China Sea. He and Kong Rong are not close relatives, but they are not partisans. I mean. Now Guanhai is in turmoil, Beihai is besieged, and there is no one to report, and the danger is at the end of the day. Wen Jun is benevolent and righteous, and can save people in danger, so I specially ordered someone to break through the siege and come to ask for help."" Xuande replied, ""Confucius said. Does Beihai know that there is Liu Bei in the world?"" He then went to Beihai County with Yunchang and Yide to point out 3,000 elite soldiers. Guan Hai saw the rescue army coming, and personally led the troops to meet the enemy; seeing that Xuande had few troops, he didn't care. Xuande joined Guan, Zhang, and Taishi Ci in front of the battle, and Guan Hai was angry. Taishi Ci stayed forward, but Yun Chang left early and took Guan Hai directly. When the two horses crossed, all the troops shouted; measuring how Guanhai was the enemy of Yunchang, and within a few dozen times, the dragon sword rose and split Guanhai under the horse. Taishi Ci and Zhang Fei cavalry together, armed with both spears, rushed into the thieves' formation. Xuande drove his troops to cover up. Kong Rong on the city saw Taishi Ci and Guan and Zhang chasing and killing the bandits, like tigers swarming into sheep, and he drove his troops out of the city. With two attacks, the group of thieves was defeated, and countless surrendered, and the rest of the party collapsed.","As he charges out of the city and races towards Xuande at his base at Pingyuan, the rebels chase after him. Taishi Ci slays many of them until the rest give up the chase. On receiving the appeal from Kong Rong, Xuande, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, accompanied by three thousand warriors, set off for Beihai. The rebels don’t stand a chance. Even though they have many, many times more men than Xuande, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Taishi Ci charge forward, slashing their way through to the city gate. Meanwhile Xuande attacks the rest of the rebel army with the main divisions of his army, creating chaos among the rebels and sending them fleeing.","Thus he got clear away and rode in hot haste to Liu Bei. Taishi Ci reached Pingyuan, and after greeting his host in proper form he told how Kong Rong was surrounded and had sent him for help. Then he presented the letter which Liu Bei read. “And who are you?” asked Liu Bei. “I am Taishi Ci, a fellow from Laihuang. I am not related by ties of kin to Kong Rong, nor even by ties of neighborhood, but I am by the bonds of sentiment and I share his sorrows and misfortunes. The Yellow Scarves have invested his city, and he is distressed with none to turn to, and destruction is very near. You are known as humane, righteous, and eager to help the distressed. Therefore at his command I have braved all dangers and fought my way through his enemies to pray you save him.” Liu Bei smiled, saying, “ And does he know there is a Liu Bei in this world?” So Liu Bei, together with Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, told off three thousand troops and set out to help raise the siege. When the rebel leader Guan Hai saw these new forces arriving; he led out his army to fight them, thinking he could easily dispose of so small a force. The brothers and Taishi Ci with them sat on their horses in the forefront of their array. Guan Hai hastened forward. Taishi Ci was ready to fight, but Guan Yu had opened the combat. He rode forth and the two steeds met. The soldiers set up a great shout, for how could there be any doubt of the result? After a few bouts Guan Yu's green-dragon saber rose and fell, and with the stroke fell the rebel leader. This was the signal for Zhang Fei and Taishi Ci to take a share, and they advanced side by side. With their spears ready they dashed in, and Liu Bei urged forward his force. The besieged Governor saw his doughty rescuers laying low the rebels as tigers among a flock of sheep. None could withstand them, and he then sent out his own troops to join in the battle so that the rebels were between two armies. The rebels' force was completely broken and many troops surrendered, while the remainder scattered in all directions."

The report said: ""Guan Gong has given all the gold, silver and other items given by the seal. There are ten beauties, and they live in another inner room.

One general stood up and said, ""A certain willing to take three thousand iron cavalry to capture Guan Mou alive and present it to the prime minister!"" Everyone looked at him, and it was the general Cai Yang. Exactly:","The gatekeeper rushes to inform Cao Cao, while others arrive to say Guan Yu has taken none of the gifts. ‘Give me three thousand men, and I will capture him,’ cries Commander Cai Yang. As it has been said:","In the city, Guan Yu's letter reached the Prime Minister while he was consulting about what to do. He read it and exclaimed, “So he has left!” Then the warden of the gate came to report that Guan Yu had forced his way out, and was gone with a carriage, a horse, and a score of guards. Next came the servants from his house to report that he had left, taking nothing of the treasure, nor any one of the waiting maids. Everything was left in the house. Even his seal was there. His only escort were the few soldiers of his original force. Suddenly from the assembly of officers rose a voice, saying, “With three thousand of mailed horse, I will bring him back alive.” Their eyes turned to the speaker, who was General Cai Yang. On the dragon's cave he turns his back,"

Bu Chen was silent.","For example, adviser Xue Zong raises the question of what Kong Ming thinks of Cao Cao.","Next, Bu Zhi, who was among those seated, said, “Will you talk of our southern land with a tongue like the tongues of the persuaders Zhang Yi and Su Qin in the ancient time?” 1 Zhuge Liang replied, “You regard those two as mere speculative talkers; you do not recognize them also as heroes. Su Qin bore the Prime Ministers' seals of six federated states; Zhang Yi was twice Prime Minister of the state of Qin. Both were men of conspicuous ability who brought about the reformation of their governments. They are not to be compared with those who quail before the strong and overbear the weak, who fear the dagger and run away from the sword. You, Sir, have listened to Cao Cao's crafty and empty threat, and it has frightened you into advising surrender. Dare you ridicule Su Qin and Zhang Yi?” Bu Zhi was silenced."

却說曹操回軍，曹仁接着，言呂布勢大，更有陳宮為輔，兗州、濮陽已失，其鄄城、東阿、范縣三處，賴荀彧、程昱二人設計相連，死守城郭。操曰：“吾料呂布有勇無謀，不足慮也。”敎且安營下寨，再作商議。呂布知曹操回兵，已過滕縣，召副將薛蘭、李封曰：“吾欲用汝二人久矣。汝可引軍一萬，堅守兗州。吾親自率兵，前去破曹。”二人應諾。陳宮急入見曰：“將軍棄兗州，欲何往乎？”布曰：“吾欲屯兵濮陽，以成鼎足之勢。”宮曰：“差矣：薛蘭必守兗州不住。此去正南一百八十里，泰山路險，可伏精兵萬人在彼。曹兵聞失兗州，必然倍道而進，待其過半，一擊可擒也。”布曰：“吾屯濮陽，別有良謀，汝豈知之！”遂不用陳宮之言，而用薛蘭守兗州而行。曹操兵行至泰山險路，郭嘉曰：“且不可進：恐此處有伏兵。”曹操笑曰：“呂布無謀之輩，故敎薛蘭守兗州，自往濮陽；安得此處有埋伏耶？”敎曹仁：“領一軍圍兗州，吾進兵濮陽，速攻呂布。”陳宮聞曹兵至近，乃獻計曰：“今曹兵遠來疲困，利在速戰，不可養成氣力。”布曰：“吾匹馬縱橫天下，何愁曹操！待其下寨，吾自擒之。”,"But they said that Cao Cao returned to the army, and Cao Ren followed, saying that Lv Bu was powerful, and Chen Gong was supplemented. Yanzhou and Puyang had been lost, and the three places of Juancheng, Dong'e, and Fanxian were designed to be connected by Lai Xunyu and Cheng Yu. Defend the castle. Cao said, ""I think Lü Bu is brave and has no plans, and he is not enough to worry about it."" Lü Bu knew that Cao Cao was returning and had already passed Teng County. He summoned his lieutenants, Xue Lan and Li Feng, and said, ""I have wanted to use you two for a long time. You can lead an army of 10,000 troops to defend Yanzhou. ."" The two agreed. Chen Gong rushed to see him and said, ""The general has abandoned Yanzhou, where do you want to go?"" Bu said: ""I want to station troops in Puyang, so that I can become a cauldron."" Gong said: ""It's too bad: Xue Lan will not be able to defend Yanzhou. This is the right way to go. One hundred and eighty li to the south, the road to Mount Tai is perilous, and thousands of elite soldiers can be ambushed there. When Cao soldiers heard that Yanzhou was lost, they would definitely advance in a double way. You don't have a good plan, you don't know it!"" So instead of Chen Gong's words, he used Xue Lan to guard Yanzhou. Cao Cao's troops went to the dangerous road of Mount Tai, and Guo Jia said, ""Don't enter: I'm afraid there will be an ambush here."" Cao Cao laughed and said, ""Lv Bu has no plan, so he ordered Xue Lan to guard Yanzhou and go to Puyang; And there is an ambush here. Instruct Cao Ren: ""Lead an army to surround Yanzhou, and I will advance to Puyang to attack Lü Bu quickly."" Chen Gong heard that Cao's soldiers were approaching, so he offered a plan: ""Today, Cao's soldiers are tired and tired, and the advantage is to fight quickly, so don't develop strength."" Bu said, """" My horses are all over the world, why worry about Cao Cao! When he goes down to the fort, I will capture him.""","In honour of the success that Xuande has appeared to achieve in removing Cao Cao from the area, Tao Qian twice offers him the governorship of Xuzhou.","Cao Ren met and told him, “Lu Bu is very powerful, and he has Chen Gong as adviser. Yanzhou is as good as lost, with the exception of three counties which have been vigorously and desperately defended by Xun Yu and Cheng Yu.” Cao Cao said, “I own that Lu Bu is a bold fighter but nothing more; he has no craft. So we need not fear him seriously.” Then he gave orders to make a strong camp till they could think out some victorious plan. Lu Bu, knowing of Cao Cao's return, called two of his subordinate generals, Xue Lan and Li Feng, to him and assigned to them the task of holding the city of Yanzhou, saying, “I have long waited for opportunity to employ your skill; now I give you ten thousand soldiers, and you are to hold the city while I go forth to attack Cao Cao.” They accepted. But Chen Gong, the strategist, came in hastily, saying, “General, you are going away; whither?” “I am going to camp my troops at Puyang, that vantage point.” “You are making a mistake,” said Chen Gong. “The two you have chosen to defend this city are unequal to the task. For this expedition remember that about sixty miles due south, on the treacherous road to the Taishan Mountains, is a very advantageous position where you should place your best men in ambush. Cao Cao will hasten homeward by double marches when he hears what has happened; and if you strike when half his troops have gone past this point, you may seize him.” Said Lu Bu, “I am going to occupy Puyang and see what develops. How can you guess my big plan?” So Lu Bu left Xue Lan in command at Yanzhou and went away. Now when Cao Cao approached the dangerous part of the road near the Taishan Mountains, Guo Jia warned him to take care as there was doubtless an ambush. But Cao Cao laughed, saying, “We know all Lu Bu's dispositions. Xue Lan is keeping the city. Do you think Lu Bu has laid an ambush? I shall tell Cao Ren to besiege Yanzhou, and I shall go to Puyang.” In Puyang, when Chen Gong heard of the enemy's approach he spoke, saying, “The enemy will be fatigued with long marches so attack quickly before they have time to recover.” Lu Bu replied, “I, a single horseman, am afraid of none. I go and come as I will. Think you I fear this Cao Cao? Let him settle his camp; I will take him after that.”"

次日平明，城外喊聲震地。呂布大驚，提戟上城，各門點視，責罵魏續走透侯成，失了戰馬，欲待治罪。城下曹兵望見城上白旗，竭力攻城，布只得親自抵敵。從平明直打到日中，曹兵稍退。布少憩門樓，不覺睡着在椅上。宋憲趕退左右，先盜其畫戟，便與魏續一齊動手，將呂布繩纏索綁，緊緊縛住。布從睡夢中驚醒，急喚左右，却都被二人殺散，把白旗一招，曹兵齊至城下。魏續大叫：“已生擒呂布矣！”夏侯淵尚未信。宋憲在城上擲下呂布畫戟來，大開城門，曹兵一擁而入。高順、張遼在西門，水圍難出，為曹兵所擒。陳宮奔至南門，為徐晃所獲。,"The next day it was dawn, and shouts from outside the city shook the ground. Lü Bu was startled, took his halberd and went up to the city, all the gates looked at him, scolding Wei Xu for going through Hou Cheng, losing his horse, and waiting to be punished. Cao soldiers under the city saw the white flag on the city and tried their best to attack the city, but Bu had to fight the enemy himself. From Pingming to Japan and China, Cao's troops retreated slightly. Bu Shao rested at the gatehouse and fell asleep on the chair unconsciously. Song Xian rushed back to the left and right, first stole his painted halberd, and then joined Wei Xu to tie Lu Bu's ropes and tie them tightly. Bu woke up from his sleep and called to the left and right, but they were both killed and scattered, and with a move of the white flag, Cao's troops rushed to the bottom of the city. Wei Xu shouted, ""Lu Bu has already been captured!"" Xiahou Yuan did not believe it yet. Song Xian threw Lu Bu's halberd on the city, opened the city gate, and Cao soldiers rushed in. Gao Shun and Zhang Liao were at the west gate, but the water siege was difficult to get out, so they were captured by Cao soldiers. Chen Gong rushed to the south gate and was captured by Xu Huang.",Wei Xu then shouts down to Cao Cao that Lü Bu is now their prisoner and opens the city gates.,"Next day at daylight a tremendous hubbub was heard without the city and Lu Bu, halberd in hand, hasted to the wall to see what it meant. As he went from gate to gate inspecting the defenses and guards, he censured Wei Xu for letting Hou Cheng escape and get away with his horse. Lu Bu threatened to punish Wei Xu. But just then the besiegers began a fierce attack as the white flag had just appeared, and Lu Bu had to turn all his energies to defense. The assault lasted till noon, when the attacking force drew off for a time. Lu Bu was taking a rest in the tower and fell asleep in his chair. Song Xian sent away Lu Bu's attendants; and when they had gone, he stole Lu Bu's weapon, the trident halberd in which he trusted. Then Song Xian and Wei Xu fell upon Lu Bu together and before he was well awake had bound him with cords, trussing him so that he could not move. Lu Bu shouted for his guards, but they were driven off by the two traitor generals and could not come near. Then a white flag was shown, and the besiegers again approached the city. The traitors shouted out, “Lu Bu has been captured alive!” But Xiahou Yuan could hardly believe it till they threw down the famous halberd. The gates were flung open, and the enemy entered the city. Gao Shun and Zhang Liao, who were at the opposite gate, were surrounded and cut off by the water and helpless. They were captured. Chen Gong made a dash to the south gate but was also taken by Xu Huang."
天色微明，黑雲罩地，東南風尚不息。忽然大雨傾盆，濕透衣甲。操與軍士冒雨而行，諸軍皆有飢色。操令軍士往村落中劫掠糧食，尋覓火種。方欲造飯，後面一軍趕到。操心甚慌。原來却是李典、許褚保謢着衆謀士來到。操大喜，令軍馬且行，問：“前面是那裏地面？”人報：“一邊是南彝陵大路，一邊是北彝陵山路。”操問：“那裏投南郡江陵去近？”軍士稟曰：“取南彝陵過葫蘆口去最便。”操敎走南彝陵。行至葫蘆口。軍皆飢餒，行走不上，馬亦困乏，多有倒於路者。操敎前面暫歇。馬上有帶得鑼鍋的。也有村中掠得糧米的，便就山邊揀乾處埋鍋造飯，割馬肉燒吃。盡皆脫去濕衣，於風頭吹晒。馬皆摘鞍野放，咽咬草根。操坐於疎林之下，仰面大笑。衆官問曰：“適來丞相笑周瑜、諸葛亮，引惹出趙子龍來，又折了許多人馬。如今為何又笑？”操曰：“吾笑諸葛亮、周瑜畢竟智謀不足。若是我用兵時，就這個去處，也埋伏一彪軍馬，以逸待勞；我等縱然脫得性命，也不免重傷矣。彼見不到此。我是以笑之。”正說間，前軍後軍一齊發喊。操大驚，棄甲上馬。衆軍多有不及收馬者。早見四下火煙布合，山口一軍擺開，為首乃燕人張翼德，橫矛立馬，大叫：“操賊走那裏去！”諸軍衆將見了張飛，盡皆膽寒。許褚騎無鞍馬來戰張飛。張遼，徐晃二將，縱馬也來夾攻。兩邊軍馬混戰做一團。操先撥馬走脫，諸將各自脫身。張飛從後趕來。操迤邐奔逃，追兵漸遠，回顧衆將多已帶傷。,"The sky is twilight, black clouds cover the ground, and the southeast is still in the air. Suddenly a heavy rain poured down, soaking the clothes and armor. Cao and the soldiers walked in the rain, and all the troops were hungry. Order the sergeant to loot the food in the village and look for fire. Fang wanted to make rice, but an army arrived from behind. Worry so much. It turned out that it was Li Dian and Xu Chubao who came with the advisors. Cao was overjoyed and ordered the horses to move on, asking, ""Where is the ground ahead?"" The man reported, ""On one side is the South Yiling Road, and on the other is the North Yiling Mountain Road."" Cao asked, ""Where to go to Jiangling in Nanjun?"" : ""It is most convenient to take Nanyi Mausoleum and go through Hulukou."" Cao taught him to go to Nanyi Mausoleum. Go to Hulukou. The army was starving, unable to walk, the horses were tired, and many fell to the road. Take a break in front of the fuck. There will be gong pots soon. There are also people in the village who have plundered grain and rice. They all took off their wet clothes and let them dry in the wind. The horses all pick their saddles and put them in the wild, their throats biting the grass roots. Cao sat under the forest and laughed on his back. The officials asked, ""The prime minister laughed at Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang, which led to Zhao Zilong, and he broke many people. Why are you laughing now?"" At this place, I am also ambushing a troop of military horses, waiting for work; even if we escape, we will still be seriously injured. He can't see this. I am laughing at it."" As he was talking, the front and rear soldiers shouted together. Frightened, he abandoned his armor and mounted his horse. There are many troops who can't take horses in time. As soon as they saw the fire and smoke coming together, the Yamaguchi army spread out, led by Zhang Yide from Yan, and immediately shouted: ""Go there with the thief!"" Xu Chu rode a bareback horse to fight Zhang Fei. Zhang Liao and Xu Huang, the second generals, also attacked with horses. The horses on both sides scuffled together. Cao steered the horse to get away, and the generals got out of their own way. Zhang Fei came from behind. Cao ran away and chased the troops farther and farther. Looking back, many of the generals were wounded.","Then the heavens open, and torrential rain falls upon them all. By now the men with Cao Cao are exhausted and starving. Realizing this, Cao Cao sends scavenging parties out to loot local villages of food, and soon a fire is burning to cook the food. Here they are joined by a few more men led by Xu Chu and Li Dian. When it is time to move on, Cao asks where they are and is told they are at a fork in the road. One leads to South Yiling and the other, over the mountain, leads to North Yiling. Following advice, he leads his party off towards Hulukou – the pass on the way to North Yiling. Reaching the pass, and realizing how exhausted his men and horses are, Cao Cao orders a rest break. Fires start, food is cooked and the horses are turned loose while the men try to dry their sodden clothes. Suddenly Cao Cao bursts out laughing again. Deeply troubled, the men say, ‘Last time you laughed at Zhou Yu and Kong Ming this brought disaster, and Zhao Zilong attacked us. So what’re you laughing about now?’ ‘Well,’ says Cao Cao, ‘to tell the truth, at the foolishness of Zhou Yu and Kong Ming, because this is a perfect place for an ambush, especially of men who are exhausted.’ Once again, no sooner has he said this than war cries erupt all around them! This time Cao Cao in panic throws aside his armour and leaps on his horse to escape once again, but most of his men have no time to mount. They are soon surrounded by the attackers, who are led by none other than Zhang Fei. He questions some of the men who are captured and tries to discover where Cao Cao is or has gone. But soon he is caught up in a fight against Zhang Liao and Xu Huang. They deliberately block him until Cao Cao has made good his escape. But then Zhang Fei breaks free and sets off on the trail of Cao Cao. Cao Cao pauses in his flight, and one of the soldiers asks which of the two roads ahead they should take.","The faint light of dawn showed a great black cloud all around, for the southeast wind had not ceased. Suddenly began a heavy downpour of rain, wetting every one to the skin, but still Cao Cao maintained his headlong flight till the starved faces of the soldiers made a halt imperative. He told the men to forage in the villages about for grain and the means of making a fire. But when these had been found and they began to cook a meal, another pursuing party came along, and Cao Cao again was terrified. However, these proved to be Li Dian and Xu Chu escorting some of his advisers whom he saw with joy. When giving the order to advance again, Cao Cao asked, “What places lay ahead?” They told him, “There are two roads; one was the highway to South Yiling, and the other a mountain road to North Yiling.” “Which is the shorter way to Jiangling?” asked Cao Cao. “The best way is to take the south road through Hulu Valley,” was the reply. So Cao Cao gave orders to march that way. By the time Hulu Valley was reached, the soldiers were almost starving and could march no more; horses too were worn out. Many had fallen by the roadside. A halt was then made, food was taken by force from the villagers, and as there were still some boilers left, they found a dry spot beside the hills where they could rest and cook. And there they began to prepare a meal, boiling grain, and roasting strips of horse flesh. Then they took off their wet clothes and spread them to dry. The beasts, too, were unsaddled and turned out to graze. Seated comfortably in a somewhat open spot, Cao Cao suddenly looked up and began to laugh loud and long. His companions, remembering the sequel of his last laugh, said, “Not long since, Sir, you laughed at Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang; that resulted in the arrival of Zhao Yun and great loss of troops to us. Why do you now laugh?” “I am laughing again at the ignorance of the same two men. If I were in their place, and conducting their campaign, I should have had an ambush here, just to meet us when we were tired out. Then, even if we escaped with our lives, we should suffer very severely. They did not see this, and therefore I am laughing at them.” Even at that moment behind them rose a great yell. Thoroughly startled, Cao Cao threw aside his breastplate and leaped upon his horse. Most of the soldiers failed to catch theirs, and then fires sprang up on every side and filled the mouth of the valley. A force was arrayed before them and at the head was the man of ancient Yan, Zhang Fei, seated on his steed with his great spear leveled. “Whither would you flee, O rebel?” shouted he. The soldiers grew cold within at the sight of the terrible warrior. Xu Chu, mounted on a bare-backed horse, rode up to engage him, and Zhang Liao and Xu Huang galloped up to his aid. The three gathered about Zhang Fei and a melee began, while Cao Cao made off at top speed. The other leaders set off after him, and Zhang Fei pursued. However, Cao Cao by dint of hard riding got away, and gradually the pursuers were out-distanced. But many had received wounds."

且說曹操旣殺了董承等衆人，怒氣未消，遂帶劍入宮，來弒董貴妃。貴妃乃董承之妹，帝幸之，已懷孕五月。當日帝在後宮，正與伏皇后私論董承之事，至今尚無音耗。忽見曹操帶劍入宮，面有怒容，帝大驚失色。操曰：“董承謀反，陛下知否？”帝曰：“董卓已誅矣。”操大聲曰：“不是董卓！是董承！”帝戰慄曰：“朕實不知。”操曰：“忘了破指修詔耶？”帝不能答。操叱武士擒董妃至。帝告曰：“董妃有五月身孕，望丞相相憐。”操曰：“若非天敗，吾已被害。豈得復留此女，為吾後患？”伏后告曰：“貶於冷宮，待分娩了，殺之未遲。”操曰：“欲留此逆種，為母報讎乎？”董妃泣告曰：“乞全屍而死，勿令彰露。”操令取白練至面前。帝泣謂妃曰：“卿於九泉之下，勿怨朕躬！”言訖，淚下如兩。伏后亦大哭。操怒曰：“猶作兒女態耶！”叱武士牽出，勒死於宮門之外。後人有詩歎董妃曰：,"Let's say that Cao Cao killed Dong Cheng and the others, but his anger still did not subside, so he brought his sword into the palace and came to kill Dong Guifei. The imperial concubine is Dong Cheng's sister, Emperor Xingzhi, who is five months pregnant. That day, the emperor was in the harem, and he was discussing the matter of Dong Cheng with Empress Fu in private, and so far there has been no sound. Suddenly seeing Cao Cao bringing his sword into the palace with an angry look on his face, the emperor was shocked. Cao said, ""Dong Cheng is conspiring against him, does your majesty know?"" The emperor said, ""Dong Zhuo has been executed."" Cao said loudly, ""It's not Dong Zhuo! It's Dong Cheng!"" The emperor trembled and said, ""I really don't know."" Cao said: ""Forgot to break the finger and repair the edict?"" The emperor couldn't answer. Cao scolding the warriors to capture Dong Fei. The emperor said: ""Concubine Dong is pregnant in five months, and I hope the prime minister will take pity on each other."" Cao said: ""If it were not for the defeat of heaven, I would have been killed. How can I keep this girl, for my future trouble?"" Cold Palace, it is not too late to kill after giving birth."" Cao said: ""If you want to keep this inverse seed, do you want to repay the mother?"" Take white practice to the front. The emperor cried and said to the concubine: ""Your Excellency is under the Jiuquan, don't blame me for bowing!"" After saying this, tears flowed down like two. Fu Hou also cried. Cao said angrily, ""You're still like a child!"" The warrior was led out and strangled to death outside the palace gate. Later generations have a poem to sigh Concubine Dong and say:","Cao Cao still seeks revenge, and his chosen victim is none other than the emperor’s concubine, the sister of Dong Cheng. The emperor is just discussing with his empress that he has heard nothing yet from Dong Cheng about how the plot is going when in bursts Cao Cao with his sword drawn. When confronted with news of the plot and of the discovery of the edict written in blood, the emperor is speechless. Cao Cao orders the concubine to be brought in and, despite the pleas of the emperor that she is in the fifth month of her pregnancy, he orders her death. Even when the empress offers to take her place, Cao Cao is unmoved. She is forced out of the hall and strangled. He then orders the sealing off of the imperial family and posts three thousand of his own guards to ensure no one","The Emperor's consort was a sister of Dong Cheng; and, sword in hand, Cao Cao went into the Palace determined to slay her also. The Emperor cherished her tenderly, the more so as she was then in the fifth month of pregnancy. That day, as they often did, the Emperor, Consort Dong, and Empress Fu were sitting in their private apartment secretly talking of the decree entrusted to Dong Cheng and asking each other why nothing seemed to have been done. The sudden appearance of the angry Prime Minister, armed as he was, frightened them greatly. “Does Your Majesty know that Dong Cheng conspired against me?” said he. “Dong Zhuo died long ago,” replied the Emperor. “Not Dong Zhuo—Dong Cheng!” roared Cao Cao. The Emperor's heart trembled but he gasped out, “Really I did not know!” “So the cut finger and the blood written decree are all forgotten, eh?” The Emperor was silent. Cao Cao bade his lictors seize Consort Dong. The Emperor interposed asking pity for her condition. “If Heaven had not interposed and defeated the plot, I should be a dead man. How could I leave this woman to work evil to me by and by?” Said the Emperor, “Immure her in one of the palaces till her confinement. Do not harm her now!” “Do you wish me to spare her offspring to avenge the mother?” said Cao Cao. “I pray that my body may be spared mutilation and not put to shame,” said Consort Dong. Cao Cao bade his men show her the white silk cord. The Emperor wept bitterly. “Do not hate me in the below realms of the Nine Golden Springs,” said the Emperor to her. His tears fell like rain. Empress Fu also joined in the lament, but Cao Cao said, “You are behaving like a lot of children.” And he told the lictors to take Consort Dong away and strangle her in the courtyard. In vain had the fair girl found favor in the sight of her lord."

Whereupon Cao Cao was smitten at Xuzhou, and his territory was snatched by Lu Bu. He fled eastward without shelter or refuge. “My policy is a strong trunk and weak branches, a commanding central government and obedient feudal lords. Also I am no partisan. Therefore I again raised my banners, donned my armor, and moved forward to attack. My drums rolled for an assault on Lu Bu, and his multitudes incontinently fled.

却說周瑜雖患瘡痛，心中自有主張；已知曹兵常來寨前叫罵，却不見衆將來稟。一日，曹仁自引大軍，擂鼓吶喊，前來搦戰。程普拒住不出。周瑜喚衆將入帳問曰：“何處鼓譟吶喊？”衆將曰：“軍中敎演士卒。”瑜怒曰：“何欺我也！吾已知曹兵常來寨前辱罵。程德謀旣同掌兵權，何故坐視？”遂命人請程普入帳問之。普曰：“吾見公瑾病瘡，醫者言勿觸怒，故曹兵搦戰，不敢報知。”瑜曰：“公等不戰，主意若何？”普曰：“衆將皆欲收兵暫回江東。待公箭瘡平復，再作區處。”瑜聽罷，於牀上奮然躍起曰：“大丈夫旣食君祿，當死於戰場，以馬革裹屍還，幸也！豈可為我一人，而廢國家大事乎？”言訖，卽披甲上馬。諸軍衆將，無不駭然。遂引數百騎出營前。望見曹兵已布成陣勢，曹仁自立馬於門旗下，揚鞭大罵曰：“周瑜孺子，料必橫夭，再不敢正覷我兵！”罵猶未絕，瑜從羣騎內突然出曰：“曹仁匹夫！見周郎否！”曹軍看見，盡皆驚駭。曹仁回顧衆將曰：“可大罵之！”衆軍厲聲大罵。周瑜大怒，使潘璋出戰。未及交鋒，周瑜忽大叫一聲，口中噴血，墜於馬下。曹兵衝來，衆將向前抵住，混戰一場，救起周瑜，回到帳中。程普問曰：“都督貴體若何？”瑜密謂普曰：“此吾之計也。”普曰：“計將安出？”瑜曰：“吾身本無甚痛楚；吾所以為此者，欲令曹兵知我病危，必然欺敵。可使心腹軍士去城中詐降，說吾已死。今夜曹仁必來劫寨。吾却於四下埋伏以應之，則曹仁可一鼓而擒也。”程普曰：“此計大妙！”隨就帳下舉起哀聲。衆軍大驚，盡傳言都督箭瘡大發而死，各寨盡皆挂孝。,"However, he said that although Zhou Yu was suffering from sores, he had his own opinions in his heart; he knew that Cao soldiers often came to the fort to scold him, but he did not see any future complaints. One day, Cao Ren led his army, beating drums and shouting, and came to fight. Cheng Pu couldn't resist. Zhou Yu called the generals into the tent and asked, ""Where are you shouting and shouting?"" The generals said: ""The army will teach soldiers to act."" Yu said angrily, ""Why are you bullying me! I know that Cao soldiers often come to the front of the village to insult. Cheng Demou Yantong is in charge of the army, why do you sit back and watch?"" He then ordered someone to ask Cheng Pu to enter the account. Pu said: ""I saw that Gong Jin was sick and sore, and the doctor said that he should not be angry, so Cao's soldiers did not dare to report the battle."" Yu said, ""What is your plan if you don't fight?"" Pu said, ""All the generals want to withdraw their troops for a while. Return to Jiangdong. When the sores of Gongjian are healed, he will relocate to the district."" After listening to Yu, he jumped up on the bed and said, ""My husband, who is eating the emperor's wealth, should die on the battlefield and return his body wrapped in horse leather. Fortunately, you can be me alone. What about abolishing the country?"" After saying this, you put on his armor and mounted his horse. All the generals were astonished. Then he led hundreds of horsemen out of the camp. Seeing that Cao's troops had formed a formation, Cao Ren immediately stood under the banner of the gate, and shouted loudly, ""Zhou Yu is a son of a bitch, you are expected to die, don't dare to look at my soldiers!"" He went out and said, ""Cao Ren's husband! Do you see Zhou Lang?"" Cao Ren looked back at the generals and said, ""You can scold him!"" The army shouted loudly. Zhou Yu was furious and sent Pan Zhang to fight. Before the confrontation, Zhou Yu suddenly shouted, blood spurted from his mouth, and fell under the horse. Cao's soldiers rushed forward, and all the generals held on to them. After a scuffle, Zhou Yu was rescued and returned to the tent. Cheng Pu asked, ""What's your body like?"" Yumi said to Pu, ""This is my plan."" Pu said, ""The plan will come out?"" Yu said, ""I don't have much pain; This person, if you want to let Cao soldiers know that I am critically ill, you must deceive the enemy. You can make the confidant soldiers go to the city to deceive and say that I am dead. Tonight, Cao Ren will come to rob the village. I am lying in ambush everywhere to respond, then Cao Ren can be a drummer. And capture it."" Cheng Pu said, ""This is a great plan!"" He then raised a moan from the tent. All the troops were shocked, and it was rumored that the governor died of arrow wounds, and all the villages were filial piety.","However, one of Cao Ren ’s commanders can’t resist riding out each day to hurl insults and taunts at the enemy. On one of these days, Zhou Yu asks what all the fuss is – knowing full well that his men are being challenged. His men try to lie to him, saying the noise is his own men in training, but he tells them to call Cheng Pu to come to see him. ‘Why have you done nothing about this abuse and challenge?’ asks Zhou Yu. ‘The doctor says you need to rest,’ replies Cheng Pu, ‘and that you mustn’t be upset. That’s why I haven’t told you about this.’ ‘But why,’ persists Zhou Yu, ‘have you refused to fight?’ ‘Your officers feel we should retreat south and wait until you’ve recovered before we attack again,’ says Cheng Pu. Furious at this reply, Zhou struggles up from his sickbed and says, ‘Any man worthy of the name will wish to die in the service of his lord and to be brought home wrapped in horsehide as a hero. Don’t fail our cause and claim you do this for me! Standing up, he dons his armour and calls for his horse, which he mounts, leaving his officers stunned. Followed by hundreds of horsemen, Zhou Yu rides to the front of the camp, where Cao Cao’s men are waiting. Cao Ren himself is there and, seeing the enemy advancing, he cries out, ‘Zhou Yu! You baby! So fate has caught up with you, and you’re such a coward you dare not face me!’ At this Zhou Yu charges forward, shouting, ‘Cao Ren, you worthless creature! Can you see me now?’ The sight of Zhou Yu terrifies the enemy. To rally them, Cao Ren calls upon his men to hurl abuse at Zhou Yu. In response, Zhou Yu sends his champion to fight, but before even a single blow is given, Zhou Yu slumps forward, crying out loudly, and falls from his horse, blood pouring from his mouth. Seeing this, Cao Ren urges his men to the attack, and battle commences. No one is quite sure what is happening, and confusion reigns. Meanwhile, in the chaos, his officers rescue Zhou Yu and carry him back to the safety of his tent. Anxiously Cheng Pu asks how he is feeling, to which Zhou mutters, ‘It’s a trick that I’ve played! I’m not really that ill but I wanted the enemy to believe that I’m dying. Send some men who will pretend to desert and let them tell the enemy that I’ve died. Tonight they’ll attack, thinking that you’ll all be in mourning. But in reality we’ll ambush them when they attack.’ So it is that soon the sound of mourning arises from the tent and then from the whole camp.","Ill as he was, Zhou Yu still retained control of the expedition. He knew that the enemy came daily to the gates of his camp and reviled him, although none of his officers told him. One day Cao Ren came in person, and there was much rolling of drums and shouting. Cheng Pu, however, steadily refused to accept the challenge and would not let any one go out. Then Zhou Yu summoned the officers to his bedside and said, “What mean the drums and the shouting?” “The soldiers are drilling,” was the reply. “Why do you deceive me?” said Zhou Yu angrily. “Do I not know that our enemies come day by day to our gates and insult us? Yet Cheng Pu suffers this in silence and makes no use of his powers and authority.” He sent for Cheng Pu and, when he arrived, asked him why he acted thus. “Because you are ill, and the physician said you were on no account to be provoked to anger. Wherefore, although the enemy challenged us to battle, I kept it from you.” “And if you do not fight, what think you should be done?” said Zhou Yu. And they all said they desired to return to the South Land till he had recovered from his wound, when they would make another expedition. Zhou Yu lay and listened. Suddenly he sprang up, crying, “The noble person who has eaten of his lord's bounty should die in his lord's battles; to return to one's home dead and wrapped in a horse's hide is a happy fate. Am I the sort of people to bring to nought the grand designs of my country?” So speaking he proceeded to gird on his armor and he mounted his horse. The wonder of the officers only redoubled when their General placed himself at the head of some hundreds of horsemen and went out of the camp gates toward the enemy, then fully arrayed. Cao Ren, their general, stood beneath the great standard. At sight of the opponents, Cao Ren flourished his whip and began to hurl abuse at them, “Zhou Yu, you babe! I think your fate has met you. You dare not face my army.” The stream of insult never ceased. Presently Zhou Yu could stand it no longer. Riding out to the front he cried, “Here I am, base churl; look at me!” The whole Cao Ren's army were taken aback. But Cao Ren turned to those about him and said, “Let us all revile him!” And the whole army yelled insults. Zhou Yu grew angry and sent Pan Zhang out to fight. But before he had delivered his first blow, Zhou Yu suddenly uttered a loud cry, and he fell to the ground with blood gushing from his mouth. At this Cao Ren's army rushed to the battle, and the army of the South Land pressed forward to meet them. A fierce struggle waged around the General's body, but he was borne off safely and taken to his tent. “Do you feel better?” asked Cheng Pu anxiously. “It was a ruse of mine,” whispered Zhou Yu in reply. “But what avails it?” “I am not suffering, but I did that to make our enemies think I was very ill and so oppose them by deceit. I will send a few trusty men to pretend desertion and tell them I am dead. That will cause them to try a night raid on the camp, and we shall have an ambush ready for them. We shall get Cao Ren easily.” “The plan seems excellent,” said Cheng Pu. Soon from the tent there arose the sound of wailing as for the dead. The soldiers around took up the cry and said one to another, “The General is dead of his wound,” and they all put on the symbols of mourning."

却說曹操平了山東，表奏朝廷，加操為建德將軍費亭侯。其時李傕自為大司馬，郭汜自為大將軍，橫行無忌，朝廷無人敢言。太尉楊彪、大司農朱儁暗奏獻帝曰：“今曹操擁兵二十餘萬，謀臣武將數十員，若得此人扶持社稷，剿除奸黨，天下幸甚。”獻帝泣曰：“朕被二賊欺凌久矣，若得誅之，誠為大幸！”彪奏曰：“臣有一計，先令二賊自相殘害；然後詔曹操引兵殺之，掃淸賊黨，以安朝廷。”獻帝曰：“計將安出？”彪曰：“聞郭汜之妻最妒，可令人於汜妻處用反間計，則二賊自相害矣。”,"However, he said that Cao Cao had leveled Shandong, represented the court, and added Cao as the general of Jiande Fei Tinghou. At that time, Li Jue was the chief Sima, and Guo Si was the general. Taiwei Yang Biao and Da Sinong Zhu Jun secretly played Emperor Xian and said: ""Today Cao Cao has more than 200,000 troops, and dozens of military officials. ""I have been bullied by two thieves for a long time. If I can execute him, I will be truly fortunate!"" Biao said, ""I have a plan, first order the two thieves to kill each other, and then order Cao Cao to lead troops to kill him, to sweep away the gang of thieves. In order to secure the court."" Emperor Xian said, ""The plan will be released?"" Biao said, ""I heard that Guo Si's wife is the most jealous, and if you can make someone use the opposite plan at Si's wife's place, then the two thieves will harm each other.""","But the imperial court is not in good shape. The rebel leaders Li Jue and Guo Si are ruthlessly exploiting the power they have seized. The whole court lives in fear of them. The emperor is in despair. Not even the suggestion that Cao Cao as a famous hero could attack the rebels can consol the emperor. Such is the state of affairs when Yang Biao, one of the ministers, comes up with a plan.","He memorialized the Throne and was rewarded with the title of General Who Exhibits Firm Virtue and Lord of Feiting. At this time the rebellious Li Jue was commanding the court, and he had made himself Regent Marshal, and his colleague Guo Si styled himself Grand Commander. Their conduct was abominable but no one dared to criticize them. Imperial Guardian Yang Biao and Minister Zhu Jun privately talked with Emperor Xian and said, “Cao Cao has two hundred thousand troops and many capable advisers and leaders; it would be well for the empire if he would lend his support to the imperial family and help to rid the government of this evil party.” His Majesty wept, “I am weary of the insults and contempt of these wretches and should be very glad to have them removed.” “I have thought of a plan to estrange Li Jue and Guo Si and so make them destroy each other. Then Cao Cao could come and cleanse the court,” said Yang Biao. “How will you manage it?” asked the Emperor. “Guo Si's wife, Lady Qiong, is very jealous, and we can take advantage of her weakness to bring about a quarrel.”"
衆將拜伏問安，操仰面笑曰：“誤中匹夫之計，吾必當報之！”郭嘉曰：“計可速發。”操曰：“今只將計就計：詐言我被火傷，已經身死。布必引兵來攻。我伏兵於馬陵山中，候其兵半渡而擊之，布可擒矣。”嘉曰：“眞良策也！”於是令軍士挂孝發喪，詐言操死。早有人來濮陽報呂布，說曹操被火燒傷肢體，到寨身死。布隨點起軍馬，殺奔馬陵山來。將到操寨，一聲鼓響，伏兵四起。呂布死戰得脫，折了好些人馬；敗回濮陽，堅守不出。是年蝗蟲忽起，食盡禾稻。關東一境，每榖一斛，直錢五十貫，人民相食。曹操因軍中糧盡，引回鄄城暫住。呂布亦引兵出屯山陽就食。因此二處權且罷兵。,"The generals bowed their heads and said goodbye. Cao smiled and said, ""I have made a mistake in the plan of the husband, and I will report it!"" Guo Jia said: ""The plan can be launched quickly."" I am already dead. Bu will lead troops to attack. I ambushing my soldiers in the Maling Mountains, waiting for their soldiers to cross and attack them, and Bu can be captured."" Jia said: ""It is a good strategy!"" Talk to death. Someone had come to Puyang to report to Lv Bu long ago, saying that Cao Cao had been burned by fire and died in the village. Bu Sui ordered his army horses and rushed to Maling Mountain. When they were about to reach Cao Zhai, a drum sounded, and soldiers were ambushed. Lu Bu was able to escape in a deadly battle, and he broke many troops; he was defeated and returned to Puyang, but he could not hold on. That year, locusts suddenly arose and ate up the rice. In the Kanto region, each grain of dendrobium is worth 50 straight coins, and the people eat each other. Cao Cao was led back to Juancheng for a temporary stay because his army was running out of food. Lü Bu also led his troops out of Tunshanyang to eat. Therefore, the second division of power and dismissed the soldiers.","In the light of such a disaster and such a trick, Cao Cao discusses with his staff what to do next. It is decided that they will resort to such tricks of their own. Cao Cao’s men spread the rumour that Cao Cao has died. Assuming that this will mean Cao’s men will be in chaos and distress at such a turn of events, Lü Bu decides to attack. This time it is Lü Bu who is caught in a trap, and his men are overwhelmed. Lü Bu barely escapes with his life! Neither side has gained the upper hand. It is in effect a stalemate. And so it is that a truce is declared between them.","His officers crowded about his tent, anxious for news of his health. He soon recovered and laughed when he thought of his escape. “I blundered into that fool's trap, but I will have my revenge,” said he. “Let us have a new plan soon,” said Guo Jia. “I will turn his trick to my own use. I will spread the false report that I was burned in the fire, and that I died at the fifth watch. He will come to attack as soon as the news gets abroad, and I will have an ambush ready for him in Maling Hills. I will get him this time.” “Really a fine stratagem!” said Guo Jia. So the soldiers were put into mourning, and the report went everywhere that Cao Cao was dead. And soon Lu Bu heard it, and he assembled his army at once to make a surprise attack, taking the road by the Maling Hills to his enemy's camp. As he was passing the hills, he heard the drums beating for an advance, and the ambushing soldiers leapt out all round him. Only by desperate fighting did he get out of the melee and with a sadly diminished force returned to his camp at Puyang. There he strengthened the fortifications and could not be tempted forth to battle. This year locusts suddenly appeared, and they consumed every green blade. There was a famine, and in the northeast grain rose to fifty “strings” of cash a cart. People even took to cannibalism. Cao Cao's army suffered from want, and he marched them to Juancheng. Lu Bu took his troops to Shanyang. Perforce therefore the fighting ceased."
二人歌罷，撫掌大笑。玄德曰：“臥龍其在此間乎？”遂下馬入店。見二人憑桌對飲：上首者白面長鬚，下首者淸奇古貌。玄德揖而問曰：“二公誰是臥龍先生？”長鬚者曰：“公何人？欲尋臥龍何幹？”玄德曰：“某乃劉備也。欲訪先生，求濟世安民之術。”長鬚者曰：“我等非臥龍，皆臥龍之友也：吾乃潁川石廣元，此位是汝南孟公威。”玄德喜曰：“備久聞二公大名，幸得邂逅。今有隨行馬匹在此，敢請二公同往臥龍莊上一談。”廣元曰：“吾等皆山野慷懶之徒，不省治國安民之事，不勞下問。明公請自上馬，尋訪臥龍。”,"After the two of them sang, they held their hands and laughed. Xuande said, ""Is Wolong here?"" So he dismounted and entered the store. Seeing the two drinking by the table: the one on the top has a white face and long beard, and the one on the bottom has a strange and ancient appearance. Xuande bowed his head and asked, ""Who is Mr. Wolong, Ergong?"" The long-bearded man said, ""Who is the man? Why do you want to find Wolong?"" Xuande said, ""Someone is Liu Bei. I want to visit Mr., and ask for peace and security for the world and the people. The long-bearded man said: ""I am not a Wolong, but I am also a friend of Wolong: I am Shi Guangyuan of Yingchuan, and this is Runan Menggongwei."" Xuande said happily, ""I have heard the name of Ergong for a long time, and I am fortunate to meet him. Today, there are accompanying horses here, and I dare to invite the two masters to go to Wolongzhuang to talk."" Guangyuan said: ""We are all lazy people in the mountains and wilds, and we don't care about the affairs of the country and the people, so we don't bother to ask. Please mount your horse and visit Wolong.""","Humbled, Xuande says, ‘Then just say to the master that Xuande came calling.’","The two men laughed loud and clapped their hands as the second singer ceased. Liu Bei thought full surely the longed for sage was there, so he dismounted and entered the inn. He saw the two merry-makers sitting opposite each other at a table. One was pale with a long beard; the other had a strikingly refined face. Liu Bei saluted them and said, “Which of you is Master Sleeping-Dragon?” “Who are you, Sir?” asked the long-bearded one. “What business have you with Sleeping-Dragon?” “I am Liu Bei. I want to inquire of him how to restore tranquillity to the world.” “Well, neither of us is your man, but we are friends of his. My name is Shi Guangyuan and my friend here is Meng Gongwei.” “I know you both by reputation,” said Liu Bei gladly. “I am indeed fortunate to meet you in this haphazard way. Will you not come to Sleeping-Dragon's retreat and talk for a time? I have horses here for you.” “We idle folks of the wilds know nothing of tranquilizing states. Please do not trouble to ask. Pray mount again and continue searching Sleeping-Dragon.”"

雲長引數騎東衝西突。正殺之間，劉玄德領三萬軍隨後到。前面哨馬探知，報與玄德云：“今番又是紅面長髯的斬了文醜。”玄德慌忙驟馬來看，隔河望見一簇人馬，往來如飛，旗上寫着“漢壽亭侯關雲長”七字。玄德暗謝天地曰：“原來吾弟果然在曹操處！”欲待招呼相見，被曹兵大隊擁來，只得收兵回去。袁紹接應官渡，下定寨柵。郭圖、審配入見袁紹，說：“今番又是關某殺了文醜，劉備佯推不知。”袁紹大怒，罵曰：“大耳賊！焉敢如此！”少頃，玄德至，紹令推出斬之。玄德曰：“某有何罪？”紹曰：“你故使汝弟又壞我一員大將，如何無罪？”玄德曰：“容伸一言而死：曹操素忌備，今知備在明公處，恐備助公，故特使雲長誅殺二將。公知必怒。此借公之手以殺劉備也：願明公思之。”袁紹曰：“玄德之言是也。汝等幾使我受害賢之名。”喝退左右，請玄德上帳而坐。玄德謝曰：“荷明公寬大之恩，無可補報，欲令一心腹人持密書去見雲長，使知劉備消息，彼必星夜來到，輔佐明公，共誅曹操，以報顏良、文醜之讎，若何？”袁紹大喜曰：“吾得雲長，勝顏良、文醜十倍也。”玄德修下書札，未有人送去。紹令退軍武陽，連營數十里，按兵不動。操乃使夏侯惇領兵守住官渡隘口，自己班師回許都，大宴衆官，賀雲長之功。因謂呂虔曰：“昔日吾以糧草在前者，乃餌敵之計也。惟荀公達知吾心耳。”衆皆歎服。正飲宴間，忽報汝南有黃巾劉辟、龔都，甚是猖獗。曹洪累戰不利，乞遣兵救之。雲長聞言，進曰：“關某願施犬馬之勞，破汝南賊寇。”操曰：“雲長建立大功，未曾重酬，豈可復勞征進？”公曰：“關某久閒，必生疾病。願再一行。”曹操壯之，點兵五萬，使于禁、樂進為副將，次日便行。荀彧密謂操曰：“雲長常有歸劉之心，倘知消息必去，不可頻令出征。”操曰：“今次收功，吾不復敎臨敵矣。”,"The cloud long argument rides east and west. During the slaughter, Liu Xuande led 30,000 troops and arrived later. The sentry in front of the horse found out, and reported to Xuan Deyun: ""This time it is the red-faced and long-bearded man who has beheaded Wen Chou again."" ""Han Shouting Hou Guan Yunchang"" seven characters. Xuande thanked heaven and earth secretly and said, ""It turns out that my brother is indeed at Cao Cao's place!"" Yuan Shao responded to Guandu and settled on the Zhaizhai. Guo Tu and Shenpei came to see Yuan Shao and said, ""This time it was Guan who killed Wen Chou again, and Liu Bei pretended not to know."" Yuan Shao was furious and scolded, ""Big-eared thief! How dare you do this!"" After a while, Xuande To, Shao Ling launched the cut. Xuande said, ""What's your crime?"" Shao said, ""Why did you make your brother destroy one of my generals, how can you be innocent?"" Xuande said, ""Rong Shen died with a single word: Cao Cao was never prepared to be prepared, but now I know how to be prepared. At Duke Ming, he was afraid that Bei Bei would help him, so the special envoy Yun Chang executed the two generals. The public knows that he will be angry. This is also to kill Liu Bei by borrowing the Duke's hand: I hope Duke Ming thinks about it."" Yuan Shao said, ""Xuande's words are true. How many times have you made me suffer the name of a sage?"" He retreated to the left and right, and asked Xuande to sit in the tent. Xuande Xie said: ""Duke Ming's generous kindness cannot be repaid. I want to send a confidant to meet Yunchang with a secret book and let him know the news of Liu Bei. He will come in the starry night to assist Duke Ming and jointly execute Cao Cao in return. Yan Liang and Wen Chou, what are they?"" Yuan Shao was overjoyed and said, ""I am ten times better than Yan Liang and Wen Chou."" Shaoling retreated to Wuyang, and the company remained in the camp for several dozen li without moving. Cao Nai ordered Xiahou Dun to lead the troops to guard the Guandu Pass, and then returned to Xudu with his own class, feasting all the officials, and congratulating Yunchang's achievements. Because of this, Lu Qian said: ""In the past, I used food and grass in the former, which was a trick to bait the enemy. Only Duke Xun knew my heart and ears."" Everyone was amazed. During the banquet, it was suddenly reported that there were yellow turbans Liu Pi and Gong Du in Runan, and it was very rampant. Cao Hong was tired of fighting and begged to send troops to save him. When Yunchang heard the words, Jin said: ""Guan is willing to do the labor of dogs and horses to break the thieves in Runan."" Cao said: ""Yunchang has made great achievements, but he has not been repaid, how can he return to labor and conquer?"" The public said: ""Guan has been for a long time. If you are idle, you will be sick. I would like to go again."" Cao Cao strengthened him, ordered 50,000 troops, and made Yu Jin and Le Jin as lieutenants, and he would leave the next day. Xun Yumi said to Cao: ""Yunchang always has the intention of returning to Liu. If he knows the news, he will go, and he must not be ordered to go on expeditions frequently."" Cao said: ""This time I have received my merits, and I will no longer be sent to face the enemy.""","On the edge of the battle Xuande is told that a red-faced, long-bearded warrior has killed Wen Chou. Riding forward, he sees the banner of Guan Yu. Thanking Heaven and Earth for the survival of his brother, he tries to reach him but is swept back by Cao Cao’s army. In the aftermath of the battle, Yuan Shao is once again and very understandably furious that Guan Yu has slain his commander in chief. Yuan Shao again seizes Xuande in order to execute him. But Xuande points out that this is exactly why Cao Cao used Guan Yu to kill the commanders. He is trying to sow discord between Xuande and Yuan Shao. Once again Yuan Shao changes his mind and invites Xuande to dine with him as an honoured guest. Meanwhile, during the celebrations of this victory, Cao Cao is informed of a new Yellow Headband army ravaging Runan. Guan Yu offers to lead the attack on the rebels and is given permission and troops to do so.","And the carts with supplies and all the horses were quickly recovered. Now Guan Yu, at the head of a few horsemen, was thrusting here and striking there at the moment when Liu Bei, with the thirty thousand reserve troops, appeared on the battle field on the other bank of the river. At once they told him that the red-faced, long-bearded warrior was there and had slain Wen Chou. Liu Bei hastily pressed forward to try to get a look at the warrior. He saw across the river a body of horse and the banners bore the words “Guan Yu, Lord of Hanshou”. “Then it is my brother, and he is really with Cao Cao,” said Liu Bei, secretly thanking God that Guan Yu was safe. Liu Bei made an attempt to wait about till he could call to Guan Yu, but a great mass of Cao Cao's soldiers came rushing down, and he was forced to retire. Yuan Shao, bringing reinforcements, reached Guandu and built a stockade. Two advisers, Guo Tu and Shen Pei, went in to see him and said, “Again that fellow Guan Yu has been in the battle; he killed Wen Chou. Liu Bei pretends ignorance of him.” Their master was angry and railed at Liu Bei, “The long-cared rebel! How dare he do such a thing?” Soon Liu Bei appeared; again Yuan Shao ordered him out to instant execution. “What crime have I committed?” asked Liu Bei. “You sent your brother to slay one of my generals. Is that no crime?” “Pray let me explain before I die. Cao Cao hated me and has always done so. Now he has found out where I am and, fearing that I may help you, has got my brother to destroy your two generals, feeling sure that when you heard of it, you would be angry and put me to death. You cannot fail to see this.” “What he says is sense,” said Yuan Shao, turning to his advisers, “and you two nearly brought on me the reproach of injuring the good.” Yuan Shao ordered his attendants to retire and asked Liu Bei to come and sit by him. Liu Bei came, saying, “I am deeply thankful, Illustrious Sir, for your great kindness, for which I can never be sufficiently grateful. Now I desire to send some confidential messenger with a secret letter to my brother to tell him where I am, and I am sure he will come without a moment's delay. He will help you to destroy Cao Cao to make up for having destroyed your two officers. Do you approve of this?” “If I got Guan Yu, he would be ten times better than the Yan Liang and Wen Chou that I have lost,” replied Yuan Shao. So Liu Bei prepared a letter. But there was no one to take it. Yuan Shao ordered the army to withdraw to Wuyang, where they made a large camp. For some time nothing was done. Then Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun to defend the strategic points at Guandu while he led the bulk of the army back to the capital. There he gave many banquets in honor of the services of Guan Yu, and then he told Lu Qian that putting the supplies in the front of the army had been meant as a bait to draw the enemy to destruction. “Only Xun You understood that,” said Cao Cao in conclusion. Every one present praised his ingenuity. Even while the banquet was proceeding, there arrived news of a rising of Yellow Scarves rebels at Runan led by Liu Pi and Gong Du. They were very strong, and Cao Hong had been defeated in several engagements. Now he begged for help. Guan Yu hearing this said, “I should like to have the opportunity of performing some service by destroying these rebels.” “You have already rendered noble services for which you have not been properly requited. I could hardly trouble you again,” said Cao Cao. “I have been idle too long; I shall get ill,” said Guan Yu. Cao Cao then let him to go and gave him fifty thousand troops with Yu Jin and Yue Jin as generals under him. They were to leave soon. Then Xun Yu said privily to his master, “He always cherishes the idea of returning to Liu Bei. He will leave you if he hears any news. Do not let him go on this expedition.” “If he does well this time, I will not let him go into battle again,” said Cao Cao."
關公於馬上自歎曰：“吾非欲沿途殺人，奈事不得已也。曹公知之，必以我為負恩之人矣。”正行間，忽見一騎自北而來，大叫：“雲長少住！”關公勒馬視之，乃孫乾也。關公曰：“自汝南相別，一向消息若何？”乾曰：“劉辟、龔都，自將軍回兵之後，復奪了汝南；遣某往河北結好袁紹，請玄德同謀破曹之計。不想河北將士，各相妒忌。田豐尚囚獄中；沮授黜退不用；審配、郭圖各自爭權；袁紹多疑，主持不定。某與劉皇叔商議，先求脫身之計。今皇叔已往汝南會合劉辟去了。恐將軍不知，反到袁紹處，或為所害，特遣某於路迎接將來。幸於此得見。將軍可速往汝南與皇叔相會。”關公敎孫乾拜見夫人。夫人問其動靜。孫乾備說：“袁紹二次欲斬皇叔，今幸脫身往汝南去了。夫人可與皇叔到此相會。”二夫人皆掩面垂淚。關公依言，不投河北去，逕取汝南來。正行之間，背後塵埃起處，一彪人馬趕來。當先夏侯惇大叫：“關某休走！”正是：,"Guan Gongyu immediately sighed to himself and said, ""I don't want to kill people along the way, but I have no choice but to do it. Cao Gong knows this, and he will definitely take me as a person who has lost his kindness."" The elder and the younger live!"" Guan Gong stopped his horse and looked at him, and it was Sun Qian. Guan Gong said: ""Since we parted from Runan, what has been the news?"" Gan said, ""Liu Pi and Gongdu have recaptured Runan since the generals returned to the army; they sent someone to Hebei to befriend Yuan Shao, and asked Xuande to conspire to destroy it. Cao Zhi's plan. I don't want Hebei soldiers, and they are jealous of each other. Tian Feng is still in prison; Ju Shu is not required to retire; Shen Pei and Guo Tu are fighting for power; The uncle has gone to Runan to meet Liu Pi. I am afraid that the general will not know, and he will go to Yuan Shao, or he will be harmed. ."" Guan Gong instructed Sun Qian to meet his wife. The lady asked him how he was doing. Sun Qianbei said: ""Yuan Shao wanted to behead the uncle the second time, but now he is fortunate to escape and go to Runan. The madam can meet the uncle here."" The two ladies covered their faces and wept. Guan Gong obeyed his words, and instead of going to Hebei, he went straight to Runan. In the middle of the line, the dust started to rise behind, and a group of people came. When Xiahou Dun shouted: ""Guan Mouxiu go away!"" It was exactly:","Guan Yu has forced his way through five places and killed six officials. He truly regrets that this has been necessary and realizes that Cao Cao will inevitably feel betrayed by his actions. Just at that moment a lone horseman rides towards him from the north. It is Sun Qian come to warn him not to go on to the court of Yuan Shao. Sun Qian has grown frustrated by the indecision of Yuan Shao. He has persuaded Xuande to move out and go and join Liu Pi in Runan. Realizing the danger Guan Yu would be in if he had ridden to Yuan Shao, Liu Pi has sent Sun Qian to warn him. So Guan Yu and the two ladies set out for Runan, but they have barely started when thundering up behind them comes a troop of horsemen led by Xiahou Dun. ‘Stop!’ he shouts. Can Guan Yu escape?","opened every gate. His loyalty and truth forth stand, a pattern unto all, His valor would frighten rushing streams and make high mountains fall. Alone he traveled lustily, this was death to meet his blade, He has been themed by myriads, his glory never will fade. “I did not willingly slay a single one of them,” mused Guan Yu as he rode along. “There was no help for it. Nevertheless when Cao Cao hears of it, he will regard me as ungrateful for his bounty.” Before long he saw a rider on the road who soon hailed him and proved to be Sun Qian. “I have never heard a word from you since we lost sight of each other at Runan; how have you fared?” said Guan Yu. “After your departure Liu Pi and Gong Du retook the city. I was sent by them to Yuan Shao to try to make peace with him and succeeded, so that Yuan Shao invited Liu Bei to go to him and share in the deliberations for a concerted attack on Cao Cao. But to my disgust the leaders of Yuan Shao's army showed great jealousy of each other so that Tian Feng got into gaol, Ju Shou was degraded, and others quarreled. Then Yuan Shao vacillated and hesitated, so that your brother and I consulted how we might get away from them all. Now the Uncle is at Runan with Liu Pi and, thinking you could not know that and might suffer some harm if you unwillingly went to Yuan Shao, I have come to warn you. It is good fortune to find you like this. Now we can hasten to Runan, and you will meet your brother.” Guan Yu took Sun Qian to make his bow to the ladies, who asked after his adventures, and Sun Qian said, “Uncle Liu Bei were nearly executed due to Yuan Shao's sudden bursts of anger after the deaths of Yan Liang and Wen Chou. Now, however, he is out of his way and safe at Runan, and you will meet him soon.” The ladies covered their faces and wept at the recital of his dangers. Then the party no longer traveled north but took the road toward Runan. Not long after a great cloud of dust was noticed behind them, and that presently made out a hundred of horsemen. These were led by Xiahou Dun, who shouted out to Guan Yu to stop. One by one the pass commanders stopped his"
是夜滿寵扮作小卒，混入彼軍隊中，偷至徐晃帳前，只見晃秉燭被甲而坐。寵突至其前，揖曰：“故人別來無恙乎！”徐晃驚起，熟視之曰：“子非山陽滿伯寧耶！何以至此？”寵曰：“某現為曹將軍從事。今日於陣前得見故人，欲進一言，故特冒死而來。”晃乃延之坐，問其來意。寵曰：“公之勇略，世所罕有，奈何屈身於楊、韓之徒？曹將軍當世英雄，其好賢禮士，天下所知也；今日陣前，見公之勇，十分敬愛，故不忍以健將決死戰，特遣寵來奉邀。公何不棄暗投明，共成大業？”晃沈吟良久，乃喟然歎曰：“吾固知奉、暹非立業之人，奈從之久矣，不忍相捨。”寵曰：“豈不聞‘良禽擇木而棲，賢臣擇主而事’。遇可事之主，而交臂失之，非丈夫也。”晃起謝曰：“愿從公言。”寵曰：“何不就殺奉、暹而去，以為進見之禮？”晃曰：“以臣弒主，大不義也，吾決不為。”寵曰：“公眞義士也！”晃遂引帳下數十騎，連夜同滿寵來投曹操。早有人報知楊奉。奉大怒，自引千騎來追，大叫：“徐晃反賊休走！”正追趕間，忽然一聲礮響，山上山下，火把齊明，伏軍四出。曹操親自引軍當先，大喝：“我在此等候多時，休敎走脫！”楊奉大驚，急待回軍，早被曹兵圍住。恰好韓暹引兵來救，兩軍混戰，楊奉走脫。曹操趁彼軍亂，乘勢攻擊，兩家軍士大半多降。楊奉、韓暹勢孤，引敗兵投袁術去了。,"It was Ye Manchong who pretended to be a pawn, sneaked into his army, and sneaked to Xu Huang's tent, only to see Huang Bingzhu sitting in the quilt. Chong suddenly came in front of him, and said, ""The old man is safe!"" Xu Huang was startled, and he looked at him and said, ""Zifei, Shanyang, Manboning! Why is this?"" Chong said, ""Someone is currently working for General Cao. I saw my old friend in front of the battle today, and I wanted to say a word, so I came here at the risk of death."" Huang Naiyan sat down and asked his intention. Chong said: ""The bravery of the public is rare in the world, how can I succumb to the disciples of Yang and Han? General Cao was a hero in the world, and he was a virtuous and ceremonial scholar, and the world knows it. Before the battle today, I saw the bravery of the public, and I respected and loved it very much. Therefore, I can't bear to fight to the death with a strong general, and I specially sent my pet to be invited. Why don't you abandon the dark and join the light, and achieve a great cause together?"" Huang pondered for a long time, then sighed: ""I know that Siam is not a person who has established a career, and it has been a long time. I can't bear to part with each other."" Chong said: ""Don't you hear that 'good birds choose wood to live in, and worthy ministers choose masters to work'. When you meet a good master, and you lose your arms, it's not a husband."" Huang Qixie He said, ""I would like to obey the public statement."" Chong said, ""Why don't you just kill Feng and Siam and leave as a courtesy to enter and see?"" Huang said, ""It is very unjust to kill the master with a minister, and I will never do it."" Chong said: ""A true righteous man!"" Huang Sui led dozens of cavalry under his tent, and he and Man Chong came to Cao Cao overnight. Someone had already reported to Yang Feng. Feng was furious, he led a thousand cavalry to chase, and shouted: ""Xu Huang, the rebels, leave!"" As he was chasing, there was a sudden sound, and the torches were all out on the mountain. Cao Cao personally led the army and shouted, ""I've been waiting here for a long time, please let me go!"" Yang Feng was shocked, and was anxious to return to the army, but he was surrounded by Cao's soldiers. It happened that Han Xian brought troops to the rescue, the two armies fought meleely, and Yang Feng escaped. Cao Cao took advantage of the chaos in his army to attack, and most of the soldiers from the two groups surrendered. Yang Feng and Han Xian were lonely and led the defeated army to Yuan Shu.","However, Cao Cao manages to bring Xu Huang to his side. His envoy quietly points out that a hero like Xu Huang deserves to serve another hero, not a good-for-nothing like Yang Feng. ‘You know the proverb,’ the envoy says. ‘The wise bird chooses its own branch; the thoughtful servant chooses his master.’ Xu Huang finds himself agreeing and decides to come over to Cao Cao’s side. But when the envoy suggests that Xu might kill Yang Feng and bring his head as a goodwill offering, Xu refuses, earning the admiration of the envoy. When Yang Feng discoveres that his champion has gone, he retreats and takes refuge with Yuan Shu.","That night Man Chong, duly disguised, got over to the other side and made his way to the tent of Xu Huang, who sat there by the light of a candle. Xu Huang was still wearing his coat of mail. Suddenly Man Chong ran out in front and saluted, saying, “You have been well since we parted, old friend?” Xu Huang jumped up in surprise, gazed into the face of the speaker a long time and presently said, “What! You are Man Chong of Shanyang? What are you doing here?” “I am an officer in General Cao Cao's army. Seeing my old friend out in front of the army today, I wanted to say a word to him. So I took the risk of stealing in this evening and here I am.” Xu Huang invited Man Chong in and they sat down. Then said Man Chong, “There are very few as bold as you on the earth; why then do you serve such as your present chiefs, Yang Feng and Han Xian? My master is the most prominent man in the world—a man who delights in wise people and appreciates soldiers as every one knows. Your valor today won his entire admiration, and so he took care that the attack was not vigorous enough to sacrifice you. Now he has sent me to invite you to join him. Will you not leave darkness for light and help him in his magnificent task?” Xu Huang sat a long time pondering over the offer. Then he said, with a sigh, “I know my masters are doomed to failure, but I have followed their fortunes a long time and do not like to leave them.” “But you know the prudent bird selects its tree, and the wise servant chooses his master. When one meets a worthy master and lets him go, one is very reckless.” “I am willing to do what you say,” said Xu Huang, rising. “Why not put these two to death as an introductory gift?” said Man Chong. “It is very wrong for a servant to slay his master. I will not do that.” “True; you are really a good man.” Then Xu Huang, taking only a few horsemen of his own men with him, left that night and deserted to Cao Cao. Soon some one took the news to Yang Feng, who at the head of a thousand strong horsemen, set out to capture the deserter. As they drew close, Yang Feng called out, “Betrayer! Stop there!” But Yang Feng fell into an ambush. Suddenly the whole mountain side was lit up with torches and out sprang Cao Cao's troops, he himself being in command. “I have been waiting here a long time; do not run away,” cried Cao Cao. Yang Feng was completely surprised and tried to draw off, but was quickly surrounded. Then Han Xian came to his rescue, and a confused battle began. Yang Feng succeeded in escaping, while Cao Cao kept up the attack on the two disordered armies. A great number of the rebels gave in, and the leaders found they had too few men left to maintain their independence, so they betook themselves to Yuan Shu."

縱馬加鞭，走至五更，回望火光漸遠，操心方定，問曰：“此是何處？”左右曰：“此是烏林之西，宜都之北。”操見樹林叢雜，山川險峻，乃於馬上仰面大笑不止。諸將問曰：“丞相何故大笑？”操曰：“吾不笑別人，單笑周瑜無謀，諸葛亮少智。若是吾用兵之時，預先在這裏伏下一軍，如之奈何？”說猶未了，兩邊鼓聲震響，火光竟天而起，驚得曹操幾乎墜馬。刺斜裏一彪軍殺出，大叫：“我趙子龍奉軍師將令，在此等候多時了！”操敎徐晃、張郃雙敵趙雲，自己冒煙突火而去。子龍不來追趕，只顧搶奪旗幟。曹操得脫。,"He rode his horse and whipped, and walked to the fifth watch. Looking back at the firelight, he was worried, and asked, ""Where is this?"" Left and right, he said, ""This is the west of Wulin and the north of Yidu."" Cao saw the woods Cong miscellaneous, the mountains and rivers are steep, and he immediately laughed on his back. The generals asked, ""Why is the prime minister laughing so loudly?"" Cao said, ""I don't laugh at others, but I only laugh at Zhou Yu's lack of strategy and Zhuge Liang's lack of wisdom. If I were to use an army, I would have to subdue an army here in advance, what would I do?"" Before it was over, the drums on both sides rang out, and the flames rose from the sky, so shocked that Cao Cao almost fell off his horse. A Biao army rushed out in Tashixili, shouting: ""I, Zhao Zilong, have been ordered by the military commander and have been waiting here for a long time!"" Zilong didn't come to chase, but just snatch the flag. Cao Cao got off.","It is around the fifth watch that Cao Cao stops and asks where they are. The reply is west of the forest and north of Yidu. To everyone’s astonishment Cao Cao roars with laughter, and when his men ask him why he says, ‘I’m laughing at Zhou Yu and Kong Ming, who simply aren’t that bright! This is where they should have set an ambush, as I would, because there’s no way of escape from here.’ No sooner does he say this than war drums thunder out and flames roar up around them. Out of the smoke and chaos comes the voice of the enemy commander. ‘I am Zhao Zilong, sent to await you by order, and I’ve had to wait a long time for you!’ Xu Huang and Zhang He charge forward to battle with Zhao Zilong, and Cao Cao makes good his escape again in the mêlée.","At the fifth watch he was a long way from the glare and he felt safer. He asked, “What is this place?” They told him, “It is west of the Black Forest and north of Yidu.” Seeing the thickly crowded trees all about him, and the steep hills and narrow passes, Cao Cao threw up his head and laughed. Those about him asked, “Why are you, Sir, so merry?” And he said, “I am only laughing at the stupidity of Zhou Yu and the ignorance of Zhuge Liang. If they have only set an ambush there, as I would have done, why, there is no escape.” Cao Cao had scarcely finished his explanation when from both sides came a deafening roll of drums and flames sprang up to heaven. Cao Cao nearly fell off his horse—he was so startled. And from the side dashed in a troop, with Zhao Yun leading, who cried, “I am Zhao Yun, and long have I been waiting here!” Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang and Zhang He to engage this new opponent, and he himself rode off into the smoke and fire. Zhao Yun did not pursue; he only captured the banners, and Cao Cao escaped."

Kong Ming joined the boat and sat opposite. Su said, ""I've been doing military affairs for several days, but I'm not listening."" Kong Ming said, ""Even if Liang did not congratulate the governor."" Su said, ""Why are you happy?"" Kong Ming said, ""Mr. Gong Jin sent him to investigate Liang, but he didn't know it. It is this matter that can be congratulated.” Lu Su turned pale and asked, “How did you know about it, sir?” Kong Ming said: “This plan has to be done by Jiang. I don’t want to admit I’m wrong. Today Cai and Zhang are dead, Jiangdong is safe, how can we not congratulate! I heard that Cao Cao changed Mao Jie and Yu Jin was the commander of the navy army, so these two hands have killed the navy army.” Lu Su After listening, he couldn't speak, he faltered for a while, and returned without Confucius. Kong Ming instructed: ""Wang Zijing should not talk about the prophet's matter in front of Gongjin. I'm afraid that Gongjin will be jealous and will seek to harm Liang."" Lu Su agreed and went back to see Zhou Yu, and he had to tell the truth. Yu was shocked and said: ""This person must not be kept! I am determined to kill him!"" Su Quan said, ""If you kill Kongming, you will be laughed at by Cao Cao."" Yu said, ""I have justice to kill him, and I will teach him to die without any chance of death. Resentment."" Su said, ""How can I kill him in a fair way?"" Yu said, ""Zi Jingxiu asks, I will see you in the future.""","It is very clear to Lu Su that Kong Ming knows perfectly well what kind of trick Zhou Yu has pulled on Cao Cao. When, despite Kong Ming asking him not to tell Zhou Yu that he knows, Lu Su blurts this out to Zhou Yu, once again Zhou is determined to destroy Kong Ming. So it is that, the very next day, Zhou Yu summons all his commanders and asks Kong Ming to join them. ‘Obviously,’ says Zhou Yu, ‘we will need to fight Cao Cao on the Great River with bows and arrows, yet we haven’t enough arrows to be able to do this.’ And turning to Kong Ming, Zhou Yu says, ‘I wonder if you would be so kind as to provide them for us?","Lu Su departed on his mission and found Zhuge Liang seated in his little craft. “There has been so much to do that I have not been able to come to listen to your instructions,” said Lu Su. “That is truly so,” said Zhuge Liang, “and I have not yet congratulated the Commander-in-Chief.” “What have you wished to congratulate him upon?” “Why Sir, the matter upon which he sent you to find out whether I knew about it or not. Indeed I can congratulate him on that.” Lu Su turned pale and gasped, saying, “But how did you know, Master?” “The ruse succeeded well thus played off on Jiang Gan. Cao Cao has been taken in this once, but he will soon rise to it. Only he will not confess his mistake. However, the two men are gone, and your country is freed from a grave anxiety. Do you not think that is a matter for congratulation? I hear Mao Jie and Yu Jin are the new admirals, and in their hands lie both good and evil for the fate of the northern fleet.” Lu Su was quite dumbfounded; he stayed a little time longer passing the time in making empty remarks, and then took his leave. As he was going away, Zhuge Liang cautioned him, saying, “Do not let Zhou Yu know that I know his ruse. If you let him know, he will seek some chance to do me harm.” Lu Su promised; nevertheless he went straight to his chief and related the whole thing just as it happened. “Really he must be got rid of;” said Zhou Yu, “I have quite decided to put the man out of the way.” “If you slay him, will not Cao Cao laugh at you?” “Oh, no; I will find a legitimate way of getting rid of him so that he shall go to his death without resentment.” “But how can you find a legitimate way of assassinating him?” “Do not ask too much; you will see presently.”"

The answer was: ""Huang Zu and Mi Heng drank together, and they were both drunk. Zu asked Heng and said, 'Who is your character in Xudu?' Heng said: 'The elder Kong Wenju, the younger Yang Dezu: apart from these two, there is no one else.' Ancestor said: 'How do you look like me?' Heng said: 'You are like a god in a temple. Although you are worshipped, your hatred has no effect!' Ancestor said angrily: 'You take me as a puppet man!' So he cut him off. He was scolded until he died."" Liu Biao heard Heng's death, and he was so angry that he ordered him to be buried on the edge of Parrot Island. A later poem sighed and said:","Soon news comes of Mi Heng’s fate. Huang Zu and Mi Heng get drunk together, and then Huang Zu makes the mistake of asking Mi Heng what he thinks of him. He is told he is a wooden statue in a temple, pretty but useless. Furious and with no fear of Cao Cao, Huang Zu has him killed then and there.","Presently came the news that Mi Heng had been put to death by Huang Zu on account of a quarrel begun over the wine cups. Both being worse for liquor they had begun to discuss the worth of people. “You were in Xuchang,” said Huang Zu. “Who was there of worth?” “The big boy was Kong Rong and the little one Yang Xiu. There was no one else to count.” “What am I like?” said Huang Zu. “You are like a god in a temple; you sit still and receive sacrifice, but the lack of intelligence is pitiful.” “Do you regard me as a mere image?” cried Huang Zu, angrily. So Huang Zu put the impudent speaker to death. Even at the very point of death, Mi Heng never ceased his railing and abuse. “Alas!” sighed Liu Biao when he heard Mi Heng's fate. Then Liu Biao had the victim honorably interred near Yingwu, on Parrot Island. And a later poet wrote of Mi Heng:"

The wind blows the flag, it is Cao Jun. Zhang Fei was furious and said, ""Do you still dare to hold back now?"" Tightening up the snake spear and stroking the future. Guan Gong hurriedly stopped him and said, ""Sir, stay here, you can see me beheading this general to show my sincerity."" Fei said, ""If you have a sincere heart, I will let you kill the coming general after I stop drumming here. !"" Guan Gong promised. In a few moments, Cao's army will arrive. The leader of the general was Cai Yang, who raised his sword and shouted: ""You killed my nephew Qin Qi, but you escaped here! I have been ordered by the Prime Minister to come to get you!"" then cut. Zhang Fei beat the drums himself. I saw that the drum hadn't finished yet, when Guan Gong's knife started, Cai Yang's head had already landed. All the soldiers left. Guan Gong captured the pawn who held the flag and came over and asked why he took it. The young soldier reported: ""General Cai Yang was very angry when he heard that he killed his nephew. He wanted to come to Hebei to fight the general. The prime minister refused, so he sent him to Runan to attack Liu Pi. He didn't want to meet the general here."" Before going to Zhang Fei, tell him about it. The flying general Guan Gong asked the pawn in detail about the current affairs in Xudu; the pawn said it from the beginning to the end, and Fei Fang believed it.","And he points behind Guan Yu. Guan Yu turns and to his astonishment sees a huge cloud of dust kicked up by what has to be an immense military force. The banners flying high above the horde declare that this is the army of Cao Cao. ‘So,’ says Zhang Fei, ‘are there any other tricks of yours to try to persuade me?’ And so saying he charges at Guan Yu. ‘Stop, brother!’ shouts Guan Yu. ‘To prove to you I’m telling the truth let me go and kill the leader of the troops.’ ‘If you can do this in the time it takes for three rolls of the war drums, then I’ll believe you,’ replies Zhang Fei. Soon the army’s leader comes into clear view, and it is none other than Cai Yang, who, the moment he sees Guan Yu, shouts, ‘Found you, you murderer. You killed my nephew. The prime minister has ordered your arrest.’ Zhang Fei picks up the drumsticks. Guan Yu utters not a word but charges forward. Before Zhang Fei can complete a single roll of the drums, Guan Yu’s mighty sword has risen and fallen, and Cai Yang’s head rolls to the ground. At this sight the troops panic and start to flee. When a junior officer is captured and questioned it is revealed that Cao Cao has not ordered the capture of Guan Yu, but an attack on Runan. The meeting with Guan Yu was an accident which Cai Yang tried to turn to his own advantage. Zhang Fei interrogates the prisoner thoroughly until at last he is convinced that his brother has told the truth.","Guan Yu turned, and there he saw a cloud of dust rising as though a squadron of horse was coming. And soon they were near enough, and from their trumpets and banners they showed themselves to be of Cao Cao's army. “Now will you try to cajole me further?” cried Zhang Fei in a rage. He set his octane-serpent halberd and was just coming on when Guan Yu said, “Brother, wait a while; see me slay the leader of these that I may prove myself no traitor.” “Well, if you are really true, prove it by slaying that leader, whoever he may be, before I have finished three rolls of the drum.” Zhang Fei's condition was accepted. Soon the attacking force was near enough to make out the leader to be Cai Yang. Sword in hand Cai Yang rode at full speed, crying, “ So I have found you, slayer of my nephew! I have a command to capture you and will execute it.” Guan Yu made no reply. Raising his sword ready to strike, he moved out and the drums began to beat. Before a roll could be completed the fight was over, and Cai Yang's head had rolled on the ground. His force scattered and fled. Guan Yu, however, captured the young ensign bearer and questioned him. The youth said, “The fact is the Prime Minister had not given an order. Incensed at the loss of his nephew, Cai Yang wished to cross the river to pursue and attack you, General, although the Prime Minister refused permission. To satisfy him, the Prime Minister had sent Cai Yang to attack Runan, and the meeting at this place is entirely an accident.” Guan Yu bade him repeat this story to his brother. Zhang Fei also questioned him concerning all that had happened in the capital, and the recital of the whole story satisfied Zhang Fei of the fidelity of Guan Yu."
且說袁紹自舊歲感冒吐血症候，今方稍愈，商議欲攻許都。審配諫曰：“舊歲官渡、倉亭之敗，軍心未振，尚當深溝高壘，以養軍民之力。”正議間，忽報曹操進兵官渡，來攻冀州。紹曰：“若候兵臨城下，將至壕邊，然後拒敵，事已遲矣。吾當自領大軍出迎。”袁尚曰：“父親病體未痊，不可遠征。兒願提兵前去迎敵。”紹許之，遂使人往靑州取袁譚，幽州取袁熙，并州取高幹：四路同破曹操。正是：,"Let's say that Yuan Shao has been suffering from a cold and vomiting since the old age, and now he is recovering a little, and he is discussing that he wants to attack Xudu. Shen Pei remonstrated: ""The defeat of Guandu and Cangting in the old age, the army's heart has not been revived, and it is still a deep trench and a high fortress to support the strength of the army and the people."" Shao said: ""If the soldiers are waiting to come to the city, they will come to the edge of the trench, and then resist the enemy, it will be too late. I should lead a large army and go out to meet them."" Yuan Shang said: ""My father has not recovered from his illness, so he cannot go on an expedition. My son would like to send troops to meet him. The enemy."" Shao Xuzhi, so he sent people to take Yuan Tan from Xizhou, Yuan Xi from Youzhou, and Gaogan from Bingzhou: all four ways to defeat Cao Cao. Exactly:","He has now recovered from his collapse after the last great battle and is in turn planning to advance on the capital. When news comes of Cao Cao’s own advance and threatened attack on Yuan Shao’s capital at Jizhou , Yuan Shao’s son Yuan Shang takes command of the army and rides out to confront Cao Cao. Who is going to win?","As to Yuan Shao, who had been suffering from blood-spitting but was now in better health, he began to think of measures against Xuchang, but Shen Pei dissuaded him, saying, “You are not yet recovered from the fatigues of last year. It would be better to make your position impregnable and set to improving the army.” When the news of Cao Cao's approach arrived, Yuan Shao said, “If we allow the foe to get close to the city before we march to the river, we shall have missed our opportunity; I must go out to repel this army.” Here his son Yuan Shang interposed, “Father, you are not sufficiently recovered for a campaign and should not go so far. Let me lead the army against this enemy.” Yuan Shao consented, and he sent to Qingzhou and Youzhou and Bingzhou to call upon his other two sons and his nephew to attack Cao Cao at the same time as his own army. Against Runan they beat the drum,"
且說荀彧探知袁紹欲興兵犯許都，星夜馳書報曹操。操得書心慌，卽日回兵。細作報知張繡，繡欲追之。賈詡曰：“不可追也，追之必敗。”劉表曰：“今日不追，坐失機會矣。”力勸繡引軍萬餘同往追之。約行十餘里，趕上曹軍後隊。曹軍奮力接戰，繡、表兩軍大敗而還。繡謂詡曰：“不用公言，果有此敗。”詡曰：“今可整兵再往追之。”繡與表俱曰：“今已敗，奈何復追？”詡曰：“今番追去，必獲大勝，如其不然，請斬吾首。”繡信之。劉表疑慮，不肯同往。繡乃自引一軍往追，操兵果然大敗，軍馬輜重，連路散棄而走。繡正往前追趕，忽山後一彪軍擁出。繡不敢前追，收軍回安衆。劉表問賈詡曰：“前以精兵追退兵，而公曰必敗；後以敗卒擊勝兵，而公曰必克：究竟悉如公言。何其事不同而皆驗也？願公明敎我。”詡曰：“此易知耳：將軍雖善用兵，非曹操敵手。操軍雖敗，必有勁將為後殿，以防追兵；我兵雖銳，不能敵之也：故知必敗。夫操之急於退兵者，必因許都有事；旣破我追軍之後，必輕車速回，不復為備；我乘其不備而更追之，故能勝也。”劉表、張繡俱服其高見。詡勸表回荊州，繡守襄城，以為脣齒。兩軍各散。,"Let’s say that Xun Yu found out that Yuan Shao wanted to launch an army to invade Xudu, and the starry night galloped to write to Cao Cao. Cao was so flustered that he returned to the army. I made a detailed report to know Zhang Embroidery, embroidery wanted to chase him. Jia Xu said, ""Don't chase him, you will lose if you chase him."" Liu Biao said, ""If you don't chase him today, you will miss the chance."" He urged Xiu to lead more than ten thousand troops to chase him. After about ten li, he caught up with Cao's army. Cao's army fought hard, and the embroidery and watch armies were defeated and returned. Embroidery said to Xu: ""You don't need to speak publicly, if you have this defeat."" Xu said: ""Now you can organize your troops and go after them."" Embroidery and the watch said: ""Now we have been defeated, how can we go after them again?"" Xu said: ""Now If you chase after him, you will definitely win a great victory, if not, please behead me."" Xiu Xinzhi. Liu Biao was concerned and refused to go with him. Embroidery led an army to chase after him, and the army was defeated, and the army and horses were overloaded and scattered away. Embroidery was chasing forward, and suddenly a Biao army rushed out from behind the mountain. Embroidered did not dare to chase forward, and withdrew the army and returned to Anzhong. Liu Biao asked Jia Xu: ""In the past, I used elite soldiers to chase the retreating soldiers, but the public said that they would be defeated. Later, I used defeated soldiers to defeat the victorious soldiers, and the public said that they must overcome them. Xu said: ""This is easy to know. Although the general is good at using troops, he is not an opponent of Cao Cao. Even if Cao's army is defeated, he will definitely have the strength to stand in the rear hall to prevent the pursuit of troops. Although our troops are sharp, we cannot fight against them: so I know that I will be defeated. Those who are in a hurry to retreat will surely have trouble because of Xu; after breaking my pursuit, they will return with a light vehicle, and they will no longer be prepared; I will take advantage of their unpreparedness and pursue them even more, so I can win.” Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu both obeyed him. See you. Xu persuaded Biao to return to Jingzhou and embroidered to defend Xiangcheng, thinking that he was lips and teeth. The two armies dispersed.","From then on there is a vicious game of cat and mouse as Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao track Cao Cao’s retreating army, attacking whenever they can. Progress is slow for the retreating army until word comes that Yuan Shao is planning to attack Cao Cao’s base at the capital. At this news Cao Cao rushes his army homewards. He is retreating but also advancing to the attack! Securing the capital and the emperor, Cao Cao is astonished to receive a letter from Yuan Shao suggesting that they work together and that he will go to fight Gongsun Zan. Cao Cao turns to his adviser Guo Jia and asks, ‘Can’t we teach him a lesson! Are we strong enough to defeat Yuan Shao?’ To this question Guo Jia replies: ‘Yuan Shao has ten faults while you have ten strengths, so the size of his army is not relevant.","But Xun Yu discovered through his spies that Yuan Shao was preparing an attack on Capital Xuchang, so he at once wrote to Cao Cao who, much disturbed by this news, set out homeward right away. When Zhang Xiu heard this through his scouts, he wished to follow the retreating army. Jia Xu opposed it and said, “It will lead to a defeat.” However, Liu Biao said, “It is wrong to lose such a chance.” And so finally pursuit was decided upon. They had not marched more than four miles before they came upon Cao Cao's rearguard, who fought with great vigor and bravery so that the pursuers were beaten off and went home discomfited. Zhang Xiu said to Jia Xu, “This defeat comes from my not following your advice.” “Now set your army in order and pursue,” said Jia Xu. “But we have just suffered defeat!” cried both leaders. “Do you now counsel pursuit?” “Yes, and the result will be a great victory if you go now. I will venture my head on that,” said Jia Xu. Zhang Xiu had confidence, but Liu Biao was afraid and would not accompany him. So one army only started in pursuit. However, this was enough. Cao Cao's rear-guard was thoroughly routed and abandoned their wagons and their baggage in their hasty flight. Zhang Xiu pursued, but suddenly a troop came out from the shelter of some hills and checked him. Fearful to try further, he hastened back to Anzhong. The other general, Liu Biao, asked the adviser to explain his apparent inconsistency, saying, “When our veteran and brave soldiers were going to pursue those who retreated, you said our men would lose the day; and when defeated men pursued the victors, you foretold victory. You were right in both cases, but we wish you would enlighten us.” “It is easy to explain. You, Generals, although skilled leaders, are not a match for our enemy. Though Cao Cao had lost a battle, he had able generals to keep the rear and guard against pursuit. Our soldiers are good, but not a match for them. That is how I knew. For as much as Cao Cao's hurried retreat was due to trouble in the capital, and he had beaten off our attack, I knew he would retire at his utmost speed and not take his usual precautions. I ventured to take advantage of his laxity.” Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu could not but affirm his complete understanding of the conditions. On the advice of Jia Xu then Liu Biao returned to Jingzhou, while Zhang Xiu took up his position at Xiangyang so that each strengthened the other as the lips protect the teeth from cold."
護軀銀鎧砌龍鱗，束髮金冠簪雉尾。,"The body is protected by silver armor with dragon scales, and the hair is tied with a golden crown and a pheasant tail.","They head for the pass, chased by Xuande and his brothers and their whole army.","He clothed his body in silver armor like the scales of a dragon, On his head was a golden headdress with pheasant tails,"
却說曹操守官渡，自八月起，至九月終，軍力漸乏，糧草不繼，意欲棄官渡退回許昌；遲疑未決，乃作書遣人赴許昌問荀彧。彧以書報之。書略曰：,"But he said that Cao Cao guarded Guandu. From August to the end of September, his army was gradually running out, food and forage were not available, and he wanted to abandon Guandu and return to Xuchang. Yu reported it with a book. The book says:","This is thwarted by Cao Cao’s men digging a deep moat around their camp and thus foiling the enemy plan. The confrontation goes on for month after month.11 The situation grows more and more desperate, and supplies of food begin to run out on both sides. One day, Cao Cao’s men capture a spy and find out from him that Yuan Shao is expecting a huge convoy of grain wagons within the next few days, led by Commander Han Meng.","Cao Cao held Guandu throughout the eighth and ninth months when, his army being worn out and provisions failing, he began to think of giving up and returning to the capital. As he could not make up his mind, he referred his difficulties by letter to Xun Yu, whom he had left to guard Xuchang. The reply he got was to this effect:"
却說曹操自倉亭大勝，重賞三軍，令人探察冀州虛實。細作回報：“紹臥病在牀。袁尚、審配緊守城池。袁譚、袁熙、高幹皆回本州。”衆皆勸操急攻之。操曰：“冀州糧食極廣，審配又有機謀，未可急拔。見今禾稼在田，恐廢民業，姑待秋成後取之未晚。”正議間，忽荀彧有書到，報說：“劉備在汝南得劉辟、龔都數萬之衆。聞丞相提軍出征河北，乃令劉辟守汝南，備親自引兵乘虛來攻許昌。丞相可速回軍禦之。”操大驚，留曹洪屯兵河上，虛張聲勢。操自提大兵往汝南來迎劉備。,"But he said that Cao Cao had won a great victory from Cangting, rewarded the three armies, and made people explore the reality of Jizhou. The detailed report: ""Shao is sick and in bed. Yuan Shang and Shen Pei are guarding the city. Yuan Tan, Yuan Xi, and Gao Gan all return to the state."" Everyone urged Cao to attack him urgently. Cao said: ""Jizhou has a very wide range of grains, and there is an organic plan for the trial and distribution. It is not urgent to pull out. Seeing that the crops are in the fields today, I am afraid that the people's industry will be ruined. I will wait for the autumn to harvest it before it is too late."" During the discussion, suddenly Xun Yu wrote When they arrived, the report said: ""Liu Bei has tens of thousands of Liu Pi and Gong Du in Runan. When the Prime Minister heard that he raised his army to go to Hebei, he ordered Liu Pi to guard Runan, and Bei personally led his troops to attack Xuchang. ."" Cao was shocked, and left Cao Hong to station troops on the river, bluffing. Cao Zi brought a large army to Runan to welcome Liu Bei.","As Yuan Shao falls back, ambush after ambush springs into action to confront him. Soon most of his army lie dead on the battlefield or have fled. In despair, Yuan Shao too races away, eventually escaping all the ambushes and pursuits only to collapse upon reaching safety. All he can do now is to send his few remaining commanders to defend the borders of his own land. Cao Cao rests after his victory, but his respite is short-lived. News reaches him that Xuande is advancing on the capital. He has no option but to head for Xuchang. Xuandu and Cao Cao come face to face at Rang mountain.","Meanwhile Cao Cao was distributing rewards to his army for the late victory, and his spies were scouting all about Jizhou. He soon learned that Yuan Shao was ill, and that the youngest son Yuan Shang and Shen Pei were in command of the city, while his brothers and cousin had returned each to his own. Cao Cao's advisers were in favor of a speedy attack. But he objected, saying, “Jizhou is large and well supplied; Shen Pei is an able strategist and it behooves me to be careful. I would rather wait till the autumn when the crops have been gathered in so that the people will not suffer.” While the attack was being talked over there came letters from Xun Yu: “Liu Bei was strengthening himself at Runan with the force of Liu Pi and Gong Du and, when he heard that you was attacking Jizhou, he said he would take the opportunity to march on the capital. Wherefore you, Sir, should hasten homeward to defend Xuchang.” This news disconcerted Cao Cao. He left Cao Hong in command on the river bank, with orders to maintain the appearance of strength there, while he led the main part of his army to meet the threatened attack from Runan."
甕城——在城門外保護城門的小城叫甕城。,Wengcheng - The small city that protects the city gate outside the city gate is called Wengcheng.,CHAPTER 22,"Just from grave danger extricated,"
次日出城，見玄德所乘之馬極駿，問之知是張武之馬，表稱讚不已。玄德遂將此馬送與劉表。表大喜，騎回城中。蒯越見而問之。表曰：“此玄德所送也。”越曰：“昔先兄蒯良，最善相馬；越亦頗曉。此馬眼下有淚槽，額邊生白點，名為的盧，騎則妨主。張武為此馬而亡。主公不可乘之。”表聽其言。次日請玄德飲宴，因言曰：“昨承惠良馬，深感厚意。但賢弟不時征進，可以用之。敬當送還。”玄德起謝。表又曰：“賢弟久居此間，恐廢武事。襄陽屬邑新野縣，頗有錢糧。弟可引本部軍馬於本縣屯紮，何如？”玄德領諾。次日，謝別劉表，引本部軍馬逕往新野。方出城門，只見一人在馬前長揖曰：“公所騎馬，不可乘也。”玄德視之，乃荊州幕賓伊籍，字機伯，山陽人也。玄德忙下馬問之。籍曰：“昨聞蒯異度對劉荊州云：‘此馬名的盧，乘則妨主。’因此還公。公豈可復乘之？”玄德曰：“深感先生見愛。但凡人死生有命，豈馬所能妨哉！”籍服其高見，自此常與玄德往來。,"The next day, when he came out of the city, he saw the extremely gallant horse that Xuande was riding, and he asked that it was Zhang Wu's horse, and he praised him. Xuande then sent the horse to Liu Biao. Overjoyed, he rode back to the city. Kuai Yue saw it and asked. The table said: ""This is the gift of Xuande."" Yue said: ""In the past, my elder brother Kuailiang was the most good at horses; Yue was also quite knowledgeable. This horse has tear troughs under its eyes and white spots on its forehead. Hurt the lord. Zhang Wu died for this horse. The lord cannot ride on it."" Biao listened to his words. The next day, he invited Xuande to a banquet, because he said, ""I am deeply grateful for the good horse I received yesterday. But my virtuous brother will march in from time to time, so I can use it. Respectfully, I should return it."" Xuande thanked him. The table also said: ""My wise brother has lived here for a long time, and I am afraid that the military affairs will be abandoned. Xiangyang belongs to Xinye County, and has quite a lot of money and food. The younger brother can lead the army and horses of the headquarters to settle in this county, how about it?"" Xuande led the promise. The next day, thanking Liu Biao, he led the army and horses of the headquarters to Xinye. When he came out of the city gate, he saw a person standing in front of the horse, saying, ""You cannot ride a horse at the public office."" Xuande hurriedly dismounted and asked. Ji said: ""Yesterday I heard Kuai Yidu said to Liu Jingzhou: 'This horse's name is Lu, if you ride it, it will hinder the master.' Therefore, it will be returned to the Duke. How can the Duke ride it again?"" Xuande said: ""I deeply feel the love of Mr. Life and death have fate, how can a horse be able to hinder it!"" Ji obeyed his lofty views, and since then he has often communicated with Xuande.","Xuande, his two brothers and Zhao Zilong join up with the forces of Liu Biao at Jingzhou, and there they help him quash a local rebellion. The three brothers even offer to help defeat invaders from further south such as the Viets and to ward off attacks from Zhang Lu in the west and from Sun Quan. However, Lady Cai’s brother Cai Mao in particular resents Xuande’s rising status and power. Going to his sister, Liu Biao’s wife, Lady Cai, he persuades her to whisper rumours about the loyalty of Xuande and his friends into the ear of her husband. As a result of these doubts, Liu Biao decides to remove Xuande and his men from the city. Instead he offers Xuande command of the city and region around Xinye. Xuande agrees to go to defend the city of Xinye, and it is here that his son Liu Shan is born to his wife, Lady Gan, in the spring of AD 207.","Soon after he went out of the city to see Liu Bei and noticed he was riding a very handsome horse. They told him it was a prize taken from the recently conquered rebels; and as he praised it very warmly, Liu Bei presented it to him. Liu Biao was delighted and rode it back to the city. Kuai Yue saw it and asked where it had come from. The Imperial Protector told him it was a gift from Liu Bei. Kuai Yue said, “My passed-away brother, Kuai Liang, knew horses very well, and I am not a bad judge. This horse has tear-tracks running down from its eyes and a white blaze on its forehead. It is called a Dilu horse, and it is a danger to his master. That is why Zhang Wu was killed. I advise you not to ride it.” Liu Biao began to think. Soon after he asked Liu Bei to a banquet and in the course of it said, “You kindly presented me with a horse lately, and I am most grateful; but you may need it on some of your expeditions and, if you do not mind, I would like to return it.” Liu Bei rose and thanked him. The Imperial Protector continued, “You have been here a long time, and I fear I am spoiling your career as a warrior. Now Xinye in Xiangyang is no poverty-stricken town; how would you like to garrison it with your own troops?” Liu Bei naturally took the offer as a command and set out as soon as he could, taking leave of the Imperial Protector the next day. And so he took up his quarters in Xinye. When he left Jingzhou City, he noticed in the gate a person making him emphatic salutations, and the man presently said, “You should not ride that horse.” Liu Bei looked at the man and recognized in the speaker one of the secretaries of Liu Biao named Yi Ji, a native of Shanyang. So he hastily dismounted and asked why. Yi Ji replied, “Yesterday I heard that Kuai Yue told the Imperial Protector that that horse was a Dilu horse and brought disaster to its owner. That is why it was returned to you. How can you mount it again?” “I am deeply touched by your affection,” replied Liu Bei, “but a person's life is governed by fate and what a horse can interfere with that?” Yi Ji admitted his superior view, and thereafter he kept in touch with Liu Bei wherever he went."
雲出寨迎接，待以賓禮，置酒共飲，納了印綬。酒至數巡，範曰：“將軍姓趙，某亦姓趙：五百年前，合是一家。將軍乃眞定人，某亦眞定人：又是同鄕。倘得不棄，結為兄弟，實為萬幸。”雲大喜，各敍年庚。雲與範同年。雲長範四個月，範遂拜雲為兄。二人同鄕，同年，又同姓，十分相得。至晚席散，範辭回城。次日，範請雲入城安民。雲敎軍士休動，只帶五十騎隨入城中。居民執香伏道而接。雲安民已畢，趙範邀請入衙飲宴。酒至半酣，範復邀雲入後堂深處，洗盞更酌。雲飲微醉，範忽請出一婦人，與雲把酒。子龍見婦人身穿縞素，有傾國傾城之色，乃問範曰：“此何人也？”範曰：“家嫂樊氏也。”子龍改容敬之。樊氏把盞畢，範令就坐。雲辭謝。樊氏辭歸後堂。雲曰：“賢弟何必煩令嫂舉盃耶？”範笑曰：“中間有個緣故，乞兄勿阻：先兄棄世已三載，家嫂寡居，終非了局，弟常勸其改嫁。嫂曰：‘若得三件事兼全之人，我方嫁之：第一要文武雙全，名聞天下；第二要相貌堂堂，威儀出衆；第三要與家兄同姓。’你道天下那得有這般湊巧的？今尊兄堂堂儀表，名震四海，又與家兄同姓，正合家嫂所言。若不嫌家嫂貌陋，願陪嫁資，與將軍為妻，結累世之親，何如？”雲聞言大怒而起，厲聲曰：“吾旣與汝結為兄弟，汝嫂卽吾嫂也，豈可作此亂人倫之事乎！”趙範羞慚滿面，答曰：“我好意相待，如何這般無禮！”遂目視左右，有相害之意。雲已覺，一拳打倒趙範，逕出府門，上馬出城去了。,"Yun came out of the village to greet him, waited for a courtesy, set up wine and drank together, and accepted the seal. After drinking for a few tours, Fan said: ""The general's surname is Zhao, and a certain surname is also Zhao: five hundred years ago, they were one family. As a brother, it is really fortunate."" Yun was overjoyed, and each said Nian Geng. Yun and Fan are the same year. Yun Changfan for four months, Fan Sui worshipped Yun as his brother. The two share the same name, the same year, and the same surname. They are very compatible. When the evening banquet was over, Fan Ci returned to the city. The next day, Fan invited Yun to enter the city to settle the people. The sergeant Yun Chi rested, and only brought fifty cavalry into the city. Residents held the incense and bowed to the road. Yun Anmin had finished, and Zhao Fan invited him to the yamen for a banquet. When the wine was half full, Fan Fu invited Yun into the depths of the back hall to wash a cup and drink more. Yun Yin was slightly drunk, and Fan Hu invited a woman out to drink with Yun. Zilong saw that the woman was dressed in plain clothes and looked like a country and a city, so he asked Fan, ""Who is this?"" Fan said, ""My sister-in-law, Fan."" Zilong changed his face and respected her. After Mrs. Fan finished the cup, Fan Ling sat down. Thank you cloud. Fan Shi resigned and returned to the back hall. Yun said, ""Why do you need to ask your sister-in-law to raise your glass?"" Fan Xiao said, ""There is a reason in the middle, please don't stop me: my elder brother left the world for three years, and my sister-in-law lives as a widow. He remarried. His sister-in-law said: 'If we can get a person who can do all three things, we will marry him: first, he must be both civil and military, famous in the world; second, he must be handsome and dignified; third, he must share the same surname as his brother.' How can there be such a coincidence in the world? Today, the elder brother has a dignified appearance, is famous all over the world, and has the same surname as the elder brother, which is exactly what the elder sister-in-law said. My dear, how is it?"" Yun heard the words and became furious, and said sharply, ""My sister and your brother are brothers, and your sister-in-law is also my sister-in-law, so how can you do such a disorderly thing!"" Zhao Fan was ashamed and replied: ""I treat each other with kindness, how can I be so rude!"" Then he looked left and right, with the intention of harming each other. Yun Ji felt that he beat Zhao Fan with one punch, walked out of the house, and went out of the city on horseback.","Over the initial celebration wine, Zhao Fan notes that he and Zhao Zilong belong to the same family, come from the same town of Zhending and that five hundred years ago they were one family. So they dedicate themselves as sworn brothers one to the other. When Zilong rides into the city to take over, people are so relieved that there has been so little fighting they line the road offering incense, and Zilong assures them of their safety. Zhao Fan has prepared a banquet, and the two get quite drunk. Afterwards, Zhao Fan invites Zhao Zilong back to his own chambers, where, without warning, a beautiful woman dressed in formal mourning clothes of exquisite silk brings him wine. Her beauty is of the kind that overthrows empires! Needless to say, Zhao Zilong asks who she is. ‘She is my sister-in-law,’ says Zhao Fan, and Zilong bows graciously to this family member. Although Zhao Fan suggests that the woman join them, Zilong feels uncomfortable, and so the lady retires. Now a little troubled by what has happened, Zilong asks his new brother, ‘Why did you have your sister-in-law bring me my drink?’ ‘Ahh!’ says Zhao Fan. ‘I’ve a good reason. Her husband, my older brother, died three years ago. I’ve tried to suggest she should remarry, but to no avail. She’s set three criteria for any man she will marry. Firstly, he must be famous for both his literary and military accomplishments. Secondly, he must be good-looking and well thought of. And thirdly, he must have the same family name as her late husband. Now where on earth am I going to find someone like that? You, however, respected brother, meet all three criteria! So why don’t you marry her, even if she is plain-looking, and I will give her a dowry so she can be at your service and link our families for generations to come. Now, what do you say to that? Eh!’ Zilong is furious and he gets to his feet and lambasts his new brother. ‘We’ve sworn to be brothers, so your sister-in-law is also my sister-in-law! How on earth can you imagine I would want to confound that with such outrageously immodest behaviour!’ Zhao Fan is totally nonplussed and pleads that he meant no harm by the suggestion.","With a small party, Zhao Fan went out of the city and wended his way to Zhao Yun's camp. Zhao Yun received him graciously, offered him wine, and then accepted the seal of office. After the wine had gone round several times, Zhao Fan became talkative, saying, “General, your surname is the same as mine, and five centuries ago we were one family. You are from Changshan, and so am I. Moreover we are from the same village. If you do not mind, we might swear brotherhood. I should be very happy.” Zhao Yun was pleased and they compared ages. They were of the same year. However, Zhao Yun was the elder by four months, and so Zhao Fan made his bow as younger brother. The two men, having so many things in common, were very pleased with each other and seemed fitted to be close friends. At eventide the feast broke up, and the late Governor returned to his dwelling. Next day Zhao Fan requested Zhao Yun to enter the city, where, after Zhao Yun had assured the people of their safety, he went to a banquet at the state residence. When they had become mellow with wine, the Governor invited Zhao Yun into the inner quarters, where wine was again served. When Zhao Yun was a little intoxicated, his host bade a woman come forth and offer a cup of wine to the guest. The woman was dressed entirely in white silk, and her beauty was such as to overthrow cities and ruin states. “Who is she?” asked Zhao Yun. “My sister-in-law; she is of the Fan family.” Zhao Yun at once changed his look and treated her with deference. When she had offered the cup, the host told her to be seated and join the party, but Zhao Yun declined this addition to the evening and the lady withdrew. “Why did you trouble your sister-in-law to present wine to me, Brother?” asked Zhao Yun. “There is a reason,” said the host smiling. “I pray you let me tell you. My brother died three years ago and left her a widow. But this cannot be regarded as the end of the story. I have often advised her to marry again, but she said she would only do so if three conditions were satisfied in one man's person. The suitor must be famous for literary grace and warlike exploits, secondly, handsome and highly esteemed and, thirdly, of the same name as our own. Now where in all the world was such a combination likely to be found? Yet here are you, Brother, dignified, handsome, and prepossessing, a man whose name is known all over the wide world and of the desired name. You exactly fulfill my sister's ambitions. If you do not find her too plain, I should like her to marry you and I will provide a dowry. What think you of such an alliance, such a bond of relationship?” But Zhao Yun rose in anger, shouting, “As I have just sworn brotherhood with you, is not your sister-in-law my sister-in-law? How could you think of bringing such confusion into the relationship?” Shame suffused Zhao Fan's face, and he said, “I only thought of being kind to you; why are you so very rude to me?” Zhao Fan looked right and left to his attendants with murder in his eye. Zhao Yun raised his fist and knocked him down. Then he strode out of the place, mounted, and rode out of the city."
是夜二更，策臥於內宅，忽然陰風驟起，燈滅而復明。燈影之下，見于吉立於牀前。策大喝曰：“吾平生誓誅妖妄，以靖天下！汝旣為陰鬼，何敢近我！”取牀頭劍擲之，忽然不見。吳太夫人聞之，轉生憂悶。策乃扶病強行，以寬母心。母謂策曰：“聖人云：‘鬼神之為德，其盛矣乎！’又云：‘禱爾于上下神祇。’鬼神之事，不可不信。汝屈殺于先生，豈無報應？吾已令人設醮於郡之玉淸觀內，汝可親往拜禱，自然安妥。”策不敢違母命，只得勉強乘轎至玉淸觀。道士接入，請策焚香，策焚香而不謝。忽香爐中煙起不散，結成一座華蓋，上面端坐着于吉。策怒，唾罵之；走離殿宇，又見于吉立於殿門首，怒目視策。策顧左右曰：“汝等見妖鬼否？”左右皆云：“未見。”策愈怒，拔佩劍望于吉擲去，一人中劍而倒。衆視之，乃前日動手殺于吉之小卒，被劍斫入腦袋，七竅流血而死。策命扛出葬之。比及出觀，又見于吉走入觀門來。策曰：“此觀亦藏妖之所也！”遂坐於觀前，命武士五百人拆毁之。武士方上屋揭瓦，却見于吉立於屋上，飛瓦擲地。策大怒，傳令逐出本觀道士，放火燒燬殿宇。火起處，又見于吉立於火光之中。策怒歸府，又見于吉立於府門前。策乃不入府，隨點起三軍，出城外下寨，傳喚衆將商議，欲起兵助袁紹夾攻曹操。衆將俱曰：“主公玉體違和，未可輕動。且待平愈，出兵未遲。”,"It was the second watch of the night, when Ce was lying in the inner house, suddenly a cloudy wind arose, the lights went out and the light returned. Under the shadow of the lamp, Yu Ji was standing in front of the bed. Ce shouted loudly, ""I swear in my life to slay demons and arrogance, and to pacify the world! Ru Yan is a ghost, how dare you approach me!"" He took the sword from the bedside and threw it at him, but he suddenly disappeared. When Mrs. Wu Tai heard this, she was reincarnated and depressed. The policy is to help the sick and force it to widen the mother's heart. The mother said to Ce said: ""The sage said: 'The virtue of ghosts and gods is so prosperous!' and said: 'Pray to the gods above and below.' It has already been set up in the Yuqingguan of the county, you can go to pray in person, and it will be safe."" Ce did not dare to disobey his mother's order, so he had to take a sedan chair to the Yuqingguan reluctantly. Taoist priests, please burn incense, and do not thank you for burning incense. Suddenly, the smoke from the incense burner did not dissipate, forming a canopy on which Yu Ji was seated. Ce was angry and scolded him; walking away from the palace, he saw Yu Ji standing at the front of the palace gate again, glaring at Ce. Ce Gu said to the left and right, ""Have you seen a ghost?"" Everyone on the left and right said, ""I haven't seen it."" Ce became more angry, drew his sword and looked at Yu Ji and threw it, and one of them fell with the sword. It was seen by the public that it was the pawn who killed Yu Ji's pawn the day before yesterday. Policy life to carry out the burial. Compared with going out of the view, it is also seen that Yu Ji walked into the gate of view. Ce said, ""This temple is also a place where demons are hidden!"" So he sat in front of the temple and ordered five hundred warriors to demolish it. The warrior went up to the house to reveal the tiles, but saw Ji Li on the house, flying tiles to the ground. Ce was furious and ordered to expel the Taoist priest from Benguan and set fire to the temple. Where the fire started, it was also seen in Ji Li in the firelight. Ce Nu returned to the mansion, and was seen again at Ji Li in front of the mansion gate. Ce Nai did not enter the mansion, so he ordered the three armies, and went out of the city to the fortress. He summoned all the generals to discuss, and wanted to raise troops to help Yuan Shao attack Cao Cao. All the generals said: ""The lord's body violates the peace, and you can't move lightly. When the peace is healed, it's not too late to send troops.""","Sun Ce is about to order the execution of the soldiers who were on guard that night when Sun Ce sees Yu walking boldly in front of the main hall. Overcome, Sun Ce collapses and is borne off to his bed. His mother tries to appeal to him to repent, pointing out that his killing of Yu was a terrible crime. But he will not listen and grows even more desperate in his determination to ridicule and dismiss all such spiritual ideas. Eventually he does agree to his mother’s plea to go to offer prayers and incense at the local temple. He goes, burns the incense but refuses to pray. Suddenly Yu appears, sitting on top of the incense smoke. Retreating from the temple, Sun Ce suddenly finds Yu in front of him at the gate. Grasping a sword, he hurls it at the ghost. Flying through the air, it hits a soldier, who is killed instantly. This, it turns out, was the soldier who struck off Yu’s head the day before. Sun Ce encounters Yu’s spirit again beside the temple so he orders the entire place to be burned to the ground. As the flames leap up, Yu is seen sitting in the midst of them. Time and time again the spirit appears, until Sun Ce is screaming with fear; the experience has left him looking haggard.","That night about the third watch, as Sun Ce lay in his chamber, he suddenly felt a chill breeze, which seemed to extinguish the lamps for a moment, although they soon brightened again; and he saw in the lamp light the form of Yu Ji standing near his bed. Sun Ce said, “I am the sworn foe of witchcraft, and I will purge the world of all such as deal in magic. You are a spirit, and how dare you approach me?” Reaching down a sword that hung at the head of his bed, he hurled it at the phantom, which then disappeared. When his mother heard this story, her grief redoubled. Sun Ce, ill as he was, went to see his mother and did his utmost to reassure her. She said, “Confucius the Teacher says: 'How abundantly do spiritual beings display the powers that belong to them!' and 'Prayer has been made to the spirits of the upper and lower worlds.' You must have faith. You sinned in putting Saint Yu Ji to death, and retribution is sure. I have already sent to have sacrifices performed at the Jade-Pure Monastery, and you should go in person to pray. May all come right!” Sun Ce could not withstand such a mandate from his mother so, mustering all his strength, he managed to get into a sedan chair and went to the monastery, where the Taoists received him respectfully and begged him to light the incense. He did so, but he returned no thanks. To the surprise of all, the smoke from the brazier, instead of floating upwards and dissipating, collected in a mass that gradually shaped itself into an umbrella, and there on the top sat Yu Ji. Sun Ce simply spat abuse and went out of the temple. As he passed the gates, lo! Yu Ji stood there gazing at him with angry eyes. “Do you see that wizard fellow?” said he to those about him. They said they saw nothing. More angry than ever, he flung his sword at the figure by the gate. The sword struck one of his escorts who fell. Sun Ce told them to bury the man. But as he went out of the courtyard, he saw Yu Ji walking in. “This temple is nothing more than a lurking place for sorcerers and wizards and such people,” said Sun Ce. Whereupon he took a seat in front of the building and sent for five hundred soldiers to pull the place down. When they went up on the roof to strip off the tiles, Sun Ce saw Yu Ji standing on the main beam flicking tiles to the ground. More angry than ever, Sun Ce told them to drive out the priests belonging to the place and burn it. They did so, and when the flames rose their highest, Sun Ce saw the dead Taoist Yu Ji standing in the midst of the fire. Sun Ce returned home still in a bad humor, which increased when he saw the form of Yu Ji standing at his gate. He would not enter but mustered his army and went into camp outside the city walls. And there he summoned his officers to meet him and talk over joining Yuan Shao in an attack on Cao Cao. They assembled, but they remonstrated with him and begged him to consider his precious health."

Cao You gathered a group of advisors and said, ""I want to attack Lv Bu, and I don't worry about Yuan Shao's constraints, but I'm afraid that Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu will talk about their back ears."" Xun You said: ""The two of them are new, and they don't dare to move lightly. Lv Bu is brave, if more Connecting with Yuan Shu, across Huai and Si, it is urgent to plan."" Guo Jia said, ""Now we can take advantage of his initial rebellion, but everyone has no heart to attack him."" Following his words, he ordered Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, and Lu Qian. , Li Dian led 50,000 troops to go first, and the army of the self-reigned army marched one after another, followed by Jian Yong. Gao Shun had already been visited by horses. Shunfei reported to Lu Bu. Bu Shiling, Hou Cheng, Hao Meng, and Cao Xing, led more than 200 cavalry to meet Gao Shun, and sent them 30 miles away from Pei City to meet Cao's army. Xuande saw Gao Shun retreating in Xiaopei City, and knew that Cao's troops were coming, so he only left Sun Qian to guard the city, Mi Zhu and Mi Fang to guard the home, but he, Guan and Zhang Ergong, sent all the troops out of the city, and split down to join Cao's army.","But his army is decisively beaten by Lü Bu’s commander Gao Shun, who comes back from defeating Cao Cao to reinforce the attack on Xuande.","When Jian Yong, Liu Bei's messenger, reached the capital, he saw Cao Cao and told him what had happened. The advisers were called to discuss a plan. Cao Cao said, “I wish to attack Lu Bu. I fear not Yuan Shao, but Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu may attack me in the rear.” Xun You, the nephew of Xun Yu, replied, “Both these latter have been too recently defeated to do anything so rash. But Lu Bu is a bold fighting man, and if he joined forces with Yuan Shu and they set themselves to conquer River Huai and River Si , the problem would he difficult.” Then spoke Guo Jia, “Let us take advantage of the moment before they have fully made up their mind. Smite before they are fully prepared.” And Cao Cao did so. An army of fifty thousand were sent in advance with four commanders—Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Lu Qian, and Li Dian. Cao Cao commanded the center army, which marched by divisions, and Jian Yong brought up the rear. Soon the scouts informed Gao Shun. He sent flying messengers to Lu Bu, who detached two hundred horse with Hou Cheng, Cao Xing, and He Meng to assist him. Gao Shun posted this reinforcement and his army about ten miles from Xiaopei to meet Cao Cao's army. Lu Bu and the main army also followed close. When Liu Bei saw the enemy retiring from the city, he knew Cao Cao's army was close at hand. So, making arrangements for guarding the city within, he and his two brothers marched their troops out of the city and made a camp, that they might be ready to assist."

The two armies will meet at Shouchun Jiekou. Qiao Rui was the first to go into action, but he did not fight with Xiahou Dun, and was killed by Xiahou Dun. The army was defeated and ran back to the city. Suddenly, Sun Ce sent a boat to attack the west of the river, Lü Bu led his troops to the east, Liu Bei, Guan and Zhang led his troops to the south, and Cao Zi led 170,000 troops to the north. Surprised by the technique, he hurriedly gathered a crowd to discuss civil and military affairs. General Yang said: ""Shouchun has been flooded and drought for years, and people are short of food; now they have moved troops to disturb the people, and the people are resentful. Changes. Your Majesty will command the Lin army to cross the Huai River: one will be familiar, and the two will temporarily avoid its sharpness."" Shu used his words, leaving Li Feng, Lejiu, Liang Gang, and Chen Ji to divide their troops into 100,000 troops and stick to Shouchun; the rest of the generals The soldiers also kept treasures of gold and jade, and cleaned up all of them.","Zhang Xiu has now teamed up with Liu Biao, and Cao Cao starts to pay them attention, defeating Zhang Xiu in open battle. Zhang Xiu retreats to his city of Nanyang and shuts himself up. Surrounded by Cao Cao’s men, who look set to break in, all seems doomed for Zhang Xiu. Then his adviser Jia Xu comes forward with plans for trapping Cao Cao. Can Jia Xu fool Cao Cao? Read on. CHAPTER 18 Jia Xu wins a great victory. Guo Jia gives Cao Cao ten reasons for victory.","On Yuan Shu's side, General Qiao Rui with fifty thousand troops was appointed Van Leader. The armies met on the confines of the city of Shouchun. Qiao Rui and Xiahou Dun rode out and opened battle. But Qiao Rui fell in the third bout, and his troops fled into the city. Then came news that Sun Ce's fleet was near and would attack on the west. The other three land corps took each one face—Cao Cao on the north, Lu Bu on the east, and Liu Bei on the south. The city of Shouchun was in a parlous state. At this juncture Yuan Shu summoned his officers. Yang Dajiang explained the case, “Shouchun has suffered from drought for several years and the people are on the verge of famine. Sending an army would add to the distress and anger the people, and victory would be uncertain. I advise not to send any more soldiers there, but to hold on till the besiegers are conquered by lack of supplies. Meanwhile, Your Highness, with regiment of guards, will move over to the other side of River Huai, which is quite ready, and we shall also escape the enemy's ferocity.” So due arrangements was made. One hundred thousand troops under Li Feng, Yue Jiu, Liang Gang, and Chen Ji were appointed to guard Shouchun. Then a general move was made to the other side of the River Huai. Not only the remained army went over, but all the accumulated wealth of the Yuan family, gold and silver, jewels and precious stones, were moved also."

Suddenly, the angel came, and went out of Guo to meet him and entered the county. The envoy said: ""The lord and marquis received this kind order, which is the power of General Cao's recommendation before the emperor."" Xuande thanked him. The messenger took out the private book and handed it to Xuande. Xuande looked at it and said, ""This matter is still up for discussion."" Xuande discussed the matter with everyone overnight. Zhang Fei said: ""Lu Bu is an unrighteous person, what's the hindrance to killing him?"" Xuande said: ""He is too poor to come to join me. If I kill him, it will be unjust."" Zhang Fei said: ""It is difficult to be a good person!"" Xuande Not from. The next day, Lu Bu came to congratulate him, and Xuande invited him to see him. Bu said: ""Duke Wen has been ordered by the court to come here to congratulate each other."" Xuan Dexun thanked him. Seeing Zhang Fei pulling his sword up the hall and wanting to kill Lu Bu, Xuande hurriedly stopped him. Bu was startled and said, ""Why does Yide only want to kill me?"" Zhang Fei shouted, ""Cao Cao said that you are an unrighteous person, and told my brother to kill you!"" Xuande shouted back. He led Lü Bu into the back hall with him, and told the truth; he took the secret letter sent by Cao Cao to Lü Bu to read. After Bu finished reading it, he wept and said, ""This is Cao thief trying to make the two of you discord!"" Xuande said, ""Brother, don't worry: Liu Bei swears not to do this unjust thing."" Lü Bu thanked him again and again. Prepare to leave cloth to drink, and return to the evening. Guan and Zhang said, ""Why didn't your brother kill Lv Bu?"" Xuande said, ""This Cao Mengde was afraid that I would conspire with Lv Bu to attack him, so he used this tactic to make the two of us annex each other, and he took advantage of it. Why?"" Guan Gong nodded and said yes. Zhang Fei said: ""I just want to kill this thief to avoid future troubles!"" Xuande said, ""This is not what a man did.""","Delighted with this suggestion, Cao Cao arranges for the emperor’s commission to be sent along with the secret orders to Xuande in Xuzhou. Xuande receives the envoy and is, of course, pleased to be promoted but troubled by the secret orders. Not so Zhang Fei, who has always hated Lü Bu. When Lü Bu comes to congratulate Xuande on his promotion, Zhang Fei charges in with a drawn sword and bursts out that Xuande has orders to kill Lü Bu. Having driven Zhang Fei out of the room, Xuande reassures Lü Bu that he has no intention of doing as the secret orders have commanded. It is some time later that Guan Yu and Zhang Fei confront Xuande and demand to know why he would not obey the secret orders. But Xuande has seen through the plot and explains it to his two friends. While Guan Yu understands, Zhang Fei does not, declaring that he is more than ever ready to kill Lü Bu. When Cao Cao is informed by the envoy that Xuande has no intention of killing Lü Bu, Xun Wenruo comes up with another saying.","In Xuzhou, when Liu Bei heard of the change of capital, he began to prepare a congratulatory address. In the midst of this an imperial messenger was announced and was met which all ceremony outside the gate. When the epistle had been reverently received, a banquet was prepared for the messenger. The messenger said, “This decree was obtained for you by Prime Minister Cao Cao.” Liu Bei thanked him. Then the messenger drew forth his secret letter. After reading it, Liu Bei said, “This matter can be easily arranged.” The banquet over and the messenger conducted to his lodging to seek repose. Liu Bei, before going to rest, called in his councilors to consider the letter. “There need be no compunction about putting him to death;” said Zhang Fei, “ Lu Bu is a bad man.” “But he came to me for protection in his weakness; how can I put him to death? That would be immoral,” said Liu Bei. “If he was a good man; it would be difficult,” replied Zhang Fei. Liu Bei would not consent. Next day, when Lu Bu came to offer congratulations, he was received as usual. He said, “I have come to felicitate you on the receipt of the imperial bounty.” Liu Bei thanked him in due form. But then he saw Zhang Fei draw his sword and come up the hall as if to slay Lu Bu. Liu Bei hastily interfered and stopped Zhang Fei. Lu Bu was surprised and said, “Why do you wish to slay me, Zhang Fei?” “Cao Cao says you are immoral and tells my brother to kill you,” shouted Zhang Fei. Liu Bei shouted again and again to Zhang Fei to go away, and he led Lu Bu into the private apartments out of the way. Then he told Lu Bu the whole story and showed him the secret letter. Lu Bu wept as he finished reading, “This is that miscreant's scheme for sowing discord between us.” “Be not anxious, Elder Brother,” said Liu Bei. “I pledge myself not to be guilty of such an infamous crime.” Lu Bu again and again expressed his gratitude, and Liu Bei kept him for a time. They remained talking and drinking wine till late. Said Guan Yu and Zhang Fei later, “Why not kill him?” Liu Bei said, “Because Cao Cao fears that Lu Bu and I may attack him, he is trying to separate us and get us to swallow each other, while he steps in and takes the advantage. Is there any other reason?” Guan Yu nodded assent, but Zhang Fei said, “I want to get him out of the way lest he trouble us later.” “That is not what a noble man should do,” said his elder brother."

Suddenly, he shouted loudly, and an army rushed out from behind, cutting off half of the men and horses first. Xiahou Dun is here again. Xuande broke through and left, and Xiahou Yuan came from behind. Xuande recalled that there were more than 30 cavalry to follow; he was eager to return to Xiaopei, and saw the fire in the city of Xiaopei, so he had to abandon Xiaopei and wanted to go to Xuzhou and Bupi; Live on the way. Xuande thought to himself that he had nowhere to go, and thought: ""Yuan Shao said, 'If you don't like it, you can come to meet with each other', now it's better to go to Yiqi for a while, and don't make a good plan."" Code stopped. Xuande's horse fled to the north, and Li Dianluo would ride away.","Meanwhile, Xuande is unaware of what is happening and is also ambushed. He loses touch with half his men, who are cut off by an attack from the rear. Before him appear Xiahou Dun and his men. They clash, many of Xuande’s men dying in the battle. With only around thirty men, Xuande manages to escape. But Xiaopei is on fire, so there is no safety there. The road to Xiapi is blocked by the enemy and the route to Xuzhou likewise cut. In despair, Xuande heads north for Qingzhou and Yuan Shao. In the turmoil and chaos, he manages to escape. But all his men are captured.","He thought to make for Xuzhou but felt certain that way was also barred. No other way seemed open, and so he made for the Mangdang Hills. As Liu Bei drew near the camp, he intended to attack when he heard the din of battle. Then he was attacked in the rear and very soon had lost half his force. Next Xiahou Dun came to attack. Thereupon Liu Bei bolted. He was pursued by Xiahou Yuan. Presently Liu Bei looked about him and found he had less than half a hundred soldiers following him. He set his face in the direction of Xiaopei. But before long Liu Bei saw that place was in flames. So he changed his plan and went toward Xiapi. However he found the whole countryside full of the enemy, and he could not get through. So he bethought himself of the promise of Yuan Shao, that he would find refuge if things went unfavorable, and determined to go to Yuan Shao till he could form some other plan. Wherefore he took the Qingzhou road. But it also was blocked, and he went into the open country and made his way north, not without being pursued and losing the remainder of his few followers."

Cao ordered Xu Chu and Dian Wei to be the vanguard, Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan to be the left army, Li Dian and Le Jin to be the right army, Cao to lead the middle army, and Yu Jin and Lu Qian to be the rear. When the soldiers arrived in Puyang, Lv Bu wanted to send his generals to meet him. Chen Gong admonished: ""You can't go to battle. You can wait until after the generals have gathered."" Lv Bu said, ""Who am I afraid of coming?"" scold. Xu Chu came out. Twenty-two fights, no winner or loser. Cao said, ""Lü Bu cannot be defeated by one person."" He sent Dian Wei to help, and the two generals attacked. Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan on the left, Li Dian and Le Jin on the right all arrived, and the six men would attack Lu Bu together. Bu Zhe couldn't stop him, so he moved his horse back to the city. The Tian family in the city, seeing that Bu was defeated, was anxious to pull up the suspension bridge. Bu shouted, ""Open the door!"" Tian said, ""I have surrendered General Cao."" Bu yelled, leading the army to Dingtao. Chen Gong hurriedly opened the east gate to protect Lu Bu from the city. Cao then got Puyang, and forgive Tian's old sins. Liu Ye said, ""Lü Bu is a fierce tiger. Today, he is tired, so he must be spared."" Liu Ye and others were ordered to guard Puyang, and he led his army to Dingtao. At that time, Lü Bu, Zhang Miao, and Zhang Chao were all in the city, while Gao Shun, Zhang Liao, Zang Ba, and Hou Cheng were patrolling the sea to fetch grain and did not return. Caoing the army to Dingtao, without fighting for several days, led the army to retreat forty li to the village. When the wheat was cooked in Ji County, the army ordered the army to cut the wheat for food. After making a detailed report to Lu Bu, Bu led the army to come. Approaching Cao Village, when you see the lush forests on the left, you may be ambushing soldiers. When Cao Zhi Bu's army returned, he told the generals, ""I suspect that there are ambush soldiers in the forest, so you can plant more flags and flags in the forest to suspect them. There is no water in the long embankment in the west of the village, so all the elite soldiers can be ambushed. Tomorrow Lu Bu will come and burn them. Lin, after the army in the embankment is cut off, Bu can be captured."" So they stopped fifty drummers to beat the drums in the village; they captured men and women from the village and shouted in the village. There are many elite soldiers in the dike.","With the threat from Lü Bu contained, Cao Cao returns to his consuming desire to try to capture Xuzhou, in order to punish those whom he believes have murdered his family.","And thus Yanzhou was recaptured. Next Cheng Yu proposed an expedition to take Puyang. Cao Cao marched his army out in perfect order. The van leaders were Dian Wei and Xu Chu; Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan led the left wing; Li Dian and Yue Jin led the right wing; Yu Jin and Lu Qian guarded the rear. Cao Cao himself commanded the center. When they approached Puyang, Lu Bu wished to go out in person and alone to attack, but his adviser Chen Gong protested, saying, “General, you should not go out until the arrival of the other officers.” “Whom do I fear?” said Lu Bu. So he threw caution to the winds and went out of the city. He met his foes and he began to revile them. The redoubtable Xu Chu went to fight with him, but after twenty bouts neither combatant was any the worse. “He is not the sort that one man can overcome,” said Cao Cao. And he sent Dian Wei to attack Lu Bu from another direction. Lu Bu stood the double onslaught. Soon after the flank commanders joined in—Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan attacking the left; Li Dian and Yue Jin surrounding the right. Lu Bu had six opponents. These proved really too many for him so he turned his horse and rode back to the city. But when the members of the Tian family saw him coming back beaten, they raised the drawbridge. Lu Bu shouted, “Open the gates! Let me in!” But the Tians said, “We have gone over to Cao Cao.” This was hard to hear and the beaten man abused them roundly before he left. Chen Gong got away through the east gate taking with him the general's family. Thus Puyang came into Cao Cao's hands, and for their present services the Tian family were pardoned their previous fault. However, Liu Ye said, “Lu Bu is a savage beast. If let alive, he will be a great danger. Hunt him down!” Liu Ye was ordered to keep Puyang. Wherefore Cao Cao determined to follow Lu Bu to Dingtao whither he had gone for refuge. Lu Bu, Zhang Miao, and Zhang Chao were assembled in the city. Gao Shun and other generals were out foraging. Cao Cao army arrived but did not attack for many days, and presently he withdrew fifteen miles and made a stockade. It was the time of harvest, and he set his soldiers to cut the wheat for food. The spies reported this to Lu Bu who came over to see. But when he saw that Cao Cao's stockade lay near a thick wood, he feared an ambush and retired. Cao Cao heard that Lu Bu had come and gone and guessed the reason. “He fears an ambush in the wood,” said Cao Cao. “We will set up flags there and deceive him. There is a long embankment near the camp but behind it there is no water. There we will lay an ambush to fall upon Lu Bu when he comes to burn the wood.” So Cao Cao hid all his soldiers behind the embankment except half a hundred drummers, and he got together many peasants to loiter within the stockade as though it was not empty."

時也陰陽旣亂，昧爽不分。訝長空之一色，忽大霧之四屯。雖輿薪而莫覩，惟金鼓之可聞。初若溟濛，纔隱南山之豹；漸而充塞，欲迷北海之鯤。然後上接高天，下垂厚地。渺乎蒼茫，浩乎無際。鯨鯢出水而騰波，蛟龍潛淵而吐氣。又如梅霖收溽，春陰釀寒；溟溟漠漠，浩浩漫漫。東失柴桑之岸，南無夏口之山。戰船千艘，俱沈淪於岩壑；漁舟一葉，驚出沒於波瀾。甚則穹昊無光，朝陽失色；返白晝為昏黃，變丹山為水碧。雖大禹之智，不能測其深淺；離婁之明，焉能辨乎咫尺？,"Yin and yang are also in chaos at times, and there is no distinction between ignorance and goodness. Astonished at the color of the sky, suddenly the four villages of the fog. Although the public salary is not to be seen, only the golden drum can be heard. At the beginning, it was like a foggy sea, and it was only when the leopards of the South Mountain were hidden; Then it rises to the sky and sags to the ground. Vastly vast, vast and boundless. The whale and salamander rises out of the water, and the dragon dives into the abyss and exhales. Another example is Mei Lin's harvest, and the spring yin is cold; To the east is the shore of Chaisang, and to the south there is no mountain of Xiakou. Thousands of warships sank in the ravines; a leaf of a fishing boat was terrified in the waves. Even then, the sky becomes dull, and the morning sun loses its color; when it returns to daytime, it becomes dim and yellow, and the mountains turn into clear water. Although the wisdom of the Great Yu cannot measure its depth; how can it be discerned within a short distance from the wisdom of Lou?","By the time of the fifth watch, the boats are nearing the north shore, and it is now that Kong Ming orders the sailors to beat the drums and shout out loud as if they are a huge invading force.","Then darkness falls, too dense for any torch Illumine; only clanging sounds can pass. The fog at first appears, a vaporous wreath Scarce visible. But thickening fast, it veils The southern hills, the painted leopard's home. And spreads afar, until the northern sea Leviathans are amazed and lose their course. And denser yet it touches on the sky. And spreads a heavy mantle over the earth. Then, wide as is the high pitched arch of heaven, Therein appears no single rift of blue. Now mighty whales lead up their spouses to sport Upon the waves, the sinuous dragons dive Deep down and, breathing, swell the heaving sea, The earth is moist as with the early rains, And spring's creative energy is chilled. Both far and wide and high the damp fog spreads, Great cities on the eastern bank are hid, Wide ports and mountains in the south are lost, Whole fleets of battle ships, a thousand keels, Hide in the misty depths; frail fishing boats High riding on a wave are seen—and lost. The gloom increases and the domed sky Grows dark and darker as the sun's light fails. The daylight dies, dim twilight's reign begins, The ruddy hills dissolve and lose their hue. The skill of matchless King Yu would fail to sound The depth and height; and Li Lou's eye, though keen, Could never pierce this gloom."

却說曹操使張遼、許褚探長坂橋消息，回報曰：“張飛已拆斷橋梁而去矣。”操曰：“彼斷橋而去，乃心怯也。”遂傳令差一萬軍，速搭三座浮橋，只今夜就要過。李典曰：“此恐是諸葛亮之詐謀，不可輕進。”操曰：“張飛一勇之夫，豈有詐謀？”遂傳下號令，火速進兵。,"But they said that Cao Cao sent Zhang Liao and Xu Chu to inspect Changban Bridge, and they reported back: ""Zhang Fei has broken the bridge and left."" Take three pontoon bridges, only to cross tonight. Li Dian said, ""This is probably Zhuge Liang's trick, so don't advance lightly."" Cao said, ""Zhang Fei is a brave husband, how could there be a trick?"" Then he issued an order to advance quickly.","And, as Xuande predicted, Cao Cao sees the destruction of the bridge as a sign of exactly that weakness, and pontoon bridges are created that very night to ferry the vast army across the bridgeless river. Soon the advance guard is across the river and heading for Xuande and his men when out of the blue a warrior with a troop of ten thousand men bursts onto the scene.","The two generals sent by Cao Cao to reconnoiter near Long Slope Bridge returned, saying, “The bridge has been destroyed; Zhang Fei has left.” “Then he is afraid,” said Cao Cao. Cao Cao at once gave orders to set ten thousand men at work on three floating bridges to be finished that night. Li Dian said, “I fear this is one of the wiles of Zhuge Liang; so be careful.” “Zhang Fei is just a bold warrior, but there is no guile about him,” said Cao Cao. He gave orders for immediate advance."

When he was about to cross the river, he suddenly saw a group of men and horses approaching, and looked at it, it was Guan Yunchang. Song Zhong evaded and was called by Yun Chang to inquire about Jingzhou. At the beginning of loyalty, he kept a secret; later, he was cross-examined by Yunchang, so he had to tell the truth one by one. Yun Chang was startled, and he followed Song Zhong to Xinye to see Xuande and prepared to say what happened. Xuande cried when he heard it. Zhang Fei said: ""This is the case, you can first kill Song Zhong, follow the army across the river, capture Xiangyang, kill Cai Shi and Liu Cong, and then fight Cao Cao."" Xuande said: ""You keep your mouth shut. I have my own discretion. ""Neiqiang Song Zhong and said: ""You know that people do things, why didn't you come to report me earlier? Even if you kill you now, it will not help you. You can go quickly."" Zhong thanked him and ran away.","Liu Zong is gradually convinced that there is no other option, and a messenger is sent to Cao Cao offering the surrender of the lands. Cao Cao is delighted to hear this and agrees. But in his reply message he insists that Liu Zong must come out and formally welcome him in front of the gates of Jingzhou. However, when travelling back to say the offer has been accepted, the messenger is captured by none other than Guan Yu. Brought before Xuande, the captured messenger confesses all, showing Xuande the letter.","Song Zhong left the city and took the homeward way. He had nearly reached the ferry when he fell in with a party of horse. On a closer look he saw the leader was Guan Yu. The messenger tried to escape observation, but was presently captured and taken to the leader to be questioned. At first he prevaricated but on being closely questioned told the whole story. Then he was carried off to Xinye and made to retell his story to Liu Bei who heard it with lamentations. Zhang Fei said, “This being so, I propose that we put this fellow to death, then cross the river, attack Xiangyang, and make an end of the Cai tribe and Liu Zong as well. Then we can attack Cao Cao.” But Liu Bei replied, “Hold on. I have something more to say.” Then turning to the prisoner, Liu Bei shouted, “When they did all this why did you not come to tell me? As things are now, there is nothing to be gained by killing you. You may go.” Song Zhong stammered his thanks, threw his arms over his head, and ran away."

長沙太守孫堅出曰：“堅願為前部。”紹曰：“文臺勇烈，可當此任。”堅遂引本部人馬殺奔汜水關來。守關將士，差流星馬往洛陽丞相府告急。董卓自專大權之後，每日飲宴。李儒接得告急文書，逕來稟卓。卓大驚，急聚衆將商議。温侯呂布挺身出曰：“父親勿慮：關外諸侯，布視之如草芥。願提虎狼之師，盡斬其首，懸於都門。”卓大喜曰：“吾有奉先，高枕無憂矣！”言未絕，呂布背後一人高聲出曰：“‘割雞焉用牛刀？’不勞温侯親往。吾斬衆諸侯首級，如探囊取物耳。”卓視之，其人身長九尺，虎體狼腰，豹頭猿臂：關西人也：姓華，名雄。卓聞言大喜，加為驍騎校尉，撥馬步軍五萬，同李肅、胡軫、趙岑星夜赴關迎敵。衆諸侯內有濟北相鮑信，尋思孫堅旣為前部，怕他奪了頭功，暗撥其弟鮑忠，先將馬步軍三千，逕抄小路，直到關下搦戰。華雄引鐵騎五百，飛下關來，大喝：“賊將休走！”鮑忠急待退，被華雄手起刀落，斬於馬下，生擒將校極多。華雄遣人齎鮑忠首級來相府報捷，卓加雄為都督。,"Sun Jian, the prefect of Changsha, went out and said, ""Jian is willing to be the front."" Shao said, ""Wentai is brave and fierce, and you can take this post."" Jian then led his troops to kill and rushed to Sishui Pass. The guards guarding the gates sent Meteor Horse to the Prime Minister's Mansion in Luoyang for emergency. Since Dong Zhuo assumed power, he drank every day. Li Ru received the urgent document and went to Zhuo directly. Zhuo was shocked and hurriedly gathered the generals to discuss. Wen Hou Lu Bu stepped forward and said: ""Father, don't worry: the princes outside the customs, Bu regards them as grass. I wish to raise the teacher of tigers and wolves, behead all of them, and hang them at the gate of the capital."" Zhuo Daxi said: ""I have Feng Xian, so I can sit back and relax. Before he finished speaking, a person behind Lu Bu said loudly: ""'What is the use of a bull's knife to cut a chicken?' Foot, tiger body, wolf waist, leopard head and ape arm: Kansai people also: surname Hua, name Xiong. Zhuo heard that he was overjoyed, and he was appointed as a cavalry school captain. Among the feudal lords, Bao Xin, Prime Minister of Jibei, was thinking of Sun Jianyan as the front, fearing that he would take the lead. Hua Xiong led five hundred iron cavalry and flew down from the gate, shouting, ""The thief will leave!"" Bao Zhong was eager to retreat, but Hua Xiong's sword fell, and he was slashed under the horse, and many generals were captured alive. Huaxiong sent the head of Ji Baozhong to the Prime Minister's Mansion to report the victory, and Zhuo Jiaxiong was the governor.","Meanwhile Sun Jian has also joined, and he offers to form the advance party heading to the pass: this is happily accepted by one and all. The news of this swiftly reaches the capital, though Dong Zhuo is so sunk in debauchery he barely pays any attention. Li Ru, however, takes it very seriously and he summons the council in response. Dong Zhuo’s adopted son Lü Bu tells him, ‘Father, don’t worry. These are just straws in the wind, and I’ll deal with them.’ But someone else challenges him in a dismissive way and says, ‘A butcher’s knife just to kill a chicken!’ The one who spoke is Hua Xiong, a huge man, built like a tiger and as swift as a wolf, with a forehead like a panther and arms like a monkey. Dong Zhuo loves both this comment and the man’s self-assurance, so Hua Xiong is sent off that very night with fifty thousand troops to stop the enemy at the pass. The armies of Sun Jian and Hua Xiong clash violently at the pass, and Sun Jian is forced to retreat.","Then the Governor of Changsha, Sun Jian, offered himself for this service. “You are valiant and fierce, and equal to this service,” said Yuan Shao. The force under Sun Jian set out and presently came to River Si Pass. The guard there sent a swift rider to the capital to announce to the Prime Minister the urgency of the situation. Ever since Dong Zhuo had secured his position, he had given himself up to luxury without stint. When the urgent news reached the adviser Li Ru, he at once went to his master, who much alarmed called a great council. Lu Bu stood forth and said, “Do not fear, my father; I look upon all the lords beyond the passes as so much stubble. And with the warriors of our fierce army, I will put every one of them to death and hang their heads at the gates of the capital.” “With your aid I can sleep secure,” said Dong Zhuo. But some one behind Lu Bu broke in upon his speech saying, “An ox-cleaver to kill a chicken! There is no need for the General to go; I will cut off their heads as easily as I would take a thing out of my pocket.” Dong Zhuo looked up and his eyes rested on a stalwart man of fierce mien, lithe and supple as a beast. He had round head like a leopard and shoulders like an ape's. His name was Hua Xiong of Guanxi. Dong Zhuo rejoiced at Hua Xiong's bold words and at once appointed him Commander of Royal Cavaliers and gave him fifty thousand of horse and foot. Hua Xiong and three other generals—Li Su, Hu Zhen, and Zhao Cen—hastily moved toward River Si Pass. Among the feudal lords, Bao Xin, the Lord of Jibei, was jealous lest the chosen Van Leader Sun Jian should win too great honors. Wherefore Bao Xin endeavored to meet the foe first, and so he secretly dispatched his brother, Bao Zhong, with three thousand by a bye road. As soon as this small force reached the Pass, they offered battle. Fast reacting, Hua Xiong at the head of five hundred armored horsemen swept down from the Pass crying, “Flee not, rebel!” But Bao Zhong was afraid and turned back. Hua Xiong came on, his arm rose, the sword fell, and Bao Zhong was cut down from his horse. Most of Bao Zhong's company were captured. Bao Zhong's head was sent to the Prime Minister's palace. Hua Xiong was promoted to Commander in Chief."

But Dong Chengtuo was sick. Wang Zifu and the others were all afraid of being suspicious, so they had to come. Cao set up a seat in the back hall. After a few rounds of the wine line, he said, ""There is nothing to enjoy at the feast. I have one person to sober up the officials."" Twenty prison guards were ordered: ""Bring it to me!"" to the next step. Cao said, ""All the officials don't know: This person is affiliated with the evil party and wants to turn against the imperial court and murder Cao. Today is defeated, please listen to the words."" Ji Ping woke up, opened his eyes and gnashed his teeth and cursed: ""Fuck the thief! If you don't kill me, when will you wait?"" Cao said: ""There are six co-conspirators first, and there are seven with you?"" Ping just cursed. Wang Zifu and the other four looked at each other, like sitting on pins and needles.

Cao Cao then speaks: ‘Unbeknown to you, my officials, this man was part of a plot to overthrow the court and to murder me. But Heaven has thwarted their evil plans, as you’ll now hear from the prisoner.’ So saying, he orders the guards to beat Ji Ping. The treatment is so rough he collapses. Brought round by having water thrown in his face, he shouts out, ‘You traitor, Cao Cao!","Having issued orders to prepare a banquet for next day, Cao Cao invited all the courtiers thereto. Dong Cheng was the only one who excused himself, saying he was unwell. The other conspirators dared not stay away as they felt they would be suspected. Tables were laid in the private apartments, and after several courses the host said, “There is not much to amuse us today, but I have a man to show you that will sober you.” “Bring him in!” Cao Cao said, turning to the gaolers, and the hapless Ji Ping appeared, securely fastened in a wooden collar. He was placed where all could see him. “You officials do not know that this man is connected with a gang of evil doers who desire to overturn the government and even injure me. However, Heaven has defeated their plans, but I desire that you should hear his evidence.” Then Cao Cao ordered the gaolers to beat their prisoner. They did so till Ji Ping lay unconscious, when they revived him by spraying water over his face. As soon as he came to, he glared at his oppressor and ground his teeth. “Cao Cao, you rebel! What are you waiting for? Why not kill me?” cried Ji Ping. Cao Cao replied, “The conspirators were only six at first; you made the seventh. Is that true?” Here the prisoner broke in with more abuse, while Wang Zifu and the other three conspirators exchanged glances, looking as though they were sitting on a rug full of needles. Cao Cao continued his torture of the prisoner, beating him into unconsciousness and reviving him with cold water, the victim disdaining to ask mercy. Finally Cao Cao realized he would incriminate none of his accomplices, and so he told the gaolers to remove Ji Ping."
忽又一人大聲曰：“公好為大言，未必眞有實學，恐適為儒者所笑耳。”孔明視其人，乃汝南程德樞也。孔明答曰：“儒有君子小人之別：君子之儒，忠君愛國，守正惡邪，務使澤及當時，名留後世。若夫小人之儒，惟務雕蟲，專工翰墨，靑春作賦，皓首窮經，筆下雖有千言，胸中實無一策；且如楊雄以文章名世，而屈身事莽，不免投閣而死，此所謂小人之儒也；雖日賦萬言，亦何取哉！”程德樞不能對。衆人見孔明對答如流，盡皆失色。,"Suddenly another person said loudly: ""The public wants to be a big talker, but he may not have real knowledge, and I may be laughed at by Confucians."" Kong Ming regarded him as Cheng Deshu in Runan. Kong Ming replied: ""Confucianism has the distinction between a gentleman and a villain: the gentleman is a Confucian who is loyal to the monarch and patriotic, guards the righteousness and evil, and keeps his name up to the time. In the spring of the fu, with a rich head and a poor scripture, although there are thousands of words in the pen, there is really no strategy in the heart; and like Yang Xiong, who is famous for his articles, but he stoops to do things recklessly, and he will inevitably die in the cabinet. This is the so-called Confucianism of the villain; What is it to say!"" Cheng Deshu couldn't be right. Seeing that Kongming's answers were flowing like a stream, everyone lost their color.","Sun Quan, after the opening formal greetings, goes straight to the heart of the matter and asks Kong Ming how strong Cao Cao really is in terms of his military forces.","But another disputant, Cheng Deshu by name, suddenly shouted, “You are mightily fond of big words, Sir, but they do not give any proof of your scholarship after all. I am inclined to think that a real scholar would just laugh at you.” Zhuge Liang replied, “There is the noble scholar, loyal and patriotic, of perfect rectitude and a hater of any crookedness. The concern of such a scholar is to act in full sympathy with his day and leave to future ages a fine reputation. There is the scholar of the mean type, a pedant and nothing more. He labors constantly with his pen, in his callow youth composing odes and in hoary age still striving to understand the classical books completely. Thousands of words flow from his pen, but there is not a solid idea in his breast. He may, as did Yang Xiong, glorify the age with his writings and yet stoop to serve a tyrant such as Wang Mang. No wonder Yang Xiong threw himself out of a window; he had to. That is the way of the scholar of mean type. Though he composes odes by the hundred, what is the use of him?” Cheng Deshu could make no reply. The other officers now began to hold this man of torrential speech in wholesome fear."
操與諸將商議破紹之策。程昱獻“十面埋伏”之計，勸操：“退軍於河上，伏兵十隊，誘紹追至河上；我軍無退路，必將死戰，可勝紹矣。”操然其計。左右各分五隊。左：一隊夏侯惇，二隊張遼，三隊李典，四隊樂進，五隊夏侯淵；右：一隊曹洪，二隊張郃，三隊徐晃，四隊于禁，五隊高覽。中軍許褚為先鋒。次日，十隊先進，埋伏左右已定。至半夜，操令許褚引兵前進，偽作劫寨之勢。袁紹五寨人馬，一齊俱起。許褚回軍便走。袁紹引軍趕來，喊聲不絕；比及天明，趕至河上，曹軍無去路。操大呼曰：“前無去路，諸軍何不死戰？”衆軍回身奮力向前。許褚飛馬當先，力斬十數將。袁軍大亂。袁紹退軍急回，背後曹軍趕來。正行間，一聲鼓響，左邊夏侯淵，右邊高覽，兩軍衝出。袁紹聚三子一甥，死衝血路奔走。又行不到十里，左邊樂進，右邊于禁殺出，殺得袁軍屍橫遍野，血流成渠。又行不到數里，左邊李典，右邊徐晃，兩軍截殺一陣。袁紹父子膽喪心驚，奔入舊寨，令三軍造飯。方欲待食，左邊張遼，右邊張郃，逕來衝寨。紹慌上馬，前奔倉亭；人馬困乏，欲待歇息，後面曹操大軍趕來，袁紹捨命而走。正行之間，右邊曹洪，左邊夏侯惇，擋住去路。紹大呼曰：“若不決死戰，必為所擒矣！”奮力衝突，得脫重圍。袁熙、高幹皆被箭傷。軍馬死亡殆盡。紹抱三子痛哭一場，不覺昏倒。衆人急救，紹口吐鮮血不止，歎曰：“吾自歷戰數十場，不意今日狼狽至此！此天喪吾也！汝等各回本州，誓與曹賊一決雌雄！”便敎辛評、郭圖火急隨袁譚前往靑州整頓，恐曹操犯境；令袁熙仍回幽州，高幹仍回并州：各去收拾人馬，以備調用。袁紹引袁尚等入冀州養病，令尚與審配、逢紀暫掌軍事。,"Cao discussed with the generals the strategy of breaking Shao. Cheng Yu offered the plan of ""Ambush from All Sides"" and persuaded Cao: ""Retreat the army on the river, ambush ten troops, and lure Shao to chase after the river; our army has no way to retreat, and we will fight to the death, and we can defeat Shao."" There are five teams on each side. Left: Team 1 Xiahou Dun, Team 2 Zhang Liao, Team 3 Li Dian, Team 4 Le Jin, Team 5 Xiahou Yuan; Right: Team 1 Cao Hong, Team 2 Zhang He, Team 3 Xu Huang, Team 4 Yujing, Team 5 Gao Lan. The Chinese army Xu Chu was the vanguard. The next day, the ten teams advanced, and the ambush was set. In the middle of the night, Xu Chu was ordered to lead his troops forward, pretending to be a robbery. Yuan Shao's troops from the five villages rose together. Xu Chu returned to the army and left. Yuan Shao led the army to come, shouting incessantly; as soon as Tianming, rushed to the river, Cao's army had nowhere to go. Cao shouted: ""There is no way forward, why don't the troops fight to the death?"" The troops turned around and pushed forward. Xu Chu took the lead in flying horses and cut dozens of generals with all his might. Yuan Jun was in chaos. Yuan Shao retreated and rushed back, but Cao's army came from behind. In the middle of the line, a drum sounded, Xiahou Yuan on the left, Gao Lan on the right, the two armies rushed out. Yuan Shao gathered his three sons and one nephew, and ran for blood. After less than ten miles, Le Jin on the left and Yu Jin on the right rushed out, killing Yuan Jun's corpse everywhere and bleeding into a canal. After walking for less than a few miles, Li Dian on the left and Xu Huang on the right, the two armies intercepted for a while. Frightened, Yuan Shao and his son rushed into the old village and ordered the three armies to make meals. Fang wanted to eat, Zhang Liao on the left and Zhang He on the right came to Chongzhai. Shao got on his horse in a panic, and ran to Cang Ting in front; the men and horses were tired and wanted to rest, but Cao Cao's army came from behind, and Yuan Shao gave up his life and left. In the middle of the road, Cao Hong on the right and Xiahou Dun on the left blocked the way. Shao shouted, ""If you don't fight to the death, you will be captured!"" Yuan Xi and Gao Gan were both wounded by arrows. The horses were all dead. Shao hugged the third son and cried bitterly, and passed out unconsciously. Everyone rushed to the first aid, and Shaokou vomited blood and sighed: ""I have fought dozens of battles, but I am so embarrassed today! I am also mourning this day! You all return to your own prefecture, and swear to fight against Cao thief!"" , Guo Tuhuo hurriedly followed Yuan Tan to Xizhou for rectification, fearing that Cao Cao would violate the border; order Yuan Xi to return to Youzhou, and senior officials to return to Bingzhou: each went to pack up his troops in preparation for the call. Yuan Shao brought Yuan Shang and others into Jizhou to recuperate, and ordered Shang to be with Shen Pei and Feng Ji to temporarily take charge of the military.","Frustrated by this, Cao Cao and his advisers plan to use a complex set of ambushes – no less than ten in total – to fool and then destroy Yuan Shao’s army. They will attack at midnight and draw the enemy into a series of ambushes. Central to this is that most of Cao Cao’s men will end up backed up against the river. The plan works well, and as dawn rises Cao Cao shouts to his men who are backed up against the river, ‘There’s no way out of here! Let every man fight to save his life!’ With desperate energy, his men surge forward. As Yuan Shao falls back, ambush after ambush springs into action to confront him.","When he had returned to camp, Cao Cao took counsel to find a plan to overcome Yuan Shao. Then Cheng Yu proposed the plan of the “Ten Ambushes” and persuaded Cao Cao to retire upon the river, placing troops in ambush as he went. Thus would Yuan Shao be inveigled into pursuit as far as the river, when Cao Cao's army would be forced to make a desperate stand or be driven into the water. Cao Cao accepted this suggestion and told off ten companies of five thousand soldiers each to lie in ten ambush on two sides of the road of retreat. The arrangement of the ambushes were thus: on the left, first company under Xiahou Dun; second company, Zhang Liao; third company, Li Dian; fourth company, Yue Jin; fifth company, Xiahou Yuan; on the right, first company was under Cao Hong; second company, Zhang He; third company, Xu Huang; fourth company, Yu Jin; fifth company, Gao Lan. Xu Chu commanded the advanced front. Next day the ten companies started first and placed themselves right and left as ordered. In the night Cao Cao ordered the advanced front to feign an attack on the camp, which roused all the enemy in all their camps. This done, Xu Chu retreated and Yuan Shao's army came in pursuit. The roar of battle went on without cessation, and at dawn Cao Cao's army rested on the river and could retreat no farther. Then Cao Cao shouted, “There is no road in front, so all must fight or die.” The retreating army turned about and advanced vigorously. Xu Chu simply flew to the front, smote and killed ten generals and threw Yuan Shao's army into confusion. They tried to turn and march back, but Cao Cao was close behind. Then the drums of the enemy were heard, and right and left there appeared two ambush companies of Gao Lan and Xiahou Yuan. Yuan Shao collected about him his three sons and his nephew, and they were enabled to cut an arterial alley out and flee. Three miles further on they fell into another ambush of Yue Jin and Yu Jin, and here many troops of Yuan Shao were lost so that their corpses lay over the countryside and the blood filled the water courses. Another three miles and they met the third pair of Li Dian and Xu Huang barring their road. Here they lost heart and bolted for an old camp of their own that was near, and bade their men prepare a meal. But just as the food was ready to eat, down came Zhang Liao and Zhang He and burst into the camp. Yuan Shao mounted and fled as far as Cangting, when he was tired and his steed spent. But there was no rest, for Cao Cao came in close pursuit. It seemed now a race for life. But presently Yuan Shao found his onward course again blocked by Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong, and he groaned aloud. “If we do not make most desperate efforts, we are all captives,” said he. And they plunged forward. His second son Yuan Xi and his nephew Gao Gan were wounded by arrows, and most of his soldiers were dead or had disappeared. He gathered his sons into his arms and wept bitterly. Then he fell into a swoon. He was picked up, but his mouth was full of blood which ran forth in a bright scarlet stream. He sighed, saying, “Many battles have I fought, and little did I think to be driven to this. Heaven is afflicting me. You would better return each to his own and swear to fight this Cao Cao to the end.” Then Yuan Shao bade Xin Ping and Guo Tu as quickly as possible follow Yuan Tan to Qingzhou and prepare to give battle to Cao Cao lest he should invade. Yuan Xi was told to go to Youzhou and Gao Gan to Bingzhou. So each started to prepare armies and horses for repulsing Cao Cao. Yuan Shao with his youngest son Yuan Shang and the remnant of his officers went away to Jizhou, and military operations were suspended for a time."
趙雲當下殺透重圍，已離大陣，血滿征袍。正行間，山坡下又撞出兩枝軍，乃夏侯惇部將鍾縉、鍾紳兄弟二人，一個使大斧，一個使畫戟，大喝：“趙雲快下馬受縛！”正是：,"Zhao Yun has now completely defeated the siege, and has left the great formation, full of blood. On the way, two more troops crashed out from the hillside. It was Xiahou Dun's generals Zhong Jin and Zhong Shen, two brothers, one with a big axe and the other with a painted halberd, shouting, ""Zhao Yun, get off his horse and be bound!""","The dead lie all around him as he battles on until suddenly his way is blocked by troops led by the brothers Zhong, one armed with a huge axe and the other with a massive halberd.","Having thus fought his way out of the press, Zhao Yun lost no time in getting away from the battle field. His white battle robe was soaked in blood. On his way, near the rise of the hills, he met with two other bodies of troops under two brothers, Zhong Jin and Zhong Shen. One of these was armed with a massive ax, the other a halberd. As soon as they saw Zhao Yun, they knew him and shouted, “Quickly dismount and be bound!”"

却說孫策看了半晌，方始回馬。正行過嶺，只聽得嶺上叫：“孫策休走！”策回頭視之，見兩匹馬飛下嶺來。策將十三騎一齊擺開。策橫鎗立馬於嶺下待之。太史慈高叫曰：“那個是孫策？”策曰：“你是何人？”答曰：“我便是東萊太史慈也，特來捉孫策！”策笑曰：“只我便是。你兩個一齊來併我一個，我不懼你！我若怕你，非孫伯符也！”慈曰：“你便衆人都來，我亦不怕！”縱馬橫鎗，直取孫策。策挺鎗來迎。兩馬相交，戰五十合，不分勝負。程普等暗暗稱奇。慈見孫策鎗法無半點兒滲漏，乃佯輸詐敗，引孫策趕來。慈却不由舊路上嶺，竟轉過山背後。策趕到，大喝曰：“走的不算好漢！”慈心中自忖：“這廝有十二從人，我只一個，便活捉了他，也喫衆人奪去。再引一程，敎這廝沒尋處，方好下手。”於是且戰且走。策那裏肯捨，一直趕到平川之地。慈兜回馬再戰，又到五十合。策一鎗搠去，慈閃過，挾住鎗；慈也一鎗搠去，策亦閃過，挾住鎗。兩個用力只一拖，都滾下馬來。馬不知走的那裏去了。兩個棄了鎗，揪住廝打，戰袍扯得粉碎。策手快，掣了太史慈背上的短戟，慈亦掣了策頭上的兜鍪。策把戟來刺慈，慈把兜鍪遮架。忽然喊聲後起，乃劉繇接應軍到來，約有千餘。策正慌急，程普等十二騎亦衝到，策與慈方纔放手。慈於軍中討了一匹馬，取了鎗，上馬復來。孫策的馬，却是程普收得，策亦取鎗上馬。劉繇一千餘軍，和程普等十二騎混戰，逶迤殺到神亭嶺下。喊聲起處，周瑜領軍來到。劉繇自引大軍殺下嶺來。時近黃昏，風雨暴至，兩下各自收軍。,"But he said that Sun Ce watched for a long time before Fang Shi returned to the horse. As he was crossing the ridge, he heard a call from the top of the ridge: ""Sun Cexiu, leave!"" Ce looked back and saw two horses flying down the ridge. Ce put the thirteen cavalry aside together. Ce Henggun immediately waited for him at the foot of the mountain. Taishi Ci shouted loudly, ""That's Sun Ce?"" Ce said, ""Who are you?"" He replied, ""I am Taishi Ci of Donglai, and I came here to arrest Sun Ce!"" Ce laughed and said, ""I am the only one. You two come together and I am one, I am not afraid of you! If I am afraid of you, it is not Sun Bofu!"" Ci said: ""If you all come, I am not afraid!"" Ce Ting the gun to welcome. The two horses cross each other, and the battle is fifty-fifty, and there is no winner or loser. Cheng Pu and others were secretly surprised. Seeing that Sun Ce's marksmanship was not leaking in the slightest, Ci pretended to lose and cheated and led Sun Ce to come. Ci, however, couldn't help the old road, and turned around behind the mountain. Ce arrived and shouted loudly, ""You're not a good man!"" Ci thought to herself, ""This fellow has twelve servants, and I only have one, so I captured him alive and plundered them. Teach this fellow to have nowhere to go, so it's better to start."" So he fought and walked away. Tsingli Kenshe, has been rushed to the land of Pingchuan. Cidou returned to his horse to fight again, and it was fifty-five again. Ce took a gun away, Ci flashed past, holding the gun; Ci also took a gun away, and Ci flashed past, holding the gun. The two dragged with only one force, and both rolled off the horse. The horse did not know where to go. The two abandoned their guns, grabbed and fought, and their shirts were torn to shreds. With quick hands, he grabbed the short halberd on Taishi Ci's back, and Ci also grabbed the pocket on Ce's head. The halberd came to stab Ci, and Ci covered the frame with the pocket. Suddenly, after the shouting, it was Liu Yao who received the arrival of the army, about a thousand or so. Ce was in a hurry, Cheng Pu and the other twelve cavalry also rushed over, and Ce and Ci just let go. Ci Yu asked for a horse in the army, took a gun, and got on the horse to come back. Sun Ce's horse was received by Cheng Pu, and Ce also took a gun and mounted it. Liu Yao's army of more than 1,000, and Cheng Pu and other twelve cavalrymen fought meleely, and slaughtered to the foot of Shenting Ridge. At the beginning of the shout, Zhou Yu led the army. Liu Yao led a large army to kill him. When it was almost dusk, the storm came, and the two retreated their troops.","Ignoring Liu Yao’s pleas to stop, and with only one other, rather minor commander joining him, Taishi Ci rides out to fight Sun Ce.","Now having seen all he wished, Sun Ce thought it time to return and wheeled round his horse. But when he was going over the summit, some one shouted, “Stay, Sun Ce!” Sun Ce turned; two horsemen were coming at full speed down the next hill. Sun Ce halted and drew up his little escort right and left, he himself with his spear ready. “Which is Sun Ce?” shouted Taishi Ci. “Who are you?” was the reply. “I, Taishi Ci of Laihuang, come to take him prisoner.” “Then I am he,” said Sun Ce, laughing. “Come both of you together; I am not afraid of you. If I were, I should not be Sun Ce.” “You and all your crowd come on and I will not blench,” cried Taishi Ci putting his horse at a gallop and setting his spear. Sun Ce braced himself for the shock and the battle began. Fifty bouts were fought and still neither combatant had the advantage. Sun Ce's commanders whispered to each other their admiration and amazement. Taishi Ci saw that the spearmanship of his opponent showed no weak point whereby he could gain the advantage, so he decided to resort to guile. Feigning defeat he would lead Sun Ce to pursue. Taishi Ci however did not retire along the road by which he had come, but took a path leading around the hill instead of over it. His antagonist followed, shouting, “He who retreats is no worthy soldier!” But Taishi Ci thought within himself, “He has twelve others at his back and I only one. If I capture him, the others will retake him. I will inveigle him into some secret spot and then try.” So flying and fighting by turns he led Sun Ce, an eager pursuer, down to the plain. Here Taishi Ci suddenly wheeled about and attacked. Again they exchanged half a hundred bouts, without result. Then Sun Ce made a fierce thrust, which his opponent evaded by gripping the spear under his arm, while he himself did the same with his opponent's spear. Neither was wounded but each exerting his utmost strength to pull the other out of the saddle they both came to the ground. Their steeds galloped off they knew not whither, while the two men, each dropping his spear, began a hand to hand struggle. Soon their fighting robes were in tatters. Sun Ce gripped the short lance that Taishi Ci carried at his back, while Taishi Ci tore off the Sun Ce's helmet. Sun Ce tried to stab with the short lance but Taishi Ci fended off the blow with the helmet as a shield. Then arose a great shouting. Liu Yao had come up with a thousand soldiers. Sun Ce seemed now in sore straits. His twelve followers came up, and each combatant let go his hold. Taishi Ci quickly found another steed, seized a spear, and mounted. Sun Ce, whose horse had been caught by Cheng Pu, also mounted, and a confused battle began between the handful of men on one side and a whole thousand troops on the other. It swayed and drifted down the hill side. However, soon Zhou Yu leading his troops came to the rescue, and as evening drew on a tempest put an end to the fight. Both sides drew off and returned to camp."
卓按劍立於園門，忽見一人躍馬持戟，於園門外往來馳驟。卓問李儒：“此何人也？”儒曰：“此丁原義兒：姓呂，名布，字奉先者也。主公且須避之。”卓乃入園潛避。次日，人報丁原引軍城外搦戰。卓怒，引軍同李儒出迎。兩陣對圓，只見呂布頂束髮金冠，披百花戰袍，擐唐猊鎧甲，繫獅蠻寶帶，縱馬挺戟，隨丁建陽出到陣前。建陽指卓罵曰：“國家不幸，閹官弄權，以致萬民塗炭。爾無尺寸之功，焉敢妄言廢立，欲亂朝廷？”董卓未及回言，呂布飛馬直殺過來。董卓慌走，建陽率軍掩殺。卓兵大敗，退三十餘里下寨，聚衆商議。卓曰：“吾觀呂布非常人也。吾若得此人，何慮天下哉！”帳前一人出曰：“主公勿憂：某與呂布同鄕，知其勇而無謀，見利忘義。某憑三寸不爛之舌，說呂布拱手來降，可乎？”卓大喜，觀其人，乃虎賁中郎將李肅也。卓曰：“汝將何以說之？”肅曰：“某聞主公有名馬一匹，號曰‘赤兔’，日行千里。須得此馬，再用金珠，以利結其心。某更進說詞，呂布必反丁原，來投主公矣。”卓問李儒曰：“此言可乎？”儒曰：“主公欲取天下，何惜一馬？”卓欣然與之，更與黃金一千兩、明珠數十顆、玉帶一條。,"Zhuo pressed his sword and stood at the gate of the garden, when suddenly he saw a man jumping on a horse with a halberd, galloping to and fro outside the gate of the garden. Zhuo asked Li Ru, ""Who is this person?"" Ru said: ""This Ding Yuanyi'er: surnamed Lu, given name Bu, and the style is Feng Xian. The lord must avoid him."" Zhuo Nai entered the garden to hide. The next day, it was reported that Ding Yuan led the army to fight outside the city. Zhuo anger, led the army to meet Li Ru. The two formations were facing each other, only to see Lu Bu wearing a golden crown on top, wearing a shirt of hundreds of flowers, wearing Tang Yi's armor, wearing a lion and savage belt, riding a horse with a halberd, and followed Ding Jianyang to the front of the formation. Jianyang pointed at Zhuo and scolded: ""The country is unfortunate. Dong Zhuo panicked, and Jianyang led his army to cover up. Zhuo Bing was defeated and retreated more than 30 li to the village, and gathered a crowd to discuss. Zhuo said: ""I think Lv Bu is very human. If I get this person, why should I worry about the world!"" A person in front of the tent said: ""Master, don't worry: a certain person is with Lv Bu. Knowing that he is brave but has no plans, he will forget his righteousness when he sees profit. With a tongue that is not rotten three inches, is it true that Lu Bu is coming down with his hands?"" Zhuo was overjoyed, watching him, it was Li Su, the general of the tiger Benzhong Lang. Zhuo said: ""Why do you say it?"" Su said: ""I heard that the lord has a famous horse, called 'Red Rabbit', which travels thousands of miles a day. You must obtain this horse, and then use gold beads to facilitate his heart. A certain more advanced speech, Lv Bu will turn against Ding Yuan and come to vote for the lord."" Zhuo asked Li Ru, ""Is this true?"" Confucian said: ""If the lord wants to take over the world, why would you regret a horse?"" Zhuo Xinran followed him , and one thousand taels of gold, dozens of pearls, and a jade belt.","Ding Yuan has drawn up his troops outside the city, and Dong Zhuo leads out his men to do battle. Facing him in Ding Yuan’s army is a young man called Lü Bu. He has a golden crown in his hair and is wearing a fabulously coloured robe; his sword is decorated with lions and snakes. As soon as the armies meet, Lü Bu charges straight at Dong Zhuo, and Dong Zhuo turns and runs.","Dong Zhuo stood at the gate with drawn sword watching them depart. Standing thus, Dong Zhuo noticed a spearman galloping to and fro on a fiery steed and asked Li Ru who that was. “That is Lu Bu, the adopted son of Ding Yuan. You must keep out of his way, my lord.” Dong Zhuo went inside the gate so that he could not be seen. But next day a man reported to him that Ding Yuan had come out of the city with a small army and was challenging to a battle. Dong Zhuo, with his army, went forth to accept the challenge. And the two armies were drawn up in proper array. Lu Bu was a conspicuous figure in the forefront. His hair was arranged under a handsome headdress of gold, and he had donned a embroidered thousand-flower fighting robe, a pheasant-tailed helmet, and breast plate, and round his waist was a gleaming jade belt with a lion's head clasp. With spear set he rode close behind his master Ding Yuan. Ding Yuan, riding forth, pointing his finger at Dong Zhuo, began to revile him. “Unhappy indeed was this state when the eunuchs became so powerful that the people were as if trodden into the mire under their feet. Now you, devoid of the least merit, dare to talk of deposing the rightful emperor and setting up another. This is to desire rebellion and no less.” Dong Zhuo could not reply for Lu Bu, eager for the fight, rode straight at him. Dong Zhuo fled and Ding Yuan's army came on. The battle went in Ding Yuan's favor, and the beaten troops retired ten miles and made another camp. Here Dong Zhuo called his officers to a council. “This Lu Bu is a marvel,” said Dong Zhuo. “If he were only on my side, I would defy the whole world.” At this a man advanced saying, “Be content, O my lord! I am a fellow villager of his and know him well, his bravery, his prowess, his cupidity, and his unscrupulousness. With this little, blarneying tongue of mine, I can persuade him to put up his hands and come over to your side.” Dong Zhuo was delighted and gazed admiringly at the speaker. It was Li Su, a general in the Imperial Tiger Army. “What arguments will you use with him?” asked Dong Zhuo. “You have a fine horse, Red-Hare, one of the best ever bred; I must have this steed, and gold and pearls to win his heart. Then will I go and persuade him. He will certainly abandon Ding Yuan's service for yours.” “What think you?” said Dong Zhuo to his adviser Li Ru. “One cannot grudge a horse to win an empire,” was the reply. So they grave Li Su what he demanded—a thousand ounces of gold, ten strings of beautiful pearls, a jeweled belt, and Red-Hare—and these accompanied Li Su on his visit to his fellow villager."

李傕抱頭鼠竄，回見董卓，說孫堅如此無禮。卓怒，問李儒。儒曰：“温侯新敗，兵無戰心。不若引兵回洛陽，遷帝於長安，以應童謠。近日街市童謠曰：‘西頭一個漢，東頭一個漢。鹿走入長安，方可無斯難。’臣思此言，‘西頭一個漢’，乃應高祖旺於西都長安，傳一十二帝；‘東頭一個漢’，乃應光武旺於東都洛陽，今亦傳一十二帝。天運合回，丞相遷回長安，方可無虞。”卓大喜曰：“非汝言，吾實不悟。”遂引呂布星夜回洛陽，商議遷都。聚文武於朝堂，卓曰：“漢東都洛陽，二百餘年，氣數已衰。吾觀旺氣實在長安，吾欲奉駕西幸。汝等各宜促裝。”司徒楊彪曰：“關中殘破零落。今無故捐宗廟，棄皇陵，恐百姓驚動。天下動之至易，安之至難：望丞相鋻察。”卓怒曰：“汝阻國家大計耶？”太尉黃琬曰：“楊司徒之言是也：往者王莽篡逆，更始赤眉之時，焚燒長安，盡為瓦礫之地；更兼人民流移，百無一二；今棄宮室而就荒地，非所宜也。”卓曰：“關東賊起，天下播亂；長安有崤、函之險；更近隴右，木石磚瓦，尅日可辦，宮室營造，不須月餘。汝等再休亂言。”司徒荀爽諫曰：“丞相若欲遷都，百姓騷動不寧矣。”卓大怒曰：“吾為天下計，豈惜小民哉！”卽日罷楊彪、黃琬、荀爽為庶民。卓出上車，只見二人望車而揖；視之，乃尚書周毖、城門校尉伍瓊也。卓問有何事，毖曰：“今聞丞相欲遷都長安，故來諫耳。”卓大怒曰：“我始初聽你兩個，保用袁紹；今紹已反，是汝等一黨！”叱武士推出都門斬首。遂下令遷都，限來日便行。李儒曰：“今錢糧缺少，洛陽富戶極多，可籍沒入官。但是袁紹等門下，殺其宗黨而抄其家貲，必得巨萬。”,"Li Jue ran away with his head in his arms and returned to see Dong Zhuo, saying that Sun Jian was so rude. Zhuo was angry and asked Li Ru. Confucian Confucianism said: ""Wen Hou is newly defeated, and the soldiers are not willing to fight. It is better to lead the troops back to Luoyang and move the emperor to Chang'an to respond to the nursery rhyme. Recently, the nursery rhyme in the market said: 'There is a Han in the west, and a Han in the east. The deer enter Chang'an. , then there will be no such difficulties.' Chen Si's words, 'the west is a Han', should be the emperor's prosperity in Chang'an, the western capital, and the twelve emperors; Today there are also 12 emperors. When the fortunes of the heavens come together, the prime minister will move back to Chang'an, and then there will be no worries."" Zhuo Daxi said, ""It's not what you said, I don't understand the truth."" He then led Lv Bu Xingye back to Luoyang to discuss moving the capital. Gathering Wenwu in the Chaotang, Zhuo said, ""Luoyang, the capital of the Eastern Han Dynasty, has been in decline for more than two hundred years. I believe that the vitality is really strong in Chang'an. Scattered. Now I donate the ancestral temple and abandon the imperial mausoleum for no reason. I am afraid that the people will be disturbed. It is extremely easy for the world to move, but it is extremely difficult to settle down: I hope that the prime minister will investigate."" Zhuo anger said: ""Are you blocking the country's big plans?"" Taiwei Huang Wan said: "" Yang Situ's words are also true: In the past, Wang Mang usurped the rebellion, and when the Gengshi was red-browed, he burned Chang'an and turned it into a rubble; moreover, the people were displaced, and there was no one or two; it is not appropriate to abandon the palace and go to wasteland. Zhuo said: ""Kwantung thieves rise and the world spreads chaos; Chang'an has the danger of Wei and Han; closer to Longyou, wood, stone and bricks can be done in a few days, and palace construction does not need more than a month. You will stop talking nonsense. Situ Xun Shuang admonished: ""If the prime minister wants to move the capital, the people will be in turmoil."" Zhuo was furious and said, ""I plan for the world, so I don't care about the small people!"" common people. Zhuo went out and got into the car, only to see the two of them looking at the car and bowing; looking at them, it was Shang Shu Zhou Yu and Chengmen school captain Wu Qiong. Zhuo asked what was going on, and Yu said: ""I heard that the Prime Minister wants to move the capital to Chang'an, so I came to give advice."" Zhuo was furious and said, ""I listened to you two at first and kept Yuan Shao; !"" The samurai pushed out the capital and beheaded. Then he ordered the relocation of the capital, which was limited to the next day. Li Ru said: ""Today there is a shortage of money and food, and there are many wealthy households in Luoyang, but they can't be admitted to the officialdom. But Yuan Shao and others, killing their clan and looting their wealth, will surely get a huge amount.""","Li Jue sees that his plan is bound to fail and he escapes and returns to Dong Zhuo with the bad news. The disaster at the pass coupled with Sun Jian’s rejection so infuriates Dong Zhuo that it sends him spiralling into depression. His adviser Li Ru comes up with an outrageous plan. He bases it on a children’s ditty that is being sung at the time. The ditty goes like this: There first was a Han in the west, Then a Han over there in the east. If the deer flees to Chang’an, He’ll find he’s able to breathe without distress. Li Ru interprets this as follows: ‘The Han in the west was the original dynasty founded by the Supreme Ancestor, where twelve emperors reigned in Chang’an. The Han in the east refers to the twelve emperors who came after Guang Wu, the emperor who moved the capital to Luoyang. Now the cycle of Heaven has come full circle, and the court should return to Chang’an, and then there will be nothing to fear.’ And so Dong Zhuo decides to move the capital to Chang’an. Summoning all the officials, he announces that after two centuries of rule in Luoyang the imperial family have been drained of inspiration and drive, but by moving them to Chang’an this can be revived. Some oppose him, including two officers who try to stop him as he leaves the city gate. For their temerity in opposing him he has them beheaded there and then. Li Ru is aware of how much money will be needed to rebuild the virtually deserted Chang’an, left desolate after a rebellion two hundred years ago. Li Ru therefore proposes the following. ‘Anyone in Luoyang we can associate with the rebel Yuan Shao will be rich, so let’s kill them and take their goods.’","Li Jue threw his arms over his head and ran out. He returned to his master and told him what a rude reception he had met with. Dong Zhuo asked his adviser Li Ru how to reply to this. Li Ru said, “Lu Bu's late defeat had somewhat blunted the edge of our army's desire for battle. It would be well to return to the capital and remove the Emperor to Changan, as the street children had been lately singing: “A Han on the west, a Han on the east. The deer ((the Throne)) will be safe in Changan.” Li Ru continued, “If you think out this couplet, it applies to the present juncture. Half the first line refers to the founder of the dynasty, Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor, who became ruler in the western city of Changan, which was the capital during twelve reigns. The other half corresponds to Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder who ruled from Luoyang, the eastern capital during twelve latter reigns. The revolution of the heavens brings us back to this starting moment. Thus if you remove to Changan, there will be no need for anxiety.” Dong Zhuo was exceedingly pleased and said, “Had you not spoken thus, I should not have understood!” Then taking Lu Bu with him, Dong Zhuo started at once for Capital Luoyang. Here he called all the officials to a great council in the palace and addressed them, “After two centuries of rule here the royal fortune has been exhausted, and I perceive that the aura of rule has migrated to Changan, whither I now desire to move the court. All you would better pack up for the journey.” Yang Biao, Minister of the Interior, said, “I pray you reflect. Within that city all is destruction. There is no reason to renounce the ancestral temples and abandon the imperial tombs here. I fear the people will be alarmed. It is easy to alarm them but difficult to pacify them.” “Do you oppose the state plans?” said Dong Zhuo angrily. Another official, Grand Commander Huang Wan, supported his colleague, “In the era of Recommencement (AD 23-25), Fan Chong of the Red Eyebrows rebels burned Changan to the ground and reduced the place to broken tiles. The inhabitants scattered all but a few. It is wrong to abandon these palaces here for a wasteland.” Dong Zhuo replied, “The East of the Pass is full of sedition, and all the empire is in rebellion. The city of Changan is protected by the Yaohan Mountains and the Hangu Pass. Moreover, it is near Longyou, whence can be easily brought timber, stone, brick, and building materials. In a month or so palaces can be erected. So an end to your wild words!” Yet Minister of Works Xun Shuang raised another protest against disturbing the people, but Dong Zhuo overbore him also. “How can I stop to consider a few common people when my scheme affects the empire?” said Dong Zhuo. That day the three objectors—Yang Biao, Huang Wan, and Xun Shuang—were removed from their offices and reduced to the rank of commoners. As Dong Zhuo went out to get into his coach, he met two other officers who made obeisance. They were the Secretary General, Zhou Bi, and the Commander of the City Gate, Wu Qiong. Dong Zhuo stopped and asked them what they wanted. Said Zhou Bi, “We venture to try to dissuade you from moving the capital to Changan.” Dong Zhuo replied, “They used to say you two were supporters of Yuan Shao; now he has already turned traitor and you are of the same party.” And without more ado he bade his guards take both outside the city and put them to death. The command to remove to the new capital immediately was issued. Speaking to Dong Zhuo, Li Ru pointed out, “We are short of money and food, and the rich people of Luoyang could be easily plundered. This is a good occasion to link them to the rebels and to confiscate their properties.”"

却說呂布勒兵到山下，李傕引軍搦戰。布忿怒衝殺過去，傕退走上山。山上矢石如雨，布軍不能進。忽報郭汜在陣後殺來，布急回戰。只聞鼓聲大震，汜軍已退。布方欲收軍，鑼聲響處，傕軍又來。未及對敵，背後郭汜又領軍殺到。及至呂布來時，却又擂鼓收軍去了，激得呂布怒氣填胸。一連如此幾日，欲戰不得，欲止不得。正在惱怒，忽然飛馬報來，說張濟、樊稠兩路軍馬，竟犯長安，京城危急。布急領軍回，背後李傕、郭汜殺來。布無心戀戰，只顧奔走，折了好些人馬。比及到長安城下，賊兵雲屯雨集，圍定城池，布軍與戰不利。軍士畏呂布暴厲，多有降賊者，布心甚憂。,"But they said that Lu Bule's troops had reached the foot of the mountain, and Li Jue led the troops to fight. Bu rushed over in anger and retreated up the mountain. The arrows and stones on the mountain were like rain, and the cloth army could not enter. He suddenly reported that Guo Si was coming from behind the formation, and Bu rushed back to fight. Only the sound of the drums shook and the Si army had retreated. The Bu side was about to withdraw the army, when the gong sounded, the Jue army came again. Before he could face the enemy, Guo Si led the army to kill him. When Lv Bu came, he beat the drums to withdraw the army, which made Lv Bu fill his chest with anger. For several days in a row, if you want to fight, you can't stop, and you can't stop. When he was angry, suddenly Pegasus reported that Zhang Ji and Fan Chou had invaded Chang'an and the capital was in danger. Bu Ji led the army back, and Li Jue and Guo Si came behind him. Bu was not in the mood to fight, he just ran around and broke a lot of people. Compared to the Chang'an city, the thieves gathered in the rain, surrounded the city, and it was not good for the army to fight. The sergeants were afraid of Lv Bu's violence, and there were many thieves, and Bu was very worried.","Lü Bu’s impetuous nature is exploited by Li Jue and Guo Si, who attack and then withdraw, then attack a again until Lü Bu is exhausted. He is still deep in the countryside, trying to chase the rebels, when word is brought to him that the capital itself is now under attack. He immediately turns his army around and heads as fast as possible to the capital. He cannot get through. The city is surrounded and besieged by the rebels. At the same time, an uprising takes place, led by Dong Zhuo’s surviving supporters inside the city itself.","As soon as Lu Bu reached the hills, a force of Li Jue came out to attack him. Lu Bu made an angry dash toward the enemy who retired up the hills, whence they shot arrows and hurled stones like rain. Lu Bu's troops halted. At this moment the report came that the rear was being attacked and there appeared Guo Si. At once Lu Bu wheeled toward the new enemy, but immediately the rolling drums gave the signal to retire, and Lu Bu could not come to blows with them. As he called in his army, the gongs clanged on the other side and his former opponent Li Jue came to attack his front. But before Lu Bu could join battle, his rear was again assaulted by Guo Si, who in his turn drew off immediately. Thus Lu Bu was baited till his bosom was near bursting with rage. The same tactics continued for several days. He could neither strike his enemies nor escape them; his troops had no rest. In the midst of these distracting maneuver, a messenger rode up in hot haste to report: “The capital is in imminent danger from a double attack of Fan Chou and Zhang Ji.” Lu Bu at once ordered a march to save the capital, which became a rout when both his opponents Li Jue and Guo Si came in pursuit. His loss was heavy. He soon reached Changan and found the rebels there in enormous numbers and the city quite surrounded. Lu Bu's attack had but little effect, and as his temper became more savage under defeat, many of his soldiers went over to the rebels. He fell into deep melancholy."
漢軍師中郎將諸葛亮，致書於東吳大都督公瑾先生麾下：亮自柴桑一別，至今戀戀不忘。聞足下欲取西川，亮竊以為不可。益州民強地險，劉璋雖闇弱，足以自守；今勞師遠征，轉運萬里，欲收全功，雖吳起不能定其規，孫武不能善其後也。曹操失利於赤壁，志豈須臾忘報讎哉？今足下興兵遠征，倘操乘虛而至，江南虀粉矣。亮不忍坐視，特此告知：幸垂照鑒。,"Zhuge Liang, the general of the Han military division, wrote to Mr. Gong Jin, the governor of the Eastern Wu Dynasty: Liang has never forgotten since Chai Sang parted. When he heard that he wanted to take Xichuan, Liang thought it was impossible. The people of Yizhou are strong and the land is dangerous. Although Liu Zhang is dark and weak, he is enough to defend himself. Today, the labors and teachers are on an expedition, traveling thousands of miles, and wanting to collect all the merits. Although Wu Qi can't set the rules, Sun Wu can't be good at it. Cao Cao's defeat at Chibi, should his ambition be forgotten for a moment? Today, I will start an expedition with a single step. If Cao Cao takes advantage of the empty space, I will be a fan of Jiangnan. Liang couldn't bear to sit back and watch, so I hereby inform: Xing Chui took a lesson.","For the danger he has put his own men in and the real risk that, if Zhou Yu did go off to conquer the western Riverlands, Cao Cao would use the opportunity to invade and destroy Wu. ‘I do wish,’ finishes the letter, ‘that you would be so kind as to pay attention to what I am saying and the real dangers you face.’","About this time a letter from Zhuge Liang arrived, which ran like this: “Since our parting at Chaisang I have thought of you often. Now comes to me a report that you desire to take the Western Land of Rivers, which I regret to say I consider impossible. The people there are strong, and the country is precipitous and defensible. Imperial Protector Liu Zhang may be weak within, but he is strong enough to defend himself. “Now indeed, General, you would go far and you would render great services, yet can any one foretell the final result? No; not even Wu Qi the Great General could say for certain, nor could Sun Zi the Famed Strategist be sure of a successful issue. Cao Cao suffered severe defeat at the Red Cliffs; think you he will ever cease to hope for revenge? Now if you undertake a long expedition, will he not seize the occasion to fall upon the South Land and grind it to powder? Such a deed would be more than I could bear, and I venture to warn you of the possible danger if haply you may condescend to regard it.”"

却說袁紹輸了一陣，堅守不出。兩軍相拒月餘，有人來長安報知董卓。李儒對卓曰：“袁紹與公孫瓚，亦當今豪傑。見在磐河廝殺，宜假天子之詔，差人往和解之。二人感德，必順太師矣。”卓曰：“善。”次日便使太傅馬日磾、太僕趙岐，齎詔前去。二人來至河北，紹出迎於百里之外，再拜奉詔。次日二人至瓚營宣諭，瓚乃遣使致書於紹，互相講和；二人自回京復命。瓚卽日班師，又表薦劉玄德為平原相。玄德與趙雲分別，執手垂淚，不忍相離。雲歎曰：“某曩日誤認公孫瓚為英雄；今觀所為，亦袁紹等輩耳！”玄德曰：“公且屈身事之，相見有日。”洒淚而別。,"But he said that Yuan Shao lost for a while and could not hold on. The two armies refused for more than a month, and someone came to Chang'an to report to Dong Zhuo. Li Ru said to Zhuo: ""Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan are also today's heroes. Seeing the fight in the Panhe River, it is advisable to fake the emperor's edict and send someone to reconcile them. If the two feel virtue, they will obey the master."" Zhuo said: ""Good ."" The next day, the Grand Master Ma Riju and Grand Servant Zhao Qi were ordered to go there. The two came to Hebei, Shao Chu greeted him a hundred miles away, and then bowed to the edict. The next day, the two went to Zan's camp to announce an edict, and Zan Nai sent an envoy to write to Shao to make peace with each other; the two returned to Beijing to resume their orders. The teacher of the Zanjiri class also recommended Liu Xuande as the prime minister of Pingyuan. Xuande and Zhao Yun parted, holding hands and weeping, unable to bear to be apart. Yun Tan said, ""A certain day, I mistakenly recognized Gongsun Zan as a hero; now I see what Yuan Shao and others have done!"" Xuande said, ""Gong, please bow down and do it, and see each other someday."" They said goodbye in tears.","The battles of the bridge result in a stand-off between the armies of Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan. It lasts for a month. Neither side giving way. Back in Chang’an, Li Ru hears about this and advises Dong Zhuo to mediate between Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan so that these two will once again be on Dong Zhuo’s side. This strategy is surprisingly successful, and the betrayal of their cause by the two leaders profoundly horrifies both Xuande and Zilong.","Yuan Shao had lost that battle, and Gongsun Zan would not risk another. They strengthened their defenses, and the armies lay inactive for over a month. In the meantime news of the fighting had reached Capital Changan, and Dong Zhuo was told. His adviser, Li Ru, went to see his master and said, “The two active leaders of today are Yuan Shao and Gongsun Zan, who are at grips at River Pan. Pretend you have an imperial command to make peace between them, and both will support you out of gratitude for your intervention.” “Good!” said Dong Zhuo. So he sent the Imperial Guardian, Ma Midi, and the Minister of the Palace Bureau, Zhao Qi, on the mission. When these men were arriving the North of Yellow River, Yuan Shao sent out to welcome them thirty miles from his headquarters and received the imperial command with the greatest respect. Then the two officers went to Gongsun Zan and made known their errand. Gongsun Zan sent letters to his adversary proposing friendship. The two emissaries returned to report their task accomplished. Gongsun Zan drew off his army. He also sent up a memorial eulogizing Liu Bei, who was raised to the rank of Governor of Pingyuan. The farewell between Liu Bei and Zhao Yun was affecting. They held each other's hands a long time, their eyes streaming with tears, and could not tear themselves apart. Zhao Yun said with a sob, “I used to think Gongsun Zan a true hero, but 1 see now that he is no different from Yuan Shao. They are both alike.” “But you are now in his service; we shall surely meet again,” said Liu Bei. Both men wept freely as they separated."

That night in the Tumen Pavilion, I saw no lights outside the city. Pei said: ""Feng Li will definitely lead his troops to enter through the tunnel."" He urgently called elite soldiers to transport stones to attack the gate; After this battle was broken, he gave up his strategy and retreated above the Huan River to wait for Yuan Shang's return. Yuan Shang attacked the plains and heard that Cao Cao had defeated Yin Kai and Juhu, and the army besieged Jizhou, so he ordered his troops to rescue him. The commander Ma Yan said: ""Going from the main road, Cao Cao must have an ambush; you can take the small road and go out from the Fushuikou from the Xishan to rob Cao's camp, and the siege will be relieved."" after the break. I have already done detailed work to report to Cao Cao. Cao said: ""If he comes from the main road, I should avoid him; if he comes from the Xishan small road, he can be captured in a battle. I think Yuan Shang will raise fire as a sign and order the city to respond. I can divide my troops to attack him."" Dial is set.",Cities fall and armies are routed until once again Cao Cao stands before the closed gates of Jizhou.,"After Feng Li had deserted to the enemy, Shen Pei went every night to the wall to inspect the soldiers on duty. The night of the sapping he went there as usual and saw that there were no lights outside the city and all was perfectly quiet. So he said to himself, “Feng Li is certain to try to come into the city by an underground road.” Whereupon he ordered his troops to bring up stones and pile them on the cover of the tunnel opening. The opening was stopped up and the attacking party perished in the tunnel they had excavated. Cao Cao having failed in this attempt abandoned the scheme of underground attack. He drew off the army to a place above the River Huan to await till Yuan Shang should return to relieve the city. Yuan Shang heard of the defeat of Yin Kai and Ju Gu, and the siege of his own city, and bethought himself of relieving it. One of his commanders, Ma Yan, said, “The high road will surely be ambushed; we must find some other way. We can take a by-road from the Western Hills and get through by River Fu, whence we can fall upon Cao Cao's camp.” The plan was acceptable and Yuan Shang started off with the main body, Ma Yan and Zhang Yi being rear guard. Cao Cao's spies soon found out this move, and when they reported it, he said, “If Yuan Shang comes by the high road, I shall have to keep out of the way; if by the Western Hills' by-road, I can settle him in one battle. And I think he will show a blaze as a signal to the besieged that they may make a sortie. I shall prepare to attack both.” So Cao Cao made his preparations."

Long ago, there was a report on the horse to inform Zhao Fan, the prefect of Guiyang. Fan Ji gathered the crowd to discuss. Guanjun Colonel Chen Ying and Bao Long are willing to lead the troops into battle. It turned out that the two were both hunters in Guiyang Mountains: Chen Ying made a flying fork, and Bao Long shot Shuanghu. The two of them relied on their own courage, and said to Zhao Fan: ""If Liu Bei comes, a certain two people would like to be the front."" Zhao Fan said: ""I heard that Liu Xuande is the uncle of the great Han emperor; Zhao Zilong, who is leading the troops, is like no one among the millions of troops in Changban, Dangyang. How many men can I have in Guiyang? I cannot meet the enemy, but surrender."" Ying said, ""A certain person, please go out to battle. If Zhao Yun cannot be captured. At that time, it would not be too late for the prefect to surrender."" Zhao Fan could not but agree.","As Zilong advances upon Guiyang, the governor, Zhao Fan, knowing his reputation, decides to surrender. However, a young firebrand, Chen Ying, argues that he should be allowed to at least try to defend the city, pointing out that, if he fails, the governor can always surrender afterwards.","With his three thousand troops, Zhao Yun took the road to Guiyang. The Governor, Zhao Fan, soon heard of his approach and hastily called his officers to take counsel. Two of them, Chen Ying and Bao Long, offered to meet the invaders and turn them back. These two warriors belonged to Guiyang and had made themselves famous as hunters. Chen Ying used a “Flying Fork,” and Bao Long could draw a bow with such force that he had been known to send an arrow through two tigers. So strong were they, as well as bold. They stood before Zhao Fan and said, “We will lead the way against Liu Bei.” The Governor replied, “I know that Liu Bei is of the imperial family, and Zhuge Liang is exceedingly resourceful. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are very bold. But the commander of this force is Zhao Yun who, on one occasion, faced a hundred legions of Cao Cao and never blenched. Our small force here cannot stand against such people. We shall have to yield.” “Let me go out to fight,” said Chen Ying. “If I cannot capture Zhao Yun, then you can yield.” The Governor could not resist him and gave his consent."
承辭操歸家，至夜獨坐書院中，將袍仔細反覆看了，並無一物。承思曰：“天子賜我袍帶，命我細觀，必非無意；今不見甚蹤跡，何也？”隨又取玉帶檢看，乃白玉玲瓏，碾成小龍穿花，背用紫錦為襯，縫綴端整，亦並無一物。承心疑，放於桌上，反覆尋之。良久，倦甚。正欲伏几而寢，忽然燈花落於帶上，燒着背襯。承驚拭之，已燒破一處，微露素絹，隱見血跡。急取刀拆開視之，乃天子手書血字密詔也。詔曰：,"Cheng Cicao returned home, sat alone in the academy at night, and carefully and repeatedly looked at the robe, and found nothing. Cheng Si said, ""The Son of Heaven gave me the robe and ordered me to look closely. It must not have been unintentional; there are no traces of it now, why?"" Then he took the jade belt to examine it, and it was exquisite white jade, crushed into a small dragon wearing flowers, and the back was made of purple brocade. For the lining, the stitching ends are neat, and there is nothing. Suspicious, put it on the table and searched for it again and again. For a long time, very tired. Just as he was about to fall asleep, suddenly the lights fell on the belt, burning the backing. Cheng was shocked and wiped it off, and it had been burned in one place, and the plain silk was slightly exposed, and blood was faintly visible. Quickly take a knife and take it apart to see it, it is a secret edict written in blood by the emperor. The edict said:","When a very frightened Dong Cheng hesitates, Cao Cao has him stripped, and the robe and belt handed over.","Cao Cao returned both robe and girdle, and their owner made the best of his way home. When night came and he was alone in his library, he took out the robe and looked over every inch of it most carefully. He found nothing. “He gave me a robe and a girdle and bade me look at them carefully. That means there is something to be looked for but I can find no trace of it. What does it mean?” he soliloquized. Then he lifted the girdle and examined that. The jade plates were carved into the semblance of small dragons interlaced among flowers. The lining was of purple silk. All was sewn together most carefully and neatly, and he could find nothing out of the common. He was puzzled. He laid the belt on the table. Presently he picked it up and looked at it again. He spent long hours over it but in vain. He leaned over on the small table, his head resting on his hands and was almost asleep, when a candle snuff fell down upon the girdle and burned a hole in the lining. He hastily shook it off, but the mischief was done: a small hole had been burned in the silken lining, and through this there appeared something white with blood red marks. He hastily ripped it open and drew out the decree written by the hand of the Emperor himself in characters of blood. It read:"

Cao Ren was shocked and discussed with Li Dian. Dian said: ""The two generals deceived the enemy and died. Now it's better to keep the troops still, report to the prime minister, and raise a large army to attack. This is the best policy."" Urgent report. Measure the small land of Xinye, why bother the prime minister's army?"" Dian said: ""Liu Bei is a great man, and should not be underestimated."" Bai Sheng. 'A certain person is not timid, but I am afraid that he will not be able to win."" Ren said in anger: ""Is there a second heart? I want to capture Liu Bei alive!"" Dian said: ""If the general goes, certain person will guard Fancheng."" Ren said, """" If you don't go, you will have two hearts."" Dian had no choice but to order 25,000 troops with Cao Ren and cross the river to join Xinye. Exactly:","When Cao Cao decides to attack Xuande and sends his cousin Cao Ren to oversee taking Xinye and capturing Xuande, it is Shan Fu whose advice Xuande follows.","Some of the defeated troops took the news of the deaths of the leaders and the capture of their comrades to Cao Ren at Fankou. Cao Ren, much distressed, consulted Li Dian who advised, saying, “The loss is due to our underestimation of our enemy. Now we should stay where we are, hold on, and request reinforcements.” “Not so,” said Cao Ren. “We cannot support calmly the death of two leaders and the loss of so many soldiers. We must avenge them quickly. Xinye is but a crossbow-slug of a place and not worth disturbing the Prime Minister for.” “Liu Bei is a man of metal,” said Li Dian. “Do not esteem him lightly.” “What are you afraid of?” said Cao Ren. “The Rule of War says 'To know your enemy and yourself is the secret of victory,'“ replied Li Dian. “I am not afraid of the battle, but I do not think we can conquer.” “You are a traitor!” cried Cao Ren angrily. “Then I will capture Liu Bei myself.” “Do so; and I will guard this city,” said Li Dian. “If you do not go with me, it is a proof that you are a traitor,” retorted Cao Ren. At this reproach, Li Dian felt constrained to join the expedition. So they told off twenty five thousand troops with which they crossed the River Yu for Xinye. The officers all keenly felt the shame of many slain,"
忽探子來報：“華雄引鐵騎下關，用長竿挑着孫太守赤幘，來寨前大罵搦戰。”紹曰：“誰敢去戰？”袁術背後轉出驍將俞涉曰：“小將願往。”紹喜，便著俞涉出馬。卽時報來：“俞涉與華雄戰不三合，被華雄斬了。”衆大驚。太守韓馥曰：“吾有上將潘鳳，可斬華雄。”紹急令出戰。潘鳳手提大斧上馬。去不多時，飛馬來報：“潘鳳又被華雄斬了。”衆皆失色。紹曰：“可惜吾上將顏良、文醜未至！得一人在此，何懼華雄？”言未畢，階下一人大呼出曰：“小將願往斬華雄頭，獻於帳下！”衆視之，見其人身長九尺，髯長二尺；丹鳳眼，臥蠶眉；面如重棗，聲如巨鐘；立於帳前。紹問何人。公孫瓚曰：“此劉玄德之弟關羽也。”紹問見居何職。瓚曰：“跟隨劉玄德充馬弓手。”帳上袁術大喝曰：“汝欺吾衆諸侯無大將耶？量一弓手，安敢亂言！與我打出！”曹操急止之曰：“公路息怒：此人旣出大言，必有勇略；試敎出馬，如其不勝，責之未遲。”袁紹曰：“使一弓手出戰，必被華雄所笑。”操曰：“此人儀表不俗，華雄安知他是弓手？”關公曰：“如不勝，請斬某頭。”操敎釃熱酒一盃，與關公飲了上馬。關公曰：“酒且斟下，某去便來。”出帳提刀，飛身上馬。衆諸侯聽得關外鼓聲大振，喊聲大舉，如天摧地塌，岳撼山崩，衆皆失驚。正欲探聽，鸞鈴響處，馬到中軍，雲長提華雄之頭，擲於地上，其酒尚温。後人有詩讚之曰：,"Suddenly, the spy came to report: ""Hua Xiong led an iron horse to ride down the pass, and used a long pole to carry Sun Taishou's red robes. Before he came to the village, he scolded and fought."" Shao said, ""Who dares to fight?"" The young general is willing to go."" Shaoxi, and led Yu She out. The Times came: ""Yu She and Hua Xiong didn't fight, and Hua Xiong was executed."" Everyone was shocked. The prefect Han Fu said, ""I have the general Pan Feng, who can kill Hua Xiong."" Shao urgently ordered to go out to battle. Pan Feng mounted his horse with a big axe. Not long after they left, Fei Ma reported, ""Pan Feng was beheaded by Hua Xiong again."" Everyone paled. Shao said: ""It's a pity that my generals Yan Liang and Wen Chou haven't arrived! Why should I be afraid of Hua Xiong if only one person is here?"" People looked at him and saw that his body was nine feet long, his beard was two feet long, his eyes were red and phoenix eyes, his eyebrows were lying on silkworms, his face was like a heavy jujube, and his voice was like a giant bell. Shao asked who. Gongsun Zan said, ""This is Liu Xuande's younger brother Guan Yu."" Shao Wen saw what position he held. Zan said, ""Follow Liu Xuande as a horse archer."" Yuan Shu shouted from the tent, ""You lied to my lords without a general? Measure one archer, and dare to say nonsense! Fight with me!"" Cao Cao stopped and said: "" Highway sighs: If this person makes a big statement, he must be brave and prudent; if he tries to go out on a horse, if he is invincible, it is not too late to blame him."" Yuan Shao said, ""If you send an archer into battle, Hua Xiong will laugh at him."" Cao said, ""This is The person is good-looking, and Hua Xiongan knows that he is an archer?"" Guan Gong said: ""If you can't win, please behead someone."" Guan Gong said, ""Pour down the wine, and then come when you go."" When all the princes heard the drums beating loudly outside Guan, and the shouts were loud, it was like the collapse of the sky and the collapse of the mountain, and everyone was shocked. Just as he was about to inquire, the horse came to the middle army where the bell rang, Yun Chang lifted Huaxiong's head and threw it on the ground, his wine was still warm. Later generations have a poem to praise:","By this time, Hua Xiong has advanced to the edge of the camp and is challenging anyone who wants to try him in mortal combat. Two great warriors come forward, but Hua Xiong kills both of them. The war council is in despair, and Yuan Shao asks who else is available to fight Hua Xiong. At this Guan Yu offers, but when Yuan Shao asks who he is and is told he is ‘just an archer’, Yuan Shao is furious at what he sees as an insult to the military leaders. However, Cao Cao speaks up for Guan Yu and suggests they have nothing to lose if he tries. Cao Cao orders warmed rice wine for Guan Yu to drink before the battle. ‘Keep it warm and ready. I’ll be back soon,’ Guan Yu says. Riding swiftly and drawing his sword, he disappears in the direction of the enemy. All that the war council can hear is the sound of the war drums and shouting so loud it seems Heaven would split, the Earth crack open, the very hills and mountains collapse. Guan Yu returns before the wine has had a chance to cool. He contemptuously throws the severed head of Hua Xiong at the feet of the astonished leaders.","Even as they were at this meeting came in a scout to say that Hua Xiong with a company of mail-clad horsemen was coming down from the Pass. They were flaunting Sun Jian's captured purple turban on the end of a bamboo pole. The enemy was soon hurling insults at those within the stockade and challenging them to fight. “Who dares go out to give battle?” said Yuan Shao. “I will go,” said Yu She, a renown general of Yuan Shu, stepping forward. So Yu She went, and almost immediately one came back to say that Yu She had fallen in the third bout of Hua Xiong. Fear began to lay its cold hand on the assembly. Then Imperial Protector Han Fu said, “I have a brave warrior among my army. Pan Feng is his name, and he could slay this Hua Xiong.” So Pan Feng was ordered out to meet the foe. With his great battle-ax in his hand, Pan Feng mounted and rode forth. But soon came the direful tidings that General Pan Feng too had fallen. The faces of the gathering paled at this. “What a pity my two able generals, Yan Liang and Wen Chou, are not here! Then should we have some one who would not fear this Hua Xiong,” said Yuan Shao. He had not finished when from the lower end a voice tolled, “I will go, take Hua Xiong's head, and lay it before you here.” All turned to look at the speaker. He was tall and had a long beard. His eyes were those of a phoenix and his eyebrows thick and bushy like silkworms. His face was a swarthy red and his voice deep as the sound of a great bell. “Who is he?” asked Yuan Shao. Gongsun Zan told them it was Guan Yu, brother of Liu Bei. “And what is he?” asked Yuan Shao. “He is in the train of Liu Bei as a mounted archer.” “What! An insult to us all!” roared Yuan Shu from his place. “Have we no leader? How dare an archer speak thus before us? Let us beat him forth!” But Cao Cao intervened. “Peace, O Yuan Shu! Since this man speaks great words, he is certainly valiant. Let him try. If he fails, then we may reproach him.” “Hua Xiong will laugh at us if we send a mere archer to fight him,” said Yuan Shao. “This man looks no common person. And how can the enemy know he is but a bowman?” said Cao Cao. “If I fail, then can you take my head,” spoke Guan Yu. Cao Cao bade them heat some wine and offered a cup to Guan Yu as he went out. “Pour it out,” said Guan Yu. “I shall return in a little space.” Guan Yu went with his weapon in his hand and vaulted into the saddle. Those in the tent heard the fierce roll of the drums and then a mighty sound as if skies were falling and earth rising, hills trembling and mountains tearing asunder. And they were sore afraid. And while they were listening with ears intent, lo! the gentle tinkle of horse bells, and Guan Yu returned, throwing at their feet the head of the slain leader, their enemy Hua Xiong. The wine was still warm! This doughty deed has been celebrated in verse:"
却說曹仁忿怒，遂大起本部之兵，星夜渡河，意欲踏平新野。,"But he said that Cao Ren was angry, so he raised his troops and crossed the river in the starry night, intending to pacify Xinye.","When Cao Cao decides to attack Xuande and sends his cousin Cao Ren to oversee taking Xinye and capturing Xuande, it is Shan Fu whose advice Xuande follows.",He hastily crossed the River Yu to attack Xinye and trample it in the dust.
却說袁術暗有稱帝之心，乃回書推託不還；急聚長史楊大將，都督張勳、紀靈、橋蕤，上將雷薄、陳蘭等三十餘人，商議曰：“孫策借我軍馬起事，今日盡得江東地面，乃不思報本，而反來索璽，殊為無禮。當以何策圖之？”長史楊大將曰：“孫策據長江之險，兵精糧廣，未可圖也。今當先伐劉備，以報前日無故相攻之恨，然後圖取孫策未遲。某獻一計，使備卽日就擒。”正是：,"However, they said that Yuan Shu had secretly wanted to become an emperor, so he refused to return the book. ""Sun Ce used our military horses to raise an uprising, and today he has all the ground in the east of the Yangtze River. He didn't think about repaying the book, but instead asked for the seal, which is especially rude. What strategy should be used to plan it?"" The dangers of the Yangtze River, the abundance of troops and food, cannot be planned. Now, we should first attack Liu Bei to repay the hatred of the previous attack for no reason, and then try to take Sun Ce before it is too late. If a certain plan is offered, Bei will be captured on the next day."" It is:","This Yuan Shu has no intention of doing. He plans to seize the imperial throne himself, and possession of the imperial seal is, of course, of immense significance. He also feels Sun Ce is in his debt for his having lent the original troops, which have made all Sun Ce’s conquests possible. He deeply resents what he sees as Sun Ce’s lack of gratitude. Yuan Shu is determined to have his revenge and asks the advice of his council. The advice is that Sun Ce is far too strong for him at present. Instead, adviser Yang Dajiang suggests attacking Xuande. ‘I have a plan that will ensure the fall of Xuande, and then we can attack Sun Ce.’ Is this wise? As the poem says:","But Yuan Shu, secretly cherishing the most ambitious designs, wrote excuses and did not return the state jewel. In his own place Yuan Shu hastily summoned about thirty of his officers to a council. Among them were Adviser Yang Dajiang and Generals Zhang Xun, Ji Ling, Qiao Rui, Lei Bo, and Chen Lan. Yuan Shu said, “Sun Ce borrowed an army from me and set out on an expedition which has made him master of the South Land. Now he says nothing of repayment but demands the token of his pledge. Truly he is a boor, and what steps can I take to destroy him?” Yang Dajiang replied, “You cannot do any thing against him, for he is too strongly placed, the Great River as the shield. You must first remove Liu Bei in revenge for having attacked you without cause, and then you may think about Sun Ce."
畢竟曹操性命如何，且聽下文分解。,"After all, what happened to Cao Cao's life, let's listen to the breakdown below.",Cao Cao answers.,The further fortunes of Cao Cao will be told in later chapters.
且說高順等引兵出徐州，將至小沛，有人報知玄德。玄德急與衆商議。孫乾曰：“可速告急於曹操。”玄德曰：“誰可去許都告急？”階下一人出曰：“某願往。”視之，乃玄德同鄕人，姓簡，名雍，字憲和，現為玄德幕賓。玄德卽修書付簡雍，使星夜赴許都求援；一面整頓守城器具。玄德自守南門，孫乾守北門，雲長守西門，張飛守東門，令糜竺與其弟糜芳守護中軍。原來糜竺有一妹，嫁與玄德為次妻。玄德與他兄弟有郎舅之親，故令其守中軍保護妻小。高順軍至，玄德在敵樓上問曰：“吾與奉先無隙，何故引兵至此？”順曰：“你結連曹操，欲害吾主，今事已露，何不就縛！”言訖，便麾軍攻城。玄德閉門不出。次日，張遼引兵攻打西門。雲長在城上謂之曰：“公儀表非俗，何故失身於賊？”張遼低頭不語。雲長知此人有忠義之氣，更不以惡言相加，亦不出戰。遼引兵退至東門，張飛便出迎戰。早有人報知關公。關公急來東門看時，只見張飛方出城，張遼軍已退。飛欲追趕，關公急召入城。飛曰：“彼懼而退，何不追之？”關公曰：“此人武藝不在你我之下。因我以正言感之，頗有自悔之心，故不與我等戰耳。”飛乃悟，只令士卒堅守城門，更不出戰。,"Let's say that Gao Shun and others led troops out of Xuzhou, and they were approaching Xiaopei, and someone reported to Xuande. Xuande hurriedly discussed with everyone. Sun Qian said: ""You can hurry up and rush to Cao Cao."" Xuande said, ""Who can go to Xudu to be in a hurry?"" A person at the next step said, ""Someone is willing to go."" Seeing him, he was from Xuande's same family, surnamed Jian, given name Yong, courtesy name Xianhe, is now a guest of Xuande. Xuande repaired the book and paid Jian Yong, so that Xingye went to Xudu to ask for help; at the same time, he rectified the equipment for defending the city. Xuande guarded the south gate, Sun Qian guarded the north gate, Yun Chang guarded the west gate, Zhang Fei guarded the east gate, and ordered Mi Zhu and his younger brother Mi Fang to guard the central army. It turned out that Mi Zhu had a younger sister who married Xuande as his second wife. Xuande and his brother were relatives of Uncle Lang, so he ordered him to guard the central army to protect his wife and children. When Gao Shun's army arrived, Xuande asked from the enemy building, ""There is no gap between me and Feng Xian, why did you lead the troops here?"" Shun said: ""You are linked to Cao Cao, and you want to harm my master. Now things have come to light, why not bind him!"" After saying this, the army attacked the city. Xuande stayed behind closed doors. The next day, Zhang Liao led his troops to attack Ximen. Yun Chang said to him on the city: ""The public appearance is not vulgar, why did you lose yourself in the thief?"" Zhang Liao lowered his head and said nothing. Yun Chang knew that this person had an air of loyalty and righteousness, and he did not add evil words or fight. Liao led troops to retreat to the east gate, and Zhang Fei went out to meet him. Someone had already informed Guan Gong. When Guan Gong came to the east gate in a hurry, he saw that Zhang Feifang had left the city and Zhang Liao's army had retreated. Fei wanted to catch up, so Guan Gong rushed into the city. Fei said: ""He was afraid and retreated, why don't you chase him?"" Guan Gong said: ""This person's martial arts are not inferior to you and me. Because I feel it righteously, I have a heart of self-repentance, so I don't fight with me."" Fei Naiwu only ordered his soldiers to stick to the city gate and not fight.","When news comes of Lü Bu’s attack on Xiaopei and Xuande, Cao Cao moves to the defence of Xuande. But his army is decisively beaten by Lü Bu’s commander Gao Shun, who comes back from defeating Cao Cao to reinforce the attack on Xuande.","The departure of the army under Gao Shun against Xiaopei was reported to Liu Bei who assembled his officers at a council. Sun Qian advised sending a message to the capital to inform Cao Cao of their danger. In response to the chief's call, Jian Yong, a fellow townsman of Liu Bei, offered to take the message. Up to that moment Jian Yong had served as a secretary. So a letter was written, and Jian Yong set out at once on his journey. Then preparations were made for defense: Liu Bei commanding at the south gate; Sun Qian at the north gate; Guan Yu at the west gate; and Zhang Fei at the east gate. Mi Zhu and his brother Mi Fang commanded the family guard in the center. The two Mis were put in command of the house guard because they were Liu Bei's brothers-in-law; he had taken a sister of Mi Zhu as a second wife. Hence they were suitable men to guard the family. In due course Gao Shun came to the south gate. Liu Bei ascended the tower and said, “I have no quarrel with your master, why do you come here with an army?” “You have plotted with Cao Cao to injure my master as we know now; why should I not bind you?” So saying Gao Shun gave the signal to attack. But Liu Bei did not go out to repulse Gao Shun; he only kept the gate fast closed. Soon after, Zhang Liao led an attack on the west gate, then kept by Guan Yu, who addressed Zhang Liao from the wall. “You are too good a man to waste yourself on rebels,” said Guan Yu. Zhang Liao hung his head and made no reply. Guan Yu knew that Zhang Liao had a sound heart and high principles and said no more, as he was unwilling to wound Zhang Liao. Nor did he go out to attack. Zhang Liao then drew off and proceeded to the east gate, and Zhang Fei went out to give battle. Soon it was told Guan Yu, who came over quickly. He saw Zhang Fei going out, but Zhang Liao was already withdrawing. Zhang Fei wished to pursue, but his brother held him back. “He is afraid and so has gone away; it would be best to pursue,” said Zhang Fei. “No,” said Guan Yu. “As a warrior he is not inferior to either of us, but I have spoken a few straight words, and he has sunk deep. He is repentant and that is why he will not meet us.” So Zhang Fei understood, and the gates were shut and orders given for careful defense."
獻帝遷都幸許昌，紛紛四海生豪傑：,"Xiandi moved the capital to Xuchang fortunately, and there were heroes from all over the world:","At this Xuande bursts into tears and asks, ‘But what will become of the people?’","The Emperor Xian removed the capital to Xuchang, And, within the four seas, all was confusion."
次日，水軍都督毛玠、于禁詣帳下，請曰：“大小船隻，俱已配搭連鎖停當。旌旗戰具，一一齊備。請丞相調遣，尅日進兵。”操至水軍中央大戰船上坐定，喚集諸將，各各聽令。水旱二軍，俱分五色旗號：水軍中央黃旗毛玠、于禁，前軍紅旗張郃，後軍皂旗呂虔，左軍靑旗文聘，右軍白旗呂通。馬步前軍紅旗徐晃，後軍皂旗李典，左軍靑旗槳進，右軍白旗夏侯淵。水陸路都接應使：夏侯惇、曹洪；護衞往來監戰使：許褚、張遼。其餘驍將，各依隊伍。令畢，水軍寨中發擂三通，各隊伍戰船，分門而出。是日西北風驟起，各船拽起風帆，衝波激浪，穩如平地。北軍在船上，踴躍施勇，刺鎗使刀。前後左右各軍，旗旛不雜。又有小船五十餘隻，往來巡警催督。操立於將臺之上，觀看調練，心中大喜，以為必勝之法；敎且收住帆慢，各依次序回寨。操升帳謂衆謀士曰：“若非天命助吾，安得鳳雛妙計？鐵索連舟，果然渡江如履平地。”程昱曰：“船皆連鎖，固是平穩；但彼若用火攻，難以迴避。不可不防。”操大笑曰：“程仲德雖有遠慮，却還有見不到處。”荀攸曰：“仲德之言甚是。丞相何故笑之？”操曰：“凡用火攻，必藉風力。方今隆冬之際，但有西風北風，安有東風南風耶？吾居於西北之上，彼兵皆在南岸，彼若用火，是燒自己之兵也，吾何懼哉？若是十月小春之時，吾早已隄備矣。”諸將皆拜伏曰：“丞相高見，衆人不及。”操顧諸將曰：“靑、徐、燕、代之衆，不慣乘舟。今非此計，安能涉大江之險！”只見班部中二將挺身出曰：“小將雖幽、燕之人，也能乘舟。今願借巡船二十隻，直至北江口，奪旗鼓而還，以顯北軍亦能乘舟也。”,"The next day, Mao Jie, the commander of the navy army, under the tent of Jinyi, asked him, ""All ships, large and small, have been matched with chains. The flags, flags, and weapons are all ready. The prime minister is invited to dispatch the troops soon."" Decide, call the generals, and listen to each order. The two armies of flood and drought were divided into five-color flags: the central yellow flag of the navy army, Maojie and Yujin, the red flag of the former army, Zhang He, the rear army of the soap flag, Lu Qian, the left army of the flag of Wenpin, and the white flag of the right army, Lu Tong. The red flag of the front army is Xu Huang, the soap flag of the rear army is Li Dian, the flag of the left army is oar, and the white flag of the right army is Xiahou Yuan. Reception envoys by land and water: Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong; escort and battle envoys: Xu Chu and Zhang Liao. The rest of the generals, each according to the team. After the order was completed, three links were sent out in the navy village, and the warships of each team went out separately. On that day, the northwest wind suddenly picked up, and the ships pulled up their sails, surfing the waves, as steady as the ground. The Northern Army was on the boat, and they were eager to use their courage, stabbing their spears and using their knives. Front and back, left and right armies, flags and banners are not mixed. There were more than 50 small boats, and the patrol police urged the supervisor. Cao stood on the platform, watching the training, and he was overjoyed, thinking that he was sure to win; he told him to pull back the sails and go back to the village in sequence. Cao Sheng told all the advisors, ""If it wasn't for Heaven's mandate to help me, would you be able to get the phoenix's clever plan? The iron rope connected the boat and crossed the river like walking on the ground."" Cheng Yu said: ""The boat is chained, so it is stable; but if he uses fire to attack It’s hard to avoid it. It must be guarded against.” Cao laughed and said, “Although Cheng Zhongde has long-term plans, he still has nowhere to see it.” Xun You said, “Zhongde’s words are very true. Why did the prime minister laugh at it?” If you attack with fire, you must use the wind. In the middle of winter, but there is a west wind from the north, and there is an east wind from the south? I live above the northwest, and his soldiers are all on the south bank. If he uses fire, he will burn his own soldiers. What should I be afraid of? If it was in the early spring of October, I would have already prepared the embankment."" All the generals bowed down and said, ""The prime minister has a high opinion, and everyone is not in touch."" I'm not used to riding a boat. Now that's not the plan, I can safely cross the dangers of the big river!"" I saw the second general of the squad stepped forward and said: ""Although the young general is quiet and Yan, he can also ride a boat. Today, I would like to borrow a cruise ship for twenty Only, as far as the mouth of the Beijiang River, we will return the flag to show that the northern army can also ride a boat.""","The next day, when Liu Fu’s son comes to collect the body, Cao Cao apologizes profusely, admitting he had been drunk. By now the fleet is ready for action. Cao Cao seats himself in the largest ship in the centre of his flotilla and gives the order to attack. It fills Cao Cao’s heart to bursting point to see his magnificent fleet move out, steady as a rock thanks to Pang Tong’s advice about linking all the ships. Even when Cheng Yu suggests that this might put the ships at risk of contagious fire, Cao Cao dismisses this, pointing out that the wind is blowing in the wrong direction because it is that time of the year.","A few days after the two leaders of the naval force, Mao Jie and Yu Jin, came to say the ships were all connected together by chains as had been ordered, and all was now ready. They asked for the command to start. Thereupon the leaders of both land and naval forces were assembled on board a large ship in the center of the squadron to receive orders. The various armies and squadrons were distinguished by different flags: Mao Jie and Yu Jin led the central naval squadron with yellow flag; Zhang He, the leading squadron, red flag; Lu Qian, the rear squadron, black flag; Wen Ping, the left squadron, blue flag; and Li Tong, the right squadron, white flag. On shore Xu Huang commanded the horsemen with red flag; Li Dian, the vanguard, black flag; Yue Jin, the left wing, blue flag; and Xiahou Yuan, the right wing, white flag. Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong were in reserve, and the general staff was under the leadership of Xu Chu and Zhang Liao. The other leaders were ordered to remain in camps, but ready for action. All being ready, the squadron drums beat the roll thrice, and the ships sailed out under a strong northwest wind on a trial cruise. When they got among the waves, they were found to be as steady and immovable as the dry land itself. The northern soldiers showed their delight at the absence of motion by capering and flourishing their weapons. The ships moved on, the squadrons keeping quite distinct. Fifty light cruisers sailed to and fro keeping order and urging progress. Cao Cao watched his navy from the General's Terrace and was delighted with their evolutions and maneuvers. Surely this meant complete victory. He ordered the recall and the squadrons returned in perfect order to their base. Then Cao Cao went to his tent and summoned his advisers. He said, “If Heaven had not been on my side, should I have got this excellent plan from the Blooming-Phoenix? Now that the ships are attached firmly to each other, one may traverse the river as easily as walking on firm earth.” “The ships are firmly attached to each other,” said Cheng Yu, “but you should be prepared for an attack by fire so that they can scatter to avoid it.” The General laughed. “You look a long way ahead,” said he, “but you see what cannot happen.” “Cheng Yu speaks much to the point;” said Xun You, “why do you laugh at him?” Cao Cao said, “Any one using fire depends upon the wind. This is now winter and only west winds blow. You will get neither east nor south winds. I am on the northwest, and the enemy is on the southeast bank. If they use fire, they will destroy themselves. I have nothing to fear. If it was the tenth moon, or early spring, I would provide against fire.” “The Prime Minister is indeed wise,” said the others in chorus. “None can equal him.” “With northern troops unused to shipboard, I could never have crossed the river but for this chaining plan,” said Cao Cao. Then he saw two of the secondary leaders stand up and they said, “We are from the north, but we are also sailors. Pray give us a small squadron, and we will seize some of the enemy's flags and drums for you that we may prove ourselves adepts on the water.”"

却說張飛在芒碭山中，住了月餘，因出外探聽玄德消息，偶過古城，入縣借糧；縣官不肯，飛怒，因就逐去縣官，奪了縣印，占住城池，權且安身。當日孫乾領關公命，入城見飛。施禮畢，具言：“玄德離了袁紹處，投汝南去了。今雲長直從許都送二位夫人至此，請將軍出迎。”張飛聽罷，更不回言，隨卽披挂持矛上馬，引一千餘人，逕出北門。孫乾驚訝，又不敢問，只得隨出城來。關公望見張飛到來，喜不自勝；付刀與周倉接了，拍馬來迎。只見張飛圓睜環眼，倒豎虎鬚，吼聲如雷，揮矛向關公便搠。關公大驚，連忙閃過，便叫：“賢弟何故如此？豈忘了桃園結義耶？”飛喝曰：“你旣無義，有何面目來與我相見！”關公曰：“我如何無義？”飛曰：“你背了兄長，降了曹操，封侯賜爵。今又來賺我！我今與你併個死活！”關公曰：“你原來不知——我也難說。現放着二位嫂嫂在此，賢弟請自問。”二夫人聽得，揭簾而呼曰：“三叔何故如此？”飛曰：“嫂嫂住着。且看我殺了負義的人，然後請嫂嫂入城。”甘夫人曰：“二叔因不知你等下落，故暫時棲身曹氏。今知你哥哥在汝南，特不避險阻，送我們到此。三叔休錯見了。”糜夫人曰：“二叔向在許都，原出於無奈。”飛曰：“嫂嫂休要被他瞞過了！忠臣寧死而不辱。大丈夫豈有事二主之理！”關公曰：“賢弟休屈了我。”孫乾曰：“雲長特來尋將軍。”飛喝曰：“如何你也胡說！他那裏有好心！必是來捉我！”關公曰：“我若捉你，須帶軍馬來。”飛把手指曰：“兀的不是軍馬來也！”,"However, it was said that Zhang Fei lived in Mount Mangdang for more than a month. Because he went out to hear news about Xuande, he occasionally passed the ancient city and went to the county to borrow food; the magistrate refused and became furious. Live in the city, right and secure. On that day, Sun Qian led Guan Gong's order and entered the city to see Fei. After the ceremony, he said, ""Xuande left Yuan Shao and went to Runan. Now Yun Changzhi has sent the two ladies from Xudu to this place. Please send the general to greet them."" Wearing a spear and getting on his horse, he led more than a thousand people and walked out of the north gate. Sun Qian was surprised and did not dare to ask, so he had to follow him out of the city. Guan Gong was overjoyed when he saw Zhang Fei coming; Fu Dao and Zhou Cang picked it up and patted the horse to welcome him. I saw Zhang Fei's eyes wide open, the tiger's whiskers upside down, roaring like thunder, and he swung his spear to slap Guan Gong. Guan Gong was startled, and hurriedly flashed past, and called out, ""Why is this virtuous brother like this? Did you forget the Taoyuan knot?"" Fei Ho said, ""You are unrighteous, what face do you have to meet me!"" Guan Gong said, ""I How can you be unrighteous?"" Fei said: ""You backed up your elder brother, surrendered Cao Cao, and awarded him the title of marquis. Now you come to earn me again! I will be with you now!"" Guan Gong said: ""You didn't know—I can't tell. Let the two sisters-in-law stay here, my virtuous brother, please ask yourself.” The second lady heard it, and lifted the curtain and exclaimed, “Why is the third uncle like this?” Fei said, “The sister-in-law lives here. Let’s see if I kill the wrongdoer, Then ask your sister-in-law to enter the city."" Madam Gan said, ""Second uncle stayed in Cao's temporarily because he didn't know your whereabouts. Now that you know that your brother is in Runan, he didn't avoid danger and sent us here. Third uncle Xiu saw you by mistake. Mrs. Mi said: ""Second Uncle Xiang is in Xudu, because of helplessness."" Fei said: ""Sister-in-law Xiu will be deceived by him! A loyal minister would rather die than be humiliated. How can a man have two masters!"" Guan Gong said ""My wise brother, Hugh has given up on me."" Sun Qian said, ""Yun Chang is here to find the general."" Fei Ho said, ""Why are you talking nonsense! He has good intentions there! He must have come to arrest me!"" Guan Gong said, ""I If you arrest you, you must bring a military horse."" Fei pointed his finger and said, ""It's not a military horse!""","When Guan Yu sees his brother Zhang Fei riding out of the city leading a thousand horsemen, he sets aside his great sword and rides forward to greet him. But imagine his astonishment when Zhang Fei suddenly gives a roar of anger and charges straight at him with his spear levelled for the kill. Deeply shocked, Guan Yu cries out, ‘Brother, what are you doing? Have you already forgotten the peach orchard?’ ‘You traitor!’ roars Zhang Fei. ‘It’s you who betrayed our brother by surrendering to Cao Cao, taking a place in his court and receiving his gifts. I’m going to kill you!’ When the two ladies hear the noise, they pull aside the curtains and look out. ‘What on earth is going on?’ they demand of Zhang Fei, who reins in, in the midst of his charge, to pay his respects. ‘Don’t you worry, little sisters. I’m going to kill this traitor and then escort you into the safety of the city,’ declares Zhang Fei. ‘But Guan Yu had no idea where either you or Xuande were,’ they say. ‘We had to stay with Cao Cao. As soon as he found out that Xuande was at Runan, we left. He’s seen us through such terrible times on our journey and defended us so gallantly! Please don’t be angry with him!’ ‘You’ve been fooled by him,’ retorts Zhang Fei, ‘and the truth is that a truly loyal man would rather die than be dishonoured. No one who is virtuous can serve two masters.’ ‘Dear brother,’ says Guan Yu, ‘you’re seriously misjudging me.’ ‘Trust me,’ says Sun Qian, ‘Guan Yu has been looking for you, and that search is why he is here now!’ But Zhang Fei shouts back, ‘Rubbish! You’ve come here to capture me!’ ‘But,’ replies a shocked Guan Yu, ‘if I’d wanted to capture you, surely I’d have come with an armed force.’ ‘Which is exactly,’ says a furious and equally shocked Zhang Fei, ‘what you’ve done.’","Now, after being separated from his brothers, Zhang Fei had gone to the Mangdang Hills, where he had remained a month or so while he sent far and near for tidings of Liu Bei. Then as he happened to pass Gucheng, he had sent in to borrow some grain, but had been refused. In revenge, he had driven away the magistrate and taken possession of the city. He found the place well suited to his needs at the moment. As directed by Guan Yu, Sun Qian entered the city and, after the usual ceremonies, told Zhang Fei the news, “Liu Bei has left Yuan Shao and gone to Runan; and Guan Yu, with your sisters-in-law, is at the gates. He wishes you to go out and receive them.” Zhang Fei listened without a word till he came to the request to go out to meet his brother. At that point he called for his armor and, when he had put it on, laid hold of his long octane-serpent halberd, mounted, and rode out with a large company at his back. Sun Qian was too astonished to ask what this meant and simply followed. Guan Yu was very glad when he saw his brother coming, put up his weapons and, with Zhou Cang at his back, rode toward him at full speed. But as Guan Yu approached, he saw all the signs of fierce anger on Zhang Fei's face, and Zhang Fei roared as he shook his spear, threatening Guan Yu. Guan Yu was entirely taken aback and called out anxiously, “Brother, what does this mean? Is the Peach Garden Pledge quite forgotten?” “What impudence is this that you come to see me since your disgraceful behavior?” shouted Zhang Fei. “What disgraceful behavior has been mine?” said Guan Yu. “You have betrayed your brother; you have surrendered to Cao Cao; and you have received title and office at his hands. And now you are come to exploit me. One of us shall die!” Guan Yu said, “Really you do not understand, and it is hard for me to explain. But ask the two ladies here, Worthy Brother, and they will tell you.” At this the ladies lifted the curtain of the carriage and called out: “Brother, why is this?” Zhang Fei said, “Wait a while, sisters, and see me slay this traitor. After that I will conduct you into the city.” Said Lady Gan, “Since he knew not where you were, our brother took shelter with Cao Cao. And since he knew that his elder brother was at Runan, he has braved every danger to escort us thus far on the road. Pray take a correct view of his conduct.” Lady Mi also chimed in, “When your brother went to Xuchang, no other course was open to him.” “Sisters, do not let him blind you to the truth. Real loyalty prefers death to dishonor. No good person can serve two masters.” Guan Yu said, “Brother, cease to wrench me I pray you.” Sun Qian said, “Guan Yu came expressly to seek you.” “How much more nonsense will you talk?” roared Zhang Fei. “How can he be true-hearted? He came to capture me, I say.” “Had I come to capture you, I should have come with troops and horses,” said Guan Yu. “And are there not troops and horses?” said Zhang Fei pointing to a point behind Guan Yu."
却說當日滿江火滾，喊聲震地。左邊是韓當、蔣欽兩軍從赤壁西邊殺來；右邊是周泰、陳武兩軍從赤壁東邊殺來；正中是周瑜、程普、徐盛、丁奉大隊船隻都到。火須兵應，兵仗火威。此正是：三江水戰，赤壁鏖兵。曹軍着鎗中箭、火焚水溺者，不計其數。後人有詩曰：,"But he said that the river was full of fire that day, and the shouts shook the ground. On the left, Han Dang and Jiang Qin attacked from the west of Chibi; on the right, Zhou Tai and Chen Wu attacked from the east of Chibi; in the middle, Zhou Yu, Cheng Pu, Xu Sheng, and Ding Feng were all arriving. The fire must be the soldier's response, and the soldiers will fight the fire's might. This is exactly: Sanjiang water battle, Chibi fierce soldiers. Cao Cao's army shot arrows with spears and drowned countless people. A later poem says:","On this day fire rolls across the river in waves, and the earth itself shakes with the sound of warfare. Attacks come from all sides. What the fire does not destroy the soldiers do and vice versa. Either by spears or arrows, by fire or by drowning, men beyond number are lost to Cao Cao on that day of the dreadful battle of the Red Cliffs. As a poet has said:","Although it was the period of great cold and he was heavy with armor when he fell into the river, yet he escaped with life. In this great battle at the junction of the three rivers, the Three Gorges, when fire seemed to spread wide over all the wide surface of the water, when the earth quaked with the roar of battle, when land forces closed in on both wings and four battle squadrons advanced on the front, when the ferocity of fire answered the clash of weapons and weapons were aided by fire, under the thrusts of spears and the flights of arrows, burnt by fire and drowned by water, Cao Cao lost an incalculable number of troops. And a poet wrote:"

Attendant Shi Zheng Tai admonished: ""Dong Zhuo is a jackal. When he is brought into the capital, he will eat people."" Jin said, ""You are too suspicious, and you are not able to plan big things."" Ruthless; as soon as you enter the forbidden court, disaster will inevitably occur. It is better to stop it and not come, so as not to cause chaos."" If they did not listen, Zheng Tai and Lu Zhi both gave up their positions and left. Most of the court ministers left. Jin sent people to welcome Dong Zhuo in Mianchi, but Zhuo held his troops and did not move.","‘I have my own plans,’ He Jin retorts. ‘ And they involve summoning troops from across the land.’ Annoyed at being ignored, Cao Cao walks out, but not before saying to others: ‘He Jin will bring disaster on all beneath Heaven if he doesn’t take care.’ One of the leaders who responds to He Jin’s call to arms is none other than Dong Zhuo, who had so spectacularly failed to suppress the Yellow Headband rebels.","He Jin read this memorial and showed it to his partisans. Then said Minister Zheng Tai, “A fierce wild beast; if he comes, his prey will be humans!” He Jin replied, “You are too timorous; you are unequal to great schemes.” But Lu Zhi also said, “Long have I known this man; in appearance innocent, he is a very wolf at heart. Let him in, and calamity enters with him. Stop him, do not let him come, and thus will you avoid chaos.” He Jin was obstinate, and both Zheng Tai and Lu Zhi gave up their posts and retired, as did more than half the ministers of state, while He Jin sent a warm welcome to Dong Zhuo, who soon camped at Shengchi Lake and stationed there without further action."
曹仁領兵到，敎且奪新野城歇馬。軍士至城下時，只見四門大開。曹兵突入，並無阻當，城中亦不見一人，竟是一座空城了。曹洪曰：“此是勢孤計窮，故盡帶百姓逃竄去了。我軍權且在城安歇，來日平明進兵。”此時各軍走乏，都已飢餓，皆去奪房造飯。曹仁、曹洪就在衙內安歇。初更已後，狂風大作。守門軍士飛報火起。曹仁曰：“此必軍士造飯不小心，遺漏之火，不可自驚。”說猶未了，接連幾次飛報，西、南、北三門皆火起。曹仁急令衆將上馬時，滿縣火起，上下通紅。是夜之火，更勝前日博望燒屯之火。後人有詩歎曰：,"Cao Ren led his troops to the city and ordered him to seize Xinye City to rest his horses. When the sergeant arrived at the bottom of the city, he saw four gates wide open. Cao's army broke through, and there was no obstruction, and there was not a single person in the city. It was actually an empty city. Cao Hong said: ""This is because the situation is lonely and poor, so I have led the people to flee. Our military power will rest in the city, and the next day will be peaceful."" Cao Ren and Cao Hong rested in the yamen. After the first update, the wind was blowing. The gatekeeper sergeant's flyer burst into flames. Cao Ren said: ""This must be the sergeant's careless cooking, and the fire of omission, don't be alarmed."" The words were not finished, and after several reports, the west, south, and north gates were all set on fire. When Cao Ren urgently ordered his generals to mount their horses, the whole county was on fire, and the whole county was red. It is the fire of the night, even better than the fire of the day before Bowang burned the village. A later poem sighed and said:","Cao Ren has now arrived outside Xinye ready to fight but finds to his astonishment that the city gates are wide open and the city itself deserted. Riding into the deserted city, he gives orders for his men to rest so they can be ready for the fray tomorrow. That night, as the army sleeps, the fires break out. When news of this reaches Cao Ren he at first dismisses it as insignificant. Only when he is told that three of the four city gates are ablaze does he realize how serious this is.","Then Cao Ren and Cao Hong arrived and ordered an attack on Xinye that he might have a place to rest in. They marched to the walls and found the gates wide open. They entered and found a deserted city. No one was visible. “This shows they are done,” said Cao Hong. “They have all run away, people and all. We may as well occupy the city and rest our soldiers ready for tomorrow.” The soldiers were fatigued with marching and hungry as well, so they lost no time in scattering among the houses and setting about preparing food in the deserted kitchens. The leaders took up their quarters in the state residence to rest. After the first watch the wind began to blow. Soon after the gate guards reported that a fire had started. “The careless men have let sparks fly about,” said Cao Ren. He thought no more about it just then, but along came other reports of like nature, and soon he realized that fires breaking out in all quarters were not due to accident. So he gave orders to evacuate the city. Soon the whole city seemed on fire and a red glow hung in the sky. The army was beset with fire fiercer than what Xiahou Dun had experienced at Bowang Slope. Thrice wicked was Cao Cao, but he was bold; Though all in the capital he controlled, Yet with this he was not content,"

却說楊大將獻計欲攻劉備。袁術曰：“計將安出？”大將曰：“劉備軍屯小沛，雖然易取，奈呂布虎踞徐州，前次許他金帛糧馬，至今未與，恐其助備；今當令人送與糧食，以結其心，使其按兵不動，則劉備可擒。先擒劉備，後圖呂布，徐州可得也。”術喜，便具粟二十萬斛，令韓胤齎密書往見呂布。呂布甚喜，重待韓胤。胤回告袁術，術遂遣紀靈為大將，雷薄、陳蘭為副將，統兵數萬，進攻小沛。玄德聞知此信，聚衆商議。張飛要出戰。孫乾曰：“今小沛糧寡兵微，如何抵敵？可修書告急於呂布。”張飛曰：“那廝如何肯來！”玄德曰：“乾之言善。”遂修書與呂布。書略曰：,"He said that General Yang wanted to attack Liu Bei. Yuan Shu said, ""The general will be released?"" The general said, ""Although Liu Bei's army is stationed at Xiaopei, although it is easy to take it, Nailu Bu has settled in Xuzhou. When someone sends food, so as to form their hearts and keep them from holding on to their troops, Liu Bei can be captured. Liu Bei is captured first, then Lv Bu is captured, and Xuzhou can get it."" Shu Xi, who had 200,000 dendrobiums of millet, ordered Han Yin to secretly write a secret letter. Go to Lu Bu. Lu Bu was very happy and treated Han Yin seriously. Yin told Yuan Shu, and Shu sent Ji Ling as the general, Lei Bo and Chen Lan as the lieutenants, commanding tens of thousands of troops to attack Xiaopei. Xuande heard about this letter and gathered the crowd to discuss it. Zhang Fei is going to fight. Sun Qian said: ""Today, I have little food and few soldiers. How can I defend against the enemy? I can rush to Lu Bu to write a book."" Zhang Fei said, ""How can that servant come here!"" with Lu Bu. The book says:","They will send the grain that he has long requested to Lü Bu. However, not the gold, silk and horses he has demanded. These they will hold back so that Lü Bu will not come to the rescue of Xuande when they attack. ‘ Let us give him the grain along with secret instructions,’ says Yang Dajiang, ‘in order to win back his favour and prevent him going to the aid of Xuande. After we have defeated Xuande we can easily take out Lü Bu.’ But Lü Bu is no fool. He sees through this ruse when the gifts and a secret letter arrive. Instead he plans his own solution to the problem of the three rivals.","Adviser Yang Dajiang knew how to remove Liu Bei. “What is your plan of attack on Liu Bei?” said Yuan Shu. Yang Dajiang replied, “Though Liu Bei, now camped at Xiaopei, could easily be taken, yet Lu Bu is strongly posted at the chief city near. And I think Lu Bu would help Liu Bei if it was only for the grudge he bears against you for not having given him the gold and studs, grain and horses you promised. First of all you should send Lu Bu a present whereby to engage his affections and keep him quiet while you deal with Liu Bei. You can see to Lu Bu after this is done, and Xuzhou is yours.” Thereupon two hundred thousand carts of millet was sent, with letters, by the hand of Han Yin. The gift pleased Lu Bu greatly; and he treated the messenger with great cordiality. Feeling sure of no trouble from that quarter, Yuan Shu told off one hundred thousand troops against Xiaopei. The army was led by Ji Ling as commanding general, and Lei Bo and Chen Lan as generals. When Liu Bei heard these things he called his officers to take counsel. Zhang Fei was for open war forthwith. But Sun Qian said, “Our resources were too small; therefore, we must lay the position before Lu Bu and ask help.” “Do you think that fellow will do anything?” said Zhang Fei cynically. Liu Bei decided in favor of Sun Qian's proposal and wrote as follows:"

He reported that he had been red-faced and long-bearded with a big sword and a brave general. Shao Jing asked, ""Who is this person?"" Ju Shu said, ""This must be Liu Xuande's younger brother Guan Yunchang."" Shao was furious and pointed at Xuande and said, ""Your brother kills my favorite general, and you must make a plan, so what is left of you? Use it!"" The sword-caller and the axe launched Xuande Zhanzhi. Exactly:","As predicted, when Yuan Shao hears that his army had been defeated by the actions of Guan Yu, he turns against Xuande, convinced that Xuande must have plotted this. Calling for the executioner, he has Xuande seized ready to be executed there and then. Is this the end of Xuande?","The beaten army returning northward met Yuan Shao on the road and told their story. “A red-faced warrior with a long beard, wielding a huge, long-handled sword, broke into the army, cut off the general's head and bore it off,” said they. “Who was this?” asked Yuan Shao. Ju Shou said, “It must have been Liu Bei's brother, Guan Yu; it could be nobody else.” Yuan Shao was very angry and, pointing to Liu Bei, he said, “Your brother has slain my beloved leader. You are in the plot too. Why should I save you alive?” He bade the lictors take Liu Bei away and behead him."
却說玄德行近漢津，忽見後面塵頭大起，鼓聲連天，喊聲震地。玄德曰：“前有大江，後有追兵，如之奈何？”急命趙雲準備抵敵。曹操下令軍中曰：“今劉備釜中之魚，穽中之虎；若不就此時擒捉，如放魚入海，縱虎歸山矣。衆將可努力向前。”衆將領令，一個個奮威追趕。忽山坡後鼓聲響處，一隊軍馬飛出，大叫曰：“我在此等候多時了！”當頭那員大將，手執靑龍刀，坐下赤兔馬——原來是關雲長，去江夏借得軍馬一萬，探知當陽長坂大戰，特地從此路截出。曹操一見雲長，卽勒住馬回顧衆將曰：“又中諸葛亮之計也！”傳令大軍速退。,"But he said that Xuande was walking near Hanjin, and suddenly he saw a big head of dust behind him, drums beating in the sky, and the shouts shook the ground. Xuande said: ""There is a big river in front, and there are chasing troops in the back, what should I do?"" He ordered Zhao Yun to prepare to attack the enemy. Cao Cao ordered the army to say: ""The fish in Liu Bei's cauldron is now the tiger in the fire; if you don't capture it at this time, it's like putting the fish into the sea, and the tiger will return to the mountain. All generals can work hard to move forward."" A vigorous pursuit. Suddenly, at the back of the hillside where the drums sounded, a group of soldiers flew out and shouted, ""I've been waiting here for a long time!"" Going to Jiangxia to borrow 10,000 military horses, to find out about the battle of Changban in Dangyang, he specially intercepted it from this road. As soon as Cao Cao saw Yun Chang, he restrained his horse and looked back at the generals, saying, ""It's also in Zhuge Liang's plan!"" He ordered the army to retreat quickly.",Soon the advance guard is across the river and heading for Xuande and his men when out of the blue a warrior with a troop of ten thousand men bursts onto the scene.,"Liu Bei was making all speed to Hanjin. Suddenly there appeared in his track a great cloud of dust whence came loud rolls of drums and shoutings. Liu Bei was dismayed and said, “Before us rolls the Great River; behind is the pursuer. What hope is there for us?” But he bade Zhao Yun organize a defense. Now Cao Cao in an order to his army had said, “Liu Bei is a fish in the fish kettle, a tiger in the pit. Catch him this time, or the fish will get back to the sea and the tiger escape to the mountains. Therefore every general must use his best efforts to press on.” In consequence every leader bade those under him hasten forward. And they were pressing on at great speed when suddenly a body of soldiers appeared from the hills and a voice cried, “I have waited here a long time.” The leader who had shouted this bore in his hand the green-dragon saber and rode the Red-Hare, for indeed it was no other than Guan Yu. He had gone to Jiangxia for help and had returned with a whole legion of ten thousand. Having heard of the battle, he had taken this very road to intercept pursuit. As soon as Guan Yu appeared, Cao Cao stopped and said to his officers, “Here we are, tricked again by that Zhuge Liang!” Without more ado he ordered a retreat."

It was unexpectedly heard by the honored guests.” Xuande said: “Have you ever seen Lingfen?” Chengyan said: “ Even the old man came to see him."" Xuande heard the words, said goodbye to Chengyan, and returned on horseback. At the time of heavy snow and wind, looking back at Wolonggang, I was unhappy. Later generations have a poem called Xuande, who visited Kongming in the wind and snow. The poem says:","‘Not at all,’ says Xuande.","“Here at last is Sleeping-Dragon,” thought Liu Bei, hastily slipping out of the saddle. He saluted the donkey rider as he neared and said, “Master, it is hard to make way against this cold wind. I and my companions have been waiting long.” The rider got off his donkey and returned the bow, while Zhuge Jun from behind said, “This is not my brother; it is his father-in-law Huang Chenyan.” Liu Bei said, “I chanced to hear the song you were singing; it is very beautiful.” Huang Chenyan replied, “It is a little poem I read in my son in-law's house, and I recalled it as I crossed the bridge and saw the plum trees in the hedge. And so it happened to catch your ear, Noble Sir.” “Have you seen your son-in-law lately?” asked Liu Bei. “That is just what I have come to do now.” At this Liu Bei bade him farewell and went on his way.

Meanwhile Yuan Shang, shocked by his own failure, has no heart for battle and takes refuge with his other brother, Yuan Xi.","By an order of Cao Cao, the head of Yuan Tan was exposed and death was threatened to any one who should lament for him. Nevertheless a man dressed in mourning attire was arrested for weeping below the exposed head at the north gate. Taken into Cao Cao's presence, he said he was Wang Xiu and had been an officer in Qingzhou. He had been expelled because he had remonstrated with Yuan Tan; but when the news of Yuan Tan's death came, he had come to weep for his late master. “Did you know of my command?” said Cao Cao. “I knew it.” “Yet you were not afraid?” “When one has received favors from a man in life, it would be wrong not to mourn at his death. How can one stand in the world if one forgets duty through fear? If I could bury his body, I would not mind death.” Cao Cao said, “And there were many such as this in the north. What a pity that the Yuan family could not make the best of them! But if they had done so, I should never have dared to turn my eyes toward this place.” The intrepid mourner was not put to death. The remains of Yuan Tan were properly interred, and Wang Xiu was well treated and even given an appointment. In his new position Wang Xiu was asked for advice about the best way to proceed against Yuan Shang, who had fled to his brother, but Wang Xiu remained silent, thereby winning from Cao Cao renewed admiration for his constancy. “He is indeed loyal!” said Cao Cao. Then he questioned Guo Jia, who advised him, saying, “Give Yuan Xi's former generals the command and ask them to attack Youzhou.” Whereupon Jiao Chu and Zhang Nan were given the command and reinforced by the armies under Lu Xiang, Lu Kuang, Ma Yan, and Zhang Yi to bring about the surrender of Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang. Then six generals, to attack Youzhou along three routes. Other armies led by Li Dian, Yue Jin, and Zhang Yan were sent against Gao Gan at Bingzhou."
且說玄德匹馬投靑州，日行三百里，奔至靑州城下叫門；門吏問了姓名，來報刺史。刺史乃袁紹長子袁譚。譚素敬玄德，聞知匹馬到來，卽便開門相迎，接入公廨，細問其故。玄德備言兵敗相投之意。譚乃留玄德於館驛中住下，發書報父袁紹；一面差本州人馬，護送玄德。至平原界口，袁紹親自引衆出鄴郡三十里迎接玄德。玄德拜謝，紹忙答禮曰：“昨為小兒抱病，有失救援，於心怏怏不安。今幸得相見，大慰平生渴想之思。”玄德曰：“孤窮劉備，久欲投於門下，奈機緣未遇，今為曹操所攻，妻子俱陷，想將軍容納四方之士，故不避羞慚，逕來相投。望乞收錄，誓當圖報。”紹大喜，相待甚厚，同居冀州。,"Let's say that Xuande's horse went to Xizhou, and traveled three hundred li a day, and ran to the bottom of the city to call the door; the doorman asked his name and came to report to the governor. The prefect was Yuan Shao's eldest son, Yuan Tan. Tan Sujing Xuande heard the arrival of the horse, so he opened the door to greet him, joined the public house, and asked the reason. Xuande prepared to say that the army was defeated. Tan Nai left Xuande to stay in the post, and sent a letter to Yuan Shao, his father Yuan Shao. At the border of Pingyuan, Yuan Shao personally led the crowd out of Ye County thirty li to greet Xuande. Xuande thanked him, and Shao hurriedly replied: ""Yesterday, I was ill for my child, and I lost my help. I feel uneasy. I am fortunate to meet each other today, which greatly comforts the thoughts I have longed for in my life."" Under the door, I didn’t meet the chance, and now it’s attacked by Cao Cao, and his wife is all trapped. Thick, living together in Jizhou.","He rides hard for day after day, covering hundreds of miles. When he arrives at the gates of Qingzhou, Yuan Tan, Yuan Shao’s oldest son, comes to greet him. Yuan Tan is a fan of Xuande and his heroic acts and is delighted to meet him at last. From Qingzhou Xuande is escorted to Pingyuan, where Yuan Shao greets him with due ceremony. He also apologizes for having failed to come to his assistance due to his other son’s grave illness. Far from bearing a grudge, Xuande offers to join Yuan Shao’s forces – an offer gladly received. Back to the night of the raid: Cao Cao has captured Xiaopei and attacked Xuzhou.","He hastened toward Qingzhou City, traveling one hundred miles a day. When he reached the city and summoned the gate, the guards asked who he was and they told the Governor, who was Yuan Shao's eldest son, Yuan Tan. Yuan Tan was greatly surprised, but he opened the gates and went to meet Liu Bei, whom he treated with due consideration. Liu Bei told the story of his defeat and said he wished for harbor. He was given suitable quarters and hospitably entertained, while the young man wrote to inform his father. Then Yuan Tan provided an escort and sent Liu Bei on his journey as far as the boundary of Pingyuan. At the city of Yejun, Liu Bei was met by Yuan Shao in person ten miles outside the city, with a great escort. Liu Bei made a humble obeisance which Yuan Shao hastened to return and said, “I have been very distressed that, on account of my son's illness, I did not come to your aid. It is a great joy to see you; the one desire of my life is satisfied.” Liu Bei replied, “The poor Liu Bei you see here has long desired to take refuge with you, but fate has hitherto denied him that privilege. Now attacked by Cao Cao, my family lost, I remembered that you, General, would receive good people from all sides. Wherefore I put my pride in my pocket. I trust that I may be found worthy and one day I will prove my gratitude.” Yuan Shao received him with much pleasure and treated him exceedingly well. And they both lived in Yuan Shao's home region Jizhou."
周瑜方纔歇息。忽報張昭、顧雍、張紘、步騭四人來相探。瑜接入堂中坐定，敍寒温畢。張昭曰：“都督知江東之利害否？”瑜曰：“未知也。”昭曰：“曹操擁衆百萬，屯於漢上，昨傳檄文至此，欲請主公會獵於江夏。雖有相吞之意，尚未露其形。昭等勸主公且降之，庶免江東之禍。不想魯子敬從江夏帶劉備軍師諸葛亮至此，彼因自欲雪憤，特下說詞以激主公。子敬却執迷不悟。正欲待都督一決。”瑜曰：“公等之見皆同否？”顧雍等曰：“所議皆同。”瑜曰：“吾亦欲降久矣。公等請回。明早見主公，自有定議。”昭等辭去。,"Zhou Yu just rested. Suddenly, Zhang Zhao, Gu Yong, Zhang Hong, and Bu Zhen came to investigate. Yu entered the hall and sat down, and finished talking about the cold and warm. Zhang Zhao said, ""Does the governor know the benefits of Jiangdong?"" Yu said, ""I don't know."" Zhao said, ""Cao Cao has millions of people and is stationed in Hanshang. Yesterday, the letter was passed on here, and he wants to ask the lord to hunt in Jiangxia. It has the intention of swallowing each other, but it has not yet revealed its shape. Zhao and others persuaded the lord to surrender to save Jiangdong from the disaster. I didn’t want Lu Zijing to bring Liu Bei’s military advisor Zhuge Liang from Jiangxia to this place. My lord, Zijing is obsessed with it. He wants to wait for the governor to make a decision."" Yu said, ""Do you all have the same opinion?"" Gu Yong and others said, ""All of them are the same."" Yu said, ""I also want to come down for a long time. Please come back. I will see the lord tomorrow morning, and I will make my own decision."" Zhao et al resigned.",Lu Su sets off straight away and is reassured by Zhou Yu that he will support him the moment Kong Ming comes as well. But then a delegation led by Zhang Zhao arrives and argues in favour of surrendering to Cao Cao – and Zhou Yu appears to agree with them!,"Zhou Yu had many other visitors. First came Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, Gu Yong, and Bu Zhi to represent their faction to find out what might be afoot. They were received, and after the exchange of the usual commonplaces, Zhang Zhao said, “Have you heard of our terrible danger?” “I have heard nothing,” said Zhou Yu. “Cao Cao and his hordes are encamped up the Han River. He has just sent letters asking our lord to hunt with him in Jiangxia. He may have a desire to absorb this country but, if so, the details of his designs are still secret. We prayed our master to give in his submission and so avoid the horrors of war, but now Lu Su has returned bringing with him the Directing Instructor of Liu Bei's army, Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang, desiring to avenge himself for the recent defeat, has talked our lord into a mind for war, and Lu Su persists in supporting that policy. They only await your final decision.” “Are you all unanimous in your opinions?” “We are perfectly unanimous,” said Zhang Zhao. Zhou Yu said, “The fact is I have also desired to submit for a long time. I beg you to leave me now, and tomorrow we will see our master, and I shall make up his mind for him.” So they took their leave."

玄德躍過溪西，顧望東岸。蔡瑁已引軍趕到溪邊，大叫：“使君何故逃席而去？”玄德曰：“吾與汝無讎，何故欲相害？”瑁曰：“吾並無此心。使君休聽人言。”玄德見瑁手將拈弓取箭，乃急撥馬望西南而去。瑁謂左右曰：“是何神助也？”方欲收軍回城，只見西門內趙雲引三百軍趕來。正是：,"Xuande jumped across the Xixi and looked at the east bank. Cai Mao had already led the army to the stream, and shouted: ""Why did you run away from the seat?"" Xuande said: ""I have no relationship with you, why do you want to harm each other?"" Mao said: ""I have no such intention. Junxiu, listen to what people say."" Seeing that Mao was holding a bow and taking an arrow, Xuande hurriedly turned his horse to look southwest. Mao called to the left and right and said, ""What kind of divine help?"" Fang was about to withdraw his army and return to the city, but Zhao Yun from the west gate led three hundred troops to come. Exactly:","What will it be for the future … just a dissolving memory? On the other side of the river, Cai Mao rides up and shouts, ‘My lord, why did you leave us so suddenly?’ ‘Why did you want to kill me?’ answers Xuande. ‘A misunderstanding. That’s all,’ replies Cai Mao. Then Xuande notices that as he speaks Cai Mao is reaching for his bow and arrow. Turning his horse, Xuande rides off swiftly. It is then that Cai Mao hears the sound of thundering horses drawing near. It is Zhao Zilong, racing towards him with three hundred men.","Thus Liu Bei crossed the rolling river. Then he turned and looked back at the other bank which his pursuers had just gained. “Why did you run sway from the feast?” called out Cai Mao. “Why did you wish to harm one who has done you no injury?” replied Liu Bei. “I have never thought of such a thing; do not listen to what people say to you.” But Liu Bei saw that his enemy was fitting an arrow to his bowstring, so he whipped up his steed and rode away southwest. “What spirits aided him?” said Cai Mao to his followers. Then Cai Mao turned to go back to the city, but in the gate he saw Zhao Yun coming out at the head of his company of guards. By wondrous leap the dragon steed his rider's life could save,"

Make detailed investigations and report to Jiangxia. Huang Zu hurriedly gathered the crowd to discuss, and ordered Su Fei to be the general, Chen Jiu and Deng Long to be the vanguards, and use the troops of Jiangxia to meet the enemy. Chen Jiu and Deng Long each led a team of squatters to intercept Miankou, and each had more than a thousand strong bows and crossbows on the sterns, and tied the scorpions to the water surface. When the soldiers of Eastern Wu arrived, the drums on the scorpion and the bows and crossbows were fired in unison. Gan Ning said to Dong Xi: ""This is the end of the matter, and we have to go in."" He selected more than a hundred small boats, each with fifty elite soldiers - twenty people to punt the boat; each of the thirty people wore armor and held steel knives. ——Do not avoid the arrow and stone, until the side of the squat, cut off the big rope, and the stern traverses. Gan Ning flew up to the cockroach and hacked Deng Long to death. Chen abandoned the boat and left. When Lü Meng saw it, he jumped off the boat, lifted the scull, went straight into the fleet, and set the boat on fire. Chen was anxious to go ashore, and Lu Meng sacrificed his life and rushed to the front, slashing over with a knife in the chest. When Su Fei led the army to meet him on the shore, the generals of Eastern Wu all came ashore together, which was overwhelming. The ancestors were defeated. Su Fei ran away, and met Pan Zhang, the general of the Eastern Wu Dynasty. The two horses crossed each other, and the battle was not close. Zhang was captured alive, and he went to the middle of the boat to see Sun Quan. Quan ordered him to be imprisoned by chariots on the left and right, until Huang Zu was captured alive and killed together. Motivated the three armies to attack Xiakou day and night. Exactly:","Sun Quan’s first objective is to avenge his father by attacking Huang Zu, whose warfare led to Sun Jian’s death. He also plans to take Xiakou. The battle is hard fought, but it soon becomes clear that Xiakou will fall.","Zhou Yu was appointed Commander-in-Chief; Lu Meng was Van Leader; Dong Xi and Gan Ning were Generals. Sun Quan himself would command the main army of one hundred thousand troops. The spies reported that Huang Zu, at the news of an expedition against him, called his officers together to consult. He placed Su Fei in chief command. He also appointed Chen Jiu and Deng Long as Van Leaders, and prepared for general defense. He had two hundreds of warships under the command of Chen Jiu and Deng Long. On these he placed strong bows and stiff crossbows to the number of more than a thousand and secured the boats to heavy hawsers so that they formed a barrier in the river. At the approach of the southern fleet, the drums beat for the ships to attack. Soon arrows and bolts flew thick, forcing back the invaders, who withdrew till several miles of water lay between them and the defenders. “We must go forward,” said Gan Ning to Dong Xi. So they chose a hundred light craft and put picked men on them, fifty to a boat. Twenty were to row the boats and thirty to fight. These latter were armored swordsmen. Careless of the enemy's missiles these boats advanced, got to the defenders' fleet, and cut the hawsers of their ships so that they drifted hither and thither in confusion. Gan Ning leaped upon one boat and killed Deng Long. Chen Jiu left the fleet and set out for the shore. Lu Meng dropped into a small boat and went among the larger ships setting them on fire. When Chen Jiu had nearly reached the bank, Lu Meng reckless of death went after him, got ahead, and struck him full in the breast so that he fell. Before long Su Fei came along the bank with reinforcements, but it was too late; the armies of the South Land had already landed, and there was no hope of repelling them. Su Fei fled into the open country, but he was made prisoner. Su Fei was taken to Sun Quan who ordered that he be put into a cage-cart and kept till Huang Zu should be captured. Then he would execute the pair. And the attack was pressed on; day and night they wrought to capture Xiakou."

Lü Bu went to Piwu and took Diaochan first. Huangfu Song ordered the children of the good family hidden in the dock to be released. But they were relatives of Dong Zhuo, and they were all killed, regardless of age. Zhuo's mother was also killed. Zhuo's younger brothers Dong Min and Dong Huang both beheaded. Hundreds of thousands of gold, millions of platinum, cherubs, jewelry, utensils, and food were stored in the collection dock, which were returned to Wang Yun. Yun Nai was a sergeant of the great reward, and he held a banquet in the capital hall, summoned the generals and officials, and drank wine to celebrate.","Led by Lü Bu, an armed group sets off for Meiwu. When they arrive there, Lü Bu ‘rescues’ Diao Chan and then slaughters every member of Dong’s family – not even sparing his old mother. Hidden away in Meiwu the soldiers find many young women from noble families who have been held as captives. These they free. The vast collection of stolen treasures is seized. On their return Wang Yun lays on a great celebration feast, but all is far from well. The power seems to go to Wang Yun’s head.","Learning the news of their master, Li Jue, Guo Si, Fan Chou, and Zhang Ji fled west swiftly through the night with their Flying Bear Army to Liangzhou. When arriving Meiwo, Lu Bu's first deed was to take Diao Chan into his charge. Then they slew every member of the Dong family, sparing none, not even Dong Zhuo's aged mother. The heads of Dong Zhuo's brother Dong Min and his nephew Dong Huang were publicly displayed in the market place. In Meiwo were hidden many young ladies of good family. These were set free. All properties were confiscated. The wealth was enormous—several hundred thousand ounces of gold, millions of silver coins, pearls, gems, silks, velvets, furs, grain stores. When they returned to report success, Wang Yun rewarded and feasted the soldiers. Banquets were held in the Ministry Hall to which all the officials were invited. They drank and congratulated each other."

Suddenly, Meteor Horse reported that Zhang Ji had led troops from Guanzhong to attack Nanyang, and was killed by the arrows. , Want to raise troops to commit a queer and seize the car. Cao was furious and wanted to raise an army to attack him, but he was afraid that Lu Bu would come to invade Xu, so he asked Xun Yu for a plan. Yu said: ""This is an easy matter: Lv Bu has no plans, and he will be happy when he sees profit; Duke Ming can send envoys to Xuzhou, increase officials and give rewards, and make peace with Xuande. If you are happy, you will not think far away."" Said: ""Good."" Then he sent the commander of the Feng army, Wang Ze, to give an official letter and a letter of reconciliation, and went to Xuzhou to finish it. The army was divided into three routes, with Xiahou Dun as the vanguard. The army horses arrived at the water village of Gansu. Jia Xu persuaded Zhang Xiu to say: ""Cao's army is strong, so you can't fight the enemy. It's better to mobilize the crowd to surrender."" Zhang Xiu followed and sent Jia Xu to Cao Village to pass money. Cao sees that he responds like a stream, loves him very much, and wants to use him as a counselor. Xu said: ""I used to follow Li Jue and offended the world, but now I follow Zhang Xiu, obeying every word and plan, and can't bear to abandon him."" Then he resigned. The next day, I brought embroidery to see the drill. Treated very well. The troops were brought into Wancheng to settle down, and the rest of the army was stationed outside the city. Stay for a few days. Embroidery hosts a banquet every day.","This response pleases Cao Cao, and so instead of killing Xuande he offers him additional troops as a sign of friendship. Not long after, romance diverts Cao Cao.","Liu Bei was to march to Xiaopei, occupy it, call together his former soldiers, and attack Lu Bu. When Liu Bei reached Yuzhou, he sent to inform Cao Cao, who prepared to march an army to subjugate Lu Bu. But just then hasty news came that Zhang Ji, who had gone to the attack of Nanyang, had been wounded by a stray arrow and had died. His nephew, Zhang Xiu, had succeeded to the command of his army; and with Jia Xu as strategist, Zhang Xiu had joined Liu Biao and camped at Wancheng. They intended to attack the capital and get possession of the Emperor's person. Cao Cao was placed in a quandary. He would go to attack this combination, but he feared lest Lu Bu would attack the capital if he left it. So he sought the advice of Xun Yu. Said the Adviser, “Lu Bu has no notion of a policy. He is led astray by any little advantage that presents itself to his eyes. All you need do is to obtain promotion for him, giving him some additional title, and tell him to make peace with Liu Bei, and he will do it. The south is no threat then.” “Good,” said Cao Cao. And he acted upon the hint and sent an Imperial Legate, Wang Ze, to Xuzhou with the official announcement and a letter urging peace, while he went on with preparations to meet the other danger from Zhang Xiu. When ready Cao Cao marched out with one hundred fifty thousand troops in three divisions. Xiahou Dun was the Van Leader, and they went to River Yu and camped there. Jia Xu succeeded in persuading Zhang Xiu of the hopelessness of resistance. “You would do well to surrender, since Cao Cao's army is too large for you to oppose,” said Jia Xu. Seeing the truth of this, Zhang Xiu sent his adviser to propose sub mission. Cao Cao was greatly pleased with the messenger, admiring his ready and fluent repartee, and tried to win him to his service. “I was formerly with Li Jue and was guilty with him. Now I am with Zhang Xiu who esteems my advice, and I should not like to abandon him,” said Jia Xu. Jia Xu left and next day conducted his master into Cao Cao's presence. Cao Cao was very generous. Then he entered Wancheng with a small force, the greater part of the army being put in camp outside where the lines extended some three miles. Great banquets were given every day by Zhang Xiu, and Cao Cao was always being entertained."
未知周郎性命如何，且看下文分解。,"I don't know how Zhou Lang's life is, let's see the breakdown below.",CHAPTER 56,The fate of Zhou Yu will appear in the next chapter.
承乃取出衣帶詔，令平視之；且曰：“今之謀望不成者，乃劉玄德、馬騰各自去了，無計可施，因此感而成疾。”平曰：“不消諸公用心。操賊性命，只在某手中。”承問其故。平曰：“操賊常患頭風，痛入骨髓；纔一舉發，便召某醫治。如早晚有召，只用一服毒藥，必然死矣，何必舉刀兵乎？”承曰：“若得如此，救漢朝社稷者，皆賴君也！”時吉平辭歸。承心中暗喜，步入後堂，忽見家奴秦慶童同侍妾雲英在暗處私語。承大怒，喚左右捉下，欲殺之。夫人勸免其死，各人仗脊四十，將慶童鎖於冷房。慶童懷恨，夤夜將鐵鎖扭斷，跳牆而出，逕入曹操府中，告有機密事。操喚入密室問之。慶童云：“王子服、吳子蘭、种輯、吳碩、馬騰五人在家主府中商議機密，必然是謀丞相。家主將出白絹一段，不知寫着甚的。近日吉平咬指為誓，我也曾見。”曹操藏匿慶童於府中，董承只道逃往他方去了，也不追尋。,"Cheng Nai took out the robe and ordered him to look at him levelly; and he said, ""Those who have failed in their plans today are Liu Xuande and Ma Teng who have gone separately and have nothing to do, so they feel sick."" The life of a thief is only in the hands of someone."" Cheng asked why. Ping said: ""The thief often suffers from head wind, and the pain penetrates into the bone marrow; just as soon as he has a hair, he will call for a doctor. If he is called sooner or later, he will die with only one dose of poison. Why should he raise a sword?"" In this way, those who save the Han Dynasty's crops and crops are all thanks to the Lord!"" Shi Jiping resigned. Cheng was secretly delighted, and walked into the back hall, when he suddenly saw the servant Qin Qingtong and his concubine Yunying whispering in the dark. Cheng was furious and called left and right to capture him, wanting to kill him. The wife persuaded him to be spared from death, and everyone held his back forty, and locked Qingtong in the cold room. Qingtong held a grudge, and Kui Ye broke the iron lock, jumped out of the wall, and entered Cao Cao's mansion, reporting a secret matter. Cao called into the secret room to ask. Qingtong Yun: ""Prince Fu, Wu Zilan, Chong Ji, Wu Shuo, and Ma Teng discussed secrets in the family master's mansion, and they must be the prime minister. The family master will release a white silk thread, I don't know what is written. Recently Ji Ping bit his finger as an oath. , I have seen it before."" Cao Cao hid Qingtong in the mansion, and Dong Cheng only fled to another place, and did not pursue it.","And to show the seriousness of his intent, he bites off the tip of one of his fingers. Reassured, Dong Cheng shows Ji Ping the edict from the emperor. Ji Ping then reveals that when Cao Cao suffers from his crippling migraines it is he who treats him. He declares that he plans to poison Cao Cao the next time he is summoned. After Ji Ping has left, Dong Cheng walks out of his room only to find a slave, Qin Qingtong, chatting up one of his concubines. Furious at this, he orders their death. However, his wife persuades him not to do this. Instead, he orders that they both be beaten forty times, and the slave be locked into a cell. That night, burning with resentment, the slave Qin Qingtong escapes and makes his way to the palace of Cao Cao. There he relates all that he has heard about the plot to assassinate the prime minister, including the latest plot involving Ji Ping. The next day Cao Cao claims he is suffering from a migraine and summons Ji Ping.","And then his host and patient brought forth the decree he had received in the girdle. “I am afraid our schemes will come to nought,” said Dong Cheng. “Liu Bei and Ma Teng are gone, and there is nothing we can do. That was the real reason I fell ill.” “It is not worth troubling you gentlemen with; for Cao Cao's life lies in these hands of mine,” said Ji Ping. “How can that be?” “Because he is often ill with deep-seated pain in his head. When this comes on, he sends for me. When next he calls me, I only have to give him one dose and he will certainly die. We do not want any weapons.” “If only you could do it! You would be the savior of the dynasty; it depends upon you.” Then Ji Ping went away leaving his late patient a happy man. Dong Cheng strolled into the garden and there he saw one of his servants, Quin Quington, whispering with one of the concubines, Yun Ying, in a dark corner. This annoyed him, and he called his attendants to seize them. He would have put them to death but for the intervention of his wife. At her request he spared their lives, but both were beaten forty canes, and the lad was thrown into a dungeon. Sulky at this treatment, Quin Quington broke out of the cell in the night, climbed over the wall, and went straight to Cao Cao's palace, where he betrayed the conspiracy. Cao Cao at once had him taken into a secret chamber and questioned him. Quin Quington gave the names of the conspirators, saying, “Wang Zifu, Wu Zilan, Chong Ji, Wu Shi, Ma Teng, and my master have been meeting secretly. My master has a roll of white silk, with writing on it, but I do not know what it means. Yesterday, Ji Ping bit off one of his fingers as a pledge of fidelity. I saw that.” Quin Quington was kept in a secret part of the palace, while his late master, Dong Cheng, only knowing that he had run away, took no special means to find him."
却說玄德分付劉琦守江夏，自領衆將引兵往夏口。遙望江南岸旗旛隱隱，戈戟重重，料是東吳已動兵矣。乃盡移江夏之兵，至樊口屯紮。玄德聚衆曰：“孔明一去東吳，杳無音信，不知事體如何。誰人可去探聽虛實回報？”糜竺曰：“竺願往。”玄德乃備羊酒禮物，令糜竺至東吳，以犒軍為名，探聽虛實。竺領命，駕小舟順流而下，逕至周瑜大寨前。軍士入報周瑜，瑜召入。竺再拜，致玄德相敬之意，獻上酒禮。瑜受訖，設宴款待糜竺。竺曰：“孔明在此已久，今願與同回。”瑜曰：“孔明方與我同謀破曹，豈可便去？吾亦欲見劉豫州，共議良策；奈身統大軍，不可暫離。若豫州肯枉駕來臨，深慰所望。”竺應諾，拜辭而回。肅問瑜曰：“公欲見玄德，有何計議？”瑜曰：“玄德世之梟雄，不可不除。吾今乘機誘至殺之，實為國家除一後患。”魯肅再三勸諫，瑜只不聽，遂傳密令：“如玄德至，先埋伏刀斧手五十人於壁衣中，看我擲盃為號，便出下手。”,"However, Xuande said that Liu Qi was assigned to guard Jiangxia, and he led the generals to lead troops to Xiakou. Looking at the flag and flags on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, there are many halberds. It was to move all the troops of Jiangxia to the camp in Fankou. Xuande gathered the crowd and said, ""As soon as Kongming went to Eastern Wu, there was no news, and I don't know what happened. Who can go and find out what is the truth?"" Mi Zhu said, ""Zhu would like to go."" Xuande prepared a gift of sheep wine and ordered Mi Zhu To Soochow Wu, in the name of the army, inquired about the truth. Zhu led the order and drove down the river in a small boat to the front of Zhou Yu's Dazhai. The sergeant came to report to Zhou Yu, and Yu called in. Zhu paid respects again to Xuande, and offered a wine ceremony. When Yu received it, he hosted a banquet for Mi Zhu. Zhu said: ""Kongming has been here for a long time, and now I would like to come back with you."" Yu said: ""Kongming is conspiring with me to destroy Cao Cao, how can we go? I also want to see Liu Yuzhou and discuss good strategies together; Leave. If Yuzhou is willing to come in vain, I am deeply consoled."" Zhu Yingnuo said goodbye and returned. Su asked Yu, ""What's your plan if you want to see Xuande?"" Yu said, ""The hero of Xuande's world must be eliminated. I'm taking the opportunity to lure him to kill him. It's really a problem for the country to eliminate."" Lu Su repeatedly Yu didn't listen to the advice, so he passed a secret order: ""If Xuande arrives, first ambush fifty swordsmen and axemen in the wall clothes, and see me throwing a cup as a sign, and then take action.""","Back at Jiangxia, Xuande prepares himself to go down to Xiakou and the forthcoming battle. He orders that Liu Qi be left in charge of the city but is worried that nothing has been heard from Kong Ming. Xuande sends Mi Zhu to go to Zhou Yu’s","Liu Bei had ordered his nephew Liu Qi to hold Jiangxia while he and the bulk of the army returned to Xiakou. Thence he saw the opposite bank thick with banners and flags and glittering with every kind of arms and armor. He knew then that the expedition from the South Land had started. So he moved all his force from Jiangxia to Fankou. Then he assembled his officers and said to them, “Zhuge Liang went to Wu some time ago, and no word has come from him, so I know not how the business stands. Will any one volunteer to go to find out?” “I will go,” said Mi Zhu. So presents were prepared and gifts of flesh and wine, and Mi Zhu prepared to journey to the South Land on the pretext of offering a congratulatory feast to the army. He set out in a small ship and went down river. He stopped opposite the camp, and the soldiers reported his arrival to Zhou Yu, who ordered him to be brought in. Mi Zhu bowed low and expressed the respect which Liu Bei had for Zhou Yu and offered the various gifts. The ceremony of reception was followed by a banquet in honor of the guest. Mi Zhu said, “Zhuge Liang has been here a long time, and I desire that he may return with me.” “Zhuge Liang is making plans with me, and I could not let him return,” said Zhou Yu. “I also wish to see Liu Bei that we may make joint plans; but when one is at the head of a great army, one cannot get away even for a moment. If your master would only come here, it would be very gracious on his part.” Mi Zhu agreed that Liu Bei might come and presently took his leave. Then Lu Su asked Zhou Yu, “What is your reason for desiring Liu Bei to come?” “Liu Bei is the one bold and dangerous man and must be removed. I am taking this opportunity to persuade him to come; and when he shall be slain, a great danger will cease to threaten our country.” Lu Su tried to dissuade him from this scheme, but Zhou Yu was deaf to all Lu Su said. Zhou Yu even issued orders: “Arrange half a hundred executioners to be ready to hide within the lining of the tent if Liu Bei decides to come; and when I drop a cup, that will be a signal for them to fall on and slay him.”"

Zhang Liao and Xu Chu caught up and grabbed the bridle. Cao Cao was in a panic. Zhang Liao said: ""The prime minister is not surprised. I think Zhang Fei is alone, so why should I be deeply afraid! Now I rush back to the army to kill, and Liu Bei can be captured.""","When Zhang Fei sees this full-scale retreat and confusion, he takes the opportunity to destroy the bridge and tells his men to cut loose the branches tied to their horses’ tails.","Panic-stricken Cao Cao galloped westward with the rest, thinking of nothing but getting away.

却說蔡瑁方欲回城，趙雲引軍趕出城來。原來趙雲正飲酒間，忽見人馬動，急入內觀之，席上不見了玄德。雲大驚，出投館舍，聽得人說：“蔡瑁引軍望西趕去了。”雲火急綽鎗上馬，引着原帶來三百軍，奔出西門，正迎着蔡瑁，急問曰：“吾主何在？”瑁曰：“使君逃席而去，不知何往。”趙雲是謹細之人，不肯造次，卽策馬前行；遙望大溪，別無去路，乃復回馬，喝問蔡瑁曰：“汝請吾主赴宴，何故引着軍馬追來？”瑁曰：“九郡四十二州縣官僚俱在此，吾為上將，豈可不防護？”雲曰：“汝逼吾主何處去了？”瑁曰：“聞使君匹馬出西門，到此却又不見。”雲驚疑不定。直來溪邊看時，只見隔岸一帶水跡。雲暗忖曰：“難道連馬跳過了溪去？……”令三百軍四散觀望，並不見蹤跡。雲再回馬時，蔡瑁已入城去了。雲乃拏守門軍士追問，皆說：“劉使君飛馬出西門而去。”雲再欲入城，又恐有埋伏，遂急引軍歸新野。,"But he said that Cai Maofang wanted to return to the city, and Zhao Yun led the army out of the city. It turned out that Zhao Yun was in the drinking room when suddenly he saw the movement of people and horses. Yun Huo was shocked and went out of the building, and heard someone say, ""Cai Mao led the army to look westward."" Yun Huo hurriedly mounted his horse, led Yuan to bring three hundred troops, ran out of the west gate, and was facing Cai Mao, He asked urgently, ""Where is my lord?"" Mao said, ""I made you run away from the banquet, but I don't know where to go."" Zhao Yun was a meticulous person, and he refused to make mistakes, so he rode his horse forward; On the way to go, he returned to his horse and asked Cai Mao, ""You invited my lord to a banquet, why did you lead the army horses to chase you?"" Mao said, ""The bureaucrats of the nine counties and forty-two prefectures and counties are here, and I am the general, so why not not? Protection?"" Yun said, ""Where did you force my lord to go?"" Mao said, ""I heard that you sent a horse out of the west gate, but I didn't see it here."" Yun was surprised and doubtful. When I went straight to the stream to look, I saw water traces on the other side. Yun secretly said, ""Could it be that even the horse jumped over the stream?"" When Yun returned to the horse, Cai Mao had already entered the city. Yun Nai asked the guards at the gate, and they all said: ""Liu Shijun flew out of the west gate and left."" Yun wanted to enter the city again, fearing that there would be an ambush, so he hurriedly led the army back to Xinye.","Zhao Zilong is searching for his lord and as yet has no idea of the tricks Cai Mao has tried to play. Riding up to Cai Mao, he asks him where Xuande is. Cai Mao says he has no idea and in fact has ridden out to try to find him. Zhao Zilong rides to the edge of the river and can see the marks where a horse has tried to cross. He cannot believe that Xuande has actually managed to jump such a vast and swift-flowing river. But enough unanswered questions arise in Zhao Zilong that, despite the best efforts of Cai Mao to reassure him, he takes his men away from the city and back to Xinye.","Just as Cai Mao was going into the city, he met Zhao Yun and his three hundred coming out. It had happened that, while at the banquet, Zhao Yun had noticed some movement of soldiers and horses and had at once gone to the banquet-hall to see if all was well with his lord. Missing Liu Bei from his place, Zhao Yun had become anxious and gone to the guest-house. There he heard that Cai Mao had gone off to the west gate with troops. So he quickly took his spear, mounted and went, he and the escort, in hot haste along the same road. Meeting Cai Mao near the gate, he said, “Where is my lord?” “He left the banquet-hall quite suddenly, and I know not whither he has gone,” was the reply. Now Zhao Yun was cautious and careful and had no desire to act hastily, so he urged his horse forward till he came to the river. There he was checked by a torrent without ford or bridge. At once he turned back and shouted after Cai Mao, “You invited my lord to a feast; what means this going after him with a squadron of horse?” Cai Mao replied, “It is my duty to guard the officials of forty-one counties who have assembled here as I am the Chief Commander.” “Whither have you driven my lord?” asked Zhao Yun. “They tell me he rode quite alone out through the west gate, but I have not seen him.” Zhao Yun was anxious and doubtful. Again he rode to the river and looked around. This time he noticed a wet track on the farther side. He thought to himself that it was almost an impossible crossing for a person and a horse, so he ordered his followers to scatter and search. But they also could find no trace of Liu Bei. Zhao Yun turned again to the city. By the time he had reached the wall, Cai Mao had gone within. He then questioned the gate wardens, and they all agreed in saying that Liu Bei had ridden out at full gallop. That was all they knew. Fearing to reenter the city lest he should fall into an ambush, Zhao Yun started for Xinye."
且說來使回徐州，入城見陶謙，呈上書札，言曹兵已退。謙大喜，差人請孔融、田楷、雲長、子龍等赴城大會。飲宴旣畢，謙延玄德於上座，拱手對衆曰：“老夫年邁，二子不才，不堪國家重任。劉公乃帝室之胄，德廣才高，可領徐州。老夫情願乞閒養病。”玄德曰：“孔文舉令備來救徐州，為義也；今無端據而有之，天下將以備為無義人矣。”糜竺曰：“今漢室陵遲，海宇顚覆，樹功立業，正在此時。徐州殷富，戶口百萬，劉使君領此，不可辭也。”玄德曰：“此事決不敢應命。”陳登曰：“陶府君多病，不能視事，明公勿辭。”玄德曰：“袁公路四世三公，海內所歸，近在壽春，何不以州讓之？”孔融曰：“袁公路塚中枯骨，何足挂齒！今日之事，天與不取，悔不可追。”玄德堅執不肯。陶謙泣下曰：“君若捨我而去，我死不瞑目矣！”雲長曰：“旣承陶公相讓，兄且權領州事。”張飛曰：“又不是我強要他的州郡；他好意相讓，何必苦苦推辭？”玄德曰：“汝等欲陷我於不義耶？”陶謙推讓再三，玄德只是不受。陶謙曰：“如玄德必不肯從，此間近邑，名曰小沛，足可屯軍。請玄德暫駐軍此邑，以保徐州，何如？”衆皆勸玄德留小沛，玄德從之。陶謙勞軍已畢，趙雲辭去，玄德執手揮淚而別。孔融、田楷亦各相別，引軍自回。玄德與關、張引本部軍來至小沛，修葺城垣，撫諭居民。,"Furthermore, the envoy returned to Xuzhou, entered the city to see Tao Qian, and presented a letter, saying that Cao’s troops had retreated. Qian was overjoyed, and the police invited Kong Rong, Tian Kai, Yun Chang, Zilong and others to attend the meeting in the city. After the banquet was over, Qianyan Xuande took the seat and handed over to the crowd, saying: ""This old man is old, and his two sons are not talented, and he cannot bear the heavy responsibility of the country. Duke Liu is the heir of the emperor's family, and he can lead Xuzhou. Xuande said, ""Kong Wen has ordered Bei to rescue Xuzhou, which is righteousness; now we have it for no reason, and the whole world will be prepared for the unrighteous."" Mi Zhu said: ""Today the Han Dynasty's mausoleum is late, Haiyu Qiao is overwhelmed, and merit is established. The establishment of a career is at this time. Xuzhou is rich and has a household registration of one million, and Liu Shijun is in charge of this, and he cannot refuse."" Xuande said: ""I will never dare to answer the order."" Chen Deng said: ""Tao Fujun is very sick and cannot As far as the matter is concerned, Duke Ming will not say anything."" Xuande said, ""The fourth and third princes of Yuan Gonggong, who have returned from home and abroad, are near Shouchun, so why not let the state let him go?"" Kong Rong said, ""There are dead bones in Yuan Gonggong's tomb, why are there teeth hanging on them? Today's matter, God will not take it, regret will not be pursued."" Xuan Dejian insisted. Tao Qian sobbed and said, ""If you leave me, I will die!"" Yun Chang said, ""I will take care of Duke Tao, and my brother will take charge of the state."" Zhang Fei said, ""It's not the state or county that I force him to do. He gave in kindly, so why bother to refuse?"" Xuande said, ""You want to trap me in injustice?"" Tao Qian pushed him again and again, but Xuande just didn't accept it. Tao Qian said: ""If Xuande would refuse to follow, this nearby town is called Xiaopei, which is enough for the army. Please Xuande temporarily garrison this town to protect Xuzhou. How about it?"" Everyone advised Xuande to keep Xiaopei. , Xuande followed it. Tao Qian finished his army, Zhao Yun resigned, and Xuande waved his tears away. Kong Rong and Tian Kai were also different from each other, and led the army to return. Xuande, along with Guan and Zhang Yin, came to Xiaopei, repaired the city walls, and gave orders to the residents.","In honour of the success that Xuande has appeared to achieve in removing Cao Cao from the area, Tao Qian twice offers him the governorship of Xuzhou.","The news that the enemy had left was very gratifying to Tao Qian, who then invited his various defenders into Xuzhou City and prepared banquets and feasts in token of his gratitude. At one of these, when the feasting was over, he proceeded with his wish of retirement in favor of Liu Bei. Placing Liu Bei in the seat of highest honor, Tao Qian bowed before him and then addressed the assembly, “I am old and feeble, and my two sons lack the ability to hold so important an office as this. The noble Liu Bei is a descendant of the imperial house. He is of lofty virtue and great talent. Let him then take over the rule of this region, and only too willingly I shall retire to have leisure to nurse my health.” Liu Bei replied, “I came at the request of Governor Kong Rong, because it was the right thing to do. Xuzhou is saved; but if I take it, surely the world will say I am a wicked man.” Mi Zhu said, “You may not refuse. The House of Han is falling; their realm is crumbling, and now is the time for doughty deeds and signal services. This is a fertile region, well populated and rich, and you are the man to rule over it.” “But I cannot accept,” said Liu Bei. “Imperial Protector Tao Qian is a great sufferer,” said Chen Deng, “and cannot see to matters. You may not decline, Sir.” Said Liu Bei, “Yuan Shu belongs to a family of rulers, who have held the highest offices of state four times in three generations. The multitude people respects him. Why not invite him to this task?” “Because Yuan Shu is a drying skeleton in a dark tomb; not worth talking about. This opportunity is a gift from Heaven, and you will never cease to regret its loss,” said Kong Rong. So spoke Kong Rong, but still Liu Bei obstinately refused. Tao Qian besought him with tears, saying, “I shall die if you leave me, and there will be none to close my eyes.” “Brother, you should accept the offer thus made,” said Guan Yu. “Why so much fuss?” said Zhang Fei. “We have not taken the place; it is he who wishes to give it you.” “You all persuade me to do what is wrong,” said Liu Bei. Seeing he could not persuade Liu Bei, Tao Qian then said, “As you are set in determination, perhaps you will consent to encamp at Xiaopei. It is only a little town, but thence you can keep watch and ward over the region.” They all with one voice prayed Liu Bei to consent, so he gave in. The feast of victory being now ended, the time came to say farewell. When Zhao Yun took his leave, Liu Bei held his hands alternately while dashing away the falling tears. Kong Rong and Tien Kai went home to their own places. When Liu Bei and his brothers took up their abode in Xiaopei, they first repaired the defenses, and then they put out proclamations in order to calm the inhabitants."

Let's say that Wang Zejie sent an edict to Xuzhou, and Bu welcomed him into the mansion, and began to read the edict - seal the cloth as the general of Pingdong, and gave him a special seal - and then published a private book. In front of Lü Bu, the king expressed his respect for Duke Cao. Big happy cloth. He suddenly reported that Yuan Shu had sent someone, and called him in to ask him. The envoy said: ""Emperor Yuan will take the throne sooner or later, establish the East Palace, and urge the imperial concubine to come to Huainan as soon as possible."" Bu was furious and said, ""How dare the rebels dare to do this!"" Then he killed the envoy, nailed Han Yin with a shackle, and sent him away. Chen Dengxi thanked the table, explained that Han Yin and the king went to Xudu to thank him; and answered the letter to Cao, wishing to teach Xuzhou animal husbandry. Cao Zhibu broke up with Yuan Shu and was overjoyed, so he executed Han Yin at the city Cao. Chen Dengmi admonished Cao: ""Lv Bu is a wolf, he is brave and has no plans. It is lighter than going and going. It is better to take it as soon as possible."" Cao said: ""I know the ambition of Lv Bu's wolf son, and it is difficult to raise it for a long time. Seek it out with me."" Deng said: ""If the prime minister has made a move, he should be the inner responder."" Cao was delighted, and presented Chen Gui with two thousand stone in the rank, and Deng became the prefect of Guangling. When Deng resigned, he held his hands and said, ""I will pay for things in the East."" Deng nodded and promised, and went back to Xuzhou to see Lu Bu. Bu asked him, and Deng said: ""My father has given me a lot of money, and a certain person is the prefect."" Bu was furious and said, ""You don't ask for Xuzhou shepherd for me, but ask for the rank for yourself! Your father taught me to cooperate with Duke Cao, and we will end our marriage on the highway. What I asked for, in the end, I got nothing; and your sons are all distinguished, and I am sold by your father and son!"" Then he drew his sword and tried to cut it. Deng laughed loudly and said, ""How can the general be so ignorant!"" Bu said, ""Why am I ignorant?"" Deng said, ""I saw Duke Cao and said that raising a general is like raising a tiger, you should be full of meat; if you are not full, you will eat people. Duke Cao said with a smile: 'It's not as good as what Qing said. I treat Wenhou like raising eagle ears: before the fox and rabbit are resting, I don't dare to be full first. If you are hungry, you will use it. ' Duke Cao said: 'Yuan Shu in Huainan, Sun Ce in Jiangdong, Yuan Shao in Jizhou, Liu Biao in Jingxiang, Liu Zhang in Yizhou, Zhang Lu in Hanzhong are all foxes and rabbits.'"" Bu throwing his sword laughed and said, ""Gong Cao knows me too!"" , and suddenly reported that Yuan Shu's army took Xuzhou. Lu Bu was taken aback. Exactly:","Zhang Xiu is soon defeated and flees, seeking refuge with Liu Biao. Lü Bu, meanwhile, has broken off all negotiations with Yuan Shu and scotched his idea of a marriage alliance. Cao Cao is only too aware that dealing with Lü Bu means trusting someone who is not trustworthy. He uses Lü Bu’s old adviser and friend Chen Deng to try and lure him into an alliance. The upshot of all this is that a furious Yuan Shu decides to attack Lü Bu. The size of the invading army both shocks and alarms Lü Bu.","When Imperial Legate Wang Ze, bearing the imperial decree, reached Xuzhou, he was met by Lu Bu, who conducted him into the residence where the decree was read. It conferred Lu Bu the title General Who Pacifies the East, and a special seal accompanied the mandate. The private mediating letter was also handed over and the messenger detailed the high appreciation in which Lu Bu was held by the Chief Minister of State. Lu Bu was greatly pleased. Next came news that a messenger from Yuan Shu had arrived. When he had been introduced, he said, “My master's project of declaring himself emperor is advancing. He has already built a palace and will speedily choose Empress and concubines and would come to the South of River Huai. He is looking forward to receiving the fiancee of the Heir Apparent.” “Has the rebel gone so far?” cried Lu Bu in a rage. He put the messenger to death and Han Yin into the cage. He drafted a memorial of thanks and sent it to the capital, at the same time sending, too, Han Yin, the unfortunate agent who had arranged the marriage alliance. He also replied to Cao Cao's private meditating letter asking to be confirmed in his protectorship of Xuzhou. The letter was sent by the hand of Chen Deng. Cao Cao was pleased to hear of the rupture of the marriage arrangement between the houses of Yuans and Lus, and forthwith put Han Yin to death in the market place. However, Chen Deng secretly told Cao Cao, saying, “Lu Bu is cruel, stupid, and facile. The longer he remains, the worse.” “I know Lu Bu quite well,” replied Cao Cao. “He is a wolf with a savage heart, and it will be hard to feed him for long. If it had not been for you and your father, I should not have known all the circumstances and you must help me to get rid of him.” “Anything the Prime Minister wishes to do shall have my assistance,” was the reply. As a reward Cao Cao obtained an annually grant of two thousand carts of grain for Chen Gui and the governorship of Guangling for Chen Deng, who then took his leave. As he was saying farewell, Cao Cao took him by the hand, saying, “I shall depend upon you in the eastern affairs.” Chen Deng nodded acquiescence. Then he returned to Lu Bu, who asked him how the visit was. Chen Deng told him, “My father received a generous annuity, and I was made Governor of Guangling.” Lu Bu enraged, saying, “You did not ask Xuzhou for me, but you got something for yourself. Your father advised me to help Cao Cao by breaking off the marriage, and now I get nothing at all of what I asked, while you and your father get everything. I have been victimized by your father.” He threatened Chen Deng with his sword. Chen Deng only laughed, saying, “O General, how unwary you are!” “I, unwary?” “When I saw Cao Cao, I said that to keep you going was like feeding a tiger. The tiger must be kept fully fed or he would eat humans. But Cao Cao laughed and replied, 'No; not that. One must treat the Commander like a falcon. Not feed it till the foxes and hares are done. Hungry, the bird is of use; full fed it flies away.' I asked who were the quarry. He replied, 'Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai, Sun Ce of the South Land, Yuan Shao of Jizhou, Liu Biao of Jingzhou, Liu Zhang of Yiazhou, and Zhang Lu of Hanzhong; these are the foxes and hares.'“ Lu Bu threw aside his sword and laughed, saying, “Yes; he understands me.” But just about that time came news of the advance of Yuan Shu on Xuzhou, and that frightened Lu Bu. When discord rose between Qin and Jin,"

且說袁紹屯兵河內，缺少糧草。冀州牧韓馥，遣人送糧以資軍用。謀士逢紀說紹曰：“大丈夫縱橫天下，何待人送糧為食！冀州乃錢糧廣盛之地，將軍何不取之？”紹曰：“未有良策。”紀曰：“可暗使人馳書與公孫瓚，令進兵取冀州，約以夾攻，瓚必興兵。韓馥無謀之輩，必請將軍領州事；就中取事，唾手可得。”紹大喜，卽發書到瓚處。瓚得書，見說共攻冀州，平分其地，大喜，卽日興兵。紹却使人密報韓馥。馥慌聚荀諶、辛評二謀士商議。諶曰：“公孫瓚將燕、代之衆，長驅而來，其鋒不可當。兼有劉備、關、張助之，難以抵敵。今袁本初智勇過人，手下名將極廣，將軍可請彼同治州事，彼必厚待將軍，無患公孫瓚矣。”韓馥卽差別駕關純去請袁紹。長史耿武諫曰：“袁紹孤客窮軍，仰我鼻息，譬如嬰兒在股掌之上，絕其乳哺，立可餓死。奈何欲以州事委之？此引虎入羊羣也。”馥曰：“吾乃袁氏之故吏，才能又不如本初。古者擇賢者而讓之，諸君何嫉妒耶？”耿武歎曰：“冀州休矣！”於是棄職而去者三十餘人。獨耿武與關純伏於城外，以待袁紹。數日後，紹引兵至。耿武、關純拔刀而出，欲刺殺紹。紹將顏良立斬耿武，文醜砍死關純。紹入冀州，以馥為奮威將軍，以田豐、沮授、許攸、逢紀分掌州事，盡奪韓馥之權。馥懊悔無及，遂棄下家小、匹馬往投陳留太守張邈去了。,"Let's say Yuan Shao was stationed in Hanoi and lacked food and grass. The Mu Han Fu of Jizhou sent people to send food for military use. The advisor Feng Ji said to Shao: ""The great man is all over the world, why should people send grain for food! Jizhou is a place where money and grain are abundant, why not the generals take it?"" Shao said: ""There is no good strategy."" The book and Gongsun Zan ordered the army to advance to take Jizhou, and agreed to attack it, Zan will raise the army. Han Fu has no plans, and he will ask the general to lead the state affairs; When Zan got the book, he saw that they attacked Jizhou together and divided the land equally. However, Shao sent someone to inform Han Fu in secret. Fu panic gathered Xun Chen and Xin Ping two advisers to discuss. Chen said: ""Gongsun Zan will drive Yan and Dai's congregation forward, and his front is unmatched. He has Liu Bei, Guan, and Zhang to help him, and it is difficult to resist the enemy. Today, Yuan Benchu is superior in wisdom and courage, and has a wide range of famous generals. The generals can invite him. In the matter of Tongzhi Prefecture, he will treat the general well, and there will be no trouble with Gongsun Zan."" Han Fuyou drove Guan Chun to invite Yuan Shao. Long Shi Geng Wu admonished: ""Yuan Shao is alone in the poor army. He looks up to me and breathes a sigh of relief. For example, a baby is on the palm of his hand. If he is not breastfed, he will starve to death. Why do you want to entrust it with the state affairs? He said, ""I am a former official of the Yuan clan, and my talent is not as good as in the beginning. The ancients chose the wise and let them go, why are you so jealous?"" Geng Wu sighed, ""Jizhou is resting!"" the rest. Geng Wu and Guan Chun were alone outside the city, waiting for Yuan Shao. A few days later, Shao brought in troops. Geng Wu and Guan Chun came out with their swords drawn, intending to assassinate Shao. Shao general Yan Liangli beheaded Geng Wu, and Wen Chou beheaded Guan Chun. Shao entered Jizhou, took Fu as the general of the Fenwei, and took Tian Feng, Ju Shou, Xu You, and Feng Ji in charge of the state affairs, and seized the power of Han Fu. Fu regretted the lack of time, so he abandoned his family and his horses and went to Zhang Miao, the prefect of Chenliu.","Meanwhile, Yuan Shao has, through sheer cunning, seized control of Jizhou. This is how he did it. He began by suggesting to Gongsun Zan that they attack Jizhou together. He then informed Han Fu, the governor of Jizhou, of the threat Gongsun Zan posed and then offered to join forces with Han Fu to protect the city! Some of Han Fu’s advisers saw this for what it was – a plot to seize the city – but most thought he would ensure their freedom. When Yuan Shao arrived with his army and took over Jizhou, two of the advisers tried to assassinate him, but they were easily overwhelmed and slain by his guard. Han Fu was given an impressive but meaningless title and shunted out of the way, and Yuan Shao established himself and his army in Jizhou.","Yuan Shao was in Henei. Being short of supplies, he sent to borrow from the Imperial Protector of Jizhou, Han Fu, whence he obtained the wherewithal to support his army. Then one of Yuan Shao's advisers, Peng Ji, said to him, “You are really the strongest power here about; why then depend upon another for food? Jizhou is rich and wide; why not seize it?” “I have no good plan,” replied Yuan Shao. “You could secretly send a letter to Gongsun Zan, asking him to attack, promising him your support. Imperial Protector Han Fu of Jizhou, being incapable, must ask you to take over his region, and you will get it without lifting a finger.” So the letter was sent. When Gongsun Zan saw therein the proposal to make a joint attack and divide the territory, he agreed to give his help. In the meantime Yuan Shao had sent to warn Han Fu of Gongsun Zan's threat. Han Fu sought advice from Advisers Xun Chang and Xin Ping. Xun Chang said, “Governor Gongsun Zan of Beiping is commanding a huge and strong army. If he came to attack us, we could not stand against him, especially if he had the help of Liu Bei and his brothers. At present, Yuan Shao is bolder than most, and he has many able and famous leaders under him. You cannot do better than ask him to assist in administering this region. Yuan Shao will certainly treat you with generosity, and you need have no fear from Gongsun Zan.” Han Fu agreed and sent a message to Yuan Shao by the hand of Guan Chun. But the commander of the palace, Geng Wu, remonstrated with his master, saying, “Yuan Shao is a needy man with a hungry army and as dependent on us for existence as an infant in arms on its mother. Stop the flow of milk and the infant dies. Why should you hand the region over to him? It is nothing less than letting a tiger into the sheepfold.” Han Fu replied, “I am one of the clients of the Yuan family, and I know the abilities of Yuan Shao, which is far better than mine. Why are you all so jealous? The ancients counseled yielding to the sage.” Geng Wu sighed, “Jizhou is lost!” When the news got abroad, more than thirty officers of Jizhou left their employment and the city. However, Geng Wu and Guan Chun hid in the suburbs to await the arrival of Yuan Shao. They had not long to wait. Some days later, Yuan Shao with his soldiers came, and Geng Wu and Guan Chun tried to assassinate him with knives. This attempt failed. Yuan Shao's generals, Yan Liang and Wen Chou, beheaded Geng Wu and Guan Chun instantly. Thus both of them died, and the object of their hatred entered Jizhou City. Yuan Shao's first act was to confer on Han Fu a high sounding title—General Who Demonstrates Grand and Vigor Courage in Arms—, but the administration was entrusted to four of Yuan Shao's confidants—Tian Feng, Ju Shou, Xu You, and Peng Ji—who speedily deprived the Imperial Protector of all power. Full of chagrin, Han Fu soon abandoned all, even his family, and rode alone to take refuge with the Governor of Chenliu, Zhang Miao."
却說蔡瑁、張允歸見劉琮，具言：“曹操許保奏將軍永鎮荊襄。”琮大喜；次日，與母蔡夫人齎捧印綬兵符，親自渡江拜迎曹操。操撫慰畢，卽引隨征軍將，進屯襄陽城外。蔡瑁、張允令襄陽百姓，焚香拜接。曹操俱用好言撫諭；入城至府中坐定，卽召蒯越近前，撫慰曰：“吾不喜得荊州，喜得異度也。”遂封蒯越為江陵太守樊城侯；傅巽、王粲等皆為關內侯；而以劉琮為靑州刺史，便敎起程。琮聞命大驚，辭曰：“琮不願為官，願守父母鄕土。”操曰：“靑州近帝都，敎你隨朝為官，免在荊襄被人圖害。”琮再三推辭，曹操不准。琮只得與母蔡夫人同赴靑州。只有故將王威相隨，其餘官員俱送至江口而回。操喚于禁囑付曰：“你可引輕騎追劉琮母子殺之，以絕後患。”于禁得令，領衆趕上，大喝曰：“我奉丞相令，敎來殺汝母子！可早納下首級！”蔡夫人抱劉琮而大哭。于禁喝令軍士下手。王威忿怒，奮力相鬥，竟被衆軍所殺。軍士殺死劉琮及蔡夫人。于禁回報曹操，操重賞于禁。便使人往隆中搜尋孔明妻小，却不知去向——原來孔明先已令人搬送至三江內隱避矣。操深恨之。,"However, they said that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun returned to see Liu Cong, and stated: ""Cao Cao Xu Bao will play the general Yongzhen Jingxiang."" Cong was overjoyed; the next day, he and his mother, Mrs. Cai, held the seal and the military talisman, and personally crossed the river to greet Cao Cao. After the comforting was over, he led the generals along with the expedition and entered the colony outside the city of Xiangyang. Cai Mao and Zhang Yun ordered the people of Xiangyang to burn incense and pay their respects. Cao Cao all used good words to soothe the decree; he entered the city and sat down in the mansion, and then he summoned Kuaiyue to approach and comforted him, saying: ""I don't like Jingzhou, but I like different degrees."" Then Kuaiyue was appointed as the prefect of Jiangling, the Marquis of Fancheng; Fu Xun , Wang Can, etc. were all Marquis of Guannei; and Liu Cong was the prefect of Jinzhou, so he set off. Cong was shocked when he heard the order, and said: ""Cong does not want to be an official, but would like to keep his parents in the soil."" Cao said: ""Jianzhou is close to the capital of the emperor, I will teach you to be an official with the court, so as not to be harmed by others in Jingxiang."" Cao Cao refused again and again. Cong had to go to Suizhou with his mother, Mrs. Cai. Only Gu accompanied Wang Wei, and the rest of the officials were sent back to Jiangkou. He summoned Yu Jin and Fu and said, ""You can lead the light cavalry to chase Liu Cong's mother and son to kill them, so as to avoid future troubles."" Yu Jin received the order, and led the crowd to catch up, shouting: ""I am ordered by the Prime Minister to kill your mother and son! Get your head early!"" Madam Cai hugged Liu Cong and cried. Started with the sergeant of the forbidden drink. Wang Wei was angry and fought hard, but was killed by the army. The sergeant killed Liu Cong and Madam Cai. Yu Jin returned to Cao Cao, and Cao rewarded Yu Jin. They sent people to Longzhong to search for Kong Ming's wife and children, but they did not know where they were - it turned out that Kong Mingxian had been sent to Sanjiang to hide. Fuck it.","Back in Xiangyang, Cao Mao and Zhang Yun persuade Liu Zong to surrender to Cao Cao. Despite Liu Zong’s uncertainty and the advice of other ministers, the two traitors take themselves off to Fancheng and negotiate the terms of surrender. In return Cao Cao makes them both senior honorary officials, puts them in charge of the naval troops and promises that Liu Zong will be given a region to rule in perpetuity. Delighted with all this, the two traitors return to their city to finalize the surrender. After they have gone, Xun You enquires of Cao Cao why, given these two are completely untrustworthy, he has flattered them so much. Cao Cao points out that he needs men with naval experience but that he is under no illusions as to their real nature. ‘I will deal with them later,’ he says. When the news of the deal reaches Liu Zong, he and his mother, delighted by this development, cross the river to personally thank Cao Cao and to hand over the symbols of authority. Mother and son are received with appropriate honours. However, this will not last.","Liu Zong was highly delighted when his two chief supporters returned with the promise Cao Cao had given them. Soon after he gave up his seal and military commission and proceeded to welcome Cao Cao, who received him very graciously. Cao Cao next proceeded to camp near Xiangyang. The populace, led by Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, welcomed him with burning incense, and he on his part put forth proclamations couched in comforting terms. Cao Cao presently entered the city and took his seat in the residence in state. Then he summoned Kuai Yue and said to him graciously, “I do not rejoice so much at gaining Jingzhou as at meeting you, friend Kuai Yue.” Cao Cao made Kuai Yue Governor of Jiangling and Lord of Fankou; Wang Can, Fu Xuan, and Kuai Yue's other adherents were all ennobled. Liu Zong became Imperial Protector of Qingzhou in the north and was ordered to proceed to his region forthwith. Liu Zong was greatly frightened and said, “I have no wish to become an actual official; I wish to remain in the place where my father and mother live.” Said Cao Cao, “Your protectorship is quite near the capital, and I have sent you there as a full official to remove you from the intrigues of this place.” In vain Liu Zong declined the honors thus thrust upon him; he was compelled to go and he departed, taking his mother with him. Of his friends, only Wang Wei accompanied him. Some of his late officers escorted him as far as the river and then took their leave. Then Cao Cao called his trusty officer Yu Jin and said, “Follow Liu Zong and put him and his mother to death. Our worries are thus removed.” Yu Jin followed the small party. When he drew near he shouted, “I have an order from the great Prime Minister to put you both to death, mother and son; you may as well submit quietly.” Lady Cai threw her arms about her son, lifted up her voice and wept. Yu Jin bade his soldiers get on with their bloody work. Only Wang Wei made any attempt to save his mistress, and he was soon killed. The two, mother and son, were soon finished, and Yu Jin returned to report his success. He was richly rewarded. Next Cao Cao sent to discover and seize the family of Zhuge Liang, but they had already disappeared. Zhuge Liang had moved them to the Three Gorges. It was much to Cao Cao's disgust that the search was fruitless."
帝乃自作一密詔，咬破指尖，以血寫之，暗令伏皇后縫於玉帶紫錦襯內，却自穿錦袍，自繫此帶，令內史宣董承入。承見帝禮畢，帝曰：“朕夜來與后說霸河之苦，念國舅大功，故特宣入慰勞。”承頓首謝。帝引承出殿，到太廟，轉上功臣閣內。帝焚香禮畢，引承觀畫像。中間畫漢高祖容像。帝曰：“吾高祖皇帝起身何地？如何創業？”承大驚曰：“陛下戲臣耳。聖祖之事，何為不知？高皇帝起自泗上亭長，提三尺劍，斬蛇起義，縱橫四海，三載亡秦，五年滅楚；遂有天下，立萬世之基業。”帝曰：“祖宗如此英雄，子孫如此懦弱，豈不可歎！”因指左右二輔之像曰：“此二人非留侯張良、酇侯蕭何耶？”承曰：“然也。高祖開基創業，實賴二人之力。”帝回顧左右較遠，乃密謂承曰：“卿亦當如此二人立於朕側。”承曰：“臣無寸功，何以當此？”帝曰：“朕想卿西都救駕之功，未嘗少忘，無可為賜。”因指所着袍帶曰：“卿當衣朕此袍，繫朕此帶，常如在朕左右也。”承頓首謝。帝解袍帶賜承，密語曰：“卿歸可細觀之，勿負朕意。”承會意，穿袍繫帶，辭帝下閣。早有人報知曹操曰：“帝與董承登功臣閣說話。”操卽入朝來看。董承出閣，纔過宮門，恰遇操來；急無躲避處，只得立於路側施禮。操問曰：“國舅何來？”承曰：“適蒙天子宣召，賜以錦袍玉帶。”操問曰：“何故見賜？”承曰：“因念某舊日西都救駕之功，故有此賜。”操曰：“解帶我看。”承心知衣帶中必有密詔，恐操看破，遲延不解。操叱左右：“急解下來！”看了半晌，笑曰：“果然是條好玉帶！再脫下錦袍來借看。”承心中畏懼，不敢不從，遂脫袍獻上。操親自以手提起，對日影中細細詳看。看畢，自己穿在身上，繫了玉帶，回顧左右曰：“長短如何？”左右稱美。操謂承曰：“國舅卽以此袍帶轉賜與吾，何如？”承告曰：“君恩所賜，不敢轉贈；容某別製奉獻。”操曰：“國舅受此衣帶，莫非其中有謀乎？”承驚曰：“某焉敢？丞相如要，便當留下。”操曰：“公受君賜，吾何相奪？聊為戲耳。”遂脫袍帶還承。,"The emperor made a secret edict by himself, biting his fingertips, and writing it in blood, secretly instructing Empress Fu to sew it on the inner lining of the jade belt and purple brocade, but wear a brocade robe and tie this belt by herself, so that the internal historian Xuan Dongcheng would enter. When Cheng saw the emperor's ceremony, the emperor said: ""I came to talk to you at night about the suffering of Bahe, and I remember the great deeds of the country's uncle, so I express my condolences."" Cheng Dun first thanked him. The Emperor Yincheng left the hall, went to the Taimiao Temple, and turned to the Hall of Heroes. After the emperor burnt incense, he inherited the portrait. In the middle is the portrait of Emperor Gaozu of the Han Dynasty. The emperor said: ""Where did my emperor Gaozu get up? How to start a business?"" Cheng was shocked and said: ""Your Majesty is playing with the minister's ears. Why don't you know about the ancestors? The uprising spreads across the four seas, destroys Qin for three years, and destroys Chu in five years; then there is the world, and the foundation of thousands of generations is established."" The emperor said: ""The ancestors are so heroic, and the descendants are so cowardly, can't we sigh!"" ""These two people are not Liuhou Zhangliang and Lihou Xiaohe?"" Cheng said: ""Of course. The great ancestors started the business, and it really depends on the strength of the two."" The emperor looked back from the left and right, and secretly said to Cheng: ""Your Excellency also When these two people stand by my side."" Cheng said: ""I have no merit, so why should I do this?"" The emperor said, ""I think I have not forgotten the merits of Qingxidu's rescue, and I have nothing to give."" He put on his robe and said, ""Your Excellency should wear this robe and tie this belt, as always by my side."" Cheng Dun first thanked him. The emperor took off his robe and gave it to Cheng, and said in secret: ""Qinggui can take a closer look at it, and don't bear my will."" Cheng knew that, put on a robe and tie, and resigned to the emperor. Someone reported to Cao Cao long ago: ""The emperor is talking to Dong Chengdeng in the Hall of Meritorious Officials."" Cao Cao entered the court to see. When Dong Cheng left the pavilion, he passed the palace gate just in time for Cao Cao; he was in a hurry and had nowhere to hide, so he had to stand on the side of the road and saluted. Cao asked, ""Where is the country's uncle?"" Cheng said, ""It is appropriate to be called by the Son of Heaven to be given a brocade robe and a jade belt."" Cao asked, ""Why did you see it?"" Cheng said, ""Because I remembered a certain old Western capital to save him. Gong, so there is this gift."" Cao said, ""Let me see the solution."" Cheng Xin knew that there must be a secret edict in his belt, and he was afraid that Cao would see it through and be delayed. Cao scolded left and right: ""Get down quickly!"" After looking at it for a long time, he smiled and said: ""It really is a good jade belt! Then take off the brocade robe to borrow it."" Cheng was afraid and did not dare to disobey, so he took off his robe and presented it. Cao picked it up by hand and looked at the shadow of the sun in detail. After looking at it, I put it on myself, tied a jade belt, looked back and said, ""How is the length?"" The left and right are called beautiful. Cao asked Cheng and said, ""Uncle Guo gave me this robe and gave it to me. How about it?"" Cheng said, ""I don't dare to give it back to you because of your kindness; I allow someone to make a special offering."" Cao said, ""Uncle Guo accepts this. Could it be that there is a conspiracy in the belt?"" Cheng Jing said, ""How dare you? If the prime minister wants it, he should keep it."" The belt also bears.","And it is the empress herself who sews the secret message into the secret pocket. Summoning Dong Cheng, he takes him to visit the temple of the Han ancestors. They walk side by side through the imperial gallery, where the portraits of the former emperors hang. Walking from portrait to portrait, the emperor reflects upon the fortunes of the former rulers and bemoans his own weakness. Dong Cheng is confused and alarmed, especially when the emperor starts to point out pictures of those who supported or came to the aid of former emperors. Turning to Dong Cheng, the emperor bluntly says, ‘Now we need you to protect us just as these heroes did in the past!’ ‘But I don’t have the ability of these great ones. How could I possibly serve you as they did?’ says Dong Cheng, to which the emperor replies, ‘I remember well how you rescued us when the western capital fell. No reward is enough to express our thanks to you for such bravery.’ Then he gives Dong Cheng the special robe and belt. ‘ Examine this belt well when you return home,’ whispers the emperor. Dong Cheng, understanding only too well what he means, nods his agreement. However! Cao Cao is waiting for Dong Cheng just outside the palace gate. ‘Why are you here? What brings the imperial relative to visit?’ asks Cao Cao. ‘His imperial majesty wished to give me a gift of this robe and belt,’ replies a thoroughly alarmed Dong Cheng. ‘Indeed,’ says Cao Cao, ‘and why would that be?’ ‘Because I helped to save him when the western capital fell,’ replies Dong Cheng. ‘Let me see this belt,’ demands Cao Cao. When a very frightened Dong Cheng hesitates, Cao Cao has him stripped, and the robe and belt handed over.","The Emperor approved, and Fu Wan went out. The Emperor then with his own hand drew up a decree, writing it with blood drawn by biting his finger. He gave the document to Empress Fu to sew into the purple lining of the girdle. When all was done he put on the robe and girded it with the girdle. Next he bade one of the attendants summon State Uncle Dong Cheng to the Palace. Dong Cheng came; and after the ceremonies were finished, the Emperor said, “A few nights ago I was talking with the Empress of the terrible days of the rebellion, and we thought of your good services then, therefore we have called you in to reward you.” The minister bowed his head in thanks. Then the Emperor led Dong Cheng out of the Reception Hall to the Temple of Ancestors, and they went to the gallery of Worthy Ministers, where the Emperor burned incense and performed the usual ceremonies. After this they went to see the portraits, and among them was one of the founder of the dynasty, Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor. “Whence sprang our great ancestor and how did he begin his great achievement?” said the Emperor. “Your Majesty is pleased to joke with thy servant,” said Dong Cheng, rather startled at the question. “Who does not know the deeds of the Sacred Ancestor? He began life as a minor official in Sishang. There gripping his sword, he slew a white serpent, the beginning of his struggle for the right. Speedily he mastered the empire; in three years had destroyed Qin and, in five, also Chu. Thus he set up a dynasty that shall endure forever!” “Such heroic forefathers! Such weakling descendants! How sad it is!” said the Emperor. Pointing to the portraits right and left, he continued, “Are not these two Zhang Liang, Lord of Liu, and Xiao He, Lord of Cuo?” “Certainly. The Supreme Ancestor was greatly assisted by these two.” The Emperor glanced right and left. His attendants were rather far away. Then he whispered to Dong Cheng, “You, like these two, must stand by me.” “My poor services are of no worth; I do not compare with those men,” said the Uncle. “I remember that you saved me at the western capital, Changan. I have never forgotten, and I could never reward you properly.” Then pointing to his own robe, the Emperor continued, “You must wear this robe of mine, girded with my own girdle, and it will be as though you are always near your Emperor.” Dong Cheng bowed his gratitude while the Emperor, taking off the robe, presented it to his faithful minister. At the same time he whispered, “Examine it closely when you get home, and help your Emperor carry out his intention.” Dong Cheng understood. He put on the robe and the girdle, took leave and left the chamber. The news of the audience for Dong Cheng had been taken to the Prime Minister, who at once went to the Palace and arrived as Dong Cheng was passing out at the Donghua Gate. They met face to face, and Dong Cheng could in nowise avoid him. Dong Cheng went to the side of the road and made his obeisance. “Where are you from, State Uncle?” asked Cao Cao. “His Majesty summoned me into the Palace and has given me this robe and beautiful girdle.” “Why did he give you these?” “He had not forgotten that I saved his life in the old days.” “Take it off and let me see it.” Dong Cheng who knew that a secret decree was hidden away somewhere in the garments was afraid Cao Cao would notice a breach somewhere in the material, so he hesitated and did not obey. But Cao Cao called his guards, and they took off the girdle. Then Cao Cao looked it over carefully. “It certainly is a very handsome girdle,” said he. “Now take off the robe and let me look at that.” Dong Cheng's heart was melting with fear, but he dared not disobey. So he handed over the robe. Cao Cao took it and held it up against the sun with his own hand and minutely examined every part of it. When he had done this, he put it on, girded it with the girdle and turning to his attendants said, “How is it for length?” “Beautiful!” they chorused. Turning to Dong Cheng, he said, “Will you give these to me?” “My Prince's presents to me I dare not give to another. Let me give you another robe in its stead,” said Dong Cheng. “Is there not some intrigue connected with these presents? I am sure there is,” said Cao Cao. “How could I dare?” said Dong Cheng, trembling. “If you are so set upon it, then I must give it up.” “How could I take away what your Prince has given you? It was all a joke,” said the Prime Minister."

People reported that Sun Ce attacked Lu Kang, the prefect of Lujiang, and returned victorious. The technique calls for the policy to arrive, and the policy worships under the hall. After the questioning was over, he was ordered to sit and feast. It turned out that Sun Ce retired to Jiangnan after the death of his father, and was a corporal. Later, because Tao Qian and Ce's mother's uncle, Wu Jing, the prefect of Danyang, were at odds, Ce Nai moved his mother and his family lived in Qu'a, but he himself joined Yuan Shu. Shu loved him so much that he often sighed and said, ""The envoy has a son like Sun Lang, why do you hate him when he died!"" The technique saw the courage, and the envoys attacked Lu Kang again, and now they have returned victorious.","Yuan Shu throws a great celebration for him and comments, ‘If I had a son like him I could die happy.’ However, despite such a compliment, all is not well. Sun Ce feels Yuan Shu has slighted him with his patronizing airs and attitudes during the celebration.","In Shouchun, Yuan Shu prepared a great banquet for his soldiers when it was announced that Sun Ce had subdued Lu Kang, the Governor of Lujiang. Yuan Shu summoned the victor, who made obeisance at the foot of the hall of audience. Yuan Shu, sitting in state, asked for details of the campaign and then invited Sun Ce to the banquet. After the unhappy death of his father Sun Jian, Sun Ce had returned to the lower region of the Great River, where he had devoted himself to peaceful ends, inviting to his side good people and able scholars. Afterwards, when a quarrel broke out between his mother's brother, Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang, and the late Imperial Protector of Xuzhou, Tao Qian, Sun Ce removed his mother with all the family to Que, he himself taking service under Yuan Shu, who admired and loved him greatly. “If I had a son like Sun Ce,” said Yuan Shu, “I should die without regret.” Yuan Shu appointed Sun Ce Commander and sent him on various expeditions, all of which were successful. After this banquet to celebrate the victory over Lu Kang, Sun Ce returned to his camp very bitter over the arrogant and patronizing airs of his patron."

At the circle, Lü Bu was the first to go out, and eight strong generals were lined up on both sides: the first was from Mayi, Yanmen: surnamed Zhang, given the name Liao, and the character was Wenyuan; The two generals each brought in six strong generals: Hao Meng, Cao Xing, Cheng Lian, Wei Xu, Song Xian, and Hou Cheng. Cao pointed to Lv Bu and said, ""You and I have nothing to do with each other, so how can we win the prefecture of my state?"" Bu said, ""The Han family has a share of the city. Cao Jun went in and out of music to welcome him. The two horses crossed, and the two spears were raised. After more than 30 battles, the outcome will not be determined. Xiahou Dun slapped his horse and went out to help, while Lü Bu got on the line and Zhang Liao stopped the fight. Annoyed, Lv Bu got angry, and dashed out of the formation, Xiahou Dun and Le Jin both left. Lü Bu covered up and killed Cao Cao's army, retreating thirty or forty li. Cloth from the army. After Cao Cao lost for a while, he returned to the village to discuss with the generals. Yu Jin said: ""A certain person is going up the mountain to watch today. To the west of Puyang, there is a village in Lü Bu, and there are not many troops. Tonight, he will say that our army is defeated, and we must not prepare, so we can lead troops to attack it; It is the best policy."" Cao followed his words and led Cao Hong, Li Dian, Mao Jie, Lu Qian, Yu Jin, and Dian Wei six generals, selected 20,000 horses, and set off from the road overnight.","In honour of the success that Xuande has appeared to achieve in removing Cao Cao from the area, Tao Qian twice offers him the governorship of Xuzhou. Twice he refuses, concerned that people will believe he had manipulated the situation to his own advantage. As Cao Cao races back to Yanzhou, he is informed that Lü Bu’s army has grown hugely and is now a serious threat. But Cao Cao dismisses this and in so doing gravely underestimates the danger. It is near Puyang that the two armies meet. When Cao Cao attacks, Lü Bu’s men easily drive off the enemy.","Now Cao Cao neared Puyang, and he made a camp. The next day he led out his commanders, and they arrayed their armies in open country. Cao Cao took up his station on horseback between the two standards, watching while his opponents arrived and formed up in a circular area. Lu Bu was in front, followed by eight of his generals, all strong men: Zhang Liao of Mayi, backed by Hao Meng, Cao Xing, and Cheng Lian; Zang Ba of Huaying, backed by Wei Xu, Song Xian, and Hou Cheng. They led an army of fifty thousand in total. The drums began their thunderous roll; and Cao Cao, pointing to his opponent, said, “You and I had no quarrel, why then did you invade my land?” “The empire of Han is the possession of all; what is your special claim?” said Lu Bu. So saying, Lu Bu ordered Zang Ba to ride forth and challenge. From Cao Cao's side the challenge was accepted by Yue Jin. The two steeds approached each other; two spears were lifted both together, and they exchanged near thirty blows with no advantage to either. Then Xiahou Dun rode out to help his colleague and, in reply, out went Zhang Liao from Lu Bu's side. And they four fought. Then fierce anger seized upon Lu Bu. Setting his trident halberd, he urged his Red-Hare forward to where the fight was waging. Seeing him approach, Xiahou Dun and Yue Jin both fled, but Lu Bu pressed on after them, and Cao Cao's army lost the day. Retiring ten miles, they made a new camp. Lu Bu called in and mustered his troops. The day having gone against him, Cao Cao called a council, and Yu Jin said, “From the hill tops today I saw a camp of our enemies on the west of Puyang. They were but few men therein, and tonight after today's victory, it will not be defended. Let us attack; and if we can take the camp, we shall strike fear into the heart of Lu Bu. This is our best plan.” Cao Cao thought so too. He and six of his generals—Cao Hong, Li Dian, Mao Jie, Lu Qian, Yu Jin, and Dian Wei—and twenty thousand horse and foot left that night by a secret road for the camp."

說罷，拍馬望長坂坡而去。忽一人大叫：“趙將軍那裏去？”雲勒馬問曰：“你是何人？”答曰：“我乃劉使君帳下護送車仗的軍士，被箭射倒在此。”趙雲便問二夫人消息。軍士曰：“恰纔見甘夫人披頭跣足，相隨一夥百姓婦女，投南而走。”雲見說，也不顧軍士，急縱馬望南趕去。只見一夥百姓男女數百人，相攜而走。雲大叫曰：“內中有甘夫人否？”夫人在後面望見趙雲，放聲大哭。雲下馬插鎗而泣曰：“使主母失散，雲之罪也！糜夫人與小主人安在？”甘夫人曰：“我與糜夫人被逐，棄了車仗，雜於百姓內步行，又撞見一枝軍馬衝散。糜夫人與阿斗不知何往。我獨自逃生至此。”正言間，百姓發喊，又撞出一枝軍來。趙雲拔鎗上馬看時，面前馬上綁着一人，乃糜竺也。背後一將，手提大刀，引着千餘軍，乃曹仁部將淳于導，拿住糜竺，正要解去獻功。趙雲大喝一聲，挺鎗縱馬，直取淳于導。導抵敵不住，被雲一鎗刺落馬下，向前救了糜竺，奪得馬二匹。雲請甘夫人上馬，殺開條大路，直送至長坂坡。只見張飛橫矛立馬於橋上，大叫：“子龍！你如何反我哥哥？”雲曰：“我尋不見主母與小主人，因此落後，何言反耶？”飛曰：“若非簡雍先來報信，我今見你，怎肯干休也！”雲曰：“主公在何處？”飛曰：“只在前面不遠。”雲謂糜竺曰：“糜子仲保甘夫人先行，待我仍往尋糜夫人與小主人去。”言罷，引數騎再回舊路。,"After all, I patted the horse and walked away from Changban Slope. Suddenly a person shouted, ""Where is General Zhao going?"" Yun Lema asked, ""Who are you?"" He replied, ""I am a sergeant under Liu Shijun's tent to escort the chariots, and I was shot down here by an arrow."" Zhao Yun Ask the second lady for news. The sergeant said, ""I just saw Mrs. Gan wearing her head and stomping her feet, following a group of common people and women, heading to the south."" Yun Jian said, ignoring the sergeant, and hurriedly rushed to the south. I saw a group of hundreds of people, men and women, walking away together. Yun shouted, ""Is there Madam Gan inside?"" Madam saw Zhao Yun from behind and burst into tears. Yun got off his horse and inserted a gun, weeping, and said, ""It's Yun's crime to make the mistress go away! Is Madam Mi and the little master safe?"" Madam Gan said, ""Mrs. Mi and I were expelled, abandoned the chariot, and walked among the people. , and bumped into an army horse rushing away. Madam Mi and A Dou don't know where they are going. I escaped here alone."" In the middle of the sentence, the people shouted, and another army rushed out. When Zhao Yun drew his gun and mounted his horse to see, there was a person tied up in front of him, Mi Zhu. A general in the back, carrying a large sword, led more than a thousand troops. It was Cao Ren's general Chun Yudao, who held Mi Zhu, and was about to release him to offer his merits. Zhao Yun shouted loudly, raised his spear and rode his horse, taking Chunyu Dao directly. Unable to withstand the enemy, he was stabbed by Yun and fell off his horse. He went forward to save Mi Zhu and won two horses. Yun asked Mrs. Gan to mount the horse, cut a road, and send it to Changbanpo. I saw Zhang Fei immediately spear on the bridge, shouting: ""Zilong! How can you oppose my brother?"" Yun said: ""I can't find the mistress and the little master, so I'm backward, so what's wrong?"" Fei said: ""If it weren't for Jian Yong Let me report first, I see you now, how can I take a break!"" Yun said, ""Where is your lord?"" Fei said, ""It's only not far ahead."" Yun said to Mi Zhu, ""Mizi Zhongbao Gan will go first, and wait. I'm still going to find Madam Mi and the little master."" After saying that, Qu Qi returned to the old way.","Zhao Zilong sends the man off to be cared for and despatches a messenger to Xuande, saying, ‘I’ll search for the two women and the child, going to Heaven or throughout the earth in pursuit, through good or evil, if I have to, and failure will only happen if I die in the attempt.’ Further along the road, he hears that Lady Gan is walking, barefoot and ragged, with a crowd of other women. Zilong urges his horse on until he sees in the distance a crowd of over two hundred, both men and women. Crying out, he asks, ‘Is Lady Gan here?’ and from the rear of the column a cry goes up – it is Lady Gan. Zilong leaps from his horse, tears flowing, and admits that it is his fault that all this has happened. ‘But where,’ he asks, ‘where is Lady Mi and the child?’ ‘She and I had to abandon our carriage and travel along with the people. But then in the crush and chaos when a group of soldiers appeared we became separated. I’ve no idea where they are now.’ Suddenly a cry goes up from among the people. A band of soldiers has ridden into view, and in their midst is a prisoner. Zilong realizes this is none other than Mi Zhu, Lady Mi’s brother. Rushing to the attack, he scatters the troop and rescues Mi Zhu and captures two horses. With Lady Gan on one and Mi Zhu on the other, they all ride off to find Xuande. As they approach the bridge, Zhang Fei, who is standing guard there, shouts out, ‘Why have you betrayed my brother?’ to which Zilong replies that he has been looking for the ladies and the child and that he has no idea what Zhang Fei is talking about! Grudgingly Zhang Fei has to confess that he has heard about this from Jian Yong, but only because of that will he believe Zilong! Zilong hands over Lady Gan to Mi Zhu with orders to take her to Xuande, while he himself turns about and heads back into the battle to try to find Lady Mi and the child.","Then Zhao Yun rode off toward the Long Slope Bridge. As he went a voice called out, “General Zhao Yun, where are you going?” “Who are you?” said Zhao Yun, pulling up. “One of the Princely One's carriage guards. I am wounded.” “Do you know anything of the two ladies?” “Not very long ago I saw the Lady Gan go south with a party of other women. Her hair was down and she was barefooted” Hearing this, without even another glance at the speaker, Zhao Yun put his horse at full gallop toward the south. Soon he saw a small crowd of people, male and female, walking hand in hand. “Is Lady Gan among you!” he called out. A woman in the rear of the party looked up at him and uttered a loud cry. He slipped off his steed, stuck his spear in the sand and wept, “It was my fault that you were lost. But where are Lady Mi and our child lord?” Lady Gan replied, “She and I were forced to abandon our carriage and mingle with the crowd on foot. Then a band of soldiers came up and we were separated. I do not know where they are. I ran for my life.” As she spoke a howl of distress rose from the crowd of fugitives, for a thousand of soldiers appeared. Zhao Yun recovered his spear and mounted ready for action. Presently he saw among the soldiers a prisoner bound upon a horse; and the prisoner was Mi Zhu. Behind Mi Zhu followed a general gripping a huge sword. The troops belonged to the army of Cao Ren, and the general was Chunyu Dao. Having captured Mi Zhu, he was just taking him to his chief as a proof of his prowess. Zhao Yun shouted and rode at the captor who was speedily slain by a spear thrust and his captive was set free. Then taking two of the horses, Zhao Yun set Lady Gan on one and Mi Zhu took the other. They rode away toward Long Slope Bridge. But there, standing grim on the bridge, was Zhang Fei. As soon as he saw Zhao Yun, he called out, “Zhao Yun, why have you betrayed our lord?” “I fell behind because I was seeking the ladies and our child lord,” said Zhao Yun. “What do you mean by talking of betrayal?” “If it had not been that Jian Yong arrived before you and told me the story, I should hardly have spared you.” “Where is the master?” said Zhao Yun. “Not far away, in front there.” “Conduct Lady Gan to him; I am going to look for Lady Mi,” said Zhao Yun to his companion, and he turned back along the road by which he had come."

却說曹操見雲長在旱路引軍截出，疑有伏兵，不敢來追；又恐水路先被玄德奪了江陵，便星夜提兵赴江陵來。荊州治中鄧義、別駕劉先，已備知襄陽之事，料不能抵敵曹操，遂引荊州軍民出郭投降。曹操入城，安民已定，釋韓嵩之囚，加為大鴻臚。其餘衆官，各有封賞。曹操與衆將議曰：“今劉備已投江夏，恐結連東吳，是滋蔓也。當用何計破之？”荀攸曰：“我今大振兵威，遣使馳檄江東，請孫權會獵於江夏，共擒劉備，分荊州之地，永結盟好。孫權必驚疑而來降，則吾事濟矣。”操從其計，一面發檄遣使赴東吳；一面計點馬步水軍共八十三萬，詐稱一百萬，水陸並進，船騎雙行，沿江而來。西連荊、峽，東接蘄、黃，寨柵聯絡三百餘里。,"However, Cao Cao said that when Yun Chang was leading the army on the dry road to intercept him, he suspected that there were soldiers in ambush, and did not dare to chase him; and he feared that the water road would be captured by Xuande first, so Xingye sent his troops to Jiangling. Deng Yi and Liu Xian, who ruled Jingzhou, had already known about Xiangyang, but they were not able to fight against the enemy Cao Cao, so they led Jingzhou soldiers and civilians out of Guo to surrender. When Cao Cao entered the city, Anmin was settled, he released Han Song's prisoner, and added him to Dahonglu. The rest of the officials have their own awards. Cao Cao and all the generals said, ""Now Liu Bei has surrendered to Jiangxia, and he is afraid that it will link up with Eastern Wu. It will be a breeding ground. What plan should we use to break it?"" Sun Quan will hunt in Jiangxia, capture Liu Bei together, divide Jingzhou, and form an alliance forever. Sun Quan will come and surrender in surprise, and my affairs will be relieved."" Cao followed his plan, sending envoys to Eastern Wu; There are 830,000 navy troops on horses and troopers, and they claim to be one million. It connects Jing and Xia to the west, Qi and Huang to the east, and Zhai Zha connects more than 300 li.","A war council is held, and it is agreed that the main force will head for Jiangxia, while Guan Yu will stay behind to defend Xiakou with just five thousand men. This deters Cao Cao, who turns aside to take the surrender of Jingzhou, and here he prepares for his main attack. His troops number eight hundred and thirty thousand – which Cao Cao rounds up by claiming he has a million men bearing arms. The scale of this army is almost unimaginable. The soldiers’ camps alone stretch for hundreds of miles along the Great River. Back at Sun Quan’s headquarters, in the capital of the state of Wu, news of Cao Cao’s advance has reached them, and the taking of Jingzhou right up against their border deeply alarms Sun Quan’s advisers.","When Cao Cao saw Guan Yu with a force ready to attack, he feared lest a greater number were hidden away behind, so he stopped the pursuit. He also feared lest Liu Bei should take Jiangling, so he marched thither with all haste. The two officers in command at Jingzhou City, Deng Yi and Liu Xian, had heard of the death of their lord Liu Zong at Xiangyang and, knowing that there was no chance of successful defense against Cao Cao's armies, they led out the people of Jingzhou to the outskirts and offered submission. Cao Cao entered the city and, after restoring order and confidence, he released Han Song and gave him the dignified office of Director of Ambassadorial Receptions. He rewarded the others. Then said Cao Cao, “Liu Bei has gone to Jiangxia and may ally himself with the South Land, and the opposition to me will be greater. Can he be destroyed?” Xun You said, “The splendor of your achievements has spread wide. Therefore you might send a messenger to invite Sun Quan to a grand hunting party at Jiangxia, and you two could seize Liu Bei, share Jingzhou with Sun Quan, and make a solemn treaty. Sun Quan will be too frightened not to come over to you, and your end will be gained.” Cao Cao agreed. He sent the letters by a messenger, and he prepared his army, horse and foot and marines. He had in all eight hundred thirty thousand troops, but he called them a million. The attack was to be by land and water at the same time. The fleet advanced up the river in two lines. On the west it extended to Jingxia, on the east to Qichun."

Cao was shot with one arrow in his right arm, and Ma was also shot with three arrows. Fortunately, the horse is a good horse of Dawan, and it is very painful and walks fast. Just as they walked to the banks of the Ganshui River, the thieves chased after them, and Anmin was chopped to pieces. Cao Cao rushed the horse to cross the river, only to get to the shore, the thief soldier shot an arrow, hit the horse's eye, and the horse fell to the ground. Cao Ang, the eldest son of Cao, followed Cao on the horse he was riding, and Cao mounted it and ran quickly. Cao Ang was shot dead by random arrows. Cao is off, the road meets the generals, collect the remnants. At that time, the troops of Jinzhou led by Xiahou Dun took advantage of the situation and plundered the people's homes; The Xizhou soldiers walked back, greeted Cao and cried and bowed to the ground, saying that they were forbidden to rebel, and killed the Xizhou army and horses. Shocked. Soon, Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Li Dian, and Le Jin all arrived. If you talk about banning rebellion, you can mobilize your troops to meet them.","Although wounded with an arrow in his shoulder, Cao Cao manages to escape the trap. Mounted upon his swift Fergana horse and escorted by his son Cao Ang, he dashes for the river. The great horse, already wounded by an arrow, brings him to the riverbank. Hesitating for a moment, the great horse then plunges into the river and swims to the other side. As the horse scrambles up the bank, a final arrow brings the heroic beast down. Without a moment’s thought, Cao Ang gives his father his horse, and Cao Cao escapes. But before Cao Ang can escape he is slain by a hail of arrows. Cao Cao regroups his men and realizes that they are still superior to the forces of Zhang Xiu.","Cao Cao, relying on Dian Wei to hold the main gate, had fled in haste by the rear gate. Cao Amin accompanied him on foot. Then Cao Cao was wounded by an arrow in the arm, and three arrows struck his horse. However, fortunately, the horse was a fine Dawan beast full of spirit and, in spite of its wounds, it bore its master swiftly and well as far as the bank of River Yu. Here some of the pursuers came up, and Cao Amin was hacked to pieces. Cao Cao dashed into the river and reached the further side, but there an arrow struck his steed in the eye and it fell. Cao Cao's eldest son, Cao Ang, dismounted and yielded his horse to his father, who galloped on. Cao Ang was killed by arrows, but Cao Cao himself got away. Soon after he met several of his officers who had rallied a few troops. The soldiers of Qingzhou under Xiahou Dun seized the occasion to plunder the people. Yu Jin took his army, fell upon them, and slew many. Thus he protected and appeased the people. The plunderers, meeting Cao Cao on the road, knelt down howling and said Yu Jin had mutinied and attacked them. Cao Cao was surprised, and he gave order to Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Li Dian, and Yue Jin to attack Yu Jin. Now when Yu Jin saw his master and a great company approaching, he at once stopped the attack and set his troops to make a camp."

Here is the petty follower of a small magistrate daring to flaunt his prowess before us! Expel him from the tent, I say.” But again Cao Cao interposed, “Shall we consider the station of him who has done a great service?” “If you hold a mere magistrate in such honor, then I simply withdraw,” said Yuan Shu. “Is a word enough to defeat a grand enterprise?” said Cao Cao. Then he told Gongsun Zan to lead the three brothers back to their own camp, and the other chiefs then dispersed.

遂上馬，行數里，勒馬回觀隆中景物，果然山不高而秀雅，水不深而澄淸；地不廣而平坦，林不大而茂盛；猿鶴相親，松篁交翠：觀之不已。忽見一人，容貌軒昂，丰姿俊爽，頭戴逍遙巾，身穿皂布袍，杖藜從山僻小路而來。玄德曰：“此必臥龍先生也！”急下馬向前施禮，問曰：“先生非臥龍否？”其人曰：“將軍是誰？”玄德曰：“劉備也。”其人曰：“吾非孔明，乃孔明之友：博陵崔州平也。”玄德曰：“久聞大名，幸得相遇。乞卽席地權坐，請敎一言。”二人對坐於林間石上，關、張侍立於側。州平曰：“將軍何故欲見孔明？”玄德曰：“方今天下大亂，四方雲擾，欲見孔明，求安邦定國之策耳。”州平笑曰：“公以定亂為主，雖是仁心，但自古以來，治亂無常：自高祖斬蛇起義，誅無道秦，是由亂而入治也；至哀、平之世二百年，太平日久，王莽篡逆，又由治而入亂；光武中興，重整基業，復由亂而入治；至今二百年，民安已久，故干戈又復四起：此正由治入亂之時，未可猝定也。將軍欲使孔明斡旋天地，補綴乾坤，恐不易為，徒費心力耳。豈不聞‘順天者逸，逆天者勞’、‘數之所在，理不得而奪之；命之所在，人不得而強之’乎？”玄德曰：“先生所言，誠為高見。但備身為漢胄，合當匡扶漢室，何敢委之數與命？”州平曰：“山野之夫，不足與論天下事，適承明問，故妄言之。”玄德曰：“蒙先生見敎。但不知孔明往何處去了？”州平曰：“吾亦欲訪之，正不知其何往。”玄德曰：“請先生同至敝縣，若何？”州平曰：“愚性頗樂閒散，無意功名久矣；容他日再見。”言訖，長揖而去。玄德與關、張上馬而行。張飛曰：“孔明又訪不着，却遇此腐儒，閒談許久！”玄德曰：“此亦隱者之言也。”,"Then I mounted my horse and traveled for a few miles. I stopped my horse and looked back at the scenery in Longzhong. Sure enough, the mountains were not high but elegant, the waters were not deep but clear; : Watching it endlessly. Suddenly I saw a person, with a handsome face, handsome and handsome, wearing a happy towel, wearing a soap cloth robe, and a stick and quinoa coming from a remote mountain road. Xuande said: ""This must be Mr. Wolong!"" He quickly dismounted from his horse and went forward to salute, and asked, ""Is it not Mr. Wolong?"" The man asked, ""Who is the general?"" ""I am not Kongming, but a friend of Kongming: Boling Cui Zhouping."" Xuande said: ""I have heard the name for a long time, and I am fortunate to meet. I am begging for the right to sit on the ground, please teach me a word."" The two sat opposite each other on the stone in the forest. , Guan and Zhang Shi stand on the side. Zhou Ping said, ""Why do you want to see Confucius?"" Xuande said, ""Fang is in great chaos today, and the clouds are disturbing in all directions. If you want to see Confucius, ask for the policy of peace and stability of the country."" It is benevolence, but since ancient times, the governance of chaos has been impermanent: since the Emperor Gaozu cut snakes and revolted, and punished the immoral Qin, it was from chaos and entered governance; to the two hundred years of sorrow and peace, the time of peace was long, Wang Mang usurped and revolted. Governance led to chaos; Guangwu rejuvenation, reorganization of the foundation, and chaos led to governance again; two hundred years ago, the people have been in peace for a long time, so wars have arisen again and again. The general wants to make Kong Ming mediate the heaven and the earth, and make up the universe, it is not easy to do it, and it will only take a lot of effort. Haven't you heard that ""those who follow the sky are easy, those who go against the sky are laborious"", ""where the number is, it can't be rationalized and it is taken away; where the fate is, people Can't you make it stronger?"" Xuande said: ""What the teacher said is sincere. But if you are a Han soldier, you should be able to help the Han family. How dare you entrust the number and life?"" Zhou Ping said: ""The husband of the mountains and the wild , it is not enough to discuss the affairs of the world, and it is suitable to be asked by Ming, so I am talking about it."" Xuande said: ""Mr. Meng saw you. But I don't know where Kongming went?"" Zhou Ping said: ""I also want to visit, but I don't know about it. Where are you going?"" Xuande said, ""Please, sir, come to our county with you, what is it?"" Zhou Ping said, ""The foolishness is quite happy and idle, and I don't want to be famous for a long time; let's see you tomorrow."" Xuande went on horseback with Guan and Zhang. Zhang Fei said: ""Kong Ming couldn't visit again, but he met this corrupt Confucian and chatted for a long time!"" Xuande said: ""This is also the words of a hermit.""","Humbled, Xuande says, ‘Then just say to the master that Xuande came calling.’","They rode away for some miles. Presently Liu Bei stopped and looked back at the surroundings of the little cottage in the wood. The mountains were picturesque rather than grand, the water clear rather than profound, the plain was level rather than extensive, the woods luxuriant rather than thick. Gibbons ranged through the trees, and cranes waded in the shallow water. The pines and the bamboos vied with each other in verdure. It was a scene to linger upon. While Liu Bei stood regarding it, he saw a figure coming down a mountain path. The man's bearing was lofty; he was handsome and dignified. He wore a comfortable-looking bonnet on his head, and a black robe hung about his figure in easy folds. He used a staff to help him down the steep path. “Surely that is he!” said Liu Bei. He dismounted and walked over to greet the stranger, whom he saluted deferentially, saying, “Are you not Master Sleeping-Dragon, Sir?” “Who are you, General?” said the stranger. “I am Liu Bei.” “I am not Zhuge Liang, but I am a friend of his. My name is Cui Zhouping.” “Long have I known of you! I am very glad to see you,” replied Liu Bei. “And now I pray you be seated just where we are and let me receive your instruction.” The two men sat down in the wood on a stone, and the two brothers ranged themselves by Liu Bei's side. Cui Zhouping began, saying, “General, for what reason do you wish to see Zhuge Liang?” Liu Bei replied, “The empire is in confusion and troubles gather everywhere. I want your friend to tell me how to restore order.” “You, Sir, wish to arrest the present disorder although you are a kindly man and, from the oldest antiquity, the correction of disorder has demanded stern measures. On the day that Liu Bang first put his hand to the work and slew the wicked ruler of Qin, order began to replace disorder. Good government began with the Supreme Ancestor, (BC 206), and endured two hundred years; two centuries of tranquillity. Then came Wang Mang's rebellion, and disorder took the place of order. Anon, arose Liu Xiu, who restored the Han Dynasty, and order once more prevailed. We have had two centuries of order and tranquillity, and the time of trouble and battles is due. The restoration of peace will take time; it cannot be quickly accomplished. You, Sir, wish to get Zhuge Liang to regulate times and seasons, to repair the cosmos; but I fear the task is indeed difficult and to attempt it would be a vain expenditure of mental energy. You know well that he who goes with the favor of Heaven travels an easy road, he who goes contrary meets difficulties. One cannot escape one's lot; one cannot evade fate.” “Master,” replied Liu Bei, “your insight is indeed deep, and your words of wide meaning; but I am a scion of the House of Han and must help it. Dare I talk of the inevitable and trust to fate?” Cui Zhouping replied, “A simple denizen of the mountain wilds is unfitted to discuss the affairs of empire. But you bade me speak and I have spoken; perhaps somewhat madly.” “Master, I am grateful for your instruction. But know you whither Zhuge Liang has gone?” “I also came to see him and I know not where he is,” said Cui Zhouping. “If I asked you, Master, to accompany me to my poor bit of territory, would you come?” “I am too dilatory, too fond of leisure and ease, and no longer have any ambitions. But I will see you another time.” And with these words Cui Zhouping saluted and left. The three brothers also mounted and started homeward. Presently Zhang Fei said, “We have not found Zhuge Liang, and we have had to listen to the wild ravings of this so-called scholar. There is the whole result of this journey.” “His words were those of a deep thinker,” replied Liu Bei."

却說賈見詡操敗走，急勸張繡遣書劉表，使起兵截其後路。表得書，卽欲起兵。忽探馬報孫策屯兵湖口。蒯良曰：“策屯兵湖口，乃曹操之計也。今操新敗，若不乘勢擊之，後必有患。”表乃令黃祖堅守隘口，自己統兵至安衆縣截操後路；一面約會張繡。繡知表兵已起，卽同賈詡引兵襲操。,"However, when Jia sees Xu Cao's defeat, he urgently persuades Zhang Xiu to send the book Liu Biao, so that he raises troops to cut his way. The table got the book, and I wanted to start an army. Suddenly, the horse reported that Sun Ce was stationed at the mouth of the lake. Kuailiang said, ""It is Cao Cao's plan to put troops at the entrance of the lake. The Cao Cao is now defeated. If we don't take advantage of the situation to attack him, there will be trouble later."" The way back; one side dating Zhang Xiu. Embroidery knew that the soldiers had been raised, and Yu and Jia Xu led the troops to attack the drill.","From then on there is a vicious game of cat and mouse as Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao track Cao Cao’s retreating army, attacking whenever they can.","Cao Cao being thus worsted, Jia Xu advised Zhang Xiu to write off to Liu Biao to cut off Cao Cao's retreat so that he might be utterly destroyed. Liu Biao was preparing an army for this purpose when a scout came to say that Sun Ce had encamped in the river at Hukou. Kuai Liang said, “This move of Sun Ce in the river is part of Cao Cao's strategy, and there will be never-ending regret if Cao Cao is allowed to escape. An immediate expedition is necessary.” Wherefore Liu Biao moved out with his army to Anzhong to block Cao Cao, leaving Huang Zu to hold Jingzhou's points of vantage. Zhang Xiu, having been informed of the movement of Liu Biao, went with Jia Xu to smite Cao Cao on the rear."
又有一將引軍數百人，來投曹操：乃泰山鉅平人：姓于，名禁，字文則。操見其人弓馬熟嫺，武藝出衆，命為點軍司馬。一日，夏侯惇引一大漢來見，操問何人，惇曰：“此乃陳留人：姓典，名韋，勇力過人。舊跟張邈，與帳下人不和，手殺數十人，逃竄山中。惇出射獵，見韋逐鹿過澗，因收於軍中。今特薦之於公。”操曰：“吾觀此人容貌魁梧，必有勇力。”惇曰：“他曾為友報讎殺人，提頭直出鬧市，數百人不敢近。只今所使兩枝鐵戟，重八十斤，挾之上馬，運使如飛。”操卽令韋試之。韋挾戟驟馬，往來馳騁。忽見帳下大旗為風所吹，岌岌欲倒，衆軍士挾持不定；韋下馬，喝退衆軍，一手執定旗桿，立於風中，巍然不動。操曰：“此古之惡來也！”遂命為帳前都尉，解身上錦襖，及駿馬雕鞍賜之。,"Another general led several hundred troops to join Cao Cao: he was from Juping, Mount Tai: his surname was Yu, his first name was forbidden, and his words and expressions were specified. Cao saw that he was skilled in bowing and horses and outstanding in martial arts, so he was appointed Sima of the Point Army. One day, Xiahou Dun brought a big man to see him and asked who he was. Dun said: ""This is Chen Liuren: his surname is Dian, his name is Wei. He fled into the mountains. Dun went out to hunt, and saw Wei Zhulu crossing the stream, because he was in the army. Now I recommend him to the public."" Cao said: ""I see this man with a burly face, and he must have courage."" Dun said: ""He once reported for his friends To kill people, lift their heads straight out of the downtown area, and hundreds of people dare not approach. I only use two iron halberds, weighing 80 catties, and mount them on horses, so they can be transported like flying."" Cao You ordered Wei to try it. Wei Bingji suddenly galloped back and forth. All of a sudden, the big flag under the tent was blown by the wind and was about to fall, and the soldiers were holding him tightly. Cao said: ""This ancient evil is coming!"" He ordered him to be the prefect of the tent, and he took off his brocade jacket and gave him a horse with a carved saddle.","When the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si wonder who can tackle this uprising they are recommended to call upon Cao Cao. Within a short period of time Cao Cao has defeated the rebels and has received the surrender of over three hundred thousand former Yellow Headband rebels. From among them he chooses the best to join his own army. Basing himself in Yanzhou, away from the capital, he in effect builds up his own court, drawing into his service many wise and worthy individuals. Now that he has become so powerful, he decides to bring his father and the whole of his family to Yanzhou so they can see how important he is. Thus it is that the whole family – over forty members, around one hundred servants and over one hundred wagons piled high with their goods – set out on the long journey to Yanzhou. They pass through Xuzhou, where the imperial governor is Tao Qian. He is a genuinely good man, who meets them as they enter his territory and hosts them in the city. He then gives a former Yellow Headband rebel leader, Zhang Kai, and his men the task of escorting Cao Cao’s family to the border.","Then a famous leader, with his troop of some hundreds, arrived to offer service. This was Yu Jin of Taishan, an expert horseman and archer, and skilled beyond his fellows in every form of military exercise. He was made an army inspector. Then another day Xiahou Dun brought a fellow to present to Cao Cao. “Who is he?” asked Cao Cao. “He is from Chenliu and is named Dian Wei. He is the boldest of the bold, the strongest of the strong. He was one of Zhang Miao's people, but quarreled with his tent companions and killed some dozens of them with his fists. Then he fled to the mountains where I found him. I was out shooting and saw him follow a tiger across a stream. I persuaded him to join my troop and I recommend him.” “I see he is no ordinary man,” said Cao Cao. “He is fine and straight and looks very powerful and bold.” “He is. He killed a man once to avenge a friend and carried his head through the whole market place. Hundreds saw him, but dared not come near. The weapon he uses now is a couple of spears, each weighs a hundred and twenty pounds, and he vaults into the saddle with these under his arm.” Cao Cao bade the man give proof of his skill. So Dian Wei galloped to and fro carrying the spears. Then he saw away among the tents a huge banner swaying dangerously with the force of the wind and on the point of falling. A crowd of soldiers were vainly struggling to keep it steady. Down he leaped, shouted to the men to clear out and held the staff quite steady with one hand, keeping it perfectly upright in spite of the strong wind. “This is old E Lai again,” said Cao Cao. He gave Dian Wei a post in the headquarters and besides made Dian Wei presents of an embroidered robe he was wearing and a swift steed with a handsome saddle."

酒至半酣，忽陰雲漠漠，驟雨將至。從人遙指天外龍挂，操與玄德凭欄觀之。操曰：“使君知龍之變化否？”玄德曰：“未知其詳。”操曰：“龍能大能小，能升能隱；大則興雲吐霧，小則隱介藏形；升則飛騰於宇宙之間，隱則潛伏於波濤之內。方今春深，龍乘時變化，猶人得志而縱橫四海。龍之為物，可比世之英雄。玄德久歷四方，必知當世英雄。請試指言之。”玄德曰：“備肉眼安識英雄？”操曰：“休得過謙。”玄德曰：“備叨恩庇，得仕於朝。天下英雄，實有未知。”操曰：“旣不識其面，亦聞其名。”玄德曰：“淮南袁術，兵糧足備，可為英雄？”操笑曰：“塚中枯骨，吾早晚必擒之！”玄德曰：“河北袁紹，四世三公，門多故吏；今虎踞冀州之地，部下能事者極多，可為英雄？”操笑曰：“袁紹色厲膽薄，好謀無斷；幹大事而惜身，見小利而忘命：非英雄也。”玄德曰：“有一人名稱八俊，威鎮九州——劉景升可為英雄？”操曰：“劉表虛名無實，非英雄也。”玄德曰：“有一人血氣方剛，江東領袖——孫伯符乃英雄也？”操曰：“孫策藉父之名，非英雄也。”玄德曰：“益州劉季玉，可為英雄乎？”操曰：“劉璋雖係宗室，乃守戶之犬耳，何足為英雄！”玄德曰：“如張繡、張魯、韓遂等輩皆何如？”操鼓掌大笑曰：“此等碌碌小人，何足挂齒！”玄德曰：“舍此之外，備實不知。”操曰：“夫英雄者：胸懷大志，腹有良謀，有包藏宇宙之機，吞吐天地之志者也。”玄德曰：“誰能當之？”操以手指玄德，後自指曰：“今天下英雄，惟使君與操耳。”玄德聞言，吃了一驚，手中所執匙筯，不覺落於地下。時正值天雨將至，雷聲大作。玄德乃從容俯首拾筯曰：“一震之威，乃至於此。”操笑曰：“丈夫亦畏雷乎？”玄德曰：“聖人迅雷風烈必變，安得不畏？”將聞言失筯緣故，輕輕掩飾過了。操遂不疑玄德。後人有詩讚曰：,"The wine was half intoxicated, suddenly cloudy and cloudy, and a shower was coming. From the person pointing to the dragon hanging outside the sky, Cao and Xuande watched it from the railing. Cao said: ""Do you know the changes of the dragon?"" Xuande said, ""I don't know the details."" Cao said: ""The dragon can be great and small, and it can be raised and hidden; when it is big, it can exude clouds and mist, and when it is small, it can hide and hide. Form; when rising, it soars between the universe, and when it is hidden, it lurks in the waves. This spring is deep, and the dragon is changing with time, and the people are determined to go across the world. The dragon is a thing, comparable to the hero of the world. Xuande has been in the four directions for a long time, You must know the heroes of the world. Please try to point them out."" Xuande said, ""Prepare the naked eye to recognize heroes?"" Cao said, ""Don't be too humble."" Xuande said, ""Be prepared to be blessed and be an official in the dynasty. Heroes, there are really unknowns."" Cao said: ""I don't know his face, but I also heard his name."" Xuande said: ""Huainan Yuan Shu, who has enough troops and supplies, can be a hero?"" Cao laughed: ""The bones in the tomb, I Sooner or later, they will be captured!” Xuande said, “Hebei Yuan Shao, the fourth and third princes, and many old officials; now the tigers occupy the land of Jizhou, and there are many subordinates who are capable of doing things, so can they be heroes?” Cao laughed and said: “Yuan Shao is serious Cowardly, willing to be relentless; cherishing one's body when doing big things, forgetting one's life when seeing small profits: not a hero."" Xuande said: ""There is a person named Ba Jun, who is in the prestige town of Kyushu - Liu Jingsheng can be a hero?"" Cao said ""Liu Biao has no real name and is not a hero."" Xuande said: ""There is a man with strong blood and energy, and the leader of Jiangdong, Sun Bofu, is a hero?"" Cao said: ""Sun Ce is not a hero by taking the name of his father."" Xuande De said: ""Yizhou Liu Jiyu, can he be a hero?"" Cao said: ""Although Liu Zhang is a clan, he is the dog's ear of the household, so how can he be a hero?"" Xuande said: ""If Zhang Xiu, Zhang Lu, Han Sui, etc. How are they all?"" Cao applauded and laughed and said, ""Why are you talking about such mediocre little people?"" Xuande said, ""Apart from this, I don't know what the preparation is."" Those who have good plans, have the opportunity to hide the universe, and have the will to swallow up the heaven and the earth.” Xuande said, “Who can be the one?” He pointed to Xuande, and then pointed to himself: “Today, the hero is only the ruler and the ruler. Ears."" Xuande was shocked when he heard the words, and the spoon in his hand fell to the ground without realizing it. It was raining and thunder was coming. Xuande calmly bowed his head and picked up the reeds and said, ""The power of a shock is even this."" He laughed and said, ""Is your husband also afraid of thunder?"" Xuande said: ""The saint will change when thunder and wind are strong, so he is not afraid of it?"" The reason why he heard the words was lost, and he lightly concealed it. Cao then did not doubt Xuande. A later poem praised:","‘Not a lot,’ confesses Xuande. ‘Dragons, you know,’ says Cao Cao, ‘can be any size, either large or small. They can fly in the sky or disappear into the depths. Large, they can create clouds and pour forth mists. Small, they can disappear from sight altogether. Soaring up, they reach Heaven itself. Sinking down, they lie at the very bottom of the sea. This is now springtime. This is the season when dragons rise to the occasion. Like a man who wants to rule the whole world. These dragons are the greatest – just as heroes in any age are the greatest. Now, you are well travelled. Who are the greatest heroes of our age?’ Xuande knows he has to answer this very, very carefully so as not to stir up the anger or resentment of Cao Cao. ‘Yuan Shu?’ he says cautiously. Laughing, Cao Cao replies, ‘Just old bones in a grave!’ ‘Yuan Shao?’ to which Cao Cao responds, ‘Fierce, it’s true, but weak. He likes plotting but hates making a decision. He wants to win but will never take the risks involved. But offer him something of minor significance and he will go all out for it! So I don’t think he really is hero material, do you?’ So Xuande asks about Liu Biao. ‘A person with no reputation,’ snaps Cao Cao. ‘Sun Ce?’ asks Xuande. ‘ He just relies on his father’s greater reputation,’ replies Cao Cao. ‘Liu Zhang?’ ventures Xuande, only to be told that, ‘Although of the royal family, he’s just a dog guarding the gate.’ Then, in despair, Xuande rattles off a list of others, to which Cao Cao dismissively replies that they are of no significance at all. Finally Xuande has to admit, ‘There’s no one else I can think of.’ Smiling, Cao Cao leans forward and says:","As they drank, the weather gradually changed, clouds gathering and threatening rain. The servants pointed out a mass of cloud that looked like a dragon hung in the sky. Both host and guest leaned over the balcony looking at it. “Do you understand the evolution of dragons?” asked Cao Cao of the guest. “Not in detail.” “A dragon can assume any size, can rise in glory or hide from sight. Bulky, it generates clouds and evolves mist; attenuated, it can scarcely hide a mustard stalk or conceal a shadow. Mounting, it can soar to the empyrean; subsiding, it lurks in the uttermost depths of the ocean. This is the midspring season, and the dragon chooses this moment for its transformations like a person realizing own desires and overrunning the world. The dragon among animals compares with the hero among humans. You, General, have traveled all lakes and rivers; you must know who are the heroes of the present day, and I wish you would say who they are.” “I am just a common dullard; how can I know such things?” “Do not be so modest.” “Thanks to your kindly protection I have a post at court. But as to heroes I really do not know who they are.” “You may not have looked upon their faces, but you have heard their names.” “Yuan Shu of the South of River Huai, with his strong army and abundant resources; is he one?” His host laughed, “A rotting skeleton in a graveyard. I shall put him out of the way shortly.” “Well, Yuan Shao then. The highest offices of state have been held in his family for four generations, and his clients are many in the empire. He is firmly posted in Jizhou, and he commands the services of many able people. Surely he is one.” “A bully, but a coward; he is fond of grandiose schemes, but is devoid of decision; he makes for great things but grudges the necessary sacrifice. He loses sight of everything else in view of a little present advantage. He is not one.” “There is Liu Biao of Jingzhou. He is renowned as a man of perfection, whose fame has spread on all sides. Surely he is a hero.” “He is a mere semblance, a man of vain reputation. No; not he.” “Sun Ce is a sturdy sort, the chief of all in the South Land. Is he a hero?” “He has profited by the reputation of his father, Sun Jian; he is not a real hero.” “What of Liu Zhang of Yiazhou?” “Though he is of the reigning family, he is nothing more than a watch dog. How could you make a hero of him?” “What about Zhang Xiu, Zhang Lu, Han Sui, and all those leaders?” Cao Cao clapped his hands and laughed very loudly, saying, “Paltry people like them are not worth mentioning.” “With these exceptions I really know none.” “Now heroes are the ones who cherish lofty designs in their bosoms and have plans to achieve them; they have all-embracing schemes, and the whole world is at their mercy.” “Who is such a person?” said Liu Bei. Cao Cao pointed his finger first at his guest and then at himself, saying, “The only heroes in the world are you and I.” Liu Bei gasped, and the spoon and chopsticks rattled to the floor. Now just at that moment the storm burst with a tremendous peal of thunder and rush of rain. Liu Bei stooped down to recover the fallen articles, saying, “What a shock! And it was quite close.” “What! Are you afraid of thunder?” said Cao Cao. Liu Bei replied, “The Sage One paled at a sudden peal of thunder or fierce gust of wind. Why should one not fear?” Thus he glossed over the real fact, that it was the words he had heard that had so startled him. Constrained to lodge in a tiger's lair, He played a waiting part,"
且說李傕、郭汜、張濟、樊稠逃居陝西，使人至長安上表求赦。王允曰：“卓之跋扈，皆此四人助之；今雖大赦天下，獨不赦此四人。”使者回報李傕。傕曰：“求赦不得，各自逃生可也。”謀士賈詡曰：“諸君若棄軍單行，則一亭長能縛君矣。不若誘集陝人，并本部軍馬，殺入長安，與董卓報讎。事濟，奉朝廷以正天下；若其不勝，走亦未遲。”傕等然其說，遂流言於西涼州曰：“王允將欲洗蕩此方之人矣。”衆皆驚惶。乃復揚言曰：“徒死無益，能從我反乎？”衆皆願從。於是聚衆十餘萬，分作四路，殺奔長安來。路逢董卓女壻中郎將牛輔，引軍五千人，欲去與丈人報讎，李傕便與合兵，使為前驅，四人陸續進發。,"Moreover, Li Jue, Guo Si, Zhang Ji, and Fan Chou fled to Shaanxi, and sent people to Chang'an to ask for pardon. Wang Yun said: ""Zhuozhi is domineering, and all these four people help him; although the world has been pardoned, only these four people will not be pardoned."" The envoy returned Li Jue. Jue said, ""If you can't ask for forgiveness, you can escape separately."" Jia Xu, the advisor, said, ""If you lords abandon the army and go alone, then a pavilion leader will be able to bind the lord. It is better to entice the people of Shaanxi, together with the army and horses, to enter Chang'an. I will report to Dong Zhuo. I will give the imperial court to rectify the world. If it does not win, it will not be too late to go."" Jue and others said it, and then rumors circulated in Xiliang Prefecture, saying: ""Wang Yun wants to wipe out the people in this area. ."" Everyone panicked. Naifu threatened, ""It's useless to die, so can you follow me?"" Everyone was willing to follow. So they gathered more than 100,000 people, divided them into four groups, and rushed to Chang'an. When Lu met Dong Zhuo's daughter Feng Zhonglang's general Niu Fu, who led an army of 5,000 people, and wanted to go to report to her husband, Li Jue joined forces with him and made him the forerunner, and the four of them advanced one after another.","Former generals under Dong Zhuo, fearing for their lives, seek forgiveness from Wang Yun.","Those generals—Li Jue, Guo Si, Fan Chou, and Zhang Ji—whom Dong Zhuo had left to guard Meiwo fled when their master was slain and went into the county of Shanxi in Liangzhou Region. Thence they sent in a memorial entreating amnesty. But Wang Yun would not hear of it. “Four of them were the chief instruments of Dong Zhuo's aggressions. Now though a general amnesty were proclaimed, these men should be excluded from its benefit,” said Wang Yun. The messenger returned and told the four there was no hope of pardon and they could only flee. Then their adviser, Jia Xu, said, “If we throw away our arms and flee singly, then we shall fall easy victims to any village beadle who may seize us. Rather let us cajole the Shanxi people to throw in their lot with us and make a sudden onslaught on the capital and so avenge Dong Zhuo. If we succeed, we control the court and the empire. There will be enough time to run away if we fail.” The plan was adopted, and they spread abroad the story that Wang Yun intended to massacre the county. Having thus thrown the people into a state of terror, they went a step farther and said, “There is no advantage in dying for nothing. Revolt and join us!” So they cajoled the people into joining them and gathered a host equal to one hundred thousand. This horde was divided into four parts, and they all set out to raid Capital Changan. On the way they fell in with a son-in-law of their late chief, Imperial Commander Niu Fu, who marched five thousand troop from Xiliang.

却說劉玄德自得荊州、南郡、襄陽，心中大喜，商議久遠之計。忽見一人上廳獻策，視之，乃伊籍也。玄德感其舊日之恩，十分相敬，坐而問之。籍曰：“要知荊州久遠之計，何不求賢士以問之？”玄德曰：“賢士安在？”籍曰：“荊襄馬氏兄弟五人，並有才名：幼者名謖，字幼常；其最賢者，眉間有白毛，名良，字季常。鄕里為之諺曰：‘馬氏五常，白眉最良。’公何不求此人而與之謀？”玄德遂命請之。馬良至，玄德優禮相待，請問保守荊襄之策。良曰：“荊襄四面受敵之地，恐不可久守；可令公子劉琦於此養病，招諭舊人以守之，就表奏公子為荊州刺史，以安民心。然後南征武陵、長沙、桂陽、零陵四郡，積收錢糧，以為根本：此久遠之計也。”玄德大喜，遂問：“四郡當先取何郡？”良曰：“湘江之西，零陵最近，可先取之。次取武陵。然後湘江之東取桂陽。長沙為後。”玄德遂用馬良為從事，伊籍副之。請孔明商議送劉琦回襄陽，替雲長回荊州。便調兵取零陵，差張飛為先鋒，趙雲合後，孔明、玄德為中軍，人馬一萬五千；留雲長守荊州；糜竺、劉封守江陵。,"However, Liu Xuande said that he was very happy in Jingzhou, Nanjun, and Xiangyang, and discussed a long-term plan. Suddenly I saw a person coming up to the hall to offer advice, and I regarded him as an Iraqi. Xuande felt his kindness in the old days and respected each other very much, so he sat down and asked him. Ji said: ""If you want to know the long-term plan of Jingzhou, why not ask the wise men to ask them?"" Xuande said, ""Where are the wise men?"" Ji said: ""There are five brothers from the Ma clan in Jingxiang, and they have talented names: the young ones are named Su. , the character is Youchang; the most wise man has white hair between his eyebrows, and his name is good. So ordered to ask. Ma Liangzhi, Xuande treated each other with courtesy, and asked about the strategy of keeping Jingxiang. Liang said: ""Jingxiang is surrounded by enemies on all sides, and I'm afraid I won't be able to defend it for a long time; I can order the son Liu Qi to recover from his illness here, and enlist the old people to guard him, and then make the son the prefect of Jingzhou, so as to reassure the hearts of the people. The four counties of Guiyang and Lingling have collected money and grain, thinking it is fundamental: this is a long-term plan."" Xuande was overjoyed, and asked, ""Which county should the four counties take first?"" Liang said: ""West of the Xiangjiang River, Lingling is the closest. You can take it first. Take Wuling next. Then take Guiyang to the east of the Xiangjiang River. Changsha is the second."" Ask Kong Ming to negotiate to send Liu Qi back to Xiangyang and return to Jingzhou for Yunchang. Then they transferred troops to take Lingling, and sent Zhang Fei as the vanguard. After Zhao Yunhe, Kongming and Xuande were the central army, with 15,000 troops; Liu Yunchang guarded Jingzhou; Mi Zhu and Liu Feng guarded Jiangling.","Back again to Xuande. His problem is how to retain his recent gains. His friend Yi Ji, who saved his life from Cai Mao’s plot, suggests that there are highly prized scholars in the area who could help. They are the five brothers of the Ma family, renowned for their skills and wisdom. The foremost is Ma Liang, and Xuande sends for him. ‘My advice,’ says Ma Liang, ‘is that you need to secure Jingzhou by increasing the status of Liu Qi. Ask the emperor to make him imperial governor of Jingzhou, surround him with former leaders of the province and let the young man recover his health while controlling, through his family reputation, the city. The local people will be happy with this. Then you’ll be free to march south to take Wuling, Changsha, Guiyang and Lingling. There you’ll have a much more secure base, with money and food aplenty. My suggestion is that you take Lingling first, then Wuling. Then go east of the river and take Guiyang and finally Changsha.’ Xuande is delighted with this advice and sends Zhang Fei to attack Lingling.","Liu Bei was exceedingly well satisfied with the possession of his new region, and his thoughts turned to more ambitious schemes. Then a certain man came to him to suggest a plan. This man was Yi Ji and, remembering the kindly feeling of other days, Liu Bei received him most graciously. When Yi Ji was seated, and his host had asked what he proposed, he said, “You wish for a plan to accomplish yet greater deeds; why not seek wise people and ask them?” “Where are these wise people to be found?” asked Liu Bei. Yi Ji replied, “In this region there is a certain family named Ma, five brothers, all of whom are known as men of ability. The youngest is called Ma Su. The ablest is Ma Liang, who has white hairs in his eyebrows, and the villagers have a little rhyming couplet that means 'There are five sons in the family Ma, but white eyebrows is the best of them.' You should get this man to draw up a plan for you.” So Liu Bei told them to request his presence. Ma Liang came and was received with great respect. He was asked to suggest a plan for the security of the newly acquired region, and he said, “Attacked as it is on all sides, this region is not one in which one is permanently secure. You should let Liu Qi remain here till he is recovered from his present illness; the actual protection of the place being left in the hands of trusty friends. Obtain an edict appointing him Imperial Protector of Jingzhou, and the people will be content. Then conquer Wuling, Changsha, Guiyang, and Lingling; and with the resources you will thus acquire, you will have the means for further plans. That should be your policy.” “Which of the four territories should be first taken?” asked Liu Bei. “The nearest, Lingling, which lies in the west of River Xiang. The next is Wuling, and after these the other two.” Ma Liang was given an appointment as Imperial Protector Assistant, with Yi Ji as his second. Then Liu Bei consulted Zhuge Liang about sending Liu Qi to Xiangyang, so that Guan Yu could be free to return. Next they made preparations to attack Lingling, and Zhang Fei was to lead the van. Zhao Yun was to guard the rear, while Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang were to command the main body. A fifteen thousand troops were left to hold Jingzhou. Mi Zhu and Liu Feng were left to guard Jiangling."
承尊命使決進退之疑：愚以袁紹悉衆聚於官渡，欲與明公決勝負，公以至弱當至強，若不能制，必為所乘：是天下之大機也。紹軍雖衆，而不能用；以公之神武明哲，何向而不濟？今軍實雖少，未若楚、漢在滎陽、成皐間也。公今畫地而守，扼其喉而使不能進，情見勢竭，必將有變。此用奇之時，斷不可失：惟明公裁察焉。,"Cheng Zun ordered the decision to advance and retreat doubts: Foolishly, Yuan Shao gathered a crowd at Guandu and wanted to decide the victory or defeat with Duke Ming. The Duke should be the weakest and the strongest. If he can't control it, he will take advantage of it. Although Shao's army is numerous, it cannot be used; with the god of the public, Wu Mingzhe, why can't it help? Although the army is small today, it is not as good as Chu and Han in Xingyang and Chenggao. The public is now painting the ground and defending, choking his throat and making it impossible to enter, seeing that the situation is exhausted, there will be changes. When this use is strange, it must not be lost: only the public judge will be aware of it.","One day, Cao Cao’s men capture a spy and find out from him that Yuan Shao is expecting a huge convoy of grain wagons within the next few days, led by Commander Han Meng.","“I have received your command to decide whether to continue the campaign or retire. It appears to me that Yuan Shao assembled such large forces at Guandu with the expectation of winning a decision. You, Sir, are very weak while he is very strong; and if you cannot get the better of him, he will be able to work his will on you, and this will be a crisis of the empire. Your opponents are indeed numerous, but their leader knows not how to use them. With your military genius and discernment, where are you not sure to succeed? Now though your numbers are small, your situation is still brighter than Liu Bang's when he faced against Xiang Yu in Jungyang and Chenggao. You are securely entrenched with your hands on Yuan Shao's throat; and even if you cannot advance, that state of things cannot endure forever but must change. This is the time to play some unexpected move, and you must not miss it. The device I leave to your illustrious ingenuity.”"

一日，孫策引軍會獵於丹徒之西山，趕起一大鹿，策縱馬上山逐之。正趕之間，只見樹林之內有三個人持鎗帶弓而立。策勒馬問曰：“汝等何人？”答曰：“乃韓當軍士也。在此射鹿。”策方舉轡欲行，一人拈鎗望策左腿便刺。策大驚，急取佩劍從馬上砍去，劍刃忽墜，止存劍靶在手。一人早拈弓搭箭射來，正中孫策面頰。策就拔面上箭，取弓回射放箭之人，應弦而倒。那二人舉鎗向孫策亂搠，大叫曰：“我等是許貢家客，特來為主人報讎！”策別無器械，只以弓拒之，且拒且走。二人死戰不退。策身被數鎗，馬亦帶傷。正危急之時，程普引數人至。孫策大叫：“殺賊！”程普引衆齊上，將許貢家客砍為肉泥。看孫策時，血流滿面，被傷至重；乃以刀割袍，裹其傷處，救回吳會養病。後人有詩贊許家三客曰：,"One day, Sun Ce led an army to hunt on the west mountain of Dantu, drove up a large deer, and led a horse to chase it away. Just in time, I saw three people standing in the woods with guns and bows. Ce Lema asked, ""Who are you waiting for?"" He replied, ""He is a sergeant of Han. He shoots the deer here."" Ce was shocked, and hurriedly took the saber and chopped it off from the horse. One person came early with a bow and an arrow, hitting Sun Ce on the cheek. Ce drew the arrow on the face, took the bow and shot the arrow back, and fell in response to the string. The two raised their spears and shouted at Sun Ce, ""I'm waiting for Xu Gong's family, and I've come here to report to the master!"" The two fought to the death. The body was shot several times, and the horse was also injured. At a critical time, Cheng Pu brought in a number of people. Sun Ce shouted, ""Kill the thief!"" Cheng Pu led the crowd up and chopped Xu Gong's guests into minced meat. When he saw Sun Ce, his face was covered with blood, and he was seriously injured; he cut his robe with a knife, wrapped his wounds, and rescued Wu Hui to recuperate. Later generations have a poem to praise the three guests of the family, saying:","One day he is out hunting when three assassins jump him. He is alone and he fights back as hard as he can. His sword breaks, and all he has left to defend himself with is his bow. The attackers spear, shoot and slash him in their desperate bid to kill him. At last his own men come to the rescue and slay the three assassins.","One day Sun Ce went hunting in the hills to the west of Dantu. A stag was started, and Sun Ce pressed after it at topmost speed and followed it deep into the forest. Presently he came upon three armed men standing among the trees. Rather surprised to see them there, he reined in and asked who they were. “We belong to Han Dang's army and are shooting deer,” was the reply. So Sun Ce shook his bridle to proceed. But just as he did so, one of the men thrust at him with a spear and wounded his thigh. Sun Ce drew the sword at his side, dashed forward, and tried to cut down the aggressor. The blade of his sword suddenly fell to the ground, only the hilt remaining in his hand. Then one of the assassins drew his bow, and an arrow wounded Sun Ce in the cheek. Sun Ce plucked out the arrow and shot at the offender, who fell, but the other two attacked him furiously with their spears, shouting, “We are Xu Gong's men and his avengers!” Sun Ce then understood. But he had no weapons save his bow against them. He tried to draw off, keeping them at bay striking with his bow; but the fight was getting too much for him, and both he and his steed were wounded in several places. However, just at the critical moment, Cheng Pu and some of his own officers came up, and they minced the assassins into pieces. But their lord was in a sorry plight. His face was streaming with blood, and some of the wounds were very severe. They tore up his robe and therewith bound up his wounds, and they carried him home. A poem in praise of the three avengers says:"
却說喬國老旣見玄德，使入見吳國太賀喜。國太曰：“有何喜事？”喬國老曰：“令愛已許劉玄德為夫人，今玄德已到，何故相瞞？”國太驚曰：“老身不知此事！”便使人請吳侯問虛實，一面先使人於城中探聽。人皆回報：“果有此事。女壻已在館驛安歇。五百隨行軍都在城中買猪羊果品，準備成親。做媒的女家是呂範，男家是孫乾，俱在館驛中相待。”國太吃了一驚。少頃，孫權入後堂見母親。國太搥胸大哭。權曰：“母親何故煩惱？”國太曰：“你直如此將我看承得如無物！我姐姐臨危之時，分付你甚麼話來？”孫權失驚曰：“母親有話明說，何苦如此？”國太曰：“男大須婚，女大須嫁，古今常理。我為你母親，事當稟命於我。你招劉玄德為壻，如何瞞我？女兒須是我的！”權吃了一驚，問曰：“那裏得這話來？”國太曰：“若要不知，除非莫為。滿城百姓，那一個不知？你倒瞞我！”喬國老曰：“老夫已知多日了，今特來賀喜。”權曰：“非也：此是周瑜之計。因要取荊州，故將此為名，賺劉備來拘囚在此，要他把荊州來換；若其不從，先斬劉備。此是計策，非實意也。”國太大怒，罵周瑜曰：“汝做六郡八十一州大都督，直恁無條計策去取荊州，却將我女兒為名，使美人計！殺了劉備，我女便是望門寡，明日再怎的說親？須誤了我女兒一世！你們好做作！”喬國老曰：“若用此計，便得荊州，也被天下恥笑。此事如何行得！”說得孫權默然無語。,"However, he said that the old man of Qiao Guo met Xuande and made him meet Wu Guotai Hexi. Guotai said, ""What's the happy event?"" Qiao Guolao said, ""Ling Ai has promised Liu Xuande as his wife, and now Xuande has arrived, why do you hide it?"" Guotai was shocked and said, ""I don't know about this!"" When the Marquis of Wu asked the truth, he first sent people to listen to him in the city. Everyone reported: ""If this is the case. The girl has already rested in the pavilion. The five hundred marching troops are all buying pigs and sheep in the city and preparing to get married. The matchmaker is Lv Fan, and the man is Sun Qian, both of them are in the pavilion. Waiting for each other in the station."" Guo Tai was taken aback. After a while, Sun Quan entered the back hall to see his mother. Guotai beat his chest and cried. Quan said, ""Why is my mother so troubled?"" Guotai said, ""You treat me like nothing! When my sister is in danger, what will I tell you?"" Sun Quan was startled and said, ""Mother has something to say. ""Why do you have to do this?"" Guo Tai said: ""Men must be married, and women must be married. It is common sense in ancient and modern times. I am your mother, and you should tell me everything. You recruited Liu Xuande as Feng, how did you hide it from me? The daughter must be mine!"" Quan Taken aback, he asked, ""Where do you get this?"" Guotai said, ""If you don't know, you have to do nothing. The people in the city don't know who they are? You lied to me!"" Qiao Guolao said, ""Old man I've known for a long time, so I'm here to congratulate you."" Quan said: ""No, this is Zhou Yu's plan. Because he wants to take Jingzhou, it is named after Liu Bei to be detained and imprisoned here, and he wants him to exchange Jingzhou; If he doesn't follow suit, he will kill Liu Bei first. This is a tactic, not a real intention."" The emperor was angry and scolded Zhou Yu, saying, ""You are the governor of the six counties and eighty-one prefectures. In the name of my daughter, make a beauty trick! If I kill Liu Bei, my daughter will be a widow. How can I say kiss tomorrow? I must miss my daughter! , then he won Jingzhou, and was ridiculed by the world. How can this be done!"" Sun Quan was speechless.","Elder Statesman Qiao goes immediately to convey his congratulations to the queen mother. ‘ What exactly,’ asks a rather surprised queen mother, ‘is it that you wish to congratulate me upon?’ ‘Why, the engagement of your dear daughter to Xuande, of course,’ says an equally surprised Elder Statesman Qiao. ‘Are you trying to make a fool of me? I know nothing about this!’ And so saying, she summons her son to come immediately to see her. While she awaits his arrival, one of her servants has come back to report that the rumour is true. ‘There are soldiers of Lord Xuande everywhere buying things for the wedding. Lü Fan negotiated this, and Xuande and Sun Qian are resting in the state guest house.’ When Sun Quan arrives it is to find his mother beating her breast and weeping. ‘What’s the matter, Mother?’ asks a worried Sun Quan. ‘What’s the matter? Is this how you treat me, as if I’m a person of no consequence? Have you already forgotten the last words of my older sister?’ A very troubled Sun Quan replies, ‘What are you talking about, Mother? Please just tell me frankly why you’re so upset!’ ‘It’s of course natural that a man should marry a woman. So it’s been since time immemorial. In case you’ve forgotten, I’m your mother and I should have been asked for my approval first. How could you not tell me your sister is to marry Xuande. Is she not also my daughter?’ ‘Where did you hear this?’ asks a now very worried Sun Quan. ‘Are you claiming you know nothing about this? The whole city knows about it, but you forgot to tell me, your mother – her mother!’ Elder Statesman Qiao chips in, saying, ‘Indeed, I heard about this sometime ago and came simply to convey my congratulations!’ ‘No, no,’ cries a very agitated Sun Quan. ‘You’ve got it all wrong. This is a plot by Zhou Yu to get back Jingzhou. By pretending there’ll be a wedding, we’ve fooled Xuande into coming so we can hold him as a prisoner until he’s ransomed by giving us back Jingzhou. If that doesn’t happen, then we can kill him. It’s just a plot. We never intended that there would be an actual wedding!’ Far from calming his mother, this only infuriates her even more. She takes out her wrath on Zhou Yu, saying, ‘So despite being head of the army he cannot work out how to get Jingzhou back? His only weapon is to use my daughter as a foil! Can you imagine anyone wanting to marry her after this scandal breaks? You will ruin her!’ Elder Statesman Qiao adds his pennyworth by saying, ‘Even if this worked, imagine how ridiculous we would appear to the whole world! It’ll never work.’ Sun Quan sits in deep depression while his mother continues to vent her wrath upon him.","Meanwhile the State Patriarch Qiao went to the Dowager Marchioness, mother of Sun Quan, to congratulate her on the happy event. “What happy event?” ejaculated the old lady. “The betrothal of your beloved daughter to Liu Bei. And he has arrived too, as surely you know.” “My poor old self does not know;” said the Dowager, “I have heard nothing of all this.” She at once summoned her son and also sent her servants out into the town to see what was going about. They quickly returned to say: “The whole city know of the coming wedding, and the bridegroom is now at the guest-house. Moreover, he has come with a large escort, and they are spending freely, buying pork and mutton and fruits, all in readiness for the wedding feasting. Lu Fan and Sun Qian are the intermediaries on each side, and they are in the guest-house too.” The Dowager Marchioness was terribly taken aback and upset so that, when Sun Quan arrived, he found his mother beating her breast and weeping bitterly. “What has disturbed you, Mother?” asked he. “What you have just done,” said she. “You have treated me as a nonentity. When my elder sister lay dying, what did she tell you?” Sun Quan began to be frightened, but he said boldly, “Please speak out plainly, Mother; what is this great sorrow?” “When a son is grown he takes a wife, and when a girl is old enough she goes to her husband. And that is right and proper. But I am the mother, and you ought to have told me that your sister was to become the wife of Liu Bei. Why did you keep me in the dark? It was my place to promise her in marriage.” “Whence comes this story?” said the Marquis, really much frightened. “Do you pretend ignorance? There is not a soul in the city who does not know! But you have succeeded in keeping me in the dark.” “I heard it several days ago,” said the State Patriarch Qiao. “And I came just now to offer my felicitations.” “There is no such thing,” said Sun Quan. “It is just one of the ruses of Zhou Yu to get hold of Jingzhou. He has used this means to inveigle Liu Bei here and hold him captive till Jingzhou is restored to us. And if they will not give it back, then Liu Bei will be put to death. That is the plot. There is no real marriage.” But the Dowager was in a rage and vented her wrath in abusing Zhou Yu. She said, “Zhou Yu is a pretty sort of governor over the six territories and eighty-one counties if he cannot find any means of recovering one region except making use of my child as a decoy. Truly this is a fine deed, to spoil the whole of my child's life and condemn her to perpetual widowhood, because he wants to use the fair damsel ruse to slay a man! Who will ever come to talk of marriage with her after this?” Said the State Patriarch Qiao, “By this means you may indeed recover Jingzhou, but you will be a shameful laughing stock to all the world. What can be done?” Sun Quan had nothing to say; he could only hang his head, while the Dowager abused his general."

The two discussed in the boat. Lu Su said to Kong Ming, ""Sir, when you see General Sun, you must not tell the truth that Cao Cao's troops are numerous and general."" Kong Ming said, ""No need for Zijing's warning, and Liang will have his own answer."" After a short break in the post, I went to see Sun Quan first. Quan Zheng was gathering Wen Wu in the hall to discuss matters. Hearing Lu Su's return, he urgently summoned him and asked: ""Zijing is going to Jiangxia, what is the situation?"" Shisu said, ""Cao sent an envoy to this place, and Gu Xian sent an envoy, and now the congregation has not yet decided."" Su received Xuwen to watch. It briefly says:","When they arrive at Chaisang, Kong Ming is given rooms in which to rest while Lu Su goes to see Sun Quan. He has just received a letter from Cao Cao, which, using the most formal imperial language of command, suggests – really almost orders – that Sun Quan join Cao Cao in attacking Xuande.","In the boat on the way to Chaisang, the two travelers beguiled the time by discussing affairs. Lu Su impressed upon his companion, saying, “When you see my master, do not reveal the truth about the magnitude of Cao Cao's army.” “You do not have to remind me,” replied Zhuge Liang, “but I shall know how to reply.” When the boat arrived, Zhuge Liang was lodged in the guests' quarters, and Lu Su went alone to see his master. Lu Su found Sun Quan actually at a council, assembled to consider the situation. Lu Su was summoned thereto and questioned at once upon what he had discovered. “I know the general outline, but I want a little time to prepare my report,” replied Lu Su. Then Sun Quan produced Cao Cao's letter and gave it to Lu Su. “That came yesterday. I have sent the bearer of it back, and this gathering is to consider the reply,” said he. Lu Su read the letter:"

却說曹操寨中，聽得擂鼓吶喊，毛玠、于禁二人慌忙飛報曹操。操傳令曰：“重霧迷江，彼軍忽至，必有埋伏，切不可輕動。可撥水軍弓弩手亂箭射之。”又差人往旱寨內喚張遼、徐晃各帶弓弩軍三千，火速到江邊助射。比及號令到來，毛玠、于禁怕南軍搶入水寨，已差弓弩手在寨前放箭；少頃，旱寨內弓弩手亦到，約一萬餘人，盡皆向江中放箭：箭如雨發。孔明敎把船弔回，頭東尾西，逼近水寨受箭，一面擂鼓吶喊。待至日高霧散，孔明令收船急回。二十隻船兩邊束草上，排滿箭枝。孔明令各船上軍士齊聲叫曰：“謝丞相箭！”比及曹軍寨內報知曹操時，這裏船輕水急，已放回二十餘里，追之不及。曹操懊悔不已。,"But they said that in Cao Cao's village, when they heard the drums and shouts, Mao Jie and Yu Jin hurriedly reported to Cao Cao. Cao sent an order: ""The heavy fog obscures the river, and the army suddenly arrives. There must be an ambush, and you must not move lightly. You can use the water army to shoot arrows at random."" Three thousand crossbow troops rushed to the riverside to assist in shooting. When the order came, Mao Jie and Yu Jin were afraid that the southern army would rush into the water village, so they had already sent bowmen to shoot arrows in front of the village; after a while, the bowmen from the dry village also arrived, and about 10,000 people, all of them were released into the river. Arrows: Arrows are like rain. Kong Mingyu hoisted the boat back, head east and tail west, approaching the water village to receive arrows, beating drums and shouting. When the fog cleared on the climax, Kong Ming ordered the ship to return quickly. Twenty boats are lined with arrows on the grass on both sides of the boat. Kong Ming ordered all the soldiers on board to shout in unison, ""Thank you for the arrows, Prime Minister!"" When Cao Cao was reported to Cao Cao's stronghold, the boat was light and the water was in a hurry. Cao Cao felt remorse.","Meanwhile, on shore, Cao Cao hears of what is going on and orders his men to fire into the fog to ward off the apparent attack. Indeed, so eager is he for the firepower of crossbows and bows to inflict the severest possible damage on the enemy that he orders all the crossbowmen to join in the defence, firing into the fog in the direction of all the noise. Soon there are ten thousand archers and crossbowmen firing into the fog, hoping to prevent what they imagine is a surprise landing by the enemy. So intense is the action it is as if the arrows were falling like a great rainstorm. Back on the boats, Kong Ming urges his sailors to sail as close as they can to the north shore. Arrow after arrow thuds into the barriers of the bales of black-wrapped straw as the sailors keep up the cacophony of sound. As the sun rises and the fog begins to dissolve, Kong Ming orders the boats to turn around and head home. By now each and every one of the thousand bales of straw is bristling with arrows. As they depart, Kong Ming shouts out, ‘Thank you, Prime Minister, for sending us the arrows!’ and by the time Cao Cao’s men try to launch a counter-attack, Kong Ming and his arrows are far, far away. Cao Cao has to face the fact that yet again he has been fooled.","As soon as the shouting from the river was heard by those in the camp, the two admirals, Mao Jie and Yu Jin, ran off to report to Cao Cao, who said, “Coming up in a fog like this means that they have prepared an ambush for us. Do not go out, but get all the force together and shoot at them.” He also sent orders to the ground camps to dispatch six thousand of archers and crossbowmen to aid the marines. The naval forces were then lined up shooting on the bank to prevent a landing. Presently the soldiers arrived, and ten thousand and more soldiers were shooting down into the river, where the arrows fell like rain. By and bye Zhuge Liang ordered the boats to turn round so that their prows pointed east and to go closer in so that many arrows might hit them. Zhuge Liang ordered the drums to be kept beating till the sun was high and the fog began to disperse, when the boats got under way and sailed down stream. The whole twenty boats were bristling with arrows on both sides. As they left, Zhuge Liang asked all the crews to shout derisively, “We thank you, Sir Prime Minister, for the arrows.” They told Cao Cao, but by the time he came, the light boats helped by the swift current were seven miles long down the river and pursuit was impossible. Cao Cao saw that he had been duped and was very sorry, but there was no help for it."

關公敎取路往臥牛山來。正行間，忽見周倉引數十人帶傷而來。關公引他見了玄德。問其何故受傷，倉曰：“某未至臥牛山之前，先有一將單騎而來，與裴元紹交鋒，只一合，刺死裴元紹，盡數招降人伴，占住山寨。倉到彼招誘人伴時，止有這幾個過來，餘者俱懼怕，不敢擅離。倉不忿，與那將交戰，被他連勝數次，身中三鎗：因此來報主公。”玄德曰：“此人怎生模樣？姓甚名誰？”倉曰：“極其雄壯，不知姓名。”於是關公縱馬當先，玄德在後，逕投臥牛山來。周倉在山下叫罵，只見那將全副披挂，持鎗驟馬，引衆下山。玄德早揮鞭出馬大叫曰：“來者莫非子龍否？”那將見了玄德，滾鞍下馬，拜伏道旁——原來果然是趙子龍。玄德、關公，俱下馬相見，問其何由至此。雲曰：“雲自別使君，不想公孫瓚不聽人言，以致兵敗自焚。袁紹屢次招雲。雲想紹亦非用人之人，因此未往。後欲至徐州投使君，又聞徐州失守，雲長已歸曹操，使君又在袁紹處。雲幾番欲來相投，只恐袁紹見怪。四海飄零，無容身之地。前偶過此處，適遇裴元紹下山來欲奪吾馬，雲因殺之，借此安身。近聞翼德在古城，欲往投之，未知眞實。今幸得遇使君！”玄德大喜，訴說從前之事。關公亦訴前事。玄德曰：“吾初見子龍，便有留戀不捨之情。今幸得相遇！”雲曰：“雲奔走四方，擇主而事，未有如使君者。今得相隨，大稱平生。雖肝腦塗地，無恨矣。”當日就燒毁山寨，率領人衆，盡隨玄德前赴古城。,"Guan Gong taught a road to Woniu Mountain. In the middle of the line, Zhou Cang suddenly saw dozens of people come with injuries. Guan Gong invited him to meet Xuande. When asked why he was injured, Cang said: ""Before a certain person arrived at Woniu Mountain, a general came alone and confronted Pei Yuanshao. He only stabbed Pei Yuanshao to death, and recruited all his companions to occupy the cottage. When people were with him, only these few came over, and the rest were all afraid and did not dare to leave without authorization. Cang was not angry, and he fought with that general, and he was victorious several times in a row, and he was shot three times in the body: therefore, I came to avenge the lord.” Xuande said: ""How did this person look like? Who is his surname?"" Cang said: ""Extremely majestic, I don't know his name."" So Guan Gong took the lead with his horse and Xuande behind, and went to lie on Niushan. Zhou Cang yelled and scolded at the foot of the mountain, and saw that the general was fully clothed, armed with guns, and led the crowd down the mountain. Xuande whipped his whip out of the horse and shouted, ""Is it possible that the person who came here is Zilong?"" The general saw Xuande, got off the saddle, and bowed to the side of the road - it turned out to be Zhao Zilong. Xuande and Guan Gong all dismounted from their horses to meet each other, and asked why they came here. Yun said: ""Yun Zi is not an envoy, and I don't want Gongsun Zan to not listen to people's words, so he was defeated and set himself on fire. Yuan Shao recruited Yun many times. Xuzhou fell, Yun Chang had returned to Cao Cao, and the envoy was at Yuan Shao's place again. Yun wanted to join him several times, but he was afraid that Yuan Shao would take offense. Ma, Yun Yin killed him and used this to settle down. I recently heard that Yide was in the ancient city and wanted to join him, but I don’t know the truth. I am fortunate to meet the envoy now!” Xuande was overjoyed and told what happened in the past. Guan Gong also sued the former. Xuande said: ""When I first saw Zilong, I felt nostalgia for it. Now I am fortunate to meet him!"" Yun said: ""Yun travels all over the world, choosing a master and doing things, and I have never been like an envoy. In my life. Although my liver and brain are on the ground, I have no hatred."" On the same day, he burned down the cottage, led the crowd, and followed Xuande to the ancient city.","From now on Guan Ping treats Guan Yu as his father and Xuande as his uncle. Then the party departs swiftly before they are discovered. En route back to Zhang Fei, they are suddenly attacked by a ferocious warrior and his men who charge downhill at them. Just as they think they are doomed, the attackers pull up sharply. Xuande cries in delight. ‘It’s Zhao Zilong!’ ‘My lord!’ says Zhao Zilong. ‘After leaving you, I joined Gongsun Zan again. But he wouldn’t listen to any advice. In the end Yuan Shao not only defeated him but caused his death by burning. Despite many offers from Yuan Shao I could see he was a weak man. I tried to find you and then heard that Guan Yu had betrayed you and joined Cao Cao. When I heard you were with Yuan Shao I was tempted to come. But in the end I didn’t and have been wandering ever since. When I heard Zhang Fei was at Gucheng I decided to go to him. I can’t believe my luck in now finding you!’ ‘I’d always hoped you would join us,’ says Xuande. ‘And I’ve always wanted to join you!’ says Zhao Zilong. Kowtowing, Zhao Zilong and his band of warriors join with Xuande, and together they ride for Gucheng.","The party took the road to Sleeping Bull Mountain. Before they had gone very far, they met Zhou Cang with a small party. He was wounded. He was introduced to Liu Bei who asked him how it was. He replied, “Before I reached the hill, a certain warrior all alone, had fought with my friend Pei Yuanshao and killed him. Then many of our troops surrendered to him, and he occupied our old camp. When I reached it, I tried to allure the soldiers back to my side but only succeeded with a few. The others were too afraid. I got angry and engaged the interloper, who however worsted me time after time and wounded me thrice.” “Who is the warrior? What does he look like?” asked Liu Bei. “All I know he is a doughty fighter, I do not know his name.” Thereafter they advanced toward the hill with Guan Yu in front and Liu Bei in rear. When they drew near, Zhou Cang began to abuse his enemy, who soon appeared, mailed and armed, coming down the hill like a tornado. Suddenly Liu Bei rode out waving his whip and shouting, “O Zhao Yun, I am here to look for you!” Indeed the rider was Zhao Yun. He instantly slipped out of the saddle and bowed by the roadside. Liu Bei dismounted to talk with him and ask how he came to be there. “When I left you, I had no idea that Gongsun Zan was a man who would listen to no reason. The result was disaster, and he perished in the flames. Yuan Shao invited me to him several times, but I thought too little of him to go. Then I wanted to go to Xuzhou to you, but you had lost that place, and Guan Yu had gone over to Cao Cao, and you had joined Yuan Shao. Several times I thought of coming to you, but I feared Yuan Shao. So I drifted from one place to another with nowhere to rest till I happened to come this way, and Pei Yuanshao tried to steal my horse. So I slew him and took possession of his camp. I heard Zhang Fei was in Gucheng but thought it might be only a rumor. And so the days have passed till this happy meeting.” Liu Bei told Zhao Yun all that had happened to him since they parted, and so did Guan Yu. Said Liu Bei, “The first time I saw you, I felt drawn to you and did not want to part from you. I am very happy to meet you again.” “In all my wanderings, trying to find a lord worth serving, I have seen no one like you. Now I have reached your side, that is enough for all my life. I care not what may happen to me.” Next they burned the camp on Sleeping Bull Mountain, after which they all took the road back to Gucheng where they were welcomed."

周瑜、程普收住衆軍，逕到南郡城下，見旌旗布滿，敵樓上一將叫曰：“都督少罪！吾奉軍師將令，已取城了——吾乃常山趙子龍也。”周瑜大怒，便命攻城。城上亂箭射下。瑜命且回軍商議，使甘寧引數千軍馬，逕取荊州；凌統引數千軍馬，逕取襄陽；然後却再取南郡未遲。正分撥間，忽然探馬急來報說：“諸葛亮自得了南郡，遂用兵符，星夜詐調荊州守城軍馬來救，却敎張飛襲了荊州。”又一探馬飛來報說：“夏侯惇在襄陽，被諸葛亮差人齎兵符，詐稱曹仁求救，誘惇引兵出，却敎雲長襲取了襄陽。二處城池，全不費力，皆屬劉玄德矣。”周瑜曰：“諸葛亮怎得兵符？”程普曰：“他拏住陳矯，兵符自然盡屬之矣。”周瑜大叫一聲，金瘡迸裂。正是：,"Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu took in the army and went directly to the foot of the Nanjun city. When they saw the banners and flags covered, the commander of the enemy building called out: ""Captain, you are less guilty! I have taken the city under the orders of the military commander. I am Zhao Zilong of Changshan. ""Zhou Yu was furious and ordered to attack the city. Arrows shot down the city. Yu ordered Gan Ning to lead thousands of troops and horses to take Jingzhou; Ling Tong led thousands of troops and horses to take Xiangyang; and then it was not too late to take Nanjun. In the middle of the allotment, he suddenly sent a horse to report: ""Zhuge Liang was proud of Nanjun, so he used a military talisman to deceive the defenders of Jingzhou in the starry night, but he ordered Zhang Fei to attack Jingzhou."" In Xiangyang, he was sent by Zhuge Liang to give him a military talisman, falsely calling Cao Ren to ask for help, and lured Dun to lead troops out, but he commanded Yun Chang to attack and take Xiangyang. The two cities were all effortless and belonged to Liu Xuande."" Zhou Yu said, ""How did Zhuge Liang get it? Soldier talisman?"" Cheng Pu said, ""He took Chen Jiao, so the talisman of the army belongs to him."" Zhou Yu shouted, and the golden sore burst open. Exactly:","Triumphant, Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu gather their army together and advance on Nanjun. Imagine their astonishment when they arrive to see banners flying from the towers and someone calling out to them from the wall. ‘I’m sorry to say,’ says the voice, ‘that on orders from above, I, Zhao Zilong have taken this city.’ Zhou Yu’s fury knows no bounds, and he immediately orders an attack, but a torrent of arrows drives his men from the walls. Zhou consults with his men, and they agree to send a troop to capture Gong’an and another to take Xiangyang, thereby cutting off Zhao Zilong’s supplies. Then they can prepare for the major assault on Nanjun. But Kong Ming has outwitted them again! News comes flooding in to Zhou Yu: the soldiers at Jingzhou were fooled into believing they were needed and left the city, which Zhang Fei then seized; the same trick was played on the men guarding Xiangyang, and Guan Yu has now captured it. On hearing this dreadful news, Zhou Yu gives a terrible cry, and his wound bursts open.","Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu then made their way to Nanjun where they were startled to see flags on the walls and every sign of occupation. Before they had recovered from their surprise, there appeared one who cried, “Pardon, General; I had orders from the Directing Instructor to take this city. I am Zhao Yun of Changshan.” Zhou Yu was fiercely angry and gave orders to assault the city, but the defenders sent down flights and flights of arrows, and his troops could not stay near the rampart. So he withdrew and took counsel. In the meantime he decided to send Gan Ning with a force of several thousand to capture Jingzhou City, and Ling Tong with another army to take Xiangyang. Nanjun could be taken later. But even as these orders were being given, the scouts came in hurriedly to report, saying, “After Nanjun fell, Zhuge Liang, suddenly forging a military commission, induced the guards of Jingzhou to leave it and go to the rescue of Cao Ren. Whereupon Zhang Fei occupied the town.” Soon after another messenger came, saying, “Xiahou Dun, at Xiangyang, received from Zhuge Liang dispatches, supported by a commission in due form, saying that Cao Ren was in danger and needed help, whereupon Xiahou Dun marched off, and Guan Yu seized that city.” Thus the two cities that Zhou Yu wanted had fallen, without the least effort, into the hands of his rival Liu Bei. “How did Zhuge Liang get this military commission with which he has imposed on the generals?” asked Zhou Yu. Cheng Pu replied, “He seized that of Chen Jiao and so has got all this region into his power.” Zhou Yu uttered a great cry, for at that moment his wound had suddenly burst open."

譚從其言。卽時拔寨起行，前至黎陽，與曹軍相抵。譚遣大將汪昭出戰，操遣徐晃迎敵。二將戰不數合，徐晃一刀斬汪昭於馬下。曹軍乘勢掩殺，譚軍大敗。譚收敗軍入黎陽，遣人求救於尚。尚與審配計議，只發兵五千餘人相助。曹操探知救軍已到，遣樂進、李典引兵於半路接着，兩頭圍住盡殺之。袁譚知尚止撥兵五千，又被半路坑殺，大怒，乃喚逢紀責罵。紀曰：“容某作書致主公，求其親自來救。”譚卽令紀作書，遣人到冀州致袁尚。尚與審配共議。配曰：“郭圖多謀，前次不爭而去者，為曹軍在境也。今若破曹，必來爭冀州矣。不如不發救兵，借操之力以除之。”尚從其言，不肯發兵。使者回報，譚大怒，立斬逢紀，議欲降曹。早有細作密報袁尚。尚與審配議曰：“使譚降曹，并力來攻，則冀州危矣。”乃留審配并大將蘇由固守冀州，自領大軍來黎陽救譚。尚問軍中誰敢為前部，大將呂曠、呂翔兄弟二人願去。尚點兵三萬，使為先鋒，先至黎陽。譚聞尚自來，大喜，遂罷降曹之議。譚屯兵城中，尚屯兵城外，為掎角之勢。,"Tan followed his words. At the same time, he pulled out of the village and set out to travel to Liyang, where he met Cao's army. Tan sent general Wang Zhao to fight and Xu Huang to meet the enemy. The two generals did not have many battles, and Xu Huang slashed Wang Zhao under his horse. Cao's army took advantage of the situation to cover up the attack, and Tan's army was defeated. Tan Shou defeated the army into Liyang, and sent people to Yu Shang for help. It was still negotiated with the auditor and only sent more than 5,000 troops to help. Cao Cao found out that the rescue army had arrived, and dispatched Le Jin and Li Dian to lead the troops to follow them halfway, and surrounded them on both sides to kill them. Yuan Tan knew that Shang stopped deploying 5,000 troops, and was killed halfway through the pit. He was furious and called Feng Ji to scold him. Ji said: ""Rong Mou wrote a letter to the lord, and asked him to come and rescue him in person."" Tan You ordered Ji to write a letter and sent someone to Jizhou to Yuan Shang. It is still negotiated with the trial partner. Pei said: ""Guo Tu is resourceful, and the one who left without fighting the last time is because Cao's army is in the territory. If Cao is broken now, he will definitely come to fight for Jizhou. It is better not to send rescue troops, but to use the power of Cao to eliminate them."" Say, refuse to send troops. When the messenger returned, Tan was furious, and he executed Feng Ji, discussing that he wanted to surrender to Cao Cao. There has been a secret report to Yuan Shang. Shang Yu Shenpei suggested: ""To make Tan surrender to Cao and attack with force, Jizhou will be in danger."" He left Shenpei and the general Su You to stick to Jizhou, and led a large army to Liyang to rescue Tan. It is still asked who in the army dares to be the front, and the two generals Lu Kuang and Lu Xiang are willing to go. He still ordered 30,000 troops to be the vanguard, first to Liyang. Tan Wenshang came uninvited and was overjoyed, so he surrendered to Cao Zhiyi. In the military city of Tan Tun, and outside the city of troops, it is a situation of chasing horns.","Fearful of him, when his brother asks for reinforcements to fight Cao Cao, Yuan Shang sends such a pathetically small force it is swiftly wiped out by Cao Cao’s men.","Yuan Tan agreed and forthwith broke up his camp to march against the enemy. He reached Liyang and lost no time in offering battle. He chose for his champion Wang Zhao and, when he rode out, Cao Cao sent Xu Huang to meet him. These two had fought but a few bouts when Wang Zhao was slain. At once Cao Cao's army pressed forward, and Yuan Tan suffered a severe defeat. Yuan Tan drew off his army and retired into Liyang, whence he sent to his brother for reinforcements. Yuan Shang and his adviser Shen Pei discussed the matter and only five thousand troops were sent. Cao Cao hearing of the dispatch of this meager force sent Li Dian and Yue Jin to waylay them, and the half legion was destroyed. When Yuan Tan heard of the inadequate force sent and their destruction, he was very wrath and roundly abused Peng Ji. Peng Ji replied, “Let me write to my lord and pray him to come himself.” So Peng Ji wrote and the letter was sent. When it arrived, Yuan Shang again consulted Shen Pei who said, “ Guo Tu, your elder brother's adviser, is very guileful. Formerly he left without discussion because Cao Cao was on the border. If Cao Cao be defeated, there will certainly be an attempt on you. The better plan is to withhold assistance and use Cao Cao's hand to destroy your rival.” Yuan Shang took his advice and no help was sent. When the messenger returned to Liyang without success, Yuan Tan was very angry and showed it by putting Peng Ji to death. He also began to talk of surrendering to Cao Cao. Soon spies brought news of this to Yuan Shang, and again Shen Pei was called in. Yuan Shang said, “If Yuan Tan goes over to Cao Cao, they will both attack Jizhou, and we shall be in great danger.” Finally Shen Pei and Xu You were left to take care of the defense of the city, and Yuan Shang marched his army to the rescue of his brother. “Who dares lead the van?” said Yuan Shang. Two brothers named Lu Xiang and Lu Kuang volunteered, and thirty thousand troops were given them. They were the first to reach Liyang. Yuan Tan was pleased that Yuan Shang had decided to play a brotherly part and come to his aid, so he at once abandoned all thought of going over to the enemy. He being in the city, Yuan Shang camped outside, making that an ox-horn formation of their strategic position."
於是三人連夜引軍來投朱儁。儁待之其厚，合兵一處，進討張寶。是時曹操自跟皇甫嵩討張梁，大戰於曲陽。這裏朱儁進攻張寶。張寶引賊衆八九萬，屯於山後。儁令玄德為其先鋒，與賊對敵。張寶遣副將高昇出馬搦戰。玄德使張飛擊之。飛縱馬挺矛，與昇交戰，不數合，刺昇落馬。玄德麾軍直衝過去。張寶就馬上披髮仗劍，作起妖法。只見風雷大作，一股黑氣，從天而降：黑氣中似有無限人馬殺來。玄德連忙回軍，軍中大亂，敗陣而歸，與朱儁計議。儁曰：“彼用妖術，我來日可宰猪羊狗血，令軍士伏於山頭；候賊趕來，從高坡上潑之，其法可解。”玄德聽令，撥關公、張飛各引軍一千，伏於山後高岡之上，盛猪羊狗血並穢物準備。次日，張寶搖旗擂鼓，引軍搦戰，玄德出迎。交鋒之際，張寶作法，風雷大作，飛砂走石，黑氣漫天，滾滾人馬，自天而下。玄德撥馬便走，張寶驅兵趕來。將過山頭，關、張伏軍放起號礮，穢物齊潑。但見空中紙人草馬，紛紛墜地；風雷頓息，砂石不飛。張寶見解了法，急欲退軍。左關公，右張飛，兩軍都出，背後玄德、朱儁一齊趕上，賊兵大敗。玄德望見“地公將軍”旗號，飛馬趕來，張寶落荒而走。玄德發箭，中其左臂。張寶帶箭逃脫，走入陽城，堅守不出。朱儁引兵圍住陽城攻打，一面差人打探皇甫嵩消息。探子回報，具說：“皇甫嵩大獲勝捷，朝廷以董卓屢敗，命嵩代之。嵩到時，張角已死；張梁統其衆，與我軍相拒，被皇甫嵩連勝七陣，斬張梁於曲陽。發張角之棺，戮屍梟首，送往京師。餘衆俱降。朝廷加皇甫嵩為車騎將軍，領冀州牧。皇甫嵩又表奏盧植有功無罪，朝廷復盧植原官。曹操亦以有功，除濟南相，卽日將班師赴任。”朱儁聽說，催促軍馬，悉力攻打陽城。賊勢危急，賊將嚴政，刺殺張寶，獻首投降。朱儁遂平數郡，上表獻捷。,"So the three led the army to join Zhu Jun overnight. Jun treated him very well, and joined forces to attack Zhang Bao. At that time, Cao Cao and Huangfu Song asked Zhang Liang to fight in Quyang. Here Zhu Jun attacks Zhang Bao. Zhang Bao led 80,000 to 90,000 thieves and settled at the back of the mountain. Jun ordered Xuande to be the vanguard to fight against the thieves. Zhang Bao dispatched his lieutenant, Gao Sheng, to fight on horses. Xuande sent Zhang Fei to attack him. Flying on the horse and holding the spear, he fought with Sheng, and he stabbed Sheng and fell off the horse. Xuande's army rushed forward. Zhang Bao immediately threw his sword and started a magic trick. I saw a blast of wind and thunder, and a black air descended from the sky: there seemed to be an infinite number of people and horses coming from the black air. Xuande hurriedly returned to the army, the army was in chaos, and he was defeated and returned to discuss with Zhu Jun. Jun said, ""He uses sorcery. I will slaughter the blood of pigs, sheep and dogs in the future, and make the soldiers lie on the top of the mountain; when the thieves arrive, they will splash them from the high slope. The method can be solved."" Zhang Fei led a thousand troops each, and crouched on the high hill behind the mountain, filled with blood of pigs, sheep and dogs and prepared filth. The next day, Zhang Bao waved his flag and beating drums, led the army to fight, and Xuande went out to greet him. At the time of the confrontation, Zhang Bao's actions caused great wind and thunder, flying sand and stones, black air filling the sky, rolling men and horses, and falling from the sky. Xuande rode his horse and left, and Zhang Bao drove his troops. When they crossed the mountain, Guan and Zhang Fujun put up their horns, and the filth was poured out. But seeing the paper people and horses in the air, they all fell to the ground; the wind and thunder stopped, and the gravel did not fly. Zhang Bao understood the law and was eager to withdraw from the army. Guan Gong on the left and Zhang Fei on the right, both armies came out, and Xuande and Zhu Jun caught up behind them, and the thieves were defeated. When Xuande saw the banner of ""General Digong"", the flying horse came, and Zhang Bao ran away. Xuande fired an arrow, hitting his left arm. Zhang Bao escaped with an arrow, walked into Yangcheng, and could not hold on. Zhu Jun led his troops to surround Yangcheng to attack, while sending people to inquire about Huangfu Song. The spies reported back, saying: ""Huangfu Song won a great victory, and the imperial court replaced Dong Zhuo with repeated defeats, and ordered Song to replace him. When Song arrived, Zhang Jiao was dead; Zhang Liang ruled his army and rejected our army. Huangfu Song won seven battles in a row and was executed. Zhang Liang was in Quyang. He sent Zhang Jiao's coffin, slaughtered the corpse, and sent it to the capital. All the rest surrendered. The imperial court added Huangfu Song as a general of chariots and cavalry, leading Jizhou shepherd. Officer. Cao Cao also has meritorious deeds, in addition to Jinan Prime Minister, he will be assigned to his post on the next day."" Zhu Jun heard that and urged the troops to attack Yangcheng with all his strength. The thief's situation was in critical condition, and the thieves commanded strict governance, assassinated Zhang Bao, and surrendered. Zhu Jun then flattened several counties and offered victory to the table.","That’s good.’ They decide to go with their men to the camp of Zhu Jun, an imperial officer struggling against the rebel Zhang Bao. Soon after they unite with Zhu Jun the armies clash. Zhang Bao, who is on horseback, unbinds his hair, and with his sword in his hand begins to chant magical spells. A thunderstorm breaks over Xuande’s troops, and a dark cloud descends on them from Heaven. In the middle of the dark cloud innumerable horses and men appear. The imperial troops flee in panic, and Xuande rushes back to report all this to Zhu Jun. ‘So he uses occult powers,’ comments Zhu Jun. ‘Then tomorrow we’ll sacrifice a pig, a goat and a dog. We’ll make sure all the blood and entrails and excrement are collected together. Then when the rebels attack we’ll throw this mess down upon them and then watch the occult forces evaporate!’ The very next day Zhang Bao appears again with his troops and invokes a great raging storm, filling the air with rocks and stones. The black cloud descends again, full of the same spectral horses and men. Xuande pretends to flee, drawing the rebels and their ghostly forces in pursuit, when suddenly from the hillside the appalling mixture of blood and entrails rains down. Instantly the storm dies away; the cloud disperses; the paper men and straw horses collapse, and the rocks and pebbles fall to the ground. Zhang Bao and his men break and run. Zhang Bao is badly wounded and takes refuge in the city of Yangcheng. Zhu Jun responds by besieging the city.","Wherefore all three set out and lost no time in traveling until they came to Zhu Jun, who received them well and accepted their aid in attacking Zhang Bao. At this time Cao Cao had joined himself to Huangfu Song, and they were trying to destroy Zhang Liang, and there was a great battle at Quyang. Zhang Bao was commanding some eighty thousand troops. The rebel had led his army to a strong position in the rear of the hills. An attack being decided upon, Liu Bei was the van leader. On the rebel side a general of Zhang Bao, Gao Sheng, came out to offer battle. Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to smite Gao Sheng. Out rode Zhang Fei at full speed, his spear ready set. After a few bouts Zhang Fei wounded Gao Sheng, who was unhorsed. At this Liu Bei signaled the main army to advance. Then Zhang Bao, while still mounted, loosened his hair, grasped his sword, and uttered his incantations. Thereupon began the wind to howl and the thunder to roll, while a dense black cloud from the heavens settled upon the field. And therein seemed to be horsemen and footmen innumerable, who swept to attack the imperial troops. Fear came upon them, and Liu Bei led off his troops, but they were in disorder and returned defeated. Zhu Jun and Liu Bei considered the matter. “Zhang Bao uses magic,” said Zhu Jun. “Tomorrow, then, will I prepare counter magic in the shape of the blood of slaughtered swine and goats and dogs. This blood shall be sprinkled upon their hosts from the precipices above by soldiers in ambush. Thus shall we be able to break the power of their shamanic art.” So it was done. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei took each a thousand troops and hid them on the high cliffs behind the hills, and they had a plentiful supply of the blood of swine and goats and dogs and all manners of filthy things. And so next day, when the rebels with fluttering banners and rolling drums came out to challenge, Liu Bei rode forth to meet them. At the same moment that the armies met, again Zhang Bao began his magic and again the elements began to struggle together. Sand flew in clouds, pebbles were swept along the ground, black masses of vapor filled the sky, and rolling masses of foot and horse descended from on high. Liu Bei turned, as before, to flee and the rebels rushed on. But as they pressed through the hills, the trumpets blared, and the hidden soldiers exploded bombs, threw down filth and spattered blood. The masses of soldiers and horses in the air fluttered to the earth as fragments of torn paper, the wind ceased to blow, the thunder subsided, the sand sank, and the pebbles lay still upon the ground. Zhang Bao quickly saw his magic had been countered and turned to retire. Then he was attacked on the flanks by Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, and in rear by Liu Bei and Zhu Jun. The rebels were routed. Liu Bei, seeing from afar the banner of “Zhang Bao The Lord of Earth,” galloped toward it but only succeeded in wounding Zhang Bao with an arrow in the left arm. Wounded though he was, Zhang Bao got away into the city of Yangcheng, where he fortified himself and was besieged by Zhu Jun. Scouts, sent out to get news of Huangfu Song, reported: “Commander Huangfu Song had been very successful, and Dong Zhuo had suffered many reverses. Therefore the court put Huangfu Song in the latter's place. Zhang Jue had died before Huangfu Song's arrival. Zhang Liang had added his brother's army to his own, but no headway could be made against Huangfu Song, whose army gained seven successive victories. And Zhang Liang was slain at Quyang. Beside this, Zhang Jue's coffin was exhumed, the corpse beheaded, and the head, after exposure, was sent to Capital Luoyang. The common crowd had surrendered. For these services Huangfu Song was promoted to General of the Flying Cavalry and the Imperial Protector of Jizhou. “Huangfu Song did not forgotten his friends. His first act after he had attained to power was to memorialize the Throne concerning the case of Lu Zhi, who was then restored to his former rank for his meritorious conducts. Cao Cao also received advancement for his services and was preparing to go to Jinan to his new post.” Hearing these things Zhu Jun pressed harder yet upon Yangcheng, and the approaching break-up of the rebellion became evident. Then one of Zhang Bao's officers, Yan Zheng, killed his leader and brought the head in token of submission. Thus rebellion in that part of the country was stamped out, and Zhu Jun made his report to the government."
正望間，忽見徐庶拍馬而回。玄德曰：“元直復回，莫非無去意乎？”遂欣然拍馬向前迎問曰：“先生此回，必有主意。”庶勒馬謂玄德曰：“某因心緒如麻，忘却一語：此間有一奇士，只在襄陽城外二十里隆中。使君何不求之？”玄德曰：“敢煩元直為備請來相見。”庶曰：“此人不可屈致，使君可親往求之。若得此人，無異周得呂望、漢得張良也。”玄德曰：“此人比先生才德何如？”庶曰：“以某比之，譬猶駑馬並麒麟、寒鴉配鸞鳳耳。此人每嘗自比管仲、樂毅；以吾觀之，管、樂殆不及此人。此人有經天緯地之才，蓋天下一人也。”玄德喜曰：“願聞此人姓名。”庶曰：“此人乃瑯琊陽都人：覆姓諸葛，名亮，字孔明。乃漢司隸校尉諸葛豐之後。其父名珪，字子貢，為泰山郡丞，早卒。亮從其叔玄。玄與荊州劉景升有舊，因往依之，遂家於襄陽。後玄卒，亮與弟諸葛均躬耕於南陽。嘗好為《梁父吟》。所居之地有一岡，名臥龍岡，因自號為‘臥龍先生’。此人乃絕代奇才。使君急宜枉駕見之。若此人肯相輔佐，何愁天下不定乎？”玄德曰：“昔水鏡先生曾為備言：‘伏龍、鳳雛，兩人得一，可安天下。’今所云莫非卽伏龍、鳳雛乎？”庶曰：“鳳雛乃襄陽龐統也。伏龍正是諸葛孔明。”玄德踴躍曰：“今日方知伏龍、鳳雛之語。何期大賢只在目前。非先生言，備有眼如盲也！”後人有讚徐庶走馬薦諸葛詩曰：,"When he was looking at him, he suddenly saw Xu Shu slapping his horse and returning. Xuande said: ""Yuanzhi has returned, does it mean that he has no intention of going away?"" Then he happily patted his horse forward and asked, ""Sir, this time, you must have an idea."" , I forgot to say: There is a wonderful person here, only twenty miles outside the city of Xiangyang. Why don't you ask for it?"" Xuande said, ""Dare to bother Yuanzhi to invite you to meet me."" Shu said, ""This is People can't be bowed down, so you can ask for him in person. If you get this person, it's no different from Zhou's obtaining Lu Wang and Han's Zhang Liang."" Xuande said: ""How is this person more virtuous than Mr. Shu?"" Shu said, ""With A certain comparison is like a horse with a unicorn, a jackdaw with a luan and phoenix ears. This person compares Guan Zhong and Le Yi every time he tastes it. In my opinion, Guan and Le Yi are not as good as this person. This person has the talent to go through the sky and the latitude, and there is only one person in the world. Yes."" Xuande said happily, ""I'd like to hear the name of this person."" Shu said, ""This person is from Yangdu, Langya: his surname is Zhuge, his name is Liang, and his courtesy name is Kongming. He is the successor of Zhuge Feng, the commander of the Han Dynasty. The name Gui, the word Zigong, was the governor of Taishan County, died early. Liang followed his uncle Xuan. Xuan had an old relationship with Liu Jingsheng in Jingzhou, and because of the past, he lived in Xiangyang. After Xuan died, Liang and his younger brother Zhuge both worked in Nanyang. Taste it as ""Liangfu Song"". The place where he lives is a hill, named Wolonggang, because he calls himself 'Mr. Wolong'. This person is a peerless genius. It is urgent to see him in vain. If this person is willing If we help each other, why worry about the uncertainty of the world?"" Xuande said: ""Mr. Shuijing once prepared a statement: 'Fulong and Fengchu, if the two of them have one, the world can be peaceful.' Is it true that Fulong and Fengchu are now? Shu said: ""Fengchu is Pangtong of Xiangyang. Fulong is Zhuge Kongming."" Xuande said enthusiastically: ""I only know the words of Fulong and Fengchu today. When is the great sage only at present. Blind!"" Later generations praised Xu Shu for walking and recommending Zhuge's poems, saying:","Just before Shan Fu rides off he advises Xuande that there is someone ten times greater than he is, who could be Xuande’s adviser. However, he warns Xuande that this man is not the kind of person who can be easily summoned. ‘In terms of his wisdom and virtue, what is he like in comparison to you?’ asks Xuande, to which Shan Fu replies, ‘Can you compare a plodding carthorse to a qilin12 or a crow to a phoenix? This man can measure Heaven itself and encompass the earth. There is simply no one else like him anywhere in the world.’ ‘And his name is …?’ ‘He comes from Yangdu in Langye. His family name is Zhuge, and his given name Liang. However, he is known as Kong Ming,’ Shan Fu tells him. ‘ He came to this area of Jingzhou because his uncle was a friend of Liu Biao. But the uncle died, so he and his younger brother Jun moved to a farm near Nanyang. He likes to write poetry in the style of the “Poem of Liangfu Mountain”. On their farm there is a hill called Sleeping Dragon, and this is why he has now named himself Master Sleeping Dragon! Go and see him immediately and if you’re lucky enough to have him join you, you need never worry again!’ As he rides away from Xuande on the long road to the capital, Shan Fu suddenly realizes that he may have been a bit forward in suggesting Kong Ming to Xuande without consulting him.","Suddenly they saw Xu Shu galloping back. Said Liu Bei, “He is returning; can it he that he is going to stay?” So he hastened forward to meet Xu Shu, and when they got near enough, he cried, “This return is surely for no slight reason.” Checking his horse, Xu Shu said, “In the turmoil of my feelings I forgot to say one word. There is a person of wonderful skill living about seven miles from the city of Xiangyang; why not seek him?” “Can I trouble you to ask him to visit me?” “He will not condescend to visit you; you must go to him. But if he consents, you will be as fortunate as the Zhou when they got the aid of Lu Wang, or the Han when Zhang Liang came to help.” “How does the unknown compare with yourself?” “With me? Compared with him I am as a worn-out carthorse to a palomino, an old crow to a phoenix. This man often compares himself with the ancient sages Guan Zhong and Yue Yi but, in my opinion, he is far their superior. He has the talent to measure the heavens and mete the earth; he is a man who overshadows every other in the world.” “I would know his name.” “He belongs to Langye; and his name is Zhuge Liang. He is of the family of the former General Zhuge Feng. His father, Zhuge Gui, was the Governor Deputy of Taishan but died young, and the young fellow went with his uncle Zhuge Xuan to Jingzhou. Imperial Protector Liu Biao was an old friend of his uncle, and Zhuge Liang became settled in Xiangyang. Then his uncle died, and he and his younger brother, Zhuge Jun, returned to their farm in Nanyang and worked as farmers. They used to amuse themselves with the composition of songs in the Liangfu style. “On their land was a ridge of hills called the Sleeping Dragon, and the elder of the brothers took it as a name and called himself Master Sleeping-Dragon. This is your man; he is a veritable genius. You ought really to visit him; and if he will help you, you need feel no more anxiety about peace in the empire.” “Water-Mirror spoke that time of two persons, Sleeping-Dragon and Blooming-Phoenix, and said if only one of them could be got to help me all would be well. Surely he, whom you speak of, is one of them.” “Blooming-Phoenix is Pang Tong of Xiangyang, and Sleeping-Dragon is Zhuge Liang.” Liu Bei jumped with delight, “Now at last I know who the mysterious ones are. How I wish they were here! But for you I should have still been like a blind man,” said he. Some one has celebrated in verse this interview where Xu Shu from horseback recommended Zhuge Liang:"

I saw that Zhou Yu had a murderous look on his face, and there were close rows of knives and axemen in the walls on both sides. Kong Ming was startled and said, ""How can it be like this!"" Looking back at Xuande, he was talking and laughing freely; but he saw a person behind Xuande standing with a sword: it was Yun Chang. Kong Ming said happily, ""My lord is not in danger."" Then he did not enter again, but turned around and waited by the river.","Zhou Yu is renowned for deceit,’ says Guan Yu. ‘And we have heard nothing from Kong Ming. Don’t go!’","Now by chance Zhuge Liang came on shore and heard that his master had arrived and was with the Commander-in-Chief. The news gave Zhuge Liang a great shock, and he said to himself, “What is to be done now?” He made his way to the reception tent and stole a look therein. He saw murder written on Zhou Yu's countenance and noted the assassins hidden within the walls of the tent. Then he got a look at Liu Bei, who was laughing and talking quite unconcernedly. But when he noticed the redoubtable figure of Guan Yu near his master's side, he became quite calm and contented. “My lord faces no danger,” said Zhuge Liang, and he went away to the river bank to await the end of the interview. Meanwhile the banquet of welcome proceeded."

次日，玄德面奏君。操令玄德總督五萬人馬，又差朱靈、路昭二人同行。玄德辭帝，帝泣送之。玄德到寓，星夜收拾軍器鞍馬，挂了將軍印，催促便行。董承趕出十里長亭來送。玄德曰：“國舅寧耐，某此行必有以報命。”承曰：“公宜留意，勿負帝心。”二人分別。關、張在馬上問曰：“兄今番出征，何故如此慌速？”玄德曰：“吾乃籠中鳥、網中魚。此一行如魚入大海、鳥上靑霄，不受籠網之羈絆也！”因命關、張催朱靈、路昭軍馬速行。時郭嘉、程昱考較錢糧方回，知曹操已遣玄德進兵徐州，慌入諫曰：“丞相何故令劉備督軍？”操曰：“欲截袁術耳。”程昱曰：“昔劉備為豫州牧時，某等請殺之，丞相不聽；今日又與之兵：此放龍入海，縱虎歸山也。後欲治之，其可得乎？”郭嘉曰：“丞相縱不殺備，亦不當使之去。古人云：‘一日縱敵，萬世之患。’望丞相察之。”操然其言，遂令許褚將兵五百前往，務要追玄德轉來。許褚應諾而去。,"The next day, Xuande played the king in front of him. He ordered the governor of Xuande, 50,000 horses, and sent Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao to accompany him. Xuande resigned from the emperor, and the emperor sent him weeping. When Xuande arrived at the apartment, Xingye packed up his weapons and pommel horses, hung up the general's seal, and urged him to go. Dong Cheng drove out of the ten-mile pavilion to send him off. Xuande said: ""Uncle Ning Nai, this trip must be done in order to repay."" Cheng said: ""You should pay attention to it, and don't let the emperor's heart."" The two separated. Guan and Zhang Zai immediately asked, ""Brother is going on an expedition, why is it so hurried?"" Xuande said, ""I am a bird in a cage and a fish in a net. This trip is like a fish entering the sea, a bird going up to the sky, and I won't be caught by a cage and a net. Fetters too!"" Due to Mingguan, Zhang urged Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao's army to speed up. At that time, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu checked the money and grain and returned, knowing that Cao Cao had dispatched Xuande to invade Xuzhou, panicked and said, ""Why did the Prime Minister order Liu Bei to supervise the army?"" Cao said, ""I want to cut Yuan Shu's ear."" Cheng Yu said, ""In the past, Liu Bei was When she was shepherding in Yuzhou, a certain class asked to kill him, but the prime minister didn’t listen; today he is fighting with him again: this is the same as putting a dragon into the sea, and even a tiger returning to the mountain. If you want to rule it later, can you get it?” Guo Jia said, “The prime minister will not kill him even if he If you are prepared, you should not send them away. The ancients said: 'One day, the enemy will be a disaster for all generations.' Xu Chu complied and left.","As a result, and with an imperial commission, Xuande departs with fifty thousand soldiers. On hearing this, Dong Cheng hastens to visit Xuande.","So next day Liu Bei went to an audience, and Cao Cao gave him command of fifty thousand horse and foot, and sent Generals Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao with him. At parting with Liu Bei, the Emperor shed tears. As soon as Liu Bei reached his lodging, he set about preparations for immediate departure, taking his seal as General and preparing his weapons. Dong Cheng went three miles away from the city to bid him farewell. “You must not mind my going; this journey will assuredly help on the scheme,” said Liu Bei. “Keep your mind fixed on that,” said Dong Cheng, “and never forget what His Majesty requires of us.” They parted. Presently his brothers asked him why he was in such a hurry to get away. Liu Bei replied, “I have been a bird in a cage, a fish in a net. This is like the fish regaining the open sea and the bird soaring into the blue sky. I suffered much from the confinement.” Then he ordered Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao to march the troops faster. Now Guo Jia and Cheng Yu had been absent inspecting stores and supplies when Liu Bei left. As soon as they heard of his expedition, they went in to see their master, asking him why he had let Liu Bei go in command of an army. “He is going to cut off Yuan Shu,” replied Cao Cao. “Formerly, when he was Imperial Protector of Yuzhou, we recommended that he should be put to death, but you would not hear of it. Now you have given him an army. You have allowed the dragon to reach the sea, the tiger to return to the mountains. What control will you have in future?” So spoke Cheng Yu; and Guo Jia followed in the same strain, saying, “Even if you would not put him to death, you need not have let him go. As the proverb says, 'Relax opposition for one day and age-long harm ensues.' You must admit the truth of this.”"

I don't want to make a fake. What will happen next?"" The plan, the secret book was handed over to someone to bring it back to see Sun Quan. The right to dismantle the book as it is. The book says:","After a long time of contemplation, Zhou Yu writes to Sun Quan with a new plan.","Sun Quan sent to his general: “My mother had insisted upon marrying her daughter to Liu Bei; and so by juggling with the fictitious, we had made it real. What is to be done?” The news troubled Zhou Yu day and night, but eventually he thought but another scheme which he embodied in a letter sent to his master. Here is the outline of the missive: “Contrary to expectation, the plot that I, Zhou Yu, contrived has turned the wrong way."
却說曹操探知玄德已往荊州，投奔劉表，便欲引兵攻之。程昱曰：“袁紹未除，而遽攻荊襄，倘袁紹從北而起，勝負未可知矣。不如還兵許都，養軍蓄銳，待來年春煖，然後引兵先破袁紹，後取荊襄：南北之利，一舉可收也。”操然其言，遂提兵回許都。至建安七年，春正月，操復商議興兵。先差夏侯惇、滿寵鎮守汝南，以拒劉表；留曹仁、荀彧守許都；親統大軍前赴官渡屯紮。,"But they said that Cao Cao found out that Xuande had gone to Jingzhou and defected to Liu Biao, and wanted to lead his troops to attack him. Cheng Yu said: ""Yuan Shao attacked Jingxiang without destroying it. If Yuan Shao rises from the north, the outcome is unknown. It is better to return the troops to Xudu, raise the army and prepare for the next spring, and then lead the troops to defeat Yuan Shao first. Afterwards, we will take Jingxiang: the benefits of the north and the south can be collected in one fell swoop."" As he said this, he sent troops back to Xudu. In the seventh year of Jian'an, in the first month of spring, Cao Fu discussed and raised troops. Xiahou Dun and Man Chong were dispatched to guard Runan first to reject Liu Biao; Cao Ren and Xun Yu were left to guard the capital of Xu;",Cao Cao is all for attacking Jingzhou straight away. But his advisers urge him to wait until spring. So it is that in the early months of AD 202 he is ready for war once again. His first target is Yuan Shao.,"As soon as Cao Cao knew whither his enemy had gone, he wished to attack Liu Biao, but Cheng Yu advised against any attempt so long as Yuan Shao, the dangerous enemy, was left with power to inflict damage. He said, “My lord should return to the capital to refresh the soldiers so that they may be ready for a north and south campaign in the mild spring weather.” Cao Cao accepted his advice and set out for the capital. In the first month of the eighth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 203), Cao Cao once again began to think of war, and sent to garrison Runan as a precaution against Liu Biao. Then, after arranging for the safety of the capital, he marched a large army to Guandu, the camp of the year before, and aimed at Jizhou."

蘇飛在檻車內，密使人告甘寧求救。寧曰：“飛卽不言，吾豈忘之？”大軍旣至吳會，權命將蘇飛梟首，與黃祖首級一同祭獻。甘寧乃入見權，頓首哭告曰：“某向日若不得蘇飛，則骨填溝壑矣，安能効命將軍麾下哉？今飛罪當誅，某念其昔日之恩情，願納還官爵，以贖飛罪。”權曰：“彼旣有恩於君，吾為君赦之——但彼若逃去奈何？”寧曰：“飛得免誅戮，感恩無地，豈肯走乎！若飛去，寧願將首級獻於階下。”權乃赦蘇飛，止將黃祖首級祭獻。祭畢設宴，大會文武慶功。正飲酒間，忽見座上一人大哭而起，拔劍在手，直取甘寧。寧忙舉坐椅以迎之。權驚視其人：乃凌統也。因甘寧在江夏時，射死他的父親凌操，今日相見，故欲報讎。權連忙勸住，謂統曰：“興霸射死卿父，彼時各為其主，不容不盡力。今旣為一家人，豈可復理舊讎？萬事皆看吾面。”凌統叩頭大哭曰：“不共戴天之讎，豈容不報！”權與衆官再三勸之，凌統只是怒目而視甘寧。權卽日命甘寧領兵五千、戰船一百隻，往夏口鎮守，以避凌統。寧拜謝，領兵自往夏口去了。權又加封凌統為承烈都尉，統只得含恨而止。東吳自此廣造戰船，分兵守把江岸；又命孫靜引一枝軍守吳會；孫權自領大軍，屯柴桑；周瑜日於鄱陽湖敎練水軍，以備攻戰。,"Su Fei was in the car, and the secret messenger told Gan Ning for help. Ning said, ""If you don't say anything about Fei, how can I forget it?"" The army arrived at Wuhui and ordered the general Su Feixiao's head to be sacrificed together with Huang Zu's head. Gan Ning entered the right to see the right, and immediately cried and said, ""If a certain Xiangri does not have Su Fei, his bones will fill the gully, and An Neng will serve the general's subordinates? Now Fei should be punished for his crime, and a certain, thinking of his past kindness, is willing to accept it. Return the official title to atone for Fei’s crime.” Quan said: “He has been kind to the king, and I will forgive him for the king—but what will he do if he escapes?” Ning said, “Flying has been spared the execution, but I have nowhere to be grateful, so why would I be willing to leave? Huh! If I fly away, I would rather sacrifice my head below the steps."" Quan Nai pardoned Su Fei and stopped offering Huang Zu's head. After the ceremony, a banquet was held, and the civil and military celebrations of the conference were held. While drinking, I suddenly saw a person in the seat bursting into tears, drawing a sword in his hand, and grabbing Gan Ning. Ning hurriedly raised a chair to welcome him. Quan was astonished at the person: Nai Ling Tong. Because Gan Ning shot his father Ling Cao to death when he was in Jiangxia, we meet today, so I want to retaliate. Quan hurriedly persuaded him to stop, saying to Tong: ""Xingba shot his father to death. At that time, each of them was the master, and it was not tolerated that he did not try his best. Now, as a family, how can we go back to the old one? Everything looks at my face."" Ling Tong kowtowed. Weeping loudly, he said, ""If we don't share the fate of the sky, how can we not repay it!"" Quan Youri ordered Gan Ning to lead 5,000 troops and 100 warships to guard Xiakou to avoid Lingtong. Ning thanked him and led the troops to Xiakou. Quan also made Ling Tong the commander of Chenglie, and Tong had no choice but to hold back his hatred. Since then, Eastern Wu has built a large number of warships and divided his troops to guard the river bank; he also ordered Sun Jing to lead an army to guard Wuhui; Sun Quan led a large army by himself and stationed Chaisang; Zhou Yu trained a naval army at Poyang Lake every day to prepare for the attack.","Knowing that Liu Biao will come to avenge the death of Huang Zu, Sun Quan consolidates his forces to the north. It is vital now to prepare for the attack on the south from Cao Cao. Back at Xuande’s base, news is brought of the death of Huang Zu. ‘I am not surprised,’ says Kong Ming, ‘for he was a harsh master, and his men didn’t trust him.’ As he is speaking, Liu Qi, the eldest son of Liu Biao, arrives and asks to speak with Kong Ming and Xuande.","Now Su Fei was still confined, but he got some one to go to Gan Ning to beg him to plead for mercy. Gan Ning had expected this although the prisoner had said no word, and he was averse from leaving his friend and one-time protector to perish. “I should not have forgotten him even if he had said nothing,” said Gan Ning. When the army had returned, Sun Quan gave orders for Su Fei's execution that his head might be offered with that of Huang Zu. Then Gan Ning went in to his lord and said, weeping, “Long ago, if it had not been for Su Fei, my bones would have been rotting in some ditch and how then could I have rendered service under your banner? Now he deserves death, but I cannot forget his kindness to me, and I pray you take away the honors you have bestowed on me as a set-off to his crime.” Sun Quan replied, “Since he once showed kindness to you, I will pardon him for your sake. But what can be done if he run away?” “If he be pardoned and escape death, he will be immeasurably grateful and will not go away. If he should, then will I offer my life in exchange.” So the condemned man escaped death, and only one head was offered in sacrifice. After the sacrificial ceremonies, a great banquet was spread in honor of the victories. As it was proceeding, suddenly one of the guests burst into loud lamentations, drew his sword, and rushed upon Gan Ning. Gan Ning hastily rose and defended himself with the chair on which he had been sitting. The host looked at the assailant and saw it was Ling Tong, whose father Ling Cao had fallen under an arrow shot by Gan Ning. The son was now burning to avenge his father's death. Hastily leaving his place, Sun Quan checked the angry officer, saying, “If he slew your noble father, then remember each was fighting for his lord for whom he was bound to exert himself to the utmost. But now that you both are under one flag and are of one house, you may not recall an ancient injury. You must regard my interests continually.” Ling Tong beat his head upon the floor and cried, saying, “But how can I not avenge this? It is a blood feud and we may not both live under the same sky.” The guests interfered, beseeching the man to forgo his revenge, and at last he ceased from his murderous intention. But he sat glaring wrathfully at his enemy. So soon after Gan Ning was dispatched with five thousand troops and one hundred warships to guard Xiakou, where he was beyond the reach of Ling Tong's wrath. Then Sun Quan promoted Ling Tong, and so he was somewhat appeased. From about this time the South Land enlarged her fleets, and soldiers were sent to various points to guard the river banks. The brother of the chieftain, Sun Kuang, was placed in command at Wujun, and Sun Quan himself, with a large army, camped at Chaisang. Zhou Yu, Commander-in-Chief of the army and Supreme Admiral of the navy, was on the Poyang Lake training the naval forces, and general preparations were made for defense and attack."
早有人報到許昌，言劉備有諸葛亮、龐統為謀士，招軍買馬，積草屯糧，連結東吳，早晚必興兵北伐。曹操聞之，遂聚謀士商議南征。荀攸進曰：“周瑜新死，可先取孫權，次攻劉備。”操曰：“我若遠征，恐馬騰來襲許都。前在赤壁之時，軍中有訛言，亦傳西涼入寇之事，今不可不防也。”荀攸曰：“以愚所見，不若降詔加馬騰為征南將軍，使討孫權；誘入京師，先除此人，則南征無患矣。”操大喜，卽日遣人齎詔至西涼召馬騰。,"Someone reported to Xuchang early, saying that Liu Bei had Zhuge Liang and Pang Tong as his advisers, recruited troops to buy horses, accumulated grass and grain, connected with Eastern Wu, and sooner or later would launch an army to the north. When Cao Cao heard about it, he gathered his advisors to discuss the southern expedition. Xun Youjin said: ""Zhou Yu is newly dead, you can take Sun Quan first, and then attack Liu Bei."" Cao said: ""If I go on an expedition, I am afraid that Ma Teng will attack Xudu. When I was in Chibi, there were false rumors in the army, and it was also spread to Xiliang. The matter of entering the pirates cannot be avoided now.” Xun You said: “From what I can see, it is better to send Jia Ma Teng to be the general of the expedition to the south, and have Sun Quan be sent to him; to lure him into the capital and get rid of this person first, then the expedition in the south will be safe. ."" Cao was overjoyed, and on the next day he sent people to Xiliang to summon Ma Teng.","When Kong Ming returns from his travels he asks what high position Xuande has given to Pang Tong, and a shamefaced Xuande has to confess his mistake.","And he knew that he had to expect an attack sooner or later. So he summoned his strategists to a council for a new campaign. Said Xun Yu, “Sun Quan should be first attacked. because of the recent death of their ablest general Zhou Yu. Liu Bei will follow.” Cao Cao replied, “If I go on such a distant expedition, Ma Teng will fall upon the capital. While I was at the Red Cliffs, there were sinister rumors of this, and I must guard against it.” Xun Yu said, “The best thing that occurs to stupid me is to obtain for Ma Teng the title of General Who Subdues the South and send him against the South Land. Thus he can be enticed to the capital and got rid of. Then you can have no fear of marching southward.” Cao Cao approved, and soon Ma Teng was summoned from Xiliang, a frontier territory in the west."

却說劉岱知王忠被擒，堅守不出。張飛每日在寨前叫罵，岱聽知是張飛，越不敢出。飛守了數日，見岱不出，心生一計：傳令今夜二更去劫寨，日間却在帳中飲酒詐醉，尋軍士罪過，打了一頓，縛在營中曰：“待我今夜出兵時，將來祭旗！”却暗使左右縱之去。軍士得脫，偷走出營，逕往劉岱營中來報劫寨之事。劉岱見降卒身受重傷，遂聽其說，虛紮空寨，伏兵在外。是夜張飛却分兵三路，中間使三十餘人，劫寨放火；却敎兩路軍抄出他寨後，看火起為號，夾擊之。三更時分，張飛自引精兵，先斷劉岱後路；中路三十餘人，搶入寨中放火。劉岱伏兵恰待殺入，張飛兩路兵齊出。岱軍自亂，正不知飛兵多少，各自潰散。劉岱引一隊殘軍，奪路而走，正撞見張飛；狹路相逢，急難回避；交馬只一合，早被張飛生擒過去。餘衆皆降。飛使人先報入徐州。玄德聞之，謂雲長曰：“翼德自來粗莽，今亦用智，吾無憂矣。”乃親自出郭迎之。飛曰：“哥哥道我躁暴，今日如何？”玄德曰：“不用言語相激，如何肯使機謀？”飛大笑。,"However, Liu Dai knew that Wang Zhong was captured and could not hold on. Zhang Fei yelled in front of the village every day, but when Dai heard that it was Zhang Fei, he didn't dare to come out. Fei guarded for a few days, but when he saw Dai could not see him, he had a plan in his heart: he was ordered to go to the robbery fortress tonight, but during the day he was drinking and getting drunk in the tent. When I send troops tonight, I will sacrifice the flag in the future!"" But he secretly moved to the left and right. The sergeant managed to escape, sneaked out of the camp, and went straight to Liu Dai's camp to report the robbery. When Liu Dai saw Jiangzu was seriously injured, he listened to what he said and set up an empty fortress, and the soldiers were ambushed outside. That night, Zhang Fei divided his troops into three groups, and sent more than 30 people in the middle to rob the village and set fire to it. At the third watch, Zhang Fei brought in his elite troops and cut off Liu Dai's back road first; more than 30 people in the middle road rushed into the village and set fire to it. Liu Dai's troops were just about to enter, and Zhang Fei's troops went out together. The Dai army was in chaos, and they all broke up without knowing the number of flying soldiers. Liu Dai led a group of remnants, took the road and ran into Zhang Fei; met Zhang Fei on a narrow road, and was in a hurry to avoid; the horses only joined together, and Zhang Fei was already captured. All the rest descend. Fei sent people to report to Xuzhou first. When Xuande heard about it, he called Yun Chang and said, ""Yide has always been rude, but now he is also wise, so I have no worries."" He personally went out to Guo to welcome him. Fei said: ""My brother said that I am irritable, how is it today?"" Xuande said, ""You don't need to be provocative with words, how can you be scheming?"" Fei laughed loudly.","But secretly Zhang Fei has the soldier released, and of course he flees to the opposing army and tells them of the ‘impending attack’. The information he brought is, of course, false, even though the poor soldier doesn’t know this. It works. It misleads Liu Dai and his men so they take up station outside the camp to ambush the attack they expect. But Zhang Fei attacks from three different directions at once, capturing not only Liu Dai but most of his men as well. Zhang Fei rides back to Xuande and reports his success. Xuande says, ‘It seems our brother has grown less impetuous!’ Zhang Fei boasts, ‘So, do you still think I am too violent?’ to which Xuande replies, ‘If I had not goaded you, you would never have bothered to rise to this level of sophistication!’ At which Zhang Fei roars with delight.","The capture of his colleague made Liu Dai careful. He strengthened his defenses and kept behind them. He took no notice of the daily challenges and continual insults which began with Zhang Fei's arrival. After some days Zhang Fei evolved a ruse. He issued orders to prepare to rush the enemy's camp at night, but he himself spent the day drinking. Pretending to be very intoxicated, he held a court-martial, and one soldier was severely flogged for a breach of discipline. The man was left bound in the midst of the camp, Zhang Fei saying, “Wait till I am ready to start tonight; you shall be sacrificed to the flag.” At the same time he gave secret orders to the custodians to let the man escape. The man found his opportunity, crept out of camp, and went over to the enemy, to whom he betrayed the plan of a night attack. As the man bore signs of savage punishment, Liu Dai was the more disposed to credit his desertion and tale; and Liu Dai made his arrangements, putting the greater part of his troops in ambush outside his camp so that it was empty. That night, having divided his army into three parties, Zhang Fei went to attack the camp. A few men were ordered to advance directly, dash in and set fire going. Two larger bodies of troops were to go round to the rear of the camp and attack when they saw the fire well started. At the third watch, Zhang Fei, with his veterans, went to cut off Liu Dai's road to the rear. The thirty men told off to start a conflagration made their way into the camp and were successful. When the flames arose, the ambushing troops rushed out but only to find themselves attacked on both sides. This confused them, and as they knew nothing of the number of their assailants, they were panic stricken and scattered. Liu Dai, with a company of footmen got clear of the fight and fled, but he went straight toward Zhang Fei. Escape was impossible, and the two men rode up each to attack the other. Zhang Fei captured his opponent, and the men surrendered. Zhang Fei sent news of this success to his brothers. Liu Bei said, “Hitherto Zhang Fei has been rather violent, but this time he has acted wisely, and I am very pleased.” They rode out to welcome Zhang Fei. “You said I was too rough; how now?” said Zhang Fei to his brothers. “If I had not put you on your mettle, you would not have evolved this stratagem,” said Liu Bei. Zhang Fei laughed."

却說孔明謂張飛曰：“前者子龍取桂陽郡時，責下軍令狀而去。今日翼德要取武陵。必須也責下軍令狀，方可領兵去。”張飛遂立軍令狀，欣然領三千軍，星夜投武陵界上來。金旋聽得張飛引兵到，乃集將校，整點精兵器械，出城迎敵。從事鞏志諫曰：“劉玄德乃大漢皇叔，仁義布於天下；加之張翼德驍勇非常。不可迎敵，不如納降為上。”金旋大怒曰：“汝欲與賊通連為內變取？”喝令武士推出斬之。衆官皆告口：“先斬家人，於軍不利。”金旋乃喝退鞏志，自率兵出。離城二十里，正迎張飛。飛挺矛立馬。大喝金旋。旋問部將：“誰敢出戰？”衆皆畏懼，莫敢向前。旋自驟馬舞刀迎之。張飛大喝一聲，渾如巨雷。金旋失色，不敢交鋒，撥馬便走。飛引衆軍隨後掩殺。金旋走至城邊，城上亂箭射下。旋驚視之，見鞏志立於城上曰：“汝不順天時，自取敗亡，吾與百姓自降劉矣。”言未畢，一箭射中金旋面門，墜於馬下。軍士割頭獻張飛，鞏志出城納降。飛就令鞏志齎印綬，往桂陽見玄德；玄德大喜，遂令鞏志代金旋之職。,"However, Kong Ming said to Zhang Fei: ""When Zilong took Guiyang County, he ordered the military order to leave. Today, Yide wants to take Wuling. You must also order the military order before you can lead the troops."" Three thousand troops, Xingye cast Wuling Realm up. When Jin Xuan heard that Zhang Fei was leading the troops, he gathered his generals and commanders, ordered the best troops and equipment on the hour, and went out of the city to meet the enemy. Engaged in Gong Zhi's advice, he said: ""Liu Xuande is the uncle of the emperor of the Han Dynasty, benevolence and righteousness spread all over the world; in addition, Zhang Yide is very brave. If you can't meet the enemy, it is better to accept and lower yourself."" Jin Xuan was furious and said: ""You want to connect with the thieves for internal change. ?"" ordered the samurai to launch Slash. All the officials told him, ""Beheading the family first is not good for the army."" Jin Xuan ordered Gong Zhi to retreat and led his troops out. Twenty miles from the city, Zhang Fei was being greeted. Flying the spear immediately. Drink the golden spin. He asked his generals, ""Who dares to fight?"" Everyone was afraid and dared not move forward. Spin the horse and dance to meet him. Zhang Fei shouted loudly, like a giant thunder. Jin Xuan paled, did not dare to confront him, and left. The Feiyin army then covered up. Jin Xuan walked to the edge of the city, and the arrows shot down from the city. Xuan was startled, and saw Gong Zhi standing on the city, saying: ""When you are not in conformity with the sky, you will be defeated by yourself, and I and the people will surrender to Liu."" The sergeant cut his head to offer Zhang Fei, and Gong Zhi went out of the city to accept the surrender. Fei ordered Gong Zhi to seal the ribbon and go to Guiyang to see Xuande; Xuande was overjoyed and ordered Gong Zhi to take the post of Jinxuan.","What Kong Ming wants is for Zhang Fei to agree to the same military law contract that Zhao Zilong has made – the law that makes him culpable if he fails. As Zhang Fei has no problem with that, he signs and soon is on his way to Wuling with his three thousand soldiers. When news of the impending attack by such a famous warrior as Zhang Fei reaches Wuling, the governor calls his officers to him and starts to discuss the plans for an attack. Only one officer, Gong Zhi, argues that this is pointless and that they should submit. The governor is all for executing him on the spot but is dissuaded by others of his officers. It is agreed that the attack will be led by the governor himself. The attack by the governor of Wuling is an abysmal failure, and when the governor flees back to his city gate he finds that Gong Zhi has taken over. ‘ You brought down the wrath of Heaven upon yourself,’ calls down Gong Zhi. ‘We the people have decided to join Xuande!’ Arrows rain down on the governor and his retreating troops until one arrow strikes the governor in the face and throws him from his horse. His men cut off his head and bring it to Zhang Fei to win their reprieve. They are followed by Gong Zhi, who surrenders the city. In recognition of his role he is made governor by Xuande.","What Zhuge Liang required from Zhang Fei was a formal recognition of responsibility for success. Said Zhuge Liang, “When Zhao Yun went on his expedition, he gave written guarantee of being responsible for success, and you ought to do the same now that you are starting for Wuling. In that case you may have men and start.” So Zhang Fei gave the required document and received joyfully the three thousand of soldiers he had demanded. He set out at once and traveled without rest till he reached Wuling. When the Governor of Wuling, Jin Xuan by name, heard that an expedition against him was afoot, he mustered his officers and recruited brave soldiers and put his weapons in order ready for the struggle. And his army moved out of the city. A certain secretary, Gong Zhi, remonstrated with his chief for opposing a scion of the imperial house, saying, “Liu Bei is of the Hans, and recognized as an uncle of the Emperor. All the world knows he is kindly and righteous. Added to that his brother Zhang Fei is extraordinarily bold. We cannot face them in battle with hope of success. Our best course is to give in.” But his master angrily replied, “Do you want to play the traitor and take the side of the rebels and help them?” Jin Xuan called in the lictors and told them to put Gong Zhi to death. The other officers interceded for Gong Zhi, saying, “It augers ill to start an expedition by slaying your own officer.” So the Governor merely sent Gong Zhi sway. He himself led the army out of the city. After marching seven miles, he met with Zhang Fei's army. Zhang Fei at once rode to the front, spear ready to thrust, and opened with a shout. Jin Xuan turned to his officers and asked who would go out to fight him, but no one replied; they were too afraid. So the Governor himself galloped out, flourishing his sword. Seeing him advance, Zhang Fei shouted in a voice of thunder. Poor Jin Xuan was seized with panic, turned pale and could not go on. He turned his steed and fled. Then Zhang Fei and his army went in pursuit and smote the fugitives, chasing them to the city wall. Here the fugitives were greeted by a flight of arrows from their own wall. Greatly frightened, Jin Xuan looked up to see what this meant, and there was Gong Zhi, who had opposed him, standing on the wall. “You brought defeat upon yourself because you opposed the will of God,” cried the traitor. “I and the people with me are determined to yield to Liu Bei.” Just as Gong Zhi finished speaking, an arrow wounded Jin Xuan in the face and he fell to the ground. Thereupon his own troops cut off his head, which they forthwith presented to Zhang Fei. Gong Zhi then went out and made formal submission, and Zhang Fei bade him take his letter and the seal to Guiyang to Liu Bei, who was pleased to hear of Zhang Fei's success and gave the governorship to Gong Zhi."
孔明吟罷，翻身問童子曰：“有俗客來否？”童子曰：“劉皇叔在此，立候多時。”孔明乃起身曰：“何不早報！尚容更衣。”遂轉入後堂。又半晌，方整衣冠出迎。玄德見孔明身長八尺，面如冠玉，頭戴綸巾，身披鶴氅，飄飄然有神仙之概。玄德下拜曰：“漢室末胄、涿郡愚夫，久聞先生大名，如雷貫耳。昨兩次晉謁，不得一見，已書賤名於文几，未審得入覽否？”孔明曰：“南陽野人，疎懶性成，屢蒙將軍枉臨，不勝愧赧。”二人敍禮畢，分賓主而坐。童子獻茶。茶罷，孔明曰：“昨觀書意，足見將軍憂民憂國之心；但恨亮年幼才疎，有誤下問。”玄德曰：“司馬德操之言，徐元直之語，豈虛談哉？望先生不棄鄙賤，曲賜敎誨。”孔明曰：“德操、元直，世之高士。亮乃一耕夫耳，安敢談天下事？二公謬舉矣。將軍奈何舍美玉而求頑石乎？”玄德曰：“大丈夫抱經世奇才，豈可空老於林泉之下？願先生以天下蒼生為念，開備愚魯而賜敎。”孔明笑曰：“願聞將軍之志。”玄德屏人促席而告曰：“漢室傾頹，奸臣竊命，備不量力，欲伸大義於天下，而智術淺短，迄無所就。惟先生開其愚而拯其厄，實為萬幸！”孔明曰：“自董卓造逆以來，天下豪傑並起。曹操勢不及袁紹，而竟能克紹者，非惟天時，抑亦人謀也。今操已擁百萬之衆，挾天子以令諸侯，此誠不可與爭鋒。孫權據有江東，已歷三世，國險而民附，此可用為援而不可圖也。荊州北據漢、沔，利盡南海，東連吳會，西通巴、蜀，此用武之地，非其主不能守；是殆天所以資將軍，將軍豈可意乎？益州險塞，沃野千里，天府之國，高祖因之以成帝業；今劉璋闇弱，民殷國富，而不知存恤，智能之士，思得明君。將軍旣帝室之胄，信義著於四海，總攬英雄，思賢如渴，若跨有荊、益，保其巖阻，西和諸戎，南撫彝、越，外結孫權，內修政理；待天下有變，則命一上將將荊州之兵以向宛、洛，將軍身率益州之衆以出秦川，百姓有不簞食壼漿以迎將軍者乎？誠如是，則大業可成，漢室可興矣。此亮所以為將軍謀者也：惟將軍圖之。”言罷，命童子取出畫一軸，挂於中堂，指謂玄德曰：“此西川五十四州之圖也。將軍欲成霸業，北讓曹操占天時，南讓孫權占地利，將軍可占人和。先取荊州為家，後卽取西川建基業，以成鼎足之勢，然後可圖中原也。”玄德聞言，避席拱手謝曰：“先生之言，頓開茅塞，使備如撥雲霧而覩靑天。但荊州劉表、益州劉璋，皆漢室宗親，備安忍奪之？”孔明曰：“亮夜觀天象，劉表不久人世；劉璋非立業之主：久後必歸將軍。”玄德聞言，頓首拜謝。只這一席話，乃孔明未出茅廬，已知三分天下，眞萬古之人不及也！後人有詩讚曰：,"After chanting, Kong Ming turned around and asked the boy, ""Are there any vulgar guests coming?"" The boy said, ""Uncle Liu has been waiting here for a long time."" Kong Ming got up and said, ""Why didn't you report early! Shang Rong changed clothes."" . After a long while, Fang Zheng dressed up to greet him. Xuande saw that Kongming was eight feet long, with a face like a crown jade, wearing a silk scarf and a crane cloak, floating like a fairy. Xuande bowed down and said: ""The late Han Dynasty, Zhuo County fool, I have heard the name of the master for a long time, and it is like thunder. Yesterday, I visited Jin Ye twice, but I have not seen it. I have already written a humble name in Wenji. Can I read it without reviewing it?"" Kong Ming said. ""The savages of Nanyang are lazy, and have been repeatedly visited by the general, so I feel ashamed."" Children offer tea. After tea was over, Kong Ming said, ""Looking at the calligraphy yesterday, it shows that the general is worried about the people and the country. How can you talk about it? Mr. Wang will not abandon the contempt, and give him a lesson."" Kong Ming said: ""De Cao, Yuan Zhi, the world's top scholars. Liang is a farmer, dare to talk about world affairs? Er Gong is wrong. Why would the general ask for stubborn stones instead of beautiful jade?"" Xuande said, ""How can a gentleman embrace the genius of the world, how can he be old under Lin Quan? May the master take the common people in the world as his thoughts, and give him advice."" Kong Ming said with a smile: ""I would like to hear the general's will."" Xuande pinged the people to rush to the table and said: ""The Han Dynasty has collapsed, the traitorous officials have stolen their lives, they are not prepared, they want to extend the righteousness to the world, but their wisdom and skills are short, and there is nothing to do so far. It is indeed a fortune, sir, to save him from his misfortune!"" Kong Ming said, ""Since Dong Zhuo's rebellion, the world's heroes have risen together. Cao Cao is not as powerful as Yuan Shao, but he was able to defeat Shao. Also. Today, Cao has millions of people, relying on the emperor to command the princes. This is truly impossible to compete with. Sun Quan has owned Jiangdong and has gone through three generations. The country is in danger and the people are attached. The Han, Mian, the South China Sea, the Wuhui in the east, the Tongba and Shu in the west, and the masters of these places of power cannot guard it unless the masters are there. In the kingdom of heaven, Gaozu became the emperor because of it; today Liu Zhang is dark and weak, the people are rich and the country is rich, but he does not know how to save his money, a wise man, and a wise king. There are Jing and Yi, to protect their rock resistance, to the west and Zhu Rong, to the south to Fu Yi and Yue, to form Sun Quan outside, and to revise political principles inside; , the general's body led the people of Yizhou to go out of Qinchuan, and the people did not eat and drink to welcome the general? If so, then the great cause can be accomplished, and the Han Dynasty can flourish. This is why he is the general's planner: Only the general will draw it."" After speaking, he ordered the boy to take out a scroll and hang it in the middle hall, pointing to Xuande and saying, ""This is the picture of the fifty-four prefectures in Xichuan. If the general wants to achieve hegemony, he will let Cao Cao occupy the sky in the north, and let him in the south. Sun Quan occupies the land, and the generals can occupy the people. First take Jingzhou as home, and then take Xichuan to build the foundation, so as to form a cauldron, and then you can take the picture."" Xuande heard the words, bowed his hands and said, ""Sir's words. , I immediately opened the fortress, so that Bei was like a cloud and mist, and he was stunned in the sky. But Liu Biao of Jingzhou and Liu Zhang of Yizhou are both relatives of the Han family, so Bei An will endure them?"" Kong Ming said: ""Watching the sky in the bright night, Liu Biao will die soon; Liu Zhang is not the owner of the business: he will return to the general after a long time."" Xuande heard the words and thanked him. Just these words, Confucius is still young, he knows three parts of the world, and the people of all ages are not as good as him! A later poem praised:","Turning to his assistant, Kong Ming says, ‘While I slept, have there been any visitors?’ to which the lad replies that Xuande, the uncle of the emperor, came and has been waiting for quite some time. ‘Why didn’t you wake me?’ retorts an annoyed Kong Ming. ‘ He is very important, so I must go and change into appropriate clothes.’ When Kong Ming appears, Xuande is truly impressed because he looks like such a gentleman. He is tall, with a complexion like jade, and is dressed in a long cloak of crane feathers; his head is bound with a silk scarf. To be honest, he looks like a god or an immortal. Bowing deeply, Xuande says, ‘I’m one of the last surviving members of the House of Han, a nobody, but I’ve heard tell of your fame for so long. I’ve in fact tried to see you on two previous occasions, but without success. Last time I left a message for you. Did you by any chance see that?’ Kong Ming apologizes profusely and then reveals he has indeed read Xuande’s note. ‘I do so appreciate the depth of your passion for the country and its people,’ he says, ‘but I’m young and ignorant – so really not the kind of person you need.’ Even when Xuande points out that wise sages have recommended Kong Ming, he replies that he is nothing more than a farmer. ‘Why come to me, just a little ordinary stone, when you have already found the jade?’ To this Xuande replies, ‘I’m sorry but I really cannot believe that you want to spend the rest of your life hidden away when everything under Heaven needs the wisdom of your guidance. Please help me. Teach me.’ When Kong Ming asks what he really wants, Xuande replies, ‘The Han are collapsing; their authority has been usurped by evil ministers. Although I’m weak, I want the land to be ruled by justice. But through my own fault, I’ve failed thus far. You, sir, can help me – teach me. There is nothing greater that I desire.’ ‘The rot started with that appalling rebel Dong Zhuo,’ says Kong Ming. ‘Now, in the north there is Cao Cao. True, not as strong as Yuan Shao but by cunning he’s overcome him. He not only has a vast army of over a million but control over the Son of Heaven, the emperor. With that comes the allegiance of many nobles. He, you cannot oppose. ‘To the south of the river we’ve Sun Quan, whose family have ruled there for three generations. While not so strong, he does have the support of the people, and therefore you should view him as a potential ally, not as a foe. ‘Now, it’s Jingzhou ruled by Liu Biao that you need to focus on. This is the place where the future will be decided. I’ve nothing against the current ruler, but the Will of Heaven has decreed that it’s yours for the taking, even if you have failed to recognize this or act upon it. ‘Turning to Yizhou, we find another key territory, vast and bounteous, a favourite of Heaven, and let’s not forget that it was from here that the founder of the Han came. Its ruler, Liu Zhang, is not only stupid but also weak, for despite the wealth and skills of his people he’s no idea whatsoever how to control them, and they in return long for a wise ruler. With your reputation as a member of the imperial family, your proven valour and the many heroes who’ve flocked to your banner as well as your honouring of the sages, you should find it easy to take this city.’ Kong Ming then sets out with whom, where and through which alliances Xuande needs to plan in order to take control across the land. He tells him that, in doing so, ‘You’ll be the hero of the ordinary people.’ Using a map, he points out how Xuande needs to make Jingzhou his base in order to move forward with his plans. Xuande expresses his profound gratitude. But while he is grateful for all this advice, he has to raise the fact that there is a fundamental problem. Both Liu Biao in Jingzhou and Liu Zhang in Yizhou are also members of the imperial house of Han. As they are kin – he cannot attack or usurp them. But Kong Ming assures him that Liu Biao has not long to live – his fortune is in the stars. As for Liu Zhang, he is not ambitious so will be willing to work under Xuande. After hearing this advice and wisdom, Xuande again pleads with Kong Ming to come and work with him.","The calm retreat for toil and strife.” As he finished he turned to the lad, saying, “Have any of the usual people come?” “Liu Bei, the Uncle of the Emperor is here,” said the boy. “He has been waiting a long time.” “Why did you not tell me?” said he, rising from the couch. “I must dress.” Zhuge Liang rose and turned into a room behind to dress. In a short time he reappeared, his clothing properly arranged, to receive his visitor. Then Liu Bei saw coming toward him a young man rather below medium height with a refined face. He wore a head-wrap and a long crane-white gown. He moved with much dignity as though he was rather more than mortal. Liu Bei bowed, saying, “I am one of the offshoots of the Han family, a simple person from Zhuo. I have long known the Master's fame, which has indeed thundered in my ear. Twice I have come to visit you, without success. Once I left my name on your writing table; you may have my note.” Zhuge Liang replied, “This hermit is but a dilatory person by temperament. I know I have to thank you for more than one vain visit and I am ashamed to think of them.” These courteous remarks and the proper bows exchanged, the two men sat in their relative positions as host and guest, and the serving lad brought tea. Then Zhuge Liang said, “From your letter I know that you grieve for both people and government. If I were not so young and if I possessed any talent, I would venture to question you.” Liu Bei replied, “Sima Hui and Xu Shu have both spoken of you; can it be that their words were vain? I trust, O Master, that you will not despise my worthlessness but will condescend to instruct me.” “The two men you speak of are very profound scholars. I am but a peasant, a mere farmer, and who am I that I should talk of empire politics? Those two misled you when they spoke of me. Why do you reject the beautiful jewel for a worthless pebble?” “But your abilities are world embracing and marvelous. How can you be content to allow time to pass while you idle away life in these secluded haunts? I conjure you, O Master, to remember the inhabitants of the world and remove my crass ignorance by bestowing instruction upon me.” “But what is your ambition, General?” Liu Bei moved his seat nearer to his host and said, “The Hans are sinking; designing ministers steal away their authority. I am weak, yet I desire to restore the state to its right mind. But my ignorance is too vast, my means are too slender, and I know not where to turn. Only you, Master, can lighten my darkness and preserve me from falling. How happy should I be if you would do so!” Zhuge Liang replied, “One bold human after another has arisen in various parts of the empire ever since the days of the rebel Dong Zhuo. Cao Cao was not so powerful as Yuan Shao, but he overcame Yuan Shao by seizing the favorable moment and using his soldiers properly. Now he is all-powerful; he rules an immense army and, through his control of the court, the various feudal lords as well. You cannot think of opposing him. Then the Suns have held their territory in the South Land for three generations. Their position in that old state of Wu may not appear too secure, but they have popularity to appeal to. You can gain support but win no success there. “The Region of Jingzhou in the north rests on the two Rivers Han and Mian; their interests lie in all to the south of them; on the east they touch Wu and on the west they extend to the ancient states of Ba and Shu. This is the area in which decisive battles have to be won, and one must hold it in order to be secure, and Heaven has virtually made it yours. “The Region of Yiazhou in the west is an important place, fertile and extensive, a country favored of Heaven and that through which the Founder of Han obtained the empire. Its ruler Liu Zhang is ignorant and weak. The people are noble and the country prosperous, but he does not know how to hold it all, and all the able people of the region are yearning for an enlightened prince. “As you are a scion of the Family, well known throughout the land as trusty and righteous, a whole hearted hero, who greatly desires to win the support of the wise, if you get possession of Yiazhou and Jingzhou, if on the west you are in harmony with the Rong Tribes, on the south win over the ancient states of Yi and Viet, make an alliance with Sun Quan of Wu, and maintain good government, you can await confidently the day when Heaven shall offer you the desired opportunity. Then you may depute a worthy leader to go to the northeast while you take command of an expedition to the northwest, and will you not find the warmest welcome prepared for you by the people? This done the completion of the task will be easy. The Hans will be restored. And these are my counsels in all these operations if you will only undertake them.” Zhuge Liang paused while he bade the lad bring out a map. As this was unrolled Zhuge Liang went on, “There you see the fifty-four counties of the west. Should you wish to take the overlordship, you will yield to Cao Cao in the north till the time of Heaven be come, to Sun Quan in the south till the Earth may become favorable. You, General, will be the lord of Human and complete the trinity. Jingzhou is to be taken first as a home, the Western Land of Rivers next for the foundation of domination. When you are firmly established, you can lay your plans for the attainment of the whole empire.” As Zhuge Liang ceased his harangue, Liu Bei left his place and saluted him, saying, “Your words, O Master, render everything so clear that the clouds are swept aside and I see the clear sky. But Jingzhou belongs to Liu Biao, my kinsman, and Yiazhou to another kinsman Liu Zhang; I could hardly take the lands from them.” “I have studied the stars and I know Liu Biao is not long for this world; the other is not the sort of man to endure. Both places will certainly fall to you.” Liu Bei bowed his acknowledgments. And so, in one conversation, Zhuge Liang proved that he, who had lived in complete retirement all his life, knew and foresaw the tripod division into which the empire was to break. True, indeed, is it that throughout all the ages no one has ever equaled his intelligence and mastery of the situation. Behold, when Liu Bei frets that he is weak, Then Sleeping-Dragon is not far to seek;"

却說玄德撞出西門，行無數里，前有大溪，攔住去路。那檀溪闊數丈，水通湘江，其波甚緊。玄德到溪邊，見不可渡，勒馬再回，遙望城西塵頭大起，追兵將至。玄德曰：“今番死矣！”遂回馬到溪邊。回頭看時，追兵已近。玄德着慌，縱馬下溪。行不數步，馬前蹄忽陷，浸濕衣袍。玄德乃加鞭大呼曰：“的盧！的盧！今日妨吾！”言畢，那馬忽從水中湧身而起，一躍三丈，飛上西岸。玄德如從雲霧中起。後來蘇學士有古風一篇，單咏躍馬檀溪事。詩曰：,"But he said that Xuande ran out of the west gate and traveled countless miles, and there was a big stream in front of him, blocking his way. The Tanxi River is several feet wide, and the water flows through the Xiangjiang River, and its waves are very tight. Xuande went to the stream, and he couldn't see it, so he stopped his horse and went back, looking at the west of the city, the dust head was rising, and the chasing troops were approaching. Xuande said, ""I'm dead today!"" Then he returned to the horse and went to the stream. When I looked back, the pursuers were approaching. Xuande panicked and drove his horse down the stream. After walking for a few steps, the horse's front hooves suddenly sag, soaking his robes. Xuande added the whip and shouted: ""My Lu! My Lu! Stop me today!"" After saying this, the horse suddenly jumped up from the water, jumped three feet, and flew to the west bank. Xuan Deru rose from the clouds. Later, Su Xueshi wrote an ancient style article, single-handedly chanting the matter of the horse on the Tanxi River. The poem says:","Xuande is riding hard but comes up against a broad, fast-flowing river, the Tan. Turning around, he sees the cloud of dust raised by the pursuing troops. In despair Xuande has no option but to trust to his horse to ford the river. This horse, whom many have claimed was cursed because of strange markings on his face, is able to heroically leap through the waters, struggle out of the grip of the mud on the far side and bring Xuande safely to the far bank. The poet Su Dong Po wrote this poem:","As has been said Liu Bei burst out at the west gate. Before he had gone far there rolled before him a river barring the way. It was the Tan Torrent, many score spans in width, which pours its waters into the River Xiang. Its current was very swift. Liu Bei reached the bank and saw the river was unfordable. So he turned his horse and rode back. Then, not far off, he saw a cloud of dust and knew that his pursuers were therein. He thought that it was all over. However, he turned again toward the swift river, and seeing the soldiers now quite near, plunged into the stream. A few paces, and he felt the horse's fore legs floundering in front while the water rose over the skirt of his robe. Then he plied the whip furiously, crying, “Dilu, Dilu, why betray me?” Whereupon the good steed suddenly reared up out of the water and, with one tremendous leap, was on the western bank. Liu Bei felt as if he had come out of the clouds. In after years the famous court official, Su Dongpo, wrote a poem on this leap over the Tan Torrent:"
却說玄德正安排禮物，欲往隆中謁諸葛亮，忽人報：“門外有一先生，峨冠博帶，道貌非常，特來相探。”玄德曰：“此莫非卽孔明否？”遂整衣出迎。視之，乃司馬徽也。玄德大喜，請入後堂高坐，拜問曰：“備自別仙顏，日因軍務倥偬，有失拜訪。今得光降，大慰仰慕之私。”徽曰：“聞徐元直在此，特來一會。”玄德曰：“近因曹操囚其母，徐母遣人馳書喚回許昌去矣。”徽曰：“此中曹操之計矣！吾素聞徐母最賢，雖為操所囚，必不肯馳書召其子：此書必詐也。元直不去，其母尚存；今若去，母必死矣。”玄德驚問其故。徽曰：“徐母高義，必羞見其子也。”玄德曰：“元直臨行，薦南陽諸葛亮，其人若何？”徽笑曰：“元直欲去，自去便了，何又惹他出來嘔心血也？”玄德曰：“先生何出此言？”徽曰：“孔明與博陵崔州平、潁川石廣元、汝南孟公威與徐元直四人為密友。此四人務於精純，惟孔明獨觀其大略。嘗抱膝長吟，而指四人曰：‘公等仕進可至刺史、郡守。’衆問孔明之志若何，孔明但笑而不答。每常自比管仲、樂毅，其才不可量也。”玄德曰：“何潁川之多賢乎！”徽曰：“昔有殷馗善觀天文，嘗謂‘羣星聚於潁分，其地必多賢士。’”時雲長在側曰：“某聞管仲、樂毅乃春秋、戰國名人，功蓋寰宇。孔明自比此二人，毋乃太過？”徽笑曰：“以吾觀之，不當比此二人；我欲另以二人比之。”雲長問：“那二人？”徽曰：“可比興周八百年之姜子牙、旺漢四百年之張子房也。”衆皆愕然。徽下階相辭欲行。玄德留之不住。徽出門仰天大笑曰：“臥龍雖得其主，不得其時，惜哉！”言罷，飄然而去。玄德歎曰：“眞隱居賢士也！”,"But he said that Xuande was arranging gifts and wanted to visit Zhuge Liang in Longzhong. Suddenly, people reported: ""There is a gentleman outside the door, with Eguanbo belt, and he has a very good moral appearance. ""Then dressed up and went out to greet him. Look at it, it is Sima Hui also. Xuande was overjoyed. He asked to sit in the back hall and asked: ""Prepare to say goodbye to Xianyan, but because of military affairs, I missed visiting. Now that the light comes down, I greatly comfort those I admire."" Hui said: ""I heard Xu Yuanzhi. Here, I have a special meeting."" Xuande said: ""Recently, because Cao Cao imprisoned her mother, Xu's mother sent someone to call Xuchang back to Xuchang."" Hui said: ""This is Cao Cao's plan! I have heard Xu's mother. The most virtuous, even though he is imprisoned by Cao, he will not be willing to call his son: this book will be deceitful. If Yuan Zhi does not go away, his mother will survive; if he goes now, his mother will die."" Xuande asked why. Hui said: ""Xu's mother is very righteous, and she will be ashamed to see her son."" Xuande said: ""Yuanzhi is leaving and recommends Zhuge Liang of Nanyang. Who is his person?"" Hui smiled and said, ""Yuanzhi wants to go, so he will go. Why did you provoke him to come out and work hard?"" Xuande said: ""Why did you say this?"" Hui said: ""Kong Ming and Boling Cui Zhouping, Yingchuan Shi Guangyuan, Runan Meng Gongwei and Xu Yuanzhi are close friends. In Jingchun, only Kongming looked at the outline of it alone. He tucked his knees and chanted, and pointed to the four people and said: 'The public and other officials can go to the governor and the county governor.' I often compare myself to Guan Zhong and Le Yi, and their talents are immeasurable."" Xuande said, ""He Yingchuan is so wise!"" Hui said, ""In the past, Yin Kui was good at astronomy, and it was said that 'the stars gather in Yingfen, the place where the There must be more wise men.'"" Shi Yunchang said from the side: ""Someone heard that Guan Zhong and Le Yi were famous people in the Spring and Autumn Period and the Warring States Period, and their merits covered the world. Kong Ming has compared these two people, isn't it too much?"" Hui smiled and said: ""I Looking at it, it is not appropriate to compare these two people; I want to compare them with another two people."" Yun Chang asked, ""What two people?"" Hui said: ""It is comparable to Jiang Ziya who lived in the Xingzhou period for 800 years, and Zhang Zifang who lived in the Wanghan Dynasty for 400 years. Yes."" Everyone was stunned. Emblem under the order to say goodbye to each other. Xuande could not stay. Hui went out and looked up to the sky and laughed loudly: ""Although Wolong has its master, it is a pity that it is not in the right time!"" After saying this, he floated away. Xuande sighed and said, ""It is true that a wise man lives in seclusion!""","At last they come upon the hill and its valley. Both seem as if they are wrapped in a mystic air of great beauty. They ride up to the door of a simple rural hut, and a young man appears in the doorway. ‘Who are you?’ asks the young man, to which Xuande replies, giving all his formal titles: ‘I am Liu Bei Xuande, general commander of the Han empire, lord of Yicheng, prefect of Yuzhou, uncle of his majesty the emperor and I have come to greet your master.’ ‘Well,’ says the young man, ‘there is no way I can remember all that lot.’ Humbled, Xuande says, ‘Then just say to the master that Xuande came calling.’","As has been said Liu Bei prepared gifts to offer to Zhuge Liang on his visit. One day his servants announced a stranger of extraordinary appearance, wearing a lofty head-dress and a wide belt. “Surely this is he” said Liu Bei, and, hastily arranging his dress, he went to welcome the visitor. But the first glance showed him that it was the recluse of the mountains, Sima Hui. However, Liu Bei was glad to see him and led him into the inner apartment as he would an old friend. There Liu Bei conducted him to the seat of honor and made his obeisance, saying, “Since leaving you that day in the mountains I have been overwhelmed with military preparations and so have failed to visit you as courtesy demanded. Now that the brightness has descended upon me, I hope this dereliction of duty may be pardoned.” “I hear Xu Shu is here. I have come expressly to see him,” replied Water-Mirror bluntly. “He has lately left for Xuchang. A messenger came with a letter telling of the imprisonment of his mother.” “Then he has just fallen into Cao Cao's trap, for that letter was a forgery. I have known his mother to be a very noble woman; and even if she were imprisoned by Cao Cao, she would not summon her son like that. Certainly the letter was a forgery. If the son did not go, the mother would be safe; if he went, she would be a dead woman.” “But how?” asked Liu Bei dismayed. “She is a woman of the highest principles, who would be greatly mortified at the sight of her son under such conditions.” Liu Bei said, “Just as your friend was leaving he mentioned the name of a certain Zhuge Liang. What think you of him?” Water-Mirror laughed, saying, “If Xu Shu wanted to go, he was free to go. But why did he want to provoke Zhuge Liang into coming out and showing compassion for some one else?” “Why do you speak like that?” asked Liu Bei. He replied, “Five persons, Zhuge Liang of Nanyang, Cui Zhouping of Boling, Shi Guangyuan of Yingchuan, Meng Gongwei of Runan, and Xu Shu of Yingchuan were the closest of friends. They formed a little coterie devoted to meditation on essential refinement. Only Zhuge Liang arrived at a perception of its meaning. He used to sit among them with his arms about his knees muttering and then, pointing to his companions, he would say, 'You, gentlemen, would become governors and protectors if you were in official life.' “When they asked him what was his ambition, he would only smile and always compared himself with the great ancient scholars Guan Zhong and Yue Yi. No one could gauge his talents.” “How comes it that Yingchuan produces so many able humans?” said Liu Bei. “That old astrologer, Yin Kui, used to say that the stars clustered thick over the region and so there were many wise humans.” Now Guan Yu was there; and when he heard Zhuge Liang so highly praised, he said, “Guan Zhong and Yue Yi are the two most famous leaders mentioned in the Spring and Autumn and the Warring States Periods. They well overtopped the rest of humankind. Is it not a little too much to say that Zhuge Liang compares with these two?” “In my opinion he should not be compared with these two, but rather with two others,” said Water-Mirror. “Who are these two?” asked Guan Yu. “One of them is Lu Wang, who laid the foundations of the Zhou Dynasty so firmly that it lasted eight hundred years; and the other Zhang Liang, who made the Han glorious for four centuries.” Before the surprise called forth by this startling statement had subsided, Water-Mirror walked down the steps and took his leave. Liu Bei would have kept him if he could, but he was obdurate. As he stalked proudly away, he threw up his head and said, “Though Sleeping-Dragon has found his lord, he has not been born at the right time. It is a pity.” “What a wise hermit!” was Liu Bei's comment."

張郃見了，大驚而退。趙雲縱馬正走，背後忽有二將大叫：“趙雲休走。”前面又有二將，使兩般軍器，截住去路：後面趕的是馬延、張顗，前面阻的是焦觸、張南，都是袁紹手下降將。趙雲力戰四將，曹軍一齊擁至。雲乃拔靑釭劍亂砍。手起處，衣甲平過，血如湧泉。殺退衆軍將，直透重圍。,"Zhang He saw this and fled in shock. Zhao Yun was walking on his horse, and suddenly two generals behind him shouted, ""Zhao Yunxiu, go."" There were two generals in front, and they used two kinds of weapons to block the way: Ma Yan and Zhang Yi were behind, and those in front were blocking the way. Jiao Touch and Zhang Nan were Yuan Shao's descendants. Zhao Yun fought against the four generals, and Cao's army came together. Yun Nai pulled out his sword and slashed. At the beginning of the hand, the clothes and armor are flat, and the blood is like a gushing spring. Kill the army generals and go straight through the siege.","Terrified, Zhang He turns and escapes from this supernatural force, while Zilong and the child ride on. Again he is attacked, this time by four men, but swinging his mighty sword in his fury, he kills them all and rides on again.","This apparition frightened Zhang He, who abandoned the pursuit forthwith, and Zhao Yun rode off. Presently he heard shouts behind, “Zhao Yun, Zhao Yun, stop!” and at the same time he saw ahead of him two generals who seemed disposed to dispute his way. Ma Yan and Zhang Yi following and Jiao Chu and Zhang Nan in front, his state seemed desperate, but Zhao Yun quailed not. As the men of Cao Cao came pressing on, Zhao Yun drew Cao Cao's own sword to beat them off. Nothing could resist the Blue Blade Sword. Armor, clothing, it went through without effort and blood gushed forth in fountains wherever it struck. So the four generals were soon beaten off, and Zhao Yun was once again free."
一日，操見關公所穿綠錦戰袍已舊，卽度其身品，取異錦作戰袍一領相贈。關公受之，穿於衣底，上仍用舊袍罩之。操笑曰：“雲長何如此之儉乎？”公曰：“某非儉也：舊袍乃劉皇叔所賜，某穿之如見兄面，不敢以丞相之新賜而忘兄長之舊賜，故穿於上。”操歎曰：“眞義士也！”然口雖稱羨，心實不悅。一日，關公在府，忽報：“內院二夫人哭倒於地，不知為何，請將軍速入。”關公乃整衣跪於內門外，問二嫂為何悲泣。甘夫人曰：“我夜夢皇叔身陷於土坑之內，覺來與糜夫人論之，想在九泉之下矣：是以相哭。”關公曰：“夢寐之事，不可憑信。此嫂嫂想念之故。請勿憂愁。”,"One day, Cao Cao saw that the green brocade shirt worn by Guan Gong was old, so he adjusted his body and took a different brocade shirt as a gift. Guan Gong accepted it and wore it on the bottom of his clothes, still covering it with an old robe. Cao laughed and said, ""Why is Yun Chang so frugal?"" Gong said, ""Someone is not frugal: the old robe was given by Liu Huangshu, and one wears it as if seeing his brother's face. It is a gift, so I wear it on top."" Cao sighed and said, ""A true righteous man!"" Although he praised him, he was really unhappy. One day, when Guan Gong was in the house, he suddenly reported: ""The second lady in the inner courtyard fell to the ground crying. I don't know why, please enter quickly."" Mrs. Gan said: ""My uncle is trapped in a pit of earth in the night dream, and I feel that I have come to discuss it with Mrs. Mi, and I want to be under the Jiuquan: so I cry together."" Guan Gong said: ""The dream thing cannot be trusted. This sister-in-law misses you. Don't worry.""","To his surprise, Guan Yu puts it on and then puts the old one on top. When asked why, he says that, as Xuande gave him the old one, it reminds him of his brother. While this again impresses Cao Cao, it also alarms him, as it is clear his strategy to win Guan Yu over is not working. In the midst of all the plotting and scheming of Cao Cao’s court, Guan Yu tries to keep up the spirits of his sisters-in-law. One day they have similar dreams, which convinces them that Xuande is dead. Not just dead but in Hell. Guan Yu reassures them: ‘Dreams don’t show the truth. Have no fear.’","Taking his measurements, Cao Cao had a new one made of fine brocade and presented it to him. Guan Yu took it and put it on under the old robe, so that the latter covered it. “Why so very thrifty?” laughed Cao Cao. “It is not thrift,” was his reply. “The old robe was a gift from my brother, and I wear it because it reminds me of him. I could not allow the new gift to eclipse his old one.” “How very high principled!” said Cao Cao, sighing. One day when Guan Yu was at home, there came a messenger to say that the two women had thrown themselves on the ground and were weeping. They would not say why. Guan Yu set his dress in order, went over, and knelt by the door, saying, “Why this grief, Sisters-in-Law?” Lady Gan replied, “In the night I dreamed that the Uncle had fallen into a pit. I woke up and told Lady Mi, and we think he must be dead. So we weep.” “Dreams are not to be credited,” he replied. “You dreamed of him because you were thinking of him. Pray do not grieve.”"
玄德親至武陵安民畢，馳書報雲長，言翼德、子龍各得一郡。雲長乃回書上請曰：“聞長沙尚未取，如兄長不以弟為不才，敎關某幹這件功勞甚好。”玄德大喜，遂敎張飛星夜去替雲長守荊州，令雲長來取長沙。雲長旣至，入見玄德、孔明。孔明曰：“子龍取桂陽，翼德取武陵，都是三千軍去。今長沙太守韓玄，固不足道。只是他有一員大將，乃南陽人：姓黃，名忠，字漢升；是劉表帳下中郎將，與劉表之姪劉磐共守長沙，後事韓玄；雖今年近六旬，却有萬夫不當之勇，不可輕敵。雲長去，必須多帶軍馬。”雲長曰：“軍師何故長別人銳氣，滅自己威風？量一老卒，何足道哉！關某不須用三千軍，只消本部下五百名校刀手，決定斬黃忠、韓玄之首，獻來麾下。”玄德苦擋。雲長不依，只領五百校刀手而去。孔明謂玄德曰：“雲長輕敵黃忠，只恐有失。主公當往接應。”玄德從之，隨後引兵望長沙進發。,"Xuande went to Wuling to settle down in person, and he wrote a book to report Yunchang, Yan Yide and Zilong each won a county. Yun Changnai replied to the letter and asked, ""I heard that Changsha has not been taken yet. If the elder brother does not regard his younger brother as a lack of talent, it is very good to teach Guan to do this."" Let Yunchang come to take Changsha. Yun Changyan arrived, and came to see Xuande and Kongming. Kong Ming said: ""Zilong took Guiyang, Yide took Wuling, all three thousand troops went. Han Xuan, the prefect of Changsha today, is insignificant. But he has a general, who is from Nanyang: surnamed Huang, given name Zhong, styled Han Sheng; he is a general under Liu Biao's account, who guards Changsha with Liu Biao's concubine Liu Pan, and Han Xuan will be behind. Although he is nearly sixty years old this year, he has the courage of ten thousand husbands and should not underestimate the enemy. When Yun Chang goes away, he must bring more troops and horses. ""Yun Chang said, ""Why does a strategist make other people's arrogance and destroy his own prestige? How can he count one old soldier! Guan does not need to use three thousand troops, but only needs five hundred school swordsmen under his subordinates, and decides to kill Huang Zhong and Han Xuanzhi. First, offer it to your subordinates."" Xuande resisted bitterly. Yun Chang did not obey, and only led the five hundred school swordsmen away. Kong Ming said to Xuande: ""Yunchang underestimates the enemy Huang Zhong, and he is only afraid of losing. The lord should go to meet him."" Xuande followed, and then led his troops to look at Changsha.","Once again Xuande reassures the population of a captured city that they will not be harmed. When Guan Yu hears that Zilong has taken Guiyang and Zhang Fei has taken Wuling, he writes back that he wants to now go and take Changsha. Guan Yu comes to discuss the attack with Kong Ming. ‘The governor of Changsha, Han Xuan, is no problem, but beware of General Huang Zhong from Nanyang. He’s almost sixty, but do not underestimate him. To win you’ll need more than the three thousand troops Zilong and Zhang Fei had …’ but Guan Yu interrupts him. ‘Why are you trying to discourage me when you praise others? This old soldier doesn’t worry me. I won’t need the three thousand. I’ll take my own band of five hundred fighters and shortly I’ll bring you the heads of Huang Zhong and Han Xuan.’ After he has gone, Kong Ming tells Xuande that he fears Guan Yu will fail and suggests that they set off after him to offer support, should that be needed. And so it is that Xuande and Kong Ming also head for Changsha.","Soon after Liu Bei came to Wuling in person and soothed the people. This done he wrote to Guan Yu telling him Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei had gained a territory each. Guan Yu at once wrote back and said, “Changsha is yet to be taken; and if I am not thought too feeble, I would like to be sent to attack it.” Liu Bei agreed and sent Zhang Fei to relieved his brother, whom Liu Bei ordered to return and prepare for an expedition to Changsha. Guan Yu came and went in to see his elder brother and Zhuge Liang. At this interview Zhuge Liang said, “Zhao Yun has taken Guiyang, and Zhang Fei Wuling. Both successful warriors have done their work with three thousand troops. The Governor of Changsha, Han Xuan, was not worth mentioning, but there was a certain general with him, named Huang Zhong, who had to be reckoned with. “Huang Zhong is a native of Nanyang. He used to be in the service of Liu Biao and was a colleague Liu Biao's nephew, Liu Pan, when he was in command of Changsha. After Liu Biao's death, he joined Han Xuan when he took command of the city. Now, although he is nearly sixty, he is a man to be feared and a warrior of a thousand. You ought to take a larger number of troops.” Guan Yu replied, “Instructor, what makes you damp another man's ardor to fight and do away with your own dignity? I do not think the old leader need be discussed, and I do not think I require three companies of soldiers. Give me my own five hundred of swordsmen, and I will have the heads of both Han Xuan and Huang Zhong to sacrifice to our standard.” Liu Bei resisted this decision of Guan Yu, but Guan Yu would not give way. He just took his five hundred and set out. “If he is not careful how he attacks Huang Zhong, there will be a mishap,” said Zhuge Liang. “You must go to support him.” Liu Bei accordingly, at the head of another and larger party, set out toward Changsha."

却說董承等問馬騰曰：“公欲用何人？”馬騰曰：“見有豫州牧劉玄德在此，何不求之？”承曰：“此人雖係皇叔，今正依附曹操，安肯行此事耶？”騰曰：“吾觀前日圍場之中，曹操迎受衆賀之時，雲長在玄德背後，挺刀欲殺操，玄德以目視之而止。玄德非不欲圖操，恨操牙爪多，恐力不及耳。公試求之，當必應允。”吳碩曰：“此事不宜太速，當從容商議。”衆皆散去。次日黑夜裏，董承懷詔，逕往玄德公館中來。門吏入報，玄德迎出，請入小閣坐定。關、張侍立於側。玄德曰：“國舅夤夜至此，必有事故。”承曰：“白日乘馬相訪，恐操見疑，故黑夜相見。”玄德命取酒相待。承曰：“前日圍場之中，雲長欲殺曹操，將軍動目搖頭而退之，何也？”玄德失驚曰：“公何以知之？”承曰：“人皆不見，某獨見之。”玄德不能隱諱，遂曰：“舍弟見操僭越，故不覺發怒耳。”承掩面而哭曰：“朝廷臣子，若盡如雲長，何憂不太平哉！”玄德恐是曹操使他來試探，乃佯言曰：“曹丞相治國，為何憂不太平？”承變色而起曰：“公乃漢朝皇叔，故剖肝瀝膽以相告，公何詐也？”玄德曰：“恐國舅有詐，故相試耳。”於是董承取衣帶詔令觀之。玄德不勝悲憤。又將義狀出示，上止有六位：一，車騎將軍董承；二，工部侍郎王子服；三，長水校尉种輯；四，議郎吳碩；五，昭信將軍吳子蘭；六，西涼太守馬騰。玄德曰：“公旣奉詔討賊，備敢不効犬馬之勞。”承拜謝，便請書名。玄德亦書“左將軍劉備”，押了字，付承收訖。承曰：“尚容再請三人，共聚十義，以圖國賊。”玄德曰：“切宜緩緩施行，不可輕洩。”共議到五更，相別去了。,"However, Dong Cheng and others asked Ma Teng, ""Who do you want to use?"" Ma Teng said, ""Seeing that Liu Xuande, the shepherd of Yuzhou, is here, why not ask for him?"" Cheng said, ""Although this man is the emperor's uncle, he is currently relying on Cao Cao. Are you safe to do this?"" Teng said, ""I saw that in the paddock the day before yesterday, when Cao Cao greeted the audience, Yun Chang stood behind Xuande, holding his sword and trying to kill Cao, but Xuande looked at him and stopped. Defei doesn't want to try to exercise, and hates to have too many teeth and claws, and he is afraid that he will not be able to listen to his ears. If the public tries to ask for it, he must agree."" Wu Shuo said: ""This matter should not be rushed, and should be discussed calmly."" The crowd dispersed. In the dark night of the next day, Dong Chenghuai ordered to go to Xuande's mansion. The doorman entered the newspaper, Xuande welcomed him out, and asked to sit down in the small pavilion. Guan and Zhang Shi stood on the side. Xuande said: ""Uncle Kui is here at night, so there must be an accident."" Cheng said, ""We visit each other on horseback in the daytime, and I'm afraid that Cao Cao will be suspicious, so we will meet each other at night."" Xuande ordered to drink wine. Cheng said: ""The day before yesterday, in the paddock, Yun Chang wanted to kill Cao Cao, but the general moved his eyes and shook his head and retreated. Why?"" Xuande was startled and asked, ""How did you know about it?"" Cheng said: ""Everyone doesn't see him, he sees only one person. It is.” Xuande couldn’t hide it, so he said, “My brother-in-law saw Cao’s arrogance, so he didn’t realize that he was angry.” Cheng covered his face and wept, “If the court officials are as tall as clouds, why worry about not being peaceful!” Xuan Tak was afraid that Cao Cao would send him to test him, so he pretended to say: ""Prime Minister Cao is ruling the country, why is he worried about not being peaceful?"" Cheng changed his color and stood up and said, ""Your Excellency is the uncle of the Emperor of the Han Dynasty. Also?"" Xuande said, ""I was afraid that the uncle of the country would be deceived, so he tried his ears."" So Dong Cheng took the robe and ordered him to observe him. Xuande was extremely sad and angry. He also presented the letter of righteousness, and there were six at the top: first, the general of the chariot and cavalry, Dong Cheng; second, the servant of the Ministry of Industry, Wang Zifu; Sixth, Ma Teng, the prefect of Xiliang. Xuande said: ""Gong Yan has been ordered to punish the thieves, so be prepared to be ineffective."" After thanking him, he asked for the book title. Xuande also wrote ""Liu Bei, the left general"", and he signed the word and paid for it. Cheng said: ""Shangrong invites three more people to gather together for ten righteousness, in order to plan the country's thieves."" Xuande said: ""It should be carried out slowly and not let it go lightly.""","‘Xuande,’ says Ma Teng to the surprise of the others. ‘Really? I mean,’ says Dong Cheng, ‘he is related to the imperial family but he is also a close ally of Cao Cao himself. He won’t take the risk.’ ‘I saw what happened during the hunt. Guan Yu would have slain Cao Cao but for Xuande’s intervention. Xuande could see that they were outnumbered. But given the chance to succeed, I’m sure he will jump at the opportunity.’ So it is agreed that Dong Cheng will quietly probe to see if Xuande will join the conspiracy. At first, the interview doesn’t seem to be going the way Dong Cheng had hoped. When he mentions Guan Yu ’s actions at the hunt, Xuande seems to defend Cao Cao. But slowly, little by little, the two men begin to open up to each other until Xuande finally concedes that he has been testing Dong Cheng, worried that he has been sent by Cao Cao to check on his loyalty. Finally he too signs his name on the white silk sheet and commits himself to the overthrow of Cao Cao. Xuande is only too aware of the dangers of attracting Cao Cao’s suspicions and so he buries himself in working in his garden, apparently having no interest in the affairs of state. Imagine, then, his horror on being invited to visit Cao Cao in his home. A smiling Cao Cao greets him, and warmed wine and delicacies are set before them as they sit in Cao Cao’s garden pavilion. Everything Cao Cao says seems to the frightened Xuande to be loaded with inauspicious meaning, as if Cao Cao already knows about the plot. At one point Cao Cao spots a dark cloud formation which looks like a dragon. As they lean on a balustrade in Cao’s garden watching the cloud, Cao Cao asks, ‘What do you know about dragons?’ ‘Not a lot,’ confesses Xuande.","was the question on the lips of the conspirators. Ma Teng's reply was, “The Imperial Protector of Yuzhou, Liu Bei. He is here and we will ask him to help.” “Though he is an uncle of the Emperor, he is at present a partisan of our enemy, and he will not join,” said Dong Cheng. “But I saw something at the hunt,” said Ma Teng. “When Cao Cao advanced to acknowledge the congratulations due to the Emperor, Liu Bei's sworn brother Guan Yu was behind him, and grasped his sword as if to cut down Cao Cao. However, Liu Bei signed to him to hold his hand and he did. Liu Bei would willingly destroy Cao Cao, only he thinks Cao Cao's teeth and claws are too many. You must ask Liu Bei, and he will surely consent.” Here Wu Shi urged caution, saying, “Do not go too fast. Let us consider the thing most carefully.” They dispersed. Next day after dark Dong Cheng went to Liu Bei's lodging taking with him the decree. As soon as Dong Cheng was announced, Liu Bei came to greet him and led him into a private room where they could talk freely. The two younger brothers were there as well. “It must be something unusually important that has brought Uncle Dong Cheng here tonight,” said Liu Bei. “If I had ridden forth by daylight, Cao Cao might have suspected something, so I came by night.” Wine was brought in, and while they were drinking Dong Cheng said, “Why did you check your brother the other day at the hunt, when he was going to attack Cao Cao?” Liu Bei was startled and said, “How did you know?” “Nobody noticed but I saw.” Liu Bei could not prevaricate and said, “It was the presumption of the man that made my brother so angry; Guan Yu could not help it.” The visitor covered his face and wept. “Ah,” said he, “if all the court ministers were like Guan Yu, there would be no sighs for lack of tranquillity.” Now Liu Bei felt that possibly Cao Cao had sent his visitor to try him, so he cautiously replied, “Where are the sighs for lack of tranquillity while Cao Cao is at the head of affairs?” Dong Cheng changed color and rose from his seat. “You, Sir, are a relative of His Majesty, and so I showed you my inmost feelings. Why did you mislead me?” But Liu Bei said, “Because I feared you might be misleading me, and I wanted to find out.” At this Dong Cheng drew out the decree he had received and showed it. His host was deeply moved. Then Dong Cheng produced the pledge. There were only six names to it, and these were Dong Cheng, Wang Zifu, Chong Ji, Wu Shi, Wu Zilan, and Ma Teng. “Since you have a decree like this, I cannot but do my share,” said Liu Bei, and at Dong Cheng's request he added his name and signature to the others and handed it back. “Now let us but get three more, which will make ten, and we shall be ready to act.” “But you must move with great caution and not let this get abroad,” said Liu Bei. The two remained talking till an early hour in the morning when the visitor left."

却說曹操連得二書，心中疑惑不定，聚衆謀士商議曰：“江左甘寧，被周瑜所辱，願為內應；黃蓋受責，令闞澤來納降；俱未可深信。誰敢直入周瑜寨中，探聽實信？”蔣幹進曰：“某前日空往東吳，未得成功，深懷慚愧。今願捨身再往，務得實信，回報丞相。”操大喜，卽時令蔣幹上船。幹駕小舟，逕到江南水寨邊，便使人傳報。周瑜聽得幹又到，大喜曰：“吾之成功，只在此人身上！”遂囑付魯肅：“請龐士元來，為我如此如此。”原來襄陽龐統，字士元，因避亂寓居江東。魯肅曾薦之於周瑜，統未及往見。瑜先使肅問計於統曰：“破曹當用何策？”統密謂肅曰：“欲破曹兵，須用火攻；但大江面上，一船着火，餘船四散；除非獻‘連環計’，敎他釘作一處，然後功可成也。”肅以告瑜，瑜深服其論，因謂肅曰：“為我行此計者，非龐士元不可。”肅曰：“只怕曹操奸猾，如何去得？”,"However, he said that Cao Cao had obtained two books in a row, and he was doubtful in his heart. He gathered a group of counselors to discuss and said: ""Jiang Zuo Gan Ning, who was insulted by Zhou Yu, would like to be an internal response; Huang Gai was punished and ordered Kan Ze to come to accept the surrender. Zhou Yuzhai, inquire about the truth?"" Jiang Ganjin said: ""A certain day before I went to Soochow Wu, but I failed, and I am deeply ashamed. Now I would like to give up my life and go again, be pragmatic and faithful, and repay the Prime Minister."" Dry on board. I drove a small boat and went to the water village in the south of the Yangtze River, and I made people report it. When Zhou Yu heard it again, he was overjoyed and said, ""My success is only in this person!"" Then he asked Fu Lusu: ""Please come to Pang Shiyuan and do this for me."" Live in Jiangdong. Lu Su had recommended him to Zhou Yu, but he never met him. Yu first sent Su to ask Ji Yutong and said, ""What strategy should I use to break Cao Cao?"" Tong Mi said to Su, ""If you want to break Cao's army, you must use fire to attack; but on the big river, a boat caught fire, and the rest of the boats scattered; unless Offer a 'serial plan', teach him to nail it in one place, and then the success can be accomplished."" Su told Yu, and Yu was deeply convinced by his argument, so Su said: ""Pang Shiyuan is the one who did this plan for me."" Su. Said: ""I'm afraid Cao Cao is cunning, how can I get it?""","However, despite the two letters which corroborate each other, Cao Cao is still not convinced this isn’t a trick. So he decides to send a spy into the enemy camp. At the request for a volunteer, it is once again Jiang Gan who offers, saying that he is still embarrassed by his first attempt and consequent failure to lure Zhou Yu to join Cao Cao. Zhou Yu is delighted when news comes of Jiang Gan’s return, as he realizes he is about to fool Cao Cao once again. As part of his plan he calls for Pang Tong to come and attend him. Now Pang Tong, also known as Master Young Phoenix, is himself an exile from the north and its troubles. Known as a strategist, he has already offered advice to Lu Su, who has shared this with Zhou Yu. Pang Tong has advocated the use of fire but has also pointed out that if each ship is independent of the others then the moment a fire starts on one ship the others will simply slip away. The answer is to get them all tied together – then success will be assured. Zhou Yu orders Jiang Gan brought to him, but Jiang is troubled that Zhou doesn’t come down to meet him.","However, when Cao Cao got these two letters, he was still doubtful and called together his advisers to talk over the matter. Said he, “On the other side Gan Ning has been put to shame by the Commander-in-Chief whom he is prepared to betray for the sake of revenge. Huang Gai has been punished and sent Kan Ze to propose that he should come over to our side. Only I still distrust the whole thing. Who will go over to the camp to find out the real truth?” Then Jiang Gan spoke up, saying, “I failed in my mission the other day and am greatly mortified. I will risk my life again and, this time, I shall surely bring good news.” Cao Cao approved of him as messenger and bade him start. Jiang Gan set out in a small craft and speedily arrived in the Three Gorges, landing near the naval camp. Then he sent to inform Zhou Yu, who hearing who it was chuckled, saying, “Success depends upon this man.” Then Zhou Yu called Lu Su and told him to call Pang Tong to come and do certain things for him. This Pang Tong was from Xiangyang. And he had gone to the east of the river to get away from the strife. Lu Su had recommended him to Zhou Yu, but he had not yet presented himself. When Zhou Yu sent Lu Su to ask what scheme of attack he would recommend against Cao Cao, Pang Tong had said to Lu Su, “You must use fire against him. But the river is wide and if one ship is set on fire, the others will scatter unless they are fastened together so that they must remain in one place. That is the one road to success.” Lu Su took this message to the General, who pondered over it and then said, “The only person who can manage this is Pang Tong himself.” “Cao Cao is very wily;” said Lu Su, “how can Pang Tong go?”"

却說夏侯惇與于禁等引兵至博望，分一半精兵作前隊，其餘盡護糧車而行。時當秋月，商飆徐起。人馬趲行之間，望見前面塵頭忽起。惇便將人馬擺開，問鄕導官曰：“此間是何處？”答曰：“前面便是博望坡，後面是羅川口。”惇令于禁、李典押住陣脚，親自出馬陣前。遙望軍馬來到，惇忽然大笑。衆問：“將軍為何而笑？”惇曰：“吾笑徐元直在丞相面前，誇諸葛亮為天人；今觀其用兵，乃以此等軍馬為前部，與吾對敵，正如驅犬羊與虎豹鬥耳。吾於丞相前誇口，要活捉劉備、諸葛亮，今必應吾言矣。”遂自縱馬向前。趙雲出馬。惇罵曰：“汝等隨劉備，如孤魂隨鬼耳！”雲大怒，縱馬來戰。兩馬相交，不數合，雲詐敗而走。夏侯惇從後追趕。雲約走十餘里，回馬又戰，不數合又走。韓浩拍馬向前諫曰：“趙雲誘敵，恐有埋伏。”惇曰：“敵軍如此，雖十面埋伏，吾何懼哉！”遂不聽浩言，直趕至博望坡。一聲礮響，玄德自引軍衝將過來，接應交戰。夏侯惇笑謂韓浩曰：“此卽埋伏之兵也！吾今晚不到新野，誓不罷兵！”乃催軍前進。玄德、趙雲退後便走。,"But they said that Xiahou Dun and Yu Jin led their troops to Bowang, and divided half of the elite troops as the front team, and the rest went with the food carts. At that time, it was the autumn moon, and the business boom started. Between the people and horses, they saw the dust head suddenly rise in front of them. Dun set aside the men and horses, and asked Officer Yan, ""Where is this place?"" He replied, ""In front is Bowangpo, and in the back is Luochuankou."" front. Looking at the arrival of the army, Dun suddenly laughed. The crowd asked: ""Why is the general laughing?"" Dun said: ""I laugh at Xu Yuanzhi in front of the prime minister, praising Zhuge Liang as a man of heaven; now looking at his use of troops, he uses these troops and horses as the front to fight against me, just like driving dogs and sheep. Fighting with tigers and leopards. I boasted in front of the prime minister that I wanted to capture Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang alive, and now I will answer my words."" Then he rode his horse forward. Zhao Yun went out. Dun scolded: ""You are following Liu Bei, like a lonely soul following a ghost's ear!"" Yun was furious and sent horses to fight. The two horses crossed each other, and the cloud was cheated and defeated. Xiahou Dun chased after him. The cloud traveled about ten miles, returned to the horse and fought again, and then went away again and again. Han Hao slapped his horse forward and remonstrated, ""Zhao Yun is tempting the enemy, and there may be an ambush."" Dun said, ""The enemy is in ambush from all sides, so why should I be afraid!"" He ignored Hao's words and rushed to Bowangpo. With a loud bang, Xuande led the army to rush over to meet the battle. Xiahou Dun smiled and said to Han Hao, ""This is the soldier in ambush! I won't be in Xinye tonight, and I swear I won't give up my army!"" He urged the army to advance. Xuande and Zhao Yun stepped back and left.","Cao Cao’s advance troops are commanded by Xiahou Dun, supported by Commander Yu Jin, and as they approach Bowang they split their forces into half to go forward and half to hold back to guard the supply wagons. When Zhao Zilong appears with his small force, Xiahou Dun laughs out loud and charges forward, confident of a quick victory. Zhao Zilong does as ordered by Kong Ming and, after a brief skirmish, retreats, drawing Xiahou after him. It is at this point that another of Cao Cao’s commanders spurs his horse forward and warns Xiahou Dun that he is clearly being lured into an ambush, only to be brusquely dismissed by Xiahou Dun. Xuande joins the fray and also begins to retreat, drawing Xiahou Dun and his men deeper and deeper into a narrowing ravine.","Then half of them, the veterans, were told off for the first attack, and the remainder were to guard the baggage train and supplies. Thus they marched in two divisions. The season was autumn and a chilly wind began to blow. They pressed forward. Presently they saw a cloud of dust ahead of them, and Xiahou Dun ordered the ranks to be reformed. He questioned the guides as to the name of the place. “The place in front is Bowang Slope, and behind us is the River Luo,” was the reply. Then Xiahou Dun rode to the front to reconnoiter, leaving Yu Jin and Li Dian to finish setting out the battle array. Presently Xiahou Dun began to laugh and, when they asked the cause of this merriment, he replied, “Xu Shu praised Zhuge Liang to the very skies as something more than human. But now that I see how he has placed his soldiers and the stuff he has put into his vanguard, it seems to me that he is sending dogs or sheep against tigers and leopards. I bragged a little when I said I would take him prisoner, but I am going to make good my boast.” Then he rode forward at full speed. Zhao Yun rode to meet him, and Xiahou Dun opened a volley of abuse, “ You lot, followers of Liu Bei, are only like wraiths following devils.” This angered Zhao Yun and a combat began. In a little time Zhao Yun turned and retreated as if he was worsted. Xiahou Dun pressed after him and kept up the chase for some three miles. Then Zhao Yun suddenly turned again and offered fight; but only to retreat after a few passes. Seeing these tactics Han Hao, one of Xiahou Dun's generals, rode up to his chief and urged him to use caution, saying, “I fear he is trying to lead us into an ambush.” “With such antagonists as these, I should not fear even Ten Ambushes,” replied Xiahou Dun, pressing forward eagerly. Just as he reached the slope he heard the roar of a bomb and out came Liu Bei to attack. “Here is your ambush,” said Xiahou Dun, laughing. “I will get to Xinye this evening before I have done.” Xiahou Dun urged his soldiers forward, and his opponents retired in measure as he advanced. As evening came on, thick clouds overcast the whole sky."
話說天下大勢，分久必合，合久必分：周末七國分爭，并入於秦。及秦滅之後，楚、漢分爭，又并入於漢。漢朝自高祖斬白蛇而起義，一統天下。後來光武中興，傳至獻帝，遂分為三國。推其致亂之由，殆始於桓、靈二帝。桓帝禁錮善類，崇信宦官。及桓帝崩，靈帝卽位，大將軍竇武、太傅陳蕃，共相輔佐。時有宦官曹節等弄權，竇武、陳蕃謀誅之，機事不密，反為所害。中涓自此愈橫。,"It is said that the general trend of the world is that if it is divided for a long time, it will be united. After the Qin Dynasty was destroyed, Chu and Han were divided and merged into Han. The Han Dynasty revolted since Gaozu cut off the white snake and ruled the world. Later, Guangwu Zhongxing was passed to Emperor Xian, and it was divided into three kingdoms. The reason for the turmoil started with the two emperors Huan and Ling. Emperor Huan imprisoned the good, and believed in eunuchs. When Emperor Huan collapsed, Emperor Ling took the throne, and the general Dou Wu and Tai Fu Chen Fan all assisted each other. At that time, the eunuch Cao Jie and others tried to gain power, and Dou Wu and Chen Fan plotted to execute him. Zhongjuan has become more and more horizontal since then.","This we have known since time began. The Zhou dynasty collapsed when seven kingdoms tore apart the empire by fighting among themselves, until eventually the Qin kingdom conquered all of the other kingdoms. But the Qin did not last long, and after them came the competing forces of Chu and Han. They also fought among themselves until the Han triumphed, uniting all under Heaven into one empire again. Many years later, the empire was divided by an uprising, but unity was restored by Emperor Guang Wu, and all was well again – until, that is, the reign of Emperor Xian, when the empire split into three kingdoms. It was brought about by two previous bad emperors: Emperor Huan, who favoured eunuchs over men of distinction and integrity, and Emperor Ling, his successor, who failed to support a palace conspiracy against the eunuchs, and the instigators were executed. From that time on the eunuchs were in complete control, and nobody could stop them.","This has been so since antiquity. When the rule of the Zhou Dynasty weakened, seven contending kingdoms sprang up, warring one with another until the kingdom of Qin prevailed and possessed the empire. But when Qin's destiny had been fulfilled, arose two opposing kingdoms, Chu and Han, to fight for the mastery. And Han was the victor. The rise of the fortunes of Han began when Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor slew a white serpent to raise the banners of uprising, which only ended when the whole empire belonged to Han (BC 202). This magnificent heritage was handed down in successive Han emperors for two hundred years, till the rebellion of Wang Mang caused a disruption. But soon Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder restored the empire, and Han emperors continued their rule for another two hundred years till the days of Emperor Xian, which were doomed to see the beginning of the empire's division into three parts, known to history as The Three Kingdoms. But the descent into misrule hastened in the reigns of the two predecessors of Emperor Xian—Emperors Huan and Ling—who sat in the Dragon Throne about the middle of the second century. Emperor Huan paid no heed to the good people of his court, but gave his confidence to the Palace eunuchs. He lived and died, leaving the scepter to Emperor Ling, whose advisers were Regent Marshal Dou Wu and Imperial Guardian Chen Fan. Dou Wu and Chen Fan, disgusted with the abuses of the eunuchs in the affairs of the state, plotted the destruction for the power-abusing eunuchs. But Chief Eunuch Cao Jie was not to be disposed of easily. The plot leaked out, and the honest Dou Wu and Chen Fan were put to death, leaving the eunuchs stronger than before."
且說曹操當日對何進曰：“宦官之禍，古今皆有；但世主不當假之權寵，使至於此。若欲治罪，當除元惡，但付一獄吏足矣，何必紛紛召外兵乎？欲盡誅之，事必宣露。吾料其必敗也。”何進怒曰：“孟德亦懷私意耶？”操退曰：“亂天下者，必進也。”進乃暗差使命齎密詔，星夜往各鎮去。,"It is said that Cao Cao said to He Jin that day: ""The misfortune of eunuchs has existed in ancient and modern times; but the ruler of the world should not be favored by false power, so that it is here. If you want to punish crimes, you should eliminate the original evil, but it is enough to pay one prisoner, so why should you call them out? Are you a soldier? If you want to kill him, things must be revealed. I expect he will be defeated."" He Jin said angrily, ""Meng De also has selfish intentions?"" Secretly dispatched the mission to secretly edict, Xingye went to the towns.","Warlord Dong Zhuo usurps the throne, opposes Ding Yuan and aided by his sidekick Li Su bribes the hero Lü Bu to join his army","What Cao Cao said was this: “The eunuch evil is of very old standing, but the real cause of the present trouble is in the improper influence allowed them by the emperors and the misplaced favoritism they have enjoyed. But a gaoler would be ample force to employ against this kind of evil, and getting rid of the main culprits is quite enough. Why increase confusion by summoning troops from the regions? Any desire to slay all of them will speedily become known, and the plan will fail.” “Then, Cao Cao, you have some scheme of your own to further,” said He Jin with a sneer. Cao Cao left the meeting, proclaiming, “The one throwing the world into chaos is He Jin!” Then He Jin sent swift, secret letters far and wide to several bases."

Hearing the shouting loudly, hundreds of soldiers came to the bridge to stop the chariots, and asked sharply, ""Who is coming?"" Yang Qi, the attendant, patted the horse on the bridge and said, ""Who dares to stop the holy chariot?"" Two generals came out and said : ""We are ordered by General Guo to guard this bridge to prevent spies. Sage Yun Yun must see the emperor in person before we can be trusted."" Yang Qi raised the bead curtain. The emperor said: ""I bow here, why don't you retreat?"" The second general reported to Guo Si, ""The driver is gone."" Si said, ""I was just about to coax Zhang Ji, and the hijacked driver would re-enter Yiwu. How did you let him go without authorization?"" The two generals were then killed, and troops rushed over. The chariot was arriving in Huayin County, and there was a loud voice behind him, shouting: ""The chariot and stop moving!"" The bandit army was approaching, only to hear the sound of drums, and a general turned from behind the mountain, and a big banner in front of him, with the words ""Big Han Yang Feng"" written on it, led more than a thousand troops to kill. It turned out that Yang Fengzi was defeated by Li Jue, so he led the army to settle down at the foot of Zhongnan Mountain; When the following battles begin. Si general Cui Yong came out and scolded Yang Feng for being a traitor. Feng was furious and looked back at the formation and said, ""Where is Gongming?"" One of the generals, holding a big axe, flew to Hua Liu and took Cui Yong directly. When the two horses crossed, they only joined together, beheading Cui Yong under the horse. Yang Feng took advantage of the situation to cover up the attack, and the Si army was defeated and retreated more than twenty li. Feng Nai took the army and came to see the emperor. The emperor comforted him and said: ""Your Excellency saves I Gong, his contribution is not small!"" Feng Dun gave his first thanks. The emperor said: ""Who is the person who is suitable for killing thieves and generals?"" Feng Nai cited this general and bowed under the car and said, ""This person is from Yangjun, Hedong: his surname is Xu, his name is Huang, and his courtesy name is Gongming."" The emperor comforted him. Yang Feng escorted him to Huayin to stay there. The general simmered in the section, and offered clothes and meals. That night, the Son of Heaven stayed in Yang Feng's camp.","Li Jue will organize the carriages to convey the imperial couple to Hongnong with a couple of hundred guards, while Guo Si releases the imprisoned court officials. But all is not as it seems. Guo Si goes back on his word. An order from him to hold up the imperial entourage at the Baling bridge is foiled when his own guards let the emperor cross. Furious at this disobedience, Guo Si decides personally to stop the emperor and sets off after him with an armed force. Just as the convoy reaches Huayin County, Guo Si rides up, demanding that the convoy be brought to a halt. The emperor is beside himself with fear, saying, ‘Alas! Out of the wolf’s lair and now into the tiger’s mouth!’ When it seems to the desperate emperor that there is no hope left, and as Guo Si’s men draw closer, a thunderous roll of drums is heard. Onto the scene rides another armed force with a banner unfurled, proclaiming that this troop are men of ‘Yang Feng the Mighty Han’. Having survived fleeing from Li Jue, he has taken up refuge in the hills of the Zhongnan mountains and has come to help protect his emperor. Riding to the attack, Yang Feng’s men drive Guo Si and his men off. The emperor, upon being introduced to his champion, says, ‘It’s the greatest of services that you have performed for us. We owe you our lives.’ Yang Feng kowtows and thanks the emperor for his gracious words.","The progress had been without incident as far as Xinfeng. Near Baling Bridge the west wind of autumn came on to blow with great violence, but soon above the howling of the gale was heard the trampling of a large body of force. They stopped at a bridge and barred the way. “Who comes?” cried a voice. “The Imperial Chariot is passing, and who dares stop it?” said Yang Qi, riding forward. Two leaders of the barring party advanced to Yang Qi, saying, “General Guo Si has ordered us to guard the bridge and stop all spies. You say the Emperor is here; we must see him, and then we will let you pass.” So the pearl curtain was raised and the Emperor said, “I, the Emperor, am here. Why do you not retire to let me pass, Gentlemen?” They all shouted, “Long Life! Long Life!” and fell away to allow the cortege through. But when they reported what they had done, Guo Si was very angry, saying, “I meant to outwit Zhang Ji, seize the Emperor, and hold him in Meiwo. Why have you let him get away?” He put the two officers to death, set out to pursue the cavalcade, and overtook it just at the county of Huaying. The noise of a great shouting arose behind the travelers, and a loud voice commanded, “Stop the train!” The Emperor burst into tears. “Out of the wolf's den into the tiger's mouth!” said he. No one knew what to do; they were all too frightened. But when the rebel army was just upon them, they heard the beating of drums and from behind some hills came into the open a cohort of one thousand soldiers preceded by a great flag bearing the name “Han General Yang Feng”. Having defeated by Li Jue, Yang Feng fled to the foothills of the Xian; and he came up to offer his services as soon as he heard the Emperor's journey. Seeing it was necessary to fight now, he drew up his line of battle. Guo Si's general, Cui Yong, rode out and began a volley of abuse. Yang Feng turned and said, “Where is Xu Huang?” In response out came a valiant warrior gripping a heavy battle-ax. He galloped up on his fleet bay, making directly for Cui Yong, whom he felled at the first blow. At this the whole force dashed forward and routed Guo Si. The defeated army went back some seven miles, while Yang Feng rode forward to see the Emperor who graciously said, “It is a great service you have rendered; you have saved my life.” Yang Feng bowed and thanked him, and the Emperor asked to see the actual slayer of the rebel leader. So Xu Huang was led to the chariot where he bowed and was presented as “Xu Huang of Hedong.” The Emperor recognized the achievement of the warrior. Then the cavalcade went forward, Yang Feng acting as escort as far as the city of Huaying, the halting place for the night. The Commander of the place, Duan Wei, supplied them with clothing and food. And the Emperor passed the night in Yang Feng's camp."
當夜行數里，月明中敲開客店門投宿。餵飽了馬，曹操先睡。陳宮尋思：“我將謂曹操是好人，棄官跟他；原來是個狠心之徒！今日留之，必為後患。”便欲拔劍來殺曹操。正是：,"When walking for several miles at night, Yueming Zhong knocked on the door of the inn to stay. After feeding the horses, Cao Cao went to sleep first. Chen Gong pondered: ""I will say that Cao Cao is a good man, and abandoned his office to follow him; he turned out to be a ruthless man! If I keep him today, it will be a trouble for the future."" He wanted to draw his sword to kill Cao Cao. Exactly:","‘What happened back at the house was a terrible accident, but this – this was cold-blooded murder. Why, why?’ he asks. ‘Don’t you understand?’","They rode on some distance by moonlight and presently knocked up an inn for shelter. Having first fed their horses, Cao Cao was soon asleep, but Chen Gong lay thinking. “I took him for a true man and left all to follow him, but he is as cruel as a wolf. If I spare him, he will do more harm later,” thought Chen Gong. And Chen Gong rose intending to kill his companion. In his heart lie cruelty and venom, he is no true man;"

次日，呂布在府中打聽，絕不聞音耗。逕入堂中，尋問諸侍妾。侍妾對曰：“夜來太師與新人共寢，至今未起。”布大怒，潛入卓臥房後窺探。時貂蟬起於窗下梳頭；忽見窗外池中照一人影，極長大，頭戴束髮冠；偷眼視之，正是呂布。貂蟬故蹙雙眉，做憂愁不樂之態，復以香羅頻拭眼淚。呂布窺視良久，乃出；少頃，又入。卓已坐於中堂，見布來，問曰：“外面無事乎？”布曰：“無事。”侍立卓側。卓方食，布偷目竊望，見繡簾內一女子往來觀覷，微露半面，以目送情。布知是貂蟬，神魂飄蕩。卓見布如此光景，心中疑忌，曰：“奉先無事且退。”布怏怏而出。,"The next day, Lu Bu inquired in the mansion, but he never heard the sound. He entered the hall and asked the concubines. The concubine replied, ""The Taishi and the newcomer are sleeping together at night, and I haven't woken up yet."" Bu was furious and sneaked into Zhuo's bedroom to spy on him. At that time, Diaochan got up under the window and combed her hair; suddenly, she saw a figure in the pool outside the window, very grown up, wearing a crown of hair; stealthily looking at it, it was Lu Bu. Diaochan frowned and looked sad and unhappy, and wiped away her tears with Xiangluo. Lu Bu peeped for a long time, then went out; after a while, he entered again. Zhuo was already sitting in the middle hall, and when he saw Bu coming, he asked, ""Is there nothing outside?"" Bu said, ""Nothing."" He stood beside Zhuo. Zhuo Fangshi, Bu stealing his eyes, saw a woman in the embroidered curtain walking and watching, showing half of her face, showing her affection with her eyes. Bu Zhi is Diao Chan, and his spirit is floating. Seeing Bu in such a situation, Zhuo was suspicious, and said, ""Fengxian has nothing to do and retreat."" Bu rushed out.","However, when Lü Bu calls the next day at Dong Zhuo’s palace, he is told by the maids that the master came home last night with a new woman, and they have not yet risen from their bed. Lü Bu’s heart is clogged with anger, and he creeps round to peer in through the bedroom window. Diao Chan is combing her hair when she spots him. Immediately she feigns an expression of terrible distress and sadness, dabbing at her eyes over and over as if she is crying. Lü Bu watches for quite some time and then strides into the main hall of the palace to ‘offer his morning greeting’ to Dong Zhuo. ‘Is everything all right?’ Dong Zhuo asks, concerned by his adopted son’s expression. ‘Of course! Everything is fine,’ Lü Bu curtly replies. But he then notices the figure of a young woman moving around behind the curtain and glimpses Diao Chan peering out and looking passionately at him. Lü Bu cannot hide his emotion, and Dong Zhuo guesses why he is distracted and dismisses him abruptly.","Next day he went into the Palace to find out the truth, but could hear nothing. Then he made his way into the private quarters and questioned the maids. Presently one told him that the Prime Minister had brought home a new bedfellow the night before and was not up yet. Lu Bu was very angry. Next he crept round behind his master's sleeping apartment. By this time Diao Chan had risen and was dressing her hair at the window. Looking out she saw a long shadow fall across the little lake. She recognized the headdress, and peeping around she saw it was indeed no other than Lu Bu. Thereupon she contracted her eyebrows, simulating the deepest grief, and with her dainty handkerchief she wiped her eyes again and again. Lu Bu stood watching her a long time. Soon after he went in to give morning greeting. Dong Zhuo was sitting in the reception room. Seeing his henchman, Dong Zhuo asked if there was anything new. “Nothing,” was the reply. Lu Bu waited while Dong Zhuo took his morning meal. As he stood beside his master, he glanced over at the curtain and saw a woman there behind the screen showing a half face from time to time and throwing amorous glances at him. He felt it was his beloved and his thoughts flew to her. Presently Dong Zhuo noticed his expression and began to feel suspicious. “If there is nothing, you may go,” said Dong Zhuo. Lu Bu sulkily withdrew."
當下呂布射中畫戟小枝，呵呵大笑，擲弓於地，執紀靈、玄德之手曰：“此天令你兩家罷兵也！”喝敎軍士：“斟酒來！各飲一大觥。”玄德暗稱慚愧。紀靈默然半晌，告布曰：“將軍之言，不敢不聽；奈紀靈回去，主人如何肯信？”布曰：“吾自作書覆之便了。”酒又數巡，紀靈求書先回。布謂玄德曰：“非我則公危矣。”玄德拜謝，與關、張回。次日，三處軍馬都散。,"Immediately, Lü Bu shot the halberd twig, laughed loudly, threw his bow on the ground, held the hands of Jiling and Xuande, and said, ""This day, your two families will be dismissed!"" The sergeant said, ""Pour wine! A big gauntlet."" Xuande secretly said he was ashamed. Ji Ling was silent for a while, and then announced to Bu, ""I dare not refuse to listen to the words of the general; when Nai Jiling goes back, how can the master believe it?"" Bu said, ""I will write the book by myself."" Ask for a book first. Bu said to Xuande, ""If it's not me, the public will be in danger."" Xuande thanked him and returned to Guan and Zhang. The next day, the three troops were scattered.","Imagine their astonishment – and, for Xuande at least, delight – when Lü Bu does indeed hit the small blade. ‘ So Heaven decrees that you stop,’ he says. While Xuande is mightily relieved, Ji Ling knows his master will never understand.","Lu Bu laughed loud at the success of his shot. Dropping his bow he seized his guests by the hands, saying, “The command of Heaven indeed! And now you cease from fighting!” He ordered the soldier attendants to pour out great goblets of wine and each drank. Liu Bei in his inmost heart felt rather lucky; his fellow guest sat silent, nodding his head. Presently he said, “I cannot disobey your command, General, but let me depart. What will my master say and will he believe me?” “I will write a letter and confirm it,” said Lu Bu. After a few more rounds of the wine, Ji Ling asked that he might have the letter and after that departed. When the brothers took their leave, Lu Bu again reminded Liu Bei, saying, “Do not forget I have delivered you today!” Liu Bei thanked him and departed. Next day the leaders broke camps, and the soldiers were gone."
袁術已死，姪袁胤將靈柩及妻子奔廬江來，被徐璆盡殺之。璆奪得玉璽，赴許都獻於曹操。操大喜，封徐璆為高陵太守。此時玉璽歸操。,"Yuan Shu was already dead, so Yuan Yin brought the coffin and his wife to the Lujiang River and was killed by Xu Qi. Qiu captured the jade seal and went to Xudu to offer it to Cao Cao. Cao was overjoyed and made Xu Qiu the prefect of Gaoling. At this time, Yuxi returned to work.","As his coffin is borne back for formal burial, the entourage is attacked and the imperial seal seized. It is triumphantly brought to Cao Cao in Xuchang.","Yuan Shu being dead, his nephew, Yuan Yin, taking his coffin and his wife and children, sought shelter in Lujiang. There the Magistrate, Xu Liu, slew all the survivors. Among the possessions Xu Liu found the Imperial Hereditary Seal, which he at once took to the capital and presented to Cao Cao, for which service he was made Governor of Gaoling. Since then the Imperial Hereditary Seal belonged to Cao Cao."

玄德令趙雲望前哨探船隻，忽報後面塵土沖天而起。玄德登高望之，但見軍馬蓋地而來，歎曰：“連日奔走，人困馬乏，追兵又到，死無地矣！”看看喊聲漸近。正慌急間，忽見江岸邊一字兒拋着拖篷船二十餘隻。趙雲曰：“天幸有船在此！何不速下，棹過對岸，再作區處！”玄德與孫夫人便奔上船。子龍引五百軍亦都上船。只見船艙中一人綸巾道服，大笑而出，曰：“主公且喜！諸葛亮在此等候多時。”船中扮作客人的，皆是荊州水車。玄德大喜。不移時，四將趕到。孔明笑指岸上人言曰：“吾已算定多時矣。汝等回去傳示周郎，敎休再使美人局手段。”岸上亂箭射來，船已開的遠了。蔣欽四將，只好呆看。,"Xuande ordered Zhao Yun to look at the outpost to investigate the ship, and suddenly reported that the dust was rising into the sky behind. Xuande climbed high and looked up to him, but when he saw the soldiers and horses coming over the ground, he sighed and said, ""We have been running for days, people are tired and horses are exhausted, and the pursuers have arrived again, and there is no place to die!"" Seeing the shouting approaching. In a hurry, I suddenly saw more than 20 tugboats tossed along the river bank. Zhao Yun said, ""Fortunately, there is a boat here! Why don't you get off quickly, cross the other side, and go to the area!"" Xuande and Mrs. Sun rushed to the boat. Zilong led five hundred troops on board. I saw a person in the cabin wearing a cloth towel and laughing out, saying: ""My lord, you are happy! Zhuge Liang has been waiting here for a long time."" All the guests in the boat were Jingzhou waterwheels. Xuande was overjoyed. When it does not move, the four will arrive. Kong Ming smiled and pointed to the people on the shore and said, ""I've made a decision for a long time. You go back and tell Zhou Lang, and let me tell you what to do with the beauty."" Random arrows came from the shore, and the boat was far away. Four generals of Jiang Qin had no choice but to watch.","Choosing noble Xuande and undoing plots? The sound of the pursuing troops comes clear on the air, and Xuande’s heart grows heavier and heavier. Suddenly, coming down the river are twenty ships, and Zilong shouts with relief that this is the gift of grace they needed to escape. Only when they and the five hundred have all swiftly embarked do they spot someone dressed like an ordinary Daoist with a headband in one of the boats. It is Kong Ming! When the four generals arrive breathless at the riverbank, Kong Ming laughs and shouts, ‘I planned all this ages ago, so you go back and tell Zhou Yu – no more seduction plots!’ And so saying, despite arrows being fired at the retreating ships, they sail safely away. Or do they?","Liu Bei bade Zhao Yun go along the bank to seek some boats. Then the soldiers told him there was a huge cloud of dust on the road. Ascending one of the hills, he looked back whence they had come and saw the whole earth as it were covered with an advancing host. He sighed and said, “We have fled before them now for days, worn out our soldiers and jaded our horses, and all to die in a strange place.” He watched the enemy coming nearer and nearer. Then as things began to look most desperate, he saw a line of some twenty boats all in the act of setting their sails. “By good luck here are some ships,” said Zhao Yun. “Let us get on board, row to the further bank, and see what can be done.” Liu Bei and his bride hastened down the bank and went into a ship. The soldiers were embarked. Then they saw in the hold of the ship some one in Taoist dress, who came up with a smile, saying, “My lord, again you see Zhuge Liang. He has waited a long time.” All the soldiers on board were from Jingzhou, and Liu Bei rejoiced at the sudden happy turn of affairs. Before long the four pursuer leaders reached the bank. Zhuge Liang pointed to them and laughed, saying, “I foresaw this a long time ago. You may return and tell Zhou Yu not to use the 'Fair Damsel Trick' again.” Those on the bank sent a flight of arrows at the ships, but they were already too far away. The four generals on the bank looked very foolish."

Cao Xu said: ""Yan Liang has executed two generals in a row, and he is too brave, so I invite Yun Chang to discuss it."" Guan Gong said: ""Rong Mou is watching."" He suddenly reported that Yan Liang was fighting, and led Guan Gong up to the Tushan Mountain to watch. Cao sat with Guan Gong, and the generals stood in a circle. Cao Cao pointed to the formation of Yan Liangpai at the foot of the mountain, with clear banners, spears and swords, strictness and authority, and he said to Guan Gong: ""Hebei people and horses are so majestic!"" Guan Gong said: ""From my perspective, they are like the ears of a chicken and a dog!"" Cao Cao He also pointed out: ""Under the cover, the person who embroidered robes and gold armor, and holds a sword and horses immediately is Yan Liang."" Guan Gong raised his eyes and said to Cao: ""I look at Yan Liang, like putting a mark to sell the ear!"" Cao said: "" Don't take it lightly."" Guan Gong stood up and said, ""Although a certain person is not talented, I would like to go to the army to take his head and present it to the prime minister."" Zhang Liao said: ""There are no jokes in the army, and the leader of the cloud should not be ignored."" Guan Gong rushed up. The horse, carrying the dragon knife, ran down the mountain, the phoenix eyes were wide open, the silkworm eyebrows were upright, and the army of Hebei was like a wave. Guan Gong went to Yan Liang. Yan Liang was under his command when he saw Guan Gong rushing towards him. When he was about to ask, Guan Gong was fast and ran in front of him. Yan Liang was caught off guard and was stabbed under the horse with a knife from Yun Chang's hand. Suddenly, he dismounted from his horse, cut off Yan Liang's head, tied him under the horse's collar, flew on his horse, and took out his sword, as if entering a land of no one. The Hebei soldiers were startled, and they went into chaos without fighting. Cao's army took advantage of the momentum to attack, and the number of dead was innumerable; Guan Gong rode on the mountain, and all the generals congratulated him. Public offering of the head before the exercise. Cao said: ""The general is really a god!"" Guan Gong said: ""What a good man! My brother Zhang Yide took the head of a general among a million troops, like looking into a bag and picking an ear."" Cao was shocked and looked back and said: ""The future will be like When encountering Zhang Yide, do not underestimate the enemy."" The order was written on the bottom of the robe to remember.","Riding the mighty horse Red Hare and wielding his sword, the Green Dragon, he arrives. Cao Cao takes him to the top of the hill and points out Yan Liang to him. Without further ado, Guan Yu leaps on to Red Hare and gallops down the hill. As he rushes forward, the enemy army parts like a river, and Guan Yu, unchallenged, rides straight at Yan Liang, who is completely unprepared for such a dramatic attack. With one thrust of Guan Yu’s sword Yan Laing is killed. While the astonished and shocked army watch helplessly, Guan Yu leaps from his horse, cuts off Yan Liang’s head, leaps back on Red Hare, brandishing his great sword, and, with Yan Liang’s head tied to his reins, gallops back to Cao Cao. Realizing that the enemy is paralysed with terror and astonishment, Cao Cao’s army attack and rout the northern army, killing huge numbers and seizing vast quantities of loot. When Guan Yu presents the head to Cao Cao, the latter says, ‘This is beyond anything a mere mortal could do!’ Whereupon Guan Yu says, ‘This is nothing. My brother Zhang Fei could kill a commander of an army of ten times a hundred thousand men.’ Alarmed by this, Cao Cao makes his commanders take note of this warning – even making them write it down on their collars.","“Yes,” said Guan Yu and left them. Armed with his green-dragon saber, riding on the swift steed Red-Hare, and having but a slender following, Guan Yu was not long in arriving at Baima. He saw Cao Cao, who told him what had happened. Yan Liang was too valiant for any to face. “Let me look at him,” said Guan Yu. Then wine was served for his refreshment, and while they were drinking, it was reported that Yan Liang once again offered a challenge. So Cao Cao and his guest and staff went to the summit of a hill whence the enemy could be seen. Cao Cao and Guan Yu sat on the hill top, and the commanders stood about them. Cao Cao pointed out Yan Liang's troops arrayed on the plains below. The ensigns and banners waving fresh and bright amid the forest of spears and swords made a grand and imposing spectacle. “See how formidable these soldiers of the North of Yellow River are,” said Cao Cao. “I regard them as so many clay fowls and mud dogs,” said Guan Yu. Cao Cao pointed out Yan Liang, saying, “There under that grand umbrella, in that embroidered robe and that silver breastplate and riding on horseback and gripping that huge sword is Yan Liang.” “His head looks as though it was stuck on a pole for sale,” said Guan Yu, just glancing over the army at his feet. “He is very terrible. You must not despise him,” said Cao Cao. Guan Yu rose, saying, “I am a poor thing but I will go over and bring you his head if you like.” “Joking is not allowed in this army,” interposed Zhang Liao. “Please be careful what you say, General.” Guan Yu quickly mounted, turned down his mighty weapon, and galloped down the hill; his phoenix eyes rounded, and his silkworm eyebrows fiercely bristling. He dashed straight into the enemy's array, and the northern soldiers opened like falling waves and dissolving storms. He made directly for the commander. Now Yan Liang sitting there in state saw a horseman rushing toward him, and just as he began to ask who the rider of the red horse was, lo! the horseman was there. Taken utterly by surprise, the leader could make no defense. Guan Yu's arm rose and the mighty weapon fell. And with it fell Yan Liang. Leaping from the saddle, Guan Yu cut off his victim's head and hung it to his horse's neck. Then he mounted and rode out, just as if there was no army there. The northern troops, panic stricken, made no fight. Cao Cao's army attacked with full force and slew great numbers of them. They captured many horses and weapons and much military gear. Guan Yu rode quickly back up the hill and laid the proof of his prowess at the feet of the Prime Minister. “You are more than human, General!” cried Cao Cao. “What have I done to talk about?” said Guan Yu. “My brother, Zhang Fei, did the same thing in an army of a hundred legions, and did it as easily as picking something from his own pocket.” Cao Cao marveled at the statement and turning to those about him said, “If you meet this Zhang Fei, be careful.” And he bade them make a note on the overlap of their robes so that they should remember."

行了三日，至成皐地方，天色向晚。操以鞭指林深處謂宮曰：“此間有一人姓呂，名伯奢，是吾父結義弟兄；就往問家中消息，覓一宿，如何？”宮曰：“最好。”二人至莊前下馬，入見伯奢。奢曰：“我聞朝廷遍行文書，捉汝甚急，汝父已避陳留去了。汝如何得至此？”操告以前事，曰：“若非陳縣令，已粉骨碎身矣。”伯奢拜陳宮曰：“小姪若非使君，曹氏滅門矣。使君寬懷安坐，今晚便可下榻草舍。”說罷，卽起身入內。良久乃出，謂陳宮曰：“老夫家無好酒，容往西村沽一樽來相待。”言訖，匆匆上驢而去。,"After walking for three days, it was getting dark when we arrived at Chenggao. Cao pointed at the depths of the forest with a whip and said to the palace, ""There is a man here whose surname is Lu and whose name is Boshe. He is my father's brother-in-law. I went to ask the family news and find a place to stay. How about it?"" The palace said, ""It's the best."" The people dismounted before arriving at the village, and entered to see Bo She. She said: ""I heard that the imperial court has written documents all over the place, and it is very urgent to arrest you. Your father has avoided Chen Liu. How did you get this?"" Bo She bowed to Chen Gong and said, ""If Xiao Mi is not the envoy, the Cao clan will be destroyed. I entrust your lord to sit comfortably, and you can stay in the grass house tonight."" After saying that, You got up and entered. After a long time, he said to Chen Gong, ""The old man's house has no good wine, so let's go to Xicun and buy a bottle of wine."" After saying this, he hurried on the donkey and left.","‘One of my father’s sworn companions lives near here,’ Cao Cao says. ‘His name is Lü Boshe. He’s like an uncle to me. He’ll give us somewhere safe to stay.’ And, sure enough, when the two men turn up, Lü Boshe makes them welcome. He tells Cao Cao that the court has sent soldiers to intimidate his father into revealing where Cao Cao is hiding. Making his guests comfortable, Lü Boshe realizes that he has run out of wine. So he tells them he is going to ride over to the next village to buy some, but that they should just rest. Not long after he has left, the two men overhear voices in the back yard of the house. What alarms them most is the sound of knives being sharpened. ‘You know, he isn’t a blood relative,’ whispers Cao Cao anxiously. ‘ So perhaps this is all a trick and he’s gone off to betray us.’","Three days later at eventide they reached Chenggao. Cao Cao pointed with his whip to a hamlet deep in the woods and said, “There lives my uncle, Lu Boshe, a sworn-brother of my father. Suppose we go and ask news of my family and seek shelter for the night?” “Excellent!” said his companion Chen Gong, and they rode over, dismounted at the farm gate and entered. Lu Boshe greeted them and said to Cao Cao, “I hear the government has sent stringent orders on all sides to arrest you. Your father has gone into hiding to Chenliu. How has this all come about?” Cao Cao told him and said, “Had it not been for this man here with me, I should have been already hacked to pieces.” Lu Boshe bowed low to Chen Gong, saying, “You are the salvation of the Cao family. But be at ease and rest, I will find you a bed in my humble cottage.” Lu Boshe then rose and went into the inner chamber where he stayed a long time. When he came out, he said, “There is no good wine in the house. I am going over to the village to get some for you.” And he hastily mounted his donkey and rode away."
衆皆踴躍稱善。操引衆官復設祭於郭嘉靈前：亡年三十八歲。從征十有一年，多立奇勳。後人有詩讚曰：,"The crowd cheered enthusiastically. Cao cited officials to re-establish sacrifices in front of Guo Jialing: the year of his death was thirty-eight years old. From the tenth year of the expedition, Doli Qixun. A later poem praised:","He, alarmed at the thought of becoming Cao Cao’s enemy, has the two brothers murdered and their heads sent to Cao Cao.","The officers simply jumped with surprise to see how perfectly events had been foreseen.

且說周瑜收軍點將，各各敍功，申報吳侯。所得降卒，盡皆發付渡江。大犒三軍，遂進兵攻取南郡。前隊臨江下寨，前後分五營。周瑜居中。瑜正與衆商議征進之策，忽報：“劉玄德使孫乾來與都督作賀。”瑜命請入。乾施禮畢，言：“主公特命乾拜謝都督大德，有薄禮上獻。”瑜問曰：“玄德在何處？”乾答曰：“見移兵屯油江口。”瑜驚曰：“孔明亦在油江否？”乾曰：“孔明與主公同在油江。”瑜曰：“足下先回，某親來相謝也。”瑜收了禮物，發付孫乾先回。肅曰：“却纔都督為何失驚？”瑜曰：“劉備屯兵油江，必有取南郡之意。我等費了許多軍馬，用了許多錢糧，目下南郡反手可得；彼等心懷不仁，要就見成，須放着周瑜不死！”肅曰：“當用何策退之？”瑜曰：“吾自去和他說話。好便好；不好時，不等他取南郡，先結果了劉備！”肅曰：“某願同往。”於是瑜與魯肅引三千輕騎，逕投油江口來。,"Let's say that Zhou Yu took his army and appointed generals, each of them recounted his merits, and declared the Marquis of Wu. All the proceeds are sent to cross the river. The three armies of the big reward, then marched to attack Nanjun. The former team went down to the village by the river and was divided into five battalions before and after. Zhou Yu is in the middle. Yu was discussing the strategy of enlistment with everyone, and suddenly reported: ""Liu Xuande sent Sun Qianlai to congratulate the governor."" Yu ordered to invite in. After the ceremony was finished, he said, ""My lord has specially ordered to pay tribute to the Governor, Dade, and I have a small gift to offer."" Yu asked, ""Where is Xuande?"" Gan replied, ""I see the troops moving to the mouth of the Youjiang River."" Yu said in surprise: ""Is Kongming also in the Youjiang River?"" Gan said, ""Kongming and the lord are in the Youjiang River."" Yu said, ""Let's go back first, and a relative will come to thank you."" Yu received the gift and sent it to Sun Qian to return first. Su said: ""Why is the Ducai so startled?"" Yu said: ""Liu Bei's troops stationed in the Youjiang River must have the intention of taking Nanjun. We have spent a lot of troops and horses, spent a lot of money and food, and now Nanjun can get it back; they are not benevolent. If you want to see it, you must leave Zhou Yu alive!"" Su said, ""What strategy should we use to retreat?"" Yu said, ""I will go and talk to him. It's good if it's good; Liu Bei is the first to end!"" Su said, ""I would like to go together."" So Yu and Lu Su led three thousand light cavalry and went straight to the mouth of the Youjiang River.","Meanwhile Zhou Yu, triumphant after his victory, is thinking through what to do next. News is brought to him that Xuande has moved his force to the mouth of the River You and that Kong Ming is with him. This causes Zhou Yu to be deeply alarmed. He is convinced this means that Xuande is planning to seize the city of Nanjun – the very city Zhou Yu plans to capture. Determined to find out if this is Xuande’s plan, he sets off with Lu Su to visit Xuande. It is a very tense meeting in an atmosphere of distrust on both sides. Xuande has been warned by Kong Ming that Nanjun is the bone of contention. He has briefed Xuande on how to answer Zhou Yu’s questions. After Zhou Yu has said he understands Xuande is planning to take Nanjun and Xuande has countered by saying he understands that is Zhou Yu’s plan, Zhou says, ‘If we fail, you’re very welcome to try.’","In the meantime, Zhou Yu mustered his officers and called over his soldiers, noted the special services of each, and sent full reports to his master. The soldiers who had surrendered were all transported across the river. All this done they spread the feast of victory. The next step was to attack and capture Nanjun. The van of the army camped on the river bank. There were five camps and the Commander-in-Chief's tent was in the center. He summoned his officers to a council. At this moment Sun Qian arrived with congratulations from Liu Bei. Zhou Yu received him and, having saluted in proper form, Sun Qian said, “My lord sent me on this special mission to felicitate the General on his great virtue and offer some unworthy gifts.” “Where is Liu Bei?” asked Zhou Yu. “He is now encamped at Youkou, the mouth of River You.” “Is Zhuge Liang there?” asked Zhou Yu, taken aback. “Both are there,” said Sun Qian. “Then return quickly, and I will come in person to thank them.” The presents handed over, Sun Qian was sent back forthwith to his own camp. Then Lu Su asked Zhou Yu why he had started when he heard where Liu Bei was camped. “Because,” replied Zhou Yu, “camping at the mouth of River You means that he has the intention of taking Nanjun. Having spent much military energy and spared no expenditure, we thought the territory should fall to us easily. Those others are opposed to us, and they wish to get the advantage of what we have already accomplished. However, they must remember that I am not dead yet.” “How can you prevent them?” asked Lu Su. “I will go myself and speak with them. If all goes well, then, let it be so; in case it does not, then I shall immediately settle up with Liu Bei without waiting for Nanjun to be taken.” “I should like to accompany you,” said Lu Su. The General and his friend started, taking with them a guard of three thousand light horse."

玄德聞歌，暗思：“此人莫非水鏡所言伏龍、鳳雛乎？”遂下馬相見，邀入縣衙，問其姓名。答曰：“某乃潁上人也：姓單，名福。久聞使君納士招賢，欲來投託，未敢輒造；故行砍於市，以動尊聽耳。”玄德大喜，待為上賓。單福曰：“適使君所乘之馬，再乞一觀。”玄德命去鞍牽於堂下。單福曰：“此非的盧馬乎？雖是千里馬，却只妨主，不可乘也。”玄德曰：“已應之矣。”遂具言躍檀溪之事。福曰：“此乃救主，非妨主也；終必妨一主。某有一計可禳。”玄德曰：“願聞禳法。”福曰：“公意中有讎怨之人，可將此馬賜之；待妨過了此人，然後乘之，自然無事。”玄德聞言變色曰：“公初至此，不敎吾以正道，便敎作利己妨人之事，備不敢聞敎。”福笑謝曰：“向聞使君仁德，未敢便信，故以此言相試耳。”玄德亦改容起謝曰：“備安能有仁德及人，惟先生敎之。”福曰：“吾自潁上來此，聞新野之人歌曰：‘新野牧，劉皇叔，自到此，民豐足。’可見使君之仁德及人也。”玄德乃拜單福為軍師，調練本部人馬。,"When Xuande heard the song, he thought to himself, ""Is it possible that this person is the one that Shui Jing said Fulong and Fengchu?"" The answer said: ""A certain person is also a master of Ying: his surname is Dan, and his name is Fu. I have heard for a long time that the emperor is recruiting talents, and he wants to come to entrust him. Rejoice, be your guest. Shan Fu said: ""The horse you are riding on is suitable, and I will beg for another look."" Xuande ordered to go to the saddle and lead it under the hall. Shan Fu said: ""Is this not a Luma? Although it is a thousand miles of horses, it can only hinder the master and cannot be used."" Xuande said: ""It has already been answered."" Fu said: ""This is the savior, not to hinder the lord; in the end, it must hinder one lord. There is a plan to discuss."" Xuande said: ""I would like to hear the law."" Fu said: ""There are people who have grudges in the public will. You can give this horse to him; wait until the hindrance passes this person, then ride it, and nothing will happen.” Xuande changed his color when he heard the words and said, “When the public first came here, he didn’t teach me the right way, so he taught me to do things that benefit myself and hurt others. Bei does not dare to hear it."" Fu smiled and said, ""Xiangwen envoys benevolence, but I didn't dare to believe it, so I tried to hear it."" Xuande also changed his face and thanked him, saying, ""Bei'an can have benevolence. When you reach someone, only the Master will teach them."" Fu said: ""I came here from Ying, and I heard the song of the people in Xinye: 'Xinye Mu, Liu Huangshu, since I came here, the people are abundant.' It can be seen that the benevolence of the emperor is also related to people. ""Xuande worshipped Shan Fu as his military advisor to train the troops of the headquarters.","But the one who’s looking doesn’t know him – do you see? He doesn’t even know me! Convinced that this man must be one of the two masters he has just heard about, he stops him and asks his name. ‘I am Shan Fu,’ replies the strange man, ‘and I’ve come seeking you but didn’t know how to attract your attention – hence the song!’ Soon the two are boon companions, and Shan Fu is deeply impressed by the virtuous way Xuande rules and his real compassion for the ordinary people. When Cao Cao decides to attack Xuande and sends his cousin Cao Ren to oversee taking Xinye and capturing Xuande, it is Shan Fu whose advice Xuande follows.","Liu Bei listened. “Surely this is one of the people Water-Mirror spoke of,” thought he. He dismounted, spoke to the singer, and invited him into his residence. Then when they were seated, he asked the stranger's name. “I am from Yingchuan and my name is San Fu. I have known you by repute for a long time, and they said you appreciated humans of ability. I wanted to come to you but every way of getting an introduction seemed closed. So I bethought me of attracting your notice by singing that song in the market place.” Liu Bei thought he had found a treasure and treated the newcomer with the greatest kindness. Then San Fu spoke of the horse that he had seen Liu Bei riding and asked to look at it. So the animal was brought round. “Is not this a Dilu horse?” said San Fu. “But though it is a good steed, it risks his master. You must not ride it.” “It has already fulfilled the omens,” said Liu Bei, and he related the story of the leap over the Tan Torrent. “But that was saving his master, not risking him; it will surely harm some one in the end. But I can tell you how to avert the omen.” “I should be glad to hear it,” said Liu Bei. “If you have an enemy against whom you bear a grudge, give him this horse and wait till it has fulfilled the evil omens on this person, then you can ride it in safety.” Liu Bei changed color. “What, Sir! You are but a new acquaintance, and you would advise me to take an evil course and to harm another for my own advantage? No, Sir! I cannot listen.” His guest smiled, saying, “People said you were virtuous. I could not ask you directly, so I put it that way to test you.” Liu Bei's expression changed. He rose and returned the compliment, saying, “But how can I be virtuous while I lack your teaching?” “When I came here, I heard the people saying: “Since Liu Bei came here, O blessed day! We've had good luck: long may he stay! “So you see, the effects of your virtue extend to the ordinary people.” Thereupon San Fu was made Commanding Adviser of the army."

Cao said, ""Does Uncle Guo recognize this person?"" Cheng was furious and said, ""The fugitive slave is here! You should execute him!"" He said, ""Why did the prime minister listen to the fugitive slave's side?"" Cao said, ""I have already captured Wang Zifu and I have all tried to prove it. Are you still denying it?"" , and found the edict and the deed of righteousness. Cao looked at it, smiled and said, ""The rat is safe!"" Then he ordered: ""I will imprison all of Dong Cheng's good and lowly family, and let him get away with him."" Emperor, renew the new king. Exactly:","With Ji Ping dead, Cao Cao brings in the slave Qin Qingtong and asks Dong Cheng, ‘Do you know this man?’ to which Dong Cheng replies that of course he does and he is glad to have this runaway back, and he should be executed for his crimes. When Cao Cao tells him of the accusations, Dong Cheng tries valiantly to defend himself by disparaging the words of a slave. But it is pointless. The house is searched and the imperial decree is found inside the belt and the roll of silk as well. Cao Cao orders Dong Cheng and his entire household to be seized. Armed with the evidence, Cao Cao now proposes to depose the emperor and put another on the throne. What now will befall the emperor? Let’s find out.","Seeing his victim had passed beyond the realm of punishment, Cao Cao had Quin Quington led in. “Do you know this man, Uncle?” “Yes,” cried Dong Cheng. “So the runaway servant is here; he ought to be put to death.” “He just told me of your treachery; he is my witness,” said Cao Cao. “Who would dare kill him?” “How can you, the First Minister of State, heed the unsupported tale of an absconding servant?” “But I have Wang Zifu and the others in prison,” said Cao Cao. “And how can you rebut their evidence?” He then called in the remainder of his followers and ordered them to search Dong Cheng's bedroom. They did so and found the decree that had been given him in the girdle and the pledge signed by the conspirators. “You mean rat!” cried Cao Cao. “You dared do this?” He gave orders to arrest the whole household without exception. Then he returned to his palace with the incriminating documents and called all his advisers together to discuss the dethronement of the Emperor and the setting up of a successor.

且說曹操引軍往小沛來。正行間，狂風驟至，忽聽一聲響亮，將一面牙旗吹折。操便令軍兵且住，聚衆謀士問吉凶。荀彧曰：“風從何方來？吹折甚顏色旗？”操曰：“風自東南方來，吹折角上牙旗，旗乃靑紅二色。”彧曰：“不主別事，今夜劉備必來劫寨。”操點頭。忽毛玠入見曰：“方纔東南風起，吹折靑紅牙旗一面。主公以為主何吉凶？”操曰：“公意若何？”毛玠曰：“愚意以為今夜必主有人來劫寨。”後人有詩歎曰：,"Let us say that Cao Cao led his troops to Xiaopei. In the middle of the line, a strong wind suddenly came, and suddenly a loud noise was heard, blowing a tooth flag off. Cao then ordered the soldiers to stay, and gathered a group of counselors to ask for luck. Xun Yu said, ""Where does the wind come from? It blows the flag of a very different color?"" Cao said, ""The wind comes from the southeast and blows the flag with the upper teeth on the folded horn. The flag is red and red."" Liu Bei will definitely come to Jiezhai tonight."" Cao nodded. Suddenly Mao Jie came to see him and said, ""Just now, the wind from the southeast was blowing and the red-toothed flag was blown. What do you think is good or bad for the lord?"" Cao said, ""What is the public opinion?"" Come to rob the village."" A later generation sighed in a poem:","His proposal is to attack Cao Cao’s troops at night as soon as they arrive. They will be tired after such long journey, eager just to set up camp and rest. As a result they will not be as vigilant as usual. En route, Cao Cao himself is deeply troubled – by an omen. A standard pole breaks in the wind. The fall of his banner clearly signals to Cao Cao that something is wrong. He asks Xun Wenruo, who is renowned for being able to read the auguries.","Now while Cao Cao was in the midst of his march toward Xiaopei, a tornado sprang up and the howling gale tore down one of the banners and broke the staff. Cao Cao called together his advisers and leaders to ask them what this portended. Xun Yu said, “From what direction was the wind at the time, and what was the color of the flag?” “The wind was from the southeast, and the flag was blue and red.” “There is only one interpretation: A raid on the camp will occur tonight.” Cao Cao nodded. At that moment Mao Jie entered and reported a similar incident. Cao Cao asked him the portent. “My thinking tells me it means a night raid,” replied he. Alas for the weakness of this descendant of kings! He placed his faith on a night raid."

却說孔明聞魯肅到，與玄德出城迎接，接到公廨，相見畢。肅曰：“主公聞令姪棄世，特具薄禮，遣某前來致祭。周都督再三致意劉皇叔、諸葛先生。”玄德、孔明起身稱謝，收了禮物，置酒相待。肅曰：“前者皇叔有言：‘公子不在，卽還荊州。’今公子已去世，必然見還。不識幾時可以交割？”玄德曰：“公且飲酒，有一個商議。”肅強飲數盃，又開言相問。玄德未及回答，孔明變色曰：“子敬好不通理！直須待人開口！自我高皇帝斬蛇起義，開基立業，傳至於今；不幸奸雄並起，各據一方；少不得天道好還，復歸正統。我主人乃中山靖王之後，孝景皇帝玄孫，今皇上之叔，豈不可分茅裂土？況劉景升乃我主之兄也，弟承兄業，有何不順？汝主乃錢塘小吏之子，素無功德於朝廷；今倚勢力，占據六郡八十一州，尚自貪心不足，而欲併吞漢土。劉氏天下，我主姓劉倒無分，汝主姓孫反要強爭？且赤壁之戰，我主多負勤勞，衆將並皆用命，豈獨是汝東吳之力？若非我借東南風，周郎安能展半籌之功？江南一破，休說二喬置於銅雀宮，雖公等家小，亦不能保。適來我主人不卽答應者，以子敬乃高明之士，不待細說。何公不察之甚也！”,"However, Kong Ming heard that Lu Su had arrived, and went out of the city with Xuande to meet him. Su said: ""The lord heard that the concubine had abandoned the world, and he sent a certain person to pay tribute. The governor of Zhou has repeatedly paid tribute to Liu Huangshu and Mr. Zhuge."" Xuande and Kongming got up to thank them, accepted gifts, and treated each other with wine. Su said: ""The former uncle said: 'Young Master is not here, you will return to Jingzhou.' Now that Young Master has passed away, he must see him back. I don't know when the delivery can be made?"" Xuande said: ""Young Master, please drink, there is a discussion."" Su said. After drinking a few cups, he asked again. Before Xuande could answer, Kong Ming changed his color and said: ""Zijing is so unreasonable! You have to speak to others! Self-high emperor cut snakes and revolted, established a foundation and established a career, and it has been passed down to this day; Return to orthodoxy. My master is the descendant of King Jing of Zhongshan, the great-grandson of Emperor Xiaojing, and the uncle of the current emperor. Can’t we divide the soil? Besides, Liu Jingsheng is the elder brother of my master, and the younger brother inherits his brother’s business. What’s wrong with him? The son, who has no merit in the imperial court, now relies on power to occupy six counties and eighty-one prefectures. He is still greedy and wants to annex the land of Han. In the Liu family, my surname is Liu, but your surname is Sun. In the battle of Chibi, my lord has to work hard, and all the generals use their lives. Is it only the strength of Ru, Dongwu? If it were not for me to borrow the southeast wind, Zhou Langan would be able to do half of the work? Putting it in the Tongque Palace, even if the family is small, it can't be guaranteed. If my master does not agree, Yi Zijing is a brilliant person, and I don't need to elaborate. What's wrong with the prince!""","When Lu Su arrives, Xuande and Kong Ming welcome him, even going outside the city walls to meet him. They accept his expressions of sympathy and those of Sun Quan on the death of Liu Qi. However, when he raises the issue of whether as a result of this death and the agreement he had with Kong Ming they will now surrender Jingzhou, the atmosphere changes. ‘This is far from appropriate,’ says Kong Ming. ‘Xuande is from the imperial family, whereas Sun Quan is just the son of an insignificant officer from the provinces. Sun Quan is hardly qualified to ask for imperial territory. Furthermore, Liu Qi was the adopted nephew of Xuande, and what could be more honourable than that an uncle take care of his nephew’s lands!’ Completely flummoxed by all this, Lu Su is eventually persuaded to sign an agreement. This states that, once Xuande has conquered other territories where he can set up his base, he will hand over Jingzhou! Needless to say, Zhou Yu is far from impressed when Lu Su returns and shows him the document! ‘","Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang went out of the city to welcome the envoy of the South Land and led him to the guest-house. After the usual greetings, Lu Su said, “Hearing of the death of your nephew, my lord Sun Quan has prepared some gifts and sent me to take his place at the funeral sacrifices. General Zhou Yu also sends regards to the Imperial Uncle and to you, Master Zhuge Liang.” Both rose at once and thanked him for the courtesy. Then the gifts were handed over and a banquet prepared, and while it was in progress, the guest brought up the real object of his visit. “You said, Sir, that Jingzhou should be returned to us after the death of Liu Qi. Now that that event has happened, rendition becomes due, and I should be glad to know when the transfer can take place.” “We will discuss that later; in the meantime let us go on with our wine,” said Liu Bei. So the feasting continued. Some time later Lu Su returned to the subject, but this time his host remained silent. However, Zhuge Liang, changing color, said, “Lu Su, you are unreasonable. You could not wait till some other has to explain this matter to you. From the very foundation of the empire by our illustrious ancestor, the great heritage has descended in due course till today when, unhappily, evil doers have risen among the powerful and they have seized upon such portions as they could. But with God's favor and help, unity is nearly restored. My lord is a scion of the Imperial House, a great great grandson of Emperor Myers. Now, as the Emperor's Uncle, should he not have a share of the empire? Moreover, Liu Biao was my lord's elder brother, and there is certainly nothing extraordinary in one brother's succession to another's estate. “What is your master? The son of a petty official on the banks of the River Qiantang, absolutely without merit so far as the state is concerned. Just because he is powerful, he holds actual possession of six territories and eighty-one counties, which has whetted his insatiable appetite till he now desires to swallow the whole empire. The land is the estate of the Liu family and my lord, who is of that name, has no share thereof, while your master, whose name is Sun, would dispute with, and even fight him. Beside, at the battle at the Red Cliffs my lord did good service and acquired great merit while his commanders risked their lives. Was it solely the strength of your southern soldiers that won that fight? Had I not brought that southeast wind that meant so much for Zhou Yu, could he have done anything? Had the South Land been conquered, it is needless to say that the two paramount beauties would now be gracing the Bronze Bird Palace, and as for yourself and other officers, insignificant though your families be, could you have been sure to survive? Just now my lord did not reply because he was willing to believe rather that a scholar of your abilities would understand without a detailed explanation, and I trust now that you will.”"

Cao said, ""Xuande and I are brothers."" Then he invited him to meet him in the city. The next day, Xuande stayed at the gate and Zhang was outside the city. He brought Sun Qian and Mi Zhu to see the drill. Treat your guests with courtesy. Xuande filed a complaint against Lu Bu. Cao said: ""Bu is an unrighteous generation, and I and my wise brother will work together to kill him."" Xuande thanked him. Set up a banquet to treat each other, and send them out until the evening. Xun Yu came to see him and said, ""Liu Bei is a hero. If you don't make a picture earlier today, you will be in trouble later."" Cao didn't answer. Yu came out and Guo Jia entered. Cao said: ""Xun Yu persuaded me to kill Xuande, what should I do?"" Jia said, ""No: Your lord will raise righteous soldiers to eliminate violence for the people, and only rely on faith to recruit heroes, and I am still afraid that they will not come; In the name of a hero, he casts himself in poverty. If he kills him, he will harm the virtuous. The wise men in the world, when they hear it and doubt themselves, will not move forward. Who is the lord to rule the world? The opportunity of safety and danger must not be overlooked."" Cao Daxi said: ""Your words are in line with my heart."" Cheng Yu advised: ""Liu Bei will not be under the people, it is better to plan for it earlier."" Cao said: ""When Fang is using a hero, you must not kill one person and lose the heart of the world. Guo Fengxiao and I have the same view."" He did not listen to Yu Yan, and sent Xuande with three thousand soldiers and ten thousand grains of grain, and sent him to Yuzhou to take up his post. Xuande went to Yuzhou and asked Cao Cao to date him.","Even when Xuande offers to return them, Lü Bu is so furious he attacks Xuande ensconced in the city of Xiaopei. Forced to retreat, Xuande, with his two brothers, leaves at dead of night, heading to Cao Cao to offer to join him. Cao Cao is advised by many to use this opportunity to kill Xuande. But as one of his advisers puts it, ‘You’ve promised to support the legitimate dynasty of the Han and free the people from fear. Because of this you’re held in great respect, which is why men come to serve you. If you kill a hero like Xuande because he is vulnerable at this moment, then you’ll be notorious for such an unworthy act, and men of virtue will no longer seek you out. How, then, will you be able to restore the empire?’ This response pleases Cao Cao, and so instead of killing Xuande he offers him additional troops as a sign of friendship.","Liu Bei approached Xuchang and encamped outside the city, whence he sent Sun Qian to see Cao Cao and relate the events that brought him there. Cao Cao was very friendly and said, “Liu Bei is as my brother.” Then Cao Cao invited Liu Bei to enter the city. Leaving his brothers at the camp, Liu Bei, with Sun Qian and Mi Zhu, went to Cao Cao, who received him with the greatest respect. The story of Lu Bu's perfidy was again related. “He has no sense of right,” said Cao Cao. “You and I, my brother, will attack him together.” Liu Bei was very grateful. A banquet was then prepared, and it was late evening before the visitor left for his own camp. Xun Yu then had an interview with his master and said, “If you are not on your guard, Liu Bei will be your undoing. You ought to destroy him. He is too much of a hero.” Cao Cao made no reply and his adviser retired. Presently Guo Jia came, and Cao Cao said, “I have been advised to kill Liu Bei; what of such a scheme?” “A bad scheme,” said Guo Jia. “You are the popular champion, pledged to relieve the people from oppression, and only by truth and rectitude can you secure the support of the noble-minded. Your only fear is lest they stay away. Now Liu Bei is clearly a hero. He has come to you for help and protection, and to put him to death would be to alienate all good people and put fear into the hearts of all the able advisers. Hampered by these difficulties, where will you find those whose help you need? To remove the dangers represented by one man and thereby injure yourself in the eyes of all humankind is a sure means of destruction. These conditions need careful consideration.” “What you say exactly fits in with what I think,” said Cao Cao, greatly pleased with these remarks. His next step was to memorialize the Emperor to give Liu Bei the imperial protectorship of Yuzhou. Again Cheng Yu said, “Liu Bei is certain to rise to the top; he will never remain in a subordinate position. You would better remove him.” Cao Cao answered, “Now is just the time to make use of good people. I will not forfeit the regard of the world for the sake of removing one individual. Guo Jia and I both see this in the same light.” Wherefore Cao Cao rejected all persuasion to work against Liu Bei but sent him three thousand soldiers and ten thousand carts of grain, and set him on his way to Yuzhou."
操在兗州，招賢納士。有叔姪二人來投操：乃潁川潁陰人：姓荀，名彧，字文若，荀昆之子也；舊事袁紹，今棄紹投操；操與語大悅，曰：“此吾之子房也！”遂以為行軍司馬。其姪荀攸，字公達，海內名士，曾拜黃門侍郎，後棄官歸鄕，今與其叔同投曹操，操以為行軍敎授。荀彧曰：“某聞兗州有一賢士，今此人不知何在。”操問是誰，彧曰：“乃東郡東阿人：姓程，名昱，字仲德。”操曰：“吾亦聞名久矣。”遂遣人於鄕中尋問。訪得他在山中讀書，操拜請之。程昱來見，曹操大喜。昱謂荀彧曰：“某孤陋寡聞，不足當公之薦。公之鄕人姓郭，名嘉，字奉孝，乃當今賢士，何不羅而致之？”彧猛省曰：“吾幾忘却！”遂啟操徵聘郭嘉到兗州，共論天下之事。郭嘉薦光武嫡派子孫，淮南成德人：姓劉，名曄，字子陽。操卽聘曄至。曄又薦二人：一個是山陽昌邑人：姓滿，名寵，字伯寧；一個是武城人：姓呂，名虔，字子恪。曹操亦素知這兩個名譽，就聘為軍中從事。滿寵、呂虔共薦一人：乃陳留平邱人：姓毛，名玠，字孝先。曹操亦聘為從事。,"Fuck in Yanzhou, recruiting talents. There were two uncles who came to join the gymnasium: they were from Yingyin, Yingchuan: their surname was Xun, their first name was Yu, their characters were Wenruo, and they were also the sons of Xun Kun; Yuan Shao, who was in the past, abandoned Shao to join the gym; The son's house!"" So he thought that Sima was marching. His concubine Xun You, courtesy name Gongda, was a famous person at home and abroad. She once worshipped Huangmen Shilang, and later abandoned her office to return to Cao Cao. Xun Yu said, ""I heard that there is a wise man in Yanzhou, but now I don't know where he is."" Cao asked who it was, and Yu said, ""I am from Dong'e, Dongjun: my surname is Cheng, my name is Yu, and my style is Zhongde."" Cao said, ""I also It's been famous for a long time."" So he sent people to ask questions. I found that he was studying in the mountains, and I asked him to worship him. Cheng Yu came to see him, and Cao Cao was overjoyed. Yu asked Xun Yu and said, ""Someone is so ignorant and ignorant that he is not enough to be recommended by the public. The public's surname is Guo, his name is Jia, his name is Fengxiao, and he is a wise man of today. ""Then Qi Cao recruited Guo Jia to Yanzhou to discuss the affairs of the world. Guo Jia recommended the descendants of Guangwu's direct line, Huainan Chengde: surname Liu, name Ye, word Ziyang. Cao Xi hired Ye Zhi. Ye recommended two more people: one was from Changyi, Shanyang: surnamed Man, given name Chong, styled Boning; the other was from Wucheng: surnamed Lu, given name Qian, styled Zike. Cao Cao was also well aware of these two honors and hired him to serve in the army. Man Chong and Lu Qian recommended one person: Chen Liuping and Qiu: surname Mao, name Jie, style Xiaoxian. Cao Cao was also hired to work.","But as they bury the coffin in the ground a terrible thunderstorm erupts. So torrential is the downpour that it floods the site, causing the coffin to float out of the ground on a surge of water. The coffin is smashed into pieces. Despite this, they try again. However, during the night the coffin is once again washed out of the ground, as thunder peals and lightning flashes all around. A third time they try to bury him, only for the same thing to happen yet again. By now nothing remains of him, not a fragment of bone or flesh, for the lightning has destroyed what the floods have not washed away. In this way Heaven makes plain its anger, its real fury, against Dong Zhuo. Rebellion arises everywhere. A rebel army of one hundred thousand march on the capital, but they are defeated and driven off. The Yellow Headband rebels rise once again with hundreds of thousands of men in armed gangs. When the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si wonder who can tackle this uprising they are recommended to call upon Cao Cao.","At his headquarters in Yanzhou, Cao Cao welcomed wise counselors and bold warriors, and many gathered around him. Two clever persons, uncle and nephew, came at the same time, both from Yanzhou, named Xun Yu and Xun You. The uncle had once been in the service of Yuan Shao. Cao Cao rejoiced when he had won the elder Xun to his side, saying, “Xun Yu is my Zhang Liang.” He made Xun Yu a Marching General. The nephew Xun You was famed for his ability and had been in the court service when it was in Luoyang, but he had abandoned that career and retired to his village. Cao Cao made him a Military Instructor. Xun Yu said to Cao Cao, “There is a certain wise person of Yanzhou somewhere, but I do not know in whose service he is.” “Who is he?” “Cheng Yu; he belongs to the eastern region of Yanzhou.” “Yes; I have heard of him,” said Cao Cao. So a messenger was sent to his native place to inquire. Cheng Yu was away in the hills engaged in study, but he came at Cao Cao's invitation. “I shall prove unworthy of your recommendation,” said Cheng Yu to his friend Xun Yu, “for I am rough and ignorant. But have you forgotten a fellow villager of yours, Guo Jia? He is really able. Why not spread the net to catch him?” “I had nearly forgotten,” said Xun Yu suddenly. So he told Cao Cao of this man, who was at once invited. Guo Jia, discussing the world at large with Cao Cao, recommended Liu Ye from Henan, who was a descendant of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter Han. When Liu Ye had arrived, he was the means of inviting two more: Man Chong from Shanyang, and Lu Qian from Wucheng, who were already known to Cao Cao by reputation. These two brought to their new master's notice the name of Mao Jie from Chenliu, who also came and was given office."

却說文聘引軍追趙雲至長坂橋，只見張飛倒豎虎鬚，圓睜環眼，手綽蛇矛，立馬橋上；又見橋東樹林之後，塵頭大起，疑有伏兵，便勒住馬，不敢近前。俄而曹仁、李典、夏侯惇、夏侯淵、樂進、張遼、張郃、許褚等都至。見飛怒目橫矛，立馬於橋上，又恐是諸葛孔明之計，都不敢近前。紮住陣脚，一字兒擺在橋西，使人飛報曹操。操聞知，急上馬，從陣後來。張飛圓睜環眼，隱隱見後軍靑羅傘蓋、旄鉞旌旗來到，料得是曹操心疑，親自來看。飛乃厲聲大喝曰：“我乃燕人張翼德也！誰敢與我決一死戰？”聲如巨雷。曹軍聞之，盡皆股栗。曹操急令去其傘蓋，回顧左右曰：“我向曾聞雲長言：翼德於百萬軍中，取上將之首，如探囊取物。今日相逢，不可輕敵。”言未已，張飛睜目又喝曰：“燕人張翼德在此！誰敢來決死戰？”曹操見張飛如此氣概，頗有退心。飛望見曹操後軍陣脚移動，乃挺矛又喝曰：“戰又不戰，退又不退，却是何故！”喊聲未絕，曹操身邊夏侯傑驚得肝膽碎裂，倒撞於馬下。操便回馬而走。於是諸軍衆將一齊望西逃奔。正是：黃口孺子，怎聞霹靂之聲；病體樵夫，難聽虎豹之吼。一時棄鎗落盔者，不計其數。人如潮湧，馬似山崩，自相踐踏。後人有詩讚曰：,"But they said that Wen Ping led the army to chase Zhao Yun to Changban Bridge, and saw Zhang Fei standing upside down with tiger beards, eyes wide open, snake spears in his hands, and immediately on the bridge; Reined the horse and did not dare to approach. Elsewhere Cao Ren, Li Dian, Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Le Jin, Zhang Liao, Zhang He, Xu Chu and others all arrived. Seeing Fei's angry eyes and spears, he immediately jumped on the bridge, fearing that it was Zhuge Kongming's plan, so he didn't dare to approach. Stand firm, and place the word on the west of the bridge, so that people will report to Cao Cao. Cao heard the knowledge, hurriedly mounted the horse, and followed the formation. Zhang Feiyuan's eyes widened, and he vaguely saw the arrival of the rear army, the umbrella canopy, and the flag and flag. Cao Cao was suspicious and came to see it in person. Fei Nai shouted loudly, ""I'm Zhang Yide from Yan! Who dares to fight me to the death?"" The sound was like thunder. When Cao Jun heard about it, all of them felt chestnuts. Cao Cao hurriedly ordered the canopy to be removed, looked back and said: ""I have long said to Zeng Wenyun: Yide is among a million troops, and taking the head of an admiral is like looking into a bag to find something. When we meet today, don't underestimate the enemy."" Before he finished speaking, Zhang Fei opened his eyes. He shouted again, ""Zhang Yide from Yan is here! Who dares to fight to the death?"" Fei saw that Cao Cao's rear army was moving, he raised his spear and shouted, ""We don't fight, we don't retreat, but why!"" Get off the horse. Cao then go back to the horse. So all the army generals looked west and fled together. It is precisely: Huangkou Ruzi, how can you hear the sound of thunderbolts; sick woodcutter, unpleasant to hear the roar of tigers and leopards. There are countless people who abandoned their guns and helmets at one time. People are like tides, horses are like landslides, trampling on each other. A later poem praised:","Back at the bridge, Wen Ping arrives to find Zhang Fei in command and behind him dust rising in huge clouds. Wen Ping is thus convinced Zhang Fei has command of a formidable force of men. So ferocious is Zhang Fei’s glare and shouts of defiance that no one dares attack. Everyone is convinced that Kong Ming has set yet another cunning trap. Even when Cao Cao himself rides up, not even he dare attack. Zhang Fei constantly shouts challenges and threats at the enemy, calling them cowards and daring them to attack him. Fear sweeps through the enemy forces, and even Cao Cao feels the force of it. So much so that he turns tail and flees, his horse panicking, and rides pell-mell until he is slowed and brought to a stop by his commanders. When Zhang Fei sees this full-scale retreat and confusion, he takes the opportunity to destroy the bridge and tells his men to cut loose the branches tied to their horses’ tails.","There he was seated on his battle steed, his hand grasping his terrible octane-serpent spear, guarding the bridge. They also saw great clouds of dust rising above the trees and concluded they would fall into an ambush if they ventured across the bridge. So they stopped the pursuit, not daring to advance further. In a little time Cao Ren, Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Li Dian, Yue Jin, Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, Zhang He, and other generals of Cao Cao came up, but none dared advance, frightened not only by Zhang Fei's fierce look, but lest they should become victims of a ruse of Zhuge Liang. As they came up they formed a line on the west side, halting till they could inform their lord of the position. As soon as the messengers arrived and Cao Cao heard about it, he mounted and rode to the bridge to see for himself. Zhang Fei's fierce eye scanning the hinder position of the army opposite him saw the silken umbrella, the axes and banners coming along, and concluded that Cao Cao came to see for himself how matters stood. So in a mighty voice he shouted: “I am Zhang Fei of Yan ((an ancient state)); who dares fight with me?” At the sound of this thunderous voice, a terrible quaking fear seized upon Cao Cao, and he bade them take the umbrella away. Turning to his followers, he said, “Guan Yu had said that his brother Zhang Fei was the sort of man to go through an army of a hundred legions and take the head of its commander-in-chief, and do it easily. Now here is this terror in front of us, and we must be careful.” As he finished speaking, again that terrible voice was heard, “I am Zhang Fei of Yan; who dares fight with me?” Cao Cao, seeing his enemy so fierce and resolute, was too frightened to think of anything but retreat; and Zhang Fei, seeing a movement going on in the rear, once again shook his spear and roared, “What mean you? You will not fight nor do you run away!” This roar had scarcely begun when one of Cao Cao's staff, Xiahou Jie, reeled and fell from his horse terror-stricken, paralyzed with fear. The panic touched Cao Cao and spread to his whole surroundings, and he and his staff galloped for their lives. They were as frightened as a suckling babe at a clap of thunder or a weak woodcutter at the roar of a tiger. Many threw away their spears, dropped their casques and fled, a wave of panic-stricken humanity, a tumbling mass of terrified horses. None thought of ought but flight, and those who ran trampled the bodies of fallen comrades under foot. Zhang Fei was wrathful; and who dared To accept his challenge?"

Later, he really defeated Jin.","Zhang Fei is furious that the commanders have been released, but Guan Yu insists that their brother has decreed this and so it must be. But back in Xuzhou the three brothers-in-arms discuss how vulnerable they are in that city, and so it is decided that Guan Yu will travel with Xuande’s wives to the security of Xiapi, while Xuande and Zhang Fei fortify Xiaopei.","The two released leaders, Liu Dai and Wang Zhong, hastened home to Cao Cao and explained to him that Liu Bei was not disaffected."

Yuan Zheng was holding a candle and reading the book. When he saw Bu, he said, ""What happened to my son?"" Bu said, ""My dignified husband, is it safe to be your son?"" Yuan said, ""Why did you change your mind when you were first?"" Bu Xiang In front of him, he cut off Ding Yuan's head with a knife, shouting to the left and right: ""Ding Yuan is not benevolent, I have killed him. Those who are willing to follow me are here, those who do not follow me will go!"" The sergeant scattered most of him. The next day, Buting Dingyuan's head went to see Li Su. Su then cited the cloth to see Zhuo. Zhuo is overjoyed, treat each other with wine. Zhuo Xian bowed down and said, ""Zhuo's generals are like a dry seedling getting sweet rain."" Buna Zhuo sat down and bowed to him and said, ""If you don't give up, please pay me your righteous father."" Zhuo gave cloth with a golden robe. , drink and disperse. Zhuo Zizhi became more powerful, and he led the army of the former generals. He named his younger brother Dong Min as the left general Huhou, and Lv Bu as the cavalry commander Duting Hou.","That night Lü Bu creeps into Ding Yuan’s tent. Ding Yuan is quietly reading but on hearing Lü Bu he looks up and says, ‘What brings you here, my son?’ To this Lü Bu says, ‘I’m a man of great importance, so why on earth would I want to be known as your son?’ Bewildered Ding Yuan asks, ‘What has happened to make you say this?’ Lü Bu gives no answer. He simply raises his sword and with one blow cuts off Ding Yuan’s head. At this most of Ding Yuan’s soldiers fade away into the night. The next day Lü Bu brings the head to Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo is so delighted he bows to the young man. ‘Your arrival is like dew to parched grass.’ Lü Bu bowing down before him asks to be accepted into his army. Dong Zhuo is delighted with such a new recruit and presents him with many gifts of great value. Emboldened by Lü Bu’s presence, Dong Zhuo and Li Ru decide to press ahead with the forced abdication of the emperor and with raising his brother to the imperial throne.","So Li Su took his leave. That very night, at the second watch, Lu Bu entered, sword in hand, into his master's tent. He found Ding Yuan reading by the light of a solitary candle. Seeing who came in, Ding Yuan said, “My son, what is afoot?” “I am a bold hero,” said Lu Bu. “Don't you think I am willing to be a son of yours.” “Why this change, Lu Bu?” As a reply Lu Bu made one cut, and Ding Yuan's head fell to the earth. Then Lu Bu called the attendants and said, “He was an unjust man and I have slain him. Let those who back me stay; the others may depart.” Most ran away. Next day, with the head of the murdered man as his gift, Lu Bu betook himself to Li Su, who led him to Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo received him with a warm welcome and had wine set before him. “Your coming is welcome as the gentle dew to the parched grass,” said Dong Zhuo. Lu Bu made Dong Zhuo seat himself and then made an obeisance, saying, “Pray let me bow to you as my adopted father.” Dong Zhuo gave his newly won ally gold and armor and silken robes and spread the feast of welcome. They then separated. Thence Dong Zhuo's power and influence increased rapidly. He gave the lordship of Hu ((an ancient state)) and the rank Commander of the Left Army to his brother Dong Min. He appointed Lu Bu Lord of Luoyang, Commander of Capital District, and Commander of the Right Army. Dong Zhuo made himself Commander of the Central Army."

操回軍攻冀州。許攸獻計曰：“何不決漳河之水以渰之？”操然其計，先差軍於城外掘壕塹，周圍四十里。審配在城上見操軍在城外掘塹，却掘得甚淺。配暗笑曰：“此欲決漳河之水以灌城耳。壕深可灌，如此之淺，有何用哉？”遂不為備。當夜曹操添十倍軍士并力發掘，比及天明，廣深二丈，引漳水灌之城中，水深數尺。更兼糧絕，軍士皆餓死。辛毗在城外，用鎗挑袁尚印綬衣服，招安城內之人。審配大怒，將辛毗家屬老小八十餘口，就於城上斬之，將頭擲下。辛毗號哭不已。審配之姪審榮，素與辛毗相厚；見辛毗家屬被害，心中懷忿，乃密寫獻門之書，拴於箭上，射下城來。軍士拾獻辛毗，毗將書獻操。操先下令：如入冀州，休得殺害袁氏一門老小；軍民降者免死。次日天明，審榮大開西門，放曹兵入。辛毗躍馬先入，軍將隨後，殺入冀州。審配在東南城樓上，見操軍已入城中，引數騎下城死戰，正迎徐晃交馬。徐晃生擒審配，綁出城來，路逢辛毗。毗咬牙切齒，以鞭鞭配首曰：“賊殺才！今日死矣！”配大罵辛毗：“賊徒！引曹操破我冀州，我恨不殺汝也！”徐晃解配見操。操曰：“汝知獻門接我者乎？”配曰：“不知。”操曰：“此汝姪審榮所獻也。”配怒曰：“小兒不行，乃至於此！”操曰：“昨孤至城下，何城中弩箭之多耶？”配曰：“恨少！恨少！”操曰：“卿忠於袁氏，不容不如此；今肯降吾否？”配曰：“不降！不降！”辛毗哭拜於地曰：“家屬八十餘口，盡遭此賊殺害。願丞相戮之，以雪此恨！”配曰：“吾生為袁氏臣，死為袁氏鬼，不似汝輩讒諂阿諛之賊！可速斬我！”操敎牽出。臨受刑，叱行刑者曰：“吾主在北，不可使我面南而死！”乃向北跪，引頸就刃。後人有詩歎曰：,"Cao returned to attack Jizhou. Xu You offered a plan and said, ""Why don't you decide to use the water of the Zhang River?"" Following his plan, he first sent his troops to dig trenches outside the city, forty li around. When Shen Pei was on the city, he saw that the Cao army was digging a moat outside the city, but the digging was very shallow. Pei laughed secretly and said, ""I want to use the water of the Zhang River to irrigate the city ears. The trenches can be irrigated, but what's the use of being so shallow?"" That night, Cao Cao added ten times the number of soldiers to excavate with his strength. Compared with the dawn of the day, it was two zhang wide and deep. Moreover, the food was scarce, and the soldiers all starved to death. Xin Pi was outside the city, using a spear to pick out Yuan Shang's robes, and recruit people from the city. Shen Pei was furious, and slaughtered more than eighty people of Xin Pi's family members on the city and threw their heads off. Xinpi cried out incessantly. Shen Rong, the concubine of the match, was always close to Xin Pi; seeing Xin Pi's family being murdered, he felt angry, so he secretly wrote a book to offer the door, tied it to an arrow, and shot it down the city. The sergeant collected Xin Pi, and Pi gave the book to the exercise. Cao Xian ordered: If you enter Jizhou, Hugh will kill all the old and young of the Yuan family; the soldiers and civilians who surrender will not die. At dawn the next day, Shen Rong opened the west gate and let Cao soldiers in. Xin Pi jumped into the horse first, and the generals followed, and entered Jizhou. Shen Pei was on the southeast city tower, and seeing that Cao's army had entered the city, Qu Shu rode down the city to fight to the death, and was welcoming Xu Huang to give his horse. Xu Huang captured Shen Pei alive and tied him out of the city, where he met Xin Pi on the road. Pi gritted his teeth and used the whip to match his head, saying: ""The thief kills Cai! He died today!"" Pei scolded Xin Pi: ""The thief! Lead Cao Cao to break my Jizhou, I hate to kill you!"" Xu Huang explained Pei to see Cao. Cao said, ""Do you know who will present the door to pick me up?"" Pei said, ""I don't know."" Cao said, ""This is what your wife tried to offer."" Pei said angrily, ""You can't do it, you can't do it!"" Cao said ""Yesterday I went down to the city alone, why are there so many arrows in the city?"" Pei said, ""I hate you! I hate you!"" Cao said, ""You are loyal to the Yuan clan, and you won't tolerate it. Are you willing to surrender to me now?"" Pei said: "" Don't surrender! Don't surrender!"" Xin Pi cried and bowed to the ground and said, ""More than 80 people in my family were killed by this bandit. May the prime minister kill him and hate him with snow!"" Pei said, ""I was born as a minister of Yuan Shi, and I died. You are a ghost of the Yuan clan, not like the slanderous thieves of your generation! You can kill me quickly!"" Cao Chi took him out. When he was about to be tortured, he shouted at the executioner, ""My lord is in the north, so don't let me face the south and die!"" He knelt down to the north and pulled his neck to the sword. A later poem sighed and said:","Cities fall and armies are routed until once again Cao Cao stands before the closed gates of Jizhou. Determined not to be stopped again, he turns to a simple strategy. He diverts the River Zhang and floods the city. However, he gives strict instructions that no members of the Yuan clan are to be hurt. The city falls. Cao Cao’s eighteen-year-old son Cao Pi is part of the invading army.","Then Cao Cao came to attack Jizhou City, and to help out this Xun You suggested drowning the city by turning the course of the River Zhang. Cao Cao adopted the suggestion and at once sent a small number of men to dig a channel to lead the water to the city. All told, it was seventeen miles. Shen Pei saw the diggers from the city wall and noticed that they made only a shallow channel. He chuckled, saying to himself, “What is the use of such a channel to drown out the city from a deep river?” So he made no preparations to keep out the water. But as soon as night came on, Cao Cao increased his army of diggers tenfold and by daylight the channel was deepened to twenty spans and the water was flowing in a great stream into the city where it already stood some spans deep. So this misfortune was added to the lack of food. Xin Pi now displayed the captured seal and garments of Yuan Shang hung out on spears, to the great shame of their late owner, and called upon the people of the city to surrender. This angered Shen Pei, who avenged the insult by putting to death on the city wall the whole of the Xin family who were within the city. There were eighty of them, and their severed heads were cast down from the walls. Xin Pi wept exceedingly. Shen Pei's nephew Shen Rong, one of the gate wardens, was a dear friend of Xin Pi, and the murder of Xin Pi's family greatly distressed him. He wrote a secret letter offering to betray the city and tied it to an arrow, which he shot out among the besiegers. The soldiers found it, gave it to Xin Pi who took it to his chief. Cao Cao issued an order: “The family of the Yuans should be spared when the city should be taken and that no one who surrendered should be put to death.” The next day the soldiers entered by the west gate, opened for them by Shen Rong. Xin Pi was the first to prance in on horseback and the army followed. When Shen Pei, who was on the southeast of the city, saw the enemy within the gates, he placed himself at the head of some horsemen and dashed toward them. He was met and captured by Xu Huang who bound him and led him outside the city. On the road they met Xin Pi, who ground his teeth with rage at the murderer of his relatives and then struck the prisoner over the head with his whip, crying, “Murder! Blood drinker! You will meet your death.” Shen Pei retorted, “Traitor! Seller of the city! I am very sorry I was not to have slain you before.” When the captive was taken into Cao Cao's presence, Cao Cao said, “Do you know who opened the gate to let me in?” “No; I know not.” “It was your nephew Shen Rong who gave up the gate,” said Cao Cao. “He was always unprincipled; and it has come to this!” said Shen Pei. “The other day when I approached the city, why did you shoot so hard at me?” “I am sorry we shot too little.” “As a faithful adherent of the Yuans, you could do no otherwise. Now will you come over to me?” “Never; I will never surrender.” Xin Pi threw himself on the ground with lamentations, saying, “Eighty of my people murdered by this ruffian; I pray you slay him, O Prime Minister!” “Alive, I have served the Yuans;” said Shen Pei, “dead, I will be their ghost. I am no flattering time-server as you are. Kill me!” Cao Cao gave the order; they led him away to put him to death. On the execution ground he said to the executioners, “My lord is in the north, I pray you not to make me face the south.” So Shen Pei knelt facing the north and extended his neck for the fatal stroke. Who of all the official throng In the North was true like Shen Pei? Sad his fate!"

却說曹操統領衆將入冀州城，將入城門，許攸縱馬近前，以鞭指城門呼操曰：“阿瞞，汝不得我，安得入此門？”操大笑。衆將聞言，俱懷不平。操至紹府門下，問曰：“誰曾入此門來？”守將對曰：“世子在內。”操喚出責之。劉氏出拜曰：“非世子不能保全妾家，願獻甄氏為世子執箕帚。”操敎喚出甄氏拜於前。操視之曰：“眞吾兒婦也！”遂令曹丕納之。,"But he said that Cao Cao was leading the generals into Jizhou City and was about to enter the city gate. Xu You rode his horse forward, pointed his whip at the city gate, and shouted to Cao, ""Ah, you won't let me enter this gate safely?"" Cao laughed. When the generals heard the words, they all felt uneasy. Cao went to the gate of Shao's house and asked, ""Who has ever entered this gate?"" The guard would say, ""The prince is inside."" Mrs. Liu went out to worship and said, ""If the prince cannot save the concubine's family, I would like to offer Mrs. Zhen to hold the broom for the prince."" Cao ordered Mrs. Zhen to bow before him. Cao looked at him and said, ""It's really my son and wife!"" So he ordered Cao Pi to accept him.",Cao Cao proves to be a benevolent ruler of Jizhou.,"As Cao Cao was entering the gate of the conquered city of Yejun, Xu You rode up very quickly, passed him, and pointed with his whip at the gate, saying, “Sir Prime Minister, you would not have been here but for my plans.” Cao Cao laughed, but his generals were very annoyed. When he reached the residence, he stopped at the gate and asked, “Has anyone had gone in?” The guard at the gate said, “Your son is within.” Cao Cao called him out and chided him, but the wife of the late Imperial Protector interposed, saying, “But not for your son we had not been saved. I desire to present to you a lady, of the Zhen family, as a handmaid to your son.” Cao Cao bade them bring out the girl and she bowed before him. After looking at her intently, he said, “Just the wife for him!” And he told Cao Pi to take Lady Zhen to wife."

却說孫策又得陳武為輔：其人身長七尺，面黃睛赤，形容古怪。策甚敬愛之，拜為校尉，使作先鋒，攻薛禮。武引十數騎突入陣去，斬首級五十餘顆。薛禮閉門不敢出。策正攻城，忽有人報劉繇會合笮融去取牛渚。孫策大怒，自提大軍竟奔牛渚。劉繇、笮融二人出馬迎敵。孫策曰：“吾今到此，你如何不降？”劉繇背後一人挺鎗出馬，乃部將于糜也；與策戰不三合，被策生擒過去，撥馬回陣。繇將樊能，見捉了于糜，挺鎗來趕。那鎗剛搠到策後心，策陣上軍士大叫：“背後有人暗算！”策回頭，忽見樊能馬到，乃大喝一聲，聲如巨雷。樊能驚駭，倒翻身撞下馬來，破頭而死。策到門旗下，將于糜丟下，已被挾死。一霎時挾死一將，喝死一將：自此，人皆呼孫策為“小霸王”。,"However, he said that Sun Ce had Chen Wu as a supplement: he was seven feet long, with yellow face and red eyes, and he described him as strange. Ce loved and respected him very much, and worshipped him as a captain, and made him a vanguard to attack Xue Li. Wu Yin, a dozen cavalrymen, rushed into the formation, beheading more than 50 of them. Xue Li closed the door and did not dare to go out. Ce was attacking the city, and suddenly someone reported that Liu Yao would join Zhe Rong to fetch Niu Zhu. Sun Ce was furious, and since he mentioned that the army actually ran to Niuzhu. Liu Yao and Zhe Rong went out to meet the enemy. Sun Ce said: ""I'm here now, why don't you surrender?"" Liu Yao was behind a man with a spear and a horse, and he was the general Mi; Fan Neng, the general of Yao, saw that Yu Mi had been captured, and rushed over with a gun. As soon as the gun reached the back of Ce, the sergeant in Ce's formation shouted, ""There is a plot behind him!"" Ce turned back and saw Fan Nengma arrive, and he shouted loudly, with a sound like thunder. Fan Neng was horrified, rolled over and crashed into the horse, breaking his head and dying. He was under the banner of the door, and Yu Mi was left behind, and he was killed. In an instant, one general was killed and one general was drunk: From then on, everyone called Sun Ce the ""little overlord"".","Ignoring Liu Yao’s pleas to stop, and with only one other, rather minor commander joining him, Taishi Ci rides out to fight Sun Ce.","Now Sun Ce acquired a new adherent in the person of Chen Wu. He was a soldier of middle height, sallow of complexion and dark eye, an odd looking man. But Sun Ce held him in high esteem, appointed him Commander, and put him in the van of the attack on Xue Li. As Van Leader, Chen Wu and a dozen horsemen made a dash into the enemy's formation, where they slew half a hundred men. So Xue Li would not fight but remained within his defenses. As Sun Ce was attacking the city, a spy came in with the news that Liu Yao and Ze Rong had gone to attack Niuzhu, which made Sun Ce move thither in haste. His two opponents were ready for battle. “I am here;” said Sun Ce, “you would better give in.” A general came out from behind Liu Yao to accept the challenge. It was Yu Mi. But in the third bout Sun Ce made him prisoner and carried him off to the other side. Seeing his colleague thus captured, Fan Neng rode out to the rescue and got quite close. But just as he was going to thrust, all Sun Ce's soldiers shouted, “There is a man behind you going to strike secretly!” At this Sun Ce turned and shouted so thunderously loud that Fan Neng fell out of his saddle from mere fright. He split his skull and died. When Sun Ce reached his standard, he threw his prisoner to the ground. And Yu Mi was also dead, crushed to death between the arm and the body of his captor. So in a few moments Sun Ce had disposed of two enemies, one crushed to death and one frightened to death. Thereafter Sun Ce was called the Little Prince."

却說曹丕見二婦人啼哭，拔劍欲斬之。忽見紅光滿目，遂按劍而問曰：“汝何人也？”一婦人告曰：“妾乃袁將軍之妻劉氏也。”丕曰：“此女何人？”劉氏曰：“此次男袁熙之妻甄氏也。因熙出鎮幽州，甄氏不肯遠行，故留於此。”丕拖此女近前，見披髮垢面。丕以衫袖拭其面而觀之，見甄氏玉肌花貌，有傾國之色。遂對劉氏曰：“吾乃曹丞相之子也。願保汝家。汝勿憂慮。”遂按劍坐於堂上。,"But he said that Cao Pi saw the two women weeping and drew his sword to kill them. Suddenly seeing the red light filling his eyes, he pressed his sword and asked, ""Who are you?"" A woman said, ""My concubine is the wife of General Yuan's wife Liu."" Pi said, ""Who is this woman?"" Liu said, """" This time, Mrs. Zhen, the wife of Yuan Xi, is also here. Since Mrs. Zhen was out of town in Youzhou, Mrs. Zhen was unwilling to travel far, so she stayed here."" Pi dragged the woman closer and saw her face covered with dirt. Pi wiped his face with the sleeves of his shirt and looked at it, and he saw Zhen's jade complexion and flowery appearance, which had the color of the country. Then he said to Liu Shi: ""I am the son of Prime Minister Cao. I wish to protect your family. You do not have to worry about it.""","Stunned, he asks: ‘Who are you?’ ‘I was the wife of Yuan Shao,’ replies Lady Liu. ‘And who is this?’ demands Cao Pi. ‘This is Lady Zhen,’ says Lady Liu, ‘wife of Yuan Shao’s second son, Yuan Xi.’ Cao Pi lifts the distraught woman up and, brushing her hair away from her face, he sees that she is of extraordinary beauty. Her face is like jade, her skin like a newly blooming flower – a beauty which could overthrow kingdoms. Amazed by her beauty, he immediately offers to protect her, and in honour of his protecting them, his father agrees that this beautiful woman is ideal for his son. With his approval they marry shortly afterwards.","As was said, Cao Pi, having made his way into the Yuans' palace, saw two women there whom he was about to kill. Suddenly a red light shone in his eyes, and he paused. Lowering his sword he said, “Who are you?” “Thy handmaid is the widow of the late Yuan Shao, Lady Liu,” said the elder of the two, “and this is the wife of Yuan Xi, his second son. She was of the Zhen family. When Yuan Xi was sent to command in Youzhou, her family objected to her going so far from home and she stayed behind.” Cao Pi drew Lady Zhen toward him and looked at her closely. Her hair hung disordered, her face was dusty and tear-stained, but when, with the sleeve of his inner garment, he had wiped sway these disfigurements, he saw a woman of exquisite loveliness, with a complexion clear as jade touched with the tender bloom of a flower petal, a woman indeed beautiful enough to ruin a kingdom. “I am the son of the Prime Minister,” said he turning to the elder woman. “I will guarantee your safety, so you need fear nothing.” He then put by his sword and sat down at the upper end of the room."
是夜風雨交作，及曉，不見了于吉屍首。守屍軍士報知孫策。策怒，欲殺守屍軍士。忽見一人，從堂前徐步而來，視之，却是于吉。策大怒，正欲拔劍斫之，忽然昏倒於地。左右急救入臥內，半晌方甦。吳太夫人來視疾，謂策曰：“吾兒屈殺神仙，故招此禍。”策笑曰：“兒自幼隨父出征，殺人如麻，何曾有為禍之理？今殺妖人，正絕大禍，安得反為我禍？”夫人曰：“因汝不信，以致如此；今可作好事以禳之。”策曰：“吾命在天，妖人決不能為禍，何必禳耶？”夫人料勸不信，乃自令左右暗修善事禳解。,"It was night wind and rain, and Xiao, who disappeared Yu Ji's body. The corpse guards reported to Sun Ce. Enraged, he wanted to kill the corpse guard. Suddenly I saw a person, walking slowly from the front of the hall, and looked at it, but it was Yu Ji. Ce was furious, and was about to draw his sword to kill him, when he suddenly fainted and fell to the ground. The left and right were rescued into the bed, and Fang Su took a while. Mrs. Wu Tai came to see the disease and said to Ce, ""My son has killed the immortal, so I brought this disaster."" Ce laughed and said, ""My son went on an expedition with his father since he was a child. It is a great disaster, but Ande is a disaster for me?"" Madam said, ""Because you don't believe it, that's what happened; now you can do a good thing to see it."" Ce said: ""My destiny is in the sky, and demons can never be a disaster, so why bother? What?"" Madam was persuaded not to believe it, so she ordered her left and right to do good deeds secretly.","And without any further ado the soldier’s sword flashes, and Yu is immediately beheaded. His body is left, on Sun Ce’s orders, to rot in the marketplace as a warning to others. In the morning, after a stormy night, the body has disappeared. Sun Ce is about to order the execution of the soldiers who were on guard that night when Sun Ce sees Yu walking boldly in front of the main hall.","That night there came a very violent storm, and when it calmed down at daylight, there was no trace of the body of Yu Ji. The guards reported this, and Sun Ce in his wrath sentenced them to death. But as he did so, he saw Yu Ji calmly walking toward him as if the Taoist Saint were still alive. Sun Ce drew his sword and darted forward to strike at the wraith, but he fainted and fell to the ground. They carried him to his chamber, and in a short time he recovered consciousness. His mother, Lady Wu, came to visit him and said, “My son, you have done wrong to slay the holy one, and this is your retribution.” “Mother, when I was a boy, I went with Father to wars, where people are cut down as one cuts reed stalks. There is not much retribution about such doings. I have put this fellow to death and so checked a great evil. Where does retribution come in?” “This comes of want of faith,” she replied. “Now you must avert the evil by meritorious deeds.” “My fate depends on Heaven; wizards can do me no harm, so why avert anything?” His mother saw that it was useless to try persuasion, but she told his attendants to do some good deeds secretly whereby the evil should be turned aside."

Ling Cao's father and son came to pick up Sun Ce, and they were envoys to lead the army across the river. Yan Baihu gathers bandits and distributes in Xijin Ferry. Cheng Pu fought with the war, defeated him again, and rushed to Kuaiji overnight.","Between them they capture the cities of Jiaxing, Wucheng and Wujun among others.","Sun Ce pressed the attack. Huang Gai captured Jiaxing, and Taishi Ci took Wucheng. Several other southern cities were fallen. The territory was quickly subdued. Yan Baihu rushed off toward Yuhang in the east, plundering on all sides, till a band of villagers under the leadership of one Ling Cao checked his career of robbery there. Yan Baihu then fled toward Kuaiji. Ling Cao and his son then went to meet Sun Ce, who took them into his service, and appointed them Commanders as a reward for their service, and the joint forces crossed the Great River. The White Tiger, Yan Baihu, gathered his scattered forces and took up a position at Western Ford, but Cheng Pu attacked him there and scattered the defenders, chasing them as far as Kuaiji."

Go to Liyang, and see the arrival of an army. One person in the lead: with a handsome appearance and beautiful appearance; when he saw Sun Ce, he dismounted and bowed. The person who planned to look at him was from Shucheng, Lujiang: surnamed Zhou, given name Yu, and styled Gongjin. It turned out that when Sun Jian was begging Dong Zhuo, he moved his home to Shucheng. Yu and Sun Ce were very close in the same year because they became Kunzhong. Policing Chang Yu for two months, Yu served as a brother-in-law. Uncle Yu, Zhou Shang, is the prefect of Danyang. Today, I am going to save my relatives and meet Ce here. Ce Jian Yu was overjoyed and expressed his sincere affection. Yu said: ""I would like to use the power of dogs and horses to plan great things together."" Cexi said, ""I have won Gongjin, and the great things are harmonious."" Then he ordered Zhu Zhi, Lu Fan and others to meet. Yu asked Ce and said, ""My brother wants to help with a major event, and do you know that there are 'Two Zhang' in Jiangdong?"" Ce said, ""What is 'Er Zhang'?"" Yu said, ""One is Pengcheng Zhang Zhao, spelled Zibu; It is Zhang Hong of Guangling, whose courtesy name is Zigang: Both of them have talents in the sky and latitude, and they live in seclusion here to avoid chaos. Why don't my brother hire him?"" Cexi, swearing, asked people to go to hire him with courtesy, but they all refused to resign. Ce Nai went to his home in person, spoke with joy, hired him, and the two agreed. Ce Sui worshiped Zhang Zhao as the chief history officer, and also served as a general in the Fu army; Zhang Hong was the chief of the staff, and discussed the attack on Liu Yao.","En route he is joined by his childhood companion and friend Zhou Yu, who comes with his own army. He also brings the recommendation that in planning the attack they should seek the assistance of a pair of brothers who could read the auspicious and ill-fated auguries of Heaven and Earth. Meanwhile the prefect Liu Yao, a member of the imperial family, hears that news of his ill treatment of Sun Ce’s family has reached Sun Ce.","Sun Ce thanked his patron most humbly and soon put the army in motion, taking with him his two new advisers and his father's generals—Zhu Zhi, Lu Fan, Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, Han Dang, and others. When Sun Ce reached Linyang, he saw a body of troops in front of him, at their head a dashing leader of handsome and refined mien. As soon as this commander saw Sun Ce, he dismounted and made obeisance. It was Zhou Yu from Shucheng. When Sun Jian was opposing the tyrant Dong Zhuo, he moved his family to Shucheng where the Zhou family had lived. And as Zhou Yu and Sun Ce were of the same age all but two months, they became exceedingly good friends and sworn brothers, Sun Ce being the elder in virtue of his two months' seniority. Zhou Yu was on his way to visit Sun Ce's uncle, Governor Wu Jing of Dangyang, when the happy meeting took place. Naturally Sun Ce confided his projects and inmost ideas to his friend, who at once said, “I shall put my whole life and energy to serve you to reach that grand goal.” “Now that you have come, the design is as good as accomplished,” said Sun Ce. Zhou Yu was introduced to Zhu Zhi and Lu Fan. Zhou Yu said, “Do you know of the two Zhangs of Guangling? They would be most useful people in working out your schemes.” “Who are they, the two Zhangs?” said Sun Ce. “They are men of transcendent genius who are living near here for the sake of tranquillity in these turbulent times. Their names are Zhang Zhao and Zhang Hong. Why not invite them to help you, Brother?” Sun Ce lost no time in sending letters and gifts, but they both declined. Then he visited them in person, was greatly pleased with their speech and by dint of large gifts and much persuasion, got them to promise to join him. Sun Ce appointed them both Counselors and Generals. The plan of the attack upon Yangzhou was the next matter for discussion."

Suddenly a man entered from outside and said sharply: ""Kong Ming is a genius in the world, you and the others are difficult to talk to each other, not respecting guests. !"" Everyone regards him as a native of Lingling, surnamed Huang, given name Gai, styled Gongfu, and is now a grain official of the Eastern Wu Dynasty. At that time, Huang Gai said to Kong Ming: ""It is better to be silent and be silent when you hear a lot of words. Why don't you talk about the theory of gold and stone as my master, and then argue with everyone?"" Don't let me hear you."" So Huang Gai and Lu Su led Kong Ming in. When they arrived at the Zhongmen, they were meeting Zhuge Jin, and Kongming gave him the salute. Jin said: ""My wise brother is in Jiangdong, why didn't he come to see me?"" Kong Ming said: ""My brother is in Liu Yuzhou, and it is reasonable to put the public first and then the private. The public affairs are not finished, so I dare not go to the private. I hope my brother will forgive me."" Jin said. : ""Brother Xian has seen Marquis Wu, but he came to talk about it."" After speaking, he went away.","Sun Quan, after the opening formal greetings, goes straight to the heart of the matter and asks Kong Ming how strong Cao Cao really is in terms of his military forces. To Lu Su’s astonishment, Kong Ming says, ‘If you add up cavalry, infantry and naval, well over a million men!’ Horrified, Sun Quan asks whether this is not an exaggeration, so Kong Ming tallies all the troops. ‘Actually it is nearer one and a half million but I deliberately understated so as not to scare your lordship!’ says Kong Ming. Lu Su is completely bewildered by this change of what he thought was an agreed tactic. Kong Ming continues, ‘He’s heading this way so what other plans could he have than to conquer the south? If you want my opinion – though you may find you don’t like it – I believe you should abandon any thought of an alliance with Cao Cao even though I know your advisers suggest otherwise. They, I know, just want you to face north and surrender.’ Overcome with indecision and anxiety, Sun Quan leaves in a flurry, and Lu Su rounds on Kong Ming: ‘Why on earth did you have to upset Sun Quan with such dismissive words?’","Only two of them, Zhang Wen and Luo Tong, had failed to challenge him, but when they would have tried to pose Zhuge Liang, suddenly some one appeared from without and angrily shouted, “This is not paying fit respect to a guest. You have among you the most wonderful man of the day, and you all sit there trying to entangle him in speech while our archenemy Cao Cao is nearing our borders. Instead of discussing how to oppose Cao Cao, you are all wrangling and disputing.” All eyes turned toward the speaker; it was Huang Gai of Lingling, who was the Chief of the Commissariat of the South Land. He turned to address Zhuge Liang, saying, “There is a saying that though something may be gained by talk, there is more to be got by silence. Why not give my lord the advantage of your valuable advice instead of wasting time in discussion with this crowd?” “They did not understand,” replied Zhuge Liang, “and it was necessary to enlighten them, so I had to speak.” As Huang Gai and Lu Su led the guest toward their master's apartments; they met his brother Zhuge Jin. Zhuge Liang saluted him with the deference due to an elder brother, and Zhuge Jin said, “Why have you not been to see me, Brother?” “I am now in the service of Liu Bei of Yuzhou, and it is right that public affairs precede private obligations. I cannot attend to any private matters till my work is done. You must pardon me, Brother.” “After you have seen Marquis Sun Quan, you will come and tell me your news,” said he as he left."

Yang Feng found an ox cart and carried the emperor to Dayang. He went on a hunger strike and stayed in a tiled house for the night. The old man ate millet and rice. The upper and the rear ate together. The next day, he appointed Li Le as the general to conquer the North, and Han Xian as the general to conquer the East, and set off to drive forward. There were two ministers who came to them, crying and bowing in front of the chariot: they were Taiwei Yang Biao and Tai servant Han Rong. The emperor and queen cry. Han Rong said: ""The two thieves, Jue and Si, quite believe what the minister said; the minister gave up his life to say that the two thieves will stop the army. Your Majesty is good at protecting the dragon body."" Han Rong went away. Li Le asked the emperor to enter Yang Feng's camp for a break. Yang Biao invited the imperial capital of Anyi County. When driving to Anyi, there is no high house, and the emperors and queens all live in thatched huts; there is no door to close, and thorns are placed on the four sides to shield it. The emperor and ministers discussed matters under the thatched hut, and the generals led troops outside the fence to suppress them. Li Le and others had the exclusive power, and when the officials violated them a little, they were beaten and scolded in front of the emperor; they deliberately sent turbid wine and rough food to the emperor, and the emperor reluctantly accepted them. Li Le and Han Xian also have more than 200 names of Baozuo Wushu, trilogy, witch doctor, and pawns, and they are school captains, censors and other officials. If the engraving is not as good as it is, it is completely inappropriate to draw it with a cone.","This leaves the emperor with but a handful of servants and Li Yue and Yang Feng, who tries his best to care for the imperial couple. Commandeering a farm wagon, he manages to get the couple to the town of Dayang, but there is nothing there for them to eat. Pressing on, they spend the night in a rough farm hut, and though the local peasants offer them food it is so coarse they cannot eat it. Eventually the sad procession arrives in Anyi, but here there are no grand buildings, just simple, one-storey huts. It is in one of these that the imperial couple at last rest. It is at this point that Li Yue shows his true nature and begins to bully everyone, attacking the courtiers and denouncing people before the throne for no reason whatsoever. The food and drink he gives to the emperor is deliberately of poor quality, and he forces the emperor to appoint other White Wave leaders to positions of authority. The court has reached its lowest ebb yet. However, the mission to reconcile Li Jue and Guo Si in order to protect the emperor is eventually successful.","When they mustered on the farther bank, many were missing, only a dozen of the Emperor's suite were left. Yang Feng found a bullock cart and transported the Emperor and Empress to Dayang. They had no food and at night sought shelter in a poor, tile-roofed house. The cottagers gave them some boiled millet but it was too coarse to be swallowed. Next day the Emperor conferred titles on those who had protected him. Li Yue was made General Who Conquers the North, and Han Xian was appointed General Who Conquers the East. The flight continued. Soon two officers of rank came up with the cortege, and they bowed before His Majesty with many tears. They were Regent Marshal Yang Biao and Minister Han Rong. The Emperor and Empress lifted up their voices and wept with them. Said Han Rong to his colleague, “The rebels have confidence in my words. You stay as guard of the Emperor, and I will take my life in my hands and try to bring about peace.” After Han Rong had gone, the Emperor rested for a time in Yang Feng's camp. But Yang Biao requested the Emperor to head for Anyi and make the capital there. When the train reached the town, they found it containing not a single lofty building, and the court lived in grass huts devoid even of doors. They surrounded these with a fence of thorns as a protection, and within this the Emperor held counsel with his ministers. The soldiers camped round the fence. Now Li Yue and his fellow ruffians showed their true colors. They wielded the powers of the Emperor as they wished, and officials who offended them were beaten or abused even in the presence of the Emperor. They purposely provided thick wine and coarse food for the Emperor's consumption. He struggled to swallow what they sent. Li Yue and Han Xian joined in recommending to the Throne the names of convicts, common soldiers, sorcerers, leeches, and such people who thus obtained official ranks. There were more than two hundred of such people. As seals could not be engraved, pieces of metal were hammered into some sort of a shape."

却說孫權自孫策死後，據住江東，承父兄基業，廣納賢士，開賓館於吳會，命顧雍、張紘延接四方賓客。連年以來，你我相薦。時有會稽闞澤，字德潤；彭城嚴畯，字曼才；沛縣薛綜，字敬文；汝陽程秉，字德樞；吳郡朱桓，字休穆；陸續，字公紀；吳人張温，字惠恕；烏傷駱統，字公緒；烏程吾粲，字孔休：此數人皆至江東，孫權敬禮甚厚。又得良將數人，乃汝陽呂蒙，字子明；吳郡陸遜，字伯言；瑯琊徐盛，字文嚮；東郡潘璋，字文珪；廬江丁奉，字承淵。文武諸人，共相輔佐。由此江東稱得人之盛。建安七年，曹操破袁紹，遣使往江東，命孫權遣子入朝隨駕。權猶豫未決。吳太夫人命周瑜、張昭等面議。張昭曰：“操欲令我遣子入朝，是牽制諸侯之法也。然若不令去，恐其興兵下江東，勢必危矣。”周瑜曰：“將軍承父兄遺業，兼六郡之衆，兵精糧足，將士用命，有何逼迫而欲送質於人？質一入，不得不與曹氏連和；彼有命召，不得不往：如此，則見制於人也。不如勿遣，徐觀其變，別以良策禦之。”吳太夫人曰：“公瑾之言是也。”權遂從其言，謝使者，不遣子。自此曹操有下江南之意。但正值北方未寧，無暇南征。建安八年十一月，孫權引兵伐黃祖，戰於大江之中。祖軍敗績。權部將凌操，輕舟當先，殺入夏口，被黃祖部將甘寧一箭射死。凌操子凌統，時年方十五歲，奮力往奮父屍而歸。權見風色不利，收軍還東吳。,"However, Sun Quan said that after Sun Ce's death, he lived in Jiangdong, inherited the legacy of his father and brother, recruited wise men, opened a hotel in Wuhui, and ordered Gu Yong and Zhang Hong to receive guests from all over the world. Over the years, you and I have recommended each other. There are Kuaiji Kanze, courtesy name Derun; Pengcheng Yanfan, courtesy name Mancai; Peixian Xue Zong, courtesy name Jingwen; Ruyang Cheng Bing, courtesy name Deshu; Wu Jun Zhu Huan, courtesy name Xiumu; successively, Gongji; Wu The people were Zhang Wen, courtesy name Huishu; Wushang Luotong, courtesy name Gongxu; Wu Chengwucan, courtesy name Kongxiu: all of them went to Jiangdong, and Sun Quan gave them great respect. There were also several good generals. They were Ruyang Lu Meng, courtesy name Ziming; Wu County Lu Xun, courtesy name Boyan; Langya Xu Sheng, courtesy name Wenxiang; Dong County Pan Zhang, courtesy name Wengui; Lujiang Dingfeng, courtesy name Chengyuan. Civil and military people, help each other. Therefore, Jiangdong is called the prosperity of people. In the seventh year of Jian'an, Cao Cao defeated Yuan Shao, sent an envoy to Jiangdong, and ordered Sun Quan to send his son to accompany him. Right hesitates. Mrs. Wu Tai ordered Zhou Yu, Zhang Zhao and others to negotiate face to face. Zhang Zhao said: ""If you want me to send my son to the court, this is the way to keep the princes in check. However, if you don't order me to go, I'm afraid that they will send troops to the east of the Yangtze River, and it will be in danger."" Zhou Yu said: ""The general will inherit the legacy of his father and brother, and he will also be the sixth The people of the county have enough soldiers, fine grains, and soldiers to use their lives. What is the persecution and want to send the hostage to someone? Once the hostage enters, they have to make peace with the Cao clan; Also, it is better not to send it, Xu watch the change, don't use good strategies to control it."" Mrs. Wu said: ""Gong Jin's words are true."" Since then, Cao Cao has the intention of going to the south of the Yangtze River. But at the time when the north was still in peace, there was no time to go south. In November of the eighth year of Jian'an, Sun Quan led troops to attack Huang Zu and fought in the river. The ancestors lost. Quan's general Ling Cao, led by Qingzhou, rushed into Xiakou and was shot dead by Huang Zu's general Gan Ning. Ling Cao's son Ling Tong, who was fifteen years old at the time, worked hard to return to his father's corpse. Quan saw that the situation was unfavorable, so he withdrew his army and returned to Soochow.","Confronted with such sincerity, Kong Ming gives in and agrees to join Xuande. The first piece of advice he gives Xuande is that, as Cao Cao is training his men in naval warfare, he must be preparing an invasion of the south by river. In the south, Sun Quan is busy consolidating his position even as Cao Cao makes demands such as that Sun Quan’s son should come to the imperial court to ‘serve’ the emperor – in fact to be a hostage in the grip of Cao Cao.","Now after Sun Quan succeeded to the heritage of his father and brother, he sent far and wide to invite people of ability to aid him. He established lodging places for them in Kuaiji in Wu, and directed Gu Yong and Zhang Hong to welcome and entertain all those who came. And year by year they flocked in, one recommending another. Among them were Kan Ze of Kuaiji; Yan Jun of Pengcheng; Xue Yong of Beishan; Cheng Bing of Runan; Zhu Huan of Wujun; Lu Ji of the same place; Zhang Wen of Wucheng; Luo Tong of Kuaiji; and Wu Can of Wushang; and all these scholars were treated with great deference. Many able leaders came also. Among them were Lu Meng of Runan; Lu Xun of Wujun; Xu Sheng of Langye; Pan Zhang of Dongjun; and Ding Feng of Lujiang. Thus Sun Quan obtained the assistance of many poeple of ability both in peace and war and all went well with him. In the seventh year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 202), Cao Cao had broken the power of Yuan Shao. Then he sent a messenger to the South Land ordering Sun Quan to send his son to court to serve in the retinue of the Emperor. Sun Quan, however, hesitated to comply with this request, and the matter was the subject of much discussion. His mother, Lady Wu, sent for Zhou Yu and Zhang Zhao and asked their advice. Zhang Zhao said, “Cao Cao wishes a son to be present at court as a hostage whereby he has a hold upon us, as formerly was the case with all the feudal chiefs. If we do not comply with this request, he will doubtless attack the territory. There is some peril.” Zhou Yu said, “Our lord has succeeded to the heritage and has a large army of veterans and ample supplies. He has able officers ready to do his bidding, and why should he be compelled to send a hostage to any perosn? To send a hostage is to be forced into joining Cao Cao, and to carry out his behests, whatever they be. Then we shall be in his power. It would be better not to send, but rather to wait patiently the course of events and prepare plans to attack.” “That is also my opinion,” said the Dowager. So Sun Quan dismissed the messenger but did not send his son. Cao Cao resented this and had since nourished schemes against the South Land. But their realization had been delayed by the dangers on the north and, so far, no attack had been made. Late in the eighth year (AD 203), Sun Quan led his armies against Huang Zu and fought on the Great River, where he was successful in several battles. One of Sun Quan's leaders, Ling Cao, led a fleet of light vessels up the river and broke into Xiakou but was killed by an arrow of Gan Ning, a general of Huang Zu. Ling Cao left a son, Ling Tong, fifteen years of age, who led another expedition to recover his father's corpse and was so far successful. After that, as the war was inclined to go against him, Sun Quan returned again to his own country."
不說曹仁敗回許昌。且說玄德大獲全勝，引軍入樊城，縣令劉泌出迎。玄德安民已定。那劉泌乃長沙人，亦漢室宗親，遂請玄德到家，設宴相待。只見一人侍立於側。玄德視其人器宇軒昂，因問泌曰：“此何人？”泌曰：“此吾之甥寇封，本羅侯寇氏之子也；因父母雙亡，故依於此。”玄德愛之，欲嗣為義子。劉泌欣然從之，遂使寇封拜玄德為父，改名劉封。玄德帶回，令拜雲長、翼德為叔。雲長曰：“兄長旣有子，何必用螟蛉？後必生亂。”玄德曰：“吾待之如子，彼必事吾如父，何亂之有？”雲長不悅。玄德與單福計議，令趙雲引一千軍守樊城。玄德領衆自回新野。,"Not to mention that Cao Ren was defeated and returned to Xuchang. Let's say that Xuande won a great victory, and he led the army into Fancheng, and the county magistrate Liu Bi came out to welcome him. Xuande settles down. That Liu Bi was a native of Changsha and a relative of the Han family, so he invited Xuande to come home and held a banquet to treat each other. I saw only one person standing by the side. Xuande regarded his human body as high and lofty, because he asked Bi, ""Who is this?"" Bi said: ""This is my nephew Koufeng, the son of the Luohou Kou family; because both parents died, so I depend on this."" Xuande. De loves him, and wants to be his adopted son. Liu Mi readily followed, so Kou Feng worshipped Xuande as his father and changed his name to Liu Feng. Xuande brought it back and made Bai Yunchang and Yide his uncles. Yun Chang said, ""My brother has a son, so why should we use the moth? There will be chaos in the future."" Xuande said, ""I treat him like a son, and he will treat me like a father, so why is there chaos?"" Yun Chang was displeased. Xuande negotiated with Shan Fu and ordered Zhao Yun to lead a thousand troops to defend Fancheng. Xuande led the crowd back to Xinye.","When Cao Cao decides to attack Xuande and sends his cousin Cao Ren to oversee taking Xinye and capturing Xuande, it is Shan Fu whose advice Xuande follows.","While the defeated Cao Ren had to find his way back to the capital, Liu Bei had scored a great success. Afterwards he marched to Fankou, where he was welcomed by Magistrate Liu Mi, himself a scion of the ruling family, who had been born in Changsha. He received Liu Bei as a guest in his own house and gave banquets and treated him exceedingly well. In the train of the Magistrate, Liu Bei saw a very handsome and distinguished-looking young man, and asked who he was. Liu Mi replied, “He is my nephew, Kou Feng, an orphan, whom I am taking care of.” Liu Bei had taken a great liking for the lad and proposed to adopt him. His guardian was willing, and so the adoption was arranged. The young man's name was changed to Liu Feng. When Liu Bei left, he took his adopted son with him. Liu Feng was then made to bow before Guan Yu and Zhang Fei as uncles. Guan Yu was doubtful of the wisdom of adopting another son, saying, “You have a son; why do you think it necessary to adopt another? It may cause confusion.” “How? I shall treat him as a father should, and he will serve me as befits a son.” Guan Yu was displeased. Then Liu Bei and San Fu began further discussions of strategy, and they decided to leave Zhao Yun with one thousand soldiers to guard Fankou, and they returned to Xinye."
且說張角一軍，前犯幽州界分。幽州太守劉焉，乃江夏竟陵人氏，漢魯恭王之後也；當時聞得賊兵將至，召校尉鄒靖計議。靖曰：“賊兵衆，我兵寡，明公宜作速招軍應敵。”劉焉然其說，隨卽出榜招募義兵。榜文行到涿縣，引出涿縣中一個英雄。那人不甚好讀書；性寬和，寡言語，喜怒不形於色；素有大志，專好結交天下豪傑；生得身長七尺五寸，兩耳垂肩，雙手過膝，目能自顧其耳，面如冠玉，脣若塗脂；中山靖王劉勝之後，漢景帝閣下玄孫：姓劉，名備，字玄德。昔劉勝之子劉貞，漢武時封涿鹿亭侯，後坐酎金失侯，因此遺這一枝在涿縣。玄德祖劉雄，父劉弘。弘曾舉孝廉，亦嘗作吏，早喪。玄德幼孤，事母至孝；家貧，販屨織蓆為業。家住本縣樓桑村。其家之東南，有一大桑樹，高五丈餘，遙望之，童童如車蓋。相者云：“此家必出貴人。”玄德幼時，與鄕中小兒戲於樹下，曰：“我為天子，當乘此車蓋。”叔父劉元起奇其言，曰：“此兒非常人也！”因見玄德家貧，常資給之。年十五歲，母使游學，嘗師事鄭玄、盧植；與公孫瓚等為友。及劉焉發榜招軍時，玄德年已二十八歲矣。,"Let's talk about Zhang Jiao's army, the former offender of the Youzhou boundary. Liu Yan, the prefect of Youzhou, was a native of Jingling in Jiangxia and was the descendant of King Gong of Han Lu. At that time, he heard that the bandit army was approaching, and called the captain of the school, Zou Jing, to make a plan. Jing said: ""There are many thieves and soldiers, and I have few soldiers. It is advisable for the Duke of Ming to quickly recruit troops to respond to the enemy."" Liu Yanran said, and followed the list to recruit righteous soldiers. Bang Wen traveled to Zhuo County, leading out a hero in Zhuo County. That man is not very good at reading; he has a gentle nature, few words, his emotions and anger are not visible; he is always ambitious, and specializes in making friends with heroes in the world; he was born seven feet five inches in length, his ears hang down from his shoulders, his hands are over his knees, and his eyes can see Gu Qier's face is like a crown of jade, and his lips are like grease; after Liu Sheng, King of Zhongshan Jing, the great-grandson of His Excellency Emperor Jing of Han: surnamed Liu, given name Bei, and styled Xuande. In the past, Liu Zhen, the son of Liu Sheng, was named Marquis of Zhuolu Ting in the Han Dynasty, and he was lost to Marquis of Shojin, so he left this branch in Zhuo County. Xuande ancestor Liu Xiong, father Liu Hong. Hong Zeng was filial and honest, also tried to be an official, and died early. Xuande was a young orphan, and he served his mother with filial piety; He lives in Lousang Village in this county. To the southeast of his home, there is a large mulberry tree, more than five feet high, looking at it, it looks like a car cover. The prime minister said: ""There will be noble people in this family."" When Xuande was young, he played with the children of Yanzhong under the tree, saying: ""I am the Son of Heaven, and I should ride this car cover."" Also!"" Seeing that Xuande's family was poor, he was given permanent funds. When he was fifteen years old, his mother sent him to study abroad, and served as teachers Zheng Xuan and Lu Zhi; he became friends with Gongsun Zan and others. When Liu Yan issued a list to recruit troops, Xuande was already twenty-eight years old.","Zhang Jue’s army invades the area where the governor is a man called Liu Yan, a distant member of the imperial family. He is advised to urgently issue a written proclamation in order to recruit an army of volunteers. The proclamation is posted up in Zhuo County, where one man, a true hero, sees it. While he is not a scholar, he is a good man: generous, reserved and modest. His greatest aspiration is to befriend the worthiest men of the empire. He is a tall man, with arms that reach down below his knees. He has long earlobes, and his eyes are so wide apart he can actually see his own ears. His face is as pure as jade, while his lips are bright-red. This man is called Xuande, meaning Mystic Virtue. His family surname is Liu, and his given name Bei. His father died when he was young, leaving him and his mother in poverty despite being descendants of the imperial family. In order to survive, he wove mats and sandals which he then sold. They lived in a village named after its huge mulberry tree, two storeys high, which looked like a canopy for an imperial carriage. Once a fortune-teller foretold that a man of significance would emerge from this village. And one day, when he was a young child, playing under the canopy of the tree, Xuande said, ‘When I am the Son of Heaven, my carriage will have a canopy just like this.’ His uncle, Liu Yuanqi, who took care of the poor family and often supported his nephew, commented that this was no ordinary child. At the age of fifteen Xuande’s mother sent him away to school. Xuande is twenty-eight years old when he reads the proclamation posted by Governor Liu.","Meanwhile Zhang Jue led his army into Youzhou, the northeastern region of the empire. The Imperial Protector of Youzhou was Liu Yan, a scion of the Imperial House. Learning of the approach of the rebels, Liu Yan called in Commander Zhou Jing to consult over the position. Zhou Jing said, “They are many and we few. We must enlist more troops to oppose them.” Liu Yan agreed and he put out notices calling for volunteers to serve against the rebels. One of these notices was posted up in the county of Zhuo, where lived one man of high spirit. This man was no mere bookish scholar, nor found he any pleasure in study. But he was liberal and amiable, albeit a man of few words, hiding all feeling under a calm exterior. He had always cherished a yearning for high enterprise and had cultivated the friendship of humans of mark. He was tall of stature. His ears were long, the lobes touching his shoulders, and his hands hung down below his knees. His eyes were very big and prominent so that he could see backward past his ears. His complexion was as clear as jade, and he had rich red lips. He was a descendant of Prince Faubus of Zhongshan whose father was the Emperor Myers, the occupant of the Dragon Throne a century and a half BC. His name was Liu Bei. Many years before, one of his forbears had been the governor of that very county, but had lost his rank for remissness in ceremonial offerings. However, that branch of the family had remained on in the place, gradually becoming poorer and poorer as the years rolled on. His father Liu Hong had been a scholar and a virtuous official but died young. The widow and orphan were left alone, and Liu Bei as a lad won a reputation for filial piety. At this time the family had sunk deep in poverty, and Liu Bei gained his living by selling straw sandals and weaving grass mats. The family home was in a village near the chief city of Zhuo. Near the house stood a huge mulberry tree, and seen from afar its curved profile resembled the canopy of a wagon. Noting the luxuriance of its foliage, a soothsayer had predicted that one day a man of distinction would come forth from the family. As a child, Liu Bei played with the other village children beneath this tree, and he would climb up into it, saying, “I am the Son of Heaven, and this is my chariot .” His uncle, Liu Yuanqi, recognized that Liu Bei was no ordinary boy and saw to it that the family did not come to actual want. When Liu Bei was fifteen, his mother sent him traveling for his education. For a time he served Zheng Xuan and Lu Zhi as masters. And he became great friends with Gongsun Zan. Liu Bei was twenty-eight when the outbreak of the Yellow Scarves called for soldiers."
董卓招誘何進兄弟部下之兵，盡歸掌握。私謂李儒曰：“吾欲廢帝立陳留王，何如？”李儒曰：“今朝廷無主，不就此時行事，遲則有變矣。來日於温明園中，召集百官，諭以廢立；有不從者斬之，則威權之行，正在今日。”卓喜。次日大排筵會，遍請公卿。公卿皆懼董卓，誰敢不到。卓待百官到了，然後徐徐到園門下馬，帶劍入席。酒行數巡，卓敎停酒止樂，乃厲聲曰：“吾有一言，衆官靜聽。”衆皆側耳。卓曰：“天子為萬民之主，無威儀不可以奉宗廟社稷。今上懦弱，不若陳留王聰明好學，可承大位。吾欲廢帝，立陳留王，諸大臣以為何如？”諸官聽罷，不敢出聲。座上一人推案直出，立於筵前，大呼：“不可！不可！汝是何人，敢發大語？天子乃先帝嫡子，初無過失，何得妄議廢立？汝欲為篡逆耶？”卓視之，乃荊州刺史丁原也。卓怒叱曰：“順我者生，逆我者死！”遂掣佩劍欲斬丁原。時李儒見丁原背後一人，生得器宇軒昂，威風凜凜，手執方天畫戟，怒目而視。李儒急進曰：“今日飲宴之處，不可談國政；來日向都堂公論未遲。”衆人皆勸丁原上馬而去。,"Dong Zhuo recruited the soldiers of He Jin's brother's subordinates and controlled them all. I asked Li Ru privately, ""I want to abolish the emperor and establish King Chenliu, so what?"" Li Ru said, ""There is no leader in the court today, so if you don't act at this time, it will change later. In the next day, in Wenming Garden, we will convene a hundred officials. The decree is to abolish the establishment; if there are those who do not obey, they will be killed, and the act of authoritarianism is today."" Zhuo Xi. The next day, a large banquet was held, and the ministers were invited all over the place. The ministers were all afraid of Dong Zhuo, who would dare not. Zhuo waited for the hundred officials to arrive, and then slowly went to the garden gate to dismount, and took the sword to the table. After a few tours of the wine line, Zhuo Ji stopped drinking and stopped enjoying himself. Then he said sharply: ""I have a word, all the officials listen carefully."" Everyone turned their ears. Zhuo said: ""The Son of Heaven is the lord of all the people, and without prestige, he can't be enshrined in ancestral temples and shrines. Today's cowardice is not as smart as King Chenliu, who is smart and eager to learn. I want to abolish the emperor and establish King Chenliu. What do the ministers think? ?"" After hearing this, the officials did not dare to make a sound. One person in the seat pushed the case straight out, stood in front of the banquet, and shouted: ""No! No! Who are you, who dare to speak out? The Son of Heaven is the direct son of the first emperor. Inverse?"" Zhuo Shizhi was the prefect of Jingzhou, Ding Yuan. Zhuo shouted angrily, ""Whoever obeys me will live, and whoever goes against me will die!"" Then he took his sword and tried to cut Ding Yuan. At that time, Li Ru saw a person behind Ding Yuan, who was born with a dignified and majestic appearance, holding a Fang Tianhua halberd in his hand, and glared angrily. Li Ru rushed in and said, ""The place where the banquet is held today should not be discussed about state affairs; it will not be too late to talk to the public in the future."" Everyone persuaded Ding Yuan to mount his horse and leave.","Dong Zhuo’s assistant is Li Ru, and it is not long before Dong Zhuo speaks in secret to him, whispering that he is planning to remove the current emperor and put Prince Xie on the throne instead. Li Ru agrees with him and comes up with a plan as to how this should be done. The very next day, at a grand feast and in the presence of the key nobles, Dong Zhuo springs his surprise. ‘We know that the emperor, as Son of Heaven, is lord of everything that is below Heaven,’ he says. ‘But if he is without gravitas, he cannot fulfil everything that is demanded of him by his ancestors. Our current emperor does not have this gravitas, but his brother Prince Xie most definitely does. So I propose to depose the current emperor and place his brother on the throne. Do any of you here have anything to say?’ Only one person, Ding Yuan, speaks out. ‘This is absolutely wrong!’ he shouts. Dong Zhuo wants to kill him there and then but is restrained by his assistant Li Ru. Ding Yuan flees in order to save his life and to gather his troops.","Dong Zhuo induced the soldiers of the two brothers He Jin and He Miao to join his command, and privately spoke to his adviser Li Ru about deposing the Emperor in favor of the Prince of Chenliu. “The government is really without a head; there can be no better time than this to carry out your plan. Delay will spoil all. Tomorrow assemble the officials in the Wenming Garden and address them on the subject. Put all opponents to death, and your prestige is settled.” So spoke Li Ru and the words pleased Dong Zhuo mightily. So the next day Dong Zhuo spread a feast and invited many guests. As all the officers went in terror of him, no one dared be absent. Dong Zhuo himself rode up to the garden last of all and took his place with his sword girded on. When the wine had gone round several times, Dong Zhuo stopped the service and the music and began to speak. “I have something to say; listen quietly all of you.” All turned towards him. “The emperor is lord of all; and if he lacks dignity and behaves in an unseemly manner, he is no fitting inheritor of the ancestral prerogatives. He who is now on the throne is a weakling, inferior to the Prince of Chenliu in intelligence and love of learning. The Prince is in every way fitted for the throne. I desire to depose the Emperor and set up the Prince in his place. What think you?” The assembly listened in perfect silence, none daring at first to utter a word of dissent. But one dared; for suddenly a guest stood up in his place, smote the table and cried. “No! No! Who are you that you dare utter such bold words? The Emperor is the son of the lawful consort and has done no wrong. Why then should he be deposed? Are you a rebel?” The speaker was Ding Yuan, Imperial Protector of Jingzhou. Dong Zhuo glared at Ding Yuan, roaring, “There is life for those who are with me, death for those against.” Dong Zhuo drew his sword and made for the objector. But the watchful Li Ru had noticed standing behind Ding Yuan a particularly dangerous looking henchman of his, who was now handling his halberd threateningly, and whose eyes were blazing with anger. So Li Ru hastily interposed, saying, “ But this is the banquet chamber, and state affairs should be left outside. The matters can be fully discussed tomorrow.” His fellow guests persuaded Ding Yuan to leave, and after his departure Dong Zhuo said, “Is what I said just and reasonable?”"

Yun Ji asked, ""Have you ever seen the two mistresses?"" Yong said, ""The second mistress abandoned the chariot and walked away with a bucket in her arms. I rushed over with flying horses, turned around the hillside, and was stabbed by a general and fell. I got off the horse, and the horse was taken away. I couldn’t fight, so I lay here.” Yun Nai borrowed one of the horses that the soldiers rode to ride with Jian Yong; and then led two soldiers to help Jian Yong go first and report to the master. : ""I went up to the sky and went to the ground, anyway, looking for the mistress and the little master. If I can't find it, I will die on the battlefield!""","On the battlefield, Zilong has been fighting through the night until dawn comes, desperately seeking his lord and, especially, his family. Distraught, because Xuande has left his family in his care, he decides to go into battle. It is an apparently hopeless plan – a suicide attack because, having failed so badly, he has nothing to live for. There is no point in living now – unless he can find Xuande’s family and especially his son and heir. With a handful of followers he charges into the fray. His hope is that he can find the two wives of Xuande. All around him are the pitiful cries of the people. Such sadness would move even Heaven and Earth to pity. As he rides, he sees a man by the roadside whom he recognizes as Jian Yong. Zilong cries out, ‘Have you seen the two ladies?’ Jian Yong replies, ‘The two ladies abandoned their carriage, taking the child with them, and ran. I chased after them uphill but was attacked and wounded and thrown from my horse. Unable to fight any more, I’ve ended up here.’ Zhao Zilong sends the man off to be cared for and despatches a messenger to Xuande, saying, ‘I’ll search for the two women and the child, going to Heaven or throughout the earth in pursuit, through good or evil, if I have to, and failure will only happen if I die in the attempt.’","So he kept watch. Now Zhao Yun, after fighting with the enemy from the fourth watch till daylight, could see no sign of his lord and, moreover, had lost his lord's family. He thought bitterly within himself, “My master confided to me his family and the child lord Liu Shan; and I have lost them. How can I look him in the face? I can only go now and fight to the death. Whatever happen, I must go to seek the women and my lord's son.” Turning about he found he had but some forty followers left. He rode quickly to and fro among the scattered soldiers seeking the lost women. The lamentations of the people about him were enough to make heaven and earth weep. Some had been wounded by arrows, others by spears; they had thrown away their children, abandoned their wives, and were flying they knew not whither in crowds. Presently Zhao Yun saw a man lying in the grass and recognized him as Jian Yong. “Have you seen the two mothers?” cried he. Jian Yong replied, “They left their carriage and ran away taking the child lord Liu Shan in their arms. I followed but on the slope of the hill I was wounded and fell from my horse. The horse was stolen. I could fight no longer and I lay down here.” Zhao Yun put his colleague on the horse of one of his followers, told off two soldiers to support Jian Yong, and bade Jian Yong ride to their lord and tell him of the loss. “Say,” said Zhao Yun, “that I will seek the lost ones in heaven or hell, through good or evil; and if I find them not, I will die in the desert.”"

Chen Gong and Chen Gui's father and son both arrived. Chen Gong said: ""The disaster in Xuzhou was recruited by Chen Gui's father and son, who wooed the imperial court to seek rank and title. Today, the disaster is on the general. You can cut off the heads of the two and offer Yuan Shu, and the army will retreat."" Bu listened to his words and ordered Capture Chen Gui and Chen Deng. Chen Deng laughed loudly and said, ""Why is it so cowardly? I see the soldiers on the seven routes, like seven piles of rotten grass, why do you mind!"" Bu said: ""You have a plan to defeat the enemy, so that you will be spared the crime of death."" Chen Deng said: ""If the general uses the old man's words, Xuzhou will be safe."" Bu said: ""Try to say it."" Deng said: ""Although there are many soldiers, all of them are Wuhe divisions, and I don't trust them; I guard them with regular soldiers, and go out. There is another plan, not only to protect Xuzhou, but also to capture Yuan Shu alive."" Bu asked, ""The plan will be released?"" Deng said: ""Han Xian and Yang Feng are old officials of the Han Dynasty, and they left because they were afraid of Cao Cao. I can rely on my family and return to Yuan Shu for the time being; the technique must be taken lightly, and he is not happy to use it for the technique. If you use the ruler and book as an internal response, and even Liu Bei as an external partner, you will definitely capture Yuan Shu."" Bu said: ""You must come in person. Han Xian and Yang Feng will send a letter."" Chen Deng promised. Bu Nai published Xudu, and sent a letter to Yuzhou, and then ordered Chen Deng to lead a number of horses, and waited for Han Xian on Xiapi Road. Siam brought troops to the village, and after entering the fortress, see you at log in. Xian asked, ""You are from Lu Bu, why are you here?"" Deng laughed and said, ""Someone is a minister of the Han Dynasty, so what is a person from Lu Bu? If you were a general, you would be a minister of Han, but now you are a minister of a traitor. In the past, the power of guarding the pass in Guanzhong has been turned into nothing, and I will not take it as a general. Moreover, Yuan Shu is the most suspicious, and the general will surely be harmed by him. I don’t have a plan earlier today. Han, there is no reason to hate."" Deng Nai published a book. Siam read the book and said, ""I know about it. The public will return first. I will fight back with General Yang and attack him. But when the fire is raised, Marquis Wen can respond with soldiers.""","Determined to destroy Lü Bu, he simultaneously launches seven vast armies to attack Xuzhou. However, one of the seven commanders, Han Xian, is brought over to Lü Bu’s side.","Lu Bu found out from his scouts that his own Xuzhou City was the objective of Zhang Xun; the other towns to be first attacked being Xiaopei, Yidu, Langye, Jieshi, Xiapi, and Junshan. The invading armies were marching twenty miles a day, and plundering the countryside as they advanced. Lu Bu summoned his advisers to a council to which came Chen Gong, Chen Deng, and Chen Gui. When all had assembled Chen Gong said, “This misfortune that has come to us is due to the two Chens, who fawned upon the central government in order to obtain rank and appointments. Now remove the evil by putting these two to death and sending their heads to Yuan Shu. Then he will retire and leave us in peace.” Lu Bu acquiesced and had the two arrested. But the son, Chen Deng, only laughed, saying, “What is this anxiety about? These seven armies are no more to me than so many heaps of rotting straw. They are not worth thinking about.” “If you can show us how to overcome them, I will spare your life,” said Lu Bu. “General, if you will listen to poor me, the region will be perfectly safe.” “Let us hear what you have to say.” “Yuan Shu's troops are numerous but they are only a flock of crows; they are not an army under a leader. There is no mutual confidence. I can keep them at bay with the ordinary guards of the place and could overcome them by some unsuspected stratagem. If I should fail, I have another plan by which I can not only protect the region but capture our enemy.” “Let us have it.” Chen Deng said, “Han Xian and Yang Feng, two of the leaders of our enemies, are old servants of the Han Dynasty who fled from fear of Cao Cao and, being homeless, sought refuge with Yuan Shu. He despises them, and they are dissatisfied with his service. A little letter from the court will secure their help as our allies, and with Liu Bei to help us on the outside, we can certainly overcome Yuan Shu.” “You shall take the letters yourself,” said Lu Bu. Chen Deng agreed, and a memorial detailing his intentions was sent to the capital, letters to Yuzhou to Liu Bei, and finally Chen Deng was sent, with a small escort, to wait for Han Xian on the road to Xiapi. When Han Xian's army had halted and pitched camp, Chen Deng went to see Han Xian who said, “What are you here for? You belong to Lu Bu.” “I am a noble of the court of the great Hans. Why do you call me a Lu Bu's man? If you, General, hitherto a minister of state, now serve a traitor, you will nullify the grand services you rendered in protecting the Emperor in the flight from Changan. Beside, the suspicious Yuan Shu will assuredly do you some harm, and you will regret not having taken this opportunity to work against him.” Han Xian sighed, saying, “I would return to my allegiance if there should be any opportunity.” Thereupon Chen Deng gave him Lu Bu's letter asking for cooperation. Han Xian read it and said, “Yes; I know. You may return to your master and say General Yang Feng and I will turn our weapons and smite Yuan Shu. Look out for a signal flare, and let your master come to our aid.”"
正飲宴間，忽人報曰：“董卓暴屍於市，忽有一人伏其屍而大哭。”允怒曰：“董卓伏誅，士民莫不稱賀；此何人，獨敢哭耶！”遂喚武士：“與吾擒來！”須臾擒至。衆官見之，無不驚駭：原來那人不是別人，乃侍中蔡邕也。允叱曰：“董卓逆賊，今日伏誅，國之大幸。汝為漢臣，乃不為國慶，反為賊哭，何也？”邕伏罪曰：“邕雖不才，亦知大義，豈肯背國而向卓？只因一時知遇之感，不覺為之一哭，自知罪大。願公見原：倘得黥首刖足，使續成漢史，以贖其辜，邕之幸也。”衆官惜邕之才，皆力救之。太傅馬日磾亦密謂允曰：“伯喈曠世逸才，若使續成漢史，誠為盛事。且其孝行素著，若遽殺之，恐失人望。”允曰：“昔孝武不殺司馬遷，後使作史，遂致謗書流於後世。方今國運衰微，朝政錯亂，不可令佞臣執筆於幼主左右，使吾等蒙其訕議也。”日磾無言而退，私謂衆官曰：“王允其無後乎！善人，國之紀也；制作，國之典也。滅紀廢典，豈能久乎？”當下王允不聽馬日磾之言，命將蔡邕下獄中縊死。一時士大夫聞者，盡為流涕。後人論蔡邕之哭董卓，固自不是；允之殺之，亦為已甚。有詩歎曰：,"During the banquet, someone suddenly reported, ""Dong Zhuo threw his corpse in the city, and suddenly a man buried his corpse and cried loudly."" Yun angered, ""Dong Zhuo's corpse was killed, and all the scholars and people would congratulate him; who is the only one who dares to cry!"" Warrior: ""Come with me!"" When the officials saw this, they were all horrified: It turned out that the man was none other than Cai Yong, the servant. Yun Che said: ""Dong Zhuo's rebellion, today's execution is a great blessing for the country. You are a Han minister, and you are not crying for the National Day, but for the thief. Why?"" Back to the country and go to Zhuo? Just because of the feeling of knowing the encounter for a while, I cried for it without realizing it, and I knew it was a big crime. May the public see the original: If you get a tattoo of your head and feet, so that it will continue into the history of the Han Dynasty, in order to atone for his guilt, Yongzhi Fortunately."" The officials cherished Yong's talent and tried their best to save him. Grand Master Ma Ribao also secretly told Yun: ""If Bo Jie is a talented man, if he can continue the history of the Han Dynasty, it will be a great event. Moreover, his filial piety is simple, if he kills him abruptly, he will be disappointed."" In the past, Xiaowu did not kill Sima Qian, but later entrusted him to make history, so he caused the slander to spread to future generations. Now that the country's fortunes are declining, and the government is in chaos, it is not allowed to let the ministers write about the young master, so that we can be slandered by him."" Ri Yu was speechless. After retreating, he said privately to the officials: ""Wang Yun has no heirs! Good people are the discipline of the country; production is the discipline of the country. How can it last for a long time to destroy discipline and abolish the discipline?"" Sent Cai Yong to prison and hanged to death. For a while, the scholar-officials were all runny when they heard it. When future generations talk about Cai Yong's cry to Dong Zhuo, it is certainly not true; it is too much to allow him to kill him. A poem sighs:","When news comes that someone has been heard mourning over the corpse of Dong Zhuo, he is hunted down. It is found to be a very senior official, Cai Yong, who is writing the official history of the dynasty. When asked why he dares mourn such a traitor to the Han, he replies robustly, ‘Once Dong Zhuo treated me kindly, so it was only right that I mourn him.’ Deeply alarmed by his arrest, he pleads, ‘As the recorder of the Han History I am, of course, concerned deeply for the well-being of the Han, but kindness cannot just be ignored. I beg you, brand me, or cut off my feet, but let me live to continue writing the history.’ But Wang Yun fears that, just as Sima Qian7 wrote false stories about the Han, so this man might do the same. So, despite many pleas for clemency, Wang Yun orders his murder. The land is now in uproar. Rebellions break out everywhere. Former generals under Dong Zhuo, fearing for their lives, seek forgiveness from Wang Yun.","While the feasting was in progress it was announced that some one had come and was wailing over Dong Zhuo's corpse exposed in the market place. “Dong Zhuo has been put to death,” said Wang Yun, angrily. “Every body is glad to be rid of him, and yet one is found to lament over him. Who is this?” So Wang Yun gave orders to arrest the mourner and bring him in. Soon he was brought in, and when they saw him all were startled. For he was no other than Imperial Historian Cai Yong. Wang Yun spoke to Cai Yong angrily, “Dong Zhuo has been put to death as a rebel, and all the land rejoices. You, a Han minister, instead of rejoicing, weep for him. Why?” Cai Yong confessed his fault, saying, “I am without talent, yet know what is right. I am the man to turn my back on my country and toward Dong Zhuo. Yet once I experienced his kindness, and I could not help mourning for him. I know my fault is grave, but I pray you regard the reasons. If you will leave my head and only cut off my feet, you may use me to continue the History of Han, whereby I may have the good fortune to be allowed to expiate my fault.” All were sorry for Cai Yong, for he was a man of great talents, and they begged that he might be spared. The Imperial Guardian, Ma Midi, secretly interceded for him, saying, “Cai Yong is famous as a scholar, and he can write glorious history, and it is inadvisable to put to death a man renowned for rectitude without consideration.” But in vain, for the High Minister was now strong and obdurate. Wang Yun said, “Centuries ago, Emperor Wu spared Sima Qian and employed him on the annals, with the result that many slanderous stories have been handed down to us. This is a trying period of great perplexity, and we dare not let a specious fellow like this wield his pen in criticism of those about the court of a youthful prince and abuse us as he will.” Remonstrance and appeal being vain, Ma Midi retired. But he said to his colleagues, “Is Wang Yun then careless of the future? Worthy people are the mainstay of the state; laws are the canons of action. To destroy the mainstay and nullify the laws is to hasten destruction.” As was just said Wang Yun was obdurate. Cai Yong whose offense was an expression of gratitude was thrown into prison and there strangled. The people of that day wept for Cai Yong, for they refused to see any offense in what he had done, and death was a harsh punishment. Dong Zhuo, the dictator, Tyrannized the state,"

且說袁尚與審配商議：“今曹兵運糧入白溝，必來攻冀州，如之奈何？”配曰：“可發檄使武安長尹楷屯毛城，通上黨運糧道；令沮授之子沮鵠守邯鄲，遙為聲援。主公可進兵平原，急攻袁譚。先絕袁譚，然後破曹。”袁尚大喜，留審配與陳琳守冀州，使馬延、張顗二將為先鋒，連夜起兵攻打平原。譚知尚兵來近，告急於操。操曰：“吾今番必得冀州矣。”正說間，適許攸自許昌來；聞尚又攻譚，入見操曰：“丞相坐守於此，豈欲待天雷擊殺二袁乎？”操笑曰：“吾已料定矣。”遂令曹洪先進兵攻鄴，操自引一軍來攻尹楷。兵臨本境，楷引軍來迎。楷出馬，操曰：“許仲康安在？”許褚應聲而出，縱馬直取尹楷。楷措手不及，被許褚一刀斬於馬下，餘衆奔潰。操盡招降之，卽勒兵取邯鄲。沮鵠進兵來迎。張遼出馬，與鵠交鋒。戰不三合，鵠大敗，遼從後追趕。兩馬相離不遠，遼急取弓射之，應弦落馬。操指揮軍馬掩殺，衆皆奔散。於是操引大軍前抵冀州。曹洪已近城下。操令三軍遶城築起土山，又暗掘地道以攻之。審配設守堅守，法令甚嚴，東門守將馮禮，因酒醉有誤巡警，配痛責之。馮禮懷恨，潛地出城降操。操問破城之策，禮曰：“突門內土厚，可掘地道而入。”操便命馮禮引三百壯士，夤夜掘地道而入。,"Let us say that Yuan Shang negotiated with Shen Pei: ""Now that Cao's troops are transporting grain into Baigou, they will surely come to attack Jizhou. What should I do?"" Pei said: ""You can send an envoy to Wu'an Chang Yin Kai to settle Maocheng, and it will lead to the party's grain transport road; Order Ju Shou's son Ju Hu to guard Handan and show solidarity from afar. The lord can march into the plains and attack Yuan Tan quickly. First defeat Yuan Tan, and then defeat Cao."" Yuan Shang was overjoyed, leaving Chen Pei and Chen Lin to guard Jizhou, and entrusting Ma Yan and Zhang Yi as the vanguards , and attacked the plains overnight. Tan Zhishang was approaching, and he was in a hurry. Cao said, ""I'll be in Jizhou now."" While he was talking, Shi Xuyou came from Xuchang; Wen Shang attacked Tan again, and when he saw Cao, he said, ""The prime minister is sitting here and guarding here, why do you want to wait for the thunder to strike and kill two Yuan? ?"" Cao laughed and said, ""I have already decided."" Cao Hong then ordered Cao Hong to advance an army to attack Ye, and Cao led an army to attack Yin Kai. When the soldiers approached the territory, Kai led the army to welcome them. Kai got out of the horse, Cao Cao said, ""Is Xu Zhongkang safe?"" Xu Chu responded and took Yin Kai on his horse. Kai was caught off guard and was slashed under the horse by Xu Chu, and the rest of the crowd collapsed. Cao tried to recruit and surrendered, and then mobilized the troops to take Handan. Ju Hu entered the army to welcome him. Zhang Liao went out and confronted Hu. If the battle fails, Hu was defeated, and Liao Cong chased after him. The two horses were not far from each other, and Liao hurriedly took his bow and shot it, and fell off his horse. Cao commanded the horses to cover up the kill, and everyone ran away. So Cao led a large army to Jizhou. Cao Hong was approaching the city. He ordered the three armies to circle around the city to build a mountain of earth, and secretly dig tunnels to attack it. The trial was set up to stick to it, and the laws were very strict. Feng Li, the defender of the east gate, made a mistake in patrolling the police because of drunkenness, and Pei blamed him. Feng Li held a grudge and went out of the city to surrender. When Cao asked about the strategy for breaking the city, Li said: ""The soil inside the gate is thick, so you can dig a tunnel to enter."" Cao then ordered Feng Li to lead three hundred warriors to dig a tunnel in the night.","Cao Cao and Yuan Tan plot against each other until Cao Cao decides that Yuan Tan’s usefulness is at an end. Meanwhile, the struggle for the north sways backwards and forwards between Yuan Shang and Cao Cao. Cities fall and armies are routed until once again Cao Cao stands before the closed gates of Jizhou.","Shen Pei and his master also discussed the current situation. Yuan Shang said, “Cao Cao is getting grain into the White River, which means an attack on Jizhou; what is to be done?” Shen Pei replied, “Send letters to Yin Kai, Commander of Wuan, bidding him camp at Maocheng to secure the road to Shangdang, and direct Ju Gu, son of Ju Shou, to maintain Handan as a distant auxiliary. Then you may advance on Pingyuan and attack Cao Cao.” The plan seemed good. Yuan Shang left Shen Pei and Chen Lin in charge of Yejun, appointed two Commanders Ma Yan and Zhang Yi as Van Leaders, and set out hastily for Pingyuan. When Yuan Tan heard of the approach of his brother's army, he sent urgent messages to Cao Cao, who said to himself, “I am going to get Jizhou this time.” Just at this time it happened that Xun You came down from the capital. When he heard that Yuan Shang was attacking his brother Yuan Tan, he sought Cao Cao and said, “You, Sir, sit here on guard; are you waiting till Heaven's thunder shall strike the two Yuans?” “I have thought it all out,” said Cao Cao. Then he ordered Cao Hong to go and fight against Yejun, while he led another army against Yin Kai in Maocheng. Yin Kai could make no adequate defense and was killed by Xu Chu. His soldiers ran away and presently joined Cao Cao's army. Next Cao Cao led the army to Handan, and Ju Gu came out to fight him. Zhang Liao advanced to fight with Ju Gu, and after the third encounter Ju Gu was defeated and fled. Zhang Liao went after him, and when their two horses were not far apart, Zhang Liao took his bow and shot. The fleeing warrior fell as the bowstring twanged. Cao Cao completed the rout, and Ju Gu's force was broken up. Now Cao Cao led his armies to an attack on Yejun. Cao Hong had arrived before; and a regular siege began. The army encompassed the city and began by throwing up great mounds. They also tunneled subterranean ways. Within the city Shen Pei turned his whole care to the defense and issued the severest commands. The Commandant of the East Gate, Feng Li, got intoxicated and failed to keep his watch for which he was severely punished. Feng Li resented this, sneaked out of the city, went over to the besiegers, and told them how the place could be attacked. “The earth within the Pearly Gate is solid enough to be tunneled, and entrance can be effected there,” said the traitor. So Feng Li was sent with three hundred men to carry out his plan under cover of darkness."

Li Jue and Guo Si were furious, and they took all three Shao Liang and slaughtered to the city, took the three heads, and went straight to the door to give orders. Ma Teng and Han Sui saw that the rations for the army had been exhausted, and they had to withdraw their troops. Li Jue and Guo Si ordered Zhang Ji to lead the army to drive Ma Teng, Fan Chou led the army to drive Han Sui, and the Xiliang army was defeated. Ma Chao fought to the death and retreated Zhang Ji. Fan Chou went to catch up with Han Sui to see if he caught up with him. He was close to Chen Cang. Han Sui restrained his horse and said to Fan Chou, ""My husband and I are the same people. Why are you so ruthless today?"" Han Sui said, ""I'm here to serve as the ear of the state, so why should I push you?"" Fan Chou listened, turned his horse's head, withdrew his troops and returned to the village, and let Han Sui go.","The two key rebel leaders, Li Jue and Guo Si, want to murder the emperor straight away and seize the throne. However, two other leaders, Zhang Ji and Fan Chou, point out, ‘The people won’t stand for it.","Then they decapitated Li Meng and exposed his head. When Li Jue and Guo Si heard that both the boastful generals had fallen under the hand of one young man, they knew that Jia Xu had given good advice and was gifted with clear prescience. So they valued his plans the more highly and decided to act on the defensive. They refused all challenges to combat. Surely enough after a couple of months the supplies of the Xiliang force were all exhausted and the leaders began to consider retreat. Just at this juncture a household servant of Ma Yu's family betrayed his master and told of the conspiracy of the three court officials to assist the attackers. The two chiefs Li Jue and Guo Si in revenge seized the three conspirators—Ma Yu, Chong Shao, and Liu Fan—, with every member of their households, and beheaded them in the market place. The heads of the three were exposed at the front gate of the capital. Being short of food and hearing of the destruction of their three adherents in the city, the only course for Ma Teng and Han Sui was to retreat. At once Zhang Ji went in pursuit of Ma Teng, and Fan Chou followed Han Sui. The retreating army under Ma Teng was beaten, and only by Ma Chao's desperate efforts were the pursuers driven off. Fan Chou pursued the other army; and when he had come close, Han Sui rode boldly up and addressed him, saying, “You and I, Sir, are fellow villagers. Why then behave so unfriendly?” Fan Chou replied, “I must obey the commands of my chief.” “I am here for the service of the state; why do you press me so hard?” said Han Sui. At this Fan Chou turned his horse, called in his troops, and left Han Sui in peace."

過了數日，細作回報：“荊州城中揚起布旛做好事，城外別建新墳，軍士各挂孝。”瑜驚問曰：“沒了甚人？”細作曰：“劉玄德沒了甘夫人，卽日安排殯葬。”瑜謂魯肅曰：“吾計成矣：使劉備束手就縛，荊州反掌可得！”肅曰：“計將安出？”瑜曰：“劉備喪妻，必將續娶。主公有一妹，極其剛勇，侍婢數百，居常帶刀，房中軍器擺列遍滿，雖男子不及。我今上書主公，敎人去荊州為媒，說劉備來入贅。賺到南徐，妻子不能勾得，幽囚在獄中，却使人去討荊州換劉備。等他交割了城池，我別有主意。於子敬身上，須無事也。”魯肅拜謝。周瑜寫了書呈，選快船送魯肅投南徐見孫權，先說借荊州一事，呈上文書。權曰：“你却如此糊塗！這樣文書，要他何用？”肅曰：“周都督有書呈在此，說用此計，可得荊州。”權看畢，點頭暗喜，尋思：“誰人可去？”猛然省曰：“非呂範不可。”遂召呂範至，謂曰：“近聞劉玄德喪婦。吾有一妹，欲招贅玄德為壻，永結姻親，同心破曹，以扶漢室。非子衡不可為媒，望卽往荊州一言。”範領命，卽日收拾船隻，帶數個從人，望荊州來。,"After a few days, he made a detailed report: ""Raise the cloth banners in Jingzhou city to do good deeds, don't build new graves outside the city, and each sergeant will hang filial piety."" Yu asked in surprise, ""Who is missing?"" Madam, arrange a funeral on the next day."" Yu said to Lu Su: ""My plan is done: I will tie Liu Bei's hands, and Jingzhou can get it!"" Su said, ""The plan will be released?"" Yu said, ""Liu Bei lost his wife. , I will continue to marry. The lord has a younger sister, who is extremely brave and has hundreds of servants. She always carries a knife, and the room is full of weapons, although the men are not enough. I am writing to the lord today, and I will send someone to Jingzhou as a matchmaker, saying that Liu Bei is coming. I got married. I earned Nanxu, but my wife couldn't get it, and I was imprisoned in prison, but sent someone to ask Jingzhou to exchange Liu Bei. When he handed over the city, I have no idea. Yu Zijing should be fine."" Lu Su thanked him. Zhou Yu wrote a letter, and chose a fast boat to send Lu Su to Nanxu to see Sun Quan. First, he talked about borrowing Jingzhou and submitted the document. Quan said: ""You are so confused! What is the use of such a document?"" Su said: ""The Governor of Zhou has a document here, saying that with this strategy, Jingzhou can be won."" Who can go?"" She suddenly said, ""It's not Lu Fan."" Then he summoned Lu Fan, saying, ""I recently heard about Liu Xuande's widow. Cao, in order to help the Han family. If Ziheng is not a matchmaker, I hope that you will go to Jingzhou and have a word."" Fan took the order, and he packed up the boat and brought a few followers to Jingzhou.","‘Soon you will see Xuande captured, and then we can sort out Jingzhou!’ ‘But what exactly,’ asks a troubled Lu Su, ‘is your plan?’ ‘Xuande needs a new wife,’ says Zhou Yu, ‘and our lord has a sister, a real warrior woman with hundreds of armed fighting women guards. We will ask Sun Quan to send an emissary to suggest this marriage and then, when he comes for the wedding, we will seize Xuande and demand Jingzhou back as ransom!’ A day or so later he gives Lu Su the document from Xuande and a letter to deliver to Sun Quan and sends him by fast boat to Nanxu. When Lu Su presents Sun Quan with the document outlining the ‘agreement’, Sun Quan erupts in anger. ‘What kind of an idiot are you to agree to this?’ roars Sun Quan. Then Lu Su presents the letter from Zhou Yu. Having read the outline of the secret plot Zhou Yu is proposing, Sun Quan smiles and begins to think of who would be best to carry out this plan. He needs an emissary to go to Xuande to propose the marriage. His thoughts turn to his assistant, Lü Fan. ‘Lü Fan,’ says Sun Quan, ‘I want you to go to Xuande and propose a marriage between himself and my sister so that our two families and armies will be united. Then we can be comrades in arms against Cao Cao. I’ve selected you for this auspicious task.’","Then the scouts came back saying that in Jingzhou everything seemed in excellent order and the white flags were flying everywhere, while outside the city they were building a magnificent mausoleum for Lady Gan, wife of Liu Bei. All the soldiers were in mourning. When Zhou Yu knew who was dead, he said to Lu Su, “My scheme is made. You will see Liu Bei just stand still to be bound, and we shall get Jingzhou like turning a hand.” “What is the main spring of your plan?” said Lu Su. “Liu Bei will want to remarry, and our lord has a sister, Princess Sun Ren. She is a veritable amazon, whose women guards number many hundreds, all armed with weapons of war. Her apartments also are full of such things. I will write to our lord to send an intermediary to arrange that the lady shall wed Liu Bei at her family home, and thus we shall entice Liu Bei to Nanxu. But instead of marrying a wife, Liu Bei will find himself a prisoner, and then we will demand Jingzhou as ransom. When they have handed over the region, I shall find something else to say and nothing will fall on your head.” Lu Su was very grateful. Then Zhou Yu wrote letters to his master, and a swift boat was chosen to take Lu Su to see the Marquis of Wu. After the lending of Jingzhou had been discussed, Lu Su presented the document given him by Liu Bei. “What is the use of such nonsense as this?” said Sun Quan, when he had read it. “There is another letter from General Zhou Yu; and he says that if you will employ his scheme, you can recover Jingzhou,” replied Lu Su. Having read that letter, Sun Quan was more pleased and began to consider who was the best person to send. Suddenly he cried, “I have it; Lu Fan is the man to send.” Sun Quan called Lu Fan and said to him, “I have just heard that Liu Bei has lost his wife. I have a sister whom I should like to marry to him and so make a bond of union between our two houses. Thus we should be united against Cao Cao and in support of the House of Han. You are the one man to be intermediary, and I hope you will go to Jingzhou and see to this.” Under these orders, Lu Fan at once began to prepare his ships for the voyage and soon started."

Now he has a deep look into my village. What should I do to break it?"" Zhou Lang's classmates made a contract, and I would like to go to Jiangdong with a tongue that is not rotten."" Cao Cao was overjoyed and regarded him as a native of Jiujiang. Cao asked: ""How close is Ziyi and Zhou Gongjin?"" Gan said: ""Prime Minister, rest assured. If you work to Jiang Zuo, you must succeed."" Cao asked: ""What do you want to go with?"" Go, the two servants are driving the boat, and the rest is not needed."" Cao was very happy, set up wine and saw Jiang Gan off. Drying the cloth robes of Ge towel, driving a small boat, went straight to Zhou Yu Village, and ordered to report: ""The old friend Jiang Gan is visiting each other."" Zhou Yu was discussing matters in the tent, and when he heard that Gan arrived, he smiled and said to the generals: ""The lobbyist has arrived. !"" Then he whispered with the generals, and so on. All were ordered to go.","‘I’m an old school friend of Zhou Yu. Let me go and see if through friendship I can win him over. I really do think I can.’ The speaker is Jiang Gan, one of Cao Cao’s advisers. ‘You know Zhou Yu?’ asks a surprised Cao Cao. ‘Have no fears,’ says Jiang Gan. ‘I will succeed.’ So it is agreed.","Again Cao Cao found fault with his officers and said, “The other day you lost a battle, and the soldiers were greatly dispirited. Now the enemy have spied out our camp. What can be done?” In eager response to his question one stepped out, saying, “When I was a youth, Zhou Yu and I were fellow students and pledged friends. My three-inch tongue is still good, and I will go over and persuade him to surrender.” Cao Cao, rejoiced to find so speedy a solution, looked at the speaker. It was Jiang Gan of Jiujiang, one of the counseling staff in the camp. “Are you a good friend of Zhou Yu?” said Cao Cao. “Rest content, O Prime Minister,” replied Jiang Gan. “If I only get on the other side of the river, I shall succeed.” “What preparations are necessary?” asked Cao Cao. “Just a youth as my servant and a couple of rowers; nothing else.” Cao Cao offered him wine, wished him success, and sent him on his way. Clad in a simple white robe and seated in his little craft, the messenger reached Zhou Yu's camp and bade the guards say that an old friend Jiang Gan wished to see him. The commander was in his tent at a council when the message came, and he laughed as he said to those about him, “A persuader is coming.” Then he whispered certain instructions in the ear of each one of them, and they went out to await his arrival. Zhou Yu received his friend in full ceremonial garb."

却說袁紹先使探馬看時，回報麴義斬將搴旗，追趕敗兵；因此不作準備，與田豐引着帳下持戟軍士數百人，弓箭手數十騎，乘馬出觀，呵呵大笑曰：“公孫瓚無能之輩！”正說之間，忽見趙雲衝到面前。弓箭手急待射時，雲連刺數人，衆軍皆走。後面瓚軍團團圍裹上來。田豐慌對紹曰：“主公且於空牆中躲避！”紹以兜鍪撲地，大呼曰：“大丈夫願臨陣鬥死，豈可入牆而望活乎！”衆軍士齊心死戰，趙雲衝突不入，紹兵大隊掩至，顏良亦引軍來到，兩路并殺。趙雲保公孫瓚殺透重圍，回到界橋。紹驅兵大進，復趕過橋，落水死者，不計其數。袁紹當先趕來，不到五里，只聽得山背後喊聲大起，閃出一彪人馬，為首三員大將，乃是劉玄德、關雲長、張翼德——因在平原探知公孫瓚與袁紹相爭，特來助戰。當下三匹馬，三般兵器，飛奔前來，直取袁紹。紹驚得魂飛天外，手中寶刀墜於馬下，忙撥馬而逃，衆人死救過橋。公孫瓚亦收軍歸寨。玄德、關、張動問畢，瓚曰：“若非玄德遠來救我，幾乎狼狽。”敎與趙雲相見。玄德甚相敬愛，便有不捨之心。,"However, Yuan Shao said that when Yuan Shao first visited the horse, he reported to Qu Yi that he beheaded the generals and held the flag and chased down the defeated soldiers. Therefore, he did not make any preparations, and led hundreds of soldiers with halberds and dozens of archers under the tent, and they rode out on horses to watch, hehe. He laughed loudly and said, ""Gongsun Zan is incompetent!"" Just as he was talking, he suddenly saw Zhao Yun rushing in front of him. When the archers were eager to shoot, Yun Lian stabbed several people and all the troops left. The Zan Legion was wrapped up behind. Tian Feng panicked and said to Shao: ""My lord, hide in the empty wall!"" Shao threw himself on the ground and shouted, ""My lord is willing to fight to the death, how can you enter the wall and hope to live!"" If they did not enter, Shao's brigade covered up, and Yan Liang also led his troops to kill them. Zhao Yunbao defeated Gongsun Zan and returned to Jieqiao. Shao drove his troops forward, and then rushed across the bridge, and there were countless people who fell into the water and died. Yuan Shao came first, less than five miles away, only to hear loud shouts from behind the mountain, and a troop flashed out. The three generals at the head were Liu Xuande, Guan Yunchang, and Zhang Yide - because they found out that Gongsun Zan and Yuan Shao were fighting in the plain. , came to help. At the moment, three horses and three kinds of weapons rushed forward and took Yuan Shao directly. Shao was so shocked that his soul flew out of the sky, the treasured sword in his hand fell under the horse, and he hurriedly drove the horse and fled, and everyone rescued him across the bridge. Gongsun Zan also withdrew his army and returned to the village. After Xuande, Guan, and Zhang Dong asked questions, Zan said, ""If Xuande hadn't come to save me, I would have been in trouble."" They met Zhao Yun. Xuande respects and loves each other very much, and he is reluctant to give up.","Emboldened by this, Yuan Shao’s infantry attack, cutting down the banner and forcing Gongsun Zan to abandon the bridge. Had it not been for Zhao Zilong once again coming to his defence and killing the attacking general, all would have been lost for Gongsun Zan. Fired up by this, Zhao Zilong singlehandedly launches a counter-attack, slashing his way through the troops of Yuan Shao. He is soon joined by Gongsun and his men. They drive in close to where Yuan Shao is fighting and nearly break through. But Yuan Shao rallies his troops and turns the tide of the battle once again, forcing Gongsun to retreat. Just as Yuan Shao feels confident of final victory, a great cry is heard and into the fray, as if from nowhere, rushes Xuande, Zhang Fei and Guan Yu, leading their men. Yuan Shao drops his sword in fright and only just makes it back to the safety of his own camp. He loses many men who die in the river or in the counter-attack of Gongsun’s troops. Back at Gongsun’s camp, the three brothers-in-arms meet Zhao Zilong for the first time, and Xuande and Zilong swiftly become the firmest of friends.","From the scouts sent to find out how the battle went, Yuan Shao heard the good news of Qu Yi's success in slaying the standard bearer, capturing the flag, and his pursuit. So Yuan Shao took no further care but rode out with his General Tian Feng and a few guards to look on at the enemy and enjoy his victory. “Ha ha!” Yuan Shao laughed. “Gongsun Zan is an incapable.” But even as Yuan Shao spoke, he saw in front the redoubtable Zhao Yun. His guards hastened to prepare their bows, but before they could shoot, Zhao Yun was in their midst, and men were falling before him wherever he went. The others fled. Gongsun Zan's army then gathered round and hemmed in Yuan Shao. Tian Feng then said to his master, “Sir, take refuge in this empty building here.” But Yuan Shao dashed his helmet to the ground, crying “The brave man rather faces death in the battle than seeks safety behind a wall!” This bold speech gave new courage to his soldiers who now fought fiercely and with such success that Zhao Yun could nowhere force his way in. Yuan Shao was soon reinforced by the arrival of his main body and Yan Liang, and the two armies pressed forward. Zhao Yun could only just get Gongsun Zan safe out of the press. Then they fought their way back to the bridge. But Yuan Shao's troops still came on and fought their way across the bridge, forcing multitudes of their adversaries into the water, where many were drowned. Yuan Shao was leading in person and his troops still advanced. But not more than two miles, for soon a great shouting was heard behind some hills, whence suddenly burst out a body of troops led by Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei. At Pingyuan they had heard of the struggle between their protector and his enemy, Yuan Shao, and had at once set out to help. Now the three riders, each with his peculiar weapon, flew straight at Yuan Shao, who was so frightened that his soul seemed to leave his body and fly beyond the confines of heaven. His sword fell from his hand and he fled for his life. He was chased across the bridge when Gongsun Zan called in his army and they returned to camp. After the usual greetings Gongsun Zan said, “If you had not come to our help, we should have been in very bad case.” Liu Bei and Zhao Yun were made acquainted with each other, and a warm affection sprang up from the very first so that they were always together."

In the middle of the night, Quan Wen asked Su and said, ""Fang now the Han family is in danger, and the four corners are in turmoil. I am alone in my father's and brother's spare time, and I think about the affairs of Huan and Wen. How can you teach me?"" Those who win will harm Xiang Yu. Today's Cao Cao is comparable to Xiang Yu. How can the generals be Huan and Wen? Su stealing materials cannot be revived, and Cao Cao cannot be killed. As a general's plan, only Ding foot Jiangdong to watch the world's provocations. Today, I will take the north to do a lot of work, slaughter Huangzu, and attack Liu Biao, and hold it as far as the Yangtze River. Then I will establish the title of emperor, in order to plan the world: this is the work of the emperor."" Quan was overjoyed when he heard the words, and he put on his clothes and thanked him; the next day He gave Lu Su a generous gift, and gave clothes and tents to Su's mother. Su also recommended a person to see Sun Quan: this man is erudite and talented, and he is filial to his mother. The right to worship him as a guest. Jin advised Quan not to communicate with Yuan Shao, but to obey Cao Cao, and then take advantage of him. Quan Yi said, but Chen Zhenhui left Chen Zhenhui to kill Yuan Shao with a book.","One night Sun Quan and Lu Su are deep in discussion. ‘When I look around me,’ says Sun Quan, ‘I see the Han are on the brink of complete collapse. I would love to be the one, like the heroes of old, who protects and restores the dynasty. What do you suggest I do?’ To this Lu Su replies, ‘The Han’s time is over. Cao Cao is in control. You need to strengthen your hold on the south until you can move out and take over the rest of the country. You must plan to create a new dynasty – your own!’ These words excite and delight Sun Quan. Another adviser joins the court – Zhuge Jin. Following his advice, Sun Quan turns down Yuan Shao’s suggestion of an alliance against Cao Cao.","One day at the close of the usual reception, Sun Quan kept Lu Su to dine with him. They sat up late and by and by slept on the same couch as would the closest of friends. In the dead of night Sun Quan said to his bedfellow, “The dynasty is failing, and everything is at sixes and sevens. I have received a great charge from my father and brother, and I am thinking of imitating the actions of the celebrated Protectors of Reign, Wen and Huan, and becoming the leader of the feudal lords, and I pray you instruct me.” Lu Su replied, “Of old the Founder of Han, the Supreme Ancestor, wished to honor and serve Emperor Yi of Qin, but could not on account of Xiang Yu's evildoings. Now Cao Cao can be compared with Xiang Yu; how can you be the protector of the Emperor? My humble opinion is that the Hans have fallen beyond hope of recovery and Cao Cao cannot be destroyed, and that the only key to your big schemes is to secure your present position in order to keep the master hand and control the combinations among the others. Now take advantage of the turmoil in the north to smite Huang Zu and attack Liu Biao in Jingzhou. Thereby you will command the whole length of the Great River. Then you may consolidate the empire and become the Son of Heaven. This was how the Supreme Ancestor acted.” Hearing this Sun Quan was very greatly pleased. He threw on some clothing, got up, and thanked his newly-found adviser. Next day Sun Quan gave Lu Su costly gifts and sent robes and silks to his mother. Lu Su then recommended a friend of his to Sun Quan's notice, a man of wide reading and great ability. He was also a filial son. His name was Zhuge Jin, and he came from Nanyang. Sun Quan treated Zhuge Jin as a superior guest. This man dissuaded Sun Quan from making common cause with Yuan Shao, but advised him rather to favor Cao Cao, against whom he could plan when occasion served. Sun Quan therefore sent back the messenger Chen Zhen with dispatches that broke off all negotiations."

却說袁熙、袁尚至遼東，二人密議曰：“遼東軍兵數萬，足可與曹操爭衡。今暫投之，後當殺公孫康而奪其地，養成氣力而抗中原，可復河北也。”商議已定，乃入見公孫康。康留於館驛，只推有病，不卽相見。不一日，細作回報：“曹操兵屯易州，並無下遼東之意。”公孫康大喜，乃先伏刀斧手於壁衣中，使二袁入。相見禮畢，命坐。時天氣嚴寒，尚見牀榻上無裀褥，謂康曰：“願鋪坐席。”康瞋目言曰：“汝二人之頭，將行萬里！何席之有？”尚大驚。康叱曰：“左右何不下手！”刀斧手擁出，就坐席上砍下二人之頭，用木匣盛貯，使人送到易州，來見曹操。時操在易州，按兵不動。夏侯惇、張遼入稟曰：“如不下遼東，可回許都：恐劉表生心。”操曰：“待二袁首級至，卽便回兵。”衆皆暗笑。忽報遼東公孫康遣人送袁熙、袁尚首級至，衆皆大驚。使者呈上書信。操大笑曰：“不出奉孝之料！”重賞來使，封公孫康為襄平侯左將軍。衆官問曰：“何為不出奉孝之所料？”操遂出郭嘉書以示之。書略曰：,"But they said that Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang went to Liaodong, and the two secretly discussed: ""The Liaodong army has tens of thousands of troops, which is enough to compete with Cao Cao. Now I will temporarily surrender, and later I will kill Gongsun Kang and seize the land, develop the strength to resist the Central Plains, and then recover. Hebei, too."" After the discussion was settled, he went to see Gongsun Kang. Kang stayed in Guanyi, only to be ill, not to meet. A few days later, he made a detailed report: ""Cao Cao's troops are stationed in Yizhou, and there is no intention to go to Liaodong."" After the ceremony is over, I order to sit down. At that time, the weather was extremely cold, and there was no blanket on the bed, so he said to Kang, ""I would like to have a seat."" Kang said with anger: ""The head of the two of you will travel thousands of miles! What seat is there?"" He was shocked. Kang said, ""Why don't you strike from the left and right?"" The swordsman and axe came out, and he chopped off the heads of the two of them on the seat, stored them in wooden boxes, and sent them to Yizhou to see Cao Cao. Shi Cao was in Yizhou and kept his troops on hold. Xiahou Dun and Zhang Liao reported: ""If you don't go to Liaodong, you can go back to Xudu: I'm afraid Liu Biao will have a heart."" Cao said: ""When the second Yuan's head reaches the level, you will return to the army."" Everyone laughed secretly. Suddenly it was reported that Gongsun Kang of Liaodong had sent people to send Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang's heads there, and everyone was shocked. The messenger presents the letter. Cao laughed loudly and said, ""I don't expect to be filial piety!"" The officials asked, ""Why didn't you expect filial piety?"" Cao then issued Guo Jiashu to show it. The book says:","Meanwhile the two Yuan brothers have taken refuge even further into this strange land and have come to the prefect of Liaodong for sanctuary. He, alarmed at the thought of becoming Cao Cao’s enemy, has the two brothers murdered and their heads sent to Cao Cao.","In the meantime, Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang had taken counsel together as they approached Liaodong, saying, “Liaodong has a large army strong enough to oppose Cao Cao. We will go thither and submit till we can slay the Governor and take possession. Then when we are strong enough, we will attack and recover our own land.” With these intentions they went into the city. They were received and lodged in the guests' quarters; but when they wished to see Gongsun Kang, he put them off with the excuse of indisposition. However, before many days the spies returned with the news that Cao Cao's army was quiescent and there was no hint of any attack. Then Gongsun Kang called Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang into his presence. But before they came he hid swordsmen and ax-men behind the arras in the hall. When the visitors came and had made their salutations, Gongsun Kang bade them be seated. Now it was bitterly cold and on the couches where they were sitting were no coverings. So Yuan Shang said, “May we have cushions?” The host said, “When your heads take that long, long journey, will there be any cushions?” Before Yuan Shang could recover from his fright, Gongsun Kang shouted, “Why do you not begin?” At this out rushed the assassins and the heads of the two brothers were cut off as they sat. Packed in a small wooden box they were sent to Cao Cao at Yizhou. All this time Cao Cao had been calmly waiting. His impatient officers had petitioned in a body, saying, “Let's march to the capital to ward off Liu Biao's threat if we are not going to attack the east.” Cao Cao said, “I am waiting for the heads of the enemy. We will go as soon as the heads arrive.” In their secret hearts they laughed. But then, surely enough, messenger soon came from Liaodong bringing the heads. Then they were greatly surprised; and when the messenger presented Gongsun Kang's letters, Cao Cao cried, “Just as Guo Jia said!” He amply rewarded the messenger, and the Governor of Liaodong was made Lord of Xiangping and General of the Left Army. When the officers asked what had happened, Cao Cao told them what the late adviser had predicted. He read to them the dead officer's testament, which ran something like this:"

審配旣死，操憐其忠義，命葬於城北。衆將請曹操入城。操方欲起行，只見刀斧手擁一人至，操視之，乃陳琳也。操謂之曰：“汝前為本初作檄，但罪狀孤，可也；何乃辱及祖、父耶？”琳答曰：“箭在弦上，不得不發耳。”左右勸操殺之；操憐其才，乃赦之，命為從事。,"Shen Pei died, took pity on his loyalty and ordered him to be buried in the north of the city. The generals invited Cao Cao into the city. Cao Fang was about to leave, but saw a man with a knife and axe, and Cao looked at him, it was Chen Lin. Cao said to him, ""You were the first to intercede, but the crime was so unreliable. Why did you insult your ancestor and father?"" Lin replied, ""The arrow is on the string, so I have to let my ears hear."" Persuaded Cao to kill him; His talent is to be forgiven, and his life is to be engaged.",Cao Cao’s eighteen-year-old son Cao Pi is part of the invading army.,"Faithful unto death, he died Gazing toward the lord he'd served. Thus died Shen Pei and from respect for his character Cao Cao ordered that he be buried honorably on the north of the city. The Prime Minister then entered the city of Yejun. As he was starting, he saw the executioners hurrying forward a prisoner who proved to be Chen Lin. “You wrote that manifesto for Yuan Shao. If you had only directed your diatribe against me, it would not have mattered. But why did you shame my forefathers?” said Cao Cao. “When the arrow is on the string, it must fly,” replied Chen Lin. Those about Cao Cao urged him to put Chen Lin to death, but he was spared on account of his genius and given a civil post."
帝一日命人至操營，宣操入宮議事。操聞天使至，請入相見。只見那人眉淸目秀，精神充足。操暗想曰：“今東都大荒，官僚軍民，皆有飢色，此人何得獨肥？”因問之曰：“公尊顏充腴，以何調理而至此？”對曰：“某無他法，只食淡三十年矣。”操乃頷之；又問曰：“君居何職？”對曰：“某舉孝廉。原為袁紹、張楊從事。今聞天子還都，特來朝覲，官封正議郎。濟陰定陶人：姓董，名昭，字公仁。”曹操避席曰：“聞名久矣！幸得於此相見。”遂置酒帳中相待，令與荀彧相會。忽人報曰：“一隊軍往東而去，不知何人。”操急令人探之。董昭曰：“此乃李傕舊將楊奉，與白波帥韓暹，因明公來此，故引兵欲投大梁去耳。”操曰：“莫非疑操乎？”昭曰：“此乃無謀之輩，明公何足慮也？”操又曰：“李、郭二賊此去若何？”昭曰：“虎無爪，鳥無翼，不久當為明公所擒，無足介意。”,"One day the emperor ordered people to the Cao camp, and Xuan Cao entered the palace to discuss matters. I heard that the angel is coming, please come and meet. I saw that the man was full of energy. Cao thought to himself, ""Today the Eastern Capital is in a great famine, and the bureaucrats, soldiers and people are all starving. How can this person be fat?"" He asked him, ""Your Majesty's face is full, so what is the reason for this?"" He replied, ""A certain There is no other way, I have only eaten lightly for 30 years."" Cao nodded and asked, ""What position do you hold?"" He replied, ""A certain act of filial piety and integrity. It was originally done by Yuan Shao and Zhang Yang. Now I hear that the emperor is still the capital. I came here specially for the pilgrimage, and the official title is Zheng Yilang. Jiyin Dingtao people: surnamed Dong, famous name, styled Gongren."" Cao Cao avoided the banquet and said: ""Famous for a long time! I am fortunate to meet here."" Treat each other and make Xun Yu meet. Suddenly people reported: ""A group of troops is heading east, and I don't know who it is."" Dong Zhao said: ""This is Li Jue's old general Yang Feng, and Bai Bo's commander Han Xian, because Duke Ming came here, so he led his troops to Daliang."" Cao said: ""Do you doubt Cao?"" Zhao said: ""This is You are a man without a plan, so what does Duke Ming have to worry about?"" Cao added, ""What will happen to the two thieves Li and Guo?"" Zhao said, ""Tigers have no claws, birds have no wings, and they will soon be captured by Duke Ming, so I don't care. .""","Once Cao Cao has settled into quarters in the capital the emperor sends a messenger called Dong Zhao to summon Cao Cao. Cao Cao is impressed by his forthrightness and vigour. For example, he sees that Dong Zhao looks well fed, whereas the others in the city look half starved. ‘How come you look so fit and well?’ asks Cao Cao. ‘This is simply the fruits of a simple lifestyle,’ he replies. ‘I’ve been a soldier for thirty years. You learn a thing or two.’ It is Dong Zhao who suggests to Cao Cao that the emperor be moved to Xuchang in order that only Cao Cao will be in control, squeezing out others such as Yang Feng, who fear Cao Cao.","So they represented to the Emperor that they wished to pursue the rebels, and under this excuse withdrew their army and camped at Daliang. One day the Emperor sent to summon Cao Cao to audience. The messenger was called in. Cao Cao noticed that the messenger looked remarkably well and could not understand it seeing that everyone else looked hungry and famine stricken. So Cao Cao said, “You look plump and well, Sir, how do you manage it?” “Only this; I have lived meager for thirty years.” Cao Cao nodded, “What office do you hold?” “I am a graduate recommended for filial piety and honesty. I had offices under Yuan Shao and Zhang Yang, but came here when the Emperor returned. Now I am one of the secretaries. I am a native of Dingtao, and my name is Dong Zhao.” Cao Cao got up from his place and crossed over, saying, “I have heard of you. How happy I am to meet you!” Then wine was brought into the tent, and Xun Yu was called in and introduced. While they were talking, a man came in to report that a party was moving eastward. Cao Cao ordered to find out whose people these were, but Dong Zhao knew at once. “They are old leaders under the rebels, Yang Feng and the White Wave General Han Xian. They are running off because you have come, Illustrious Sir!” “Do they mistrust me?” said Cao Cao. “They are not worthy of your attention. They are a poor lot.” “What of this departure of Li Jue and Guo Si?” “Tigers without claws, birds without wings—they will not escape you very long. They are not worth thinking about.”"
操見前軍停馬不進，問是何故。回報曰：“前面山僻路小，因早晨下雨，坑塹內積水不流，泥陷馬蹄，不能前進。”操大怒，叱曰：“軍旅逢山開路，遇水疊橋，豈有泥濘不堪行之理！”傳下號令，敎老弱中傷軍士在後慢行，強壯者擔土束柴，搬草運蘆，填塞道路，務要卽時行動；如違令者斬。衆軍只得都下馬，就路旁砍伐竹木，填塞山路。操恐後軍來趕，令張遼、許褚、徐晃引百騎執刀在手，但遲慢者便斬之。此時軍已餓乏，衆皆倒地，操喝令人馬踐踏而行，死者不可勝數。號哭之聲，於路不絕。操怒曰：“生死有命，何哭之有！如再哭者立斬！”三停人馬：一停落後，一停填了溝壑，一停跟隨曹操。過了險峻，路稍平坦。操回顧止有三百餘騎隨後，並無衣甲袍鎧整齊者。操在馬上揚鞭大笑。衆將問：“丞相何又大笑？”操曰：“人皆言周瑜、諸葛亮足智多謀，以吾觀之，到底是無能之輩。若使此處伏一旅之師，吾等皆束手受縛矣。”,"Cao Cao saw that the former army stopped horses and did not enter, and asked why. In return, he said, ""The road in front of the mountain is small. Because of the rain in the morning, the water in the pits did not flow, and the mud trapped the horse's hoofs, making it impossible to move forward."" The mud is unbearable!"" An order was passed, instructing the old, weak and slanderous sergeants to walk slowly in the back, while the strong carry the soil and firewood, carry grass and reeds, and fill the roads. Be sure to act immediately; All the troops had to dismount and cut bamboo and wood by the roadside to fill up the mountain road. Cao Cao was afraid that the army would come, so Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, and Xu Huang led a hundred cavalry to hold swords in their hands, but those who were slow would be killed. At this time, the army was starving, and everyone fell to the ground, and the horses trampled them on the ground, and the dead were innumerable. The sound of crying is endless on the road. Cao said angrily: ""Life and death have fate, why cry! If you cry again, you will be killed!"" After the steep, the road is slightly smoother. Cao looked back and there were more than 300 cavalry after him, and there was no one with neat robes and robes. Fuck right off the whip and laugh. The generals asked, ""Why is the prime minister laughing again?"" Cao said, ""Everyone says that Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang are resourceful and resourceful, but in my opinion, they are incompetent. bound.""","Suddenly all movement stops, and when Cao Cao enquires why, he is told that the path is overgrown and narrow and the horses have become stuck in the thick mud caused by the torrential rain. Furious, Cao Cao lambasts his men. ‘Leave the old, feeble and sick to fend for themselves. The rest of you cover the mud with branches and undergrowth so we can get through. We go on regardless. Anyone who complains or disobeys will be executed!’ So, grudgingly, the soldiers cut branches and start to cover the mud, while Cao Cao orders a hundred of the remaining horsemen to patrol, ready to execute anyone who does not obey. When they are ready, Cao Cao urges them on, even though this means trampling upon not just the branches but upon the bodies of the fallen. So many are dying, and the air is rent by cries of distress of the survivors. Cao Cao rages against them, shouting, ‘The Will of Heaven decides life or death. So why are you crying? The next one to do so will be killed!’ The men have divided into three by now; one third stagger on as best they can; one third work to cover the mud and clear the path; and one third escort Cao Cao. By the time they get past the worst of the mud, Cao Cao has only got about three hundred soldiers left. Despite pleas to stop and rest, Cao Cao insists they press on. Suddenly Cao Cao laughs out loud again and on being questioned by his anxious men says, ‘So Zhou Yu and Kong Ming are supposed to be brilliant plotters! But they’ve failed to set a trap here, where we would have no option but to surrender!’","Noticing that the leading party had stopped, Cao Cao sent to ask the reason. The messenger returned, saying, “The rain water collected in the pits makes the ground a mire, and the horses cannot not move.” Cao Cao raged. He said, “When soldiers come to hills, they cut a road, when they happen upon streams, they bridge them; such a thing as mud cannot stay an army.” So he ordered the weak and wounded to go to the rear and come on as they could, while the robust and able were to cut down trees, and gather herbage and reeds to fill up the holes. And it was to be done without delay, or death would be the punishment of the disobedient or remiss. So the soldiers dismounted and felled trees and cut bamboos, and they leveled the road. And because of the imminence and fear of pursuit, a party of one hundred under Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, and Xu Huang was told off to hasten the workers and slay any that idled. The soldiers made their way along the shallower parts, but many fell, and cries of misery were heard the whole length of the way. “What are you howling for?” cried Cao Cao. “The number of your days is fixed by fate. Any one who howls shall be put to death.” The remnant of the army, now divided into three, one to march slowly, a second to fill up the waterways and hollows, and a third to escort Cao Cao, gradually made its way over the precipitous road. When the going improved a little and the path was moderately level, Cao Cao turned to look at his following and saw he had barely three hundred soldiers. And these lacked clothing and armor and were tattered and disordered. But he pressed on, and when the officers told him the horses were quite spent and must rest , he replied, “Press on to Jingzhou and there we shall find repose.” So they pressed on. But they had gone only one or two miles when Cao Cao flourished his whip and broke once again into loud laughter. “What is there to laugh at?” asked the officers. “People say those two, Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang, are able and crafty; I do not see it. They are a couple of incapables."
玄德寫罷，遞與諸葛均收了，拜辭出門。均送出，玄德再三慇懃致意而別。方上馬欲行，忽見童子招手籬外，叫曰：“老先生來也。”玄德視之，見小橋之西，一人煖帽遮頭，狐裘蔽體，騎着一驢，後隨一靑衣小童，攜一葫蘆酒，踏雪而來；轉過小橋，口吟詩一首。詩曰：,"After Xuande finished writing, he handed it over to Zhuge Jun, took it, and said goodbye to go out. All were sent out, and Xuande greeted them again and again and said goodbye. Fang mounted the horse and was about to go, when he suddenly saw the boy beckoning outside the fence, and called, ""Old gentleman is here."" Xuande looked at him and saw to the west of the small bridge, a man with a warm hat covering his head, a fox fur covering his body, riding a donkey, and then Followed by a little boy in robes, brought a gourd wine, and came on the snow; turned around the small bridge, and recited a poem. The poem says:","So now you’re seeking Kong Ming, hoping to persuade him to reform and repair time and the very seasons. You’re probably even hoping that he’s going to rebalance the universe! But you have to be aware that this is not possible, and to try to do so will just wear you out. As you know, those who go with the flow of Heaven will find all works well for them.","The letter written and given to Zhuge Jun, Liu Bei took his leave, exceedingly disappointed at this second failure. As he was mounting, he saw the serving lad waving his hand outside the hedge and heard him call out, “The old Master is coming.” Liu Bei looked and then saw a figure seated on a donkey leisurely jogging along over a bridge. The rider of the donkey wore a cap with long flaps down to his shoulders, and his body was wrapped in a fox fur robe. A youth followed him bearing a jar of wine. As he came through the snow he hummed a song:"

After saying goodbye and leaving the camp, he drove the boat again and returned to Jiangdong to see Huang Gai and talk about the past in detail. Gai said: ""If the public is not able to argue, then Gai's disciples will suffer."" Ze said: ""I will go to Ganning Village now to find out about Caizhong and Caihe."" Gai said: ""Very good."" Ze went to Ningzhai, Ning access. Ze said: ""The general was humiliated by Zhou Gongjin yesterday in order to save Huang Gongfu. I am very injustice."" Ning smiled but did not answer. In the middle of the story, Cai He and Cai Zhongzhi. Ze Yi watched Gan Ning, Ning understood, and said: ""Zhou Gongjin only relies on his own abilities, and does not think of me at all. I am being humiliated and shamed to see the Jiang Zuo people!"" After speaking, he gritted his teeth and shouted at the table. Ze Naixu and Ning whispered in their ears. Ning bowed his head and said nothing, sighing a few times. Cai He and Cai Zhong saw that Ze and Ning both had objections, and they challenged them with words: ""Why is the general so troubled? What is the injustice, sir?"" Ze said: ""How do you know the pain in our belly!"" Cai He said ""Could it be that you want to turn your back on Wu and vote for Cao Ye?"" Kan Ze paled. Gan Ning stood up with his sword drawn and said, ""My affairs have been discovered, so I must kill them to silence them!"" Cai He and Cai Zhong panicked and said, ""Second Master, don't worry. Said: ""You can tell me quickly!"" Cai He said, ""The two of us are the ministers of Cao who came to deceive them. If the two men have the heart to surrender, I should bring them in."" Ning said, ""Do you really say anything?"" They said in unison: ""An dare to deceive each other?"" Ning pretended to be happy and said: ""If this is the case, it is a gift from God!"" Er Cai said: ""Huang Gongfu and the general were insulted, I have reported to the Prime Minister."" Ze. Said: ""I have already presented a book to the Prime Minister for Duke Huang, and I have come to see Xingba today, and we will make an appointment with him."" Ning said, ""When you meet the Lord of Ming, you should agree with each other."" So the four of them drank together and discussed the same thing. mind. The second Cai Youshi wrote a book, secretly reporting to Cao Cao, saying that Gan Ning was the same as a certain. Kan Ze studied another book by himself, and sent someone to report to Cao Cao in secret. In the book, it is stated that Huang Gai wants to come, but it is not convenient; but if you see that the boat's bow is coming with a fangtooth flag, it is also.","Reluctantly he agrees and sails back down the river. He informs Huang Gai of his success thus far and then goes to see Gan Ning in order to find out what the two Cais are up to. Arriving at Gan Ning’s tent, Kan Ze says, ‘I was appalled to see how you were insulted yesterday by Zhou Yu simply because you wanted to protect Huang Gai.’ Gan Ning smiles but says nothing, and almost immediately the two Cais enter. Kan Ze flicks a look at Gan Ning, who catches the significance of this and explodes with righteous anger, saying, ‘Zhou Yu’s far too cocky and has no regard for others. He humiliated me, disgraced me in front of my peers.’ And with that he grits his teeth, smashes his fist down on the table and roars with fury. In an apparent act of co-conspiracy, Kan Ze bends down and whispers in Gan Ning’s ear. Sensing momentous events are afoot, the two Cais ask, ‘General, what’s so upset you? And you, sir, what’s this insult you have suffered?’ ‘You cannot even guess how bitter we are,’ says Kan Ze, to which Cai He responds, ‘Is it possible you want to leave Sun Quan and come over to Cao Cao?’ Hearing this, Kan Ze visibly pales, and Gan Ning rises up, draws his sword and in feigned horror shouts, ‘We’re discovered. We must kill them or we’ll be betrayed.’ Greatly alarmed, the two Cais rapidly reassure them, saying, ‘There’s nothing to fear here. In fact, we have something to tell you.’ Gan Ning looks at them sternly and asks, ‘Well, what is it?’ to which Cai He confesses that they are in fact spies sent by Cao Cao and that if they would like to come over to his side they would be only too happy to make the arrangements. ‘Is this true?’ asks Gan Ning, to which the Cais reply, ‘Are we likely to invent something like this?’ ‘Heaven has indeed sent you,’ says an apparently grateful Gan Ning. To this the Cais reply that the plight of both Huang Gai and Gan Ning has already been communicated to Cao Cao. Kan Ze tells how he has delivered a letter of surrender to Cao Cao from Huang Gai and that he is here today to try to persuade Gan Ning to desert as well. The con is completed by Gan Ning proclaiming, ‘If a man of decisive action meets a truly wise lord he should offer himself to him without hesitation.’ Greatly encouraged by this, the four of them drink to the success of their decisions. Immediately afterwards the two Cais write to Cao Cao to tell him of this great news while Kan Ze also writes secretly to Cao Cao, saying that Huang Gai will now desert and that he will sail across in a boat with a green flag in its prow.","Cao Cao offered him gold and silks, which were refused. Kan Ze started, left the camp, and reembarked for the south bank, where he related all that had happened to Huang Gai. “If it had not been for your persuasive tongue, then had I undergone this suffering in vain,” said Huang Gai. “I will now go to get news of the two Cai brothers,” said Kan Ze. “Excellent,” said Huang Gai. Kan Ze went to the camp commanded by Gan Ning; and when they were seated, Kan Ze said to his host, “I was much distressed when I saw how disgracefully you were treated for your intercession on behalf of Huang Gai.” Gan Ning smiled. Just then the two Cai brothers came, and host and guest exchanged glances. Gan Ning said, “The truth is Zhou Yu is over confident, and he reckons us as nobody. We count for nothing. Every one is talking of the way I was insulted.” And he shouted and gritted his teeth and smacked the table in his wrath. Kan Ze leaned over toward his host and said something in a very low voice, at which Gan Ning bent his head and sighed. Cai He and Cai Zhong gathered from this scene that both Gan Ning and Kan Ze were ripe for desertion and determined to probe them. “Why, Sir, do you anger him? Why not be silent about your injuries?” said they. “What know you of our bitterness?” said Kan Ze. “We think you seem much inclined to go over to Cao Cao,” said they. Kan Ze at this lost color; Gan Ning started up and drew his sword, crying, “They have found out; they must die to keep their mouths shut.” “No, no,” cried the two in a flurry. “Let us tell you something quite secret.” “Quick, then,” cried Gan Ning. So Cai He said, “The truth is that we are only pretended deserters, and if you two gentlemen are of our way of thinking, we can manage things for you.” “But are you speaking the truth?” said Gan Ning. “Is it likely we should say such a thing if it were untrue?” cried both at the same moment. Gan Ning put on a pleased look and said, “Then this is the very heaven-given chance.” “You know we have already told Cao Cao of the Huang Gai affair and how you were insulted.” “The fact is I have given the Prime Minister a letter on behalf of Huang Gai, and he sent me back again to settle the date of Huang Gai's desertion,” said Kan Ze. “When an honest person happens upon an enlightened master, his heart will always be drawn toward him,” said Gan Ning. The four then drank together and opened their hearts to each other. The two Cai Zhong and Cai He wrote a private letter to their master saying Gan Ning has agreed to join in our plot and play the traitor, and Kan Ze also wrote and they sent the letters secretly to Cao Cao. Kan Ze's letter said: “Huang Gai has found no opportunity so far. However, when he comes, his boat can be recognized by a black, indented flag."

却說曹操聞孫策已死，欲起兵下江南。侍御史張紘諫曰：“乘人之喪而伐之，旣非義舉；若其不克，棄好成讎；不如因而善遇之。”操然其說，乃卽奏封孫權為將軍，兼領會稽太守；卽令張紘為會稽都尉，齎印往江東。孫權大喜，又得張紘回吳，卽命與張昭同理政事。張紘又薦一人於孫權：此人姓顧，名雍，子元歎，乃中郎蔡邕之徒；其為人少言語，不飲酒，嚴厲正大。權以為丞，行太守事。自是孫權威震江東，深得民心。,"But he said that Cao Cao heard that Sun Ce was dead and wanted to raise troops to the south of the Yangtze River. The Imperial Servant Zhang Hong remonstrated: ""It is unrighteous to take advantage of people's mourning to cut them down; if they are incapable of doing so, abandon them and turn them into a scorpion; it is better to deal with them well."" , and also to understand the prefect of Kuaiji; he ordered Zhang Hong to be the prefect of Kuaiji and sent his seal to Jiangdong. Sun Quan was overjoyed, and Zhang Hong was asked to return to Wu, and he ordered Zhang Zhao to manage political affairs together. Zhang Hong also recommended a person to Sun Quan: this person was surnamed Gu, his name was Yong, Zi Yuantan, and he was a disciple of Zhonglang Cai Yong; Quan thought that he was the prime minister and acted as a prefect. Since Sun Quanwei shook the east of the Yangtze River, he won the hearts of the people.","Following his advice, Sun Quan turns down Yuan Shao’s suggestion of an alliance against Cao Cao.","Hearing of Sun Ce's death, Cao Cao was for sending an expedition against the south. But Zhang Hong dissuaded him, saying, “It would be mean to take advantage of the period of mourning. And if you should not overcome him, you will make him an enemy instead of being a friend. It would be preferable to treat him generously.” So Cao Cao memorialized the Throne and obtained for Sun Quan the title of General and Governor of Kuaiji, while Zhang Hong was appointed Commander under Sun Quan. And a seal of office was sent to Sun Quan by Zhang Hong. The new appointment pleased Sun Quan, and he was greatly glad to get Zhang Hong back again. Then Zhang Hong was sent to act jointly with Zhang Zhao in the administration. Zhang Hong was the means of getting another into Sun Quan's service. His friend was Gu Yong, a disciple of the Historian Cai Yong. Gu Yong was a man of few words and an abstainer from wine. He was very correct in all things. Sun Quan appointed Gu Yong Governor Deputy. Henceforward Sun Quan's rule was very prosperous, and he waxed mightily in influence and won the love of all the people."

却說賈詡料知曹操之意，便欲將計就計而行，乃謂張繡曰：“某在城上見曹操遶城而觀者三日。他見城東南角磚土之色，新舊不等，鹿角多半毁壞，意將從此處攻進；却虛去西北上積草，詐為聲勢，欲哄我撤兵守西北，彼乘夜黑必爬東南角而進也。”繡曰：“然則奈何？”詡曰：“此易事耳：來日可令精壯之兵，飽食輕裝，盡藏於東南房屋內；却敎百姓假扮軍士，虛守西北，夜間任他在東南角上爬城。俟其爬進城時，一聲礮響，伏兵齊起，操可擒矣。”繡喜，從其計。早有探馬報曹操，說張繡盡撤兵在西北角上，吶喊守城，東南却甚空虛。操曰：“中吾計矣！”遂命運中密備鍬钁爬城器具。日間只引軍攻西北角。至二更時分，却領精兵於東南角上爬過壕去，砍開鹿角。城中全無動靜，衆軍一齊擁入。只聽得一聲礮響，伏兵四起。曹操急退，背後張繡親驅勇壯殺來。曹軍大敗，退出城外，奔走數十里。張繡直殺至天明方收軍入城。曹操計點敗軍，折兵五萬餘人，失去輜重無數。呂虔、于禁俱各被傷。,"But he said that Jia Xu knew Cao Cao's intentions, so he wanted to take the plan and went ahead with the plan, so he told Zhang Xiu: ""A certain person saw Cao Cao around the city and watched for three days. , most of the antlers are destroyed, and I intend to attack from here; but I falsely went to the northwest to gather grass and deceived me, trying to coax me to withdraw and defend the northwest. Xu said: ""This is an easy task: in the future, you can order the strong and strong soldiers to have enough food and light clothing, and hide them in the houses in the southeast; but the people pretend to be soldiers, guard the northwest, and let him climb the city on the southeast corner at night. When I climbed into the city, there was a sound of a clatter, and the ambush troops rose together, and they were ready to be captured."" Xiu Xiu was happy, and he followed his plan. Cao Cao had already been sent to the horse, saying that Zhang Xiu had withdrawn his troops in the northwest corner, shouting to defend the city, but the southeast was very empty. Cao said: ""I have a plan!"" So fate has secretly prepared shovels and cymbals to climb the city. During the day, the army was only led to attack the northwest corner. At the second watch, he led his elite soldiers to climb over the trench on the southeast corner and cut off the antlers. There was no movement in the city, and all the troops rushed in. There was only a screeching sound, and soldiers were ambushed everywhere. Cao Cao retreated in a hurry, and behind Zhang Xiu personally drove the brave to kill. Cao's army was defeated and retreated from the city, running for dozens of miles. Zhang Xiu killed him until the dawn of the day, when he received his army and entered the city. Cao Cao planned to defeat the army, breaking down more than 50,000 troops and losing countless baggage. Lu Qian and Yu Jin were both injured.","From then on there is a vicious game of cat and mouse as Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao track Cao Cao’s retreating army, attacking whenever they can.","He will try to effect an entrance there. Wherefore he is making a feint attack at the opposite point. He is piling up straw and making ostentatious preparations whereby to cajole us into withdrawing from the real point of attack to defend the northwest. His troops will scale the walls in the darkness and try to enter at the southeast.” “Supposing your surmise correct, what do you advise?” asked Zhang Xiu. “The countermove is plain. You issue an order for our best and bravest soldiers to fill their bellies, to take only the lightest outfit and conceal themselves in the houses near the southeast corner. Then disguise the townspeople as soldiers and send them to pretend to defend the northwest. Tonight we will let the enemy climb up the walls and enter the city and, once they are fairly within, give the signal and the concealed soldiers will rush out upon them. We may even capture Cao Cao himself.” The stratagem was decided upon. Soon the scouts told Cao Cao: “The defenders of the city have moved to the northwest where noisy preparations for defense are going on. The opposite corner is left undefended.” “They have fallen into my trap!” said Cao Cao gleefully. He ordered his troops to prepare shovels and hooks and all the gear needed for scaling walls, and all day they kept up the attack on the northwest angle. But at the second watch they dispatched the veterans to the opposite corner, where they climbed the wall, broke up the fencing barrier, and got into the city apparently without disturbing any of the guards. There was no sign of life anywhere as they entered. But just as they were leaving the wall, suddenly a bomb exploded and they found themselves in an ambush. They turned to retire, but Zhang Xiu immediately fell on the rear and began a slaughter. Cao Cao's troops were totally defeated and fled out of the gate into the country. Zhang Xiu kept up the pursuit till daybreak, when he retired into the city again. Cao Cao then rallied his army and mustered his soldiers. He had lost fifty thousand and much baggage, while two of his generals, Lu Qian and Yu Jin were wounded."

玄德來到莊前，下馬親叩柴門，一童出問，玄德曰：“漢左將軍宜城亭侯領豫州牧皇叔劉備特來拜見先生。”童子曰：“我記不得許多名字。”玄德曰：“你只說劉備來訪。”童子曰：“先生今早少出。”玄德曰：“何處去了？”童子曰：“蹤跡不定，不知何處去了。”玄德曰：“幾時歸？”童子曰：“歸期亦不定，或三五日，或十數日。”玄德惆悵不已。張飛曰：“旣不見，自歸去罷了。”玄德曰：“且待片時。”雲長曰：“不如且歸，再使人來探聽。”玄德從其言，囑付童子：“如先生回，可言劉備拜訪。”,"Xuande came to the front of the village, dismounted his horse and knocked on the door of the wood, and a boy asked, Xuande said: ""Han Zuo general Yicheng Tinghou led Yuzhou Mu Huangshu Liu Bei to visit him."" The boy said, ""I can't remember many names. Xuande said, ""You only said that Liu Bei was visiting."" The boy said, ""Sir, you won't be out this morning."" Xuande said, ""Where are you going?"" Xuande said, ""When will you return?"" The boy said, ""The time of return is not fixed, it may be three or five days, or ten days."" Xuande was melancholy. Zhang Fei said, ""If you don't see me, I'll just go back by myself."" Xuande said, ""Let's wait for a while."" Yun Chang said, ""It's better to go back and ask someone to come and listen."" Xuande followed his words and instructed the boy: ""If you come back, you can say that Liu Bei will visit.""","Humbled, Xuande says, ‘Then just say to the master that Xuande came calling.’","Liu Bei soon arrived at the door of the retreat, dismounted, and knocked at the rough door of the cottage. A youth appeared and asked what he wanted. Liu Bei replied, “I am Liu Bei, General of the Han Dynasty, Lord of Yicheng, Imperial Protector of Yuzhou, and Uncle of the Emperor. I am come to salute the Master.” “I cannot remember so many titles,” said the lad. “Then simply say that Liu Bei has come to inquire after him.” “The Master left this morning early.” “Whither has he gone?” “His movements are very uncertain. I do not know whither he has gone.” “When will he return?” “That also is uncertain. Perhaps in three days, perhaps in ten.” The disappointment was keen. “Let us go back since we cannot see him,” said Zhang Fei. “Wait a little time,” said Liu Bei. “It would be better to return,” said Guan Yu, “then we might send to find out when this man had come back.” So Liu Bei agreed, first saying to the boy, “When the Master returns, tell him that Liu Bei has been here.”"

却說孫策受傷而回，使人尋請華佗醫治。不想華佗已往中原去了，止有徒弟在吳，命其治療。其徒曰：“箭頭有藥，毒已入骨。須靜養百日，方可無虞。若怒氣衝激，其瘡難治。”孫策為人最是性急，恨不得卽日便愈。將息到二十餘日，忽聞張紘有使者自許昌回，策喚問之。使者曰：“曹操甚懼主公；其帳下謀士，亦俱敬服；惟有郭嘉不服。”策曰：“郭嘉曾有何說？”使者不敢言。策怒，固問之。使者只得從實告曰：“郭嘉曾對曹操言：主公不足懼也：輕而無備，性急少謀，乃匹夫之勇耳；他日必死於小人之手。”策聞言，大怒曰：“匹夫安敢料吾！吾誓取許昌！”遂不待瘡愈，便欲商議出兵。張昭諫曰：“醫者戒主公百日休動，今何因一時之忿，自輕萬金之軀？”,"But he said that Sun Ce had returned from an injury, so he asked Hua Tuo to be healed. I didn't want Hua Tuo to go to the Central Plains, so there was only one apprentice in Wu, and he was ordered to be treated. His apprentice said: ""The arrow has medicine, and the poison has penetrated into the bones. You must rest for a hundred days before you can be safe. If you get angry, your sores will be hard to cure."" After about twenty days, I suddenly heard that Zhang Hong had a messenger returning from Xuchang, and he summoned him to ask him. The envoy said: ""Cao Cao is very afraid of the lord; his advisors are also respectful; only Guo Jia is not convinced."" Ce said: ""What did Guo Jia say?"" The envoy did not dare to say anything. Ce anger, solid question. The messenger could only tell the truth: ""Guo Jia once said to Cao Cao that the lord is not afraid: light and unprepared, quick-tempered and less resourceful, he is the brave ear of ordinary people; he will die at the hands of villains one day."" An dare to predict me! I swear to take Xuchang!"" So he did not wait for the sore to heal, so he wanted to discuss sending troops. Zhang Zhao admonished: ""The doctor tells the lord to rest for a hundred days, why is it because of a moment's anger, that he is ignoring his body of ten thousand gold?""","So serious are his wounds that he sends for a renowned healer. He is unable to come but sends his disciple. Because the arrow was tipped with poison he is told he must rest for a hundred days, or the wounds will prove fatal. Now Sun Ce is not a restful man. Far from it. He is always wanting to leap into action and has a terrible temper. For twenty days he manages to rest. Then news comes that Cao Cao has been told by his adviser Guo Jia not to worry about Sun Ce. It is reported that Guo Jia said, ‘He’s foolish, never prepares properly and fails to plan in advance.’ Sun Ce is incensed by this and swears again that he will storm the capital. Rising from his rest, he starts frantically to plan the attack.","Badly wounded, Sun Ce was borne to his home. They sent to call the famous physician Hua Tuo, but he was far away and could not be found. However, a disciple of his came, and the wounded man was committed to his care. “The arrowheads were poisoned,” said the physician, “and the poison has penetrated deep. It will take a hundred days of perfect repose before danger will be past. But if you give way to passion or anger, the wounds will not heal.” Sun Ce's temperament was hasty and impatient, and the prospect of such a slow recovery was very distasteful. However, he remained quiet for some twenty of the hundred days. Then came Zhang Hong from the capital, and Sun Ce insisted on seeing and questioning him. “Cao Cao fears you, my lord, very greatly,” said Zhang Hong, “and his advisers have exceeding respect for you; all except Guo Jia.” “What did Guo Jia say?” asked the sick chieftain. Zhang Hong remained silent, which only irritated his master and caused him to demand to be told. So Zhang Hong had to speak the truth. He said, “The fact is Guo Jia told Cao Cao that he needed not fear you, that you were frivolous and unready, impulsive and shallow, just a stupid swaggerer who would one day come to his death at the hands of some mean person.” This provoked the sick man beyond endurance. “The fool, how dare he say this of me?” cried Sun Ce. “I will take Xuchang from Cao Cao, I swear.” It was no more a question of repose. Ill as he was, he wanted to begin preparations for an expedition at once. They remonstrated with him, reminded him of the physician's orders and urged him to rest. “You are risking your priceless self in a moment's anger,” said Zhang Zhao."
且說孫乾匹馬入冀州見玄德，具言前事。玄德曰：“簡雍亦在此間，可暗請來同議。”少頃，簡雍至，與孫乾相見畢，共議脫身之計。雍曰：“主公明日見袁紹，只說要往荊州，說劉表共破曹操，便可乘機而去。”玄德曰：“此計大妙！但公能隨我去否？”雍曰：“某亦自有脫身之計。”商議已定。次日，玄德入見袁紹，告曰：“劉景升鎮守荊襄九郡，兵精糧足，宜與相約，共攻曹操。”紹曰：“吾嘗遣使約之，奈彼未肯相從。”玄德曰：“此人是備同宗，備往說之，必無推阻。”紹曰：“若得劉表，勝劉辟多矣。”遂命玄德行。紹又曰：“近聞關雲長已離了曹操，欲來河北；吾當殺之，以雪顏良、文醜之恨！”玄德曰：“明公前欲用之，吾故召之。今何又欲殺之耶？且顏良、文醜比之二鹿耳，雲長乃一虎也。失二鹿而得一虎，何恨之有？”紹笑曰：“吾實愛之，故戲言耳。公可再使人召之，令其速來。”玄德曰：“卽遣孫乾往召之可也。”紹大喜從之。玄德出，簡雍進曰：“玄德此去，必不回矣。某願與偕往：一則同說劉表，二則監住玄德。”紹然其言，便命簡雍與玄德同行。郭圖諫紹曰：“劉備前去說劉辟，未見成事；今又使與簡雍同往荊州，必不返矣。”紹曰：“汝勿多疑，簡雍自有見識。”郭圖嗟呀而出。,"Let’s say that Sun Qian’s horse entered Jizhou to see Xuande, and he stated his previous affairs. Xuande said, ""Jian Yong is also here, so you can invite him to discuss it together."" After a while, Jian Yong arrived, and after seeing Sun Qian, they discussed the plan to escape. Yong said: ""My lord sees Yuan Shao tomorrow, and he only said that he wants to go to Jingzhou, and that Liu Biao will destroy Cao Cao together, so he can take the opportunity to leave."" Xuande said: ""This is a great plan! But can you go with me?"" Yong said: ""Someone also has his own plan to escape."" The negotiation has been decided. The next day, Xuande went to see Yuan Shao and told him, ""Liu Jingsheng is guarding the nine counties of Jingxiang, and he has enough troops and food. It is advisable to make an appointment to attack Cao Cao together."" Shao said, ""I tried sending an envoy to make an appointment with him, but Naibei refused to meet him. Follow."" Xuande said: ""This person is prepared for the same sect, and he is prepared to talk about it, so there will be no hindrance."" Shao said: ""If you get Liu Biao, you will be better than Liu Pi."" He then ordered Xuande to act. Shao also said: ""I heard recently that Guan Yunchang has left Cao Cao and wants to come to Hebei; I should kill him because of the hatred of Xue Yanliang and Wen Chou!"" Xuande said: ""Ming Ming wanted to use it before, so I called him. Why now? You want to kill them again? And Yan Liang and Wen Chou have two deer ears, and Yun Chang is a tiger. Losing two deer and getting a tiger, why do you hate it?” Shao smiled and said, “I really love them, so I joke about them. Gong Ke can call him again, and make him come quickly."" Xuande said, ""Send Sun Qian to summon him."" Shao was overjoyed to follow him. When Xuande left, Jian Yongjin said: ""Xuande has gone here, and he will not return. I would like to go with him: one is to talk about Liu Biao, and the other is to imprison Xuande."" Shao Ran said this, and ordered Jianyong to go with Xuande . Guo Tu told Shao: ""Liu Bei went to talk about Liu Pi, but nothing happened; now he and Jian Yong go to Jingzhou, and he will not return."" Shao said: ""Don't be suspicious, Jian Yong has his own knowledge."" Guo Tu sighed. Yeah out.","Calling in his adviser, Jian Yong, Xuande and Sun Qian plot how they can all escape from under Yuan Shao’s nose. It is Jian Yong who comes up with the plan. The heart of the plot is that Xuande will suggest that he go to Jingzhou to consult with Liu Biao. He will propose that Liu Biao join their alliance against Cao Cao. ‘That will help us escape,’ says Xuande, ‘but what about you Jian Yong?’ ‘Don’t worry about me. I’ve my own plans up my sleeve.’ At the meeting with Yuan Shao the following day Xuande suggests that he should go to speak with Liu Biao to see if he will agree to a joint attack on Cao Cao. Yuan Shao agrees, and just as Xuande is leaving says, ‘I gather that Guan Yu has left Cao Cao and is somewhere near here. If he comes I’ll kill him in revenge for the deaths of Yan Liang and Wen Chou.’ Highly alarmed, Xuande tries to reason with him only to be told by Yuan Shao that he is just joking. To complete the plot, Jian Yong comes to Yuan Shao and says he thinks he ought to keep an eye on Xuande. So Yuan Shao gives him permission to depart as his personal spy. Soon Xuande and Guan Yu are reunited.","Guan Ding sent for his two sons to come and make their bow. He put up Guan Yu in his house and provided for his escort in the farm buildings. In the meantime Sun Qian had made his way to Jizhou City and told Liu Bei the whole story. Liu Bei said, “Jian Yong also is here. We will send for him secretly to talk over this matter.” They did so; and when the usual salutes had been exchanged, they three began to consider the means of getting away. “My lord,” said Jian Yong, “you see Yuan Shao personally and say you wish to go to Jingzhou to see Liu Biao about a scheme for the destruction of Cao Cao. That will give an excuse.” “That seems best,” said Liu Bei, “but will you go with me?” “I have another plan to extricate myself,” said Jian Yong. Having settled their plans, Liu Bei soon went in to see his protector and suggested, “Liu Biao is strong and well posted; his help should be sought against our enemy.” “I have sent messengers repeatedly to ask his help,” said Yuan Shao, “but he is unwilling.” “As he and I are of the same family, he will not refuse me if I go and ask him,” said Liu Bei. “Certainly he is worth much more than Liu Pi; you shall go.” “I have just heard,” Yuan Shao continued, “that Guan Yu has left Cao Cao and wants to come here. If he does, I will put him to death out of revenge for my two beloved generals—Yan Liang and Wen Chou.” “Illustrious Sir, you wished to employ him and so I sent for him. Now you threaten to put him to death. The two men he slew were but deers compared with such a tiger as he is. When you exchange a couple of deers for a tiger, you need not complain of the bargain.” “Really I like him,” said Yuan Shao. “I was only joking. You can send another messenger for him and tell him to come soon.” “May I send Sun Qian for him?” “Certainly.” After Liu Bei had gone, Jian Yong came in and said to Yuan Shao, “If Liu Bei goes, he will not come back. I would better go to speak to Liu Biao. And I can keep a watch on Liu Bei.” Yuan Shao agreed and issued orders for both to go. On the subject of the mission, Guo Tu came in to his chief to dissuade him. Said Guo Tu, “Liu Bei went to speak to Liu Pi, but he accomplished nothing. Now you are sending Jian Yong with him, and I am sure neither will ever return.” “Do not be too suspicious,” said Yuan Shao. “Jian Yong is clever enough.” That was the end of the interview."

是夜孫策宿於寨內，又見于吉披髮而來。策於帳中叱喝不絕。次日，吳太夫人傳令，召策回府。策乃歸見其母。夫人見策形容憔悴，泣曰：“兒失形矣！”策卽引鏡自照，果見形容十分瘦損，不覺失驚，顧左右曰：“吾奈何憔悴至此耶！”言未已，忽見于吉立於鏡中。策拍鏡大叫一聲，金瘡迸裂，昏絕於地。夫人令扶入臥內。須臾甦醒，自歎曰：“吾不能復生矣！”隨召張昭等諸人，乃弟孫權，至臥榻前，囑付曰：“天下方亂，以吳越之衆，三江之固，大可有為。子布等幸善相吾弟。”乃取印綬與孫權曰：“若舉江東之衆，決機於兩陣之間，與天下爭衡，卿不如我；舉賢任能，使各盡力以保江東，我不如卿。卿宜念父兄創業之艱難，善自圖之！”權大哭，拜受印綬。策告母曰：“兒天年已盡，不能奉慈母。今將印綬付弟，望母朝夕訓之。父兄舊人，愼勿輕怠。”母哭曰：“恐汝弟年幼，不能任大事，當復如何？”策曰：“弟才勝兒十倍，足當大任。倘內事不決，可問張昭；外事不決，可問周瑜——恨周瑜不在此，不得面囑之也！”又喚諸弟囑曰：“吾死之後，汝等並輔仲謀。宗族中敢有生異心者，衆共誅之。骨肉為逆，不得入祖墳安葬。”諸弟泣受命。又喚妻喬夫人謂曰：“吾與汝不幸中途相分，汝須孝養尊姑。早晚汝妹入見，可囑其轉致周郎，盡心輔佐吾弟，休負我平日相知之雅。”言訖，暝目而逝。年止二十六歲。後人有詩讚曰：,"It was Ye Sun Ce who stayed in the village, and saw Yu Ji Phifa coming. Policy in the tent shouted endlessly. The next day, Mrs. Wu Tai sent an order to summon Ce back to the mansion. Policy is going to see his mother. Seeing Ce's description of haggard, the lady cried, ""You're out of shape!"" Ce You took a look in the mirror and saw that she was very thin and sluggish, so she didn't realize it was startled. Suddenly I saw Ji Li in the mirror. Cepajing screamed, and the golden sore burst and fell to the ground. The lady escorted him into the bedroom. He woke up in a moment, sighed to himself and said, ""I can't come back to life!"" He summoned Zhang Zhao and others, his younger brother Sun Quan, to the bed, and ordered him to say: ""There is chaos under the heavens, with the crowds of Wu and Yue, and the solidity of the three rivers, it is a great deal. You have something to do. Zibu and others are fortunate to be good fellows, my younger brother."" He took the seal and said to Sun Quan: ""If you take the people in the east of the Yangtze River and decide between the two formations to compete with the world, you will not be as good as me; Everyone should try their best to protect Jiangdong, I am not as good as Qing. Qing should remember the difficulties of his father and brother in starting a business, and be good at it!"" Quan cried, and received the seal. Ce told his mother: ""My son's years are over, so he can't serve his loving mother. Now I will give the seal to my younger brother, and I hope that my mother will teach him every morning and evening. If my father and brother are old, don't take it lightly."" If you are in a big business, what should you do?"" Ce said: ""My younger brother is ten times better than my son, and he is a big responsibility. If you are undecided on internal affairs, you can ask Zhang Zhao; if you are undecided on external affairs, you can ask Zhou Yu - I hate that Zhou Yu is not here and can't meet you. Instruct me!"" He also called his younger brothers and said, ""After I die, you will also assist Zhongmou. Those who dare to have a different heart in the clan will be executed by everyone. The flesh and blood are contrary to the ancestral graves."" The younger brothers cried. ordered. He also called his wife Mrs. Qiao and said, ""I unfortunately parted with you halfway. You must be filial to your aunt. Sooner or later, when your sister comes to see you, you can ask her to turn to Zhou Lang, help my brother with all my heart, and take care of my usual acquaintance. ""The words are over, and the eyes are gone. Twenty-six years old. A later poem praised:","Time and time again the spirit appears, until Sun Ce is screaming with fear; the experience has left him looking haggard. The final straw is when his mother says he looks terrible. He takes up a mirror, but it is the face of Yu that looks back. With a terrible cry he collapses, and all his wounds open up again. It is now clear even to Sun Ce that he is dying. Summoning his adviser Zhang Zhao and his younger brother, Sun Quan, he hands over the seal of office to Sun Quan as his heir. ‘If there’s any internal issues that need resolving,’ he advises his mother and brother, ‘ask Zhang Zhao. As for external affairs, ask Zhou Yu.’ Zhou Yu is not present at this point. Having set his affairs in order, Sun Ce dies. He is twenty-six years old. As a poet has said:","That night he slept in the camp and again saw Yu Ji, this time with his hair hanging loose. Sun Ce raged at the vision without cessation. Next day his mother called him into the city and he went. She was shocked at the change in his appearance; he looked so utterly miserable. Her tears fell. “My son,” said Lady Wu, “how wasted you are!” He had a mirror brought and looked at himself; he was indeed so gaunt and thin that he was almost frightened and exclaimed, “How do I come to look so haggard?” While he spoke, Yu Ji appeared in the mirror. He struck it and shrieked. Then the half healed wounds reopened and he fainted. He was raised and borne within. When he recovered consciousness, he said, “This is the end; I shall die.” He sent for Zhang Zhao and his other chief officers and his brother, Sun Quan, and they gathered in his chamber. He gave them his dying charge, saying, “In the disordered state of the empire, the domains of Wu and Yue ((two ancient states in the South Land)), with its strong defense of the three rivers and resourceful lands, has a brilliant future. You, Zhang Zhao, must assist my brother.” So saying Sun Ce handed his seal to Sun Quan, saying, “For manipulating the might of Wu so as to make it the deciding force among the factions and then obtaining the whole empire, you are not so suited as I; but in encouraging the wise and confiding in the able and getting the best out of every one for the preservation of this land, I should not succeed as you will. Remember with what toil and labor your father and I have won what we possess, and take good care thereof.” Sun Quan wept as he knelt to receive the seal, and the dying Sun Ce turned to his mother, saying, “Mother, the days allotted of Heaven have run out, and I can no longer serve my tender mother. I have given over the seal to my brother and trust that you will advise him early and late, and see that he lives worthy of his predecessors.” “Alas! Your brother is full young for such a task,” said his mother, weeping. “I know not what may happen.” “He is far abler than I and fully equal to the task of ruling. Should he have doubts upon internal affairs, he must turn to Zhang Zhao; for outer matters he must consult Zhou Yu. It is a pity Zhou Yu is absent so that I cannot give him my charge face to face.” To his brothers Sun Ce said, “When I am gone, you must help your brother. Should any discord arise in the family, let the others punish the wrongdoer and let not his ashes mingle with those of his ancestors in the family vaults.” The young men wept at these words. Then he called for his wife, Lady Qiao, and said, “Unhappily we have to part while still in the full vigor of life. You must care for my mother. Your sister will come to see you presently, and you can ask her to tell her husband, Zhou Yu, to help my brother in all things and make my brother keep to the way I have taught him to walk in.” Then Sun Ce closed his eyes and soon after passed away. He was only twenty-six. People called him first of the chieftains,"
趙雲聽了，連忙追尋。只見一個人家，被火燒壞土牆，糜夫人抱着阿斗，坐於牆下枯井之傍啼哭。雲急下馬伏地而拜。夫人曰：“妾得見將軍，阿斗有命矣。望將軍可憐他父親飄蕩半世，只有這點骨血。將軍可護持此子，敎他得見父面，妾死無恨！”雲曰：“夫人受難，雲之罪也。不必多言，請夫人上馬。雲自步行死戰，保夫人透出重圍。”糜夫人曰：“不可！將軍豈可無馬？此子全賴將軍保護。妾已重傷，死何足惜！望將軍速抱此子前去，勿以妾為累也。”雲曰：“喊聲將近，追兵已至，請夫人速速上馬。”糜夫人曰：“妾身委實難去，休得兩誤。”乃將阿斗遞與趙雲曰：“此子性命全在將軍身上！”趙雲三回五次，請夫人上馬，夫人只不肯上馬。四邊喊聲又起。雲厲聲曰：“夫人不聽吾言，追軍若至，為之奈何？”糜夫人乃棄阿斗於地，翻身投入枯井中而死。後人有詩讚之曰：,"Zhao Yun heard it and quickly pursued it. I saw a family whose earthen wall was destroyed by fire. Mrs. Mi hugged Ah Dou and sat under the wall by the dry well, crying. Yun anxiously dismounted and bowed to the ground. The lady said: ""If the concubine can see the general, A Dou has a life. The general hopes to pity his father who has wandered for half a lifetime, only this little blood. The general can protect this son and teach him to see his father, and the concubine will die without hatred!"" Yun said: """" Madam suffers, Yun's crime is also. Don't need to say more, please get on the horse. Yun will fight to the death on his own foot, and protect Madam from the siege."" Madam Mi said: ""No! How can the general be without a horse? This son depends entirely on the general's protection. The concubine has already Seriously wounded, what a pity to die! I hope that the general will take this son quickly, and don’t let the concubine be a burden.” Yun said: “The shouting is approaching, the chasing troops are approaching, please get on the horse quickly.” Madam Mi said: “ The concubine's body is really difficult to get rid of, so don't make two mistakes."" He handed A Dou to Zhao Yun and said, ""This son's life is entirely on the general!"" Zhao Yun asked his wife to mount the horse three times and five times, but the lady refused to mount the horse. There were shouts from all sides. Yun said sharply, ""Madam doesn't listen to me, and if the chasing army comes, what can I do?"" Madam Mi abandoned Adou on the ground, turned over and threw herself into a dry well and died. Later generations have a poem to praise:","She and the child are over there, taking refuge.’ The man points to a ruined and burned-out wreck of a house. When Zilong bursts through the shattered front door, he finds the lady and the child. Zilong falls to his knees before her. ‘Now I know the child will live,’ says Lady Mi. ‘Take him to his father, for now I can die in peace.’ Zilong is stunned and urges her to come up onto his horse and he will take them both to Xuande. ‘No!’ Lady Mi cries. ‘Without a horse you cannot protect the child. My wound is so bad I know I’ll not survive. Get going, I beg you, and don’t worry about me.’ The sound of shouting echoes around the ruin, and Zilong says, ‘But the enemy are coming. We must flee now.’ But Lady Mi is adamant. ‘I’m dying, but if you stay both lives will be lost.’ And so saying, she thrust the child into his arms. Zilong tries time and time again to persuade her, handing the child back, but to no avail. Finally he says, ‘But imagine what will happen when the soldiers find you.’ To his horror, she puts the child on the ground, rises and staggers to the mouth of a dry well. Turning, she throws herself into it and dies. A poet has honoured her self-sacrifice with this poem:","Zhao Yun rode to look and there, beside an old well behind the broken wall of a burned house, sat the mother clasping the child to her breast and weeping. Zhao Yun was on his knees before her in a moment. “My child will live then since you are here,” cried Lady Mi. “Pity him, O General; protect him, for he is the only son of his father's flesh and blood. Take him to his father and I can die content.” “It is my fault that you have suffered,” replied Zhao Yun. “But it is useless to say more. I pray you take my horse while I will walk beside and protect you till we get clear.” She replied, “I may not do that. What would you do without a steed? But the boy here I confide to your care. I am badly wounded and cannot hope to live. Pray take him and go your way. Do not trouble more about me.” “I hear shouting,” said Zhao Yun. “The soldiers will be upon us again in a moment. Pray mount quickly.” “But really I cannot move,” she said. “Do not let there be a double loss!” And she held out the child toward him as she spoke. “Take the child,” cried Lady Mi. “His life and safety are in your hands.” Again and again Zhao Yun besought her to get on his horse, but she would not. The shouting drew nearer and nearer, Zhao Yun spoke harshly, saying, “If you will not do what I say, what will happen when the soldiers come up?” She said no more. Throwing the child on the ground, she turned over and threw herself into the old well. And there she perished. The warrior relies upon the strength of his charger,"

Each led ten thousand troops, and the rest defended the city. Lu Bu went out of the city thirty li and went down to the village. Zhang Xun's army arrived, but he expected the enemy Lu Bu to be no match, so he retreated twenty miles to live in the camp, waiting for the four soldiers to respond. At the time of the second watch, Han Xian and Yang Feng divided their troops and set fires everywhere, in response to the Lu family's army entering the village. The army was in chaos. Lu Bu took advantage of the situation to cover up the attack, and Zhang Xun was defeated. When Lu Bu arrived at dawn, he bumped into Ji Ling to meet him. The two armies greeted each other, and just in time for the confrontation, Han Xian and Yang Feng came on both sides. Ji Ling was defeated and left, and Lu Bu led his troops to pursue him. Behind the mountain, a large army arrives, and the flags are opened, and there is a group of military horses, fighting dragons and phoenixes, sun and moon flags, banners of four battles and five directions, golden melons and silver axes, yellow scorpions and white scorpions, and Huang Luopins under the golden umbrellas, Yuan Shu is wearing Jin Jia, with two knives hanging from his wrists, stood in front of the formation, scolding Lu Bu, ""Carrying back the master's servant!"" Li Feng, the general of the art, came to meet him with a gun; Lü Bu's troops rushed to kill, and the army was in chaos. Lü Bu led an army to chase after him, robbing countless horses and armor. Yuan Shu led the defeated army and couldn't walk several miles. Behind the mountain, a huge army came out, blocking the way. The first general was Guan Yunchang Ye, who shouted, ""Rebel! Don't die!"" Yuan Shu panicked, and the rest of the crowd fled, but Yunchang killed him for a while. Yuan Shu packed up the defeated army and ran back to Huainan. Lu Bu was victorious, and invited Yun Chang, Yang Feng, Han Xian, and other entourage to Xuzhou, where they lined up for a feast. Soldiers are rewarded. The next day, Yun Chang resigned. Bubao Han Xian was the shepherd of Yidu, and Yang Feng was the shepherd of Langya, and they negotiated to keep the two in Xuzhou. Chen Gui said, ""No: Han and Yang have taken possession of Shandong, and within a year, the city of Shandong will all belong to generals."" Bu Ranzhi, he sent the two generals to temporarily settle in Yidu and Langya, in order to receive favor. Life. Chen Deng asked his father privately, ""Why don't you keep the two of them in Xuzhou to kill Lv Bu's roots?"" Gui said, ""If the two help Lv Bu, they will be adding minions to the tiger."" Deng Nai obeyed his father's high opinion.","However, one of the seven commanders, Han Xian, is brought over to Lü Bu’s side. He was one of those who helped the true emperor escape from Chang’an. Therefore his first loyalty is to the Han dynasty. Working upon this, he is turned by Lü Bu’s men. He in turn brings on board another of the seven commanders, Yang Feng. At the crucial moment these two betray Yuan Shu, who flees, almost falling into the hands of Guan Yu, who is supporting Lü Bu’s army. Few, indeed, out of Yuan Shu’s vast armies make it home.","As soon as Chen Deng had got back and reported his success, Lu Bu divided his troops into five divisions, each of ten thousand, and sent them to five threatened towns to meet his enemies. Gao Shun led one army to Xiaopei against Qiao Rui; Chen Gong to Yidu against Chen Ji; Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to Langye against Lei Bo; Song Xian and Wei Xu to Jieshi against Chen Lan. Lu Bu himself led against the main body under Zhang Xun, leaving a small guard in Xuzhou City. Lu Bu camped ten miles from the walls. When the enemy came up, Zhang Xun thought Lu Bu too strong to attack with the force he had, so he retired seven miles to await reinforcements. That night, in the second watch, Han Xian and Yang Feng arrived, and soon the flare was lighted as arranged. Lu Bu's troops were admitted to the camp and caused great confusion. Then Lu Bu gave a full attack, and Zhang Xun was routed and fled. Lu Bu pursued till daylight, when he fell in with one of the other bodies led by Ji Ling. Both sides faced each other; but at the very beginning of the engagement Yang Feng and Han Xian also attacked, and Ji Ling was forced to fly. Lu Bu went in pursuit but soon another force came out from the rear of some hills. These looked very imposing. As the ranks opened Lu Bu saw a leader's guard with flags bearing dragons and phoenixes and representations of the sun and moon, the stars in the four groups of the Great Bear Constellation, the five directions of the Earth, golden gourds, silver axes, yellow halberds, white yaks' tails, all imperial emblems. And beneath a yellow silken parasol sat Yuan Shu on horseback, clad in silver mail with a sword handle showing at each wrist. Standing out in front of the array, Yuan Shu railed at his opponent calling him traitor and bastard. Lu Bu said nothing but rode forward ready for battle, and Li Feng, one of Yuan Shu's leaders, advanced to take the challenge. They met, but at the third bout, Li Feng was wounded in the hand, whereupon his spear fell to the ground, and he fled. Lu Bu waved on the advance and his men prevailed. The other side fled, leaving much spoil, clothing, mail, and horses. Yuan Shu's defeated troops had not gone far when a strong army, led by Guan Yu, appeared barring his way. “Traitor! Why have they not slain you?” cried Guan Yu. Whereat Yuan Shu fled in great trepidation, and his army melted into fugitives in all directions. The new army fell upon them with great slaughter. Yuan Shu and the remnant of his army retreated into the below regions of River Huai. Victory being now secure, Lu Bu, in company with Guan Yu, Yang Feng, and Han Xian returned to Xuzhou, where there were banquets and feasting and rewards for the soldiers and generals of five divisions. These over, Guan Yu took his leave and returned to Yuzhou, while Han Xian was appointed Governor of Yidu, and Yang Feng Governor of Langye. There had been a question of keeping these two in Xuzhou City, but Chen Gui opposed it, saying, “Let them hold those places in Huashang Mountains, which will be all yours within a year.” So Han Xian and Yang Feng were sent to these two cities in the meantime to await orders. “Why not retain them here?” asked Chen Deng secretly of his father. “They would be a basis for our conspiracy against Lu Bu.” “But if they helped him, on the other hand, we should lengthen the tiger's claws and teeth,” said Chen Gui. So Chen Deng could only approve of his father's precautions."

言未已，一人昂然而進曰：“傅公悌、蒯異度之言甚善，何不從之？”衆視之，乃山陽高平人：姓王，名粲，字仲宣。粲容貌瘦弱，身材短小；幼時往見中郎蔡邕，時邕高朋滿座，聞粲至，倒履迎之。賓客皆驚曰：“蔡中郎何獨敬此小子耶？”邕曰：“此子有異才，吾不如也。”粲博聞強記，人皆不及：嘗觀道旁碑文一過，便能記誦；觀人奕棋，棋局亂，粲復為擺出，不差一子。又善算術。其文詞妙絕一時。年十七，辟為黃門侍郎，不就。後因避亂至荊襄，劉表以為上賓。當日謂劉琮曰：“將軍自料比曹公何如？”琮曰：“不如也。”粲曰：“曹公兵強將勇，足智多謀。擒呂布於下邳，摧袁紹於官渡，逐劉備於隴右，破烏桓於白狼：梟除蕩定者，不可勝計。今以大軍南下荊襄，勢難抵敵。傅、蒯二君之謀，乃長策也。將軍不可遲疑，致生後悔。”琮曰：“先生見敎極是。但須稟告母親知道。”只見蔡夫人從屏後轉出，謂琮曰：“旣是仲宣、公悌、異度三人所見相同，何必告我？”於是劉琮意決，便寫降書，令宋忠潛地往曹操軍前投獻。宋忠領命，直至宛城，接着曹操，獻上降書。操大喜，重賞宋忠，分付敎劉琮出城迎接，便着他永為荊州之主。,"Before he had finished speaking, a man stepped forward and said, ""Fu Gongti and Kuai Yidu said very good words, why not follow them?"" Everyone looked upon them as a native of Gaoping, Shanyang: surnamed Wang, given name Char, and styled Zhongxuan. Can has a thin appearance and a short stature; when she was a child, she went to see Zhonglang Cai Yong, and when Yong was full of friends, when she heard that she was coming, she walked to greet him. All the guests were startled and said, ""Why does Cai Zhonglang respect this kid alone?"" Yong said, ""This kid has extraordinary talents, so I'm not as good as me."" Charming Bo Wen tried to remember it, but no one could reach it: after tasting the inscription on the tablet next to the Taoist Temple, he could recite it. ; Watching people play chess, the chess game is chaotic, and the charm is put out, not missing a piece. Also good at arithmetic. His words are superb. At the seventeenth year of the year, he became a servant of the Huangmen, and it was not enough. Later, to avoid chaos, he went to Jingxiang, and Liu Biao regarded him as a guest. On the same day, Liu Cong asked, ""How does the general compare to Duke Cao?"" Cong said, ""Not as good as it is."" Can said, ""The Duke of Cao has strong generals, courage, and resourcefulness. He captured Lu Bu at Xiapi, destroyed Yuan Shao at Guandu, and chased Liu Bei at Long. Right, to break the Wuhuan against the white wolf: Xiaoxiao is unable to defeat the Dangding. Now the army is heading south to Jingxiang, and it is difficult to defeat the enemy. The plan of Fu and Kuai is a long-term strategy. I regret it."" Cong said, ""Sir, you see that you are very right. But you must tell your mother to know."" I saw Mrs. Cai turned out from behind the screen and said to Cong, ""It's Zhong Xuan, Gong Ti, and Yidu who see the same thing, why bother. Sue me?"" So Liu Cong made up his mind and wrote a letter of surrender, ordering Song Zhong to surrender to Cao Cao's army. Song Zhong led the order until Wancheng, and then Cao Cao presented the surrender letter. Cao was overjoyed, rewarded Song Zhong with great rewards, and assigned Liu Cong to go out of the city to meet him, so that he would be the lord of Jingzhou forever.","‘So what can we do?’ asks a very troubled and frightened Liu Zong. ‘Let’s write to Cao Cao,’ says Fu Xuan, ‘and offer him our lands. I’m sure he’ll give you a senior post and protect you.’ ‘I can’t believe this!’ cries a bewildered Liu Zong. ‘I have only just become ruler, and now you want me to give it away!’ ‘Fu Xuan is right,’ says Kuai Yue. ‘ Cao Cao is strong – we’re not. You, sir, have only just taken up your position, and there is no evidence that you have the loyal following of our people at this point. The people are terrified of Cao Cao’s advancing army and show no desire to resist.’ Liu Zong is gradually convinced that there is no other option, and a messenger is sent to Cao Cao offering the surrender of the lands.","He was interrupted by a speaker who said, “If their advice is good, why not follow it?” They turned toward the speaker who was a certain Wang Can of Shanyang, a lean, cadaverous individual much below the middle height of a man. However, his talents did not conform to his physical appearance. When he was yet a youth, he went to visit Minister Cai Yong, then a vice-chairman of the Secretariat; and although many guests of exalted rank were present, the host hastened to welcome the newcomer with the greatest deference. The others were astonished and asked why he was so respectful to a mere youth. “He is a young man with the highest gifts,” said Cai Yong. Wang Can was widely read and had a most retentive memory, better than any of his contemporaries. If he glanced at a roadside monument as he passed, he remembered every word of the inscription. If he saw people playing chess and the board was suddenly overthrown, he could replace every pip in its proper place. He was a good mathematician and his poems were exquisite. At seventeen he was appointed a court official but did not take up the appointment. When the disturbance in the empire grew serious, he sought refuge in Jingzhou, where he was received with great honor as guest of the Imperial Protector. What he said was this, “General, how do you compare with Cao Cao?” “Inferior,” replied Liu Zong. Wang Can continued, “Cao Cao has many soldiers and bold leaders; he is able and resourceful. He took Lu Bu at Xiapi and broke the power of Yuan Shao at Guandu. He pursued Liu Bei into Longyou and destroyed Mao Dun at White Wolf Hills. The destruction of such firmly established men shows his invincible character. Now he is on the way here, and it will be very difficult to withstand him. The plan proposed is the best you can expect, and you should not delay and hesitate till it is too late for ought but regret.” “Worthy Sir, you indeed speak to the point; I must inform my mother,” said the young ruler. But just then they saw his mother appear from behind a screen; she had been listening to all that was said. “Why refer to me when three such gentlemen coincide in their opinions?” said Lady Cai. So Liu Zong decided, and the letter of surrender was composed and entrusted to one Song Zhong to convey secretly to Cao Cao. Song Zhong went straight to Wancheng and presented the letter. It was received with joy and the bearer well rewarded. The submission was accepted, and Cao Cao said, “Tell Liu Zong to go out to meet me in the open country, and he will be in perpetual tenure of his land.”"

Cao raised his troops and moved forward, and the settlement was decided. The next day, the two armies faced each other and formed a battle. Cao led the generals to the battle, and Shao Yi led the three sons and one nephew, as well as civil officials and military generals to the front of the battle. Cao said: ""The original plan is exhausted, why don't you think about surrendering? Waiting for the sword to be on the shoulder, I will regret it!"" Shao was furious and looked back at the generals and said, ""Who dares to go out?"" Yuan Shang wanted to show his power in front of his father. , then danced with two swords, flew into battle, and galloped back and forth. Cao pointed and asked the generals, ""Who is this?"" Those who knew him replied, ""This is Yuan Shao's third son Yuan Shang."" It was Shi Huan, a general of Xu Huang's subordinate. The two cavalry crossed each other, but they did not join together, but they moved diagonally with their spurs. When Shi Huan came, Yuan Shang took a bow and an arrow, turned over and shot from the back, hit Shi Huan's left eye, fell off the horse and died. When Yuan Shao saw that his son had won, he waved his whip, and a large group of men came to melee. After a big kill, each Mingjin withdrew his army and returned to the village.","News comes that Yuan Shao has brought his army of two to three hundred thousand to Cangting. So Cao Cao marches to confront him. After hurling insults at each other the two armies clash, and terrible loss of life ensues. But it is inconclusive. Frustrated by this, Cao Cao and his advisers plan to use a complex set of ambushes – no less than ten in total – to fool and then destroy Yuan Shao’s army.","It was told Cao Cao that the total army from the four regions under the Yuan family amounted to two hundred thirty thousand soldiers and they were camped at Cangting. Cao Cao then advanced nearer them and made a strong camp. Next day the two armies were arrayed over against each other. On one side Cao Cao rode to the front surrounded by his commanders, and on the other appeared Yuan Shao supported by his three sons, his nephew, and his leaders. Cao Cao spoke first, “Yuan Shao, your schemes are poor, your strength is exhausted, why still refuse to think of surrender? Are you waiting till the sword shall be upon your neck? Then it will be too late.” Yuan Shao turned to those about him, saying, “Who dares go out?” His son Yuan Shang was anxious to exhibit his prowess in the presence of his father, so he flourished his pair of swords and rode forth. Cao Cao pointed him out to his officers and asked, “Any one knows him?” “He is the youngest son of Yuan Shao,” was the reply. Before they had finished speaking, from their own side rode out Shi Huan, armed with a spear. The two champions fought a little while and suddenly Yuan Shang whipped up his horse, made a feint and fled. His opponent followed. Yuan Shang took his bow, fitted an arrow, turned in his saddle, and shot at Shi Huan, wounding him in the left eye. He fell from the saddle and died on the spot. Yuan Shao seeing his son thus get the better of his opponent, gave the signal for attack, and the whole army thundered forward. The onslaught was heavy, but presently the gongs on both sides sounded the retire and the battle ceased."

Cao said: ""Don't forget the old master, come and go to understand, the real husband is also. You should all follow it."" Then he ordered Cai Yang to retreat, and did not order him to rush. Cheng Yu said: ""The prime minister treats Guan very kindly, and now he leaves without saying goodbye, slandering Junwei, and the crime is very serious. If you let him go to Yuan Shao, it will be more wings to the tiger. It's better to chase after him. Kill them, so as to avoid future troubles."" Cao said: ""I have promised it in the past, how can I lose my trust? They are their masters, so don't chase them."" Zhang Liao said, ""Yunchang seals gold and hangs a seal, and money and bribes cannot be moved. His heart, Jue Lu does not change his ambition, I deeply respect such people. I think he is not far from here, I will get to know him as a personal relationship. You can go and invite him first, wait for me to see him off, and then take the road Fei Zhengpao gave it as a gift for the future."" Zhang Liao took the order and rode alone. Cao Cao led dozens of cavalry to follow.","Cao Cao, keen to be seen by Guan Yu as a man of virtue and honour, also recognizes that Cai Yang has never liked Guan Yu. He therefore responds to Cai Yang’s offer by exclaiming that Guan Yu is a man of honour and they should try one more time to appeal to that honour. So he sends Guan Yu’s friend Zhang Liao racing after him to ask him to stop while Cao Cao follows up behind to talk with him.","Now of all the officers in Cao Cao's army, the two friendly toward Guan Yu were Zhang Liao and Xu Huang. The others treated Guan Yu with respect, except Cai Yang who was decidedly inimical. So this Cai Yang was ready to pursue and capture Guan Yu as soon as he heard of his departure. But Cao Cao accepted Guan Yu's going as natural. “He does not forget his old leader, and he was perfectly open in all his actions. He is a gentleman, and you would do well to follow his example,” said Cao Cao. So Cao Cao bade the would-be pursuer be gone and say no more about pursuit. “You were exceedingly good to Guan Yu,” said Cheng Yu, “but he went off very rudely. He certainly left a screed behind with his reasons, but he affronted you, and that is no light matter. Now to let him join Yuan Shao is to add wings to a tiger. You would better catch him and put him to death so as to guard against future evil.” Cao Cao replied, “But he had my promise, and can I break my word? Each has his master. Do not pursue.” But Cao Cao said to Zhang Liao, “He has rejected all I gave him, so bribes were powerless with him in whatever shape. I have the greatest respect for such as him. He has not yet gone far, and I will try to strengthen his attachment to me and make one appeal to sentiment. Ride after him and beg him to stop till I can come up and bid farewell and offer him a sum of money for his expenses and a fighting robe, that he may remember me kindly in after days.” So Zhang Liao rode out quite alone; Cao Cao followed him leisurely with an escort of a score or so."

The officials sat down again, and they all dispersed.","Writing to his friend the minister of the home office, Wang Yun, he urges him to organize the overthrow of Dong Zhuo. When he receives the letter, Wang Yun invites a group of men whom he suspects also want the removal of the corrupt Dong Zhuo. Under cover of a birthday party they discuss the terrible state of affairs. It is at this point that Cao Cao steps forward. If he could be given Wang Yun’s seven-jewelled dagger as the implement and inducement, he says he will stab Dong Zhuo to death. The jewelled dagger is handed over, and everyone present nervously but hopefully drinks to the success of Cao Cao’s plan. Armed with the precious dagger, Cao Cao makes his way to Dong Zhuo’s palace, where he finds Dong Zhuo. He is now so fat he has to lie reclining on a couch. Asked why he is so late, Cao Cao replies that his horse is unfit for travel,","The letter arrived but Wang Yun could see no chance to plot against Dong Zhuo. One day while among the throng in attendance, mostly people of long service, Wang Yun said to his colleagues, “This is my birthday , I pray you come to a little party in my humble cot this evening.” “We certainly will,” they cried, “and wish you long life.” That night the tables were spread in an inner room, and his friends gathered there. When the wine had made a few rounds, the host suddenly covered his face and began to weep. The guests were aghast. “Sir, on your birthday too, why do you weep?” said they. “It is not my birthday,” replied Wang Yun. “But I wished to call you together and I feared lest Dong Zhuo should suspect, so I made that the excuse. This man insults the Emperor and does as he wishes so that the imperial prerogatives are in imminent peril. I think of the days when our illustrious founder destroyed the Qin, annihilated Chu, and obtained the empire. Who could have foreseen this day when that Dong Zhuo has subjugated all to his will? That is why I weep.” Then they all wept with him. Seated among the guests, however, was Cao Cao, who did not join in the weeping but clapped his hands and laughed aloud. “If all the officers of the government weep till dawn, and from dawn weep till dark, will that slay Dong Zhuo?” said Cao Cao. Wang Yun turned on him angrily. “Your forbears ate the bounty of the Hans; do you feel no gratitude? You can laugh?” “I laughed at the absurdity of an assembly like this being unable to compass the death of one man. Foolish and incapable as I am, I will cut off his head and hang it at the gate as an offering to the people.” Wang Yun left his seat and went over to Cao Cao. “These later days,” Cao Cao continued, “I have bowed my head to Dong Zhuo with the sole desire of finding a chance to destroy him. Now he begins to trust me and so I can approach him sometimes. You have a sword with seven precious jewels which I would borrow, and I will go into his palace and kill him. I care not if I die for it.” “What good fortune for the world that this is so!” said Wang Yun. With this Wang Yun himself poured out a goblet for Cao Cao who drained it and swore an oath. After this the treasured sword was brought out and given to Cao Cao who hid it under his dress. He finished his wine, took leave of the guests, and left the hall. Before long the others dispersed."

Without half the effort of Jiangdong, more than one hundred thousand arrows have been obtained. Tomorrow you will shoot Cao's army, but it is not very convenient?"" Su said: "" You are truly a genius! How do you know that it is so foggy today?"" Kong Ming said, ""If you are a general, you don't know the astronomy, you don't know the geography, you don't know the door, you don't know the yin and yang, you don't read the formation map, and you don't know the strength of the army. You're a mediocre person. Three days ago, it was determined that there will be heavy fog today, so I dare to set the limit of three days. Gong Jin taught me to finish the work in ten days, and the craftsmen should not handle the materials and materials. I knew this romantic crime and knew that I was going to kill me; Tie to the sky, how can Gongjin harm me!"" Lu Su bowed.","Turning to Lu Su, Kong Ming says, ‘Well, each boat has collected around five to six thousand arrows and by my calculations and without any cost to the south, we have more than the one hundred thousand arrows required. So tomorrow we will return them to the enemy!’ Lu Su is, of course, delighted as well as astonished. ‘How did you know about the fog?’ he asks. Kong Ming replies, ‘A truly great commander must understand the patterns in Heaven, and those on Earth. He must understand how the gates open and comprehend the flow of yin and yang. He must know how to read and understand a map and have a profound brilliance in planning the disposition of his forces. Three days ago I was able to calculate that there would be such a fog, which is why I told Zhou three days when he offered ten! Given that Zhou offered no practical help whatsoever, it was clear he meant to do away with me. But I’m protected by the Mandate of Heaven, so there is nothing that Zhou Yu can do to overthrow that!’ As the boats arrive at the shore, so do the five hundred men that Kong Ming has asked to be ready.","On the way down Zhuge Liang said to his companion, “Every boat must have five or six thousand arrows and so, without the expenditure of an ounce of energy, we must have more than ten myriad arrows, which tomorrow can be shot back again at Cao Cao's army to his great inconvenience.” “You are really superhuman,” said Lu Su. “But how did you know there would be a thick fog today?” “One cannot be a leader without knowing the workings of heaven and the ways of earth. One must understand the secret gates and the interdependence of the elements, the mysteries of tactics and the value of forces. It is but an ordinary talent. I calculated three days ago that there would be a fog today, and so I set the limit at three days. Zhou Yu would give me ten days, but neither artificers nor material, so that he might find occasion to put me to death as I knew; but my fate lies with the Supreme, and how could Zhou Yu harm me?” Lu Su could not but agree."

當日劉繇兵大敗，人馬大半降策。策斬首萬餘。劉繇與笮融走豫章投劉表去了。孫策還兵復攻秣陵，親到城壕邊，招諭薛禮投降。城上暗放一冷箭，正中孫策左腿，翻身落馬。衆將急救起，還營拔箭，以金瘡藥傅之。策令軍中詐稱主將中箭身死。軍中舉哀，拔寨齊起。薛禮聽知孫策已死，連夜起城內之軍，與驍將張英、陳橫殺出城來追之。忽然伏兵四起，孫策當先出馬，高聲大叫曰：“孫郎在此！”衆軍皆驚，盡棄鎗刀，拜於地下。策令休殺一人。張英撥馬回走，被陳武一鎗刺死。陳橫被蔣欽一箭射死。薛禮死於亂軍中。策入秣陵，安輯居民；移兵至涇縣來捉太史慈。,"That day, Liu Yao's army was defeated, and most of his troops surrendered. Ce beheaded more than 10,000. Liu Yao and Zhe Rong went to Yuzhang to join Liu Biao. Sun Ce returned his troops to attack Moring, went to the moat in person, and summoned Xue Li to surrender. A cold arrow was secretly released on the city, hit Sun Ce's left leg, and fell from the horse. The generals raised the first aid, and also drew arrows, and gave them medicine for golden sores. The commanding army falsely claimed that the general was killed by an arrow. The army mourned, and the villages were pulled up. Xue Li heard that Sun Ce was dead, so he raised the army in the city overnight, and rushed out of the city with Xiao generals Zhang Ying and Chen Heng to chase him. Suddenly, ambush soldiers all around, Sun Ce was the first to get out of his horse and shouted loudly, ""Sun Lang is here!"" He ordered Hugh to kill one person. Zhang Ying turned his horse back and was stabbed to death by Chen Wu. Chen Heng was shot to death by Jiang Qin. Xue Li died in the chaos of the army. They entered Moling and settled the residents; they moved troops to Jing County to capture Taishi Ci.","Ignoring Liu Yao’s pleas to stop, and with only one other, rather minor commander joining him, Taishi Ci rides out to fight Sun Ce. He and Sun Ce go fifty rounds without either gaining the upper hand. Given that Sun Ce has twelve guards with him and Taishi Ci only one, he lures Sun Ce away from his guards by feigning flight. When Taishi Ci turns, the fight starts again, only it grows more and more desperate. Blow after blow rains down until they are both knocked from their horses. But still they fight, struggling on the ground. The fight only stops when soldiers from both sides ride up and separate them. This bitter feud shapes the encounters between the two armies as the battles rage across the countryside. Subterfuge is employed by both sides until at last Taishi Ci is captured and brought before Sun Ce.","Liu Yao had a defeat; the greater portion of his force surrendered, and the number of those slain exceeded ten thousand. Liu Yao himself fled to Yuzhang and sought safety with Liu Biao, Imperial Protector of Jingzhou. An attack on Moling was the next move. As soon as Sun Ce arrived at the moat, he summoned Commander Xue Li to surrender. Some one let fly a furtive arrow from the wall which wounded Sun Ce in the left thigh so severely that he fell from his steed. Hastily his officers picked up their wounded chief and returned to the camp where the arrow was pulled out and the wound dressed with the medicines suitable for injuries by metals. By Sun Ce's command the story was spread abroad that the hurt had been fatal, and all the soldiers set up cries of lamentation. The camp was broken up. Xue Li, Zhang Ying, and Chen Heng made a night sortie but fell into a carefully prepared ambush, and presently Sun Ce himself appeared on horseback shouting: “Sun Ce is here still!” His sudden appearance created such a panic that the soldiers dropped their weapons and fell on their faces. Sun Ce gave orders not to kill them. But their leaders fell: Zhang Ying from Chen Wu's spear thrust as he turned to run away ; Chen Heng was killed by Jiang Qin's arrow; and the Commander, Xue Li, was slain in the turbulence. Thus Sun Ce got possession of Moling."

魯肅是個寬仁長者，見玄德如此哀痛，只得應允。玄德、孔明拜謝。宴畢，送魯肅下船。逕到柴桑，見了周瑜，具言其事。周瑜頓足曰：“子敬又中諸葛亮之計也！當初劉備依劉表時，常有吞併之意，何況西川劉璋乎？似此推調，未免累及老兄矣。吾有一計，使諸葛亮不能出吾算中。子敬便當一行。”肅曰：“願聞妙策。”瑜曰：“子敬不必去見吳侯，再去荊州對劉備說：孫、劉兩家，旣結為親，便是一家；若劉氏不忍去取西川，我東吳起兵去取；取得西川時，以作嫁資，却把荊州交還東吳。”肅曰：“西川迢遞，取之非易。都督此計，莫非不可？”瑜笑曰：“子敬眞長者也。你道我眞個去取西川與他？我只以此為名，實欲去取荊州，且敎他不做準備。東吳軍馬收川，路過荊州，就問他索要錢糧，劉備必然出城勞軍。那時乘勢殺之，奪取荊州，雪吾之恨，解足下之禍。”魯肅大喜，便再往荊州來。玄德與孔明商議。孔明曰：“魯肅必不曾見吳侯，只到柴桑和周瑜商量了甚計策，來誘我耳。但說的話，主公只看我點頭，便滿口應承。”計會已定，魯肅入見，禮畢，曰：“吳侯甚是稱讚皇叔盛德，遂與諸將商議，起兵替皇叔收川。取了西川，却換荊州，以西川權當嫁資。但軍馬經過，却望應些錢糧。”孔明聽了，忙點頭曰：“難得吳侯好心！”玄德拱手稱謝曰：“此皆子敬善言之力。”孔明曰：“如雄師到日，卽當遠接犒勞。”魯肅暗喜，宴罷辭回。玄德問孔明曰：“此是何意？”孔明大笑曰：“周瑜死日近矣！這等計策，小兒也瞞不過！”玄德又問如何。孔明曰：“此乃‘假途滅虢’之計也。虛名收川，實取荊州。等主公出城勞軍，乘勢拏下，殺入城來，攻其無備，出其不意也。”玄德曰：“如之奈何？”孔明曰：“主公寬心，只顧‘準備窩弓以擒猛虎，安排香餌以釣鰲魚’。等周瑜到來，他便不死，也九分無氣。”便喚趙雲聽計：“如此如此，其餘我自有擺布。”玄德大喜。後人有詩歎云：,"Lu Su was a kind-hearted elder. Seeing Xuande's sorrow, he had to agree. Xuande and Kong Ming thank you. After the banquet, send Lu Su off the boat. He went straight to Chaisang, met Zhou Yu, and told the story. Zhou Yu paused and said, ""Zijing is also in the middle of Zhuge Liang's plan! When Liu Bei followed Liu Biao, he always had the intention of annexation, let alone Liu Zhang in Xichuan? It seems that this adjustment will inevitably affect the old brother. I have a plan to prevent Zhuge Liang from going out. I’m in the middle of my calculation. Zijing will be on his way.” Su said, “I would like to hear about the wonderful strategy.” Yu said, “Zijing does not need to go to see the Marquis of Wu, and then go to Jingzhou and say to Liu Bei: The Sun and Liu families will become relatives. It is a family; if the Liu family can’t bear to take Xichuan, I will raise troops from Soochow to take it; when I obtain Xichuan, I will use it as a dowry, but return Jingzhou to Soochow.” Su said: “Xichuan is handed over, and it is not easy to take. Is this plan impossible?"" Yu smiled and said, ""Zi Jing is really the elder. Do you want me to go and take Xichuan and him? I just use this as the name, I really want to go to Jingzhou, and tell him not to make preparations. When Wu Jun's horses closed the river and passed Jingzhou, he asked him for money and food, and Liu Bei would definitely leave the city to work on the army. At that time, he took advantage of the situation to kill him and seize Jingzhou, Xue Wu's hatred, and relieved the disaster of his steps."" Lu Su was overjoyed and went to Jingzhou again. Xuande discussed with Kong Ming. Kong Ming said: ""Lu Su must have never seen Marquis Wu, but only went to Chai Sang and Zhou Yu to discuss some strategies, and came to tempt my ears. But what I said, the lord just saw me nodding, and then he was full of promise."" Upon entering the meeting, the ceremony was over, and he said: ""The Marquis Wu praised the emperor's uncle's virtuousness very much, so he discussed with the generals to raise troops to take Sichuan for the emperor's uncle. He took Xichuan, but changed it to Jingzhou, and used Xichuan's power as a dowry. But the army and horses passed by But I want some money and food.” When Kong Ming heard this, he nodded hurriedly and said, “It’s rare for the Marquis of Wu to be kind!” Xuande bowed his hands and thanked him and said, “These are all sons who respect the power of kind words.” Kong Ming said, “If a great master arrives in the sun, I will Reward from afar."" Lu Su was delighted and resigned after the banquet. Xuande asked Kong Ming, ""What is the meaning of this?"" Kong Ming laughed loudly and said, ""Zhou Yu's death is approaching! Even a child can't hide such tactics!"" Xuande asked again. Kong Ming said: ""This is a 'false way to destroy the Guo' plan. It is a false name to close Sichuan, but actually take Jingzhou. Wait for the lord to leave the city to work the army, take advantage of the situation, and enter the city, attacking its unprepared, surprise."" Xuande said ""What can I do?"" Kong Ming said: ""My lord is relieved, and he only cares about 'preparing a bow to capture tigers, and arranging fragrant bait to catch squid'. When Zhou Yu arrives, he will not die, and he will be out of breath."" He called Zhao Yun. Listening to the plan: ""This is the case, and the rest is at my own mercy."" Xuande was overjoyed. Later generations have a poem and sigh:","So Lu Su returns to Chaisang and Zhou Yu, and delivers the message. Zhou Yu is incandescent with rage and bluntly tells Lu Su, ‘He has fooled you again!’ However, after giving the matter some thought, Zhou Yu comes up with his own plot. He sends Lu Su back with the message that his brother-in-law, in order to honour their being now one family, will invade the western Riverlands of Shu. He will do this on behalf of them both and once he has seized those lands he will of course hand them over as a sort of dowry and then take back Jingzhou in return. However, Zhou Yu also confides to Lu Su that he has no intention of invading the western Riverlands. His plan is to appear to set off to invade the west but en route suddenly turn and attack Jingzhou. So off goes Lu Su once again. And once again, before Lu Su is ushered in, Xuande and Kong Ming consult. ‘If I nod, agree to whatever Lu Su says,’ says Kong Ming. Lu Su enters and after the usual courtesies outlines the proposal and says, ‘When we pass by, we would of course expect that you will help us with funds and resources.’ Kong Ming nods, so Xuande agrees. Kong Ming adds, ‘When these brave men come by we’ll do all in our power to entertain and support them.’ After Lu Su has left, Xuande asks Kong Ming what that was all about. ‘It is the old ploy of passing by but really going to attack,’ says Kong Ming. ‘If you go out of the city to greet them, they’ll kidnap you and take the city.’ ‘So what do we do?’ asks Xuande. ‘Don’t you worry. I have a plan. By the time we finish with Zhou Yu he will be as good as dead.’ And, calling for Zhao Zilong, he gives him explicit instructions. As a later poem says:","Lu Su was really the first of generous people; and seeing Liu Bei in such distress, he could do no other than consent and say he would do so. Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang both thanked him most cordially, and after a banquet the emissary went down into his ship to return. On the way Lu Su called in to see Zhou Yu at Chaisang and told him. But Zhou Yu stamped his foot with rage and said, “My friend, you have been fooled again. Long ago when Liu Bei was dependent on Liu Biao, he always cherished the intention to supplant him; think you that he really pities Liu Zhang? This sort of evasive policy will certainly cause you much trouble. However, I have a scheme which I think Zhuge Liang will not be able to get the better of. Only you will have to make another journey.” “I should be pleased to hear your fine scheme,” said Lu Su. “Do not go to see our master. Return to Jingzhou and say to Liu Bei that since his family and the Suns are related by marriage, they really form but one house, and since he has qualms about attacking the west, we will do it for him. Thus, the South Land will march an army under this pretext, but really go to Jingzhou, and we shall take him unprepared. The road to the west runs through his city, and we will call upon him for supplies. He will come out to thank the army, and we will assassinate him whereby we shall revenge ourselves and at the same time remove a source of future evil.” This seemed an excellent plan to Lu Su, and he returned at once to Jingzhou. Before receiving him, Liu Bei talked over the matter with his adviser. Said Zhuge Liang, “Lu Su has not seen the Marquis of Wu, he has called in at Chaisang, and he and Zhou Yu have decided upon some scheme, which he is to talk you into accepting. However, let him talk; you, my lord, only watch me; and when I nod my head, then you agree to whatever he may propose.” Lu Su was then admitted and said, “The Marquis of Wu praises the noble virtue of the Imperial Uncle; and after consultation with his officers, he has determined to take the western country on the Imperial Uncle's behalf and, that done, Jingzhou can be exchanged for it without further delay. However, when the army marches through, it will be expected of you to contribute some necessary supplies.” Zhuge Liang here nodded his head rapidly, at the same time saying, “We could hardly have hoped for such kindness.” And Liu Bei saluted with joined hands and said, “This is due to your friendly efforts on our behalf.” “When the brave army arrives, we shall certainly come out to meet it and entertain the soldiers,” said Zhuge Liang. Lu Su felt great satisfaction and was quite happy at his success; he took his leave and went homeward. But Liu Bei as yet did not understand. “What is their intention?” said he. His adviser smiled, saying, “Zhou Yu's end is very near. The ruse he is now trying would not take in a child.” “Why?” “This is the ruse known as 'Borrow a Road to Exterminate the Host.' Under the pretense of taking the west, they intend to capture this place; and when you go out to compliment the army, you will be seized and they will dash into the city which they hope to find unprepared.” “And what are we to do?” “Have no anxiety; all we have to do is to prepare a hidden bow to get the fierce tiger; to spread the enticing bait to hook the great leviathan. Wait till Zhou Yu comes; if he is not killed, he will be nine-tenths a corpse. We will call in Zhao Yun for orders and give him secret instructions, and I will dispose the others.” And Liu Bei was glad. Let Zhou Yu lay what plans he will,"

Yu said, ""Guan Yunchang, the tiger general of the world, sits and accompanies Xuande. , if I attack, he will come to harm me."" Su was stunned. He suddenly reported that Cao Cao sent an envoy to deliver a letter. Yu called in. When the messenger presented the book to read, it was sentenced on the cover: ""The great prime minister of the Han Dynasty pays the governor of Zhou to open it up."" Yu was furious, not even reading it. Su said, ""The two countries are fighting, and the envoy will not be executed."" Yu said, ""The envoy will be executed for demonstration."" Follow Gan Ning as the vanguard, Han Dang as the left wing, and Jiang Qin as the right wing. Yu led the generals to meet him. In the coming days, at the fourth watch, we will cook the meal, and at the fifth watch we will sail the boat, and march in with the drums and shouts.","It is with huge relief that a deeply worried Kong Ming finds Xuande and Guan Yu down by the riverside after the banquet, ready to return to their own army. Suddenly realizing the danger he has been in, Xuande is anxious to have Kong Ming return with him. But Kong Ming replies that ironically he is safer inside the tiger’s mouth than anywhere else! Not long after Xuande leaves, a messenger comes from Cao Cao to deliver a letter to Zhou Yu. On the envelope are the words: ‘The prime minister of the Han grants permission to General Zhou Yu to open this letter.’ The patronizing tone of this absolutely infuriates Zhou Yu, and, without even bothering to read the letter, he rips it into pieces. He then orders that the messenger be beheaded; the head is then given to the poor man’s servant to carry back to Cao Cao. Lu Su is horrified at this breach of protocol and protests strongly. ‘ This shows them,’ says Zhou Yu, ‘that we know we can win.’ Now Zhou makes the final preparations for the attack and commands that Gan Ning lead the assault on Cao Cao.","“Then you had cajoled Liu Bei into coming, why did you not carry out your plan?” asked Lu Su. “Because of that Guan Yu; he is a very tiger, and he never left his brother for a moment. If anything had been attempted, he would certainly have had my life.” Lu Su knew that Zhou Yu spoke the truth. Then suddenly they announced a messenger with a letter from Cao Cao. Zhou Yu ordered them to bring him in and took the letter. But when he saw the superscription “The First Minister of Han to Commander-in-Chief Zhou Yu"", he fell into a frenzy of rage, tore the letter to fragments, and threw them on the ground. “To death with this fellow!” cried he. “When two countries are at war, their emissaries are not slain,” said Lu Su. “Messengers are slain to show one's dignity and independence,” replied Zhou Yu. The unhappy bearer of the letter was decapitated, and his head sent back to Cao Cao by the hands of his escort. Zhou Yu then decided to move. The van under Gan Ning was to advance, supported by two wings led by Han Dang and Jiang Qin. Zhou Yu would lead the center body in support. The next morning the early meal was eaten in the fourth watch, and the ships got under weigh in the fifth with a great beating of drums."

The person said: ""A certain surname is Zhang, his name is Fei, and his word is Yide.

I just saw the public and sighed after reading the list, so I asked each other."" Xuande said: ""I am a family member of the Han family, my surname is Liu, and my name is Bei. Now I hear that the Yellow Turbans are advocating rebellion, and I have the will to destroy the thieves and save the people; How about taking a big event with your master, Yan Yong?"" Xuande was overjoyed, so he went to the village shop with him to drink. In the drinking room, I saw a big man, pushing a car, and stopped at the front of the store. After entering the store and sitting down, he called the bartender: ""Pour wine and eat, I will rush into the city to join the army."" Xuande looked at him Person: nine feet long, beard two feet long: face as heavy as a jujube, lips as smeared; red phoenix eyes, lying silkworm eyebrows: dignified appearance, majestic. Xuande invited him to sit with him and knocked on his name. The person said: ""My surname is Guan, my name is Yu, my word is Changsheng, and later I changed it to Yunchang, and Hedong Jieliang is also a good person in Hedong. Because I was a powerful man at this place, I was killed by me. I fled to the rivers and lakes for five or six years. I heard that the army is recruiting and breaking the thieves here, so I came here to apply."" Xuande then told him with his own will. Cloud grows happy. I went to Zhang Feizhuang together to discuss important matters.","As he is reading it, he sighs deeply. Then, suddenly, a voice behind him asks rather sharply, ‘Why such deep sighs? Surely a true man will serve the emperor at times of such danger.’ Turning round, Xuande finds a man a little taller than him. His forehead is flattened like that of a panther, he has great round eyes, the heavy jowls of a swallow, a great hairy beard and moustache, a voice like thunder and the energy of a prancing horse. ‘Who are you?’ Xuande asks, with a mixture of fear and astonishment. ‘My name,’ he says, ‘is Zhang Fei. For generations we’ve lived here on our farm, trading wine and pork. Now I’m looking for men of true spirit to join me, and when I heard you sighing in front of this proclamation, I decided to have words with you.’ ‘Actually,’ Xuande replies, ‘my name is Xuande, family name Liu, so I’m related to the emperor. When I heard about all the trouble the Yellow Headband rebels were causing, I decided to go and help attack them and protect the people. I was sighing just then because I was worried about whether I could really help. And then you challenged me.’ ‘I’ve contacts that could be used to recruit men from around here,’ says Zhang Fei. ‘So why don’t we work together for this great cause? Now don’t you think that’s a good idea?’ Xuande is delighted, and to celebrate the two go off to an inn. While they are drinking they see an athletic-looking man pushing a wheelbarrow. He stops to rest at the inn. ‘I’m off to volunteer,’ he announces, after brusquely demanding some wine. Xuande studies him with great interest. He is huge, with a two-foot beard and red cheeks. His lips shine, and his eyes are slanted like those of the crimson phoenix, while his bushy eyebrows look like silkworms. With his size and his fearful bearing he is clearly a fighter, and it is no time before Xuande invites him to join them at their table and to tell them who he is. ‘My name is Guan Yu and I’m from Jieliang in Hedong,’ the newcomer says. ‘However, I had to leave there in a hurry after I killed a bully who was terrorizing the local people. I’ve been travelling for about five or six years now. And after I heard about the call to arms I decided to come to join up.’ Xuande fills him in on his own plans, and Guan Yu is delighted. Zhang Fei invites them to leave the inn and go to his manor house nearby to make plans.","The sight of the notice saddened him, and he sighed as he read it. Suddenly a rasping voice behind him cried, “Sir, why sigh if you do nothing to help your country?” Turning quickly he saw standing there a man about his own height, with a bullet head like a leopard's, large eyes, a swallow pointed chin, and whiskers like a tiger's. He spoke in a loud bass voice and looked as irresistible as a dashing horse. At once Liu Bei saw he was no ordinary man and asked who he was. “Zhang Fei is my name,” replied the stranger. “I live near here where I have a farm; and I am a wine seller and a butcher as well; and I like to become acquainted with worthy humans. Your sighs as you read the notice drew me toward you.” Liu Bei replied, “I am of the Imperial Family, Liu Bei is my name. And I wish I could destroy these Yellow Scarves and restore peace to the land, but alas! I am helpless.” “I have the means,” said Zhang Fei. “Suppose you and I raised some troops and tried what we could do.” This was happy news for Liu Bei, and the two betook themselves to the village inn to talk over the project. As they were drinking, a huge, tall fellow appeared pushing a hand-cart along the road. At the threshold he halted and entered the inn to rest awhile and he called for wine. “And be quick,” added he, “for I am in haste to get into the town and offer myself for the army.” Liu Bei looked over the newcomer, item by item, and he noted the man had a huge frame, a long beard, a vivid face like an apple, and deep red lips. He had eyes like a phoenix's and fine bushy eyebrows like silkworms. His whole appearance was dignified and awe-inspiring. Presently, Liu Bei crossed over, sat down beside him and asked his name. “I am Guan Yu,” replied he. “I am a native of the east side of the river, but I have been a fugitive on the waters for some five years, because I slew a ruffian who, since he was powerful, was a bully. I have come to join the army here.” Then Liu Bei told Guan Yu his own intentions, and all three went away to Zhang Fei's farm where they could talk over the grand project."

却說單福正與玄德在寨中議事，忽信風驟起。福曰：“今夜曹仁必來劫寨。”玄德曰：“何以敵之？”福笑曰：“吾已預算定了。”遂密密分撥已畢。至二更，曹仁兵將近寨，只見寨中四圍火起，燒着寨柵。曹仁知有準備，急令退軍。趙雲掩殺將來。仁不及收兵回寨，急望北河而走。將到河邊，纔欲尋船渡河，岸上一彪軍殺到：為首大將，乃張飛也。曹仁死戰，李典保護曹仁下船渡河。曹軍大半淹死水中。曹仁渡過河面，上岸奔至樊城，令人叫門。只見城上一聲鼓響，一將引軍而出，大喝曰：“吾已取樊城多時矣！”衆驚視之：乃關雲長也。仁大驚，撥馬便走。雲長追殺過來。曹仁又折了好些軍馬，星夜投許昌。於路打聽，方知有單福為軍師，設謀定計。,"However, it was said that Shan Fu was discussing matters with Xuande in the village, and suddenly the trade wind suddenly rose. Fu said: ""Tonight Cao Ren will come to rob the village."" Xuande said, ""Why are you fighting against him?"" Fu Xiao said, ""I have already made a budget."" In the second watch, Cao Ren's troops approached the village, and saw fires all around the village, burning the gates of the village. Cao Ren knew that he was ready and ordered the army to retreat. Zhao Yun covered up the future. Ren did not have time to withdraw his troops and return to the village, so he eagerly looked at Beihe and left. When he was about to reach the river, he was about to find a boat to cross the river, but a large army on the bank killed him: the chief general was Zhang Fei. Cao Ren fought to the death, and Li Dian protected Cao Ren from disembarking and crossing the river. Most of Cao's army drowned in the water. Cao Ren crossed the river and went ashore to Fancheng. I saw the sound of drums on the city, and a general led the army out, shouting: ""I have taken Fancheng for a long time!"" Everyone was shocked: it was Guan Yunchang. Ren was startled, plucked the horse and left. Long Yun chased after him. Cao Ren lost many more horses, and cast Xuchang at Xingye. Yu Lu inquired, only to know that Shan Fu was a military adviser and planned a plan.","When Cao Cao decides to attack Xuande and sends his cousin Cao Ren to oversee taking Xinye and capturing Xuande, it is Shan Fu whose advice Xuande follows.","Now as San Fu was discussing plans with his chief a whirlwind from the northeast went by, which San Fu said, “There will be a raid on the camp tonight.” “How shall we meet it?” said Liu Bei. “The plans are quite ready,” was the reply. San Fu whispered them to the chief. So at the second watch, when the enemy arrived, they saw fires on all sides; the stockades and huts burning. Cao Ren understood at once that all hope of a surprise was vain, and he turned to get away as quickly as possible. This was the signal for Zhao Yun to fall on, and that cut Cao Ren's return road. He hastened north toward the river, and reached the bank, but, while waiting for boats to cross the stream, up came Zhang Fei and attacked. By dint of great efforts and with the support of Li Dian, Cao Ren got into a boat, but most of the soldiers were drowned in the stream. As soon as he got to the farther shore, he bolted for Fankou. He reached the wall and hailed the gate, but, instead of a friendly welcome, he heard the rolling of drums, which was soon followed by the appearance of a body of troops. Guan Yu led them. “I took the city a long time ago!” shouted Guan Yu. This was a severe shock to Cao Ren, who turned to flee. As soon as he faced about, Guan Yu attacked and killed many of his force. The remnant hastened to Xuchang. On the road the beaten general wondered who had advised his opponents with such success, and he asked the natives for the answer."
帝乃書密詔付楊彪。彪卽暗使夫人以他事入郭汜府，乘間告汜妻曰：“聞郭將軍與李司馬夫人有染，其情甚密。倘司馬知之，必遭其害。夫人宜絕其往來為妙。”汜妻訝曰：“怪見他經宿不歸！却幹出如此無恥之事！非夫人言，妾不知也。當愼防之。”彪妻告歸，汜妻再三稱謝而別。過了數日，郭汜又將往李傕府中飲宴。妻曰：“傕性不測，況今兩雄不並立，倘彼酒後置毒，妾將奈何？”汜不肯聽，妻再三勸住。至晚間，傕使人送酒筵至。汜妻乃暗置毒於中，方始獻入。汜便欲食。妻曰：“食自外來，豈可便食？”乃先與犬試之，犬立死。自此汜心懷疑。一日朝罷，李傕力邀郭汜赴家飲宴。至夜席散，汜醉而歸，偶然腹痛。妻曰：“必中其毒矣！”急令將糞汁灌之，一吐方定。,"Emperor Nai Shu secretly ordered to pay Yang Biao. Biao Xi secretly sent his wife to enter Guo Si's mansion with other affairs, and told his wife: ""I heard that General Guo has an affair with Mrs. Li Sima, and their relationship is very close. If Sima knows about it, he will definitely be harmed. The wife should stop her from contacting him. That's great."" Si's wife was surprised and said, ""It's strange that he did not return from his home! But he did such a shameless thing! It's not what the wife said, and the concubine doesn't know. You should guard against it."" Biao's wife returned, and Si's wife repeatedly thanked her do not. A few days later, Guo Si will go to Li Jue's mansion for a banquet. The wife said: ""The nature of Jue is unpredictable, and now the two males are not standing side by side. If he drinks poison, what will the concubine do?"" Si refused to listen, and his wife repeatedly persuaded him to stop. In the evening, Jui sent people to bring a wine feast. Si's wife secretly put poison in it, and then she donated it. Si will want to eat. The wife said: ""The food comes from outside, how can you eat it?"" She tried it with the dog first, and the dog died immediately. Since then, I have been suspicious. At the end of the day, Li Jue invited Guo Si to his house for a banquet. At night, the feast was scattered, and he returned home drunk, with occasional abdominal pain. The wife said, ""It must be poisoned!"" He urgently ordered to pour the dung juice into it and spit it out.","Such is the state of affairs when Yang Biao, one of the ministers, comes up with a plan. Knowing that Guo Si ’s wife is very jealous, he decides to exploit this. He also knows that most evenings Li Jue and Guo Si dine together to discuss matters, often drinking and talking late into the evening. He sets out to cause a rupture in the relationship between them. Yang Biao’s plan is to send his wife, the Lady Yang, to visit the wife of Guo Si, Lady Guo, and to sow the seeds of distrust. During the conversation Lady Yang lets slip that she understands that Guo Si is having an affair with the wife of Li Jue. ‘Imagine, my lady,’ says Lady Yang, ‘if Li finds out! You must do all in your power to stop your husband having this affair.’","So Yang Biao received instruction to act, with a secret edict to support him. Yang Biao's wife, Lady Kai, made an excuse to visit Lady Qiong at her palace and, in the course of conversation, said “There is talk of secret liaison between the General, your husband, and the wife of Minister Li Jue. It is a great secret, but if Minister Li Jue knew it, he might try to harm your husband. I think you ought to have very little to do with that family.” Lady Qiong was surprised but said, “I have wondered why he has been sleeping away from home lately, but I did not think there was anything shameful connected with it. I should never have known if you had not spoken. I must put a stop to it.” By and by, when Lady Kai took her leave; Lady Qiong thanked her warmly for the information she had given. Some days passed, and Guo Si was going over to the dwelling of Li Jue to a dinner. Lady Qiong did not wish him to go and she said, “This Li Jue is very deep, and one cannot fathom his designs. You two are not of equal rank, and if he made away with you, what would become of your poor handmaid?” Guo Si paid no attention, and his wife could not prevail on him to stay at home. Late in the afternoon some presents arrived from Li Jue's palace, and Lady Qiong secretly put poison into the delicacies before she set them before her lord. Guo Si was going to taste at once but she said, “It is unwise to consume things that come from outside. Let us try on a dog first.” They did and the dog died. This incident made Guo Si doubt the kindly intentions of his colleague. One day, at the close of business at court, Li Jue invited Guo Si to his palace. After Guo Si arrived home in the evening, rather the worse for too much wine, he was seized with a colic. His wife said she suspected poison and hastily administered an emetic, which relieved the pain."
操視之，乃袁紹手下舊將焦觸、張南也。操曰：“汝等皆生長北方，恐乘舟不便。江南之兵，往來水上，習練精熟，汝勿輕以性命為兒戲也。”焦觸、張南大叫曰：“如其不勝，甘受軍法。”操曰：“戰船盡已連鎖，惟有小舟。每舟可容二十人，只恐未便接戰。”觸曰：“若用大船，何足為奇？乞付小舟二十餘隻。某與張南各引一半，只今日直抵江南水寨，須要奪旗斬將而還。”操曰：“吾與汝二十隻船，差撥精銳軍五百人，皆長鎗硬弩。到來日天明，將大寨船出到江面上，遠為之勢。更差文聘亦領三十隻巡船接應汝回。”焦觸、張南欣喜而退。次日四更造飯，五更結束已定，早聽得水寨中擂鼓鳴金。船皆出寨，分布水面。長江一帶，靑紅旗號交雜。焦觸、張南領哨船二十隻，穿寨而出，望江南進發。,"They were Yuan Shao's old generals Jiao Touch and Zhang Nan. Cao said: ""You all grew up in the north, and I'm afraid that it will be inconvenient to ride a boat. The soldiers in the south of the Yangtze River travel on and off the water, and they are skilled. You should not take your life as a child's play."" Cao said, ""All the battleships have been chained together, but there are only small boats. Each boat can hold 20 people, so I'm afraid we won't be able to engage in battle."" Chu said, ""If a big boat is used, why is it surprising? I beg for more than 20 boats. Only. A certain and Zhang Nan each lead half, only today they will reach the Jiangnan Water Village, and they need to capture the flag and behead the generals and return them."" Cao said: ""I and you have twenty ships and dispatched five hundred elite troops, all of whom have long spears. Crossbow. When dawn comes, the Dazhai boat will be brought out to the river, which is far from the trend. Even worse, Wen Ping will also lead 30 patrol boats to meet you back."" Jiao Touch and Zhang Nan happily retreated. The next day at the fourth watch, the meal was made, and the end of the fifth watch was set. I could hear the drums beating in the water village. The boats are all out of the village and distributed on the water. The Yangtze River area is mixed with red flags. Jiao Touch and Zhang Nan led 20 sentry boats and went out through the village, looking south to the south of the Yangtze River.","Even when Cheng Yu suggests that this might put the ships at risk of contagious fire, Cao Cao dismisses this, pointing out that the wind is blowing in the wrong direction because it is that time of the year. The sound of the war drums reaches Zhou Yu and his men on the south bank, and they prepare for action.","The speakers were two men who had served under Yuan Shao, named Jiao Chu and Zhang Nan. “I do not think naval work would suit you two, born and brought up in the north,” said Cao Cao. “The southern soldiers are thoroughly accustomed to ships. You should not regard your lives as a child's plaything.” They cried, “If we fail, treat us according to army laws!” “The fighting ships are all chained together, there are only small, twenty-men boats free. They are unsuitable for fighting.” “If we took large ships, where would be the wonderful in what we will do? No; give us a score of the small ships, and we will take half each and go straight to the enemy's naval port. We will just seize a flag, slay a leader, and come home.” “I will let you have the twenty ships and five hundred of good, vigorous troops with long spears and stiff crossbows. Early tomorrow the main fleet shall make a demonstration on the river, and I will also tell Wen Ping to support you with thirty ships.” The two men retired greatly elated. Next morning, very early, food was prepared, and at the fifth watch all was ready for a start. Then from the naval camp rolled out the drums and the gongs clanged, as the ships moved out and took up their positions, the various flags fluttering in the morning breeze. And the two intrepid leaders with their squadron of small scouting boats went down the lines and out into the stream."

Yu said: ""The public will come at night, and there must be a good plan to see and teach."" Gai said: ""They are many and I am few, and it is not suitable for them to last for a long time. Why not attack them with fire?"" Yu said: ""Who will teach the public to offer this plan?"" Gai Said: ""Someone's own intentions are not taught by others."" Yu said: ""I just want to do this, so I left Cai Zhong, Cai and the people who cheated surrender to pass the news; but I hate that no one will cheat for me. Gai said, ""Someone is willing to do this."" Yu said, ""How can he be willing to believe if he doesn't suffer some hardships?"" Gai said, ""Someone has received the generous kindness of Sun's family. And Xie Zhi said: ""If you are willing to carry out this bitter plan, then Jiangdong will be very lucky."" Gai said: ""There is no resentment in the death of a certain person."" Then he thanked him.","One night Huang Gai secretly comes to see Zhou Yu, advocating the use of fire to destroy the enemy’s fleet. Zhou Yu asks him if he is willing to undertake a dangerous exploit to help overcome Cao Cao, and Huang Gai is adamant that he will do anything he can.","That night as Zhou Yu was sitting in his tent, Huang Gai came to see him privately. Zhou Yu said, “You have surely some wise plan to propose that you come at night like this.” Huang Gai replied, “The enemy are more numerous than we, and it is wrong to delay. Why not burn them out?” “Who suggested that to you?” “I thought of it myself, nobody suggested it,” replied Huang Gai. “I just wanted something like this, and that is why I kept those two pretended deserters. I want them to give some false news. The pity is that I have no one to feign desertion to the other side and work my plan.” “But I will carry out your plan,” said Huang Gai. “But if you cannot show some injury, you will not be believed,” said Zhou Yu. “The Sun family have been very generous to me, and I would not resent being crushed to death to repay them,” said Huang Gai. The General thanked him saying, “If you would not object to some bodily suffering, then our country would indeed be happy.” “Kill me; I do not mind,” repeated Huang Gai as he took his leave."

Guan Gong said: ""Nevertheless, please temporarily ask the Prime Minister to withdraw from the army, allow me to enter the city to see the second sister-in-law, tell her about it, and then surrender."" Zhang Liao returned again and reported Cao Cao with this statement. Cao You gave an order to retreat thirty li. Xun Yu said, ""No: I'm afraid of cheating."" Cao said, ""Yunchang, a righteous man, will not lose his trust."" Then he led the army back. Guan Gong led troops into Xiapi and saw that the people were safe and sound; he actually went to the mansion to see the second sister-in-law. Mrs. Gan and Mi heard that Guan Gong was coming, and rushed out to welcome him. The duke bowed at the foot of the steps and said, ""It's a crime to frighten the second sister-in-law."" The second lady said, ""Where is Uncle Huang now?"" The duke said, ""I don't know where to go."" The Duke said: ""A certain Guan went out of the city to fight to the death and was trapped in the mountains. Zhang Liao advised me to surrender, and I made an agreement on three things. Cao Cao has already agreed, so he retreated and let me into the city. The second lady asked, ""Those three things?"" Guan Gong recounted the three things above. Mrs. Gan said, ""Yesterday when Cao's army entered the city, we all thought we would die. Whoever wants to stay unscathed will not dare to enter the army. Uncle Yan has already accepted the promise. Said: ""Sister-in-law, don't worry, Guan has his own opinion."" The second lady said, ""Uncle has his own judgement, so you don't have to ask my daughter about everything.""","When Zhang Liao reports back to Cao Cao, he doesn’t want to agree to the third condition. But Zhang Liao points out that if Cao Cao can prove to be even more honourable than Xuande, he might win Guan Yu’s loyalty.","Whereupon Zhang Liao left to carry the news to Guan Yu, still on the summit of the Tushan Mountains. “Now I expect the army to withdraw so that I may enter the city to tell the two ladies what has been arranged. After that I submit at once.” Zhang Liao rode back once more with this request, and the order was given for the army to retire three miles. “Do not do this,” said Xun Yu. “I fear treachery.” “He will certainly not break faith,” said Cao Cao. “He is too high principled.” The army retired and Guan Yu with his force reentered the city of Xiapi, where he saw that the people were following their ordinary avocations in tranquillity. He came to the palace and went in to see the two ladies, who hastened to meet him. He bowed to them below the steps and said, “I apologize for having caused you to feel alarmed.” “Where is the Uncle?” asked they. “I know not whither he has gone.” “What do you intend to do, Brother-in-Law?” “I went out of the city to try a last battle. I was surrounded on a hill top, and Zhang Liao has urged me to yield. I proposed three conditions, all of which were conceded, and the enemy drew off to allow me to return to the city. Unless I have your decision, Sisters-in-Law, I scarcely dare to take any final step.” They asked what were the conditions and were told. Lady Gan said, “When Cao Cao's army came in, we took it to mean certain death. But it is scarcely credible that not a hair of our heads has been disturbed; not a soldier has dared enter our doors. You have accepted the conditions, Brother-in-Law, and there is no need to ask our consent. Our only fear is that he will not let you go by and by to search for the Uncle.” “Sisters-in-Law, you need not be anxious. I will see to that.” “You must decide everything and need not ask us.”"

One day, the jailer came to see Feng and said, ""Farewell to congratulate him."" Feng said, ""Why are you happy?"" The jailer said, ""General Yuan has returned from a great defeat, and you must see it seriously."" Feng smiled and said, ""I will die today. It’s over!” The jailer asked, “Everyone is happy for you, so why do you want to die?” Feng said, “General Yuan is lenient on the outside but jealous on the inside, and doesn’t want to be loyal. If you win and you are happy, you can still forgive me; I'm ashamed, I don't want to live anymore."" The prison guard didn't believe it. Suddenly, the messenger arrived with a sword and passed Yuan Shao's order to take Tian Feng's head, and the jailer was startled. Feng said, ""I know that I must die."" The prison guards were all in tears. Feng said: ""A great man was born between heaven and earth, and doing things without knowing his master is ignorant! What a pity for a husband to die today!"" He killed himself in prison. A later poem says:","Yuan Shao eventually manages to escape from the enemy troops, and soon his shattered forces are regrouping ready to march home to Jizhou.","Meanwhile Tian Feng's gaoler came to him one day, saying, “Above all humans I felicitate you.” “What is the joyful occasion and why felicitate?” said Tian Feng. The gaoler replied, “Imperial Protector Yuan Shao has been defeated and is on his way back; he will treat you with redoubled respect.” “Now am I a dead man!” said Tian Feng. “Why say you that, Sir, when all people give you joy?” “The Imperial Protector appears liberal, but he is jealous and forgetful of honest advice. Had he been victorious, he might have pardoned me; now that he has been defeated and put to shame, I may not hope to live.” But the gaoler did not believe Tian Feng. Before long came the letter and the sword with the fatal order. The gaoler was dismayed, but the victim said, “I knew all too well that I should have to die.” The gaoler wept. Tian Feng said, “An able person born into this world who does not recognize and serve the right lord is ignorant.

袁紹旣死，審配等主持喪事。劉夫人便將袁紹所愛寵妾五人，盡行殺害；又恐其陰魂於九泉之下再與紹相見，乃髠其髮，刺其面，毁其屍：其妒惡如此。袁尚恐寵妾家屬為害，并收而殺之。審配、逢紀立袁尚為大司馬將軍，領冀、靑、幽、并四州牧，遺使報喪。此時袁譚已發兵離靑州；知父死，便與郭圖、辛評商議。圖曰：“主公不在冀州，審配、逢紀必立顯甫為主矣。當速行。”辛評曰：“審、逢二人，必預定機謀。今若速往，必遭其禍。”袁譚曰：“若此當何如？”郭圖曰：“可屯兵城外，觀其動靜。某當親往察之。”譚依言。郭圖遂入冀州，見袁尚。禮畢，尚問：“兄何不至？”圖曰：“因抱病在軍中，不能相見。”尚曰：“吾受父親遺命，立我為主，加兄為車騎將軍。目下曹軍壓境，請兄為前部，吾隨後便調兵接應也。”圖曰：“軍中無人商議良策，願乞審正南、逢元圖二人為輔。”尚曰：“吾亦欲仗此二人早晚畫策，如何離得？”圖曰：“然則於二人內遣一人去，何如？”尚不得已，乃令二人拈鬮，拈着者便去。逢紀拈着，尚卽命逢紀齎印綬，同郭圖赴袁譚軍中。紀隨圖至譚軍，見譚無病，心中不安，獻上印綬。譚大怒，欲斬逢紀。郭圖密諫曰：“今曹軍壓境，且只款留逢紀在此，以安尚心。待破曹之後，却來爭冀州不遲。”,"Yuan Shaoyi died, and Shen Pei and others presided over the funeral. Mrs. Liu killed all five of Yuan Shao's favorite concubines; fearing that their ghosts would meet Shao again under Jiuquan, she stabbed her hair, stabbed her in the face, and destroyed her corpse: she was jealous and hated like this. Yuan Shang feared that his concubine's family would be harmed, and he took her and killed her. Shen Pei and Feng Ji set up Yuan Shang as the general of the Great Sima, leading Ji, Ji, You, and the four prefectures, and leaving an envoy to report the mourning. At this time, Yuan Tan had already sent troops to leave the state; knowing that his father was dead, he discussed with Guo Tu and Xin Ping. The picture said: ""The lord is not in Jizhou, and the judge will be the master of the match and the discipline. You should hurry."" Xin Ping said: ""The trial and meeting two people will definitely plan a plan. If you go quickly now, you will suffer disaster. ""Yuan Tan said: ""What if this is what?"" Guo Tu said: ""You can station troops outside the city and watch their movements. You should go and observe them in person."" Tan Yiyan said. Guo Tu then entered Jizhou and met Yuan Shang. When the ceremony was over, Shang asked, ""Why didn't you come?"" The picture said, ""Because I am in the army because of illness, I cannot see each other."" Shang said, ""I have been ordered by my father to make me the master, and my brother to be the general of chariots and cavalry. Cao's army is pressing down on the border, and I ask my brother to be the front, and I will then transfer troops to respond."" The picture said: ""No one in the army has discussed a good strategy, and I would like to ask Zhengnan and Feng Yuantu to be the assistants."" Shang said: ""I also want to fight. How will the two of them be separated sooner or later?"" The picture said, ""How about sending one of the two to go?"" As a last resort, he ordered the two to cast lots, and the one who took it would go. When Feng Ji was handed in, Shang You ordered Feng Ji to seal the ribbon and go to Yuan Tan's army with Guo Tu. Ji Suitu went to Tan Jun, and when he saw that Tan was not ill, he felt uneasy and presented his seal. Tan was furious and wanted to kill Feng Ji. Guo Tumi admonished: ""Now Cao's army is pressing down on the territory, and only the money is left here for the discipline, so as to be safe. After Cao is defeated, it will not be too late to come to fight for Jizhou.""","As soon as he is dead, his widow has her son Yuan Shang installed as ruler. She murders her husband’s five concubines, even going so far as to mutilate their dead bodies so they cannot follow him into the Underworld. Yuan Shang’s only serious rival is his brother Yuan Tan. Fearful of him, when his brother asks for reinforcements to fight Cao Cao, Yuan Shang sends such a pathetically small force it is swiftly wiped out by Cao Cao’s men.","Shen Pei and some others set about the mourning ceremonies for the dead man. His wife, Lady Liu, put to death five of his favorite concubines, and such was the bitterness of her jealousy that, not content with this , she shaved off the hair and slashed the faces of their poor corpses lest their spirits should meet and rejoin her late husband in the land of shades beneath the Nine Golden Springs. Her son followed up this piece of cruelty by slaying all the relatives of the unhappy concubines lest they should avenge their death. Shen Pei and Peng Ji declared Yuan Shang successor with the titles of Regent Marshal and Supreme Imperial Protector of the four regions of Jizhou, Qingzhou, Youzhou, and Bingzhou and sent in a report of the death of the late Imperial Protector. At this time Yuan Tan, the eldest son, had already marched out his army to oppose Cao Cao; but hearing of his father's death, he called in Guo Tu and Xin Ping to consult as to his course of action. “In your absence, my lord,” said Guo Tu, “the two advisers of your younger brother will certainly set him up as lord, wherefore you must act quickly.” “Those two, Shen Pei and Peng Ji, have already laid their plans,” said Xin Ping. “If you go, you will meet with some misfortune.” “Then what should I do?” asked Yuan Tan. Guo Tu replied, “Go and camp near the city, and watch what is taking place while I enter and inquire.” Accordingly Guo Tu entered the city and sought an interview with the young Imperial Protector. “Why did not my brother come?” asked Yuan Shang after the usual salutes. Guo Tu said, “He cannot come as he is in the camp unwell.” “By the command of my late father I take the lordship. Now I confer upon my brother the rank of General of the Flying Cavalry, and I wish him to go at once to attack Cao Cao, who is pressing on the borders. I will follow as soon as my army is in order.” “There is no one in our camp to give advice,” said Guo Tu. “I wish to have the services of Shen Pei and Peng Ji.” “I also need the help of these two,” said Yuan Shang. “And as I am always working at schemes, I do not see how I can do without them.” “Then let one of these two go,” replied Guo Tu. Yuan Shang could do no other than accede to this request, so he bade the two men cast lots who should go. Peng Ji drew the lot and was appointed, receiving a seal of office. Then he accompanied Guo Tu to the camp. But when he arrived and found Yuan Tan in perfect health, he grew suspicious and resigned. Yuan Tan angrily refused to accept his resignation and was disposed to put him to death, but Guo Tu privately dissuaded him, saying, “Cao Cao is on the borders, and Peng Ji must be kept here to allay your brother's suspicions. After we have beaten Cao Cao, we can at once make an attempt on Jizhou.”"

操從其言，分軍三隊，來至濮陽城下。操先往觀之，見城上遍豎旗旛，西門角上，有一“義”字白旗，心中暗喜。是日午牌，城門開處，兩員將引軍出戰：前軍侯成，後軍高順。操卽使典韋出馬，直取侯成。侯成抵敵不過，回馬望城中走。韋趕到弔橋邊，高順亦攔擋不住，都退入城中去了。數內有軍人乘勢混過陣來見操，說是田氏之使，呈上密書。約云：“今夜初更時分，城上鳴鑼為號，便可進兵。某當獻門。”操撥夏侯惇引軍在左、曹洪引軍在右，自己引夏侯淵、李典、樂進、典韋四將，率兵入城。李典曰：“主公且在城外，容某等先入城去。”操喝曰：“我不自往，誰肯向前！”遂當先領兵直入。時約初更，月光未上。只聽得西門上吹蠃殼聲，喊聲忽起，門上火把燎亂，城門大開，弔橋放落。曹操爭先拍馬而入。直到州衙，路上不見一人。操知是計，忙撥回馬，大叫：“退兵！”州衙中一聲礮響，四門烈火，轟天而起；金鼓齊鳴，喊聲如江翻海沸。東巷內轉出張遼，西巷內轉出臧霸，夾攻掩殺。操走北門，道傍轉出郝萌、曹性，又殺一陣。操急走南門，高順、侯成攔住。典韋怒目咬牙，衝殺出去。高順、侯成倒走出城。典韋殺到弔橋，回頭不見了曹操，翻身復殺入城來，門下撞着李典。典韋問：“主公何在？”典曰：“吾亦尋不見。”韋曰：“汝在城外催救軍，我入去尋主公。”李典去了。典韋殺入城中，尋覓不見；再殺出城壕邊，撞着樂進。進曰：“主公何在？”韋曰：“我往復兩遭，尋覓不見。”進曰：“同殺入去救主！”兩人到門邊，城上火礮滾下，樂進馬不能入，典韋冒煙突火，又殺入去，到處尋覓。,"Cao followed his words and divided his army into three teams and arrived at Puyang City. Cao went to look at it first, and saw that flags were erected all over the city, and there was a white flag with the word ""righteousness"" on the corner of the west gate, and he was secretly happy. On the day of the afternoon card, the gates of the city were opened, and two generals would lead the army into battle: Hou Cheng of the former army, and Gao Shun of the latter army. Cao Cao envoy Dian Wei to go out and take Hou Cheng directly. Hou Cheng was unable to defeat the enemy, so he returned to Mawang City. Wei rushed to the drawbridge, but Gao Shun couldn't stop him, so they all retreated into the city. A few soldiers took advantage of the situation and came to see Cao, saying that it was the envoy of the Tian family, and presented a secret letter. About the cloud: ""Tonight at the beginning of the shift, the gong on the city will sound the horn, and the troops will be able to advance. One should offer a door."" Cao Cao Hong led the army to the left, and Cao Hong led the army to the right, and led Xiahou Yuan, Li Dian, and Le Jin by himself. , Dian Wei, four generals, led his troops into the city. Li Dian said: ""My lord is outside the city, Rong Mou and the others will enter the city first."" Cao shouted: ""I don't want to go, who is willing to go forward!"" So he should lead the troops straight in. It's about the beginning of the time, and the moonlight has not yet come. All I could hear was the sound of husks blowing on the west gate, and the shouting suddenly started, the fire on the gate was chaotic, the city gate was wide open, and the drawbridge was set down. Cao Cao scrambled to get in first. Until the prefecture, there was no one on the road. Cao knew it was a trick, hurriedly called back the horse, and shouted: ""Retreat!"" There was a sound in the prefectural government, and the four gates were raging, and the golden drums rang in unison, and the shouts were like a river rolling over the sea. Zhang Liao was transferred out of the east lane, and Zang Ba was transferred out of the west lane, attacking and covering up. Cao walked away from the north gate, turned out Hao Meng and Cao Xing, and killed them for a while. He rushed to the south gate, but Gao Shun and Hou Cheng stopped him. Dian Wei gritted his teeth angrily and rushed out. Gao Shun and Hou Cheng walked out of the city. Dian Wei reached the drawbridge, turned around and disappeared from Cao Cao, turned over and rushed into the city, hitting Li Dian under the door. Dian Wei asked, ""Where is the lord?"" Dian said, ""I can't find it either."" Wei said, ""You are urging rescue troops outside the city, and I will go in to find the lord."" Li Dian went. Dian Wei rushed into the city, but he couldn't find it; then he rushed out of the moat and bumped into Le Jin. Jin said, ""Where is the lord?"" Wei said, ""I went back and forth twice, but I couldn't find it."" Jin said, ""We went in together and went to the savior!"" The two of them reached the door, and the fire on the city rolled down, and Lejin's horse couldn't find it. Entering, Dian Wei smoked and burst into flames, then rushed in again, looking everywhere.","It claims to come from one of the most influential citizens of Puyang and says that Lü Bu and his forces have left, and the city is ready to be taken. Fooled by this letter, Cao Cao is lured into what appears to be an almost empty city. But no sooner is he well inside than the trap is sprung. From every direction, from north and south, from east and west, Lü Bu’s men emerge from hiding and bear down upon the enemy troops. In desperation, as his army is annihilated around him, Cao Cao dashes from to gate to gate, trying to escape. No matter which of the city gates, north or south, he tries, Lü Bu’s men drive him back. Realizing what is happening, Cao’s generals try to break through to rescue him but are driven back. Now in utter despair Cao Cao tries once more to escape by slipping through the north gate. As he approaches, who should ride up but Lü Bu. Covering his face, Cao Cao hopes he will not be spotted. Imagine his horror when Lü Bu actually rides up and bangs him on his helmet with his halberd and asks where Cao Cao is! Cao Cao points to a horse and rider disappearing into the distance and says, ‘That’s him up there, sir’. Lü Bu rides off in hot pursuit, and Cao Cao turns and rides for his life towards the east gate.","He went to Puyang, which he found gay with fluttering flags. Looking carefully he saw among them, at the west gate, the white flag with the looked-for inscription. His heart rejoiced. That day, just about noon, the city gates opened, and two bodies of soldiers appeared as if to fight. Gao Shun was the front commander, and Hou Cheng the rear commander. Cao Cao told off his general, Dian Wei, to oppose them. Neither body, however, came on to full engagement but fell back into the city. By this move Dian Wei and his troops had been drawn close up to the drawbridge. From within the city several soldiers were seen taking any chance of confusion to escape and come outside. To Cao Cao they said, “We are clients of the Tian family,” and they gave him secret letters stating: “The signal will be given about the first watch setting by beating a gong. That will be the time to attack. The gates will be opened.” So Cao Cao ordered Xiahou Dun to march to the left and Cao Hong to the right. Cao Cao led the main army—together with Xiahou Yuan, Li Dian, and Yue Jin—into the city. Li Dian pressed upon his master the precaution, saying, “My lord should stay outside the city; let us go in first.” But Cao Cao bade him be silent, saying, “If I do not go, who will advance?” And so at the first watch Cao Cao led the way. The moon had not yet arisen. As he drew near the west gate, they heard a crackling sound, then a loud shouting, and then torches moved hither and thither. Next the gates were thrown wide open, and Cao Cao, whipping up his steed, galloped in. But when he reached the state residence, he noticed the streets were quite deserted, and then he knew he had been tricked. Wheeling round his horse, he shouted to his followers to retire. This was the signal for another move. An explosion of a signal bomb was heard close at hand, and it was echoed from every side in a deafening roar. Gongs and drums beat all around with a roar like rivers rushing backward to their source, and the ocean boiling up from its depths. From two sides east and west came bodies of soldiers eager to attack, led by Lu Bu's generals Zhang Liao and Zang Ba. Cao Cao dashed off toward the north only to find his way barred by Hao Meng and Cao Xing. Cao Cao tried for the south gate, but met enemies led by Gao Shun and Hou Cheng. Cao Cao's trusty commander Dian Wei, with fierce eyes and gritting teeth, at last burst through and got out, with the enemy close after him. But when Dian Wei reached the drawbridge, he glanced behind him and missed his master. Immediately Dian Wei turned back and cut an arterial alley inside. Just within he met Li Dian. “Where is our lord?” cried Dian Wei. “I am looking for him,” said Li Dian. “Quick! Get help from outside,” shouted Dian Wei. “I will seek him.” So Li Dian hastened for aid, and Dian Wei slashed his way in, looking on every side for Cao Cao. He was not to be found. Dashing out of the city, Dian Wei ran up against Yue Jin, who asked where their lord was. “I have entered the city twice in search of him, but cannot find him,” said Dian Wei. “Let us go in together,” said Yue Jin. They rode up to the gate. But the noise of bombs from the gate tower frightened Yue Jin's horse so that it refused to pass. Wherefore Dian Wei alone went in, butting through the smoke and dashing through the flames. But he got in and searched on every side."
張飛領了言語，與孫乾前至耒陽縣。軍民官吏，皆出郭迎接，獨不見縣令。飛問曰：“縣令何在？”同僚覆曰：“龐縣令自到任及今，將百餘日，縣中之事，並不理問，每日飲酒，自旦及夜，只在醉鄕。今日宿酒未醒，猶臥不起。”張飛大怒，欲擒之。孫乾曰：“龐士元乃高明之人，未可輕忽。且到縣問之。如果於理不當，治罪未晚。”飛乃入縣，正廳上坐定，敎縣令來見。統衣冠不整，扶醉而出。飛怒曰：“吾兄以汝為人，令作縣宰，汝焉敢盡廢縣事？”統笑曰：“將軍以吾廢了縣中何事？”飛曰：“汝到任百餘日，終日在醉鄕，安得不廢政事？”統曰：“量百里小縣，些小公事，何難決斷？將軍少坐，待我發落。”隨卽喚公吏，將百餘日所積公務，都取來剖斷，吏皆紛然齎抱案卷上廳，訴詞被告人等，環跪階下。統手中批判，口中發落，耳內聽詞，曲直分明，並無分毫差錯。民皆叩首拜伏。不到半日，將百餘日之事，盡斷畢了，投筆於地而對張飛曰：“所廢之事何在？曹操、孫權，吾視之若掌上觀文，量此小縣，何足介意！”飛大驚，下席謝曰：“先生大才，小子失敬。吾當於兄長處極力舉薦。”統乃將出魯肅薦書。飛曰：“先生初見吾兄，何不將出？”統曰：“若便將出，似乎專藉薦書來干謁矣。”飛顧謂孫乾曰：“非公則失一大賢也。”遂辭統回荊州見玄德，具說龐統之才。玄德大驚曰：“屈待大賢，吾之過也！”飛將魯肅薦書呈上。玄德拆視之。書略曰：,"Zhang Fei took the words and went to Leiyang County with Sun Qianqian. Military and civilian officials all went out to meet Guo, but the county magistrate was not seen. Fei asked, ""Where is the magistrate?"" The colleague replied, ""The magistrate Pang has been in office for more than 100 days and has been ignoring the affairs of the county. Drunk. I haven't woken up from the hangover today, and I still can't afford to lie down."" Zhang Fei was furious and wanted to capture him. Sun Qian said: ""Pang Shiyuan is a brilliant person, and he should not be ignored. Let's go to the county and ask him. If the reason is inappropriate, it will not be too late to punish him."" Tong was disheveled and came out drunk. Fei said angrily: ""My brother takes you as a person and makes him the county chief, how dare you do everything in the county?"" Tong laughed and said, ""What is the matter in the county that the general has abolished with me?"" Fei said: ""You have served more than a hundred times. I am drunk all day long, how can I not abolish government affairs?"" Tong said, ""How can it be difficult to make a decision about a small county of a hundred miles and some small public affairs? The general sits down and waits for me to deal with it."" Collecting official business, they are all taken to dissect, and the officials are all holding the case file and going to the hall, complaining about the defendant, etc., and knelt down the steps. Criticism in Tong's hands, hair and fall in his mouth, and words in his ears, the words are straight and clear, and there is no mistake. The people all bowed their heads and bowed. In less than half a day, the matter of more than 100 days was finished, and he put a pen on the ground and said to Zhang Fei: ""What is the matter that has been abolished? Cao Cao and Sun Quan. Don't mind me!"" Fei was shocked, and thanked him from the table, ""Sir, you are a talented man, but this kid is disrespectful. I should highly recommend it to my elder brother."" Fei said, ""Sir, when I first saw my brother, why don't you go out?"" Tong said, ""If you are going to go out, it seems that you only borrow the recommendation book to make an audience."" Fei Gu said to Sun Qian, ""If you don't go public, you will lose a great sage."" Then he went back to Jingzhou to see Xuande, saying that Pang Tong was talented. Xuande was shocked and said, ""It's my fault to treat Daxian humbly!"" Fei General Lu Su's recommendation letter was presented. Xuande looked at it. The book says:","Furious at this further indication of this man’s offhand manner, Xuande sends Zhang Fei to investigate, along with Sun Qian, to ensure Zhang Fei doesn’t go off the deep end. The pair arrive and ask where the magistrate is, only to be told that he is sleeping off a very drunken night before. Zhang Fei is furious at this and is all for dragging the man out of bed, but Sun Qian reminds him that this is no ordinary man and they should wait. Their patience is rewarded – well sort of – when a little while later a dishevelled and clearly hung-over Pang Tong strolls in. ‘You were given responsibilities by my brother,’ says Zhang Fei, ‘and you’ve treated them with nothing less than wanton neglect.’ ‘What precisely,’ answers Pang Tong, ‘have I neglected?’ ‘Why, you’ve been here for a hundred days and have done nothing but get drunk! How can you possibly govern in that state?’ ‘To be honest,’ replies Pang Tong, ‘this is a very small place with not much going on, and even that requires very little action. However, wait here, and I’ll deal with that.’ All the cases that have piled up during his hundred days are brought before him – supplicants, defendants and so forth. Within the space of half a day he not only deals with them all but does so to the outright approval of all. Even Zhang Fei has to admit he is impressed. Only then, to Zhang Fei’s astonishment, does Pang Tong bring out the letter of recommendation from Lu Su. Returning to Xuande, they report on what has happened and show the letter from Lu Su. Xuande begins to realize that his judging by appearances has very nearly lost him a great man.","In due course the inquisitors arrived at Leiyang, where they were received by the officials and welcomed by the people at the boundary. But the Magistrate did not appear. “Where is the Magistrate?” asked Zhang Fei. “Ever since his arrival, a hundred days ago and more, he has attended to no business, but spends his days from morn to night in wine-bobbing and is always intoxicated. Just now he is sleeping off a debauch and is not yet risen.” This raised Zhang Fei's choler, and he would have dismissed the offender forthwith had not his colleague said, “Pang Tong is a man of great ability, and it would be wrong to deal with him thus summarily. Let us inquire into it. If he is really so guilty, we will punish his offense.” So they went to the magistracy, took their seats in the hail of justice, and summoned the Magistrate before them. He came with dress all disordered and still under the influence of wine. “My brother took you for a decent person,” said Zhang Fei, angrily, “and sent you here as magistrate. How dare you throw the affairs of the county into disorder?” “Do you think I have done as you say, General?” said Pang Tong. “What affairs have I disordered?” “You have been here over a hundred days and spent the whole time in dissipation. Is not that disorderly?” “Where would be the difficulty in dealing with the business of a trifling county like this? I pray you, General, sit down for a while till I have settled the cases.” Thereupon Pang Tong bade the clerks bring in all the arrears and he would settle them at once. So they brought in the piles of papers and ordered the suitors to appear. They came and knelt in the hall while the magistrate, brush in hand, noted this and minuted that, all the while listening to the pleadings. Soon all the difficulties and disputes were adjusted, and never a mistake was made, as the satisfied bows of the people proved. By midday the whole of the cases were disposed of, and the arrears of the hundred days settled and decided. This done, the Magistrate threw aside his pen and turned to the inquisitors, saying, “Where is the disorder? When I can take on Cao Cao and Sun Quan as easily as I can read this paper, what attention from me is needed for the business of this paltry place?” Zhang Fei was astonished at the man's ability, rose from his seat, and crossed over, saying, “You are indeed a marvel, Master. I have not treated you respectfully enough, but now I shall commend you to my brother with all my might.” Then Pang Tong drew forth Lu Su's letter and showed it to Zhang Fei. “Why did you not show this to my brother when you first saw him?” asked Zhang Fei. “If I had had a chance, I would have done so. But is it likely that one would just take advantage of a letter of commendation to make a visit?” Zhang Fei turned to his colleague and said, “You just saved a wise man for us.” Sun Qian and Zhang Fei left the magistracy and returned to Liu Bei to whom they related what had happened. Liu Bei then seemed to be conscious of his error and said, “I have been wrong; I have behaved unjustly to a sage.” Zhang Fei then gave his brother the letter in which Lu Su had recommended Pang Tong. Opening it he read:"
候至天曉，玄德求見水鏡，問曰：“昨夜來者是誰？”水鏡曰：“此吾友也。”玄德求與相見。水鏡曰：“此人欲往投明主，已到他處去了。”玄德請問其姓名。水鏡笑曰：“好！好！”玄德再問：“伏龍、鳳雛，果係何人？”水鏡亦只笑曰：“好！好！”玄德拜請水鏡出山相助，同扶漢室。水鏡曰：“山野閒散之人，不堪世用。自有勝吾十倍者來助公，公宜訪之。”正談論間，忽聞莊外人喊馬嘶，小童來報：“有一將軍，引數百人到莊來也。”玄德大驚，急出視之，乃趙雲也。玄德大喜。雲下馬入見曰：“某夜來回縣，尋不見主公，連夜跟問到此。主公可作速回縣。只恐有人來縣中廝殺。”玄德辭了水鏡，與趙雲上馬，投新野來。行不數里，一彪人馬來到，視之，乃雲長、翼德也，相見大喜。玄德訴說躍馬檀溪之事，共相嗟訝。,"When the day dawned, Xuande asked to see Shuijing, and asked, ""Who was there last night?"" Shuijing said, ""This is my friend."" Xuande begged to meet. Shui Jing said, ""This person wants to go to the Lord of Ming, but he has already gone elsewhere."" Xuande asked for his name. Shui Jing smiled and said: ""Okay! Good!"" Xuande asked again: ""Fulong, Fengchu, who is the fruit?"" Shui Jing also only smiled and said: ""Okay! Good!"" . Shui Jing said: ""People who are idle in the mountains and fields are unbearable for the world. There is someone who is ten times better than me to help the Duke, and the Duke should visit him."" Hundreds of people have come to Zhuang."" Xuande was shocked and looked at it, it was Zhao Yun. Xuande was overjoyed. Yun dismounted his horse and said, ""One night, I went back and forth to the county, but I couldn't find the lord, so I asked here all night. The lord can go back to the county as soon as possible. I'm afraid someone will come to the county to fight."" Xuande resigned from Shuijing, mounted the horse with Zhao Yun, and cast Xinye is here. After walking for a few miles, a group of people came and saw them as Yun Chang and Yide, and they were overjoyed to meet each other. Xuande told the story of the Prancing Horse Tanxi, and they were all surprised.","The next morning Xuande asks who the visitor was the previous night, but Master Tranquil Water simply says again, ‘Excellent, very good indeed.’ And when Xuande asks the master to come and work with him, the master gives him short shrift: ‘I’m happy to be without worries, and there are many people who’re ten times better than me!’ When Xuande asks who they might be, the master simply says again, ‘Excellent, very good indeed!’ While they are talking, Zhao Zilong and his troop clatter into the courtyard of the farm. They have been looking everywhere for Xuande after the near-disaster of the dinner. In the midst of a happy reunion, Zhao Zilong tells Xuande that he must hurry back to Xinye, as fighting is about to erupt there.","So he waited till daylight, when he sought out his host and said. “Who was it came last night?” “A friend of mine,” was the reply. Liu Bei begged for an introduction. Water-Mirror said, “He wants to find an enlightened master, and so he has gone elsewhere.” When Liu Bei asked his name, his host only replied, “Good, good!” And when Liu Bei asked who they were who went by the names of Sleeping-Dragon and Blooming-Phoenix, he only elicited the same reply. Liu Bei then, bowing low before his host, begged him to leave the hills and help him to bring about the restoration of the ruling house to its prerogatives. But Water-Mirror replied, “Humans of the hills and woods are unequal to such a task. However, there must be many far abler than I who will help you if you seek them.” While they were talking, they heard outside the farm the shouts of troops and neighing of horses, and a servant came in to say that a general with a large company of soldiers had arrived. Liu Bei went out hastily to see who these were and found Zhao Yun. He was much relieved, and Zhao Yun dismounted and entered the house. “Last night, on my return to Xinye,” said Zhao Yun, “I could not find my lord, so I followed at once and traced you here. I pray you return quickly as I fear an attack on the city.” So Liu Bei took leave of his host and the whole company returned to Xinye. Before they had gone far another army appeared, and, when they had come nearer, they saw Guan Yu and Zhang Fei.

He gave no thought at all to all his family had given,","The misguided Yuan Shu, lost to all sense of honor, Forgetful of his forefathers, who had filled the state's highest offices,"

且說李典見勢頭不好，急奔回博望坡時，火光中一軍攔住。當先大將，乃關雲長也。李典縱馬混戰，奪路而走。于禁見糧草車輛，都被火燒，便投小路奔逃去了。夏侯蘭、韓浩來救糧草，正遇張飛。戰不數合，張飛一鎗刺夏侯蘭於馬下。韓浩奪路走脫。直殺到天明，却纔收軍。殺得屍橫遍野，血流成河。後人有詩曰：,"Besides, Li Dian saw that the momentum was not good, and when he rushed back to Bowangpo, an army stopped him in the fire. The first general was Guan Yunchang. Li Dian rode his horse into a scuffle and ran away. Yu Jin saw that the food and forage vehicles were all set on fire, so he threw the road and fled. Xia Houlan and Han Hao came to save the food and grass, but they were meeting Zhang Fei. After the battle was over, Zhang Fei stabbed Xiahoulan under the horse. Han Hao took his way and got away. It was not until the dawn of the day that the army was withdrawn. The corpses were slaughtered everywhere, and the blood flowed into rivers. A later poem says:","Guan Yu and Zhang Fei between them tackle the troops guarding the supplies. They are completely successful in destroying the supply wagons. This spells final disaster for Cao Cao’s men. Bodies lie everywhere, and the land runs with rivers of blood. As the celebration poem says:","Now Li Dian saw that things were going very badly, so he turned to get back to Bowang but fell upon a body of troops in the way, led by Guan Yu. He desperately dashed into their midst and managed to get clear. Yu Jin saw the supplies were being destroyed and there was nothing left to guard, so he escaped along a bye-path. Two other generals, who came to try to save the baggage train, met Zhang Fei; and Xiahou Lan was slain forthwith, but Han Hao managed to flee. Next morning the countryside was strewn with corpses and drenched with blood. The armies met on Bowang Slope"
傍有軍士指曰：“殿南有五色毫光起於井中。”堅喚軍士點起火把，下井打撈。撈起一婦人屍首，雖然日久，其屍不爛：宮樣裝束，項下帶一錦囊。取開看時，內有硃紅小匣，用金鎖鎖着。啟視之，乃一玉璽：方圓四寸，上鐫五龍交紐；傍缺一角，以黃金鑲之；上有篆文八字云：“受命於天，旣壽永昌”。堅得璽，乃問程普。普曰：“此傳國璽也。此玉是昔日卞和於荊山之下，見鳳凰棲於石上，載而進之楚文王。解之，果得玉。秦二十六年，令玉工琢為璽，李斯篆此八字於其上。二十八年，始皇巡狩至洞庭湖，風浪大作，舟將覆，急投玉璽於湖而止。至三十六年，始皇巡狩至華陰，有人持璽遮道，與從者曰：‘持此還祖龍。’言訖不見。此璽復歸於秦。明年，始皇崩。後來子嬰將玉璽獻與漢高祖。後至王莽篡逆，孝元皇太后將璽打王尋、蘇獻，崩其一角，以金鑲之。光武得此寶於宜陽，傳位至今。近聞十常侍作亂，劫少帝出北邙，回宮失此寶。今天授主公，必有登九五之分。此處不可久留，宜速回江東，別圖大事。”堅曰：“汝言正合吾意。明日便當託疾辭歸。”商議已定，密諭軍士勿得洩漏。,"A sergeant pointed and said, ""There are five colors of light in the well in the south of the hall."" Jian called the sergeant to light a torch and go down to salvage it. Picking up a woman's body, although it has been a long time, the body is not rotten: a palace-like attire, with a good bag under her neck. When it was opened, there was a small vermilion box inside, which was locked with a golden lock. It is a jade seal: four inches in diameter, with five dragons and buttons engraved on it; a corner missing, inlaid with gold; there are eight characters in seal script on it: ""Ordered by the sky, longevity is forever prosperous"". When he got the seal, he asked Cheng Pu. Pu said: ""This is the seal of the country. This jade is the old Bianhe under the Jingshan Mountain, saw the phoenix perched on the stone, and carried it to King Wen of Chu. I solved it, and I got jade. In the 26th year of the Qin Dynasty, I ordered the jade. The workmanship was carved into a seal, and Li Si wrote the eight characters on it. In the 28th year, the first emperor visited Dongting Lake, the wind and waves were heavy, the boat was about to overturn, and he hurriedly threw the jade seal on the lake. Hunting to Huayin, someone held a seal to cover the road, and said to the followers: 'Hold this to return to the ancestors of the dragon.' The words were not seen. This seal was returned to Qin. Next year, the first emperor collapsed. Later, when Wang Mang usurped, the Empress Dowager Xiaoyuan beat Wang Xun and Su Xian, broke one corner of the seal, and set it with gold. Guangwu obtained this treasure in Yiyang, and has passed on the throne to this day. Recently, it is reported that the ten permanent servants were in chaos, and Emperor Jie Shao went north. Mang, when you return to the palace, you will lose this treasure. If you give the lord today, you must have nine or five points. You can’t stay here for a long time. Goodbye."" The negotiation has been decided, and the sergeant should not be leaked.","As he sits wrapped in melancholy a soldier points out five strange lights emanating from a well. When Sun Jian orders the well to be explored, they find the body of a woman, still intact; around her courtly neck hangs an embroidered pouch. Inside the pouch is a beautiful box some four inches across, with a golden clasp. Inside this box is a jade seal, its top carved with five dragons wrapped around each other. One of the corners has been broken and repaired with gold in antiquity, while at its base are carved eight characters in the ancient seal script which read: ‘Receive the Mandate of Heaven: now you will have long life and eternal prosperity.’ When Sun Jian shows the treasure to his adviser Cheng Pu, he instantly knows what it is. ‘This is the seal of the emperors,’ he says and relates its long history. ‘Once there was a phoenix spotted sitting on a stone on the Jian mountain. This apparition caused the stone to be noticed and removed. When it was cut open in front of King Wen of Chu4 its heart was found to be jade. Hundreds of years later, in the twenty-sixth year of the reign of the first emperor, the very year he unified all China, the first emperor ordered the jade to be cut. His prime minister, Li Si, composed the eight characters for it. Just two years later, during a terrible storm on Lake Dongting, the emperor hurled the jade overboard to pacify the waves. Then, eight years later, when the emperor was on a long journey, an old man stepped forward. He presented the jade to the emperor, then he disappeared. After the first emperor died the seal was taken by the founder of the Han dynasty. Two hundred years later, during the Wang Mang rebellion, the queen mother of the overthrown emperor used the seal to hit two of the rebels over the head. She chipped the corner, which later was repaired with gold. The emperor who restored the Han after the rebellion found the seal, and ever since that time it has passed from emperor to emperor. When the troubles with the Ten Eunuchs broke out it was lost. Now you’ve found it, which must mean you’re destined to rule. But don’t stay here in the north: you must head southeast to our homeland and begin your kingly preparations.’ Sun Jian is more than happy to agree.","Then a soldier pointing to the south said, “There is a beam of colored light rising from a well.” Sun Jian bade his people light torches and descend into the well. Soon they brought up the corpse of a woman, not in the least decayed although it had been there many days. She was dressed in palace clothing and from her neck hung an embroidered bag. Opening this a red box was found, with a golden lock, and when the box was opened, they saw a jade seal, square in shape, an inch each way. On it were delicately engraved five dragons intertwined. One corner had been broken off and repaired with gold. There were eight characters in the seal style of engraving which interpreted read, “I have received the command from Heaven: may my time be always long and prosperous.” Sun Jian showed this to his adviser, General Cheng Pu, who at once recognized it as the Imperial Hereditary Seal of the Emperor. Cheng Pu said, “This seal has a history. In olden days Bian He saw a phoenix sitting on a certain stone at the foot of the Jing Mountains. He offered the stone at court. The king of Chu split open the stone and found a piece of jade. In the twenty-sixth year of Qin Dynasty (BC 221), a jade cutter made a seal from it, and Li Si, the First Emperor's Prime Minister, engraved the characters. Two years later, while the First Emperor was sailing in the Dongting Lake, a terrific storm arrived. The Emperor threw the seal to the water as a propitiatory offering, and the storm immediately ceased. Ten years later again, when the First Emperor was making a progress and had reached Huaying, an old man by the road side handed a seal to one of the attendants saying, 'This is now restored to the ancestral dragon,' and had then disappeared. Thus the jewel returned to Qin. “The next year the First Emperor died. Later Zi Ying, the grandson of the First Emperor, presented the seal to Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor, the founder of the Han Dynasty. Two hundred years later, in Wang Mang's rebellion, the Emperor's mother, Lady Yuan, struck two of the rebels, Wang Xun and Su Xian, with the seal and broke off a corner, which was repaired with gold. Liu Xiu the Latter Han Founder got possession of it at Yiyang, and it has been regularly bequeathed hereafter. “I heard this treasured seal had been lost during the trouble in the Palace when the Ten Regular Attendants hurried off the Emperor. It was missed on His Majesty's return. Now my lord has it and certainly will come to the imperial dignity. But you must not remain here in the north. Quickly go home—Changsha, south of the Great River ((Yangtze River))—where you can lay plans for the accomplishment of the great design.” “Your words exactly accord with my thoughts,” said Sun Jian."
却說玄德躍馬過溪，似醉如癡；想：“此闊澗一躍而過，豈非天意！”迤邐望南漳策馬而行，日將沈西。正行之間，見一牧童跨於牛背上，口吹短笛而來。玄德歎曰：“吾不如也！”遂立馬觀之。牧童亦停牛罷笛，熟視玄德，曰：“將軍莫非破黃巾劉玄德否？”玄德驚問曰：“汝乃村僻小童，何以知吾姓字？”牧童曰：“我本不知；因常侍師父，有客到日，多曾說有一劉玄德，身長七尺五寸，垂手過膝，目能自顧其耳，乃當世之英雄。今觀將軍如此模樣，想必是也。”玄德曰：“汝師何人也？”牧童曰：“吾師覆姓司馬，名徽，字德操，潁川人也。道號‘水鏡先生’。”玄德曰：“汝師與誰為友？”小童曰：“與襄陽龐德公、龐統為友。”玄德曰：“龐德公乃龐統何人？”童子曰：“叔姪也。龐德公字山民，長俺師父十歲；龐統字士元，少俺師父五歲。一日，我師父在樹上採桑，適龐統來相訪，坐於樹下，共相議論，終日不倦。吾師甚愛龐統，呼之為弟。”玄德曰：“汝師今居何處？”牧童遙指曰：“前面林中，便是莊院。”玄德曰：“吾正是劉玄德。汝可引我去拜見你師父。”,"But he said that Xuande jumped his horse across the stream, like he was intoxicated; he thought: ""It's not God's will to jump across this broad stream!"" On the way, I saw a shepherd boy straddling the back of an ox, coming blowing a piccolo. Xuande sighed, ""I'm not as good as me!"" He immediately watched. The shepherd boy also stopped the ox and played the flute, looked at Xuande familiarly, and said, ""Could it be that the general broke the yellow turban Liu Xuande?"" Xuande asked in surprise, ""You are a lonely boy in the village, how do you know my surname?"" The shepherd boy said, ""I don't know; Because of the Master Chang Shi, when a guest arrives in Japan, he has often said that there is Liu Xuande, who is seven feet five inches in length, with his hands over his knees, and his eyes can look after his ears. Xuande said, ""Who is your teacher?"" The shepherd boy said, ""My teacher's surname is Sima, his name is Hui, his name is Decao, and he is from Yingchuan. The Taoist name is 'Mr. Shuijing'."" Xuande said, ""Who is your teacher with? Friends?"" The boy said, ""I am friends with Duke Pang De and Pang Tong of Xiangyang."" Xuande said, ""Who is Duke Pang De from Pang Tong?"" The boy said, ""My uncle. Pang De Gong is a mountain citizen and is ten years older than my master; Pang Tong is a scholar. Yuan, my master is five years younger. One day, my master was picking mulberries on a tree, and Pang Tong came to visit him, sat under the tree, and discussed with each other all day long. My master loved Pang Tong very much and called him his younger brother.” Xuan De said, ""Where is your master now?"" The shepherd boy pointed away and said, ""In the forest in front of you is the manor."" Xuande said, ""I am Liu Xuande. You can lead me to visit your master.""","Convinced that it was by the Will of Heaven that he escaped, Xuande rides on, deeply troubled by all that has happened. As the evening draws on, he comes upon a young ox-herder riding an ox and playing a flute. Such a simple, peaceful scene moves Xuande deeply. ‘How I wish my life was like this!’ he muses as the young lad brings the ox to a halt and stares at Xuande. ‘I think you’re General Xuande, who defeated the Yellow Headband rebels!’ he says, to which Xuande replies, ‘How’s it possible that a young country dweller like you knows who I am?’ The boy tells him that while looking after his master’s guests they often talk about Xuande and what he looks like – that is how he knew who he is. ‘And who is your master?’ enquires Xuande. ‘He is Sima Hui Decao and goes by the Daoist name of Master Tranquil Water,’ replies the boy. Xuande asks to meet him, and together they go the two miles to a farm. The sound of someone playing a flute greets them as they ride in. Master Tranquil Water senses through a change in the music that some great warrior has arrived and stops playing his flute to come and greet him. Xuande is astonished when Master Tranquil Water mentions that Xuande has just had a lucky escape and invites the weary Xuande inside.","He could not help telling himself, “My safety is due to an especial interposition of Providence.” Following a tortuous path, he urged his steed toward Nanzhang. But the sun sank to the west and his destination seemed yet a long way off. Then he saw a young cowherd seated on the back of a buffalo and playing on a short flute. “If I were only as happy!” sighed Liu Bei. He checked his horse and looked at the lad, who stopped his beast, ceased playing on the pipe, and stared fixedly at the stranger. “You must be Liu Bei, the general who fought the Yellow Scarves,” said the boy presently. Liu Bei was taken aback. “How can you know my name, a young rustic like you living in such a secluded place?” said he. “Of course I do not know you, but my master often has visitors, and they all talk about Liu Bei, the tall man whose hands hang down below his knees and whose eyes are very prominent. They say he is the most famous man of the day. Now you, General, are just such a man as they talk about, and surely you are he.” “Well, who is your master?” “My master's name is Sima Hui. He belongs to Yingchuan and his Taoist appellation is Water-Mirror.” “Who are your master's friends that you mentioned?” “They are Pang Degong and Pang Tong of Xiangyang.” “And who are they?” “Uncle and nephew. Pang Degong is ten years older than my master; the other is five years younger. One day my master was up in a tree picking mulberries when Pang Tong arrived. They began to talk and kept it up all day, my master did not come down till the evening. My master is very fond of Pang Tong and calls him brother.” “And where does your master live?” “In that wood there, in front,” said the cowherd pointing to it. “There he has a farmstead.” “I really am Liu Bei, and you might lead me to your master that I may salute him.”"
次日，太后命何進參錄尚書事，其餘皆封官職。董太后宣張讓等入宮商議曰：“何進之妹，始初我擡舉他。今日他孩兒卽皇帝位，內外臣僚，皆其心腹：威權太重，我將如何？”讓奏曰：“娘娘可臨朝，垂簾聽政；封皇子協為王；加國舅董重大官，掌握軍權；重用臣等：大事可圖矣。”董太后大喜。次日設朝，董太后降旨，封皇子協為陳留王，董重為驃騎將軍，張讓等共預朝政。何太后見董太后專權，於宮中設一宴，請董太后赴席。酒至半酣，何太后起身捧盃再拜曰：“我等皆婦人也，參預朝政，非其所宜。昔呂后因握重權，宗族千口皆被戮。今我等宜深居九重；朝廷大事，任大臣元老自行商議，此國家之幸也：願垂聽焉。”董后大怒曰：“汝鴆死王美人，設心嫉妒。今倚汝子為君，與汝兄何進之勢，輒敢亂言！吾敕驃騎斷汝兄首，如反掌耳！”何后亦怒曰：“吾以好言相勸，何反怒耶？”董后曰：“汝家屠沽小輩，有何見識！”兩宮互相爭競，張讓等各勸歸宮。何后連夜召何進入宮，告以前事。何進出，召三公共議。來早設朝，使廷臣奏董太后原係藩妃，不宜久居宮中，合仍遷於河間安置，限日下卽出國門。一面遣人起送董后；一面點禁軍圍驃騎將軍董重府宅，追索印綬。董重知事急，自刎於後堂。家人舉哀，軍士方散。張讓、段珪見董后一枝已廢，遂皆以金珠玩好結搆何進弟何苗并其母舞陽君，令早晚入何太后處，善言遮蔽：因此十常侍又得近幸。,"The next day, the Empress Dowager ordered He Jin to participate in the records of the Shangshu, and the rest were given official positions. Empress Dowager Dong Xuan Zhang Rang and the others entered the palace to discuss and said: ""He Jin's younger sister, I promoted him at first. Today, he is a child of the emperor, and all his internal and external ministers are his confidants: the authority is too heavy, what will I do?"" Rang said: ""The maiden can come to the court and listen to the government under the curtain; make the prince's association as the king; add the country's uncle Dong, a major official, to control the military power; reuse ministers, etc.: the big things can be planned."" Empress Dowager Dong was overjoyed. The next day, a dynasty was established, and the Empress Dowager Dong issued a decree and named the Prince Association as King Chenliu, Dong Zhong as the hussar general, and Zhang Rang and others presided over the government. Empress Dowager He saw that Empress Dowager Dong had the power to hold a banquet in the palace and invited Empress Dowager Dong to attend the banquet. When the wine was half full, the Empress Dowager He got up and held the cup and said: ""We are all women, and it is not appropriate for us to participate in the government. In the past, Empress Lu held a lot of power, and thousands of clan members were slaughtered. The important affairs of the imperial court are discussed by the ministers and elders on their own. This country is fortunate: I would like to hear it."" The Empress Dong was furious and said: ""You have killed the king and beautiful woman, and set your heart to jealousy. Now you are relying on your son as your ruler, and how can you enter with your brother? How dare you talk nonsense! My charioteer will cut off your brother's head, like a slap on the ear!"" He Hou also said angrily, ""I persuaded me with good words, why would I be angry?"" Dong Hou said, ""Your family is Tugu Junior, what insight do you have!"" The two palaces competed with each other, and Zhang Rang and the others persuaded them to return to the palace. He Hou called He into the palace overnight to tell him about the past. Where to go in and out, three public meetings are called. When he came to set up a dynasty early, he had court officials tell that Empress Dowager Dong was originally a vassal concubine, and it was not suitable for him to live in the palace for a long time. On the one hand, they sent people up to send Dong Hou; on the other hand, they ordered the forbidden army to surround the residence of the hussar general Dong Zhong, and searched for the seal. Governor Dong Zhong was in a hurry and committed suicide in the back hall. The family mourned, and the sergeants dispersed. Zhang Rang and Duan Gui saw that the Empress Dowager Dong had been abandoned, so they all played with gold beads to play with the structure of He Jin's younger brother He Miao and his mother Wu Yangjun, and ordered them to enter He Empress Dowager sooner or later.","He promises to place Prince Bian on the throne, kill the eunuchs, cleanse the court and restore harmony under Heaven again. Inspired by this, they storm into the palace and in front of the coffin of the dead emperor they place Prince Bian on the throne and declare him the new Emperor Shao. Emboldened, they decide to wipe out all the eunuchs, but they have already fled to the protection of Empress He, who, elated by the elevation of her son to emperor, promises to protect them. In the confusion Empress Dong, the dead emperor’s mother, tries to reassert her power but fails, because the Ten Eunuchs do not support her.","Now Empress Dong summoned the eunuch Zhang Rang and his party to a council. Said she, “It was I who first brought forward the sister of He Jin. Today her son is on the throne, and all the officials are her friends, and her influence is enormous. What can we do?” Zhang Rang replied, “Your Highness should administer the state from 'behind the veil.' create the late Emperor's son Liu Xian a prince; give your brother, the Imperial Uncle Dong Chong, a high rank, and place him over the army; and use us. That will do it.” Empress Dong approved. Next day she held a court and issued an edict in the sense proposed. She made Liu Xian Prince of Chenliu and Dong Chong General of the Flying Cavalry, and she allowed the eunuchs again to participate state affairs. When Empress He saw this, she prepared a banquet to which she invited her rival Empress Dong. In the middle of the feast, when all were well warmed with wine, Empress He rose and offered a cup to her guest saying, “It is not fitting that we two should meddle in state affairs. In the beginning of the Han Dynasty, when Empress Lu laid hands upon the government, all her clans were put to death. We ought to remain content, immured in our palaces, and leave state affairs to the state officials. That would be well for the country, and I trust you will act thus.” But Empress Dong only got angry, saying, “You poisoned Lady Wang out of jealousy. Now, relying upon the fact that your son sits on the throne and that your brother is powerful, you speak these wild words. I will command that your brother be beheaded, and that can be done as easily as I turn my hand.” Empress He in her turn waxed wroth and said, “I tried to persuade you with fair words; why get so angry?” “You low born daughter of a butcher, what do you know of offices?” cried Empress Dong. And the quarrel waxed hot. The eunuchs persuaded the ladies to retire. But in the night Empress He summoned her brother into the palace and told him what had occurred. He went out and took counsel with the principal officers of state. Next morning a court was held and a memorial was presented, saying: “Empress Dong, being the foster mother of Liu Xian, Prince of Chenliu, a regional prince—only a collateral—cannot properly occupy any part of the Palace. She is to be removed into her original fief of Hejian and is to depart immediately.” And while they sent an escort to remove Empress Dong, a strong guard was placed about the Imperial Uncle Dong Chong's dwelling. They took away his seal of office and he, knowing this was the end, killed himself in his private apartments. His dependents, who wailed his death, were driven off by the guards. The eunuchs Zhang Rang and Duan Gui, having lost their patroness, sent large gifts to He Jin's younger brother, He Miao, and his mother, Lady Wuyang, and thus got them to put in a good word to Empress He so as to gain her protection. And so they gained favor once more at court. In the sixth month of that year, the secret emissaries of He Jin poisoned Empress Dong in her residence in the country."

却說帝布洛陽，百事未備，城郭崩倒，欲修未能。人報李傕、郭汜領兵將到。帝大驚，問楊奉曰：“山東之使未回，李、郭之兵又至，為之奈何？”楊奉、韓暹曰：“臣願與賊決死戰，以保陛下。”董承曰：“城郭不堅，兵甲不多，戰如不勝，當復如何？不若且奉駕往山東避之。”帝從其言，卽日起駕望山東進發。百官無馬，皆隨駕步行。出了洛陽，行無一箭之地，但見塵頭蔽日，金鼓喧天，無限人馬到來，帝、后戰慄不能言。忽見一騎飛來，乃前差往山東之使命也；至車前拜啟曰：“曹將軍盡起山東之兵，應詔前來。聞李傕、郭汜犯洛陽，先差夏侯惇為先鋒，引上將十員，精兵五萬，前來保駕。”帝心方安。少頃，夏侯惇引許褚、典韋等，至駕前面君，俱以軍禮見。帝慰諭方畢，忽報正東又有一路軍到。帝卽命夏侯惇往探之，回奏曰：“乃曹操步軍也。”須臾，曹洪、李典、樂進來見駕。通名畢，洪奏曰：“臣兄知賊兵至近，恐夏侯惇孤力難為，故又差臣等倍道而來協助。”帝曰：“曹將軍眞社稷臣也！”遂命護駕前行。探馬來報：“李傕、郭汜領兵長驅而來。”帝令夏侯惇分兩路迎之。惇乃與曹洪分為兩翼，馬軍先出，步軍後隨，儘力攻擊。傕、汜賊兵大敗，斬首萬餘。於是請帝還洛陽故宮。夏侯惇屯兵於城外。次日，曹操引大隊人馬到來。安營畢，入城見帝，拜於殿階之下。帝賜平身，宣諭慰勞。操曰：“臣向蒙國恩，刻思圖報。今傕、汜二賊，罪惡貫盈；臣有精兵二十餘萬，以順討逆，無不克捷。陛下善保龍體，以社稷為重。”帝乃封操領司隸校尉、假節鉞、錄尚書事。,"But he said that Emperor Bu Luoyang, Pepsi was not prepared, the city collapsed, and he could not repair it. People reported that Li Jue and Guo Si would arrive. The emperor was shocked and asked Yang Feng: ""The envoy from Shandong has not returned, and the soldiers of Li and Guo have arrived. What can I do?"" Yang Feng and Han Xian said: ""I would like to fight the thief to the death to protect Your Majesty."" Dong Cheng said. ""The city is not strong, and there are not many soldiers and armor. If the battle is invincible, what should I do? Why don't I go to Shandong to avoid it."" Hundreds of officials have no horses, and they all follow on foot. Out of Luoyang, there is nowhere to go, but when the sun is covered with dust, the golden drums are roaring in the sky, and the infinite men and horses are coming, the emperor and the queen are trembling and unable to speak. Suddenly I saw a cavalry flying over, and it was on a mission to go to Shandong. When I went to the front of the car, I bowed and said: ""General Cao has used all his troops in Shandong and should come here. Hearing that Li Jue and Guo Si invaded Luoyang, Xiahou Dun was sent to be the vanguard first. , to lead ten generals and 50,000 elite soldiers to come to protect you."" The emperor felt relieved. After a short while, Xiahou Dun led Xu Chu, Dian Wei, and others to the front of the chariot, and they all greeted him with military courtesy. After the emperor's condolences were completed, he suddenly reported that another army had arrived in Zhengdong. The Emperor ordered Xiahou Dun to visit him, and he replied, ""It's Cao Cao's infantry."" After a while, Cao Hong, Li Dian, and Le came to see the driver. When the name was completed, Hong Zuo said: ""My brother, knowing that the bandit army is approaching, is afraid that Xiahou Dun will be unable to do it alone, so he sent his ministers to assist him."" OK. Exploring the Malay News: ""Li Jue and Guo Si led the troops to come."" The emperor ordered Xiahou Dun to greet him in two ways. Dun Nai and Cao Hong were divided into two wings, the horse army went out first, the infantry army followed, and tried their best to attack. The Sui and Si thieves were defeated and more than 10,000 beheaded. So I asked the emperor to return the Luoyang Imperial Palace. Xiahou Dun stationed troops outside the city. The next day, Cao Cao led a large group to arrive. After the camp was completed, he entered the city to meet the emperor, and worshipped under the steps of the hall. The emperor bestowed pacification and declared his condolences. Cao said: ""My minister has shown the kindness of the country, and I will repay it. Today, the two thieves, Jui and Si, are full of sins; the minister has more than 200,000 elite soldiers, who are able to overcome the rebellion and conquer the enemy. Your Majesty is good at protecting the dragon body, The most important thing is the society."" The emperor was named Cao Commander Sili School Captain, Jiajie Yue, and Lu Shang Shushi.","Before news of Cao Cao’s preparations reach the troubled emperor, rumours spread that Li Jue and Guo Si are advancing on Luoyang. In despair, the court begins to retreat from the capital. The cavalcade has only just started out of the city gate when Cao Cao’s troops appear over the horizon. Joyfully the emperor returns to the palace in Luoyang while in a series of swift manoeuvres Cao Cao’s army confront and rout the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si.","At Luoyang everything was desolate. The walls had fallen, and there were no means of rebuilding them, while rumors and reports of the coming of Li Jue and Guo Si kept up a state of constant anxiety. The frightened Emperor spoke with Yang Feng, saying, “What can be done? There is no answer from the East of Huashang, and our enemies are near.” Then Yang Feng and Han Xian said, “We, your ministers, will fight to the death for you.” But Dong Cheng said, “The fortifications are weak and our military resources small, so that we cannot hope for victory, and what does defeat mean? I see nothing better to propose than a move into the east of Huashang Mountains.” The Emperor agreed to this, and the journey began without further preparation. There being few horses, the officers of the court had to march afoot. Hardly a bowshot outside the gate they saw a thick cloud of dust out of which came all the clash and clamor of an advancing army. The Emperor and his Consort were dumb with fear. Then appeared a horseman; he was the messenger returning from the East of Huashang. He rode up to the chariot, made an obeisance, and said, “General Cao Cao, as commanded, is coming with all the military force of the East of Huashang; but hearing that Li Jue and Guo Si had again approached the capital, he has sent Xiahou Dun in advance. With Xiahou Dun are many capable leaders and fifty thousand of proved soldiers. They will guard Your Majesty.” All fear was swept away. Soon after Xiahou Dun and his staff arrived. Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, and Dian Wei were presented to the Emperor who graciously addressed them. Then one came to say a large army was approaching from the east, and at the Emperor's command Xiahou Dun went to ascertain who these were. He soon returned saying they were Cao Cao's infantry. In a short time Cao Hong, Li Dian, and Yue Jin came to the imperial chariot and their names having been duly communicated. Cao Hong said, “When my brother, Cao Cao, heard of the approach of the rebels, he feared that the advance guard he had sent might be too weak, so he sent me to march quickly for reinforcement.” “General Cao Cao is indeed a trusty servant!” said the Emperor. Orders were given to advance, Cao Hong leading the escort. By and by scouts came to say that the rebels were coming up very quickly. The Emperor bade Xiahou Dun divide his force into two parts to oppose them. Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong's armies threw out two wings with cavalry in front and foot behind. They attacked with vigor and beat off the Li Jue and Guo Si's rebels with severe loss of ten thousand. Then Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong begged the Emperor to return to Luoyang, and Xiahou Dun guarded the city. Next day Cao Cao came with his great army, and having got them duly camped he went into the city to audience. He knelt at the foot of the steps, but was called up hither to stand beside the Emperor and be thanked. Cao Cao replied, “Having been the recipient of great bounty, thy servant owes the state much gratitude. The measure of evil of the two rebels is full, I have two hundred thousand of good soldiers to oppose them, and those soldiers are fully equal to securing the safety of Your Majesty and the Throne. The preservation of the state sacrifice is the matter of real moment.” High honors were conferred on Cao Cao. He was appointed Commander of Capital District, Minister of War, and granted Military Insignia."
玄德聞歌，勒馬喚農夫問曰：“此歌何人所作？”答曰：“乃臥龍先生所作也。”玄德曰：“臥龍先生住何處？”農夫曰：“自此山之南，一帶高岡，乃臥龍岡也。岡前林內茅廬中，卽諸葛先生高臥之地。”玄德謝之，策馬前行。不數里，遙望臥龍岡，果然淸景異常。後人有古風一篇，單道臥龍居處。詩曰：,"When Xuande heard the song, he stopped his horse and called the farmer to ask, ""Who made this song?"" He replied, ""It was made by Mr. Wolong."" Xuande said, ""Where does Mr. Wolong live?"" The farmer said, ""From this mountain To the south, there is a high hill in the area, which is also Wolong hill. In the thatched hut in the forest in front of the hill, Mr. Zhuge is lying high."" Xuande thanked him and rode his horse forward. Not counting miles, looking at Wolonggang in the distance, the scenery is really unusual. Descendants have an ancient style, a single-lane Wolong residence. The poem says:","Humbled, Xuande says, ‘Then just say to the master that Xuande came calling.’","Liu Bei and his brothers stopped to listen to the song and, calling up one of the peasants, asked who made it. “It was made by Master Sleeping-Dragon,” said the laborer. “Then he lives hereabout. Where?” “South of this hill there is a ridge called the Sleeping Dragon, and close by is a sparse wood. In it stands a modest cottage. That is where Master Zhuge Liang takes his repose.” Liu Bei thanked him and the party rode on. Soon they came to the ridge, most aptly named, for indeed it lay wrapped in an atmosphere of calm beauty. A poet wrote of it thus:"
無由撫慰忠臣意，故把親兒擲馬前。,"There was no way to comfort the loyal ministers, so he threw his relatives in front of the horse.","He is furious and cries out, ‘To protect this child I very nearly lost my greatest commander!’",He threw his son aside.
且說朱靈、路昭回許都見曹操，說玄德留下軍馬。操怒，欲斬二人。荀彧曰：“權歸劉備，二人亦無奈何。”操乃赦之。彧又曰：“可寫書與車胄就內圖之。”操從其計，暗使人來見車胄，傳曹操鈞旨。胄隨卽請陳登商議此事。登曰：“此事極易：今劉備出城招民，不日將還；將軍可命軍士伏於甕城邊，只作接他，待馬到來，一刀斬之；某在城上射住後軍，大事濟矣。”胄從之。陳登回見父陳珪，備言其事。珪命登先往報知玄德。登領父命，飛馬去報，正迎着關、張，報說如此如此。原來關、張先回，玄德在後。張飛聽得，便要去廝殺。雲長曰：“他伏甕城邊待我，去必有失。我有一計，可殺車胄：乘夜扮作曹軍到徐州，引車胄出迎，襲而殺之。”飛然其言。那部下軍原有曹操旗號，衣甲都同。當夜三更，到城邊叫門。城上問是誰，衆應是曹丞相差來張文遠的人馬。報知車胄，胄急請陳登議曰：“若不迎接，誠有疑；若出迎之，又恐有詐。”胄乃上城回言：“黑夜難以分辨，平明了相見。”城下答應：“只恐劉備知道，疾快開門！”車胄猶豫未定，城外一片聲叫開門。車胄只得披挂上馬，引一千軍出城；跑過弔橋，大叫：“文遠何在？”火光中只見雲長提刀縱馬直迎車胄，大叫曰：“匹夫安敢懷詐，欲殺吾兄！”車胄大驚，戰未數合，遮攔不住，撥馬便回。到弔橋邊，城上陳登亂箭射下，車胄遶城而走。雲長趕來，手起一刀，砍於馬下，割下首級提回，望城上呼曰：“反賊車胄，吾已殺之；衆等無罪，投降免死！”諸軍倒戈投降，軍民皆安。,"Let’s say that Zhu Ling and Lu Zhao went back to Xudu to see Cao Cao, and said that Xuande left the army behind. Furious, he wanted to kill the two of them. Xun Yu said: ""The power belongs to Liu Bei, and the two of them are helpless."" Cao was pardoned. Yu also said: ""You can write a book and draw a picture of the car inside."" Cao followed his plan and secretly sent someone to see the car and pass on Cao Cao's order. Xie Sui asked Chen Deng to discuss the matter. Deng said: ""This matter is very easy: Liu Bei is going out of the city to recruit people, and he will return in a few days; the general can order his soldiers to lie beside the urn city, just pick him up, and when the horse arrives, kill him with a sword; , the big thing is done."" Zhou followed it. Chen Deng went back to see his father Chen Gui and prepared to say what happened. Gui ordered Deng to report to Xuande first. Deng received his father's order, and Pegasus went to report, facing Guan and Zhang, and the report said so and so. It turned out that Guan and Zhang returned first, and Xuande followed. Zhang Fei heard it and was about to fight. Yun Chang said: ""He will stay by the side of Weng City and treat me, so if I go there will be a loss. I have a plan to kill the chariot: take the night disguised as Cao's army to Xuzhou, lead the chariot out to meet him, attack and kill him."" . That subordinate army originally had the banner of Cao Cao, and the clothes and armor were the same. At three watch that night, call the door at the edge of the city. The city asked who it was, and everyone should be Cao Cheng's men who came to Zhang Wenyuan. When he reported to the car, he hurriedly asked Chen Dengyi to say: ""If you don't greet him, you will be suspicious; if you go out to greet him, you may be deceived."" Zuo went to the city and replied, ""It's hard to tell the difference in the dark night, but we will meet in plain sight."" The city promised: ""I'm afraid Liu Bei knows, open the door quickly!"" Che Zhou hesitated, and there was a voice outside the city calling for the door. The chariot had to put on a horse and lead a thousand troops out of the city; he ran across the suspension bridge and shouted, ""Where is Wenyuan?"" In the firelight, Yun Chang was seen carrying a knife and galloping his horse to meet the chariot, and shouted, ""A man dares to cheat. , want to kill my brother!"" Che Zhou was shocked, and the battle was over, unable to stop him, so he turned his horse and returned. At the side of the suspension bridge, Chen Deng shot down the arrows on the city, and the car drove around the city. Yun Chang came, took a knife in his hand, slashed under his horse, cut off his head and brought it back. Looking up at the city, he shouted, ""I have killed the thief's chariot; everyone is innocent. Surrender to avoid death!"" , the army and the people are safe.","It is triumphantly brought to Cao Cao in Xuchang. It is, of course, Xuande the victor who reports the defeat and death of Yuan Shu to the emperor. Cao Cao is now more and more alarmed at the popularity of Xuande. He orders the governor of Xuzhou, Che Zhou, to conspire against Xuande and to trap him in an ambush as Xuande returns to his city.","He also personally went through the countryside commanding the people to resume their ordinary avocations. Cao Cao was angry when his two officers returned without their man and was going to put them to death. Xun Yu reasoned with him. “The power was in Liu Bei's hands, and so these two had no alternative,” said Xun Yu. So they were pardoned. “You should instruct Che Zhou, the Imperial Protector Deputy, to try to destroy him,” said Xun Yu. Accordingly he sent secret orders to Che Zhou, who took Chen Deng into his confidence and asked his advice. Chen Deng said, “That is easy. Liu Bei is outside the city, and an ambush in the city gate to attack him on his return from the country will be final; I will attack the escort with arrows from the city walls.” Che Zhou agreed to try this. Then Chen Deng went to his father to tell him. Chen Gui bade him go and warn the intended victim. Chen Deng at once rode away to do so. Before long he met Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, to whom he told his story. Now Liu Bei was following some distance behind. As soon as Zhang Fei heard of the plot, he wanted to attack the ambush, but Guan Yu proposed another plan. Said he, “Attacking the ambush will be a failure, since we are without the walls. And I think we can compass the death of Che Zhou. In the night we will pretend to be some of Cao Cao's soldiers and entice him out to meet us. We will slay him.” Zhang Fei approved of the plan. Now the soldiers still had some of Cao Cao's army banners and wore similar armor. About the third watch they came to the city wall and hailed the gate. Those on guard asked who they were. The men replied that they were Zhang Liao's troops sent from the capital. This was told Che Zhou who sent hastily for Chen Deng to ask his advice. “If I do not receive them, they will suspect my loyalty,” said Che Zhou. “Yet if I go out, I may be victim of a ruse.” So he went up on the wall and said, “It is too dark to distinguish friends from foes. You must wait till daylight.” “If Liu Bei know our presence, he will attack,” shouted back the soldiers. And they begged him to let them in. Still Che Zhou hesitated. They shouted louder than ever to open the gate. Presently Che Zhou girded on his armor, placed himself at the head of one thousand cavalry and went out. He galloped over the bridge, shouting, “Where is Zhang Liao?” Then lights blazed around, and he recognized Guan Yu with his sword drawn. “Wretch!” cried Guan Yu. “You would plot to slay my brother, would you?” Che Zhou was too frightened to make good defense, and he turned to reenter the gate. But as he reached the drawbridge, Chen Deng shot out flights of arrows, wherefore Che Zhou turned aside and galloped along under the wall. But Guan Yu came quickly in pursuit. His sword was raised aloft, and as it came down, Che Zhou fell to the earth. Guan Yu cut off his head and returned, shouting, “I have slain the traitor. You others need not fear if you only surrender.”"
時有嚴白虎，自稱“東吳德王”，據吳郡，遣部將守住烏程、嘉興。當日白虎聞策兵至，令弟嚴輿出兵，會於楓橋。輿橫刀立馬於橋上。有人報入中軍，策便欲出。張紘諫曰：“夫主將乃三軍之所繫命，不宜輕敵小寇。願將軍自重。”策謝曰：“先生之言如金石；但恐不親冒矢石，則將士不用命耳。”隨遣韓當出馬。比及韓當到橋上時，蔣欽、陳武早駕小舟從河岸邊殺過橋裏；亂箭射倒岸上軍，二人飛身上岸砍殺，嚴輿退走。韓當引軍直到閶門下，賊退入城裏去了。策分兵水陸並進，圍住吳城。一困三日，無人出戰。策引衆軍到閶門外招諭，城上一員裨將，左手托定護梁，右手指着城下大罵。太史慈就馬上拈弓取箭，顧軍將曰：“看我射中這廝左手！”說聲未絕，弓弦響處，果然射個正中，把那將的左手射透，反牢釘在護梁上。城上城下見者，無不喝采。衆人救了這人下城。白虎大驚曰：“彼軍有如此人，安能敵乎！”遂商量求和。次日，使嚴輿出城，來見孫策。策請輿入帳飲酒。酒酣，問輿曰：“令兄意欲如何？”輿曰：“欲與將軍平分江東。”策大怒曰：“鼠輩安敢與吾相等！”命斬嚴輿。輿拔劍起身，策飛劍砍之，應手而倒，割下首級，令人送入城中。白虎料敵不過，棄城而走。,"At that time there was Yan Baihu, who called himself the ""King of Eastern Wu De"". According to Wu County, he dispatched troops to defend Wucheng and Jiaxing. On the same day, Baihu heard that the troops were coming, and ordered his younger brother Yan Yu to send troops to meet at Fengqiao. Yu Hengdao immediately on the bridge. Someone reported to the Central Army, and the plan was about to leave. Zhang Hong admonished: ""The commander-in-chief is the commander of the three armies, and it is not advisable to underestimate the enemy and the small bandits. May the general be respectful."" Ce Xie said: ""Sir's words are like gold and stone; Follow Han Dang to the horse. When Han Dang arrived at the bridge, Jiang Qin and Chen Wu crossed the bridge from the river bank early in a boat; random arrows shot down the army on the bank, and the two flew to the bank to chop and kill, and Yan Yu retreated. Han Dang led the army to the gate of Chang, and the thieves retreated into the city. The plan was to divide the army by land and water, and surrounded Wucheng. For three days, no one came out to fight. Guiding the army to call outside Changmen, one of the generals in the city held the guard beam with his left hand, and pointed his right hand at the city and cursed. Taishi Ci immediately picked up the bow and took the arrow, and the general Gu said, ""Look, I hit this guy's left hand!"" Before he finished speaking, the bowstring sounded, and he shot right in the middle, penetrating the general's left hand and nailing it to the guard. on the beam. Those who saw it in the city and in the city all applauded. The people rescued the man from the city. The white tiger was startled and said, ""There are such people in the army, so it is safe to be an enemy!"" Then they discussed and asked for peace. The next day, Yan Yu was sent out of the city to see Sun Ce. Policy invited Yu to drink alcohol. When he was drunk, he asked Yu, ""What do you want, Brother Ling?"" Yu said, ""I want to divide Jiangdong with the general."" Ce was furious and said, ""You dare to be equal to me!"" He ordered Yan Yu to be executed. Yu got up with his sword drawn, and Feijian slashed at it. He fell in response, cut off his head, and sent him into the city. White Tiger was no match for it, so he abandoned the city and left.","Moving across the river into the south, Sun Ce’s army at first spreads panic and chaos, but soon people see that this army never steals anything, nor harms any of the ordinary folk. So grateful are the people that they themselves bring food and drink to the camp. Moving further south, Sun Ce comes up against various conspirators, thugs, rebels and bandits, all of whom want to try to ride on his coat-tails and seize part of the south. Sun Ce’s response is always swift and severe, and battle after battle is won by him, aided now by Taishi Ci. Between them they capture the cities of Jiaxing, Wucheng and Wujun among others.","At that time there was a certain Yan Baihu, or the White Tiger, who styled himself King of Eastern Wu ((an ancient state in the South Land)) and ruled over Wujun. His armies stationed at Wucheng and Jiaxing. Hearing of Sun Ce's approach, Yan Baihu sent his brother, Yan Yu, with an army against Sun Ce, and they met at Juniper Bridge. Yan Yu, sword in hand, took his stand on the bridge, and this was reported to Sun Ce, who prepared to accept the challenge. Zhang Hong tried to dissuade him, saying, “For as much as my lord's fate is bound up with that of the army, he should not risk a conflict with a mere robber. I wish that you should remember your own value.” “Your words, O Wise One, are as gold and precious stones, but I fear that my soldiers will not carry out my commands unless I myself share their dangers.” However, Sun Ce sent forth Han Dang to take up the challenge. Just as Han Dang reached the bridge, Jiang Qin and Chen Wu, who had dropped down the river in a small boat, passed under the bridge. Though the arrows fell in clouds on the bank, the two men rushed up and fiercely attacked Yan Yu as he stood on the bridge. Yan Yu fled and Han Dang went in pursuit. But Yan Yu smote up to the west gate of the city into which he entered. Sun Ce laid siege to Wujun both by land and water. For three days no one came out to offer battle. Then at the head of his army, Sun Ce came to the west gate and summoned the warden. An officer of inconsiderable rank came out and stood with one hand resting on a beam while with the other he gave point to his abuse of those below. Quickly Taishi Ci's hands sought his bow and an arrow was on the string. “See me hit that fellow's hand,” said he, turning to his companions. Even as the sound of his voice died away, the bowstring twanged, the arrow sped and lodged in the beam, firmly pinning thereto the officer's hand. Both sides, those on the wall and those below it, marveled and acclaimed at such marksmanship. The wounded man was taken away. When Yan Baihu the White Tiger heard of the exploit, he said, “How can we hope to withstand an army with such people as this in it?” And his thoughts turned toward a peace. He sent his brother Yan Yu out to see Sun Ce, who received him civilly, invited him into the tent, and set wine before him. “And what does your brother propose?” said Sun Ce. “He is willing to share this region with you,” was the reply. “The rat! How dare he put himself on a level with me?” cried Sun Ce. Sun Ce commanded to put the messenger to death. Yan Yu started up and drew his sword; but out flew Sun Ce's blade, and the unhappy messenger fell to the ground. His head was hacked off and sent into the city to his brother. This had its effect. Yan Baihu saw resistance was hopeless, so he abandoned Wujun and fled."

Whenever Rong gave lectures, he would set up a tent, with disciples in the front, prostitutes in the back, and maids lined up around him. Xuan Ting has been teaching for three years, and his eyes are not evil, and he is very strange. When he finished his studies and returned, Rong sighed and said, ""The only one who has learned the secrets of my studies is Zheng Xuan!""

Xuande himself had once been one of his students. Zheng Xuan is famous for his knowledge and love of the Shi Jing – the Book of Songs. If such a man as this would help, Xuande feels there is some hope.","Now Zheng Xuan was a student and a man of great talent, who had long studied under the famed teacher Ma Rong, whose knowledge of the Book of Odes was universally recognized. Whenever Ma Rong lectured, he let fall a curtain behind which were a circle of singing girls. The students were assembled in front of this curtain. Zheng Xuan attended these lectures for three years and never once let his eyes wander to the curtain. Naturally the master admired his pupil. After Zheng Xuan had finished his studies and gone home, Ma Rong praised him to the others, saying, “Only one man has penetrated the inner meaning of my instructions, and that one is Zheng Xuan.” In Zheng Xuan's household, the waiting maids were familiar with the Book of Odes. Once one of the maids opposed Zheng Xuan's wishes, so as punishment she was made to kneel in front of the steps. Another girl made fun of her, quoting from an ode: “What are you doing there in the mire?” The kneeling girl capped the verse from another ode, quoted she: “That was but a simple word I said, Yet brought it wrath upon my head.” Such was the family in which Zheng Xuan had been born.

Ju gave advice and said: ""Yan is good and narrow, although he is brave, he cannot be alone."" Shao said: ""My admiral is not what you and others expected."" Cao Cao urgently proposed to raise his troops to attack the enemy. When Guan Gong heard about it, he went to the prime minister's mansion to see Cao and said, ""I heard that the prime minister is raising troops, and I want to be the front."" Cao said: ""I don't dare to bother the general. Cao led 150,000 troops in three teams. Yu Lu also connected with Liu Yan for emergency documents, and Cao Xian brought fifty thousand troops to Baima in person, and held them against the earth mountain. Looking at the plains and wilderness in front of the mountains, Yan Liang's elite troops of 100,000 were lined up in formation. Cao was horrified and recalled Song Xian, an old general of Lu Bu, and said, ""I heard that you are a fierce general under Lu Bu's subordinates, and now you can fight against Yan Liang."" Yan Liang slashed his sword immediately under the banner of the gate; seeing Song Xian's horse approaching, Liang shouted and greeted him. When the battle was not three, he raised his sword and fell, beheading Song Xian in front of the battle. Cao Cao was shocked and said: ""You are a brave general!"" Wei Xu said: ""Kill my comrade, and I would like to go and report it!"" Cao promised him. Continuing to mount his horse and hold a spear, he scolded Yan Liang before he went out into battle. Liang didn't even talk, but he joined the horses, stabbed the head with a knife, and slashed Wei and continued under the horse. Cao said: ""Who dares to be the one today?"" Xu Huang responded and fought with Yan Liang for twenty times, and he was defeated and returned to the main formation. The generals shuddered. Cao Cao withdrew his army, and Liang Yi led his army to retreat.","The army has as their primary target the city of Baima. As soon as word reaches Cao Cao, he sets out with a force of one hundred and fifty thousand men. The commander of Yuan Shao’s troops is Yan Liang, and, seeing him in the distance, Cao Cao orders Song Xian, a former associate of Lü Bu, to go out and challenge him. No sooner has he done so than Yan Liang cuts Song Xian down with one stroke, earning the grudging admiration of Cao Cao. Furious at the death of his friend, Wei Xu asks permission to challenge Yan Liang. But he lasts no longer than it takes for Yan Liang’s sword to rise and fall. One further challenger, Xu Huang, rides forward, and though he manages to battle Yan Liang for twenty rounds he too fails to kill Yan Liang and retires to his lines. All this deeply troubles the commanders of Cao Cao’s army.","General Yan Liang was appointed to the command of the advance guard, to go to attack Baima. Then Ju Shou first protested, “His mind is too narrow for such a post. He is brave but unequal to such a trust.” “You are not the sort of man to measure my best generals,” replied Yuan Shao. The army marched to Liyang, and Governor Liu Yan of Dongjun sent an urgent call to Xuchang for aid. Cao Cao moved his armies hastily. As soon as the news of battle got about, Guan Yu went to see the Prime Minister and said, “Illustrious Sir, the army is mobilized; I volunteer for the van leader.” “I scarcely dare put you to such inconvenience, but presently, if need arises, I will call upon you.” So Guan Yu retired, and one hundred fifty thousand soldiers marched out in three directions. On the road the letters from Liu Yan arrived praying for help, and Cao Cao marched the first fifty thousand troops to Baima and took up a position supported by the hills. In the wide plains in front of them, Yan Liang was encamped with one hundred thousand veterans. Cao Cao was frightened at the force opposed to him and, returning to camp, spoke to Song Xian, who had once served under Lu Bu, saying, “You are one of Lu Bu's famous veteran generals; can you give battle to this Yan Liang?” Song Xian agreed to try. He armed himself, mounted, and rode to the front. Yan Liang was there on horseback, his sword lying crossways. Seeing an opponent approaching, he uttered a loud shout and galloped toward Song Xian. The two met, but after only three bouts, Song Xian fell under a mighty slash from Yan Liang's sword. “What a terrible leader!” said Cao Cao. “He has slain my comrade, I want to go and avenge him,” then cried Wei Xu. Cao Cao bade him go and he rode out, spear set, and in front of the army railed at Yan Liang. Yan Liang replied not a word, but their two steeds came together; and at the first blow from Yan Liang's sword, Wei Xu's forehead was halved. “Now, who again dares face him?” cried Cao Cao. Xu Huang took up the challenge and he went out. The combat endured twenty bouts, and then Xu Huang fled back to his own side. The other generals were now greatly depressed at their failure. Cao Cao withdrew his army, feeling very sad at the loss of two generals in quick succession."

忽左右報曰：“有一路軍馬，鎗刀映日，金鼓震天，前來救駕。”帝打聽是誰，乃郭汜也。帝心轉憂。只聞塢外喊聲大起。原來李傕引兵出迎郭汜，鞭指郭汜而罵曰：“我待你不薄，你如何謀害我？”汜曰：“爾乃反賊，如何不殺你！”傕曰：“我保駕在此，何為反賊？”汜曰：“此乃劫駕，何為保駕？”傕曰：“不須多言！我兩個各不許用軍士，只自併輸贏。贏的便把皇帝取去罷了。”二人便就陣前廝殺。戰到十合，不分勝負。只見楊彪拍馬而來，大叫：“二位將軍少歇，老夫特邀衆官，來與二位講和。”傕、汜乃各自還營。楊彪與朱儁會合朝廷官僚六十餘人，先詣郭汜營中勸和。郭汜竟將衆官盡行監下。衆官曰：“我等為好而來，何乃如此相待？”汜曰：“李傕劫天子，偏我劫不得公卿！”楊彪曰：“一劫天子，一劫公卿，意欲何為？”汜大怒，便拔劍欲殺彪。中郎將楊密力勸，汜乃放了楊彪、朱儁，其餘都監在營中。彪謂儁曰：“為社稷之臣，不能匡君救主，空生天地間耳！”言訖，相抱而哭，昏絕於地。儁歸家成病而死。自此之後，傕、汜每日廝殺，一連五十餘日，死者不知其數。,"Suddenly, there were reports from the left and right, ""There are military horses along the way, with guns and swords reflecting in the sun, golden drums shaking the sky, come to rescue them."" The emperor asked who it was, it was Guo Si. The emperor's heart turned worried. Only heard the shouting outside the dock. It turned out that Li Jue led the troops out to greet Guo Si, whipped Guo Si and cursed, ""I treat you badly, how could you murder me?"" Si said, ""You are a rebel, why not kill you!"" Jue said, """" I’m here to protect you, so what’s a rebel?” Si said, “This is a robbery, so what’s a security guard?” Jue said, “No need to say more! The two of us are not allowed to use sergeants, and we only win and lose. Just take the emperor."" The two of them fought in front of the battle. Fight to ten, no winner or loser. I saw Yang Biao slapping the horse and shouting: ""Two generals, rest, this old man specially invited all the officials to come and make peace with the two."" Jue and Si Nai returned to their respective camps. Yang Biao and Zhu Jun joined more than 60 officials of the imperial court and first went to Guo Si's camp to persuade them to make peace. Guo Si actually put all the officials in prison. The officials said, ""I've come here for good, so why treat each other like this?"" Si said, ""Li Jue robbed the emperor, but I can't rob the minister!"" Yang Biao said, ""One robbery of the emperor, one robbery of the minister, what do you want to do? ?"" Si was furious and drew his sword to kill Biao. Zhonglang's general Yang Mi persuaded Yang Mi to release Yang Biao and Zhu Jun, and the rest were imprisoned in the camp. Biao said to Jun: ""As a minister of the Sheji, I can't help the lord and savior, and my ears are empty!"" After saying this, he hugged each other and cried, and fell unconscious to the ground. Jun returned home and fell ill and died. Since then, Jue and Si have been fighting every day for more than 50 days, and the number of dead is unknown.","Lady Guo, determined to undermine what she believes is an affair, slips some poison into the food, and just as Guo is about to eat it she cries, ‘No. We cannot trust this food sent from outside.’ So saying, she gives a little of the food to their pet dog, who convulses in agony and dies before their very eyes. From that day forward, Guo Si never trusts Li Jue again. Another time, Li Jue and Guo Si have been drinking to excess, and this gives Guo Si indigestion. Lady Guo is able to persuade him that he has been poisoned by Li Jue. In revenge he plans to launch his branch of the rebel army in an attack on Li Jue. When word of this reaches Li Jue he decides to strike first. In the mayhem that ensues when the two groups of soldiers clash, Li Jue orders his nephew Li Xian to break off and secretly capture the emperor and the empress.","Suddenly some one came in with the tidings that a force of cavalry, their sabers glittering in the sun, was approaching to rescue them. Then they heard the gongs beat and the roll of the drums. The Emperor sent to find out who it was. But it was Guo Si, and the sadness fell again. Presently arose a great din. For Li Jue had gone out to do battle with Guo Si, whom he abused by name. “I treated you well and why did you try to kill me?” said Li Jue. “You are a rebel, why should I not slay you?” cried Guo Si. “You call me rebel when I am guarding the Emperor?” “You have abducted him; do you call that guarding?” “Why so many words? Let us forgo a battle and settle the matter in single combat, the winner to take the Emperor and go.” The two generals fought in front of their armies, but neither could prevail over the other. Then they saw Yang Biao come riding up to them, crying, “Rest a while, O Commanders! For I have invited a party of officers to arrange a peace.” Wherefore the two leaders retired to their camps. Soon Yang Biao, Zhu Jun, and sixty other officials came up and went to Guo Si's camp. They were all thrown into confinement. “We came with good intentions,” they moaned, “and we are treated like this.” “Li Jue has run off with the Emperor; I have to have the officers,” said Guo Si. “What does it mean? One has the Emperor, the other his officers. What do you want?” said Yang Biao. Guo Si lost patience and drew his sword, but Commander Yang Mi persuaded him not to slay the speaker. Then Guo Si released Yang Biao and Zhu Jun but kept the others in the camp. “Here are we two officers of the Throne, and we cannot help our lord. We have been born in vain,” said Yang Biao to Zhu Jun. Throwing their arms about each other, they wept and fell swooning to the earth. Zhu Jun went home, fell seriously ill and died. Thereafter the two adversaries fought every day for nearly three months each losing many soldiers."
周瑜旣領南郡，愈思報讎，遂上書吳侯，乞命魯肅去討還荊州。孫權乃命肅曰：“汝昔保荊州與劉備，今備遷延不還，等待何時？”肅曰：“文書上明白寫着，得了西川便還。”權叱曰：“只說取西川，至今又不動兵，不等老了人！”肅曰：“某願往言之。”遂乘船投荊州而來。,"Zhou Yuyan led Nanjun, thinking more and more about retribution, he wrote to Marquis Wu, begging Lu Su to go to Jingzhou. Sun Quan then ordered Su to say, ""You have protected Jingzhou and Liu Bei in the past, but now you will not be able to pay it back. When will you wait?"" Su said, ""It is clearly written in the document that you will pay back when you get Xichuan."" So far, I haven't used troops, and I can't wait for old people!"" Su said: ""I would like to go and talk about it."" Then he took a boat and went to Jingzhou.","His plot is to have Zhou Yu given a senior appointment as governor of Nanjun, elevate Cheng Pu as governor of Jiangxia and give Hua Xin a post of honour at court. ‘That will set Zhou Yu against Xuande as his greatest rival and we can sit back and watch them destroy each other. How about that for an idea?’ And so it comes to pass. As Cheng Yu foresaw, the appointment hardens Zhou Yu’s desire for revenge on Xuande and Kong Ming.","Having taken over his command, the former thought all the more of the revenge he contemplated and, to bring matters to a head, he wrote to Sun Quan asking him to send Lu Su and renew the demand for the rendition of Jingzhou. Wherefore Lu Su was summoned, and his master said to him, “You are the guarantor in the loan of Jingzhou to Liu Bei. He still delays to return it, and how long am I to wait?” “The writing said plainly that the rendition would follow the occupation of Yiazhou.” Sun Quan shouted back, “Yes it said so. But so far they have not moved a soldier to the attack. I will not wait till old age has come to us all.” “I will go and inquire?” said Lu Su. So he went down into a ship and sailed to Jingzhou."

却說曹操知周瑜毁書斬使，大怒，便喚蔡瑁、張允等一班荊州降將為前部。操自為後軍，催督戰船，到三江口。早見東吳船隻，蔽江而來。為首一員大將，坐在船頭上大呼曰：“吾乃甘寧也！誰敢來與我決戰？”蔡瑁令弟蔡（王熏）前進。兩船將近，甘寧拈弓搭箭，望蔡（王熏）射來，應弦而倒。寧遂驅船大進，萬弩齊發。曹軍不能抵當。右邊蔣欽，左邊韓當，直衝入曹軍隊中。曹軍大半是靑、徐之兵，素不習水戰，大江面上，戰船一擺，早立脚不住。甘寧等三路戰船，縱橫水面。周瑜又催船助戰。曹軍中箭着礮者，不計其數。從巳時直殺到未時，周瑜雖得利，只恐寡不敵衆，遂下令鳴金收住船隻。曹軍敗回。操登旱寨，再整軍士，喚蔡瑁、張允責之曰：“東吳兵少，反為所敗，是汝等不用心耳！”蔡瑁曰：“荊州水軍，久不操練；靑、徐之軍，又素不習水戰：故爾致敗。今當先立水寨，令靑、徐軍在中，荊州軍在外，每日敎習精熟，方可用之。”操曰：“汝旣為水軍都督，可以便宜從事，何必稟我？”於是張、蔡二人，自去訓練水軍。沿江一帶分二十四座水門，以大船居於外為城郭，小船居於內，可通往來。至晚點上燈火，照得天心水面通紅。旱寨三百餘里，煙火不絕。,"However, Cao Cao was furious when he knew that Zhou Yu had destroyed the book and executed the envoys, so he called Cai Mao, Zhang Yun and a group of Jingzhou to surrender to the front. Cao Zi was the rear army, urging the warship to go to Sanjiangkou. I saw the Soochow ships early and came across the river. The chief general, sitting on the bow of the boat, shouted, ""I am Gan Ning! Who dares to come and fight me?"" Cai Mao ordered his younger brother Cai (Wang Xun) to advance. As the two ships approached, Gan Ning took a bow and set an arrow, Wang Cai (Wang Xun) shot it, and fell in response. Ning Sui drove the boat forward, and ten thousand crossbows were fired. Cao's army could not stand up. Jiang Qin on the right and Han Dang on the left rushed straight into Cao's army. Most of Cao's army were soldiers of Qi and Xu, who were not familiar with water warfare. Gan Ning waited for the three-way warships to cross the water. Zhou Yu urged the boat to help in the battle. There were countless arrows in Cao's army with arrows. From the moment until the next moment, although Zhou Yu gained a profit, he was afraid that he would be outnumbered, so he ordered Ming Jin to take the boat. Cao's army was defeated. Cao Denghanzhai, reorganized the sergeants, called Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, and said: ""Eastern Wu's soldiers are few, but they are defeated, you are not using your heart!"" Cai Mao said: ""Jingzhou navy, I haven't practiced for a long time; , and I have never been accustomed to water warfare: so you are defeated. Now you should build a water village first, and have the army of Jin and Xu in the middle, and the army of Jingzhou outside, and you can use it every day."" Cao said: ""Ruyi is Commander of the navy, you can do it cheaply, so why bother with me?"" So Zhang and Cai went to train the navy on their own. There are twenty-four water gates along the river, with large boats living outside as the city, and small boats living inside, which can lead to and from. At night, when the lights are on, the water in the heart of the sky is red. The dry village is more than 300 miles away, and the fireworks are endless.","Enraged by the murder of his envoy, Cao Cao sets in motion preparations for the battle. Command of his army is given to Cai Mao, and the troops are put on board the battleships ready to attack. Soon they see the massed flotilla of Zhou Yu’s navy approaching, led by Gan Ning, who shouts, ‘Here I come – and who will stop me?’ Cai Mao’s younger brother, Cai Xun, is sent to attack him, but just one shot from Gan Ning’s bow slays him. Gan Ning’s southern troops then open fire from their boats, creating utter chaos among the northerners. They simply are not used to naval conflict, and thousands fall as the arrows rain down upon them as they huddle, seasick, in the boats. Gan Ning inflicts a crushing defeat on the soldiers of Cao Cao, but Zhou Yu, worried by the superior numbers of Cao Cao’s army, pulls his men back before they can utterly crush the northerners. The humiliation stirs Cao Cao into ordering that Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, who are, of course, experienced in naval warfare, should establish a training centre where the landlubber soldiers can be trained to fight on water. The sheer industrial and training scale of this undertaking and the size of the army mean that at night the sky is bright with the furnaces, fires and lights of the northern army.","Cao Cao was greatly angered when he heard that his letter had been torn to fragments, and he resolved to attack forthwith. His advance was led by the Supreme Admiral Cai Mao, the Vice-Admiral Zhang Yun, and others of the Jingzhou officers who had joined his side. Cao Cao went as hastily as possible to the meeting of the three rivers and saw the ships of the South Land sailing up. In the bow of the foremost ship stood a fine figure of a warrior who cried, “I am Gan Ning; I challenge any one to combat.” Cai Mao sent his young brother, Cai Xun, to accept the challenge; but as Cai Xun's ship approached, Gan Ning shot an arrow and Cai Xun fell. Gan Ning pressed forward, his crossbowmen keeping up a heavy discharge which Cao Cao's troops could not stand. The wings of Han Dang from the left and Jiang Qin from the right also joined in. Cao Cao's soldiers, being mostly from the dry plains of the north, did not know how to fight effectually on water, and the southern ships had the battle all their own way. The slaughter was very great. However, after a contest lasting till afternoon, Zhou Yu thought it more prudent, in view of the superior numbers of his enemy, not to risk further the advantage he had gained. So he beat the gongs as the signal to cease battle and recall the ships. Cao Cao was worsted, but his ships returned to the bank, where a camp was made and order was restored. Cao Cao sent for his defeated leaders and reproached them, saying, “You did not do your best. You let an inferior force overcome you.” Cai Mao defended himself, saying, “The Jingzhou marines have not been exercised for a long time, and the others have never been trained for naval warfare at all. A naval camp must be instituted, the northern soldiers trained and the Jingzhou force drilled. When they have been made efficient, they will win victories.” “If you know what should be done, why have you not done it?” said Cao Cao. “What is the use of telling me this? Get to work.” So Cai Mao and Zhang Yun organized a naval camp on the river bank. They established twenty-four “Water Gates,” with the large ships outside as a sort of rampart, and under their protection the smaller ships went to and fro freely. At night when the lanterns and torches were lit, the very sky was illuminated, and the water shone red with the glare. On land the smoke of the camp fires could be traced for one hundred mile without a break."

曹操回觀岸上營寨，幾處煙火。黃蓋跳在小船上，背後數人駕舟，冒煙突火，來尋曹操。操見勢急，方欲跳上岸，忽張遼駕一小脚船，扶操下得船時，那隻大船，已自着了。張遼與十數人保護曹操，飛奔岸口。黃蓋望見穿絳紅袍者下船，料是曹操，乃催船速進，手提利刃，高聲大叫：“曹賊休走！黃蓋在此！”操叫苦連聲。張遼拈弓搭箭，覷着黃蓋較近，一箭射去。此時風聲正大，黃蓋在火光中，那裏聽得弓弦響？正中肩窩，翻身落水。正是：,"Cao Cao looked back at the camp on the shore, and there were several fireworks. Huang Gai jumped on the small boat, and a few people behind him drove the boat, smoking and bursting into flames, to find Cao Cao. Seeing that Cao was in a hurry, Fang was about to jump ashore, but suddenly Zhang Liao drove a small boat, and when Cao got off the boat, the big boat was already free. Zhang Liao and a dozen people protected Cao Cao and flew to the port. When Huang Gai saw the man in the red robe disembark, it was probably Cao Cao, so he urged the boat to speed up, holding a sharp blade, and shouting loudly: ""Cao Thief go away! Huang Gai is here!"" Cao screamed bitterly. Zhang Liao took a bow and an arrow, looked at Huang Gai's approach, and shot an arrow. At this time, the wind was loud, and Huang Gai was in the firelight. Where could you hear the sound of bowstrings? In the middle of the shoulder socket, roll over and fall into the water. Exactly:","Cao Cao looks about him, seeking how to escape. Huang Gai spots him, jumps into a skiff and sets off after him. Zhang Liao drives through to rescue him in a small boat, and Cao Cao leaps in, and now it is a race to see who lands first. ‘Stop, you traitor,’ roars Huang Gai, waving his sword. ‘ Huang Gai has indeed come!’ But these are his last words of defiance to Cao Cao. Zhang Liao fires an arrow, which takes Huang Gai full in the armpit, and, felled by this blow, he falls into the river.","Cao Cao hastened toward the shore. Huang Gai, with a few troops at his back, leaped into a small boat, dashed through the fire, and sought Cao Cao. Cao Cao, seeing the imminence of the danger, was making for the land; Zhang Liao got hold of a small boat into which he helped his master; none too soon, for the ship was burning. They got Cao Cao out of the thick of the fire and dashed for the bank. Huang Gai, seeing a handsomely robed person get into a small boat, guessed it must be Cao Cao and pursued. He drew very near and he held his keen blade ready to strike, crying out, “You rebel! Do not flee. I am Huang Gai.” Cao Cao howled in the bitterness of his distress. Zhang Liao fitted an arrow to his bow and aimed at the pursuer, shooting at short range. The roaring of the gale and the flames kept Huang Gai from hearing the twang of the string, and he was wounded in the shoulder. He fell and rolled over into the water. He fell in peril of water"

且說徐庶當晚密使近人去各寨中暗布謠言。次日，寨中三三五五，交頭接耳而說。早有探事人報知曹操，說：“軍中傳言西涼州韓遂、馬騰謀反，殺奔許都來。”操大驚，急聚衆謀士商議曰：“吾引兵南征，心中所憂者，韓遂、馬騰耳。軍中謠言，雖未辨虛實，然不可不防。”言未畢，徐庶進曰：“庶蒙丞相收錄，恨無寸功報効。請得三千人馬，星夜往散關把住隘口。好有緊急，再行告報。”操喜曰：“若得元直去，吾無憂矣。散關之上，亦有軍兵，公統領之。目下撥三千馬步軍，命臧霸為先鋒，星夜前去，不可稽遲。”徐庶辭了曹操，與臧霸便行。——此便是龐統救徐庶之計。後人有詩曰：,"Let's say that Xu Shu secretly dispatched his neighbors to secretly spread rumors in the villages that night. The next day, there were three, three, five, five in the village, whispering to each other. A detective had already reported to Cao Cao, saying: ""There are rumors in the army that Han Sui and Ma Teng in Xiliang Province have rebelled and rushed to Xudu to kill him."" Cao was shocked and hurriedly gathered his advisors to discuss and said, ""I lead troops to the south, and I am in my heart. Those who are worried are Han Sui and Ma Teng’er. Although there are rumors in the army, although the truth is not identified, it must be avoided.” Before the words were finished, Xu Shujin said: “The shu has been included by the Prime Minister, and I hate that there is no merit in retribution. Please get 3,000. People and horses, Xingye go to Sanguan to hold the pass. If there is an emergency, I will report again."" Cao Xi said, ""If I get Yuanzhi and go, I will have no worries. Above the Sanguan, there are also soldiers, and the public commander. Dispatch an army of 3,000 horses and order Zang Ba to be the vanguard, and go on the starry night without delay."" Xu Shu resigned from Cao Cao and went with Zang Ba. ——This is Pang Tong's plan to save Xu Shu. A later poem says:","Xu Shu returns to the camp and begins his plot. He starts to spread rumours that Generals Han Sui and Ma Teng are advancing from the north on the capital. These rumours soon spread like wildfire among the troops until they reach the ears of Cao Cao himself. This is the only anxiety Cao Cao has had about coming south to attack Wu. At a hastily summoned meeting of his advisers, he asks for suggestions. This is when Xu Shu stands up and volunteers to take a force to defend their rear position at the San pass. ‘If there is any crisis I will be able to report this to you straight away,’ he says. Cao Cao is delighted and agrees to this with alacrity. Pan Tong’s plan has worked! Xu Shu has Cao Cao’s permission to leave and to place a great distance between himself and the battlefront. Cao Cao surges south, but behind him","His friend gone, Xu Shu mischievously spread certain rumors in the camp, and next day were to be seen everywhere soldiers in small groups, some talking, others listening, heads together and ears stretched out, till the camps seemed to buzz. Some of the officers went to Cao Cao and told him, saying, “A rumor is running around the camps that Han Sui and Ma Teng are marching from Xiliang to attack the capital.” This troubled Cao Cao, who called together his advisers to council. Said he, “The only anxiety I have felt in this expedition was about the possible doings of Han Sui and Ma Teng. Now there is a rumor running among the soldiers, and though I know not whether it be true or false, it is necessary to be on one's guard.” At this point Xu Shu said, “You have been kind enough to give me an office, Sir, and I have really done nothing in return. If I may have three thousand troops, I will march at once to San Pass and guard this entrance. If there be any pressing matter, I will report at once.” “If you would do this, I should be quite at my ease. There are already troops beyond the Pass, who will be under your command, and now I will give you three thousand of horse and foot, and Zang Ba shall lead the van and march quickly.” Xu Shu took leave of the Prime Minister and left in company with Zang Ba. This was Pang Tong's scheme to secure the safety of Xu Shu. A poem says:"

時值初冬，陰雲布合，雪花亂飄，軍馬皆冒雪布陣。雲長驟馬提刀而出，大叫王忠打話。忠出曰：“丞相到此，緣何不降？”雲長曰：“請丞相出陣，我自有話說。”忠曰：“丞相豈肯輕見你！”雲長大怒，驟馬向前。王忠挺鎗來迎。兩馬相交，雲長撥馬便走。王忠趕來，轉過山坡，雲長回馬，大叫一聲，舞刀直取。王忠攔截不住，恰待驟馬奔逃，雲長左手倒提寶刀，右手揪住王忠勒甲縧，拖下鞍鞽，橫擔於馬上，回本陣來。王忠軍四散奔走。雲長押解王忠，回徐州見玄德。玄德問：“爾乃何人？見居何職？敢詐稱曹丞相！”忠曰：“焉敢有詐？奉命敎我虛張聲勢，以為疑兵。丞相實不在此。”玄德敎付衣服酒食，且暫監下，待捉了劉岱，再作商議。雲長曰：“某知兄有和解之意，故生擒將來。”玄德曰：“吾恐翼德躁暴，殺了王忠，故不敎去。此等人殺之無益，留之可為解和之地。”張飛曰：“二哥捉了王忠，我去生擒劉岱來！”玄德曰：“劉岱昔為兗州刺史，虎牢關伐董卓時，也是一鎮諸侯。今日為前軍，不可輕敵。”飛曰：“量此輩何足道哉！我也似二哥生擒將來便了！”玄德曰：“只恐壞了他性命，誤我大事。”飛曰：“如殺了，我償他命！”玄德遂與軍三千。飛引兵前進。,"It was early winter, cloudy clouds were gathering, snowflakes were fluttering, and all the troops and horses were arrayed in the snow. Yun Chang suddenly came out with his sword in hand, and yelled at Wang Zhong to talk. Zhong Chu said, ""The prime minister is here, why didn't he come down?"" Yun Chang said, ""Please come out, the prime minister, I have something to say."" Zhong said, ""How could the prime minister be willing to see you lightly!"" Yun Chang was angry and rushed forward. Wang Zhong greeted him with a gun. When the two horses crossed, Yun Chang plucked the horse and left. Wang Zhong came, turned around the hillside, Yunchang returned to his horse, shouted loudly, and took it straight with a sword. Wang Zhong couldn't stop it, and just as the horses fled, Yun Chang held the treasured saber in his left hand, grabbed Wang Zhong's armoured sash with his right hand, pulled down the saddle, and carried it across the horse, returning to his original formation. Wang Zhongjun ran in all directions. Chang Yun escorted Wang Zhong and returned to Xuzhou to see Xuande. Xuande asked: ""Who are you? What position do you see? You dare to call yourself Prime Minister Cao!"" Zhong said: ""How dare you cheat? I was ordered to bluff, thinking I was a suspicious soldier. The Prime Minister is not here."" Xuande ordered clothes, wine and food , and temporarily under prison, until Liu Dai is captured, and then negotiate. Yunchang said: ""A certain brother has the intention of reconciliation, so he captured the future alive."" Xuande said: ""I am afraid that Yide will be violent and will kill Wang Zhong, so I will not send them away. It is useless to kill such people, so I can keep them It is a place for reconciliation."" Zhang Fei said: ""Second brother captured Wang Zhong, I will go and capture Liu Dai alive!"" Xuande said: ""Liu Dai was the prefect of Yanzhou in the past, and he was also a prince of a town when Dong Zhuo was attacked at Hulao Pass. The former army, don't underestimate the enemy."" Fei said: ""How can you judge this generation! I am also like the second brother who will be captured in the future!"" Xuande said: ""I'm only afraid of ruining his life and mistaking me for a major event."" Fei said: "" If killed, I will pay for his life!"" Xuande then joined three thousand troops. Fly troops forward.","He challenges Wang Zhong to single combat, captures him, scatters the enemy troops and brings him back a prisoner to Xuzhou. Desperate to have a go, Zhang Fei is allowed to go out to try to capture Liu Dai. For days he tries to taunt Liu Dai to attack but without success. So Zhang Fei plans a trick. Seizing a perfectly innocent soldier from his own ranks, he has him beaten. Then he declares that the man will be sacrificed the next day to bring good fortune on the army. This is in order that the army can attack Liu Dai’s camp the following day. He even spells out how the attack will take place as the poor soldier is being beaten. To add to a sense of chaos, he pretends to be drunk. To the enemy this gives the impression of an army out of control. But secretly Zhang Fei has the soldier released, and of course he flees to the opposing army and tells them of the ‘impending attack’.","It was then early winter, and snow was falling from a gloomy sky. They marched regardless of the snow and came near Wang Zhong's camp with arms all ready to attack. Guan Yu summoned Wang Zhong to a parley. “The Prime Minister is here; why do you not surrender?” said Wang Zhong. “Beg him to come to the front, for I would speak with him,” replied Guan Yu. “Is he likely to come out to see such as you,” said Wang Zhong. Guan Yu angrily dashed forward, and Wang Zhong set his spear to meet him. Guan Yu rode till he came close to his antagonist, then suddenly wheeled away. Wang Zhong went after him and followed up a slope. Just as they passed the crest, Guan Yu suddenly wheeled again, shouted, and came on flourishing the mighty sword. Wang Zhong could not withstand that and fled. But Guan Yu, changing the huge sword to his left hand, with his right laid hold of his victim by the straps of his breastplate, lifted him out of the saddle, and rode away to his own lines with the captive laid across the pommel of his saddle. Wang Zhong's army scattered. The captive was sent to Xuzhou, where he was summoned into the presence of Liu Bei. “Who are you? What office do you hold? How dare you falsely display the ensigns of the Prime Minister?” said Liu Bei. “What do you mean by falsely when I simply obeyed my orders?” said Wang Zhong. “My master wanted to produce the impression that he was present. Really he was not there.” Liu Bei treated him kindly, giving him food and clothing; but put him in prison till his colleague could be captured. Guan Yu said to Liu Bei, “I knew you had peaceful intentions in your mind; therefore, I captured Wang Zhong instead of slaying him.” “I was afraid of Zhang Fei's hasty and impulsive temper,” said Liu Bei. “He would have slain this man. So I could not send him. There is no advantage in killing persons of this sort, and while alive they are often useful in amicable settlements.” Here Zhang Fei said, “You have got this Wang Zhong; now I will go and get the other man.” “Be careful,” said Liu Bei. “Liu Dai was once Imperial Protector of Yanzhou, and he was one of the nobles who met at Tiger Trap Pass to destroy Dong Zhuo. He is not to be despised.” “I do not think him worth talking about so much. I will bring him in alive just as Second Brother did this other.” “I fear that if his life be lost, it may upset our designs,” said Liu Bei. “If I kill him, I will forfeit my own life,” said Zhang Fei. So he was given three thousand soldiers and went off quickly."
却說夏侯惇敗回許昌，自縛見曹操，伏地請死。操釋之。惇曰：“惇遭諸葛亮詭計，用火攻破我軍。”操曰：“汝自幼用兵，豈不知狹處須防火攻？”惇曰：“李典、于禁曾言及此，悔之不及！”操乃賞二人。惇曰：“劉備如此猖獗，眞腹心之患也，不可不急除。”操曰：“吾所慮者，劉備、孫權耳；餘皆不足介意。今當乘此時掃平江南。”便傳令起大兵五十萬，令曹仁、曹洪為第一隊，張遼、張郃為第二隊，夏侯淵、夏侯惇為第三隊，于禁、李典為第四隊，操自領諸將為第五隊。每隊各引兵十萬。又令許褚為折衝將軍，引兵三千為先鋒。選定建安十三年秋七月丙午日出師。,"But he said that Xiahou Dun was defeated and returned to Xuchang, bound himself to see Cao Cao, fell to the ground and asked to die. Manipulate it. Dun said: ""Dun was attacked by Zhuge Liang's tricks and used fire to attack our army."" Cao said, ""You have used soldiers since you were young, don't you know that you need to fire in narrow places?"" Dun said: ""Li Dian, Yu Jin once said this, and I regret it too late! ""Cao is a reward for the two of them. Dun said: ""Liu Bei is so rampant, and the troubles in the heart and the heart must be eliminated urgently."" Cao said: ""The people I am concerned about are Liu Bei and Sun Quan'er; With 500,000 troops, Cao Ren and Cao Hong were the first team, Zhang Liao and Zhang He were the second team, Xiahou Yuan and Xiahou Dun were the third team, Yu Jin and Li Dian were the fourth team, and Cao Zi led Zhujiang to the fifth team. Each team has 100,000 troops. He also made Xu Chu the general Zhechong, and led three thousand troops as the vanguard. Selected Jian'an thirteenth year in the autumn of July Bing noon to leave the division.",What Kong Ming knows is that Liu Biao is dying and that instead of trying to defend a small place like Xinye they should move immediately to Jingzhou. At the same time Cao Cao prepares to invade the south and appoints five commanders to oversee his vast half a million strong army. Only one man speaks out against the impending war and that is the imperial teacher Kong Rong. He opposes the war because it is against members of the imperial family.,"When Xiahou Dun reached the capital, he presented himself to his master in bonds and craved death. But his master loosed him and let him tell his tale. And he said, “I was the victim of Zhuge Liang's evil machinations; he attacked with fire.” “As a soldier from your youth, you should have remembered that fire was a likely weapon in narrow roads.” “Li Dian and Yu Jin reminded me; I am sorry enough now.” Cao Cao rewarded Li Dian and Yu Jin who had warned their leader. “Liu Bei as strong as he is now certainly is a menace to our existence, and he must be quickly destroyed,” said Xiahou Dun. “He is one of my anxieties,” replied Cao Cao. “Sun Quan is the other. The rest do not count. We must take this chance to sweep the south clean.” Then orders were issued to prepare an army of five hundred thousand troops, in five divisions of ten legions each. Each division had two leaders: Cao Ren and Cao Hong were in command of the first division; Zhang Liao and Zhang He, the second; Xiahou Dun and Xiahou Yuan, the third; Yu Jin and Li Dian, the fourth. The fifth body was led by Cao Cao himself. The van was commanded by Xu Chu. The “horse” day of the seventh moon of the thirteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity was fixed for the march (AD 208)."
玄德見縛劉岱過來，慌下馬解其縛曰：“小弟張飛誤有冒瀆，望乞恕罪。”遂迎入徐州，放出王忠，一同管待。玄德曰：“前因車胄欲害備，故不得不殺之。丞相錯疑備反，遣二將軍前來問罪。備受丞相大恩，正思報効，安敢反耶？二將軍至許都，望善言為備分訴，備之幸也。”劉岱、王忠曰：“深荷使君不殺之恩，當於丞相處方便，以某兩家老小保使君。”玄德稱謝。次日盡還原領軍馬，送出郭外。劉岱、王忠不上十餘里，一聲鼓響，張飛攔路大喝曰：“我哥哥忒沒分曉！捉住賊將如何又放了？”諕得劉岱、王忠在馬上發顫。張飛睜眼挺鎗趕來，背後一人飛馬大叫：“不得無禮！”視之，乃雲長也。劉岱、王忠方纔放心。雲長曰：“旣兄長放了，吾弟如何不遵法令？”飛曰：“今番放了，下次又來。”雲長曰：“待他再來，殺之未遲。”劉岱、王忠連聲告退曰：“便丞相誅我三族，也不來了。望將軍寬恕。”飛曰：“便是曹操自來，也殺他片甲不回！今番權且記下兩顆頭！”劉岱、王忠抱頭鼠竄而去。,"When Xuande saw Liu Dai coming, he panicked and dismounted from his horse to untie him and said, ""Little brother Zhang Fei has committed a crime by mistake. I hope to beg for forgiveness."" Then he welcomed him into Xuzhou, released Wang Zhong, and took care of him together. Xuande said: ""Because the chariot wanted to be prepared before, so I had to kill it. The prime minister was wrong and suspicious, so he sent the second general to come to ask the guilt. He has received great kindness from the prime minister, and he is thinking of retribution, and dare to oppose him? Second general When you come to Xudu, I hope that good words will be used as a backup and a good luck."" Liu Dai and Wang Zhong said: ""Shenhe has the grace of entrusting the lord not to kill, so it should be convenient for the prime minister to get along, and the old and young of a certain family should protect the lord. "" Xuande thanked him. The next day, the leading horse was restored and sent to Guowai. Liu Dai and Wang Zhong could not travel more than ten li, when a drum sounded, Zhang Fei stopped the road and shouted: ""My brother has no idea! How will you let the thief go?"" Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were immediately trembling. . Zhang Fei came over with his gun open, and a Pegasus behind him shouted, ""Don't be rude!"" Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were relieved just now. Yun Chang said, ""Brother Yan has been released, so why didn't my brother obey the law?"" Fei said, ""I have released it this time, and I will come again next time."" Yun Chang said, ""Wait for him to come again, it will not be too late to kill him."" Liu Dai and Wang Zhong repeatedly retreated and said, ""The prime minister will kill my three clans and will not come. I hope the general will forgive me."" Fei said: ""Even if Cao Cao came here, he would kill him without returning! Heads!"" Liu Dai and Wang Zhong rushed away.","The very next day, Xuande releases Wang Zhong and Liu Dai, asking them to tell Cao Cao that he bears no grudge against Cao Cao.","Then appeared the captive Liu Dai, in bonds. Liu Bei at once dismounted and loosed the cords, saying, “My young brother was rather hasty, but you must pardon him.” So Liu Dai was freed. He was taken into the city, his colleague was released, and both were cared for. Liu Bei said to them, “I could not help putting Imperial Protector Deputy Che Zhou to death when he tried to kill me, but Cao Cao took it as disaffection and sent you two generals to punish me. I have received much kindness from him and certainly would not show ingratitude by killing you. I wish you to speak for me and explain when you get back.” “We are deeply grateful that you spare our lives, and we will certainly do so in gratitude for what our wives and children owe you.” Next day the two leaders and their army were allowed to depart unscathed. But before they had got three miles from the boundary, they heard a mighty shouting and there appeared Zhang Fei barring the road. “My brother made a mistake in letting you go; he did not understand. How could he give freedom to two rebels?” This made the two men quake with fear, but as the fierce eyed warrior with uplifted sword was bearing down upon them, they heard another man galloping up and shouting, “Do not behave so disgracefully!” The newcomer was Guan Yu, and his appearance relieved the unhappy men of all fear. “Why do you stop them since our brother set them free?” cried Guan Yu. “If they are let go today, they will surely come back,” cried Zhang Fei. “Wait till they do, then you may kill them,” replied Guan Yu. The two leaders with one voice cried, “Even if the Prime Minister slay our whole clans, we will never come again. We pray you pardon us.” Said Zhang Fei, “If Cao Cao himself had come, I would have slain him. Not a breastplate should have gone back. But for this time I leave you your heads.” Clapping their hands to their heads the two men scuttled off while the two brothers returned to the city."

公謂元紹曰：“汝不識吾面，何以知吾名？”元紹曰：“離此二十里有一臥牛山。山上有一關西人：姓周，名倉，兩臂有千斤之力，板肋虬髯，形容甚偉；原在黃巾張寶部下為將，張寶死，嘯聚山林。他多曾與某說將軍盛名，恨無門路相見。”關公曰：“綠林中非豪傑托足之處。公等今後可各去邪歸正，勿自陷其身。”元紹拜謝。正說話間，遙望一彪人馬來到。元紹曰：“此必周倉也。”關公乃立馬待之。果見一人，黑面長身，持鎗乘馬，引衆而至；見了關公，驚喜曰：“此關將軍也！”疾忙下馬，俯伏道傍曰：“周倉參拜。”關公曰：“壯士何處曾識關某來？”倉曰：“舊隨黃巾張寶時，曾識尊顏；恨失身賊黨，不得相隨。今日幸得拜見。願將軍不棄，收為步卒，早晚執鞭隨鐙，死亦甘心！”公見其意甚誠，乃謂曰：“汝若隨我，汝手下人伴若何？”倉曰：“願從則俱從；不願從者，聽之可也。”於是衆人皆曰：“願從。”關公乃下馬至車前稟問二嫂。甘夫人曰：“叔叔自離許都，於路獨行至此，歷過多少艱難，未嘗要軍馬相隨；前廖化欲相投，叔旣却之，今何獨容周倉之衆耶？我輩女流淺見，叔自斟酌。”公曰：“嫂嫂之言是也。”遂謂周倉曰：“非關某寡情，奈二夫人不從。汝等且回山中，待我尋見兄長，必來相招。”周倉頓首告曰：“倉乃一粗莽之夫，失身為盜；今遇將軍，如重見天日，豈忍復錯過？若以衆人相隨為不便，可令其盡跟裴元紹去。倉隻身步行，跟隨將軍，雖萬里不辭也！”關公再以此言告二嫂。甘夫人曰：“一二人相從，無妨於事。”公乃令周倉撥人伴隨裴元紹去。元紹曰：“我亦願隨關將軍。”周倉曰：“汝若去時，人伴皆散；且當權時統領。我隨關將軍去，但有住紮處，便來取你。”元紹怏怏而別。,"The Duke asked Yuan Shao, ""You don't know my face, so how do you know my name?"" Yuan Shao said, ""Twenty miles from here there is a mountain of lying cattle. There is a Guanxi man on the mountain: his surname is Zhou, his name is Cang, and his arms have the strength of a thousand catties. Banriqiu beard, described as very majestic; he used to be a general under Zhang Bao’s subordinates of the Yellow Turban, Zhang Bao died and he gathered in the forest. The place. The public and the others can go back to the righteousness in the future, and don't fall into it."" Yuan Shao thanked him. While he was talking, he saw a crowd of people coming. Yuan Shao said: ""This must be Zhou Cang."" Guan Gong immediately waited for him. When I saw a man with a long black face and a long body, armed with a spear and riding a horse, he led the crowd there; when he saw Guan Gong, he was pleasantly surprised and said, ""This is the General of Guan!"" ""Where did the strong man know Guan?"" Cang said: ""When I was with Zhang Bao of the Yellow Turban, I knew Zunyan; I hated losing my body and thieves, so I couldn't follow him. I am fortunate to see you today. I hope the general will not abandon him and be accepted as a foot soldier sooner or later. If you hold the whip and follow the stirrup, you will be willing to die!"" The public saw how sincere his intention was, and he said, ""If you follow me, what will your servants be like?"" Cang said, ""If you want to follow, you will follow; if you don't want to follow, listen to me. It's okay."" So everyone said, ""I would like to obey."" Guan Gong dismounted to the front of the car and asked the second sister-in-law. Mrs. Gan said: ""My uncle left Xudu and traveled alone here on the road. He has gone through many difficulties, but he has never asked the army and horses to follow him. Former Liao Hua wanted to get along with him, but his uncle rejected him. How can I only tolerate Zhou Cang's crowd now? Discuss for yourself."" The Duke said, ""Sister-in-law's words are true."" Then he said to Zhou Cang, ""It's not because of a lack of affection, and Mrs. Nai Er won't follow. You and I will go back to the mountains, and when I find my brother, I will come to recruit him. Zhou Cang immediately reported, ""Cang is a reckless husband who lost his identity and became a thief. Now, if he meets a general, if he sees the sun again, how can he bear to miss it again? If it is inconvenient for everyone to accompany him, he can be ordered to go with Pei Yuanshao. Cang walks alone. , follow the general, even if you don't quit!"" Guan Gong told his second sister-in-law again. Mrs. Gan said: ""One or two people follow each other, so it's not a problem."" Gong Nai ordered Zhou Cang to send someone to accompany Pei Yuanshao. Yuan Shao said: ""I would also like to accompany General Guan."" Zhou Cang said: ""If you go, all your companions will be scattered; and when you are in power, you will be in command. I will go with General Guan, but if there is a place to stay, I will come to fetch you. ""Yuan Shao said goodbye.","‘I will explain what happened,’ says Zhang Liao, ‘when next I see Cai Yang.’ In the light of so many messages from Cao Cao, and with Zhang Liao’s personal assurance, Xiahou Dun has no option but to give in. So he departs with Zhang Liao, but empty-handed. Guan Yu and the two ladies travel on for many days. At one point they are confronted by a gang of robbers – former Yellow Headband rebels who have turned to crime. But when their leader, Zhou Cang, realizes who the warrior leading the convoy is, he leaps from his horse, kneels and begs to be allowed to join Guan Yu.","“You did not recognize me; how then did you know my name?” asked Guan Yu. Pei Yuanshao replied, “Not far from here is a mountain called the Sleeping Bull, where lives a certain Zhou Cang, a very powerful man who came from the west. He has a stiff curly beard and looks very handsome. He also was a commander in the rebel army, who took to the forest when his leader perished. He has told me a lot about you, but I have never had the happiness of seeing you.” Said Guan Yu, “Under the green wood trees is no place for a hero's foot. You would better abandon this depraved life and return to the path of virtue. Do not work out your own destruction.” As they were talking, a troop of horsemen appeared in the distance. They belonged to Zhou Cang, as Pei Yuanshao said, and Guan Yu waited for them to approach. The leader was very dark complexioned, tall, and armed with a spear. As soon as he drew near enough to see, he exclaimed joyfully, “This is General Guan Yu!” In a moment he had slipped out of the saddle and was on his knees by the roadside. “Zhou Cang renders obeisance,” said he. Said Guan Yu, “O Warrior, where have you known me?” “I was one of the Yellow Scarves, and I saw you then. My one regret was that I could not join you. Now that my good fortune has brought me here, I hope you will not reject me. Let me be one of your foot soldiers to be always near you to carry your whip and run by your stirrup. I will cheerfully die for you.” As he seemed thoroughly in earnest, Guan Yu said, “ But if you follow me, what of your companions?” “They may do as they please; follow me or go their ways.” Thereupon they all shouted, “We will follow!” Guan Yu dismounted and went to ask the ladies what they thought of this. Lady Gan replied, “Brother-in-Law, you have traveled thus far alone and without fighters; you have safely passed many dangers and never wanted their assistance. You refused the service of Liao Hua, why then suffer this crowd? But this is only a my view and you must decide.” “What you say, Sister-in-Law, is to the point.” Therefore returning to Zhou Cang, he said, “It is not that I am lacking in gratitude, but my sisters-in-law do not care for a large following. Wherefore return to the mountains till I shall have found my brother, when I will surely call you.” Zhou Cang replied, “I am only a rough uncouth fellow, wasting his life as a brigand. Meeting you, General, is like seeing the full sun in the skies, and I feel that I can never bear to miss you again. As it might be inconvenient for all my people to follow you, I will bid my companion lead them away, but I will come and follow you on foot wherever you go.” Guan Yu again asked his sisters-in-law what they thought of this. Lady Gan said one or two made no difference, and so Guan Yu consented. But Pei Yuanshao was not satisfied with this arrangement and said he wished also to follow. Zhou Cang said, “If you do not stay with the band, they will disperse and be lost. You must take command for the moment and let me accompany General Guan Yu. As soon as he has a fixed abode, I will come to fetch you.” Somewhat discontentedly Pei Yuanshao accepted the situation and marched off; while his one-time colleague joined the train of Guan Yu, and they went toward Runan."
故太尉楊彪：典歷二司，享國極位。操因緣眥睚，被以非罪；榜楚參并，五毒備至；觸情任忒，不顧憲綱。又議郎趙彥：忠諫直言，義有可納，是以聖朝含聽，改容加飾。操欲迷奪時明，杜絕言路，擅收立殺，不俟報聞。又梁孝王：先帝母昆，墳陵尊顯；桑梓松柏，猶宜肅恭；而操帥將吏士，親臨發掘，破棺裸屍，掠取金寶。至令聖朝流涕，士民傷懷！,"Therefore, Taiwei Yang Biao: the second division of the Dianli, enjoys the extreme position of the country. Cao was acquitted because of fate, and was not guilty; the list of Chu was merged, and the five poisons were prepared; He also suggested that Lang Zhao Yan: Loyal and blunt words, righteousness is acceptable, so he listened to the Holy Dynasty, changed his appearance and decorated it. If you want to be deceived, you should stop talking about it, take it without authorization, and kill it without waiting to report it. Also, King Xiao of Liang: The late emperor’s mother Kun, the tomb of the tomb is honored; sangzi and pine and cypress are still very respectful; and the commanding officers and officials came to excavate in person, broke the coffins and naked corpses, and plundered the treasures. To make the Holy Dynasty shed tears, and the people are sad!","For example, moving the capital; murdering officials who disagreed with him; looting the imperial tomb of Prince Xiao, a member of the founding clique of the Zhou dynasty; aiding rebels; and effectively imprisoning the emperor within his own palace by posting his own men around the buildings.","“The late Yang Biao, a man who had filled two of the highest offices of state as Chairs of two boards, because of some petty grudge was, though guiltless, charged with a crime. He was beaten and suffered every form of cruelty. This arbitrary and impulsive act was a flagrant disregard of constitutional rules. “Another victim was the Counselor Zhao Yan. He was faithful in remonstrance, honest in speech, endowed with the highest principles of rectitude. He was listened to at court. His words carried enough weight with the Emperor to cause him to modify his intention and confer reward for outspokenness. Desirous of diverting all power into his own hands and stifle all criticism, Cao Cao presumed to arrest and put to death this censor, in defiance of all legal procedures. “Another evil deed was the destruction of the tomb of Prince Xiao of Liang, the brother of the late Emperor. His tomb should certainly have been respected, even its mulberries and sweetgum trees, its cypresses and its pines. Cao Cao led soldiers to the cemetery and stood by while it was desecrated, the coffin destroyed and the poor corpse exposed. They stole the gold and jewels of the dead. This deed brought tears to the eyes of the Emperor and rent the hearts of all people. Cao Cao also appointed new offices—Commander Who Opens Grave Mounds and General Who Seeks for Gold—whose tracks were marked by desecrated graves and exhumed bodies. Indeed, while assuming the position of the highest officer of state, he indulged the inclination of a bandit, polluting the empire, oppressing the people, a bane to gods and humans. “He added to this by setting up minute and vexatious prohibitions so that there were nets and snares spread in every pathway, traps and pitfalls laid in every road. A hand raised was caught in a net, a foot advanced was taken in an entanglement. Wherefore the people of his regions, Yanzhou and Yuzhou, waxed desperate and the inhabitants of the metropolis groaned and murmured in anger."

When people reported that the Son of Heaven had an edict, Zhuo Tiao called him in. Li Su came to worship. Zhuo said: ""What is the edict of the emperor?"" Su said: ""The emperor has recovered from his illness and wants to meet Wenwu in the Weiyang Palace. It is proposed that the general Zen should be located in the Taishi, so there is this edict."" Zhuo said, ""What is Wang Yun's intention?"" Su said. ""Wang Situ has ordered people to build a 'shouchan platform', just waiting for the lord to come."" Zhuo Daxi said: ""I dreamed of a dragon covering my body at night, and today I received this good news. It's time not to be missed!"" He ordered his confidant Li Li Jue, Guo Si, Zhang Ji, and Fan Chou led the Feixiong army of 3,000 people to guard Liwu, and they drove back to Beijing every day. "". Zhuo Jin resigned from his mother. When my mother was over ninety years old, she asked, ""Where is my son going?"" Zhuo said, ""My son is going to receive Han Chan, and sooner or later my mother will be the empress dowager!"" My mother said, ""I've been trembling with fear recently, and I'm afraid it's not an auspicious omen. ” Zhuo said, “I will be the mother of the country, so there will be surprises in advance!” Then he resigned from his mother and left. Before leaving, he said to Diao Chan, ""I am the Son of Heaven, and I should make you a noble concubine."" Diao Chan knew that he was there, and pretended to be happy to thank him.","The very next day Li Su leaves for Meiwu with the fake imperial decree. When Li Su comes before Dong Zhuo he is asked what this decree is about. ‘ The emperor,’ says Li Su, ‘having recovered from his illness, now wants to discuss with his cabinet his abdication in favour of your honourable self, sir.’ Now it so happens that Dong Zhuo has had a dream the night before. ‘I dreamed,’ says Dong Zhuo, ‘that a dragon had coiled itself around me and now I receive this auspicious message. I will set off as soon as possible.’ Before he leaves he goes to see his ninety-year-old mother. ‘Where are you going, my son?’ she asks. ‘To accept the abdication of the last Han ruler and to become emperor!’ he replies. ‘This means you will become the queen mother.’ She is blunt with him. ‘I’ve a very bad feeling about this. I’ve not felt well for days. I believe this is a bad omen.’ ‘Given you are shortly going to be the mother of the nation, it is not surprising that you should feel apprehension.’ And so saying, he leaves her. Before he departs for the palace he tells Diao Chan that soon she will be his first imperial lady. Bowing, she appears to be delighted and honoured but in her heart she knows what is going to happen next.","Next day Li Su, with a small escort, set out for Meiwo and announced himself as bearer of a decree. He was conducted into Dong Zhuo's presence. After he had made his obeisance, Dong Zhuo asked what the decree was. “His Majesty has recovered and wishes his ministers to meet him in the Palace to consider the question of his abdication in your favor. That is what this summons means.” “What does Wang Yun think of the scheme?” “Wang Yun has already begun the construction of the Terrace of Abdication and only awaits my lord's arrival.” “Last night I dreamed a dragon coiled round my body,” said Dong Zhuo greatly pleased, “and now I get this happy tidings! I must not neglect the opportunity.” So Dong Zhuo gave instructions to his four trusted generals for the safekeeping of his city. Li Jue, Guo Si, Fan Chou, and Zhang Ji were to guard Meiwo with three thousand troops of the Flying Bear Army. Then Dong Zhuo announced his intention of starting on the morrow. “When I am Emperor, you shall be Commander of the Capital District,” said he. “Your minister thanks you,” said Li Su. Dong Zhuo went to bid farewell to his ninety-year-old mother. “Whither are you going, my son?” asked she. “I go to receive the abdication of Han; and soon you will be the Empress.” “I have been feeling nervous and creepy these few days. It is a bad sign.” “Any one about to become the Mother of the State must have premonitions,” said her son. He left her with these words. Just before starting, he said to Diao Chan, “When I am Emperor, you shall be Lady of the Palace.” She bowed low thanking him, but she knew and inwardly rejoiced."
關公割帛束住箭傷，於路恐人暗算，不敢久住，連夜投沂水關來。把關將乃并州人氏：姓卞，名喜，善使流星鎚；原是黃巾餘黨，後投曹操，撥來守關。當下聞知關公將到，尋思一計：就關前鎮國寺中，埋伏下刀斧手二百餘人，誘關公至寺，約擊盞為號，欲圖相害。安排已定，出關迎接關公。公見卞喜來迎，便下馬相見。喜曰：“將軍名震天下，誰不敬仰！今歸皇叔，足見忠義！”關公訴說斬孔秀、韓福之事。卞喜曰：“將軍殺之是也。某見丞相，代稟衷曲。”關公甚喜，同上馬過了沂水關，到鎮國寺前下馬。衆僧鳴鐘出迎。原來那鎮國寺乃漢明帝御前香火院，本寺有僧三十餘人。內有一僧，却是關公同鄕人：法名普淨。當下普淨已知其意，向前與關公問訊，曰：“將軍離蒲東幾年矣？”關公曰：“將及二十年矣。”普淨曰：“還認得貧僧否？”公曰：“離鄕多年，不能相識。”普淨曰：“貧僧家與將軍家只隔一條河。”卞喜見普淨敍出鄕里之情，恐有走泄，乃叱之曰：“吾欲請將軍赴宴，汝僧人何得多言！”關公曰：“不然：鄕人相遇，安得不敍舊情耶？”普淨請關公方丈待茶。關公曰：“二位夫人在車上，可先獻茶。”普淨敎取茶先奉夫人，然後請關公入方丈。普淨以手舉所佩戒刀，以目視關公。公會意，命左右持刀緊隨。卞喜請關公於法堂筵席。關公曰：“卞君請關某，是好意，還是歹意？”卞喜未及回言，關公早望見壁衣中有刀斧手，乃大喝卞喜曰：“吾以汝為好人，安敢如此！”卞喜知事泄，大叫：“左右下手！”左右方欲動手，皆被關公拔劍砍之。卞喜下堂遶廊而走，關公棄劍執大刀來趕。卞喜暗取飛鎚擲打關公。關公用刀隔開鎚，趕將入去，一刀劈卞喜為兩段，隨卽回身來看二嫂。早有軍人圍住，見關公來，四下奔走。關公趕散，謝普淨曰：“若非吾師，已被此賊害矣。”普淨曰：“貧僧此處難容，收拾衣鉢，亦往他處雲游也。後會有期，將軍保重。”關公稱謝，護送車仗，往滎陽進發。,"Guan Gong cut the silk to restrain the arrow wound, and Yu Lu was afraid of plotting against others, so he did not dare to stay for a long time, so he threw himself at Yishui Pass overnight. The gatekeeper was a native of Bingzhou: surnamed Bian, given name Xi, good at Meteor Hammer; originally a member of the Yellow Turban Yu Dang, who later joined Cao Cao and came to guard the gate. When I heard that Guan Gong was coming, I thought about a plan: in the Zhenguo Temple in Guanqian, there were more than 200 swordsmen and axemen in ambush, and they lured Guan Gong to the temple. Arrangements have been made, go out to meet Guan Gong. When the public saw Bian Xi coming to welcome him, he dismounted from his horse to meet him. He said with joy: ""The general's name is so famous all over the world, who doesn't respect him! Now that I return to the emperor, it shows loyalty and righteousness!"" Guan Gong complained about the beheading of Kongxiu and Han Fu. Bian Xi said, ""The general killed him. When he saw the prime minister, he recited the song on his behalf."" Guan Gong was very happy, so he passed the Yishui Pass on the same horse, and dismounted before the Zhenguo Temple. The monks rang their bells to greet them. It turned out that the Zhenguo Temple was the incense house before Emperor Ming of the Han Dynasty, and there were more than 30 monks in the temple. There is a monk in it, but it is Guan Gong and the same people: the Dharma name is Pujing. Now Pujing knew what he meant, and went forward to ask Guan Gong, saying, ""How many years has the general been from Pudong?"" Guan Gong said, ""It will be twenty years."" Pujing said, ""Do you still recognize the poor monk?"" The duke said, ""I have been away from Anli for many years, and I have not known each other."" Pujing said, ""The poor monk's house and the general's house are only separated by a river."" Bian was delighted to see Pujing's narration of his feelings in Anli. ""I want to invite the general to the banquet, why do you monk say so much!"" Guan Gong said: ""Otherwise: when the people meet, why won't they share their old feelings?"" Pu Jing asked Abbot Guan Gong to serve tea. Guan Gong said: ""The two ladies are in the car, you can offer tea first."" Pu Jing took the tea and served it to the wife first, and then asked Guan Gong to enter the abbot. Pu Jing raised the sword he was wearing in his hand and looked at Guan Gong with his eyes. The guild agreed, and ordered the left and right to follow with a knife. Bian Xi invited Guan Gong to a banquet in the court. Guan Gong said: ""Bian Jun asked Guan, is it good intentions or bad intentions?"" Before Bian Xi could reply, Guan Gong had seen the knife and axe in the wall coat, and he shouted at Bian Xi and said, ""I consider you a good person, safe and sound. Dare to do this!"" Governor Bian Xi vented and shouted: ""Left and right strike!"" The left and right were about to strike, but Guan Gong drew his sword and cut him. Bian Xi went down the hall and walked around the corridor, and Guan Gong abandoned his sword and held a big sword to rush. Bian Xi secretly took a flying hammer and threw it against Guan Gong. Guan Gong separated the hammer with a knife, rushed in, and slashed Bian Xi into two sections with one knife, and followed Bian to look at the second sister-in-law. Soldiers had already surrounded him, and when they saw Guan Gong coming, they ran around. When Duke Guan drove away, Xie Pujing said, ""If it wasn't for my teacher, I would have been harmed by this thief."" Pujing said, ""The poor monk can't be tolerated here, so he packs up his robes and travels to other places. There will be a period in the future, generals take care."" Guan Gong thanked him and escorted the chariot to Xingyang.","Guan Yu and the convoy pass through and continue on their way to Luoyang again, with Guan Yu bandaging his arm as he rides. Yet again they come up against a guarded pass. Here the commander, Bian Xi, is much more cunning. He lays a plan to invite Guan Yu for drinks in the Zhenguo temple, and at a given signal – tapping his wine cup – two hundred guards will rush out and overpower Guan Yu. So it is a surprise for Guan Yu when, instead of challenging him, Commander Bian Xi welcomes him. ‘ Your fame goes before you, sir,’ says Bian Xi. ‘I fully appreciate the bonds of loyalty which lead you to depart for Yuan Shao’s lands. Before you go I would like to invite you for a drink at the nearby Buddhist temple.’ Guan Yu is more than happy to agree! However, one of the monks, called Pujing, is from Guan Yu’s home town and has found out about the plot. Through quiet subterfuge and signals which Guan Yu picks up, Pujing warns Guan Yu of the impending attack. Spotting the waiting ambush, Guan Yu denounces Bian Xi. ‘I thought you an honest man!’ Bian Xi, realizing all is up, shouts for his men to attack. Guan Yu draws his mighty sword and sweeps in to attack, slaying Commander Bian Xi and once again scattering the troops. He cuts down the soldiers who are surrounding the ladies’ carriage and then profusely thanks the monk who has saved their lives. ‘I must leave here now,’ says the monk, ‘so I will collect my robe and my alms bowl and set out to wander like a cloud through this world. But we two will meet again, and, until then, take care.’ So on the convoy goes and once again they come to a pass and once again there is trouble.","He bound up his wound, and, fearing lest any one might take advantage of his weakness, he made no long halts on the road but hurried toward River Si Pass. The warden of this pass was Bian Xi of Bingzhou, a warrior whose weapon was a comet-hammer. He had been a Yellow Scarf and had gone over to Cao Cao, who had given him this post. As soon as he heard of the coming of the redoubtable Guan Yu, he cudgeled his brains for a ruse to use against him. He decided upon an ambush. In the Guardian Temple at the pass he placed two hundred ax-men and swordsmen. He reckoned on enticing Guan Yu to the temple for refreshment, and when he let fall a cup as signal, the hidden ruffians would rush out. All being thus arranged and ready, he went out to welcome Guan Yu in friendly guise, and Guan Yu dismounted at his coming. Bian Xi began very amiably. “Your name, General, makes the very earth tremble, and every one looks up to you. This return to the Imperial Uncle proves you to be noble and true.” Guan Yu in reply told him the story of the men he had slain in the last two passes. Bian Xi replied, “You slew them; that is well. When I see the Prime Minister, I will explain to him the inner reasons for these acts.” Guan Yu thought he had found a friend and so mounted and rode through the pass. When he came to the temple, a number of priests came out to meet him with clanging bells. This temple, named Guardian of the State, had a courtyard in which the Emperor Ming had burned incense in the past. In the temple were thirty priests, and among these there happened to be one Pu Jing who came from the same village as Guan Yu. His religious name was Transverse-Peace. Hearing who the visitor was, Transverse-Peace came forward to speak with him. “General,” said Transverse-Peace, “it is many a long year since you left Pudong.” “Yes,” said Guan Yu, “nearly twenty years.” “Do you recognize this poor priest?” “I left the village many years ago; I do not recognize you.” “My house and yours were only separated by a rivulet,” said the priest. Now Bian Xi, seeing Transverse-Peace holding forth about village matters, thought Transverse-Peace would blab about the ambush, so Bian Xi bade him be silent. “I want to invite the General to a feast. You priest fellows seem to have a lot to say,” said Bian Xi. “Not too much,” said Guan Yu. “Naturally when fellow villagers meet, they talk of old times.” Bian Xi invited the visitor into the guest room to take tea, but Guan Yu said, “The two ladies are out there in the carriage; they ought to have some first.” So the priest bade them take some tea to the ladies, and then he led Guan Yu within, at the same time lifting the priest knife which he wore at his side and looking meaningfully at Guan Yu. The latter understood and told his people to bring along his weapon and keep close at his side. When Bian Xi invited Guan Yu to go into the Hall of the Laws for some refreshment, Guan Yu turned to him, saying, “Is this invitation with good intention or evil?” Bian Xi was so taken aback that he could make no reply, and then Guan Yu saw that many armed men were concealed behind the arras. Then Guan Yu shouted loudly at Bian Xi, saying, “What means this? I thought you an honorable man. How dare you?” The traitor saw that his plot had failed and called to the assassins to come out and fall to, but Guan Yu had a short sword in his hand and slashed at any one who came near. So they scattered. Their commander ran down the hall and tried to escape among the side buildings, but Guan Yu threw aside the short sword, took up the green-dragon saber and went after Bian Xi. The latter was trying to get into position to throw his comet-hammer, but Guan Yu cut the cord and the weapon was useless. Guan Yu followed Bian Xi in and out and soon caught up with him. Then with one blow Guan Yu cut him in halves. The fight over, Guan Yu sought the two ladies, who were surrounded by soldiers. These fled at sight of the terrible warrior. Seeking out the priest, his fellow countryman, he thanked him for the timely warning which had saved him from death. “I cannot remain here after this,” said Transverse-Peace. “I shall pack up my few garments and my alms bowl and take to the road, vague in my wanderings as the clouds in the sky. But we shall meet again and till then take care of yourself.” Then Guan Yu took leave and retook the road to Yingyang."
西涼兵到，兩個引軍迎去。西涼軍馬攔路擺開陣勢。馬騰、韓遂聯轡而出，指李蒙、王方罵曰：“反國之賊！誰去擒之？”言未絕，只見一位少年將軍，面如冠玉，眼若流星；虎體猿臂，彪腹狼腰；手執長鎗，坐騎駿馬，從陣中飛出。原來那將卽馬騰之子馬超，字孟起，年方十七歲，英勇無敵。王方欺他年幼，躍馬迎戰。戰不到數合，早被馬超一鎗刺於馬下。馬超勒馬便回。李蒙見王方刺死，一騎馬從馬超背後趕來。超只做不知。馬騰在陣門下大叫：“背後有人追趕！”聲猶未絕，只見馬超已將李蒙擒在馬上。原來馬超明知李蒙追趕，却故意俄延；等他馬近舉鎗刺來，超將身一閃，李蒙搠個空，兩馬相並，被馬超輕舒猿臂，生擒過去。軍士無主，望風奔逃。馬騰、韓遂乘勢追殺，大獲勝捷，直逼隘口下寨，把李蒙斬首號令。,"When the soldiers of Xiliang arrived, the two led them to greet them. The Xiliang army and horses blocked the road and set up a battle. Ma Teng and Han Sui came out of the bridle, pointing at Li Meng and Wang Fang and scolding, ""A traitor against the country! Who will capture him?"" The ape arm, the belly of the wolf waist; the spear in hand, the horse, and flew out of the formation. It turned out that Ma Chao, the son of the general, Ma Teng, whose courtesy name was Meng Qi, was seventeen years old, and he was invincible. Wang Fang bullied him when he was young and jumped to meet him. Before the battle, he was stabbed under the horse by Ma Chao. Ma Chao reined in his horse and returned. Seeing Wang Fang stabbed to death, Li Meng rushed from behind Ma Chao on a horse. Super just do not know. Ma Teng shouted at the gate: ""Someone is chasing behind!"" The voice was still alive, but Ma Chao had already captured Li Meng on his horse. It turned out that Ma Chao knew that Li Meng was chasing, but he deliberately attacked Ye Yan; when Ma Jin stabbed his spear, Chao flashed his body, Li Meng slammed into the air, and the two horses joined each other. The sergeant is without a master, looking for the wind and fleeing. Ma Teng and Han Sui took advantage of the situation to pursue and kill, and they were victorious.","Emboldened by their success, the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si then said to each other, ‘Why don’t we go the whole way and get rid of the emperor and so create our own dynasty?’ Do they succeed? Find out! CHAPTER 10 Ma Teng rises up to defend the emperor. Cao Cao in fury prepares to attack those he believes murdered his family. The two key rebel leaders, Li Jue and Guo Si, want to murder the emperor straight away and seize the throne.","The force from the west arrived; Ma Teng and Han Sui led out their troops to the attack. They found their opponents Li Meng and Wang Fang in battle array. Ma Teng and Han Sui rode to the front side by side. Pointing to the rebel leaders, the commanders abused them, crying, “Those are traitors; who will capture them?” Hardly were the words spoken when there came out a youth general with a clear, white complexion as jade, eyes like shooting stars, lithe of body and strong of limb. He was armed with a long spear and bestrode an excellent steed. This young leader was Ma Chao, son of Ma Teng, then seventeen years of age. Though young he was a supreme valiance. Wang Fang, despising him on account of his youth, galloped forth to fight him. Before they had exchanged many passes Wang Fang was disabled and fell to a thrust of the young Ma Chao's spear. The victor turned to retire into the formation, but Li Meng rode after Ma Chao to avenge his fallen colleague. Ma Chao did not see Li Meng, but his father called out “You are followed!” Hardly had Ma Teng spoken when he saw that the pursuer was a prisoner seated on his son's steed. Now Ma Chao had known he was followed, but pretended not to see, waiting till his enemy should have come close and lifted his spear to strike. Then Ma Chao suddenly wheeled about. The spear thrust met only empty air; and as the horses passed, Ma Chao's powerful arm shot out and pulled Li Meng from the saddle. Thus Li Meng and Wang Fang's soldiers were left leaderless and fled in all directions. The army of Ma Teng and Han Sui dashed in pursuit, and a complete victory was scored. They pressed into one of the passes and made a camp."
設心狠毒非良士，操卓原來一路人。,"Supposed to be vicious and wicked, Cao Zhuo turned out to be all the way.",Cao Cao answers.,In nought does he differ from his enemy Dong Zhuo.
却說衆諸侯分屯洛陽。孫堅救滅宮中餘火，屯兵城內，設帳於建章殿基上。堅令軍士掃除宮殿瓦礫。凡董卓所掘陵寢，盡皆掩閉。於太廟基上，草創殿屋三間，請衆諸侯立列聖神位，宰太牢祀之。祭畢，皆散。堅歸寨中，是夜星日交輝，乃按劍露坐，仰觀天文。見紫微垣中白氣漫漫，堅歎曰：“帝皇不明，賊臣亂國，萬民塗炭，京城一空！”言訖，不覺淚下。,"But it was said that the princes were divided into Luoyang. Sun Jian rescued the remaining fire in the palace, stationed troops in the city, and set up a tent on the foundation of the Jianzhang Palace. Cain ordered the sergeants to sweep away the rubble of the palace. All the tombs that Dong Zhuo dug were covered up. On the foundation of the Taimiao Temple, three rooms were created, and all the princes were invited to enshrine the holy places, and they would be sacrificed to the Tailao. After the sacrifice, all dispersed. In Jianguizhai, the night stars and the sun shine brightly, so I sit on the sword dew and look up at the astronomy. Seeing the white air in the purple wall, he sighed firmly and said: ""The emperor is unknown, the thieves and ministers are in chaos, the people are ruined, and the capital is empty!""","Arriving in the midst the devastated city of Luoyang, Sun Jian orders the fires extinguished, the palaces cleared, the imperial tombs sealed and offerings made to the ancestors. When the ritual is over, Sun Jian stands and looks up to the night sky. Even as he watches, he sees a pale mist shroud the stars of one of the constellations. ‘The imperial star is no longer bright,’ he sighs and, mourning the destruction of the dynasty and the capital city, he falls to his knees and weeps.","They gathered together the few hundreds of soldiers left and then returned to Luoyang. When the confederate lords entered Luoyang, Sun Jian, after extinguishing the fires, camped within the walls, his own tent being set up near the Dynastic Temple. His people cleared away the debris and closed the rifted tombs. The gates were barred. On the site of the Dynastic Temple he put up a mat shed containing three apartments, and here he begged the lords to meet and replace the sacred tablets, with solemn sacrifices and prayers. This ceremony over, the others left and Sun Jian returned to his camp. That night the stars and moon vied with each other in brightness. As Sun Jian sat in the open air looking up at the heavens, he noticed a mist spreading over the stars of the Constellation Draco. “The Emperor's star is dulled,” said Sun Jian with a sigh. “No wonder a rebellious minister disturbs the state, the people sit in dust and ashes, and the capital is a waste.” And his tears began to fall."

After Quan opened the book and read it, he was furious and said, ""Zhang Liao has deceived me too much! You heard that Cheng Pu's army was coming and deliberately made people fight! In the future, I won't need the new army to go to the enemy, watch me fight a battle!"" Looking forward to Hefei. At about the hour of the hour, the army and horses were halfway through, and Cao's troops had already arrived, and formations were formed on both sides. Sun Quan was wearing golden armor and draped his horse; Song Qian on the left, Jia Hua on the right, and Fang Tianhua halberd on the left, guarded on both sides. After the three-way drum, Cao's army was in the formation, the gates and flags were opened, and the three members were all dressed and used to stand in front of the formation: Zhang Liao in the center, Li Dian on the left, and Le Jin on the right. Zhang Liao took the lead with his horses, and dedicated Sun Quan to the decisive battle. Quan Chuo wanted to fight himself with a spear, but one of the generals in the front of the formation came out early with a spear, Taishi Ci. Zhang Liao waved his sword to greet him. The two generals will fight seventy or eighty times, and there will be no winner or loser. Li Dian on the Cao formation said to Yue Jin, ""The golden helmet on the other side is Sun Quan. If Sun Quan is captured, he will be able to report to the 830,000 army."" Shaili took Sun Quan, like an electric light, flew to the front, his hand raised the knife and fell. Song Qian and Jia Hua rushed to cover the frame with the halberd. The swords were everywhere, and the two halberds were cut off, and only the stems of the halberds were hit on the horse's head. Le Jin returned to his horse, and Sergeant Song Qianchuo came with a gun in his hand. Li Dianzhen slammed the arrow, looked at Song Qian's heart and shot, and fell from the horse. Taishi Ci saw that someone had fallen off a horse behind him, so he abandoned Zhang Liao, and returned after seeing the formation. Zhang Liao took advantage of the situation to cover up and attacked, and the Wu soldiers were in chaos and scattered. When Zhang Liao saw Sun Quan, he rushed over on horseback. Look to catch up, smashed out an army in the thorns, and the chief general was Cheng Pu; he intercepted for a while and saved Sun Quan. Zhang Liao withdrew his army from Hengfei.","Hearing that Cheng Pu has arrived, Zhang Liao sends a formal challenge, which Sun Quan takes as a personal insult. He decides to go, without any assistance from Cheng Pu and his newly arrived troops, to fight Zhang Liao with his own troops. It is a good decision by Zhang Liao. When the two armies meet he makes straight for Sun Quan, but Taishi Ci rides to protect him. A side attack on Sun Quan nearly succeeds but is held off by the loyal officers surrounding Sun Quan. When Taishi Ci retreats after a long but ineffectual struggle with Zhang Liao, Zhang charges forward, and the southern army scatters in disarray. Zhang very nearly captures Sun Quan, and if it had not been for the timely intervention of Cheng Pu he would have succeeded. Satisfied with his defence of Hefei, Zhang Liao returns to the city while Sun Quan retreats and watches as the remnants of his defeated army struggle back.","The destruction of Hefei was one day under discussion when one came in to say that Zhang Liao had sent a written challenge to battle. Sun Quan tore open the cover, and what he read therein made him very wrath. “This Zhang Liao has insulted me grossly,” said he. “He hears that Cheng Pu has arrived and sends a challenge. Tomorrow, O newly-come warriors, you shall see me fight with him. You shall have no share in the battle.” Orders were given that next morning the army would move out of camp and advance on Hefei. Early in the morning, when they had advanced about halfway, they met the army of Cao Cao and prepared for battle. Sun Quan, with helmet of gold and breastplate of silver, rode to the front with Song Qian and Jia Hua, each armed with a halberd to support him and guard him one on each side. When the third roll of the drum ceased, the center of Cao Cao's army opened to allow the exit of three warriors, all fully armed. They were Zhang Liao, supported by Li Dian and Yue Jin. Zhang Liao, the central figure, especially designated Sun Quan as the object of his challenge. Sun Quan took his spear and was about to accept the challenge, from when the ranks behind him came out Taishi Ci, who galloped forth with his spear ready to thrust. Zhang Liao whirled up his sword to strike the newcomer, and the two fought near a hundred bouts without a decisive blow. Then said Li Dian to Yue Jin, “He there opposite us with the golden helm is Sun Quan; could we but capture him, the loss of our eight hundred thirty thousand soldiers at the Red Cliffs would be amply avenged.” So speaking Yue Jin rode out, alone, just one man and one sword, and went sidelong toward the two combatants. Then suddenly, swift as a flash of lightning, he ran forward and slashed at Sun Quan. But Sun Quan's two guards were too quick for him. Up went the two halberds of Song Qian and Jia Hua guarding their lord's head. The blow fell, but on the crossed halberds which were shorn through near the head, and in another moment they were hammering away on the head of Yue Jin's steed with the shafts of their broken weapons and forcing it back. Song Qian snatched a spear from a soldier near and went in pursuit of Yue Jin, but Li Dian, on the other side, fitted an arrow to his bow and aimed at Song Qian's heart from behind. And Song Qian fell as the bowstring twanged. Then Taishi Ci, seeing his colleague fell, left off the fight with Zhang Liao and returned to his own line. At this Zhang Liao fell on in a swift attack, and the army of Sun Quan, thrown into confusion, scattered and fled. Zhang Liao, having distinguished Sun Quan in the distance, galloped in pursuit and had nearly come up with him, when Cheng Pu happily rushed in from one side of the line of fight, stayed the pursuit, and saved his master. Zhang Liao withdrew to Hefei."

Yu went to the top of the mountain to watch it, and the Cao army had withdrawn. The next day, suddenly the sound of drums shook the sky again, and the sergeant hurriedly climbed to the heights to wait and see. Zhou Yu asked who would dare to go out first. Han Dang and Zhou Tai came out together and said: ""A certain authority is the vanguard to break the enemy."" Yuxi ordered the villages to strictly guard the defense and not to move lightly. Han Dang and Zhou Tai each sent five sentry ships, and they went out from left to right.","The sound of the war drums reaches Zhou Yu and his men on the south bank, and they prepare for action.","Now a few days before the sound of Cao Cao's drums had been heard on the southern bank, Zhou Yu had watched the maneuvers of the northern fleet on the open river from the top of a hill till the fleet had gone in again. So when the sound of drums was again heard, all the southern army went up the hills to watch the northern fleet. All they saw was a squadron of small ships bounding over the waves. As the northern fleet came nearer, the news was taken to Zhou Yu who called for volunteers to go out against them. Han Dang and Zhou Tai offered themselves. They were accepted and orders were issued to the camps to remain ready for action but not to move till told. Han Dang and Zhou Tai sailed out each with a small squadron of five ships in line."

Gan Ning expected that Huang Zu would go to Jingzhou, so he waited in ambush outside the east gate. Zu led dozens of cavalry out of the east gate. As they were walking, Gan Ning stopped him with a shout. Zu Yu immediately said to Ning, ""I have never treated you lightly, so why are you pushing me now?"" Ning said, ""I used to be in Jiangxia, and I did a lot of meritorious deeds, but you treated me as a robber, what is there to do today? Say?"" Huang Zu knew that it was inevitable, so he drove his horse and left. Gan Ning rushed away from the soldiers and headed straight for the future, only to hear the shouts coming from behind, and several more horses coming. Rather, it is Cheng Pu. Ning was afraid that Pu would come to compete for merit, and hurriedly picked up a bow and arrow, shot Huang Zu in the back, and Zu Zhong's arrow turned over and fell off the horse; Ning Xiao, with his head, returned to the horse and joined Cheng Pu to join forces, returned to Sun Quan, and presented Huang Zu's head. Quan ordered it to be stored in a wooden box, to be sacrificed in front of the dead father's spirit when he returned to Jiangdong. Rewarded the three armies, and promoted Gan Ning to the captaincy. It was discussed that they wanted to divide their troops to defend Jiangxia. Zhang Zhao said: ""The lonely city cannot be defended, so it is better to go back to Jiangdong. Liu Biao knows that I have broken Huangzu, and I will come to repay you; I will wait for the labor, and I will defeat Liu Biao; I will defeat Liu Biao and then take advantage of the situation to attack, and Jingxiang can get it."" Quan Cong said. , then abandoned Jiangxia, and the class teacher returned to Jiangdong.","‘I was kind to you in the past, so why are you attacking me now?’ asks Huang Zu. ‘I worked hard for you, but you treated me as if I were a thief,’ replies Gan Ning. Huang Zu suddenly turns and flees, and Gan Ning rides after him. Fitting an arrow to his bow he shoots Huang Zu, bringing him down from his horse. Dismounting, Gan Ning cuts off Huang Zu’s head. This he brings in a box as a trophy to Sun Quan, who has it taken and offered at the tomb of his father. Knowing that Liu Biao will come to avenge the death of Huang Zu, Sun Quan consolidates his forces to the north.","Now Sun Quan fought against Xiakou. When Huang Zu recognized that he was beaten and could not maintain his position, he abandoned Jiangxia and took the road to Jingzhou. Gan Ning, foreseeing this, had laid an ambush outside the east gate of Jiangxia. Soon after the fugitive, with a small following, had burst out of the gate, he found his road blocked. From horseback, Huang Zu said, “I treated you well in the past; why do you now press me so hard?” Gan Ning angrily shouted, “I did good service for you, and yet you treated me as a pirate. Now what have you to say?” There was nothing to be said, and Huang Zu turned his horse to escape. But Gan Ning thrust aside his troops and himself rode in pursuit. Then he heard a shouting in his rear and saw General Cheng Pu coming up. Fearing lest this other pursuer should overpass him and score the success he desired for himself, Gan Ning fitted an arrow to his bow and shot at the fugitive. Huang Zu was hit and fell from his steed. Then Gan Ning cut off his head. After this, joining himself to Cheng Pu, the two returned bearing the ghastly trophy to their lord. Sun Quan ordered them to place it in a box to be taken back home and offered as a sacrifice to the manes of his father. Having rewarded the soldiers for the victory and promoted Gan Ning, Sun Quan next discussed the advisability of sending a force to hold Jiangxia. But his adviser, Zhang Zhao, said, “It is impossible to try to hold one distant city alone. It is better to return home and prepare for the expedition that Liu Biao will surely send in revenge. We will meet and defeat his worn army, push home the attack, and capture his whole region.” Sun Quan saw the advice was wise, so he left Jiangxia and led his army home to the South Land."

却說曹操在大寨中，與衆將商議，只等黃蓋消息。當日東南風起甚緊。程昱入告曹操曰：“今日東南風起，宜預隄防。”操笑曰：“冬至一陽生，來復之時，安得無東南風？何足為怪？”軍士忽報江東一隻小船來到，說有黃蓋密書。操急喚入。其人呈上書。書中訴說：“周瑜關防得緊，因此無計脫身。今有鄱陽湖新運到糧，周瑜差蓋巡哨，已有方便。好歹殺江東名將，獻首來降。只在今晚二更，船上插靑龍牙旗者，卽糧船也。”操大喜，遂與衆將來到水寨中大船上，觀望黃蓋船到。,"But he said that Cao Cao was in Dazhai, and he discussed with the generals, just waiting for news from Huang Gai. There was a strong southeasterly wind that day. Cheng Yuri told Cao Cao: ""Today the southeast wind is blowing, so it is advisable to prevent the embankment."" Cao laughed and said, ""When the sun rises in the winter solstice, when you come and return, there will be no southeast wind in peace? Why is it strange?"" The boat came and said that there was a secret book by Huang Gai. Urgently call in. The person presented the book. The book tells: ""Zhou Yu is tightly guarded, so he has no plan to escape. Today, there are new grain shipments from Poyang Lake, and Zhou Yu has to build a patrol post, which is convenient. Anyway, kill the famous Jiangdong general and offer his head to surrender. Only at the second watch tonight, The one with the dragon tooth flag planted on the boat is the grain boat."" Cao was overjoyed, so he and the generals came to the big boat in the water village and waited for the Huang Gai boat to arrive.","Back now to Cao Cao, who is waiting for confirmation that Huang Gai has abandoned Zhou Yu and is on his way. Even though the wind has shifted to the southeast, Cao Cao is blasé about it. The letter from Huang Gai arrives, and Cao Cao reads that not only is he planning to come over to Cao Cao but he will also capture the grain ships which are coming to supply Zhou Yu and the southern army. These he will bring as a tribute to Cao Cao.","Cao Cao was in his great camp in conference with his advisers and awaiting the arrival of Huang Gai. The southeast wind was very strong that day, and Cheng Yu was insisting on the necessity for precaution. But Cao Cao laughed, saying, “The Winter Solstice depends upon the sun and nothing else; there is sure to be a southeast wind at some one or other of its recurrences. I see nothing to wonder at.” Just then they announced the arrival of a small boat from the other shore with a letter from Huang Gai. The bearer of the letter was brought in and presented it. Cao Cao read it: “Zhou Yu has kept such strict watch that there has been no chance of escape. But now some grain is coming down river, and I, Huang Gai, have been named as escort commander which will give me the opportunity I desire. I will slay one of the known generals and bring his head as an offering when I come. This evening at the third watch, if boats are seen with dragon toothed flags, they will be the grain boats.” This letter delighted Cao Cao who, with his officers, went to the naval camp and boarded a great ship to watch for the arrival of Huang Gai."
滎陽太守王植，却與韓福是兩親家；聞得關公殺了韓福，商議欲暗害關公，乃使人守住關口。待關公到時，王植出關，喜笑相迎。關公訴說尋兄之事。植曰：“將軍於路驅馳，夫人車上勞困，且請入城，館驛中暫歇一宵，來日登途未遲。”關公見王植意甚慇懃，遂請二嫂入城。館驛中皆鋪陳了當。王植請公赴宴，公辭不往；植使人送筵席至館驛。關公因於路辛苦，請二嫂晚膳畢，就正房歇定；令從者各自安歇，飽餵馬匹。關公亦解甲憩息。,"Wang Zhi, the prefect of Xingyang, was in the same family as Han Fu. He heard that Guan Gong had killed Han Fu, and he negotiated that he wanted to assassinate Guan Gong, so he had someone guard the gate. When Guan Gong arrived, Wang Zhi went out and greeted him with a smile. Guan Gong complained about the search for his brother. Zhi said: ""The general is driving on the road, and the wife is tired from the car, and please enter the city. I will take an overnight rest in the pavilion, and I will not be late for the next day."" The pavilion and the station are all laid out. Wang Zhi invited the public to a banquet, but the public resigned; Zhi envoys sent the banquet to the pavilion. Guan Gong, because of the hard work on the road, asked the second sister-in-law to rest in the main room after dinner, and ordered the servants to rest in peace and feed the horses. Guan Gong also relieved his armor and rested.","The governor of Yingyang, Wang Zhi, is a relative of the murdered Han Fu, the commander at the second pass. So he too decides to confront Guan Yu. Once again the plot is to feign delight at seeing Guan Yu and to offer the exhausted ladies rest and refuge in the city as the guests of Wang Zhi himself. Trusting Wang Zhi, Guan Yu makes sure the ladies are comfortable and then removes his heavy armour and lies down to get some rest.","The Governor of this city was named Wang Zhi, and he was related to Han Fu by their children's marriage. Hearing of the death of his relative, Wang Zhi set about a scheme to kill Guan Yu secretly. He sent soldiers to guard the city gates and, when he heard that Guan Yu approached, he went himself and received Guan Yu with a smiling countenance and bade Guan Yu welcome. Guan Yu told him the object of his journey. “You, General, have been able to get some exercise on the road, but the ladies in their carriage must be cramped and fatigued. I pray you come into the city, and all of you remain the night in the official travelers' quarters. Tomorrow you can set forth again.” The offer was tempting, and his host seemed in earnest, so the two ladies went into the city, where they found everything very comfortably prepared for them. And, though Guan Yu declined the Governor's invitations to a banquet, refreshments for the travelers were sent to their lodgings. Guan Yu was fatigued from the trials of the journey, and as soon as the evening meal was over, he bade the ladies retire to rest while he sat down in the main room, quite alone, for he bade all to get repose while they could. His horse was given a good feed for once. He sat with his armor loosened in order to be more at ease."
次日，獻帝設朝，操表奏玄德軍功，引玄德見帝。玄德具朝服拜於丹墀。帝宣上殿問曰：“卿祖何人？”玄德奏曰：“臣乃中山靖王之後，孝景皇帝閣下玄孫，劉雄之孫，劉弘之子也。”帝敎取宗族世譜檢看，令宗正卿宣讀曰：,"The next day, Emperor Xian set up a court, played Xuande's military exploits, and led Xuande to see the emperor. Xuande worshipped Dan Chi in court. The Emperor Xuan went up to the hall and asked, ""Who is the ancestor?"" Xuande said: ""This subject is the descendant of King Jing of Zhongshan, the great-grandson of Emperor Xiaojing, the grandson of Liu Xiong, and the son of Liu Hong."" The minister read:","He has a pure heart,’ says Xuande. ‘We need men like him.’ Throwing the sword aside, Ca0 Cao smiles and says, ‘I was just joking!’ He himself frees the prisoner and wraps his own cloak around him.","Next day a court was held, and Cao Cao memorialized the services of Liu Bei who was presented to Emperor Xian. Dressed in court robes, Liu Bei bowed at the lower end of the audience arena. The Emperor called him to the Hall and asked his ancestry. Liu Bei replied, “Thy servant is the son of Liu Hong, grandson of Liu Xiong, who was a direct descendant of Prince Faubus of Zhongshan, who was the son of His Majesty the Emperor Myers (circa BC 150).” The Emperor bade them bring forth the Books of the Genealogies, and therefrom a secretary read:"

That night, two craftsmen were brought from outside the camp. Yun Chang looked at him, and recognized one person within him, Sun Qianye. Guan Gong retreated to the left and right, and asked Gan: ""After the Gongzi collapsed, no trace has been heard. Why are you here now?"" Where is Cao Cao? I don't know if Mrs. Gan and Mi are all right?"" Guan Gong explained the previous matter in detail. Gan said: ""I heard that Duke Xuande was at Yuan Shao's place recently, and wanted to go to him, but I couldn't find it convenient. Now Liu and Gong are surrendering to Yuan Shao and assisting Cao. Heaven is fortunate to have the general here, so he ordered a small army to lead the way and teach For the sake of meticulous work, I will report to the general. In the future, the two of them will be defeated for a while, and the public can quickly lead the two ladies to Yuan Shao to meet with Xuande."" Guan Gong said: ""Brother Yan is at Yuan Shao, and I will go there in the starry night. But I hate that I killed the two generals of Shao, and I'm afraid things will change now."" Gan said: ""I should first go to see the truth, and then report to the general."" Gong said: ""I see my brother, even if I die, I will say goodbye when I return to Xuchang now. Cao Cao too."" That night, Sun Qian was secretly sent away. The next day, Guan Gong led his troops out, and Gong Du went into battle. Guan Gong said, ""Why did you turn against the imperial court?"" The capital said, ""You are the one who betrayed the master, why do you blame me?"" Guan Gong said, ""Why am I betraying the ruler?"" From Cao Cao, why?"" Guan Gong didn't even bother, but slapped his horse and danced his sword forward. Gong Du left, and Guan Gong caught up. They all turned around and told Guan Gong, ""The Lord's kindness should not be forgotten. You should advance quickly, and I will let Runan."" Guan Gong understood and drove the army to cover up. Liu and Gong pretended to lose and lose and dispersed. Yunchang won the prefecture and county, and Anmin was settled, and the teacher returned to Xuchang. Cao Cao went out of Guo to meet him and reward the sergeant.","To his surprise and delight he sees that one of them is Xuande’s adviser Sun Qian. Dismissing his men, Guan Yu asks, ‘What are you doing here?’ to which Sun Qian replies, ‘It’s by pure chance that I’m here. I was given refuge by Liu Pi. But what has happened to you? Why are you on Cao Cao’s side? Where are Xuande’s wives?’ Swiftly Guan Yu brings him up to date, reassuring him that the ladies are all right. ‘Xuande is with Yuan Shao, I’ve been told,’ says Sun Qian. ‘It’s my intention to join him, but that hasn’t been possible until now. The two leaders of the Yellow Headbands, Liu Pi and Gong Du, actually want to join Yuan Shao to fight against Cao Cao. I’ve come to tell you that tomorrow they’ll pretend to be defeated and will turn away, drawing you after them. You can then capture the city, and then from that base you can come over to our side with the ladies to join Yuan Shao and Xuande.’ So the plot is set in motion. Pretending to be defeated, the Yellow Headband leaders and their men flee, and Guan Yu captures Runan. In triumph, Guan Yu returns to Cao Cao in the capital.","In due time the force led by Guan Yu drew near the rebels in Runan and made their camp. One night, just outside his camp, two spies were caught and taken in to Guan Yu who in one of them recognized Sun Qian. The attendants being dismissed, Guan Yu questioned Sun Qian. “After we lost sight of each other, I have heard not a word of you; what are you doing here?” said Guan Yu. “After I escaped, I drifted hither and thither till I had the good fortune to reach Runan, and Liu Pi and Gong Du, the Yellow Scarves leaders, took me in. But why are you with Cao Cao, General? And where are your sisters-in-law? Are they well?” Guan Yu told him all that had happened. “I have heard lately that Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao. I would have liked to go and join him, but I have not found a convenient opportunity. Now the two men I am with have taken the side of Yuan Shao against Cao Cao. By good luck you were coming here so I got command of a small party of scouts to be able to see you and tell you. Presently our two leaders will pretend to be defeated and you, and the two ladies, can go over to Yuan Shao. And you will see your brother.” “Since he is there, I certainly must go at once to see him. But it is a misfortune that I have slain two of Yuan Shao's generals. I fear things are not in my favor,” said Guan Yu. “Let me go first and see how the land lies; I will come back and tell you.” “I would risk a myriad deaths to see my brother,” said Guan Yu. “But I must go to say farewell to Cao Cao.” Sun Qian was sent away that night, and next day Guan Yu led out his army to offer battle. Gong Du, in armor, went out to the front of the line of battle, and Guan Yu said, “You people, why have you risen against the government?” “Why do you blame us when you have turned your back on your own lord?” replied Gong Du. “How have I turned my back on my lord?” “Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao, and you are with Cao Cao; what is that?” Guan Yu could not reply, but he whirled round his sword and rode forward. Gong Du fled, and Guan Yu followed. Gong Du turned and said to Guan Yu, “Do not forget your old chief's kindness. Now attack as soon as you can, and I will give up the defense.” Guan Yu understood and urged on his troops. The leaders of the rebels pretended they were worsted, and they all scattered. So Runan was retaken. Having pacified the people, Guan Yu quickly led his army back to the capital, where he was met by Cao Cao and congratulated on his success and feasted."

幹下船，飛棹回見曹操。操問：“子翼幹事若何？”幹曰：“周瑜雅量高致，非言訶所能動也。”操怒曰：“事又不濟，反為所笑！”幹曰：“雖不能說周瑜，却與丞相打聽得一件事。乞退左右。”幹取出書信，將上項事逐一說與曹操。操大怒曰：“二賊如此無禮耶！”卽便喚蔡瑁、張允到帳下。操曰：“我欲使汝二人進兵。”瑁曰：“軍尚未曾練熟，不可輕進。”操怒曰：“軍若練熟，吾首級獻於周郎矣！”蔡、張二人不知其意，驚慌不能回答。操喝武士推出斬之。須臾，獻頭帳下，操方省悟曰：“吾中計矣！”後人有詩歎曰：,"Dry disembarked, and Feizo returned to see Cao Cao. Cao asked, ""What is Ziyi doing?"" Qian said, ""Zhou Yu is elegant and high-minded, and he can't do anything with words."" Cao said angrily, ""It's not good, but I'm laughing at it!"" Qian said, ""Although I can't say Zhou Yu , but inquired about one thing with the Prime Minister. Beg to retreat."" Gan took out the letter and told Cao Cao about the above matter one by one. Cao was furious and said, ""The two thieves are so rude!"" You called Cai Mao and Zhang Yun to the tent. Cao said: ""I want to send the two of you into the army."" Mao said, ""The army has not been trained yet, so don't advance lightly."" Cao said angrily: ""If the army is skilled, I will dedicate my head to Zhou Lang!"" Cai, Zhang and the two didn't know what it meant, so they couldn't answer in panic. Fuck the samurai and launch Zanzhi. After a few moments, he offered his head under the tent, and he said, ""I have a plan!"" Later generations sighed in a poem:","Arriving back at Cao Cao’s camp, he goes directly to Cao Cao, where he has to confess that Zhou Yu will not change sides. Cao Cao explodes with fury, but Jiang Gan says that he has discovered something of greater importance but that he can only confide this to Cao Cao alone. So the room is cleared. Then and only then does Jiang Gan show Cao Cao the supposed letter of betrayal by Cai Mao and Zhang Yun.","He found his way to the river bank and reembarked. Then, with flying oars, he hastened back to Cao Cao's camp. When he arrived, Cao Cao asked at once how he had sped, and he had to acknowledge failure. “Zhou Yu is very clever and perfectly high-minded,” said Jiang Gan. “Nothing that I could say moved him in the least.” “Your failure makes me look ridiculous,” said Cao Cao. “Well, if I did not win over Zhou Yu, I found out something for you. Send away these people and I will tell you,” said Jiang Gan. The servants were dismissed, and then Jiang Gan produced the letter he had stolen from Zhou Yu's tent. He gave it to Cao Cao. Cao Cao was very angry and sent for Cai Mao and Zhang Yun at once. As soon as they appeared, he said, “I want you two to attack.” Cai Mao replied, “But the soldiers are not yet sufficiently trained.” “The soldiers will be well enough trained when you have sent my head to Zhou Yu, eh?” Both commanders were dumb-founded, having not the least idea what this meant. They remained silent for they had nothing to say. Cao Cao bade the executioners lead them away to instant death. In a short time their heads were produced. By this time Cao Cao had thought over the matter, and it dawned upon him that he had been tricked. A poem says:"
心懷國家恨，眉鎖廟堂憂。,"With hatred of the country in his heart, his eyebrows are locked in temples.","Hearing this, the leaders murder Wang Yun there",Leal to the state always:
此時孔明按察四郡未回。門吏傳報江南名士龐統，特來相投。玄德久聞統名，便敎請入相見。統見玄德，長揖不拜。玄德見統貌陋，心中亦不悅，乃問統曰：“足下遠來不易？”統不卽取出魯肅書并孔明投呈，但答曰：“聞皇叔招賢納士，特來相投。”玄德曰：“荊、楚稍定，苦無閒職。此去東北一百三十里，有一縣名耒陽縣，缺一縣宰，屈公任之。如後有缺，却當重用。”統思玄德待我何薄，欲以才學動之；見孔明不在，只得勉強相辭而去，統到耒陽縣，不理政事，終日飲酒為樂；一應錢糧詞訟，並不理會。有人報知玄德，言龐統將耒陽縣事盡廢。玄德怒曰：“豎儒焉敢亂吾法度！”遂喚張飛分付：“引從人去荊南諸縣巡視。如有不公不法者，就便究問。恐於事有不明處，可與孫乾同去。”,"At this time, Kong Ming did not return to the four counties. The gatekeeper reported that Pang Tong, a famous man in the south of the Yangtze River, came to join him. Xuande had heard the general name for a long time, so he invited him to meet him. Seeing Xuande all together, long bow without bowing. Seeing Tong's ugly appearance, Xuande was also displeased in his heart, so he asked Tong, ""It's not easy to come by with a single step?"" Tong did not take out the book of Lu Su and submitted it to Kong Ming, but replied: ""I heard that Uncle Huang is recruiting talents, and I came here specially. Let’s get along.” Xuande said: “Jing and Chu have been settled for a while, and there are no idle jobs. Going 130 miles to the northeast, there is a county called Leiyang County, and there is a lack of county slaughter, and Qu Gong will be appointed. If there is a shortage later, But it should be used again."" Tong Si Xuande treated me poorly, and wanted to learn how to move it; seeing that Kongming was not there, he had to reluctantly resigned and left, and Tong went to Leiyang County, ignoring political affairs, drinking for pleasure all day long; , ignore it. Someone reported to Xuande, saying that Pangtong would destroy everything in Leiyang County. Xuande said angrily, ""How dare you dare to mess with my law!"" He then called Zhang Fei to pay: ""Let me lead people to inspect the various counties in Jingnan. If there is any injustice or lawlessness, I will investigate. I am afraid that there is something unclear. Go with Sun Qian.""","But Kong Ming is away and not able to make the introductions. Xuande also finds Pang Tong’s appearance and manner off-putting. As a result he only offers him a very minor post as magistrate in a country town called Leiyang, miles away from the city. Deeply annoyed by this, Pang Tong almost rejects it out of hand but he realizes that, without Kong Ming being there to speak for him, this is all he can expect at the moment, so he takes the post. It is not long before stories begin to circulate about the fact that he does no work whatsoever and is essentially drunk most of the time! Furious at this further indication of this man’s offhand manner, Xuande sends Zhang Fei to investigate, along with Sun Qian, to ensure Zhang Fei doesn’t go off the deep end.","Pang Tong took the letter offered by Lu Su and soon made his way to Jingzhou City. He arrived at a moment that Zhuge Liang was absent on an inspection journey, but the doorkeeper announced him and said he had come to throw in his lot with Liu Bei. He was received, for he was no stranger in name. When Pang Tong was admitted, he made the ordinary salutation but did not make an obeisance and this, coupled with his ugly face, did not please his host. “You have come a long and arduous journey,” said Liu Bei. At this point the suitor should have produced his letters from Zhuge Liang and Lu Su, but did not. Instead he replied, “I hear, O Imperial Uncle, that you are welcoming the wise and receiving scholars, wherefore I have come to join your service.” “The country is decently peaceful now, and unfortunately there is no office vacant. But away to the northeast there is a small magistracy, Leiyang, which needs a chief. I can offer you that post until there should be something more fitting.” Pang Tong thought this rather poor welcome for a person of his talent. But his friend was absent, so he could do nothing but control his annoyance and accept. He took his leave and started. But when he arrived at his post, he paid no attention to business at all; he gave himself up entirely to dissipation. The taxes were not collected nor were lawsuits decided. News of this reaching Liu Bei, who was angry and said, “Here is this stiff-necked pedant throwing my administration into disorder.” So Liu Bei sent Zhang Fei to the county with orders to make a general inspection of the whole county and look into any irregularities and disorders. But as Liu Bei thought there might be some tact needed, Sun Qian was also sent as coadjutor."
却說曹操平白折了十五六萬箭，心中氣悶。荀攸進計曰：“江東有周瑜、諸葛亮二人用計，急切難破；可差人去東吳詐降，為奸細內應，以通消息，方可圖也。”操曰：“此言正合吾意。汝料軍中誰可行此計？”攸曰：“蔡瑁被誅，蔡氏宗族，皆在軍中。瑁之族弟蔡中、蔡和現為副將。丞相可以恩結之，差往詐降東吳，必不見疑。”操從之，當夜密喚二人入帳囑付曰：“汝二人可用些少軍士，去東吳詐降。但有動靜，使人密報。事成之後，重加封賞。休懷二心！”二人曰：“吾等妻子俱在荊州，安敢懷二心，丞相勿疑。某二人必取周瑜、諸葛亮之首，獻於麾下。”操厚賞之。次日，二人帶五百軍士，駕船數隻，順風望着南岸來。,"But he said that Cao Cao broke 150,000 to 60,000 arrows in vain, and his heart was sullen. Xun You entered into the plan and said: ""Jiangdong has Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang who are using a plan, which is urgent and difficult to break. You can send people to Dongwu to deceive capitulation and respond to the spies in order to communicate information. Only then can you plan your plans."" Do you think who in the army can do this?"" You said: ""Cai Mao was executed, and the Cai clan is all in the army. Cai Zhong and Cai He, the younger brothers of Mao's clan, are now deputy generals. If you cheated to surrender to Eastern Wu, there will be no doubts."" He obeyed, and that night secretly summoned the two of them to enter the account and told Fu, ""You two can use some young soldiers to go to Eastern Wu to deceive. Plus a reward. Don't have two hearts!"" The two said: ""Our wives are all in Jingzhou, and I dare to have two hearts. The prime minister does not doubt it. The two will take the heads of Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang and offer them to their subordinates."" Of. The next day, the two of them led five hundred sergeants and sailed several boats, looking downwind to the south bank.","Back on the northern side, Cao Cao is fuming about his setbacks and longing to retaliate. He and Xun You decide to infiltrate spies into the south’s camp. They agree to send men who claim to be deserting and choose Cai Zhong and Cai He, members of the Cai clan. As they are related to the recently executed Cai Mao, this will make it more plausible that they might desert and go to join Zhou Yu. So the two agree to go and shortly afterwards they approach the south shore and ‘defect’. Zhou Yu, however, is not fooled.","He deeply desired revenge. Then Xun You proposed a ruse, saying, “The two strategists on the side of the enemy are Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang, two men most difficult to get the better of. Let us send some one who shall pretend to surrender to them but really be a spy on our behalf and a helper in our schemes. When we know what is doing, we can plan to meet it.” “I had thought of that myself,” replied Cao Cao. “Whom do you think the best person to send?” “Cai Mao has been put to death, but all his clan and family are in the army, and his two younger brothers are junior generals. You have them most securely in your power and may send them to surrender. The ruler of the South Land will never suspect deceit there.” Cao Cao decided to act on this plan, and in the evening summoned Cai Zhong and Cai He to his tent, where he told them, saying, “I want you two pretend to surrender to the South Land so that you can gather intelligence and sent it back. When all done, you will be richly rewarded. But do not betray me.” “Our families are in Jingzhou, and that place is yours,” replied they. “Should we dare betray? You need have no doubts, Sir. You will soon see the heads of both Zhou Yu and Zhuge Liang at your feet.” Cao Cao gave them generous gifts; and soon after the two men, each with his five hundred soldiers, set sail with a fair wind for the opposite bank."

行至滑州界首，有人報與劉延。延引數十騎，出郭而迎。關公馬上欠身而言曰：“太守別來無恙！”延曰：“公今欲何往？”公曰：“辭了丞相，去尋家兄。”延曰：“玄德在袁紹處：紹乃丞相讎人，如何容公去？”公曰：“昔日曾言定來。”延曰：“今黃河渡口關隘，夏侯惇部將秦琪據守。恐不容將軍過渡。”公曰：“太守應付船隻，若何？”延曰：“船隻雖有，不敢應付。”公曰：“我前者誅顏良、文醜，亦曾與足下解厄。今日求一渡船而不與，何也？”延曰：“只恐夏侯惇知之，必然罪我。”關公知劉延無用之人，遂自催車仗前進。到黃河渡口，秦琪引軍出問：“來者何人？”關公曰：“漢壽亭侯關某也。”琪曰：“今欲何往？”關公曰：“欲投河北去尋兄長劉玄德，敬來借渡。”琪曰：“丞相公文何在？”公曰：“吾不受丞相節制，有甚公文？”琪曰：“吾奉夏侯將軍將令，守把關隘，你便插翅，也飛不過去！”關公大怒曰：“你知我於路斬戮攔截者乎？”琪曰：“你只殺得無名下將，敢殺我麼？”關公怒曰：“汝比顏良、文醜若何？”秦琪大怒，縱馬提刀，直取關公。二馬相交，只一合，關公刀起，秦琪頭落。關公曰：“當吾者已死，餘人不必驚走。速備船隻，送我渡河。”軍士急撐舟傍岸。關公請二嫂上船渡河。渡過黃河，便是袁紹地方。關公所歷關隘五處，斬將六員。後人有詩歎曰：,"Going to Huazhou Jieshou, someone reported to Liu Yan. Yan cited dozens of riders, and went out of Guo to welcome them. Guan Gong immediately bowed his body and said, ""Prefect, please come and be safe!"" Yan said, ""Where do you want to go now?"" Gong said, ""I have resigned from the prime minister and went to look for my brother."" Yan said, ""Xuande is at Yuan Shao's place: Shao Nai The Prime Minister, how can you let the Duke go?"" The Duke said, ""It was promised in the past."" Yan said: ""Now the Yellow River Ferry Pass is guarded by the general Qin Qi of Xiahou Dun. I am afraid that the general will not be allowed to pass."" What if?"" Yan said, ""Even though there are boats, I don't dare to deal with it."" The public said, ""My former punished Yan Liang and Wen Chou, and I also dealt with the foot of the trouble. Today, I asked for a ferry and didn't go with me, why?"" Yan said: ""I'm only afraid that Xiahou Dun will know about it, and he will surely sin against me."" Guan Gong knew that Liu Yan was useless, so he urged the chariots to advance. At the crossing of the Yellow River, Qin Qi led the army out and asked, ""Who is coming?"" Guan Gong said: ""Han Shouting Marquis Guan."" Qi said, ""Where do you want to go now?"" Guan Gong said, ""I want to go to Hebei to find my brother. Liu Xuande, please come and borrow the ferry."" Qi said, ""Where is the Prime Minister's official document?"" Gong said, ""I am not subject to the Prime Minister's restraint, what kind of official document do I have?"" Qi said, ""I am under the command of General Xiahou to guard the gate, and you will put your wings on it. I can't fly past!"" Guan Gong was furious and said, ""Do you know that I kill and kill interceptors on the road?"" Qi said, ""You can only kill an unnamed general, so dare you to kill me?"" Guan Gong said angrily, ""You are more than a fighter. What about Yan Liang and Wen Chou?"" Qin Qi was furious, raised his sword and took Guan Gong directly. The two horses crossed, and they only joined together. Guan Gong's sword rose and Qin Qi's head fell. Guan Gong said: ""When I am dead, the rest of the people don't have to be frightened away. Prepare a boat and send me across the river."" The sergeant rushed to the shore. Guan Gong asked his second sister-in-law to get on the boat and cross the river. After crossing the Yellow River, it is Yuan Shao's place. Guan Gong passed through five passes and beheaded six members. A later poem sighed and said:","Here he meets an old friend, Liu Yan, who warns him that the river crossing is guarded by Qin Qi, a deputy governor under the Governor Xiahou Dun. ‘I fear it is very unlikely that he will let you cross,’ says Liu Yan. ‘Lend me a boat so I can escape the border crossing,’ says Guan Yu, but Liu Yan is too afraid of the power of Qin Qi and refuses. Frustrated, and knowing he can gain nothing more from such a weak man, Guan Yu presses on. At the river crossing, once again Guan Yu is asked to provide the papers that show he has the prime minister’s permission to leave. ‘I don’t need such papers,’ says Guan Yu. ‘Without papers, not even wings will enable you to cross over!’ states Qin Qi defiantly. ‘I’ve already killed others who have tried to stop me,’ says Guan Yu. ‘Try and kill me then,’ shouts Qin Qi impetuously. So saying, he attacks Guan Yu, but with one swift stroke Guan Yu strikes off Qin Qi’s head. Guan Yu then tells the soldiers guarding the crossing that he has nothing against them so would they now please ferry the convoy across the river. The men hasten to obey. At last as they landed on the far shore, they are in the land of Yuan Shao. Guan Yu has forced his way through five places and killed six officials.","When they drew near Huazhou, some one told Liu Yan, who rode out to welcome him. Liu Yan had been once rescued by Guan Yu, who slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and lifted the siege of the city. Guan Yu did not dismount but bowed from horseback, saying, “Have you been quite well since we parted?” “Whither are you going, Sir?” replied Liu Yan. “I have left the Prime Minister and am on my way to find my brother.” “Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao, who is at enmity with the Prime Minister. How can you be allowed to go to him?” asked Liu Yan. “That matter was settled long ago.” “The Yellow River Ferry is an important point and is guarded by a commander of Xiahou Dun; he will not let you cross.” “But suppose then you provide boats for me?” “Though there are boats, I dare not give them to you.” “Well, formerly I slew Yan Liang and Wen Chou and saved you a grave danger. Now you refuse me a ferry boat!” “I am afraid Xiahou Dun will know of it and make it a fault against me.” Guan Yu perceived that no help was to be expected from this man, so he pushed on and presently reached the ferry. There the Commander of the Guard, Qin Qi, came out to question him. “I am one Guan Yu, Lord of Hanshou.” “Whither are you bound?” “I go to the North of Yellow River to seek my brother, Liu Bei, and I respectfully ask you to grant me a passage over the river.” “Where is the authority of the Prime Minister?” “I am not on a mission from the Prime Minister, so why should I have such an authority?” “I have orders from my chief to guard the ferry, and you will not cross; even if you grew wings, you should not fly over.” Guan Yu's choler arose. “Do you know that I have been the death of all those who have hitherto tried to stop me?” said he. “You have only slain a few officers of no rank or reputation; but you dare not kill me!” “Where would you stand beside Yan Liang and Wen Chou?” asked Guan Yu. Qin Qi grew angry, and he loosed his rein. Sword in hand, he came at a gallop. The two met, but in the first encounter Qin Qi's head was swept off by the terrible green-dragon saber. “He who opposed me is dead; you others need not be afraid,” cried Guan Yu. “Be quick and prepare me a boat.” The boat was soon at the landing, and the two women stepped on board, followed by Guan Yu. They crossed and were then in the country of Yuan Shao. In the course of his journey to this point, Guan Yu had forced five passes and slain six generals. His seal hung up, the treasury locked, his"
備與足下，自桃園締盟，誓以同死；今何中道相違，割恩斷義？君必欲取功名、圖富貴，願獻備首級以成全功！書不盡言，死待來命！,"Prepared with one step, formed an alliance from Taoyuan, and swore to die together; what is the middle way now, to cut grace and cut righteousness? You must want to gain fame and wealth, and you are willing to offer your head to achieve full success! The book is endless, and death awaits!","Guan Yu then composes a letter to Xuande, explaining that in order to protect his two sisters-in-law he has had no option but to take up service under Cao Cao.","“I, the writer, and you, Sir, pledged ourselves in the Peach Garden to die together. Why then are we apart and yet alive, our kindly feelings destroyed, our sense of right outraged? If you desire to obtain fame and acquire riches and honor, I will offer my head without hesitation so that your achievement is fulfilled. More might be said, but I await your commands with great anxiety.”"
魯肅設宴款待孔明。宴罷，孔明辭回，方欲下船，只見江邊一人道袍竹冠，皂縧素履，一手揪住孔明大笑曰：“汝氣死周郎，却又來弔孝，明欺東吳無人耶？”孔明急視其人，乃鳳雛先生龐統也。孔明亦大笑。兩人攜手登舟，各訴心事。孔明乃留書一封與統，囑曰：“吾料孫仲謀必不能重用足下。稍有不如意，可來荊州共扶玄德。此人寬仁厚德，必不負公平生之所學。”統允諾而別。孔明自回荊州。,"Lu Su hosted a banquet for Kong Ming. After the banquet, Kong Ming resigned, and when he was about to disembark the boat, he saw a man beside the river in a Taoist robe and a bamboo crown, with soap sash and plain shoes. ""Kong Ming looked at him anxiously, it was Mr. Feng Chu, Pang Tong. Kong Ming also laughed. The two boarded the boat hand in hand, each telling their hearts. Kong Mingnai left a letter with Tong, saying: ""I expect Sun Zhongmou will not be able to reuse his steps. If there is a little unsatisfactory, you can come to Jingzhou to help Xuande together. This person is kind and virtuous, and he will live up to what he has learned in a fair life."" Promise and leave. Kong Ming returned to Jingzhou.","And even Lu Su has to note that Kong Ming seems a bigger person than Zhou Yu ever was. But as Kong Ming is preparing to board his ship to travel home, someone comes up dressed in the dishevelled clothes of a Daoist and says bluntly, ‘You literally drove Zhou Yu to his death! And now you’ve the cheek to come here and pretend you’re a mourner. This is nothing less than an insult to Wu. As if you were telling them there is no one with any talent left here at all!’ Initially he is somewhat shocked, but his anxiety soon turns to delight when he sees it is none other than his old friend Pang Tong – Young Phoenix. They talk together for a while, and then Kong Ming gives him a letter he has written and says that if he finds his skills unappreciated here, he is to come to Xuande and offer his services. Now after Zhou Yu has been buried, Lu Su comes to see Sun Quan and says that he is not worthy of the new appointment but he knows of one who is.","Lu Su gave a banquet for Zhuge Liang after which the guest left. Just as Zhuge Liang was embarking, his arm was clutched by a person in Taoist dress who said with a smile, “ You exasperated literally to death the man whose body lies up there; to come here as a mourner is an open insult to the South Land. It is as good as to say they have no other left.” At first Zhuge Liang did not recognize the speaker, but very soon he saw it was no other than Pang Tong, or the Blooming-Phoenix. Then Zhuge Liang laughed in his turn, and they two hand in hand went down into the ship, where they talked heart to heart for a long time. Before leaving, Zhuge Liang gave his friend a letter and said, “I do not think that Sun Quan will use you as you merit. If you find life here distasteful, then you may come to Jingzhou and help to support my master. He is liberal and virtuous and will not disdain what you have spent your life in learning.” Then they parted, and Zhuge Liang went alone to Jingzhou."
却說糜竺回報陶謙，言北海又請得劉玄德來助；陳元龍也回報靑州田楷欣然領兵來救；陶謙心安。原來孔融、田楷兩路軍馬，懼怕曹兵勢猛，遠遠依山下寨，未敢輕進。曹操見兩路軍到，亦分了軍勢，不敢向前攻城。,"But he said that Mi Zhu repaid Tao Qian, and that Beihai invited Liu Xuande to help; Chen Yuanlong also reported that Tian Kai led his troops to the rescue; Tao Qian felt at ease. It turned out that Kong Rong and Tian Kai's troops were afraid of Cao's force, and they were far away from the mountain and did not dare to advance lightly. When Cao Cao saw the arrival of the two-route army, he also divided his army and did not dare to attack the city.","Once inside the city, Xuande is asked by Kong Rong to join him in coming to the assistance of Tao Qian and oppose Cao Cao","In due course Mi Zhu returned saying that Kong Rong had also obtained the services of Liu Bei. The other messenger, Chen Deng, came back and reported that Tien Kai would also bring help. Then was Tao Qian's heart set at ease. But both the leaders, though they had promised aid, greatly dreaded their antagonist and camped among the hills at a great distance, fearful of coming to close quarters. Cao Cao knew of their coming and divided his army into parts to meet them, so postponing the attack on the city itself."

却說夏侯惇引軍前進，正與高順軍相遇，便挺鎗出馬搦戰。高順迎敵。兩馬相交，戰有四五十合，高順抵敵不住，敗下陣來。惇縱馬追趕，順遶陣而走。惇不捨，亦遶陣追之。陣上曹性看見，暗地拈弓搭箭，覷得親切，一箭射去，正中夏侯惇左目，惇大叫一聲，急用手拔箭，不想連眼珠拔出；乃大呼曰：“父精母血，不可棄也！”遂納於口內啖之，仍復挺鎗縱馬，直取曹性。性不及隄防，早被一鎗搠透面門，死於馬下。兩邊軍士見者，無不駭然。夏侯惇旣殺曹性，縱馬便回。高順從背後趕來，麾軍齊上，曹兵大敗。夏侯淵救護其兄而走。呂虔、李典將敗軍退去濟北下寨。高順得勝，引軍回擊玄德。恰好呂布大軍亦至，布與張遼、高順分兵三路，來攻玄德、關、張三寨。正是：,"However, he said that Xiahou Dun led the army forward, and was meeting with Gao Shun's army, so he put out his spear and went out to fight. Gao Shun meets the enemy. The two horses crossed each other, and the battle was forty or fifty. Dun Zongma chased after him and walked along the circle. Reluctant to give up, he also chased after him. When Cao Xing saw it in the battle, he was secretly picking up a bow and an arrow. He looked at him cordially and shot an arrow. It hit Xiahou Dun's left eye, and Dun gave a loud cry. The blood of the mother's essence cannot be discarded!"" Then he took it in his mouth and sipped it, he still raised his spear and rode his horse, taking Cao Xing directly. Sexually inferior to the dike, he was shot through the door and died under the horse. The soldiers on both sides were amazed when they saw it. Xiahou Dunyan killed Cao Xing, and returned with a horse. Gao Shun came from behind, and the army came forward, and Cao's army was defeated. Xiahou Yuan rescued his brother and left. Lu Qian and Li Dian retreated the defeated army to Jibei Xiazhai. Gao Shun was victorious and led the army to attack Xuande. It happened that Lü Bu's army also arrived, and Bu, Zhang Liao and Gao Shun divided their troops to attack Xuande, Guan, and Zhang Sanzhai. Exactly:","But his army is decisively beaten by Lü Bu’s commander Gao Shun, who comes back from defeating Cao Cao to reinforce the attack on Xuande.","Now the division of Cao Cao's army under Xiahou Dun, having marched out in advance, first came into touch with Gao Shun. Xiahou Dun at once rode out with spear set and offered a challenge. It was accepted and the two leaders fought half a hundred bouts. Then Gao Shun began to weaken and had to turn back. He rode round to the rear of his array. Xiahou Dun was not the man to quail, so he followed right into the enemy's country. Then Cao Xing, one of Lu Bu's generals, secretly strung his bow, fitted an arrow and, when Xiahou Dun had come quite near, shot at him. The arrow hit Xiahou Dun full in the left eye. He shrieked, and putting up his head, pulled out the arrow and with it the eye. “Essence of my father, blood of my mother, I cannot throw this away!” cried Xiahou Dun, and he put the eye into his mouth and swallowed it. Then resuming his firm grip of his spear, Xiahou Dun went after this new enemy. There was no escape for Cao Xing. He was overtaken and fell with a fatal spear wound full in the face. Both sides were stricken dumb with amazement. Having thus slain the man who had wounded him, Xiahou Dun rode back toward his own side. Gao Shun went in pursuit and, waving on his army, attacked so vigorously that he won the day. Xiahou Yuan defended for his elder brother as they fled. Lu Qian and Li Dian led various divisions back to Jibei and made a camp. Gao Shun, having scored this victory, returned to attack Liu Bei; and as Lu Bu opportunely arrived with Zhang Liao, these three arranged their forces so that each attacked one of the brothers. Dauntless was Xiahou Dun, that warrior bold,"

王允聽知西涼兵來，與呂布商議。布曰：“司徒放心。量此鼠輩，何足數也！”遂引李肅將兵出敵。肅當先迎戰，正與牛輔相遇，大殺一陣。牛輔抵敵不過，敗陣而去。不想是夜二更，牛輔乘肅不備，竟來劫寨。肅軍亂竄，敗走三十餘里，折軍大半，來見呂布。布大怒曰：“汝何挫吾銳氣！”遂斬李肅，懸頭軍門。次日，呂布進兵與牛輔對敵。量牛輔如何敵得呂布，仍復大敗而走。是夜牛輔喚心腹人胡赤兒商議曰：“呂布驍勇，萬不能敵；不如瞞了李傕等四人，暗藏金珠，與親隨三五人棄軍而去。”胡赤兒應允。是夜收拾金珠，棄營而走，隨行者三四人。將渡一河，赤兒欲謀取金珠，竟殺死牛輔，將頭來獻呂布。布問起情由，從人出首：“胡赤兒謀殺牛輔，奪其金寶。”布怒，卽將赤兒誅殺。領軍前進，正迎着李傕軍馬。呂布不等他列陣，便挺戟躍馬，麾軍直衝過來。傕軍不能抵當，退走五十餘里，依山下寨，請郭汜、張濟、樊稠共議，曰：“呂布雖勇，然而無謀，不足為慮。我引軍守住谷口，每日誘他廝殺。郭將軍可領軍抄擊其後，效彭越撓楚之法，鳴金進兵，擂鼓收兵。張、樊二公，却分兵兩路，逕取長安。彼首尾不能救應，必然大敗。”衆用其計。,"Wang Yun heard that the troops from the Western Liang Dynasty were coming, and discussed with Lu Bu. Bu said, ""Don't worry, Situ. If you measure the number of these rats, how many are there!"" He then led Li Su's troops to attack the enemy. Su Dang was the first to fight, and he was meeting Niu Fu, killing him for a while. Niu Fu was unable to resist the enemy, and was defeated. Don't want to be the second watch of the night, Niu Fucheng was unprepared and came to rob the village. The Su army scurried, lost more than thirty li, and lost most of the army to meet Lu Bu. Bu was furious and said, ""How dare you frustrate my spirit!"" Then he cut Li Su and hung his head in the military gate. The next day, Lü Bu sent troops to fight Niu Fu. Counting how Niu Fu was able to defeat Lu Bu, he was still defeated and left. It was Ye Niu who assisted his confidant Hu Chi'er to discuss it and said, ""Lü Bu is brave and can never be defeated. It is better to hide the gold beads from Li Jue and the other four, and leave the army with three or five people in person."" Hu Chi'er agreed. It was Ye who packed up the gold beads, abandoned the camp and left, accompanied by three or four people. When he was about to cross a river, Chi'er wanted to get the gold beads, but he killed Niu Fu and offered his head to Lu Bu. When Bu asked the reason for his love, he took the lead: ""Hu Chi'er murdered Niu Fu and took his golden treasure."" Bu was angry and executed Chi'er to death. Leading the army forward, they are facing Li Jue's army. Lu Bu did not wait for him to form the formation, then he jumped on his halberd, and the army rushed forward. The Jue army was unable to reach it, so they retreated for more than fifty li, and went down to the mountain. They invited Guo Si, Zhang Ji, and Fan Chou to discuss together, saying: ""Although Lü Bu is brave, he has no plans and is nothing to worry about. Fighting. count.","Former generals under Dong Zhuo, fearing for their lives, seek forgiveness from Wang Yun. But he rejects their pleas and in so doing he turns them into enemies. The generals, led by Li Jue and Guo Si, advance towards the capital, and Lü Bu rides out with Li Su to confront them. Li Su is sent ahead to hold the rebels back, but he fails abysmally. Furious at this failure, Lü Bu has Li Su executed and his head impaled above the entrance to the camp. But this does nothing to improve the situation.","As they advanced, the news came to Wang Yun, and he consulted Lu Bu. “They are a lot of rats,” said Lu Bu. “Never mind how many there are of them. Be not in the least anxious.” So Lu Bu and Li Su went to oppose them. The latter was in advance and met Niu Fu. They fought; Niu Fu was outmatched and retired after suffering a slaughter. But unexpectedly Niu Fu returned in a night attack, found Li Su quite unprepared and drove Li Su's force some ten miles, slaying many. Li Su reported the defeat, and Lu Bu raged at him, saying, “You have sullied my reputation as a warrior and destroyed our fighting spirit.” And Lu Bu put Li Su to death, exposing his head at the camp gate. Next day Lu Bu advanced his own force and engaged Niu Fu. He overwhelmed Niu Fu and drove him off. That night Niu Fu called in his most trusted man, Hu Chier, to advise him. Hu Chier said, “Lu Bu is too doughty a fighter for us to hope to overcome him. Our case is hopeless. Our best course is to desert these four generals, secrete their valuables, and leave the army with just a few of our followers.” The plan of Hu Chier was adopted, and the two traitors and some others that very night packed up and made their way out of camp. They were only half a dozen. They came to a river and, while crossing, Hu Chier, tempted by the lust of wealth, slew his companion. Then he went to offer the head of Niu Fu to Lu Bu. Lu Bu inquired into the matter, and when a follower told him the truth, he put the double traitor Hu Chier to death. Then Lu Bu advanced against the rebels and fell in with Li Jue's force. Without giving them time to form in battle, Lu Bu attacked. Horses curvetting and spears set, the army dashed in irresistibly, and Li Jue, making no stand, fell back a long way. Li Jue took up a position under a hill fifteen miles away and thence sent to call his fellows to council. Li Jue said, “Lu Bu though brave in battle is no strategist and so not really formidable. I will lead my troops to hold the mouth of the gorge, and every day I will incite him to attack; and when he comes toward me, General Guo Si can smite his rear, after the manner of Peng Yue when he fought against Chu. While thus I am alternating attack and retreat, Generals Fan Chou and Zhang Ji will march off in different directions toward Changan. Such an attack at two points must end both Wang Yun and Lu Bu.” They set themselves to carry out this scheme."

周瑜覽畢，長歎一聲，喚左右取紙筆作書上吳侯。乃聚衆將曰：“吾非不欲盡忠報國，奈天命已絕矣。汝等善事吳侯，共成大業。”言訖，昏絕。徐徐又醒，仰天長歎曰：“旣生瑜，何生亮？”連叫數聲而亡。壽三十六歲。後人有詩歎曰：,"After Zhou Yu finished reading, he let out a long sigh. Then he gathered the generals and said, ""It's not that I don't want to serve the country with all my loyalty, but the destiny of heaven has already ended. You and the marquis of Wu will accomplish great things together."" He slowly woke up again, looked up to the sky and sighed, ""Jian Shengyu, why is he Shengliang?"" He screamed several times and died. Thirty-six years old. A later poem sighed and said:","This all proves too much for Zhou Yu. Knowing he is dying, he writes a final letter to Sun Quan. Then, looking up to Heaven, he says, ‘Having made me, why did you have to make Kong Ming?’ And with that he dies. He is only thirty-six years old. The battle of Red Cliffs made him famous;","The letter made Zhou Yu feel very sorrowful, and he sighed deeply. He called for paper and ink and wrote to the Marquis of Wu and, having done this, he said to his assembled officers, “I have honestly tried to do my best for my country, but my end is at hand. The number of my days is accomplished. You must continue to aid our master till his end shall be achieved——” He stopped; for he had swooned. Slowly he regained consciousness; and as he looked up to heaven, he sighed heavily, “O God, since thou made Zhou Yu, why did thou also create Zhuge Liang?” Soon after he passed away; he was only thirty-six. The battle at the Red Cliffs made him famous; Though young in years he gained a veteran's reputation. Deep feeling, his music declared its intensity;"
却說劉表聞玄德語，口雖不言，心懷不足，別了玄德，退入內宅。蔡夫人曰：“適間我於屏後聽得劉備之言，甚輕覷人，足見其有吞併荊州之意。今若不除，必為後患。”表不答，但搖頭而已。蔡氏乃密召蔡瑁入，商議此事。瑁曰：“請先就館舍殺之，然後告知主公。”蔡氏然其言。瑁出，便連夜點軍。,"However, Liu Biao heard Xuande, but he didn't speak, but he was not enough. Mrs. Cai said: ""I heard Liu Bei's words from behind the screen in a short time, and I looked down on people very much, which shows that he has the intention of annexing Jingzhou. If we don't get rid of it now, it will be a trouble for the future."" She didn't answer, but just shook her head. The Cai family secretly summoned Cai Mao to discuss the matter. Mao said: ""Please kill him in the house first, and then inform the lord."" Cai Shi said that. When he came out, he ordered the army overnight.",She starts to seriously undermine Liu Biao’s confidence in Xuande while at the same time urging her brother Cai Mao to go and kill Xuande.,"Only two he found; and one was Liu Bei. But by inaction He had grown both fat and slothful; Yet the months and years in passing Fretted him with nought accomplished. Though Liu Biao kept silence when he heard the words of Liu Bei, yet he felt the more uneasy. After the departure of his guest, he retired into the inner quarters where he met his wife. Lady Cai said, “I happened to be behind the screen just now and so heard the words of Liu Bei. They betray scant regard for other people and mean that he would take your territory if he could. If you do not remove him, it will go ill with you.” Her husband made no reply, but only shook his head. Then Lady Cai took counsel with her kinsman Cai Mao, who said, “Let me go to the guest-house and slay him forthwith, and we can report what we have done.” His sister consented and he went out, and that night told off a party of soldiers to do the foul deed."
操等謹以大義布告天下：董卓欺天罔地，滅國弒君；穢亂宮禁，殘害生靈；狼戾不仁，罪惡充積！今奉天子密詔，大集義兵，誓欲掃淸華夏，剿戮羣凶。望興義師，共洩公憤；扶持王室，拯救黎民。檄文到日，可速奉行！,"Cao et al. would like to announce to the world with righteousness: Dong Zhuo deceives the sky and the earth, destroys the country and kills the monarch; defiles the palace and bans, and harms living beings; the wolf is cruel and cruel, and the sins are full! Today, in accordance with the secret edict of the Son of Heaven, a large number of righteous soldiers have been assembled, vowing to sweep China and slaughter the gang of murderers. Wang Xingyi division, to vent public anger; support the royal family, save the people. When the decree arrives, you can follow it quickly!","Emboldened, Cao Cao sends out a proclamation urging others to join them in wiping out Dong Zhuo for his crimes of murdering the emperor, usurping the palace and harming the ordinary people. From across the land people respond.","“Cao Cao and his associates, moved by a sense of duty, now make this proclamation. Dong Zhuo defies Heaven and Earth. He is destroying the state and injuring his prince. He pollutes the Palace and oppresses the people. He is vicious and cruel. His crimes are heaped up. Now we have received a secret command to call up soldiers, and we are pledged to cleanse the empire and destroy the evil-doers. We will raise a volunteer army and exert all our efforts to maintain the dynasty and succor the people. Respond to this, O Nobles, by mustering your soldiers.” Many from every side answered the summons as the following list shows: .1."

且說操大軍所到之處，殺戮人民，發掘墳墓。陶謙在徐州，聞曹操起軍報讎，殺戮百姓，仰天慟哭曰：“我獲罪於天，致使徐州之民，受此大難！”急聚衆官商議。曹豹曰：“曹兵旣至，豈可束手待死！某願助使君破之。”陶謙只得引兵出迎，遠望操軍如鋪霜湧雪，中軍豎起白旗二面，大書“報讎雪恨”四字。軍馬列成陣勢。曹操縱馬出陣，身穿縞素，揚鞭大罵。陶謙亦出馬於門旗下，欠身施禮曰：“謙本欲結好明公，故託張闓護送。不想賊心不改，致有此事。實不干陶謙之故：望明公察之。”操大罵曰：“老匹夫！殺吾父，尚敢亂言！誰可生擒老賊？”夏侯惇應聲而出。陶謙慌走入陣。夏侯惇趕來，曹豹挺鎗躍馬，前來迎敵。兩馬相交，忽然狂風大作，飛沙走石，兩軍皆亂，各自收兵。,"Let’s talk about wherever the army goes, killing people and excavating graves. Tao Qian was in Xuzhou, when he heard that Cao Cao raised the army to report and kill the people, he looked up to the sky and wept, ""I have been punished by the sky, causing the people of Xuzhou to suffer greatly!"" Cao Bao said: ""Cao's army is coming, how can you wait to die! I would like to help the emperor to break it."" The four words ""reporting the hatred of the snow"". Troops lined up. Cao steered his horse into battle, dressed in sauerkraut, and lashed out at him. Tao Qian also went out under the banner of the gate, bowed his body and saluted, saying: ""Qian wanted to marry Duke Ming, so he asked Zhang Kai to escort him. Cao yelled: ""Old man! Killing my father, how dare you talk nonsense! Who can capture the old thief alive?"" Xiahou Dun responded. Tao Qian rushed into the battle in a panic. When Xiahou Dun came, Cao Bao came to meet the enemy with a spear and a horse. When the two horses crossed, there was a sudden gust of wind, flying sand and rocks, and the two armies were in chaos, and their respective troops were withdrawn.","Tao Qian rides out at the head of his army to meet Cao Cao’s vast horde. He tries desperately to reason with Cao Cao, pointing out that they were both betrayed by Zhang Kai, but Cao Cao is deaf to his pleas. Returning to the city, Tao Qian speaks with his advisers and declares that, as it is his fault this invasion has occurred, he will offer himself up to Cao Cao to try to stop any more violence.","Cao Cao's army of revenge laid waste whatever place it passed through, slaying the people and desecrating their cemeteries. When Tao Qian heard the terrible tidings, he looked up to heaven, saying, “I must be guilty of some fault before Heaven to have brought this evil upon my people.” He called together his officials to consult. One of them, Cao Bao, said, “Now the enemy is upon us; we cannot sit and await death with folded hands. I for one will help you to make a fight.” Tao Qian reluctantly sent the army out. From a distance he saw Cao Cao's army spread abroad like frost and rushed far and wide like snow. In their midst was a large white flag and on both sides was written “Vengeance” . When he had ranged his troops, Cao Cao rode out dressed in mourning white and abused Tao Qian. But Tao Qian advanced, and from beneath his ensign he bowed low and said, “I wished to make friends with you, Illustrious Sir, and so I sent Zhang Kai to escort your family. I knew not that his rebel heart was still unchanged. The fault does not lie at my door as you must see.” “You old wretch, you killed my father and now you dare to mumble this nonsense,” said Cao Cao. And he asked who would go out and seize Tao Qian. Xiahou Dun undertook this service and rode out. Tao Qian fled to the inner portion of his array; and as Xiahou Dun came on, Cao Bao went to meet him. But just as the two horses met, a hurricane burst over the spot, and the flying dust and pebbles threw both sides into the utmost confusion. Both drew off."

却說孔明在荊州，夜觀天文，見將星墜地，乃笑曰：“周瑜死矣。”至曉，告於玄德。玄德使人探之，果然死了。玄德問孔明曰：“周瑜旣死，還當如何？”孔明曰：“代瑜領兵者，必魯肅也。亮觀天象，將星聚於東方。亮當以弔喪為由，往江東走一遭，就尋賢士佐助主公。”玄德曰：“只恐吳中將士加害於先生。”孔明曰：“瑜在之日，亮猶不懼；今瑜已死，又何患乎？”乃與趙雲引五百軍，具祭禮，下船赴巴丘弔喪。於路探聽得孫權已令魯肅為都督，周瑜靈柩已回柴桑。孔明逕至柴桑，魯肅以禮迎接。周瑜部將皆欲殺孔明，因見趙雲帶劍相隨，不敢下手。孔明敎設祭物於靈前，親自奠酒，跪於地下，讀祭文曰：,"But he said that Kongming was in Jingzhou, watching the astronomy at night, and seeing a star falling to the ground, he laughed and said, ""Zhou Yu is dead."" At dawn, he told Xuande. Xuande sent people to investigate him, and he really died. Xuande asked Kong Ming, ""What should I do if Zhou Yu died?"" Kong Ming said, ""The one who leads the army on behalf of Yu must be Lu Su. Brightly observe the celestial phenomena and gather the stars in the east. Liang should go to Jiangdong on the grounds of mourning. As soon as you go, look for a wise man to help the lord."" Xuande said, ""I'm only afraid that the generals of Wu will harm you."" Kong Ming said, ""When Yu was here, Liang was still not afraid; now Yu is dead, so what's the problem? ""He led five hundred troops with Zhao Yun, gave sacrifices, and disembarked to Baqiu for mourning. Yu Lu found out that Sun Quan had made Lu Su the governor, and Zhou Yu's coffin had returned to Chaisang. Kongming went to Chaisang, and Lu Su greeted him with courtesy. Zhou Yu's generals wanted to kill Kong Ming, but they did not dare to attack because they saw Zhao Yun with a sword. Kong Ming ordered a sacrifice in front of the spirit, liberated himself, knelt down on the ground, and read the sacrificial text:","Zhou Yu’s final letter urges him to offer the post of supreme commander to Lu Su, for ‘Lu Su is a man of utmost loyalty, thorough in his planning and worthy to take my place,’ wrote Zhou Yu.","The night of Zhou Yu's death, Zhuge Liang was gazing up at the heavens when he saw a star of a general fall to the earth. “Zhou Yu is dead,” said he with a smile. At dawn he sent to tell Liu Bei, who sent people to find out, and they came back to say it was true Zhou Yu had died. “Now that this has come to pass, what should we do?” said Liu Bei. “Lu Su will succeed,” said Zhuge Liang. “And I see in the heavens signs of an assembly of generals in the southeast, so I shall go there. The mourning for Zhou Yu will serve as a pretext. I may find some able leaders there to be of help to you.” “I am afraid lest the generals of the South Land harm you,” said Liu Bei. “While Zhou Yu lived, I did not fear; is there anything to dread now that he is gone?” However, Zhuge Liang took Zhao Yun as commander of his escort when he embarked for Baqiu, and on the road he heard of Lu Su's succession to the late general's post. As the coffin of Zhou Yu had been sent to Chaisang, Zhuge Liang continued his journey thither and, on landing, was kindly received by Lu Su. The officers of the South Land did not conceal their enmity, but the sight of the redoubtable Zhao Yun, always close at hand, kept them from trying to hurt Zhuge Liang. The officers brought by Zhuge Liang were arranged in order before the bier, and he himself poured the libation. Then he knelt and read this threnody:"
玄德入城安撫己畢，賞勞三軍。乃問衆將曰：“零陵已取了，桂陽郡何人敢取？”趙雲應曰：“某願往。”張飛奮然出曰：“飛亦願往！”二人相爭。孔明曰：“終是子龍先應，只敎子龍去。”張飛不服，定要去取。孔明敎拈鬮，拈着的便去。又是子龍拈着。張飛怒曰：“我並不要人相幫，只獨領三千軍去，穩取城池。”趙雲曰：“某也只領三千軍去。如不得城，願受軍令。”孔明大喜，責了軍令狀，選三千精兵付趙雲去。張飛不服，玄德喝退。,"Xuande entered the city to appease Jibi and rewarded the three armies. He asked the generals: ""Lingling has been taken, who would dare to take it in Guiyang County?"" Zhao Yun replied, ""I would like to go."" Zhang Fei rushed out and said, ""Flying is also willing to go!"" The two fought. Kong Ming said: ""In the end, Zilong responded first, and only sent Zilong to go."" Zhang Fei refused to accept it and decided to take it. Kong Ming cast lots, and those who cast them go. It's Zilong again. Zhang Fei said angrily, ""I don't want anyone to help me. I only lead three thousand troops to secure the city."" Zhao Yun said, ""Someone only leads three thousand troops. The order was issued, and three thousand elite soldiers were selected to go to Zhao Yun. Zhang Fei refused to accept it, and Xuande withdrew.","Now Xuande has to plan for the capture of Guiyang and he calls for a volunteer. Zhao Zilong immediately offers, but Zhang Fei somewhat brusquely says he wants to go. This creates considerable tension and disagreement between the two warriors until Kong Ming says that, as Zhao Zilong volunteered first, he is the chosen one. Zhang Fei furiously rejects this, so Kong Ming has them choose lots, and once again fate determines that it will be Zilong. Zhang Fei tries one more time by saying that he could capture the city with just three thousand men, to which Zilong retorts, ‘Well, so can I.’ So it is that Zilong departs – to Kong Ming’s delight – with just three thousand men. Xuande tells Zhang Fei in no uncertain terms to shut up and retire with at least some semblance of grace.","Liu Bei entered the city, calmed and reassured the people and rewarded his army. But he at once began to think of the next move and asked for an officer to volunteer to take Guiyang. Zhao Yun offered, but Zhang Fei vehemently proposed himself for the command of the expedition. So they wrangled and contended. Then said Zhuge Liang, “Undoubtedly Zhao Yun was first to volunteer, wherefore he is to go.” Still Zhang Fei opposed and insisted on going. They were told to decide the dispute by drawing lots, and Zhao Yun drew the winning lot. Zhang Fei was still very angry and grumbled, “I would not have wanted any helpers: just three thousand soldiers and I would have done it.” “I also only want three thousand soldiers,” said Zhao Yun. “And if I fail, I am willing to suffer the penalties.” Zhuge Liang was pleased that Zhao Yun recognized his responsibility so fully, and with the commission gave Zhao Yun three thousand of veterans. Though the matter was thus settled, Zhang Fei was discontented and pressed his claim till Liu Bei bade him desist and retire."
操欲觀武官比試弓箭，乃使近侍將西川紅錦戰袍一領，挂於垂楊枝上，下設一箭垜，以百步為界。分武官為兩隊：曹氏宗族俱穿紅，其餘將士俱穿綠；各帶雕弓長箭，跨鞍勒馬，聽候指揮。操傳令曰：“有能射中箭垜紅心者，卽以錦袍賜之；如射不中，罰水一盃。”號令方下，紅袍隊中，一個少年將軍驟馬而出，衆視之，乃曹休也。休飛馬往來，奔馳三次，扣上箭，拽滿弓，一箭射去，正中紅心。金鼓齊鳴，衆皆喝采。曹操於臺上望見大喜，曰：“此吾家千里駒也！”方欲使人取錦袍與曹休，只見綠袍隊中，一騎飛出，叫曰：“丞相錦袍，合讓俺外姓先取，宗族中不宜攙越。”操視其人，乃文聘也。衆官曰：“且看文仲業射法。”文聘拈弓縱馬一箭，亦中紅心。衆皆喝采，金鼓亂鳴。聘大呼曰：“快取袍來！”只見紅袍隊中，又一將飛馬而出，厲聲曰：“文烈先射，汝何得爭奪？看我與你兩個解箭！”拽滿弓，一箭射去，也中紅心。衆人齊聲喝采。視其人，乃曹洪也。洪方欲取袍，只見綠袍隊裏又一將出，揚弓叫曰：“你三人射法，何足為奇！看我射來！”衆視之，乃張郃也。郃飛馬翻身，背射一箭，也中紅心。四枝箭齊齊的攢在紅心裏。衆人都道：“好射法！”郃曰：“錦袍須該是我的！”言未畢，紅袍隊中一將飛馬而出，大叫曰：“汝翻身背射，何足稱異！看我奪射紅心！”衆視之，乃夏侯淵也。淵驟馬至界口，紐回身一箭射去，正在四箭當中。金鼓齊鳴。淵勒馬按弓大叫曰：“此箭可奪得錦袍麼？”只見綠袍隊裏，一將應聲而出，大叫：“且留下錦袍與我徐晃！”淵曰：“汝更有何射法，可奪我袍？”晃曰：“汝射紅心，不足為異。看我單取錦袍！”拈弓搭箭，遙望柳條射去，恰好射斷柳條，錦袍墜地。徐晃飛取錦袍，披於身上，驟馬至臺前聲喏曰：“謝丞相袍！”曹操與衆官無不稱羨。晃纔勒馬要回，猛然臺邊躍出一個綠袍將軍，大呼曰：“你將錦袍那裏去？早早留下與我！”衆視之，乃許褚也。晃曰：“袍已在此，汝何敢強奪！”褚更不回答，竟飛馬來奪袍。兩馬相近，徐晃便把弓打許褚。褚一手按住弓，把徐晃拖離鞍鞽。晃急棄了弓，翻身下馬，褚亦下馬，兩個揪住廝打。操急使人解開。那領錦袍已是扯得粉碎。操令二人都上臺。徐晃睜眉怒目，許褚切齒咬牙：各有相鬥之意。操笑曰：“孤特視公等之勇耳。豈惜一錦袍哉？”便敎諸將盡都上臺，各賜蜀錦一疋。諸將各各稱謝。操命各依位次而坐。樂聲競奏，水陸並陳。文官武將輪次把盞，獻酬交錯。,"Cao wanted to watch the military officers compete with bows and arrows, so he made his valet general Xichuan's red brocade shirt with a collar, hung on a weeping poplar branch, and an arrow ridge below, with a hundred steps as the boundary. The military attachés are divided into two teams: the Cao clan all wear red, and the rest of the soldiers wear green; each with a carved bow and long arrow, straddling the saddle and reining in the horse, waiting for command. Cao sent the order: ""If anyone can hit an arrow and get a red heart, he will be given a brocade robe; if he misses a shot, he will be punished with a glass of water."" As it is, it is Cao Xiu. Hugh Pegasus came and went, galloped three times, buckled the arrow, pulled the bow full, and shot the arrow in the center of the red heart. The golden drums rang in unison, and everyone applauded. Cao Cao saw the great joy on the stage, and said, ""This is my horse of a thousand miles!"" Fang wanted to send someone to take the brocade robe and Cao Xiu, but a horse in the green robe team flew out and called, ""The prime minister, the brocade robe, let me join. Foreign surnames are taken first, and it is not advisable to mix them up in the clan.” It is also a civil servant to treat people as they are. The officials said, ""Let's look at Wen Zhongye's shooting method."" Wen Ping took a bow and slid an arrow on the horse, which also hit a red heart. The crowd applauded, and the golden drums roared wildly. Pin shouted, ""Quickly retrieve the robes!"" I saw another general in the red robe team flying out and said sharply: ""Wen Lie shoots first, why do you have to fight? Look at me and you two free arrows!"" The bow is full, and an arrow is shot, and it also hits a red heart. The crowd applauded in unison. Depending on the person, it is Cao Hong. When Hong Fang wanted to take the robe, he saw another general in the green robe team coming out. He raised his bow and shouted, ""It's amazing that the three of you shoot! Watch me shoot!"" He Pegasus turned over and shot an arrow in the back, also hitting a red heart. The four arrows are all stored in the red heart. Everyone said, ""Good shooting!"" He said, ""The golden robe must be mine!"" Before he could finish speaking, a general in the red robe jumped out and shouted, ""You turn over and shoot with your back, how can you be called? Different! Watch me shoot the red heart!"" Everyone looked at it, and it was Xiahou Yuan. Yuan suddenly reached the border, and New turned around and shot an arrow, in the middle of the four arrows. The golden drums sounded. Yuan Le's horse pressed his bow and shouted, ""Can this arrow win the brocade robe?"" I saw a general in the green robe team coming out in response, shouting, ""Leave the brocade robe with me Xu Huang!"" Yuan said: ""What more archery do you have to take away my robe?"" Huang said, ""You shoot the red heart, it's not a big deal. Let me just take the brocade robe!"" The robe fell to the ground. Xu Huangfei took a brocade robe and put it on his body, and suddenly he rode to the front of the stage and shouted, ""Thank you for the robe!"" Cao Cao and all the officials admired him. Huang Cai pulled back his horse to return, and suddenly a green-robed general jumped out of the stage, shouting, ""Where are you going with the brocade robe? Stay with me early!"" Everyone looked at it, and it was Xu Chu. Huang said: ""The robe is already here, why would you dare to take it by force!"" Chu didn't answer, but flew to take the robe. When the two horses were close, Xu Huang hit Xu Chu with his bow. Chu held down the bow with one hand and dragged Xu Huang away from the saddle. Huang gave up his bow in a hurry, turned over and dismounted, Chu also dismounted, and the two grabbed and fought. Anxiety unravels. The brocade robe was already torn to shreds. Order both of them to come on stage. Xu Huang frowned, Xu Chu gritted his teeth: each had the intention of fighting each other. Cao laughed and said, ""Gute respects the brave ears of the public. Why do you regret a brocade robe?"" All generals thank you. They were ordered to sit in order. The music competes, and the land and water are combined. Civil servants and military generals took turns to hold the lamps, and the rewards were staggered.","This astonishing building – with its three tall towers, lined by walkways and decorated with glittering gold and jewel decorations – is his pride and joy, and to celebrate its completion he hosts a festival. At the celebration banquet, poets are invited to compete with each other to see who can write the most flattering ode. When they have finished, Cao Cao delivers a mockingly self-effacing speech. ‘I’m but a simple, ordinary man. All I’ve ever really wanted is to live quietly in a humble cottage in the countryside, but our turbulent times have meant I’ve been exalted by being made a military commander and have had to come to the rescue of the emperor. All I ever want to be remembered for can be best summed up by what I hope might be written on my tomb. “Here lies Lord Cao Cao, the Han general who quelled the west”. Never forget, it was I who got rid of Dong Zhuo; crushed the Yellow Headbands; destroyed Yuan Shu; defeated Lü Bu; exterminated Yuan Shao; conquered Liu Biao and so brought peace to the empire. I’m the most important of all his imperial majesty’s servants, and without me – who knows – many might have tried to seize the throne for themselves! I always hold dear those words of Kong Fu Zi about King Wen and his “perfect virtue” and if I could I would give up all this power and retire. But this is sadly not possible at the moment. If I were to retire, someone would probably try to kill me, and then what would become of the Han dynasty? You clearly have no real depth of understanding of my position.’ This self-congratulatory prose causes all the officials present to kowtow and proclaim how immensely wise he is, unequalled by any of the great ministers of the past,","For the military officers was arranged an archery competition, and one of his attendants brought forth a robe of red crimson Xichuan silk as a prize. This was suspended from one of the drooping branches of a willow tree, beneath which was the target. The distance was a hundred paces. The competitors were divided into two bands, those of Cao Cao's own family being dressed in red and the others in green. They all had carved bows and long arrows and were mounted. They stood holding in their steeds till the signal should be given for the games to begin. Each was to shoot one arrow and the robe was the guerdon for hitting the target in the red; misses were to pay a forfeit of drinking a cup of cold water. As soon as the signal was given, a red-robed youth rode quickly forth. He was Cao Xiu. Swiftly he galloped to and fro thrice. Then he adjusted the notch of his arrow to the string, pulled the bow to its full, and the arrow flew straight to the bull's eye. The clang of the gongs and the roll of the drums announced the feat, which astonished them all. And Cao Cao, as he sat on the terrace, was delighted. “A very promising colt of my own,” said he to those about him, and he sent a messenger for the red robe that the winner might receive it from his own hands. But suddenly from the green side rode out one who cried, “ It were more fitting to let outsiders compete for the Prime Minister's silken robe; it is not right that members of the family monopolize the contest.” Cao Cao looked at the speaker, who was Wen Ping. And some of the officers cried, “Let us see what his shooting is like!” So Wen Ping fitted an arrow to the string and fired also from horseback while galloping. To the surprise of the onlookers, he also made a bull's eye, which was honored by another salute from gongs and drums. “Quickly bring me the robe,” cried Wen Ping. But at once from the ranks of the red-robed another competitor dashed forward, shouting fiercely, “How can you win what has been already won? But let me show you how I can shoot an arrow that shall overcome both your shots.” He drew his bow to the full, and the arrow flew straight to the heart of the red. The surprised onlookers saw that this new competitor was Cao Hong, who now became also a claimant for the robe. However, yet another archer came forth from the green-robed ranks, playing with his bow and crying, “What is there amazing in your shooting, you three? See how I can shoot.” This man was Zhang He. He put his horse to the gallop, then turned his back and, shooting backwards, also hit the center of the red. Thus four arrows were now sticking in the bull's eye, and all agreed that it was marvelous archery. “I think the robe should be mine,” said Zhang He. Before he could finish speaking, a fifth competitor came out from the red robes and shouted, “You shot backwards; but that is commonplace enough. Look while I shoot better than you all.” The speaker was Xiahou Yuan. He galloped off to the very limit, and then bending his body over backwards he sent his arrow right in among the other four. As the gongs and drums broke out, Xiahou Yuan put aside his bow and rode up, saying, “Is not that a better shot than any of its predecessors?” Then came out another from the greens who cried, “Leave the robe there for me, Xu Huang, to win.” “What can you do that is better than my shot?” said Xiahou Yuan. “That you hit the bull's eye is no great feat. You will see me win the silken robe after all.” So speaking, Xu Huang fitted an arrow to his bow. Then looking around, he aimed at the willow twig from which the robe hung down and shot thereat so true that his arrow cut it through, and the robe fluttered to the ground. At once Xu Huang dashed along, picked up the robe and slipped it on. Then riding swiftly to the terrace, he thanked the Prime Minister. No one present could withhold unstinted praise, and Xu Huang was turning to ride away when another green clad general leaped out, saying, “Where would you go with that robe? Quickly leave it for me!” All eyes turned to this man who was Xu Chu. Xu Huang cried, “The robe has already been adjudged to me; would you dare take it by forces” Xu Chu made no reply but galloped up to snatch the robe. As Xu Chu's horse drew near, Xu Huang struck at his rival a blow with his bow. But Xu Chu seized the bow with one hand while with the other he simply lifted his opponent out of his seat. Wherefore Xu Huang let go the bow and the next moment lay sprawling on the ground. Xu Chu slipped out of the saddle too, and they began to pommel each other with their fists. Cao Cao sent one to separate them; but in the struggle, the robe had been torn and soiled. Cao Cao called the angry rivals before him; and they came, one darting fierce looks of hate, the other grinding his teeth with rage. “Never mind the robe; I see only your magnificent courage,” said Cao Cao smiling. “What does a robe more or less matter?” Whereupon Cao Cao called the generals to him one by one, and to each he presented a robe of Xichuan silk. They thanked him for the generous gifts, and he then commanded them to take their seats in due order. Then to the strains of a band of music, wherein each performer vied with all the others, the naval and military officers took their places. Civil officers of repute and generals of renown drank one to another, and hearty felicitations were exchanged."
却說玄德奔回新野，自知失言取禍，未對衆人言之。忽使者至，請赴襄陽。孫乾曰：“昨見主公匆匆而回，意甚不樂。愚意度之，在荊州必有事故。今忽請赴會，不可輕往。”玄德方將前項事訴與諸人。雲長曰：“兄自疑心語失。劉荊州並無嗔責之意。外人之言，未可輕信。襄陽離此不遠，若不去，則荊州反生疑矣。”玄德曰：“雲長之言是也。”張飛曰：“‘筵無好筵，會無好會’，不如休去。”趙雲曰：“某將馬步軍三百人同往，可保主公無事。”玄德曰：“如此甚好。”,"But he said that Xuande rushed back to Xinye, knowing that he was wrong, and he did not tell the crowd. Suddenly the messenger arrives, please go to Xiangyang. Sun Qian said: ""I saw the lord hurriedly returning yesterday, and I was very unhappy. I was foolish to save it, and there must be an accident in Jingzhou. Now I suddenly invite you to the meeting, don't take it lightly."" Xuande told everyone about the previous matter. Yun Chang said: ""Brother, I suspect that I have lost my words. Liu Jingzhou does not mean to be angry. The words of outsiders should not be taken lightly. Xiangyang is not far from here. If you don't go, Jingzhou will become suspicious."" Xuande said: ""What Yunchang said is true."" Zhang Fei said: ""'If there is no good feast at the banquet, there will be no good meeting', so it is better to leave."" Zhao Yun said: ""A certain general and 300 troops of horses will go with him, and the lord will be safe."" Xuan De said, ""That's very good.""","However, undaunted by the failure of his poem plot, Cai Mao plans to bring Xuande back to Jingzhou in order to kill him. He is to be lured back by suggesting a celebration of the good harvests that have taken place. When the invitation arrives, Xuande agrees to go, despite the warnings of Zhao Zilong and Sun Qian.","It has been said that Liu Bei made the best of his way home to Xinye. He felt that he had offended by that slip in speech, but determined to keep silence about it and attempt no explanation. So he discussed it with nobody. Then came the message asking him to preside at the Festival, and he needed counsel. Sun Qian said, “You have seemed worried and preoccupied lately, and I think something untoward happened at Jingzhou. You should consider well before you accept this invitation.” Thereupon Liu Bei told his confidants the whole story. Guan Yu said, “You yourself think your speech offended the Imperial Protector, but he said nothing to show displeasure. You need pay no attention to the babble of outsiders like Yi Ji. Xiangyang is quite near and, if you do not go, Liu Biao will begin to suspect something really is wrong.” “You speak well,” said Liu Bei. Said Zhang Fei, “Banquets are no good; gatherings are no better; it is best not to go.” “Let me take three hundred horse and foot as escort; there will be no trouble then,” said Zhao Yun. “That is the best course,” said Liu Bei."
却說趙雲與五百軍在東府前住，終日無事，只去城外射箭走馬。看看年終。雲猛省：“孔明分付三個錦囊與我，敎我一到南徐，開第一個；住到年終，開第二個；臨到危急無路之時，開第三個：於內有神出鬼沒之計，可保主公回家。此時歲已將終，主公貪戀女色，並不見面，何不拆開第二個錦囊，看計而行？”遂拆開視之。原來如此神策。卽日逕到府堂，要見玄德。侍婢報曰：“趙子龍有緊急事來報貴人。”玄德喚入問之。雲佯作失驚之狀曰：“主公深居畫堂，不想荊州耶？”玄德曰：“有甚事如此驚怪？”雲曰：“今早孔明使人來報，說曹操要報赤壁鏖兵之恨，起精兵五十萬，殺奔荊州，甚是危急，請主公便回。”玄德曰：“必須與夫人商議。”雲曰：“若和夫人商議，必不肯敎主公回。不如休說，今晚便好起程。遲則誤事。”玄德曰：“你且暫退，我自有道理。”雲故意催逼數番而出。玄德入見孫夫人，暗暗垂淚。孫夫人曰：“丈夫何故煩惱？”玄德曰：“念備一身飄蕩異鄕，生不能侍奉二親，又不能祭祀宗祖，乃大逆不孝也。今歲旦在邇，使備悒怏不已。”孫夫人曰：“你休瞞我：我已聽知了也！方纔趙子龍報說荊州危急，你欲還鄕，故推此意。”玄德跪而告曰：“夫人旣知，備安敢相瞞？備欲不去，使荊州有失，被天下人恥笑；欲去，又捨不得夫人：因此煩惱。”夫人曰：“妾已事君，任君所之，妾當相隨。”玄德曰：“夫人之心，雖則如此，爭奈國太與吳侯安肯容夫人去？夫人若可憐劉備，暫時辭別。”言畢，淚如雨下。孫夫人勸曰：“丈夫休得煩惱。妾當苦告母親，必放妾與君同去。”玄德曰：“縱然國太肯時，吳侯必然阻擋。”孫夫人沈吟良久，乃曰：“妾與君正旦拜賀時，推稱江邊祭祖，不告而去，若何？”玄德又跪而謝曰：“若如此，生死難忘。切勿漏泄。”兩個商議已定。玄德密喚趙雲分付：“正旦日，你先引軍士出城，於官道等候。吾推祭祖，與夫人同走。”雲領諾。建安十五年春正月元旦，吳侯大會文武於堂上。玄德與孫夫人入拜國太。孫夫人曰：“夫主想父母宗祖墳墓，俱在涿郡，晝夜傷感不已。今日欲往江邊，望北遙祭，須告母親得知。”國太曰：“此孝道也，豈有不從？汝雖不識舅姑，可同汝夫前去祭拜，亦見為婦之禮。”孫夫人同玄德拜謝而出。,"But they said that Zhao Yun and the five hundred troops lived in front of the East Mansion, and they had nothing to do all day long, and only went outside the city to shoot arrows and go horses. Look at the end of the year. Yunmeng Province: ""Kongming gave me three kits, and taught me that once I arrive in Nanxu, I will open the first one; I will stay until the end of the year, and I will open the second one; when there is no way out, I will open the third one: I have The elusive plan can keep the lord home. At this time, the age is coming to an end, and the lord is greedy for women and does not meet, why not open the second bag and follow the plan?"" Then he opened it and looked at it. It was so brilliant. Youri went to the palace and wanted to see Xuande. The maid reported, ""Zhao Zilong has an urgent matter to report to the noble."" Xuande called in and asked. Yun pretended to be surprised and said, ""My lord is living in the painting hall, and you don't want Jingzhou?"" Xuande said, ""What's so surprising?"" Yun said, ""This morning Kongming sent someone to report, saying that Cao Cao would report it. The hatred of the fierce soldiers in Chibi, 500,000 elite soldiers were sent to Jingzhou, and it was very urgent, please go back to the lord."" Xuande said: ""You must discuss with your wife."" Yun said, ""If you discuss with your wife, you will not be willing to teach me. The lord is back. Why don't you say, it's better to leave tonight. If you are late, it will be a mistake."" Xuande said: ""You should retreat for a while, I have a reason."" Yun deliberately forced him out several times. Xuande wept secretly when he saw Mrs. Sun. Mrs. Sun said: ""Why is my husband troubled?"" Xuande said: ""Nianbei is a wandering body, unable to serve his two relatives, and he can't worship the ancestors. Mrs. Sun said, ""Don't lie to me: I have already heard! Just now Zhao Zilong reported that Jingzhou is in danger, and you want to return it, so you put it aside."" Xuande knelt down and said, ""Madam, you know, be prepared. An dare to hide from each other? If you don’t want to go, you will make Jingzhou lose, and you will be ridiculed by the world; if you want to go, you can’t bear your wife: so you are troubled.” The wife said: “The concubine has already served the king, and the concubine should follow him.” Xuande said: ""Madam's heart, even so, Zheng Nai Guotai and Wu Hou An are willing to let Madam go? If Madam takes pity on Liu Bei, I will bid farewell for the time being."" Mrs. Sun advised: ""The husband is troubled. The concubine should tell the mother that she will let the concubine go with the king."" Xuande said: ""Even if the state is too willing, the Marquis of Wu will definitely block it."" Mrs. Sun pondered for a long time, then said : ""When the concubine and Jun Zhengdan paid congratulations, they said that they would worship their ancestors by the riverside, and they left without telling me. What if?"" Xuande knelt down again and thanked: ""If this is the case, life and death will be unforgettable. Don't leak it."" The two discussions have been settled. Xuande secretly called Zhao Yun to pay: ""On the day of Zhengdan, you should lead the sergeant out of the city first and wait on the official road. I push the sacrifice to the ancestors and go with the wife."" Yun Lingnuo. In the fifteenth year of Jian'an, on the first day of the first month of the year, the Marquis of Wu gathered in the hall. Xuande and Mrs. Sun went to worship Guotai. Mrs. Sun said: ""My husband thinks that the tombs of my parents and ancestors are in Zhuo County, and I feel sad day and night. Today, if I want to go to the riverside and look at the northern distance for sacrifice, I must tell my mother."" Guo Tai said: ""This is filial piety. No? Although you don’t know your uncle and aunt, you can go to worship with your husband, and you will also see the ceremony of being a wife.” Mrs. Sun and Xuande went out with thanks.","While this is going on, Zhao Zilong and his men fill their time with sports, entertainments, wine, women and song. However, as month extends into month and the end of the year draws near, Zilong remembers what Kong Ming said. ‘When that happens, open the second bag.’ No sooner has he read the second document than he goes to see Xuande. ‘My lord,’ says Zilong, ‘this morning news came from Kong Ming that Cao Cao, bent upon revenge, has set off with five hundred thousand men to take Jingzhou. Kong Ming asks that you return at once.’ ‘Well, I’ll go and discuss this with my wife,’ replies Xuande, whereupon Zilong says if he does she is bound to tell him not to go! ‘We need to leave immediately.’ But Xuande will not be dissuaded. Entering Lady Sun’s room, Xuande weeps and falls down before her and pretends that he has suddenly realized he has failed to pay due respect and regard to his parents and to make the ritual sacrifices to his ancestors. ‘With the New Year almost upon us, I’m overwhelmed with distress at this,’ he claims. ‘Don’t try and fool me!’ replies Lady Sun. ‘I know perfectly well what this is all about. Zhao Zilong has told you that Jingzhou is about to be taken. You’re being called back, and this frankly was just a poor excuse in order for me to let you go.’ With no option left, Xuande says, ‘Let me speak honestly. If I stay here, and Jingzhou is lost, I’ll be a laughing stock. But I don’t want to leave you! This is my dilemma.’ ‘I’m your wife and I’ll go where my lord goes.’ ‘This may be how you see things, but I cannot believe that your mother or brother will agree. Just have compassion on me and let me go for a brief time.’ Lady Sun tells him to pull himself together, as she will ask her mother’s permission, but Xuande says her brother won’t agree to her leaving. Then Lady Sun comes up with an idea: ‘When we go to offer the New Year sacrifices, I’ll say you wish to pay your respects to your ancestors, and that we’ll go to the river to do this. Then we can escape from there with no one watching. What do you think?’ Kneeling before her, Xuande says emotionally, ‘If you will do this for me, I will never ever forget it, whether I am dead or alive. But we must keep this absolutely secret.’ Xuande tells Zhao Zilong to lead his men to the main road on New Year’s Day and be ready to leave. So it is that on New Year’s Day AD 210 Sun Quan hosts a huge celebration. Lady Sun and Xuande enter and kowtow before the queen mother. Lady Sun says that her husband’s parents and ancestors lie buried in the north in Zhuo County and that being unable to get there has caused him much grief. ‘Today he wishes to go to the river and face the north to offer his prayers for that holy place. We have come to let you know.’ The queen mother is deeply touched by such filial piety. ‘I know you never had the chance to meet your parents-in-law, so you should accompany him, for this is fitting.’ And so, kowtowing once more, the pair make their escape.","Zhao Yun and the company under him led an idle life in the front portion of the Eastern Palace, save that at times they went outside the city for archery and horse-racing. And thus passed the year. Suddenly Zhao Yun remembered the orders he had received and the three bags with the plans in them. It was time to open the second one for the end of the year was nigh. His orders were only to open the third when danger was very near and there appeared no way out. As already remarked, the year was drawing to a close, and Zhao Yun saw his lord daily becoming more and more the slave of pleasure. Liu Bei never appeared among his guards now. So the bag was opened and in pursuance of the wonderful scheme thereby discovered, Zhao Yun went to the hall of the Palace and asked to see his master. The maid in attendance went within and said, “Zhao Yun has some important matter on which to see the master.” Liu Bei called him in and asked what the business was. Zhao Yun assumed an attitude of great concern and said, “My lord, you are living happily secluded in these beautiful apartments; do you never think of Jingzhou?” “But what is the matter that you seem so disturbed?” asked Liu Bei. “Today early Zhuge Liang sent a messenger to say that Cao Cao was trying to avenge his last defeat and was leading five hundred thousand troops to attack Jingzhou, which was in great danger. And he wished you to return.” “I must speak to my wife,” said Liu Bei. “If you consult her, she will be unwilling for you to return. It would be better to say nothing but to start this evening. Delay may do great damage.” “Retire for a time; I must act discreetly,” said Liu Bei. Zhao Yun urged the need to return several times more, but finally went away. Liu Bei went into his wife's rooms and began to weep silently. Seeing his tears, Lady Sun said, “Why are you so sad, my husband?” Liu Bei replied, “I have been driven hither and thither all my life. I was never able to do my duty to my parents nor have I been able to sacrifice to my ancestors. I have been very unfilial. The new year is at hand, and its approach disquiets me greatly.” “Do not try to deceive me,” said Lady Sun. “I heard and I know all. Just now Zhao Yun came to tell you Jingzhou was threatened and you wish to return home. That is why you put forward this excuse.” Then Liu Bei fell on his knees and said, “Why should I dissemble, O Wife, since you know? I do not wish to go, but if Jingzhou be lost, I shall be an object of ridicule to everyone. I do desire to go, but I cannot leave you. Now you know why I am grieved.” She replied, “I am your handmaid, and whithersoever you go, it is my duty to follow.” “Yes; your heart is right, but the difficulty is your mother and the Marquis; they will be unwilling. If you would have pity on me and let me go for a time——” And again the tears gushed forth. “Do not be so sad, my husband,” said Lady Sun. “I will implore my mother to let us go, and she will surely allow it.” “Even supposing the Dowager permits, I am sure the Marquis will hinder.” Lady Sun said nothing for a long time while she weighed the matter thoroughly. Presently she spoke, “On New Year's Day you and I will go to court and present our congratulations. Then we will give the excuse of a sacrifice on the river bank and go away without formal leave. Will that suit you?” Liu Bei knelt at her feet and expressed his gratitude. “I should be never so grateful,” said he. “Dead or alive I would remember your love. But this must be a perfect secret.” This having been decided and the arrangements made; Liu Bei gave Zhao Yun secret orders, saying, “Lead your company out of the city and be on the road on New Year's morn. We are going away.” Sun Quan held a grand court on the New Year's Day of the fifteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 210). Liu Bei and his bride went into the Dowager Marchioness' presence, and Lady Sun said, “My husband has been thinking of his ancestors, who lie in the county of Zhuo, and grieves that he cannot do his duty by them. Today we wish to go to the river side and offer sacrifice toward the north. It is our duty to inform you.” “A very filial proceeding,” said the Dowager. “I should not think of stopping you. Although you have never known your husband's parents, yet you may go with him to sacrifice as it is proper for a wife to do.” Both thanked the Dowager Marchioness and went out, rejoicing at having so far hoodwinked Sun Quan."

In the middle of the night, when the moon is bright, the staff walks into the back garden, stands on the side of the tea mill frame, and weeps in the sky. Suddenly I heard someone standing by the Peony Pavilion, sighing for a long time. Allowed to sneak a peek at it, it was Diaochan, a singer in the house. His daughter was selected into the mansion since childhood, taught to sing and dance, she was twenty-eight years old, and she was good at sex and art, and she was allowed to treat her with a pro-daughter. Ye Yun listened to it for a long time, and shouted, ""A slut will have an affair?"" Diao Chan knelt down in shock and replied, ""An unscrupulous concubine dares to have an affair!"" Yun said, ""You have no selfishness, why did you sigh in the depths of the night? ""Chan said: ""Rong concubine to express the words of the heart."" Yun said: ""You don't hide, tell me the truth."" Chan said: ""The concubine is favored by the adults, trained in singing and dancing, and treats each other with courtesy. In case. I saw the frowning frowns of the adults recently, there must be a national event, but I dare not ask. Tonight, I see Xing Si uneasy again, so I sigh deeply. I don’t want to see for the adults. He hit the ground and said, ""Who would think that the world of Han is in your hands! Come with me to the painting pavilion."" Diaochan followed Yun to the pavilion, and Yun gave out his concubines. Diao Chan fell to the ground in shock and said, ""Why is your lord like this?"" Yun said, ""You are pitiful for all the living beings in the world!"" At the end of the sentence, tears welled up. Diao Chan said: ""The humble concubine once said: But if there is an envoy, I will never give up."" Yun knelt down and said, ""The common people are in danger of being overthrown, and the ruler and ministers are in a hurry. You can't save them. I want to usurp the throne; there is nothing I can do about martial arts in the court. Dong Zhuo has a righteous son, surnamed Lu and name Bu, who is very brave. I think both of them are lecherous people. You took convenience from the middle, and spyed his father and son against his face, and ordered Bu to kill Zhuo, which was a great evil. It is your power to help the society and establish the country again. I don't know what your intention is?"" Diao Chan said: ""My concubine Xu If you die, I hope you will offer your concubine to him. The concubine has its own reason."" Yun said: ""If the matter leaks, I will destroy the door."" Diaochan said: ""Sir, don't worry. ""Thank you.","Returning from this particular dreadful event, the minister Wang Yun is in despair. It is the late evening, and he wanders into his garden, hoping to find there some peace and so to restore his spirits. He raises his eyes to Heaven and weeps. Then suddenly he hears a sound nearby. It is a deep, heartfelt sigh of distress. Approaching, he finds it is a young woman called Diao Chan who has grown up as a singing girl in his house. She is both beautiful and bright and he considers her almost as a daughter. ‘What have you done wrong, young lady?’ he asks. ‘I would never do anything wrong,’ Diao Chan replies, startled to see him. ‘So why are you so distressed?’ Wang Yun asks. ‘Let me tell you the truth from the very bottom of my heart,’ she replies. ‘You’ve looked after me and had me tutored in the arts of music and dancing and have always been generous to me. Nothing I can do could ever repay you. But I’ve noticed recently that you seem unhappy – I can see it in your face. Yet who am I to ask you what’s troubling you? Then tonight I saw you in the garden and this made me sigh … never for a moment thinking you’d hear me. If there is anything I can do to help, I would be prepared to embrace death itself over and over again.’ Wang Yun is speechless for a moment and then says, ‘The whole Han dynasty is about to be destroyed. But, you, I really think you could be the one to save it. Come.’ And the bewildered young woman follows him to his own chambers. Dismissing the other servants, he sits her down on a chair and then prostrates himself before her. ‘What are you doing, my lord?’ Diao Chan cries, and in return she prostrates herself before him, asking, ‘What is going on?’ In tears, Wang Yun asks, ‘Can you have pity on the people of our land and for the Han dynasty?’ ‘I am willing to undergo any number of deaths if I can be of service,’ she replies. ‘Listen, the truth is,’ says Wang Yun still kneeling on the ground before her, ‘that the people are in grave danger but you could be the one who will save us all! It’s now crystal clear that Dong Zhuo plans to usurp the throne, and there’s no one who can stand up to him. Dong Zhuo has an adopted son, Lü Bu, a great warrior, and, like his father, he loves beautiful women. My plan is to set a trap for them both by promising you in marriage to Lü Bu. Once he is caught in this engagement then I’ll offer you to Dong Zhuo as well. This will mean you can set them against each other. If you can incite Lü Bu to kill Dong Zhuo you can end this terrible evil, and then the sacred order of our land will be restored. I’m sure you can do this … But it is very dangerous. Are you willing?’ Diao Chan replies immediately, ‘I’m willing to die ten thousand deaths. Just say the word, and I will be ready to go and meet them. Then just leave it to me!’ ‘Nothing of this must leak out,’ says Wang Yun lowering his voice, ‘or we’ll all be killed.’ ‘Have no fear,’ Diao Chan reassures him. ‘Not even a thousand knives could prise this secret from me.’ ‘Thank you, thank you, thank you,’ says Wang Yun.","One of them, Minister of the Interior Wang Yun, who had witnessed all this, returned to his palace very pensive and much distressed. The same evening, a bright moonlight night, he took his staff and went strolling in his private garden. Standing near one of the creeper trellises, he gazed up at the sky and the tears rolled down his cheeks. Suddenly he heard a rustle in the Peony Pavilion and someone sighing deeply. Stealthily creeping near, he saw there one of the household singing girls named Diao Chan. This maiden had been brought up in his palace, where she had been taught to sing and dance. At twenty-one, she was then just bursting into womanhood, a pretty and clever girl whom Wang Yun regarded more as a daughter than a dependant. After listening for some time, Wang Yun suddenly called out, “What mischief are you up to there, you naughty girl?” The maiden dropped on her knees in terror, saying, “Would thy unworthy handmaid dare to do anything wrong?” “Then what are you sighing about out here in the darkness?” “May thy handmaid speak from the bottom of her heart?” “Tell me the whole truth; do not conceal anything.” And the girl said, “Thy handmaid has been the recipient of bountiful kindness. She has been taught to sing and dance and been treated so kindly that were she torn in pieces for her lord's sake, it would not repay a thousandth part. She has noticed lately that her lord's brows have been knit in distress and knows it is on account of the state troubles. But she has not dared to ask. This evening he seemed more sad than ever, and she was miserable on her lord's account. But she did not know she would be seen. Could she be of any use she would not shrink from a myriad deaths.” A sudden idea came to Wang Yun, and he stuck the ground with his staff. And he said, “Who would think that the fate of Han lay on your palm? Come with me!” The girl followed him into the house. Then he dismissed all the waiting attendants, placed Diao Chan on a chair and bowed before her. She was frightened and threw herself on the ground, asking in terror what it all meant. Said Wang Yun, “You can sympathize with the people of Han,” and the fount of his tears opened afresh. “My lord, as thy handmaid said just now, use her in any way; thy handmaid will never shrink,” said the girl. Wang Yun knelt, saying, “The people are on the brink of destruction, the prince and his officers are in jeopardy, and you, you are the only savior. That wretch Dong Zhuo wants to depose the Emperor and not a person among us can find means to stop him. Now he has a son, a bold warrior it is true, but both father and son have a weakness for beauty, and I am going to use what I may call the 'chaining' plan. I shall first propose you in marriage to Lu Bu and then, after you are betrothed, I shall present you to Dong Zhuo, and you will take every opportunity to force them asunder and turn sway their countenances from each other, cause the son to kill his adopted father and so put an end to the great evil. Thus you may restore the altars of the land that it may live again. All this lies within your power; will you do it?” “Thy handmaid has promised not to recoil from death itself. You may use my poor self in any way, and I must do my best.” “But if this gets abroad then we are all lost!” “Fear not;” said she, “if thy handmaid does not show gratitude, may she perish beneath a myriad swords!” “Thank you, thank you!” said Wang Yun."
譚、尚聽知曹軍自退，遂相慶賀。袁熙、高幹各自辭去。袁譚與郭圖、辛評議曰：“我為長子，反不能承父業；尚乃繼母所生，反承大爵：心實不甘。”圖曰：“主公可勒兵城外，只做請顯甫、審配飲酒，伏刀斧手殺之，大事定矣。”譚從其言。適別駕王修自靑州來，譚將此計告之。修曰：“兄弟者，左右手也。今與他人爭鬥，斷其右手，而曰我必勝，安可得乎？夫棄兄弟而不親，天下其誰親之？彼讒人離間骨肉，以求一朝之利，願塞耳勿聽也。”譚怒，叱退王修，使人去請袁尚。尚與審配商議。配曰：“此必郭圖之計也。主公若往，必遭奸計；不如乘勢攻之。”袁尚依言，便披挂上馬，引兵五萬出城。袁譚見袁尚引軍來，情知事泄，亦卽披挂上馬，與尚交鋒。尚見譚大罵。譚亦罵曰：“汝藥死父親，篡奪爵位，今又來殺兄耶！”二人親自交鋒，袁譚大敗。尚親冒矢石，衝突掩殺。譚引敗軍奔平原，尚收兵還。袁譚與郭圖再議進兵，令岑璧為將，領兵前來。尚自引兵出冀州。兩陣對圓，旗鼓相望。璧出罵陣；尚欲自戰，大將呂曠，拍馬舞刀，來戰岑璧；二將戰無數合，曠斬岑璧於馬下。譚兵又敗，再奔平原。審配勸尚進兵，追至平原。譚抵當不住，退入平原，堅守不出。尚三面圍城攻打。譚與郭圖計議。圖曰：“今城中糧少，彼軍方銳，勢不相敵。愚意可遣人投降曹操，使操將兵攻冀州，尚必還救。將軍引兵夾擊之，尚可擒矣。若操擊破尚軍，我因而斂其軍實以拒操。操軍遠來，糧食不繼，必自退去；我可以仍據冀州，以圖進取也。”,"When Tan and Shang heard that Cao's army had retreated, they congratulated each other. Yuan Xi and Gao Gan each resigned. Yuan Tan commented with Guo Tu and Xin, saying: ""I am the eldest son, so I cannot inherit my father's business; I am the son of my stepmother, so I am unwilling to inherit the great title: I am unwilling."" Xianfu and Shenpei drank and killed him with a knife and axe, and the big thing is settled."" Tan Congqi said. It's better not to drive Wang Xiu from Jinzhou, and Tan informs him of this plan. Xiu said, ""Brothers have left and right hands. Now I am fighting against others, I cut off their right hand, and they say that I will win, so I can get it? Husband abandons brother and does not kiss, who in the world will kiss him? For the benefit of the dynasty, please don’t listen to me.” Tan was angry, and ordered Wang Xiu to retreat, so he sent someone to invite Yuan Shang. Still negotiating with the appraiser. Pei said: ""This must be Guo Tu's plan. If the lord goes, he will be tricked; it is better to take advantage of the situation to attack him."" Yuan Tan saw that Yuan Shang was bringing in the army, and he was in a hurry, so he also put on his horse and confronted Shang. Shang Jian Tan cursed. Tan Yi scolded: ""You killed your father with medicine, usurped the title, and now come to kill your brother again!"" The two fought in person, and Yuan Tan was defeated. Shangqin took the arrow and stone, and the conflict covered up. Tan Yin's defeated army rushed to the plains, but he still withdrew his troops to return. Yuan Tan and Guo Tu discussed the advance of the army again, and ordered Cen Bi to lead the army. Shang Zi led troops out of Jizhou. The two circles face each other. Bi came out and scolded the formation; still wanted to fight on his own, the general Lu Kuang came to fight Cen Bi; the two generals fought countless battles, and Kuang cut Cen Bi under his horse. Tan Bing was defeated again and went to the plain again. Shen Pei persuaded Shang to enter the army and chase to the plain. Tan Da couldn't bear it, retreated into the plain, and couldn't hold on. Still besieged the city on three sides. Tan and Guo Tu plan a discussion. The picture says: ""Today there is little food in the city, and the army is sharp and invincible. You can send people to surrender to Cao Cao, and send Cao Cao's generals to attack Jizhou, but they will still be rescued. The general will lead his troops to attack him, but he can still be captured. If Cao defeats the Shang army, I will therefore hold back his army and refuse Cao. If the Cao army is far away, the food will not continue, so I will retreat; I can still hold on to Jizhou, in order to make progress.""","As a result Yuan Tan is easily drawn into conspiracy with Cao Cao. Yuan Tan is now seeking counsel from his father’s adviser, Guo Tu. He recommends inviting his brother Yuan Shang to a banquet. ‘ Launch your men at his while the feast is going on and kill him!’ advises Guo Tu. Against this advice stand others who point out that brothers are like the two arms of a body. ‘If you are fighting someone else, you don’t cut off one of your arms, now, do you!’ But when Yuan Shang turns up for the banquet it is with fifty thousand men. Realizing his plot has been discovered, Yuan Tan rides out to fight his brother. He is beaten and flees for sanctuary to Pingyuan. Despite gathering more troops to him and attacking his brother once more, Yuan Tan is again defeated and retreats back to Pingyuan. It is at this point that Guo Tu advises him to formally approach Cao Cao for help. This is readily accepted. Cao Cao has realized that the north, the land ruled by the Yuans, is ripe for conquest.","The two brothers Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang congratulated each other on the withdrawal of their enemy, and their brother Yuan Xi and their cousin Gao Gan marched their armies back to their own districts. Then the quarrels began. Yuan Tan said to his confidants Guo Tu and Xin Ping, “I, the eldest, have been prevented from succeeding my father, while the youngest son, born of a second wife, received the main heritage. My heart is bitter.” Said Guo Tu, “Camp your army outside, invite your brother and Shen Pei to a banquet, and assassinate them. The whole matter is easily settled.” And Yuan Tan agreed. It happened that Adviser Wang Xiu came just then from Qingzhou whom Yuan Tan took into his confidence. Wang Xiu opposed the murder plan, saying, “Brothers are as one's limbs. How can you possibly succeed if at a moment of conflict with an enemy you cut off one of your hands? If you abandon your brother and sever relationship, whom will you take in all the world as a relation? That fellow Guo Tu is a dangerous mischief-maker, who would sow dissension between brothers for a momentary advantage, and I beg you to shut your ears and not listen to his persuasions.” This was displeasing to Yuan Tan, and he angrily dismissed Wang Xiu, while he sent the treacherous invitation to his brother. Yuan Shang and Shen Pei talked over the matter. Shen Pei said, “I recognize one of Guo Tu's stratagems and if you go, my lord, you will be the victim of their plot. Rather strike at them at once.” Whereupon Yuan Shang rode out to battle. His brother Yuan Tan, seeing him come with fifty thousand troops, knew that his treachery had been discovered, so he also took the field. When the forces were near enough, Yuan Tan opened on Yuan Shang with a volley of abuse. “You poisoned my father and usurped the succession; now you come out to slay your elder brother?” The battle went against Yuan Tan. Yuan Shang himself took part in the fight, risking the arrows and the stones. He urged on his troops and drove his brother off the field. Yuan Tan took refuge in Pingyuan. Yuan Shang drew off his army to his own city. Yuan Tan and Guo Tu decided upon a new attack, and this time they chose General Cen Bi as Leader of the Van. Yuan Shang went to meet him. When both sides had been arrayed and the banners were flying and the drums beating, Cen Bi rode out to challenge and railed at his opponent. At first Yuan Shang was going to answer the challenge himself, but Lu Kuang had advanced. Lu Kuang and Cen Bi met but had fought only a few bouts when Cen Bi fell. Yuan Tan's soldiers were once more defeated and ran away to Pingyuan. Shen Pei urged his master to press for the advantage, and Yuan Tan was driven into the city, where he fortified himself and would not go out. So the city was besieged on three sides. Yuan Tan asked his strategist what should be done next, and Guo Tu said, “The city is short of food, the enemy is flushed with victory, and we cannot stand against them. My idea is to send some one to offer surrender to Cao Cao and thus get him to attack Jizhou. Your brother will be forced to return thither, which will leave you free to join in the attack. We may capture Yuan Shang. Should Cao Cao begin to get the better of your brother's army, we will lend our force to help Yuan Shang against Cao Cao; and as Cao Cao's base of supply is distant, we shall drive him off. And we can seize on Jizhou and begin our great design.”"

孫乾見紹不肯發兵，只得星夜回小沛見玄德，具說此事。玄德大驚曰：“似此如之奈何？”張飛曰：“兄長勿憂：曹兵遠來，必然困乏；乘其初至，先去劫寨，可破曹操。”玄德曰：“素以汝為一勇夫耳：前者捉劉岱時，頗能用計；今獻此策，亦中兵法。”乃從其言，分兵劫寨。,"Sun Qian saw that Shao was unwilling to send troops, so Xingye returned to Xiaopei to see Xuande and talked about it. Xuande was startled and said, ""What can I do?"" Zhang Fei said, ""Brother, don't worry: if Cao's troops come from afar, they will definitely be tired; take advantage of their first arrival and go to Jiezhai first, so that Cao Cao can be defeated."" Xuande said, """" I have always regarded you as a brave man: when the former captured Liu Dai, he was quite able to use tactics; this strategy is also in the art of warfare."" He followed his words and divided his troops to rob the village.","He has to tell Xuande that no help is on its way. This news profoundly alarms Xuande. Then to his and everyone else’s surprise it is Zhang Fei who comes up with a plan. Zhang Fei – better known for just fighting, not planning! His proposal is to attack Cao Cao’s troops at night as soon as they arrive.","Sun Qian saw that no help could be hoped for and set out to return. When he had arrived and related what he had seen, Liu Bei was quite alarmed and asked what could be done. “Do not be troubled, Brother,” said Zhang Fei. “We can destroy Cao Cao merely by a sudden attack before his army shall have time to camp.” “That would be according to the rules of war,” said Liu Bei. “You have always been a bold warrior, and that move against Liu Dai shows that you are becoming a strategist too.” So Liu Bei gave Zhang Fei command of enough soldiers to carry out this plan."

Cao desires to help the society and crops, but has insufficient hatred. Gong is a loyal and righteous man, and dares to ask for help. Wei Hong said: ""I have been in this for a long time, and I hate not meeting the hero's ears. Mengmeng has great ambitions and is willing to help his family."" A white flag for recruiting troops was erected, and the word ""loyalty"" was written on it. In a few days, the applicants gathered like rain.","At last he arrives at his father’s house. He asks his father to raise funds to hire troops. His father lacks the wherewithal, but a local notable is persuaded to raise the money. Sending out a fake edict claiming to come from the emperor, Cao Cao soon has a growing army of volunteers. He gathers them together under a white banner emblazoned with the two words ‘Loyalty’ and ‘Integrity’.","A feast was prepared and Wei Hong was invited. Cao Cao made him a speech: “ The Hans have lost their lordship, and Dong Zhuo is really a tyrant. He flouts his prince and is cruel to the people, who gnash their teeth with rage. I would restore the Hans, but my means are insufficient. Sir, I appeal to your loyalty and public spirit.” Wei Hong replied, “I have long desired this but, so far, have not found a person fit to undertake the task. Since you, Cao Cao, have so noble a desire, I willingly devote all my property to the cause.” This was joyful news, and the call to arms was forthwith prepared and sent far and near. So they established a corps of volunteers and set up a large white recruiting banner with the words “Loyalty and Honor"" inscribed thereon. The response was rapid, and volunteers came in like rain drops in number."
九月朔，請帝陞嘉德殿，大會文武。卓拔劍在手，對衆曰：“天子闇弱，不足以君天下。今有策文一道，宜為宣讀。”乃令李儒讀策曰：,"In September, I invite the emperor to ascend to the Jiade Hall and have a civil and military conference. With his sword in hand, Zhuo said to the crowd, ""The Son of Heaven is too weak to rule the world. Today there is a policy text, which should be read out."" He then ordered Li Ru to read the policy and said:","This he does. In late summer of AD 1893 in the Hall of Worthy Virtue, in the presence of the fifteen-year-old Emperor Shao, Dong Zhuo unveils his plan. With his sword in his hand, Dong Zhuo addresses the greatest and most powerful men in the land. ‘This Son of Heaven is weak and untrustworthy and is not worthy to reign over those of us who live under Heaven,’ he declares. ‘Today I have ordered a proclamation to be published and announced concerning the future.’ Li Ru then reads out the proclamation.","On the first day of the ninth month, the Emperor was invited to proceed to the Hall of Virtue where was a great assembly of officials.

雲長將胄頭去迎玄德，具言車胄欲害之事，今已斬首。玄德大驚曰：“曹操若來，如之奈何？”雲長曰：“弟與張飛迎之。”玄德懊悔不已，遂入徐州。百姓父老，伏道而接。玄德到府，尋張飛，飛已將車胄全家殺盡。玄德曰：“殺了曹操心腹之人，如何肯休？”陳登曰：“某有一計，可退曹操。”正是：,"Chang Yun sent his head to greet Xuande, saying that the car was going to kill him, and now he has been beheaded. Xuande was shocked and said, ""If Cao Cao comes, what will happen to him?"" Yun Chang said, ""My brother and Zhang Fei will welcome him."" Xuande was deeply remorseful and entered Xuzhou. The people, the elders, bowed to the road. Xuande arrived at the mansion and looked for Zhang Fei, who had already killed the entire Chexu family. Xuande said: ""If you kill Cao Cao's confidant, how can you be willing to quit?"" Chen Deng said, ""Someone has a plan to retreat from Cao Cao."" It was exactly:","He orders the governor of Xuzhou, Che Zhou, to conspire against Xuande and to trap him in an ambush as Xuande returns to his city. Forewarned, Xuande and his two brothers spring their own trap, and in the ensuing mêlée Che Zhou is slain by a ferocious and furious Guan Yu. After the brothers have gained entry to Xuzhou, Zhang Fei, angry at what he sees as the betrayal by Che Zhou, slays the whole of Che Zhou’s family. This impetuous act of Zhang Fei deeply alarms Xuande. He knows that Cao Cao will seek revenge for these actions against his governor. At this point Chen Deng comes forward with another of his plans.","They threw aside their spears and gave in. As soon as the excitement had calmed, Guan Yu took the head to show Liu Bei and told him the story of the plot. “But what will Cao Cao think of this?” said Liu Bei. “And he may come.” “If he does, we can meet him,” said Guan Yu. But Liu Bei was grieved beyond measure. When he entered the city, the elders of the people knelt in the road to welcome him. When he reached his residence, he found that Zhang Fei had already exterminated the family of Che Zhou. Liu Bei said, “We have slain one of Cao Cao's best officers, and how will he stand that?”"

至來年春，孫權商議欲伐黃祖。張昭曰：“居喪未及期年，不可動兵。”周瑜曰：“報讎雪恨，何待期年？”權猶豫未決。適平北都尉呂蒙入見，告權曰：“某把龍湫水口，忽有黃祖部將甘寧來降。某細詢之——寧字興霸，巴郡臨江人也；頗通書史，有氣力，好游俠；嘗招合亡命，縱橫於江湖之中；腰懸銅鈴，人聽鈴聲，盡皆避之。又嘗以西川錦作帆幔，時人皆稱為‘錦帆賊’。後悔前非，改行從善，引衆投劉表。見表不能成事，卽欲來投東吳，却被黃祖留住在夏口。前東吳破祖時，祖得甘寧之力，救回夏口；乃待寧甚薄。都督蘇飛屢薦寧於祖。祖曰：‘寧乃劫江之賊，豈可重用？’寧因此懷恨。蘇飛知其意，乃置酒邀寧到家，謂之曰：‘吾薦公數次，奈主公不能用。日月逾邁，人生幾何；宜自遠圖。吾當保公為邾縣長，自作去就之計。’寧因此得過夏口，欲投江東，恐江東恨其救黃祖殺凌操之事。某具言主公求賢若渴，不記舊恨；況各為其主，又何恨焉？寧欣然引衆渡江，來見主公。乞鈞旨定奪。”孫權大喜曰：“吾得興霸，破黃祖必矣。”遂命呂蒙引甘寧入見。參拜已畢，權曰：“興霸來此，大獲我心，豈有記恨之理？請無懷疑。願敎我以黃祖之策。”寧曰：“今漢祚日危，曹操終必篡竊。南荊之地，操所必爭也。劉表無遠慮，其子又愚劣，不能承業傳基，明公宜早圖之；若遲，則操先圖之矣。今宜先取黃祖。祖今年老昏邁，務於貨利；侵求吏民，人心皆怨；戰具不修，軍無法律。明公若往攻之，其勢必破。旣破祖軍，鼓行而西，據楚關而圖巴、蜀，霸業可定也。”孫權曰：“此金玉之論也！”,"In the spring of the following year, Sun Quan discussed his desire to attack Huang Zu. Zhang Zhao said, ""You cannot move troops before the due date for the funeral."" Zhou Yu said, ""Why do you wait for the due date?"" Quan hesitated. Lü Meng, the commander of Shiping North, came to see him and told Quan, ""Someone is at the mouth of Longqiu Shui, and suddenly Gan Ning, a general of Huang Zu's army, came to surrender. A certain person inquired about him - Ning Xingba, a native of Linjiang, Ba County; he is quite familiar with the history of books. He has strength and is a good ranger; he tried to make a desperate move, and he was in the rivers and lakes; he hung a copper bell on his waist, and people listened to the bell, and everyone avoided it. He also tasted the use of Xichuan Jin as a sail curtain, and people were called 'Jinfan Thief' at that time. He regretted his past mistakes, changed his career to be good, and led the crowd to vote for Liu Biao. Seeing the table, he couldn't do anything, so he wanted to vote for Soochow, but was kept in Xiakou by Huang Zu. When the former Soochow broke the ancestor, the ancestor gained the power of Gan Ning Rescue Xiakou; treat Ning very poorly. Governor Su Fei repeatedly recommended Ning Yuzu. Zu said: 'Ning is a thief who robbed the river, how can it be reused?' , said: 'I recommended the public several times, but the lord Nai can't use it. The sun and the moon are overstepping, the life is geometric; I want to go to Jiangdong, for fear that Jiangdong will hate him for saving Huang Zu and killing Ling Cao. A certain saying that the master is thirsty for talents, and does not remember the old hatred; , come to see the lord. I beg Jun to decide."" Sun Quan was overjoyed and said, ""I will be able to prosper, and I will destroy Huangzu."" He then ordered Lü Meng to lead Gan Ning to see him. After the pilgrimage was over, Quan said: ""Xingba came here and won my heart, how can there be any reason to hold grudges? Please have no doubts. Please teach me the strategy of Huang Zu."" Ning said: ""The Han Zuo is in danger today, and Cao Cao will eventually usurp it. Steal. In the land of Nanjing, it is necessary to fight for it. Liu Biao has no foresight, and his son is stupid and inferior, and he cannot inherit the foundation. Ming Gong should plan it early; This year, the ancestor is old and dizzy, and he is devoted to goods and interests; he invades and seeks the officials and the people, and the hearts of the people are full of resentment; if the weapons are not repaired, the army has no laws. According to Chuguan and Tuba and Shu, the hegemony can be settled."" Sun Quan said: ""This is the theory of gold and jade!""","Sun Quan’s first objective is to avenge his father by attacking Huang Zu, whose warfare led to Sun Jian’s death.","The following year they began to discuss an attack upon Huang Zu. Zhang Zhao said, “The armies should not move during the period of mourning.” However, Zhou Yu, more to the point, said, “Vengeance should not be postponed on that account; it could not wait upon times and seasons.” Still Sun Quan halted between two opinions and would not decide. Then came Commander Lu Meng who said to his master, “While I was at Dragon Gorge, one leader of Huang Zu, Gan Ning from Lingjiang, offered to surrender. I found out all about him. He is something of a scholar, is forceful, fond of wandering about as a knight-errant. He assembled a band of outlaws with whom he roamed over the rivers and lakes where he would terrorize everybody. He wore a bell at his waist, and at the sound of this bell every one fled and hid. He fitted his boats with sails of Xichuan brocade, and people called him the 'Pirate with Sails of Silk.' “Then he reformed. He and his band went to Liu Biao, but they left him when they saw he would never accomplish anything, and now they would serve under your banner, only that Huang Zu detains them at Xiakou. Formerly when you were attacking Huang Zu, he owed the recovery of Xiakou to this same Gan Ning, whom he treated without liberality. When Commander Su Fei recommended Gan Ning for promotion, Huang Zu said, 'he is unsuited for any high position as, after all, he is no more than a pirate.' “So Gan Ning became a disappointed and resentful man. Su Fei tried to win him over to good humor and invited him to wine parties and said, 'I have put your name forward many times, but our chief says he has no place suitable for you. However, time slips away and man's life is not very long. One must make the most of it. I will put you forward for the magistracy of Exian, whence you may be able to advance.' “So Gan Ning got away from Xiakou and would have come to you then, but he feared that he would not be welcomed, since he had assisted Huang Zu and killed Ling Cao. I told him you were always ready to welcome able people and would nourish no resentment for former deeds. After all, every person was bound to do his best for his master. He would come with alacrity if he only felt sure of a welcome. I pray you express your pleasure.” This was good news for Sun Quan and he said, “With his help I could destroy Huang Zu.” Then Sun Quan bade Lu Meng bring Gan Ning to see him. When the salutations were over, the chief said, “My heart is entirely captivated by your coming; I feel no resentment against you. I hope you will have no doubts on that score, and I may as well tell you that I desire some plan for the destruction of Huang Zu.” Gan Ning replied, “The dynasty is decadent and without influence. Cao Cao will finally absorb the country down to the river unless he is opposed. Liu Biao provides nothing against the future, and his sons are quite unfitted to succeed him. You should lay your plans to oust him at once before Cao Cao anticipates you. The first attack should be made on Huang Zu, who is getting old and avaricious, so that every one hates him. He is totally unprepared for a fight and his army is undisciplined. He would fall at the first blow. If he were gone, you would control the western passes and could conquer the lands of Ba and Shu [0 Lands of two ancient states in the empire.]}. And you would be securely established.” “The advice is most valuable,” said Sun Quan, and he made his preparations."

Cao pointed to Liao and said, ""This person is good-natured and good-natured."" Liao said, ""We met in Puyang City, how can I forget?"" Cao laughed and said, ""You remember!"" Liao said, ""It's just a pity!"" What?” Liao said, “It’s a pity that the fire wasn’t very big that day, and you were never burned to death as a traitor!” Cao was furious and said, “The defeated general An dares to humiliate me!” With his sword in hand, he came to kill Zhang Liao himself. Liaoquan was unafraid, waiting to be killed. One person behind Cao Cao climbed his arms, and the other knelt in front of him, saying, ""Prime Minister, don't do anything!"" It was exactly:","When Zhang Liao is brought before Cao Cao, Cao Cao recognizes him. Zhang Liao says that they met in battle at Puyang and that he regrets now that he did not kill him then. Furious at these words, Cao Cao raises his sword to kill Zhang Liao, but he is restrained by someone seizing his arm, while another kneels before him, pleading for Zhang Liao’s life. It is true to say that:","It was recorded earlier that the executioners were hustling Zhang Liao forward. Pointing to him from above, Cao Cao said, “He has a familiar face.” “You were not likely to forget me; you saw me before in Puyang,” said Zhang Liao. “O, so you remember me, eh?” “Yes; more is the pity.” “Pity for what?” “That the fire that day was not fierce enough to burn you up, rebel that you are.” Cao Cao began to get angry. “How dare you insult me?” cried he and lifted his sword to kill the bold speaker. The undaunted Zhang Liao never changed color, but stretched out his neck for the blow. Then a man behind Cao Cao caught his arm, and in front of him another dropped on his knees, saying, “O Prime Minister, I pray thee stay thy hand!” Lu Bu whining was not spared,"

Xuande said: ""I don't know whether my two brothers are alive or dead, and my wife and children are separated. What can I do?"" Sun Qian said: ""It's better to go to Cao Cao, to plan for the future."" When I ran out of food on the way, I tried to go to the village for food. But everywhere, upon hearing about Liu Yuzhou, they all scrambled to eat and drink. One day, when he was staying at a house, a young man from his family went out to worship and asked his name, it was the hunter Liu An. When Liu An heard that the shepherd from Yuzhou was coming, he wanted to find game for food, but he couldn't get it for a while, so he killed his wife to eat it. Xuande said, ""What kind of meat is this?"" An said, ""It's wolf meat."" Xuande had no doubts, but he ate a full meal and stayed overnight. When dawn was about to go, he went to the backyard to fetch a horse, and suddenly saw a woman slaughtered under the kitchen, and the flesh on her arm had been cut off. Xuande asked in astonishment, knowing that the person who ate last night was the meat of his wife. Xuande was very sad. Ride the horse with tears. Liu An told Xuande: ""I originally wanted to follow the envoy, but because my mother was in the hall, I didn't dare to travel far."" Xuande thanked him and left, and took his way out of Liangcheng. Suddenly seeing the dust head covering the sun, a large army came. Xuande knew that he was Cao Cao's army, and he went to the Central Army with Sun Qian, and met Cao Cao. Exercise is also under the tears. He also said that Liu An killed his wife for food, and Cao ordered Sun Qian to give him a hundred taels of gold.","Xuande and his companion Sun Qian seek shelter in a hunter’s home. The hunter is called Liu An, and he immediately offers to go and hunt for fresh meat for them to eat. To his distress, he cannot find any game. Desperate to keep his word, he kills his wife and serves up flesh from her body. When Xuande asks what meat they are eating, Liu An replies, ‘Wolf.’ It is only as they depart the next day that the two companions see the dead body of a young woman in the kitchen. The flesh from her arms has been cut away. This extraordinary action draws tears from Xuande when he realizes to what lengths Liu An has gone to keep his promise. Xuande joins up with Cao Cao.","As Liu Bei with his few horsemen was making the best of their way from the scene of his defeat, he heard some one coming up behind him. When he got closer the person proved to be Sun Qian. “Alas! I know not the fate of my brothers, whether they be alive or dead, and my wife and children are lost to me! What can I do?” said Liu Bei. Sun Qian replied, “I see nothing better than getting away to Cao Cao, whence we may be able to plan our future moves.” Liu Bei had no better plan to propose, and the two men directed their way to Xuchang, choosing by-roads rather than highways. When their small supplies ran out, they entered a village to beg. But when the people of any place heard that Liu Bei of Yuzhou was the man who needed help, they vied with each other in offering all that was required. One day they sought shelter at a house whence a youth came out and made a low obeisance. They asked his name and he gave it as Liu An, of a well known family of hunters. Hearing who the visitor was, the hunter wished to lay before him a dish of game, but though he sought for a long time, nothing could be found for the table. So Liu An came home, killed his wife and prepared a portion for his guest. While eating Liu Bei asked, “What flesh is it?” Liu An told him: “Wolf.” Liu Bei knew no better and ate his fill. Next day at daylight, just as Liu Bei was leaving, he went to the stables in the rear to get his horse and passing through the kitchen; he saw the dead body of a woman lying on the table. The flesh of one arm had been cut away. Quite startled he asked what this meant, and then he knew what he had eaten the night before. He was deeply sorry at this proof of his host's regard and the tears rained down as he mounted his steed at the gate. “I wish I could go with you,” said Liu An, “but as my mother still lives I cannot go so far from home.” Liu Bei thanked him and went his way. The party took the road by Liangcheng, and as they were going out they saw not far off a thick cloud of dust. When the troop came nearer, they found the troops were of Cao Cao's army, and with them they traveled to the main camp where they found Cao Cao himself. Cao Cao shed tears at the sad story of Liu Bei's distress, the loss of the city, his brothers and wives and children. When Liu Bei him of the hunter who had sacrificed his wife to feed them, Cao Cao sent the hunter a present of a hundred ounces of silver as a reward."

Xuande sighed and said: ""All the monarchs have the talent of the king's assistant, but unfortunately they follow Liu Bei. Bei's life is embarrassing, and it affects all the monarchs. Today, I have no standing cones, and I am afraid that I will make mistakes. ?"" Everyone covered their faces and cried. Yun Chang said: ""Brother's words are wrong: in the past, Gaozu and Xiang Yu competed for the world, and many were defeated by Yu; after the battle of Jiuli Mountain was successful, the foundation of the four hundred years of business was established. Victory and defeat are often used in military affairs, so how can you make your own ambition?""","Xuande has escaped after all. Resting, Xuande decides that he must speak openly and clearly to his men. ‘Dear friends. You all deserve to be the confidants of a mighty ruler. But following me you’ve ended up here with nothing but sadness. I’ve nothing. Not even this bit of land where I stand today. You’ve been misled by me. Go. Go and find a better, more worthy lord to serve.’ His men do not know where to look, they are so embarrassed and saddened. ‘Brother,’ says Guan Yu, ‘don’t speak like this. Remember how the founder of the Han lost battle after battle. But in the end he won and founded a dynasty which has lasted four hundred years. Defeats – victories – these are the natural course of warfare. Don’t let this bring you down.’","When Liu Bei collected his army, he found they numbered only a thousand, and this halting and broken force marched as fast as possible to the west. Coming to a river they asked the natives its name and were told it was the Han River, and near it Liu Bei made a temporary camp. When the local people found out who was in the camp, they presented flesh and wine. A feast was given upon a sandy bank of the Han River. After they had drunk awhile, Liu Bei addressed his faithful followers, saying, “All you, Fair Sirs, have talents fitting you to be advisers to a monarch, but your destiny has led you to follow poor me. My fate is distressful and full of misery. Today I have not a spot to call my own, and I am indeed leading you astray. Therefore I say you should abandon me and go to some illustrious lord where you may be able to become famous.” At these words they all covered their faces and wept. Guan Yu said, “Brother, you are wrong to speak thus. When the great Founder of Han contended with Xiang Yu, he was defeated many times, but he won at the Nine-Mile Mountains and that achievement was the foundation of a dynasty that endured for four centuries. Victory and defeat are but ordinary events in a soldier's career, and why should you give up?”"
童子便引玄德。行二里餘，到莊前下馬，入至中門。忽聞琴聲甚美。玄德敎童子且休通報，側耳聽之，琴聲忽住而不彈。一人笑而出曰：“琴韻淸幽，音中忽起高抗之調，必有英雄竊聽。”童子指謂玄德曰：“此卽吾師水鏡先生也。”玄德視其人：松形鶴骨，器宇不凡。慌忙進前施禮——衣襟尚濕。水鏡曰：“公今日幸免大難！”玄德驚訝不已。小童曰：“此劉玄德也。”水鏡請入草堂，分賓主坐定。玄德見架上滿堆書卷，窗外盛栽松竹，橫琴於石牀之上，淸氣飄然。水鏡問曰：“明公何來？”玄德曰：“偶爾經由此地，因小童相指，得拜尊顏，不勝欣幸。”水鏡笑曰：“公不必隱諱。公今必逃難至此。”玄德遂以襄陽一事告之。水鏡曰：“吾觀公氣色，已知之矣。”因問玄德曰：“吾久聞明公大名，何故至今猶落魄不偶耶？”玄德曰：“命途多蹇，所以至此。”水鏡曰：“不然：蓋因將軍左右不得其人耳。”玄德曰：“備雖不才，文有孫乾、糜竺、簡雍之輩，武有關、張、趙雲之流，竭忠輔相，頗賴其力。”水鏡曰：“關、張、趙雲，皆萬人敵，惜無善用之人。若孫乾、糜竺輩，乃白面書生，非經綸濟世之才也。”玄德曰：“備亦嘗側身以求山谷之遺賢，奈未遇其人何！”水鏡曰：“豈不聞孔子云：‘十室之邑，必有忠信。’何謂無人？”玄德曰：“備愚昧不識，願賜指敎。”水鏡曰：“公聞荊襄諸郡小兒謠言乎？其謠曰：‘八九年間始欲衰，至十三年無孑遺。到頭天命有所歸，泥中蟠龍向天飛。’此謠始於建安初：建安八年，劉景升喪却前妻，便生家亂，此所謂‘始欲衰’也；‘無孑遺’者，不久則景升將逝，文武零落無孑遺矣；‘天命有歸’，‘龍向天飛’，蓋應在將軍也。”玄德聞言驚謝曰：“備安敢當此！”水鏡曰：“今天下之奇才，盡在於此，公當往求之。”玄德急問曰：“奇才安在？果係何人？”水鏡曰：“伏龍、鳳雛，兩人得一，可安天下。”玄德曰：“伏龍、鳳雛何人也？”水鏡撫掌大笑曰：“好！好！”玄德再問時，水鏡曰：“天色已晚，將軍可於此暫宿一宵，明日當言之。”卽命小童具飲饌相待，馬牽入後院餵養。,"The boy will lead Xuande. After walking for more than two li, dismount before the village and enter the middle gate. Suddenly heard the sound of the piano is very beautiful. Xuande instructed the boy to stop the announcement, and listened to it, but the sound of the qin suddenly stopped and did not play. One person laughed and said, ""The rhythm of the piano is quiet, and the tone of high resistance suddenly rises in the sound. There must be a hero eavesdropping."" The boy pointed to Xuande and said, ""This is my teacher, Mr. Shuijing."" Xuande looked at him: Loose-shaped crane bones, extraordinary equipment. Hastily stepped forward to give salute - the front of the clothes is still wet. Shui Jing said, ""Your Excellency survived the catastrophe today!"" Xuande was astonished. The little boy said, ""This is Liu Xuande."" Shuijing invited him into the cottage, where the guests and the host were seated. Xuande saw that the shelf was full of books, the pine and bamboo were planted outside the window, and the Hengqin was on the stone bed, and he was in a breath. Shuijing asked, ""Where did Duke Ming come from?"" Xuande said, ""Occasionally passing through this place, because the children pointed at each other, I was very happy to be honored."" Xuande then reported the incident in Xiangyang. Shuijing said, ""I know the look of Duke Ming."" Because he asked Xuande, ""I have heard the name of Duke Ming for a long time, so why is it that I am still down and out?"" Xuande said: ""There are many life paths, so this is the end."" Shui Jing said. Said: ""Otherwise: General Geyin can't be heard."" Xuande said, ""Although the preparation is not talented, there are people of Sun Qian, Mi Zhu, Jian Yong, Wu Guan, Zhang, Zhao Yun, etc., who are loyal and support each other. Rely on their strength."" Shui Jing said: ""Guan, Zhang, and Zhao Yun are all enemies of ten thousand people, but there are no people who can make good use of them. If Sun Qian and Mi Zhu are born, they are white-faced scholars, and they are not talents who are economical and economical."" Xuande said: ""Prepare I also tried to look sideways to seek the sages of the valley, but I never met them!"" Shui Jing said: ""Don't you hear Confucius said: 'In the town of ten houses, there must be loyalty.' What does it mean to have no one?"" Knowledge, I would like to give you guidance."" Shui Jing said: ""Have you heard the rumors of children in the counties of Jingxiang? The rumor said: 'It began to decline in 1989, and in thirteen years there was no leftover. In the end, the destiny has returned, and the mud The dragon flew to the sky.' This rumor began at the beginning of Jian'an: in the eighth year of Jian'an, Liu Jingsheng lost his ex-wife, and the family was in chaos. This is the so-called 'beginning to decline'; The civil and military are scattered and no one is left; 'The destiny has a return', 'the dragon flies to the sky', and it should be the general."" Xuande heard the words and said: ""Bei An dare to be this!"" Shui Jing said: ""Today's genius, That's all there is to it, and you should go and ask for it."" Xuande asked anxiously, ""Where is the genius? Who is it?"" Shui Jing said, ""Fulong and Fengchu, if the two of them have one, the world will be safe."" Xuande said: ""Who are Fulong and Fengchu?"" Shuijing smiled and said, ""Okay! Good!"" When Xuande asked again, Shuijing said: ""It's getting late, the general can stay here for the night, and I will talk about it tomorrow."" You ordered children to drink and treat each other, and horses were brought into the backyard to feed.","Xuande is astonished when Master Tranquil Water mentions that Xuande has just had a lucky escape and invites the weary Xuande inside. What a place of tranquillity! Inspired and at ease, Xuande pours out his troubles to the master. ‘Your problem,’ says the master, ‘is that you’ve yet to find the right kind of men to help you.’ To this Xuande replies, ‘I do appreciate that I’m far from worthy, but I’ve lots of good men to help me. Men like Sun Qian, Mi Zhu, Jian Yong and soldiers like Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Zilong. These are all good men.’ ‘Very true,’ Master Tranquil Water replies. ‘These are indeed fine warriors, but you have no one who can help you make best use of them. And the bureaucrats that surround you are useless, incapable of dealing with the sheer complexity of modern life in these difficult times.’ ‘I do realize I need a more worthy person to assist me, but so far I have had no luck in finding one,’ replies Xuande. ‘Do not forget what Kong Fu Zi says,’ comments the master, ‘that even in a hamlet of just ten households you’ll still manage to find one person who is loyal. Don’t give up hope. Heaven’s Mandate is given when the time is right, and the dragon trapped in mud is able to soar to Heaven again. That’s you, general.’ ‘Can I even think of such a thing?’ asks a troubled Xuande. To which the master replies that in this region there are the greatest experts to be found anywhere in the country and that Xuande should go searching for them. ‘But where do I go to find them?’ asks a perplexed Xuande. The master replies, ‘They are called Hidden Dragon and Youthful Phoenix, and either of them could help you to run the country and re-establish peace.’ Xuande, still troubled, asks again, ‘But where can I find them, and who exactly are they?’ ‘Excellent, very good indeed,’ replies the master to the total confusion of Xuande. ‘We can discuss this further in the morning,’ he continues, and with that they all retire for the night. Late that night, Xuande awakes, disturbed by the sound of a visitor to the master.","The cowherd led the way for about one mile, when Liu Bei found himself in front of a farm house. He dismounted and went to the center door. Suddenly came to his ear the sound of a lute most skillfully played and the air was extremely beautiful. He stopped his guide and would not allow him to announce a visitor, but stood there rapt by the melody. Suddenly the music ceased. He heard a deep laugh and a man appeared, saying, “Amidst the clear and subtle sounds of the lute, there suddenly rang out a high note as though some noble man was near.” “That is my master,” said the lad pointing. Liu Bei saw before him a tall figure, slender and straight as a pine tree, a very “chosen vessel.” Hastening forward he saluted. The skirt of his robe was still wet from the river. “You have escaped from a grave danger today, Sir,” said Water-Mirror. Liu Bei was startled into silence, and the cowherd said to his master, “This is Liu Bei.” Water-Mirror asked him to enter; and when they were seated in their relative positions as host and guest, Liu Bei glanced round the room. Upon the bookshelves were piled books and manuscripts. The window opened upon an exquisite picture of pines and bamboos and a lute lay upon a stone couch. The room showed refinement in its last degree. “Whence come you, Illustrious Sir?” asked the host. “By chance I was passing this way and the lad pointed you out to me. So I came to bow in your honored presence. I cannot tell what pleasure it gives me.” Water-Mirror laughed, saying, “Why this mystery? Why must you conceal the truth? You have certainly just escaped from a grave danger.” Then Liu Bei told the story of the banquet and the flight. “I knew it all from your appearance,” said his host. “Your name has long been familiar, but whence comes it that, up to the present, you are only a homeless devil?” “I have suffered many a check during my life,” said Liu Bei, “and through one of them am I here now.” “It should not be so; but the reason is that you still lack the one person to aid you.” “I am simple enough in myself, I know; but I have Sun Qian, Mi Zhu, and Jian Yong on the civil side, and for warriors I have Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Yun. These are all most loyal helpers, and I depend upon them not a little.” “Your fighting generals are good: fit to oppose a legion. The pity is you have no really able adviser. Your civilians are but pallid students of books, not humans fitted to weave and control destiny.” “I have always yearned to find one of those marvelous recluses who live among the hills till their day arrive. So far I have sought in vain.” “You know what the Teacher Confucius said, 'In a hamlet of ten households there must be one true human.' Can you say there is no one?” “I am simple and uninstructed; I pray you enlighten me.” “You have heard what the street children sing: “In eight and nine years begins decay, Four years, then comes the fateful day, When destiny will show the way, And the dragon flies out of the mire! “This song was first heard when the new reign style was adopted. The first line was fulfilled when Imperial Protector Liu Biao lost his first wife, and when his family troubles began. The next line relates to the approaching death of Liu Biao and there is not a single person among all his crowd of officers who has the least ability. The last two lines will be fulfilled in you, General.” Liu Bei started up in surprise, crying, “How could such a thing be?” Water-Mirror continued, “At this moment the marvelously clever ones of the earth are all here and you, Sir, ought to seek them.” “Where are they? Who are they?” said Liu Bei quickly. “If you could find either Sleeping-Dragon or Blooming-Phoenix, you could restore order in the empire.” “But who are these two?” His host clapped his hands, smiled and said, “Good; very good!” When Liu Bei persisted and pressed home his questions, Water-Mirror said, “It is getting late. You might stay the night here, General, and we will talk over these things tomorrow.” He called to a lad to bring wine and food for his guest and his horse was taken to the stable and fed."
三人鬱鬱不樂，上街閒行，正值郎中張鈞車到。玄德見之，自陳功績。鈞大驚，隨入朝見帝曰：“昔黃巾造反，其原皆由十常侍賣官鬻爵，非親不用，非讎不誅，以致天下大亂。今宜斬十常侍，懸首南郊，遣使者布告天下，有功者重加賞賜，則四海自淸平也。”十常侍奏帝曰：“張鈞欺主。”帝令武士逐出張鈞。十常侍共議：“此必破黃巾有功者，不得除授，故生怨言。權且敎省家銓注微名，待後却再理會未晚。”因此玄德除授定州中山府安喜縣尉，尅日赴任。玄德將兵散回鄕里，止帶親隨二十餘人，與關、張來安喜縣中到任。署縣事一月，與民秋毫無犯，民皆感化。到任之後，與關、張食則同桌，寢則同牀。如玄德在稠人廣坐，關、張侍立，終日不倦。,"The three of them were unhappy and walked on the street, just in time for the arrival of Zhang Jun's car. Xuande sees it, and self-reports his achievements. Jun was greatly shocked, and went to the court to meet the emperor and said: ""In the past, the Yellow Turban rebellions were originally sold by the ten permanent servants to sell the officials and vassals. They were not used by relatives, and they were not punished, so the world was in chaos. Now it is advisable to kill the ten permanent servants and hang their heads in the southern suburbs. The messenger announces to the world that those who have meritorious deeds will be rewarded again, and the world will be leveled."" The Shi Chang attendants said to the emperor, ""Zhang Jun deceived the master."" The emperor ordered the warriors to expel Zhang Jun. The ten permanent attendants discussed together: ""Those who have made meritorious deeds for breaking the yellow turban must not be removed from the grant, so there will be complaints. The right to teach the provincial family's personal name, but it will not be too late to ignore it later."" Therefore, Xuande removed the grant from Anxi, Zhongshan House, Dingzhou. County lieutenant, soon to take office. Xuande scattered the troops back to Yanli, and only brought more than 20 people with him, and took office in Anxi County with Guan and Zhang Lai. In the first month of the county's affairs, there was no offense with the people in autumn, and the people were all influenced. After taking office, he shared the same table with Guan and Zhang Shi, and shared the same bed when sleeping. For example, Xuande sat in the crowds of Chou, and stood at Guan and Zhang, and was tireless all day long.","He becomes very disillusioned by this treatment. One day the three brothers are wandering around the capital when an official notices them and asks who they are. Xuande tells him about his victories, and how he hasn’t been given any reward. The official asks permission to see the emperor and points out that, due to the interference of the Ten Eunuchs who control the court, only their cronies are being appointed, and good men are ignored. This is the reason why rebellion is rife. ‘Cut the eunuchs’ heads off and expose them on the gates,’ the official advises the emperor. But the eunuchs outmanoeuvre him, and he is expelled from the court. However, this does alert the eunuchs to the dangers of bypassing worthy men, and in the ensuing rash of minor appointments, Xuande is made the magistrate of Anxi County. His two brothers-in-arms accompany him and join him in his duties and responsibilities. Xuande’s justice is so honest and forthright that, within just one month, crime has ceased.","But Liu Bei, in spite of Zhu Jun's memorial, waited in vain for preferment, and the three brothers became very sad. Walking along one day in the capital, Liu Bei met a court official, Zhang Jun, to whom he related his services and told his sorrows. Zhang Jun was much surprised at this neglect and one day at court spoke to the Emperor about it. Said he, “The Yellow Scarves rebelled because the eunuchs sold offices and bartered ranks. There was employment only for their friends, punishment only for their enemies. This led to rebellion. Wherefore it would be well to slay the Ten Eunuchs and expose their heads and proclaim what had been done throughout the whole empire. Then reward the worthy. Thereby the land would be wholly tranquil.” But the eunuchs fiercely opposed this and said Zhang Jun was insulting the Emperor, and the Emperor bade the guards thrust Zhang Jun out. However, the eunuchs took counsel together and one said, “Surely some one who rendered some service against rebels resents being passed over.” So they caused a list of unimportant people to be prepared for preferment by and by. Among them was Liu Bei, who received the post of magistrate of the county of Anxi, to which he proceeded without delay after disbanding his army and sending them home to their villages. He retained two dozens or so as escort. The three brothers reached Anxi, and soon the administration of the county was so reformed and the rule so wise that in a month there was no law-breaking. The three brothers lived in harmony, eating at the same table and sleeping on the same couch. But when Liu Bei was in public sessions or in company of others, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei would stand in attendance, were it even a whole day."

雲縱馬過橋，行二十餘里，見玄德與衆人憩於樹下。雲下馬伏地而泣。玄德亦泣。雲喘息而言曰：“趙雲之罪，萬死猶輕！糜夫人身帶重傷，不肯上馬，投井而死。雲只得推土牆掩之；懷抱公子，身突重圍；賴主公洪福，幸而得脫。適來公子尚在懷中啼哭，此一會不見動靜，多是不能保也。”遂解視之。原來阿斗正睡着未醒。雲喜曰：“幸得公子無恙！”雙手遞與玄德。玄德接過，擲之於地曰：“為汝這孺子，幾損我一員大將！”趙雲忙向地下抱起阿斗，泣拜曰：“雲雖肝腦塗地，不能報也！”後人有詩曰：,"Yun Zong's horse crossed the bridge and traveled for more than twenty li, and saw Xuande and everyone resting under the tree. Cloud dismounted and cried. Xuande also wept. Yun gasped and said: ""Zhao Yun's crime is as easy as death! Madam Mi was seriously injured and refused to mount her horse, so she threw herself into a well and died. Yun had to bulldoze the wall to cover him; Fortunately, I was able to escape. Young Master Shi Lai is still crying in his arms, and there will be no movement for a while, and most of them cannot be protected."" Then he dismissed it. It turned out that Adou was asleep. Yunxi said: ""Fortunately, the son is safe!"" He handed Xuande with both hands. Xuande took it, threw it on the ground, and said, ""For you, this child, how much damage to one of my generals!"" Zhao Yun hurriedly picked up A Dou to the ground, and wept and said, ""Although Yun's liver and brain are on the ground, it can't be repaid!"" The poem says:","So on Zilong rides until at long last he reaches Xuande. Weeping, he dismounts and bows before Xuande. ‘I’ve failed, and my punishment should be death,’ he gasps. ‘ Lady Mi was so badly wounded she was unable to ride and instead threw herself down a well. She died, and all I could manage was to quickly cover up the well by pushing over a ruined wall. So I placed the child here inside my breastplate and battled my way through the enemy. He must be a sacred and divinely protected child because through his grace I’ve made it through. I hope he is protected by the gods because he cried when we set out but I’ve heard nothing for a while and now am fearful that he didn’t make it through after all.’ So saying, Zilong opens his armour and to his delight discovers the child is fast asleep. ‘ Thank goodness your son is alright,’ he says as he hands the child to his father.","About seven miles from the bridge, Zhao Yun saw Liu Bei with his followers reposing in the shade of some trees. He dismounted and drew near, weeping. The tears also started to Liu Bei's eyes when he saw his faithful commander. Still panting from his exertions, Zhao Yun gasped out, “My fault—death is too light a punishment. Lady Mi was severely wounded; she refused my horse and threw herself into a well. She is dead, and all I could do was to fill in the well with the rubbish that lay around. But I placed the babe in the breast of my fighting robe and have won my way out of the press of battle. Thanks to the little lord's grand luck I have escaped. At first he cried a good deal, but for some time now he has not stirred or made a sound. I fear I may not have saved his life after all.” Then Zhao Yun opened his robe and looked; the child was fast asleep. “Happily, Sir, your son is unhurt,” said Zhao Yun as he drew him forth and presented him in both hands. Liu Bei took the child but threw it aside angrily, saying, “To preserve that suckling I very nearly lost a great commander!” Zhao Yun picked up the child again and, weeping, said, “Were I ground to powder, I could not prove my gratitude.” From out Cao Cao's host a tiger rushed, His wish but to destroy; Though Liu Bei's consort lost her life, Zhao Yun preserved her boy. “Too great the risk you ran to save This child,” the father cried."

Perhaps he would tell him: ""The generals of Jinzhou have rebelled, and now the prime minister has arrived, why not make a distinction, and set up a camp first?"" Yu Jin said: ""The bandits are chasing troops now, and they will come from time to time; if you don't prepare first, why not? Refusing the enemy? Distinguish the small matters, and retreating the enemy is a major matter."" After the camp was completed, Zhang Xiu's army attacked in two ways. Yu Jin went out to meet the enemy first. Embroidered emergency retreat. The generals on the left and right, seeing Yu Jin moving forward, each led troops to attack him. Embroidered forces were poor and alone, and led the defeated soldiers to join Liu Biao. Cao Cao took his army and appointed generals, and Yu Jin entered to see him, preparing to say that the soldiers of Suzhou were going to loot and loot, and they were greatly disappointed by the people, so he killed them for a reason. Cao said: ""If you don't tell me, why don't you go down to the fort first?"" Forbidden was right. Cao said: ""The general is in a hurry, he can assemble his troops and fortify his fortresses, and he can be slandered and worked hard to turn defeat into victory. Although he is a famous general in ancient times, why is Gazi!"" The military is not strict. A sacrifice was also set up for Wei, and Cao himself cried and offered it, and he said to the generals: ""I have lost my eldest son, and I love my concubine, and I have no deep pain; I cry alone for Wei."" Everyone sighed. The next day the class teacher was ordered.",Cao Cao regroups his men and realizes that they are still superior to the forces of Zhang Xiu. His men are ready when he attacks again.,"Now when Yu Jin saw his master and a great company approaching, he at once stopped the attack and set his troops to make a camp. An officer asked him, “The Qingzhou soldiers say you have turned traitor; why do you not explain now that the Prime Minister has arrived? Why first make a camp?” Yu Jin replied, “Our enemies are coming up in our rear and are very close. It is necessary to prepare for defense or we shall not withstand them. Explanation is a small matter, but defense is very important.” Soon after the camp was finished, Zhang Xiu fell upon them. Yu Jin himself rode out to face them. Zhang Xiu drew back. The other generals of Yu Jin, seeing he advance thus boldly, also attacked, and Zhang Xiu was overcome. They pursued him a great distance until his force was almost annihilated. With the miserable remnant he finally fled to Liu Biao. Cao Cao's army reformed, and the commanders mustered. Then Yu Jin went to see his master and told him of the conduct of the Qingzhou soldiers and their looting and why he had attacked them. “Why did you not tell me before you made the camp?” Yu Jin related what had occurred. Said Cao Cao, “When the first thought of a leader in the time of greatest stress is to maintain order and to strengthen his defenses, giving no thought to slander but shouldering his burdens bravely, and when he thereby turns a defeat into a victory, who, even of the ancient leaders, can excel Yu Jin?” Cao Cao rewarded Yu Jin with a golden armor and the lordship of Yishou. But Cao Cao reprimanded Xiahou Dun for the lack of discipline among his soldiers. Sacrifices in honor of the dead warrior Dian Wei were instituted. Cao Cao himself led the wailing and paid due honors. Turning to his officers he said, “I have lost my first born son, but I grieve not so heavily for him as for Dian Wei.

玄德請徐庶飲酒，庶曰：“今聞老母被囚，雖金波玉液不能下咽矣。”玄德曰：“備聞公將去，如失左右手，雖龍肝鳳髓，亦不甘味。”二人相對而泣，坐以待旦。諸將已於郭外安排筵席餞行。玄德與徐庶並馬出城，至長亭，下馬相辭。玄德舉盃謂徐庶曰：“備分淺緣薄，不能與先生相聚，望先生善事新主，以成功名。”庶泣曰：“某才微智淺，深荷使君重用。今不幸半途而別，實為老母故也。縱使曹操相逼，庶亦終身不設一謀。”玄德曰：“先生旣去，劉備亦將遠遁山林矣。”庶曰：“某所以與使君共圖王霸之業者，恃此方寸耳；今以老母之故，方寸亂矣；縱使在此，無益於事。使君宜別求高賢輔佐，共圖大業，何便灰心如此？”玄德曰：“天下高賢，無有出先生右者。”庶曰：“某樗櫟庸材，何敢當此重譽。”臨別，又顧謂諸將曰：“願諸公善事使君，以圖名垂竹帛，功標靑史，切勿效庶之無始終也。”諸將無不傷感。玄德不忍相離，送了一程，又送一程。庶辭曰：“不勞使君遠送，庶就此告別。”玄德就馬上執庶之手曰：“先生此去，天各一方，未知相會却在何日！”說罷，淚如雨下。庶亦涕泣而別。玄德立馬於林畔，看徐庶乘馬與從者匆匆而去。玄德哭曰：“元直去矣！吾將奈何？”凝淚而望，却被一樹林隔斷。玄德以鞭指曰：“吾欲盡伐此處樹木。”衆問何故。玄德曰：“因阻吾望徐元直之目也。”,"Xuande invited Xu Shu to drink, and Shu said: ""I heard that my mother is imprisoned, although the golden wave and jade liquid cannot be swallowed."" Xuande said: ""Be prepared to hear that the Duke is about to go, as if he lost his left and right hands, although the dragon, liver and phoenix marrow are still unwilling to taste. ."" The two wept at each other and sat waiting for the day. The generals have arranged a banquet outside Guo. Xuande and Xu Shu rode out of the city side by side to the long pavilion, where they dismounted and said goodbye. Xuande raised his glass to Xu Shu and said: ""The backup is shallow and the predestined relationship is weak, so I can't get together with the master. I hope that the master will do good deeds to the new master, and be famous for his success."" It’s because of my old mother that I left halfway. Even if Cao Cao is pressed against him, Shu will not set up a plan for the rest of his life.” Xuande said: “Sir, Liu Bei will also be far away from the mountains and forests.” Shu said: “So why is there with the envoy? If you want to pursue the career of king and hegemony together, you will rely on this square inch ear. Now, because of your old mother, the square inch is in chaos. Even if you are here, it will not help you. It is advisable for you to not ask for the help of high-ranking talents, and to pursue a great cause together, why should you be discouraged like this? Xuande said: ""There is no one who is outstanding in the world. There is no one who is right."" Shu said: ""A certain tree oak is mediocre, how dare you take such a high reputation."" Your Majesty, use the name of the picture to hang the bamboo and silk, and mark the history of the work, and don’t follow the example of the commoners.” The generals were all sad. Xuande couldn't bear to be apart, so he sent one ride and another ride. Shu Ci said: ""If you don't work, I will send you away, and the Shu will say goodbye."" Xuande immediately took the Shu's hand and said: ""Sir, we are going to different places in the sky, but we don't know when we will meet!"" After that, tears fell like rain. . Shu also cried and said goodbye. Xuande immediately stood by the forest, watching Xu Shu hurried away on his horse and his followers. Xuande cried and said, ""Yuanzhi is gone! What will I do?"" He looked at him with tears in his eyes, but was cut off by a forest. Xuande pointed his whip and said, ""I want to cut down all the trees here."" The crowd asked why. Xuande said, ""Because it prevents me from looking at Xu Yuanzhi's eyes.""","His real name is Xu Shu.’ ‘This Shan Fu. Is he any good – say, in comparison to you?’ asks Cao Cao. ‘Ten times better, frankly.’ Cao Cao then to decides to lure Shan Fu over to his side. ‘I know what we can do,’ says Cheng Yu. ‘ His mother, to whom he is devoted, lives all alone – she only has Shan Fu. Let’s bring her here and fool her into writing to Shan Fu to come and join her. So filial is he, he will come straight away!’ So Cao Cao has her brought to the capital and effectively placed under house arrest. She is fiery and scornful of Cao Cao, once even hitting him with an ink stone. He very nearly has her killed there and then, but Cheng Yu persuades him to spare her. ‘ She is just trying to be killed so that you become for ever a wicked man!’ he says. ‘Kill her, and her son will be your enemy for ever. Look after her, and he must come to see her soon.’ Swallowing his pride, Cao Cao pretends to dote on the old woman and by these means is able to secure a few examples of her handwriting. Then he has a letter forged and sent to Shan Fu. The letter claims to come from his distressed mother. The fake letter does the trick, for when Shan Fu reads the sad letter he immediately knows he has to leave Xuande and go to care for her. Xuande is in despair at the loss of his invaluable adviser. But because it is for good, filial reasons he can’t challenge it. Just before Shan Fu rides off he advises Xuande that there is someone ten times greater than he is, who could be Xuande’s adviser.","Liu Bei asked the parting guest to a banquet, but he declined, saying, “With my mother a prisoner I can swallow nothing, nay, though it were brewed from gold or distilled from jewels.” “Alas! Your departure is as if I lost both my hands,” said Liu Bei. “Even the liver of a dragon or the marrow of a phoenix would be bitter in my mouth.” They looked into each other's eyes and wept. They sat silent till dawn. When all was ready for the journey, the two rode out of the city side by side. At Daisy Pavilion they dismounted to drink the stirrup cup. Liu Bei lifted the goblet and said, “It is my mean fortune that separates me from you, but I hope that you may serve well your new lord and become famous.” Xu Shu wept as he replied , “I am but a poor ignorant person whom you have kindly employed. Unhappily I have to break our intercourse in the middle, but my venerable mother is the real cause. Though Cao Cao use all manner of means to coerce me, yet will I never plan for him.” “After you are gone, I shall only bury myself in the hills and hide in the forests,” said Liu Bei. Xu Shu said, “I had in my heart for you the position of leader of the chieftains, but my plans have been altogether upset by my mother. I have been of no advantage to you nor should I do any good by remaining. But you ought to seek some person of lofty wisdom to help you in your great enterprise. It is unseemly to be downcast.” “I shall find none to help better than you, my master.” “How can I permit such extravagant praise?” said Xu Shu. “I am only a useless blockhead.” As he moved off, he said to the followers, “Officers, I hope you will render the Princely One good service, whereby to write his name large in the country's annals and cause his fame to glow in the pages of history. Do not be like me, a person who has left his work half done.” They were all deeply affected. Liu Bei could not bring himself to part from his friend. He escorted him a little further, and yet a little further, till Xu Shu said, “I will not trouble you, O Princely One, to come further. Let us say our farewell here.” Liu Bei dismounted, took Xu Shu by the hands, and said, “Alas! We part. Each goes his way and who knows if we shall meet again?” His tears fell like rain and Xu Shu wept also. But the last goodbyes were said; and when the traveler had gone, Liu Bei stood gazing after the little party and watched it slowly disappear. At the last glimpse he broke into lamentation. “He is gone! What shall I do?” One of the trees shut out the traveler from his sight, and Liu Bei pointed at it, saying, “Wish that I could cut down every tree in the countryside!” “Why?” said his officers. “Because they hinder my sight of Xu Shu.”"
行至襄陽東門，只見城上遍插旌旗，壕邊密布鹿角。玄德勒馬大叫曰：“劉琮賢姪，吾但欲救百姓，並無他念。可快開門。”劉琮聞玄德至，懼而不出。蔡瑁、張允逕來敵樓上，叱軍士亂箭射下。城外百姓，皆望敵樓而哭。城中忽有一將，引數百人逕上城樓，大喝：“蔡瑁、張允賣國之賊！劉使君乃仁德之人，今為救民而來投，何得相拒！”衆觀其人：身長八尺，面如重棗；乃義陽人也：姓魏，名延，字文長。當下魏延輪刀砍死守門將士，開了城門，放下弔橋，大叫：“劉皇叔快領兵入城，共殺賣國之賊！”張飛便躍馬欲入。玄德急止之曰：“休驚百姓！”魏延只管招呼玄德軍馬入城。只見城內一將飛馬引軍而出，大喝：“魏延無名小卒，安敢造亂！認得我大將文聘麼！”魏延大怒，挺鎗躍馬，便來交戰。兩下軍兵在城邊混殺，喊聲大震。玄德曰：“本欲保民，反害民也！吾不願入襄陽！”孔明曰：“江陵乃荊州要地，不如先取江陵為家。”玄德曰：“正合吾心。”於是引着百姓，盡離襄陽大路，望江陵而走。襄陽城中百姓，多有乘亂逃出城來，跟玄德而去。魏延與文聘交戰，從巳至未，手下兵卒，皆已折盡。延乃撥馬而逃，却尋不見玄德，自投長沙太守韓玄去了。,"Walking to the east gate of Xiangyang, I saw flags and flags planted all over the city, and deer antlers densely scattered around the moat. Xuande Lema shouted, ""Liu Congxian, but I want to save the people, but I don't have any other thoughts. You can open the door quickly."" Cai Mao and Zhang Yun approached the enemy's upstairs, and scolded the sergeants to shoot down arrows. The people outside the city all looked at the enemy tower and cried. Suddenly a general in the city led hundreds of people up the city tower, shouting loudly: ""Cai Mao, Zhang Yun, traitor! Liu Shijun is a man of benevolence and virtue. Now he is here to save the people, why should he refuse!"" Person: Eight feet in length, with a face like a heavy jujube; a native of Yiyang: surname Wei, first name Yan, and characters are long. Immediately, Wei Yan slashed the guards to death with a knife, opened the city gate, lowered the drawbridge, and shouted, ""Uncle Liu, quickly lead the troops into the city, and kill the traitors together!"" Zhang Fei jumped on his horse to enter. Xuande stopped and said, ""Don't startle the people!"" Wei Yan just greeted Xuande's army to enter the city. I saw a general in the city with a flying horse leading the army out, shouting: ""Wei Yan is an unknown pawn, An dare to cause chaos! Do you recognize my general Wenpin!"" Wei Yan was furious, pounced on his horse, and came to fight. The two soldiers scrambled around the city, shouting loudly. Xuande said: ""I want to protect the people, but I want to harm the people! I don't want to enter Xiangyang!"" Kong Ming said, ""Jiangling is an important place in Jingzhou, so it's better to take Jiangling as home first."" Xuande said, ""It fits my heart."" So he led the people and walked away from Xiangyang Road and looked at Jiangling. Many of the people in Xiangyang City escaped from the city by taking advantage of the chaos and went with Xuande. Wei Yan fought with Wenpin, and from Si to Wei, all his soldiers were destroyed. Yan Nai fled on horseback, but could not find Xuande, so he went to Han Xuan, the prefect of Changsha.","At last they arrive at Xiangyang, only to be denied entrance and safety by a terrified Liu Zong. This cowardly younger son of Liu Biao, now supposed to be the ruler, is horrified at the thought of the vengeance that Cao Cao will exact if he gives sanctuary to Xuande. This despite the obvious suffering of the masses of ordinary people gathered outside the city walls. Cao Mao and Zhang Yun even order the archers on the walls to fire at those gathered before the gate. Suddenly there is a terrible commotion inside the city. A fierce-looking warrior, with a couple of hundred men behind him, roars, ‘You two traitors! Lord Xuande is a man of virtue!’ And so saying, the warrior Wei Yan slashes his way to the gate, swings it open and lowers the drawbridge, crying out, ‘Come on in and let’s kill these traitors.’ But no sooner does Wei Yan do this than another warrior, Wen Ping, bursts forth and attacks him. Chaos ensues inside the city. Watching the violence unfold, Kong Ming turns and recommends to Xuande that they abandon trying to enter Xiangyang. They decide instead to head for Jiangling.","When Xiangyang came in sight, they saw many flags flying on the walls and that the moat was protected by barbed barriers. Liu Bei checked his horse and called out, “Liu Zong, Good Nephew, I only wish to save the people and nothing more. I pray you quickly open the gates.” But Liu Zong was too frightened to appear. Cai Mao and Zhang Yun went up to one of the fighting towers and ordered the soldiers to shoot arrows down on those without the walls. The people gazed up at the towers and wept aloud. Suddenly there appeared a general, with a small following, who cried out, “Cai Mao and Zhang Yun are two traitors. The princely Liu Bei is a most upright man and has come here to preserve his people. Why do you repulse him?” All looked at this man. He was of middle height, with a face dark brown as a ripe date. He was from Yiyang and named Wei Yan. At that moment he looked very terrible, whirling his sword as if about to slice up the gate guards. They lost no time in throwing open the gate and dropping the bridge. “Come in, Uncle Liu Bei,” cried Wei Yan, “and bring your army to slay these traitors!” Zhang Fei plunged forward to take Cai Mao and Zhang Yun, but he was checked by his brother, who said, “Do not frighten the people!” Thus Wei Yan let in Liu Bei. As soon as he entered, he saw a general galloping up with a few men. The newcomer yelled, “Wei Yan, you nobody! How dare you create trouble? Do you not know me, General Wen Ping?” Wei Yan turned angrily, set his spear, and galloped forward to attack the general. The soldiers joined in the fray and the noise of battle rose to the skies. “I wanted to preserve the people, and I am only causing them injury,” cried Liu Bei distressed. “I do not wish to enter the city.” “Jiangling is an important point; we will first take that as a place to dwell in,” said Zhuge Liang. “That pleases me greatly,” said Liu Bei. So they led the people thither and away from Xiangyang. Many of the inhabitants of that city took advantage of the confusion to escape, and they also joined themselves to Liu Bei. Meanwhile, within the inhospitable city, Wei Yan and Wen Ping fought. The battle continued for four or five watches, all through the middle of the day, and nearly all the combatants fell. Then Wei Yan got away. As he could not find Liu Bei, he rode off to Changsha and sought an asylum with Governor Han Xuan. Liu Bei wandered away from the city of Xiangyang that had refused shelter."
却說李、郭二賊欲弒獻帝。張濟、樊稠諫曰：“不可：今日若便殺之，恐衆人不服；不如仍舊奉之為主，賺諸侯入關，先去其羽翼，然後殺之，天下可圖也。”李、郭二人從其言，按住兵器。帝在樓上宣諭曰：“王允旣誅，軍馬何故不退？”李傕、郭汜曰：“臣等有功王室，未蒙賜爵，故不敢退軍。”帝曰：“卿欲封何爵？”李、郭、張、樊四人各自寫職銜獻上，勒要如此官品。帝只得從之：封李傕為車騎將軍池陽侯，領司隸校尉，假節鉞；郭汜為後將軍美陽侯，假節鉞：同秉朝政；樊稠為右將軍萬年侯；張濟為驃騎將軍平陽侯，領兵屯弘農。其餘李蒙、王方等，各為校尉。然後謝恩，領兵出城。又下令追尋董卓屍首，獲得些零碎皮骨，以香木雕成形體，安湊停當，大設祭祀，用王者衣冠棺槨，選擇吉日，遷葬郿塢。臨葬之期，天降大雷雨，平地水深數尺，霹靂震開其棺，屍首提出棺外。李傕候晴再葬，是夜又復如是。三次改葬，皆不能葬。零皮碎骨，悉為雷火消滅。天之怒卓，可謂甚矣！,"But they said that the two thieves Li and Guo wanted to kill the Emperor Xian. Zhang Ji and Fan Chou remonstrated: ""No: if you kill him today, I'm afraid everyone will not accept it; it is better to keep him as the master, to gain the feudal lords to enter the customs, first remove his wings, and then kill him, the world can be drawn."" Li and Guo Er People follow their words and hold down their weapons. Upstairs, the emperor declared: ""Wang Yunyi is punished, why don't the army and horses retreat?"" Li Jue and Guo Si said: ""The ministers and other royal families have not been awarded titles, so they dare not withdraw from the army."" The emperor said: ""You want to be enthroned He Jue?"" Li, Guo, Zhang, and Fan each wrote their titles and presented them with such official titles. The emperor had no choice but to follow: Li Jue was appointed general of chariots and cavalry, the Marquis of Chiyang, the commander of the clerk, and a false yue; Guo Si, the post-general, the Marquis of Meiyang, and a false yue: Tongbing the government; Fan Chou, the right general, Wannian; Zhang Ji was the hussar general, Marquis of Pingyang, and led troops to settle in Hongnong. The rest, Li Meng, Wang Fang, etc., were all school captains. Then thank you and lead the troops out of the city. He also ordered the search for Dong Zhuo's corpse, obtained some bits and pieces of skin and bones, carved the body out of fragrant wood, settled down, set up sacrifices, used the king's robes and coffins, chose an auspicious day, and relocated to Yiwu. At the time of the burial, a heavy thunderstorm fell from the sky, and the water was several feet deep. Li Juehouqing was buried again in the same night. After three reburials, none of them could be buried. Pieces of skin and bones are known to be destroyed by thunder and fire. The wrath of the sky is so great!","Emboldened by their success, the rebels Li Jue and Guo Si then said to each other, ‘Why don’t we go the whole way and get rid of the emperor and so create our own dynasty?’","In the last chapter the two arch rebels, Li Jue and Guo Si, proposed to murder Emperor Xian, but their followers Zhang Ji and Fan Chou opposed this. “No; the people will not approve of his death now. Restore him to power, and get the leaguers inside Changan's control. Remove his supporters, and then we can compass his death. And the empire shall be in our hands.” So they ceased the attack. The Emperor again spoke from the tower, saying, “Why do you still remain? You have slain Wang Yun; now withdraw these soldiers.” Then Li Jue and Guo Si replied, “Your servants desire rank us a reward for their good service to your dynasty.” “And what rank, Sirs?” All four wrote their wishes and handed them up to the Emperor who had no choice but to accede to the request, and they were created: Li Jue was appointed General of the Flying Cavalry, Lord of Chiyang, Commander of Capital District, Court Administrator, and granted Military Insignia. Guo Si was appointed General of the Rear Army, Lord of Meiyang, Court Administrator, and granted Military Insignia. Fan Chou was appointed General of the Right Army and Lord of Wanian. Zhang Ji was appointed General of the Flying Cavalry and Lord of Pingyan. Li Meng and Wang Fang, for opening the city gates, were appointed Imperial Commander. After receiving ranks of nobility, Li Jue and Guo Si thanked the Emperor, and went away to camp at Xunung, the suburb of Changan. The inferior rebel leaders also were gratified with ranks. And once more the capital was free of troops. Dong Zhuo's followers, having so far succeeded, did not forget their late leader. They sought his corpse for burial, but only a few fragments were discoverable. Then they had sculptors engrave a statue of fragrant wood in his likeness, laid that out in proper form, and instituted a noble's sacrifices and prayers. The remains were dressed in the robes of a prince, laid in a princely coffin for burial. They selected Meiwo for his tomb and having found an auspicious day conveyed the coffin thither. But a terrific thunder storm came on at the time of inhumation, and the ground was flooded. The coffin was rived asunder and the poor remains knocked out by thunders. A second time they buried the coffin, but a similar thing happened in the night. And yet a third time in another place but the earth rejected the remains. Meanwhile the thunder-fire had entirely consumed them. So it may be said justly that Heaven was exceedingly angry with Dong Zhuo."

There are also people from Peiguo: Xiahou Dun, the character Yuanrang, the descendant of Xiahou Ying; he has learned guns and sticks since he was a child; With his two younger brothers, Xiahou Yuan, each brought a thousand strong men to the meeting. These two are brothers of Cao: Cao Song, the father of Cao, was originally the son of the Xiahou clan, and lived with the Cao family, so they were of the same clan. In a few days, Cao's brothers Cao Ren and Cao Hong each brought more than a thousand troops to help. Cao Ren's word is Zixiao, and Cao Hong's word is Zilian; the two are proficient in bowing and horses, and proficient in martial arts. Cao was overjoyed, and trained military horses in the village. Wei Hong made his fortune as a monk, and bought clothes and flags.

These two were appointed to Cao Cao's personal staff. Another was one Xiahou Dun from Qiao. He was descended from Xiahou Ying of old. Xiahou Dun had been trained from his early boyhood to use the spear and the club. When only fourteen he had been attached to a certain master-in-arms. One day one person spoke disrespectfully of his master, and Xiahou Dun killed that person. For this deed, however, he had to flee and had been an exile for some time. Now he came to offer his services, accompanied by his cousin Xiahou Yuan. Each brought a thousand trained soldiers. Really these two were brothers of Cao Cao by birth, since Cao Cao's father was originally of the Xiahou family, and had only been adopted into the Cao family. A few days later came Cao Cao's two cousins, Cao Ren and Cao Hong, each with one thousand followers. These two were accomplished horsemen and trained in the use of arms. Then drill began, and Wei Hong spent his treasure freely in buying clothing, armor, flags, and banners. From all sides poured in gifts of grain."

孔融聞之，來見操曰：“袁紹勢大，不可與戰，只可與和。”荀彧曰：“袁紹無用之人，何必議和？”融曰：“袁紹土廣民強。其部下如許攸、郭圖、審配、逢紀皆智謀之士；田豐、沮授皆忠臣也；顏良、文醜勇冠三軍；其餘高覽、張郃、淳于瓊等俱世之名將——何謂紹為無用之人乎？”彧笑曰：“紹兵多而不整。田豐剛而犯上，許攸貪而不智，審配專而無謀，逢紀果而無用，此數人者，勢不相容，必生內變。顏良、文醜，匹夫之勇，一戰可擒。其餘碌碌等輩，縱有百萬，何足道哉！”孔融默然。操大笑曰：“皆不出荀文若之料。”遂喚前軍劉岱、後軍王忠引軍五萬，打着丞相旗號，去徐州攻劉備。原來劉岱舊為兗州刺史；及操取兗州，岱降於操，操用為偏將，故今差他與王忠一同領兵。操却自引大軍二十萬，進黎陽，拒袁紹。程昱曰：“恐劉岱、王忠不稱其使。”操曰：“吾亦知非劉備敵手，權且虛張聲勢。”分付：“不可輕進。待我破紹，再勒兵破備。”劉岱、王忠領兵去了。,"When Kong Rong heard this, he came to see Cao and said, ""Yuan Shao is so powerful that he cannot fight with him, but to make peace."" Xun Yu said, ""Yuan Shao is useless, why should we negotiate peace?"" Rong said, ""Yuan Shao has a broad and powerful people. His subordinates, such as Xu You, Guo Tu, Shen Pei, and Feng Ji, are all wise men; Tian Feng and Ju Shou are all loyal ministers; Yan Liang and Wen Chou are the brave champions of the three armies; A useless person?"" Yu laughed and said, ""Shao's soldiers are too many and not organized. Tian Feng just committed the crime, Xu You was greedy but not wise, the trial and match were specialized but useless, and the results of discipline were useless. These numbers are incompatible and must be Changes in life. Yan Liang, Wen Chou, the courage of a man, can be captured in a battle. The rest of the mediocre generation, even if there are millions, how dare you!"" Kong Rong was silent. Cao laughed and said, ""Nothing is what Xun Wenruo expected."" Then he called Liu Dai in the front and Wang Zhong in the back to lead 50,000 troops, under the banner of the prime minister, to go to Xuzhou to attack Liu Bei. It turned out that Liu Dai used to be the prefect of Yanzhou; and when Cao took Yanzhou, Dai was surrendered to Cao, and Cao was a general, so he was sent to lead the army together with Wang Zhong. Cao led an army of 200,000 to Liyang and rejected Yuan Shao. Cheng Yu said: ""I'm afraid that Liu Dai and Wang Zhong will not be called their envoys."" Cao said: ""I also know that Liu Bei's opponent is not an opponent, and he is bluffing."" ."" Liu Dai and Wang Zhong led the troops.","But the incident spurs on his resolution to deal finally with Yuan Shao. After much debate and disagreement it is decided to attack Xuande and Yuan Shao at the same time, not because it is expected they could defeat Xuande but to divide and rule. Cao Cao sets off to attack Yuan Shao, while his commanders Liu Dai and Wang Zhong set off to attack Xuande.","Cao Cao called his advisers together to consider the next move. Kong Rong heard of the summons and went to Cao Cao, saying, “You should not fight with Yuan Shao; he is too strong. Make peace.” Xun Yu said, “He is despicable; do not make peace.” Kong Rong replied, “His land is wide and his people strong. He has many skillful strategists like Guo Tu, Xu You, Peng Ji, and Shen Pei; loyal leaders like Tian Feng and Ju Shou; and formidable generals like Yan Liang and Wen Chou; able commanders like Gao Lan, Zhang He, Han Meng, and Chunyu Qiong. You cannot say he is despicable.” Xun Yu laughed, saying, “His army is a rabble. One general, Tian Feng, is bold but treacherous; another, Xu You, is greedy and ignorant; Shen Pei is devoted but stupid; Peng Ji is steady but useless. And these four of such different temperaments, mutually incompatible, will make for confusion rather than efficiency. The brave Yan Liang and Wen Chou are worthless and can be disposed of in the first battle; and the others such as Gao Lan, Zhang He, Han Meng, and Chunyu Qiong are poor, rough stuff. What is the use even of their hundred thousands?” Kong Rong was silent, and Cao Cao smiled. “They are even as Xun Yu describes,” said Cao Cao. Then Cao Cao issued orders. Generals Liu Dai and Wang Zhong were to lead an army of fifty thousand troops, displaying the Prime Minister's banners, and march against Xuzhou to attack Liu Bei. This Liu Dai had been Imperial Protector of Yanzhou but had surrendered to Cao Cao and entered Cao Cao's service after the fall of the region. Cao Cao had given him a rank as Supernumerary Leader and now was disposed to make use of him. Cao Cao himself took command of a large army of two hundred thousand troops for a simultaneous attack on Yuan Shao at Liyang. Adviser Cheng Yu said, “The two Liu Dai and Wang Zhong sent against Liu Bei are unequal to their task.” “I know,” said Cao Cao. “They are not meant to fight Liu Bei; it is merely a feint. They have orders not to make any real attack till I have overcome Yuan Shao. Then Liu Bei will be next.”"

又有古風一篇曰：,There is another ancient article that says:,"At this Xuande bursts into tears and asks, ‘But what will become of the people?’",And there he found his place of rest. An old poem may be quoted here: The Founder of Han seized his gleaming blade
軍行至濟北，夏侯淵等迎接入寨，備言兄夏侯惇損其一目，臥病未痊。操臨臥處視之，令先回許都調理；一面使人打探呂布現在何處。探馬回報云：“呂布與陳宮、臧霸結連泰山賊寇，共攻兗州諸郡。”操卽令曹仁引三千兵打沛城。操親提大軍，與玄德來戰呂布。前至山東，路近蕭關，正遇泰山寇孫觀、吳敦、尹禮、昌豨領兵三萬餘攔住去路。操令許褚迎戰，四將一齊出馬。許褚奮力死戰，四將抵敵不住，各自敗走。操乘勢掩殺，追至蕭關，探馬飛報呂布。,"When the army marched to Jibei, Xiahou Yuan and others greeted him and entered the village, and prepared to say that his brother Xiahou Dun had lost one of his eyes and was lying ill. Cao looked at him at the bedside, and ordered him to return to Xudu to recuperate; on the other hand, he ordered people to find out where Lü Bu was now. The horse inspected and reported: ""Lü Bu, Chen Gong and Zang Ba joined forces with the pirates in Mount Tai and attacked the counties in Yanzhou."" Cao Ren ordered Cao Ren to lead three thousand troops to attack Peicheng. Cao personally raised the army, and came to fight with Xuande against Lu Bu. Before reaching Shandong, the road was close to Xiaoguan, and the road was blocked by more than 30,000 troops led by the Taishan Kou Sunguan, Wu Dun, Yin Li, and Chang Xi. Xu Chu was ordered to fight, and the four generals marched together. Xu Chu fought hard to the death, and the four generals could not stand the enemy, and each was defeated. Cao took advantage of the situation to cover up, chased to Xiaoguan, and flew to Lu Bu.","Xuande joins up with Cao Cao. Soon they are on the warpath again, heading for Lü Bu.","The march then was continued to Jibei, where Xiahou Yuan welcomed them. They heard that his brother Xiahou Dun was still ill from the wound he had received in the eye. Cao Cao went to the sick man's bedside to see him and had him removed to Xuchang for skilled treatment. Presently scouts, sent out particularly for tidings of Lu Bu, returned, saying, “Lu Bu has allied himself with the bandits in the east, and they are attacking Yanzhou.” At this Cao Cao dispatched Cao Ren with three thousand soldiers to take Xiaopei, while he, in conjunction with Liu Bei, moved against Lu Bu. They went east. As they reached the Mangdang Hills near Xiao Pass, they met the a band of thirty thousand Taishan Mountains brigands barring their road. The chieftains of the bandits were Sun Guan, Wu Dun, Yin Li, and Chang Xi who rode out with their spears set. However, Xu Chu plunged into the battle and easily beat them back and chased them right up to the pass. The scouts told Lu Bu, who was then in Xuzhou, whither he had gone to start an expedition to save Xiaopei."
却說騰字壽成，漢伏波將軍馬援之後。父名肅，字子碩，桓帝時為天水蘭干縣尉；後失官流落隴西，與羌人雜處，遂娶羌女生騰。騰身長八尺，體貌雄異，稟性温良，人多敬之。靈帝末年，羌人多叛，騰招募民兵破之。初平中年，因討賊有功，拜征西將軍，與鎮西將軍韓遂為兄弟。當日奉詔，乃與長子馬超商議曰：“吾自與董承受衣帶詔以來，與劉玄德約共討賊，不幸董承已死，玄德屢敗。我又僻處西涼，未能協助玄德。今聞玄德已得荊州，我正欲展昔日之志，而曹操反來召我，當是如何？”馬超曰：“操奉天子之命以召父親，今若不往，彼必以逆命責我矣。當乘其來召，竟往京師，於中取事，則昔日之志可展也。”馬騰兄子馬岱諫曰：“曹操心懷叵測，叔父若往，恐遭其害。”超曰：“兒願盡起西涼之兵，隨父親殺入許昌，為天下除害，有何不可？”騰曰：“汝自統羌兵保守西涼，只敎次子馬休、馬鐵并姪馬岱隨我同往。曹操見有汝在西涼，又有韓遂相助，諒不敢加害於我也。”超曰：“父親欲往，切不可輕入京師。當隨機應變，觀其動靜。”騰曰：“吾自有處，不必多慮。”於是馬騰乃引西涼兵五千，先敎馬休、馬鐵為前部，留馬岱在後接應，迤邐望許昌而來。離許昌二十里屯住軍馬。,"But he said that the word Teng was Shoucheng, after the general of Han Fubo Ma Yuan. His father's name was Su, his courtesy name was Zishuo, and he was the Lieutenant of Langan County in Tianshui during Emperor Huan's time. Teng is eight feet long, with a handsome appearance, a gentle temperament, and many people respect him. In the last years of Emperor Ling, many Qiang people rebelled, so Teng recruited militiamen to break them. In the middle age of Chuping, because of his meritorious deeds in fighting thieves, he worshipped the general of the expedition to the west and became brothers with the general of Zhenxi, Han Sui. Following the edict that day, he discussed with his eldest son, Ma Chao, and said, ""Since the edict of Dong Cheng's clothes and belts, I have made a pact with Liu Xuande to deal with thieves. Unfortunately, Dong Cheng has died, and Xuande has been defeated repeatedly. Xuande. Now I hear that Xuande has won Jingzhou, I was about to show my old ambitions, but Cao Cao came to call me, what should I do?"" Ma Chao said: ""I was ordered by the Son of Heaven to call my father. You must rebuke me for going against the order. If you take advantage of him to summon him, and go to the capital to find something in the middle, then the old ambitions can be displayed."" Ma Teng's brother Ma Dai said, ""Cao Cao has a bad mind, if my uncle goes there, I'm afraid of being harmed by it."" Chao said, ""My son would like to raise all the troops of Xiliang, and follow my father to enter Xuchang, and destroy the world, why not?"" Teng said, ""You have commanded the Qiang troops to protect Xiliang, and only teach My second sons Ma Xiu, Ma Tie, and my concubine Ma Dai will accompany me. Cao Cao sees that you are in Xiliang and Han Sui is helping you, so please forgive me for not hurting me."" Chao said: ""Father wants to go, he must not enter lightly. The capital. Be prepared to respond accordingly and watch its movements.” Teng said, “I have a place of my own, so I don’t need to worry too much.” So Ma Teng brought in five thousand soldiers from the Western Liang Dynasty, and first sent Ma Xiu and Ma Tie as the front, leaving Ma Dai at the back. In response, I looked forward to Xuchang. Twenty miles away from Xuchang to live military horses.","When Kong Ming returns from his travels he asks what high position Xuande has given to Pang Tong, and a shamefaced Xuande has to confess his mistake. But Kong Ming smiles and asks if Pang Tong has shown them the letter he, Kong Ming, wrote. Again, surprise all around that Pang Tong has not used this to gain favour. And so it is that Pang Tong is brought back to Jingzhou and is made Kong Ming’s assistant. He is given a high military role, and the two of them start to work side by side preparing for the next battle against the north. Back in the capital, this information reaches Cao Cao, in particular news of their planned joint attack on the north. Cao Cao starts to plot his attack first but is deeply worried that the tribal leader Ma Teng from the remote western regions might use the opportunity of their being deep down south to attack.","Ma Teng was a descendant of the famous leader Ma Yuan, General Who Quells the Waves. His father's name was Ma Su. Ma Su had held a minor magistracy in Tianshui in the reign of Emperor Huan, but had lost it and drifted west into Longxi where he got amongst the Qiang Peoples, one of whose women he took to wife. She bore him a son, Ma Teng. Ma Teng was rather over the common height, and bold-looking. He was of a mild disposition and very popular. But in the reign of Emperor Ling, these Qiangs made trouble, and then Ma Teng raised a force and put it down. For his services he received the tile of General Who Corrects the West. He and Han Sui, who was known as Commander Who Guards the West, were pledged brothers. On receipt of the summons to the capital, Ma Teng took his eldest son, Ma Chao, into his confidence and told him some of his former life. “When Dong Cheng got the Girdle Edict from the Emperor, we formed a society, of which Liu Bei was one, pledged to put down rebellion. However, we accomplished nothing, for Dong Cheng was put to death and Liu Bei was unfortunate, while I escaped to the west. However, I hear that Liu Bei now holds Jingzhou, and I am inclined to carry out the plan we made so long ago. But here I am summoned by Cao Cao and what is to be done?” Ma Chao replied, “Cao Cao has the command of the Emperor to call you; and if you do not go, that will mean disobeying an imperial command and you will be punished. Obey the summons in so far as to go to the capital, where you may be able to arrange to carry out your original intention.” But Ma Teng's nephew, Ma Dai, held other opinions and opposed this. Said he, “Cao Cao's designs are unfathomable; and if you go, Uncle, I fear you will suffer.” “Let me lead the army against the capital,” said Ma Chao. “Can we not purge the empire of evil?” But his father said, “You must take command of the Qiang troops for the defense of our territory here. I will take with me your two brothers and your cousin. When Cao Cao knows that you have the Qiangs at your call and that Han Sui is prepared to assist, he will hardly dare to work any harm to me.” “Father, if you must go, be careful not to enter the city till you know exactly what plots and machinations are afoot.” “I will certainly take great care, so do not be too anxious,” said the father. The order of march was prepared. The governor took five thousand troops, with his two sons—Ma Xiu and Ma Tie—as Leaders of the Van and his nephew Ma Dai bringing up the rear. These set out along the tortuous road to the capital. At seven miles distance from Xuchang they camped."
却說曹操於黃昏時分，引軍至西寨，四面突入。寨兵不能抵擋，四散奔走，曹操奪了寨。將及四更，高順方引軍到，殺將入來。曹操自引軍馬來迎，正逢高順，三軍混戰。將及天明，正西鼓聲大震，人報呂布自引軍來了。操棄寨而走。背後高順、魏續、侯成趕來，當頭呂布親自引軍來到。于禁、樂進雙戰呂布不住，操望北而行。山後一彪軍出：左有張遼，右有臧霸。操使呂虔、曹洪戰之，不利，操望西而走。忽又喊聲大震，一彪軍至：郝萌、曹性、成廉、宋憲四將攔住去路。衆將死戰，操當先衝陣。梆子響處，箭如驟雨射將來。操不能前進，無計可脫，大叫：“誰人救我！”馬軍隊裏，一將踴出：乃典韋也——手挺雙鐵戟，大叫：“主公勿憂！”飛身下馬，插住雙戟，取短戟十數枝，挾在手中，顧從人曰：“賊來十步乃呼我！”遂放開脚步，冒箭前行。布軍數十騎追至，從人大叫曰：“十步矣！”韋曰：“五步乃呼我！”從人又曰：“五步矣！”韋乃飛戟刺之，一戟一人墜馬，並無虛發，立殺十數人。衆皆奔走。韋復飛身上馬，挺一雙大鐵戟，衝殺入去。郝、曹、成、宋四將不能抵擋，各自逃去。典韋殺散敵軍，救出曹操，衆將隨後也到，尋路歸寨。看看天色傍晚，背後喊聲起處，呂布驟馬提戟趕來，大叫：“操賊休走！”此時人困馬乏，大家面面相覷，各欲逃生。正是：,"But it is said that Cao Cao led his army to Xizhai at dusk, and rushed in from all directions. The soldiers of the village could not resist, and they were scattered, and Cao Cao seized the village. At the fourth watch, Gao Shun led the army and killed the general. Cao Cao led his troops to welcome him, and just in time for Gao Shun, the three armies fought meleely. When it was about dawn, the drums in Zhengxi shook loudly, and people reported that Lu Bu had brought troops. Abandoned the village and left. Behind him, Gao Shun, Wei Xu, and Hou Cheng came, and Lu Bu led the army himself. Yu Jin and Le Jin fought against Lu Bu, so they headed north. A Biao army came out from the back of the mountain: Zhang Liao on the left, Zang Ba on the right. Cao's envoys Lu Qian and Cao Hong fought against them, but they were unfavorable, so Cao looked west and left. Suddenly, there was another loud shout, and a swarm of troops arrived: Hao Meng, Cao Xing, Cheng Lian, and Song Xian four generals blocked the way. The generals are fighting to the death, and Cao takes the lead. Where the clapper sounded, arrows shot into the future like a shower of rain. Cao couldn't move forward and had no choice but to cry out: ""Who will save me!"" In the horse army, a general jumped out: Nai Dian Wei Ye - holding two iron halberds in his hands, shouting: ""Master, don't worry!"" Dismounting from his horse, he stuck his halberds, took a dozen or so short halberds and held them in his hands. Gu Congren said, ""The thief is calling me ten steps away!"" Then he let go of his footsteps and marched forward with arrows. Several dozen cavalry of the Bu army came after them, and the followers shouted, ""Ten paces!"" Wei said, ""Five paces call me!"" The followers also said, ""Five paces!"" The horse, without any fuss, killed dozens of people. All run. Wei Fufei mounted his horse, held up a pair of large iron halberds, and rushed in. The four generals, Hao, Cao, Cheng, and Song, could not resist and fled. Dian Wei killed and scattered the enemy army and rescued Cao Cao. The generals also arrived and found their way back to the village. Looking at the sky in the evening, when the shouting started from behind, Lü Bu rushed over with a halberd and shouted, ""Fuck the thief!"" At this time, the people were trapped and the horses were exhausted, and everyone looked at each other, each trying to escape. Exactly:","Cao Cao is forced to try to escape, but every way he turns he is confronted by Lü Bu’s men. Trapped, he cries out, ‘Who will come and save me?’ Gallant Dian Wei responds. Dismounting and arming himself with throwing axes, he advances on foot, telling his followers to shout when the enemy soldiers are within ten paces of him. The shout goes up: ‘Ten paces, sir’, to which Dian Wei replies that they must now tell him when the enemy is within five paces. ‘Five paces, sir,’ cry his desperate followers, and at this point Dian Wei hurls the hand axes left and right, killing all those attacking him. So ferocious is Dian Wei’s attack that he breaks the enemy assault and is just able to rescue Cao Cao. But their troubles are not over. Just as they struggle back to their camp a shout of triumph is heard. ‘Cao, you bastard, stop!’ It is Lü Bu!","At dusk Cao Cao reached the camp and began an immediate attack on all four sides. The defenders could not hold him off. They ran in all directions, and the camp was captured. Near the fourth watch, when the defending party came, Cao Cao sallied forth to meet them and met Gao Shun. Another battle then began and waged till dawn. About that time a rolling of drums was heard in the west, and they told Cao Cao that Lu Bu himself was at hand. Thereupon Cao Cao abandoned the attack and fled. Gao Shun, Wei Xu, and Hou Cheng pursued him, Lu Bu taking the lead. Cao Cao's two generals, Yu Jin and Yue Jin, attacked the pursuers but could not check them. Cao Cao went away north. But from behind some hills came out Zhang Liao and Zang Ba to attack. Lu Qian and Cao Hong were sent to stop the attackers, but Lu Qian and Cao Hong were both defeated. Cao Cao sought safety in the west. Here again his retreat was met by Lu Bu's four generals, Hao Meng, Cao Xing, Cheng Lian, and Song Xian. The fight became desperate. Cao Cao dashed at the enemy's array. The din was terrible. Arrows fell like pelting rain upon them, and they could make no headway. Cao Cao was desperate and cried out in fear, “Who can save me?” Then from the crush dashed out Dian Wei with his double spears, crying, “Fear not, my master.” Dian Wei leapt from his steed, leaned his double spears against a wall and laid hold of a handful of battle-axes. Turning to his followers he said, “When the ruffians are at ten paces, call out to me.” Then he set off with mighty strides, plunging forward, careless of the flying arrows. Lu Bu's horsemen followed, and when they got near, Dian Wei's followers shouted, “Ten paces!” “Five, then call!” shouted back Dian Wei, and went on. Presently, “Five paces!” Then Dian Wei spun round and flung the battle-axes. With every fling a man fell from the saddle and never a battle-ax missed. Having thus slain ten or so the remainder fled, and Dian Wei quickly remounted his steed, set his twin spears and rushed again into the fight with a vigor that none could withstand. One by one his opponents yielded, and he was able to lead Cao Cao safely out of the press of battle. Cao Cao and his commanders went to their camp. But as evening fell, the noise of pursuit fell on their ears, and soon appeared Lu Bu himself. “Cao Cao, you rebel, do not flee!” shouted Lu Bu as he approached with his halberd ready for a thrust. All stopped and looked in each others' faces: the soldiers were weary, their steeds spent. Fear smote them, and they looked around for some place of refuge."

於是三人乘馬引從者往隆中。離草廬半里之外，玄德便下馬步行，正遇諸葛均。玄德忙施禮，問曰：“令兄在莊否？”均曰：“昨暮方歸。將軍今日可與相見。”言罷，飄然自去。玄德曰：“今番僥倖得見先生矣！”張飛曰：“此人無禮！便引我等到莊也不妨，何故竟自去了！”玄德曰：“彼各有事，豈可相強。”三人來到莊前叩門，童子開門出問。玄德曰：“有勞仙童轉報：劉備專來拜見先生。”童子曰：“今日先生雖在家，但今在草堂上晝寢未醒。”玄德曰：“旣如此，且休通報。”分付關、張二人，只在門首等着。玄德徐步而入，見先生仰臥於草堂几席之上。玄德拱立階下。半晌，先生未醒。關、張在外立久，不見動靜，入見玄德猶然侍立。張飛大怒，謂雲長曰：“這先生如何傲慢！見我哥哥侍立階下，他竟高臥，推睡不起！等我去屋後放一把火，看他起不起！”雲長再三勸住。玄德仍命二人出門外等候。望堂上時，見先生翻身將起——忽又朝裏壁睡着。童子欲報。玄德曰：“且勿驚動。”又立了一個時辰，孔明纔醒，口吟詩曰：,"So the three of them rode their horses and led their followers to Longzhong. Half a mile away from the grass hut, Xuande dismounted and walked on foot, and he was meeting Zhuge Jun. Xuande was busy giving the salute, and asked, ""Is your brother in the village?"" All said, ""I returned yesterday evening. The general can meet you today."" Xuande said, ""I was lucky enough to meet Mr. Zhang today!"" Zhang Fei said, ""This man is rude! It's okay to lead me to the village, but why did you go away!"" Xuande said, ""They have their own problems, so how can they be strong. ""The three came to the front of the village and knocked on the door, and the boy opened the door and asked. Xuande said: ""There is a laboring fairy boy to report: Liu Bei has come to see the master."" The boy said, ""Although the master is at home today, he is sleeping in the cottage and has not woken up during the day."" Xuande said: ""If this is the case, please stop reporting."" Fenfu Guan and Zhang were just waiting at the front of the door. Xuande walked in slowly, and saw the gentleman lying on his back on a few seats in the thatched cottage. Xuande arched under the steps. After a long while, Mr. didn't wake up. Guan and Zhang stood outside for a long time without seeing any movement. Zhang Fei was furious and said to Yun Chang, ""How arrogant is this gentleman! Seeing my brother standing at the foot of the steps, he is lying high and can't be pushed to sleep! When I go to the back of the house and set a fire, let's see that he can't get up!"" Persuade again and again. Xuande still ordered the two to wait outside. When I went up to the Wangtang, I saw that Mr. turned over and was about to get up - and suddenly fell asleep towards the inner wall. Children want to report. Xuande said, ""Don't be disturbed."" After another hour, Kong Ming woke up and recited a poem:","His two brothers decide they must try to persuade him not to bother. Are they successful? Let’s find out. CHAPTER 38 Kong Ming reveals the truth about the three kingdoms. Sun Quan prepares to avenge his father. Try as they might to dissuade Xuande, he recites precedent after precedent from history to show that the greatest heroes of China’s past have gone humbly, often many times, before being able to speak to great sages. The disgust of Zhang Fei in particular at all this sentimental rubbish is clear, but Xuande warns him to be on his best behaviour. So they go off and before long stand once again in front of the door of the simple hut. Imagine Xuande’s delight to be told that Kong Ming is asleep within. He enters the hut and stands deferentially at the foot of the bed. Kong Ming sleeps on hour after hour, while Zhang Fei in particular grows more and more annoyed, even threatening to set fire to the back of the hut to wake the sleeper up! But Xuande silences him. At long last Kong Ming awakes and from his sleepy state mutters:","Zhang Fei said he would not forget himself, and the three set out. When they were a quarter of mile from the little cottage, Liu Bei dismounted, deciding to show his respect by approaching the house on foot. Very soon he met Zhuge Jun, whom he saluted with great deference, inquiring whether his brother was at home. “He returned last evening; you can see him today, General.” As Zhuge Jun said this, he went off with some swagger. “Fortune favors me this time,” said Liu Bei, “I am going to see the Master.” “That was a rude fellow;” said Zhang Fei, “it would not have hurt him to have conducted us to the house. Why did he go off like that?” “Each one has his own affairs,” said Liu Bei. “What power have we over him?” Soon the three stood at the door and they knocked. The serving lad came out and asked their business, and Liu Bei said very deferentially, “I would trouble the servant of the genius, gentle page, to inform the Master that Liu Bei wishes to pay his respects to him.” “My master is at home, but he is asleep.” “In that case do not announce me.” Liu Bei bade his two brothers wait at the door quietly, and he himself entered with careful steps. There was the man he sought, lying asleep on the couch, stretched on a simple mat. Liu Bei saluted him with joined hands at a respectful distance. The time passed and still the sleeper did not wake. The two brothers left without, beginning to feel impatient, also came in, and Zhang Fei was annoyed at seeing his revered elder brother respectfully standing by while another slept. “What an arrogant fellow is this Master?” said he. “There is our brother waiting, while he sleeps on perfectly carelessly. I will go to the back of the place and let off a bomb and see if that will rouse him.” “No, no; you must do nothing of the kind,” whispered Guan Yu, and then Liu Bei told them to go out again. Just then Liu Bei noticed that the Master moved. He turned over as though about to rise, but, instead, he faced the wall and again fell asleep. The serving lad made as if he would rouse his master, but Liu Bei forbade him to be disturbed, and Liu Bei waited yet another weary hour. Then Zhuge Liang woke up repeating to himself the lines:"

次日，張飛欲與關公同赴汝南見玄德。關公曰：“賢弟可保護二嫂，暫住此城，待我與孫乾先去探聽兄長消息。”飛允諾。關公與孫乾引數騎奔汝南來。劉辟、龔都接着，關公便問：“皇叔何在？”劉辟曰：“皇叔到此住了數日，為見軍少，復往河北袁本初處商議去了。”關公怏怏不樂。孫乾曰：“不必憂慮。再苦一番驅馳，仍往河北去報知皇叔，同至古城便了。”關公依言，辭了劉辟、龔都，回至古城，與張飛說知此事。張飛便欲同至河北。關公曰：“有此一城，便是我等安身之處，未可輕棄。我還與孫乾同往袁紹處，尋見兄長，來此相會。賢弟可堅守此城。”飛曰：“兄斬他顏良、文醜，如何去得？”關公曰：“不妨。我到彼當見機而變。”遂喚周倉問曰：“臥牛山裴元紹處，共有多少人馬？”倉曰：“約有四五百。”關公曰：“我今抄近路去尋兄長。汝可往臥牛山招此一枝人馬，從大路上接來。”倉領命而去。,"The next day, Zhang Fei wanted to go to Runan with Guan Gong to see Xuande. Guan Gong said: ""My worthy brother can protect the second sister-in-law and live in this city temporarily, until I and Sun Qianxian go to find out about my brother."" Fei promised. Guan Gong and Sun Qian came to Runan on horseback. Liu Pi and Gong both followed, and Guan Gong asked, ""Where is the uncle?"" Liu Pi said, ""Uncle Huang stayed here for a few days. In order to see the army, he went back to Yuan Benchu, Hebei to discuss."" Guan Gong was unhappy. . Sun Qian said: ""Don't worry. No matter how hard you drive, you will still go to Hebei to report to the uncle, and then go to the ancient city together."" this matter. Zhang Fei wanted to go to Hebei with him. Guan Gong said: ""There is this city, which is the place where we can live, and we cannot abandon it lightly. I also went to Yuan Shao with Sun Qian to find my elder brother and come here to meet. My wise brother can stick to this city."" Fei said: ""Brother beheaded Yan Liang and Wen Chou, how to get them?"" Guan Gong said: ""It's okay. I will see the opportunity when I get there."" Then he called Zhou Cang and asked, ""How many people are there at Pei Yuanshao's place in Wo Niu Mountain?"" Cang said: ""About There are four or five hundred."" Guan Gong said, ""I will take a shortcut now to find my brother. You can go to Woniu Mountain to recruit this group of people and pick them up from the road."" Cang took orders and left.","It is agreed once again that Guan Yu and Sun Qian should go to find Xuande while Zhang Fei guards the city and the ladies. The danger, of course, is that, in entering the territory of Yuan Shao, Guan Yu will be a wanted man for having killed Yuan Shao’s two best commanders. Secrecy has to be paramount. When Sun Qian and Guan Yu arrive at the river border, Sun Qian persuades Guan Yu to seek shelter at a nearby farm while he rides on into Yuan Shao’s territory to find Xuande.","A day was spent in banquets, and next day Zhang Fei wished his newly found brother to go with him to Runan to see their elder brother Liu Bei. But Guan Yu said, “No; you take care of the ladies here while Sun Qian and I go to get news.” So Guan Yu and Sun Qian with a small escort set out. When they reached Runan, they were received by Liu Pi. “Liu Bei is no longer in the city. After waiting some days, he has come to the conclusion that the soldiers are too few, and has gone back to Yuan Shao to consult with him,” said Liu Pi. Guan Yu was greatly disappointed, and Sun Qian did his best to console him, saying, “Do not be sorrowful; it only means the trouble of another journey into the North of Yellow River to tell Uncle Liu Bei, and then we can all meet at Gucheng.” So spoke Sun Qian, and Guan Yu accepted it. They took leave of Liu Pi and returned to Gucheng where they related what had happened. Zhang Fei wanted to go with them into the North of Yellow River, but Guan Yu opposed this, saying, “Seeing you have this city, it makes a rallying point for us and a resting place. We must not abandon it lightly. Sun Qian and I will go; and while sway we look to you to keep the city safe.” “How can you go after killing the two generals, Yan Liang and Wen Chou?” “That will not stop me. And after I am there, I can act according to circumstances.” Then Guan Yu summoned Zhou Cang and asked him, saying, “How many followers are there with Pei Yuanshao at Sleeping Bull Mountain?” “I should think four or five hundred.” “Now,” said Guan Yu, “I am going to take the shortest road to find my brother. Can you go to summon your army and lead them along the high road to assist me?” With instructions to bring up this force, Zhou Cang left, while Guan Yu and Sun Qian and their small escort went off to the north."

Yu Jin and Li Dian rushed to the narrow place, with reeds on both sides. Dian called Jin and said: ""Those who deceive the enemy will be defeated. The road to the south is narrow, the mountains and rivers are facing each other, and the trees are mixed. If he uses fire to attack, what will happen?"" Jin said: ""The king said yes. You can stop the rear army."" Li Dian pulled back his horse and shouted, ""The rear army is slow!"" Yu Jin suddenly shouted: ""The former military governor will stay here!"" Xiahou Dun was walking, when he saw Yu Jin running from the rear, he asked why. The ban said: ""The road to the south is narrow, the mountains and rivers are facing each other, and the trees are mixed, so it can be prevented from attacking."" Before he finished speaking, he heard the shouting behind him, and he saw a fire burning; then the reeds were also on both sides. In an instant, all directions were filled with fire; and when the wind was strong, the fire became more intense. The Cao family and horses trampled on each other, and the dead were countless. Zhao Yun returned to the army to kill him, and Xiahou Dun burst into flames and ran away.","And still Xiahou Dun cannot see that he is riding into an ambush. It is only when Yu Jin realizes that they could be caught by fires set on either side and rushes to warn Xiahou Dun that the commander sees the danger. But it is too late. Fires erupt on each side, causing utter confusion, and many are killed trying to escape. Then Zhao Zilong attacks the trapped troops, slaying many, and Xiahou Dun only just manages to escape.","The wind increased but the leader still urged his troops after the retreating foe. The two generals in the rear came to a narrow part of the road with reeds and rushes thick all round them. “Those who despise the enemy are beaten,” said Li Dian to Yu Jin. “Away south there the roads are narrow, and streams and mountains make the country difficult. The forests are dense, and if the enemy used fire we should be lost.” “You are right,” replied Yu Jin. “I will get on and warn the Commanding General; perhaps he will stop. You can halt those who come up.” Yu Jin rode forward shouting at the top of his voice, “Halt the train!” Xiahou Dun saw him coming up and asked what was the matter. Yu Jin said, “The roads here are narrow and difficult. Around us are thick forests. What if they use fire?” Xiahou Dun's ferocity had then somewhat abated and he turned his steed toward his main body. Then there arose a shout behind him. A rushing noise came from in the reeds and great tongues of flame shot up here and there. These spread and soon the fire was in “the four quarters and the eight sides,” and fanned by a strong wind. Xiahou Dun's troops were thrown into confusion and trampled each other down. Many perished. Zhao Yun turned on them again to make a slaughter. Xiahou Dun dashed through the fire and smoke to escape."

却說玄德訪孔明兩次不遇，欲再往訪之。關公曰：“兄長兩次親往拜謁，其禮太過矣。想諸葛亮有虛名而無實學，故避而不敢見。兄何惑於斯人之甚也！”玄德曰：“不然：昔齊桓公欲見東郭野人，五反而方得一面。況吾欲見大賢耶？”張飛曰：“哥哥差矣：量此村夫，何足為大賢？今番不須哥哥去；他如不來，我只用一條麻繩縛將來！”玄德叱曰：“汝豈不聞周文王謁姜子牙之事乎？文王且如此敬賢，汝何太無禮！今番汝休去，我自與雲長去。”飛曰：“旣兩位哥哥都去，小弟如何落後？”玄德曰：“汝若同往，不可失禮。”飛應諾。,"However, Xuande said that he had not met Kongming twice and wanted to visit him again. Guan Gong said: ""My brother has visited him twice in person, and the etiquette is too much. I think that Zhuge Liang has a false name but no real knowledge, so he avoided it and dared not see it. Brother, why do you confuse the people of this country?"" Xuande said: ""Otherwise: In the past, Duke Huan of Qi wanted to see the savages of Dongguo, but he was only able to get one side. Besides, I want to see the great sage?"" Zhang Fei said, ""My brother is bad: how can this villager be considered a great sage? If you don't come, I will only use a hemp rope to tie the future!"" Xuande shouted: ""Have you not heard about King Wen of Zhou's visit to Jiang Ziya? King Wen is so respectful to the virtuous, how can you be so rude! I will go with Yunchang."" Fei said, ""Both elder brothers are going, how can the younger brother fall behind?"" Xuande said, ""If you go together, don't be rude."" Fei agreed.","However, he is to be disappointed once again, for this is not Kong Ming. Instead it is his brother, Zhuge Jun. There are three brothers, of whom the eldest, Zhuge Jin, is working with Sun Quan; Zhuge Liang – Kong Ming – is the second brother and Zhuge Jun is the third and youngest. Zhang Fei is once again less than impressed, to put it mildly, and urges Xuande to leave now to get back to the warmth of the city. But, before leaving, Xuande writes a letter for Kong Ming. In this he politely points out that twice now he has tried to see him in the hope that he will help him restore the honour of the House of Han. He then says that he will try one more time to see him. So the three brothers return to Xinye, and it is many months before they can travel out again on this quest – almost springtime in fact. Selecting an auspicious day, and after ritually fasting for three days and bathing, Xuande gets ready to go.","Nothing discouraged by two unsuccessful visits to the retreat of the sage whose advice he sought to secure, Liu Bei made preparations for a third visit. His brothers disapproved, and Guan Yu said, “Brother, you have sought him twice; surely this is showing even too much deference. I do not believe in this fame of his for learning; he is avoiding you and dare not submit to the test. Why so obstinately hold this idea?” “You are wrong, my brother. In the Spring and Autumn Period Prince Huan of Qi paid five visits to the 'Hermit of the Eastern Suburb' before he got to see his face. And my desire to see Zhuge Liang is even greater than his.” “I think you are mistaken,” said Zhang Fei. “How can this villager be such a marvel of wisdom? You should not go again and, if he will not come, I will bring him with a hempen rope.” “Have you forgotten the great King Wen's visit to Lu Wang, the old man of the Eastern Sea? If he could show such deference to a wise man, where am I too deferential? If you will not go, your brother and I will go without you,” said Liu Bei. “If you two go, how can I hang back?” said Zhang Fei. “If you go, then you must be polite.” Zhang Fei said he would not forget himself, and the three set out."

却說玄德一行人馬，離柴桑較遠，來到劉郎浦，心纔稍寬。沿着江岸尋渡，一望江水瀰漫，並無船隻。玄德俯首沈吟。趙雲曰：“主公在虎口中逃出，今已近本界，吾料軍師必有調度，何用憂疑？”玄德聽罷，驀然想起在吳繁華之事，不覺淒然淚下。後人有詩歎曰：,"However, it was said that Xuande and his party were far away from Chaisang, and when they came to Liulangpu, their hearts were a little wider. Looking for crossing along the river bank, the river is filled with water, and there are no ships. Xuande bowed his head and pondered. Zhao Yun said: ""The lord escaped from the tiger's mouth, and now it is close to the realm. I think the military advisors must be dispatched. Why worry?"" A later poem sighed and said:","Meanwhile, Xuande, Zhao Zilong and Lady Sun have reached the edge of the river. But not a single boat is to be found to ferry them over to safety. ‘Don’t worry,’ says Zilong, ‘I am sure Kong Ming will have thought of something.’ But this does little to reassure Xuande. He finds his thoughts drifting back to his recent life of luxury and he gently weeps. As a poet has said about this couple: Here on these shores, east and west wed.","He now felt calmer. He went along the bank of the river seeking a boat, but there was no craft on the broad bosom of the stream. He bowed his head in deep sorrow. Zhao Yun bade him be of good courage, saying, “My lord, you have just escaped from the tiger's jaws and had not far to go. Moreover, I suspect Zhuge Liang has something prepared for us.” But his master was despondent. His thoughts were back to the pleasures he had enjoyed but a few hours since in the house of his wife, and the tears rolled down his cheeks. A poem has been written on this episode:"
前番兩賊分為二，今番三賊合為一。,"In the previous episode, the two thieves were divided into two, and this time the three thieves merged into one.","The rebels, once divided in two,","The rebel party, erstwhile split in twain,"
陵替——敗壞；指法紀廢弛，尊卑失序。,"Mausoleum - corruption; fingering discipline is lax, respect is out of order.","This is pointless, so why don’t we just get back to the warmth of the city?’",Then Liu Bei cast lots to find the propitious day for another journey in search of Zhuge Liang.
周瑜回到下處，便請孔明議事。孔明至。瑜曰：“今日府下公議已定，願求破曹良策。”孔明曰：“孫將軍心尚未穩，不可以決策也。”瑜曰：“何謂心不穩？”孔明曰：“心怯曹兵之多，懷寡不敵衆之意；將軍以軍數開解，使其了然無疑，然後大事可成。”瑜曰：“先生之論甚善。”乃復入見孫權。權曰：“公瑾夜至，必有事故。”瑜曰：“來日調撥軍馬，主公心有疑否？”權曰：“但憂曹操兵多，寡不敵衆耳。他無所疑。”瑜笑曰：“瑜特為此來開解主公。主公因見操檄文，言水陸大軍百萬，故懷疑懼，不復料其虛實。今以實較之：彼將中國之兵，不過十五六萬，且已久疲；所得袁氏之衆，亦止七八萬耳，尚多懷疑未服。夫以久疲之卒，御狐疑之衆，其數雖多，不足畏也。瑜得五萬兵，自足破之。願主公勿以為慮。”權撫瑜背曰：“公瑾此言，足釋吾疑。子布無謀，深失孤望；獨卿及子敬，與孤同心耳。卿可與子敬、程普卽日選軍前進。孤當續發人馬，多載資糧，為卿後應。卿前軍倘不如意，便還就孤。孤當親與曹賊決戰，更無他疑。”周瑜謝出，暗忖曰：“孔明早已料着吳侯之心。其計畫又高我一頭。久必為江東之患，不如殺之。”乃令人連夜請魯肅入帳，言欲殺孔明之事。肅曰：“不可：今操賊未破，先殺賢士，是自去其助也。”瑜曰：“此人助劉備，必為江東之患。”肅曰：“諸葛瑾乃其親兄，可令招此人同事東吳，豈不妙哉？”瑜善其言。,"Zhou Yu returned to the next place and asked Kong Ming to discuss matters. Kong Ming to. Yu said, ""Today the government has decided on a public decision, and I would like to seek to break Cao Liang's strategy."" Kong Ming said, ""General Sun's heart is not yet stable, so he cannot make a decision."" Yu said, ""What does it mean to be unstable?"" Kong Ming said, ""He is afraid of Cao Cao. There are many soldiers, and the intention is to be outnumbered and outnumbered; the general will use the number of troops to solve it, make it clear, and then great things can be accomplished."" Yu said, ""Sir's argument is very good."" Then he returned to see Sun Quan. Quan said, ""When Duke Jin arrives at night, there must be an accident."" Yu said, ""Is there any doubts about the deployment of troops and horses in the future?"" Quan said, ""But I am worried that Cao Cao's troops will be outnumbered and outnumbered. He has no doubts. ""Yu smiled and said, ""Yu is here to relieve the lord. Because the lord saw Cao's words, saying that the army of land and water is one million, so he was suspicious and fearful, and he did not reckon the truth. Now compare it with reality: he will command the Chinese soldiers, but only Fifteen or sixty thousand, and they have been exhausted for a long time; the number of Yuan Shi’s people has stopped at seven or eighty thousand ears, and there are still many doubts and unconvinced. Although the number of people who have been exhausted for a long time, they are many, they are not enough to be afraid of. Yu If you have 50,000 soldiers, you will be able to destroy it. May your lord not worry about it."" Quan Fuyu said back: ""Gongjin's words are enough to clear my doubts. Zibu has no plans, and he is deeply disappointed; Duqing and Zijing, together with Gu Concentric ears. Qing Ke, Zijing and Cheng Pushou choose troops to advance. Gu should continue to send troops, carry more resources, and answer for the queen. If the army in front of Qing is unsatisfactory, you will be alone. There is no doubt about the decisive battle."" Zhou Yu thanked him and said to himself, ""Kongming has long anticipated the heart of Wuhou. His plan is higher than mine. It will be a disaster for Jiangdong for a long time, so it is better to kill him."" He entered the tent and said that he wanted to kill Kongming. Su said: ""No, now that the thieves are not broken, kill the wise men first, and then go to their aid."" Yu said, ""This man will help Liu Bei, and it will be a disaster for Jiangdong."" Su said: ""Zhuge Jin is his own brother. , wouldn't it be wonderful to recruit this person to work with Soochow?"" Yu was good at his words.","Returning to his rooms, Zhou Yu informs Kong Ming of the decision by Sun and is very surprised to see a look of concern on Kong Ming’s face. When he asks why, Kong Ming says, ‘Your Lord still has not finally made up his mind and until he does there is no point in making plans!’ Zhou Yu is astonished. ‘What on earth do you mean, he “has not finally made up his mind”?’ To this Kong Ming replies that Sun Quan is still terrified by the apparent disparity in the number of troops available, convinced that Cao Cao has so many he can easily destroy Sun’s troops. ‘Before you can make any plans you must reassure him, and the only way to do this is to go through the numbers and types of troops at Cao Cao’s command.’ Convinced by this, Zhou Yu returns to Sun’s quarters and discovers that Kong Ming is absolutely right about Sun’s anxieties, so he lays out for his lord the realities involved. ‘It is said that Cao Cao has a million-strong army. Well, let’s examine that. His own northern troops actually number around 150,000, and they are exhausted. The troops who were with Yuan Shao and were forcibly conscripted into his army number about 80,000 and have no commitment to Cao Cao. Because of this, with 50,000 men I can break them.’ Sun Quan thanks his commander and says he is now without fear, so let battle commence, ‘ And if necessary I will face Cao Cao man to man in battle!’ Zhou Yu leaves, happy that this is now resolved, but also deeply disturbed. What troubles Zhou Yu is that Kong Ming has clearly got a better understanding not only of strategy but also of the very mind of Sun Quan. He can see that Kong Ming’s brilliance could spell real trouble for him in the future. So he starts to think about how to remove him – how to have him killed. That evening, he shares this with a shocked Lu Su, who replies that this would certainly be a terrible mistake while the struggle with Cao Cao remains. Instead, he suggests that they ask Kong Ming’s brother Zhuge Jin to try to win Kong Ming away from Xuande and into the service of Sun Quan. Calmer now, Zhou Yu agrees.","When Zhou Yu reached his own place, he sent for Zhuge Liang to consult over the business in hand. He told Zhuge Liang of the decision that had been taken and asked for a plan of campaign. “But your master has not yet made up his mind,” said Zhuge Liang. “Till he has, no plan can be decided upon.” “What do you mean?” “In his heart, Sun Quan is still fearful of Cao Cao's numbers and frets over the inequality of the two armies. You will have to explain away those numbers and bring him to a final decision before anything can be effected.” “What you say is excellent,” said Zhou Yu, and he went to the palace that night to see his master. Sun Quan said, “You must have something of real importance to say if you come like this at night.” Zhou Yu said, “I am making my dispositions tomorrow; you have quite made up your mind?” “The fact is,” said Sun Quan, “I still feel nervous about the disparity of numbers. Surely we are too few. That is really all I feel doubtful about.” “It is precisely because you have this one remaining doubt that I am come. And I will explain. Cao Cao's letter speaks of a million of marines, and so you feel doubts and fears and do not wait to consider the real truth. Let us examine the case thoroughly. We find that he has of central regions' soldiers, say, some one hundred fifty thousand troops, and many of them are sick. He only got seventy or eighty thousand northern soldiers from Yuan Shao, and many of those are of doubtful loyalty. Now these sick men and these men of doubtful loyalty seem a great many, but they are not at all fearsome. I could smash them with fifty thousand soldiers. You, my lord, have no further anxiety.” Sun Quan patted his general on the back, saying, “You have explained my difficulty and relieved my doubts. Zhang Zhao is an old fool who constantly bars my expeditions. Only you and Lu Su have any real understanding of my heart. Tomorrow you and Lu Su and Cheng Pu will start, and I shall have a strong reserve ready with plentiful supplies to support you. If difficulties arise, you can at once send for me, and I will engage with my own army.” Zhou Yu left; but in his innermost heart he said to himself, “If that Zhuge Liang can gauge my master's thoughts so very accurately, he is too clever for me and will be a danger. He will have to be put out of the way.” Zhou Yu sent a messenger over to Lu Su to talk over this last scheme. When he had laid it bare, Lu Su did not favor it. “No, no,” said Lu Su, “it is self-destruction to make away with your ablest officer before Cao Cao shall have been destroyed.” “But Zhuge Liang will certainly help Liu Bei to our disadvantage.” “Try what his brother Zhuge Jin can do to persuade him. It would be an excellent thing to have these two in our service.” “Yes, indeed,” replied Zhou Yu."

Guan and Zhang were displeased and said, ""Kong Ming is young, he has so much talent! The elder brother treats him too much! I haven't seen his real effect!"" Xuande said, ""I have obtained Kong Ming, just like a fish obtaining water. Brother, please don't say more."" Guan and Zhang Jian said, and retreated without a word. One day, someone brought a yak tail, and Xuande took the tail and tied a hat himself. When Kong Ming saw it, he said with a serious expression: ""Ming Ming has no further ambitions, but that's all it is?"" Xuan Fu threw his hat on the ground and thanked him, ""I'll talk about it so that I can forget my worries."" Kong Ming said, ""Ming Ming has How should you compare Cao Cao?"" Xuande said, ""It's not as good."" Kong Ming said, ""The public of the Duke of Ming is only a few thousand people. If Cao's troops arrive, why should they welcome them?"" Xuande said, ""I am worried about this matter. I haven't got a good strategy."" Kong Ming said, ""You can recruit militiamen quickly, and you can teach them to deal with the enemy."" Xuande then recruited the people of Xinye and got 3,000 people. Kong Ming taught the formation method day and night.","Now, it is no secret that Guan Yu and Zhang Fei are very unhappy at Xuande choosing Kong Ming as his adviser. This troubles Kong Ming, who asks Xuande to give him the insignia of authority – a sword and seal. This will show that Kong Ming has the authority to command. Cao Cao’s army of over one hundred thousand soldiers are advancing upon Xinye, and this is going to be the first test of Kong Ming’s skills.","The advent of Zhuge Liang and the extravagant deference shown him did not please Liu Bei's sworn brothers who grumbled, saying, “He is very young, although he is clever and learned. Our brother really treats him too well. We have not seen any evidence of his wonderful skill.” Liu Bei replied, “You do not know his worth. I have him as if the fish has got into the water again. Pray do not discuss this matter further, my brothers.” They withdrew, silent but dissatisfied. One day a man presented Liu Bei with a yak's tail, and he at once put it in his cap as an ornament. Zhuge Liang came in and noticed it at once. “Then you have renounced all ambitions, my lord; you are just going to attend to this sort of thing,” Zhuge Liang quietly remarked. Liu Bei snatched off his cap and flung it away, saying, “I was only amusing myself with the thing.” “How do you think you stand compared with Cao Cao?” asked Zhuge Liang. “Inferior.” “Yes; your army is less than ten thousand, and the chances are ten thousand to one that he will attack. How can we meet him?” “I am greatly distressed about it; but I see no way.” “You might recruit and I will train them. Then we might be able to oppose him.” So recruiting began and three thousand were enlisted. Zhuge Liang set about drilling them diligently."

却說劉玄德軍到，見孔融。融曰：“曹兵勢大，操又善於用兵，未可輕戰。且觀其動靜，然後進兵。”玄德曰：“但恐城中無糧，難以久持。備令雲長、子龍領軍四千，在公部下相助；備與張飛殺奔曹營，逕投徐州去見陶使君商議。”融大喜，會合田楷，為掎角之勢；雲長、子龍領兵兩邊接應。是日玄德、張飛引一千人馬殺入曹兵寨邊。正行之間，寨內一聲鼓響，馬軍步軍，如潮似浪，擁將出來。當頭一員大將，乃是于禁，勒馬大叫：“何處狂徒！往那裏去！”張飛見了，更不打話，直取于禁。兩馬相交，戰到數合，玄德掣雙股劍麾兵大進，于禁敗走。張飛當前追殺，直到徐州城下。城上望見紅旗白字，大書“平原劉玄德”，陶謙急令開門。玄德入城，陶謙接着，共到府衙。禮畢，設宴相待，一壁勞軍。陶謙見玄德儀表軒昂，語言豁達，心中大喜，便命糜竺取徐州牌印，讓與玄德。玄德愕然曰：“公何意也？”謙曰：“今天下擾亂，王綱不振，公乃漢室宗親，正宜力扶社稷。老夫年邁無能，情願將徐州相讓。公勿推辭。謙當自寫表文，申奏朝廷。”玄德離席再拜曰：“劉備雖漢朝苗裔，功微德薄，為平原相猶恐不稱職；今為大義，故來相助；公出此言，莫非疑劉備有吞併之心耶？若舉此念，皇天不佑！”謙曰：“此老夫之實情也。”再三相讓，玄德那裏肯受。糜竺進曰：“今兵臨城下，且當商議退敵之策。待事平之日，再當相讓可也。”玄德曰：“備當遣書於曹操，勸令解和。操若不從，廝殺未遲。”於是傳檄三寨，且按兵不動；遣人齎書以達曹操。,"But he said that Liu Xuande's army arrived and saw Kong Rong. Rong said: ""Cao's army is strong, and Cao is good at using them, so he can't fight lightly. Let's watch his movements and then advance his army."" Xuande said: ""But I'm afraid that there will be no food in the city, and it will be difficult to last for a long time. Prepare Yunchang and Zilong to be prepared. Lead four thousand troops and help under the public servants; prepare to kill Zhang Fei and go to Cao’s camp, and go to Xuzhou to see Tao Shijun to discuss.” Rong Da was overjoyed, and joined Tian Kai, for the situation of chasing Jiao; Yun Chang and Zilong led the troops to support them . On that day, Xuande and Zhang Fei led a thousand troops to the edge of Cao Bingzhai. On the way, there was a sound of drums in the village, and the horse army and infantry, like a wave, came out with a general. The first general, Yu Jin, stopped his horse and shouted, ""Where is the madman! Go there!"" Zhang Fei saw it, and he didn't even bother, and took it directly to Yu Jin. The two horses crossed each other, and the battle came to a close. Xuande slammed the double-strand sword into the army, and Yu Jin was defeated and left. Zhang Fei is currently chasing him until the city of Xuzhou. Seeing the red flag and white characters on the city, the big book ""Pingyuan Liu Xuande"", Tao Qian urgently ordered the door to open. Xuande entered the city, Tao Qian followed, and went to the government office together. After the ceremony, a banquet was held to treat each other, and the army was full of labor. Tao Qian was overjoyed when he saw Xuande's high-spirited appearance and open-minded language, so he ordered Mi Zhu to take the Xuzhou badge and give it to Xuande. Xuande was stunned and said: ""What is your intention?"" Qian said: ""Today's disturbances, Wang Gang is inactive, the prince is a kin of the Han family, and it is appropriate to help the community. The old man is old and incompetent, and would rather give Xuzhou to him. Don't refuse. He wrote his own manifesto and made a memorial to the court."" Xuande left the table and paid homage again, saying: ""Although Liu Bei is a descendant of the Han Dynasty Miao, his merits and virtues are weak, and he is still afraid of being incompetent for the Pingyuan Prime Minister; this is a great righteousness, so he came to help; the public said this. Do you suspect that Liu Bei has the intention of annexation? If you think of this, the emperor will not bless you!"" Qian said: ""This old man's true situation."" Three more concessions, Xuande is willing to accept. Mi Zhujin said: ""Now that the troops are under the city, we should discuss the strategy of retreating the enemy. When things are peaceful, we should give in."" Xuande said: ""Bei should send a letter to Cao Cao to persuade him to make peace. If Cao does not obey It's not too late to fight."" So he spread the order to the three villages, and kept his troops still; he sent people to write letters to reach Cao Cao.","Once inside the city, Xuande is asked by Kong Rong to join him in coming to the assistance of Tao Qian and oppose Cao Cao ’s murderous assault on the province. As Kong Rong had done, Xuande raises the fact that he has no quarrel personally with Cao Cao. But Kong Rong, now convinced they must resist Cao Cao’s devastating invasion, persuades him to come to the beleaguered province’s assistance. Having given his word that he will join Kong Rong, Xuande returns to his base to recruit more men. Among those he asks to join him is Zhao Zilong. When Xuande joins the others at Xuzhou, he suggests that he try one last attempt at appealing to Cao Cao to understand that the murder of Cao’s family had nothing to do with Tao Qian.","Presently Liu Bei came up and went to see Kong Rong, who said, “The enemy is very powerful, and Cao Cao handles his army skillfully. We must be cautious. Let us make most careful observations before we strike a blow.” “What I fear is famine in the city,” said Liu Bei. “They cannot hold out very long. I will put my troops with yours under your command, while I with Zhang Fei make a dash through to see Tao Qian and consult with him.” Kong Rong approved of this, so he and Tien Kai took up positions on the ox-horn formation, with Guan Yu and Zhao Yun on either side to support them. When Liu Bei and Zhang Fei leading one thousand troops made their dash to get through Cao Cao's army, they got as far as the flank of his camp when there arose a great beating of drums, and horse and foot rolled out like billows on the ocean. The leader was Yu Jin. He checked his steed and called out, “You mad men from somewhere, where are you going?” Zhang Fei heard Yu Jin but deigned no reply. He only rode straight to attack the speaker. After they had fought a few bouts, Liu Bei waved his double swords as signal for his troops to come on, and they drove Yu Jin before them. Zhang Fei led the pursuit and in this way they reached the city wall. From the city wall the besieged saw a huge banner embroidered in white “Liu Bei of Pingyuan,” and the Imperial Protector bade them open the gate for the rescuers to enter. Liu Bei was made very welcome, conducted to the residency, and a banquet prepared in his honor. The soldiers also were feasted. Tao Qian was delighted with Liu Bei, admiring his high-spirited appearance and clear speech. Tao Qian bade Mi Zhu offer Liu Bei the seal and insignia of the protectorship office. But Liu Bei shrank back startled. “What does this mean?” said Liu Bei. Tao Qian said, “There is trouble on every side, and the kingly rule is no longer maintained. You, Sir, are a member of the family and eminently fitted to support them and their prerogatives. I am verging on senility, and I wish to retire in your favor. I pray you not to decline, and I will report my action to the court.” Liu Bei started up from his seat and bowed before his host saying, “Scion of the family I may be, but my merit is small and my virtue meager. I doubt my fitness even for my present post, and only a feeling of doing right sent me to your assistance. To hear such speech makes me doubt. Surely you think I came with greed in my heart. May God help me no more if I cherished such a thought.” “It is a poor old man's real sentiment,” said Tao Qian. Time after time Tao Qian renewed his offer to entrust the region of Xuzhou to Liu Bei, but Liu Bei kept refusing. In the midst of this came Mi Zhu, saying, “The enemies had reached the wall, and something must be done to drive them off. The present matter could await a more tranquil time.” Said Liu Bei, “I ought to write to Cao Cao to press him to raise the siege. If he refuses, we will attack forthwith.” Orders were sent to the three camps outside to remain quiescent till the letter could reach Cao Cao."

捱到天曉，再欲整頓下山衝突，忽見一人跑馬上山來，視之乃張遼也。關公迎謂曰：“文遠欲來相敵耶？”遼曰：“非也：想故人舊日之情，特來相見。”遂棄刀下馬，與關公敍禮畢，坐於山頂。公曰：“文遠莫非說關某乎？”遼曰：“不然：昔日蒙兄救弟，今日弟安得不救兄？”公曰：“然則文遠將欲助我乎？”遼曰：“亦非也。”公曰：“旣不助我，來此何幹？”遼曰：“玄德不知存亡，翼德未知生死。昨夜曹公已破下邳，軍民盡無傷害，差人護衞玄德家眷，不許驚擾。如此相待，弟特來報兄。”關公怒曰：“此言特說我也。吾今雖處絕地，視死如歸。汝當速去，吾卽下山迎戰。”張遼大笑曰：“兄此言豈不為天下笑乎？”公曰：“吾仗忠義而死，安得為天下笑？”遼曰：“兄今卽死，其罪有三。”公曰：“汝且說我那三罪？”遼曰：“當初劉使君與兄結義之時，誓同生死；今使君方敗，而兄卽戰死，倘使君復出，欲求兄相助，而不可復得，豈不負當年之盟誓乎：其罪一也。劉使君以家眷付託於兄，兄今戰死，二夫人無所依賴，負却使君依託之重：其罪二也。兄武藝超羣，兼通經史，不思共使君匡扶漢室，徒欲赴湯蹈火，以成匹夫之勇，安得為義：其罪三也。兄有此三罪，弟不得不告。”,"When it was dawn, when he was trying to rectify the conflict down the mountain, he suddenly saw a man running up the mountain, and he regarded him as Zhang Liao. Guan Gong greeted him and said, ""Wen Yuan wants to come to face the enemy?"" Liao said, ""No, I want to meet you because of the old love of the old man."" Then he abandoned his sword and dismounted from his horse. Gong asked: ""Wen Yuan is not talking about something?"" Liao said, ""Otherwise: In the past, my brother was saved by my brother, but today is my brother Anto not saving my brother?"" Gong said, ""Then will Wen Yuan want to help me?"" Liao said. ""That's not true either."" The Duke said, ""If you don't help me, why are you here?"" Liao said, ""Xuande does not know whether he will live or die, and Yide does not know whether he will live or die. Last night, Duke Cao broke down Xiapi, and there was no harm to the army or civilians. People protect Xuande's family and don't let them disturb you. Treat each other like this, and my younger brother will come to report to my brother."" Guan Gong said angrily, ""This statement is especially for me. Although I am in a dead land now, I see death as home. You should go quickly, and I will go down the mountain to fight. Zhang Liao laughed and said, ""Isn't my brother's words laughing for the world?"" Gong said, ""I die with loyalty and righteousness, so I can laugh for the world in peace?"" Liao said, ""Brother died today, and there are three crimes."" He said, ""You tell me about my three sins?"" Liao said, ""In the beginning, when Liu Shijun and his brother became righteous, they vowed to live and die together; now that the emperor is defeated, and the elder brother died in battle, if the emperor returns and wants to ask his brother for help, he If it cannot be recovered, is it not worth the oath of the old year: it is one crime. Liu Shijun entrusted his family to his brother, who died in battle today, and the two ladies have nothing to rely on. My brother has excellent martial arts skills, and also has a good knowledge of the history of the scriptures. He does not think of the common lord to help the Han family. He wants to go through fire and water, and he has the courage to become a common man. He is righteous: there are three crimes. Brother has these three crimes, and the brother has to sue.""","As the dawn comes up the next day, Guan Yu is preparing a suicide attack down the hill when a lone rider is spotted, spurring his way up the hill. It is Zhang Liao. When he and Guan Yu meet, Zhang Liao speaks warmly of the time Guan Yu saved his life, and that this is why he is here now, to try to do the same for Guan Yu. Guan Yu thinks this means he has brought troops to join Guan Yu in his struggle, but Zhang Liao has to disillusion him. ‘ So why are you here, then?’ asks a confused Guan Yu. ‘We’ve no idea what has happened to Xuande. The same is true for Zhang Fei. What is known is that last night Cao Cao took Xiapi and that he has placed a special guard over Xuande’s family to protect them.’ ‘If this is meant to impress me,’ says Guan Yu, ‘it doesn’t. I would rather die than surrender, for death would be a homecoming for me. Go now, because shortly I will ride into battle.’ Zhang Liao bursts out laughing. ‘Do you want to be mocked by the entire empire?’ Guan Yu replies, ‘As I’ll die doing my duty, I think the world won’t see this as much of a joke.’ ‘But if you die here,’ says Zhang Liao, ‘you’ll have committed three errors.’ ‘And what exactly would those be?’ queries a troubled Guan Yu. ‘Firstly, you promised your brothers that you would die together when you made your joint vow. Your brother, it is true, has been defeated, but you plan to go and be killed! What if Xuande survives and wants your help? What use will your vow be then! Secondly, his family was placed in your care. If you die now, then his wives will be unprotected, and you’ll have betrayed him. Thirdly, you’re not just a warrior but also steeped in the Classics. You all swore to protect the Han dynasty, yet you seem willing to throw this away in order to die! How does that help anyone? These are your three errors.’ Guan Yu questions Zhang Liao: ‘So those are your three errors.","At daybreak he prepared for one more effort, but before moving he saw a horseman riding up at full speed and presently discerned Zhang Liao. When within speaking distance, Guan Yu said, “Are you come to fight me, Zhang Liao?” “No,” replied Zhang Liao. “I am come to see you because of our old friendship.” Wherefore Zhang Liao threw aside his sword, dismounted, and came forward saluting. And the two sat down. “Then naturally you have come to talk me over,” said Guan Yu. “Not so.” said Zhang Liao. “Sometime ago you saved me; can I help saving you?” “Then you desire to help me.” “Not exactly that,” replied Zhang Liao. “Then what are you doing here if you have not come to help me?” “Nothing is known of the fate of your elder brother, nor whether your younger brother is alive or dead. Last night your city fell into the hands of Cao Cao, but neither soldiers nor people were harmed, and a special guard was set over the family of Liu Bei lest they should be alarmed. I came to tell you how well they had been treated.” “This is certainly talking me over,” said Guan Yu. “Though escape is impossible yet I am not perturbed. I look upon death as going home. You would better depart quickly and let me go down and begin the struggle again.” “Surely you must know everybody will ridicule you when they hear of this,” said Zhang Liao. “I shall die for loyalty and righteousness. Who will laugh?” said Guan Yu. “You would be guilty of three faults if you died.” “Tell me them,” said Guan Yu. “First of all, you and your elder brother pledged yourselves in the Peach Garden to die or to live together. Now your brother has been defeated, and you want to fight to the death. Therefore, if your brother appear again by and by and wants your help, he will seek it in vain. Is this anything else than betraying the Peach Garden Oath? Secondly, you are in charge of your brother's family and, if you fought and died, the two women would be left forlorn and without a protector. That would be a betrayal of trust. Thirdly, your military skill stands out conspicuous and will go down in history. If you do not aid your brother in his noble attempt to maintain the dynasty, then all your labors and sufferings will have been spent to win a worthless reputation as a valiant fool. Where is the sense in that? I feel it my duty to point out these three faults to you.” Guan Yu remained silent and thought for some time."
正商論間，忽報公子劉琦來見。玄德接入。琦泣拜曰：“繼母不能相容，性命只在旦夕，望叔父憐而救之。”玄德曰：“此賢姪家事耳，奈何問我？”孔明微笑，玄德求計於孔明。孔明曰：“此家事，亮不敢與聞。”少時，玄德送琦出，附耳低言曰：“來日我使孔明回拜賢姪，可如此如此，彼定有妙計相告。”琦謝而去。次日，玄德只推腹痛，乃浼孔明代往回拜劉琦。孔明允諾，來至公子宅前，下馬入見公子。公子邀入後堂。茶罷，琦曰：“琦不見容於繼母，幸先生一言相救。”孔明曰：“亮客寄於此，豈敢與人骨肉之事：倘有漏泄，為害不淺。”說罷，起身告辭。琦曰：“旣承光顧，安敢慢別。”乃挽留孔明入密至共飲。飲酒之間，琦又曰：“繼母不見容，乞先生一言救我。”孔明曰：“此非亮所敢謀也。”言訖，又欲辭去。琦曰：“先生不言則已，何便欲去？”孔明乃復坐。琦曰：“琦有一古書，請先生一觀。”乃引孔明登一小樓。孔明曰：“書在何處？”琦泣拜曰：“繼母不見容，琦命在旦夕，先生忍無一言相救乎？”孔明作色而起，便欲下樓，只見樓梯已撤去。琦告曰：“琦欲求敎良策，先生恐有泄漏，不肯出言；今日上不至天，下不至地，出君之口，入琦之耳：可以賜敎矣。”孔明曰：“‘疏不間親’，亮何能為公子謀？”琦曰：“先生終不幸敎琦乎！琦命固不保矣，請卽死於先生之前。”乃掣劍欲自刎。孔明止之曰：“已有良計。”琦拜曰：“願卽賜敎。”孔明曰：“公子豈不聞申生、重耳之事乎：申生在內而亡，重耳在外而安。今黃祖新亡，江夏乏人守禦，公子何不上言，乞屯兵守江夏，則可以避禍矣。”琦再拜謝敎，乃命人取梯送孔明下樓。孔明辭別，回見玄德，具言其事，玄德大喜。,"During the discussion of business affairs, Liu Qi, the son of Liu Qi, suddenly came to see him. Xuande joins. Qi cried and said: ""My stepmother can't be compatible, her life is only at the end of the day. I hope my uncle will take pity and save her."" Xuande said: ""This virtuous lady has family affairs, why do you ask me?"" Kong Ming smiled, and Xuande asked Kong Ming for advice. Kong Ming said, ""Liang dared not hear about this family matter."" When he was young, Xuande sent Qi out and whispered in his ear: ""I will send Kong Ming back to pay homage to the virtuous wife in the future, but if this is the case, he will definitely have a good plan to tell him."" Qi thanked and left. The next day, Xuande only suffered from abdominal pain, so he went back to pay tribute to Liu Qi in the Ming Dynasty. Kong Ming promised to come to the son's house and dismount to see the son. The son was invited into the back hall. After tea was over, Qi said, ""Qi did not see her stepmother, thank you sir to help me."" Kong Ming said, ""Liang guest is sent here, how dare you have a relationship with people: if there is a leak, the harm will not be light."" After saying that, Get up and say goodbye. Qi said, ""You are here to visit me, and I dare to say goodbye slowly."" So he kept Kongming in secret until they shared a drink. While drinking, Qi said again: ""My stepmother doesn't see her face, Mr. Qi has a word to save me."" Kong Ming said, ""This is not what Liang dared to plan."" After saying this, he wanted to resign. Qi said, ""Sir, if you don't speak, why do you want to go?"" Kong Ming sat down again. Qi said, ""Qi has an ancient book, please read it sir."" Kong Ming said, ""Where is the book?"" Qi cried and said, ""My stepmother is not in sight, and Qi's life is on the verge of death, so Master can't help me without a word?"" Kong Ming got up and wanted to go downstairs, but the stairs had been withdrawn. . Qi said: ""Qi wants to ask for a good policy, but the teacher is afraid that there will be leaks, so he won't say anything. Today, he can't go up to the sky, and he can't go down to the ground. He goes out of the king's mouth and into Qi's ears: you can give me some advice."" Kong Ming said: "" 'If you can't get close to each other', how can Liang seek for your son?"" Qi said, ""Sir, it's unfortunate to teach Qi in the end! Qi's life is not guaranteed, please die before the teacher."" Kong Ming stopped and said, ""There is a good plan."" Qi Bai said, ""I would like to teach you."" Kong Ming said, ""Young master, didn't you hear about Shen Sheng and Chong'er: Shen was born inside and died, and Chong'er was outside and peaceful. Now that Huang Zu is dead, and Jiangxia has no one to guard him, why don't you speak up and ask for troops to guard Jiangxia, then you can avoid the disaster."" Qi again bowed to Xie Ji, and ordered someone to take a ladder to escort Kong Ming downstairs. Kong Ming said goodbye, and returned to see Xuande, telling him what happened, and Xuande was overjoyed.","As he is speaking, Liu Qi, the eldest son of Liu Biao, arrives and asks to speak with Kong Ming and Xuande. ‘My life is in danger,’ he says. ‘My stepmother Lady Cai wants to kill me. Please, Imperial Uncle, can you help me?’ After this first, frankly rather embarrassing meeting with its unexpected and unwelcome request, both Xuande and Kong Ming try to avoid either meeting or helping the young man. But his sheer persistence overcomes them, and eventually Kong Ming gives him the following advice. ‘Get away from your stepmother and from her son. Ask to be sent to Jiangxia to take over protecting the area now Huang Zu is dead. That way, you will be beyond the evil reach of your stepmother.’ When Liu Biao asks Xuande’s advice as to whether to let his eldest son go to Jiangxia, he, of course, says he thinks it is a very good idea.","Soon after the son of the Imperial Protector, Liu Qi, was announced, and Liu Bei received him and led him in. The young man began to weep, saying, “My mother cannot bear the sight of me. My very life is in danger. Can you not save me, Uncle?” “My worthy nephew, this is a family affair. You should not come to me.” Zhuge Liang who was present, smiled. Liu Bei turned to him to know what he should do. “This is a family affair; I cannot touch it!” replied Zhuge Liang. The young man soon left; and when Liu Bei was saying good-bye, he whispered, “I will get Zhuge Liang to return your call, and you can do so and so. He will advise you.” Liu Qi thanked him and left. Next day when the call was to be returned, Liu Bei pretended to be suffering from colic and made that an excuse to send Zhuge Liang to return the call. The adviser went, and when he had reached the Palace, dismounted, and was led in, Liu Qi conducted him into one of the inner rooms and when the tea had been brought, said, “I am an object of my stepmother's dislike; can you advise me what to do?” “As a mere stranger guest, I can hardly have anything to do with your own 'bone and flesh' matters. If I did, and the story got abroad, much harm might ensue.” With this he rose to take leave. But Liu Qi was unwilling to say farewell. He said, “Your glory has turned in my direction; you cannot mean to go away so pointlessly.” Liu Qi led his visitor into a private chamber and had refreshments brought. While they ate and drank, Liu Qi repeated his first request: what was he to do since his stepmother disliked him. “It is not the sort of thing I can advise in,” replied Zhuge Liang, as he rose for the second time to take leave. “Master, if you will not reply, that is well. But why incontinently leave me?” So the adviser once more seated himself, and Liu Qi said, “There is an ancient writing I should like to show you.” And he led his visitor to a small upper room. “Where is the writing?” said Zhuge Liang. Instead of answering Liu Qi wept, saying, “My stepmother cannot bear me; my life is in danger. O Master, will you not say a word to save me?” Zhuge Liang flushed and rose to go away. But he found the ladder by which they had mounted had been removed. Again Liu Qi besought some advice, saying, “Master, you fear lest it may get abroad! Is that why you are silent? Here we are between earth and sky, and what you say will come out of your mouth directly into my ear. No other soul can hear. Now can you tell me what to do?” “Sow not dissension among relatives,” said Zhuge Liang. “Is it possible for me to make any plan for you?” “Then is my life indeed in danger,” said the young man. “I will die at your feet.” So saying, Liu Qi pulled out a dagger and threatened to make an end of himself. Zhuge Liang checked him, saying, “There is a way.” “I pray you tell me.” “You have heard of the old tale of the brothers Shen Sheng and Chong Er, have you not? Shen Sheng stayed at home and died; his brother Chong Er went away and lived in peace. Now that Huang Zu is gone and Jiangxia is weakly defended, why do you not ask to be sent there to guard it? Then you would be out of the way of harm.” Liu Qi thanked him. Then he called to his people to restore the ladder, and he escorted Zhuge Liang down to the level ground. Zhuge Liang returned to Liu Bei and related the whole interview."
且說黃蓋臥於帳中，諸將皆來動問。蓋不言語，但長吁而已。忽報參謀闞澤來問。蓋令請入臥內，叱退左右。闞澤曰：“將軍莫非與都督有讎？”蓋曰：“非也。”澤曰：“然則公之受責，莫非苦肉計乎？”蓋曰：“何以知之？”澤曰：“某觀公瑾舉動，已料着八九分。”蓋曰：“某受吳侯三世厚恩，無以為報，故獻此計，以破曹操。吾雖受苦，亦無所恨。吾遍觀軍中，無一人可為心腹者。惟公素有忠義之心，敢以心腹相告。”澤曰：“公之告我，無非要我獻詐降書耳。”蓋曰：“實有此意。未知肯否？”闞澤欣然領諾。正是：,"Besides, Huang Gai was lying in the tent, and all the generals came to ask questions. Gai didn't speak, but just groaned. Suddenly reported to staff Kan Ze to ask. Gai Ling, please go into the bedroom and recoil left and right. Kan Ze said, ""Could it be that the general has a relationship with the governor?"" Gai said: ""No."" Ze said: ""But if the public is to be blamed, is it not a bitter plan?"" Gai said: ""How do you know it?"" Ze said: ""Someone Gong Jin's actions have been predicted by eight or nine points."" Gai said: ""A certain received the generous favor of Wuhou III, but he could not repay it, so he offered this plan to defeat Cao Cao. Although I suffered, I did not hate it. I watched the army all over the place. Among them, there is no one who can be a confidant. But the duke has a loyal heart, and dares to tell him as a confidant."" Ze said: ""The public sue me, I just want me to offer fraud and surrender."" Gai said: ""I really have this intention. I don't know if I'm willing?"" Kan Ze gladly accepted the promise. Exactly:","Later that night, as Huang Gai lies recovering in his tent, Kan Ze, one of the military advisers, comes to see him and tells how he too has realized this is all a trick. When Huang Gai asks for Kan Ze’s help in carrying out the ruse, he is only too happy to help. What Huang Gai needs is someone to take his letter offering to defect to Cao Cao. Kan Ze readily agrees.","Meanwhile Huang Gai lay in his tent, whither all his colleague officers went to condole with him and inquire after his health. But Huang Gai would say never a word; he only lay sighing deeply from time to time. But when the Strategist Kan Ze came, Huang Gai told them to bring him to the room where he lay. Then he bade the servants go away, and Kan Ze said, “Surely you must have some serious quarrel with the General.” “I have none,” said Huang Gai. “Then this beating is just part of a ruse?” “How did you guess?” said Huang Gai. “Because I watched the General, and I guessed about nine tenths of the truth.” Huang Gai said, “You see I have been very generously treated by the Sun family, all three of them, and have no means of showing my gratitude except by offering to help in this ruse. True I suffer, but I do not regret that. Among all those I know in the army, there is not one I am intimate with except yourself. You are true and I can talk with you as a friend.” “I suppose you wish me to present your surrender letter to Cao Cao; is that it?” “Just that; will you do it?” said Huang Gai. Kan Ze consented joyfully. Even the warrior's body is but a stake in the game,"

張繡家人密報繡。繡怒曰：“操賊辱我太甚！”便請賈詡商議。詡曰：“此事不可洩漏。來日等操出帳議事，如此如此。”次日，操坐帳中，張繡入告曰：“新降兵多有逃亡者，乞移屯中軍。”操許之，繡乃移屯其軍，分為四寨，刻期舉事。因畏典韋勇猛，急切難近，乃與偏將胡車兒商議。那胡車兒力能負五百斤，日行七百里，亦異人也。當下獻計於繡曰：“典韋之可畏者，雙鐵戟耳。主公明日可請他來吃酒，使盡醉而歸。那時某便溷入他跟來軍士數內，偷入帳房，先盜其戟，此人不足畏矣。”繡甚喜，預先準備弓箭、甲兵，告示各寨。至期令賈詡致意請典韋到寨，慇懃待酒。至晚醉歸，胡車兒雜在衆人隊裏，直入大寨。是夜曹操於帳中與鄒氏飲酒，忽聽帳外人言馬嘶，操使人觀之。回報是張繡軍夜巡，操乃不疑。時近二更，忽聞寨內吶喊，報說草車上起火。操曰：“軍人失火，勿得驚動。”須臾，四下裏火起，操始着忙，急喚典韋。韋方醉臥，睡夢中聽得金鼓喊殺之聲，便跳起身來，却尋不見了雙戟。時敵兵已到轅門，韋急掣步卒腰刀在手。只見門首無數軍馬，各挺長鎗，搶入寨來。韋奮力向前，砍死二十餘人。軍馬方退，步軍又到，兩邊鎗如葦列。韋身無片甲，上下被數十鎗，兀自死戰。刀砍缺不堪用，韋卽棄刀，雙手提着兩個軍人迎敵，擊死者八九人。羣賊不敢近，只遠遠以箭射之。箭如驟雨，韋猶死拒寨門。爭奈寨後賊軍已入，韋背上又中了一鎗，乃大叫數聲，血流滿地而死。死了半晌，還無一人敢近前門而入者。,"Zhang embroidery family secretly reported embroidery. Xiu said angrily, ""It's too much insulting me to be a thief!"" So he asked Jia Xu to discuss it. Xu said: ""This matter must not be leaked. In the future, I will wait for Cao to go out to the tent to discuss matters."" The next day, when Cao was sitting in the tent, Zhang Xiu entered and reported: ""There are many fleeing troops from the newly surrendered troops, and they are begging to move the army in the center. ""As promised, Embroidery moved his army and divided it into four villages. Because he was afraid of Dian Wei's bravery and eagerness to approach, he discussed with the general Hu Che'er. That Hu Che'er can carry 500 jins and travel 700 li a day, which is not like anyone else. Immediately, he offered a plan to Xiu and said: ""Dian Wei's fearsome man has two iron halberd ears. The lord can invite him to drink tomorrow, so that he will be drunk and return. Fang, steal his halberd first, this person is not to be afraid of.” Embroidered very happy, prepared bows and arrows, armored soldiers in advance, and announced to the villages. On the due date, Jia Xu greeted Dian Wei and invited Dian Wei to the village and served the wine diligently. In the evening, when he returned drunk, Hu Che'er was mixed with the crowd and went straight to Dazhai. It was that night Cao Cao was drinking with the Zou family in the tent, and suddenly he heard the horse's neighing from outside the tent, and Cao sent people to watch it. The reward was the night patrol of Zhang Xiu's army, and there was no doubt about it. When it was nearly two watch, I suddenly heard shouting in the village, reporting that the grass cart was on fire. Cao said: ""The soldiers are on fire, don't be alarmed."" After a few moments, fires started to spread everywhere, Cao began to rush, and urgently called Dian Wei. Wei Fang was drunk, and in his sleep he heard the sound of the golden drum shouting to kill, so he jumped up, but could not find the halberd. At that time, the enemy soldiers had arrived at the Yuanmen Gate, and Wei Ji had the infantry's waist knife in his hand. I saw countless military horses at the head of the gate, each with a long spear, rushing into the village. Wei pushed forward and hacked more than 20 people to death. The army and horses retreated, and the infantry arrived again, with guns on both sides like reeds. Wei had no armor, was shot dozens of times from top to bottom, and fought to the death. The knife was unusable for chopping, so Wei You abandoned the knife and faced the enemy with two soldiers in both hands, killing eight or nine people. The group of thieves did not dare to approach, but only shot them with arrows from a distance. The arrows were like a torrential rain, and Wei You died and refused the gate of the village. After Zhengnai Village, the bandit army had entered, and Wei was shot in the back again. After being dead for a long time, no one dared to enter the front door.","Zhang Xiu is deeply offended by the love affair and, using Cao Cao ’s distraction by the beautiful woman, attacks Cao Cao’s camp at dead of night. His personal guard, Dian Wei, once again comes to his rescue. With no weapon or armour, he seems an easy target for the attackers. But, grabbing a sword from one of the soldiers, he fights back, killing twenty men straight away. As enemy swords slash him, he fights on until his sword shatters. Then he simply picks up two of the bodies of the dead enemy and, using them as weapons, slays many more. In the end it takes archers and an attack from behind with spears to bring him down. Collapsing, he gives a great cry and dies.","But people told Zhang Xiu what had gone amiss, and he was angry at the shame brought upon the family. He confided his trouble to Jia Xu who said, “Keep this secret, wait till he appears again to carry on business, and then do so and so.” A plan was arranged quite secretly. Next day Zhang Xiu went into Cao Cao's tent, saying, “Since the surrendered troops are deserting in great number, it would be well to camp them in the center of your camp to prevent this.” Cao Cao gave the permission, and Zhang Xiu moved and placed his army in four camps. But Dian Wei, the especial guard of Cao Cao's tent, was a man to be feared, being both brave and powerful. It was hard to know how to attack him. So counsel was taken with Hu Juer, the commander of one camp and a man of enormous strength and activity. He could carry a burden of six hundred pounds and two hundred miles in a day. Hu Juer proposed a plan. He said, “The fearsome thing about Dian Wei is his double halberds. But get him to come to a party and make him quite drunk before you send him back. I will mingle among his escort and so get into his tent and steal away his weapons. One need not fear him then.” So the necessary arms were prepared and orders given in the various camps. This done Zhang Xiu gave a banquet, and the intended victim was invited and plied vigorously with wine so that he was quite intoxicated when he left. And, as arranged, Hu Juer mingled with his escort and made away with his weapons. That night, when Cao Cao was at supper with Lady Zhou, he heard the voices of men and neighing of horses and sent out to ask what it meant. They told him it was the night patrol going the rounds, and he was satisfied. Near the second watch of the night again was heard some noise in the rear of his tent, and one of the fodder carts was reported to be burning. “One of the soldiers has dropped a spark; there is nothing to be alarmed at,” said Cao Cao. But very soon the fire spread on all sides and became alarming. Cao Cao called Dian Wei. But he, usually so alert, was lying down quite intoxicated. However, the beating of gongs and rolling of drums mingling with his dreams awoke Dian Wei, and he jumped up. His trusty halberds had disappeared. The enemy was near. He hastily snatched up an infantryman's sword and rushed out. At the gate he saw a crowd of spearmen just bursting in. Dian Wei rushed at them slashing all around him, and twenty or more fell beneath his blows. The others drew back. But the spears stood around him like reeds on the river bank. Being totally without mail, he was soon wounded in several places. He fought desperately till his sword snapped and was no longer of any use. Throwing it aside he seized a couple of soldiers and with their bodies as weapons felled ten of his opponents. The others dared not approach, but they shot arrows at him. These fell thick as rain, but he still maintained the gate against the assailants. However, the mutineers got in by the rear of the camp, and they wounded Dian Wei in the back with spear thrusts. Uttering a loud cry he fell. The blood gushed from the wound in torrents, and he died. Even after he was dead not a man dared to come in by the main gate."
細作探知虛實，報至官渡。曹軍新到，聞之皆懼。曹操與衆謀士商議。荀攸曰：“紹軍雖多，不足懼也。我軍俱精銳之士，無不一以當十。但利在急戰。若遷延日月，糧草不敷，事可憂矣。”操曰：“所言正合吾意。”遂傳令軍將鼓譟而進。紹軍來迎，兩邊排成陣勢。審配撥弩手一萬，伏於兩翼；弓箭手五千，伏於門旗內：約礮響齊發。三通鼓罷，袁紹金盔金甲，錦袍玉帶，立馬陣前。左右排列着張郃、高覽、韓猛、淳于瓊等諸將。旌旗節鉞，甚是嚴整。曹陣上門旗開處，曹操出馬。許褚、張遼、徐晃、李典等，各持兵器，前後擁衞。曹操以鞭指袁紹曰：“吾於天子之前，保奏你為大將軍；今何故謀反？”紹怒曰：“汝託名漢相，實為漢賊！罪惡彌天，甚於莽、卓，乃反誣人造反耶！”操曰：“吾今奉紹討汝！”紹曰：“吾奉衣帶詔討賊！”操怒，使張遼出戰。張郃躍馬來迎。二將鬥了四五十合，不分勝負。曹操見了，暗暗稱奇。許褚揮刀縱馬，直出助戰。高覽挺鎗接住。四員將捉對兒廝殺。曹操令夏侯惇、曹洪，各引三千軍，齊衝彼陣。審配見曹軍來衝陣，便令放起號礮：兩下萬弩並發，中軍內弓箭手一齊擁出陣前亂射。曹軍如何抵敵，望南急走。袁紹驅兵掩殺，曹軍大敗，盡退至官渡。,"Make careful work to find out the truth and report to Guandu. Cao Jun's new arrival, he was terrified when he heard it. Cao Cao discussed with his advisors. Xun You said: ""Although Shao's army is large, it is not enough to be afraid of. Our army has all the elite soldiers, and all of them should be ten. But the advantage is in the urgent battle. If the sun and the moon are delayed, the food and grass will not be enough, and things will be worrying."" Cao said : ""What I said is exactly what I want."" Then he ordered the generals to rush in. The Shao army came to greet him, and the two sides lined up. There are ten thousand crossbowmen, who are placed on both wings; five thousand archers, who are placed in the gate flag. After the three-way drum, Yuan Shao's golden helmet and golden armor, brocade robe and jade belt, immediately came to the front. Zhang He, Gao Lan, Han Meng, Chunyu Qiong and other generals were lined up left and right. The festival of flags and flags is very strict. Cao Cao came to the gate and the flag opened, and Cao Cao came out. Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Xu Huang, Li Dian, etc., each armed with weapons, supported the front and rear. Cao Cao pointed at Yuan Shao with the whip and said, ""Before the Son of Heaven, I will protect you as a great general; why did you rebel now?"" Shao said angrily, ""You are named Han Prime Minister, but you are actually a Han traitor! It is falsely accusing people of rebelling!"" Cao said, ""I will ask Shao to ask you now!"" Shao said, ""I will ask Zhang Liao to fight the thieves!"" Cao was angry and sent Zhang Liao to fight. Zhang He jumped to welcome him. The two generals fought forty or fifty times, and there was no winner. When Cao Cao saw it, he was secretly amazed. Xu Chu swung his saber and rode his horse straight out to help. Gao Lan caught the gun. The four will catch the pair and fight. Cao Cao ordered Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong to lead 3,000 troops each to charge them in unison. When Shen Pei saw Cao's army coming to rush into the formation, he ordered the horns to be set up: two thousand crossbows were fired simultaneously, and the archers in the Chinese army rushed out and shot indiscriminately. How did Cao's army meet the enemy, Wang Nan hurried away. Yuan Shao drove his troops to cover up the attack, and Cao's army was defeated and retreated to Guandu.","It is a huge army that Yuan Shao leads out and heads towards Guandu. In response Cao Cao can only muster about one-tenth the number, but he sets out too. When news of the scale of Yuan Shao’s army reaches Cao Cao his adviser Xun You urges immediate action. ‘Our men are veterans and can take on ten of theirs, but our supplies are very limited and will run out quickly if this is a prolonged campaign. Attack now,’ he says. Cao Cao concurs with this and so he advances upon Yuan Shao’s army. Confronting each other, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao trade abuse. ‘I had the Son of Heaven make you a supreme commander – and now you have turned rebel!’ shouts Cao Cao. ‘You might pretend to be the prime minister,’ replies Yuan Shao, ‘but you are nothing but a traitor to the Han. The stink of your crimes even reaches Heaven and you claim I’m the traitor!’ ‘I have the imperial authority to punish you,’ cries Cao Cao, to which Yuan Shao replies, ‘And I have the secret imperial command that was hidden in the belt as my authority!’ So battle commences. Champions ride out, but none triumphs, and then the armies clash head on. It is Cao Cao who breaks first and retreats, defeated by the sheer number of the enemy’s arrows. He and his men return to camp outside Guandu.","Scouts and spies were sent out to discover the strong and the weak points of the enemy. Cao Cao's army arrived and were smitten with fear when they heard of the strength of their enemy. The leader called together his council. Then said Adviser Xun You, “The enemy are many but not terrible. Ours is an army of veterans, every soldier of ours worth ten of theirs; but our advantage lies in a speedy battle, for unhappily our stores are insufficient for a long campaign.” “You speak to the point,” said Cao Cao. “I think the same.” Therefore Cao Cao issued orders to press noisily forward and force on a battle. Yuan Shao's soldiers took up the challenge, and the two sides were arrayed. On Yuan Shao's side, Shen Pei placed ten thousand of crossbowmen in ambush on the two wings, while five thousand of archers held the center. The signal for general attack was a bomb, and the onset was to continue through three rolls of the drum. Yuan Shao wore a silver helmet and breastplate and an embroidered robe held in by a jeweled belt. He took up his post in the center with his commanders—Gao Lan, Zhang He, Han Meng, Chunyu Qiong, and others—ranged right and left. His banners and ensigns made a brave show. When Cao Cao's army's center opened and the banners moved aside, the chieftain appeared on horseback with his staff of doughty leaders all fully armed—Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Xu Huang, Li Dian, and others. Pointing with his whip at Yuan Shao, Cao Cao cried, “In the presence of the Emperor, I pressed your claims to consideration and obtained for you the title of Regent Marshal; why do you now plan rebellion?” Yuan Shao replied, “You take the title of a minister of Han, but you are really a rebel against the House. Your crimes and evil deeds reach to the heavens, and you are worse than the usurper Wang Mang and the rebel Dong Zhuo. What are these slanderous words about rebellion that dare you address to me?” “I have a command to make you prisoner!” “I have the Girdle Decree to arrest rebels!” replied Yuan Shao. Then Cao Cao became wrathful and bade Zhang Liao ride forth as his champion. From the other side rode Zhang He on a curvetting steed. The two champions fought four or five bouts with no advantage to either. In his heart Cao Cao thought the contest amazing. Then Xu Chu whirled up his sword and went to help. From the other side, to match him rode out Gao Lan with his spear set, and the contestants were now four, battling two and two. Then Cao Cao ordered three thousand troops under Xiahou Dun and Cao Hong to attack the opponents' array. Thereupon on Yuan Shao's side, Shen Pei gave the signal for attack, and the legion of crossbowmen on the wings shot and the center archers let fly all together. The arrows flew all over the field in front, and Cao Cao's troops could not advance. They hastened away toward the south. Yuan Shao threw his soldiers on their rear, and they were broken."
肅領命來見孔明。孔明曰：“吾曾告子敬，休對公瑾說，他必要害我。不想子敬不肯為我隱諱，今日果然又弄出事來。三日內如何造得十萬箭？子敬只得救我！”肅曰：“公自取其禍，我如何救得你？”孔明曰：“望子敬借我二十隻船，每船要軍士三十人，船上皆用靑布為幔，各束草千餘個，分布兩邊。吾別有妙用。第三日包管有十萬枝箭。只不可又敎公瑾得知；若彼知之，吾計敗矣。”肅允諾，却不解其意，回報周瑜，果然不提起借船之事；只言孔明並不用箭竹、翎毛、膠漆等物，自有道理。瑜大疑曰：“且看他三日後如何回覆我！”,"Su took orders to see Kongming. Confucius said: ""I told Zijing, Xio said to Gongjin that he would harm me. I don't want Zijing to hide it for me, but today something happened again. How can I make 100,000 arrows in three days? Zijing only Save me!"" Su said, ""Your Excellency caused the disaster, how can I save you?"" Kong Ming said, ""Wangzijing borrowed me twenty boats, each with thirty soldiers. There are more than 1,000 herbs in each bunch, and they are distributed on both sides. I don’t know how to use it. On the third day, I guarantee that there will be 100,000 arrows. I just have to teach Gong Jin about it again; if he knows about it, my plan will be defeated.” Su promised, but was puzzled. His intention was to repay Zhou Yu, and he did not mention the matter of borrowing a boat; he just said that Kongming did not use arrows, bamboo, feathers, glue paint, etc., which made sense. Yu said suspiciously, ""Let's see how he will reply to me in three days!""","Deeply troubled and distressed, Lu Su goes after Kong Ming and finds him lamenting his fate. ‘I told you not to say anything to Zhou Yu,’ says Kong Ming, ‘and now he is even more determined to kill me. That’s why he made me fall into this trap! How on earth am I going to produce one hundred thousand arrows in such a short time! You must help me!’ Lu Su says, ‘Well, frankly, it’s your own fault, but tell me, what can I do to help?’ ‘Lend me twenty boats with thirty men to each boat. I want a thousand straw bales covered with black cloth. If my plan works we’ll have all the arrows ready by the third day. But not a word to Zhou Yu! Otherwise this won’t work.’ So a somewhat bewildered Lu Su returns and tells Zhou Yu that Kong Ming doesn’t seem to need any raw materials for making the arrows. This leaves Zhou even more confused than before.","So off went Lu Su to seek Zhuge Liang, who at once reproached him with having blabbed about the former business. Zhuge Liang said, “He wants to hurt me, as you know, and I did not think you could not keep my secret. And now there is what you saw today and how do you think I can get a hundred thousand arrows made in three days? You will simply have to rescue me.” “You brought the misfortune on yourself, and how can I rescue you?” said Lu Su. “I look to you for the loan of twenty vessels, manned each by thirty people. I want blue cotton screens and bundles of straw lashed to the sides of the boats. I have good use for them. On the third day, I have undertaken to deliver the fixed number of arrows. But on no account must you let Zhou Yu know, or my scheme will be wrecked.” Lu Su consented and this time he kept his word. He went to report to his chief as usual, but he said nothing about the boats. He only said, “Zhuge Liang is not using bamboo or feathers or glue or varnish, but has some other way of getting arrows.” “Let us await the three days' limit,” said Zhou Yu, puzzled though confident."
白髮漁樵江渚上，,"On the river Nagisa, the white-haired fisherman,",,
玄德領衆出城三十里，接着呂布，並馬入城。都到州衙廳上，講禮畢，坐下。布曰：“某自與王司徒計殺董卓之後，又遭傕、汜之變，飄零關東，諸侯多不能相容。近因曹賊不仁，侵犯徐州，蒙使君力救陶謙，布因襲兗州以分其勢；不料反墮奸計，敗兵折將。今投使君，共圖大事，未審尊意如何？”玄德曰：“陶使君新逝，無人管領徐州，因令備權攝州事。今幸將軍至此，合當相讓。”遂將牌印與呂布。呂布却待要接，只見玄德背後關、張二公各有怒色。布乃佯笑曰：“量呂布一勇夫，何能作州牧乎？”玄德又讓。陳宮曰：“‘強賓不壓主’，請使君勿疑。”玄德方止。遂設宴相待，收拾宅院安下。次日，呂布回席請玄德，玄德乃與關、張同往。飲酒至半酣，布請玄德入後堂。關、張隨入。布令妻女出拜玄德。玄德再三謙讓。布曰：“賢弟不必推讓。”張飛聽了，瞋目大叱曰：“我哥哥是金枝玉葉，你是何等人，敢稱我哥哥為賢弟！你來！我和你鬥三百合！”玄德連忙喝住，關公勸飛出。玄德與呂布陪話曰：“劣弟酒後狂言，兄勿見責。”布默默無語。須臾席散。布送玄德出門，張飛躍馬橫鎗而來，大叫：“呂布！我和你併三百合！”玄德急令關公勸止。次日呂布來辭玄德曰：“蒙使君不棄，但恐令弟輩不能相容。布當別投他處。”玄德曰：“將軍若去，某罪大矣。劣弟冒犯，另日當令陪話。近邑小沛，乃備昔日屯兵之處。將軍不嫌淺狹，權且歇馬，如何？糧食軍需，謹當應付。”呂布謝了玄德，自引軍投小沛安身去了。玄德自去埋怨張飛不題。,"Xuande led the crowd out of the city for thirty li, followed by Lü Bu, and entered the city on horseback. They all went to the prefectural hall, finished the ceremony, and sat down. Bu said: ""Since a certain person and Wang Situ planned to kill Dong Zhuo, they were changed by Jui and Si, and they drifted to the east. Yanzhou is trying to divide its power. Unexpectedly, it turned against a traitorous scheme, and the army was defeated. Today, I voted for the emperor, and we planned to do great things together. How about you have no respect for it?"" Xuande said: ""Tao Shijun has just passed away, and no one is in charge of Xuzhou. It's a matter of Shezhou. I'm fortunate that the general is here, and it's a good deal."" Then he marked the card with Lu Bu. Lu Bu was about to pick him up, but behind Xuande, Guan and Zhang Ergong were all angry. Bu Nai feigned a smile and said, ""How can you be a state shepherd if you count Lu Bu as a brave man?"" Xuande asked again. Chen Gong said: ""'A strong guest does not oppress the master', please make your lord not suspicious."" Xuande stopped. Then they set up a banquet to treat each other, cleaned up the house and settled down. The next day, Lu Bu returned to invite Xuande, who went with Guan and Zhang. After drinking until half-intoxicated, Bu invited Xuande into the back hall. Guan and Zhang followed. He ordered his wife and daughter to go out to worship Xuande. Xuande relented again and again. Bu said, ""You don't need to give in."" Zhang Fei heard this, and said with anger: ""My brother is golden branches and jade leaves, what kind of person are you, you dare to call my brother a good brother! Come on! I will fight against you for three lilies! Xuande hurriedly stopped, and Guan Gong persuaded him to fly out. Xuande and Lu Bu accompany him and said: ""The inferior brother is talking wildly after drinking, and the brother is not to blame."" Bu was silent. Disperse in an instant. When the cloth sent Xuande out, Zhang Fei jumped on his horse with a spear and shouted: ""Lu Bu! I and you are three lilies!"" Xuande urgently ordered Guan Gong to stop. The next day, Lv Bu came to say goodbye to Xuande and said: ""Mengshijun will not give up, but I am afraid that my younger brother will not be compatible. Bu should not cast him elsewhere."" Xuande said: ""If the general goes, it will be a serious crime. The inferior brother will offend. , I will accompany you in the next day. Xiaopei, near the city, is the place where the army was stationed in the past. The general is not too shallow, and the authority should stop his horses, how about it? The food and military needs should be dealt with."" Pei An went away. Xuande went to blame Zhang Fei for not being a problem.","In fact, during a banquet that Lü Bu holds to thank Xuande, Zhang Fei takes violent offence at the way Lü Bu addresses Xuande. Arising from his seat and roaring with anger, Zhang Fei challenges Lü Bu to a duel ‘of three hundred rounds’. Xuande commands him to hold his tongue, and Guan Yu shoves him roughly out of the room. Undeterred, Zhang Fei later again challenges Lü Bu. A furious Xuande has to personally go and reprimand him. Not that Zhang Fei shows the slightest remorse, for he hates Lü Bu with a vengeance.","The new Imperial Protector with a great following met Lu Bu ten miles outside the city gates, and the two chiefs rode in side by side. They proceeded to the residence and there, after the elaborate ceremonies of reception were over, they sat down to converse. Said Lu Bu, “After Wang Yun and I plotted to slay Dong Zhuo and my misfortune in the Li Jue and Guo Si's sedition, I drifted about from one place to another, and none of the nobles east of the Huashang Mountains seemed willing to receive me. When Cao Cao with wicked ambition invaded this region and you, Sir, came to its rescue, I aided you by attacking Yanzhou and thus diverting a portion of his force. I did not think then that I should be the victim of a vile plot and lose my leaders and my soldiers. But now if you will, I offer myself to you that we may together accomplish great designs.” Liu Bei replied, “When the late Tao Qian died, there was no one to administer Xuzhou, and so I assumed that task for a time. Now since you are here, General, it is most suitable that I step down in your favor.” Whereupon Liu Bei handed the insignia and the seal of authority to Lu Bu. Lu Bu was on the point of accepting them, when he saw Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, who stood behind the Imperial Protector, glaring at him with angry eyes. So Lu Bu put on a smile and said, “I may be something of a fighting man, but I could not rule a great region like this.” Liu Bei repeated his offer. But Chen Gong said, “The strong guest does not oppress his host. You need not fear, Lord Liu Bei.” Then Liu Bei desisted. Banquets were held and dwelling places prepared for the guest and his retinue. As soon as convenient, Lu Bu returned the feast. Liu Bei went with his two brothers. Half through the banquet Lu Bu requested Liu Bei to retire to one of the inner private rooms, whither Guan Yu and Zhang Fei followed him. There Lu Bu bade his wife and daughter bow as to their benefactor. Here also Liu Bei showed excessive modesty. Lu Bu said, “Good Younger Brother, you need not be so very modest.” Zhang Fei heard what Lu Bu said, and his eyes glared, crying, “What sort of a man are you that dares call our brother 'younger brother'? He is one of the ruling family—a jade leaf on a golden branch. Come out, and I will fight you three hundred bouts for the insult.” Liu Bei hastily checked the impulsive one, and Guan Yu persuaded him to go away. Then Liu Bei apologized, saying, “My poor brother talks wildly after he has been drinking. I hope you will not blame him.” Lu Bu nodded, but said nothing. Soon after the guests departed. But as the host escorted Liu Bei to his carriage, he saw Zhang Fei galloping up armed as for a fray. “Lu Bu, you and I will fight that duel of three hundred bouts!” shouted Zhang Fei. Liu Bei bade Guan Yu check him. Next day Lu Bu came to take leave of his host. “You, O Lord, kindly received me, but I fear your brothers and I cannot agree. So I will seek some other asylum.” “General, if you go, the blame is mine. My rude brother has offended and must eventually apologize. In the meantime what think you of a temporary sojourn at the town where I was encamped for some time, Xiaopei? The place is small and mean, but it is near, and I will see to it that you are supplied with all you need.” Lu Bu thanked him and accepted this offer. He led his troops there and took up residence. After he had gone, Liu Bei buried his annoyance, and Zhang Fei did not again refer to the matter."

The Taishi in the time room ordered Wang Li to call Zongzheng Liu Ai privately and said: ""I look up at the astronomy, and since last spring, Taibai has committed a crime against the stars and bullfighting, and when I crossed Tianjin, I am confused and retrograde. Come out. I see that the qi of the Han Dynasty will come to an end, and in the Jin and Wei lands, there will be people who thrive.” He also secretly wrote to the emperor and said: “The mandate of heaven will go away, and the five elements will not always flourish. It is the earth that replaces the fire. It should be in Wei."" When Cao heard about it, he ordered someone to stand up and say: ""Zhi Gong is loyal to the imperial court, but the way of heaven is far-reaching, so fortunately don't say much."" Cao told Yu accordingly. Yu said: ""Han is the king of fire virtue, and Duke Ming is the life of the earth. Xudu belongs to the earth, and when he arrives there, it will flourish. Fire can generate soil, and soil can flourish wood: it is exactly what Dong Zhao and Wang Li said. There will be prosperity in the future. The person."" The intention was decided. The next day, when he went to see the emperor, he said: ""East Capital has been abandoned for a long time and cannot be repaired; it is also difficult to transport food. Xudu is close to Luyang, and the city's palace has enough money, grain, and civilian goods for backup. : Only Your Majesty will obey."" The emperor did not dare to refuse to obey; all the ministers were afraid of manipulating the situation, and none of them dared to disagree, so they chose a day to drive. Cao led the army to protect the line, and all officials obeyed.","It is Dong Zhao who suggests to Cao Cao that the emperor be moved to Xuchang in order that only Cao Cao will be in control, squeezing out others such as Yang Feng, who fear Cao Cao. Together they plan how to extract the emperor without upsetting the other commanders. ‘ Just say there is more food in Xuchang,’ advises Dong Zhao. ‘That will placate everyone.’ The emperor has the plan put to him and, frankly unable to disagree with such a strong man as Cao Cao, he gives his assent. En route to Xuchang, Yang Feng, alarmed at his loss of control over the emperor, tries to stop the procession by placing his army across the pathway.","Thereafter Cao Cao and his advisers secretly discussed the change of capital. Now as to that Court Counselor Wang Li, who was an astrologer, said to Liu Ai, Chair of the Imperial Office, “I have been studying the stars. Since last spring Venus has been nearing the Guard star in the neighborhood of the Measure, and the Cowherd (the Great Bear and Vega) crossing the River of Heaven. Mars has been retrograding and came into conjunction with Venus in the Gate of Heaven, so that Metal (Venus) and Fire (Mars) are mingled. Thence must emerge a new ruler. The aura of the Hans is exhausted, and the ancient states of Jin and Wei must increase.” A secret memorial was presented to the Emperor, saying: “The Mandate of Heaven has its course and the five elements—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth—are out of proportion. Earth attacking Fire is Wei attacking Han, and the successor to the empire of Han is in Wei.” Cao Cao heard of these sayings and memorials and sent a man to the astrologer to say, “Your loyalty is well known, but the ways of Heaven are past finding out. The less said the better.” Then Cao Cao discussed with Xun Yu. The adviser expounded the meaning thus: “The virtue of Han was fire; your element is earth. Xuchang is under the influence of earth, and so your fortune depends on getting there. Fire can overcome earth, as earth can multiply wood. Dong Zhao and Wang Li agree, and you have only to hide your time.” So Cao Cao made up his mind. Next day at court he said, “The capital is deserted and cannot be restored nor can it be supplied easily with food. Xuchang is a noble city, resourceful and close to Luyang, a grain basin. It is everything that a capital should be. I venture to request that the court move thither.” The Emperor dared not oppose and the officials were too overawed to have any independent opinion, so they chose a day to set out. Cao Cao commanded the escort, and the officials all followed."

董卓自納貂蟬後，為色所迷，月餘不出理事。卓偶染小疾，貂蟬衣不解帶，曲意逢迎，卓心愈喜。呂布入內問安，正值卓睡。貂蟬於牀後探半身望布，以手指心，又以手指董卓，揮淚不止。布心如碎。卓朦朧雙目，見布注視牀後，目不轉睛；回身一看，見貂蟬立於牀後。卓大怒，叱布曰：“汝敢戲吾愛姬耶！”喚左右遂出，今後不許入堂。呂布怒恨而歸，路遇李儒，告知其故。儒急入見卓曰：“太師欲取天下，何故以小過見責温侯？倘彼心變，大事去矣。”卓曰：“奈何？”儒曰：“來朝喚入，賜以金帛，好言慰之，自然無事。”卓依言。次日，使人喚布入堂，慰之曰：“吾前日病中，心神恍惚，誤言傷汝，汝勿記心。”隨賜金十斤，錦二十疋。布謝歸；然身雖在卓左右，心實繫念貂蟬。,"Since Dong Zhuo accepted Diaochan, he was fascinated by sex, and he did not serve as a director for more than a month. Zhuo Ou suffers from minor illnesses, Diao Chan's clothes are inextricably linked, and Zhuo Xin is happier. Lu Bu went inside to say hello, just as Zhuo was sleeping. Diao Chan leaned halfway behind the bed to look at the cloth, with the heart of his finger, and then with Dong Zhuo, weeping. The cloth is heartbroken. Zhuo Menglong's eyes were fixed when he saw Bu looking behind the bed; when he turned around, he saw Diaochan standing behind the bed. Zhuo was furious and shouted, ""You dare to play with my love Ji!"" He called left and right and left, and will not be allowed to enter the hall from now on. Lü Bu was angry and returned, and he met Li Ru and told him the reason. Confucianism rushed to see Zhuo and said, ""The Grand Master wants to take over the world, so why do you blame Marquis Wen for his small mistakes? If his heart changes, the big thing will be gone."" Zhuo said, ""Why?"" With gold and silk, you can comfort them with good words, and nothing will happen."" Zhuo Yiyan said. The next day, someone called Bu into the hall, comforting him and saying, ""The day before yesterday, I was in a trance and I was in a trance. I made a mistake and hurt you. Don't remember it."" Bu Xie returned; although he was around Zhuo, his heart was thinking of Diaochan.","Over the next month, Dong Zhuo becomes entirely besotted with Diao Chan, so much so that he ignores his official work. When he falls ill, Diao Chan sits beside him night and day to minister to him. One day when Lü Bu comes in to see how he is, he finds Dong Zhuo asleep and Diao Chan, spotting him, silently makes it clear that she is in distress and has eyes only for him. Lü Bu is deeply moved and at just that moment Dong Zhuo awakes and sees that Lü Bu is staring fixedly at a spot behind the bed. Turning round quickly, he sees Diao Chan standing there. ‘Are you trying to seduce my lover?’ he cries and he has Lü Bu thrown out. Now Lü Bu is really enraged. On his way home he runs into Adviser Li Ru and tells him what has happened. Immediately Li Ru rushes off to see Dong Zhuo and pleads with him to make amends with Lü Bu. ‘Otherwise such a split will spell disaster for us all,’ he says. ‘So what do you recommend?’ asks Dong Zhuo. ‘I suggest you call him back tomorrow and shower him with expensive gifts and sing his praises.’ The next day Dong Zhuo summons Lü Bu, apologizes and plies him with presents. However, although Lü Bu thanks him, from that day on, while his body might be at the service of Dong Zhuo, his heart is with Diao Chan. One day, Lü Bu, clad in his armour and on guard duty, notices that Dong Zhuo is having an audience with the emperor. And so he takes the opportunity to slip out and ride off to the prime minister’s palace. Tying his horse to the front hitching post and carrying his halberd, he makes his way to Diao Chan’s apartment. ‘Leave straight away,’ she whispers urgently. ‘ But go to the Phoenix Garden, where I will meet you.’","Dong Zhuo now thought of nothing but his new mistress and for more than a month neglected all affairs, devoting himself entirely to pleasure. Once he was a little indisposed, and Diao Chan was constantly at his side, never even undressing to show her solicitude. She gratified his every whim. Dong Zhuo grew more and more fond of her. One day Lu Bu went to inquire after his father's health. Dong Zhuo was asleep, and Diao Chan was sitting at the head of his couch. Leaning forward she gazed at the visitor, with one hand pointed to her heart, the other at Dong Zhuo asleep, and her tears fell. Lu Bu felt heartbroken. Dong Zhuo drowsily opened his eyes; and seeing his son's gaze fixed on something behind him, he turned over and saw who it was. He angrily rebuked his son, saying, “Dare you make love to my beauty?” He told the servants to turn Lu Bu out, shouting, “Never let him enter here again!” Lu Bu went off home very wrath. Meeting Li Ru, he told Li Ru the cause of his anger. The adviser hastened to see his master and said, “Sir, you aspire to be ruler of the empire, why then for a small fault do you blame the General? If he turns against you, it is all over.” “Then what can I do?” said Dong Zhuo. “Recall him tomorrow; treat him well; overwhelm him with gifts and fair words; and all will be well.” So Dong Zhuo did so. He sent for Lu Bu and was very gracious and said, “I was irritable and hasty yesterday owing to my illness and I wronged you, I know. Forget it.” He gave Lu Bu three hundred ounces of gold and twenty rolls of brocade. And so the quarrel was made up. But though Lu Bu's body was with his adopted father Dong Zhuo, his heart was with his promised bride Diao Chan."
次日，操傳令各營將領：“如三日內不併力破城，皆斬！”操親自至城下，督諸軍搬土運石，填壕塞塹，城上矢石如雨，有兩員裨將畏避而回，操掣劍親斬於城下，遂自下馬接土填坑。於是大小將士無不向前，軍威大振。城上抵敵不住。曹兵爭先上城，斬關落鎖，大隊擁入。李豐、陳紀、樂就、梁剛都被生擒。操令皆斬於市；焚燒偽造宮室殿宇、一應犯禁之物；壽春城中，收掠一空；商議欲進兵渡淮，追趕袁術。荀彧諫曰：“年來荒旱，糧食艱難，若更進兵，勞軍損民，未必有利；不若暫回許都，待來春麥熟，軍糧足備，方可圖之。”操躊躇未決。忽報馬到，報說：“張繡依託劉表，復肆猖獗；南陽、江陵諸縣復反；曹洪拒敵不住，連輸數陣，今特來告急。”操乃馳書與孫策，令其跨江布陣，以為劉表疑兵，使不敢妄動；自己卽日班師，別議征張繡之事。臨行，令玄德仍屯兵小沛，與呂布結為兄弟，互相救助，再無相侵。呂布領兵自回徐州。操密謂玄德曰：“吾令汝屯兵小沛，是‘掘坑待虎之計’也。公但與陳珪父子商議，勿致有失。某當為公外援。”話畢而別。,"The next day, Cao sent an order to the generals of each battalion: ""If we do not break down the city together within three days, we will all behead!"" Cao personally went to the city, supervising the army to move earth and rocks, fill the trenches and block the moat, the arrows on the city were like rain, and there were two men. The general evaded him, slashed himself under the city with his sword, and then dismounted from his horse to pick up the soil and fill the pit. So all the big and small soldiers moved forward, and the army was powerful. The city cannot withstand the enemy. Cao Bing rushed to the city first, cut off the gates and locked up, and the brigade rushed in. Li Feng, Chen Ji, Le Jiu, and Liang Gang were all captured alive. The orders were all beheaded in the city; the forged palaces and palaces were burned, and all the things that should be banned; the Shouchun city was looted; it was discussed that they wanted to enter the army to cross Huai and chase Yuan Shu. Xun Yu admonished: ""In recent years, the drought has made the food difficult. If the army is more advanced, the labor force will hurt the people, and it may not be beneficial; it is better to return to Xudu for a while, until the spring wheat is ripe and the army food is ready."" Cao hesitated. Suddenly, the horse arrived, and the report said: ""Zhangxiu relies on Liu Biao and is rampant again; Nanyang and Jiangling counties are back and forth; Cao Hong is unable to resist the enemy and loses several times in a row. Today is urgent."" Cao Naichi and Sun Ce, He ordered him to set up a formation across the river, thinking that Liu Biao was suspicious of troops, so he did not dare to act rashly; Before leaving, Xuande still stationed Xiaopei and became brothers with Lü Bu, helping each other and never invading each other again. Lü Bu led his troops back to Xuzhou. Secretly called Xuande, he said: ""I ordered Ru to station Xiaopei, which is a 'trick to dig a hole and wait for a tiger'. Gongdan negotiates with Chen Gui and his son, so as not to cause any loss. One should be the public aid."" .","Cao Cao’s men report increased troop activities on the northwest wall, and so Cao Cao orders the attack that night on the southeast wall. At dead of night the men scale the crumbling walls, pull down the wooden stakes and rush in. Then the ambush is sprung. It is a massacre. The triumph of Zhang Xiu’s men is total. It is said that Cao Cao lost fifty thousand soldiers that day. As Cao Cao retreats, Zhang Xiu sends a messenger to Liu Biao, urging him to attack the retreating army and prevent their escape.","Next followed a general order threatening death to all commanders if the city was not taken within three days. Cao Cao in person went up to the very walls to superintend the work of filling up the moat. The defenders kept up constant showers of stones and arrows. Two inferior officers, who left their stations in fear, were slain by Cao Cao himself. Thereafter he went on foot to work with his soldiers and to see that work went on continuously and no one dared be a laggard. Thus encouraged, the army became invincible, and no defense could withstand their onslaught. In a very short time the walls were scaled, the gates battered in, and the besiegers were in possession. The officers of the garrison—Li Feng, Yue Jiu, Liang Gang, and Chen Ji—were captured alive and were executed in the market place. All the paraphernalia of imperial state were burned, and the whole city wrecked. When the question of crossing the river in pursuit of Yuan Shu came up, Xun Yu opposed it, saying, “The country has suffered from short crops for years, and we should be unable to get grain. An advance would weary the army, harm the people, and possibly end in disaster. I advise a return to the capital to wait there till the spring wheat shall have been harvested and we have plenty of food.” Cao Cao hesitated; and before he had made up his mind, there came an urgent message: “Zhang Xiu, with the support of Liu Biao, was ravaging the country all round. There were rebellions in Nanyang and Jiangling, and Cao Hong could not cope with it. Cao Hong had been worsted already in several engagements and was in sore straits.” Cao Cao at once wrote to Sun Ce to command the Great River so as to prevent any move on the part of Liu Biao, while he prepared his army to go to deal with Zhang Xiu. Before marching Cao Cao directed Liu Bei to station at Xiaopei, as he and Lu Bu being as brothers, might help each other. When Lu Bu had left for Xuzhou, Cao Cao said secretly to Liu Bei, “I am leaving you at Xiaopei to dig a 'pitfall for the tiger.' You will only take advice from Chen Deng and Chen Gui, and there can be no mishap. You will find so-and-so your ally when needed.”"

陳震得書自回。關公入內告知二嫂，隨卽至相府，拜辭曹操。操知來意，乃懸迴避牌於門。關公怏怏而回，命舊日跟隨人役，收拾車馬，早晚伺候；分付宅中，所有原賜之物，盡皆留下，分毫不可帶去。次日再往相府辭謝，門首又挂迴避牌。關公一連去了數次，皆不得見；乃往張遼家相探，欲言其事，遼亦託疾不出。關公思曰：“此曹丞相不容我去之意。我去志已決，豈可復留？”卽寫書一封，辭謝曹操。書略曰：,"Chen Zhen got the book back. Guan Gong entered and told the second sister-in-law to follow the swastika to the prime minister's residence and bid farewell to Cao Cao. Knowing the purpose, he hung the evasion card at the door. Guan Gong returned in despair, and ordered the old days to follow the servants, pack up the carriages and horses, and serve them in the morning and evening; all the things that were originally given to the house were left behind, and none of them could be taken with them. The next day, he went to the prime minister's house to say goodbye, and the head of the door put up a evasion card again. Guan Gong went to several times in a row, but he was not able to see him; he went to Zhang Liao's house to visit him and wanted to talk about it, but Liao also couldn't get sick. Guan Gongsi said: ""This means that Prime Minister Cao will not allow me to go. I have decided to go, how can I stay again?"" You wrote a letter to thank Cao Cao. The book says:","Guan Yu then composes a letter to Xuande, explaining that in order to protect his two sisters-in-law he has had no option but to take up service under Cao Cao. He then tells him that, now he knows Xuande is alive and where he is, he is about to set off to bring the two ladies back to Xuande. That very day Guan Yu goes to call upon Cao Cao to remind him of the promise. But Cao Cao knows that this is coming. When Guan Yu arrives at the prime minister’s gate he is told Cao Cao is not at home","Chen Zhen left with this missive, and Guan Yu went to tell the women. Then he proceeded to the Prime Minister's palace to say farewell. But Cao Cao knew what he was coming for, and at the gate Guan Yu found the board intimating that no one could be received. So he had to return. However, he bade his own few soldiers prepare to start at any moment. He also gave orders that everything received from Cao Cao was to be left in the quarters; nothing was to be taken. Next day he again proceeded to the Palace to say farewell to his patron, but again found the board hanging there to show there was no admission. So it was several times; he could never enter. Then he went to see Zhang Liao, but he was indisposed. “This means Cao Cao will not let me go,” thought Guan Yu. “But I am going, and I shall hesitate no longer.” So he wrote this letter:"

次日，孫策引軍到劉繇營前，劉繇引軍出迎。兩陣圓處，孫策把鎗挑太史慈的小戟於陣前，令軍士大叫曰：“太史慈若不是走的快，已被刺死了！”太史慈亦將孫策兜鍪挑於陣前，也令軍士大叫曰：“孫策頭已在此！”兩軍吶喊，這邊誇勝，那邊道強。太史慈出馬，要與孫策決個勝負，策遂欲出。程普曰：“不須主公勞力，某自擒之。”程普出到陣前，太史慈曰：“你非我之敵手，只敎孫策出馬來！”程普大怒，挺鎗直取太史慈。兩馬相交，戰到三十合，劉繇急鳴金收軍。太史慈曰：“我正要捉拿賊將，何故收軍？”劉繇曰：“人報周瑜領軍襲取曲阿，有廬江松滋人陳武，字子烈，接應周瑜入去。吾家基業已失，不可久留。速往秣陵，會薛禮、笮融軍馬，急來接應。”太史慈跟着劉繇退軍，孫策不趕，收住人馬。長史張昭曰：“彼軍被周瑜襲取曲阿，無戀戰之心，今夜正好劫營。”孫策然之，當夜分軍五路，長驅大進。劉繇軍兵大敗，衆皆四紛五落。太史慈獨力難當，引十數騎連夜投涇縣去了。,"The next day, Sun Ce led an army to Liu Yao's camp, and Liu Yao led an army out to meet him. At the circle between the two formations, Sun Ce took Taishi Ci's halberd with his spear in front of the formation, and ordered the sergeant to shout, ""If Taishi Ci hadn't walked fast, he would have been stabbed to death!"" Taishi Ci also carried Sun Ce in front of the formation. , and also made the sergeant shout: ""Sun Ce's head is here!"" Taishi Ci came out and wanted to decide the outcome with Sun Ce, and Ce was about to go out. Cheng Pu said, ""You don't need the master's labor, you can capture him yourself."" Cheng Pu came out to the front of the battle, and Taishi Ci said, ""You are not my opponent, so you only sent Sun Ce to come out!"" Cheng Pu was furious and took out his spear. Tai Shi Ci. The two horses crossed, and the battle reached 30. Liu Yao hurriedly called Jin to withdraw his army. Taishi Ci said: ""I was about to arrest the bandit general, why did I withdraw the army?"" Liu Yao said, ""It was reported that Zhou Yu led the army to attack Qu'a, and there was Chen Wu from Songzi, Lujiang, whose name was Zilie, who joined Zhou Yu. I have already lost it, so I cannot stay for a long time. Hurry up to Moring, and I will meet Xue Li and Zherong's horses, and come quickly to meet them."" Taishi Ci retreated with Liu Yao, but Sun Ce did not rush, so he took the troops. Chang Shi Zhang Zhao said: ""The army was attacked by Zhou Yu to take Qu A, and he has no heart to fight. Tonight just happened to rob the camp."" Liu Yao's army was defeated, and everyone fell into disarray. Taishi Ci was unable to do it alone, so he led a dozen cavalry to Jing County overnight.","Ignoring Liu Yao’s pleas to stop, and with only one other, rather minor commander joining him, Taishi Ci rides out to fight Sun Ce.","Next day Sun Ce led his army to the front of Liu Yao's camp, and the challenge was accepted. The armies were drawn up. Sun Ce hung the short lance he had seized from Taishi Ci at the end of his spear and waved it in front of the line of battle and ordered his soldiers to shout, “If the owner of this had not fled, he would have been stabbed to death.” On the other side they hung out Sun Ce's helmet, and the soldiers shouted back, “Sun Ce's head is here already.” Both sides thus yelled defiance at each other, one side boasting, the other bragging. Then Taishi Ci rode out challenging Sun Ce to a duel to the death, and Sun Ce would have accepted, but Cheng Pu said, “My lord should not trouble himself; I will take him.” And Cheng Pu rode forth. “You are no antagonist for me,” said Taishi Ci. “Tell your master to come out.” This incensed Cheng Pu, who rode at his opponent, and they two fought thirty bouts. The duel was stopped by the gongs of Liu Yao. “Why did you sound the retreat?” said Taishi Ci. “I was just going to capture the wretch.” “Because I have just heard that Que has been captured. Zhou Yu led a surprise force thither, and Chen Wu was in league with him to betray the city. We have no home now. I will hasten to Moling to get the help of Xue Li and Ze Rong to retake the city.” The army retired, Taishi Ci with it, without being pursued. On the other side Zhang Zhao said to Sun Ce, “Zhou Yu's attack is the cause of this move; they are in no mood to fight. A night raid on their camp would finish them.” The army was divided into five divisions for the night surprise and hastened toward the camp where they scored a victory. Their opponents scattered in all directions. Taishi Ci alone made a determined stand, and as he could not withstand a whole army, he fled with ten horsemen to Jingxian."
却說劉繇字正禮，東萊牟平人也，亦是漢室宗親，太尉劉寵之姪，兗州刺史劉岱之弟；舊為揚州刺史，屯於壽春，被袁術趕過江東，故來曲阿。當下聞孫策兵至，急聚衆將商議。部將張英曰：“某領一軍屯於牛渚，縱有百萬之兵，亦不能近。”言未畢，帳下一人高叫曰：“某願為前部先鋒。”衆視之，乃東萊黃縣人太史慈也。慈自解了北海之圍後，便來見劉繇，繇留於帳下。當日聽得孫策來到，願為前部先鋒。繇曰：“你年尚輕，未可為大將，只在吾左右聽命。”太史慈不喜而退。張英領兵至牛渚，積糧十萬於邸閣。孫策引兵到，張英出迎。兩軍會於牛渚灘上。孫策出馬，張英大罵，黃蓋便出與張英戰。不數合，忽然張英軍中大亂，報說寨中有人放火。張英急回軍，孫策引軍前來，乘勢掩殺。張英棄了牛渚，望深山而逃。原來那寨後放火的，乃是兩員健將：一人乃九江壽春人，姓蔣，名欽，字公奕；一人乃九江下蔡人，姓周，名泰，字幼平。二人皆遭世亂，聚人在洋子江中，劫掠為生；久聞孫策為江東豪傑，能招賢納士，故特引其黨三百餘人，前來相投。策大喜，用為車前校尉；收得牛渚邸閣糧食、軍器，并降卒四千餘人，遂進兵神亭。,"However, it is said that Liu Yao has the right character and is a native of Muping, Donglai. . When I heard that Sun Ce's troops were coming, I hurriedly gathered the generals to discuss. The commander Zhang Ying said, ""A certain leader of an army is stationed at Niuzhu. Even if there are a million soldiers, they cannot get close."" Before the words were finished, a person under the tent shouted, ""A certain willing to be the vanguard of the front."" Everyone looked at him. He was Taishi Ci from Huang County, Donglai. After Ci relieved the siege of Beihai, he came to see Liu Yao, who stayed under the tent. I heard that Sun Ce was coming that day, willing to be the pioneer in the front. Yao said: ""You are still young, you are not yet a general, you only obey orders from my side."" Taishi Ci was not happy and withdrew. Zhang Ying led the troops to Niuzhu, and accumulated 100,000 grains in the Di Pavilion. Sun Ce led troops to arrive, and Zhang Ying went out to welcome him. The two armies will meet on Niuzhu Beach. Sun Ce came out, Zhang Ying cursed, and Huang Gai went out to fight Zhang Ying. Suddenly, Zhang Ying's army was in chaos, and it was reported that someone in the village had set fire to it. Zhang Ying hurried back to the army, and Sun Ce led the army to take advantage of the situation to cover up the attack. Zhang Ying abandoned Niu Zhu and fled in the mountains. It turned out that the people who set the fire at the back of the village were two strong generals: one was from Jiujiang Shouchun, surnamed Jiang, given the name Qin, and the courtesy name was Gongyi; Both of them suffered from chaos in the world. They gathered people in the Yangzi River and plundered to make a living. After hearing for a long time that Sun Ce was a hero in Jiangdong, he was able to recruit talents, so he specially invited more than 300 members of his party to join him. Ce was overjoyed, and used it as the captain of the front of the car; he received food and weapons from Niuzhu's residence, and sent more than 4,000 soldiers to the army.","Meanwhile the prefect Liu Yao, a member of the imperial family, hears that news of his ill treatment of Sun Ce’s family has reached Sun Ce. Then news comes that he is on his way with an army. So Liu Yao plans his defences. He sends men to protect the river crossing of Niuzhu, but there they are defeated with huge loss of life. Sun Ce is able to advance and to directly confront Liu Yao and his main army.","The Imperial Protector, Liu Yao, was of Donglai, a scion of the imperial family and brother of the Imperial Protector of Yanzhou, Liu Dai. Liu Yao had long ruled in Yangzhou and headquartered in Shouchun. But Yuan Shu had forced him to flee to the southeast of the Great River. He retired to Que and now was battling with Wu Jing in Linyang. Hearing of the meditated attack on him, Liu Yao summoned his generals to take counsel. Said General Zhang Ying, “I will take an army and entrench at Niuzhu. No army can get past that, whatever its strength.” Zhang Ying was interrupted by another who shouted, “And let me lead the van!” All eyes turned to this man; it was Taishi Ci who, after helping Kong Rong raise the siege of Beihai, had come to serve Liu Yao. Hearing him offer to undertake the hazardous post of van leader, Liu Yao said, “But you are still young and not yet equal to such a charge. Rather stay by my side and await my orders.” Taishi Ci withdrew in disappointment. Soon Zhang Ying led his army to Niuzhu, where the stores of grain located. When Sun Ce approached, Zhang Ying went to meet him, and the two armies faced each other above the Bullock Rapid. Zhang Ying roundly abused his opponent, and Huang Gai rode out to attack him. But before the combat had proceeded far, there arose an alarm of fire in Zhang Ying's camp. Zhang Ying turned back, and then Sun Ce advanced in full force, compelling the enemy to abandon their possession. The defeated general fled to the hills. Now the incendiaries who had brought about this result were two, named Jiang Qin from Shouchun and Zhou Tai from Jiujiang, who in these turbulent times had got together a band of kindred spirits and lived by plundering the country along the Great River. They knew Sun Ce by reputation as a man who treated able people very liberally and wished to join him. So they came with their band, three hundred strong, and helped him in this way as an introduction. Sun Ce welcomed them and gave the leaders rank. After taking possession of the stores of all kinds abandoned by the runaways, and enlisting four thousand of those who surrendered into his own ranks, Sun Ce moved forward to attack Shenting."
却說陳宮臨欲下手殺曹操，忽轉念曰：“我為國家跟他到此，殺之不義。不若棄而他往。”插劍上馬，不等天明，自投東郡去了。操覺，不見陳宮，尋思：“此人見我說了這兩句，疑我不仁，棄我而去；吾當急行，不可久留。”遂連夜到陳留，尋見父親，備說前事；欲散家資，招募義兵。父言：“資少恐不成事。此間有孝廉衞弘，疎財仗義，其家巨富；若得相助，事可圖矣。”,"However, he said that Chen Gonglin wanted to kill Cao Cao, but he suddenly changed his mind and said, ""I came here with him for the sake of the country. It would be unjust to kill him. I would rather abandon him and go."" Caojue didn't see Chen Gong, and thought: ""This person saw me saying these two sentences, and he suspected me of being unkind, so he abandoned me; I should hurry, not stay for a long time."" If you want to disperse family resources, recruit volunteers. The father said: ""I am afraid that it will not be successful. There is a filial and honest Weihong here, who is wealthy and righteous, and his family is very rich; if we can help, things can be done.""","Standing ready to kill Cao Cao, Chen Gong thinks about why he followed this man in the first place. He did it for the good of the country. ‘If I kill him, I will just be adding to the sum of wrong deeds,’ he reflects. ‘So perhaps the only honourable way is to simply abandon him.’ When Cao Cao awakes it is to find that Chen Gong has gone. He muses ruefully on the impact his words must have had on him. ‘My high-handed comments and selfishness must have made him think I am a thug. I must be more careful.’ So he sets off for his family home at great speed.","But Chen Gong reflected, “I joined him to do righteous things. Now if I killed him, I would only do unrighteousness and the people would condemn me. I rather leave in silence.” Rising from his bed before the sunrise, Chen Gong mounted his horse and rode away eastward to his home county of Dongjun. Cao Cao awoke with the day and missed his companion. Thought he, “Chen Gong thinks me brutal because of a couple of egoistic phrases I used, and so he has gone. I ought to push on too and not linger here.” So Cao Cao traveled as quickly as possible toward Qiao. When he saw his father, he related what had happened and said he wanted to dispose of all the family property and enlist soldiers with the money. “Our possessions are but small,” said his father, “and not enough to do anything with. However, there is a graduate here, one Wei Hong, careless of wealth but careful of virtue, whose family is very rich. With his help we might hope for success.”"

※※※,※※※,"But enough unanswered questions arise in Zhao Zilong that, despite the best efforts of Cai Mao to reassure him, he takes his men away from the city and back to Xinye.","After that marvelous life-saving leap over the Tan Torrent, Liu Bei felt elated but rather dazed."
正走之間，見一將手提鐵鎗，背着一口劍，引十數騎躍馬而來。趙雲更不打話，直取那將。交馬只一合，把那將一鎗刺倒，從騎皆走。原來那將乃曹操隨身背劍之將夏侯恩也。曹操有寶劍二口：一名“倚天”，一名“靑釭”；倚天劍自佩之，靑釭劍令夏侯恩佩之。那靑釭劍砍鐵如泥，鋒利無比。當時夏侯恩自恃勇力，背着曹操，只顧引人搶奪擄掠。不想撞着趙雲，被他一鎗刺死，奪了那口劍，看靶上有金嵌“靑釭”二字，方知是寶劍也。雲插劍提鎗，復殺入重圍；回顧手下從騎，已沒一人，只剩得孤身。雲並無半點退心，只顧往來尋覓；但逢百姓，便問糜夫人消息。忽一人指曰：“夫人抱着孩兒，左腿上着了鎗，行走不得，只在前面牆缺內坐地。”,"As he was walking, he saw a man with an iron spear and a sword on his back, leading dozens of prancing horses. Zhao Yun didn't even speak, and took the general directly. When the horse was handed over, he stabbed the general with one shot, and walked away from the horse. It turned out that the general was Xia Houen, the general who carried the sword with Cao Cao. Cao Cao has two swords: one is ""Yi Tian"" and the other is ""靑懭""; the sword of Yitian is worn by himself, and the sword is worn by Xiahou En. The scorpion sword chopped iron like mud and was extremely sharp. At that time, Xia Houen relied on his own strength and carried Cao Cao on his back, only to lead people to plunder and plunder. I didn't want to bump into Zhao Yun and get stabbed to death by him. I took the sword and saw the word ""靑懭"" inlaid on the target, so I knew it was a sword. Yun inserted his sword and carried his spear, and entered the siege again; looking back on his subordinates, there was no one left, and he was left alone. Yun didn't retreat at all, just looking for it; but when he met the common people, he asked Mrs. Mi for news. Suddenly someone pointed and said, ""The madam is holding the baby, with a gun on her left leg, she can't walk, she just sits on the ground in the front wall.""","Zilong hands over Lady Gan to Mi Zhu with orders to take her to Xuande, while he himself turns about and heads back into the battle to try to find Lady Mi and the child. By now Zilong is travelling alone and he dashes here and there searching for Lady Mi and the child. Everyone he meets is asked the same question, ‘Have you seen Lady Mi and the child?’ but no answer comes until at long last someone says, ‘She’s been wounded in the thigh and cannot walk.","Before long he met a leader armed with an iron spear and carrying a sword slung across his back, riding a curvetting steed, and leading ten other horsemen. Without uttering a word Zhao Yun rode straight toward him and engaged. At the first pass Zhao Yun disarmed his opponent and brought him to earth. His followers galloped away. This fallen officer was no other than Xiahou En, Cao Cao's sword-bearer. And the sword on Xiahou En's back was his master's. Cao Cao had two swords, one called Trust in God and the other Blue Blade. Trust in God was the weapon Cao Cao usually wore at his side, the other being carried by his sword-bearer. The Blue Blade would cut clean through iron as though it were mud, and no sword had so keen an edge. Before Zhao Yun thus fell in with Xiahou En, the later was simply plundering, depending upon the authority implied by his office. Least of all thought he of such sudden death as met he at Zhao Yun's hands. So Zhao Yun got possession of a famous sword. The name Blue Blade was chased in gold characters so that he recognized its value at once. He stuck it in his belt and again plunged into the press. Just as he did so, he turned his head and saw he had not a single follower left; he was quite alone. Nevertheless not for a single instant thought he of turning back; he was too intent upon his quest. To and fro, back and forth, he rode questioning this person and that. At length a man said, “A woman with a child in her arms, and wounded in the thigh so that she cannot walk, is lying over there through that hole in the wall.”"
董卓時常使人探聽。是日獲得此詩，來呈董卓。卓曰：“怨望作詩，殺之有名矣。”遂命李儒帶武士十人，入宮弒帝。帝與后、妃正在樓上，宮女報李儒至，帝大驚。儒以鴆酒奉帝，帝問何故。儒曰：“春日融和，董相國特上壽酒。”太后曰：“旣云壽酒，汝可先飲。”儒怒曰：“汝不飲耶？”呼左右持短刀白練於前曰：“壽酒不飲，可領此二物！”唐妃跪告曰：“妾身代帝飲酒，願公存母子性命。”儒叱曰：“汝何人，可代王死？”乃舉酒與何太后曰：“汝可先飲！”后大罵何進無謀，引賊入京，致有今日之禍。儒催逼帝，帝曰：“容我與太后作別。”乃大慟而作歌。其歌曰：,"Dong Zhuo often asked people to listen. I obtained this poem today and presented it to Dong Zhuo. Zhuo said, ""I want to write poems because of my resentment, and I want to kill him."" He then ordered Li Ru to lead ten warriors into the palace to kill the emperor. The emperor, the queen, and the concubine were upstairs. The palace maid reported Li Ruzhi, and the emperor was shocked. Confucianism served the emperor with poison, and the emperor asked why. The Confucian said: ""The spring sun is harmonious, and the country of Dong Xiang is special on the longevity wine."" The Empress Dowager said: ""The Yunshou wine, you can drink it first."" The Confucian said angrily: ""You don't drink it?"" ""If you don't drink longevity wine, you can take these two things!"" Concubine Tang knelt down and said, ""My concubine is drinking on behalf of the emperor, and I hope the public will save the lives of mother and son."" The Confucian said, ""Who are you who can die on behalf of the king?"" He said to the Empress Dowager, ""You can drink it first!"" Afterwards, he scolded He Jin for being unreasonable, and for bringing thieves into the capital, causing today's disaster. Confucianism urged the emperor, and the emperor said, ""Allow me to say goodbye to the queen mother."" Its song says:","These words are reported back to Dong Zhuo, who immediately orders Li Ru to murder the former emperor, his consort and his mother. Li Ru arrives at their home where they are imprisoned and offers them poisoned wine to drink. Knowing what it is, and that they are going to die, the former emperor sings this sad song: Earth is greater than Heaven now; The sun and moon change places. Once I ruled over everything, Now I live on the edges. My life is abbreviated, Seized by others. This disaster is great, And I grieve in vain. To this his consort replies:","Let's not stay in silence when the days pass useless? The messenger, sent by Dong Zhuo from time to time to the palace for news of the prisoners, got hold of this poem and showed it to his master. “So he shows his resentment by writing poems, eh! A fair excuse to put them all out of the way,” said Dong Zhuo. Li Ru was sent with ten men into the palace to consummate the deed. The three were in one of the upper rooms when Li Ru arrived. The Emperor shuddered when the maid announced the visitor's name. Presently Li Ru entered and offered a cup of poisoned wine to the Emperor. The Emperor asked what this meant. “Spring is the season of blending and harmonious interchange, and the Prime Minister sends a cup of the wine of longevity,” said Li Ru. “If it be the wine of longevity, you may share it too,” said Empress He. Then Li Ru became brutally frank. “You will not drink?” asked he. He called the men with daggers and cords and bade the Emperor look at them. “The cup, or these?” said he. Then said Lady Tang, “Let the handmaiden drink in place of her lord. Spare the mother and her son, I pray.” “And who may you be to die for a prince?” said Li Ru. Then he presented the cup to the Empress once more and bade her drink. She railed against her brother, the feckless He Jin, the author of all this trouble. She would not drink. Next Li Ru approached the Emperor. “Let me say farewell to my mother,” begged he, and he did so in these lines:"
瑜卽點兵，要親與曹仁決戰，甘寧曰：“都督未可造次。今曹仁令曹洪據守彝陵，為掎角之勢。某願以精兵三千，逕取彝陵，都督然後可取南郡。”瑜服其論，先敎甘寧引三千兵攻打彝陵。早有細作報知曹仁，仁與陳矯商議，矯曰：“彝陵有失，南郡亦不可守矣。宜速救之。”仁遂令曹純與牛金暗地引兵救曹洪。曹純先使人報知曹洪，令洪出誠誘敵。甘寧引兵至彝陵，洪出與甘寧交鋒。戰有二十餘合，洪敗走。寧奪了彝陵。至黃昏時，曹純、牛金兵到，兩下相合，圍了彝陵。探馬飛報周瑜，說甘寧困於彝陵城中，瑜大驚。程普曰：“可急分兵救之。”瑜曰：“此地正當衝要之處，若分兵去救，倘曹仁引兵來襲，奈何？”呂蒙曰：“甘興霸乃江東大將，豈可不救？”瑜曰：“吾欲自往救之；但留何人在此，代當吾任？”蒙曰：“留凌公續當之。蒙為前驅，都督斷後；不須十日，必奏凱歌。”瑜曰：“未知凌公續肯暫代吾任否？”凌統曰：“若十日為期，可當之；十日之外，不勝其任矣。”瑜大喜，遂留兵萬餘，付與凌統；卽日起大兵投彝陵來。蒙謂瑜曰：“彝陵南僻小路，取南郡極便。可差五百軍去砍倒樹木，以斷其路。彼軍若敗，必走此路；馬不能行，必棄馬而走，吾可得其馬也。”瑜從之，差軍去訖。大兵將至彝陵，瑜問：“誰可突圍而入，以救甘寧？”周泰願往，卽時綽刀縱馬，直殺入曹軍之中，逕到城下。甘寧望見周泰至，自出城迎之。泰言：“都督自提兵至。”寧傳令敎軍士嚴裝飽食，準備內應。却說曹洪、曹純、牛金聞周瑜兵將至，先使人往南郡報知曹仁，一面分兵拒敵。及吳兵至，曹兵迎之。比及交鋒，甘寧、周泰分兩路殺出，曹兵大亂，吳兵四下掩殺。曹洪、曹純、牛金果然投小路而走；却被亂柴塞道，馬不能行，盡皆棄馬而走。吳兵得馬五百餘匹。周瑜驅兵星夜趕到南郡，正遇曹仁軍來救彝陵。兩軍接着，混戰一場。天色已晚，各自收兵。,"Yu Yu ordered troops to fight against Cao Ren in person. Gan Ning said, ""The governor cannot make a second attempt. Now Cao Ren has ordered Cao Hong to guard the tomb of Yi, which is a situation of chasing the corners. A certain wish to use three thousand elite soldiers to take the tomb of Yi directly, and the governor will then follow. Nanjun is preferable."" Yu obeyed his argument and first ordered Gan Ning to lead 3,000 soldiers to attack Yiling. Cao Ren had already reported to Cao Ren with a detailed report, and Ren discussed with Chen Jiao, Jiao said: ""Yiling has lost, and Nanjun cannot be defended. It should be rescued quickly."" Ren then ordered Cao Chun and Niu Jin to secretly lead troops to rescue Cao Hong. Cao Chun first sent someone to report to Cao Hong, and ordered Hong out to lure the enemy. Gan Ning led troops to Yiling, and Hong Chu confronted Gan Ning. After more than twenty battles, Hong defeated and left. Ning took Yiling. At dusk, Cao Chun and Niu Jin arrived, and they both met and surrounded the tomb of Yi. Tan Ma Fei reported to Zhou Yu that Gan Ning was trapped in Yiling City, and Yu was shocked. Cheng Pu said, ""You can quickly divide the troops to save them."" Yu said, ""This is the right place to be rushed. If we divide our troops to rescue them, what if Cao Ren leads them to attack?"" Lü Meng said, ""Gan Xingba is a general in Jiangdong. How can I not save him?"" Yu said, ""I want to save him by myself; but who should I leave here to serve as my role?"" Meng said, ""Let Duke Ling continue to be the leader. Meng is the forerunner, and the governor will cut him off; it doesn't take ten days, he must Play the song of triumph."" Yu said, ""I don't know if Duke Ling will continue to serve me temporarily?"" Ling Tong said, ""If it lasts for ten days, I can serve it; beyond ten days, I won't be able to do it."" Yu was overjoyed, so he kept ten thousand troops. Yu was given to Ling Tong; from the beginning of the day, the troops were thrown into the tomb of Yi. Meng Zuyu said: ""Yiling is remote from a small road in the south, and it is very convenient to take Nanjun. You can send five hundred troops to chop down trees to cut off the road. If the army is defeated, they will take this road; if the horse cannot move, they must abandon the horse and go. , I can get its horse."" Yu followed and sent troops to finish. When the army was approaching Yiling, Yu asked, ""Who can break through the siege to save Ganning?"" Gan Ning saw Zhou Taizhi and went out of the city to welcome him. Taiyan said: ""The governor has sent troops to the place."" Ning Chuan ordered the sergeants to wear full clothes and prepare for internal response. But they said that Cao Hong, Cao Chun, and Niu Jin heard that Zhou Yu's army was approaching, so they first sent people to Nanjun to report Cao Ren, and then divided their troops to resist the enemy. When Wu soldiers arrived, Cao soldiers welcomed them. Compared with the confrontation, Gan Ning and Zhou Tai attacked in two ways. Cao Hong, Cao Chun, and Niu Jin really threw the road and walked away; Wu Bing got more than 500 horses. Zhou Yu drove his troops to Nanjun at Xingye, just in time to meet Cao Ren's army to rescue Yiling. The two armies then fought a scuffle. It's getting late, so they have to withdraw their troops.","Leaving Yiling to turn back to attack Nanjun, Zhou Yu runs into the relieving force that Cao Ren has sent to aid the northern army at Yiling. Battle commences, but without resolution. In the end, worn out and incapable of any further struggle, Cao Ren returns to Nanjun and Zhou Yu to his camp.","Then Zhou Yu prepared for another attack where he himself would lead. But Gan Ning said, “General, do not be in too great hurry; let me go first and attack Yiling, the supporting angle of the ox-horn formation. After that the conquest of Nanjun will be easy.” Zhou Yu accepted the plan and Gan Ning, with three thousand troops, went to attack Yiling. When news of the approaching army reached him, Cao Ren called to his side Chen Jiao, who said, “If Yiling be lost, then Nanjun is lost too. So help must be sent quickly.” Thereupon Cao Chun and Niu Jin were sent by secret ways to the aid of Cao Hong. Cao Chun sent a messenger to the city to ask that they should cause a diversion by a sortie at the time the reinforcements should arrive. So when Gan Ning drew near, Cao Hong went out to meet and engage him. They fought a score of rounds, but Cao Hong was overcome at last, and Gan Ning took the city. However, as evening fell the reinforcements under Cao Chun and Niu Jin came up, and the captor was surrounded in the city he had taken. The scouts went off immediately to tell Zhou Yu of this sudden change of affairs which greatly alarmed him. “Let us hasten to his rescue,” said Cheng Pu. “Our place is of the greatest importance,” said Zhou Yu, “and I am afraid to leave it undefended lest Cao Ren should attack.” “But Gan Ning is one of our first leaders and must be rescued,” said Lu Meng. “I should like to go myself to his aid, but whom can I leave here in my place?” said Zhou Yu. “Leave Ling Tong here;” said Lu Meng, “I will push on ahead, and you can protect my advance. In less than ten days we shall be singing the paean of victory.” “Are you willing?” said Zhou Yu to the man who was to act for him. Ling Tong said, “If the ten-day period is not exceeded, I may be able to carry on for that time; I am unequal to more than that.” Ling Tong's consent pleased Zhou Yu who started at once, leaving ten thousand troops for the defense of the camp. Lu Meng said to his chief, “South of Yiling is a little-used road that may prove very useful in an attack on Nanjun. Let us send a party to fell trees and barricade this road so that horses cannot pass. In case of defeat, the defeated will take this road and will be compelled to abandon their horses, which we shall capture.” Zhou Yu approved and the men set out. When the main army drew near Yiling, Zhou Yu asked who would try to break through the besiegers, and Zhou Tai offered himself. He girded on his sword, mounted his steed, and burst straight into the Cao Hong's army. He got through to the city wall. From the city wall Gan Ning saw the approach of his friend Zhou Tai and went out to welcome him. Zhou Tai told him the Commander-in-Chief was on the way to his relief, and Gan Ning at once bade the defenders prepare from within to support the attack of the rescuers. When the news of the approach of Zhou Yu had reached Yiling, Cao Hong, Cao Chun, and Niu Jin had sent to tell Cao Ren, who was at Nanjun, and at the same time they prepared to repel the assailants. When the army of the South Land came near, they at once attacked. Simultaneously Gan Ning and Zhou Tai went out to attack on two sides, and the troops of Cao Hong were thrown into confusion. The soldiers of the South Land fell on lustily, and the three leaders all fled by a bye road, but, finding the way barred with felled trees and other obstacles, they had to abandon their horses and go afoot. In this way the troops of the South Land gained some five hundred steeds. Zhou Yu, pressing on as quickly as possible toward Nanjun, came upon Cao Ren and his army marching to save Yiling. The two armies engaged and fought a battle which lasted till late in the evening."

Zhuge Jin said: ""The younger brother Zhuge Liang came up from the Han Dynasty and said that Liu Yuzhou wants to form the Eastern Wu state and attack Cao Cao together. The civil and military negotiations have not yet been decided. Because the younger brother is the envoy, Jin did not dare to say more, and waited for the governor to decide the matter."" Said: ""What is the public opinion?"" Jin said: ""It is easy for those who surrender, but it is difficult for those who fight."" Zhou Yu smiled and said, ""Yu has his own ideas. I will come to the government to make a decision."" Jin and others dismissed.","But then a delegation led by Zhang Zhao arrives and argues in favour of surrendering to Cao Cao – and Zhou Yu appears to agree with them! Then the military leaders turn up, urging resistance to Cao Cao – and Zhou Yu seems to side with them! After this comes a delegation of bureaucrats led by Kong Ming’s brother Zhuge Jin, who makes the comment that ‘Surrendering certainly means a sort of security while war – well who can tell what that will lead to?’ Again Zhou Yu plays safe and says he will give a decision the next day. They are followed by yet another group, who debate back and forth among themselves in front of Zhou Yu until eventually he says he will definitely decide tomorrow, and they all leave.","They were quickly succeeded by Zhuge Jin, Lu Fan and their faction. They were brought in and, after the usual courtesies, Zhuge Jin said, “My brother has come down the river saying that Liu Bei desires to ally himself with our lord against Cao Cao. The civil and military hold different opinions as to the course to be pursued, but as my brother is so deeply concerned, I am unwilling to say much on either side. We are awaiting your decision.” “And what do you think about it?” asked Zhou Yu. “Submission is an easy road to tranquillity, while the result of war is hard to foretell.” Zhou Yu smiled, “I shall have my mind made up. Come tomorrow to the palace, and the decision shall be announced.” The trimmers took their leave."

Zhong shouted, ""No crime!"" Xuan was furious and said, ""I watched it for three days, but you dare to deceive me! If you didn't fight hard the day before, you must be selfish; if you lost your horse yesterday, if he didn't kill you, you must be related. He tugs the bowstring, but the third arrow stops shooting at his helmet, how can it not be connected outside and inside? The generals wanted to tell him, but Xuan said, ""But the one who exonerates Huang Zhong is sympathetic!"" As soon as he pushed the door, he was about to raise his sword, but suddenly he swung the sword in, chopped the knife's hand to death, rescued Huang Zhong, He called: ""Huang Hansheng is the protection of Changsha. To kill Hansheng today is to kill the people of Changsha! Han Xuan is cruel and inhumane, and he despises the wise and slow, and he will be slaughtered in front of the public! Please come with me!"" The face is like a heavy date, and the eyes are like a bright star: Wei Yan also from Yiyang - since Xiangyang could not catch Liu Xuande, he came to cast Han Xuan; Xuan blamed his arrogance and little courtesy, and refused to reuse it, so he succumbed to this. Huang Zhong was rescued that day, and he instructed the common people to kill Han Xuan together. Huang Zhong couldn't stop it. Wei Yan directly killed the head of Shangcheng, slashed Han Xuan into two sections with one sword, raised his head and mounted his horse, leading the people out of the city to worship Yunchang. Yun grew up overjoyed, so he entered the city, and after his comfort was over, he asked Huang Zhong to meet him. Zhongtuo does not get sick. Yun Changshou sent people to invite Xuande and Kongming.","However, all is far from well inside the city, for, the moment Huang Zhong returns, Han Xuan arrests him. ‘Why are you doing this,’ roars the old general. ‘What have I done wrong?’ ‘For three days I’ve watched what you’ve been doing. Do you think I’m an idiot?’ shouts Han Xuan. ‘On the first day you didn’t really try. On the second day, when your horse fell, you were spared – which makes me think you have some sort of deal going with Guan Yu. And today, today you fake two shots and then fire one which just sticks in his helmet! The only explanation is that you’re in league with him, and, if I don’t have you executed now, you’ll betray me.’ So saying, he summons his guards and orders the execution to take place in front of the city gate for all to see, saying, ‘Anyone who opposes me will also die!’ Huang Zhong has been led outside the city gate, and the executioner has his sword raised ready to strike the fatal blow, when, as if from nowhere, a warrior charges forward. Slaying the executioner, he rescues Huang Zhong and cries out in defiance of the governor, ‘This man is the protector of Changsha, in contrast to that villain Han Xuan. What a violent, vindictive, worthless man! He rejects the wise and dishonours the worthy! Let’s all go now and kill him! Who’s with me?’ The astonished crowd strains to see who is saying all this. The hero ’s name is Wei Yan of Yiyang. He has heard of the valiant struggle of Xuande to protect the Han and is on his way to offer his services. He has been unable to locate him so has offered his services to Han Xuan. Han Xuan thought him a lazy, pointless fellow and basically ignored him, making Wei Yan deeply frustrated and angry. The momentum he has unleashed takes its full toll the next day when, despite Huang Zhong’s best efforts, Wei Yan leads a mob who storm the city. Catching Han Xuan, he slays him by cutting him in half with a single blow. He takes the governor’s head and goes out to offer this to Guan Yu and to surrender the city. When Xuande and Kong Ming arrive in the city, they are told of the events and go immediately to greet Huang Zhong.","But when the veteran leader went up on the wall to see the Governor, he was at once seized. “What have I done?” cried Huang Zhong. “I have seen these last three days that you were fooling me; you were slack the day before yesterday, which proved you had some sinister intention. Yesterday, when your horse stumbled and he spared you, it showed that you were in league with him. And today you twice twanged a vain bowstring, while at the third shot you only hit your opponent's helmet. Dare you say there is no secret understanding in all this? If I do not put you to death, it will assuredly redound to my own hurt.” Han Xuan ordered Huang Zhong to be executed outside the city gate. Han Xuan also met the intercession of the officers by saying, “Any one who pleads for the condemned shall be regarded as in the plot.” The executioners had hustled the old man out of the city and the sword was in the air and on the point of descending, when a man suddenly dashed in, cut down the lictor, and rescued Huang Zhong. “Huang Zhong is our bulwark;” shouted he, “to destroy him is to destroy the Changsha people. This Governor is too fierce and cruel, too lightly values good people, and is too arrogant toward his officers. We ought rather to kill him, and those who will, let them follow me.” All eyes turned toward this bold speaker, who was bronzed and had eyes like the Cowherd's star. Some of them knew him as Wei Yan, a native of Yiyang. He would have followed Liu Bei from Xiangyang but, unable to come up with him, had gone into the service of Han Xuan. Han Xuan took exception to his arrogant carriage and lack of polish and neglected him. And so Wei Yan had remained in the city without office. After the rescue of Huang Zhong, Wei Yan called upon the people to make an end of the Governor. He waved his arm and shouted to the people. Soon he had a following of several hundreds. Huang Zhong could not stop them. In a very short time, Wei Yan had dashed up on the wall, and Han Xuan lay dead. Taking his head, Wei Yan rode off out of the city to lay the bloodstained trophy at the feet of Guan Yu, who forthwith went into the city to restore confidence. When the people were all quiet, Guan Yu sent to request Huang Zhong to come to see him, but the old general pleaded illness. Next Guan Yu sent the good news to his brother and to Zhuge Liang and asked them to come."
恰纔行不得五六里，背後陳武、潘璋趕到。徐盛、丁奉備言其事。陳、潘二將曰：“你放他過去差了。我二人奉吳侯旨意，特來追捉他回去。”於是四將合兵一處，趲程趕來。玄德正行間，忽聽得背後喊聲大起。玄德又告孫夫人曰：“後面追兵又到，如之奈何？”夫人曰：“丈夫先行，我與子龍當後。”玄德先引三百軍，望江岸去了。子龍勒馬於車傍，將士卒擺開，專候來將。四員將見了孫夫人，只得下馬，叉手而立。夫人曰：“陳武、潘璋，來此何幹？”二將答曰：“奉主公之命，請夫人、玄德回。”夫人正色叱曰：“都是你這夥匹夫。離間我兄妹不睦！我已嫁他人，今日歸去，須不是與人私奔。我奉母親慈旨，令我夫婦回荊州。便是我哥哥來，也須依禮而行。你二人倚仗兵威，欲待殺害我耶？”罵得四人面面相覷，各自尋思：“他一萬年也只是兄妹。更兼國太作主；吳侯乃大孝之人，怎敢違逆母言？明日翻過臉來，只是我等不是。不如做個人情。”軍中又不見玄德；但見趙雲怒目睜眉，只待廝殺；因此四將喏喏連聲而退。孫夫人令推車便行。徐盛曰：“我四人同去見周都督，告稟此事。”四人猶豫未定，忽見一軍如旋風而來；視之，乃蔣欽、周泰。二將問曰：“你等曾見劉備否？”四人曰：“早晨過去，已半日矣。”蔣欽曰：“何不拏下？”四人各言孫夫人發話之事。蔣欽曰：“便是吳侯怕道如此，封一口劍在此，敎先殺他妹，後斬劉備。違者立斬！”四將曰：“去之已遠，怎生奈何？”蔣欽曰：“他終是些步軍，急行不上。徐、丁二將軍，可飛報都督，敎水路棹快船追趕；我四人在岸上追趕。無問水旱之路，趕上殺了，休聽他言語。”於是徐盛、丁奉飛報周瑜；蔣欽、周泰、陳武、潘璋四個領兵沿江趕來。,"It was only five or six miles away, when Chen Wu and Pan Zhang arrived behind him. Xu Sheng and Ding Feng were prepared to speak out. The two generals Chen and Pan said, ""You let him go. I have come to chase him back at the will of the Marquis of Wu."" So the four generals joined forces and came all the way. As Xuande was walking, he suddenly heard a loud voice behind him. Xuande also told Madam Sun, ""The chasing troops are coming again, what can I do?"" Madam said, ""My husband will go first, and Zilong and I will follow."" Xuande led three hundred troops and went to the river bank. Zilong reined his horse to the side of the chariot and set aside his soldiers to wait for the coming general. When the four generals saw Mrs. Sun, they had to dismount and stand with arms crossed. The lady said, ""Chen Wu and Pan Zhang, what are you doing here?"" The two generals replied, ""At the command of the lord, I ask the lady and Xuande to come back."" Brother and sister are not on good terms! I have married someone else, and I am going back today, so I must not be running away with someone else. I am following my mother's merciful order and ordered my husband and wife to return to Jingzhou. Even if my brother comes, we must obey the etiquette. You two rely on military might. Do you want to kill me?"" The four of them looked at each other and thought to each other: ""He was only a brother and sister for ten thousand years. He was also the ruler of the state; the Marquis of Wu was a man of great filial piety, how dare he go against his mother's words? It's just that I'm not waiting. It's better to be human."" Xuande was nowhere to be seen in the army, but Zhao Yun's brows were raised angrily, and he was only waiting for the fight; therefore, the four generals retreated in a row. Mrs. Sun ordered the cart to go. Xu Sheng said, ""The four of us went to see the Governor of Zhou together to report this matter."" The four of them hesitated, and suddenly saw an army coming like a whirlwind; they were Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai. The second general asked, ""Have you ever seen Liu Bei?"" The four said, ""It's been half a day since the morning passed."" Jiang Qin said, ""Why don't you take it down?"" Jiang Qin said: ""It was the Marquis of Wu who was afraid of this, so he sealed a sword here, and ordered to kill his sister first, and then behead Liu Bei. Those who violated the law would be executed!"" Jiang Qin said: ""He is an infantry army, and he can't make it in a hurry. General Xu and Ding can fly to the governor, and teach the water and road boats to chase; the four of us are chasing on the shore. Kill him, don't listen to what he has to say."" So Xu Sheng and Ding Fengfei reported to Zhou Yu; Jiang Qin, Zhou Tai, Chen Wu, and Pan Zhang came along the river.","Not long after they have moved off, two other officers, those sent initially by Sun Quan, Chen Wu and Pan Zhang, ride up. They tell an alarmed Xu Sheng and Ding Feng that they have explicit orders to prevent the escape of Xuande and Lady Sun. Horrified at their mistake, Xu Sheng and Ding Feng with the other two gallop off after the fast-disappearing troop and carriage. Xuande soon notices the clouds of dust and realizes the pursuit is on again. And once again Lady Sun takes control. She tells him to ride on for the river with three hundred of his men while she and Zhao Zilong deal with this new threat. No sooner do the four officers see Lady Sun than they leap from their horses and bow deeply. Lady Sun barks, ‘Chen Wu, Pan Zhang. What are you doing here?’ ‘We’ve been instructed by Lord Sun to ensure you both return.’ For a moment, Lady Sun looks at them in distasteful silence. Then, sighing, she says, ‘It is the fault of people like you that problems have arisen between my brother and me. It’s not as if this is an elopement – I’m after all married to Lord Xuande. My mother has agreed to this trip – as indeed has my brother. We’re simply fulfilling our ritual and filial duties! So why do you have these weapons? Is it your plan to kill us?’ This speech just leaves the four generals shamefaced and also contemplating the fact that, whatever else happened, Lady Sun and Lord Sun would always be sister and brother; that this trip is sanctioned by the queen mother and that Lord Sun, filial son that he is, would never gainsay his own mother! What if tomorrow he repents and changes his mind? Guess who would get the blame then! It might be best to just show some kindness now. So the four bow deeply and quietly retreat. A little while after this, the four see riding towards them at a furious pace the second troop sent by Sun Quan, commanded by Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai. Crying out, ‘Have you seen Xuande?’ the four reply that they passed them this very morning. When they are challenged as to why they did not detain them, the four relate their encounter with Lady Sun. The two newcomers tell of the sword and special commission Sun Quan has given them to execute the pair, and the other officers say that the couple are already well on their way. The six officers decide that Xu Sheng and Ding Feng will ride back to Zhou Yu and tell him what has happened. They will request the fastest boats possible to race after them. The other four will chase the fugitives along roads and try to catch them. ‘Whatever you do,’ says Jiang Qin, ‘don’t let them speak!","The cavalcade had only gone a few miles when up came the pursuers. The two generals told the new-comers what had happened. “You were wrong to let them pass,” said Chen Wu and Pan Zhang. “We have orders from the Marquis himself to arrest them.” Thereupon all four went in pursuit. When the noise of the approaching force reached the ears of Liu Bei, he said to his wife, “They are again pursuing us; what now?” “Husband, go on in front. Zhao Yun and I will keep them off.” So Liu Bei and a small company went on toward the river bank, while Zhao Yun reined up beside the lady's carriage and set out his troops ready for battle. And when the four generals came up, they dismounted and stood with folded arms. “What are you doing here, Generals?” asked Lady Sun. “We have orders from our lord to request you and Liu Bei to return.” Calmly but bitterly she said, “So this is the sort of fools you are! You would make dissension between brother and sister. But I am a wife on my way to my husband's home. Nor am I leaving clandestinely, for I had my mother's gracious permission. Now we, husband and wife, are going to Jingzhou; and if even my brother were here himself, he would let us pass in all politeness. But you, because you have weapons in your hands, would slay us!” She abused the four men to their faces so that they looked from one to another in shame. And each in his heart thought, “Say what one will, after all they two are brother and sister and the Dowager Marchioness is the controlling power. Sun Quan is most obedient and would never dare oppose his mother's decision. When the reaction comes, then indeed we shall certainly be found in the wrong. We would better be kind.” Another thing was that one of the two they sought, Liu Bei, was not there and Zhao Yun looked angry and dangerous. Finally, muttering to themselves, they gave way and with one accord retired and left the road open. Lady Sun passed through. “We four will go to see the Commander-in-Chief and report,” said Xu Sheng. But that did not please them all and they stood irresolute. Presently they saw a column of troops sweeping down on them like a hurricane. These were Jiang Qin and Zhou Tai with their company. “Have you fellows seen Liu Bei ?” they cried as they rushed up. “He has just passed along.” “Why did you not arrest him?” “Because of what Lady Sun said.” “That is just as the Marquis feared, and so he gave us this sword and told us first to slay his sister and then Liu Bei. And if we disobey, he will put us to death.” “What can be done? They are far away by now.” Jiang Qin said, “After all they are but a few and on foot; they cannot travel very fast. Let Xu Sheng and Ding Feng go to Zhou Yu to tell him, and he can send fast boats to pursue them on the river while we follow up on the bank. We must get them either on water or land, and we must not listen to what they say.” Whereupon two went back to report and four to the river bank."
却說吳國太見孫權疑惑不決，乃謂之曰：“先姊遺言云：‘伯符臨終有言：內事不決問張昭，外事不決問周瑜。’今何不請公瑾問之？”權大喜，卽遣使往鄱陽請周瑜議事。原來周瑜在鄱陽湖訓練水師，聞曹操大軍至漢上，便星夜回柴桑郡議軍機事。使者未發，周瑜已先到。魯肅與瑜最厚，先來接着，將前項事細述一番。周瑜曰：“子敬休憂：瑜自有主張。今可速請孔明來相見。”魯肅上馬去了。,"But Wu Guotai saw that Sun Quan was undecided, and said to him: ""My elder sister's last words said: 'Bo Fu said at the end of his life: If you are undecided about internal affairs, ask Zhang Zhao, and if you are undecided about foreign affairs, ask Zhou Yu.' Why don't you ask Gongjin to ask him now? ""Quan was overjoyed and sent an envoy to Poyang to invite Zhou Yu to discuss matters. It turned out that Zhou Yu was training a navy in Poyang Lake, and when he heard that Cao Cao's army had reached the Han Dynasty, he returned to Chaisang County to discuss military affairs. Before the messenger was sent, Zhou Yu had already arrived. Lu Su and Yu are the thickest, come first and then, and elaborate on the previous matters. Zhou Yu said, ""Zi Jingxiu is worried: Yu has his own ideas. Now you can quickly invite Kong Ming to meet you."" Lu Su mounted his horse.","What his mother reminds him of is the advice that her sister heard from the lips of the dying Sun Ce: that on domestic affairs, Sun Quan should listen to Zhang Zhao but he should listen to Zhou Yu on external affairs. So it is decided to consult Zhou Yu, who at that time is at the Poyang lakes, where he is conducting naval exercises. Lu Su sets off straight away and is reassured by Zhou Yu that he will support him the moment Kong Ming comes as well.","The dying message which Lady Wu recalled to Sun Quan's memory was, “For internal matters consult Zhang Zhao; for external policy Zhou Yu.” Wherefore Zhou Yu was summoned. But Zhou Yu was already on the way. He had been training his naval forces on Poyang Lake when he heard of the approach of Cao Cao's hosts and had started for Chaisang without loss of time. So, before the messenger ordered to call him could start, he had already arrived. As he and Lu Su were close friends, the latter went to welcome him and told him of all that had happened. “Have no anxiety;” said Zhou Yu, “I shall be able to decide this. But go quickly and beg Zhuge Liang to come to see me.” So Lu Su went to seek out Zhuge Liang."

Dismantling and watching it, it is Liu Beishu. The book says:","When Xuande joins the others at Xuzhou, he suggests that he try one last attempt at appealing to Cao Cao to understand that the murder of Cao’s family had nothing to do with Tao Qian. He writes a personal letter to Cao Cao.","It happened that Cao Cao was holding a council when a messenger with a war letter was announced. The letter was brought in and handed to him and, when he had opened and looked at it, he found it was from Liu Bei. This is the letter, very nearly:"
却說玄德在徐州，聞使命至，出郭迎接；開讀詔書，却是要起兵討袁術。玄德領命，送使者先回。糜竺曰：“此又是曹操之計。”玄德曰：“雖是計，王命不可違也。”遂點軍馬，尅日起程。孫乾曰：“可先定守城之人。”玄德曰：“二弟之中，誰人可守？”關公曰：“弟愿守此城。”玄德曰：“吾早晚欲與爾議事，豈可相離？”張飛曰：“小弟愿守此城。”玄德曰：“你守不得此城：你一者酒後剛強，鞭撻士卒；二者作事輕易，不從人諫。吾不於心。”張飛曰：“弟自今以後，不飲酒，不打軍士，諸般聽人勸諫便了。”糜竺曰：“只恐口不應心。”飛怒曰：“吾跟哥哥多年，未嘗失信，你如何輕料我！”玄德曰：“弟言雖如此，吾終不放心。還請陳元龍輔之。早晚令其少飲酒，勿致失事。”陳登應諾。玄德分付了當，乃統馬步軍三萬，離徐州望南陽進發。,"However, they said that Xuande was in Xuzhou, and when he heard that the mission was coming, he went out to meet him in Guo; when he started reading the edict, he wanted to raise troops to attack Yuan Shu. Xuande took the order and sent the messenger back first. Mi Zhu said, ""This is another plan of Cao Cao."" Xuande said, ""Although it is a plan, the king's order cannot be violated."" Sun Qian said, ""You can decide who will guard the city first."" Xuande said, ""Among the two younger brothers, who can guard it?"" Guan Gong said, ""My younger brother would like to guard this city."" How can you be apart when discussing matters?” Zhang Fei said, “My little brother would like to defend this city.” Xuande said, “You can’t defend this city: one of you is strong after drinking and whips your soldiers; the other is easy to do things, and you don’t follow people’s advice. I don't mind."" Zhang Fei said: ""From now on, brother, I will not drink alcohol, nor beat soldiers, and I will listen to people's advice."" Mi Zhu said, ""I'm just afraid that my words should not be my heart."" Fei said angrily: ""I I have been with my brother for many years, and I have not lost faith, how can you take me lightly!"" Xuande said: ""Although my brother said that, I am not at ease. I also ask Chen Yuanlong to help him. Sooner or later, let him drink less alcohol, so as not to cause accidents."" Chen Deng promised. Xuande paid his share, and then commanded the horse infantry army of 30,000, and left Xuzhou to look at Nanyang.","This will lead Yuan Shu to attack Xuande, and then you can officially sanction Xuande to attack back. Seeing Xuande and Yuan Shu at each other’s throats, Lü Bu will no longer be sure whom to follow or trust.’ When the envoy brings the second secret message to Xuande, Mi Zhu his adviser points out that this is yet another trick. ‘I do understand, but, as this is an imperial command, I cannot refuse.’ As he prepares to follow the orders to attack Yuan Shu he has to decide whom he will leave in charge of Xuzhou. Because Guan Yu is needed by Xuande for the attack, Zhang Fei volunteers, but Xuande rounds on him. ‘You!’ he says. ‘I can’t trust Xuzhou to you! You’re usually drunk and when you are you attack people! On top of that you always ignore good advice, even when I give it! Do you honestly think I would sleep easy if you were in charge?’ ‘From now on I’ll never drink nor beat anyone,’ swears Zhang Fei. Xuande doesn’t trust him and leaves his commander Chen Deng in charge with orders to keep an eye on Zhang Fei and his drinking. When the two armies meet, Yuan Shu with one hundred thousand men and Xuande with a much smaller army, the clash is brief and goes against Yuan Shu, who has to retreat.","When this came the messenger was received with all the ceremonies and the edict ordered the capture of Yuan Shu. After the departure of the bearer, Liu Bei called Mi Zhu who pronounced it a ruse. “It may be,” said Liu Bei, “but the royal command is not to be disobeyed.” So the army was prepared and the day fixed. Sun Qian said, “A trusty man must be left on guard of the city.” And Liu Bei asked which of his brothers would undertake this task. “I will guard the city,” said Guan Yu. “I am constantly in need of your advice, so how can we part?” said Liu Bei. “I will guard the city,” said Zhang Fei. “You will fail,” said Liu Bei. “After one of your drinking bouts you will get savage and flog the soldiers. Beside you are rash and will not listen to any one's advice. I shall be uneasy all the time.” “Henceforth I drink no more wine. I will not beat the soldiers and I will always listen to advice,” said Zhang Fei. “I fear the mouth does not correspond to the heart,” said Mi Zhu. “I have followed my elder brother these many years and never broken faith; why should you be contemptuous?” said Zhang Fei. Liu Bei said, “Though you say this, I do not feel quite satisfied. I will order Adviser Chen Deng to help you and keep you sober. Then you will not make any mistake.” Chen Deng was willing to undertake this duty, and the final orders were given. The army of thirty thousand, horse and foot, left Xuzhou and marched toward Nanyang."

次日，聚衆將於帳下，敎請孔明議事。孔明欣然而至。坐定，瑜問孔明曰：“卽日將與曹軍交戰，水路交兵，當以何兵器為先？”孔明曰：“大江之上，以弓箭為先。”瑜曰：“先生之言，甚合愚意。但今軍中正缺箭用，敢煩先生監造十萬枝箭，以為應敵之具。此係公事，先生幸勿推却。”孔明曰：“都督見委，自當効勞。敢問十萬枝箭，何時要用？”瑜曰：“十日之內，可完辦否？”孔明曰：“操軍卽日將至，若候十日，必誤大事。”瑜曰：“先生料幾日可完辦？”孔明曰：“只消三日，便可拜納十萬枝箭。”瑜曰：“軍中無戲言。”孔明曰：“怎敢戲都督！願納軍令狀：三日不辦，甘當重罰。”瑜大喜，喚軍政司當面取了文書，置酒相待曰：“待軍事畢後，自有酬勞。”孔明曰：“今日已不及，來日造起。至第三日，可差五百小軍到江邊搬箭。”飲了數盃，辭去。魯肅曰：“此人莫非詐乎？”瑜曰：“他自送死，非我逼他。今明白對衆要了文書，他便兩脅生翅，也飛不去。我只分付軍匠人等，敎他故意遲延，凡應用物件，都不與齊備。如此，必然誤了日期。那時定罪，有何理說？公今可去探他虛實，却來回報。”,"The next day, the gathering will be under the tent to invite Kong Ming to discuss matters. Kong Ming was delighted to come. Sitting down, Yu asked Kong Ming, ""The general will fight against Cao's army on the day of the sun, and when we fight by water, which weapon should be used first?"" Kong Ming said, ""On the big river, bow and arrow are the first."" Yu said, ""Sir's words are very true. It's idiotic. But today's army is short of arrows, and I dare to bother Mr. to supervise the construction of 100,000 arrows, thinking that it is a weapon to meet the enemy. This is a public business, and it is fortunate that you should not turn it away."" Kong Ming said: ""The chief inspector sees the commission, and you should serve yourself. Dare to ask the hundred thousand arrows, when will they be used?"" Yu said, ""Can it be done within ten days?"" Kong Ming said, ""The army is approaching, and if you wait for ten days, you will miss a major event."" Said: ""Sir, how many days do you think it will be done?"" Kong Ming said, ""It only takes three days to receive a hundred thousand arrows."" Yu said, ""There are no jokes in the army."" Kong Ming said, ""How dare you play with the governor! Accepting the military order: If you do not do it for three days, you are willing to pay a heavy punishment."" Yu was overjoyed, and called the military and political secretary to get the document in person, and served a wine to each other, saying: ""After the military is over, you will have your own reward."" Kong Ming said: ""Today is too late, come here. On the third day, five hundred small troops can be sent to the riverside to carry arrows."" After drinking a few cups, he resigned. Lu Su said: ""Is this person cheating?"" Yu said: ""He committed suicide by himself, and I did not force him. Now that I understand that the documents are required from the public, he will be flanked by his wings, and he will not be able to fly. I will only pay the army. The craftsmen, etc., instruct him to deliberately delay, and all the items used are not ready. If so, the date must be missed. At that time, what is the reason for the conviction? The public can go to check his truth, but come back.""","And turning to Kong Ming, Zhou Yu says, ‘I wonder if you would be so kind as to provide them for us? We will need one hundred thousand.’ To this outrageous suggestion Kong Ming mildly replies that he is of course happy to help in any way, and by when would Zhou like his one hundred thousand arrows to be ready? Zhou smiles and suggests that ten days would be very convenient. So imagine his astonishment when Kong Ming replies, ‘I think we will be attacked before then, so ten days is too long. I suggest three days instead.’ ‘Do not make fun of me,’ barks Zhou Yu, to which Kong Ming quietly replies, ‘I wouldn’t dream of doing so . If I fail to do this within three days, then, binding myself under military law, I’ll take my punishment as due.’ A delighted Zhou Yu thinks that he has trapped Kong Ming, for failure under military law means execution. Kong Ming says, ‘In three days’ time send five hundred men to collect the arrows down by the river.’ And after drinking a few cups of wine to honour the deal, Kong Ming departs. Deeply troubled and distressed, Lu Su goes after Kong Ming and finds him lamenting his fate.","Soon after all the officers were summoned to the main tent, and Zhuge Liang's presence was desired. He went contentedly enough. When all were seated, Zhou Yu suddenly addressed Zhuge Liang, saying, “I am going to fight a battle with the enemy soon on the water: what weapons are the best?” “On a great river arrows are the best,” said Zhuge Liang. “Your opinion and mine agree. But at the moment we are short of them. I wish you would undertake to supply about a hundred thousand arrows for the naval fight. As it is for the public service, you will not decline, I hope'“ “Whatever task the Commander-in-Chief lays upon me, I must certainly try to perform,” replied Zhuge Liang. “May I inquire by what date you require the hundred thousand arrows?” “Could you have them ready in ten days?” “The enemy will be here very soon; ten days will be too late,” said Zhuge Liang. “In how many days do you estimate the arrows can be ready?” “Let me have three days; then you may send for your hundred thousand.” “No joking, remember!” said Zhou Yu. “There is no joking in war time.” “Dare I joke with the Commander-in-Chief? Give me a formal military order; and if I have not completed the task in three days, I will take my punishment.” Zhou Yu, secretly delighted, sent for the secretaries and prepared the commission then and there. Then he drank to the success of the undertaking and said, “I shall have to congratulate you most heartily when this is accomplished.” “This day is too late to count,” said Zhuge Liang. “On the third from tomorrow morning send five hundred small boats to the river side to convey the arrows.” They drank a few more cups together, and then Zhuge Liang took his leave. After he had gone, Lu Su said, “Do you not think there is some deceit about this?” “Clearly it is not I! It is he who has signed his own death warrant,” said Zhou Yu. “Without being pressed in the least, he asked for a formal order in the face of the whole assembly. Even if he grew a pair of wings, he could not escape. Only I will just order the workers to delay him as much as they can, and not supply him with materials, so that he is sure to fail. And then, when the certain penalty is incurred, who can criticize? You can go and inquire about it all and keep me informed.”"

Zhang Rang and other governors were anxious, and they panicked and told He Hou: ""The one who planned to frame the general at the beginning, Jian Shuo alone, is not the only one. Cadets and other matters. The general listened to Yuan Shao's words, and wanted to do everything he could to punish the ministers and others, and beg for mercy!""

Jian Shuo in terror fled into the palace garden and hid among the shrubs, where he was discovered and murdered by Guo Sheng, one of the Ten Eunuchs.

Yuan Shao said, “Their gangs have broken; the most opportune moment is now to slay all the eunuchs.” But Zhang Rang and the eunuchs of the Ten scented the danger and rushed to see Empress He. They said, “The originator of the plan to injure your brother was Jian Shuo; only he was concerned and no other. Now the Imperial Guardian, on Yuan Shao's advice, wishes to slay every one of us. We implore your pity, O Your Majesty.” “Fear not,” said Empress He, whose son had just become Emperor, “I will protect you.” She sent for her brother, and said, “You and I are of lowly origin, and we owe our good fortune to the eunuchs. The misguided Jian Shuo is now dead, and need you really put all the others to death as Yuan Shao advises?” And He Jin obeyed her wish. He explained to his party, saying, “The real offender, Jian Shuo, has met his fate, and his clan will be punished. But we need not exterminate the whole party nor injure his colleagues.” “Slay them, root and branch,” cried Yuan Shao, “or they will ruin you!” “I have decided;” said He Jin, coldly, “say no more.” Within a few days He Jin became Chair of the Secretariat, and his associates received high offices."

時雲長在側，孔明全然不睬。雲長忍耐不住，乃高聲曰：“關某自隨兄長征戰，許多年來，未嘗落後。今日逢大敵，軍師却不委用，此是何意？”孔明笑曰：“雲長勿怪！某本欲煩足下把一個最緊要的隘口，怎奈有些違礙處，不敢敎去。”雲長曰：“有何違礙？願卽見諭。”孔明曰：“昔日曹操待足下甚厚，足下當有以報之。今日操兵敗。必走華容道。若令足下去時，必然放他過去。因此不敢敎去。”雲長曰：“軍師好心多！當日曹操果是重待某，某已斬顏良，誅文醜，解白馬之圍，報過他了。今日撞見，豈肯輕放！”孔明曰：“倘若放了時，却如何？”雲長曰：“願依軍法。”孔明曰：“如此，立下文書。”雲長便與了軍令狀。雲長曰：“若曹操不從那條路上來，如何？”孔明曰：“我亦與你軍令狀。”雲長大喜。孔明曰：“雲長可於華容小路高山之處，堆積柴草，放起一把火煙，引曹操來。”雲長曰：“曹操望見煙，知有埋伏，如何肯來？”孔明笑曰：“豈不聞兵法虛虛實實之論？操雖能用兵，只此可以瞞過他也。他見煙起，將謂虛張聲勢，必然投這條路來。將軍休得容情。”雲長領了將令，引關平、周倉并五百校刀手，投華容道埋伏去了。玄德曰：“吾弟義氣深重，若曹操果然投華容道去時，只恐端的放了。”孔明曰：“亮夜觀乾象，操賊未合身亡。留這人情，敎雲長做了，亦是美事。”玄德曰：“先生神算，世所罕及！”孔明遂與玄德往樊口，看周瑜用兵，留孫乾、簡雍守城。,"When Shi Yun was on the side, Kong Ming ignored him completely. Yun Chang couldn't bear it any longer, so he said loudly: ""Guan Mou has followed his elder brother to fight for many years, and he has not fallen behind. Today, we meet a great enemy, but the military advisor does not entrust him. What does this mean?"" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""Don't blame Yun Chang! A certain person wants to trouble himself with one of the most important passes, but there are some obstacles, so he doesn't dare to teach them to go."" Yun Chang said, ""What is the obstacle? I would like to see you soon."" Kong Ming said, ""In the past, Cao Cao treated his steps very generously. , you should repay it with your steps. If you lose your army today, you must go to Huarong Road. If you order your feet to go down, you will definitely let him go. Therefore, I don’t dare to send him.” Yun Chang said: “The strategist is so kind! Cao Cao was really serious that day. Waiting for someone, someone has already beheaded Yan Liang, slaughtered Wen Chou, solved the siege of the white horse, and reported to him. I bumped into it today, how would I let it go lightly!"" Kong Ming said: ""If it is released, what will happen?"" Yun Chang said, ""I hope Military law."" Kong Ming said: ""So, make a document."" Yun Chang then issued the military order. Yun Chang said, ""What if Cao Cao didn't come from that road?"" Kong Ming said, ""I also issue the military order with you."" Yun Chang was overjoyed. Kong Ming said: ""Yun Chang can pile up firewood on the high mountain on Huarong Xiao Road, set off a fire of smoke, and invite Cao Cao to come."" Yun Chang said: ""Cao Cao saw the smoke and knew there was an ambush, so how could he be willing to come?"" Kong Ming smiled. Said: ""Don't you hear the theory that the art of war is false and true? Although Cao can use troops, he can only deceive him. When he sees the smoke rising, he will say that he is bluffing, and he will definitely go this route. The general will have mercy."" Yun Long led the general order, led Guan Ping, Zhou Cang and five hundred school swordsmen, and went to Huarong Dao to ambush. Xuande said: ""My brother is very loyal. If Cao Cao really goes to Huarong Dao, I am afraid that he will let him go."" Kong Ming said: ""I watched Qianxiang in a bright night, and the thief died before he fit. Save this favor and teach Yunchang to do it."" It’s a beautiful thing.” Xuande said, “Sir, you are a genius, which is rare in the world!” Kong Ming and Xuande then went to Fankou to watch Zhou Yu use his troops, leaving Sun Qian and Jian Yong to guard the city.","Standing to one side throughout this has been Guan Yu, to whom no task has been assigned. Unable to stand this any longer, he erupts, ‘I’ve never been left out before while my brothers go into battle. What’s going on?’ ‘Cao Cao once treated you most kindly, and this means you’re sure to feel that you must repay him. My concern is that this will mean you will let him pass if you are sent to block his path along a road. That is why I haven’t assigned you a role.’ ‘What!’ exclaims Guan Yu. ‘That is why you don’t trust me? I’ve repaid Cao Cao many times, killing Yuan Shao’s commander Yan Liang; executing Wen Chou; breaking through the siege at Baima. Do you really think I would let him go now?’ ‘Yes, but what if you did?’ says Kong Ming, pushing Guan Yu hard. ‘Then let military law for treason be my judge!’ ‘Alright, but put that down in writing,’ says Kong Ming, unwilling to let him off the hook. So Guan Yu is given command of the ambush on the road to Huarong. He is to lure Cao Cao that way by setting fire to the brush wood. This will make Cao Cao think an ambush has already been sprung and encourage him to try to force his way through. It is only when Gua Yu has left that Xuande confesses he fears Guan Yu’s sense of honour will mean he will let Cao Cao escape. To this Kong Ming replies that he has studied the stars, and Cao Cao is not due to die tomorrow. So he has put Guan Yu there to perform an act of kindness which will greatly enhance Guan Yu and make no difference to the fate of Cao Cao! Back now to Cao Cao, who is waiting for confirmation that Huang Gai has abandoned Zhou Yu and is on his way.","All this time Guan Yu has been silently waiting his turn, but Zhuge Liang said no word to him. When Guan Yu could bear this no longer, he cried, “Since I first followed my brother to battle many years ago, I have never been left behind. Now that great things are afoot, is there no work for me? What is meant by it?” “You should not be surprised. I wanted you for service at a most important point, only that there was a something standing in the way that prevented me from sending you,” said Zhuge Liang. “What could stand in the way? I wish you would tell me.” “You see Cao Cao was once very kind to you, and you cannot help feeling grateful. Now when his soldiers have been beaten, he will have to flee along the Huarong Road; and if I sent you to guard it, you would have to let him pass. So I will not send you.” “You are most considerate, Instructor. But though it is true that he treated me well, yet I slew two of his most redoubtable opponents, Yan Liang and Wen Chou, by way of repayment, beside raising a siege. If I happened upon him on this occasion, I should hardly let him go.” “But what if you did?” “You could deal with me by military rules.” “Then put that in writing.” So Guan Yu wrote a formal undertaking and gave the document to Zhuge Liang. “What happens if Cao Cao does not pass that way?” said Guan Yu. “I will give you a written engagement that he will pass.” Then Zhuge Liang continued, “On the hills by the Huarong Valley, you are to raise a heap of wood and grass to make a great column of smoke and mislead Cao Cao into coming.” “If Cao Cao sees a smoke, he will suspect an ambush and will not come.” said Guan Yu. “You are very simple,” said Zhuge Liang. “Do you not know more of war's ruses than that? Cao Cao is an able leader, but you can deceive him this time. When he sees the smoke, he will take it as a subterfuge and risk going that way. But do not let your kindness of heart rule your conduct.” Thus was his duty assigned Guan Yu, and he left, taking his adopted son Guan Ping, his general Zhou Cang, and five hundred swordsmen. Said Liu Bei, “His sense of rectitude is very profound; I fear if Cao Cao should come that way, my brother will let him pass.” “I have consulted the stars lately, and the rebel Cao Cao is not fated to come to his end yet. I have purposely designed this manifestation of kindly feeling for Guan Yu to accomplish and so act handsomely.” “Indeed there are few such far-seeing humans as you are,” said Liu Bei. The two then went to Fankou whence they might watch Zhou Yu's evolutions."

却說曹操在山東，聞知車駕已還洛陽，聚謀士商議。荀彧進曰：“昔晉文公納周襄王，而諸侯服從；漢高祖為義帝發喪，而天下歸心：今天子蒙塵，將軍誠因此時首倡義兵，奉天子以從衆望，不世之略也。若不早圖，人將先我而為之矣。”曹操大喜。正要收拾起兵，忽報有天使齎詔宣召。操接詔，尅日興師。,"But they said that Cao Cao was in Shandong, and when he heard that the car had been returned to Luoyang, he gathered his advisors to discuss. Xun Yujin said: ""In the past, Duke Wen of Jin accepted King Xiang of Zhou, and the princes obeyed; Emperor Gaozu of Han was mourned for Emperor Yi, and the whole world returned to his heart: today's son is dusty, and General Cheng is the first to advocate righteous soldiers at that time, and he respects the Son of Heaven in order to follow the public's expectations, which is not a strategy for the world. Also. If I don't plan early, people will do it before me."" Cao Cao was overjoyed. Just as he was about to pack up his troops, he suddenly reported that an angel had summoned him. Cao followed the edict, and the division was established.",With the consent of the emperor a messenger is sent to summon Cao Cao to Luoyang. Cao Cao immediately starts to put his affairs in order and prepares to set off on the long march to the capital.,"Now when Cao Cao had heard that the court had returned to Capital Luoyang, he called together his advisers to consult. Xun Yu laid the matter before Cao Cao and the council thus: “Eight hundred years ago, Lord Wen of Yin supported Prince Xiang of the declining Shang Dynasty, and all the feudal lords backed Lord Wen. The Founder of the Hans, Liu Bang, won the popular favor by wearing mourning for Emperor Yi of Qin. Now Emperor Xian has been a fugitive on the dusty roads. To take the lead in offering an army to restore him to honor is to have an unrivaled opportunity to win universal regard. But you must act quickly or some one will get in before you.” Cao Cao understood and at once prepared his army to move. Just at this moment an imperial messenger was announced with the very command Cao Cao wanted, and Cao Cao immediately set out."

First, Gan Ning was instructed to take Cai Zhong and his soldiers to walk along the south bank: ""Only play the banner of the North Army, and take the ground of Wulin, just as Cao Cao's grain storage. Go deep into the army and raise the fire as a sign. Only Cai He is left alone. I am useful under the tent."" The second call to Taishi Ci to pay: ""You can lead three thousand soldiers, go straight to the boundary of Huangzhou, cut off Cao Cao and Fei's army, and force Cao's soldiers to set fire to the number; The red flag is the arrival of Marquis Wu in response to the troops."" The two groups of soldiers were the farthest and started first. The third summoned Lü Meng to lead 3,000 soldiers to Wulin to meet Gan Ning and burn Cao Cao's stronghold. Fourth, he called Ling to lead three thousand soldiers and headed directly to the head of Yiling. Just seeing the fire in Ulin, respond with soldiers. Fifth, he summoned Dong Xi to lead three thousand soldiers, and took Hanyang directly; from Hanchuan, he rushed to Cao Cao's village, and watched the white flag to meet him. Sixthly, he summoned Pan Zhang to lead three thousand soldiers and go to Hanyang to meet Dong's attack. The six groups of ships went their separate ways. He ordered Huang Gai to arrange fire boats, and sent a small pawn to rush to book an appointment with Cao Cao to come down tonight. On one side, four warships were called, and they followed the Huanggai ship. The first team leader Han Dang, the second team leader Zhou Tai, the third team leader Jiang Qin, and the fourth team leader Chen Wu: Each of the four teams led 300 warships, with fire in front of each team. Twenty boats. Zhou Yuzi and Cheng Pu oversaw the battle on the big scorpion, Xu Sheng and Ding Feng were the guards on the left and right, leaving only Lu Su to join Kanze and all the advisors to guard the village. Cheng Pu was very respectful when he saw that Zhou Yu had a method in adjusting the army.","Zhou Yu sends Gan Ning with Cai Zhong to destroy the grain supply of Cao Cao, telling them to go flying the banners of the north to fool the enemy. Taishi Ci is sent to Huangzhou to be ready to cut off Cao Cao’s men in Hefei. ‘Watch for a red banner,’ said Zhou Yu. ‘That will be the sign that our Lord Sun Quan’s troops have arrived. Lü Meng is sent to assist Gan Ning and to burn the main camp of Cao Cao; another detachment is sent to Yiling ready for action, while yet another detachment is sent to take Hanyang. From there they are to attack the enemy along the river. Once they are on their way, Huang Gai readies his fireboats and then sends a letter to Cao Cao announcing that he will desert that very night. Four fleets, each of three hundred ships, are ready, with fireboats in the van. News comes from Sun Quan that he has despatched troops towards Qizhou and Huangzhou.","And Zhou Yu knew Lu Su spoke wisely. Having summoned the leaders to receive orders, first Zhou Yu gave orders to Gan Ning: “Take with you the false deserter Cai Zhong and his soldiers, and go along the south bank, showing the flags of Cao Cao, till you reach the Black Forest just opposite the enemy's main store of grain and forage. Then you are to penetrate as deeply as possible into the enemy's lines and light a torch as a signal. Cai He is to be kept in camp for another purpose.” The next order was: “Taishi Ci is to lead two thousand troops as quickly as possible to Huangzhou and cut the enemy's communications with Hefei. When near the enemy, he is to give a signal; and if he sees a red flag, he will know that our lord, Sun Quan, is at hand with reinforcements.” Gan Ning and Taishi Ci had the farthest to go and started first. Then Lu Meng was sent into the Black Forest with three thousand troops as a support to Gan Ning who was ordered to set fire to Cao Cao's depot. A fourth party of three thousand troops was led by Ling Tong to the borders of Yiling and attack as soon as the signal from the forest was seen. A fifth party of three thousand under Dong Xi went to Hanyang to fall upon the enemy along the River Han. Their signal was a white flag; and a sixth division of three thousand commanded by Pan Zhang would support them. When these six parties had gone off. Huang Gai got ready his fire ships and sent a soldier with a note to tell Cao Cao that he was coming over that evening. Four naval squadrons were told off to support Huang Gai. The four squadrons, each of three hundred ships, were placed under four commanders: Han Dang, Zhou Tai, Jiang Qin, and Chen Wu. Twenty fire ships preceded each fleet. Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu went on board one of the large ships to direct the battle. Their guards were Ding Feng and Xu Sheng. Lu Su, Kan Ze, and the advisers were left to guard the camp. Cheng Pu was greatly impressed with Zhou Yu's ordering of the grand attack."
宮謂布曰：“曹操遠來，勢不能久。將軍可以步騎出屯於外，宮將餘衆閉守於內。操若攻將軍，宮引兵擊其背；若來攻城，將軍為救於後。不過旬日，操軍食盡，可一鼓而破：此乃掎角之勢也。”布曰：“公言極是。”遂歸府收拾戎裝。時方冬寨，分付從人多帶綿衣。布妻嚴氏聞之，出問曰：“君欲何往？”布告以陳宮之謀。嚴氏曰：“君委全城，捐妻子，孤軍遠出，倘一旦有變，妾豈得為將軍之妻乎？”布躊躇未決，三日不出。宮入見曰：“操軍四面圍城，若不早出，必受其困。”布曰：“吾思遠出不如堅守。”宮曰：“近聞操軍糧少，遣人往許都去取，早晚將至。將軍可引精兵往斷其糧道。此計大妙。”布然其言，復入內對嚴氏說知此事。嚴氏泣曰：“將軍若出，陳宮、高順安能堅守城池？倘有差失，悔無及矣！妾昔在長安，已為將軍所棄，幸賴龐舒私藏妾身，再得與將軍相聚；孰知今又棄妾而去乎？將軍前程萬里，請勿以妾為念！”言罷痛哭。布聞言愁悶不決，必告貂蟬。貂蟬曰：“將軍與妾作主，勿輕騎自出。”布曰：“汝無憂慮。吾有畫戟、赤兔馬，誰敢近我！”乃出謂陳宮曰：“操軍糧至者，詐也。操多詭計，吾未敢動。”宮出歎曰：“吾等死無葬身之地矣！”布於是終日不出，只同嚴氏、貂蟬飲酒解悶。謀士許汜、王楷入見布，進計曰：“今袁術在淮南，聲勢大振。將軍舊曾與彼約婚，今何不仍求之？彼兵若至，內外夾攻，操不難破也。”布從其計，卽日修書，就着二人前去。許汜曰：“須得一軍引路衝出方好。”布令張遼。郝萌兩個引兵一千，送出隘口。是夜二更，張遼在前，郝萌在後，保着許汜、王楷殺出城去。抹過玄德寨，衆將追趕不及，已出隘口。郝萌將五百人，跟許汜、王楷而去。張遼引一半軍回來，到隘口時，雲長攔住。未及交鋒，高順引兵出城救應，接入城中去了。,"Gong said to the cloth: ""Cao Cao is coming from afar, but his power cannot last long. The general can ride out of the camp on foot, and the rest of the palace guards will be kept inside. If Cao Cao attacks the general, the palace will lead troops to attack him on the back; if he comes to attack the city, the general will In order to save the latter. After only ten days, the army will run out of food, and it will be broken in one drum: this is the trend of squatting."" Bu said: ""The public statement is very true."" Then he returned to the government to pack up his uniform. At the time of Fang Dongzhai, the subordinates brought more cotton clothes. When Bu's wife Yan Shi heard this, she asked, ""Where do you want to go?"" The announcement was based on Chen Gong's plan. Yan Shi said: ""The monarch entrusts the whole city, donates his wife, and leaves the army alone. If there is a change, how can the concubine be the general's wife?"" Bu hesitated and did not leave for three days. Gong entered and said: ""The Cao army is besieging the city on all sides. If you don't leave early, you will be trapped."" Bu said: ""I think it's better to stick to it when I go far away."" Gong said: ""I heard recently that Cao's army is short of rations, so I sent people to Xudu to fetch it, sooner or later. It's coming. The general can lead the elite troops to cut off his food supply. This is a great plan."" Bran his words, and re-entered to tell the Yan family about this. Mrs. Yan wept and said, ""If the general leaves, will Chen Gong and Gao Shun'an be able to defend the city? If there is a mistake, I will regret it later! The concubine was in Chang'an and was abandoned by the general. Fortunately, Pang Shu hid the concubine's body in private, and I won't be able to get it again. Gather with the general; who knows now that he will abandon his concubine and go away? When Bu heard that he was undecided, he would tell Diaochan. Diaochan said: ""The general and the concubine are the masters, don't go out lightly."" Bu said: ""You have no worries. I have a painted halberd, a red rabbit and a horse, who would dare to approach me!"" It's a fraud. There are so many tricks, I didn't dare to do it."" Gong Chu sighed, ""We have no place to be buried!"" Bu then went out all day, only drinking with Yan Shi and Diao Chan to relieve the boredom. Adviser Xu Si and Wang Kai came to see Bu, and said, ""Today Yuan Shu is in Huainan, and his momentum is very strong. The general once made an appointment with him, so why not ask him now? If his troops arrive, they will attack from both inside and outside, and it will not be difficult to break through. ."" Bu followed his plan, repaired the book every day, and went with the two of them. Xu Si said: ""It is better to have an army lead the way and rush out."" Zhang Liao was ordered. Hao Meng led a thousand troops and sent them out of the pass. It was the second watch of the night, with Zhang Liao in front and Hao Meng in the back, protecting Xu Si and Wang Kai from the city. After the Xuande Village was wiped out, the generals could not catch up and had already left the pass. Hao Meng sent five hundred people away with Xu Si and Wang Kai. Zhang Liao led half of his army back, and when he reached the pass, the Chief Yun stopped him. Before the confrontation, Gao Shun led his troops out of the city to rescue the response, and went into the city.","Trapped there and besieged, Lü Bu wants to strike out from the city to attack his enemies. But he is persuaded by the fearful tears of his wife and concubine not to leave them. Distraught and depressed, he sinks into alcoholism. It is in these circumstances that his advisers Xu Si and Wang Kai revive the idea of an alliance with Yuan Shu through the marriage of Lü Bu’s daughter to Yuan Shu’s son. With great bravery, Xu Si and Wang Kai make their way through enemy lines to Yuan Shu.","“They have come from far and cannot maintain this for long,” said Chen Gong. “General, go out with your horse and foot and take up a position outside, leaving me to maintain the defense with the remainder of our troops. If he engages you, I will come out and strike at his rear ranks; if he attacks the city, you can come to our aid. In ten days their stores will fail, and we can beat them off. This will place them between the ox-horns.” “The advice seems good,” said Lu Bu. Lu Bu went back to his palace and prepared his weapons. As it was the depth of winter, he made his army take plenty of wadded clothing to keep them warm. Lady Yan, his wife, heard of it and came to ask whither he was going. He told her of Chen Gong's plan. She said, “My lord, you are leaving an undamaged city, abandoning your wife and little ones, and going with a paltry force. Should any untoward event happen, will your handmaid and her lord ever meet again?” Lu Bu hesitated and for three days made no move. Then Chen Gong came to see him again and said, “The enemy are all round the city, and unless you go out soon you will be quite hemmed in.” “I am thinking it would be better to maintain a stubborn defense,” said Lu Bu. “Our enemies are short of food and have sent for supplies to Xuchang. These will soon arrive, and you should go out with some veterans and intercept the convoy. That loss would be a heavy blow.” Lu Bu agreed and went in to tell his wife the new plan. She wept saying, “If you go, do you think Chen Gong and others equal to the defense of the city? Should anything go wrong, you would be very sorry. You abandoned me at Changan, and it was only through the fortunate kindness of Pang Shu that I was hidden from our enemies and rejoined you. Who would have thought you would leave me again? But go, go your way as far as you wish, and do not mind your wife.” And she wept bitterly. Lu Bu very sadly went to take leave of Diao Chan who said, “You are my lord and my life; you must not be careless and ride out alone.” “You need not fear; with my mighty trident halberd and Red-Hare, who dare come near me?” He went out. But when he met Chen Gong, he said, “That story about supplies for Cao Cao is all false, one of his many ruses. I am not going to stir.” Chen Gong sighed; he felt all was lost. “We shall die, and no person shall know our burial place,” said he. Thereupon Lu Bu remained in his own quarters with his ladies, drinking freely to dissipate his sorrows. Two of his advisers, Xu Si and Wang Kai, went in and proposed, “Yuan Shu in the South of River Huai is very powerful. Why not write to him to renew the marriage alliance? Yuan Shu can hardly refuse to rescue the affianced bride of his son.” So Lu Bu wrote and bade these two take the letter. Xu Si said, “You ought to send a strong escort with us to force a way through.” So Lu Bu told off one thousand troops and two of his generals, Zhang Liao and He Meng, to conduct his messenger beyond the pass. They started that same night at the second watch, Zhang Liao leading and He Meng bringing up the rear. They got out of the city, crept past Liu Bei's camp, and got beyond the danger zone. Then half the escort went on, and Zhang Liao led the remainder back toward the city. At the pass he found Guan Yu waiting. However, at that moment Gao Shun came to his help, and they all returned and reentered the gates."
且說呂布在下邳，自恃糧食足備，且有泗水之險，安心坐守，可保無虞。陳宮曰：“今操兵方來，可乘其寨柵未定，以逸擊勞，無不勝者。”布曰：“吾方屢敗，不可輕出。待其來攻而後擊之，皆落泗水矣。”遂不聽陳宮之言。過數日，曹兵下寨已定。操統衆將至城下，大叫：“呂布答話！”布上城而立。操謂布曰：“聞奉先又欲結婚袁術，吾故領兵至此。夫術有反逆大罪，而公有討董卓之功，今何自棄其前功而從逆賊耶？倘城池一破，悔之晚矣！若早來降，共扶王室，當不失封侯之位。”布曰：“丞相且退，尚容商議。”陳宮在布側大罵曹操奸賊，一箭射中其麾蓋。操指宮恨曰：“吾誓殺汝！”遂引兵攻城。,"Let’s say that Lü Bu was in Xiapi, and he was confident that he had enough food and that he was in danger of Sishui. Chen Gong said: ""Today, when the troops are coming, you can take advantage of the undecided fortress and attack them with ease. No one is invincible."" Bu said: ""We have suffered repeated defeats, and we must not take it lightly. Wait for them to attack and then attack them. Falling into Sishui."" Then he did not listen to Chen Gong's words. After a few days, Cao's troops have settled down. Cao Tong went to the city and shouted, ""Lü Bu answers!"" Bu stood up on the city. Cao said to Bu: ""I heard that Fengxian wanted to marry Yuan Shu again, so I led the army here. Hu Shu has committed a serious crime of rebellion, and the public has the merits of fighting against Dong Zhuo. It's too late! If you come to surrender early, and support the royal family together, you will not lose your title."" Bu said: ""The prime minister retreats, it is still possible to discuss."" Chen Gong cursed Cao Cao as a traitor by the side of Bu, and shot him with an arrow. cover. Cao pointed to Gonghen and said, ""I swear to kill you!"" So he led his troops to attack the city.","With nowhere else to go and with Zhang Fei closing in on him, Lü Bu has no option but to escape to his fallback city of Xiapi. Trapped there and besieged, Lü Bu wants to strike out from the city to attack his enemies.","Lu Bu felt very secure in his refuge. He had good store of grain, and he had the protection of River Si, so he sat quiet, satisfied that he could maintain his defense. So he allowed Cao Cao's army to approach without molestation. “You ought to attack Cao Cao's army as they come up, before they have time to make camps and defenses. They will only have a fatigued army to oppose to your fresh troops, and you will certainly defeat them.” So said Chen Gong, but Lu Bu replied, “I have suffered too many defeats lately to take any risk. Wait till they actually attack, and you will see them floating away on the waters.” So Lu Bu neglected the confidant's advice and waited till the enemy had settled into their camp. This done, the attackers advanced against the city. From the foot of the wall, Cao Cao called to Lu Bu to listen while he spoke. Lu Bu ascended to the wall where he stood. Cao Cao addressed him, saying, “When I heard that your family and that of Yuan Shu were likely to be united by marriage, I sent an army against you. Yuan Shu was guilty of treason, while you had to your credit on the destruction of Dong Zhuo. For what reason have you sacrificed all your merits to throw in your lot with a rebel? It will be over late to regret when this city shall have fallen. But if you surrender and help me to support the ruling house, you shall not lose your rank.” Lu Bu replied, “If the Prime Minister will retire, we may be able to discuss the matter.” But Chen Gong, standing near his master, began to rail at Cao Cao for a rebel and shot an arrow that struck his plumed helmet. “My oath, but I will slay you at least!” cried Cao Cao, pointing his finger at Chen Gong. Then the attack on the walls began."
※※※,※※※,"With nowhere else to go and with Zhang Fei closing in on him, Lü Bu has no option but to escape to his fallback city of Xiapi.","Cao Cao was very pleased with his success and at once began to scheme for the taking of Xiapi, the sole place now left to Lu Bu, where he had taken refuge."

却說孫策自霸江東，兵精糧足。建安四年，襲取廬江，敗劉勳，使虞翻馳檄豫章，豫章太守華歆投降。自此聲勢大振，乃遣張紘往許昌上表獻捷。曹操知孫策強盛，歎曰：“獅兒難與爭鋒也！”遂以曹仁之女許配孫策幼弟孫匡，兩家結婚。留張紘在許昌。孫策求為大司馬，曹操不許。策恨之，常有襲許都之心。於是吳郡太守許貢，乃暗遣使赴許都上書於曹操。其略曰：,"But he said that Sun Ce dominated the east of the Yangtze River, and his troops were rich in grain and food. In the fourth year of Jian'an, he attacked the Lujiang River, defeated Liu Xun, made Yu Fanchi to Yuzhang, and Hua Xin, the prefect of Yuzhang, surrendered. Since then, the momentum has been greatly increased, and Zhang Hong was sent to Xuchang to offer victory. Cao Cao knew that Sun Ce was strong, and sighed, ""It is difficult for a lion to compete with each other!"" So he married Sun Ce's younger brother Sun Kuang with Cao Ren's daughter, and the two married. Zhang Hong was left in Xuchang. Sun Ce asked to be the Grand Sima, but Cao Cao refused. Ce hates it, and often has the heart of attacking Xudu. So Xu Gong, the prefect of Wu County, secretly sent an envoy to Xu Capital to write to Cao Cao. It briefly says:","Sun Ce by the year AD 199 is the ruler of the south. So strong has he become that Cao Cao is now seriously worried by him. ‘There is no way we can confront this lion directly,’ he says, ‘so why don’t we instead bind him to us by marriage?’ So Cao Ren’s daughter is married to Sun Ce’s brother, Sun Kuang. All is well until Sun Ce petitions the emperor for a high-status post, which Cao Cao refuses to give him. In his anger, Sun Ce declares he will attack the capital. Hearing of this, one of his city governors, Xu Gong, secretly writes a letter to be taken to Cao Cao, warning of the plot.","Sun Ce gradually became supreme on the southeast of the Great River ((Yangtze River)). In the fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 199), he took Lujiang by the defeat of the Governor Liu Xun. He dispatched Yu Fan with a dispatch to Governor Hua Xin of Yuzhang, and Hua Xin surrendered. Thence Sun Ce's renown increased, and he boldly sent a memorial on his military successes to the Emperor by the hand of Zhang Hong. Cao Cao saw in Sun Ce a powerful rival and said, “He is a lion difficult to contend with.” So Cao Cao betrothed his niece, daughter of Cao Ren, to Sun Kuang, the youngest brother of Sun Ce, thus connecting the two families by marriage. Cao Cao also retained Zhang Hong near him in the capital. Then Sun Ce sought the title of Grand Commander, one of the highest offices of state, but Cao Cao prevented the attainment of this ambition, and Sun Ce keenly resented it. Henceforward his thoughts turned toward an attack on Cao Cao. About this time the Governor of Wujun, Xu Gong, sent a secret letter to the capital to Cao Cao, saying:"
龔景犒軍畢，鄒靖欲回。玄德曰：“近聞中郎將盧植與賊首張角戰於廣宗，備昔曾師事盧植，欲往助之。”於是鄒靖引軍自回，玄德與關、張引本部五百人投廣宗來。至盧植軍中，入帳施禮，具道來意。盧植大喜，留在帳前聽調。,"Gong Jingyan finished his army, and Zou Jing wanted to return. Xuande said: ""I have heard that Zhonglang will fight Lu Zhi with the thief Zhang Jiao at Guangzong, and Bei had been a teacher of Lu Zhi in the past, and I want to help him."" So Zou Jing led the army to return, Xuande and Guan and Zhang cited the headquarters. Five hundred people came to Guangzong. In the army of Lu Zhi, he entered the tent and gave salutes, with the meaning of Taoism. Lu Zhi was overjoyed and stayed in front of the tent to listen to the tune.","News now reaches the three men that the rebel leader Zhang Jue is attacking the neighbouring city of Guangzong, and that the city is defended by Xuande’s old teacher, Lu Zhi. So off the three brothers-in-arms go, with their five hundred men, and my goodness is Lu Zhi delighted to see them!","After the celebrations in honor of victory were over, Commander Zhou Jing proposed to return to Youzhou. But Liu Bei said, “We are informed that Imperial Commander Lu Zhi has been struggling with a horde of rebels led by Zhang Jue at Guangzong. Lu Zhi was once my teacher, and I want to go to help him.” So Liu Bei and Zhou Jing separated, and the three brothers with their troops made their way of Guangzong. They found Lu Zhi's camp, were admitted to his presence, and declared the reason of their coming. The Commander received them with great joy, and they remained with him while he made his plans."
數日之後，董卓餘黨李蒙、王方在城中為賊內應，偷開城門，四路賊軍一齊擁入。呂布左衝右突，攔擋不住，引數百騎往靑瑣門外，呼王允曰：“勢急矣！請司徒上馬，同出關去，別圖良策。”允曰：“若蒙社稷之靈，得安國家，吾之愿也；若不獲已，則允奉身以死。臨難苟免，吾不為也。為我謝關東諸公，努力以國家為念！”呂布再三相勸，王允只是不肯去。不一時，各門火燄竟天，呂布只得棄却家小，引百餘騎飛奔出關，投袁術去了。,"A few days later, Li Meng and Wang Fang of Dong Zhuo's remaining party were in the city for the thieves and secretly opened the city gate, and all four thieves rushed in. Lü Bu rushed from left to right, but could not stop him. He led several hundred cavalry to the gate of Susuo. He called to Wang Yun and said, ""The situation is urgent! Please mount Situ and go out with us. Don't try to make a good plan."" Yun said, ""If you get caught The spirit of the Sheji, it is my wish to secure the country; if I do not have it, I promise to die for my body. I will not do it if it is difficult to avoid it. Thank you to the princes of Guandong for me, and try to think of the country!"" Lv Bu After further persuasion, Wang Yun just refused to go. After a while, the flames of the various gates were so high that Lu Bu had to abandon his family and lead more than a hundred cavalry to fly out of the gate, and go to Yuan Shu.","At the same time, an uprising takes place, led by Dong Zhuo’s surviving supporters inside the city itself. Lü Bu despatches messengers, pleading with Wang Yun to escape and join him. Wang Yun replies that he hopes to restore peace in the city, but if he fails then his body would be his final sacrifice. He recommends that Lü Bu go east to join Yuan Shu and his troops, who also wish to restore the Han. Then the insurgents inside open the city gates to the rebel army, who pour in. And so Lü Bu, left outside, has to flee, leaving his family to their mercy.","Then a remnant of Dong Zhuo's adherents still in the city, led by Li Meng and Wang Fang, began to lend aid to the attackers; and by and by they secretly opened the city gate and the besiegers poured in. Lu Bu exerted himself to the utmost but could not stem the tide. At the head of some hundred horse, he dashed over to the Black Lock Gate and called out to Wang Yun, who was on the other side. “The case is desperate now. Ride with me to a place of safety.” Wang Yun replied, “If I am gifted with the holy spirit of the state, I shall succeed in restoring the tranquillity which I desire; but if I have it not, then I offer my body a sacrifice. I will not quail before dangers. Thank the noble supporters beyond the Pass for their efforts, and bid them remember their country.” Lu Bu urged Wang Yun again and again, but Wang Yun would not leave. Soon flames started up ail over the city, and Lu Bu had to leave, abandoning his family to their fate. He fled to seek refuge with Yuan Shu."
又操軍吏士，其可戰者，皆出自幽、冀，或故營部曲，咸怨曠思歸，流涕北顧。其餘兗、豫之民，及呂布、張楊之餘衆，覆亡迫脅，權時苟從；各被創夷，人為讎敵。若回旆反徂，登高岡而擊鼓吹，揚素揮以啓降路，必土崩瓦解，不俟血刃。,"Also, the officers and men of the army were trained, and those who could fight were all from You, Ji, or the old camp. The rest of the people of Yan and Yu, as well as the rest of Lü Bu and Zhang Yang, were threatened with perishment, and they obeyed in time of power. If you go back and fight back, climb the high hills and attack and advocate, Yang Su waved to open the way of surrender, it will fall apart and not wait for blood.","For example, moving the capital; murdering officials who disagreed with him; looting the imperial tomb of Prince Xiao, a member of the founding clique of the Zhou dynasty; aiding rebels; and effectively imprisoning the emperor within his own palace by posting his own men around the buildings.","“Of the hordes of Cao Cao, those who can fight are from the north or from other camps, and they all desire to return home. They weep whenever they look to the north. The others belong to Yanzhou or Yuzhou, being remnants of the armies of Lu Bu and Zhang Yang. Beaten, stern necessity forced them to accept service, but they take it only as a temporary expedient. They who have been wounded hate each other. If I give the signal to return and send my drums to the mountain tops, and wave the white flag to show them they may surrender, they will melt away like dew before the sun, and no blood will be shed. The victory will be mine."
且說曹操得了徐州，心中大喜，商議起兵攻下邳。程昱曰：“布今止有下邳一城，若逼之太急，必死戰而投袁術矣。布與術合，其勢難攻。今可使能事者守住淮南徑路，內防呂布，外當袁術。況今山東尚有臧霸、孫觀之徒未曾歸順，防之亦不可忽也。”操曰：“吾自當山東諸路。其淮南徑路，請玄德當之。”玄德曰：“丞相將令，安敢有違？”次日，玄德留糜竺、簡雍在徐州，帶孫乾、關、張引軍往守淮南徑路。曹操自引兵攻下邳。,"Let's say that Cao Cao won Xuzhou, and he was overjoyed, and he discussed raising an army to attack Pi. Cheng Yu said: ""Bu now has a city called Xiapi. If you push too hard, you will die and join Yuan Shu. The combination of Bu and Shu will make it difficult to attack. Now you can defend the Huainan route and defend from the inside. Lü Bu is Yuan Shu outside. Besides, there are still disciples of Zang Ba and Sun Guan in Shandong who have not surrendered, so it is also important to guard against them."" Cao said, ""I will be the Shandong route. As for the Huainan route, please Xuande."" Xuande said: ""The prime minister's general order, An dare to violate?"" The next day, Xuande left Mi Zhu and Jian Yong in Xuzhou, and led Sun Qian, Guan, and Zhang to lead the army to guard the Huainan route. Cao Cao led his troops to attack Pi.","With nowhere else to go and with Zhang Fei closing in on him, Lü Bu has no option but to escape to his fallback city of Xiapi.","Cao Cao was very pleased with his success and at once began to scheme for the taking of Xiapi, the sole place now left to Lu Bu, where he had taken refuge. Cheng Yu said the course was inadvisable. “If Lu Bu be pressed too hard, he may get clear by a desperate effort and throw himself into the arms of our especial enemy, Yuan Shu. These two as allies would be difficult to overcome. Rather send a capable man to guard the South of River Huai, one able to secure you against Lu Bu on one hand and to hold Yuan Shu on the other. Moreover the bandits are in Huashang Mountains and still our enemies. They must be watched.” Cao Cao replied, “I can keep the whole of Huashang Mountains, and I will request Liu Bei to take the south.” “Could I dare withstand your command?” said Liu Bei. So forthwith Liu Bei, leaving Mi Zhu and Jian Yong at Xuzhou, went south, taking in his train Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Sun Qian. And Cao Cao led his army to Xiapi."

張讓等知外兵到，共議曰：“此何進之謀也；我等不先下手，皆滅族矣。”乃先伏刀斧手五十人於長樂宮嘉德門內，入告何太后曰：“今大將軍矯詔召外兵至京師，欲滅臣等，望娘娘垂憐賜救。”太后曰：“汝等可詣大將軍府謝罪。”讓曰：“若到相府，骨肉虀粉矣。望娘娘宣大將軍入宮諭止之。如其不從，臣等只就娘娘前請死。”太后乃降詔宣進。進得詔便行。主簿陳琳諫曰：“太后此詔，必是十常侍之謀，切不可去。去必有禍。”進曰：“太后詔我，有何禍事？”袁紹曰：“今謀已泄，事已露，將軍尚欲入宮耶？”曹操曰：“先召十常侍出，然後可入。”進笑曰：“此小兒之見也。吾掌天下之權，十常侍敢待如何？”紹曰：“公必欲去，我等引甲士護從，以防不測。”於是袁紹、曹操各選精兵五百，命袁紹之弟袁術領之。袁術全身披掛，引兵布列靑瑣門外。紹與操帶劍護送何進至長樂宮前。黃門傳懿旨云：“太后特宣大將軍，餘人不許輒入。”將袁紹、曹操等都阻住宮門外。何進昂然直入。至嘉德殿門，張讓、段珪迎出，左右圍住，進大驚。讓厲聲責進曰：“董后何罪，妄以鴆死？國母喪葬，託疾不出！汝本屠沽小輩，我等薦之天子，以致榮貴：不思報効，欲相謀害！汝言我等甚濁，其淸者是誰？”進慌急，欲尋出路，宮門盡閉，伏甲齊出，將何進砍為兩段。後人有詩歎之曰：,"When Zhang Rang and the others knew that the foreign troops were coming, they discussed together: ""What is the plan of advancing here? If I don't wait for the first move, all the clans will be wiped out."" Fifty swordsmen and axemen entered the Jiade Gate of Changle Palace and told the Empress Dowager He first. Said: ""The general Jiao Zhao has summoned foreign troops to the capital. If you want to destroy the ministers and others, I hope the empress will show you mercy and help me."" I hope that the empress dowager will enter the palace and order the general to stop him. If he does not obey, the ministers will only be asked to die in front of the empress."" The queen mother sent an edict to Xuan Jin. Enter the edict. The chief clerk, Chen Lin, remonstrated: ""The empress dowager's edict must be the plan of the ten permanent attendants. You must not go. If you go, there will be disasters."" Jin said: ""The empress dowager has ordered me, what's wrong?"" Yuan Shao said: ""This plan has been completed. Xie, the matter has been revealed, the general still wants to enter the palace?"" Cao Cao said: ""First call the ten permanent servants out, and then you can enter."" Jin smiled and said: ""This is the view of the child. I hold the power of the world, the ten permanent servants. How dare you do it?"" Shao said, ""Your Excellency must want to go, and I will lead the soldiers to protect him in case of unexpected events."" So Yuan Shao and Cao Cao each selected 500 elite soldiers and ordered Yuan Shao's younger brother Yuan Shu to lead them. Yuan Shu was draped all over his body, and led his troops to line up outside the gate of Suo. Shao Yucao brought a sword and escorted He Jin to the front of Changle Palace. The decree of the Huangmen Chuanyi said: ""The queen mother has specially announced the general, and the rest are not allowed to enter."" Yuan Shao, Cao Cao and others were blocked from the palace gate. He Jin stepped in proudly. When they reached the gate of Jiade Hall, Zhang Rang and Duan Gui greeted them, surrounded them from left and right, and were shocked when they entered. Rang sternly rebuked Jin and said: ""What's the crime of Empress Dong, rashly using poison to die? The mother of the country is buried, and she will not be able to care for the disease! You are slaughtering the younger generation, and I have recommended the emperor, so that you are honored and honored: not thinking of retribution, but wanting to kill each other You said that I was waiting very turbidly, who is it?"" Jin panicked and wanted to find a way out. The palace gate was closed, and he came out in full armour, cutting He Jin into two sections. Later generations have a poem to sigh:","One of the leaders who responds to He Jin’s call to arms is none other than Dong Zhuo, who had so spectacularly failed to suppress the Yellow Headband rebels. He sends an advance petition to the capital Luoyang, asking to be allowed into the city and claiming he wants to protect the dynasty. He Jin agrees, but many others warn him of the dangers. ‘Dong Zhuo hides the viciousness of a wolf under the guise of innocence. Let him in, and disaster will result,’ says Lu Zhi, the former teacher of Xuande, who has been released from prison after his good name has been cleared following appeals made to the emperor. ‘Keep him out, and order will be maintained.’ But once again He Jin ignores good advice. Dong Zhuo’s arrival creates turmoil. Yuan Shao and Cao Cao want to attack the palace and wipe out the Ten Eunuchs, but He Jin once again misreads the situation. Responding to a command from his sister, the Empress He, to visit her in the court, he enters the inner court alone while Yuan Shao and Cao Cao are forced to wait outside. It is a trap. No sooner has He Jin entered than he is cut in half by the supporters of the Ten Eunuchs. When Yuan Shao calls out to see if he is ready to leave, he is answered by having He Jin’s head thrown over the palace gate.","The eunuchs knew this move was directed against them and recognized that their only chance for safety was to strike the first blow. So they first hid a band of fifty armed ruffians at the Gate of Grand Virtue in the Palace of Happiness, then they went in to see Empress He. They said, “The General, feigning to act under command, has called up armies to the capital to destroy us. We pray you, Your Majesty, pity and save us!” “Go to the General and confess your faults,” said the Empress. “If we did, then should we be cut to mincemeat. Rather summon the General into your presence and command him to cease. If he will not, then we pray but die in your presence.” The Empress issued the requisite command, and He Jin was just going to her when Counselor Chen Lin advised him not to enter, saying, “The eunuchs are certainly behind the order and mean your harm.” But He Jin could only see the command of the Empress and was blind to all else. “Our plot is no longer a secret;” said Yuan Shao, “still you may go if you are ready to fight your way in.” “Get the eunuchs out first,” said Cao Cao. “Silly children!” said He Jin. “What can they do against the man who holds the forces of the empire in the palm of his hand?” Yuan Shao said, “If you will go, then we will come as a guard, just as a precaution.” Whereupon both Yuan Shao and Cao Cao chose five hundred best men under their command, at whose head they placed a brother of Yuan Shao, named Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu, clad in mail, drew up his troops outside the palace entrance, while Yuan Shao and Cao Cao, holding swords, went as escort. When He Jin neared the palace, the eunuchs said, “The orders are to admit the Imperial Guardian and none other.” So the escort was detained outside. He Jin went in proudly. At the Gate of Grand Virtue, he was met by Zhang Rang and Duan Gui, and their followers quickly closed in around him. He Jin began to feel alarmed. Then Zhang Rang in a harsh voice began to revile him. “What crime had Empress Dong committed that she should have been put to death? And when the Mother of the Country was buried, who feigned sickness and did not attend? We raised you and your paltry, huckstering family to all the dignity and wealth you have, and this is your gratitude! You would slay us. You call us sordid and dirty; who is the cleaner?” He Jin was panic stricken and looked about for a way to escape, but the eunuchs closed him in, and then the assassins appeared and cut He Jin into halves. Closing the days of the Hans, and the years of their rule were near spent, Stupid and tactless was He Jin, yet stood he highest in office;"
却說當夜張遼一箭射黃蓋下水，救得曹操登岸，尋着馬匹走時，軍已大亂。韓當冒煙突火來攻水寨，忽聽得士卒報道：“後梢舵上一人，高叫將軍表字。”韓當細聽，但聞高叫：“義公救我！”當曰：“此黃公覆也！”急敎救起。見黃蓋負箭着傷，咬出箭桿，箭頭陷在肉內。韓當急為脫去濕衣，用刀剜出箭頭，扯旗束之，脫自己戰袍與黃蓋穿了，先令別船送回大寨醫治。原來黃蓋深知水性，故大寒之時，和甲墮江，也逃得性命。,"However, he said that when Zhang Liao shot Huang Gai into the water at night, and rescued Cao Cao from landing, when he found his horse and left, the army was in chaos. Han Dang came to attack the water village with smoke and fire, and suddenly heard a report from his soldiers: ""There is a man on the helm at the rear, shouting the words of the general."" This Huang Gong is also refuted!"" He hurriedly rescued him. Seeing that Huang Gai was injured by an arrow, he bit out the shaft of the arrow, and the arrow was stuck in the flesh. Han Dang was in a hurry to take off his wet clothes, cut out arrows with a knife, pulled the flag and tied it up, took off his shirt and put it on, and sent another ship to Dazhai for treatment. It turned out that Huang Gai knew water well, so when it was cold, he and Jia fell into the river and escaped with their lives.","He hauls him onto dry land, and they then mount upon horseback and flee even as the whole army descends into chaos. Meanwhile, Han Dang, one of the commanders from the south, is steering to the attack on Cao Cao’s naval yard, trying to find his way through the smoke and flames, when one of his men says, ‘There is someone being dragged along, clutching at the rudder and calling your name!’ Han Dang stands still and listens carefully and sure enough he hears a voice crying, ‘Dang, save me!’ Realizing that this is Huang Gai, he has him pulled up out of the water. With his teeth he yanks the arrow shaft out, but the head of the arrow is left behind. Taking his sword, he digs out the arrowhead and then binds up the wound with his own cloak. Having done this, he has Huang Gai transported back to camp, where he recovers, for, as he is a sailor, the fall into the water has not been fatal despite the cold and the weight of his armour.","The last chapter closed with Huang Gai in the water wounded, Cao Cao rescued from immediate danger, and confusion rampant among the soldiers. Pressing forward to attack the naval camp, Han Dang was told by his soldiers that some one was clinging to the rudder of his boat and shouting to him by his familiar name. Han Dang listened carefully and in the voice at once he recognized that Huang Gai was calling to him for help. “That is my friend Huang Gai!” cried he, and they quickly pulled the wounded leader out of the water. Then they saw Huang Gai was wounded for the arrow still stuck. Han Dang bit out the shaft of the arrow but the point was deeply buried in the flesh. They hastily pulled off his wet garments and cut out the metal arrowhead with a dagger, tore up one of the flags, and bound up the wound. Then Han Dang gave Huang Gai his own fighting robe to put on and sent him off in a small boat back to camp. Huang Gai's escape from drowning must be taken as proof of his natural affinity for, or sympathy with, water."
却說曹仁收拾殘軍，就新野屯住，使曹洪去見曹操，具言失利之事。操大怒曰：“諸葛村夫，安敢如此！”催動三軍，漫山塞野，盡至新野下寨。傳令軍士一面搜山，一面填塞白河。令大軍分作八路，一齊去取樊城。劉曄曰：“丞相初至襄陽，必須先買民心。今劉備盡遷新野百姓入樊城，若我兵逕進，二縣為虀粉矣；不如先使人招降劉備。備卽不降，亦可見我愛民之心；若其來降，則荊州之地，可不戰而定也。”操從其言，便問：“誰可為使？”劉曄曰：“徐庶與劉備至厚，今現在軍中，何不命他一往？”操曰：“他去恐不復來。”曄曰：“他若不來，貽笑於人矣。丞相勿疑。”操乃召徐庶至，謂曰：“我今欲踏平樊城，奈憐衆百姓之命。公可往說劉備：如肯來降，免罪賜爵；若更執迷，軍民共戮，玉石俱焚。吾知公忠義，故特使公往。願勿相負。”徐庶受命而行。至樊城，玄德、孔明接見，共訴舊日之情。庶曰：“曹操使庶來招降使君，乃假買民心也。今彼分兵八路，填白河而進，樊城恐不可守，宜速作行計。”玄德欲留徐庶。庶謝曰：“某若不還，恐惹人笑。今老母已喪，抱恨終天。身雖在彼，誓不為設一謀。公有臥龍輔佐，何愁大業不成，庶請辭。”玄德不敢強留。,"However, they said that Cao Ren packed up the remnants of the army, settled in Xinye, and sent Cao Hong to see Cao Cao, stating that he had failed. Cao was furious and said: ""Zhuge village husband, An dare to do this!"" He urged the three armies to spread over the mountains and wilds, all the way to Xinye to go down to the village. The sergeant was ordered to search the mountains and fill the White River on the other. The army was divided into eight routes, and they all went to take Fancheng together. Liu Ye said: ""When the prime minister first arrived in Xiangyang, he must first buy the hearts of the people. Now Liu Bei has moved all the people of Xinye into Fancheng. If my troops marched in, the two counties would be Huangfan; it is better to have people recruit Liu Bei first. It can be seen that I love the people; if they come to surrender, the land of Jingzhou can be settled without fighting."" Cao followed his words and asked, ""Who can be the envoy?"" Liu Ye said, ""Xu Shu and Liu Bei are extremely thick now. Now in the army, why don't you order him to go?"" Cao said, ""I'm afraid he won't come again."" Ye said, ""If he doesn't come, he will be laughed at. Prime Minister, don't doubt it."" Cao called Xu Shu to come, saying Said: ""I want to step on Fancheng now, and I will take pity on the orders of the people. Gong Ke said to Liu Bei: If you are willing to come and surrender, you will be forgiven and granted a title; Go to the public. Please don't bear each other."" Xu Shu was ordered to go. When they arrived in Fancheng, Xuande and Kongming met and shared their old feelings. Shu said: ""Cao Cao sent Shu to recruit the envoy to surrender, which is a fake to buy the hearts of the people. Now he divides his troops into eight routes and fills the Baihe River. Fancheng may not be able to defend, so he should make a quick plan."" Xuande wanted to keep Xu Shu. Shu Xie said: ""If you don't pay back, I'm afraid people will laugh. Now my mother is dead, and I hold grudges forever. Although I am there, I swear not to set up a plan. The public has Wolong to assist, why worry about the failure of the great cause, and the Shu resigns. ""Xuande didn't dare to stay.","However, he has given Cao Ren the chance to escape, and soon Cao Ren has found safety ironically in the ruins of Xinye, where he draws together the remnants of his army. With the power of Cao Ren’s army broken Zhang Fei, Xuande and Kong Ming are now able to start ferrying the people across the river to Fan. Once safely across, they burn the boats. There is no going back. When Cao Cao learns of the tricks Kong Ming has played and the cost to his men, his fury knows no bounds. He now turns the full force of his vast army against his enemy, intent on attacking and seizing Fan. His immediate fury and desire to destroy are curbed by his adviser Liu Ye. He suggests that diplomacy be tried first and that an offer be made to Xuande to surrender so as to spare the suffering of the ordinary people. He knows this will appeal to Xuande’s sense of honour and virtue. He also suggests that Xuande’s old friend Shan Fu be the messenger bearing this proposal. So Shan Fu sets off to visit Xuande. Shan Fu, Xuande and Kong Ming make the most of having the opportunity to be together again, and in confidence Shan Fu tells Xuande not to pay any attention to this seemingly humanitarian offer from Cao Cao. ‘It’s just designed to make him seem humane and to gain popularity. He has eight armies and has filled in the riverbed ready to attack across it. My concern is, to speak frankly, that this city is indefensible. You must get out as soon as possible. I just wish I could stay but I must return to honour this role of messenger. But believe me, my mother’s death is seared into my very heart! While I’ll honour my pledge to stay with Cao Cao, I’ll never, ever help him to develop a plan of attack. Now you’ve Sleeping Dragon with you, all will be well.’ So saying, he makes his farewells and departs. Shan Fu returns to Cao Cao and informs him that Xuande will not surrender.","Cao Ren gathered in the remnants of his army and camped at Xinye, while his colleague Cao Hong went to tell their lord the evil tidings of defeat. “How dare he, this rustic Zhuge Liang!” exclaimed Cao Cao angrily. Cao Cao then hastily sent an overwhelming army to camp near the place and gave orders for enormous works against the city, leveling hills and turning rivers to launch a violent assault on Fankou from every side at once. Then Liu Ye came in to see his lord and said, “Sir, you are new to this region, and you should win over the people's hearts. Liu Bei has moved all the people from Xinye to Fankou. If we march through the country, the people will be ground to powder. It would be well to call upon Liu Bei first to surrender, which will prove to the people that you have a care for them. If he yields, then we get Jingzhou without fighting.” Cao Cao agreed and asked who would be a suitable messenger. Liu Ye suggested Xu Shu. “He is a close friend of Liu Bei, and he is here with the army,” said Liu Ye. “But he will not come back,” objected Cao Cao. “If he does not return, he will be a laughing stock to the whole world; he will come back.” Xu Shu was sent for, and Cao Cao said, “My first intention was to level Fankou with the ground; but out of pity for its people, you may carry an offer to Liu Bei that if he will surrender, he will not only not be punished but he shall be given rank. But if he holds on his present misguided course, the whole of his followers shall be destroyed. Now you are an honest man and so I confide this mission to you, and I trust you will not disappoint me.” Xu Shu said nothing but accepted his orders and went to the city, where he was received by both Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang. They enjoyed a talk over old times before Xu Shu mentioned the object of his mission. Then he said, “Cao Cao has sent me to invite you to surrender, thereby making a bid for popularity. But you ought also to know that he intends to attack the city from every point, that he is damming up the White River's waters to be sent against you, and I fear you will not be able to hold the city. You ought to prepare.” Liu Bei asked Xu Shu to remain with them, but Xu Shu said, “That is impossible, for all the world would ridicule me if I stayed. My old mother is dead, and I never forget my resentment. My body may be over there, but I swear never to form a plan for Cao Cao. You have the Sleeping-Dragon to help you and need have no anxiety about the ultimate achievement of your undertaking. But I must go.” And Xu Shu took his leave. Liu Bei felt he could not press his friend to stay."

次日，曹操佩着寶刀，來至相府，問丞相何在。從人云：“在小閣中。”操逕入。見董卓坐於牀上，呂布侍立於側。卓曰：“孟德來何遲？”操曰：“馬羸行遲耳。”卓顧謂布曰：“吾有西涼進來好馬，奉先可親去揀一騎賜與孟德。”布領令而去。操暗忖曰：“此賊合死！”卽欲拔刀刺之。懼卓力大，未敢輕動。卓胖大不耐久坐，遂倒身而臥，轉面向內。操又思曰：“此賊當休矣！”急掣寶刀在手。恰待要刺，不想董卓仰面看衣鏡中，照見曹操在背後拔刀，急回身問曰：“孟德何為？”時呂布已牽馬至閣外，操惶遽，乃持刀跪下曰：“操有寶刀一口，獻上恩相。”卓接視之，見其刀長尺餘，七寶嵌飾，極其鋒利，果寶刀也；遂遞與呂布收了。操解鞘付布。卓引操出閣看馬。操謝曰：“願借試一騎。”卓就敎與鞍轡。操牽馬出相府，加鞭望東南而去。布對卓曰：“適來曹操似有行刺之狀，及被喝破，故推獻刀。”卓曰：“吾亦疑之。”正說話間，適李儒至，卓以其事告之。儒曰：“操無妻小在京，只獨居寓所。今差人往召，如彼無疑而便來，則是獻刀；如推託不來，則必是行刺，便可擒而問也。”卓然其說，卽差獄卒四人往喚操。去了良久，回報曰：“操不曾回寓，乘馬飛出東門。門吏問之，操曰：‘丞相差我有緊急公事’，縱馬而去矣。”儒曰：“操賊心虛逃竄，行刺無疑矣。”卓大怒曰：“我如此重用，反欲害我！”儒曰：“此必有同謀者，待拏住曹操便可知矣。”卓遂令遍行文書，畫影圖形，捉拏曹操。擒獻者，賞千金，封萬戶侯；窩藏者同罪。,"The next day, Cao Cao, wearing a treasured sword, came to the prime minister's residence and asked where the prime minister was. From the crowd: ""In the small pavilion."" Seeing Dong Zhuo sitting on the bed, Lu Bu was standing beside him. Zhuo said, ""Why is Meng De coming late?"" Cao said, ""Ma Lei is going too late."" Zhuo Gu said to Bu, ""I have a good horse from Xiliang, please go and pick up a horse and give it to Meng De."" Ordered to leave. Cao thought to himself, ""This thief will die together!"" You want to draw a knife and stab him. Afraid of Zhuo's strength, he did not dare to move lightly. Zhuo Pang couldn't sit for long, so he fell on his back and turned inward. Cao thought again and said, ""This thief should stop!"" He hurriedly grabbed the treasured saber in his hand. Just when he was about to be stabbed, he didn't want Dong Zhuo to look up at the clothes mirror and saw Cao Cao drawing his sword behind his back. He hurriedly turned around and asked, ""What is Mengde doing?"" At that time, Lü Bu had already led his horse to the outside of the pavilion. He said, ""I have a treasured saber, and I offer it to you."" Zhuo looked at him and saw that the saber was more than a foot long, with seven treasures inlaid, extremely sharp, and it was a treasured saber, so he handed it over to Lv Bu and received it. Unscrew the sheath and pay the cloth. Zhuo Yincao went out of the pavilion to watch the horse. Cao Xie said, ""I would like to take a ride."" Zhuo then took him to the saddle. Cao led the horse out of the prime minister's mansion, and looked southeast with the whip. Bu said to Zhuo: ""It seems that Cao Cao was stabbing when he came, and he was drunk, so he pushed and offered his sword."" Zhuo said: ""I also doubt it."" While speaking, Li Ruzhi was right, and Zhuo told him about it. . Confucianism said: ""Cao has no wife and child in Beijing, and lives alone in his apartment. Now I send someone to summon him, and if he comes without a doubt, he will offer a knife; if he can't evade him, he must be stabbed, and he can be captured and asked. ""Zuo Ranqi said, and sent four prison guards to call Cao Cao. After going for a long time, he reported: ""Cao never returned to the apartment, and flew out of the east gate on a horse. The doorman asked him, and Cao said: 'I have urgent business affairs', so I drove off on horseback."" Confucianism said: ""Cao thief has a guilty conscience If you flee, there is no doubt that you will be assassinated."" Zhuo was furious and said, ""I am so important, and I want to harm me!"" Confucianism said: ""There must be accomplices in this, and we will know when Cao Cao is captured."" Zhuo Sui ordered all the documents and paintings Shadow graphics, capture Cao Cao. Those who donate are captured, they are rewarded with a thousand pieces of gold, and they are sealed as marquis of ten thousand households; those who hide are guilty of the same.","Asked why he is so late, Cao Cao replies that his horse is unfit for travel, whereupon Dong Zhuo orders Lü Bu – his golden recruit from Ding Yuan’s army, and the new owner of Red Hare – to go and find him a fine new one. Now that he is left alone with Dong Zhuo, Cao Cao draws his dagger and moves towards him. But Dong Zhuo catches sight of him in a mirror and turns. ‘What are you doing?’ he calls out. In terror, Cao Cao drops to his knees. Thinking quickly, he offers up the beautiful dagger with both hands. ‘This is a present for your honour,’ he mutters. Dong Zhuo appears delighted with such a gift. At just this moment Lü Bu returns, having found a horse. Dong Zhuo and Cao Cao go outside to view the horse. Expressing huge gratitude, Cao Cao asks if he might try the gift horse out. As soon as the saddle and reins have been put on, Cao Cao springs upon its back and without a backward glance rides at full tilt out of the palace gate. Watching him go, Lü Bu and Dong Zhuo find that they agree. They both suspect that, rather than wanting to present the dagger as a gift, Cao Cao meant to murder Dong Zhuo. Summoning Li Ru, they discuss what to do and decide to send soldiers to track him down. The soldiers don’t find him, but guards at the eastern gate report that he fled the city at a mad gallop, claiming he was on a special mission for Dong Zhuo. Realizing he has narrowly avoided an assassination plot, Dong Zhuo is incandescent with rage. A huge reward is offered for the capture of Cao Cao, and his portrait is circulated far and wide.","The next day Cao Cao, with this short sword girded on, came to the palace of the Prime Minister. “Where is the Prime Minister?” asked he. “In the small guest room,” replied the attendants. So Cao Cao went in and found his host seated on a couch; Lu Bu was at his side. “Why so late, Cao Cao?” said Dong Zhuo. “My horse is out of condition and slow,” replied Cao Cao. Dong Zhuo turned to his henchman Lu Bu. “Some good horses have come in from the west. You go and pick out a good one as a present for him.” And Lu Bu left. “This traitor is doomed,” thought Cao Cao. He ought to have struck then, but Cao Cao knew Dong Zhuo was very powerful, and he was afraid to act; he wanted to make sure of his blow. Now Dong Zhuo's corpulence was such that he could not remain long sitting, so he rolled over couch and lay face inwards. “Now is the time,” thought the assassin, and he gripped the good sword firmly. But just as Cao Cao was going to strike, Dong Zhuo happened to look up and in a mirror he saw the reflection of Cao Cao behind him with a sword in the hand. “What are you doing, Cao Cao?” said Dong Zhuo turning suddenly. And at that moment Lu Bu came along leading a horse. Cao Cao in a flurry dropped on his knees and said, “I have a precious sword here which I wish to present to Your Benevolence.” Dong Zhuo took it. It was a fine blade, over a foot in length, inlaid with the seven precious signs and very keen—a fine sword in very truth. Dong Zhuo handed the weapon to Lu Bu while Cao Cao took off the sheath which he also gave to Lu Bu. Then they went out to look at the horse. Cao Cao was profuse in his thanks and said he would like to try the horse. So Dong Zhuo bade the guards bring saddle and bridle. Cao Cao led the creature outside, leapt into the saddle, laid on his whip vigorously, and galloped away eastward. Lu Bu said, “Just as I was coming up, it seemed to me as if that fellow was going to stab you, only a sudden panic seized him and he presented the weapon instead.” “I suspected him too,” said Dong Zhuo. Just then Li Ru came in and they told him. “Cao Cao has no family here in the capital but lodges quite alone and not far away,” said Li Ru. “Send for him. If he comes forthwith, the sword was meant as a gift; but if he makes any excuses, he had bad intentions. And you can arrest him.” They sent four prison warders to call Cao Cao. They were absent a long time and then came back, saying, “Cao Cao had not returned to his lodging but rode in hot haste out of the eastern gate. To the gate commander's questions he replied that he was on a special message for the Prime Minister. He went off at full speed.” “His conscience pricked him and so he fled; there is no doubt that he meant assassination,” said Li Ru. “And I trusted him so well!” said Dong Zhuo in a rage. “There must be a conspiracy afoot. When we catch him, we shall know all about it,” said Li Ru. Letters and pictures of the fugitive Cao Cao were sent everywhere with orders to catch him. A large reward in money was offered and a patent of nobility, while those who sheltered him would be held to share his guilt."

三人回至新野，過了數日，玄德使人探聽孔明。回報曰：“臥龍先生已回矣。”玄德便敎備馬。張飛曰：“量一村夫，何必哥哥自去，可使人喚來便了。”玄德叱曰：“汝豈不聞孟子云：‘欲見賢而不以其道，猶欲其入而閉之門也。’孔明當世大賢，豈可召乎！”遂上馬再往訪孔明。關、張亦乘馬相隨。時值隆冬，天氣嚴寒，彤雲密布。行無數里，忽然朔風凜凜，瑞雪霏霏；山如玉簇，林似銀妝。張飛曰：“天寒地凍，尚不用兵，豈宜遠見無益之人乎！不如回新野以避風雪。”玄德曰：“吾正欲使孔明知我慇懃之意。如弟輩怕冷，可先回去。”飛曰：“死且不怕，豈怕冷乎！但恐哥哥空勞神思。”玄德曰：“勿多言，只相隨同去。”將近茅廬，忽聞路傍酒店中有人作歌。玄德立馬聽之。其歌曰：,"The three returned to Xinye, and after a few days, Xuande sent people to spy on Kong Ming. The report said: ""Mr. Wolong has returned."" Xuande then ordered the horse. Zhang Fei said, ""When you measure a villager, why should your elder brother go by himself, so that someone can call him."" Xuande said, ""Have you not heard Mencius' saying: 'If you want to see the wise and not follow the Tao, you still want to enter it. And the door is closed. 'Kong Ming is a great sage in the world, how can he be summoned!"" Then he mounted his horse and went to visit Kong Ming again. Guan and Zhang also followed on horseback. It was midwinter, the weather was cold, and the clouds were dense. After traveling for countless miles, suddenly the wind was bleak, Ruixue Feifei; the mountains were like jade clusters, and the forests were like silver makeup. Zhang Fei said: ""The sky is cold and the ground is freezing, and there is no need for soldiers yet. How could it be better to see people who are useless! It's better to return to Xinye to avoid the wind and snow."" Xuande said: ""I want to make Kong Ming know that I am diligent. , you can go back first."" Fei said: ""If you are not afraid of death, why are you afraid of being cold! But I am afraid that my brother will be exhausted."" Xuande said: ""Don't talk too much, just go with you."" Some of them sing. Xuande immediately listened to it. Its song says:","Humbled, Xuande says, ‘Then just say to the master that Xuande came calling.’","Some days after the return to Xinye, Liu Bei sent to find out whether Zhuge Liang had returned, and the messenger came back saying that he had. Wherefore Liu Bei prepared for another visit. Again Zhang Fei showed his irritation by remarking, “Why must you go hunting after this villager? Send and tell him to come.” “Silence!” said Liu Bei, “The Teacher Mencius said, 'To try to see the sage without going his way is like barring a door you wish to enter.' Zhuge Liang is the greatest sage of the day; how can I summon him?” So Liu Bei rode away to make his visit, his two brothers with him as before. It was winter and exceedingly cold; floating clouds covered the whole sky. Before they had gone far, a bitter wind began to blow in their faces, and the snow began to fly. Soon the mountains were of jade and the trees of silver. “It is very cold and the earth is frozen hard, no fighting is possible now.” Said Zhang Fei. “Yet we are going all this way to get advice which will be useless to us. Where is the sense of it? Let us rather get back to Xinye out of the cold.” Liu Bei replied, “I am set upon proving my zeal to Zhuge Liang, but if you, my brother, do not like the cold, you can return.” “I do not fear death; do you think I care for the cold? But I do care about wasting my brother's energies,” said Zhang Fei. “Say no more,” said Liu Bei, and they traveled on. When they drew near the little wood, they heard singing in a roadside inn and stopped to listen. This was the song:"
庾公之斯追子濯孺子之事——春秋時，衞國派庾公之斯追擊子濯孺子，他們都很會射箭，但子濯孺子因為生病，不能拿弓應戰。庾公之斯對他說：“我跟尹公之他學射箭，尹公之他跟您學射箭，我不忍用您的技術反轉來害您。”於是把箭頭敲掉，射了四枝沒有箭頭的箭回去了。,"Yu Gongzhi’s pursuit of his son Zhuoruzi—In the Spring and Autumn Period, Wei Guo sent Yu Gongzhisi to chase Zizhuoruzi. They were all good at archery, but Zizhuoruzi was ill and could not take a bow to fight. Yu Gongzhi said to him: ""I learned archery from Yin Gongzhi, and Yin Gongzhi learned archery from you. I can't bear to use your reverse technique to harm you."" So he knocked off the arrow and shot four arrows without arrows and went back .","You signed this agreement, and we’ll now have to enforce it.’ And so saying, he calls for the guards to come and execute Guan Yu! Guan Yu has risked his life to honour kindness. This is why his name is spoken with pride to this day. Cao Cao has escaped with his life. Can Guan Yu?","Zhuge Liang called in the lictors and told them to take away Guan Yu and put him to death. Guan Yu risked life when he spared Cao Cao in direst need, And age-long admiration gained For kindly deed. What actually befell will he seen in the next chapter."
程普、黃蓋、韓當都來尋見孫堅，再收拾軍馬屯紮。堅為折了祖茂，傷感不已，星夜遣人報知袁紹。紹大驚曰：“不想孫文臺敗於華雄之手！”便聚衆諸侯商議。衆人都到，只有公孫瓚後至，紹請入帳列坐。紹曰：“前日鮑將軍之弟不遵調遣，擅自進兵，殺身喪命，折了許多軍士。今者孫文臺又敗於華雄：挫動銳氣，為之奈何？”諸侯並皆不語。紹舉目遍視，見公孫瓚背後立着三人，容貌異常，都在那裏冷笑。紹問曰：“公孫太守背後何人？”瓚呼玄德出曰：“此吾自幼同舍兄弟，平原令劉備是也。”曹操曰：“莫非破黃巾劉玄德乎？”瓚曰：“然。”卽令劉玄德拜見。瓚將玄德功勞，並其出身，細說一遍。紹曰：“旣是漢室宗派，取坐來。”命坐。備遜謝。紹曰：“吾非敬汝名爵，吾敬汝是帝室之胄耳。”玄德乃坐於末位，關、張叉手侍立於後。,"Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, and Han Dang all came to find Sun Jian, and then packed up the army. Jian felt very sad for the loss of Zu Mao, and Xingye sent someone to report to Yuan Shao. Shao was shocked and said, ""I don't want Sun Wentai to be defeated by Hua Xiong!"" He gathered the princes to discuss. Everyone arrived, only Gongsun Zan came later, and Shao invited him to sit in the tent. Shao said: ""The day before yesterday, General Bao's younger brother did not comply with the dispatch, and entered the army without authorization, killing his life and destroying many soldiers. Today, Sun Wentai has been defeated by Huaxiong: set back his spirit, what can he do?"" The princes did not say anything. Shao looked around and saw three people standing behind Gongsun Zan, with unusual appearances, and they all sneered there. Shao asked, ""Who is behind the prefect of Gongsun?"" Zan called Xuande out and said, ""This is my brother since I was a child, and Pingyuan ordered Liu Bei."" Cao Cao said, ""Could it be that Liu Xuande broke the yellow turban?"" Zan said, ""Of course ."" He ordered Liu Xuande to meet him. Zan Jiang's contribution to Xuande, and his origin, will be explained in detail. Shao said: ""Jian is a sect of the Han family, take a seat."" He ordered to sit. Thank you. Shao said, ""I don't respect your name, but I respect you as the head of the imperial family."" Xuande was seated at the bottom, with Guan and Zhang Cha in the back.","Having tricked them into believing the cloak is being worn by Sun Jian, he attacks them when they least expect it but is brought down by a single blow from Hua Xiong. The slaughtering of Sun Jian’s defeated infantry goes on until daybreak, and Sun Jian and his surviving foot soldiers straggle back to the main camp of the rebels. Here a council of war is being held by a deeply distressed Yuan Shao, who proclaims that the army’s morale has been severely diminished by the disastrous campaign. ‘What should we do next?’ he asks. This is met by a guilty silence. It is at this point that he sees three odd-looking characters grinning at the back of the room. When he asks who they are, he is informed that the senior one is Xuande, who destroyed the Yellow Headband revolt, and that he is also a descendant of the imperial family. He invites Xuande to join the war council, and his two brothers-in-arms take up protective positions behind him.","Cheng Pu, Huang Gai, and Han Dang in time found their chief and the soldiers gathered. Sun Jian was much grieved at the loss of Zu Mao. When news of the disaster reached Yuan Shao, he was greatly chagrined and called all the lords to a council. They assembled and Gongsun Zan was the last to arrive. When all were seated in the tent Yuan Shao said, “The brother of General Bao Xin, disobeying the rules we made for our guidance, rashly went to attack the enemy; he was slain and with him many of our soldiers. Now Sun Jian has been defeated. Thus our fighting spirit has suffered and what is to be done?” Every one was silent. Lifting his eyes, Yuan Shao looked round from one to another till he came to Gongsun Zan, and then he remarked three men who stood behind Gongsun Zan's seat. They were of striking appearance as they stood there, all three smiling cynically. “Who are those men behind you?” said Yuan Shao. Gongsun Zan told Liu Bei to come forward, and said, “This is Liu Bei, Magistrate of Pingyuan and a brother of mine who shared my humble cottage when we were students.” “It must be the Liu Bei who broke up the Yellow Scarves rebellion,” said Cao Cao. “It is he,” said Gongsun Zan, and he ordered Liu Bei to make his obeisance to the assembly, to whom Liu Bei then related his services and his origin, all in full detail. “Since he is of the Han line, he should be seated,” said Yuan Shao, and he bade Liu Bei sit. Liu Bei modestly thanked him, declining. Said Yuan Shao, “This consideration is not for your fame and office; I respect you as a scion of the imperial family.” So Liu Bei took his seat in the lowest place of the long line of lords. And his two brothers with folded arms took their stations behind him."
袁譚引兵出城，與曹軍相敵。兩陣對圓，操出馬以鞭指譚而罵曰：“吾厚待汝，汝何生異心？”譚曰：“汝犯吾境界，奪吾城池，賴吾妻子，反說我有異心耶？”操大怒，使徐晃出馬。譚使彭安接戰。兩馬相交，不數合，晃斬彭安於馬下。譚軍敗走，退入南皮。操遣軍四面圍住。譚着慌，使辛評見操約降。操曰：“袁譚小子，反覆無常，吾難准信。汝弟辛毗，吾已重用，汝亦留此可也。”評曰：“丞相差矣：某聞主貴臣榮，主憂臣辱。某久事袁氏，豈可背之！”操知其不可留，乃遣回。評回見譚，言操不准投降。譚叱曰：“汝弟見事曹操，汝懷二心耶？”評聞言，氣滿填胸，昏絕於地。譚令扶出，須臾而死。譚亦悔之。郭圖謂譚曰：“來日盡驅百姓當先，以軍繼其後，與曹操決一死戰。”譚從其言。當夜盡驅南皮百姓，皆執刀鎗聽令。次日平明，大開四門，軍在後，驅百姓在前，喊聲大舉，一齊擁出，直抵曹寨。兩軍混戰，自辰至午，勝負未分，殺人遍地。操見未獲全勝，棄馬上山，親自擊鼓。將士見之，奮力向前，譚軍大敗。百姓被殺者無數。曹洪奮威突陣，正迎袁譚，舉刀亂砍，譚竟被曹洪殺於陣中。郭圖見陣大亂，急馳入城中。樂進望見，拈弓搭箭，射下城壕，人馬俱陷。操引兵入南皮，安撫百姓。忽有一彪軍來到，乃袁熙部將焦觸、張南也。操自引軍迎之。二將倒戈卸甲，特來投降。操封為列侯。又黑山賊張燕，引軍十萬來降，操封為平北將軍。,"Yuan Tan led troops out of the city to fight against Cao's army. The two formations were facing each other, and they pulled out their horses and pointed at Tan with the whip, saying, ""I treat you kindly, why do you have any dissent?"" Tan said, ""You violated my realm, seized my city, and blamed my wife, and said I had dissent? ""Cao was furious, causing Xu Huang to go out. Tan sent Peng An to fight. The two horses crossed each other, and they never joined, and they slashed Peng An under the horse. Tan Jun was defeated and retreated to Nanpi. The troops were surrounded on all sides. Tan was in a panic, so Xin Ping saw that Cao was about to drop. Cao said: ""Little Yuan Tan, it's fickle, it's hard for me to believe it. Your brother Xin Pi, I've already used it, so you can keep it."" I have been with the Yuan family for a long time, how can I carry it back!"" Cao knew that he could not stay, so he sent him back. Commenting back to see Tan, words and actions are not allowed to surrender. Tan Huo said: ""Your brother sees Cao Cao, do you have two hearts?"" When the commentary heard this, he was so full of anger that he fell to the ground. Tan Ling helped him out and died in an instant. Tan also regrets it. Guo Tu said to Tan: ""In the future, all the people will be driven first, followed by the army, and we will fight Cao Cao to the death."" Tan Congqi said. That night, the people of Nanpi were driven out, and they all obeyed the orders with swords and guns. The next day, at Ping Ming, the four gates were opened, the army was behind, and the people were in the front, shouting loudly, and they all rushed out to Cao Zhai. The two armies fought meleely, from Chen to Noon, with no winner or loser, killing people everywhere. Cao saw that he had not won a complete victory, so he abandoned his horse and beat the drums himself. Seeing this, the soldiers fought hard to move forward, and the Tan army was defeated. Countless people were killed. Cao Hong rushed to the formation, was welcoming Yuan Tan, raised his sword and slashed, Tan was killed by Cao Hong in the formation. Guo Tu saw the chaos and rushed into the city. When Yue Jin saw it, he took a bow and an arrow, and shot down the moat, all the men and horses were trapped. Cao led troops into Nanpi to appease the people. Suddenly a Biao army came, and it was Yuan Xi's generals Jiao Touch and Zhang Nanye. Cao led the army to welcome him. The second general turned to surrender and surrendered. Cao was named Liehou. Zhang Yan, a thief from the Black Mountains, led an army of 100,000 troops to surrender, and Cao was named General of Pingbei.",Yuan Tan has rallied his brother’s men and is preparing for war against Cao Cao.,"Then Yuan Tan led out his army against Cao Cao. When both sides were arrayed, Cao Cao rode to the front, pointed with his whip at his opponent and railed at him, saying, “I treated you well; why then have you turned against me?” Yuan Tan replied, “You have invaded my land, captured my cities, and broken off my marriage; yet you accuse me of turning against you.” Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang to go out and give battle. Yuan Tan bade Peng An accept the challenge. After a few bouts Peng An was slain; and Yuan Tan, having lost, fled and went into Nanpi, where he was besieged. Yuan Tan, panic-stricken, sent Xin Ping to see Cao Cao and arrange surrender. “He is nothing but a tickle-minded child,” said Cao Cao. “He is never of the same mind two days running, and I cannot depend upon what he says. Now your brother Xin Pi is in my employ and has a post of importance, you would better remain here also.” “Sir Prime Minister, you are in error,” said Xin Ping. “It is said that the lord's honor is the servant's glory; the lord's sadness is the servant's shame. How can I turn my back on the family I have so long served?” Cao Cao felt he could not be persuaded and sent him back. Xin Ping returned and told Yuan Tan the surrender could not be arranged, and Yuan Tan turned on him angrily, saying, “Your brother is with Cao Cao, and you want to betray me also!” At this unmerited reproach such a huge wave of anger welled up in Xin Ping's breast that he was overcome and fell in a swoon. They carried him out, but the shock had been too severe, and soon after he died. Yuan Tan regretted his conduct when it was too late. Then Guo Tu said, “Tomorrow when we go out to battle, we will drive the people out in front as a screen for the soldiers, and we must fight a winning battle.” That night they assembled all the common people of the place and forced into their hands swords and spears. At daylight they opened the four gates, and a huge party with much shouting came out at each, peasantry carrying arms in front, and soldiers behind them. They pushed on toward Cao Cao's camps, and a melee began lasted till near midday. But this was quite indecisive, although heaps of dead lay everywhere. Seeing that success was at best only partial, Cao Cao rode out to the hills near and thence had the drums beaten for a new attack under his own eye. His officers and troops, seeing that he could observe them in person, exerted themselves to the utmost, and Yuan Tan's army was severely defeated. Of the peasantry driven into the battle-field multitudes were slain. Cao Hong, who displayed very great valor, burst into the press of battle and met Yuan Tan face to face. The two slashed and hammered at each other and Yuan Tan was killed. Guo Tu saw that his side was wholly disorganized and tried to withdraw into the shelter of Nanpi. Yue Jin saw this and opened a tremendous discharge of arrows so that Guo Tu fell and the moat was soon filled with dead. The city fell to Cao Cao; he entered and set about restoring peace and order. Then suddenly appeared a new army under two of Yuan Xi's generals, Jiao Chu and Zhang Nan. Cao Cao led out his troops to meet them, but the two commanders laid down their arms and yielded.

却說袁紹兵敗而奔，沮授因被囚禁，急走不脫，為曹軍所獲，擒見曹操。操素與授相識。授見操，大呼曰：“授不降也！”操曰：“本初無謀，不用君言，君何尚執迷耶？吾若早得足下，天下不足慮也。”因厚待之，留於軍中。授乃於營中盜馬，欲歸袁氏。操怒，乃殺之。授至死神色不變。操歎曰：“吾誤殺忠義之士也！”命厚禮殯殮，為建墳安葬於黃河渡口，題其墓曰：“忠烈沮君之墓”。後人有詩贊曰：,"But they said that Yuan Shao's army was defeated and ran away, and Ju Shou was imprisoned and could not escape.

Why are you still obsessed? stay in the army. Grant was stealing horses from the camp and wanted to return to the Yuan clan. Get angry and kill him. Granted to death the same expression. Cao sighed and said, ""I killed a loyal and righteous man by mistake!"" He ordered a burial with a generous gift to build a tomb for burial at the ferry crossing of the Yellow River. A later poem praised:","Spreading rumours of where they might launch their assault, they make Yuan Shao divide his army and scatter his forces widely in preparation for the supposed attacks. Then Cao Cao drives straight at the main camp. Yuan Shao’s men panic and flee. Yuan Shao doesn’t even have enough time to put on his armour. Leaping on his horse and abandoning everything, he escapes with his youngest son, Yuan Shang. It is said that upwards of eighty thousand of his men are killed that day. The soil turns red with the blood. Untold numbers drown.

Urged by some to kill them all, he says, ‘No.","Now when Yuan Shao's soldiers ran away, Ju Shou, being a prisoner, could not get away and was captured. Taken before Cao Cao, who knew him, Ju Shou cried aloud, “I will not surrender!” Said Cao Cao, “Yuan Shao was foolish and neglected your advice; why still cling to the path of delusion? Had I had you to help me , I should have been sure of the empire.” Ju Shou was well treated in the camp, but he stole a horse and tried to get away to Yuan Shao. This angered Cao Cao who recaptured him and put him to death, which he met with brave composure. “I have slain a faithful and righteous man,” then said Cao Cao sadly.

一日，關、張不在，玄德正在後園澆菜，許褚、張遼引數十人入園中曰：“丞相有命，請使君便行。”玄德驚問曰：“有甚緊事？”許褚曰：“不知。只敎我來相請。”玄德只得隨二人入府見操。操笑曰：“在家做得好大事！”諕得玄德面如土色。操執玄德手，直至後園曰：“玄德學圃不易。”玄德方纔放心，答曰：“無事消遣耳。”操曰：“適見枝頭梅子靑靑，忽感去年征張繡時，道上缺水，將士皆渴。吾心生一計，以鞭虛指曰：‘前面有梅林。’軍士聞之，口皆生唾，由是不渴。今見此梅，不可不賞。又值煮酒正熟，故邀使君小亭一會。”玄德心神方定。隨至小亭，已設樽俎：盤置靑梅，一樽煮酒。二人對坐，開懷暢飲。,"One day, when Guan and Zhang were not there, Xuande was pouring vegetables in the back garden. Xu Chu and Zhang Liao led dozens of people into the garden and said, ""The prime minister has an order, please entrust your lord to do it."" Xuande asked in surprise, ""Is there any urgent matter? ?"" Xu Chu said, ""I don't know. Just send me here to invite you."" Xuande had to accompany the two into the manor to see him. Cao laughed and said, ""You have done a great job at home!"" Xuande's face turned pale. He held Xuande's hand until the back garden said: ""Xuande's school is not easy."" Xuande was relieved and replied, ""There is nothing to do."" Cao said: ""It is good to see the plum blossoms on the branches, and I suddenly feel that last year when Zhang embroidery was recruited. , There is no water on the road, and the soldiers are thirsty. I have a plan in my heart, and I use the whip to say: 'There is a plum forest in front.' The wine is being cooked, so I invited the envoy to Xiaoting for a while."" Xuande's mind was fixed. After arriving at the small pavilion, a bottle has been set up: a plate of plums and a bottle of wine to cook. The two sat opposite each other and drank happily.","‘Not a lot,’ confesses Xuande.","One day when the two brothers were absent, and Liu Bei was busy in his garden, two generals of Cao Cao, Xu Chu and Zhang Liao, with an escort came from Cao Cao, saying, “The command of the Prime Minister is that you come at once.” “What important affair is afoot?” asked Liu Bei nervously. “We know nothing; we were ordered to come and request your presence.” All he could do was to follow. When he arrived, Cao Cao met him and laughingly said, “That is a big business you have in hand at home.” This remark made Liu Bei turn the color of clay. Cao Cao took him by the hand and led him straight to the private garden, saying, “The growth of vegetables that you are trying to learn is very difficult.” Liu Bei breathed again. He said, “That is hardly a business; it is only a solace.” Cao Cao said, “I happened to notice the green plums on the trees today, and suddenly my thoughts went back to a year ago when we were thrashing Zhang Xiu. We were marching through a parched county, and every one was suffering from thirst. Suddenly I lifted my whip, and pointing at something in the distance I said, 'Look at those fruitful plum trees in the forest ahead.' The soldiers heard it, and it made their mouths water. Seeing the plums kindles my appreciation. I owe something to the plums, and we will repay it today. I ordered the servants to heat some wine very hot and sent to invite you to share it.” Liu Bei was quite composed by this time and no longer suspected any sinister design. He went with his host to a small spring pavilion in a plum garden, where the wine cups were already laid out and green plums filled the dishes. They sat down to a confidential talk and free enjoyment of their wine."

Sun Quan burst into tears when he saw that Song Qian was broken. Chang Shi Zhang Hong said: ""The lord is strong and strong, and he despises the enemy and the three armies, all of whom are cold-hearted. The envoy slashes the generals and holds the flag, and strengthens the battlefield. It is also not for the lord. , Yu Zhiyong, embrace the king's hegemony plan. And today Song Qian died under the sharp edge, because the lord underestimated the enemy. In the future, you should take care of it."" Quan said: ""This is a lonely fault. It should be changed from now on. After a while, Taishi Ci entered the tent and said: ""There is a man under a certain person: surnamed Ge, given name, and Zhang Liao's subordinate Houcao, who raises a horse, is a brother. Houcao was blamed and held grudges, and people will be reported tonight to raise fire as a number. , to assassinate Zhang Liao in return for Song Qian's death. A certain invites troops to respond."" Quan said, ""Where is Ge Ding?"" Taishi Ci said, ""It has been mixed into Hefei City. A certain wishes to beg 5,000 soldiers."" Zhuge Jin said: ""Zhang Liao is very resourceful, he may be prepared, and he must not make a second attempt."" Taishi Cijian insisted on doing it. Quan was saddened by Song Qian's death and was anxious to report it, so he ordered Taishi Ci to lead 5,000 troops to respond.","Satisfied with his defence of Hefei, Zhang Liao returns to the city while Sun Quan retreats and watches as the remnants of his defeated army struggle back. His officers remonstrate with him and make him promise not to be so rash again. Not long after, Taishi Ci comes to see Sun Quan with news. A groom called Ge Ding has a blood brother in Zhang Liao’s army who hates Zhang Liao because he feels he has been unjustly punished for some offence. He is willing to kill Zhang Liao and will signal that night when he has killed him so that Sun Quan’s men can then swarm into the city and take it. Delighted with this, Sun Quan agrees that Taishi should have five thousand men to go with him.","Sun Quan was escorted back to his main camp, where his beaten soldiers gradually rejoined him and their ranks were reformed. When Sun Quan knew of the death of Song Qian, he was greatly pained and wept aloud. But Zhang Hong, the adviser, reproached him, saying, “My lord, you relied too much upon your martial prowess and lightly engaged in battle with a formidable enemy. Every person in the army was chilled with fear, and you lost a general and some of your banners. It is not for you to exhibit prowess on the actual battlefield and encroach upon the duties of a general. Rather curb and repress such physical feats as those ancient Xia Yu and Meng Ben, and contemplate schemes of exercising princely virtues with the hegemony of all the feudal states. It is because of your ill-regulated action in engaging in battle that Song Qian perished at the hands of your enemies. Hereafter you should regard as most important your personal safety.” “Yes; it is indeed a fault,” said Sun Quan. “I will reform.” Soon after, Taishi Ci entered the tent and said, “In my command there is a certain Ge Ding, brother of a groom in the army of Zhang Liao. This servant is deeply resentful on account of a punishment inflicted upon him and is anxious to be revenged. He has sent over to say that he will show a signal tonight when he has assassinated Zhang Liao in revenge for the death of your late leader Song Qian. I wish to take some troops over to await this signal to attack.” “Where is Ge Ding?” asked Sun Quan. “Ge Ding has mingled with the enemy and gone into the city. Let me have five thousand soldiers.” Zhuge Jin said, “Zhang Liao is full of guile; I think you will find him prepared for your coming. Be careful.” As Taishi Ci urged his chief to let him go, and Sun Quan was deeply hurt by the death of his leader, the permission was given and the force started."

Chou burst into tears and said, ""Someone who escaped righteously has received a lot of grace and lives, and he is very fortunate; how can he sell Lulong's fortress as an invitation to reward him! I dare not accept the marquis in death."" For the speaker. He comforted Shan Yuren and others, and he gathered 10,000 horses. He returned to the army every day. When the weather was cold and dry, there was no water for 200 miles, and the army was short of food. He killed horses for food. Cao returned to Yizhou and rewarded those who had previously advised him; because of this, the generals said: ""The former alone took a dangerous expedition and succeeded by luck. Even if he wins, it is also protected by God, and it cannot be used for the law. To reward each other. Don't be hard to say later."" When Cao arrived in Yizhou, Guo Jia had been dead for a few days, and he stopped in his coffin. When Cao went to worship him, he cried aloud: ""To die for filial piety, it is God's death!"" Looking back at the officials, he said, ""All the monarchs are of the same age, but they are the least filial. My untimely death has broken my heart!"" Jia Zhi left and right, and presented the letter that Jia had sealed when he died, saying: ""Guo Gong was about to die, and he wrote this in his own hand, saying: 'If the prime minister follows the words in the book, things will be settled in Liaodong.' ""Cao opened the book and looked at it, nodded and sighed. Everyone didn't know what it meant. The next day, Xiahou Dun led the crowd to report: ""Liaodong Governor Gongsun Kang, I haven't served him for a long time. Now Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang are going to cast him again, and it will be a trouble later. It's better to take advantage of the fact that he hasn't moved and go to Liaodong as soon as possible."" Cao laughed and said, ""Don't bother the public tigers: After a few days, Gongsun Kang will send the heads of the two Yuan to him."" All the generals refused to believe it.","But he is cut down by one of Cao Cao’s cousins, Cao Hong, while Guo Tu is also spotted and killed. After the fall of the city, Cao Cao has Yuan Tan’s head cut off and exposed. He gives orders that no one should mourn his death. However, one man does. When he is arrested and questioned he says he served under Yuan Tan when he was in charge of Qingzhou. He left Yuan Tan’s service because he told him publicly that he disapproved of the way he ran things. But he still feels that he should pay his respects. Cao Cao has ordered that anyone disobeying his order not to mourn should be executed. But moved by the true sense of loyalty and honour that this man shows, he pardons him and even gives him a post in his new administration. With Yuan Tan dead and buried, it is not long before the other brothers, Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi, are tracked down.","Cao Cao then led his army into Liucheng. For his services, Tian Chou was conferred the rank of Lord of Liucheng and Commander of that county. But Tian Chou declined the rank, saying with tears, “I am a renegade and a fugitive. It is my good fortune that you spared my life and how can I accept a rank for betraying Lulong? I would rather die than accept the lordship.” Cao Cao recognized that reason was on Tian Chou's side and conferred upon him the office of Court Counselor. Cao Cao then pacified the Xiongnu Chieftains; collected a large number of horses and at once set out on the homeward march. The season was winter, cold and dry. For seventy miles there was no water, and grain also was scanty. The troops fed on horse flesh. They had to dig very deep, three or four hundred spans to find water. When Cao Cao reached Yizhou, he rewarded those who had remonstrated with him against the expedition. He said, “I took some risk in going so far, but by good fortune I have succeeded; with the aid of Heaven I have secured victory. I could not be guided by your advice, but still they were counsels of safety, and therefore I reward you to prove my appreciation of advice and that hereafter you may not fear to speak your minds.” Adviser Guo Jia did not live to see the return of his lord. His coffin was placed on the bier in a hall of the government offices, and Cao Cao went thither to sacrifice to his manes. Cao Cao mourned for him, crying, “Alas! Heaven has smitten me; Guo Jia is dead.” Then turning to his officers he said, “You, gentlemen, are of the same age as myself, but he was very young to die. I needed him for the future generation, and unhappily he has been torn from me in the flower of his age. My heart and my bowels are torn with grief.” The servants of the late adviser presented his last testament, which they said his dying hand had written, and he had told them to say, “If the Prime Minister shall follow the advice given herein, then Liaodong will be secure.” Cao Cao opened the cover and read, nodding his head in agreement and uttering deep sighs. But no other person knew what was written therein. Shortly after, Xiahou Dun at the head of a delegation presented a petition, saying, “For a long time the Governor of Liaodong, Gongsun Kang, has been contumacious, and it bodes ill for peace that the Yuan brothers have fled to him. Would it not be well to attack before they move against you?” “I need not trouble your tiger courage, Sirs,” said Cao Cao smiling. “Wait a few days and you will see the heads of our two enemies sent to me.” They could not believe it."

Bu Nai sent Gao Shun, Wei Xu and Hou Cheng to lead troops to defend Xizhai.","Then Cao Cao leads a night attack on Lü Bu’s camp. While at first this night attack is successful, it is driven off by a concerted defence by all Lü Bu’s generals.

The advisors Zhe Rong and Xue Li persuaded him to avoid him, so they stationed troops in Lingling City to resist the enemy. Yaozi led his troops to camp in the south of Shentingling, and Sun Ce went to camp in the north of Ling. Ce asked the natives, ""Is there a temple of Han Guangwu near the mountain?"" The natives said, ""There is a temple on the mountain."" Ce said, ""My night dream of Guangwu invited me to see you, and I should go to pray for him."" Zhang Zhao, the chief historian, said: "" No: Lingnan is the village of Liu Yao, if there are soldiers in ambush, what should I do?"" Ce said, ""Gods protect me, why should I be afraid?"" A total of thirteen horsemen, including Zhou Tai, went out of the village and went up the mountain to burn incense at the temple. After dismounting from the horse to visit the shrine, Ce knelt forward and said, ""If Sun Ce can establish a business in the east of the Yangtze River and restore the foundation of his old father, then he should rebuild the temple and make sacrifices at the four seasons."" If I want to cross the mountain, I will visit Liu Yaozhai Gate."" All the generals thought it was impossible. Unable to follow the policy, I followed Shangling and looked at the village forest in the south. A small army from Fulu had already reported to Liu Yao. Yao said, ""This must be Sun Ce's trick to lure the enemy, and we must not pursue it."" Taishi Ci jumped up and said, ""If we don't arrest Sun Ce at this time, when will we wait?"" So instead of waiting for Liu Yao's command, he put on his horse and fired his spear. The camp shouted, ""Whoever has the courage, come with me!"" The generals did not move. Only a small general said: ""Tai Shi Cizhen is also a fierce general! I can help him!"" All the generals laughed.","Sun Ce is able to advance and to directly confront Liu Yao and his main army. That night Sun Ce has a dream. In the dream he hears the founder of the Later Han summoning him to a temple dedicated to his memory. When morning comes he asks his advisers where this temple might be. When he is told it is to the south, close to where Liu Yao is encamped, they advise him not to go there. But he is insistent, saying, ‘I want to pray to him, and the gods will protect me. Why should I be afraid?’ So saying, and taking just twelve guards, he rides to the temple and prays for success. As his men feared, he is spotted by the enemy. However, Liu Yao is convinced that this sudden exposure of his enemy so close by must be a trap. ‘ He is trying to get us to come out into the open and then will ambush us.’ But Taishi Ci, the great warrior, is dying for a fight. Ignoring Liu Yao’s pleas to stop, and with only one other, rather minor commander joining him, Taishi Ci rides out to fight Sun Ce.","After his defeat Zhang Ying returned to his master and told his misfortune. Liu Yao was going to punish his failure by death, but listened to his advisers, who asked for mercy for the unfortunate man, and sent him to command the garrison in Lingling. Liu Yao himself set out to meet the invaders. He camped south of the Sacred Hills. Sun Ce camped on the opposite side of the hills. Sun Ce inquired the natives, “Is there a temple of Liu Xiu the Founder of Latter Hans in the vicinity?” They said, “There is a temple to the south on the summit of the hills.” “I dreamed last night that Liu Xiu called me, so I will go and pray there,” said Sun Ce. But Counselor Zhang Zhao advised, “My lord, you should not go as the enemy is on the other side, and you may fall into an ambush.” “The spirit will help me; what need I fear?” So Sun Ce put on his armor, took his spear and mounted, taking with him twelve of his commanders as an escort. They rode up the hills, dismounted, burned incense, and they all bowed in the shrine. Then Sun Ce knelt and made a vow, saying, “If I, Sun Ce, succeed in my task and restore the authority of my late father, then will I restore this temple and order sacrifices at the four seasons.” When they had remounted, Sun Ce said, “I am going to ride along the ridge and reconnoiter the enemy's position.” His commanders begged him to refrain, but he was obstinate, and they rode there together, noting the villages below. A soldier of the other side going along a bye road quickly reported the presence of horsemen on the ridge, and Liu Yao said, “It is certainly Sun Ce trying to inveigle us to battle. But do not go out.” Taishi Ci jumped up, saying, “What better chance to capture him?” So, without orders he armed himself and rode through the camp, crying, “If there be any valiant people among you, follow me!” No one moved save a subaltern who said, “He is a valiant man and I will go with him.” So he also went. The others only laughed at the pair."

How can we make father, son and brothers fight against each other again? Lord, please consider the strategy of rejecting the enemy, and the matter of establishing an heir will not be tolerated."" Yuan Shao hesitated.","One night en route to Jizhou, Yuan Shao is disturbed by the sounds of men in distress. Wandering out, he overhears so many men in his army bemoaning the loss of friends, of brothers or fathers and uncles slain in the battle. Deeply touched and troubled, he becomes aware of the suffering of his own men, and even when he reaches safety in Jizhou his heart is distressed. Is there any point in going on?","When Yuan Shao came home in Jizhou, he was with troubled mind and distorted thoughts. He could not attend to the business of government and became so ill that his second wife, who came of the Liu family and had replaced the first wife after her death, besought him to make his last dispositions. Now three sons had been born to Yuan Shao: Yuan Tan the eldest, who was commander at Qingzhou; Yuan Xi, who ruled over Youzhou; and Yuan Shang, borne to him by Lady Liu. This youngest son was very handsome and noble looking, and his father's favorite. So he was kept at home. After the defeat at Guandu, the lad's mother was constantly urging that her son should be named as successor, and Yuan Shao called together four of his counselors to consider this matter. These four happened to be divided in their sympathies: Shen Pei and Peng Ji being in favor of the youngest son, and Xin Ping and Guo Tu supporters of the eldest. When they met to consult, Yuan Shao said, “As there is nought but war and trouble outside our borders, it is necessary that tranquillity within be early provided for, and I wish to appoint my successor. My eldest son is hard and cruel, my second is mild and unfit. The third has the outward form of a hero, appreciates the wise, and is courteous to his subordinates. I wish him to succeed, but I wish that you tell me your opinions.” Guo Tu said, “Yuan Tan is your first born, and he is in a position of authority beyond your control. If you pass over the eldest in favor of the youngest, you sow the seeds of turbulence. The prestige of the army has been somewhat lowered and enemies are on our border. Should you add to our weakness by making strife between father and son, elder and younger brothers? Rather consider how the enemy may be repulsed and turn to the question of the heirship later.” Then the natural hesitation of Yuan Shao asserted itself, and he could not make up his mind."
夤夜——深夜。,夤夜 - late night.,How?,“I have a plan.”

且說孫堅飛奔洛陽，遙望火燄沖天，黑煙鋪地，二三百里，並無雞犬人煙；堅先發兵救滅了火，令衆諸侯各於荒地上屯住軍馬。曹操來見袁紹曰：“今董賊西去，正可乘勢追襲；本初按兵不動，何也？”紹曰：“諸兵疲困，進恐無益。”操曰：“董賊焚燒宮室，劫遷天子，海內震動，不知所歸；此天亡之時也，一戰而天下定矣。諸公何疑而不進？”衆諸侯皆言不可輕動。操大怒曰：“豎子不足與謀！”遂自引兵萬餘，領夏侯惇、夏侯淵、曹仁、曹洪、李典、樂進，星夜來趕董卓。,"Let’s say that Sun Jian flew to Luoyang, looking at the flames rising into the sky, black smoke spread over the ground, two or three hundred miles away, there were no chickens, dogs and people. Cao Cao came to see Yuan Shao and said, ""Today the Dong bandits are going west, and they can take advantage of the situation to pursue them. Why didn't they hold back their troops at first?"" Shao said, ""The soldiers are exhausted, and it would be useless to advance."" Cao said, ""The Dong bandits burned the palace and robbed them. When the Son of Heaven is moved, the sea is shaken, and I don't know where to go; this time when the sky is dead, the world will be settled after a battle. Why do the princes doubt that they will not enter?"" All the princes said that they should not be taken lightly. Cao was furious and said, ""Shuzi is not enough and you have a plan!"" Then he led more than 10,000 troops, led Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Cao Ren, Cao Hong, Li Dian, and Le Jin, and came to chase Dong Zhuo at Xingye.","At last Xuande, his brothers-in-arms, and their men break through the pass, and Sun Jian gallops towards Luoyang. Yet for hundreds of miles nothing but desecration meets their gaze. Not a bird or animal can be seen or heard, nor any human being. Cao Cao is all for chasing after the retreating forces, but Yuan Shao disagrees, and so Cao Cao takes ten thousand men of his own and sets off in hot pursuit.","Sun Jian hastened to the late capital which was still in flames. When he arrived, dense smoke hung all over it and spread for miles around. No living thing, not a fowl, or a dog, or a human being, remained. Sun Jian told off his soldiers to extinguish the fires and set out camping places for the confederate lords. Cao Cao went to see Yuan Shao and said, “Dong Zhuo has gone west; we ought to follow and attack his rear without loss of time; why do you remain inactive?” “All our colleagues are worn out, and there is nothing to be gained by attack,” said Yuan Shao. Cao Cao said, “This moment was most propitious in the utter confusion that reigned, palaces burned, the Emperor abducted, the whole world upset, and no one knowing whither to turn. The villain will soon be ended, and a single blow could exterminate Dong Zhuo. Why not pursue?” But all the confederate lords seemed of one mind, and that mind was to postpone action. So they did nothing. “Those unworthy ones cannot discuss worthy thing,” cried Cao Cao. Then, he and his six generals—Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Cao Ren, Cao Hong, Li Dian, and Yue Jin—and ten thousand troops started in pursuit."

且說曹操軍糧告竭，急發使往許昌敎荀彧作速措辦糧草，星夜解赴軍前接濟。使者齎書而往；行不上三十里，被袁軍捉住，縛見謀士許攸。那許攸字子遠，少時曾與曹操為友，此時却在袁紹處為謀士。當下搜得使者所齎曹操催糧書信，逕來見紹曰：“曹操屯軍官渡，與我相持已久，許昌必空虛；若分一軍星夜掩襲許昌，則許昌可拔，而操可擒也。今操糧草已盡，正可乘此機會，兩路擊之。”紹曰：“曹操詭計極多，此書乃誘敵之計也。”攸曰：“今若不取，後將反受其害。”正話間，忽有使者自鄴郡來，呈上審配書。書中先說運糧事；後言許攸在冀州時，嘗濫受民間財物，且縱令子姪輩多科稅錢糧入己，今已收其子姪下獄矣。紹見書大怒曰：“濫行匹夫！尚有面目於吾前獻計耶！汝與曹操有舊，想今亦受他財賄，為他作奸細，啜賺吾軍耳！本當斬首，今權且寄頭在項！可速退出，今後不許相見！”許攸出，仰天歎曰：“忠言逆耳，豎子不足與謀！吾子姪已遭審配之害，吾何顏復見冀州之人乎！”遂欲拔劍自刎。左右奪劍勸曰：“公何輕生至此？袁紹不納直言，後必為曹操所擒。公旣與曹公有舊，何不棄暗投明？”只這兩句言語，點醒許攸；於是許攸逕投曹操。後人有詩歎曰：,"Let's say that Cao Cao's army was exhausted, so he urgently sent an envoy to Xuchang to teach Xun Yu to take quick measures to get food and grass, and Xing Yejie went to the army to help. The messenger left with a letter, but could not travel more than thirty li, was caught by Yuan army, and bound to see Xu You, a counselor. That Xu You, whose name is Ziyuan, was a friend of Cao Cao when he was young, but now he is a counselor at Yuan Shao. At the moment, he found the letter from Cao Cao urging food from the messenger, and he came to Shao and said: ""Cao Cao has been stationed in the military ferry, and I have been at each other for a long time, and Xuchang will be empty. Also. Now that we have run out of food and grass, we can take this opportunity to attack him in two ways."" Shao said, ""Cao Cao has many tricks, and this book is a trick to lure the enemy."" You said: ""If you don't take it now, you will be able to fight it later. Instead, he will suffer."" During the conversation, a messenger suddenly came from Ye County and presented the trial document. The book first talks about the transportation of grain; later, when Xu You was in Jizhou, he tried to take private property indiscriminately, and even though he ordered his sons and daughters to pay taxes and grains into himself, he has now taken his sons and sent them to prison. Shao Jianshu was furious and said: ""Abusive behavior! You still have a face to offer advice in front of me! You have an old relationship with Cao Cao, and you want to be bribed by him now, to be a spy for him, and to gain my army's ears! You should be beheaded. You can leave now, and you are not allowed to see each other in the future!"" Xu You came out and sighed up to the sky: ""The loyal words are disgusting, and the arrogance is not enough and the plot! Huh!"" He wanted to draw his sword and cut himself. The left and right seized swords and persuaded him, ""Why did the Duke commit suicide so far? Yuan Shao will not accept the blunt statement, and he will be captured by Cao Cao later. Gong Yan and Duke Cao have an old relationship, why not abandon the dark and turn to the light?"" Only these two words reminded Xu You; Cao Cao. A later poem sighed and said:","I think this letter is a trick.’ ‘But’, says an exasperated Xu You, ‘unless we attack now we’ll lose this golden opportunity.’ However, Yuan Shao is equally suspicious of Xu You and his past links with Cao Cao. ‘You,’ he shouts, ‘you’re part of Cao Cao’s plot! I could have you executed now. But instead just get out. Get out!’ Xu You is in despair, viewing Yuan Shao as little more than a fool, and in his anguish he takes up his sword meaning to kill himself. He is restrained by his own men and they say, ‘As Yuan Shao is now doomed to failure, why not cross over and rejoin Cao Cao?’ And this is exactly what he does. So delighted is Cao Cao to hear that his old friend Xu You has come, he rushes out to greet him, not even waiting to put his shoes on. ‘ Tell me, my old friend, how can we defeat Yuan Shao?’ ‘First tell me,’ says Xu You, ‘how much grain do you have?’ ‘At least a year,’ says Cao Cao, whereupon Xu You says, ‘Really?’","In Cao Cao's army also food was getting scarce, and a message was sent to Capital Xuchang to send grain quickly. The messenger with the letter, however, had not gone far when he fell into the hands of Yuan Shao's guards, who took him to the adviser Xu You. Seeing from the letter that Cao Cao was short of supplies, Xu You went to Yuan Shao and told him, saying, “Cao Cao and we have been at grips here for a long time, and Capital Xuchang must be undefended. A small army sent quickly could take it, and at the same moment an attack here would deliver Cao Cao into our hands. Now is the moment to strike, for his supplies are short.” Yuan Shao replied, “Cao Cao is full of ruses, and this letter is artfully designed to bring about a battle to suit himself.” “If you do not take this chance, he will do you some injury by and by.” Just at this juncture in came a dispatch from Yejun in which, after some details regarding the forwarding of grain, Shen Pei said he had discovered that Xu You had been in the habit of receiving bribes while in Jizhou and had winked at his relatives collecting excess taxes. One of his son and nephew were then in prison. At this Yuan Shao turned on Xu You angrily and said, “How can you have the face to stand before me and propose plans, you extortionate fellow? You and Cao Cao have old liking for each other, and he has bribed you to do his dirty work for him and help his base schemes. Now you want to betray my army. I ought to take off your head, but temporarily I will let your neck carry it away. Get out and never let me see you again.” The discredited adviser sighed and went out, saying, “Faithful words offend his ear. He is a pest and unworthy of advice from me. And now that Shen Pei has injured my son and nephew, how can I look my fellow folks in the face again?” And Xu You drew his sword to end his life. But his people prevented that. They said, “If Yuan Shao rejects your honest words, then assuredly he will be taken by Cao Cao. You are an old friend of Cao Cao's; why not abandon the shade for the sunlight?” Just these few words awakened Xu You to consciousness of his position, and he decided to leave Yuan Shao and go over to Cao Cao for he was an old friend. Vainly now for chances lost"
正行間，軍士稟曰：“前面有兩條路，請問丞相從那條路去？”操問：“那條路近？”軍士曰：“大路稍平，却遠五十餘里。小路投華容道，却近五十餘里；只是地窄路險，坑坎難行。”操令人上山觀望，回報：“小路山邊有數處煙起；大路並無動靜。”操敎前軍便走華容道小路。諸將曰：“烽煙起處，必有軍馬，何故反走這條路？”操曰：“豈不聞兵書有云：‘虛則實之，實則虛之。’諸葛亮多謀，故使人於山僻燒煙，使我軍不敢從這條山路走，他却伏兵於大路等着。吾料已定，偏不敎中他計！”諸將皆曰：“丞相妙算，人所不及。”遂勒兵走華容道。此時人皆飢倒，馬盡困乏。焦頭爛額者扶策而行，中箭着鎗者勉強而走。衣甲濕透，個個不全。軍器旗旛，紛紛不整。大半皆是彝陵道上被趕得慌，只騎得禿馬，鞍轡衣服，盡皆拋棄。正值隆冬嚴寒之時，其苦何可勝言。,"As they were walking, the sergeant said, ""There are two roads ahead. May I ask the Prime Minister which way to go?"" Cao asked, ""Which way is the closest?"" Huarong Road, but it is more than fifty miles away; it's just that the road is narrow and dangerous, and it is difficult to navigate in the pits."" Cao asked people to go up the mountain to watch, and reported: ""There are several places on the side of the road and the mountain; there is no movement on the main road."" Huarong Road. The generals said: ""Where the beacon smoke rises, there must be soldiers and horses, why did you go this way?"" Cao said: ""Have you heard that there is a saying in the military book: 'What is false is true, and what is true is false.' Zhuge Liang was very resourceful, so he sent people The smoke was burned in the middle of the mountain, so that our army did not dare to go down this mountain road, but he ambushed his troops on the main road and waited. I have already decided, but I will not let him in!"" All the generals said: ""The prime minister has a good plan, what people do. Not in time."" Then the soldiers walked to Huarong Road. At this time the people were starving and the horses were exhausted. Those who were battered and devastated walked with the help of policies, and those who were shot with arrows reluctantly walked away. Clothes and armor are soaked, all incomplete. The military flags and banners are in disarray. Most of them were driven to panic on Yiling Road, only riding bald horses, saddles and bridles, all abandoned. When it is in the middle of winter and it is cold, how can its suffering be better than words.","Cao Cao pauses in his flight, and one of the soldiers asks which of the two roads ahead they should take. ‘Which one is shorter?’ barks Cao Cao and is told that the main road is easier but longer while the road towards Huarong is shorter but much, much harder. Cao Cao’s men notice that smoke is rising from a number of places along that road but that the main road is clear, and so it is to everyone’s surprise that Cao Cao decides to take the road to Huarong. When he is questioned as to why, Cao Cao replies, ‘Remember what Sun Zi tells us in The Art of War: “When you are weak, pretend to be strong; when you are strong, pretend to be weak!” Kong Ming is full of tricks and he has had fires lit along that route to scare us off so we will walk into his trap on the main road. Well, I’m not falling for that trick!’ And so, disastrously, they turn off and head along the narrow road to Huarong. This is now a beleaguered, exhausted and worn-out band of men. Racked by hunger, weeping wounds, burns, almost unable to walk unaided, they drag themselves along, weighed down by sodden clothes and heavy hearts. It is the middle of winter, and the cold bites into them. Imagine their distress.","As they were going. the soldiers said, “There are two roads before us; which shall we take?” “Which is the shorter?” asked Cao Cao. “The high road is the more level, but it is fifteen miles longer than the bye road which goes to Huarong Valley. Only the latter road is narrow and dangerous, full of pits and difficult.” Cao Cao sent men up to the hill tops to look around. They returned, saying: “There are several columns of smoke rising from the hills along the bye road. The high road seems quiet.” Then Cao Cao bade them lead the way along the bye road. “Where smoke arises there are surely soldiers,” remarked the officers. “Why go this way?” “Because the 'Book of War' says that the hollow is to be regarded as solid, and the solid as hollow. That fellow Zhuge Liang is very subtle and has sent people to make those fires so that we should not go that way. He has laid an ambush on the high road. I have made up my mind, and I will not fall a victim to his wiles.” “O Prime Minister, your conclusions are most admirable. None other can equal you,” said the officers. And the soldiers were sent along the bye road. They were very hungry and many almost too weak to travel. The horses too were spent. Some had been scorched by the flames, and they rode forward resting their heads on their whips; the wounded struggled on to the last of their strength. All were soaking wet and all were feeble. Their arms and accouterments were in a deplorable state, and more than half had been left upon the road they had traversed. Few of the horses had saddles or bridles, for in the confusion of pursuit they had been left behind. It was the time of greatest winter cold, and the suffering was indescribable."

却說鍾縉、鍾紳二人攔住趙雲廝殺。趙雲挺鎗便刺，鍾縉當先揮大斧來迎。兩馬相交，戰不三合，被雲一鎗刺落馬下，奪路便走。背後鍾紳持戟趕來，馬尾相啣，那枝戟只在趙雲後心內弄影。雲急撥轉馬頭，恰好兩胸相拍。雲左手持鎗隔過畫戟，右手拔出靑釭寶劍砍去，帶盔連腦，砍去一半，紳落馬而死，餘衆奔散。趙雲得脫，望長坂橋而走。只聞後面喊聲大震：原來文聘引軍趕來。趙雲到得橋邊，人困馬乏。見張飛挺矛立馬於橋上，雲大呼曰：“翼德援我！”飛曰：“子龍速行，追兵我自當之。”,"But they said that Zhong Jin and Zhong Shen stopped Zhao Yun from fighting. Zhao Yun stabbed his spear, and Zhong Jin greeted him with a big axe. The two horses crossed each other, and the battle was not three. From behind, Zhong Shen came with a halberd, and the horsetails were attached to each other. The halberd was only a shadow in Zhao Yunhou's heart. Yun hurriedly turned his horse's head, just in time to pat his chest. Yun held the spear in his left hand across the painted halberd, and with his right hand he pulled out the sword and chopped it off. He wore a helmet and even his head, and chopped half off. Zhao Yun got off, looked at the Changban Bridge and left. I only heard the shouts from behind: It turned out that the civilians brought in the army. When Zhao Yun arrived at the bridge, he was exhausted. Seeing Zhang Fei holding his spear on the bridge immediately, Yun shouted: ""Yide help me!"" Fei said: ""Zilong go fast, I will be the chaser.""","So the two brothers think they can stop Zilong! Well, one falls from his horse dead as a stone when Zilong attacks, enabling him to make a bid for freedom. He is hotly pursued by the other brother. He rides so fast and furiously that he is able to touch the tail of Zilong’s horse. Zilong turns and with one swing of his sword kills his pursuer; then, facing forward again, he rides as if devils themselves were after him, towards the bridge and the hill where Xuande awaits him. But his troubles are not over yet, for streaming after him comes Wen Ping and his troops, crying out for vengeance. His horse is almost dead on its feet when Zilong at last reaches the bridge, and he cries out for Zhang Fei to help him. ‘Get yourself across quickly,’ shouts Zhang Fei. ‘I’ll deal with this lot.’","Zhong Jin was leading, flourishing his battle-ax. Zhao Yun engaged and very soon unhorsed him. Then Zhao Yun galloped away. Zhong Shen rode up behind ready with his halberd and his horse's nose got so close to the other's tail that in Zhao Yun could see in his armor the reflection of the play of Zhong Shen's weapon. Then suddenly, and without warning, Zhao Yun wheeled round his horse so that he faced his pursuer and their two steeds struck breast to breast. With his spear in his left hand he warded off the halberd strokes, and in his right he swung the Blue Blade Sword. One slash and he had cut through both helmet and head; Zhong Shen fell to the ground, a corpse with only half a head on his body. His followers fled, and Zhao Yun retook the road toward Long Slope Bridge. But in his rear arose another tumultuous shouting, seeming to rend the very sky, and Wen Ping came up behind. However, although the man was weary and his steed spent, Zhao Yun got close to the bridge where he saw standing, all ready for any fray, Zhang Fei. “Help me, Zhang Fei!” he cried and crossed the bridge. “Hasten!” cried Zhang Fei, “I will keep back the pursuers.”"
却說呂布正走，逢諸將皆回。陳宮亦已尋着。布曰：“吾軍雖少，尚可破曹。”遂再引軍來。正是：,"But he said that Lu Bu was leaving, and all the generals would return. Chen Gong has also been looking for it. Bu said, ""Although my army is small, we can still defeat Cao Cao."" Then he brought in another army. Exactly:","With the threat from Lü Bu contained, Cao Cao returns to his consuming desire to try to capture Xuzhou, in order to punish those whom he believes have murdered his family. But he is persuaded that the time is not right. So instead he attacks and wipes out a rebel army of Yellow Headbands and then suddenly advances upon Puyang and drives out Lü Bu. He goes on to capture most of the northeast.","Lu Bu in his retreat fell in with his generals, and Chen Gong also rejoined him, so that he was by no means broken. “I have but small army,” said Lu Bu, “but still enough to break Cao Cao.” And so he retook the backward road. Indeed:"

The song says:","Soon after getting back to Xinye and being reunited with his band of warriors, Xuande is passing through the marketplace and hears a man dressed in simple clothes singing this song:","On reentering the city, Liu Bei met a person in the street wearing a hempen turban, a cotton robe confined by a black girdle, and black shoes.

Yu dispatched Xishan to set fire to the fire, and Nanpingshan raised a flag. Everyone is ready to stop, just waiting for the evening to act.","News comes from Sun Quan that he has despatched troops towards Qizhou and Huangzhou. Hearing that, Zhou Yu sends men to the Western hills with fire bombs and to raise the battle banner on Nanping mountain. Now all that remains is to wait for dusk to fall and for the battle to commence.",Then came a messenger bearing a mandate from Sun Quan making Lu Xun Leader of the Van. He was ordered to go to Qichun. Sun Quan himself would support Lu Xun. Zhou Yu also sent a unit to the Western Hills to make signals and to hoist flags on the Nanping Mountains. So all being prepared they waited for dusk.

且說張飛自以為得計，領輕騎在前，突入操寨，但見零零落落，無多人馬，四邊火光大起，喊聲齊舉。飛知中計，急出寨外。正東張遼、正西許褚、正南于禁、正北李典、東南徐晃、西南樂進、東北夏侯惇、西北夏侯淵，八處軍馬殺來。張飛左衝右突，前遮後當；所領軍兵原是曹操手下舊軍，見事勢已急，盡皆投降去了。飛正殺間，逢着徐晃大殺一陣，後面樂進趕到。飛殺條血路突圍而走，只有數十騎跟定。欲還小沛，去路已斷；欲投徐州、下邳，又恐曹軍截住；尋思無路，只得望芒碭山而去。,"Let's say that Zhang Fei thought he had a plan. He led the light cavalry in the front and broke into the Cao Village, but when he saw that there were no more people and horses, there were fires on all sides, and shouts were raised in unison. Fei know the plan, rush out of the village. In the east, Zhang Liao, in the west, Xu Chu, in the south, Yujin, in the north, Li Dian, in the southeast, Xu Huang, in the southwest, Lejin, in the northeast, Xiahou Dun in the northwest, and Xiahouyuan in the northwest. Zhang Fei rushed to the left and rushed to the right, covering the front and the back; the army he led was originally Cao Cao's old army. Seeing that the situation was urgent, they all surrendered. Feizheng was killing, and when Xu Huang was killing a while, Le Jin arrived later. Flying and killing a bloody road to break through the encirclement, only dozens of horses followed. If you want to return Xiaopei, the way to go is cut off; if you want to go to Xuzhou and Xiapi, you are afraid that Cao's army will intercept;","Zhang Fei charges in first, only to find the camp virtually deserted. As it dawns on him that he has fallen into a trap, fires break out all around him, trapping him. No matter which way he turns he is confronted by the might of Cao Cao’s senior commanders closing in for the kill. His own men, only recently captured by him from Cao Cao’s own troops, desert him, and he finds himself fighting almost alone on all fronts. Through sheer bravado he slashes his way through the surrounding warriors and makes good his escape. Finding the road to Xiaopei cut off and fearing that the ways to Xiapi and Xuzhou would also be closed to him, he races for the safety of the Mang Dang hills.","Zhang Fei, since he was the originator of the stratagem, led the way with some light horse. As they drew near, everything seemed very quiet and no one seemed moving. Then suddenly lights flashed out all about them, and Zhang Fei saw he had fallen into a trap. At once from all the eight directions came out the ambushing troops. From east, west, north, south were Zhang Liao, Xu Chu, Li Dian, and Yu Jin. From northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest were Xiahou Dun, Xiahou Yuan, Xu Huang, and Yue Jin. Zhang Fei, dashing this way and rushing that, guarding his van and protecting his rear, vainly tried to clear himself. The soldiers he had, being originally Cao Cao's troops, soon gave in and returned to their old leader. The position became very desperate. Zhang Fei met Xu Huang and engaged him, but his rear was also attacked by Yue Jin. At length he cut an arterial alley out and with a half score of his troops started to return to Xiaopei. The retreat was cut off."

次日早飯畢，又來城下搦戰。韓玄坐在城上，敎黃忠出馬。忠引數百騎殺過弔橋，再與雲長交馬。又鬥五六十合，勝負不分。兩軍齊聲喝采。鼓聲正急時，雲長撥馬便走。黃忠趕來。雲長方欲用刀砍去，忽聽得腦後一聲響；急回頭看時，見黃忠被戰馬前失，掀在地下。雲長急回馬，雙手舉刀猛喝曰：“我且饒你性命！快換馬來廝殺！”黃忠急提起馬蹄，飛身上馬，奔入城中。玄驚問之。忠曰：“此馬久不上陣，故有此失。”玄曰：“汝箭百發百中，何不射之？”忠曰：“來日再戰，必然詐敗，誘到弔橋邊射之。”玄以自己所乘一匹靑馬與黃忠。忠拜謝而退，尋思：“難得雲長如此義氣！他不忍殺害我，我又安忍射他？若不射，又恐違了將令。”是夜躊躇未定。次日天曉，人報雲長搦戰。忠領兵出城。雲長兩日戰黃忠不下，十分焦躁，抖擻威風，與忠交馬。戰不到三十餘合，忠詐敗，雲長趕來。忠想昨日不殺之恩，不忍便射，帶住刀，把弓虛拽弦響，雲長急閃，却不見箭；雲長又趕，忠又虛拽，雲長急閃，又無箭；只道黃忠不會射，放心趕來。將近弔橋，黃忠在橋上搭箭開弓，弦響箭到，正射在雲長盔纓根上。前面軍齊聲喊起。雲長吃了一驚，帶箭回寨，方知黃忠有百步穿楊之能，今日只射盔纓，正是報昨日不殺之恩也。雲長領兵而退。,"After breakfast the next day, he came to the city to fight again. Han Xuan sat on the city and ordered Huang Zhong to go out. Zhongyin killed hundreds of horses across the suspension bridge, and then crossed the horse with Yunchang. There are fifty or sixty fights, and the outcome is not determined. The two armies cheered in unison. When the drum sound was urgent, Yun Chang plucked his horse and left. Huang Zhong came. Yun Changfang was about to slash with a knife, but suddenly heard a sound in the back of his head; when he looked back, he saw that Huang Zhong had been lost in front of the horse and was thrown to the ground. Yun Chang hurried back to his horse, raised his sword in both hands and shouted fiercely, ""I'll spare your life! Quickly change horses to fight!"" Huang Zhong hurriedly lifted his horse's hooves, flew on his horse, and ran into the city. Xuan Jing asked. Zhong said: ""This horse has not been in battle for a long time, so there is such a loss."" Xuan said: ""You arrows have been hit a hundred times, so why don't you shoot them?"" Zhong said: ""If you fight again in the future, you will definitely lose and lure you to the side of the drawbridge to shoot them. ""Xuan Yi rode a horse that he rode with Huang Zhong. Zhongbai thanked him and retreated, thinking, ""It's rare for Yunchang to be so loyal! He can't bear to kill me, but I can bear to shoot him? If I don't shoot, I'm afraid I'll violate the commander's order."" Ye was hesitant. The next day dawned, and people reported that the clouds were fighting for a long time. Loyal leads troops out of the city. Yun Chang couldn't fight against Huang Zhong for two days. After less than thirty battles, Zhongxiao was defeated, and Chang Yun came. Zhong thought of the grace of not killing yesterday, so he couldn't bear to shoot, he took the knife, and the bow was slammed, and the long cloud flashed, but the arrow was not seen; ; Only that Huang Zhong can't shoot, so rest assured. Approaching the suspension bridge, Huang Zhong set up an arrow on the bridge and opened a bow, the string rang and the arrow hit the tassel root of Yunchang's helmet. The army in front shouted in unison. Yun Chang was taken aback, and brought the arrow back to the village, knowing that Huang Zhong had the ability to penetrate Yang at a hundred paces. Long Yun led the troops to retreat.","The next day they battle again. After some fifty to sixty bouts, Guan Yu turns as if to flee, ‘trailing his sword’, as the saying goes, and pursued by Huang Zhong. Just as Guan Yu prepares to spring his surprise attack by turning round, he hears the sound of someone falling. Looking back, he sees that Huang Zhong has fallen from his horse. Raising his mighty sword high, he rides towards the fallen warrior and the shouts out, ‘I spare you. Find yourself another horse, and we will meet again to finish this once and for all!’ Huang Zhong collects his horse and gallops back to Wuling. The governor, Han Xuan, is confounded by this, but Huang Zhong says it is the fault of the horse, who is unused to such intense warfare. ‘But you’re a superb archer,’ says Han Xuan. ‘Why didn’t you just shoot him?’ So Huang Zhong agrees to try to lure Guan Yu back to the city walls and then kill him with an arrow. Mounted on a new horse given especially by the governor, Huang Zhong prepares for the next day but deep down he is troubled. ‘ Is there another man who would have acted as honourably as Guan Yu did today? Can I really use such a trick to shoot the man who gave me back my life? On the other side, can I refuse an order from my superior?’ That night he tosses and turns, unable to resolve this conflict of loyalty and honour. The next day they ride out again and clash dramatically. After thirty inconclusive bouts Huang Zhong turns and flees, and Guan Yu follows closely behind, intent this time on seizing victory. At the crucial moment when Huang is supposed to shoot Guan Yu, he still cannot resolve his moral dilemma and so first of all just twangs the bowstring, which at least causes Guan Yu to duck. Huang does this again, and again Guan Yu ducks, thinking, ‘Well, he’s not much of a shot.’ The third time Huang notches an arrow and lets fly. The arrow strikes the top notch of Guan Yu’s helmet, and this sufficiently alarms Guan Yu that he turns and retreats while from the walls the soldiers cheer and jeer. Only when he looks carefully at where the arrow has lodged does Guan Yu realize that Huang Zhong has acted virtuously, as he, Guan Yu, acted the day before. In the light of such mutual respect, Guan Yu orders his men to raise the siege.","Next day, the early meal eaten, Guan Yu came to the city wall and offered his challenge. The Governor seated himself on the city wall and bade his veteran warrior go out to accept it. At the head of a few horsemen, Huang Zhong dashed across the drawbridge. The two champions engaged, and at the end of half a hundred bouts neither had the advantage. On both sides the soldiers cheered lustily. When the drums were beating most furiously, suddenly Guan Yu wheeled round his horse and fled. Of course Huang Zhong followed. Just as the moment for the feint arrived, Guan Yu heard behind him a tremendous crash and turned to see his pursuer lying prone upon the ground. Huang Zhong's steed had stumbled and thrown him. Guan Yu turned, raised his sword in both hands, and cried in a fierce tone, “I spare your life, but quick! Get another horse and come again to battle.” Huang Zhong pulled his horse to its feet hastily, leapt upon its back, and went into the city at full speed. The Governor was astonished and asked for an account of the accident. “The horse is too old,” replied Huang Zhong. “Why did you not shoot since your aim is so perfect?” asked the Governor. “I will try again tomorrow,” said Huang Zhong. “Then I will run away as if overcome, and so tempt him to the drawbridge and then shoot him.” Han Xuan gave the veteran a gray horse that he usually rode himself; Huang Zhong thanked him and retired. But Huang Zhong could not forget Guan Yu's generous conduct, nor could he understand it. He could not make up his mind to shoot the man who had spared his life. Yet if he did not shoot, he betrayed his duty as a soldier. It was very perplexing, and the whole night spent in thinking it over found him still undecided. At daybreak a man came in saying that Guan Yu was near the wall and challenging them again. So Huang Zhong gave order to go out. Now Guan Yu, having fought for two days and not having overcome Huang Zhong, was very ill at ease. So he called up all his dignity when he went forth to fight that day. When they had got to the thirtieth bout, Huang Zhong fled as if he was overcome. Guan Yu pursued. As he rode away, Huang Zhong thought in his heart, “He spared me only yesterday, and I cannot bear to shoot him today.” Putting up his sword, Huang Zhong took his bow and twanged the string only; no arrow flew. Guan Yu dodged, but seeing no arrow in the air, he retook the pursuit. Again Huang Zhong twanged an arrowless bowstring, and again Guan Yu dodged, but no arrow came. Then Guan Yu said to himself, “He cannot shoot,” and pressed on in pursuit. As they neared the city wall, the veteran stopped on the drawbridge, fitted an arrow, pulled the bow, and sent an arrow flying that just hit the base of the plume on Guan Yu's helmet. The soldiers shouted at the display of marksmanship. Guan Yu was taken aback and set off for camp with the arrow still sticking. Then he heard that Huang Zhong's skill was said to be equal to piercing a willow leaf at a hundred paces, and Guan Yu understood that he owed this warning in the shape of an arrow in his plume to gratitude for sparing the veteran the preceding day. Both withdrew."
不一日，袁熙、高幹皆領軍到城外，屯兵三處，每日出兵與操相持。尚屢敗，操兵屢勝。至建安八年春二月，操分路攻打，袁譚、袁熙、袁尚、高幹皆大敗，棄黎陽而走。操引兵迫至冀州。譚與尚入城堅守；熙與幹離城三十里下寨，虛張聲勢。操兵連日攻打不下。郭嘉進曰：“袁氏廢長立幼，而兄弟之間，權力相併，各自樹黨，急之則相救，緩之則相爭；不如舉兵南向荊州，征討劉表，以候袁氏兄弟之變；變成而後擊之，可一舉而定也。”操善其言，命賈詡為太守，守黎陽；曹洪引兵守官渡。操引大軍向荊州進兵。,"Not a day later, Yuan Xi and Gao Gan led the army outside the city, stationed troops in three places, and sent troops every day to maintain a stalemate. Still loses repeatedly, troop wins repeatedly. In the spring and February of the eighth year of Jian'an, Cao branched off to attack, Yuan Tan, Yuan Xi, Yuan Shang, and Gao Gan were all defeated and left Liyang. Cao led troops to Jizhou. Tan Yushang entered the city and stood firm; Xi and Gan went down to the village thirty miles away from the city and bluffed. Cao soldiers were unable to attack for days. Guo Jiajin said: ""The Yuan clan abolishes the elders and establishes the young, and the brothers share power and establish a party. If they are urgent, they will save each other, and if they are slow, they will fight each other. It is better to raise troops south to Jingzhou, attack Liu Biao, and wait for Yuan clan. Brothers change; if they become and attack them later, they can be decided in one fell swoop."" Cao was good at his words, and ordered Jia Xu to be the prefect to guard Liyang; Cao Hong led troops to guard Guandu. Cao led the army to advance to Jingzhou.","Fearful of him, when his brother asks for reinforcements to fight Cao Cao, Yuan Shang sends such a pathetically small force it is swiftly wiped out by Cao Cao’s men. Yuan Shang’s strategy is to ensure that it is Cao Cao who will kill Yuan Tan. In the early months of AD 203 Cao Cao goes on the attack again. However, he is unable to take Jizhou and, frustrated, he withdraws. It is then that Guo Jia, his adviser, comes up with a simple but deadly plan. If they can get the two brothers Yuan Shang and his older brother Yuan Tan to really fall out, then this divide and rule would work to their benefit. Yuan Tan is already deeply resentful that he, as the older son, has been passed over by their father on his deathbed. As a result Yuan Tan is easily drawn into conspiracy with Cao Cao.","Before long Yuan Xi, the second brother, and their cousin, Gao Gan, arrived with their legions and also camped outside the city. Engagements took place daily, and Yuan Shang suffered many defeats. On the other hand Cao Cao was victorious and elated. In the second month of the eighth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 203), Cao Cao made separate attacks on all four armies and won the day against each. Then the Yuans abandoned Liyang, and Cao Cao pursued them to Jizhou, where Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang went into the city to defend it, while their brother and cousin camped about ten miles away making a show of great force. When Cao Cao had made many attacks without success, Guo Jia proffered the following plan. He said, “There is dissension among the Yuans because the elder has been superseded in the succession. The brothers are about equally strong and each has his party. If we oppose them; they unite to assist each other; but if we have patience, they will be weakened by family strife. Wherefore send first a force to reduce Liu Biao in Jingzhou, and let the fraternal quarrels develop. When they have fully developed, we can smite them and settle the matter.” Cao Cao approved of the plan. So leaving Jia Xu as Governor of Liyang and Cao Hong as guard at Guandu, the army went away toward Jingzhou."
却說關雲長放了曹操，引軍自回。此時諸路軍馬，皆得馬匹、器械、錢糧，已回夏口；獨雲長不獲一人一騎，空身回見玄德。孔明正與玄德作賀，忽報雲長至。孔明忙離坐席，執盃相迎曰：“且喜將軍立此蓋世之功，與普天下除大害。合宜遠接慶賀！”雲長默然。孔明曰：“將軍莫非因吾等不曾遠接，故爾不樂？”回顧左右曰：“汝等緣何不先報？”雲長曰：“關某特來請死。”孔明曰：“莫非曹操不曾投華容道上來？”雲長曰：“是從那裏來。關某無能，因此被他走脫。”孔明曰：“拏得甚將士來？”雲長曰：“皆不曾拏。”孔明曰：“此是雲長想曹操昔日之恩，故意放了。但旣有軍令狀在此，不得不按軍法。”遂叱武士推出斬之。正是：,"However, Guan Yunchang released Cao Cao and led the army back. At this time, the army and horses of the various routes had all obtained horses, equipment, and money and food, and had returned to Xiakou; Du Yunchang was not able to get one person to ride, and returned to Xuande empty body. Kong Ming was congratulating Xuande when he suddenly reported that the cloud had arrived. Kong Ming hurriedly left the seat, greeted him with a cup, and said, ""I'm glad that the general has made this unparalleled achievement and eradicated great harm to the whole world. It's appropriate to celebrate from afar!"" Yun Chang was silent. Kong Ming said, ""Is it possible that the general is not happy because we have not been in contact with you?"" Looking back, he said, ""Why didn't you report first?"" Yun Chang said, ""Guan is here to ask for his death."" Kong Ming said, ""Could it be that Didn't Cao Cao come up to Huarong Road?"" Yun Chang said, ""Where did he come from? Guan was incompetent, so he was let go."" Kong Ming said, ""How many soldiers did you get?"" Yun Chang said, ""None of them."" Kong Ming said: ""This is because Yun Chang thought of Cao Cao's favor in the past, and deliberately let it go. But there is a military order here, so I have to follow the military law."" So he ordered the warrior to kill him. Exactly:","Let us now return to Guan Yu. He has made his way back to the victorious army’s camp, where the leaders are celebrating their triumphs and trophies of victory. He alone has returned with nothing. Kong Ming rubs this in. Hearing Guan Yu has returned, he goes out to meet him and says, ‘Congratulations! You have got rid of the worst enemy and we should’ve prepared a proper Triumph for you on your return.’ To this, Guan Yu says nothing – there is nothing to say. So Kong Ming continues in a similar vein of faux congratulations until Guan Yu barks out, ‘I’ve come back to die.’ ‘Why?’ asks Kong Ming. ‘Didn’t Cao Cao come that way in the end?’ ‘He did, but I was foolish enough to let him go.’ ‘So who did you capture? Where are they?’ asks Kong Ming.","After having allowed the escape of Cao Cao, Guan Yu found his way back to headquarters. By this time the other detachments had returned bringing spoil of horses and weapons and supplies of all kinds. Only Guan Yu came back empty-handed. When he arrived, Zhuge Liang was with his brother congratulating him on his success. When Guan Yu was announced, Zhuge Liang got up and went to welcome him, bearing a cup of wine. “Joy! O General,” said Zhuge Liang. “You have done a deed that overtops the world. You have removed the empire's worst foe and ought to have been met at a distance and felicitated.” Guan Yu muttered inaudibly, and Zhuge Liang continued, “I hope it is not because we have omitted to welcome you on the road that you seem sad.” Turning to those about him, Zhuge Liang said, “Why did you not tell us Guan Yu was coming?” “I am here to ask for death,” said Guan Yu. “Surely Cao Cao came through the valley?” “Yes; he came that way, and I could not help it; I let him go.” “Then whom have you captured?” “No one.” “Then you remembered the old kindness of Cao Cao and so allowed him to escape. But your acceptance of the task with its conditions is here."

Zan said, ""I will borrow two thousand horses from your army."" Xuande said, ""More I hope to borrow Zhao Zilong and his party."" Zan Xuzhi. Xuande then led Guan and Zhang to lead 3,000 people from the headquarters, and Zilong led 2,000 people to Xuzhou.","Once inside the city, Xuande is asked by Kong Rong to join him in coming to the assistance of Tao Qian and oppose Cao Cao","Liu Bei went away to his friend Gongsun Zan and laid before Gongsun Zan his design to help Xuzhou. “Cao Cao and you are not enemies; why do you spend yourself for the sake of another?” said Gongsun Zan. “I have promised,” Liu Bei replied, “and dare not break faith.” “I will lend you two thousand horse and foot,” said Gongsun Zan. “Also I wish to have the services of Zhao Yun,” said Liu Bei. Gongsun Zan agreed to this also. They marched away, Liu Bei's own troops being in the front, and Zhao Yun, with the borrowed troops, being in rear."

Chu was furious, drew his sword to kill You, raised his head to see Cao Cao, and said, ""Xu You is so rude, you should kill him.""

He says it is because they have suffered so much during the wars. He also tries to bring in the best advisers to help him run the region.

One day Xu Chu, riding in at the east gate, met Xu You, who called out to him, “Would you fellows be riding through here if it had not been for me?” Xu Chu replied, “We fellows, those who survive and those who perished, risked our lives in bloody battle to get this city, so do not brag of your deeds!” “You are a lot of blockheads, not worth talking about,” said Xu You. Xu Chu in his anger drew his sword and ran Xu You through. Then he took Xu You's head and went to tell Cao Cao the reason. Said Cao Cao, “He and I were old friends and we could joke together. Why did you kill him?” Cao Cao blamed Xu Chu very severely and gave orders that the corpse should be buried honorably. Cao Cao inquired for any wise and reputable people who were known to be living in the region and was told: “Commander Cui Yan, of Dongwu, who had on many occasions given valuable advice to Yuan Shao. As the advice was not followed, he had pleaded indisposition and remained at home.” Cao Cao sent for this man, gave him an office and said to him, “According to the former registers, there are three hundred thousand households in the region so that one may well call it a major region.” Cui Yan replied, “The empire is rent and the country is torn; the Yuan brothers are at war, and the people have been stripped naked. Yet, Sir, you do not hasten to inquire after local conditions and how to rescue the people from misery, but first compute the possibilities of taxation. Can you expect to gain the support of our people by such means?” Cao Cao accepted the rebuke, changed the policy, thanked him, and treated him all the better for it."

On the flags, the big book ""Rebel against the ministers and the party"" was cut out of the city, and they took the money. Li Jue and Guo Si drove millions of people from Luoyang to Chang'an. Each group of people, and a group of soldiers, dragged each other; the number of people who died in the ravines was innumerable. And let the soldiers prostitute their wives and daughters, and rob people of food; the sound of crying shook the heavens and the earth. If anyone is late, the three thousand soldiers behind him will urge the governor, and the soldiers will kill people on the road with bare knives in their hands. Zhuo Lingxing, instructed the various gates to set fire to the houses of residents, and set fire to the ancestral temples and palaces. The two palaces in the north and south are connected by flames; the palaces in Changle are all scorched earth. They also sent Lü Bu to excavate the tombs of the first emperor and his concubine, and took their treasures. Soldiers took advantage of the momentum to excavate the graves of officials and civilians. Dong Zhuo loaded thousands of cars with gold, beads, satin, and other good things, robbed the emperor and the concubine, and went to Chang'an.","As a direct consequence of this evil plan, five thousand troops are sent into the city. They murder thousands, not only the leading nobles and wealthy merchants, but also their entire families. Millions of the city’s citizens are then driven out on the long march towards Chang’an. But many of them die en route, while the soldiers rape and pillage at will until the cries of the oppressed touch both Heaven and Earth. Finally, as Dong Zhuo is about to leave he commands that the whole city – including the ancestral shrines and palaces – should be burned to the ground. The imperial tombs are smashed open on his command, and the treasures of the emperors and empresses are scattered while the soldiers break into the tombs of the nobility and the rich. At last Xuande, his brothers-in-arms, and their men break through the pass, and Sun Jian gallops towards Luoyang.","Dong Zhuo sent five thousand troops out to plunder and slay. They captured many thousand wealthy householders and, having stuck flags on their heads saying they were “Traitors and Rebels,” drove them out of the city and put them to death. Their properties were all seized. The task of driving forth the inhabitants, some millions, was given to two of Dong Zhuo's commanders, Li Jue and Guo Si. The people were sent off in bands, each band between two parties of soldiers, who drove them forward Changan. Enormous numbers fell by the road side and died in the ditches, and the escort plundered the fugitives and defiled the women. A wail of sorrow arose to the very sky. Dong Zhuo's final orders as he left Capital Luoyang were to burn the whole city; houses, palaces, temples, and everything was devoured by the flames. The capital became but a patch of scorched earth. Dong Zhuo sent Lu Bu to desecrate the tombs of the emperors and their consorts for the jewels therein, and the common soldiers took the occasion to dig up the graves of officers and plunder the cemeteries of the wealthy.

Cheng can only have to welcome. Cao said, ""Why didn't you come to the banquet at night?"" Cheng said, ""I haven't recovered from a minor illness, so I don't dare to take it lightly."" Cao said, ""This is worrying about the country's illness."" Cheng was stunned. Cao said, ""Does Uncle Guo know about Jiping?"" Cheng said, ""I don't know."" Cao sneered and said, ""How can Uncle Guo not know?"" Calling left and right: ""Leave and Uncle Guo get sick."" Cheng said nothing. After a while, twenty jailers pushed Jiping down the stairs. Ji Ping scolded: ""Cao Cao is a traitor!"" Cao said to Cheng, ""This person once climbed down the prince's suit and waited for four people, and I have taken the court captain. There is one person who has not been caught."" Because he asked Ping and said, ""Who is it? Make Nilai medicine me? You can quickly recruit!"" Ping said: ""Angel, I'm here to kill the traitor!"" There is no place for punishment. Take the seat and watch it, your heart is like a knife. Cao asked Ping again, ""You have ten fingers, but now you only have nine fingers?"" Ping said, ""I swear by chewing it, and I swear to kill the traitors of the country!"" I've cut it, and I'll teach you to swear!"" Ping said, ""You still have a mouth to swallow a thief, and a tongue to scold a thief!"" He ordered to cut his tongue. Ping said: ""Don't do it. I can't beat the punishment now, so I can only confess. I can release my bondage."" Cao said: ""What's the obstacle to the release?"" Ping got up and looked at Que and said, ""I can't get rid of thieves for the country, it's only a few days!"" Commands are divided into body commands. It was also the first month of the fifth year of Jian'an. The historian has a poem that says:","The next day Cao Cao, surrounded by his bodyguards, goes to Dong Cheng’s house. ‘Why didn’t you come for the feast last night?’ asks Cao Cao. Dong Cheng says that he had a sickness. Cao Cao replies, ‘Could it be that you had a touch of anxiety about the Han?’ As Dong Cheng takes on board what this means, Cao Cao continues, ‘I expect you heard all about the Ji Ping affair? No? Well, I’m surprised.’ At this point Cao Cao orders Ji Ping to be brought in – so as to ‘cure the imperial brother-in-law’s illness’! Once again Cao Cao orders Ji Ping to say who has instigated this revolt, and once again Ji Ping claims he acted alone. So yet again Ji Ping is beaten. Dong Cheng feels his heart break with sadness and terror. ‘I note that you have lost the tip of one of your fingers,’ observes Cao Cao. ‘Why is that?’ And when Ji Ping says it is as a sign that he is committed to killing Cao Cao, Cao Cao takes a knife and cuts off all of Ji Ping’s fingers. ‘Hah!’ exclaims Ji Ping, ‘I still have a tongue to curse a traitor’, and when Cao Cao gives orders that his tongue be cut out, Ji Ping appears to break down. ‘OK, I will tell you everything. Just release me from my ropes.’ No sooner is that done than Ji Ping faces towards the imperial palace and says, ‘It’s Heaven’s will that I not succeed’, and so saying he smashes his head on to the stone steps and dies. As a well-known historian has written: In the dismal days of the decline of the Han There lived a simple doctor, no warrior he. He risked his life","Next day Cao Cao with a large following went to the State Uncle's palace to ask after his health. Dong Cheng came out to receive his visitor, who at once said, “Why did you not come last night?” “I am not quite well yet and have to be very careful about going out,” replied Dong Cheng. “One might say you were suffering from national sorrow, eh?” said Cao Cao. Dong Cheng started. Cao Cao continued, “Have you heard of the Ji Ping affair?” “No; what is it?” Cao Cao smiled coldly, saying, “How can it be you do not know?” He turned to his attendants and told them to bring in the prisoner, while he went on talking to his host about national illness. Dong Cheng was much put about and knew not what to do. Soon the gaolers led in the physician to the steps of the hall. At once the bound man began to rail at Cao Cao as rebel and traitor. “This man,” said Cao Cao, pointing to Ji Ping, “has implicated Wang Zifu and three others, all of whom are now under arrest. There is one more whom I have not caught yet.” “Who sent you to poison me?” continued Cao Cao, turning toward the physician. “Quick, tell me!” “Heaven sent me to slay a traitor!” Cao Cao angrily ordered them to beat Ji Ping again, but there was no part of his body that could be beaten. Dong Cheng sat looking at him, his heart feeling as if transfixed with a dagger. “You were born with ten fingers; how is it you have now only nine?” Ji Ping replied, “I bit off one as a pledge when I swore to slay a traitor.” Cao Cao told them to bring a knife, and they lopped off his other nine fingers. “Now they are all off; that will teach you to make pledges.” “Still I have a mouth that can swallow a traitor and a tongue that can curse him,” said Ji Ping. Cao Cao told them to cut out his tongue. Ji Ping said, “Do not. I cannot endure any more punishment, I shall have to speak out. Loosen my bonds.” “Loose them. There is no reason why not,” said Cao Cao. They loosed him. As soon as he was free, Ji Ping stood up, turned his face toward the Emperor's palace and bowed, saying, “It is Heaven's will that thy servant has been unable to remove the evil.” Then he turned and smashed his head into the steps and died. His body was quartered and exposed. This happened in the first month of the fifth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 200), and a certain historian wrote a poem:"
關、張相見，各洒淚言失散之事。雲長曰：“我在海州路上住紮，探得消息，故來至此。”張飛曰：“弟在芒碭山住了這幾時，今日幸得相遇。”兩個敍話畢，一同引兵來見玄德，哭拜於地。玄德悲喜交集，引二人見曹操，便隨操入徐州。糜竺接見，具言家屬無恙，玄德甚喜。陳珪父子亦來參拜曹操。操設一大宴，犒勞諸將。操自居中，使陳珪居右、玄德居左。其餘將士，各依次坐。宴罷，操嘉陳珪父子之功，加封十縣之祿，授登為伏波將軍。,"Guan and Zhang met each other, and each shed tears and talked about their separation. Yun Chang said: ""I live on Haizhou Road, and I found out the news, so I came here."" Zhang Fei said, ""My brother has lived in Mount Mangdang for a long time, and I was fortunate to meet today."" Come to see Xuande, cry and worship the ground. Xuande was mixed with joy and sorrow, and led the two to see Cao Cao, and they followed Cao into Xuzhou. Mi Zhu received him and said that his family members were safe, and Xuande was very happy. Chen Gui and his son also visited Cao Cao. Set up a feast to reward the generals. Cao placed himself in the center, with Chen Gui on the right and Xuande on the left. The rest of the soldiers were seated in turn. After the banquet, the merits of Chen Gui's father and son were awarded, and the ten counties were awarded the title of General Fubo.","With nowhere else to go and with Zhang Fei closing in on him, Lü Bu has no option but to escape to his fallback city of Xiapi.","So the two brothers, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, were together again after their separation. Both shed tears of joy as they told each other what they had seen and suffered. “I was on the Haizhou Road when I heard of you,” said Guan Yu. “I lost no time in starting.” “And I had been camped in the Mangdang Hills for a long time. It is happiness to be together again.” So they talked. Then they marched off together to find their elder brother, and made their salutations with tears. In Liu Bei's heart, sadness and joy intermingled. Next they were presented to Cao Cao, and with him they went into the captured Xuzhou City. Mi Zhu soon came with the welcome news of the safety of the family. And Chen Gui and Chen Deng came to present their salutations. A grand banquet was prepared for the officers at which Cao Cao presided as host, and Chen Gui and Liu Bei occupied the seats of honor to his right and left. At the close of the banquet, Cao Cao paid the two Chens the highest compliments on their success and rewarded them with the revenues of ten counties beside giving the son the title of General Who Quells the Waves."
輔主眞堪敬，辭親實可哀。,"The auxiliary master is truly worthy of respect, and it is sad to say goodbye to a relative.","Alas, his lord didn’t value his words;","Wherefore in vain possessed he great talents. Nevertheless, in that he stood by his master. To parting with wife and mother, He merits our pity and profound respect."
關公曰：“盧中郎已被逮，別人領兵，我等去無所依，不如且回涿郡。”玄德從其言，遂引軍北行。行無二日，忽聞山後喊聲大震。玄德引關、張縱馬上高岡望之，見漢軍大敗，後面漫山塞野，黃巾蓋地而來，旗上大書“天公將軍”。玄德曰：“此張角也！可速戰！”三人飛馬引軍而出。張角正殺敗董卓，乘勢趕來，忽遇三人衝殺，角軍大亂，敗走五十餘里。三人救了董卓回寨。卓問三人現居何職。玄德曰：“白身。”卓甚輕之，不為禮。玄德出，張飛大怒曰：“我等親赴血戰，救了這廝，他却如此無禮！若不殺之，難消我氣！”便要提刀入帳來殺董卓。正是：,"Guan Gong said: ""Lu Zhonglang has been arrested, others lead the army, and I have nowhere to go. It is better to return to Zhuo County."" Xuande followed his words and led the army northward. After walking for only two days, I suddenly heard a loud cry from the back of the mountain. Xuande led the pass, and Zhang Zong immediately looked at it from Gaogang, and saw that the Han army was defeated, and the mountains and fields behind him were covered with yellow scarves. Xuande said: ""This is Zhang Jiao! You can fight quickly!"" The three of them flew out with flying horses. Zhang Jiaozheng defeated Dong Zhuo, and he took advantage of the momentum to come, but suddenly three people rushed to kill him, and the Jiao army was in great chaos, losing more than fifty li. The three rescued Dong Zhuo and returned to the village. Zhuo asks what jobs the three of them currently hold. Xuande said: ""white body."" Zhuo took it lightly and did not behave politely. When Xuande came out, Zhang Fei was furious and said, ""I went to the bloody battle to save this fellow, but he is so rude! If I don't kill him, it will be hard to calm me!"" Exactly:","‘With Lu arrested we don’t have anywhere to go except back to Zhuo,’ Guan Yu says. And it is agreed that this is exactly what they will do. It is two days later, back in Zhuo County, that they hear the sounds of a battle nearby. Climbing a hill, they see a host of Yellow Headband rebels overrunning an imperial army. In the midst of the rebels, who are clearly winning, they see a banner declaring the troops are led by ‘Heaven’s Commander’. They know this must be Zhang Jue, in person. ‘Let’s attack!’ cries Xuande, and the three brothers sweep down the hill with their troops, falling upon the rebels. They are just in time, because Zhang Jue is on the point of defeating the imperial commander Dong Zhuo, who has been sent to take Lu Zhi’s place after he was arrested. The battle is long and hard, but eventually Zhang Jue retreats. The three brothers rescue Dong Zhuo and escort him back to their camp. When Dong Zhuo discovers his rescuers are not officers, just ordinary men who have taken command, he dismisses them.","“The government will take the proper course,” said Liu Bei. “You must not act hastily!” And the escort and the three brothers went two ways. It was useless to continue on that road to Guangzong, so Guan Yu proposed to go back to Zhuo, and they retook the road. Two days later they heard the thunder of battle behind some hills. Hastening to the top, they beheld the government soldiers suffering great loss, and they saw the countryside was full of Yellow Scarves. On the rebels' banners were the words “Zhang Jue the Lord of Heaven” written large. “We will attack this Zhang Jue!” said Liu Bei to his brothers, and they galloped out to join in the battle. Zhang Jue had worsted Dong Zhuo and was following up his advantage. He was in hot pursuit when the three brothers dashed into his army, threw his ranks into confusion, and drove him back fifteen miles. Then the brothers returned with the rescued general to his camp. “What offices have you?” asked Dong Zhuo, when he had leisure to speak to the brothers. “None,” replied they. And Dong Zhuo treated them with disrespect. Liu Bei retired calmly, but Zhang Fei was furious. “We have just rescued this menial in a bloody fight,” cried Zhang Fei, “and now he is rude to us!"
次日，玄德送使命回京，就拜表謝恩，並回書與曹操，只言容緩圖之。使命回見曹操，言玄德不殺呂布之事。操問荀彧曰：“此計不成，奈何？”彧曰：“又有一計，名曰‘驅虎吞狼之計’。”操曰：“其計如何？”彧曰：“可暗令人往袁術處通問，報說劉備上密表，要略南郡。術聞之，必怒而攻備，公乃明詔劉備討袁術。兩邊相併，呂布必生異心：此‘驅虎吞狼之計’也。”操大喜，先發人往袁術處；次假天子詔，發人往徐州。,"The next day, when Xuande sent his mission back to Beijing, he thanked him and returned to Cao Cao, speaking slowly. The mission went back to see Cao Cao and said that Xuande would not kill Lu Bu. Cao asked Xun Yu, ""If this plan doesn't work, what can I do?"" Yu said, ""There is another plan, which is called 'the plan of driving tigers and swallowing wolves'."" Cao said, ""What is the plan?"" Yu said, ""You can secretly order it. People went to Yuan Shu to ask questions, and reported that Liu Bei had entered the secret table and wanted to avoid Nanjun. When Shu heard that, he would be angry and attack the defense. The public ordered Liu Bei to challenge Yuan Shu. It's a plan."" Cao was overjoyed, and sent people to Yuan Shu first; the next time the emperor issued an edict, he sent people to Xuzhou.","When Cao Cao is informed by the envoy that Xuande has no intention of killing Lü Bu, Xun Wenruo comes up with another saying. ‘The tiger attacks the wolf. Let Yuan Shu know,’ says Xun Wenruo, ‘that Xuande has secretly asked permission to attack him and seize his district.","Soon the messenger was dismissed and returned to the capital with a the reply from Liu Bei. The letter only said the instruction would take time to plan and implement. But the messenger, when he saw Cao Cao, told him the story of Liu Bei's pledge to Lu Bu. Then said Cao Cao, “The plan has failed; what next?” Xun Yu replied, “I have another trick called 'Tiger against Wolf' in which the tiger is made to gobble up the wolf.” “Let us hear it,” said Cao Cao. “Send to Yuan Shu to say that Liu Bei has sent up a secret memorial to the Throne that he wishes to subdue the southern regions around the Huai River. Yuan Shu will be angry and attack him. Then you will order Liu Bei to dispose of Yuan Shu and so set them destroying each other. Lu Bu will certainly think that is his chance and turn traitor. This is the 'Tiger against Wolf' trick.” Cao Cao thought this good and sent the messenger and also sent a false edict to Liu Bei."

且說操軍緩緩而行，至襄城，到淯水，操忽於馬上放聲大哭。衆驚問其故。操曰：“吾思去年於此地折了吾大將典韋，不由不哭耳！”因卽下令屯住軍馬，大設祭筵，弔奠典韋亡魂。操親自拈香哭拜，三軍無不感歎。祭典韋畢，方祭姪曹安民及長子曹昂，并祭陣亡軍士；連那匹射死的大宛馬，也都致祭。次日，忽荀彧差人報說：“劉表助張繡屯兵安衆，截吾歸路。”操答彧書曰：“吾日行數里，非不知賊來追我；然吾計劃已定，若到安衆，破繡必矣。君等勿疑。”便催軍行至安衆縣界。劉表軍已守險要，張繡隨後引軍趕來。操乃令衆軍黑夜鑿險開道，暗伏奇兵。及天色微明，劉表、張繡軍會合，見操兵少，疑操遁去，俱引兵入險擊之。操縱奇兵出，大破兩家之兵。曹兵出了安衆隘口，於隘外下寨。劉表、張繡各整敗兵相見。表曰：“何期反中曹操奸計！”繡曰：“容再圖之！”於是兩軍集於安衆。,"Let's say that Cao's army was moving slowly, to Xiangcheng, and to Ganshui, and Cao suddenly burst into tears at once. The crowd wondered why. Cao said: ""I think I lost my general Dian Wei here last year, and I can't help but cry!"" Because You ordered the army and horses to be stationed, a sacrificial feast was set up to mourn Dian Wei's dead soul. Cao personally held the incense and cried and worshipped, and the three armies all sighed. In the ceremony for Wei Bi, the party sacrificed his wife Cao Anmin and his eldest son Cao Ang, and sacrificed to the fallen sergeant; even the Dawan horse who was shot to death also sacrificed. The next day, suddenly Xun Yu sent someone to report: ""Liu Biao helped Zhang Xiu to settle the army and cut off my return route."" Cao replied to Yu Shu, ""I traveled several miles a day, and I didn't know that thieves were chasing me; It's fixed, if we reach Anzhong, the embroidery will be broken. Don't be suspicious of you."" He urged the army to march to the border of Anzhong county. Liu Biao's army had already defended the important point, and Zhang Xiu then led the army to come. Cao Nai ordered the army to dig a dangerous road at night and hide the strange soldiers. When the sky was twilight, Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu's army joined together. Seeing that there were few Cao Cao troops, they suspected that Cao Cao had escaped, and they all brought in their troops to attack them. Manipulate the strange soldiers to break out the two soldiers. Cao's soldiers went out of the Anzhong pass and settled down outside the pass. Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu met their defeated soldiers. The table said: ""When are you going to oppose Cao Cao's treacherous plan!"" Embroidery said: ""Rong is going to plot it again!"" So the two armies gathered in Anzhong.","From then on there is a vicious game of cat and mouse as Zhang Xiu and Liu Biao track Cao Cao’s retreating army, attacking whenever they can.","In the meantime Cao Cao's army, marching very leisurely, had arrived at Xiangyang. Walking one day beside River Yu, he suddenly uttered a great cry, and when his officers asked the reason thereof he replied, “I remembered that here, only a year ago, I lost my great general: Dian Wei. Is that not a reason to grieve?” Thereupon Cao Cao gave orders to halt while he should make a great sacrifice and mourn for his lost leader. At the ceremony he himself burned incense and wailed and prostrated himself. The army was much affected by his devotion. After the sacrifices to the lost hero, he sacrificed to the names of his nephew Cao Amin and his eldest son Cao Ang, both of whom had died at the same time. He also sacrificed to his lost soldiers and even to his Dawan steed which had been killed by an arrow. Next day Xun Yu wrote to tell Cao Cao that Liu Biao had gone to help Zhang Xiu and was camped at Anzhong, thereby cutting his road of retreat. Cao Cao replied to the letter, saying, “I have been marching only a short distance each day and of course knew of the pursuit. But my plans are laid and, as I am near Anzhong, my enemy will be broken. You need not have any fears.” Then Cao Cao hastened his march till he came near where Liu Biao had taken position. Zhang Xiu still shortened the distance. Cao Cao ordered his men during the night to open a secret way through a pass, where he laid an ambush. With the first light of dawn Liu Biao and Zhang Xiu met. As Cao Cao's force looked small, they thought he had retired so they boldly advanced into the pass to smite him. Then the ambush was opened and both the attackers' forces were cut up. The fighting ended; Cao Cao's soldiers went outside the pass and encamped. The two leaders on the other side restored order among their beaten troops and then held a conference. “How could we have foreseen such a wicked ruse?” said Liu Biao. “Let us try again,” said Zhang Xiu. Wherefore they joined forces at Anzhong."

却說曹仁與李典回許都，見曹操，泣拜於地請罪，具言損將折兵之事。操曰：“勝負乃軍家之常。但不知誰為劉備畫策？”曹仁言是單福之計。操曰：“單福何人也？”程昱笑曰：“此非單福也：此人幼好學擊劍；中平末年，嘗為人報讎殺人，披髮塗面而走，為吏所獲；問其姓名不答，吏乃縳於車上，擊鼓行於市，令市人識之，雖有識者不敢言；而同伴竊解救之，乃更姓名而逃，折節向學，遍訪名師；嘗與司馬徽談論。此人乃潁川徐庶，字元直：單福乃其託名耳。”操曰：“徐庶之才，比君何如？”昱曰：“十倍於昱。”操曰：“惜乎賢士歸於劉備！羽翼成矣！奈何？”昱曰：“徐庶雖在彼，丞相要用，召來不難。”操曰：“安得彼來歸？”昱曰：“徐庶為人至孝。幼喪其父，止有老母在堂。現今其弟徐康已亡，老母無人侍養。丞相可使人賺其母至許昌，令作書召其子，則徐庶必至矣。”,"But they said that Cao Ren and Li Dian returned to Xudu, saw Cao Cao, and wept and bowed to the ground to plead guilty, and said that they had lost their generals and lost their troops. Cao said: ""Winning or losing is the norm of the military family. But I don't know who is planning for Liu Bei?"" Cao Renyan was a plan of Shanfu. Cao said: ""Who is Shan Fu?"" Cheng Yu laughed and said, ""This is not Shan Fu: this person likes to learn fencing at a young age; in the last years of Zhongping, he tried to report for people to kill people, and walked away with his hair and face covered, and he was taken by officials. When asked about his name but did not answer, the officials were tied to the car, beat drums and walked in the city, so that the people of the city knew about him, although those who knew did not dare to speak; and his companions stole his rescue, he changed his name and ran away, breaking down to learn, all over the place. Visit a famous teacher; try to talk with Sima Hui. This person is Xu Shu of Yingchuan, and his character is Yuanzhi: Shan Fu is his name."" Cao said: ""Xu Shu's talent is better than yours?"" Yu said: ""Ten times Yu Yu. ""Cao said: ""It's a pity that the wise men are returned to Liu Bei! The wings are completed! What can I do?"" Yu said: ""Although Xu Shu is there, the prime minister will use it, so it is not difficult to summon him."" ""Xu Shu is the most filial man. He lost his father when he was young, and only has his old mother in the hall. Now his younger brother Xu Kang has died, and his old mother has no one to care for. The prime minister can make people earn his mother to Xuchang, and make Zuoshu call his son, then Xu Shu will surely come. That's it.""","When Cao Cao decides to attack Xuande and sends his cousin Cao Ren to oversee taking Xinye and capturing Xuande, it is Shan Fu whose advice Xuande follows.","In the meantime Cao Cao's defeated generals had gone back. When they saw the Prime Minister, Cao Ren threw himself on the ground weeping and acknowledging his faults. He told the tale of his losses. “The fortune of war,” said Cao Cao. “But I should like to know who laid Liu Bei's plans.” “That was San Fu,” said Cao Ren. “Who is he?” asked Cao Cao. Cheng Yu said, “The man is not San Fu. When young this man was fond of fencing and used to take up the quarrels of other men and avenge their wrongs. At the end of Emperor Ling, he killed a man to avenge his friend, and then he let down his hair, muddled his face, and was trying to escape when a lictor caught him and questioned him. He would not reply. So they carted him through the streets beating a drum and asking if any one recognized him. Nobody dared own to knowing him, if they did so. However, his comrades managed to release him secretly, and he ran away under some other name. Then he turned to study and wandered hither and thither wherever scholars were to be found. He was a regular disputant with Sima Hui. His real name is Xu Shu and he comes from Yingchuan. San Fu is merely an assumed name.” “How does he compare with yourself'“ asked Cao Cao. “Ten times cleverer.” “It is a pity. If able people gather to Liu Bei, his wings will soon grow. What is to be done?” “Xu Shu is there now; but if you wanted him, it would not be difficult to call him,” replied Cheng Yu. “How could I make him come?” said Cao Cao. “He is noted for his affection for his mother. His father died young, leaving his mother a widow with one other son. Now that son is dead, and his mother, Lady Xun, has no one to care for her. If you sent and got his mother here and told her to write and summon her son, he would surely come.”"

玄德待其歌罷，上草堂施禮曰：“備久慕先生，無緣拜會。昨因徐元直稱薦，敬至仙莊，不遇空回。今特冒風雪而來，得瞻道貌，實為萬幸！”那少年慌忙答禮曰：“將軍莫非劉豫州，欲見家兄否？”玄德驚訝曰：“先生又非臥龍耶？”少年曰：“某乃臥龍之弟諸葛均也。愚兄弟三人：長兄諸葛瑾，現在江東孫仲謀處為幕賓。孔明乃二家兄。”玄德曰：“臥龍今在家否？”均曰：“昨為崔州平相約，出外閒遊去矣。”玄德曰：“何處閒遊？”均曰：“或駕小舟游於江湖之中；或訪僧道於山嶺之上；或尋朋友於村落之間；或樂琴棋於洞府之內：往來莫測，不知去所。”玄德曰：“劉備直如此緣分淺薄，兩番不遇大賢！”均曰：“少坐獻茶。”張飛曰：“那先生旣不在，請哥哥上馬。”玄德曰：“我旣到此間，如何無一語而回？”因問諸葛均曰：“聞令兄臥龍先生熟諳韜略，日看兵書，可得聞乎？”均曰：“不知。”張飛曰：“問他則甚！風雪甚緊，不如早歸。”玄德叱止之。均曰：“家兄不在，不敢久留車騎；容日却來回禮。”玄德曰：“豈敢望先生枉駕。數日之後，備當再至。願借紙筆作一書，留達令兄，以表劉備慇懃之意。”均遂進文房四寶。玄德呵開凍筆，拂展雲箋，寫書曰：,"After Xuande waited for his song, he went to the thatched cottage and said: ""Mr. Bei Jiumu, I have no chance to meet.

The young man hurriedly replied, ""Could it be that the general is Liu Yuzhou, do you want to see my brother?"" Xuande was surprised and said, ""Sir, isn't it Wolong?"" The young man said, ""A certain is Wolong's younger brother Zhuge Jun. People: The eldest brother, Zhuge Jin, is now the guest of the curtain at Sun Zhongmou's office in Jiangdong. Kong Ming is the brother of the second family."" Xuande said, ""Is Wolong at home now?"" Both said, ""I made an appointment with Cui Zhouping yesterday, and I went out for a leisure trip."" Xuande said. : ""Where to travel?"" They all said: ""Or driving a boat to swim in the rivers and lakes; or visiting monks and roads on the mountains; or looking for friends among villages; or playing qin and chess in the cave: unpredictable exchanges. I don’t know where to go.” Xuande said, “Liu Beizhi has such a superficial fate that he has never met a great sage twice!” Jun said, “Sit down and offer tea.” Zhang Fei said, “That gentleman is not here, please come on the horse.” Xuan De said: ""How can I come back here without saying a word?"" Because he asked Zhuge Jun, ""I heard that my brother, Mr. Wolong, is well versed in tactics and reading military books every day. Can you hear it?"" Jun said: ""I don't know."" Zhang Fei Said: ""Ask him and it's very hard! The wind and snow are very tight, it's better to return early."" Xuande stopped him. Jun said: ""My brother is not here, I don't dare to stay for a long time; Rongri goes back and forth to pay respects."" Xuande said, ""How dare I hope that Mr. will drive in vain. After a few days, I will come again. I would like to borrow pen and paper to write a book, and stay here. My brother, to show Liu Bei's diligence."" He then entered the Four Treasures of the Study. Xuande opened the frozen pen, flicked the cloud paper, and wrote:","Humbled, Xuande says, ‘Then just say to the master that Xuande came calling.’ ‘He went away this morning,’ replies the young man. ‘When do you expect him back?’ ‘Who knows? Maybe in three days or maybe five days,’ he says. ‘Or possibly ten.’ Xuande is deeply disappointed and asks the young man to tell Master Sleeping Dragon that Xuande has called and, mounting his horse, he rides off. But before he leaves this peaceful scene completely, he turns back to look at it once more. The little hut in the wood; the hills, small but delightful; the streams modest but as clear as crystal; the landscape not grand but graceful and flowing; and the woods likewise simple, but glorious. Here, he thinks, all creatures live in harmony. It is a scene of perfect peace. Then Xuande sees a man walking down towards them and riding up asks if this man might be Master Sleeping Dragon? He is not. But while he is not Master Sleeping Dragon, it turns out he is a friend of the master. He is Cui Zhou Ping and naturally he asks who Xuande is and why he wants to see the master. After Xuande introduces himself, he tells the stranger that he wants to seek the help of Master Sleeping Dragon because the empire is torn apart by trouble and he wishes to bring peace and order to the land. ‘You’re a thoughtful and kind man,’ says Cui Zhou Ping, ‘seeking to bring peace and order to the land, but let’s be frank. Ever since time began, the world has swung between order and chaos. Just think,’ he adds. ‘Ever since the uprising which overthrew the evil Qin dynasty and the Han dynasty emerged, it has been order replacing chaos. For two hundred years all was well until Wang Mang rebelled, and the world descended into chaos.","His books and his lute to leave and roam. As the song ended Liu Bei advanced and saluted, saying, “Master, long have I yearned for you, but have found it impossible to salute you. Lately Water-Mirror spoke of you and I hastened to your dwelling, only to come away disappointed. This time I have braved the elements and come again and my reward is here; I see your face, and I am indeed fortunate.” The young man hastily returned the salute and said, “General, you must be that Liu Bei of Yuzhou who wishes to see my brother.” “Then, Master, you are not Sleeping-Dragon!” said Liu Bei, starting back. “I am his younger brother, Zhuge Jun. He has another elder brother, Zhuge Jin, now with Sun Quan in the South Land as a counselor. Zhuge Liang is the second of our family.” “Is your brother at home?” “Only yesterday he arranged to go a jaunt with Cui Zhouping.” “Whither have they gone?” “Who can say? They may take a boat and sail away among the lakes, or go to gossip with the priests in some remote mountain temple, or wander off to visit a friend in some far away village, or be sitting in some cave with a lute or a chessboard. Their goings and comings are uncertain and nobody can guess at them.” “What very poor luck have I! Twice have I failed to meet the great sage.” “Pray sit a few moments and let me offer you some tea.” “Brother, since the master is not here, I pray you remount and go,” said Zhang Fei. “Since I am here, why not a little talk before we go home again.” said Liu Bei. Then turning to his host he continued, “Can you tell me if your worthy brother is skilled in strategy and studies works on war?” “I do not know.” “This is worse than the other,” grumbled Zhang Fei. “And the wind and snow are getting worse; we ought to go back.” Liu Bei turned on him angrily and told him to stop. Zhuge Jun said, “Since my brother is absent, I will not presume to detain you longer. I will return your call soon.” “Please do not take that trouble. In a few days I will come again. But if I could borrow paper and ink, I would leave a note to show your worthy brother that I am zealous and earnest.” Zhuge Jun produced the “four treasures” of the scholar, and Liu Bei, thawing out the frozen brush between his lips, spread the sheet of delicate note-paper and wrote: “Liu Bei has long admired your fame. He has visited your dwelling twice, but to his great regret he has gone empty away."
董卓卽日下令還郿塢，百官俱拜送。貂蟬在車上，遙見呂布於稠人之內，眼望車中。貂蟬虛掩其面，如痛哭之狀。車已去遠，布緩轡於土岡之上，眼望車塵，歎惜痛恨。忽聞背後一人問曰：“温侯何不從太師去，乃在此遙望而發歎？”布視之，乃司徒王允也。,"Dong Zhuo ordered the return to Piwu on the day of the day, and all officials paid their respects. Diaochan was in the car and saw Lü Bu in the crowd, looking at the car. Diaochan concealed her face, as if crying bitterly. The car has gone far, and the cloth is slow to bridle on the soil hill, looking at the car dust, sighing and resenting. Suddenly, someone behind the hearing asked, ""Why didn't Marquis Wen go from Taishi, but here he looked in the distance and sighed?"" Bu looked at it, and it was Situ Wang Yun.","That victory was won. As the cavalcade is getting ready to depart for Meiwu, Diao Chan spots Lü Bu. Immediately she casts her eyes down, and sadness seems to overwhelm her. As he watches her carriage disappear over the hill, Lü Bu is in the depths of despair. Suddenly a voice asks, ‘Why aren’t you going as well instead of staying here sighing?’ Looking around, he sees it is Wang Yun, who says, ‘I have been ill for a few days but am feeling better now.","The order was given to journey to Meiwo, and the whole body of officers assembled to add luster to the start. Diao Chan, from her carriage, saw Lu Bu among the crowd. She at once dropped her eyes and assumed an appearance of deepest melancholy. After the cavalcade started and when her carriage had almost disappeared in the distance, the disappointed lover reined in his steed on a mount whence he could watch the dust that rose around it. Unutterable sadness filled his heart. Suddenly a voice said, “Why do you not accompany the Prime Minister, General, instead of standing here and sighing?” It was Wang Yun."

言未畢，一聲礮響，兩邊五百校刀手擺開，為首大將關雲長，提靑龍刀，跨赤兔馬，截住去路。操軍見了，亡魂喪膽，面面相覷。操曰：“旣到此處，只得決一死戰！”衆將曰：“人縱然不怯，馬力已乏，安能復戰？”程昱曰：“某素知雲長傲上而不忍下，欺強而不凌弱；恩怨分明，信義素著。丞相舊日有恩於彼，今只親自告之，可脫此難。”操從其說，卽縱馬向前，欠身謂雲長曰：“將軍別來無恙！”雲長亦久身答曰：“關某奉軍師將令，等候丞相多時。”操曰：“曹操兵敗勢危，到此無路，望將軍以昔日之情為重。”雲長曰：“昔日關某雖蒙丞相厚恩，然已斬顏良，誅文醜，解白馬之危，以奉報矣。今日之事，豈敢以私廢公？”操曰：“五關斬將之時，還能記否？大丈夫以信義為重。將軍深明《春秋》，豈不知庾公之斯追子濯孺子之事乎？”雲長是個義重如山之人，想起當日曹操許多恩義，與後來五關斬將之事，如何不動心？又見曹軍惶惶皆欲垂淚，一發心中不忍。於是把馬頭勒回，謂衆軍曰：“四散擺開。”這個分明是放曹操的意思。操見雲長回馬，便和衆將一齊衝將過去。雲長回身時，曹操已與衆將過去了。雲長大喝一聲，衆軍皆下馬，哭拜於地。雲長愈加不忍。正猶豫間，張遼驟馬而至。雲長見了，又動故舊之情；長歎一聲，並皆放去。後人有詩曰：,"Before the words were finished, there was a sound, and the five hundred school swordsmen on both sides spread out, and the chief general, Guan Yunchang, carried the dragon sword, crossed the red rabbit horse, and blocked the way. When Cao Jun saw it, the souls of the dead were frightened and looked at each other in dismay. Cao said: ""When I get here, I have to fight to the death!"" The generals said: ""Even if people are not afraid, but their horsepower has been exhausted, can they be able to resume the battle?"" Cheng Yu said: ""A certain Su Zhiyun is arrogant and can't bear to go down. The strong do not bully the weak; the grievances are clear, and the faith is always true. The prime minister used to be kind to him, but now I only tell him personally, and I can get rid of this difficulty."" Cao Congqi said, steered his horse forward, bowed his body and said to Yun Chang: "" Don't come and be safe, General!"" Yun Chang also replied for a long time: ""Guan has been ordered by the military commander and has been waiting for the Prime Minister for a long time."" Cao said: ""Cao Cao's army is in danger of being defeated, and there is no way to go here. Yun Chang said: ""In the past, although Guan was generously favored by the prime minister, he has already beheaded Yan Liang, executed Wen Chou, solved the danger of the white horse, and paid for it. Today's affairs, how dare you abolish the public for private purposes?"" Cao said: ""Five Guan When the general was beheaded, can you still remember it? The man puts his faith as the most important thing. The general knows the Spring and Autumn Annals well, and does he not know about Yu Gongzhi’s pursuit of his son Zhuoru’s son?” Yunchang is a person whose righteousness is as heavy as a mountain. How can you not be distracted by the five-level slaying of the generals? Seeing that Cao Jun was so frightened that he wanted to cry, he couldn't bear it. So he pulled the horse's head back, and said to the army: ""Scatter and spread out."" This clearly meant Cao Cao's release. When Cao saw Yun Chang returning to his horse, he rushed over with all the generals. When Yun Chang turned around, Cao Cao had already passed by with the generals. Yun Changchang shouted, and all the troops dismounted and cried and worshipped the ground. The cloud grows more and more unbearable. While hesitating, Zhang Liao suddenly came. When Yun Chang met, he moved his old feelings again; he let out a long sigh and let them all go. A later poem says:","Suddenly the air is rent with explosions, and five hundred swordsmen block the road. At their head, wielding his Green Dragon sword and mounted upon Red Hare, is Guan Yu. Utter despair sweeps over Cao Cao’s men, and Cao Cao says with a sigh, ‘So this is it. The last battle.’ But his officers say the men are not able to fight. Then Cheng Yu says, ‘Look, Guan Yu is famous for his virtue, noble to the weak and hard on the strong. He understands the difference between duty and anger. He is renowned for his righteousness and honour. You, my lord, showed him such kindness in the past. If you make a personal appeal, we might be saved.’ Cao Cao sees the wisdom of this and, riding slowly forward, head bowed in deference, he addresses Guan Yu. ‘I hope you have been well,’ says Cao Cao, ‘since we last met.’ Bowing, Guan Yu says, ‘I’ve orders from my commander and have waited long for you to come.’ ‘I come before you today,’ says Cao Cao, ‘a beaten man and with a beaten army. I’ve nowhere to go, but I hope, sir, that in honour of our past friendship you’ll think kindly of me.’ ‘It is true that you were kind in the past, but I repaid that by killing the two enemy commanders and relieving the siege at Baima. Today I must not set aside my duty for purely personal reasons.’ But Cao Cao has a clever answer. ‘Have you forgotten that you killed my own officers at the five passes as you escaped? A truly great man considers both righteousness and honour, as our ancient texts tell us. Remember the story of the student Yugong, who was sent to hunt down his erstwhile master, Zizhuo Ruzi. He let him go, unable to use what he had learned from his master to destroy the same man!’ And this touches Guan Yu. He cannot lightly dismiss Cao Cao’s past kindnesses or the fact of the deaths of the officers at the passes. Looking upon the terrible state of Cao Cao and his men, his heart is moved by pity. ‘Spread out along the road,’ he commands his troop, turning his horse away from Cao Cao as he speaks. Seizing their opportunity, Cao Cao and his officers dash through the gap created and ride off into the distance. Guan Yu turns back and addresses the remainder of Cao Cao’s men. He roars at them, and they fall to the ground. But Guan Yu’s heart is touched once again and when his old friend Zhang Liao rides forward Guan Yu relents and lets every man go free. Cao Cao, defeated, retreats to Huarong","If an ambush had been placed here, we should all be prisoners.” Cao Cao had not finished this speech when the explosion of a bomb broke the silence, and a company of five hundred troops with swords in their hands appeared and barred the way. The leader was Guan Yu, holding his green-dragon saber, bestriding the Red-Hare. At this sight, the spirits of Cao Cao's soldiers left them, and they gazed into each others' faces in panic. “Now we have but one course;” said Cao Cao, “we must fight to the death.” “How can we?” said the officers. “Though the leaders are not scared, the horses are spent.” Cheng Yu said, “I have always heard that Guan Yu is haughty to the proud but kindly to the humble; he despises the strong, but is gentle with the weak. He discriminates between love and hate and is always righteous and true. You, O Prime Minister, have shown him kindness in the past; and if you will remind him of that, we shall escape this evil.” Cao Cao agreed to try. He rode out to the front, bowed low and said, “General, I trust you have enjoyed good health.” “I had orders to await you, O Prime Minister,” replied Guan Yu, bowing in return, “and I have been expecting you these many days.” “You see before you Cao Cao, defeated and weak. I have reached a sad pass, and I trust you, O General, will not forget the kindness of former days.” “Though indeed you were kind to me in those days, yet I slew your enemies for you and relieved the siege of Baima. As to the business of today, I cannot allow private feelings to outweigh public duty.” “Do you remember my six generals, slain at the five passes? The noble person values righteousness. You are well versed in the histories and must recall the action of Yu Gong, the archer, when he released his master Zi Zhuo, for he determined not to use Zi's teaching to kill Zi.” Guan Yu was indeed a very mountain of goodness and could not forget the great kindness he had received at Cao Cao's hands, and the magnanimity Cao Cao had shown over the deeds at the five passes. He saw the desperate straits to which his benefactor was reduced, and tears were very near to the eyes of both. He could not press Cao Cao hard. He pulled at the bridle of his steed and turned away saying to his followers, “Break up the formation!” From this it was evident that his design was to release Cao Cao, who then went on with his officers; and when Guan Yu turned to look back, they had all passed. He uttered a great shout and Cao Cao's soldiers jumped off their horses and knelt on the ground crying for mercy. But he also had pity for them. Then Zhang Liao, whom he knew well, came along and was allowed to go free also. Cao Cao, his army lost, fled to the Huarong Valley; There in the throat of the gorge met he Guan Yu."

少頃，有人入帳，於操耳邊私語。操曰：“將書來看。”其人以密書呈上。操觀之，顏色頗喜。闞澤暗思：“此必蔡中、蔡和來報黃蓋受刑消息，操故喜我投降之事為眞實也。”操曰：“煩先生再回江東，與黃公覆約定，先通消息過江，吾以兵接應。”澤曰：“某已離江東，不可復還。望丞相別遣機密人去。”操曰：“若他人去，事恐泄漏。”澤再三推辭；良久，乃曰：“若去則不敢久停，便當行矣。”,"After a while, someone entered the account and whispered in Yu Cao's ear. Cao said, ""Look at the book."" The man presented it in a secret book. Looking at it, the color is quite pleasing. Kan Ze thought to himself: ""This must be Cai Zhong and Cai He to report the news of Huang Gai's torture, so Cao is so happy that I surrender is the truth."" Cao said: ""Mr. Fan will return to Jiangdong again, and make an agreement with Huang Gai to communicate first. When the news crosses the river, I will respond with soldiers.” Ze said: “Someone has left Jiangdong and cannot be returned. I hope the prime minister will not send secret people to go.” Cao said: “If others go, the matter may leak.” Ze repeatedly refused; Then he said: ""If you go, you don't dare to stop for a long time, you should do it.""","It is at this point that a messenger comes in and whispers in Cao Cao’s ear. It is clear to Kan Ze that this must be the report from Cao Cao’s two spies, the Cais, that will confirm Huang’s letter. And so it is, finally convincing Cao Cao of the sincerity of Huang’s letter. However, somewhat to Kan Ze’s consternation, Cao Cao asks him to return to the south in order to finalize the practical arrangements for Huang Gai’s desertion.","While they were drinking, some one came in and whispered in Cao Cao's ear. He replied, “Let me see the letter.” Whereupon the man pulled out and gave him a letter, which evidently pleased him. “That is from the two Cai brothers,” thought Kan Ze. “They are reporting the punishment of my friend, and that will be a proof of the sincerity of his letter.” Turning toward Kan Ze, Cao Cao said, “I must ask you to return to settle the date with your friend; as soon as I know, I will have a force waiting.” “I cannot return; pray, Sir, send some other one you can trust.” “If some one else should go, the secret would be discovered.” Kan Ze refused again and again but at last gave way, saying, “If I am to go, I must not wait here; I must be off at once.”"

Yu said: ""Liu Qi is young, how could he have him die? When will this Jingzhou be returned?"" Su said, ""Don't worry, the governor: It is only on Lu Su, and we must ask Jingxiang to return to Dongwu."" Yu said: ""What is Zijing's high opinion?"" Su said, ""I think Liu Qi is too drunk, and he is terminally ill. Seeing that he looks thin and thin, he is panting and vomiting blood; within half a year, he will die. At that time, when he went to Jingzhou, Liu Bei must have no excuses."" Zhou Yu's anger still remained undisturbed when Sun Quan sent an envoy. Yu order please come in. The envoy said: ""My lord is encircling Hefei, and the battle is not successful. I specially ordered the governor to withdraw the army and send troops to Hefei to help."" Zhou Yu had to go back to Chaisang to recuperate. Sun Quan called.","‘Indeed, you are probably right,’ says Kong Ming and then to celebrate this understanding he orders a banquet to be prepared. When later that night Lu Su reports back to Zhou Yu, his master is far from impressed. ‘But surely,’ says Zhou Yu, ‘Liu Qi is but a youth with many, many years to live?’ ‘Believe me,’ says Lu Su, ‘if you’d met him you’d have seen how his dissolute lifestyle, women and drink, has sapped his qi. He looks weak and wasted. His breathing is laboured. I give him six months at the most. Once he is dead, I’ll go and claim Jingzhou by rights, for Xuande will have no excuses left!’ Zhou Yu is still troubled, but this is soon put into context, for a messenger comes announcing that Sun Quan is besieging Hefei and requests more troops. After his collapse Zhou Yu needs to rest and recover in Chaisang, so he sends Cheng Pu to the aid of Sun Quan at Hefei.","Then a banquet was prepared and, that over, Lu Su took his leave. He hastened back to his own camp and gave Zhou Yu an account of his mission. “But what is there for us in the chance of Liu Qi's death?” said Zhou Yu. “He is in his very first youth. When will these places fall to us?” “Rest content, General; let me guarantee the return of these places.” “But how can you?” asked Zhou Yu. “Liu Qi has indulged too freely in wine and women; he is a wreck and rotten to the core, miserably emaciated and panting for breath. I will not give him half a year's life. Then I will go to Liu Bei, and he will be unable to deny the request.” But Zhou Yu was still unmollified. Suddenly came a messenger from Sun Quan, who said, “Our lord is laying siege to Hefei but in several battles has had no victory. He now orders you to withdraw from here and go to Hefei to help him.” Thereupon Zhou Yu marched back to Chaisang. Having reached home, he began to give attention to the recovery of his health. He sent Cheng Pu with the marine and land forces to Hefei ready for Sun Quan's call."

正說間，忽城中軍士來報：“城南門外有十數騎來的甚緊，不知是甚人。”張飛心中疑慮，便轉出南門看時，果見十數騎輕弓短箭而來。見了張飛，滾鞍下馬。視之，乃糜竺、糜芳也。飛亦下馬相見。竺曰：“自徐州失散，我兄弟二人逃難回鄕。使人遠近打聽，知雲長降了曹操，主公在於河北；又聞簡雍亦投河北去了。只不知將軍在此。昨於路上遇見一夥客人說：‘有一姓張的將軍，如此模樣，今據古城。’我兄弟度量必是將軍，故來尋訪。幸得相見！”飛曰：“雲長兄與孫乾送二嫂方到，已知哥哥下落。”二糜大喜，同來見關公，并參見二夫人。飛遂迎請二嫂入城。至衙中坐定，二夫人訴說關公歷過之事，張飛方纔大哭，參拜雲長。二糜亦俱傷感。張飛亦自訴別後之事，一面設宴賀喜。,"While he was talking, suddenly a sergeant in the city came to report: ""There are dozens of horsemen outside the south gate of the city. I don't know who they are."" Zhang Fei had doubts in his heart, and when he turned out of the south gate to look, he saw a dozen horses with light bows and short arrows. Come. Seeing Zhang Fei, he got off the saddle. According to them, it is Mi Zhu and Mi Fang. Fei also dismounted to meet. Zhu said: ""Since we were separated from Xuzhou, my two brothers fled and returned to Yan. I asked people from far and near to know that Yunchang had surrendered to Cao Cao, and the lord was in Hebei; I heard that Jian Yong also went to Hebei. I didn't know that the general was here. Yesterday on the road. I met a group of guests and said: 'There is a general surnamed Zhang, who looks like this, and it is in the ancient city.' My brother must be a general, so I came to look for it. Fortunately, I met each other!"" Fei said: ""Eldest brother Yun and Sun Qian sent the second sister-in-law. Fang Dao, the whereabouts of my brother are known."" Er Mi was overjoyed, and came to see Guan Gong and Er Madam at the same time. Feisui invited the second sister-in-law into the city. When they sat down in the yazhong, the second lady told Guan Gong's calendar, and Zhang Fei burst into tears and went to pay homage to Yunchang. Both Mi are also sad. Zhang Fei also told himself what happened after the farewell, and held a banquet to congratulate him.","Together, they all enter the city. They spend the day celebrating and telling each other of their adventures and exploits since they were last together. It is then decided that Guan Yu and Sun Qian will travel to Runan to see Xuande. Meanwhile, Zhang Fei will stay in the city and look after the two ladies. However, when Guan Yu and Sun Qian arrive at Runan it is only to find Xuande has left sometime ago. He has gone back to consult with Yuan Shao. So they return disappointed to Gucheng. It is agreed once again that Guan Yu and Sun Qian should go to find Xuande while Zhang Fei guards the city and the ladies.","Just then messengers came from the city to Zhang Fei to say: “Some scores of horsemen has arrived at the south gate. They seem in a great hurry but no one know them.” Zhang Fei, with still a lingering doubt in his mind, went to look at the newcomers and there saw some forty mounted archers with light bows and short arrows. Hastily dismounting to see them better, he found they were Mi Zhu and Mi Fang. Quickly slipping out of the saddle, they came up and Mi Zhu said, “After the dispersal at Xuzhou when we lost sight of you, we returned to our village whence we sent all around for news of you. We heard that Guan Yu had surrendered to Cao Cao and our lord was in the North of Yellow River with Yuan Shao. The one of whom we could hear nothing was yourself. But yesterday, while on our way, we fell in with some travelers who told us a certain General Zhang Fei, of such and such an appearance, had suddenly occupied Gucheng, and we felt it must be you. So we came to inquire, and we happily fell in with you here.” Zhang Fei replied, “Guan Yu and Sun Qian are here, and my two sisters are with them. They had heard where my elder brother was.” This news added to the joy of the two newcomers who went to see Guan Yu and the women, and then they all entered the city, When the ladies had settled down a little, they related the whole story of the adventures on the road at which Zhang Fei was overcome with remorse and bowed before his brother bitterly weeping. Mi Zhu and Mi Fang were greatly affected. Then Zhang Fei related what had happened to him."
