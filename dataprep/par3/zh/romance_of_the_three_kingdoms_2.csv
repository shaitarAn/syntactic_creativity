孤與丞相，彼此皆漢朝臣宰。丞相不思報國安民，乃妄動干戈，殘虐生靈，豈仁人之所為哉？卽日春水方生，公當速去。如其不然，復有赤壁之禍矣：公宜自思焉。,"The solitary and the prime minister were both ministers of the Han Dynasty. The prime minister did not intend to serve the country and the people, but instead acted rashly and cruelly abused living beings. The water is born in the spring, and the public should go quickly. If not, there will be the disaster of Chibi again: Gong should think for himself.","Sun Quan and his advisers are triumphant and start to think that now is the time, with Xuande still away and a victorious army, to seize Jingzhou.","“You and I, O Prime Minister, are both servants of Han, but you are careless for the tranquillity of the people and think only of battle, thereby causing great suffering. Is this conduct worthy of a kindly person? “But spring with its heavy rains is at hand, and you would be wise to retire while you can. If not, you may expect a repetition of the misfortune at the Red Cliffs. It would be well to consider this.”"
操進兵直叩潼關，曹仁曰：“可先下定寨柵，然後打關未遲。”操令砍伐樹木，起立排柵，分作三寨：左寨曹仁，右寨夏侯淵，操自居中寨。次日，操引三寨大小將校，殺奔關隘前去，正遇西涼軍馬。兩邊各布陣勢。操出馬於門旗下，看西涼之兵，人人勇健，個個英雄，又見馬超生得面如傅粉，辱若抹硃；腰細膀寬，聲雄力猛；白袍銀鎧，手執長鎗，立馬陣前；上首龐德，下首馬岱。操暗暗稱奇，自縱馬謂超曰：“汝乃漢朝名將子孫，何故背反耶？”超咬牙切齒，大罵：“操賊！欺君罔上，罪不容誅！害我父弟，不共戴天之讎！吾當活捉生啖汝肉！”說罷，挺鎗直殺過來。曹操背後于禁出迎。兩馬交戰，鬥得八九合，于禁敗走。張郃出迎，戰二十合亦敗走。李通出迎，超奮威交戰，數合之中，一鎗刺李通於馬下。超把鎗望後一招，西涼兵一齊衝殺過來。操兵大敗。西涼兵來得勢猛，左右將佐，皆抵當不住。馬超、龐德、馬岱引百餘騎，直入中軍來捉曹操。操在亂軍中，只聽得西涼軍大叫：“穿紅袍的是曹操！”操就馬上急脫下紅袍。又聽得大叫：“長髯者是曹操！”操驚慌，掣所佩刀斷其髯。軍中有人將曹操割髯之事，告知馬超，超遂令人叫拏：“短髯者是曹操！”操聞知，卽扯旗角包頸而逃。後人有詩曰：,"When Cao entered the army and knocked on Tong Pass, Cao Ren said, ""You can first get down to the gate, and then it's not too late."" The next day, Cao led the large and small generals from Sanzhai, and rushed to the pass, where he encountered the troops of Xiliang. Formation on both sides. Caught the horses under the banner of the gate, and saw the soldiers of Xiliang, everyone was brave and strong, all heroes, and also saw that Ma Chao was born with a face like powdered powder, and humiliated like a rubble; his waist was thin and his shoulders were broad, and his voice was strong; The spear, immediately before the battle; the first Pound, the next Ma Dai. Cao was secretly amazed, and he took the horse and said to Chao: ""You are a descendant of a famous general of the Han Dynasty, why do you turn your back on it?"" Chao gritted his teeth and cursed: ""Fuck the thief! It's not a crime to deceive the king! Harm my father and brother. Dai Tianzhi! I'll catch you alive and eat your flesh!"" After saying that, he shot straight at him. Behind Cao Cao, Yu Jin went out to greet him. The two horses fought, and the fight was eight or nine, and Yu Jin was defeated. Zhang He went out to meet him, but he was also defeated in the battle of Twenty-height. Li Tong came out to greet him, and fought with great enthusiasm. In the middle of the number, he stabbed Li Tong with a single shot. Chao looked back at the gun, and the Xiliang soldiers rushed over together. Cao Cao defeated. The soldiers of the Western Liang Dynasty were so powerful that they could not stand up to the generals left and right. Ma Chao, Pang De, and Ma Dai led more than a hundred cavalry into the Chinese army to capture Cao Cao. Cao was in the midst of the chaotic army, only to hear the Xiliang army shout: ""It's Cao Cao who wears the red robe!"" Cao immediately took off the red robe in a hurry. He heard a loud cry: ""The one with the long beard is Cao Cao!"" Cao panicked, and the sword he wore cut off his beard. Someone in the army told Ma Chao about Cao Cao's beard cutting, and Chao was called to take: ""The one with the short beard is Cao Cao!"" A later poem says:","Cao Cao now sets off for the pass and establishes his camp below, ready for battle. The very next day the armies clash, and the Xiliang troops break the northern army almost immediately, with Ma Chao and Pang De charging into the mêlée, determined to capture Cao Cao. In terror Cao Cao turns and flees but he hears behind him someone cry, ‘Cao is the one in the red robe’, and on hearing this he rips it off and casts it aside. Then he hears a cry, ‘Cao is the one with the long beard!’","Cao Cao advanced to Tong Pass. Cao Ren said, “We should establish a strong stockade before attacking.” So trees were felled and a strong stockade built. They made three camps: Cao Ren was in the left; Xiahou Yuan, the right; and Cao Cao himself was in the center one. Soon after, Cao Cao and all his officers in a body rushed to attack the Pass. They ran against the Xiliang troops posted on two sides, halted and formed their array. This done, Cao Cao rode to the center standard whence he looked at his opponents. He saw before him a body of fine troops, every one with the bearing of a hero. And the leader, Ma Chao, was worthy of them, with his vivid face as if powdered and red lips as if colored, his supple hips and broad shoulders, his deep voice and fierce strength. He was wearing silver helmet and armor and gripping a long spear as he sat there on his charger. Pang De and Ma Dai supported him, and Cao Cao admired Ma Chao in his secret heart. However, Cao Cao urged forward his steed and shouted to Ma Chao, “Why are you arrayed against the Hans, whom your father and grandfather served faithfully?” Ma Chao ground his teeth and cursed Cao Cao, “Rebel! Betrayer of both prince and people! Murderer of my father and brothers! My hate for you is to the death: the same sky shall not continue to cover us, for I will take you captive and satiate my appetite on your living flesh.” With this he set his spear and rode over toward Cao Cao as if to slay him. But Yu Jin came out from behind and engaged Ma Chao in battle. These two fought some half score bouts, and then Yu Jin had to flee. Zhang He, however, took his place and the two warriors exchanged twenty passes. Then Zhang He, too, ran away. Next to come forth was Li Tong. Ma Chao's martial prowess was now at its height, and he made short work of Li Tong, who went out of the saddle at the first blow. Then Ma Chao flourished his spear at the troops behind him as a signal for them to come on, which they did like a flood. They overwhelmed Cao Cao's forces, and Ma Chao, Pang De, and Ma Dai rode forward to try to capture Cao Cao. They came close. Cao Cao heard one of his pursuers shout to another, “Cao Cao is he in the red dress!” So he hastily tore off his red robe and threw it away. He also heard one say “Cao Cao is he with the long beard!” At once Cao Cao took the sword that he wore at his side and sawed off some of the beard. Yet again a soldier recognized him and told Ma Chao that Cao Cao had now cut his beard, whereupon the order went forth to capture short beards. And then Cao Cao wrapped the corner of a flag about neck and jowl and fled. Panic seized upon the soldiers at Tong Pass;"
沙場甘戰死，史冊共流芳。,"Gan died in the battle, and the annals of history shared a fragrant story.","Many are the commanders of the Shu who fall that day – Cheng Ji takes his own life in despair, surrounded as he is; Wu Ban and Feng Xi, raising the siege of Yiling, are cut off and die at the hands of Sun Huan’s army.","In battle on the flaming shore they died, And the histories record their deeds."
姜維逕到漢中，歇住人馬，自與使命入成都見後主。後主一連十日不朝。維心中疑惑。是日至東華門，遇見祕書郎郤正。維問曰：“天子召維班師，公知其故否？”正笑曰：“大將軍何尚不知：黃皓欲使閻宇立功，奏聞朝廷，發詔取回將軍——今聞鄧艾善能用兵，因此寢其事矣。”維大怒曰：“我必殺此宦豎！”郤正止之曰：“大將軍繼武侯之事，任大職重，豈可造次？倘若天子不容，反為不美矣。”維謝曰：“先生之言是也。”次日，後主與黃皓在後園宴飲，維引數人逕入。早有人報知黃皓，皓急避於湖山之側。維至亭下，拜了後主，泣奏曰：“臣困鄧艾於祁山，陛下連降三詔，召臣回朝，未審聖意為何？”後主默然不語。維又奏曰：“黃皓奸巧專權，乃靈帝時十常侍也。陛下近則鑒於張讓，遠則鑒於趙高。早殺此人，朝廷自然淸平，中原方可恢復。”後主笑曰：“黃皓乃趨走小臣，縱使專權，亦無能為。昔者董允每切齒恨皓，朕甚怪之。卿何必介意？”維叩頭奏曰：“陛下今日不殺黃皓，禍不遠也。”後主曰：“‘愛之欲其生，惡之欲其死。’卿何不容一宦官耶？”令近侍於湖山之側，喚出黃皓至亭下，命拜姜維伏罪。皓哭拜維曰：“某早晚趨侍聖上而已，並不干與國政。將軍休聽外人之言，欲殺某也。某命係於將軍，惟將軍憐之。”言羅，叩頭流涕。,"Jiang Weijing went to Hanzhong, rested his troops, and entered Chengdu with his mission to see the Lord. After the Lord did not go to court for ten consecutive days. Wei was puzzled. On the same day, I went to Donghuamen, and I met Secretary Lang but Zheng. Wei asked: ""The Son of Heaven called Wei Banshi, does the public know the reason?"" Zheng smiled and said, ""Why does the general still not know: Huang Hao wants to make Yan Yu make meritorious deeds, and has reported to the court and issued an edict to take back the general - now I hear that Deng Aishan can use troops. , so let’s go to bed.” Wei was furious and said, “I will kill this eunuch!” But he stopped and said, “The general follows the affairs of Marquis Wu and holds a great position, how can he make it worse? If the emperor would not allow it, he would instead It's not beautiful."" Wei Xie said, ""Sir's words are true."" The next day, the host and Huang Hao had a banquet in the back garden, and Wei invited several people to enter. Someone reported to Huang Hao long ago, and Hao hurriedly avoided the side of the lake and mountain. Wei went to the pavilion, bowed to the queen, and wept, saying: ""The minister is trapped in Deng Ai in Qishan, and your majesty has sent down three edicts in a row, and summoned the ministers back to the court. Wei also remarked: ""Huang Hao has a cunning and skillful dictatorship, and was one of the ten permanent attendants of Emperor Ling. His Majesty is in view of Zhang Rang in the nearness, and Zhao Gao in the distance. If you kill this person early, the court will naturally be leveled, and the Central Plains can be restored."" The Lord laughed and said, ""Huang Hao is trying to leave a small minister. Even if he has the power, he can't do anything. In the past, Dong Yun hated Hao every time he gnashed his teeth. I was very surprised. Why should you mind?"" Wei kowtowed and said, ""Your Majesty will not kill Huang Hao today. The disaster is not far away."" The queen said, ""'Love wants to live, and evil wants to die.' Why don't you allow an eunuch?"" He ordered his valet to be on the side of the lake and mountain, summoned Huang Hao to the pavilion, and ordered him to worship. Jiang Wei was guilty. Hao cried and bowed to Wei and said, ""A certain is just going to serve the sage sooner or later, and he does not interfere with the state affairs. The general should not listen to the words of outsiders and want to kill him. A certain life is tied to the general, but the general will pity him."" Yan Luo, kowtowed. snot.","The next day the second ruler and Huang Hao are picnicking in the back garden of the palace when in charges Jiang Wei with a group of his guards. Huang Hao, hearing the commotion, flees and hides before Jiang Wei reaches the second ruler, seated in his pavilion. ‘I almost had Deng Ai,’ Jiang Wei says, tears coursing down his face, ‘when your three orders reached me. But why?’ The second ruler has nothing to say. This spurs Jiang Wei on: ‘That eunuch Huang Hao has seized power – just as the Ten Eunuchs did in the reign of Emperor Ling. He must be killed. Only then will peace return and the country prosper.’ ‘Huang Hao is simply my servant,’ says the second ruler.","Arrived in Hanzhong, the army halted, and Jiang Wei went on to the capital in company with the messenger who had brought his orders. Here he waited ten days, and still the Latter Ruler held no court. He began to suspect mischief. One day near the palace gate he met Secretary General Xi Zheng, and asked, “Do you know the reason for my recall?” “What General! Do you not know? Huang Hao wanted to push Yan Yu into favor, so he intrigued for your recall. Now they have found out Deng Ai is too clever to be tackled, and so they are not fighting any more.” “I shall certainly have to put this eunuch fellow out of the way,” said Jiang Wei. “Hush! You are the successor of the Martial Lord, Zhuge Liang, the man to whom he bequeathed his unfinished task. You are too important to act hastily or indiscreetly. If the Emperor withdrew his support, it would go ill with you.” “Sir, what you say is true,” replied Jiang Wei. However, soon after this Jiang Wei, with a small party, got into the Palace. The Latter Ruler was enjoying himself with Huang Hao in the gardens. They told Huang Hao, who at once hid himself. Jiang Wei approached his master and prostrated himself, saying, “Why did Your Majesty recall me? I had the enemy in my power at Qishan when the triple edict came.” The Latter Ruler hummed and hawed, but made no reply. Then Jiang Wei began his real grievance. “This Huang Hao is wicked and artful and seems to have the last say in everything. The times of the Emperor Ling and the Ten Regular Attendants have returned. Your Majesty may recall Zhang Rang recently or Zhao Gao in the old time; but if you will only slay this man, the court will be purified and you may return gloriously to the home of your fathers.” The Latter Ruler smiled, saying, “Huang Hao is but a minor servant, one who runs errands for me. If he tried to do as you say, he could not. I always wondered why Dong Yun seemed to hate poor Huang Hao so much. Now you are the same. I pray you, noble Sir, take no notice of him.” “Unless Your Majesty gets rid of him, evil is very close,” said Jiang Wei, beating his head upon the ground. The Latter Ruler replied, “If you love anyone, you want him to live; if you dislike him, you desire his death; can you not bear with my one poor eunuch?” The Latter Ruler bade one of the attendants go and call Huang Hao. When Huang Hao approached the pavilion, the Latter Ruler told him to ask pardon of Jiang Wei. Huang Hao prostrated himself and wept, saying, “I am always in attendance upon the Sacred One; that is all I do. I never meddle in state affairs. I pray you, General, pay no heed to what people say. If you desire my death, I am in your hands, but pity me.” And tears ran down his cheeks. Jiang Wei went away in ill humor."

却說張飛回到閬中，下令軍中：限三日內製辦白旗白甲，三軍挂孝伐吳。次日，帳下兩員末將，范疆、張達入帳告曰：“白旗白甲，一時無措，須寬限方可。”飛大怒曰：“吾急欲報讎，恨不明日便到逆賊之境。汝安敢違我將令！”叱武士縛於樹上，各鞭背五十。鞭畢，以手指之曰：“來日俱要完備！若違了限，卽殺汝二人示衆！”打得二人滿口出血，回到營中商議。范疆曰：“今日受了刑責，着我等如何辦得？其人性暴如火。倘來日不完，你我皆被殺矣！”張達曰：“比如他殺我，不如我殺他。”疆曰：“怎奈不得近前。”達曰：“我兩個若不當死，則他醉於牀上；若是當死，則他不醉。”二人商議停當。,"However, Zhang Fei said that Zhang Fei returned to Langzhong and ordered the army: within three days, the white flag and white armor should be set up, and the three armies would hang filial piety to attack Wu. The next day, Fan Jiang and Zhang Da entered the tent and reported, ""The white flag and the white armor are at a loss for a while, so I need to be lenient."" Fei was furious and said, ""I am eager to retaliate, and I hate the future. You will come to the realm of rebels. You dare to disobey my orders!"" The warriors were tied to a tree, each with fifty whips on their backs. After the whipping was completed, he pointed it out and said, ""It will be complete in the future! If the limit is violated, I will kill the two of you and show the public!"" Fan Jiang said: ""I have been punished today, how can I do it? Its human nature is like fire. If it doesn't end in the future, both you and I will be killed!"" Zhang Da said: ""For example, if he kills me, it is better for me to kill. He."" Jiang said, ""Why can't I come closer."" Da said, ""If the two of us don't want to die, he will be drunk on the bed; if we should die, he will not be drunk."" The two stopped discussing.","Back at Langzhong, Zhang Fei gives orders for the troops to be ready within three days and to have all the banners and surcoats of the troops in white – the colour of mourning. The very next day two officers, Fan Jiang and Zhang Da, come and tell him that they can’t possibly be ready in so few days. They and their men need more time. Aroused to a terrifying anger, Zhang Fei has the two men bound to a tree and each of them flogged fifty times. ‘Everything, I say everything, will be ready by tomorrow or I’ll execute you both!’ he shrieks and he has them beaten again until the blood flows from their mouths. Horrified and frightened, the two men stagger back to their tents and begin to plot how to escape from such a terrible fate. ‘ He’s out of control, like a raging fire,’ says one. ‘We’ve no chance of completing the work in time. We’re dead!’ cries the other. ‘ So why don’t we kill him before he can kill us?’ says Zhang Da. ‘And how exactly do we even get near him?’ asks Fan Jiang. ‘If our fate is to live, then he will be drunk. If our fate is sealed and we must die, he will be sober,’ says Zhang Da, and on this basis they begin to prepare for the murder of Zhang Fei.","As soon as Zhang Fei had got back to his post, he issued orders that his soldiers should be ready to march in three days and the whole body was to be in mourning, white uniforms and whitened arms. Just after the order appeared, two generals named Fan Jiang and Zhang Da came to their chief, saying, “The time allowed is insufficient to make white flags and armors. Pray give us more time, General.” “I am hot to avenge my brother,” said Zhang Fei. “My only regret is that I cannot reach the miserable wretch's country tomorrow. Do you dare to disobey my order?” Zhang Fei called in the lictors, had the two officers bound to trees, and ordered each to receive fifty lashes. At the close of the flogging, he said, “Now you will be ready tomorrow; if you are not, I will put you to death as an example!” The two generals returned to their place, spitting blood and hot with anger, and they said one to another, “We have been beaten today; what about tomorrow? This man's temper is unbearable; and if things are not ready, we shall suffer death.” “Suppose we slay him,” suddenly said Zhang Da, “since if we do not, he will kill us.” “But how can we get near him?” “If we are to have a chance to live, he will get drunk and go to bed; if we are to die, he will remain sober.” They made all their arrangements for the crime."

And hereafter he will send tribute to your Emperor.” “Where is your brother at this moment?” asked Zhuge Liang. “Having been the recipient of your great bounty, he has gone to the Silver Pit Hills to collect some treasures. He will soon return.” “How many soldiers have you brought?” “Only about a hundred; I should not dare to bring any large number. They are just porters.” They were brought in for Zhuge Liang's inspection. They had blue eyes and swarthy faces, auburn hair and brown beards. They wore earrings, their hair was fuzzy, and they went barefoot. They were tall and powerful. Zhuge Liang made them sit down, and bade his generals press them to drink and treat them well and compliment them."
未知成都如何守禦，且看下文分解。,"I don't know how Chengdu is defended, and see the breakdown below.",Now the march is on for Chengdu.,The next chapter will tell of the defense of Chengdu.
夏侯惇盡斬五家老小宗族，將百官解赴鄴郡。曹操於敎場立紅旗於左、白旗於右，下令曰：“耿紀、韋晃等造反，放火焚許都，汝等亦有出救火者，亦有閉門不出者。如曾救火者，可立於紅旗下；如不曾救火者，可立於白旗下。”衆官自思救火者必無罪，於是多奔紅旗之下。三停內只有一停立於白旗下。操敎盡拏立於紅旗下者。衆官各言無罪。操曰：“汝當時之心，非是救火，實欲助賊耳。”盡命牽出漳河邊斬之，死者三百餘員。其立於白旗下者，盡皆賞賜，仍令還許都。時王必已被箭瘡發而死，操命厚葬之。令曹休總督御林軍馬，鍾繇為相國，華歆為御史大夫。遂定侯爵六等十八級，關中侯爵十七級，皆金印紫綬。又置關內外侯十六級，銀印龜紐墨綬；五大夫十五級，銅印鐶紐綬。定爵封官，朝廷又換一班人物。曹操方悟管輅火災之說，遂重賞輅。輅不受。,"Xiahou Dun beheaded all five clans, old and small, and released all officials to Ye County. Cao Cao set up the red flag on the left and the white flag on the right, and ordered: ""Geng Ji, Wei Huang, etc. rebelled and set fire to Xudu. You and others also went out to fight the fire, and some of you stayed behind. You can stand under the red flag; if you have never put out a fire, you can stand under the white flag."" The officials thought that those who put out the fire would be innocent, so they ran under the red flag. Only one of the three stops stands under the white flag. Fuck those who stand under the red flag. All the officials were innocent. Cao said, ""Your intention at that time was not to fight the fire, but to help the thief's ears."" He tried his best to lead him out of the Zhanghe River and behead him, and more than 300 people died. Those who stand under the white banner are all rewarded, and they are still ordered to return to Xudu. At that time, the king must have been killed by arrow sores, and he was buried with all his life. He ordered Cao Xiu to be the governor of the imperial army, Zhong Yao to be the prime minister, and Hua Xin to be the imperial censor. The sixth and eighteenth rank of Marquis and the seventeenth rank of Marquis of Guanzhong were assigned, all with gold seals and purple ribbons. The sixteenth rank of Guan Neihou, with silver tortoises and ink ribbons, and the fifteenth rank of the five husbands, bronze seals and buttons. Ding Jue was appointed an official, and the court changed another group of characters. Cao Cao realized the theory that the fire was in control of the chariot, so he rewarded the chariot again. Do not accept.","Their grief goes down with them to the Nine Springs of Hell. After the execution of the families, Xiahou Dun brings all the palace staff to Yejun, where Cao Cao has set up two flags – red to the left and white to the right. Then Cao Cao summons the officials. ‘Those who came out to fight the fires stand by the red flag. Those who stayed at home and did nothing, stand by the white flag.’ Two thirds of the officials, thinking that if they were assumed to have come out to help they will be rewarded, go to the red flag. The rest stand by the white flag and, to everyone’s surprise, it is those by the red flag that Cao Cao orders arrested. Horrified at this, they protest, but Cao Cao replies, ‘You didn’t come out to help but to support the rebels’, and he orders their immediate execution. Three hundred or more die that day. Those who chose the white flag are rewarded and return with relief to the city. Wang Bi dies as a result of the arrow and is given a ceremonial funeral, while Cao Xiu is put in charge of the Royal Guard. In response to all this, Cao Cao increases the size, splendour and authority of his court. Cao Hong has arrived at Hanzhong and with Zhang He and Xiahou Yuan is ensuring","Xiahou Dun carried out his chief's orders and sent the officials he had arrested to Yejun. There Cao Cao set up two flags, one red and one white, in the drill ground and sent all the officials thither. Then he addressed them. “In this late rebellion some of you went out to extinguish the fire, some of you stayed within doors. Let those who went forth to put out the fire take their stand by the red flag, and those who remained in their houses go to the white flag.” The officials thought within themselves, “Certainly there can be nothing wrong in trying to put out a fire,” so they nearly all placed themselves under the red flag; only about a third went to the white. Then the order was given to seize all those by the red flag. They protested. “We are guiltless!” cried they. Cao Cao said, “At that time you intended not to put out the flames but to aid the rebels.” He sent them all down to River Zhang and had them put to death on the bank. There were more than three hundred victims. He rewarded those who were under the white flag and sent them to their homes in the capital. Wang Bi died from his wound and was buried with great honor. Cao Xiu was placed over the guards; Zhong Yao was created Prime Minister of the princedom of Wei, Hua Xin became High Minister. The occasion was taken to create six grades of the title of Lordship with three divisions each, eighteen in all. There were seventeen grades of Marquis West of the Pass. And all these had golden seals of office with purple ribbons. There were also sixteen ranks of Interior Marquis and Exterior Marquis. They had silver seals with tortoise ornaments on the back and black ribbons. There were five classes of Minister with three grades in each class. These had brass seals, with chain ornaments and ribbons. And with all these various gradations of ranks and nobility reorganized, the court was entirely reformed. There were new ranks and new people in office.1 Cao Cao then remembered the warning about a conflagration in the capital and wished to reward Guan Lu for his prescience, but he would receive nothing."
次日，司馬師大會羣臣曰：“今主上荒淫無道，褻近娼優，聽信讒言，閉塞賢路：其罪甚於漢之昌邑，不能主天下。吾謹按伊尹、霍光之法，別立新君，以保社稷，以安天下，如何？”衆皆應曰：“大將軍行伊、霍之事，所謂應天順人，誰敢違命？”師遂同多官入永寧宮，奏聞太后。太后曰：“大將軍欲立何人為君？”師曰：“臣觀彭城王曹據，聰明仁孝：可以為天下之主。”太后曰：“彭城王乃老身之叔，今立為君，我何以當之？今有高貴鄕公曹髦，乃文皇帝之孫：此人温恭克讓，可以立之。卿等大臣，從長計議。”一人奏曰：“太后之言是也。便可立之。”衆視之，乃司馬師宗叔司馬孚也。師遂遣使往元城召高貴鄕公；請太后升太極殿，召芳責之曰：“汝荒淫無度，褻近娼優，不可承天下；當納下璽綬，復齊王之爵，目下起程，非宣召不許入朝。”芳泣拜太后，納了國寶，乘王車大哭而去。只有數員忠義之臣，含淚而送。後人有詩曰：,"The next day, the ministers of the Sima Shi Conference said: ""Today, the Lord is debauched and unreasonable, blaspheming the prostitutes, listens to slander, and blocks the path of the virtuous: his crimes are worse than Changyi in the Han Dynasty, and he cannot rule the world. I sincerely follow the methods of Yi Yin and Huo Guang. Why don't you establish a new ruler to protect the society and the world?"" All the people responded, ""The generals do things like Yi and Huo, the so-called obeying the heavens and obeying people, who would dare to disobey?"" Palace, the Queen Mother is playing. The Empress Dowager said, ""Who does the general want to appoint as king?"" The master said, ""My minister sees King Cao Ju of Pengcheng, who is smart, benevolent and filial: he can be the ruler of the world."" The Empress Dowager said, ""King Pengcheng is the uncle of the old man. Why should it be? Today, there is a noble and noble Duke Cao Mao, the grandson of Emperor Wen: this man is gentle and respectful, and can be established. ."" The public regarded it as Sima Fu, the uncle of Sima Shizong. The teacher then sent an envoy to Yuancheng to summon the noble Duke Yan; he asked the queen mother to ascend to the Taiji Hall, and summoned Fang to reprimand him and said: ""You are unreasonable and prostitutes, and you cannot inherit the world; When you set off, you are not allowed to enter the court unless you are called."" Fang Qi paid tribute to the Queen Mother, took the national treasure, and went away crying in the king's chariot. Only a few loyal ministers sent them away with tears in their eyes. A later poem says:","Today, the Sima do the same to Queen Zhang, Heaven repays the cost to the descendants of Cao. Events then take a swift turn. Sima Shi calls a council of ministers and denounces the emperor, saying he is unfit to rule.","The day after these events, Sima Shi assembled all the officers and addressed them thus: “Our present lord is profligate and devoid of principle; familiar with the vile and friendly with the impure. He lends a ready ear to slander and keeps good people at a distance. His faults exceed those of Prince Changyi of old, and he has proved himself unfit to rule. Wherefore, following the precedents of Yi Yin and Huo Guang, I have decided to put him aside and to set up another, thereby to maintain the sanctity of the ruler and ensure tranquillity. What think you, Sirs?” They all agreed, saying, “General, you are right to play the same part as Yi Yin and Huo Guang, thereby acting in accordance with Heaven and fulfilling the desire of humankind. Who dares dispute it?” Then Sima Shi, followed by the whole of the officials, went to the Palace of Everlasting Peace and informed the Empress Dowager of his intention. “Whom do you propose to place on the throne, General?” she asked. “I have observed that Cao Ju, Prince of Pengcheng, is intelligent, benevolent, and filial; he is fit to rule the empire.” She replied, “He is my uncle, and it is not convenient. However, there is Cao Mao, Duke of Gaogui, and grandson of Emperor Pi. He is of mild temperament, respectful, and deferential, and may be set up. You, Sir, and the high officers of state might favorably consider this.” Then spoke one, saying, “Her Majesty speaks well; Cao Mao should be raised to the throne.” All eyes turned toward the speaker, who was Sima Fu, uncle of Sima Shi. The Duke of Gaogui was summoned to the capital. The Empress called Cao Fang into her presence in the Hall of Principles and blamed him, saying, “You are vicious beyond measure, a companion of lewd men and a friend of vile women. You are unfitted to rule. Therefore resign the imperial seal and revert to your status of Prince of Qi (an ancient state). You are forbidden to present yourself at court without special command.” Cao Fang, weeping, threw himself at her feet. He gave up the seal, got into his carriage and went away. Only a few faithful ministers restrained their tears and bade him farewell. Cao Cao, the mighty minister of Han, Oppressed the helpless; little then thought he"

Quan Zhiman was in love with him, so he consulted with his advisors. Zhang Zhaojin said: ""Wei and Wu had nothing to do with each other; because of listening to Zhuge's speech, the two families fought for years without interruption, and their lives were ruined by him. Now that Man Boning has come, he must have the intention to talk about peace, and he can be greeted with courtesy. According to his words, Quan ordered the strategists to meet him in the city full of pets. After the ceremony, the right to treat the pet with courtesy. Chong submitted a book to Cao Cao, saying: ""Wu and Wei have never been in trouble, because Liu Bei has caused a quarrel. The king of Wei sent a certain here, and asked the general to attack Jingzhou. We will divide the territory together, and promise not to invade each other.” After Sun Quan read the book, he set up a feast for each other and sent him back to the hall to rest in peace.","‘There exists great enmity between Sun Quan and Xuande over the fate of Sun Quan’s sister – the wife of Xuande – and over the contentious issue of Jingzhou,’ Sima Yi says. ‘Let’s send a letter to Sun Quan suggesting he attacks and captures Jingzhou, which will mean Xuande will have to rush to its defence, and we can easily recapture Hanzhong.’","The scheme pleased Cao Cao. He at once drew up a letter and sent it by the hand of Man Chong, who soon arrived in Wu. As soon as Sun Quan knew of the mission, he summoned his advisers to consult. Zhang Zhao said, “Wei and Wu are primarily enemies because of the dissension fomented by the words of Zhuge Liang. They have been fighting for several years and many lives have been lost. Now this messenger has surely come to discuss terms of friendship, and he should be welcomed.” On the strength of this, Man Chong was well received and conducted into the city and into the presence of Sun Quan. He presented his letters at the conclusion of the ceremonies of reception and declared his mission. “Wu and Wei have no fundamental quarrel, and their dissension has been brought about by Liu Bei. My master sends me to covenant with you for an attack on Jingzhou, while he goes against Hanzhong. This double attack being successful, the conquered country can be divided between us two, and we can both swear to respect each other's territory.” Having read the letter, Sun Quan prepared a banquet in honor of Man Chong and then sent him to the guest-house to rest while he discussed the matter with his council of advisers."
却說鄧艾封師纂為益州刺史，牽弘、王頎等各領州郡；又於綿竹築臺以彰戰功，大會蜀中諸官飲宴。艾酒至半酣，乃指衆官曰：“汝等幸遇我，故有今日耳。若遇他將，必皆殄滅矣。”多官起身拜謝。忽蔣顯至，說姜維自降鍾鎮西了。艾因此痛恨鍾會，遂修書令人齎赴洛陽致晉公司馬昭。昭得書視之。書曰：,"But he said that Deng Aifeng was the prefect of Yizhou, and he led Hong, Wang Qi and other states and counties. When Aijiu was half full, he pointed to the officials and said, ""You are fortunate to meet me, so you have today's ears. If you meet him, they will all be destroyed."" Many officials stood up and thanked them. Suddenly Jiang Xianzhi said that Jiang Wei had surrendered to the west of Zhongzhen. Ai hated Zhong Hui because of this, so he repaired the book and sent him to Luoyang Zhijin Company Ma Zhao. Zhao Deshu sees it. The book says:","When news of Jiang Wei’s surrender to Zhong Hui reaches Deng Ai in the capital, he is deeply perturbed by this and immediately writes to Sima Zhao, basically saying that, in order to impress Wu and perhaps encourage their surrender, the second ruler, now simply known as Liu Shan, should be given an estate – Yizhou – and honours and kept in luxury in Shu so that Sun Xiu can see how benevolent the Wei are to those who submit.","As conqueror, Deng Ai arranged for the administration of the newly-gained territory. He made Shi Zuan Imperial Protector of Yiazhou and appointed Qian Hong, Yang Xin, and many others to various posts. He also built a tower in Mianzhu in commemoration of his conquest. At a great banquet, where most of the guests were people of the newly-conquered land, Deng Ai drank too freely and in his cups became garrulous. With a patronizing wave of his hand, he said to his guests, “You are lucky in that you have had to do with me. Things might well have been otherwise, and you might all have been put to death, if you surrender to other leader.” The guests rose in a body and expressed their gratitude. Just at that moment Jiang Xian arrived from his visit to Jiang Wei to say that Jiang Wei and his army had surrendered to Zhong Hui. Deng Ai thereupon conceived a great hatred for Zhong Hui, and soon after he wrote to Luoyang a letter something like this: “I would venture to remark that misleading rumors of war should precede actual attack."
小童歸告主人，主人不敢隱諱，報知曹操。操畫影圖形，各處捉拏左慈。三日之內，城裏城外，所捉眇一目、跛一足、白藤冠、靑懶衣、穿木履先生，都一般模樣者，有三四百個。鬨動街市。操令衆將，將猪羊血潑之，押送城南敎場。曹操親自引甲兵五百人圍住，盡皆斬之。人人頸腔內各起一道靑氣，飛到上天，聚成一處，化成一個左慈，向空招白鶴一隻騎坐，拍手大笑曰：“土鼠隨金虎，奸雄一旦休！”操令衆將以弓箭射之。忽然狂風大作，走石揚沙；所斬之屍，皆跳起來，手提其頭，奔上演武廳來打曹操。文官武將，掩面驚倒，各不相顧。正是：,"The boy returned to his master, who did not dare to keep a secret, and reported to Cao Cao. Playing with shadows, arrest Zuo Ci everywhere. Within three days, inside and outside the city, there were three or four hundred people who were caught with one eye, one lame foot, white vine crowns, lazy clothes, and gentlemen in wooden shoes. Stir up the market. He ordered the generals to pour the blood of pigs and sheep on them and escort them to the school in the south of the city. Cao Cao personally surrounded him with 500 armoured soldiers, and beheaded them all. Each of them raised a qi in their necks, flew to the sky, gathered in one place, transformed into a Zuo Ci, and moved a white crane to sit in the air, clapping their hands and laughing, saying, ""The squirrel will follow the golden tiger, and the traitor will be retired!"" Command the crowd to shoot with bows and arrows. Suddenly there was a gust of wind, and the rocks and sand were thrown away; Civilian and military generals, covering their faces and being shocked, ignored each other. Exactly:","News of this is reported by the lad’s master, and Cao Cao has pictures drawn of Zuo Ci and circulated around the country with orders that he be arrested. Three days later, hundreds of men who look exactly like Zuo Ci are herded into the capital. Chaos, of course, ensues so Cao Cao orders that they be sprinkled with pig and sheep’s blood and taken outside the city walls. Here five hundred soldiers led by Cao Cao cut the heads off every one of them. But suddenly from each severed head a thin, black mist rises. Swirling into the sky these mists merge together and there they become none other than Zuo Ci. Summoning a white crane, he seats himself upon it, claps his hands and says, ‘The rats of the earth follow the golden tiger, but one day the evil one will be no more.’ Cao Cao frantically orders his archers to fire, but a strong wind scatters everything. The executed men leap up and, clutching their severed heads, rush towards Cao Cao and his men. Cowering with terror and fainting with horror, the officials cover their faces.","The shepherd lad went home and told all these marvels to his master. He could not conceal such a story, and it reached Cao Cao. Then sketches of the Taoist were sent everywhere with orders to arrest him. Within three days were arrested in the city and outside three or four hundred persons all blind of one eye, lame of one leg, and wearing a rattan head-dress, a black loose robe and wooden clogs. They were all alike and all answered to the description of the missing Taoist. There was a great hubbub in the street. Cao Cao ordered his officer to sprinkle the crowd of Taoists with the blood of pigs and goats in order to exorcise the witchcraft and take them away to the drill ground on the south of the city. Thither he followed them with his guards, who surrounded the crowd of arrested persons and slew every one. But from the neck of each one, after the head was severed, there floated up into the air a wreath of black vapor, and all these wreaths drifted toward a center where they joined up into the image of another Zuo Ci, who presently beckoned to him a white crane out of the sky, mounted it and sat as on a horse. Clapping his hands, the Taoist cried merrily, “The rats of the earth follow the golden tiger, and one morning the doer of evil shall be no more.” The soldiers shot arrows at both bird and man. At this a tremendous storm burst over the city. Stones were driven along, sand was whirled about, and all the corpses arose from the ground, each holding his own head in his hands. They rushed toward Cao Cao as if to strike him."

Kong Ming diligently persuaded him to drink. In the drinking room, suddenly a person came in drunk, bowed proudly, and sat down at the table. Wen blamed it, and asked Kong Ming, ""Who is this?"" Kong Ming replied, ""The surname is Qin, the first name is Mi, and the word is Zichi; now he is a scholar in Yizhou."" Wen smiled and said, ""The name is bachelor, and I don't know if I have ever learned something in my chest. No?"" Mi Zhengshe said, ""All the three-footed children in Shu are still studying, how much more of me?"" Wen said, ""What do you study?"" Mi replied, ""As far as astronomy, down to geography, three The teachings of Jiuliu, all the scholars and hundreds of schools of thought are all incomprehensible; the rise and fall of ancient and modern times, the sages and sages have been passed down, and everything can be seen."" Wen Xiao said, ""Gong Yan has made a big statement, please take the sky as the question: Does the sky have a head?"" Mi Said: ""There is a head."" Wen said, ""Where is the head?"" Mi said, ""In the west. The Poetry says: 'It is the care of the West.' If this is the case, the head is in the west."" Wen asked again: ""Does the sky have ears?"" Mi replied, ""Heaven is high but listening is low. The Poetry says: 'He sings Jiu Gao, the voice is heard in the sky.' How can you hear without ears?"" Wen asked again: ""Heaven has feet. What?"" Mi said, ""There are enough feet. The Poem says: 'The sky is difficult.' How can you walk without feet?"" Wen asked again, ""Does the sky have a surname?"" Mi said, ""How can there be no surname?"" Wen He asked, ""What's your surname?"" Mi replied, ""My surname is Liu."" Wen said, ""How do you know it?"" Mi said, ""The emperor's surname is Liu, so that's why you know him."" He replied, ""Although he was born in the east, he was not born in the west.""",Kong Ming agrees with the second ruler that if Deng Zhi returns with an envoy from Wu then they will forge an alliance against Wei.,"Next day the Latter Ruler gave Zhang Wen rich presents of gold and studs and prepared a parting banquet for him in the south guest-chamber, and all the court assembled to take leave of him. The Prime Minister paid him assiduous attention and pressed him to drink. While this banquet was in progress, a man suddenly came in as if he were already drunk, made a proud sort of salutation to the company and at once took a seat. His conduct seemed strange to Zhang Wen, who asked, “Who is the new comer, Sir Prime Minister?” “He is a man named Qin Mi, a Doctorate Academician of Yiazhou,” replied Zhuge Liang. “He may be that,” said Zhang Wen with a laugh, “but I wonder if he has any learning at all inside him.” Qin Mi listened without changing countenance, and said, “Since our children are all learned, of course I am more so.” “What may have been your special studies, Sir?” said Zhang Wen. “Everything: astronomy on one hand, geography on the other, the three teachings and the nine systems, all the philosophers, history all through, and all sacred books and traditions. There is nothing I have not read.” “Since you talk so big,” said Zhang Wen, “I should like to ask you a few questions on celestial matters. Now has the sky a head?” “Yes; it has a head.” “Where is it?” “In the western quarter; the Odes say, 'God turns his head kindly toward the west,' and further it follows from this that the head is in the west.” “Well; has the sky ears?” “Oh, yes. The sky is above and listens to all things below. The Odes say, 'The crane calls from the midst of the marsh, its cry is heard by the sky.' How could the sky hear without ears?” “Has the sky feet?” “It has; the Odes say, 'Heaven treads down difficulties.' If there were no feet, how could it tread?” “Has heaven a name?” “Why not?” “Then what is it?” “Liu.” “How do you know that?” “Because the Emperor's family name is Liu, and he is the Son of Heaven. That is how I know.” “Does the sun spring from the east?” “Though it does, yet it sets in the west.”"

却說曹操退兵至斜谷，孔明料他必棄漢中而走，故差馬超等諸將，分兵十數路，不時攻劫。因此操不能久住；又被魏延射了一箭，急急班師。三軍銳氣墮盡。前隊纔行，兩下火起，乃是馬超伏兵追趕。曹兵人人喪膽。操令軍士急行，曉夜奔走無停；直至京兆，方始安心。,"But they said that Cao Cao retreated to Xiegu, and Kong Ming expected that he would abandon Hanzhong and leave, so he sent Ma Chao and other generals to divide his troops into dozens of routes, and attacked and robbed from time to time. Therefore, Cao couldn't stay for a long time; he was shot by Wei Yan again, and he was in a hurry. The three armies were exhausted. The front team is fine, two fires broke out, but Ma Chao was chasing after him in ambush. Cao Bing was terrified. The sergeant was ordered to rush, and Xiaoye ran without stopping; until Jingzhao, only then did he feel at ease.","It is pretty clear to Kong Ming where Cao Cao will go when he has to retreat. As a result he sends Ma Chao to ensure as difficult a departure for Cao Cao as possible. Hounded by Ma Chao at every opportunity, the Wei troops suffer heavily, and morale collapses. Although he is in severe pain from his wound, Cao Cao has no option but to speed up the retreat. Only when he at last reaches Chang’an do he and his men feel safe and rest.","When Cao Cao retired to the Xie Valley, Zhuge Liang considered it to mean the abandonment of his attempt to acquire possession of Hanzhong, and he sent out several parties to harass and hasten his retreat by guerrilla attacks. For this reason the retreating army had to keep on the move. Beside, Cao Cao was suffering from his wound, and marched as hurriedly as possible. But it was a dejected army, when the leading legions encountered fire on both flanks, which had been raised by troops placed in ambush while Ma Chao's main force kept driving the army before it. Every one in the Cao Cao army was dispirited, and there was no more courage in them. They pressed forward day and night alike without halting to rest."

次日衆議紛然。譙周見事急，復上疏諍之。後主從譙周之言。正欲出降；忽屏風後轉出一人，厲聲而罵周曰：“偷生腐儒，豈可妄議社稷大事！自古安有降天子哉！”後主視之，乃第五子北地王劉諶也。後主生七子：長子劉璿，次子劉瑤，三子劉悰，四子劉瓚，五子卽北地王劉諶，六子劉恂，七子劉璩。七子中惟諶自幼聰明，英敏過人，餘皆懦善。後主謂諶曰：“今大臣皆議當降，汝獨仗血氣之勇，欲令滿城流血耶？”諶曰：“昔先帝在日，譙周未嘗干預國政；今妄議大事，輒起亂言，甚非理也。臣切料成都之兵，尚有數萬；姜維全師，皆在劍閣；若知魏兵犯闕，必來救應，內外攻擊，可獲全功。豈可聽腐儒之言，輕廢先帝之基業乎？”後主叱之曰：“汝小兒豈識天時！”諶叩頭哭曰：“若勢窮力極，禍敗將及，便當父子君臣背城一戰，同死社稷，以見先帝可也；奈何降乎！”後主不聽。諶放聲大哭曰：“先帝非容易創立基業；今一旦棄之，吾寧死不辱也！”後主令近臣推出宮門，遂令譙周作降書，遣私署侍中張紹、駙馬都尉鄧良同譙周齎玉璽來雒城請降。,"The next day there was disagreement. Qiao Zhou saw that the matter was urgent, so he went back to Shu and criticized it. The later master followed the words of Qiao Zhou. Just as he was about to go out to surrender, suddenly a person turned from behind the screen and scolded Zhou in a stern voice, saying, ""How can you arbitrarily discuss the important affairs of society and grain! Since ancient times, there has been a descendant of the emperor!"" and also. Later the master gave birth to seven sons: the eldest son Liu Ying, the second son Liu Yao, the third son Liu Tai, the fourth son Liu Zan, the fifth son Liu Chen, the king of Beibei, the sixth son Liu Xun, and the seventh son Liu Quan. Among the seven sons, only Chen was wise and wise from a young age, while the rest were all cowardly and kind. Afterwards, the master said to Chen: ""The ministers are all talking about the time to surrender. You are only relying on the courage of your blood to make the whole city bleed?"" It's very unreasonable to talk nonsense. The minister estimates that there are still tens of thousands of soldiers in Chengdu; Jiang Wei's entire division is all in Jiange; Say, do you underestimate the foundation of the previous emperor?"" The latter scolded him, ""How do you know the time of day, little boy?"" Chen kowtowed and cried, ""If the power is extremely weak, and disaster and defeat are imminent, then the father and son, the ruler and the minister, will fight against the city and fight against the city together. Dead Sheji, so I can see the late emperor; but why did he come down!"" The late master did not listen. Chen burst into tears and said, ""It is not easy for the first emperor to establish a foundation; if I abandon it now, I would rather die than disgrace!"" Wei Dengliang and Qiaozhou Jiyuxi came to Luocheng to ask for surrender.","But the next morning he is still none the wiser about what course to take. Qiao Zhou then submits a memorial supporting surrender, and this helps the ruler decide. He will submit to the Wei. Imagine his astonishment when his son Liu Chen roars out his disapproval and, rounding upon Qiao Zhou, calls him a coward for driving the second ruler into doing what no other emperor has ever done before. The second ruler has seven sons, but frankly the others are pathetic specimens. Only Liu Chen has any spirit and strength. The second ruler rounds on his son: ‘Everyone else agrees. Only you want to increase the bloodshed, just because you’re a shallow, warlike youth!’ Liu Chen tries to argue that they still have Jiang Wei, who can fight his way through. And denouncing Qiao Zhou as a worthless fop, he contends strongly that they should hold on. ‘Take care and shut up. You have no grasp of the Will of Heaven,’ declares the second ruler. But still the young prince argues on, even declaring that he will not allow himself to live to see the day his patrimony is given away. But the second ruler will have none of this and he orders the prince be cast out of the hall. Then he gives orders for the document of surrender to be drawn up. Soon the envoys arrive at Deng Ai’s camp with the document of surrender and the seal of authority.","Next day confusion had become still worse. Qiao Zhou saw that matters were very urgent and presented a written memorial. The Latter Ruler accepted it and decided to yield. But from behind a screen stepped out one of the Emperor's sons, Liu Chan, Prince of Beidi, who shouted at Qiao Zhou, “You corrupt pedant, unfit to live among people! How dare you offer such mad advice in a matter concerning the existence of a dynasty? Has any emperor ever yielded to the enemy? “ The Latter Ruler had seven sons in all, but the ablest, and the only one above the common level of people, was this Liu Chan. The Latter Ruler turned feebly to his son and said, “The ministers have decided otherwise; they advise surrender. You are the only one who thinks that boldness may avail, and would you drench the city in blood?” The Prince said, “While the First Ruler lived, this Qiao Zhou had no voice in state affairs. Now he gives this wild advice and talks the most subversive language. There is no reason at all in what he says, for we have in the city many legions of soldiers, and Jiang Wei is undefeated in Saber Pass. He will come to our rescue as soon as he knows our straits, and we can help him to fight. We shall surely succeed. Why listen to the words of this dryasdust? Why abandon thus lightly the work of our great forerunner?” The Latter Ruler became angry at this harangue and turned to his son, saying, “Be silent! You are too young to understand.” Liu Chan beat his head upon the ground and implored his father to make an effort. “If we have done our best and defeat yet comes, if father and son, prince and minister have set their backs to the wall and died in one final effort to preserve the dynasty, then in the shades of the Nine Golden Springs we shall be able to look the First Ruler in the face, unashamed. But what if we surrender?” The appeal left the Latter Ruler unmoved. The Prince cried, “Is it not shameful in one day to throw down all that our ancestors built up with so great labor? I would rather die.” The Latter Ruler, now very angry, bade the courtiers thrust the young man out of the Palace. Then he ordered Qiao Zhou to prepare the formal Act of Surrender. When it was written, three officers—Adviser Zhang Shao, Imperial Son-in-Law Deng Liang, and High Minister Qiao Zhou—were sent with it and the Hereditary Seal to the camp of Deng Ai to offer submission."

Wei Zi led troops to Houhe to fight against Deng Ai. Ai Yinjun went out to welcome him. The two armies faced each other, and the two fought for more than a dozen times. The next day, Jiang Wei led his troops to challenge again, but Deng Ai refused to let his troops out. Jiang Weiling's army insulted him, and Deng Ai pondered and said: ""The people of Shu have been killed by me for a while, and they will not retreat. I should go and rescue him in person."" He called his son Deng Zhong and said, ""You guard this place with all your heart and let him fight, but don't let him go out lightly. I will lead troops to Qishan tonight to rescue them."" It was the second watch of the night, Jiang Wei. While designing in the village, suddenly I heard shouts from outside the village, and the drum horns were loud: People reported that Deng Ai led 3,000 elite soldiers to fight at night, and the generals were about to come out. Wei Zhizhi said, ""Don't act rashly."" It turned out that Deng Ai had led his troops to the outpost of Shuzhai, and took advantage of the situation to rescue Qishan. Deng Zhong went into the city by himself. Jiang Wei called the generals and said, ""Deng Ai Xu is fighting at night, and he must go to rescue Qi Shanzhai."" Three thousand soldiers came to help Zhang Yi.","Encouraged by this, Deng Ai launches a night raid on Jiang Wei’s camp, which throws the Shu army into chaos.","The second division of the army was detached to march on Qishan, and Jiang Wei went down to Houxia to provoke Deng Ai into fighting. The challenge this time was accepted forthwith. Deng Ai led his troops out and engaged with Jiang Wei in a fight, but after thirty bouts without a decision, both retired to their camps. For days after this, Jiang Wei challenged again and again, but Deng Ai declined and would not fight. The Shu soldiers howled abuse and hurled insults at their opponents, but all without effect. Then Deng Ai thought within him, “There must be some reason for this persistence. I think they have sent an army to try to seize Qishan while they hold me here. Shi Zuan and the force there are insufficient, and I shall have to go to the rescue.” Deng Ai called his son Deng Zhong, and said, “Hold this place most carefully. Let them challenge as they may, do not go out. Tonight I go to the help of Qishan.” It was night, and Jiang Wei was in his tent, intent upon his plans, when he was disturbed by a great shouting and drumming. They told him Deng Ai had suddenly appeared. The generals asked leave to go out to fight. “Let no one move!” said Jiang Wei. The fact was Deng Ai had only made a demonstration at the camp of Shu on his way to reinforce Qishan. Then Jiang Wei said to his officers, “The attack of Deng Ai was a feint; he has certainly gone to relieve Qishan.” So Jiang Wei decided to go to the aid of Zhang Yi. He left Fu Qian to guard the camp, and he marched away with three thousand troops."
邊官報知魏主曹叡。叡大驚，乃召司馬懿入朝計議。懿奏曰：“臣部下馬步官軍四萬，足可破賊。”叡曰：“卿兵少路遠，恐難收復。”懿曰：“兵不在多，在能設奇用智耳。臣託陛下洪福，必擒公孫淵以獻陛下。”叡曰：“卿料公孫淵作何舉動？”懿曰：“淵若棄城預走，是上計也；守遼東拒大軍，是中計也；坐守襄平，是為下計——必被臣所擒矣。”叡曰：“此去往復幾時？”懿曰：“四千里之地，往百日，攻百日，還百日，休息六十日，大約一年足矣。”叡曰：“倘吳、蜀入寇，如之奈何？”懿曰：“臣已定下守禦之策：陛下勿憂。”叡大喜，卽命司馬懿興師征討公孫淵。懿辭朝出城，令胡遵為先鋒，引前部兵先到遼東下寨。哨馬飛報公孫淵。淵令卑衍、楊祚分八萬兵屯於遼隧，圍塹二十餘里，環繞鹿角，甚是嚴密。胡遵令人報知司馬懿。懿笑曰：“賊不與我戰，欲老我兵耳。我料賊衆大半在此，其巢穴空虛，不若棄却此處，逕奔襄平；賊必往救，却於中途擊之，必獲全功。”於是勒兵從小路向襄平進發。,"The border officials reported that Cao Rui, the master of Wei. Rui was shocked, so he summoned Sima Yi to the court. Yi Zuo said, ""Forty thousand officers and troops under the commander's troops are enough to defeat thieves."" Rui said, ""If you have fewer troops, you may find it difficult to recover."" The minister entrusts His Majesty Hong Fu, and must capture Gongsun Yuan as a tribute to His Majesty."" Rui said, ""What do you expect Gongsun Yuan to do?"" Yi said, ""If Yuan abandons the city and leaves the city, it is the best plan; defending Liaodong and resisting the army is Zhongzhong. It’s a plan; sitting and guarding Xiangping is for the next plan—I will be captured by the officials.” Rui said, “How long does it take to go back and forth?” Yi said: “For four thousand li, go for a hundred days and attack for a hundred days. One hundred days to go and sixty days to rest, about a year is enough."" Rui said, ""If Wu and Shu join the bandits, what will happen to them?"" Yi said, ""This minister has made a policy of defending the imperial palace: Your Majesty, don't worry."" Rui said. Overjoyed, he ordered Sima Yixing to conquer Gongsun Yuan. When Yici went out of the city, he ordered Hu Zun to be the vanguard, and led the front troops to Xiazhai in Liaodong first. The sentry flies to report Gongsun Yuan. Yuan ordered Beiyan and Yang Zuo to divide 80,000 troops into the Liao Tunnel, encircling the moat for more than 20 li and surrounding the antlers, which was very tight. Hu Zun sent someone to inform Sima Yi. Yi smiled and said: ""The thieves don't fight me, they want to be old to my soldiers. I think most of the thieves are here, and their nests are empty, so why don't they abandon this place and run to Xiangping; , you will get all the credit."" So Le Bing set off from the small road to Xiangping.",Cao Rui orders Sima Yi to come to court and then despatches him to deal with the revolt of the lord of Liaodong.,"This army set out for the Middle Land. Ruler of Wei was alarmed at the report of this rising, and sent for Sima Yi. Sima Yi was not greatly perturbed, and said, “My forty thousand troops will be equal to the task.” The Ruler of Wei replied, “The task is heavy, for your troops are few and the road is long.” “The strength of an army is not in numbers, but in strategy. Aided by Your Majesty's good fortune, I shall certainly be able to bring this fellow Gongsun Yuan a captive to your feet.” “What do you think will be the rebel's plan?” asked the Ruler of Wei. “His high plan would be flight before our army can arrive; his middle plan would be defending his position in Liaodong; his low plan would be to try to hold Xiangping. In the last case I shall certainly capture him.” “How long will the expedition take?” “We have to cover one thousand five hundred miles which will take a hundred days. Attack will consume another hundred. The return will need a hundred, and with sixty days to rest we shall take a year.” “Suppose during that year we are attacked by Wu or Shu.” “My plans provide for that; Your Majesty need have no anxiety.” The Ruler of Wei being thus reassured, formally ordered Sima Yi to undertake the expedition. Hu Zun was appointed to lead the van. He went and camped in Liaodong. The scouts hastened to tell Gongsun Yuan, who sent Bei Yan and Yang Zuo to camp at Liaosui with eighty thousand troops. They surrounded their camp with a wall seven miles in circumference and placed thorny barriers outside the rampart. It seemed very secure. Hu Zun saw these preparations and sent to tell his chief. Sima Yi smiled. “So the rebel does not want to fight, but thinks to weary my soldiers,” said Sima Yi. “Now I am disposed to think that most of his army is within that wall, so that his stronghold is empty and undefended. I will make a dash at Xiangping. He will have to go to its rescue, and I will smite him on the way. I should score a great success.” So Sima Yi hastened to Xiangping along unfrequented ways."

One of the soldiers took from a passer-by a broad-brimmed hat and put it on over his helmet to keep his armor dry. Lu Meng saw it, and the offender was seized. He was a fellow-villager of Lu Meng, but that did not save him. “You are an old acquaintance, but you knew my order; why did you disobey it?” “I thought the rain would spoil my uniform, and I took the hat to protect it. I did not take it for my own advantage, but to protect official property. Spare me, O General, for the sake of our common dwelling-place.” “I know you were protecting your armor, but still it was disobedience to the order against taking anything from the people.” The soldier was beheaded, and his head exposed as a warning. But when all was over, Lu Meng had the body buried decently and wept at the grave for the loss of his friend. Never after this was there the least laxity of discipline."

Zhao followed his words and ordered Shi Bao and Zhou Taixian to lead the two armies to ambush in Stone City, and Wang Ji, Chen Qian led his elite troops behind him, but he ordered Chengli to lead tens of thousands of troops to lure the enemy first; he also ordered Chen Jun to lead chariots, oxen, horses, donkeys and mules, and load up valuables for the army, and gather in the array on all sides: if the enemy comes, abandon them. .","He ‘leaves’ supply wagons filled with grain, weapons and other materials on the edge of the battlefield. When Zhuge Dan and his Wu allies attack, the Wu soldiers, who have no real interest in the outcome of the battle, run off to loot the wagons, leaving Zhuge Dan and his men alone and exposed.","Hearing of this threatened attack, Sima Zhao sought advice from two of his officers, Advisers Pei Xiu and Zhong Hui. Zhong Hui said, “The Wu army is helping our enemies for the sake of profit, and hence we can seduce them with an offer of greater profit.” Sima Zhao agreed in this opinion and resolved accordingly. As part of his plan, he sent Shi Bao and Zhou Tai to lay ambushes in different places near Shidou. As ordered by Sima Zhao, Wang Ji and Chen Qian commanded an army of veterans on the rear, Cheng Zu led thirty thousand troops out to bring on a battle, while Chen Jun got together many wagons, herds of oxen, droves of horses, donkeys and mules, and heaps of military supplies, all of which he crowded together in the midst of the army. This stuff was meant to be abandoned as soon as the fight began, so that the enemy might be tempted to plunder."

Ying said to Liang: ""The upper armies don't make dikes. I expect the Jin army will come here. We should try our best to fight against them. If we are fortunate to win, Jiangnan will be at peace. Now we cross the river and fight, and unfortunately we lose, and the big thing will be over."" Liang said. : ""The public statement is true."" Before the words were finished, people reported that the Jin soldiers were going down the river, and it was overwhelming. The two were startled and came to see Zhang Ti to discuss. Liang said to Ti: ""Eastern Wu is in danger, why not flee?"" Ti weeped and said, ""Wu will die, and both the wise and the fool will know. Liang also wept away. Zhang Ti and Shen Ying attacked the enemy, and Jin soldiers surrounded them. Zhou Zhi first entered the Wu camp. Zhang Ti fought hard alone and died in the chaos of the army. Shen Ying was killed by Zhou Zhi. Wu Bing was scattered and defeated. Later generations have a poem to praise Zhang Ti, saying:","The Wu generals Zhuge Xing and Shen Rong gather with Prime Minister Zhang Ti and recommend surrender. However, the prime minister is realistic. ‘ Wu is finished,’ he says, ‘but to let it die without dying in battle is to dishonour our country. What shame that would bring upon us.’ Convinced by this and now united in this view, the commanders return to their troops and prepare for battle. And for death. They attack, and mighty is the slaughter. The Jin troops storm through, Shen Rong and Prime Minister Zhang Ti are slain, and at that the Wu army disintegrates.","Then the Prime Minister of Wu, Zhang Ti, sent two generals, Shen Rong and Zhuge Xing, to try to check the advance of the armies. Shen Rong said to his colleague, “The forces above have failed to stop the enemy, and the enemy will surely come here. We shall have to put forth all our strength. If haply we can succeed, the safety of our South Land is assured. But suppose we fight and lose the battle, then is our country lost.” “Sir, you only say what is too true,” said Zhuge Xing. Just as they talked of these matters came reports of the approach of their enemies in irresistible force. The two leaders were seized with panic and went back to see the Prime Minister. “Our country is lost,” cried Zhuge Xing. “Why not run?” “We all know that the land is doomed;” replied Zhang Ti, “but if we make no defense, and no one dies for his country, shall we not be shamed?” Zhuge Xing left, weeping; and Zhang Ti went with Shen Rong to the army. The invaders soon arrived, and the Jin General Zhou Zhi was the first to break into the camp. Zhang Ti resisted stubbornly, but was soon slain in a melee, and Shen Rong was killed by Zhou Zhi.

With his finger, he said: ""Dingjun Shanxi, there is a high mountain, and there are dangerous roads all around. This mountain is enough to see the reality of Dingjun Mountain. If the general takes this mountain, Dingjun Mountain will only be in the palm of your hand."" Looking up, I saw that the top of the mountain was slightly flat, and there were few people on the mountain. It was the second watch of the night, and the sergeant Zhongyin played gold and drummed, and went straight to the top of the mountain. This mountain is guarded by Xiahou Yuan's general Du Xi, and there are more than a few hundred people. At that time, seeing Huang Zhong's brigade embracing him, he had to abandon the mountain and leave. Zhong won the top of the mountain, which is opposite to Dingjun Mountain. Fazheng said: ""The general can be guarded in the middle of the mountain, somewhere on the top of the mountain. When Xiahou Yuan's army arrives, I will raise the white flag as the number, but the general will not move; ; Treat labor with ease, and you must win."" Zhong was overjoyed and followed his plan.","Meanwhile a mountain fort opposite the main supply camp at Dingjun mountain has been captured by the forces of Shu. Reviewing the scene from this vantage point, Huang Zhong can see how to trap and defeat his enemy.","Before long, Huang Zhong had got quite near to Xiahou Yuan's camp, and then he asked further advice from his colleague. Fa Zheng pointed over to the hills and said, “There rises a steep hill on the west of Dingjun Mountain, difficult of access, but from its summit one has a complete view of the defenses of the enemy. If you can take this hill, the mountain lies in the hollow of your hand.” Huang Zhong looked up and saw the top of the hill was a small tableland and there were very few defenders there. So that evening he left his camp, dashed up the hill, drove out the small host of one hundred under Xiahou Yuan's General Du Xi and took it. It was just opposite to Dingjun Mountain. Then said Fa Zheng, “Now take up position half way up the hill, while I go to the top. When the enemy appears, I will show a white flag. But you will remain quiet till the enemy become tired and remiss, when I will hoist a red flag. That will be the signal for attack.” Huang Zhong cheerfully prepared to act on this plan."

I will come to meet you later.""","When the Wei emperor, Cao Pi, hears about these manoeuvres, he roars with laughter, saying that Xuande is a fool and that within ten days he will be defeated. He sends orders to his own front lines to be ready to attack Wu when the south is fully engaged in defeating the army of Shu.","The Ruler of Wei laughed aloud when he heard the details of the long line of camps and the encampments among the trees and all this. “Liu Bei is going to be defeated,” said he. “How do you know?” asked his courtiers. “Because Liu Bei does not know how to wage war. How can he beat off an enemy along a front of two hundred miles? The maxims of war forbid to camp in open plains, among marshes, amid precipitous heights and obstacles. He will be defeated at the hand of Lu Xun, and we shall hear of it in about ten days.” His officers felt more than doubtful and entreated their master to prepare an army. But the Ruler of Wei replied, “If successful, Lu Xun will lead all his force westward into the Western Land of Rivers, and his country will be defenseless. I shall pretend to send an army to help. I shall send them in three divisions, and I shall overcome Wu easily.” They all bowed acquiescence and approval. Then orders went out appointing Cao Ren to lead an army out by Ruxu, Cao Xiu to take a second out by Dongkou, and Cao Zhen to command a third to go through Nanjun, and the three armies were to combine on a given date for a sudden attack on Wu."
魏兵數萬入川來，後主偷生失自裁。,"Tens of thousands of Wei soldiers came to Sichuan, and the late master committed suicide.","Yet he still seems here, awesome, ever present,","Wei's legions entered Shu, And the ruler thereof saved his life At the price of his honor and his throne."
却說張飛在閬中，聞知關公被東吳所害，旦夕號泣，血濕衣襟。諸將以酒勸解，酒醉，怒氣愈加。帳上帳下，但有犯者卽鞭撻之；多有鞭死者。每日望南切齒睜目怒恨，放聲痛哭不已。忽報使至，慌忙接入，開讀詔旨。飛受爵望北拜畢，設酒款待來使。飛曰：“吾兄被害，讎深似海；廟堂之臣，何不早奏興兵？”使者曰：“多有勸先滅魏而後伐吳者。”飛怒曰：“是何言也！昔我三人桃園結義，誓同生死；今不幸二兄半途而逝，吾安得獨享富貴耶！吾當面見天子，願為前部先鋒，挂孝伐吳，生擒逆賊，祭告二兄，以踐前盟！”言訖，就同使命望成都而來。,"However, he said that Zhang Fei was in Langzhong, and when he heard that Guan Gong was murdered by Soochow Wu, he cried every night, and the front of his clothes was wet with blood. The generals tried to persuade them with wine, and they got drunk and became more angry. The tent is on the tent and the tent is under the tent, but some offenders are whipped; many are whipped to death. Every day, Wang Nan gnashed his teeth and opened his eyes with anger and hatred, and burst into tears. Suddenly the report came, hurried access, and read the edict. Fei received the honor from the North, and set up a wine to entertain him. Fei said: ""My brother was murdered, and the depths of the sea are like the sea; why didn't the ministers of the temple call for an early battle?"" The three of us are in Taoyuan, vowing to live and die together; unfortunately, my second brother passed away halfway, and I can enjoy the wealth and honor alone! I will meet the emperor face to face, and I would like to be the vanguard of the front, with filial piety to attack Wu, to capture the rebels alive, and to sacrifice to the second brother. To practice the former alliance!"" After saying this, he came to Chengdu with the same mission.","Zhang Fei is based in Langzhong when the news is brought to him of the death of Guan Yu. For days he weeps and rages, blood mingling with his tears until his clothes are soaked. His officers try calming him with wine, but this simply increases his rage. So angry is he that he has many of those around him flogged for no reason – often so badly that they die. His relief on being made the supreme commander for the revenge attack brings a degree of calmness, and yet he is still deeply unsettled to hear that in the first ruler’s court many oppose this war in favour of first attacking Wei. Troubled by this, he sets off for Chengdu to see the new emperor, his brother.","When Zhang Fei heard the tidings of Guan Yu's death at the hands of Sun Quan, he wept very bitterly day and night, so that his raiment was soaked with his tears. His subordinates tried to cheer him with wine, but he over-drank, and this increased his ill-humor, which he vented on any offender in his camp. Some of his people even died under the lash. Every day he gazed southward, grinding his teeth with rage and glaring. He wept and groaned without ceasing. Then a messenger was announced. He was summoned immediately, and Zhang Fei at once tore open and read his dispatches. When Zhang Fei read the edict, he accepted his new rank in all humility, bowing northward toward the imperial mandate. Then he gave a banquet to the messenger. He said, “My enmity for the death of my brother is deep as the sea. Why do not the officers at the court propose an avenging expedition?” The messenger replied, “Most of them favor first the destruction of Wei; Wu is to follow.” “What sort of talk is this?” cried Zhang Fei angrily. “ When we three swore brotherhood in the Peach Garden, we pledged ourselves to die together. Now, alas! my brother has perished by the way, and can we enjoy wealth or honors without him? I must see the Son of Heaven and pray to be allowed to lead the van. I will wear mourning, and in that garb I will smite Wu and capture the bandit that rules there. Sun Quan shall be sacrificed to my brother's manes in virtue of our oath.” Zhang Fei accompanied the messenger to Capital Chengdu."
孔明曰：“汝欲鬥將？鬥兵？鬥陣法？”懿曰：“先鬥陣法。”孔明曰：“先布陣我看。”懿入中軍帳下，手執黃旗招颭，左右軍動，排成一陣，復上馬出陣，問曰：“汝識吾陣否？”孔明笑曰：“吾軍中末將，亦能布之！此乃‘混元一氣陣’也。”懿曰：“汝布陣我看。”孔明入陣，把羽扇一搖，復出陣前，問曰：“汝識我陣否？”懿曰：“量此‘八卦陣’，如何不識！”孔明曰：“識便識了，敢打我陣否？”懿曰：“旣識之，如何不敢打！”孔明曰：“汝只管打來。”司馬懿回到本陣中，喚戴陵、張虎、樂綝三將，分付曰：“今孔明所布之陣，按休、生、傷、杜、景、死、驚、開八門。汝三人可從正東生門打入，往西南休門殺出，復從正北開門殺入：此陣可破。汝等小心在意！”於是戴陵在中，張虎在前，樂綝在後，各引三十騎，從生門打入。兩軍吶喊相助。三人殺入蜀陣，只見陣如連城，衝突不出。三人慌引騎轉過陣脚，往西南衝去，却被蜀兵射住，衝突不出。陣中重重疊疊，都有門戶，那裏分東西南北？三將不能相顧，只管亂撞，但見愁雲漠漠，慘霧濛濛。喊聲起處，魏軍一個個皆被縛了，送到中軍。孔明坐於帳中，左右將張虎、戴陵、樂綝并九十個軍，皆縛在帳下。孔明笑曰：“吾縱然捉得汝等，何足為奇！吾放汝等回見司馬懿，敎他再讀兵書，重觀戰策，那時來決雌雄，未為遲也。汝等性命旣饒，當留下軍器戰馬。”遂將衆人衣服脫了，以墨塗面，步行出陣。司馬懿見之大怒，回顧諸將曰：“如此挫敗銳氣，有何面目回見中原大臣耶！”卽指揮三軍，奮死掠陣。懿自拔劍在手，引百餘驍將，催督衝殺。兩軍恰纔相會，忽然陣後鼓角齊鳴，喊聲大震，一彪軍從西南上殺來：乃關興也。懿分後軍當之，復催軍向前廝殺。忽然魏兵大亂：原來姜維引一彪軍悄地殺來。蜀兵三路夾攻，懿大驚，急忙退軍。蜀兵周圍殺到，懿引三軍望南死命衝出。魏兵十傷六七。司馬懿退在渭濱南岸下寨，堅守不出。,"Kong Ming said, ""Do you want to fight generals? Fight soldiers? Fight formations?"" Yi said, ""Fight formations first."" Kong Ming said, ""Let me see the formation first."" , the army moved from left to right, lined up in a formation, and then mounted the horse to go into battle, and asked, ""Do you know my formation?"" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""The last general in my army can also deploy it! This is also a 'Hunyuan Yiqi formation'. ""Yi said, ""I'll see if you set up the formation."" Kong Ming entered the formation, shook his feather fan, and before returning to the formation, he asked, ""Do you know my formation?"" Yi said, ""I measure this 'Bagua formation', how can I not know it? !"" Kong Ming said, ""If you know it, do you dare to fight me?"" Yi said, ""You know it, why don't you dare to fight!"" Kong Ming said, ""Just call me."" Sima Yi returned to his main formation and called Dai The three generals Ling, Zhang Hu, and Le Chen distributed them and said, ""The formation that Kongming has set up now has eight gates: break, life, wound, du, scene, death, fright, and open. You three can fight from the gate to the east. Enter, go to Xiumen in the southwest and go out, and then open the door from the north and enter: this formation can be broken. You are careful!"" So Dai Ling was in the middle, Zhang Hu was in the front, and Le Chen was in the back, and each led thirty cavalry. Enter through the gate. The two armies shouted for help. The three of them entered the Shu formation, only to see that the formation was like a city, and there was no conflict. The three of them turned around in panic and rushed to the southwest, but they were shot by the Shu soldiers, and there was no conflict. The arrays are overlapping and there are portals, where are they divided into east, west, north and south? The three generals couldn't care for each other, and they just bumped into each other, but they saw a cloud of sadness and mist. At the beginning of the shouting, the Wei troops were all tied up one by one and sent to the central army. Kong Ming was seated in the tent, and Zhang Hu, Dai Ling, Le Chen and ninety troops were all bound under the tent. Kong Ming smiled and said: ""Even if I capture you, it's not too surprising! I will let you go back to see Sima Yi, and I will teach him to read the military book again, and pay attention to the battle strategy. It's not too late to decide whether you are male or female. Your life is at stake. Rao, leave the weapons and horses behind."" Then they took off their clothes, painted their faces with ink, and marched out on foot. Sima Yi was furious when he saw this, and he looked back at the generals and said, ""How can you see the minister of the Central Plains in such a defeated spirit!"" You commanded the three armies and fought to death. Yi Zi drew his sword in his hand, led more than a hundred generals, and urged the governor to rush to kill. The two armies just met, and suddenly the drums and horns rang in unison after the battle, and the shouts were loud, and a Biao army came from the southwest: it was Guan Xing. Yifen's army took the lead, and Fu urged the army to fight forward. Suddenly, the Wei soldiers were in chaos: it turned out that Jiang Wei led a Biao army to kill him quietly. When the Shu soldiers attacked from three directions, Yi was shocked and hurriedly retreated. When the soldiers of Shu came around, Yi led the three armies to Wang Nan and rushed out desperately. Six or seven of the Wei soldiers were wounded. Sima Yi retreated to the south bank of Weibin and settled down, but could not hold on.","Kong Ming challenges Sima Yi to a battle of military strategies. Each side uses extraordinary formations based on mystical ideas and texts. Kong Ming uses one based upon the Eight Trigrams of the Yi Jing and draws the enemy into a supernatural maze, which ends in total defeat for Sima Yi. As a result Kong Ming captures the three leading commanders, Zhang Hu, Dai Ling and Yue Chen. Brought before Kong Ming, he dismisses them and sends them back with a message for Sima Yi. ‘Tell him to do more study on military matters and then try to remember them.’ So saying, he gives them and their captured officers their weapons but strips the soldiers, blackens their faces and sends them back humiliated. This simply provokes Sima Yi into launching his entire force at the Shu army. But once again Kong Ming has foreseen this, and an attack led by Guan Xing from the rear scatters the Wei army. It is said that six or seven out of every ten men in the Wei army died that day. With no other option, Sima Yi retreats to the south side of the Wei River and does not appear again.","“Do you desire a contest of generals, or of weapons, or of battle array?” asked Zhuge Liang. “Let us try a contest of battle array,” replied Sima Yi. “Then draw up your array that I may see,” said Zhuge Liang. Sima Yi withdrew within the line and signaled to his officers with a yellow flag to draw up their troops. When he had finished, he rode again to the front, saying, “Do you recognize my formation?” “The least of my generals can do as well,” said Zhuge Liang, smiling. “This is called the 'Disorder-in-Order' formation.” “Now you try while I look on,” said Sima Yi. Zhuge Liang entered the lines and waved his fan. Then he came out and said, “Do you recognize that?” “Of course; this is the 'Eight Arrays.'“ “Yes; you seem to know it. But dare you attack?” “Why not, since I know it?” replied Sima Yi. “Then you need only try.” Sima Yi entered the ranks and called to him three generals—Dai Ling, Zhang Hu, and Yue Chen—to whom he said, “That formation consists of eight gates—Birth, Exit, Expanse, Wound, Fear, Annihilation, Obstacle, and Death. You will go in from the east at the Gate of Birth, turn to the southwest and make your way out by the Gate of Annihilation. Then enter at the north, at the Exit Gate, and the formation will be broken up. But be cautious.” They started with Zhang Hu leading, Dai Ling next, and Yue Chen in rear, each with thirty horsemen. They made their way in at the Gate of Birth amid the applause of both sides. But when they had got within they found themselves facing a wall of troops and could not find a way out. They hastily led their men round by the base of the line toward the southwest to rush out there. But they were stopped by a flight of arrows. They became confused and saw many gates, but they had lost their bearings. Nor could they aid each other. They dashed hither and thither in disorder, lose as in gathering clouds and rolling mists. Then a shout arose, and each one was seized and bound. They were taken to the center, where Zhuge Liang sat in his tent, and the three leaders with their ninety men were ranged in front. “Indeed you are prisoners; are you surprised” said Zhuge Liang, smiling. “But I will set you free to return to your leader, and tell him to read his books again, and study his tactics, before he comes to try conclusions with me. You are pardoned, but leave your weapons and horses here.” So they were stripped of their arms and armors and their faces inked. Thus were they led on foot out of the array. Sima Yi lost his temper at sight of his people thus put to shame. Said he, “After this disgrace, how can I face the other officers in the Middle Land?” He gave the signal for the army to fall on and attack the enemy, and, grasping his sword, led his brave generals into the fray and commanded the attack. But just as the two armies came to blows, Guan Xing came up, his drums rolling and troops shouting, and attacked. Sima Yi told off a division from the rear to oppose Guan Xing, and again turned to urge on his main body. Then the army of Wei was thrown into confusion by another attack from Jiang Wei, who came up silently and joined in the battle. Thus three sides of the Wei army were attacked by three different divisions of the enemy, and Sima Yi decided to retire. However, this was difficult. The soldiers of Shu hemmed him in and came closer every moment. At last, by a desperate push, he cut an arterial alley toward the south and freed his army. But he had lost six or seven out of every ten of his soldiers. The Wei army withdrew to the south bank of River Wei and camped. They strengthened their position and remained entirely on the defensive."

Wei Yan secretly sent people to find out when Huang Zhong was raising troops. The detective reported: ""In the next day, the fourth shift will make rice, and the fifth shift will raise troops."" Wei Yan secretly rejoiced. When the sergeant received the order, they all had a full meal, the horses picked the bells, the men were given their titles, the flags and armor were rolled up, and they went to the robbery in secret. Before and after the third watch, move forward from the village. Halfway through the road, Wei Yan immediately thought: ""Only go to Dengxianzhai, you won't be able to do anything; it's better to go to Lengbaozhai first, but you will attack Dengxianzhai with the victorious troops. The credit for both places is mine."" Order, the sergeant all cast into the mountain road on the left. The sky was twilight, not far from Lengbaozhai, and the sergeants were instructed to take a rest, arranging golden drums, flags, banners, guns and knives.","Wei Yan, having learned from his spies that Huang Zhong will depart at the fourth watch, sets off silently with his men at the third watch. Driven by jealousy, he decides that, having gained the time advantage, he will not only attack the camp he was given, that of Deng Xian, but start by taking Huang Zhong’s target of the camp of Ling Bao. It is a disaster. Ling Bao’s men hear them coming and spring a counter-attack.","After having received the command to take one of the camps, Huang Zhong went to his own camp and issued orders for the morning meal to be ready very early, and for every one to be in marching order by daybreak. When the time arrived, his army set out, taking the road through a gully to the left of the hills. But early as Huang Zhong started, his rival had stolen a march on him. Wei Yan had sent over the night before to find out the hour fixed for Huang Zhong's start and had arranged his own departure a watch earlier, by which he would be able to reach his objective at dawn. After Wei Yan's troops had taken their early meal, they removed the bells from the horses end put gags in their own mouths to prevent talking, and all-silently the army stole out of the camp just as the other party were eating their breakfast. The ensigns were furled and weapons covered lest the glint of steel should betray their movement. Thus far successful in getting the start of his rival, Wei Yan thought as he rode along what a fine score he would make if he anticipated Huang Zhong also in his attack and captured the camp of Ling Bao before Huang Zhong could get there. Wei Yan at once deviated from his own line and marched toward the camp defended by Ling Bao, of which the capture had been assigned to Huang Zhong. Just before arrival, Wei Yan halted his troops and bade them prepare the drums and ensigns and their weapons."

Liu Xuan cursed in the city. Yan Yanfang was about to take an arrow and shoot at him, when suddenly he saw a general in the city, he drew his sword and cut down Liu Xuan and opened the door to surrender. Xuande's army entered Luocheng, and Liu Xun opened the west gate to escape and went to Chengdu. Xuande came out of the list to settle down. The person who killed Liu Xuan was Zhang Yi from Wuyang. Xuande won Luocheng and rewarded the generals. Kong Ming said: ""Luocheng has been destroyed, and Chengdu is only at present; I am afraid that other prefectures and counties will be disturbed. You can order Zhang Yi and Wu Yi to lead Zhao Yun to Fuwaishui Jiangyang, Qianwei and other prefectures and counties, and order Yan Yan and Zhuo Ying to lead Zhang Fei. Appease the prefectures and counties to which Deyang belongs to the Basilica; then the commissioner will make peace, and the troops will return to Chengdu to take them all."" Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun took the orders and led their troops there. Kong Ming asked: ""Where can I go?"" The generals in Shu Zhong said, ""There are heavy troops to defend Mianzhu; if Mianzhu is obtained, Chengdu will be within easy reach."" Kong Ming then discussed the advance of troops. Fazheng said: ""Luocheng is broken, and the middle of Shu is in danger. If the lord wants to subdue the people with benevolence and righteousness, he should not enter the army. In a book, Liu Zhang stated the advantages and disadvantages, and Zhang will naturally descend."" Kong Ming said: ""The words of filial piety and uprightness. The best."" He ordered the writing of a book and sent people to Chengdu.","The army now move to the walls of Luocheng, and Xuande calls for the city to surrender. The gate is thrown open, and Xuande rides in to take his prize. As they enter the city by one gate, Liu Zhang’s son Liu Xun flees through the opposite gate and takes the news to Chengdu. As he consults with his father, a letter arrives from Fa Zheng, who has suggested to Xuande that he try to persuade Liu Zhang to submit.","Next day the army moved on to Luocheng, Yan Yan and the other generals who had submitted leading the way. At the gate they hailed the wardens and called upon them to surrender, whereby the city should be saved from utter destruction. From the wall, Liu Gui abused the treacherous Yan Yan and took his bow to shoot. But just as Liu Gui was fitting the arrow to the string, another man cut him down. Soon the gates were thrown open and the city had yielded. As Liu Bei entered the city by one gate, Liu Xun, who had shared the command of the city, escaped by another gate and set off for Chengdu. Liu Bei put forth proclamations to allay the fears of the inhabitants of the city. He inquired who had been on his side in cutting down Liu Gui and was told it was Zhang Yi of Wuyang. Zhang Yi and all who had helped in the capture were amply rewarded. “Our next city is Chengdu,” said Zhuge Liang. “However, in the meantime there may be some trouble in pacifying the outlying counties, and hence it will be well for you to send Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun with Wu Yi, Zhang Yi, Yan Yan, and Zhuo Ying leading the way, into the country along the river and Changyang, Deyang, and Baxi to reassure the people and to repress any rising that may take place. There will be no need for any especial precautions in the neighborhood of Chengdu.” The warriors went their ways, and then Zhuge Liang began to make careful inquiries concerning the road to Chengdu. Those who had given in their allegiance to the invaders said, “The only place where you can expect any serious defense is Mianzhu. Once you have passed this, the capital lies at your mercy.” Then Fa Zheng was consulted. Said he, “With the fall of Luocheng, the Western Land of Rivers passed to you. Let our lord only deal with the people kindly and justly, and there will be no need of weapons. I can write such a letter to Imperial Protector Liu Zhang as shall make him surrender at call.” “That would be most excellent,” said Zhuge Liang. The letter was written and sent by the hand of a messenger."

於是大賞蠻兵。正欲起程，忽報洞後迤西銀冶洞二十一洞主楊鋒引三萬兵來助戰。孟獲大喜曰：“鄰兵助我，我必勝矣！”卽與朶思大王出洞迎接。楊鋒引兵入曰：“吾有精兵三萬，皆披鐵甲，能飛山越嶺，足以敵蜀兵百萬；我有五子，皆武藝足備：願助大王。”鋒令五子入拜，皆彪軀虎體，威風抖擻。孟獲大喜，遂設席相待楊鋒父子。酒至半酣，鋒曰：“軍中少樂，吾隨軍有蠻姑，善舞刀牌，以助一笑。”獲忻然從之。須臾，數十蠻姑，皆披髮跣足，從帳外舞跳而入。羣蠻拍手以歌和之。楊鋒令二子把盞。二子舉盃詣孟獲、孟優前。二人接盃，方欲飲酒，鋒大喝一聲，二子早將孟獲、孟優執下座來。朶思大王却待要走，已被楊鋒擒了。蠻姑橫截於帳上，誰敢近前，獲曰：“‘兔死狐悲，物傷其類’。吾與汝皆是各洞之主，往日無寃，何故害我？”鋒曰：“吾兄弟子姪皆感諸葛丞相活命之恩，無可以報。今汝反叛，何不擒獻？”,"So reward the barbarians. Just as he was about to set off, Yang Feng, the master of the twenty-one cave in Yinye Cave in the west, led 30,000 soldiers to help the battle. Meng Huo was overjoyed and said, ""The neighbor soldiers help me, and I will win!"" You and King Duosi went out of the cave to greet him. Yang Feng led the troops in and said, ""I have 30,000 elite soldiers, all of them wearing iron armor, capable of flying over mountains and mountains, enough to defeat millions of Shu soldiers; I have five sons, all of whom are skilled in martial arts: I would like to help the king."" Feng ordered the five sons to worship, They are all sturdy and tiger-like, and they are majestic. Meng Huo was overjoyed, so he set up a table to treat Yang Feng and his son. When the wine was half full, Feng said: ""Shao Le in the army, I have a barbarian girl with the army, who is good at dancing swords and cards to help a smile."" After a short while, dozens of aunts, all wearing hair and legs, danced in from outside the tent. The crowd clapped their hands to reconcile them with songs. Yang Feng ordered the second son to hold the cup. The two sons raised their glasses to Meng Huo and Meng Youqian. The two took the cup, Fang wanted to drink, Feng shouted loudly, and the two sons had already taken Meng Huo and Meng Youzhi off the table. But King Duo Si was about to leave and was captured by Yang Feng. Man Gu crossed the tent, and whoever dared to come forward said: ""'The rabbit dies and the fox is sad, and the thing hurts its kind'. You and I are both the masters of the caves. There was no injustice in the past, why did you hurt me?"" Feng said: ""My brother and son My sister-in-law appreciates the grace of Prime Minister Zhuge for his life, and there is nothing to repay. Now that you are rebelling, why don't you capture it and offer it?""","A grand feast is held to encourage the warriors, and in the midst of this another chieftain, Yang Feng, head of twenty-one tribes from another valley, arrives, pledging his men – some thirty thousand of them – to the struggle. Soon everyone is very drunk, and at this point Yang Feng suggests that they need dancing women and that his women dance the sword and shield dance better than anyone else. So in they come, along with his five warrior sons. Two of Yang Feng’s sons bring cups of wine to the Meng brothers but then, at a cry from Yang Feng, leap forward and seize the pair of them. King Duosi tries to flee but is grabbed by Yang Feng. The dancing women have suddenly become warriors to prevent anyone else coming into the tent. ‘Why?’ asks Meng Huo, who is completely taken aback. ‘Because we owe Kong Ming the lives of our brothers and sons, whom he freed. We must honour his kindness, and bringing a rebel to him is how we will do this.’","So there was great feasting before the Mangs took the field. Just as this was going on, there arrived one Yang Feng, King of twenty-one ravines in the west, and he led thirty thousand troops. Meng Huo rejoiced exceedingly at this unexpected addition to his army and felt sure of victory. So he and Duo Si went out of their own valley to welcome Yang Feng, who said, “I have with me thirty thousand troops in iron mail, brave and intrepid warriors, who can fly over mountains and bound across the peaks; they of themselves are a match for the enemy even if the enemy numbered a hundred legions. And, moreover, my five sons, all trained in arms, are with me, all to help you, O Kings.” The five sons were brought in and presented. They were handsome young fellows, bold and martial looking. Father and sons were entertained at a banquet. Halfway through the feast Yang Feng proposed a diversion. “There is but scanty amusement in the field,” said Yang Feng, “ and so I have brought along some native singing girls who have been taught fencing and such things. If you care for it, they might give an exhibition.” The feasters hailed the suggestion with joy, and soon thirty maidens came to the front of the tent. Their hair hung about their shoulders, and they were barefooted. They danced and skipped and went through their performance outside. The guests inside clapped their hands and applauded their skill, and the soldiers joined in the choruses. Presently, at a signal from their father, two of Yang Feng's sons bore two goblets to Meng Huo and Meng You. Meng Huo and Meng You took the cups and were raising them to their lips when Yang Feng shouted a single word of command, and, instantly, the cupbearers had the two brothers out of their seats and helpless in their hands. At this, Duo Si jumped up to run away, but Yang Feng gripped him, and he was a prisoner too. The Mang maidens ranged themselves in a line along the front of the tent so that none dared approach. “When the hare dies the fox mourns,” said Meng Huo. “One sympathizes with one's own as a rule. We are both chiefs and have been friends. I know not why you should injure me.” “I had to repay Zhuge Liang the Minister for his compassion on me and my people, and there was no way till you rebelled. Why should I not offer up a rebel in propitiation?”"

是夜二更，忠引五千軍開關直下。原來夏侯尚、韓浩二將連日見關上不出，盡皆懈怠；被黃忠破寨直入，人不及甲，馬不及鞍，二將各自逃命而走，軍馬自相踐踏，死者無數。比及天明，連奪三寨。寨中丟下軍器鞍馬無數，盡敎孟達搬運入關。黃忠催軍馬隨後而進。劉封曰：“軍士力困，可以暫歇。”忠曰：“‘不入虎穴，焉得虎子？’”策馬先進。士卒皆努力向前。張郃軍兵，反被自家敗兵衝動，都屯紮不住，望後而走；盡棄了許多寨柵，直奔至漢水傍。,"It was the second watch of the night, and Zhongyin five thousand soldiers went straight down. It turned out that the two generals, Xiahoushang and Han Hao, had been out of the gate for several days, and they were all slack. When Huang Zhong broke the fort and went straight in, the men were not as good as the armor, and the horses were not as good as the saddle. Compared with Tianming, he won three villages in a row. In the village, countless weapons and pommel horses were thrown away, and Mengda was instructed to carry them into the customs. Huang Zhong urged the troops to follow. Liu Feng said: ""The soldiers are exhausted, so they can rest for a while."" Zhong said: ""'If you don't enter the tiger's den, how can you get the tiger's son?'"" The horse advanced. The soldiers all worked hard to move forward. Zhang He's soldiers, however, were impelled by their own defeated soldiers. They couldn't hold back and walked away. They abandoned many of the gates and went straight to the Han River.","Zhang He realizes that the supply base at Tiandang is now under real threat and that if it falls then Hanzhong will fall. He and Xiahou Shang therefore take their men to Tiandang and join up with Xiahou De, who is already based there. Initially Xiahou De suggests they sally forth together and attack Huang Zhong. ‘ No,’ replies Zhang He, ‘we need to defend not attack at this time.’ No sooner has this been said than the war drums of Huang Zhong resound around the hills, and the enemy is at the gates. ‘What an old fool,’ says Xiahou De, ‘fancying going straight into an attack when his men must be worn out from their march.’ ‘Don’t underestimate the old man,’ replies Zhang He. ‘Our strategy must be to defend, not attack.’ ‘Just let me attack with three thousand men,’ says Han Hao, ‘and I will triumph!’","That same night, at the second watch, Huang Zhong left the Pass with five thousand troops. But now Xiahou Shang and Han Hao, seeing no move from the Pass for many days, had become careless and so their camps were unable to resist. Their troops had no time to don their armors or to saddle their horses. All the leaders did was to flee for their lives, while their troops trampled each other down and were killed in great numbers. All three camps were recovered by dawn, and in them were found all sorts of military equipment. Horses and their caparisons also fell to the victors, and all the booty was carried off by Meng Da and stored in the Pass. Huang Zhong pressed on his victory. Liu Feng ventured to say, “Our soldiers need repose.” “Can you seize the tiger's whelps without going into the tiger's den?” cried Huang Zhong. And he urged on his steed. The soldiers also were eager. Zhang He's own army was thrown into confusion by the flying men from the defeated armies, and he could not maintain his station, but was forced to retreat. They abandoned all their stockades and rushed to the bank of River Han."
※※※,※※※,"When news of this advance on Jiameng pass reaches Xuande, he and Kong Ming hold a council to decide how to respond.",They were at variance—
衆皆拜謝而去；回到本寨，入見高定，說知此事。定乃密遣人去雍闓寨中探聽，却有一半放回的人，言說孔明之德；因此雍闓部軍，多有歸順高定之心。雖然如此，高定心中不穩，又令一人來孔明寨中探聽虛實；被伏路軍捉來見孔明。孔明故意認做雍闓的人，喚入帳中問曰：“汝元帥旣約下獻高定、朱褒二人首級，因何誤了日期？汝這廝不精細，如何做得細作！”軍士含糊答應。孔明以酒食賜之，修密書一封，付軍士曰：“汝持此書付雍闓，敎他早早下手，休得誤事。”細作拜謝而去，回見高定，呈上孔明之書，說雍闓如此如此。定看書畢，大怒曰：“吾以眞心待之，彼反欲害吾，情理難容！”便喚鄂煥商議。煥曰：“孔明乃仁人，背之不祥。我等謀反作惡，皆雍闓之故；不如殺闓以投孔明。”定曰：“如何下手？”煥曰：“可設一席，令人去請雍闓，彼若無異心，必坦然而來；若其不來，必有異心。我主可攻其前，某伏於寨後小路候之，闓可擒矣。”高定從其言，設席請雍闓。闓果疑前日放回軍士之言，懼而不來。是夜高定引兵殺投雍闓寨中。原來有孔明放回免死的人，皆想高定之德，乘勢助戰。雍闓軍不戰自亂。闓上馬望山路而走。行不二里，鼓聲響處，一彪軍出，乃鄂煥也：挺方天戟，驟馬當先。雍闓措手不及，被煥一戟刺於馬下，就梟其首級。闓部下軍士皆降高定。定引兩部軍來降孔明，獻雍闓首級於帳下。孔明高坐於帳上，喝令左右推轉高定，斬首報來。定曰：“某感丞相大恩，今將雍闓首級來降，何故斬也？”孔明大笑曰：“汝來詐降。敢瞞吾耶！”定曰：“丞相何以知吾詐降？”孔明於匣中取出一緘，與高定曰：“朱褒已使人密獻降書，說你與雍闓結生死之交，豈肯一旦便殺此人？吾故知汝詐也。”定叫屈曰：“朱褒乃反間之計也：丞相切不可信！”孔明曰：“吾亦難憑一面之詞。汝若捉得朱褒，方表眞心。”定曰：“丞相休疑。某生擒朱褒來見丞相，若何？”孔明曰：“若如此，吾疑心方息也。”,"Everyone thanked them and left; they returned to the village, went to see Gaoding, and said they knew about it. Ding Nai secretly sent people to investigate in Yongkai Village, but half of the people who were released back talked about the virtues of Kongming; therefore, most of the Yongkai troops had the heart to submit to Gao Ding. Even so, Gao Ding's heart was not stable, and he ordered another person to come to Kongming Village to inquire about the truth; he was captured by the Fulu Army and came to see Kongming. Kong Ming deliberately identified himself as Yong Kai's, and he called into the tent and asked, ""Marshal Ru ordered to present the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao, why did you miss the date? You are not meticulous, how can you do meticulous work! ' the sergeant agreed vaguely. Kong Ming presented him with food and wine, and a secret book. Fu Jun said: ""You hold this book to pay Yongkai, and tell him to start early, so he won't make a mistake."" Xi Zuo thanked him and left, returned to Gao Ding, and presented Kong Ming's book, saying Yong Kai is like this. When he finished reading the book, he was furious and said, ""I treat him with sincerity, but he wants to hurt me, which is hard to bear!"" He called E Huan to discuss it. Huan said: ""Kongming is a benevolent person, and his back is ominous. We all conspire against and commit evil because of Yong Kai; it is better to kill Kai to cast Kong Ming."" Ding said: ""How to start?"" Huan said: ""You can set up a seat, let people Go to invite Yong Kai, if he has no dissent, he will come calmly; if he does not come, he must have dissent. My lord can attack him, and someone will lie in the back of the village and wait for him, and Kai can be captured."" Gao Ding followed his words. , Set up a seat, please Yong Kai. Kai Guo doubted that the sergeant's words were released the day before, and was afraid and did not come. It was Ye Gao who led troops to kill and throw them into Yongkai Village. It turned out that the people who Kong Ming released to avoid death all wanted to have high morality and take advantage of the situation to help in the battle. Yongkai's army was in chaos without fighting. Kai went up Mawangshan Road and walked. After walking for two miles, where the drums were sounding, a Biao army came out, and it was E Huan, who stood up to Fang Tianji, and suddenly the horse took the lead. Yong Kai was caught off guard and was stabbed under the horse by Huan's halberd, and he slapped his head. Kai's subordinate sergeants all downgraded. Ding led two troops to surrender to Kongming, and presented Yong Kai's head under the tent. Kong Ming sat high on the tent, ordered him to turn around and beheaded. Ding said: ""I am grateful for the great kindness of the Prime Minister, and now I will surrender Yong Kai's head. Why is it that I am beheading him?"" Kong Ming laughed and said, ""You have surrendered. Kong Ming took out a seal from the box and said to Gao Ding, ""Zhu Bao has sent someone a secret letter of surrender, saying that you and Yong Kai formed a life-and-death friendship, how would you be willing to kill this person once? I know that you are cheating."" Ding called Qu and said, ""Zhu Bao is a counter-strategic: the prime minister is not credible!"" Kong Ming said, ""It is difficult for me to rely on one-sided words. If you catch Zhu Bao, you will show your sincerity."" Ding said: ""The prime minister will not be suspicious. A certain person captured Zhu Bao and came to see the prime minister, what is it?"" Kong Ming said, ""If this is the case, then my doubts will rest.""","However, he lets them know that someone has come to him from Yong Kai, offering to bring the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao in order to obtain pardon. This, of course, sets rumours running when the released soldiers return to the rebel camps. The rumours increase Gao Ding’s fears. But he is still really uncertain about whether to surrender to Kong Ming. So he sends a spy into the Shu army camp. The spy is captured, and in a further act of deception, Kong Ming pretends to believe that he is a messenger from Yong Kai. ‘ Where are the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao that your master promised me?’ demands Kong Ming. The spy, thoroughly confused but desperate to save his own life, mumbles vaguely and inaudibly. ‘ Take this letter to your master,’ says Kong Ming, ‘and tell him to act now before it is too late!’ Simply happy to escape, the spy kowtows and returns post haste to Gao Ding, to whom he presents the letter. The fake letter has exactly the effect Kong Ming hoped. Gao Ding decides to kill Yong Kai and surrender to Kong Ming. Together with E Huan, he plans the murder of Yong Kai. He invites him to a banquet, but, when he does not turn up, Gao Ding knows that there is a plot and so with E Huan he attacks Yong Kai ’s camp. As most of the men guarding the camp are the same as those released by Kong Ming, ‘thinking’ they were Gao Ding’s men, they rally to Gao Ding’s side. Although Yong Kai manages at first to escape, he is hunted down and killed by E Huan in an ambush. Gao Ding turns up at Kong Ming’s camp with the head of Yong Kai. With him come his own men and the men of Yong Kai. But Kong Ming has a further trick up his sleeve. ‘Do you think you can fool me?’ demands Kong Ming. ‘Zhu Bao has sent a secret letter offering to surrender and warning me that you and Yong Kai are so close nothing will part you. So what treason is this that you kill him? I think you are lying and you have no intention of submitting.’ Completely baffled by this, Gao Ding replies, ‘That’s just a plot by Zhu Bao.","So they thanked their liberator and went away. As soon as they reached their own camp, they told the whole story. Then Gao Ding sent a spy to the camp of Yong Kai to find out what was doing. There the spy met those who had been released, and they were all talking about Zhuge Liang's kindness, and many of them were inclined to desert their own camp for the other. Although this seemed very satisfactory, yet Gao Ding did not feel convinced, and he sent another man to Zhuge Liang's camp to try to verify the rumor. But this man was captured and taken before the Commander-in-Chief, who pretended that he thought the spy belonged to Yong Kai, and said to him, “Why has your leader failed to send me the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao as he promised? You lot are not very clever, and what are you come to spy out?” The soldier muttered and mumbled in confusion. But Zhuge Liang gave the man wine and food, and then wrote a letter which he handed to the spy, saying, “You give this letter to your commander, Yong Kai, and tell him to get the job done quickly.” The spy took the letter and got away. As soon as he reached camp, he gave the letter to Gao Ding and also the message. Gao Ding read the missive and became very angry. “I have ever been true to him, and yet he wants to kill me. It is hard to be either friendly or reasonable.” Then he decided to take E Huan into his confidence, and called him. E Huan was much prejudiced in favor of Zhuge Liang, and said, “Zhuge Liang is a most benevolent man, and it would be ill to turn our backs upon him. It is Yong Kai's fault that we are now rebels, and our best course would be to slay him and betake ourselves to Zhuge Liang.” “How could it be done?” asked Gao Ding. “Invite him to a banquet. If he refuses, it means he is a traitor, and then you can attack him in front while I will lie in wait behind his camp to capture him as he runs away.” They agreed to try this plan; the banquet was prepared and Yong Kai invited. But as Yong Kai's mind was full of suspicion from what his returned soldiers had said, he would not come. That night, as soon as darkness fell, Gao Ding attacked his camp. Now the soldiers who had been released were imbued with the goodness of Gao Ding all quite ready to help him fight. On the other hand, Yong Kai's troops mutinied against him, and so Yong Kai mounted his steed and fled. Before he had gone far, he found his road blocked by the cohort under E Huan, who galloped out with his halberd and confronted the fugitive. Yong Kai could not defend himself, and was struck down. E Huan decapitated him. As soon as they knew he was dead, his troops joined themselves to Gao Ding, who then went and surrendered to Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang received Gao Ding sitting in state in his tent, but at once ordered the lictors to decapitate Gao Ding. But Gao Ding said, “Influenced by your kindness, Sir, I have brought the head of my colleague as a proof of the sincerity of my surrender; why should I die?” “You come with false intent; do you think you can hoodwink me?” said Zhuge Liang, laughing. “What proof have you that I am false?” Zhuge Liang drew a letter from his box, and said, “Zhu Bao sent this secretly to say he wished to surrender, and he said you and Yong Kai were sworn friends to death. How could you suddenly change your feelings and slay him? That is how I know your treachery.” “Zhu Bao only tried to make trouble,” cried Gao Ding, kneeling. Zhuge Liang still refused to believe him, and said, “I cannot believe you without more solid proof. If you would slay Zhu Bao, I could take that as proving you were sincere in your surrender.” “Do not doubt me. What if I go and capture this man?” “If you did that, my doubts would be set at rest.”"
曹丕接詔欣喜，謂賈詡曰：“雖二次有詔，然終恐天下後世，不免篡竊之名也。”詡曰：“此事極易。可再命張音齎回璽綬，却敎華歆令漢帝築一臺，名‘受禪臺’；擇吉日良辰，集大小公卿，盡到臺下，令天子親奉璽綬，禪天下與王，便可以釋羣疑而絕衆議矣。”,"Cao Pi was delighted when he received the edict and told Jia Xu, ""Although the edict was issued a second time, in the end, I was afraid of the world's future generations and could not help usurp the name."" Xu said: ""This matter is very easy. However, Huaxin ordered the Han emperor to build one, named 'Shouchan Terrace'; choose auspicious days and good times, gather all the ministers and ministers, and make them all under the stage, order the emperor to personally enshrine the seal, and Zen world and kings, so that the doubts of the masses can be dispelled. It's all debated.""","Finally, Sima Yi manoeuvres the emperor into ordering an Altar of Abdication to be built and then brings Cao Pi to it to be officially if apparently reluctantly given the throne.","Greatly rejoicing, Cao Pi received this. But he said to Jia Xu, “Although I have received two such declarations, yet I fear that I may not escape being branded as a usurper by posterity.” “That is easily arranged,” replied Jia Xu. “Direct Zhang Yin to take the seal back again, and tell Hua Xin to cause the Emperor to set up a Terrace of Abdication and select an auspicious day for the ceremony. Then assemble all the officers at the terrace, and cause the Emperor to offer the seal with his own hands and surrender the empire to you. Thus can you dissipate all doubts and prevent any caviling.”"

北地王劉諶聞知，怒氣沖天，乃帶劍入宮。其妻崔夫人問曰：“大王今日顏色異常，何也？”諶曰：“魏兵將近，父皇已納降款，明日君臣出降，社稷從此殄滅。吾欲先死以見先帝於地下，不屈膝於他人也！”崔夫人曰：“賢哉！賢哉！得其死矣！妾請先死，王死未遲。”諶曰：“汝何死耶？”崔夫人曰：“王死父，妾死夫：其義同也。夫亡妻死，何必問焉？”言訖，觸柱而死。諶乃自殺其三子，并割妻頭，提至昭烈廟中，伏地哭曰：“臣羞見基業棄於他人，故先殺妻子，以絕罣念，後將一命報祖！祖如有靈：知孫之心！”大哭一場，眼中流血，自刎而死。蜀人聞之，無不哀痛。後人有詩讚曰：,"When Liu Chen, the king of the northern land, heard this, he was so angry that he brought his sword into the palace. His wife, Mrs. Cui, asked, ""Your Majesty's color is unusual today, why is that?"" Chen said, ""Wei soldiers are approaching, and the emperor has already paid for the reduction. Tomorrow, the ruler and ministers will surrender, and the Sheji will be destroyed from then on. I want to die first to see the former emperor underground Don’t bow your knees to others!” Madam Cui said, “It’s wise! It’s wise! You can die! Concubine, please die first, the king will die before it’s too late.” Chen said, “Why do you die?” Madam Cui said, “The king died. Father, the concubine dies husband: its meaning is the same. The husband dies and the wife dies, why should you ask?"" After saying this, he touched the pillar and died. Chen Nai committed suicide of his three sons, cut off his wife's head, brought him to the Zhaolie Temple, fell down and cried, ""I am ashamed to see that my inheritance has been abandoned to others, so I first killed my wife, and I will repay my ancestors with my life! If there is a spirit: know Sun's heart!"" He cried aloud, bleeding from his eyes, and killed himself. When the people of Shu heard it, they were all saddened. A later poem praised:","But Liu Chen cannot bear the shame and in his rage he returns to his palace, bearing his sword. His wife, Lady Cui, asks what the matter is. When he explains and says he will not kowtow to the Wei but will kill himself so he can face Xuande in the afterlife, she says she will do the same and asks permission to die first. ‘Why?’ asks a startled Liu Chen. ‘My lord, you will die for your father and I’ll die for my husband. We follow the same rule and values. There can be no question.’ So saying, she smashes her head against a pillar and dies. The prince kills his three sons and, cutting off his wife’s head, makes his way to the temple of the late emperor, Xuande. Here, kneeling and weeping, he offers up the souls of his wife and sons and then himself and slits his throat with his sword. A poet has said:","The wrath of Prince Liu Chan swelled high as heaven when he heard that his father had actually arranged the date of his abdication. Girding on his sword, he was setting out for the Palace when his Consort, Lady Cui, stopped him, saying, “My Prince, why does your face bear this look of terrible anger?” He replied, “The army of Wei is at the gates, and my father has made his Act of Surrender. Tomorrow he and all his ministers are going out of the city to submit formally, and the dynasty will end. But rather than bow the knee to another, I will die and go into the presence of the First Ruler in the realms below.” “How worthy; how worthy!” replied she. “And if my lord must die, I, thy handmaid, prays that she may die first. Then may my Prince depart.” “But why should you die?” “The Prince dies for his father and the handmaid for her husband. One eternal principle guides us all.” Thereupon she dashed herself against a pillar, and so she died. Then Liu Chan slew his three sons and cut off the head of his Consort that he might sever all ties to life lest he be tempted to live. Bearing the head of the princess in his hand, he went to the Temple of the First Ruler, where he bowed his head, saying, “Thy servant is ashamed at seeing the kingdom pass to another. Therefore has he slain his Consort and his sons that nothing should induce him to live and forego death.” This announcement recited, he made yet another to his ancestors. “My ancestors, if you have spiritual intelligence, yon know the feelings of your descendant.” Then he wept sore till his eyes ran blood, and he committed suicide. The people of Shu grieved deeply for him, and a poet has praised his noble deed."

Every time Cao Fang, the master of Wei, saw his teacher entering the court, he trembled, like a needle stabbing his back. One day, Fang set up the court, saw the teacher hanging up the sword in the hall, and hurriedly stayed in bed to welcome him. The master smiled and said, ""Is there any ceremony for the monarch to welcome the ministers? Please, Your Majesty, please take it easy."" After a while, the ministers reported the matter, and the Sima Shi all judged it by himself, and did not play the Lord Wei. When I was young, my teacher retreated, proudly descended to the hall, went out by car, covered the front and back, no less than thousands of people, Fang retreated into the apse, and there were only three people left and right: Xiahou Xuan, Taichang, Zhongshu Ling Li Feng, and Doctor Guanglu Zhang Ji - Ji is the father of Empress Zhang and the husband of Cao Fang. Fang Qiu withdrew his valet and went to the secret room with the three to discuss. Fang held Zhang Ji's hand and wept, ""Master Sima treats me like a child, and all officials are like grass. Sooner or later, the Sheji will return to this person!"" He ended up crying. Li Feng said: ""Your Majesty, don't worry: although the minister is not talented, I would like to use Your Majesty's clear edict to gather heroes from all over the world to suppress this thief."" Xiahou Xuan said: ""My brother, Xiahou, surrendered to Shu because he was afraid of Brother Sima. Murdered the old man. Now if this thief is eliminated, the elder brother of the minister will return. The minister is an old relative of the country, how dare you sit back and watch the traitor and riot the country? The memorial said: ""The ministers and others swear to fight the thieves together in order to repay His Majesty!"" Fang took off the dragon and phoenix sweatshirts, bit his fingertips, wrote a blood edict, and gave it to Zhang Ji, and instructed: ""My ancestor, Emperor Wu, punish Dong Cheng. , because the secret is not secret. The ministers must be careful and do not leak it to the outside world."" Feng said, ""Why did Your Majesty make such unfavorable remarks? The ministers and others are not of Dong Cheng's generation, and Sima Shi is also compared to Wuzu? Your Majesty has no doubts. ""The three of them resigned and went to the left of Donghua Gate. They saw Master Sima coming with a sword. Hundreds of followers, all armed with weapons. The three stood by the road. The master asked, ""Why is it late for the three of you to retreat from the dynasty?"" Li Feng said, ""The Holy One is reading the books in the inner court, and the three of us are reading Guer."" The master asked, ""What book did you read?"" Feng said, ""That Xia, Shang, and Zhou Dynasty are also the books."" The teacher said, ""I saw this book, what is the story?"" Feng said: ""The emperor asked: Yi Yin helped Shang and Zhou as the regent; we all played it and said: ' Today's Great General Sima, Yi Yin and Duke Zhou.'"" The teacher sneered and said, ""How can you compare me to Yi Yin and Duke Zhou! Your heart really means that I am Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo!"" All three said: ""We are all The people under the general’s door, how dare you do this?” The master said angrily: “You are flattering people! What are you crying about in the secret room with the Son of Heaven?” The three said, “There is no such thing.” The master said. ""The three of you are still red with tears, how can you deny it!"" Governor Xiahou Xuan had already vented, and he scolded loudly, ""The one we weep is for you to overwhelm the master, and we will try to usurp the ear!"" The teacher was furious and shouted. The warrior captures Xiahou Xuan. Xuanjie punched with bare sleeves and hit Sima Shi, but was captured by the samurai. The teacher ordered everyone to search, and found a dragon and phoenix shirt next to Zhang Ji, with blood on it. Left and right were with Sima Shi. The teacher regards it as a secret edict. The edict said:","As for Sima Zhao, he celebrates the defeat of the enemy attack, and this only strengthens his brother Sima Shi’s control of the empire. Soon he is acting as if he were the emperor even in front of the emperor himself. Cao Fang finds himself sidelined and retreats to his own quarters, deprived of almost all his own officers bar three. One of these is Zhang Qi, the father of the emperor’s consort Empress Zhang. Together with the other two, Xiahou Xuan, whose uncle has fled to Shu, and Li Feng, he plots with the emperor to rally loyal men to come to the help of the emperor and overthrow both of the Sima brothers. To seal this, Cao Fang removes his imperial dragon-phoenix shirt and, cutting his finger, writes in blood the edict summoning men to his side. He recalls that: ‘Dong Cheng was killed by my ancestor Cao Cao the august emperor because an exact same conspiracy was discovered.’","After rewarding the Qiangs for their help, Sima Zhao led his army back to Luoyang, where he joined his brother Sima Shi in administering the government. They were too strong for any of the officers to dare opposition, and they terrorized Cao Fang, the Ruler of Wei, so that he shook with fright whenever he saw Sima Shi at court, and felt as if needles were being stuck into his back. One day, when the Ruler of Wei was holding a court, Sima Shi came into the hall wearing his sword. Cao Fang hastily left his Dragon Throne to receive him. “What does this mean? Is this the correct etiquette for a prince when his minister approaches?” said Sima Shi, smiling. “I pray Your Majesty remember your dignity and listen while the ministers address the Throne.” Court business then proceeded. Sima Shi decided every question without reference to the Ruler of Wei; and when Sima Shi retired, he stalked haughtily down the hall and went home, followed by his escort, which numbered thousands of horse and foot. When the Ruler of Wei left the court, only three followed him to the private apartments. They were Minister Xiahou Xuan, Secretary Li Feng, and High Minister Zhang Qi. Zhang Qi was the father of his consort, Empress Zhang. Sending away the servants, Cao Fang and these three went into a private chamber. Seizing his father-in-law's hand, Cao Fang began to weep, saying, “That man Sima Shi treats me as a child and regards the officers of state as if they were so many straws. I am sure the throne will be his one day.” And he wept bitterly. Said Li Feng, “Do not be so sad, Sire. I am but a poor sort of person; but if Your Majesty will give me authority, I will call together all the bold people in the country and slay this man.” “It was from fear of this man that my brother Xiahou Ba was forced to go over to Shu,” said Xiahou Xuan. “If Sima Shi were destroyed, my brother could return. I belong to a family related to the rulers of the state for many generations, and I cannot sit still while a wretch ruins the government. Put my name in the command as well, and we will work together to remove him.” “But I am afraid we can not overcome him,” said Cao Fang. They wept and said, “We pledge ourselves to work together for the destruction of the tyrant, and to show our gratitude to Your Majesty.” Cao Fang them stripped himself of his innermost garment, gnawed his finger till the blood flowed, and with his finger-tip traced a command in blood. He gave it to his father-in-law, Zhang Qi, saying, “My ancestor, the Emperor Cao, put to death Dong Cheng for just such a matter as this, so you must be exceedingly careful and maintain the greatest secrecy.” “Oh, why use such ill-omened words?” cried Li Feng. “We are not like Dong Cheng, and Sima Shi cannot compare to the Founder. Have no doubts.” The three conspirators took leave and went out carrying the edict with them. Beside the Donghua Gate of the palace, they saw Sima Shi coming to meet them wearing a sword. Following him were many armed guards. The three ministers took the side of the road to let the party go by. “Why are you three so late in leaving the Palace?” asked Sima Shi. “His Majesty was reading, and we stayed with him,” said Li Feng. “What was he reading?” “The histories of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties.” “What questions did the Emperor ask as he read those books?” “He asked about Yi Yin and how he upheld the Shang; and the Duke of Zhou, how he acted when he was regent. And we told His Majesty that you were both Yi Yin and Duke Zhou to him.” Sima Shi smiled grimly and said, “Why did you compare me with those two when in your hearts you think me a rebel like Wang Mang and Dong Zhuo?” “How should we dare when we are your subordinates?” said the three ministers. “You are a lot of flatterers,” said Sima Shi, angrily. “And what were you crying about in that private chamber with the Emperor?” “We did no such thing.” “Your eyes are still red; you cannot deny that.” Xiahou Xuan then knew that the secrecy had been showed, so he broke out into a volley of abuse, crying, “Well, we were crying because of your conduct, because you terrorize over the Emperor and are scheming to usurp the Throne.” “Seize him!” roared Sima Shi. Xiahou Xuan threw back his sleeves and struck at Sima Shi with his fists, but the lictors pulled him back. Then the three were searched, and on Zhang Qi was found the blood-stained garment of the Emperor. They handed it to their chief, who recognized the object of his search, the secret edict. It said:"
却說鍾會請姜維問曰：“吾夜夢大蛇數千條咬吾，主何吉凶？”維曰：“夢龍蛇者，皆吉慶之兆也。”會喜，信其言，乃謂維曰：“器仗已備，放諸將出問之，若何？”維曰：“此輩皆有不服之心，久必為害，不如乘早戮之。”會從之，卽命姜維領武士往殺衆魏將。維領命，方欲行動，忽然一陣心疼，昏倒在地；左右扶起，半晌方甦。忽報宮外人聲沸騰。會方令人探時，喊聲大震，四面八方，無限兵到。維曰：“此必是諸將作惡，可先斬之。”忽報兵已入內。會令關上殿門，使軍士上殿屋以瓦擊之，互相殺死數十人。宮外四面火起，外兵砍開殿門殺入。會自掣劍立殺數人，却被亂箭射倒。衆將梟其首。維拔劍上殿，往來衝突，不幸心疼轉加。維仰天大叫曰：“吾計不成，乃天命也！”遂自刎而死：時年五十九歲。宮中死者數百人。衞瓘曰：“衆軍各歸營所，以待王命。”魏兵爭欲報讎，共剖維腹：其膽大如雞卵。衆將又盡取姜維家屬殺之。鄧艾部下之人，見鍾會、姜維已死，遂連夜去追劫鄧艾。早有人報知衞瓘。瓘曰：“是我捉艾；今若留他，我無葬身之地矣。”護軍田續曰：“昔鄧艾取江油之時，欲殺續，得衆官告免。今日當報此恨。”瓘大喜，遂遣田續引五百兵趕至綿竹，正遇鄧艾父子放出檻車，欲還成都。艾只道是本部兵到，不作準備；欲待問時，被田續一刀斬之。鄧忠亦死於亂軍之中。後人有詩歎鄧艾曰：,"However, Zhong Hui asked Jiang Wei to ask: ""I dreamed of thousands of large snakes biting me at night, what is good or bad?"" Wei said: ""Those who dream of dragons and snakes are all auspicious signs."" ""The weapon is ready, let the generals go out and ask them, what if?"" Wei said: ""This generation has a heart of disobedience, and it will be harmed for a long time. It is better to kill him early."" To kill the Wei generals. Wei took his life, Fang wanted to take action, and suddenly felt distressed and fell to the ground; Suddenly, the voices of people outside the palace were boiling. When the party was being investigated, the shouts were loud, and infinite troops arrived from all directions. Wei said, ""This must be because the generals have done evil, so they can be killed first."" They will order to close the gate of the palace, and have the sergeants go up to the palace and hit them with tiles, killing dozens of people. Fire erupted from all sides outside the palace, and foreign soldiers cut open the gate of the palace and entered. He would kill several people with his own sword, but was shot down by random arrows. The generals bowed their heads. Wei Bajian went to the palace, and there was conflict in the exchanges, unfortunately, he felt distressed and added. Wei Yangtian shouted: ""My plan is not successful, it is the destiny of heaven!"" Then he killed himself and died at the age of fifty-nine. Hundreds of people died in the palace. Wei Kuan said: ""All the troops will return to their camps to wait for the king's order."" The generals took all Jiang Wei's family to kill him. When Deng Ai's subordinates saw that Zhonghui and Jiang Wei were dead, they went after Deng Ai overnight. Someone had already informed Wei Gan. Kuan said: ""It was I who caught Ai; if I leave him now, I have no place to be buried."" Hujun Tian Xu said: ""In the past, when Deng Ai took Jiangyou, he wanted to kill Xu, but the officials gave him a waiver. This hatred."" Kuang was overjoyed, so he dispatched Tian Xu to lead five hundred soldiers to Mianzhu, just as Deng Ai and his son released the chariot and wanted to return to Chengdu. Ai only said that the troops from the headquarters arrived and did not make preparations; when he was about to ask, he was slashed by Tian Xu. Deng Zhong also died in the chaos of the army. A later generation sighed Deng Ai and said:","On the night of the seventeenth, Zhong Hui has a dream in which he is being attacked by a vast number of snakes. The following morning he asks Jiang Wei how he would interpret this dream. To allay any fears, Jiang Wei says this is a dream about dragons, and that means it is auspicious. Zhong Hui then gives Jiang Wei the order to go and execute all the Wei officers. But no sooner has he started the executions than Jiang Wei has a heart attack and collapses, out cold. Just as he starts to come round, the din of an attack overwhelms the palace prison, and chaos breaks out, with men rushing about everywhere. ‘ Mutiny,’ cries Jiang Wei. ‘Kill all the officers.’ But it is too late. Soldiers burst in, fires break out, and even though Zhong Hui fights back he is taken down with an arrow, and then his head is hacked off. Rushing out to the attack, Jiang Wei suffers another heart attack. ‘I’ve failed. So be it, this is the Will of Heaven.’ And so saying, he cuts his own throat. He is fifty-nine years of age. His whole family perishes that day. Only Wei Guan is able to restore order, but then news comes that in the mayhem Deng Ai and his son have been released by their supporters, and Wei Guan begins to fear for his life. An officer who has personal reasons for wanting them dead offers to do the deed and he sets off with five hundred men. When Deng Ai sees the men advancing, he believes they have come to support him so with no protection goes to greet them. He and his son are cut down in cold blood. A poet has written this about Deng Ai:","One day Zhong Hui said to Jiang Wei, “Last night I dreamed a dream, that I was bitten by many serpents. Can you expound the vision?” Jiang Wei replied, “Dreams of dragons and snakes and scaly creatures are exceedingly auspicious.” Zhong Hui was only too ready to accept this interpretation. Then he told Jiang Wei that all was ready and they would put the crucial question to each captive. “I know they are opposed to us, and you would do well to slay them all, and that right quickly,” replied Jiang Wei. “Good,” replied Zhong Hui. He bade Jiang Wei with several braves kill the Wei leaders among the captives. But just as Jiang Wei was starting to carry out these instructions, he was seized with a sudden spasm of the heart, so severe that he fainted. He was raised from the earth and in time revived. Just as he came to, a tremendous hubbub arose outside the Palace. Zhong Hui at once sent to inquire what was afoot, but the noise waxed louder and louder, sounding like the rush of a multitude. “The officers must be raging,” said Zhong Hui. “We would best slay them at once.” But they told him: “The outside soldiers are in the Palace.” Zhong Hui bade them close the doors of the Hall of Audience, and he sent his own troops upon the roof to pelt the incoming soldiers with tiles. Many were slain on either side in the melee. Then a fire broke out. The assailants broke open the doors. Zhong Hui faced them and slew a few, but others shot at him with flights of arrows, and he fell and died. They hacked off his head. Jiang Wei ran to and fro slaying all he met till another heart spasm seized him. “Failed!” he shrieked, “But it is the will of Heaven.” He put an end to his own life. He was fifty-nine. Many hundreds were slain within the precincts of the Palace. Wei Guan presently ordered that the soldiers were to be led back to their various camps to await the orders of the Duke of Jin. The soldiers of Wei, burning for revenge of his many invasions, hacked the dead body of Jiang Wei to pieces. They found his gall bladder extraordinarily large, as large as a hen's egg. They also seized and slew all the family of the dead leader. Seeing that Deng Ai's two enemies on the spot were both dead, his old soldiers bethought themselves of trying to rescue him. When Wei Guan, who had actually arrested Deng Ai, heard this, he feared for his life. “If Deng Ai lives, I will die in his hand,” said Wei Guan. Furthermore, General Tian Xu said, “When Deng Ai took Jiangyou, he wished to put me to death. It was only at the prayer of my friends that he let me off. May I not have my revenge now?” So Wei Guan gave order. At the head of five hundred cavalry, Tian Xu went in pursuit of the cage-carts. He came up with them at Mianzhu and found that the two prisoners had just been released from the carts in which they were being carried to Luoyang. When Deng Ai saw that those coming up were soldiers of his own late command, he took no thought for defense. Nor did Tian Xu waste time in preliminaries. He went up to where Deng Ai was standing and cut him down. His soldiers fell upon the son, Deng Zhong, and slew him also, and thus father and son met death in the same place. A poem, pitying Deng Ai, was written: While yet a boy, Deng Ai loved to sketch and plan;"

孔明看畢，擲書於地而頓足曰：“孟達必死於司馬懿之手矣！”馬謖問曰：“丞相何謂也？”孔明曰：“兵法云：‘攻其不備，出其不意。’豈容料在一月之期？曹叡旣委任司馬懿，逢寇卽除，何待奏聞？若知孟達反，不須十日，兵必到矣，安能措手耶？”衆將皆服。孔明急令來人回報曰：“若未舉事，切莫敎同事者知之：知則必敗。”其人拜辭，歸新城去了。,"When Kong Ming finished reading it, he threw the book on the ground and stomped his feet, saying, ""Meng Da will surely die at the hands of Sima Yi!"" Ma Su asked, ""What do you mean by prime minister?"" Kong Ming said, ""The Art of War says: 'If you are not prepared for an attack, you will be unexpected.' In one month? Cao Ruiyan appointed Sima Yi, and every time the pirates were removed, why should you file a report? If you know that Meng Da will be opposed, it will not take ten days, and the troops will arrive, so An Neng will be unprepared?"" All the generals obeyed. Kong Ming hurriedly ordered the people who came to report back: ""If you don't do something, don't teach your colleagues to know about it: if you know it, you will be defeated.""","When he receives the letter, Kong Ming is furious and says, ‘He’s doomed.’ When asked why, Kong Ming quotes the Art of War: ‘ “Attack the enemy before he is ready; do what no one expects.” He doesn’t have a month, because Sima Yi will not wait for permission but will be on Meng Da within ten days, and Meng Da will not be ready.’ And sure enough, Sima Yi does not wait for orders nor go to Chang’an as instructed. He realizes that Meng Da can be taken out of the equation by swift, decisive action. So he sets out with the army towards Meng Da. En route he meets up with his old fighting companion Xu Huang, and their forces unite. Learning that Kong Ming has tried to warn Meng Da to be prepared for a surprise attack, Sima acknowledges the skills and wisdom of Kong Ming and urges on his men even faster.","Zhuge Liang read the letter and threw it on the ground, stamping his foot with rage. “Meng Da is a dead man;” said he, “a victim of Sima Yi.” “Why do you say that?” said Ma Su. “What does the Art of War say? ' Attack before the enemy is prepared; do what he does not expect.' What is the use of reckoning upon a month's delay for sending up a memorial? Cao Rui's commission has already gone, and Sima Yi may strike whom he will. He will not have to wait to memorialize the Throne. Ten days after he hears of Meng Da's defection, he will be upon Meng Da with an army, and Meng Da will be helpless.”' The others agreed. However, Zhuge Liang sent the messenger back again to say that if the matter had not yet actually started, no other person was to be told of it; for if anyone knew, it would certainly come to nothing."
時有一人姓耿，名紀，字季行，洛陽人也；舊為丞相府掾，後遷侍中少府，與司直韋晃甚厚；見曹操進封王爵，出入用天子車服，心甚不平。時建安二十三年春正月。耿紀與韋晃密議曰：“操賊奸惡日甚，將來必為篡逆之事。吾等為漢臣，豈可同惡相濟？”韋晃曰：“吾有心腹人，姓金，名褘，乃漢相金日磾之後，素有討操之心；更兼與王必甚厚。若得同謀，大事濟矣。”耿紀曰：“他旣與王必交厚，豈肯與我等同謀乎？”韋晃曰：“且往說之，看是如何。”於是二人同至金褘宅中。褘接入後堂，坐定。晃曰：“德偉與王長史甚厚，吾三人特來告求。”褘曰：“所求何事？”晃曰：“吾聞魏王早晚受禪，將登大寶，公與王長史必高遷。望不相棄，曲賜提攜，感德非淺！”褘拂袖而起。適從者奉茶至，便將茶潑於地上。晃佯驚曰：“德偉故人，何薄情也？”褘曰：“吾與汝交厚，為汝等是漢朝臣宰之後；今不思報本，欲輔造反之人，吾有何面目與汝為友！”耿紀曰：“奈天數如此，不得不為耳！”褘大怒。耿紀、韋晃，見褘果有忠義之心，乃以實情相告曰：“吾等本欲討賊，來求足下。前言特相試耳。”褘曰：“吾累世漢臣，安能從賊！公等欲扶漢室，有何高見？”晃曰：“雖有報國之心，未有討賊之計。”褘曰：“吾欲裏應外合，殺了王必，奪其兵權，扶助鑾輿。更結劉皇叔為外援，操賊可滅矣。”二人聞之，撫掌稱善。,"At that time, there was a person whose surname was Geng, whose name was Ji, whose style was Jixing, and was also from Luoyang; he used to be the prime minister's house, but later moved to serve in the middle and young mansion, and was very close to Sizhi Wei; Very upset. It was the first month of spring in the twenty-third year of Jian'an. Geng Ji and Wei Huang had a secret discussion and said: ""The thieves are becoming more and more evil, and in the future it will definitely be a usurpation. We are Han ministers, how can we help the evil?"" Wei Huang said: ""I have a confidant whose surname is Jin. He is named after the Han Prime Minister Jin Ribing, and he always has the heart to negotiate. He will also be very friendly with the king. If he can conspire with the king, it will be a big deal."" Geng Ji said: ""He will have a good relationship with the king, how can he be willing to do so? Is it the same as me?"" Wei Huang said, ""Let's talk about it and see how it goes."" So the two of them went to the golden mansion together. He entered the back hall and sat down. Huang said: ""Dewei and Wang Chang have a very rich history, and the three of us have come to ask for it."" He said, ""What are you asking for?"" Huang said: ""I heard that King Wei received Zen sooner or later, and he will ascend to the great treasure. Wang Changshi is bound to move high. Looking forward to not abandoning each other, Qu Ci's support and support, and the gratitude is not shallow!"" A wave of his sleeves stood up. Those who are fit to serve tea arrive and pour the tea on the ground. Huang pretended to be shocked and said: ""Dewei's old friend, why do you have little affection?"" Ao said: ""I have a good relationship with you, and you are the emperor of the Han Dynasty. Be friends with you!"" Geng Ji said, ""Neitian has so many days, I have to be my ear!"" He was furious. Geng Ji and Wei Huang, seeing that Bangguo had loyalty and righteousness, they told the truth: ""We originally wanted to hunt down thieves, so we came to ask for a step. The preface is very special."" You can follow the thieves! What do you think the princes want to help the Han family?"" Huang said: ""Although I have the intention to serve the country, I have no plan to fight the thieves."" Ao said: ""I want to cooperate with the inside and the outside, and I will kill Wang Bi and seize his military power. , to help Luanyu. And even make Liu Huangshu as a foreign aid, and the thieves can be wiped out."" The two of them heard it and clapped their hands and said that they were kind.","Cao Cao doesn’t believe him, but then news comes that Lu Su has died and that Xuande has sent Zhang Fei and Ma Chao to capture the pass at Xiabian. Infuriated by this, Cao Cao asks what he should do. Guan Lu urges caution. ‘Not least,’ says Guan Lu, ‘because next spring there will be a terrible fire in the city.’ Cao Cao responds by staying put but sends Cao Hong to defend the east and increase the patrols in the city with an additional thirty thousand troops under Xiahou Dun. Wang Bi is given control of the royal troops – even though, as is pointed out, Wang Bi is prone to alcoholism. It is early in AD 218 that a minor member of Cao Cao’s staff, one Geng Ji, approaches Wei Huang, who is in charge of the protection of Cao Cao. Both have been horrified that Cao Cao has taken the title king. They decide that they can confide in Jin Yi, who also hates Cao Cao for his having usurped the imperial power. They also know that Jin Yi is a friend of Wang Bi, though this also makes them quite cautious. Having made sure he is on their side, together they hatch a plot to kill Wang Bi, bring the Royal Guard onto their side and then use them to kill Cao Cao. They also recruit two others, sons of the imperial physician Ji Ping, whom Cao Cao had murdered years before.","Now there was a certain Geng Ji, a Luoyang man, who had long been employed in the Prime Minister's palace in a subordinate capacity and afterward had been promoted to a post of Minister. He and Minister Wei Huang were close friends. These two were greatly distressed at Cao Cao's advance to princely rank, and more especially at his use of the imperial chariots. In the early months of the twenty-third year (AD 218), Geng Ji and Wei Huang came to a secret exchange of views on Cao Cao's conduct. Geng Ji said, “The man is rebellious and wicked, every day behaving worse. He intends to go farther, and how can we, as servants of the dynasty, help him in his wickedness?” Wei Huang said, “I have a friend named Jin Yi, who also is a servant of Han and an enemy of Cao Cao's. He is a descendant of the old Great Minister Jin Midi. Beside, he is friendly with Wang Bi. If we all tried our best, we ought to succeed.” “But if he is friendly Wang Bi, he will not assist us!” said Geng Ji. “Let us go and sound him,” said Wei Huang. So the two went to see Jin Yi, who received them in his private rooms. There they talked. Said Wei Huang, “O virtuous Jin Yi , we know you are on most friendly terms with Commander Wang Bi, and so have come to beg a favor.” “What is it you ask?” “The Prince of Wei will soon receive the abdication of the Emperor and himself ascend to the seat of the mighty. Then you and your friend Wang Bi will advance to places of great honor; and when that day comes, we pray you not to forget us, but to recommend us for employment. We should feel no shallow gratitude for your kindness.” Jin Yi flicked down his sleeves and arose looking very angry. At that instant arrived the tea for the visitors. He snatched it away from the serving man and emptied it on the floor. Wei Huang started up in feigned alarm. “How have I offended you, my good friend?” cried he. “I have been friends with you because you are descendants of people who have served the Hans faithfully. Now, instead of trying to repay the debt of gratitude you ought to feel, you turn aside to assist one who is their enemy, think you that I can regard you as friends? How could I look the world in the face?” “But if it be destiny, one cannot help it,” said Geng Ji. “One must accept it.” Jin Yi grew still more angry, so that the two visitors were convinced that at heart he was still loyal to the dynasty. Then they began to tell him the true state of the case. “Our real desire is to destroy this rebel, and we have come to ask your help in that. What we said at first was only a test to find out what you thought.” “Think you, with my ancestry, generation after generation in the confidence and service of the Hans, that I would willingly follow a rebel? If you, Sirs, really think of restoring the dynasty, pray tell me your plans.” “Though we have the desire to prove our gratitude, yet we lack the means to destroy the enemy,” said Wei Huang. Said Jin Yi, “We desire helpers within and supporters without. If we could slay Wang Bi, we could use his name and troops to help the Emperor. With the help of Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, we should be able to destroy the rebel Cao Cao.” Hearing Jin Yi's plan, the others clapped their hands in approval."

Guo Huai was overjoyed and said, ""This is because the soldiers of the Qiang attacked, so you retreated."" Then they pursued in two ways. . The Shu soldiers in front were running around, and the Wei soldiers chased after them. The vanguard Cao Zun was rushing in, and suddenly the drums shook loudly, and a Biao army flashed out: The leading general was Wei Yan, shouting: ""The rebels, leave!"" Beheaded under the horse. The deputy pioneer Zhu Zan led his troops to chase, and suddenly a Biao army flashed out: Zhao Yun is the leading general. Zhu Zan was caught off guard and was stabbed to death by Yun. Cao Zhen and Guo Huai saw that the vanguards of the two groups had lost their way and wanted to withdraw their troops; they shouted loudly from behind, and the drum horns rang in unison: Guan Xing and Zhang Bao two soldiers rushed out, surrounded Cao Zhen and Guo Huai, and killed them for a while. Cao and Guo led the defeated soldiers to escape. The Shu soldiers were victorious, and they chased the Wei River and captured the Wei Village. Cao Zhen lost two vanguards, and was deeply saddened.","Confusion as to what has happened to the Qiang leads Cao Zhen to believe the Shu army has been defeated, and so he advances, only to be attacked by Wei Yan.","Then a scout came in with the news that the army of Shu had broken camp and were marching away. “That is because the Qiangs have attacked,” said Guo Huai gleefully, and the two made ready to pursue. Ahead of them the army of Shu seemed to be in confusion. The van-leader Cao Zun led the pursuit. Suddenly, as he pressed on, there came a roll of drums, followed by the appearance of a cohort led by Wei Yan, who cried, “Stop! You rebels!” But Cao Zun did not obey the summons. He dashed forward to meet the attack. He was killed in the third encounter. His colleague Zhu Zan in similar fashion fell in with a cohort under Zhao Yun, to whose long spear he soon fell victim. The loss of these two made Cao Zhen and Guo Huai hesitate, and they made to retire. But before they could face about, they heard the drums of an army in their rear, and Guan Xing and Zhang Bao came out and surrounded them. Cao Zhen and Guo Huai made a stand for a time, but were soon worsted and fled. The army of Shu pursued the beaten enemy to the banks of River Wei, where they took possession of the Wei camp. Cao Zhen was greatly chagrined at his defeat and sad at the loss of his generals."

却說曹丕聞曹彰提兵而來，驚問衆官；一人挺身而出，願往折服之。衆視其人，乃諫議大夫賈逵也。曹丕大喜，卽命賈逵前往。逵領命出城，迎見曹彰。彰問曰：“先王璽綬安在？”逵正色而言曰：“家有長子，國有儲君，先王璽綬，非君侯之所宜問也。”彰默然無語，乃與賈逵同入城。至宮門前，逵問曰：“君侯此來，欲奔喪耶？欲爭位耶？”彰曰：“吾來奔喪，別無異心。”逵曰：“旣無異心，何故帶兵入城？”彰卽時叱退左右將士，隻身入內，拜見曹丕。兄弟二人，相抱大哭。曹彰將本部軍馬盡交與曹丕。丕令彰回鄢陵自守，彰拜辭而去。,"But he said that Cao Pi heard that Cao Zhang had brought troops and asked the officials in surprise; The people looked at him, and they were admonishing the doctor Jia Kui. Cao Pi was overjoyed and ordered Jia Kui to go there. Kui led the order out of the city to meet Cao Zhang. Zhang asked, ""Where is the late king's seal?"" Kui said in a serious tone, ""The family has the eldest son, the prince of the state, and the late king's seal is not a suitable place for a monarch to ask."" When he arrived at the gate of the palace, Kui asked, ""Your Majesty is here, you want to go to the funeral? You want to fight for the throne?"" Zhang said, ""I am here to go to the funeral, and there is no difference."" Kui said, ""There is no difference, why did you bring troops into the city? ""Zhang Shi hurried back the soldiers on the left and right, went inside alone, and paid respects to Cao Pi. The two brothers hug each other and cry. Cao Zhang handed over all his troops and horses to Cao Pi. Pi ordered Zhang to return to Yanling to defend himself, and Zhang bowed and left.","When Cao Zhang and Jia Kui meet, Cao Zhang immediately asks, ‘Where is the late king’s seal?’ To this, with stiff politeness, Jia Kui replies, ‘Every House has an elder son; every country an heir apparent. Therefore such a question from your lordship is inappropriate.’ That silences Cao Zhang, and they ride on and into the city. Upon arriving at the palace, Jia Kui asks politely, ‘My lord, have you come to mourn your father at the funeral or to challenge your brother for the throne?’ ‘To attend the funeral, as I have no hostile plans.’ ‘So why, in that case,’ asks Jia Kui, ‘have you come with an army?’ In response to this polite but firm query, Cao Zhang has no option but to dismiss his men and go into the palace by himself. There, he embraces his brother, weeping, and hands over to him his armed forces. Then, following the orders of Cao Pi, he returns to Yanling to be commander there.","All eyes turned toward the speaker, High Minister Jia Kui, and the young prince commanded him to undertake the mission. So he went out of the city and sought to speak with Cao Zhang. Cao Zhang came quickly to the point. “Who has the late Prince's seal?” asked he. Jia Kui replied seriously, “There is an eldest son to a house, and an heir-apparent to a state. Such a question from your lordship is unbecoming.” Cao Zhang held his peace, and the two proceeded into the city to the gates of the palace. There Jia Kui suddenly asked him, “You come as a mourner or as a rival claimant?” “I am come as a mourner; I never had any ulterior motive.” “That being so; why bring in your soldiers?” Whereupon Cao Zhang ordered his escort to retire, and entered the city alone. When the Cao brothers met, they fell into each other's arms and wept. Then Cao Zhang yielded command of all his army, and he was directed to go back to Yanling and guard it. He obediently withdrew."

敍乃與統兵校尉尹奉、趙昂商議。原來趙昂之子趙月，見隨馬超為裨將，趙昂當日應允，歸見其妻王氏曰：“吾今日與姜敍、楊阜、尹奉一處商議，欲報韋康之讎。吾想子趙月見隨馬超，今若興兵，超必先殺吾子，奈何？”其妻厲聲曰：“雪君父之大恥，雖喪身亦不惜，何況一子乎？君若顧子而不行，吾當先死矣。”趙昂乃決。次日一同起兵。姜敍、楊阜屯歷城，尹奉、趙昂屯祁山。王氏乃盡將首飾資帛，親自往祁山軍中，賞勞軍士，以勵其衆。,"Xu Nai discussed with Yin Feng and Zhao Ang, commanders of the military commander. It turned out that Zhao Yue, the son of Zhao Ang, saw Ma Chao as his assistant general, Zhao Ang agreed that day, and went back to his wife Wang Shi and said, ""I have a discussion with Jiang Xu, Yang Fu, and Yin Feng today, and I want to report Wei Kang. The son Zhaoyue saw that he was following Ma Chao, and if he were to start an army now, Chao would kill my son first, so what?” His wife said sharply, “Xue Jun’s father is so shameful that he would not hesitate even if he lost his life, how much more would he have a son? , I should die first."" Zhao Ang was determined. Together the next day. Jiang Xu, Yang Fu tun Licheng, Yin Feng, Zhao Ang tun Qishan. The Wang family went to the Qishan army with all the jewelry and silk to reward the sergeants and encourage them.","Drawing Ma Chao to the attack before the city of Licheng, the plotters spring an ambush on Ma Chao, encouraged by the fact that Cao Cao has sent Xiahou Yuan to support the plot.","He summoned two of his officers, Zhao Ang and Yin Feng, and took counsel with them. Now Zhao Ang had a son, Zhao Yue, who was an officer in the army of Ma Chao. When Zhao Ang had to consent to take part against his son's chief, he became very unhappy and went home to talk over it with his wife, Lady Wang. He said, “I have today been led into a scheme to destroy Ma Chao and avenge Wei Kang. But there is our son there in Ma Chao's service, and Ma Chao will certainly put our son to death as soon as he hears that we are arming against him. What is to be done?” But his wife replied angrily, “Should anyone grudge even his life to avenge his liege lord or his father? How much less a son? My lord, if you let the thought of your son stay your hand, then will I die forthwith.” This decided the matter, and without further parley Zhao Ang decided to share the expedition and set about preparations. The army was soon on the way. Jiang Xu and Yang Fu camped at the city of Licheng; Zhao Ang and Yin Feng camped at Qishan."
却說姜維退兵屯於鍾提，魏兵屯於狄道城外。王經迎接陳泰、鄧艾入城，拜謝解圍之事，設宴相待，大賞三軍。泰將鄧艾之功，申奏魏主曹髦。髦封艾為安西將軍，假節領護東羌校尉，同陳泰屯兵於雍、涼等處。鄧艾上表謝恩畢，陳泰設席與鄧艾拜賀曰：“姜維夜遁，其力已竭，不敢再出矣。”艾笑曰：“吾料蜀兵其必出有五。”泰問其故。艾曰：“蜀兵雖退，終有乘勝之勢；吾兵終有弱敗之實：其必出一也。蜀兵皆是孔明敎演，精銳之兵，容易調遣；吾將不時更換，軍又訓練不熟：其必出二也。蜀人多以船行，吾軍皆在旱地，勞逸不同：其必出三也。狄道、隴西、南安、祁山四處，皆是守戰之地；蜀人或聲東擊西，指南攻北，吾兵必須分頭守把；蜀兵合為一處而來，以一分當我四分：其必出四也。若蜀兵自南安、隴西，則可取羌人之穀為食；若出祁山，則有麥可就食：其必出五也。”陳泰歎服曰：“公料敵如神，蜀兵何足慮哉！”於是陳泰與鄧艾結為忘年之交。艾遂將雍、涼等處之兵，每日操練；各處隘口，皆立營寨，以防不測。,"But they said that Jiang Wei retreated and camped at Zhongti, and Wei camped outside Didao City. Wang Jing welcomed Chen Tai and Deng Ai into the city, thanked them for the relief of the siege, held a banquet to treat each other, and rewarded the three armies. The achievements of the Thai general Deng Ai, and the performance of Cao Mao, the master of Wei. Mao named Ai the general of Anxi, and he led the guard of the East Qiang Colonel, and together with Chen Tai stationed troops in Yong, Liang and other places. Deng Ai expressed his gratitude to Deng Ai, and Chen Tai set up a seat to greet Deng Ai and said, ""Jiang Wei has escaped at night, his strength is exhausted, and he does not dare to go out again."" Ai smiled and said, ""I expect that there will be five soldiers out of Shu."" Tai Ask why. Ai said: ""Although the soldiers of Shu retreat, they will eventually have the tendency to take advantage of the victory; my soldiers will eventually be weak and defeated: they will definitely come out. , the army is not familiar with training: it must go out of the second. The people of Shu mostly travel by boat, our army is all in dry land, work and rest are different: it must go out of the three. Di Dao, Longxi, Nan'an, Qishan are all guarding the war. If the people of Shu are attacking from the east to the west, and guide them to attack the north, we must divide our troops to defend them; the soldiers from Shu come together, and take one point as my four points: they must come out of four. If the soldiers of Shu come from Nan'an and Longxi, Then you can take the grain of the Qiang people for food; if you go out of Qishan, there will be wheat to eat: it will come out of the five."" Chen Tai said in admiration: ""The public materials are like gods, so why should the soldiers of Shu worry about it!"" So Chen Tai said He and Deng Ai became good friends. Ai Sui commanded the soldiers of Yong and Liang, and practiced them every day, and set up camps in every pass to prevent accidents.","Although the Wei commanders, Deng Ai and Chen Tai, hold a banquet to celebrate defeating the Shu, they know that Jiang Wei will not be able to resist the temptation, despite all the odds, to try to invade yet again.","Jiang Wei camped at Zhongti. The army of Wei camped outside Didao. Wang Jing welcomed Chen Tai and Deng Ai and prepared a banquet to celebrate the raising of the siege and also rewarded the army with gifts. Then Chen Tai sent up a memorial to the Ruler of Wei, Cao Mao, eulogizing the magnificent services of Deng Ai, who was rewarded with the title General Who Pacifies the West. For the time, Deng Ai was left in the west. He and Chen Tai placed their men in cantonments in Yongzhou, Xizhou, and the counties round about. After Deng Ai had rendered his thanks to the Emperor, Chen Tai spread a great feast in his honor, and in congratulating his guest, said, “Jiang Wei slipped off in the night because he was broken, and he will never dare to return.” “I think he will,” replied Deng Ai, smiling. “I can give five reasons why he should.” “What are they?” “First, although the soldiers of Shu have retired, they have the self-possessed and confident look of holding the victory; our soldiers are really weak and broken. Second, the soldiers of Shu were trained and inspirited by Zhuge Liang and are easy to mobilize; our generals are all of different periods of service, and our army indifferently trained. Third, the Shu soldiers often use boats for traveling; ours do all their journeys on land, so that while one army moves at leisure and the troops arrive fresh, those of the other arrive fatigued with marching. Fourth, again, Didao, Longxi, Nanan, and Qishan are all places suitable for defense or use as battle fields, and thus the army of Shu can conceal their intentions and strike where they will; we have to remain on guard at many points, thus dividing our forces. When they concentrate, they have only to reckon with a part of our force. And fifth, if they come out by way of Longxi and Nanan, they have the grain of the Qiangs to depend upon; and if they choose Qishan, they have the wheat there. These are the five reasons why they should make another expedition.” Chen Tai was overcome with the clear vision of his new colleague. “Sir, your foresight is godlike. I think we need feel no anxiety about what the enemy can achieve.” The two leaders became the best of friends in spite of the difference of age. Deng Ai spent his time in training the army, and garrisons were placed at all points where surprise attacks seemed possible."

當日席散，孔明親送法正歸館舍。玄德獨坐沈吟。龐統進曰：“事當決而不決者，愚人也。主公高明，何多疑耶？”玄德問曰：“以公之意，當復何如？”統曰：“荊州東有孫權，北有曹操，難以得志。益州戶口百萬，土廣財富，可資大業。今幸張松、法正為內助，此天賜也。何必疑哉？”玄德曰：“今與吾水火相敵者，曹操也。操以急，吾以寬；操以暴，吾以仁；操以譎，吾以忠：每與操相反，事乃可成。若以小利而失信義於天下，吾不忍也。”龐統笑曰：“主公之言，雖合天理，奈離亂之時，用兵爭強，固非一道；若拘執常理，寸步不可行矣，宜從權變。且兼弱攻昧，逆取順守。湯、武之道也。若事定之後，報之以義，封為大國，何負於信？今日不取，終被他人取耳：主公幸熟思焉。”玄德乃恍然曰：“金石之言，當銘肺腑。”於是遂請孔明，同議起兵西行。孔明曰：“荊州重地，必須分兵守之。”玄德曰：“吾與龐士元、黃忠、魏延前往西川；軍師可與關雲長、張翼德、趙子龍守荊州。”孔明應允。於是孔明總守荊州；關公拒襄陽要路，當靑泥隘口；張飛領四郡巡江；趙雲屯江陵，鎮公安。玄德令黃忠為前部，魏延為後軍，玄德自與劉封、關平在中軍，龐統為軍師，馬步兵五萬，起程西行。臨行時，忽廖化引一軍來降。玄德便敎廖化輔佐雲長以拒曹操。,"The banquet was dispersed that day, and Kong Ming personally sent Fazheng back to the residence. Xuande sat alone and pondered. Pang Tongjin said, ""Those who do not decide when things should be decided, are fools. Your lord is brilliant, why are you suspicious?"" Xuande asked, ""What should be done in your opinion?"" Tong said, ""There is Sun Quan in the east of Jingzhou, and in the north With Cao Cao, it's hard to get the ambition. Yizhou has a household registration of one million, and the land is extensive and wealthy, which can be used for a great cause. Today, Zhang Song and Fazheng are fortunate to be internal helpers, and this is a gift from heaven. The enemy is Cao Cao. Cao Cao. If he is urgent, I will be wide; if he will be violent, I will be benevolent; if he will be deceitful, I will be loyal: every time it is contrary to Cao, things can be accomplished. I can't bear it."" Pang Tong laughed and said, ""Although the words of the lord are in line with the laws of nature, when there is chaos, the use of troops to fight for strength is not one way; Take obedience and keep it. The way of Tang and Wu is also. If things are settled, they will be repaid with righteousness, and they will be named a great country, why should they lose faith? If they do not take it today, they will eventually be taken by others: Your lord is fortunate to have thought about it carefully.” Xuande suddenly said: ""The words of gold and stone should be etched in the heart."" So he invited Kongming to discuss raising an army to the west. Kong Ming said: ""Jingzhou is an important place, and we must divide our troops to defend it."" Xuande said: ""I and Pang Shiyuan, Huang Zhong, Wei Yan go to Xichuan; the military advisor can guard Jingzhou with Guan Yunchang, Zhang Yide, and Zhao Zilong."" Kong Ming agreed. Therefore, Kong Ming guarded Jingzhou; Guan Gong refused Xiangyang's main road, and took the place of the Ni Ni pass; Zhang Fei led the four counties to patrol the river; Zhao Yun settled the Jiangling, and the town police. Xuande ordered Huang Zhong to be the front, Wei Yan to the rear, Xuan Dezi, Liu Feng and Guan Ping in the middle army, Pang Tong as the military division, and 50,000 horses and infantry, and set off westward. Before leaving, Liao Hua suddenly led an army to surrender. Xuande then instructed Liao Hua to assist Yun Chang to reject Cao Cao.","To be honest it is as if the land is being presented to you.’ This calms Xuande’s nerves. Later that night, Pang Tong comes to him while he is wondering what the right course might be. Xuande points out that he is the complete opposite of Cao Cao. ‘ Where Cao uses aggression, I seek reflection,’ he says. ‘Where Cao is vicious, I am humane; where Cao is wily, I’m straightforward. It’s these differences which have given me the moral high ground. But if I attack my kinsman, all that would be lost.’ Pang Tong argues, ‘That is all well and fine in ordinary times. But these are extraordinary times. There is no clear “right path”. You should follow the way of the ancient rulers – seize power but then maintain it with integrity. Give Liu a region to rule by himself but under you and what wrong will you have done? For if you do not take the land, then someone else certainly will.’ Finally, this seems to put Xuande’s heart at rest, and he agrees to go. Dividing his forces, and leaving Kong Ming in charge at Jingzhou with Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and Zhao Zilong in case of attack, he takes Pang Tong, Huang Zhong and Wei Yan with him. So, with a combined force of fifty thousand men, they set off for Shu, having first informed Liu Zhang of their coming. Liu Zhang decides to go and meet Xuande at Fucheng.","The banquet terminated and the guest left. Zhuge Liang conducted Fa Zheng to his lodging while his master sat thinking. Then Pang Tong said, “You must decide; not to decide is foolish. You are of high intelligence, my lord, and why do you hesitate?” “What should my reply be?” asked Liu Bei. “You know these surroundings, and with them you cannot attain your ends. Now before you lies a populous, fertile, and rich land, a base with the greatest possibilities. You have the promise of assistance from two men within, and it seems like a gift of providence. Why hesitate?” “Now there are two men in the world as mutually antagonistic as fire and water. My opposite is Cao Cao. He is impetuous and I am long suffering; he is cruel and I am humane; he feigns while I am true. In all particulars I act the direct contrary to him. I refuse to risk the loss of the confidence and trust of the world for a trifling advantage.” Pang Tong smiled at these sentiments, saying, “My lord's words are quite in accord with abstract rectitude, but such ideas scarcely suit the days of rebellion. There are other ways of fighting than with warlike weapons, but to adhere too obstinately to the idea of abstract rectitude is to do nothing. One must be an opportunist, annex the weak and attack the willfully deluded, seize the recalcitrant and protect the docile. These were the teachings of the great Kings Tang and Wu. If after the settlement you reward with righteousness and make of the land a great country, will you be guilty of a breach of trust? Remember if you do not take it now, another will.” Liu Bei, a prey to confused emotions, replied, “These words are as jewels; they should be engraved on my very heart.” Thereupon he summoned Zhuge Liang to settle the details of an army to march west. Zhuge Liang said, “This is an important place and must be very well defended.” Liu Bei replied, “I, Pang Tong, and my two generals Huang Zhong and Wei Yan will go into the west; you and our three best generals—Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhao Yun—can defend Jingzhou.” Guan Yu was told off for Xiangyang and the narrow pass at Qingni, Zhang Fei commanded four cities along the river, and Zhao Yun camped at Jiangling. For the march westward, Huang Zhong led the van, Wei Yan had the rearguard, while Liu Bei moved in the center with Liu Feng and Guan Ping as his aids. Pang Tong was Commander of the whole army. Just as the fifty thousand troops were starting, there came Liao Hua to offer his service; he and his troops were attached to Guan Yu."

却說玄德提兵回涪城，先令人報上涪水關，請楊懷、高沛出關相別。楊、高二將聞報，商議曰：“玄德此回若何？”高沛曰：“玄德合死。我等各藏利刃在身，就送行處刺之，以絕吾主之患。”楊懷曰：“此計大妙。”二人只帶隨行二百人，出關送行，其餘並留在關上。玄德大軍盡發。前至涪水之上，龐統在馬上謂玄德曰：“楊懷、高沛若欣然而來，可隄防之；若彼不來，便起兵逕取其關，不可遲緩。”正說間，忽起一陣旋風，把馬前“帥”字旗吹倒。玄德問龐統曰：“此何兆也？”統曰：“此警報也。楊懷、高沛二人必有行刺之意，宜善防之。”玄德乃身披重鎧，自佩寶劍防備。人報楊、高二將前來送行。玄德令軍馬歇定。龐統分付魏延、黃忠：“但關上來的軍士，不問多少，馬步軍兵，一個也休放回。”二將得令而去。,"But he said that Xuande sent troops back to Fucheng, and he first sent them to Fushui Pass, and asked Yang Huai and Gao Pei to leave the pass. When Yang and Gao 2 heard the report, they discussed and said, ""What is Xuande going to do this time?"" Gao Pei said, ""Xuande will die together. We will all have sharp knives in our bodies, and we will send them off and stab them, so as to avoid my lord's troubles."" Yang Huai said, ""This is a great plan."" The two of them only took 200 people with them and went out of the pass to see them off, while the rest stayed at the pass. Xuande's army is full. When they reached the top of the Fushui River, Pang Tong immediately called Xuande: ""If Yang Huai and Gao Pei are happy to come here, they can guard against them. A whirlwind blew down the ""handsome"" flag in front of the horse. Xuande asked Pang Tong, ""What sign is this?"" Tong said, ""This is an alarm. Yang Huai and Gao Pei must have the intention of stabbing, so they should be good at guarding against it."" Sword defense. People reported that Yang and the second year of high school will come to see him off. Xuande ordered the army to Xie Ding. Pang Tong paid Wei Yan and Huang Zhong separately: ""However, no matter how many sergeants have been locked up, none of the horse and infantry soldiers will be released."" The second general was ordered to leave.","Meanwhile, Xuande has arrived at the Fu pass and invites the two commanders, Yang Huai and Gao Pei, to come and pay their respects as he departs.","In the meantime, carrying out Pang Tong's scheme, Liu Bei had marched down to Fucheng, where he halted and sent in a messenger to invite the two generals to come forth and say farewell. But they did not respond at once to this invitation. “What is the real meaning of this retirement?” said one to the other. “This Liu Bei ought to die,” said Gao Pei. “Let us hide daggers under our dress and stab him at the place of farewell. That will end all our lord's troubles.” “A most excellent plan,” said Yang Huai. So they two, taking only a small escort of two hundred, went down out of the Pass to say goodbye. Most of their forces were left in the camp. On the way down to River Fu, Pang Tong had said to his master, “You have need to be on your guard against those two if they come to bid you farewell. If they do not come, then the Pass must be attacked without delay.” Just as he said this, a violent gust of wind overthrew the leading flag of the army, and Liu Bei asked what this portended. “That means a surprise; those two intend to assassinate you, so be on your guard.” Accordingly, Liu Bei put on double armor and girded on his sword in readiness. When the two generals arrived, the army halted while the generals should pay the farewell visit. Then Pang Tong said to his two generals, Wei Yan and Huang Zhong, “However many soldiers come down from the Pass, see to it that none return.”"
却說衆將保着許褚，回見曹操。操令醫士療治金瘡，一面親自提兵來與蜀兵決戰。玄德引軍出迎。兩陣對圓，玄德令劉封出馬。操罵曰：“賣履小兒：常使假子拒敵！吾若喚黃鬚兒來，汝假子為肉泥矣！”劉封大怒，挺鎗驟馬，逕取曹操。操令徐晃來迎，封詐敗而走。操引兵追趕，蜀兵營中，四下礮響，鼓角齊鳴。操恐有伏兵，急敎退軍。曹兵自相踐踏，死者極多。奔回陽平關，方纔歇定，蜀兵趕到城下，東門放火，西門吶喊；南門放火，北門擂鼓。操大懼，棄關而走。蜀兵從後追襲。操正走之間，前面張飛引一枝兵截住，趙雲引一枝兵從背後殺來，黃忠又引兵從褒州殺來。操大敗。諸將保護曹操，奪路而走。方逃至斜谷界口，前面塵頭忽起，一枝兵到。操曰：“此軍若是伏兵，吾休矣！”及兵將近，乃操次子曹彰也。,"But they said that the generals would protect Xu Chu and return to see Cao Cao. He ordered the medics to treat the golden sores, and personally brought troops to fight against the soldiers of Shu. Xuande led an army out to welcome him. The two battles were round, and Xuande ordered Liu Feng to go out. Cao scolded, ""Selling the little boy: I often make fake sons to resist the enemy! If I call Huang Xu'er, your fake son will be a piece of meat!"" Liu Feng was furious, he speared his horse, and took Cao Cao directly. Xu Huang was ordered to come to greet him, and he was defeated and left. Cao led his troops to chase, and in the Shu barracks, the drums and horns rang in unison. Cao feared that there would be an ambush, and hurriedly retreated. Cao soldiers trampled on each other, and many died. After running back to Yangping Pass, the soldiers of Shu rushed to the bottom of the city, setting fire at the east gate, shouting at the west gate; setting fire at the south gate, and beating drums at the north gate. Cao Da fear, abandon the pass and walk away. Shu soldiers pursued from behind. As Cao was walking, Zhang Fei led a soldier to intercept him, Zhao Yun led a soldier to kill from behind, and Huang Zhong led another soldier to kill from Baozhou. Fuck it. The generals protected Cao Cao and took the road away. Fang fled to the boundary of the Xiegu, when the dust head suddenly rose in front of him, and a soldier arrived. Cao said, ""If this army is in ambush, I will stop!"" As the soldiers approached, it was Cao Zhang, Cao's second son.","Zhang Fei sweeps down and in single combat severely wounds Xu Chu, who in his drunken state is not able to hold his own. The northerners flee, and the convoy falls into the hands of the men of Shu. This is the last straw for Cao Cao, who the next morning rides out to do battle once and for all with Xuande. It is a disaster for Cao Cao. Defeated, he tries to retreat to his camp at Yangping pass, and in the panic many of his men die trodden underfoot by other panic-ridden soldiers from their own side. Arriving at the pass, he tries to find safety there, only to be forced out by the enemy. Cao Cao flees, hotly pursued by Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong and Huang Zhong.","The defeated escort carried their wounded leader back to Cao Cao's camp, where he was placed in the care of physicians. Then Cao Cao himself led out his army to fight a decisive battle with the army of Shu. Liu Bei went out to meet him, and, when both sides were arrayed, Liu Feng went out to challenge. Cao Cao at once let loose a torrent of taunts and reproaches. “Seller of shoes, you are always sending out this pretended son of yours to fight for you. If I only call my golden-bearded son Cao Zhang, your so-called son will be chopped to mincemeat!” These words enraged Liu Feng, who raised his spear and galloped toward Cao Cao. Cao Cao bade Xu Huang do battle with the young man, and Liu Feng at once ran away. Cao Cao led on his legions, but he was harassed by the explosion of bombs, the beating of drums, and the blare of trumpets that came from every side. He concluded that he was being led into an ambush, and he hastened to retire. The retreat was unfortunate, for the soldiers trampled upon each other and many were killed. Anon they all ran off to Yangping Pass as quickly as they could. But the soldiers of Shu came right up to the walls of the Pass, and some burned the east gate while others shouted at the west. Others, again, burned the north gate while drums rolled at the south. Leaders and led were alike harassed and frightened, and presently they left the Pass and ran away. They were pursued and sore smitten. The road to safety was not easy. In one direction Zhang Fei barred the way, while Zhao Yun attacked the rear. Then Huang Zhong came from Baozhou and pressed a slaughter on the flank. Cao Cao's army lost many troops, and he was severely defeated in this triple attack. His commanders gathered about him and took him off toward the Xie Valley. Here a great cloud of dust was seen in the distance. “If that is an ambush, it is the last of me,” sighed Cao Cao. The soldiers came nearer, and then Cao Cao recognized not a enemy but his second son, Cao Zhang. As a lad Cao Zhang was a good horseman and an expert archer. He was more powerful than most men and could overcome a wild beast with his bare hands."

使者辭去。關平曰：“魯肅相邀，必無好意；父親何故許之？”雲長笑曰：“吾豈不知耶？此是諸葛瑾回報孫權，說吾不肯還三郡，故令魯肅屯兵陸口，邀我赴會，便索荊州。吾若不往，道吾怯矣。吾來日獨駕小舟，只用親隨十餘人，單刀赴會，看魯肅如何近我。”平諫曰：“父親奈何以萬金之軀，親蹈虎狼之穴？恐非所以重伯父之寄託也。”雲長曰：“吾於千鎗萬刃之中，矢石交攻之際，匹馬縱橫，如入無人之境；豈憂江東羣鼠乎！”馬良亦諫曰：“魯肅雖有長者之風，但今事急，不容不生異心。將軍不可輕往。”雲長曰：“昔戰國時趙人藺相如，無縛雞之力，於澠池會上，覷秦國君臣如無物；況吾曾學萬人敵者乎！旣已許諾，不可失信。”良曰：“縱將軍去，亦當有準備。”雲長曰：“只敎吾兒選快船十隻，藏善水軍五百，於江上等候。看吾認旗起處，便過江來。”平領命自去準備。,"The messenger resigned. Guan Ping said: ""Lu Su invites you, but there must be no good intentions; why did your father agree to it?"" Yun Chang smiled and said, ""I don't know that? This is Zhuge Jin's return to Sun Quan, saying that I would not return to the three counties, so Lu Su was ordered to do so. I was stationed at Lukou and invited me to the meeting, so I asked for Jingzhou. If I don’t go, I will be timid. I will drive a small boat by myself, and I will only go to the meeting with more than ten people in person, and see how Lu Su approaches me.” Ping Jian Said: ""How can my father walk in the cave of tigers and wolves with a body of ten thousand gold? I am afraid that it is not because of his uncle's sustenance."" Yun Chang said: ""I am in the midst of a thousand spears and ten thousand blades, when the arrows and stones are attacking, the horses are vertical and horizontal. How can you worry about the rats in the east of the Yangtze River?” Ma Liang also advised: “Although Lu Su has the style of being an elder, he is in a hurry now, and he cannot tolerate disagreements. Generals should not go lightly.” Yun Chang said: “ During the Warring States period, Zhao Ren Xiangru had no power to tie a chicken. At the Mianchi meeting, he looked at Qin's rulers and ministers as if they were nothing. Besides, I have learned from the enemy of ten thousand people! I have made a promise, and I must not break my trust."" Liang said: ""The vertical general When you go, you should be prepared."" Yun Chang said, ""Only instruct my son to choose ten fast boats and five hundred Zangshan sailors to wait on the river. When I see where the flag is raised, I will cross the river."" Ping Ling ordered himself to prepare.","Now, when the invitation arrives, Guan Yu agrees to go. But his son Guan Ping is deeply troubled. ‘Why have you accepted this invitation? This is clearly a trap.’ ‘Not to go,’ says Guan Yu, ‘would see me marked as a coward.’ ‘At the very least,’ says Guan Ping, ‘let me follow behind you with some men in case of trouble.’ Eventually Guan Yu agrees that Guan Ping can follow behind quietly with an armed force, ready to attack if summoned.","After the messenger had gone, Guan Ping said to his father, “Why did you promise to go? I think Lu Su means you no good.” “Do you think I do not know? This has all come out of my refusal to yield those three territories. They are going to try coercion at this banquet. If I refuse, they will think I fear them. I will go tomorrow in a small ship with just my ten personal guards, and we shall see whether Lu Su will dare to come near me.” “But, Father, why risk your priceless self in the very den of a tiger? I think you are not giving due importance to my uncle's charge.” “I have been in the midst of million blades and arrows, yet I have been riding through all directions like traveling through a meadow of no one; think you that I shall begin to show fear of a few such rats as those?” Nor was the son alone in remonstrance. Ma Liang also warned his chief. “Although Lu Su has a great repute, yet now he is pushed hard. He certainly is badly disposed toward you, and you must be careful, General.” Guan Yu replied, “I have given my word, and shall I withdraw from it? In the days of the Warring States, Liu Xiangru of the state of Zhao had not the force even to bind a chicken, yet in the assembly at Shengchi Lake he regarded not the prince and the ministers of the powerful state of Qin, but did his duty without fear of consequences. Have I not learned to face any number of foes? I cannot break my promise.” “If you must go,” said Ma Liang, “at least go prepared.” “Tell my son to choose out ten fast ships and five hundred of good marines and be in readiness to help me at need. And when he sees a red flag waved, he can come over to my aid.” The order was given and the little squadron was got ready."
又有詩讚翼德曰：,"Another poem praises Yide, saying:","In desperation, Lady Sun cries out for her maids to help, but Zhao Zilong simply brushes them aside and seizes the child, rushing out of the cabin onto the deck.",Another has eulogized Zhang Fei:
松觀其人：單眉細眼，貌白神淸。問其姓名，乃太尉楊彪之子楊修，字德祖，現為丞相門下掌庫主簿。此人博學能言，智識過人。松知修是個舌辯之士，有心難之。修亦自恃其才，小覷天下之士。當時見張松言語譏諷，遂邀出外面書院中，分賓主而坐，謂松曰：“蜀道崎嶇，遠來勞苦。”松曰：“奉主之命，雖赴湯蹈火，弗敢辭也。”修問：“蜀中風土何如？”松曰：“蜀為西郡，古號益州。路有錦江之險，地連劍閣之雄。回還二百八程，縱橫三萬餘里。雞鳴犬吠相聞，市井閭閻不斷。田肥地茂，歲無水旱之憂；國富民豐，時有管絃之樂。所產之物，阜如山積。天下莫可及也！”修又問曰：“蜀中人物如何？”松曰：“文有相如之賦，武有伏波之才；醫有仲景之能，卜有君平之隱。九流三敎，‘出乎其類，拔乎其萃’者，不可勝記，豈能盡數！”修又問曰：“方今劉季玉手下，如公者還有幾人？”松曰：“文武全才，智勇足備，忠義慷慨之士，動以百數，如松不才之輩，車載斗量，不可勝記。”修曰：“公近居何職？”松曰：“濫充別駕之任，甚不稱職。敢問公為朝廷何官？”修曰：“見為丞相府主簿。”松曰：“久聞公世代簪纓，何不立於廟堂，輔佐天子，乃區區作相府門下一吏乎？”楊修聞言，滿面羞慚，強顏而答曰：“某雖居下寮，丞相委以軍政錢糧之重，早晚多蒙丞相敎誨，極有開發，故就此職耳。”松笑曰：“松聞曹丞相文不明孔、孟之道，武不達孫、吳之機，專務強霸而居大位，安能有所敎誨，以開發明公耶？”修曰：“公居邊隅，安知丞相大才乎？吾試令公觀之。”呼左右於篋中取書一卷，以示張松。松觀其題曰：“孟德新書”。從頭至尾，看了一遍，共一十三篇，皆用兵之要法。松看畢，問曰：“公以此為何書耶？”修曰：“此是丞相酌古準今，倣《孫子十三篇》而作。公欺丞相無才，此堪以傳後世否？”松大笑曰：“此書吾蜀中三尺小童，亦能暗誦，何為‘新書’？此是戰國時無名氏所作，曹丞相盜竊以為己能，止好瞞足下耳！”修曰：“丞相祕藏之書，雖已成帙，未傳於世。公言蜀中小兒暗誦如流，何相欺乎？”松曰：“公如不信，吾試誦之。”遂將《孟德新書》，從頭至尾，朗誦一遍，並無一字差錯。修大驚曰：“公過目不忘，眞天下奇才也！”後人有詩讚曰：,"Song Guan's people: single eyebrows and narrow eyes, with a white appearance. When asked about his name, he was Yang Xiu, the son of Taiwei Yang Biao, whose courtesy name was Dezu. This man is erudite and eloquent. Song Zhixiu is a person who argues with words, and he has a hard heart. Xiu also relied on his talents and underestimated the scholars in the world. Seeing Zhang Song's sarcastic words at that time, he invited him out of the academy and sat down with the guest and the host. He said to Song, ""The road to Shu is rugged, so you have to work from afar."" Song said, ""On the order of the Lord, even though you go through fire and water, you will not dare to say goodbye."" Xiu asked: ""What is the local culture like in Shu?"" Song said: ""Shu is a western county, and the ancient name is Yizhou. The road has the danger of Jinjiang, and the ground is the hero of Jiange. It is two hundred and eight miles back, more than 30,000 miles in length and breadth. I heard from each other that the market is full of gluttons. The fields are fertile and the land is lush, and there is no worry of floods and droughts every year. ""What about the people in Shu?"" Song said: ""Writing has the gift of Xiangru, Wu has the talent of Fubo; medicine has the ability of Zhongjing, and divination has the hiddenness of Junping. There are so many who can’t be beaten, how can we count them all!” Xiu asked again, “How many people are Liu Jiyu’s subordinates, such as the Duke?” Song said, “All talents in civil and military, full of wisdom and courage, loyal and righteous. Generous people, who move in hundreds, are like the incompetent generation of Song, who can’t be remembered in the car.” Xiu said: “What position does the public have?” Song said: “It is very incompetent to take the responsibility of the other driver. Dare to ask who is the official of the imperial court?"" Xiu said, ""I see that he is the head of the prime minister's house."" Song said: ""I have heard for a long time that the prince has been wearing hairpins from generation to generation. When Yang Xiu heard the words, his face was ashamed, and he forced his face to answer: ""Although a certain person lives in Xialiao, the prime minister entrusts the military and government with money and rations. Sooner or later, he is often instructed by the prime minister. ""Song heard that Prime Minister Cao was ignorant of the way of Confucius and Meng, and Wu did not reach Sun and Wu Zhiji. He was in charge of power and hegemony and was in a high position. An Neng gave some advice to open up the invention of the Duke?"" Xiu said: ""Your Excellency In the corner of the border, is the Prime Minister Anzhi so talented? I will try to order the public to look at it."" Hu left and right took a volume of the book from the box to show Zhang Song. Song Guan said the title: ""Meng De's new book"". From the beginning to the end, I read it once, a total of 13 articles, all of which use the essential methods of warfare. After Song Song finished reading it, he asked, ""Why did the prince write this?"" Xiu said, ""This is the prime minister's judgment of the past and the present, imitating the ""Thirteen Chapters of Sun Tzu"". ?"" Song laughed and said, ""This book can also be recited in secret by a three-footed boy in Shu. What is a 'new book'? This was written by an anonymous man during the Warring States Period. ""The book in the secret collection of the prime minister, although it has been completed, has not been passed on to the world. It is said that children in Shu are reciting secretly, so why are they deceiving?"" German New Book, from beginning to end, recite it once without a single word error. Xiu was startled and said, ""I don't forget the Duke, he is truly a genius in the world!"" Later generations wrote a poem:","At this someone speaks up, saying, ‘You lot really have no idea how to flatter, do you?’ The speaker is Yang Xiu, a first secretary to Cao Cao. Intrigued by Zhang Song, he invites him to join him for talks in his library. Asked about the land of Shu, Zhang Song tells of the difficulties of access either by river or by road, and praises its productivity and its people. ‘Nowhere else on earth is so productive,’ he brags. In answer to Yang Xiu’s questions, he speaks about the men of fame that Shu has produced, the highly educated people at the court and their skills. He then questions Yang Xiu on why he holds what appears to him to be a lowly role, which makes Yang Xiu bristle: ‘ I have great responsibilities for the welfare of the army.’ Zhang Song says, ‘I understand that Cao Cao is ignorant of the teachings of Kong Fu Zi and Meng Zi,13 or the strategies for warfare of Sun Zi and Wu Qi. I gather it’s said of him that his only interest is in self-aggrandizement. Surely, you can learn nothing from one like this!’ To try to show how wrong he is, Yang Xiu brings out a scroll with the text of a book called New Book of Meng De, claiming that this had been written by none other than Cao Cao himself and based on Sun Zi’s famous Thirteen Strategies! Zhang Song quickly reads all thirteen chapters and then, laughing, says, ‘But this is nothing new! All the children in Shu know this old book – it was written centuries ago in the time of the Warring States.14 Cao Cao has simply copied it!’ Challenged by Yang Xiu to prove this, Zhang Song immediately repeats the text word for word. Astonished by this feat, Yang Xiu in admiration says, ‘You learned it in just one reading? You really are astonishing.’ A poet has said of Zhang Song:","Zhang Song looked around and saw the speaker was a man with thin delicate eyebrows crossing narrow eyes set in a pale spiritual face. He asked his name. It was Yang Xiu, son of the former Regent Marshal Yang Biao. The young man was then employed as Chief of the Secretariat of the Prime Minister. He was deeply read and had the reputation of being a clever controversialist, as Zhang Song knew. So on one side was a desire to confound and on the other overweening pride in his own ability, with contempt for other scholars. Perceiving the ridicule in Zhang Song's speech, Yang Xiu invited him to go to the library where they could talk more freely. There, after they had got settled in their respective places, Yang Xiu began to talk about the west. “Your roads are precipitous and wearisome,” said Yang Xiu. “But at our lord's command we travel, even through fire and water; we never decline,” replied Zhang Song. “What sort of a country is this Yiazhou?” “Yiazhou is a name for the group of western counties and territories known of old as the state of Shu. The roads are intersected by streams, and the land bristles with steep mountains. The circuit is over two hundred stations and marches and the area over one hundred thousand square miles. The population is dense, villages being so close that the crowings of cocks in one waken the people in the next, and the dogs barking in this excite the curs in that. The soil is rich and well cultivated, and droughts or famines are equally unknown. Prosperity is general and the music of pipes and strings can always be heard. The produce of the fields is piled mountain high. There is no place its equal.” “But what of the people?” “Our administrators are talented as Sima Xiangru; our soldiers able as Ma Yuan; our physicians are expert as Zhang Ji; our diviners are profound as Yan Zun. Our schools of philosophy and our culture stand forth as models, and we have more remarkable people than I can enumerate. How should I ever finish the tale of them?” “And how many such as you, Sir, do you think there are at the orders of your Imperial Protector?” “Our officers are all geniuses: wise, bold, loyal, righteous, and magnanimous. As for poor simpletons like me, they are counted by hundreds; there are cartloads of them, bushels of them. No one could count them.” “What office may you hold then?” Zhang Song replied, “Mine can hardly be called an office. I am a Supernumerary Charioteer. But, Sir, what state affairs may you control?” “I am the First Secretary in the Palace of the Prime Minister,” replied Yang Xiu. “They say that members of your family held office for many generations, and I do not understand why you are not in court service actually assisting the Emperor, instead of filling the post of a mere clerk in the private palace of the Prime Minister.” Yang Xiu's face suffused with shame at this rebuke, but he mastered himself and replied, “Though I am among the minor officials, yet my duties are of great importance, and I am gaining experience under the Prime Minister's guidance. I hold the office for the sake of the training.” Zhang Song smiled, saying, “If what I have heard is true, Cao Cao's learning throws no gleaming light on the way of Confucius or Mencius, nor does his military skill illumine the art of Sun Zi or Wu Qi. He seems to understand the doctrine of brute force and holding on to what advantages he can seize, but I see not how he can give you any valuable training or enlighten your understanding.” “Ah, Sir; that comes of dwelling in out-of-the-way parts. How could you know of the magnificent talents of the great Prime Minister? But I will show you something.” Yang Xiu called up an attendant and bade him bring a book from a certain case. He showed this to his guest, who read the title “The New Book of Cao Cao”. Then Zhang Song opened it and read it through from the beginning, the whole thirteen chapters. They all dealt with the art of war. “What do you take this to be?” asked Zhang Song, when he had finished. “This is the great Prime Minister's discussion of the art of ancient and modern war composed on the model of Sun Zi's Treatise on the Art of War. You may be disdainful of the Prime Minister's talents, but will this not go down to posterity?” “This book! Every child in Yiazhou knows this by heart. What do you mean by calling it a new book? It was written by some obscure person of the time of the Warring States, and Cao Cao has plagiarized it. But he has deceived no one but you, Sir.” “But what is the use of your sarcastic insult in saying that your school children know the book by rote? It has never been given to the world, although copies have been made. It belongs to his private library.” “Do you disbelieve me? Why, I know it and could repeat it.” Then Zhang Song repeated the whole book, word for word, from beginning to end. Yang Xiu said, “You remember it like this after only one reading! Really you are marvelous.” He boasted not a handsome face,"
却說吳主孫權設朝，有細作人報說：“蜀諸葛丞相出兵兩次，魏都督曹眞兵損將亡。”於是羣臣皆勸吳王興師伐魏，以圖中原。權猶豫未決。張昭奏曰：“近聞武昌東山，鳳凰來儀；大江之中，黃龍屢現。主公德配唐、虞，明並文、武：可卽皇帝位，然後興兵。”多官皆應曰：“子布之言是也。”遂選定夏四月丙寅日，築臺於武昌南郊。是日，羣臣請權登壇卽皇帝位，改黃武八年為黃龍元年。諡父孫堅為武烈皇帝，母吳氏為武烈皇后，兄孫策為長沙桓王。立子孫登為皇太子。命諸葛瑾長子諸葛恪為太子左輔，張昭次子張休為太子右弼。,"However, it was said that Sun Quan, the master of Wu, set up a dynasty, and a meticulous reporter reported: ""Prime Minister Zhuge of Shu sent troops twice, and Cao Zhen, the governor of Wei, was damaged and will die."" So all the ministers persuaded the king of Wu to raise his divisions to attack Wei, in order to show the original. Right hesitates. Zhang Zhao said: ""I heard recently that the phoenix came to the east mountain of Wuchang, and the yellow dragon appeared frequently in the river. The lord's virtue is matched with Tang and Yu, and Ming and Wen and Wu: you can take the throne of the emperor, and then raise the army."" Many officials responded. : ""Zibu's words are true."" So he chose the Bingyin day in the summer of April to build a platform in the southern suburbs of Wuchang. On that day, the ministers asked Quan to ascend the throne of the Emperor, and the eighth year of Huangwu was changed to the first year of Huanglong. His posthumous father, Sun Jian, was Emperor Wulie, his mother was Empress Wulie, and his brother, Sun Ce, was King Huan of Changsha. He made his descendants the crown prince. He ordered Zhuge Jin's eldest son Zhuge Ke to be the prince Zuo Fu, and Zhang Zhao's second son Zhang Xiu to be the crown prince Youbi.","In the south, Sun Quan is informed of the developments in the north, and it is recommended that he attack the north while they are licking their wounds. It is then that Zhang Zhao announces that auspicious signs have been observed – a phoenix and a dragon have been seen. ‘Your virtue is as great as that of Yao and Shun, while your wisdom is equal to that of Wen and Wu,’28says Zhang Zhao. ‘It is time, therefore, to take up the Mandate of Heaven and become the emperor and then as emperor send the army to war!’ Many others also suggest this, and at last Sun Quan agrees. An altar is built for the enthronement, and in the early summer of 229 Sun Quan becomes emperor. After the enthronement Zhang Zhao says to the new emperor, ‘Do not rush into war so soon after your enthronement.","At a court held by Sun Quan, the Prince of Wu, a certain spy reported the doings in the west and the damages Wei had suffered in Zhuge Liang's expeditions. Thereupon certain ministers urged on Sun Quan that he should attack Wei and try to gain the Middle Land. However, Sun Quan could not make up his mind, and Zhang Zhao endeavored to prove to him that his hour was come by this memorial: “I have heard that a phoenix has lately appeared in the hills east of Wuchang and bowed; that a yellow dragon has been seen in the Great River. My lord, your virtue matches that of Kings Tang and Yu, and your understanding is on a level with that of Kings Wu and Wen. Wherefore you should now proceed to the imperial style and then raise an army to maintain your authority.” And many other officers supported Zhang Zhao's proposal. They finally persuaded Sun Quan to decide upon the 'tiger' day in the forth month, in summer. They prepared an altar on the south of Wuchang, and on that day his courtiers formally requested him to ascend to the high place and assume the style of “Emperor.” “Yellow Dragon” was chosen as the style of the reign. Sun Jian, the deceased father of the new Emperor, was given the title of the Martially Glorious Emperor, his mother Empress Wu, and his elder brother, Sun Ce, was made posthumously Prince of Changsha, and his son, Sun Deng, was styled Heir Apparent. The rank of Left Companion of the Heir Apparent was conferred upon the eldest son of Zhuge Jin, Zhuge Ke. The rank of Right Companion of the Heir Apparent was bestowed upon the second son of Zhang Zhao, Zhang Xiu. This son of Zhuge Jin was a person below middle height, but very clever, and especially apt at capping verses."
叡覽表怒曰：“董尋不怕死耶！”左右奏請斬之。叡曰：“此人素有忠義，今且廢為庶人。再有妄言者必斬！”時有太子舍人張茂，字彥材，亦上表切諫，叡命斬之。卽日召馬鈞問曰：“朕建高臺峻閣，欲與神仙往來，以求長生不老之方。”鈞奏曰：“漢朝二十四帝，惟武帝享國最久，壽算極高，蓋因服天上日精月華之氣也：嘗於長安宮中，建柏梁臺；臺上立一銅人，手捧一盤，名曰‘承露盤’，接三更北斗所降沆瀣之水——其名曰‘天漿’，又曰‘甘露’。取此水用美玉為屑，調和服之，可以反老還童。”叡大喜曰：“汝今可引人夫星夜至長安，拆取銅人，移置芳林園中。”,"Rui Lan said angrily, ""Dong Xun is not afraid of death!"" Rui said: ""This person has always been loyal and righteous, and now he will be abolished as a commoner. If he speaks again, he will be executed!"" On the next day, Ma Jun was summoned and asked, ""I have built high towers and lofty pavilions, and I want to communicate with gods and immortals, so as to seek immortality."" It is extremely high, because it is also because of the spirit of the sun and moon in the sky: I tasted it in Chang'an Palace, built a Bailiang platform; on the platform stood a bronze figure, holding a plate in his hand, named 'Chenglu plate', and it was connected to the three-shift Beidou. The water - its name is 'Heavenly Juice', and it is also called 'Nanlu'. Take this water and use beautiful jade as shavings, blend it, and rejuvenate it."" Rui Daxi said: ""You can lead people to starry nights today. Chang'an, dismantle the bronze figurines and place them in the Fanglin Garden.""","Such remonstrations are dismissed angrily by Cao Rui, and one official even pays for such temerity with his life. Finally, Cao Rui demolishes the huge bronze statue, created centuries before, which stands in Chang’an and, so legend tells, brought longevity to the greatest of the Han rulers.","“Has the man no fear of death?” said Cao Rui, greatly angered. The courtiers requested the Emperor to put Dong Xun to death, but Cao Rui remembered his rectitude and proven loyalty and only degraded him, adding a warning to put to death those who would remonstrate. A certain Zhang Mao, in the service of the Heir Apparent, also ventured upon a remonstrance. Cao Rui put him to death immediately. Then Cao Rui summoned his Master of Works, Ma Jun, and said, “I have built high terraces and lofty towers with intent to hold intercourse with gods and goddesses, that I may obtain from them the elixir of life.” Then Ma Jun replied, “Of the four and twenty emperors of the line of Latter Han, only Emperor Wu enjoyed the throne very long and really attained to old age. That was because he drank of the essence of the brilliancy of the sun and the brightness of the moon. In the Palace at Changan is the Terrace of Cypress Beams, upon which stands the bronze figure of a man holding up a Dew Bowl, whereinto distills, in the third watch of the night, the vapor from the great constellation of the north. This liquid is called Celestial Elixir, or Sweet Dew. If mingled with powdered jade and swallowed, it restores youth to the aged.” “Take workers to Changan immediately and bring hither the bronze figure to set up in the Fragrant Forest Park,” said the Ruler of Wei."
於是童子引王平等一起啞軍，來到溪邊，汲水飲之；隨卽吐出惡涎，便能言語。童子又引衆軍到萬安溪中沐浴。隱者於庵中進柏子茶、松花菜，以待孔明。隱者告曰：“此間蠻洞多毒蛇惡蝎，柳花飄入溪泉之間，水不可飲；但掘地為泉，汲水飲之方可。”孔明求“薤葉芸香”，隱者令衆軍儘意採取：“各人口含一葉，自然瘴氣不侵。”孔明拜求隱者姓名。隱者笑曰：“某乃孟獲之兄孟節是也。”孔明愕然。隱者又曰：“丞相休疑，容伸片言：某一父母所生三人：長卽老夫孟節，次孟獲，又次孟優。父母皆亡。二弟強惡，不歸王化。某屢諫不從，故更名改姓，隱居於此。今辱弟造反，又勞丞相深入不毛之地，如此生受，孟節合該萬死：故先於丞相之前請罪。”孔明歎曰：“方信盜跖、下惠之事，今亦有之。”遂與孟節曰：“吾申奏天子，立公為王，可乎？”節曰：“為嫌功名而逃於此，豈復有貪富貴之意？”孔明乃具金帛贈之。孟節堅辭不受。孔明嗟欺不已，拜別而回。後人有詩曰：,"So the boy led Wang Pingping along with the dumb army, came to the stream, drew water and drank it; with the spit, he was able to speak. The boy led the army to take a bath in the Wan'an River. In the nunnery, the hermit brought cypress tea and cauliflower to wait for Kongming. The hermit said: ""There are many poisonous snakes and scorpions in the caves here, and the willow flowers float between the streams and springs, and the water cannot be drunk; but the ground is dug to form a spring, and the only way to drink is to draw water."" He ordered all the troops to take it with all their might: ""Each mouth contains a leaf, and naturally the miasma will not invade."" Kong Ming asked for the name of the hermit. The hermit laughed and said, ""Someone is Meng Huo's brother Meng Jie."" Kong Ming was stunned. The hermit also said: ""The prime minister is not suspicious, and Rong Shen said in a few words: There are three people born to a certain parent: the old man Meng Jie, the second Meng Huo, and the second Meng You. Both parents are dead. A certain repeatedly refused to obey, so he changed his name and surname and lived in seclusion here. Now he has insulted his younger brother for rebelling, and he has also labored the prime minister to go deep into the barren land. If he suffers like this, Meng Jiehe deserves to die: so he pleads guilty before the prime minister."" Kong Ming sighed: "" Fang Xin’s robbery of Zhi and Xiahui is also happening today.” So he asked Meng Jie, “Isn’t it okay for me to declare the Son of Heaven and appoint a prince as king?” Jie said, “Why do you flee here because you are disgusted with your fame and fame? Do you have the intention of coveting wealth and honor?"" Kong Ming was gifted with gold and silk. Meng Jie firmly refused. Kong Ming was so deceived, he said goodbye and returned. A later poem says:","The hermit shows the men where to bathe, and they are cured. He also shows Kong Ming the herb to be chewed as a protection. ‘And who are you, sir?’ enquires Kong Ming. ‘I am Meng Huo’s elder brother, Meng Jie.’ Kong Ming is completely taken aback at this. ‘Do not be too surprised,’ says Meng Jie. ‘Let me explain. We are indeed three brothers. Our parents died, and my two brothers have taken to the way of evil and will not obey the king nor be part of civilized life. I’ve tried to stop them but to no avail, so have retreated here. I’m so sorry that their crimes have been such a curse for you","As soon as they had drunk, they coughed up some poisoned mucus and could speak. The lad also led the soldiers to the Spring of Eternal Peace where they could bathe. In the cottage the recluse regaled Zhuge Liang with tea made of cypress seeds and a conserve of pine flowers. He also told his guest, saying, “In this region, the lands are full of serpents and scorpions, and the lily flowers blown into the springs by the wind make them unfit to drink. However, if you dig wells, you will find good water.” Then Zhuge Liang begged some of the garlic-leaved herb as an antidote against malaria. The recluse said the soldiers could pluck as much as they wanted. And so every one put a leaf in his mouth and thus became malaria-proof. Zhuge Liang, with a low bow then begged to be told the name of his benefactor. “I am Meng Huo's eldest brother,” said the recluse, smiling. “My name is Meng Jie.” Zhuge Liang started. “Do not be afraid,” said the recluse. “Let me explain. We were three brothers of the same parents, the eldest being myself. Our parents are both dead. My brother Meng Huo, being headstrong and vicious, has never been amenable to culture. I have talked to him many times, but he kept his own course. Finally, under an assumed name, I retired to this spot. I am ashamed for my brother's rebellion, which has put you, O Minister, to the trouble of making this expedition into a barren country, but it has given me the privilege of seeing you. For my responsibility in this I deserve to die a thousand times, as I own to your face, and I beg your pardon.” Zhuge Liang sighed, saying, “Now I believe that story of the robber Liu Zhi and the noble Liu Xiahui; this is the same thing over again. People renowned for villainy and virtue may come from the same stock.” Then he said to his host, “Would you wish me to represent your merits to the Emperor and get you created a king?” “How can you think I desire honors or wealth when I am here because of my contempt for all such things?” Zhuge Liang then wished to make him certain presents, but the recluse would have none of them. So taking leave of his host, Zhuge Liang went back to his camp. In the southern expedition when the Mangs were subdued, Zhuge Liang found a high-born recluse in a shady solitude."

益州從事臣王累，泣血懇告：竊聞“良藥苦口利於病，忠言逆耳利於行”。昔楚懷王不聽屈原之言，會盟於武關，為秦所困。今主公輕離大郡，欲迎劉備於涪城，恐有去路而無回路矣。倘能斬張松於市，絕劉備之約，則蜀中老幼幸甚，主公之基業亦幸甚！,"Wang Lei, a minister in Yizhou, cried blood and pleaded: ""Good medicine is bitter in the mouth and good for disease, and good advice is good for deeds."" In the past, King Huai of Chu did not listen to Qu Yuan's words, and he would ally at Wuguan and be trapped by Qin. Now that the lord has left the big county lightly, and wants to welcome Liu Bei in Fucheng, there may be a way out but no way out. If you can kill Zhang Song in the city and break the promise of Liu Bei, then the young and old in Shu will be very lucky, and the foundation of the lord will be very lucky!","Furious that he is being denounced in this manner when he sees himself as going to meet ‘a benevolent and just man’, Liu Zhang goes on his way.","Of old King Huai of Chu listened not to Qu Yuan, but attended the meeting at Wu Pass and was captured by the state of Qin. Sir, you are thoughtlessly leaving your place to go to welcome Liu Bei, but I fear there is a way out and none in. Could you but behead Zhang Song in the market place and have nothing to do with this league with Liu Bei, it would be for the happiness of old and young, and assure the safety of yourself.”"
却說雍州征西將軍陳泰，正欲起兵與王經報兵敗之讎，忽兗州刺史鄧艾引兵到。泰接着，禮畢。艾曰：“今奉大將軍之命，特來助將軍破敵。”泰問計於鄧艾。艾曰：“洮水得勝，若招羌人之衆，東爭關隴，傳檄四郡：此吾兵之大患也——今彼不思如此，却圖狄道城：其城垣堅固，急切難攻，空勞兵費力耳。吾今陳兵於項嶺，然後進兵擊之，蜀兵必敗矣。”陳泰曰：“眞妙論也！”遂先撥二十隊兵：每隊五十人，盡帶旌旗、鼓角、烽火之類，日伏夜行，去狄道城東南高山深谷之中埋伏；只待兵來，一齊鳴鼓吹角為應，夜則舉火放礮以驚之。調度已畢，專候蜀兵到來。於是陳泰、鄧艾，各引二萬兵相繼而進。,"However, it was said that Chen Tai, the general of Yongzhou's expedition to the west, was about to raise troops to report the defeat to Wang Jing, when Deng Ai, the prefect of Yanzhou, brought troops. Tai then, Li Bi. Ai said: ""At the command of the general, I have come here to help the general defeat the enemy."" Tai asked Deng Ai to plan. Ai said: ""If Taoshui is victorious, if you recruit a crowd of Qiang people to fight for Guanlong in the east, and spread the word to the four counties: this is a great trouble for my army. Now he doesn't think about it, but he tries to figure out the city of Di Dao: its walls are strong, and it is urgent to be difficult. Attacking, empty and laborious. I am sending troops to Xiangling now, and then I will advance to attack them, and the soldiers of Shu will be defeated."" Chen Tai said: ""It's really wonderful!"" With all the flags, drum horns, beacon fires, and the like, they traveled day and night, and went to ambush in the mountains and deep valleys in the southeast of Didao City; only waiting for the soldiers to come, they responded with trumpets and trumpets, and at night they set fire to set fire to alarm. Scheduling has been completed, waiting for the arrival of Shu soldiers. So Chen Tai and Deng Ai each led 20,000 soldiers to advance.",Chen Tai moves his army of Wei troops to the defence of Didao.,"Chen Tai, General Who Conquers the West and Commander of Yongzhou, was just about to set out to avenge the defeat of Wang Jing when Deng Ai, Imperial Protector of Yanzhou, arrived with his army. Chen Tai welcomed him, and when Deng Ai had said he had come by imperial edict to assist to defeat the army of Shu, Chen Tai asked his plans. Deng Ai replied, “They are victors on River Yao. If they enlist the aid of the Qiangs to cause a diversion in Longyou and Guanzhong and also obtain the support of the four counties, it will be a misfortune for us. If they do not think of that, but try to take Didao, they will only fritter away their energies against a place too strongly fortified for them to capture. Let us now array our force along the Xiangling Mountain, and then we can advance and smite them. We shall get a victory.” “That is well said!” cried Chen Tai. Then twenty cohorts of fifty soldiers each were told off to find their way secretly to the southeast of Didao and there hide in the valleys. They were then to display many ensigns and sound trumpets as if they were a very large force, and make huge fires at night, so as to cause anxiety among the enemy. And thus they waited for the troops of Shu to come, while Chen Tai and Deng Ai marched with forty thousand troops against the Shu army."
※※※,※※※,"Hearing of this, Cao Cao asks for a volunteer to go to protect the convoy, and Xu Chu puts himself forward.",Cao Cao's scouts sent out from Yangping Pass returned to report: “
却說關平見關公箭瘡已合，甚是喜悅。忽聽得于禁移七軍於樊城之北下寨，未知其謀，卽報知關公。公遂上馬，引數騎上高阜處望之，見樊城城上旗號不整，軍士慌亂；城北十里山谷之內，屯着軍馬；又見襄江水勢甚急。看了半晌，喚鄕導官問曰：“樊城北十里山谷，是何地名？”對曰：“罾口川也。”關公喜曰：“于禁必為我擒矣。”衆軍士問曰：“將軍何以知之？”關公曰：“‘魚’入‘罾口’，豈能久乎？”諸將未信。公回本寨。時值八月秋天，驟雨數日。公令人預備船筏，收拾水具。關平問曰：“陸地相持，何用水具？”公曰：“非汝所知也：于禁七軍不屯於廣易之地，而聚於罾口川險隘之處；方今秋雨連綿，襄江之水，必然泛漲；吾已差人堰住各處水口，待水發時，乘高就船，放水一渰，樊城、罾口川之兵皆為魚鱉矣。”關平拜服。,"But he said that Guan Ping was very happy to see that Guan Gong's arrow sore was closed. Suddenly, I heard that Yu Jin moved the seven troops to the north of Fancheng, and I didn't know his plan, so I reported to Guan Gong. The duke then mounted his horse, and the Quotations rode up to Gaofu to look at him, and saw that the banners on Fancheng City were not in order, and the soldiers were in a panic; within the valley ten miles north of the city, military horses were stationed; After looking at it for a long time, I called the commander Yan and asked, ""What is the name of the valley ten miles north of Fancheng?"" He replied, ""Jinkou River."" Guan Gongxi said, ""Yuji will be captured for me."" The soldiers asked, ""How did the general know about it?"" Guan Gong said, ""How long does it take for 'fish' to enter the 'Jinkou'?"" The generals did not believe it. The public returns to the village. It was autumn in August and it rained for a few days. The public ordered the raft to be prepared and the water gear to be packed. Guan Ping asked: ""The land is stalemate, what kind of water is there?"" The public said: ""It's not what you know: the Seventh Imperial Army is not stationed in the Guangyi place, but gathered in the dangerous pass of the Jingkou River; The water of the Xiangjiang River will inevitably rise; I have sent people to weir the water inlets everywhere, and when the water starts, I will take a boat from a high altitude and release the water once, and the soldiers of Fancheng and Jingkou River will all be fish and turtles."" Guan Ping worshipped and served. .","When Guan Yu comes to view the new site of the enemy encampment, he notes with interest that they are camped in low-lying land beside the rushing Xiang River. He is even more delighted to learn that the valley they have camped in is called Fishnet stream. ‘This is a sign that we will win,’ he says, ‘because the fish has entered the trap.’ It is the late autumn of AD 219, and the rains are heavy. As a result the river is swollen. Guan Yu has boats made.","To Guan Ping's great joy, Guan Yu's wound soon healed. Soon after they heard of Yu Jin's new camp, and as Guan Ping could assign no reason for the change, and suspected some ruse, he told his father, who went up to a high place to reconnoiter. Looking round, Guan Yu noted that there seemed much slackness about everything—from flags to soldiers—in Fankou, that the relief armies were camped in a valley to the north, and that River Xiang seemed to run very swiftly. After impressing the topography on his mind, he called the guides and asked the name of the gully about three miles north of the city. “Zengkou Stream,” was the reply. He chuckled. “I shall capture Yu Jin,” said he. Those with him asked how he knew that. He replied, “Why, how can any fish last long in such a trap?” Those in his train gave but little weight to what he said, and presently he went back to his own tent. It was just then the time for the autumn rains, and a heavy downpour came on, lasting several days. Orders were given to get ready boats and rafts and such things. Guan Ping could not think what such preparations meant in a dry land campaign. So he asked his father. “Do you not know even?” replied his father. “Our enemies have camped in difficult ground instead of the open country and are crowded in the dangerous valley there. After some days of this rain, River Xiang will swell, and I shall send people to dam up all the outlets and so let the water rise very high. When at its highest, I shall open the dams and let the water out over Fankou. That valley will be flooded too, and all the soldiers will become aquatic animals.” The Wei armies had camped in the gully, and after several days of heavy rain, Army Inspector Cheng He ventured to speak to his commander."
却說孔明分付黃忠：“你旣要去，吾敎法正助你。凡事計議而行。吾隨後撥人馬來接應。”黃忠應允，和法正領本部兵去了。孔明告玄德曰：“此老將不着言語激他，雖去不能成功。他今旣去，須撥人馬前去接應。”乃喚趙雲：“將一枝人馬，從小路出奇兵接應黃忠：若忠勝，不必出戰；倘忠有失，卽去救應。”又遣劉封、孟達：“領三千兵於山中險要去處，多立旌旗，以壯我兵之聲勢，令敵人驚疑。”三人各自領兵去了。又差人往下辦，授計與馬超，令他如此而行。又差嚴顏往巴西閬中守隘，替張飛、魏延來同取漢中。,"But he said that Kong Ming paid Huang Zhong: ""If you want to go, I will help you with Fazheng. I will do everything according to the plan. I will then send someone to answer."" Huang Zhong agreed, and Fazheng led the troops. Kong Ming told Xuande, ""This old general does not provoke him without words, although he will not succeed. If he leaves now, he must send troops to meet him."" If loyalty is won, there is no need to fight; if loyalty is lost, go to rescue him."" He also sent Liu Feng and Meng Da: ""Lead 3,000 soldiers in the mountains where they are about to go, and set up more flags to strengthen our troops and make the enemy suspicious."" The men went their separate ways. They sent people down to do it again, and gave Ma Chao a plan to make him do this. They also sent Yan Yan to guard the pass in Langzhong, Brazil, to take Hanzhong for Zhang Fei and Wei Yan.","Apparently grudgingly, Kong Ming has agreed that Huang Zhong should go, but he also sends others to assist him – Zhao Zilong, Liu Feng, Meng Da. ‘ The only way,’ he says to Xuande, ‘that you can fire up these old men is to appear to dismiss them!’ It is also decided that Yan Yan will go to relieve Zhang Fei and Wei Yan so they can march to join the battle for Hanzhong.","“If you are really determined to undertake this expedition, I shall send Fa Zheng with you,” said Zhuge Liang to the veteran leader. “You will have to discuss everything with him. I shall also dispatch supports and reinforcements.” Huang Zhong agreed, and the expedition set out. Then Zhuge Liang explained to Liu Bei, “I purposely tried to spur on the old general that he will really exert himself, else he fears he will not do much. But he will need reinforcement.” After this, Zhuge Liang ordered Zhao Yun to march after the first army and help, if help was needed. So long as the old man was victorious, Zhao Yun was to do nothing; if he was in difficulties, then Zhao Yun was to rescue. Also, three thousand troops under Liu Feng and Meng Da were sent out among the hills to take position at strategic points and set up many banners and make a brave show in order to spread the impression of huge forces, and so frighten and perplex the enemy. In addition, Zhuge Liang sent to Xiabian Pass to tell Ma Chao what part to play in the campaign; Yan Yan was to hold Langzhong and Baxi in place of Zhang Fei and Wei Yan, who also went in expedition in Hanzhong."
大臣奏稱：“當年襄武縣，天降一人，身長二丈餘，脚跡長三尺二寸，白髮蒼髯，着黃單衣，裹黃巾，拄藜頭杖，自稱曰：‘吾乃民王也。今來報汝：天下換王，立見太平。’如此在市遊行三日，忽然不見——此乃殿下之瑞也。殿下可戴二十旒冠冕，建天子旌旗，出警入蹕，乘金根車，備六馬，進王妃為王后，立世子為太子。”昭心中暗喜；回到宮中，正欲飲酒，忽中風不語。次日，病危，太尉王祥、司徒何曾、司馬荀顗及諸大臣入宮問安，昭不能言，以手指太子司馬炎而死：時八月辛卯日也。何曾曰：“天下大事，皆在晉王；可立太子為晉王，然後祭葬。”是日司馬炎卽晉王位，封何曾為晉丞相，司馬望為司徒，石苞為驃騎將軍，陳騫為車騎將軍，諡父為文王。,"The minister said: ""In Xiangwu County, a man descended from heaven, his body was more than 20 feet long, his footprints were 3 feet and 2 inches long, with white hair and beard, wearing a yellow single-clothing, wrapped in a yellow scarf, leaning on a quinoa and a cane, saying: 'I am a people' My lord. I'm here to report to you: The world has changed for kings, and I will see peace.' I walked around the city for three days, but suddenly I didn't see it—this is the auspiciousness of Your Highness. Your Highness can wear a 20-year-old crown, build a flag of the Son of Heaven, and go out to the police. Take the golden root chariot, prepare six horses, enter the concubine as the queen, and make the prince the prince."" Zhao was secretly delighted; when he returned to the palace, he was about to drink when he suddenly suffered a stroke and said nothing. The next day, when he was critically ill, Taiwei Wang Xiang, Situ He Zeng, Sima Xunjie, and other ministers entered the palace to greet him. He Zeng said: ""The world's major affairs are all in the king of Jin; you can make the prince the king of Jin, and then bury him."" It was then that Sima Yan was on the throne of Jin, and He Zeng was the prime minister of Jin, Sima Wang was the Situ, Shi Bao was the general of the hussars, and Chen Qian was He was a general of chariots and cavalry, and his posthumous father was King Wen.","Unable to say no, the Son of Heaven ennobles Sima Zhao as the king of Jin. But others, reporting strange omens and auguries, push for the new king of Jin to become an emperor in his own right. Encouraged, Sima Zhao enters the palace, meaning to implement this. But a sudden violent stroke renders him speechless: so much so that, as he lies dying, all he can do is to point to his heir, Sima Yan, to indicate that he is indeed to succeed to his titles. It is summer AD 264 when he dies. Sima Yan is immediately crowned as king.","Certain officers memorialized: “This year a gigantic figure of a man descended from heaven in Xiangwu. His height was twenty feet and his footprint measured over three feet. He had white hair and a hoary beard. He wore an unlined yellow robe and a yellow cape. He walked leaning on a black-handled staff. This extraordinary man preached, saying, 'I am the king of the people, and now I come to tell you of a change of ruler and the coming of peace.' He wandered about for three days and then disappeared. Evidently this portent refers to yourself, Noble Sir, and now you should assume the imperial headdress with twelve strings of pearls, set up the imperial standard, and have the roads cleared when you make a progress. You should ride in the golden-shafted chariot with six horses. Your consort should be styled 'Empress' and your heir 'Apparent.'“ Sima Zhao was greatly pleased. He returned to his palace, but just as he was sitting down, he was suddenly seized with paralysis and lost the use of his tongue. He quickly grew worse. His three chief confidants, Wang Xiang, He Zeng, and Xun Kai, together with many court officials, came to inquire after his health, but he could not speak to them. He pointed toward the heir apparent, Sima Yan, and died. It was the eighth month of that year. Then said He Zeng, “The care of the empire devolves upon the Prince of Jin; let us induct the heir. Then we can perform the sacrifices to the late prince.” Thereupon Sima Yan was set up in his father's place. He gave He Zeng the title of Prime Minister; Sima Wang, Minister of the Interior; Shi Bao, Commander of the Flying Cavalry; and conferred many other titles and ranks. The posthumous title of the “Scholar Prince” was conferred upon his late father."
建興八年秋七月，魏都督曹眞病可，乃上表說：“蜀兵數次侵界，屢犯中原，若不剿除，後必為患。今時值秋涼，人馬安閒，正當征伐。臣願與司馬懿同領大軍，逕入漢中，殄滅奸黨，以淸邊境。”魏主大喜，問侍中劉曄曰：“子丹勸朕伐蜀，若何？”曄奏曰：“大將軍之言是也：今若不剿除，後必為大患。陛下便可行之。”叡點頭。曄出內回家，有衆大臣相探，問曰：“聞天子與公計議興兵伐蜀，此事如何？”曄應曰：“無此事也：蜀有山川之險，非可易圖。空費軍馬之勞，於國無益。”衆官皆默然而退。楊曁入內奏曰：“昨聞劉曄勸陛下伐蜀；今日與衆臣議，又云不可伐：是欺陛下也。陛下何不召而問之？”叡卽召劉曄入內問曰：“卿勸朕伐蜀；今又言不可。何也？”曄曰：“臣細詳之，蜀不可伐。”叡大笑。少時，楊曁出內。曄奏曰：“臣昨日勸陛下伐蜀，乃國之大事，豈可妄泄於人？夫兵者，詭道也：事未發切宜祕之。”叡大悟曰：“卿言是也。”自此愈加敬重。旬日內，司馬懿入朝，魏主將曹眞表奏之事，逐一言之。懿奏曰：“臣料東吳未敢動兵，今日正可乘此去伐蜀。”叡卽拜曹眞為大司馬征西大都督，司馬懿為大將軍征西副都督，劉曄為軍師。三人拜辭魏主，引四十萬大兵，前行至長安，逕奔劍閣，來取漢中。其餘郭淮、孫禮等，各取路而行。,"In the autumn and seventh month of the eighth year of Jianxing's reign, Cao Zhen, the governor of Wei, was ill, and he said on the table: ""The soldiers of Shu have invaded the borders several times, and they have repeatedly invaded the Central Plains. Together with Sima Yi, we will lead the army and enter Hanzhong, destroy the traitorous party, and cut the border."" The Lord of Wei was overjoyed, and asked Liu Ye, the middle servant, and said: ""Zidan persuaded me to attack Shu, what should I do?"" The words are also: If you don't eliminate it now, it will be a big problem in the future. Your Majesty can do it."" Rui nodded. When Ye went out of the house and went home, several ministers approached him and asked, ""I heard that the Son of Heaven and the public plan to launch an army to attack Shu, how is this matter?"" Ye Ying said, ""There is no such thing as this: Shu has mountains and rivers in danger, and it cannot be easily figured out. The labor of the air, the military and the horses is of no benefit to the country."" All the officials retreated silently. Yang Hao entered the room and said, ""I heard Liu Ye persuaded His Majesty to attack Shu yesterday; today I discussed with all the ministers and said that it is impossible to attack: It is to deceive His Majesty. Why didn't His Majesty ask him?"" Rui You called Liu Ye in and asked. : ""Your Excellency advised me to attack Shu; now I say no. Why not?"" Ye said: ""The minister is detailed, Shu can't be attacked."" Rui laughed. When I was young, Yang Zhao went out. Ye Zuo said: ""I persuaded Your Majesty to attack Shu yesterday. It is a major matter of the country. How can I rashly vent it on others? Soldiers and soldiers are tricky: things should be kept secret before they happen."" Rui Dawu said, ""You are right."" More respected since then. Within ten days, Sima Yi entered the court, and the Lord of Wei sent Cao Zhen's presentation, one by one. Yi said: ""I expect that Dongwu has not dared to move troops, and today is the time to take this opportunity to attack Shu."" Rui You worshipped Cao Zhen as the commander-in-chief of Sima's expedition to the west, Sima Yi was the general and the deputy commander-in-chief, and Liu Ye was the military advisor. . The three of them bid farewell to the Lord of Wei, and led 400,000 soldiers to Chang'an. The rest, Guo Huai, Sun Li, etc., each followed his own path.",Sima Yi and Liu Ye are directed to join Cao Zhen and advance with four hundred thousand troops to seize the mountain pass into Shu and attack Hanzhong.,"In Beginning Prosperity, eighth year and seventh month (AD 230), Cao Zhen, the Commander-in-Chief in Wei, had recovered, and he sent a memorial to his master, saying, “Shu has invaded more than once and threatened Changan. If this state be not destroyed, it will ultimately be our ruin. The autumn coolness is now here. The army is in good form, and it is the time most favorable for an attack on Shu. I desire to take Sima Yi as colleague and march into Hanzhong to exterminate this wretched horde and free the borders from trouble.” Personally, the Ruler of Wei approved, but he consulted Liu Ye, who replied, “The Commander-in-Chief speaks well. If that state be not destroyed, it will be to our hurt. Your Majesty should give effect to his desire.” When Liu Ye came out, a crowd of officers flocked to inquire, saying, “We heard the Emperor has consulted you about an expedition against Shu: what think you?” “No such thing,” said Liu Ye. “Shu is too difficult a country to invade; it would be a mere waste of humans and weapons.” They left him. Then Yang Ji went into the Emperor and said, “It is said that yesterday Liu Ye advised Your Majesty to fall upon Shu; today when we talked with him, he said Shu could not be attacked. This is treating Your Majesty with indignity, and you should issue a command to punish him.” Wherefore Cao Rui called in Liu Ye and asked him to explain. Liu Ye replied, “I have studied the details; Shu cannot be attacked.” Cao Rui laughed. In a short time Yang Ji left, and then Liu Ye said, “Yesterday I advised Your Majesty to attack Shu; that being a matter of state policy should be divulged to no person. The essential of a military move is secrecy.” Then Cao Rui understood, and thereafter Liu Ye was held in greater consideration. Ten days later Sima Yi came to court, and Cao Zhen's memorial was shown him. Sima Yi replied, “The moment is opportune; I do not think there is any danger from Wu.” Cao Zhen was created Minister of War, General Who Conquers the West, and Commander-in-Chief of the Western Expedition; Sima Yi was made Grand Commander, General Who Conquers the West, and was second in command; and Liu Ye was made Instructor of the Army. These three then left the court, and the army of four hundred thousand troops marched to Changan, intending to dash to Saber Pass and attack Hanzhong. The army was joined by Guo Huai and Sun Li."
時有渭南縣令丁斐，在南山之上，見馬超追操甚急，恐傷操命，遂將寨內牛隻馬匹，盡驅於外，漫山遍野，皆是牛馬。西涼兵見之，都回身爭取牛馬，無心追趕，曹操因此得脫。方到北岸，便把船筏鑿沈。諸將聽得曹操在河中逃難，急來救時，操已登岸。許褚身被重鎧，箭皆嵌在甲上。衆將保操至野寨中，皆拜於地而問安。操大笑曰：“我今日幾為小賊所困！”褚曰：“若非有人縱馬放牛以誘賊，賊必努力渡河矣。”操問曰：“誘賊者誰也？”有知者答曰：“渭南縣令丁斐也。”少頃，斐入見。操謝曰：“若非公之良謀，則吾被賊所擒矣。”遂命為典軍校尉。斐曰：“賊雖暫去，明日必復來。須以良策拒之。”操曰：“吾已準備了也。”遂喚諸將各分頭循河築起甬道，暫為寨脚。賊若來時，陳兵於甬道外，內虛立旌旗，以為疑兵；更沿河掘下壕塹，虛立柵蓋河內，以兵誘之；賊急來必陷，賊陷便可擊矣。,"At that time, Ding Fei, the magistrate of Weinan County, was on the top of Nanshan Mountain. Seeing that Ma Chao was in a hurry to chase him, he was afraid that he would be injured and killed, so he drove all the cattle and horses in the village to the outside. When the soldiers of Xiliang saw it, they all turned around to fight for the cattle and horses, but had no intention of chasing after him, so Cao Cao was able to escape. When they reached the north shore, they scuttled the raft. The generals heard that Cao Cao was fleeing in the river, and when he came to rescue, Cao had already landed. Xu Chu was covered in heavy armor with arrows embedded in the armor. All the generals went to the wild village, and they all bowed to the ground to say hello. Cao laughed and said, ""I am trapped by little thieves today!"" Chu said, ""If someone hadn't been driving horses and cattle to lure the thieves, the thieves would have worked hard to cross the river."" Cao asked, ""Who is the one who lured the thieves?"" The knower replied, ""Ding Fei, the county magistrate of Weinan."" After a while, Fei came to see him. Cao Xie said, ""If it wasn't for the public's good plan, I would have been captured by the thieves."" Fei said: ""Although the thieves are gone for a while, they will come back tomorrow. We must take good measures to resist them."" Cao said: ""I have already prepared."" When thieves come, Chen soldiers will set up flags and flags outside the Yongdao, thinking they are suspicious soldiers; they will also dig trenches along the river, and erect fences to cover the inside of the river, so as to lure them with soldiers;","All seems to be up for Xu Chu and Cao Cao, but a local official, Ding Fei, spots what is happening and orders the grazing cattle to be driven down onto the flood plains. This diverts the attention of the tribal warriors, who rush off after them to seize them as bounty. This enables Xu Chu and Cao Cao to be swept on down the river out of harm’s way.","Then the Magistrate of Weinan, Ding Fei, who from a hill top saw that Cao Cao was very closely pressed, even in danger of his life, drove out from his camp all the cattle and horses there, so that they scattered over the hillside. This was too much for the born Qiang herdsmen of the plains. At sight of the beasts, they left the river and ran off to secure the cattle. Nor had they any inclination to pursue their enemy. And so Cao Cao escaped. As soon as they reached the northern shore, the boat was scuttled. The rumor had spread that Cao Cao was on the river and in danger, so all his officers came to his aid. But he was now safe on shore. Xu Chu's double armor was stuck full of arrows. The officers escorted Cao Cao to the camp where they made their obeisance and expressed the hope that he had not suffered seriously. “The rebels very nearly caught me today,” said he smiling. “They would have got across the river had they not been enticed away by the freeing of the cattle and horses.” said Xu Chu. “Who was it that drew them off?” said Cao Cao. Some one who knew told him. Before long Magistrate Ding Fei came in to pay his respects, and Cao Cao thanked him. “I should have been a prisoner but for your happy thought,” said he. And the Magistrate received a rank of Commander in the army. “Though they have gone, yet they will assuredly return tomorrow,” said Ding Fei. “You must prepare to repel them.” “My preparations are all made,” was the reply. Cao Cao ordered his generals to spread themselves along the river bank and throw up mounds as shelters for camps. If they saw the enemy approaching, the soldiers were to be withdrawn from behind the mounds, leaving the ensigns all flying, so as to give the impression that each camp contained a garrison. Along the river they were to dig ditches and put up sheds, thus to entice the enemy there and their army would stumble into the pits and fall easy victims."
却說張翼正到祁山攻打，守寨將師纂兵少，支持不住。看看待破，忽然鄧艾兵至，衝殺了一陣，蜀兵大敗，把張翼隔在山後，絕了歸路。正慌急之間，忽聽的喊聲大震，鼓角喧天，只見魏兵紛紛倒退。左右報曰：“大將軍姜伯約殺到。”翼乘勢驅兵相應。兩下夾攻，鄧艾折了一陣，急退上祁山寨不出。姜維令兵四面攻圍。,"But he said that Zhang Yi was going to Qishan to attack, and the defending generals had few troops and could not support him. Looking at the waiting time, Deng Ai suddenly arrived and rushed to kill for a while. The Shu soldiers were defeated, and Zhang Yi was separated from the mountain, and there was no way to return. In the midst of a panic, I heard a loud shout, and the drums were loud, and I saw the Wei soldiers retreating one after another. The left and right reported: ""General Jiang Boyue is here."" Yi took advantage of the situation and drove his troops accordingly. Two pinch attacks, Deng Ai folded for a while, and hurriedly retreated to Qi Shanzhai. Jiang Wei ordered his troops to besiege from all sides.","Encouraged by this, Deng Ai launches a night raid on Jiang Wei’s camp, which throws the Shu army into chaos.","Zhang Yi was then actually attacking the Wei position on Qishan. Shi Zuan had few troops, and it looked as though the defenders must soon give in, when the sudden appearance of Deng Ai made all the difference. The onslaught of Deng Ai's force drove off Zhang Yi, and he was forced to take refuge behind the hills. No road was open to him. When things looked worst, he saw the Wei soldiers suddenly falling back in confusion. “General Jiang Wei has come!” they told him. Zhang Yi took the opportunity to return to the attack, and the tables were turned. Deng Ai lost the fight and retired into his camp, which Jiang Wei surrounded and attacked vigorously."

却說馬超回見韓遂，說：“幾乎捉住曹操！有一將奮勇負操下船去了，不知何人。”遂曰：“吾聞曹操選極精壯之人，為帳前侍衞，名曰‘虎衞軍’，以驍將典韋、許褚領之。典韋已死，今救曹操者，必許褚也。此人勇力過人，人皆稱為‘虎癡’；如遇之，不可輕敵。”超曰：“吾亦聞其名久矣。”遂曰：“今操渡河，將襲我後，可速攻之，不可令他創業營寨。若立營寨，急難剿除。”超曰：“以姪愚意，還只拒住北岸，使彼不得渡河，乃為上策。”遂曰：“賢姪守寨，吾引軍循河戰操，若何？”超曰：“令龐德為先鋒，跟叔父前去。”於是韓遂與龐德將兵五萬，直奔渭南。操令衆將於甬道兩旁誘之。龐德先引鐵騎千餘，衝突而來。喊聲起處，人馬俱落於陷馬坑內。龐德踴身一跳，躍出土坑，立於平地，立殺數人，步行砍出重圍。韓遂已被困在垓心。龐德步行救之，正遇着曹仁部將曹永；被龐德一刀砍於馬下，奪其馬，殺開一條血路，救出韓遂，投東南而走。背後曹兵趕來，馬超引軍接應，殺敗曹兵。復救出大半軍馬。戰至日暮方回。計點人馬，折了將佐程銀、張橫，陷坑中死者二百餘人。超與韓遂商議：“若遷延日久，操於河北立了營寨，難以退敵；不若乘今夜引輕騎劫野營。”遂曰：“須分兵前後相救。”於是超自為前部，令龐德、馬岱為後應，當夜便行。,"But he said that Ma Chao went back to see Han Sui and said, ""I almost caught Cao Cao! There was a general who bravely took Cao off the boat, and I don't know who."" The 'Tiger Guard Army' is led by valiant generals Dian Wei and Xu Chu. Dian Wei is dead, and now the one who saves Cao Cao must be Xu Chu. This man is so brave and powerful that everyone is called a 'tiger idiot'; Chao said, ""I've heard its name for a long time."" Then he said, ""I'm going to cross the river today. After I'm about to attack, I can attack it quickly, but I can't make him start a camp. If you set up a camp, it will be difficult to destroy it urgently."" Chao said: """" Because of my stupidity, I only refused to stay on the north bank, so that she could not cross the river, which is the best policy."" Then he said: ""Xian Mi defends the village, and I lead the army to fight along the river, what should I do?"" Chao said: ""Let Pang De be the vanguard. Go with your uncle."" So Han Sui and Pang De, with fifty thousand soldiers, went straight to Weinan. The commanders will lure them on both sides of the corridor. Pang De led more than a thousand cavalry, and the conflict came. At the beginning of the shouting, the people and horses all fell into the trapped horse pit. Pang De jumped, jumped out of the pit, stood on the ground, killed several people, and cut through the encirclement on foot. Han Sui has been trapped in Gaixin. Pang De rescued him on foot, and was encountering Cao Ren's general Cao Yong; Cao Bing came from behind, and Ma Chao led the army to respond and defeated Cao Bing. Rescued most of the military horses. Fight until sunset. Counting people and horses, the generals Zuo Chengyin and Zhang Heng were broken, and more than 200 people died in the pit. Chao and Han Sui discussed: ""If it is delayed for a long time, Cao has set up a camp in Hebei, and it will be difficult to retreat from the enemy; it is better to use light cavalry to rob the camp tonight."" Then they said: ""We must divide our troops before and after to save each other."" So Chao took the lead. , so that Pang De and Ma Dai should be the second responders, and they will do it that night.","This enables Xu Chu and Cao Cao to be swept on down the river out of harm’s way. Recovering from his failure of nerve, Cao Cao now takes stock and orders his troops to prepare defences on this northern shore, including digging pits and covering them with branches so that any cavalry charge can be brought crashing down. Now they are ready to carry out their plan to attack Ma Chao from the north. In return, Ma Chao realizes that he should try and attack first and he orders Pang De and Han Sui to advance with fifty thousand men. The trick of covering the pits works well. Pang De’s cavalry charge crashes down into the pits, and few escape. But Pang De by a mighty effort is able to ride back out. Dragging Han Sui also to safety, he flees, pursued by Cao Cao’s men. But then Ma Chao rides to the rescue and in the nick of time saves his army from defeat. Consulting with his generals, Ma Chao agrees that they should attack again that very night before the enemy can really dig in.","Ma Chao returned to Han Sui and told him, saying, “I would have captured Cao Cao, but a certain bold general had taken him on his back and leaped with him into a boat.” Han Sui replied, “I have heard that Cao Cao had a body guard of the bravest and strongest soldiers under the command of Dian Wei and Xu Chu. They are called the Tiger Guards. Now as Dian Wei is dead, the man you saw must have been Xu Chu. He is both brave and powerful and goes by the name of Tiger-Lust. You will do well to avoid him.” “I know his name, too,” said Ma Chao. “Cao Cao now means to attack our rear;” continued Han Sui, “let us attack first, before he can establish camps and stockades. If once he can do that, it will be difficult to dislodge him.” “My idea is that we should hold the north bank and prevent him from crossing.” “Worthy nephew, keep guard here while I go along the bank of the river and fight Cao Cao.” “If you will take Pang De as your van leader, I am content,” said Ma Chao. So Han Sui and Pang De, with fifty thousand troops, went away down to the River Wei, while Cao Cao again warned his generals to entice the enemy. Pang De was in advance with a goodly squadron of iron-clad horsemen, and they burst along at full speed. Then there arose a confused shouting as they all went plunging into the ditches prepared for them. Pang De soon leaped out, gained the level ground, and laid about him with all his might. He slew many Cao Cao's soldiers and presently got out of the thick of the fight. But Han Sui had also been involved, and Pang De went afoot to try to aid him. On the way he met Cao Yong, a general of Cao Ren. Pang De cut Cao Yong down. Then mounting the dead man's steed, he rode forward fiercely, slaying as he passed. He reached his leader whom he led away southeast. The troops of Cao Cao pursued him, but Ma Chao came with reinforcements and drove them off. He rescued a great number, and they continued fighting till evening when they withdrew and mustered their troops. Two commanders, Cheng Yin and Zhang Heng, were missing, and a couple of hundred soldiers had been killed when they fell into the pits. Ma Chao and Han Sui discussed what should next be done. “If we give the enemy time, he will make himself strong on the north bank. I think we can do no better than to raid his camp tonight,” said Ma Chao. “We must have a force and supports for it,” said Han Sui. So it was decided that Ma Chao should lead the striking force with Pang De and Ma Dai as supports. They would start at nightfall."
却說曹操收兵屯渭北，喚諸將曰：“賊欺我未立寨柵，必來劫野營。可四散伏兵，虛其中軍。號礮響時，伏兵盡起，一鼓可擒也。”衆將依令，伏兵已畢。當夜馬超却先使成宜引三十騎往前哨探。成宜見無人馬，逕入中軍。操軍見西涼兵到，遂放號礮。四面伏兵皆出，只圍得三十騎。成宜被夏侯淵所殺。馬超却自背後與龐德、馬岱分兵三路蜂擁殺來。正是：,"But he said that Cao Cao had withdrawn his troops to settle in Weibei, and called his generals: ""The thieves lied to me and did not set up a stronghold, so they will surely come to rob the camp. You can disperse the troops in ambush, and empty the army. When the horn sounds, the ambush troops are all up, and they can be captured in one drum. ""As the generals ordered, the ambush is over. That night Ma Chao first ordered Cheng Yi to lead thirty cavalry to the outpost. Cheng Yi saw that there was no horse, and entered the Chinese army. When Cao Jun saw the arrival of soldiers from Xiliang, they released their horns. There were ambush troops on all sides, and only thirty cavalry could be surrounded. Cheng Yi was killed by Xiahou Yuan. However, Ma Chao and Pang De and Ma Dai split up and swarmed from behind. Exactly:","Back at Cao Cao’s camp, he tells his men to expect exactly such an attack and to lay an ambush. It is not Ma Chao who comes at dead of night but Cheng Yi with just thirty men. As they ride into the camp, it appears to be deserted. Thinking that this is a major attack, Cao Cao’s men spring the ambush but find they have trapped only thirty men. Cheng Yi is slain, but then, as if from nowhere, Ma Chao and the mass of his men charge in and launch a terrifying assault. Who is going to win?","Now Cao Cao's troops were on the north bank of the River Wei, and he gave his generals orders, saying, “The rebels will try to surprise us as they are deceived by my not having set up stockades. You will place your soldiers in ambush. At the bomb signal, you will rush out from four directions to capture them.” At nightfall Ma Chao sent out a small scouting party headed by Cheng Yi. Seeing nothing, Cheng Yi penetrated deep into the enemy's lines. Presently, a bomb was exploded. Out leapt the hidden troops, and in a few moments the whole scouting party were killed. Cheng Yi was cut down by the blade of Xiahou Yuan. But close at hand came the main army led by Ma Chao, Ma Dai, and Pang De that rushed into the ambush forces. Wait for the foe all undismayed."

數日之後，孔明與雲長等正坐間，人報關平到。衆官皆驚。關平入，呈上玄德書信。孔明視之，內言：“本年七月初七日，龐軍師被張任在落鳳坡前箭射身故。”孔明大哭，衆官無不垂淚。孔明曰：“旣主公在涪關進退兩難之際，亮不得不去。”雲長曰：“軍師去，誰人保守荊州？荊州乃重地，干係非輕。”孔明曰：“主公書中雖不明寫其人，吾已知其意了。”乃將玄德書與衆官看曰：“主公書中，把荊州託在吾身上，敎我自量才委用。雖然如此，今交關平齎書前來，其意欲雲長公當此重任。雲長想桃園結義之情，可竭力保守此地。責任非輕，公宜勉之。”雲長更不推辭，慨然領諾。孔明設宴，交割印綬。雲長雙手來接。孔明擎着印曰：“這干係都在將軍身上。”雲長曰：“大丈夫旣領重任，除死方休。”孔明見雲長說個“死”字，心中不悅；欲待不與，其言已出。孔明曰：“倘曹操引兵來到，當如之何？”雲長曰：“以力拒之。”孔明又曰：“倘曹操、孫權，齊起兵來，如之奈何？”雲長曰：“分兵拒之。”孔明曰：“若如此，荊州危矣。吾有八個字，將軍牢記，可保守荊州。”雲長問：“那八個字？”孔明曰：“北拒曹操，東和孫權。”雲長曰：“軍師之言，當銘肺腑。”,"A few days later, Kong Ming and Yun Chang were sitting in the room, and people declared the customs and arrived. All the officials were shocked. Guan Ping entered and presented Xuande's letter. Kong Ming looked at him and said inside: ""On the seventh day of the seventh lunar month this year, Pang Junshi was shot by Zhang Ren in front of Luofeng Slope and died."" Kong Ming burst into tears, and all the officials wept. Kong Ming said: ""When the lord is in the dilemma of advancing and retreating in Fuguan, Liang has to go."" Yun Chang said: ""When the military advisor goes, who will protect Jingzhou? Jingzhou is an important place, and the relationship is not light."" I know the meaning of the person who wrote it."" He read the book of Xuande with the officials and said: ""In the book of the lord, I entrusted Jingzhou to me, and only entrusted me with my own capacity. Even so, I will pass Guanping now. When Ji Shu came, he wanted Yun Changgong to take on this important task. Yun Chang thought of Taoyuan's friendship, he could try his best to protect this place. The responsibility is not light, and the public should be encouraged."" Yun Chang did not refuse, but accepted the promise. Kong Ming held a banquet and handed over the seal. Yun Chang took it with both hands. Kong Ming held the seal and said, ""It's all up to the general."" Yun Chang said, ""The man is in charge of the important task, and the only way to get rid of death is to rest."" When Kong Ming saw Yun Chang said the word ""death"", he was displeased in his heart; , his words have come out. Kong Ming said, ""If Cao Cao leads troops to come, what should we do?"" Yun Chang said, ""Reject them with force."" Kong Ming said again, ""If Cao Cao and Sun Quan raise their troops together, what will happen?"" Yun Chang said. Kong Ming said, ""If this is the case, Jingzhou will be in danger. I have eight characters that the general will keep in mind, so that Jingzhou can be protected."" Yunchang asked, ""What are the eight characters?"" Kong Ming said, ""The north rejects Cao Cao. , Donghe Sun Quan."" Yun Chang said: ""The words of the military advisor should be etched in the heart.""","Kong Ming too weeps at this loss. Having read the letter sent by Xuande asking him to come, he appoints Guan Yu to protect Jingzhou. Before leaving, he quizzes Guan Yu on what he would do if Cao Cao attacks and then what if Cao Cao and Sun Quan attack. As he departs, he gives Guan Yu eight words of advice: ‘North – resist Cao Cao; east – reconcile Sun Quan.’ Kong Ming then divides his force into three columns. The first, led by Zhang Fei, is to go through the high country, while Zhao Zilong’s will follow the river valley. Kong Ming will then follow them later. As they set off, Kong Ming warns Zhang Fei to ensure his troops behave in order to win the trust of the people.","A few days later, while Zhuge Liang was sitting with Guan Yu and a few others, they reported the arrival of Guan Ping with letters from the west. When the letters were opened, they knew that Pang Tong had fallen the same evening that the meteor had appeared. Zhuge Liang wailed and the others wept with him. Then Zhuge Liang said, “I must go to help our lord; he is hemmed in at the Pass and cannot move.” “If you go away, who will guard this region?” asked Guan Yu. “It is of very great importance.” “Our lord has not written plainly, but I know what was in his mind.” Then he showed the letter to the others and said, “Provision for the defense of this region is laid upon me, and I am to find one equal to the task. I read the letter to mean that he desires Guan Yu to undertake the defense, and I know that Guan Yu will do it for the sake of the pledge taken long ago in the Peach Garden. The task is no light one.” Guan Yu accepted without hesitation or thought of excuse. A special banquet was prepared at which the seal was to be handed over to him. “All the future rests with you, General,” said Zhuge Liang as he raised the symbol of office to place it in the hands of the commander. “When a person of honor accepts such a task, he is only released by death,” replied Guan Yu. But that ill-omened word “death” displeased Zhuge Liang, and even then he would have retracted but that Guan Yu's word had gone forth. Zhuge Liang went on. “Now if Cao Cao attack what is to be done?” said Zhuge Liang. “Repel him with all my strength.” “But if Cao Cao and Sun Quan attack you together, what then?” “Fight both; half my force against each.” Zhuge Liang said, “In that case, Jingzhou would be in danger. I will give you my advice in a few words, and if you remember them the region is safe.” “What are these few words?” asked Guan Yu. “North, fight Cao Cao; south, ally with Sun Quan.” “These words, O Commander, are engraved on my heart.” Thereupon the seal was placed in his hands."
次日，潘璋又來搦戰。黃忠奮然上馬。興、苞二人要助戰，忠不從；吳班要助戰，忠亦不從；只自引五千軍出迎。戰不數合，璋拖刀便走。忠縱馬追之，厲聲大叫曰：“賊將休走！吾今為關公報讎！”追至三十餘里，四面喊聲大震，伏兵齊出：右邊周泰，左邊韓當，前有潘璋，後有凌統，把黃忠困在垓心。忽然狂風大起，忠急退時，山坡上馬忠引一軍出，一箭射中黃忠肩窩，險些兒落馬。吳兵見忠中箭，一齊來攻。忽後面喊聲大起，兩路軍殺來，吳兵潰散，救出黃忠——乃關興、張苞也。二小將保送黃忠逕到御前營中。忠年老血衰，箭瘡痛裂，病甚沈重。先主御駕自來看視，撫其背曰：“令老將軍中傷，朕之過也！”忠曰：“臣乃一武夫耳，幸遇陛下。臣今年七十有五，壽亦足矣。望陛下善保龍體，以圖中原！”言訖，不省人事。是夜殞於御營。後人有詩歎曰：,"The next day, Pan Zhang came to fight again. Huang Zhong excitedly mounted. Xing and Bao wanted to help in the battle, but Loyal refused to follow; Wu Ban wanted to help, but Loyal refused to follow; After the battle was over, Zhang dragged his sword and left. Zhong Zong chased him, and shouted sharply: ""The thieves will stop! I am the Guan Gongbao now!"" After chasing after more than 30 miles, there were loud shouts from all sides, and the ambush soldiers came out: Zhou Tai on the right, Han Dang on the left, the front There was Pan Zhang and then Ling Tong, who trapped Huang Zhong in Gaixin. Suddenly a strong wind picked up, and when Zhong was in a hurry to retreat, Ma Zhong led an army out on the hillside, and an arrow hit Huang Zhong's shoulder, almost falling off his horse. Wu soldiers saw Zhong Zhong's arrow and attacked together. Suddenly, there was a loud cry from the back, and the two-route army attacked. Wu soldiers scattered and rescued Huang Zhong - Guan Xing and Zhang Bao. The second general escorted Huang Zhongjing to the imperial camp. In the old age, the blood was weak, the arrow sores were painful and cracked, and the disease was very serious. The First Sovereign came to look at himself, stroked his back, and said, ""It's my fault to make the old general slander!"" Zhong said, ""I am a warrior, and I am fortunate to meet Your Majesty. I hope Your Majesty will take good care of the dragon body, as shown in the picture!"" After he finished speaking, he fell unconscious. He died in the imperial camp at night. A later poem sighed and said:","The next day Pan Zhang rides out to challenge the old man again and again he rides into combat, only this time Pan Zhang turns and flees. But it is a trap. He leads the pursuing Huang Zhong into an ambush, where Ma Zhong shoots him in the armpit. Felled by this blow, he is almost captured by the Wu army. But at the very last moment, charging in as if from nowhere, he is rescued by Guan Xing and Zhang Bao. But the wound in one as old as he is effectively a death sentence. The first ruler comes to comfort him. ‘I’m just an old warrior,’ Huang Zhong says. ‘I’ve been fortunate enough to serve Your Majesty, and now at seventy-five my time has come. Please, Your Majesty, reserve your strength to fight the north.’ And with these prophetic words, he dies. As a poet has said about this brave man:","Next day Pan Zhang came to challenge again, and Huang Zhong at once accepted. Nor would he allow Guan Xing and Zhang Bao to come with him, or accept assistance from any other. He led out five thousand troops. Before many bouts had been exchanged, Pan Zhang made a feint and got away. Huang Zhong pursued, shouting to him not to flee. “Flee not, for now will I avenge the death of Guan Yu!” cried he. Huang Zhong pursued some ten miles, but presently he fell into an ambush and found himself attacked from all sides— Zhou Tai on the left , Han Dang on the right, Ling Tong from behind, and the erstwhile flying Pan Zhang turned to attack the front—, so that Huang Zhong was surrounded and hemmed in. Huang Zhong forced his way to retreat. But suddenly a great storm came on, the wind blowing violently, and as Huang Zhong was passing some hills, an enemy cohort led by Ma Zhong came down the slopes, and one of the arrows wounded the veteran in the armpit. He nearly fell from his horse with the shock. The soldiers of Wu, seeing Huang Zhong wounded, came on all together, but soon the two youthful generals, Guan Xing and Zhang Bao, drove them off and scattered them. Thus they rescued Huang Zhong. He was taken back to the main camp. But he was old and his blood was thin, and the wound gaped wide, so that he was near to die. The First Ruler came to visit him and patted his back and said, “It is my fault, O Veteran General, that you have been hurt in the battle!” “I am a soldier,” said the old man. “I am glad that I could serve Your Majesty. But now I am seventy-five, and I have lived long enough. Be careful of your own safety for the good of the state.” These were his last words. He became unconscious and died that night. A poem was written of him:"

却說呂蒙在荊州，傳下號令：凡荊州諸郡，有隨關公出征將士之家，不許吳兵攪擾，按月給與糧米；有患病者，遣醫治療。將士之家，感其恩惠，安堵不動。忽報關公使至，呂蒙出郭迎接入城，以賓禮相待。使者呈書與蒙。蒙看畢，謂來使曰：“蒙昔日與關將軍結好，乃一己之私見；今日之事，乃上命差遣，不得自主。煩使者回報將軍，善言致意。”遂設宴款待，送歸館驛安歇。於是隨征將士之家，皆來問信。有附家書者，有口傳音信者，皆言家門無恙，衣食不缺。,"But he said that Lü Meng was in Jingzhou, and he passed down an order: In all the counties of Jingzhou, if there are officers and soldiers who accompanied Guan Gong on expeditions, Wu soldiers are not allowed to disturb them, and grain and rice are given on a monthly basis; those who are sick, send doctors to treat them. The family of soldiers and soldiers, grateful for its kindness, can't move. Suddenly reporting the arrival of the Minister of Customs, Lü Meng went out of Guo to welcome him into the city, and treated him with courtesy. The messenger presented the letter and Mongolia. After Meng looked at it, he said to the envoy: ""Meng used to form a good relationship with General Guan. It was his own private opinion; today's matter was sent by an order, and he couldn't do it himself. I bother the envoy to return the general and speak kindly."" Return to the hotel and rest in peace. So all the families of the soldiers who followed the expedition came to ask for letters. Those with letters from the family and those with word of mouth all said that their families were safe and that there was no shortage of food and clothing.","Back in Jingzhou, Lü Meng has given orders that the families of all the commanders under Guan Yu and of course Guan Yu’s own family are to be treated with respect and taken good care of. When the letter arrives from Guan Yu, the families gather round the messenger, asking for information about their loved ones and handing over letters or sending messages back to the commanders saying all is well with them.","Meanwhile, by Lu Meng's special command, the most complete protection was given to the families of all the officers who were serving under Guan Yu, and they were kept supplied with all they required. Even the ailing members of their households were treated by physicians free of charge. The result was that they were quite won over to the new order of things, and there was no attempt to disturb it. When Guan Yu's letter came, the messenger was led into the city and well treated. When Lu Meng read the letter, he said to the bearer thereof, “You must understand the different circumstances. When your general and I were leagued together, it was a personal matter between us two. Now things have changed. I am sent here with certain orders and am not my own master. I would trouble you, O Messenger, to return and explain thus to your master and in good words.” The bearer of the letter was entertained at a banquet and sent to repose himself in the guest-house, where the families of the absent officers sought him to have news of their husbands and fathers. Moreover, they brought him letters and gave him messages for the officers, and the whole tenor of these letters and messages was that they were all in good health, all their needs were supplied, and they lacked nothing."
却說淳于丹於黃昏時分，領兵前進。到蜀寨時，已三更之後。丹令衆軍鼓譟而入。蜀營內傅彤引兵殺出，挺鎗直取淳于丹；丹敵不住，撥馬便回。忽然喊聲大震，一彪軍攔住去路：為首大將趙融。丹奪路而走，折其大半。正走之間，山後一彪蠻兵攔住：為首番將沙摩柯。丹死戰得脫，背後三路軍趕來。比及離營五里，吳軍徐盛、丁奉二人兩下殺來，蜀兵退去，救了淳于丹回營。丹帶箭入見陸遜請罪。遜曰：“非汝之過也：吾欲試敵人之虛實耳。破蜀之計，吾已定矣。”徐盛、丁奉曰：“蜀兵勢大，難以破之，空自損兵折將耳。”遜笑曰：“吾這條計，但瞞不過諸葛亮耳。天幸此人不在，使我成大功也。”,"But Chunyudan said that at dusk, he led the army forward. When we arrived at Shu Village, it was after the third watch. Dan ordered the army to enter. In the camp of Shu, Fu Tong led his troops to attack, and took Chunyu Dan with his spear; Suddenly there was a loud shout, and a Biao army blocked the way: Zhao Rong, the leader. Dan took the road and walked away, breaking most of it. While walking, a savage soldier behind the mountain stopped him: Shamoke was the first general. Dan survived the fight to the death, and the Three Route Army came behind him. Five li away from the camp, the Wu army Xu Sheng and Ding Feng attacked, and the Shu soldiers retreated, saving Chunyudan back to the camp. Dan brought an arrow to see Lu Xun to plead guilty. Xun said: ""It's not your fault: I want to test the enemy's true and false ears. I have already made up the plan to break Shu."" Xu Sheng and Ding Feng said: ""The forces of Shu are so powerful that it is difficult to break them, and they will lose their generals if they are empty. Xun smiled and said, ""My plan, but I can't hide it from Zhuge Lianger. God is lucky that this person is not there, so I can achieve great success.""","This casts down the hopes of the commanders, but Lu Xun says, ‘I needed to test the enemy. My plan can now roll out. It would never have fooled Kong Ming, but by the grace of Heaven, he is not here!’ He now issues his orders for battle. He orders Zhu Ran to advance by ship upstream.","When Chunyu Dan had gone, Lu Xun summoned Xu Sheng and Ding Feng and said, “Each of you will take three thousand troops and bivouac two miles from the camp, so that if your colleague is repulsed and pursued, you can rescue him.” Chunyu Dan marched between the lights and reached the camp he was to capture just after the third watch. His drums rolled, and he attacked at once. The defenders came out led by Fu Tong, who, spear ready to thrust, rode straight toward the leader of the attack and forced him back. Suddenly there arose the roll of other drums, and a cohort under Zhao Rong barred the way. Chunyu Dan turned off along another road, escaping with loss of many troops. But he was not yet safe. Some distance farther he ran against the Mang tribesmen leader Shamo Ke. However, Chunyu Dan avoided him also and went on his way, pursued now by three parties. Soon he reached the spot two miles from the camp, and here the two leaders of Shu—Xu Sheng and Ding Feng—, who had been placed ready to afford succor, came out and stopped the pursuit. When the enemy had retired, Chunyu Dan was escorted back to camp. He was wounded, and with the arrow still undrawn he appeared before Lu Xun and apologized for his failure. “It was no fault of yours;” said the Commander-in-Chief, “I wanted to test the force of our enemy. My plan of attack is quite ready.” “The enemy is very strong and will not be easily overcome,” said Xu Sheng and Ding Feng. “We have now suffered great loss to no purpose.” “This plan of mine would not hoodwink Zhuge Liang, but happily he is not here. His absence will allow me to score a great success.”"

不一日，軍至南鄭。曹洪接着，備言張郃之事。操曰：“非郃之罪：勝負乃兵家常事耳。”洪曰：“目今劉備使黃忠攻打定軍山，夏侯淵知大王兵至，固守未曾出戰。”操曰：“若不出戰，是示懦也。”便差人持節到定軍山，敎夏侯淵進兵。劉瞱諫曰：“淵性太剛，恐中奸計。”操乃作手書與之。使命持節到淵營，淵接入。使者出書，淵拆視之。略曰：,"Not a day later, the army reached Nanzheng. Cao Hong then prepared a statement about Zhang He. Cao said: ""It is not He's crime: victory or defeat is a matter of common military affairs."" Hong said, ""Now Liu Bei has sent Huang Zhong to attack Dingjun Mountain, and Xiahou Yuan knew that the king's army was coming, so he insisted that he did not go to battle."" Cao said, ""If you don't fight, It's a sign of cowardice."" Then he sent people to Dingjun Mountain to hold a festival, and ordered Xiahou Yuan to advance. Liu Jing said: ""Yuan's nature is too rigid, and I'm afraid of cheating."" Cao Nai wrote a handwritten letter to him. The mission holds the festival to Yuanying, Yuan access. The messenger published a book, and Yuan dismantled it. Briefly say:","Cao Cao and his army arrive at Nanzheng and set up camp. Meanwhile Dingjun mountain is now besieged by Huang Zhong. Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He wonder how to show Cao Cao that they are competent and worthy of his trust. It is decided that they will mount an attack led by Xiahou Yuan, who brags that he will capture Huang Zhong alive.","In less than a day they reached Nanzheng, where Cao Hong welcomed them. He told the tale of Zhang He's misfortunes. “To suffer defeat is no crime;” said Cao Cao, “that and victory are things that happen constantly in war.” “Liu Bei has sent Huang Zhong to take Dingjun Mountain,” said Cao Hong. “Xiahou Yuan, hearing you were coming, O Prince, has been defending the position and not going out to give battle.” “But standing always on the defensive is showing weakness,” said Cao Cao. Thereupon he bade a man carry an authority flag to the Mountain Commander and so order him to attack the enemy. “Xiahou Yuan is very stern and inflexible, and he may be carried too far and fall victim to some vile ruse,” said Liu Ye. Wherefore the Prince wrote a letter to him to accompany the authority flag. And when the messenger arrived and the letter was opened, it read: “Every leader must exercise a combination of inflexibility and yielding."
原來魏延受了孔明密計：先敎存下三十騎，伏於王雙營邊；只待王雙起兵趕時，却去他營中放火；待他回寨，出其不意，突出斬之。魏延斬了王雙，引兵回到漢中見孔明，交割了人馬。孔明設宴大會——不在話下。,"It turned out that Wei Yan had received a secret plan from Kongming: first, he had to save thirty cavalry and lie down at the side of Wangshuang's camp; only when Wangshuang raised his troops in time, he went to his camp to set fire; Wei Yan beheaded Wang Shuang, led his troops back to Hanzhong to meet Kongming, and handed over the troops. Kong Ming's banquet meeting - not to mention.","Wei Yan, operating on secret orders from Kong Ming, also traps Wang Shuang and slays him, and then Kong Ming, being a realist, orders a retreat by the Shu army, because indeed they are running out of supplies.","The secret orders sent to Wei Yan was that he was to keep back thirty men and hide beside Wang Shuang's camp till that warrior left. Then the camp was to be set on fire. After that the thirty were to wait till Wang Shuang's return to fall upon him.

司馬師臥病不起，喚諸葛誕入帳，賜以印綬，加為征東大將軍，都督揚州諸路軍馬；一面班師回許昌。師目痛不止，每夜只見李豐、張緝、夏侯玄三人立於榻前。師心神恍惚，自料難保，遂令人往洛陽取司馬昭到。昭哭拜於牀下。師遺言曰：“吾今權重，雖欲卸肩，不可得也。汝繼我為之，大事切不可輕託他人，自取滅族之禍。”言訖，以印綬付之，淚流滿面。昭急欲問時，師大叫一聲，眼睛迸出而死：時正元二年二月也。於是司馬昭發喪，申奏魏主曹髦。髦遣使持詔到許昌，卽命暫留司馬昭屯軍許昌，以防東吳。昭心中猶豫未決。鍾會曰：“大將軍新亡，人心未定，將軍若留守於此，萬一朝廷有奱，悔之何及？”昭從之，卽起兵還屯洛水之南。髦聞之大驚。太尉王肅奏曰：“昭旣繼其兄掌大權，陛下可封爵以安之。”髦遂令王肅持詔，封司馬昭為大將軍、錄尚書事。昭入朝謝恩畢：自此，中外大小事情，皆歸於昭。,"Sima Shi fell ill and couldn't afford it, so he called Zhuge Dan into the tent, gave him a seal, and made him the general of the Eastern Conquest. The pain in the teacher's eyes continued, and every night, Li Feng, Zhang Ji, and Xiahouxuan were seen standing in front of the couch. The teacher was in a trance, and he couldn't help himself, so he sent people to Luoyang to fetch Sima Zhao. Zhao cried and worshipped under the bed. The master said in his last words: ""I have power now, although I want to take it off my shoulders, I can't get it. You follow me, and you must not entrust others lightly in important matters, and bring the disaster of annihilation of your own family."" At the end of the sentence, he paid it with a seal, tears streaming down your face. When Zhao was anxious to ask, the teacher shouted, his eyes burst out and he died: It was the second month of the second year of Zhengyuan. So Sima Zhao sent a mourning and sent a memorial to Cao Mao, the ruler of Wei. Mao sent an envoy to Xuchang with an edict, and ordered Sima Zhao to temporarily stay in Xuchang to prevent Eastern Wu. Zhao hesitated in his heart. Zhong Hui said: ""The general has died recently, and people's hearts are not settled. If the general stays here, in case the court has trouble, how can you regret it?"" Shocked by the news. Taiwei Wang Su said: ""Zhao Yan succeeds his brother in power, and your majesty can make him a nobility."" Mao then ordered Wang Su to hold the edict, and named Sima Zhao as the general and the recorder. Zhao entered the court and thanked Enbi: Since then, all matters, both Chinese and foreign, have belonged to Zhao.","News is sent to Emperor Cao Mao (Cao Fang had died the previous year), who orders Sima Zhao to stay where he is to prevent any attack by Wu in such an unsettled time. When, however, he hears that Sima Zhao has moved his army back, he is greatly troubled. But he receives reassurances from his adviser Wang Su that he has nothing to fear. Soon after, Sima Zhao moves his army into the capital itself. Now seriously alarmed and in an attempt to win his favour, Cao Mao heaps titles and gifts upon Sima Zhao.","Sima Shi grew worse. Recovery being hopeless, he called Zhuge Dan to his tent and gave him a seal and conferred upon him the title of General Who Conquers the East, with command of all the forces in Yangzhou, and soon after the army marched back to Xuchang. The sick man began to have visions. Night after night he was troubled by the apparitions of the three courtiers—Zhang Qi, Li Feng, and Xiahou Xuan—he had put to death, and he knew that his end was near. He sent for his brother, Sima Zhao, who came and wept by his couch while he listened to his elder brother's last commands. “The responsibility of power is heavy, but we must bear it; there is no possible relief. You must continue my plans and maintain my policy yourself, and you must be exceedingly careful how you entrust any other with power, lest you bring about the destruction of our whole clan.” Then Sima Shi handed the seal of office to Sima Zhao, weeping the while. Sima Zhao would ask some questions still, but with a deep groan as his eye popped out Sima Shi died. It was the second month of the second year of Right Origin (AD 256). Sima Zhao put on mourning for his brother and informed the Ruler of Wei, Cao Mao, of the death. By special edict Sima Zhao was ordered to remain at Xuchang so as to guard against any attack from Wu. This order was unpleasing to its recipient, but he felt doubtful what to do. Sima Zhao took counsel with Zhong Hui, who said, “The death of your brother has disturbed the country; and if you remain here, some shifting of power at the capital will surely work to your disadvantage. It will be too late for regrets then.” Wherefore Sima Zhao left Xuchang and camped on River Luo. This move alarmed Cao Mao. Then Wang Su advised, saying, “Sima Zhao has succeeded the office of his late brother. It is well that Your Majesty should placate him with a new title.” So Cao Mao sent Wang Su with an edict creating Sima Zhao Regent Marshal, with control of the Secretariat. Sima Zhao came to Luoyang to thank the Emperor for these honors and stayed."

兵出潼關，操在馬上望見一簇林木，極其茂盛，問近侍曰：“此何處也？”答曰：“此名藍田。林木之間，乃蔡邕莊也。今邕女蔡琰，與其夫董紀居此。”原來操素與蔡邕相善。先時其女蔡琰，乃衞道玠之妻；後被北方擄去，於北地生二子，作《胡笳十八拍》，流入中原。操深憐之，使人持千金入北方贖之。左賢王懼操之勢，送蔡琰還漢。操乃以琰配與董紀為妻。當日到莊前，因想起蔡邕之事，令軍馬先行，操引近侍百餘騎，到莊門下馬。時董紀出仕於外，止有蔡琰在家，琰聞操至，忙出迎接。操至堂，琰起居畢，侍立於側。操偶見壁間懸一碑文圖軸，起身觀之。問於蔡琰，琰答曰：“此乃曹娥之碑也：昔和帝時，上虞有一巫者，名曹旴，能娑婆樂神；五月五日，醉舞舟中，墮江而死。其女年十四歲，遶江啼哭七晝夜，跳入波中；後五日，負父之屍浮於江面；里人葬之江邊。上虞令度尚奏聞朝廷，表為孝女。度尚令邯鄲淳作文鐫碑以記其事。時邯鄲淳年方十三歲，文不加點，一揮而就，立石墓側，時人奇之。妾父蔡邕聞而往觀，時日已暮，乃於暗中以手摸碑文而讀之，索筆大書八字於其背。後人鐫石，并鐫此八字。”操讀八字云：“黃絹幼婦，外孫虀臼。”操問琰曰：“汝解此意否？”琰曰：“雖先人遺筆，妾實不解其意。”操回顧衆謀士曰：“汝等解否？”衆皆不能答。於內一人出曰：“某已解其意。”操視之，乃主簿楊修也。操曰：“卿且勿言，容吾思之。”遂辭了蔡琰，引衆出莊。上馬行三里，忽省悟，笑謂修曰：“卿試言之。”修曰：“此隱語耳。‘黃絹’乃顏色之絲也：色傍加絲，是‘絕’字。‘幼婦’者，少女也：女傍少字，是‘妙’字。‘外孫’乃女之子也：女傍子字，是‘好’字。‘虀臼’乃受五辛之器也：受傍辛字，‘辤’字。總而言之，是‘絕妙好辤’四字。”操大驚曰：“正合孤意！”衆皆歎羡楊修才識之敏。,"When the soldiers left Tongguan, Cao Cao saw a cluster of trees, extremely lush, and asked his attendant, ""Where is this?"" He replied, ""This is Lantian. Between the trees is Caiyong Village. Today's daughter of Yong Cai Yan , and his husband Dong Ji lives here."" It turned out that Cao Su and Cai Yong were good friends. At first, his daughter Cai Yan was the wife of Wei Daojie; later he was taken captive by the north and gave birth to two sons in the north. Cao took deep pity on him, and sent people to the north to redeem him with a thousand pieces of gold. King Zuo Xian was afraid of the situation and sent Cai Yan back to Han. Cao took Yan Pei and Dong Ji as his wife. Before arriving at the village that day, because he remembered the incident of Cai Yong, he ordered the army horses to go first, and led more than a hundred cavalry to the village gate to dismount. At that time, when Dong Ji was out of office, only Cai Yan was at home. When Yan heard that the Cao Cao arrived, he rushed out to greet him. Cao to the hall, Yan finished living, and stood by the side. Cao Ou saw an inscription and chart hanging on the wall, and got up to watch it. When I asked Cai Yan, Yan replied, ""This is the monument of Cao E. In the past, during the reign of Emperor He, there was a witch in Shangyu, named Cao Yan, who was able to make music. On the fifth day of the fifth month, he fell into a river in a drunken dance boat and Died. His daughter was fourteen years old. She cried around the river for seven days and nights, and jumped into the waves. On the last five days, the body of her father floated on the river. Du Shang ordered Handan Chun to write a piece of writing and engraved a tablet to remember his events. At that time, Handan Chun was thirteen years old. He did not add any text, and he swiped it to the side of the stone tomb. It was dusk, so I read it in the dark by touching the inscription with my hand, and asked a large book with eight characters on its back. Later generations engraved the stone, and the eight characters were engraved."" Cao read the eight characters: ""The young woman in yellow silk, the grandson Huangjiu."" Cao asked Yan, ""Do you understand this?"" Yan said, ""Even though my ancestors left a pen, my concubine really doesn't understand it."" Cao looked back at the counselors and said, ""Do you understand?"" All of them could not answer. A person from inside said, ""A certain person has already understood his meaning."" He looked at it, and it was Yang Xiu, the chief clerk. Cao said, ""Don't say anything, sir, and allow me to think about it."" Then he bid farewell to Cai Yan and led the crowd out of the village. After riding on the horse and traveling for three miles, he suddenly realized that he was enlightened, smiled and said to Xiu: ""Try to talk about it."" Xiu said: ""This is a hidden whisper. 'Yellow silk' is the thread of color: the color is added with silk, which is the word for 'jue'.' A young woman is also a girl: the word for the little girl is the word for 'miao'. The 'grandson' is the son of the girl: the word for the child of the girl is the word for 'good'. Shou Pang Xin, the word '辤'. All in all, it is the four characters of 'exquisite and good 辤'."" Cao was shocked and said, ""It's right in line with the lonely intention!"" Everyone admired Yang Xiu's ability to understand.","Around him ride a private escort of twenty-five thousand, all elaborately colour-coded to symbolize the power of the cosmos and seasons. A truly imperial-looking procession! En route, Cao Cao realizes he is passing the home estate of an old friend, Cai Yong. The manor house is lived in now by his daughter Cai Yan and her husband, Dong Si. There is a touching story behind this friendship. In her youth, Cai Yong’s daughter Yan had been married but during a raid by tribal people from the north she had been captured, raped and forced to bear two children by her captor. During her time in exile she had written a set of poems called ‘Eighteen Compositions for Foreign Music’, which brought her renown. Cao Cao was deeply moved by her plight. He offered a ransom of a thousand ounces of gold. The chief of the Xiongnu tribe who had captured her was so in awe of Cao Cao that he sent her back. It was Cao Cao who arranged her subsequent marriage to Dong Si. Arriving with just a small bodyguard at the front door, he is greeted by Cai Yan – her husband being away on business. On the way in, Cao Cao notices a stone rubbing and asks about it. ‘It dates from the time of Emperor He17 and is called the stele of Cao E. She was the daughter of a shaman. He was renowned for his ecstatic dances and singing and then one day when he was drunk he fell into the river and drowned. His daughter, Cao E, mourned by the riverside for seven days and nights and then threw herself into the river. Five days later, her body surfaced, holding her father in her arms. They were buried with due honour, and when the imperial court was told the story a stele was ordered and this story inscribed. The author was just thirteen years old when he wrote the text, and this made the stone even more famous. Years later, my father went to see it, and, even though it was almost dark, he was able to read the characters with his fingers. He then wrote eight characters in ink on the back, and these were later inscribed on the stele as well.’ Cao Cao reads the eight characters: ‘Yellow silk; young woman; distaff grandchild; pounding mortar.’ ‘Does anyone understand what this means?’ asks Cao Cao, to which comes the answer: ‘No.’ ‘Even though my father wrote them,’ says Cai Yan, ‘I have no idea what they mean.’ After a pleasant but brief stay they are riding away, when Cao Cao laughs because he has worked it out. Yang Xiu, his adviser travelling with him, too has the answer, and Cao Cao tells him to spell it out. ‘The character for colour – that’s the yellow clue – and that for silk make the character for “absolutely”. A young woman is both young and little, and the characters for young and little give the character “beautiful”. A distaff grandchild is a daughter’s son, and the characters for daughter and son give the character “good” or “worthy”. Finally, pounding in a mortar is how to mix the five bitter herbs, and put the characters for bowl and bitter and you have the character for “tell”. So the whole riddle means “Absolutely beautiful and worthy to be told.” Everyone delights in the skill involved in unravelling this riddle as they ride on to war.","As they debouched through Tong Pass, Cao Cao noticed in the distance a thick wood, very luxuriant, and asked those near him what it was called. “This place is the Indigo Field,” they replied. “And in that wood is the estate of the late Minister Cai Yong. His daughter, Cai Yan, and her present husband, Dong Si, live there.” Now Cao Cao and Cai Yong had been excellent friends at one time. Cai Yong's daughter had been first married to Wei Zhongdao. Then she was abducted by the frontier tribes and taken away to the north, where she had borne two sons. She had composed a ballad called “Eighteen Stanzas for the Mongol Flageolet,” which was widespread to the empire. Cao Cao had been moved by pity for her sorrows and sent a messenger with a thousand ounces of gold to ransom her. The Prince of the frontier Xiongnu State, Ce Xian the Khan, overawed by Cao Cao's strength, had restored her to Cai Yong. Ordering his escort to march on, Cao Cao went up to the gate with only a few attendants, dismounted and inquired after the lady of the house. At this time Dong Si was absent at his post, and the lady was alone. As soon as she heard who her visitor was, she hastened to welcome him and led him into the reception room. When Cao Cao was seated and she had performed the proper salutations, she stood respectfully at his side. Glancing round the room, Cao Cao saw a rubbing of a tablet hanging on the wall. So he got up to read it, and asked his hostess about it. “It is a tablet of Cao E, or the fair Lady Cao. In the time of the Emperor He (AD 100), in the Xiongnu State there was a certain magician named Cao Xu, who could dance and sing like the very Spirit of Music. On the fifth of the fifth month he was out in a boat, and being intoxicated, fell overboard and was drowned. He had a daughter, Cao E, then fourteen years of age. She was greatly distressed and sought the body of her father for seven days and nights, weeping all the while. Then she threw herself into the waves, and five days later she floated to the surface with her father's body in her arms. The villagers buried them on the bank, and the magistrate reported the occurrence to the Emperor as a worthy instance of daughterly affection and remarkable piety. “A later magistrate had the story inscribed by Handan Chun in memory of the event. At that time Handan Chun was only thirteen, but the composition of the inscription was so perfect that neither jot nor tittle could be added, and yet he had written it impromptu without revision. The stone was set up beside the grave, and both inscription and story were the admiration of all the people of that day. My father went to see it. It was evening, but in the obscurity he felt out the inscription with his fingers. He got hold of a pencil and wrote eight large characters on the reverse of the stone and, later, some person recutting the stone engraved these eight words as well.” Cao Cao then read the eight words; they formed an enigma. Literally they read, “yellow silk, young wife, a daughter's child, pestle and mortar.” “Can you explain?” asked Cao Cao of his hostess. “No; although it is a writing of my father's, thy handmaid cannot interpret it,” she replied. Turning to the strategists of his staff, Cao Cao said, “Can any one of you explain it?” But no one made any reply. Suddenly, they heard one voice, “I have grasped the meaning of it.” The man who said he had fathomed the meaning was First Secretary Yang Xiu. “Do not tell me yet; let me think it out,” said Cao Cao. Soon after they took leave of the lady, went out of the farm, and rode on. About one mile from the farm, the meaning suddenly dawned upon Cao Cao, and he laughingly turned to Yang Xiu, saying, “Now, you may try.” “This is the solution of the enigma,” said Yang Xiu. “'Yellow silk' is silk threads of natural color, and the character for 'silk' placed beside that for 'color' forms a word meaning 'finally, decidedly;' the 'young wife' is a 'little female,' and the character for 'female' with 'little,' or 'few,' placed beside it forms a word meaning 'admirable, fine;' the 'daughter's child' is 'daughter' and 'child,' which side by side make the word 'good;' and a 'pestle and mortar' suggest pounding together the five bitter herbs in a receptacle: the character for 'receptacle' and 'bitter' form a word meaning 'to tell.' So the four words are 'Decidedly fine and well told.'“ Cao Cao was astonished at Yang Xiu's cleverness, and said, “Just what I made it.” Those around greatly wondered at Yang Xiu's ingenuity and knowledge."

When the document arrived at Xiaoting, Han Dang and Zhou Tai were startled and said, ""How can your lord make a scholar to command the army?"" When Xun rose to discuss matters, everyone reluctantly participated in congratulations. Xun said: ""The Lord has ordered me to be a general and supervise the army to break through Shu. The army has regular laws, which should be obeyed by the public and others. Those who violate the laws of the king have no relatives, so don't regret it."" Everyone was silent. Zhou Tai said: ""At present, Sun Huan, the general of Andong, is the concubine of the Lord. Seeing that he is trapped in the city of Yiling, there is no food or grass inside, and there is no rescuer outside. Please ask the governor to take good measures as soon as possible to rescue Sun Huan, so as to reassure the Lord. Xun said, ""I know that Sun Andong has won the heart of the army, and he will be able to hold on to him without saving him. After I break through Shu, he will come out of his own accord."" Everyone laughed and retreated. Han Dang called Zhou Tai and said, ""I have ordered this ruozi as a general, and the Eastern Wu period will be over—does the public see what he has done?"" Tai said, ""I will try it with words, but there is no way to do it—An Neng can break Shu. ?""","They raise the issue of Sun Huan being trapped at Yiling and needing urgently to be rescued, but Lu Xun refuses to go to his aid, saying that he can look after himself until the western forces have been beaten.","Lu Xun then descended. He chose Xu Sheng and Ding Feng as commanders of his guards, and the army lost no time in taking the field. The various dispositions of horse and foot were made, and dispatches were sent to the outlying commanders. When the dispatch reached Han Dang and Zhou Tai, who were camping near Xiaoting, they were alarmed, saying, “Why did the Prince appoint a mere bookish student to the commandership of all armed forces?” So when the new Commander-in-Chief came, they showed their discontent by a lack of hearty support. Lu Xun went to his tent to receive the reports, and there the majority of the officers manifested only sullen respect and unwilling deference. Then Lu Xun addressed them, saying, “By order of my superior I am Commander-in-Chief, and my commission is to destroy Shu. You, gentlemen, all know the ordinary military rules, and you would do well to obey them. The law is no respecter of persons, as those who disobey will find out. Do not have to regret when it is too late.” They nodded in sullen acquiescence. Then Zhou Tai said, “There is Sun Huan, nephew of our Prince; he is surrounded at Yiling and is short of food. I venture to request you to send relief to him and get him out, so that the Prince's heart may be comforted.” “I know all about him. His soldiers are faithful, and he can easily maintain his position. There is no need to go to his aid. When Shu is broken, he will be free to come out.” They all sniggered as they left the tent, and Han Dang did not fail to express his contempt for the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief. “This will be the end of Wu,” said he to his colleague. “Did you note what he said?” “I tried him just to see what he would do,” said Zhou Tai. “You see he had no plan ready; he destroys Shu indeed!”"

While hesitating, he suddenly reported that the village of Shu was empty, and all the people and horses left. Because of Kongming's resourcefulness, Yi did not dare to chase lightly, so he led more than a hundred cavalry to the Shu camp to take a look. . The report said: ""The stove in this camp is one more point than before."" Sima Yi said to the generals: ""I expected Kongming to be resourceful, and now I will increase the number of troops and stoves. , and then make a good plan."" So he returned to the army and did not pursue it. Kong Ming did not lose a single person, looking at Chengdu and left. The next time, the natives of Kawaguchi came to report to Sima Yi, saying that when Kongming withdrew his troops, he did not see any additional troops, but only increased kitchens. Yi Yangtian sighed and said, ""Kong Ming followed Yu Xu's method, but he has deceived me! His strategy is not as good as mine!"" Then he led the army back to Luoyang. Exactly:","left where the army has camped overnight – he fools Sima Yi yet again into thinking the Shu army is expanding, not shrinking. Sima therefore does not attack.","Confident of the effect that Gou An's lying report would produce, Sima Yi waited for the retreat of the Shu army to begin. He was still waiting when the scouts told him the enemy's camps were empty. Wishing to make sure, he rode out himself with a small reconnoitering party and inspected the empty camps. Then he bade them count the stoves. Next day he paid a second visit to another empty camp, and again the cooking stoves were counted. The count showed an increase of a half. “I felt sure that Zhuge Liang would have more troops ready. He has increased the cooking arrangements, and so, if we pursue, he will be ready for us. No; we also will retire and await another opportunity.” So there was no pursuit, and Zhuge Liang did not lose a soldier on his retreat to Hanzhong. By and by, people came in from the Lands of Rivers to say that the retreat was a fact, and that only the cooking arrangements had been increased, not the soldiers. Sima Yi knew that he had been tricked, and looking up the sky, he sighed, “Zhuge Liang imitated the ruse of Sun Bin to rouse my suspicion. His thinking is superior to mine.” And Sima Yi set out for Luoyang. When players of equal skill are matched,"
周善方欲開船，只聽得岸上有人大叫：“且休開船，容與夫人餞行！”視之，乃趙雲也。原來趙雲巡哨方回，聽得這個消息，吃了一驚，只帶四五騎旋風般沿江趕來。周善手執長戈，大喝曰：“汝何人，敢當主母！”叱令軍士一齊開船，各將軍器出來，擺列在船上。風順水急，船皆隨流而去。趙雲沿江趕叫：“任從夫人去。只有一句話拜稟。”周善不睬，只催船速進。趙雲沿江趕到十餘里，忽見江灘斜纜一隻漁船在那裏。趙雲棄馬執鎗，跳上漁船，只兩人駕船前來，望着夫人所坐大船追趕。周善敎軍士放箭。趙雲以鎗撥之，箭皆紛紛落水。離大船懸隔丈餘，吳兵用鎗亂刺。趙雲棄鎗在小船上，掣所佩靑釭劍在手，分開鎗搠，望吳船湧身一跳，早登大船。吳兵盡皆驚倒。趙雲入艙中，見夫人抱阿斗於懷中，喝趙雲曰：“何故無禮！”雲插劍聲喏曰：“主母欲何往？何故不令軍師知會？”夫人曰：“我母親病在危篤，無暇報知。”雲曰：“主母探病，何故帶小主人去？”夫人曰：“阿斗是吾子，留在荊州，無人看覷。”雲曰：“主母差矣：主人一生，只有這點骨血。小將在當陽長坂坡百萬軍中救出。今日夫人却欲抱將去，是何道理？”夫人怒曰：“量汝只是帳下一武夫，安敢管我家事！”雲曰：“夫人要去便去，只留下小主人。”夫人喝曰：“汝半路輒入船中，必有反意！”雲曰：“若不留下小主人，縱然萬死，亦下敢放夫人去。”夫人喝侍婢向前揪捽，被趙雲推倒，就懷中奪了阿斗，抱出船頭上。欲要傍岸，又無幫手；欲要行兇，又恐礙於道理：進退不得。夫人喝侍婢奪阿斗，趙雲一手抱定阿斗，一手仗劍，人不敢近。周善在後梢挾住舵，只顧放船下水。風順水急，望中流而去。趙雲孤掌難鳴，只護得阿斗，安能移舟傍岸？,"Zhou Shanfang was about to start the boat, but he heard someone on the shore shouting: ""Don't let the boat go, Rong and his wife are on the way!"" It was Zhao Yun who saw it. It turned out that Zhao Yun was patrolling the post and returning, and when he heard the news, he was surprised, and only brought four or five horses along the river like a whirlwind. Zhou Shan held a long dagger in his hand and shouted, ""Who are you, you dare to be a mistress!"" He ordered the sergeants to sail the boat together, and each of them brought out their weapons and placed them on the boat. The wind was smooth and the water was fast, and the boats went with the current. Zhao Yun rushed along the river and called: ""Let's go, Madam. There is only one word of thanks."" Zhou Shan ignored it and only urged the boat to speed up. Zhao Yun rushed along the river for more than ten miles, and suddenly saw a fishing boat with a sloping cable on the beach. Zhao Yun abandoned his horse and held his spear, jumped onto the fishing boat, and the two of them drove the boat forward, watching the big boat where his wife was chasing. Sergeant Zhou Shanzhi fired an arrow. Zhao Yun stabbed it with his spear, and all the arrows fell into the water. Hanging more than ten feet away from the ship, Wu Bing stabbed him with his spear. Zhao Yun abandoned his spear on the small boat, and held the sword he was wearing in his hand. Wu Bing was all shocked. When Zhao Yun entered the cabin, he saw his wife holding A Dou in her arms and shouted at Zhao Yun, ""Why are you being rude!"" The illness is in danger, and I have no time to report it."" Yun said, ""My mistress is visiting, why did you bring my little master?"" The lady said, ""A-dou is my son, staying in Jingzhou, and no one will look at it."" Yun said, ""My mistress is bad: The master has only this blood in his life. The young general was rescued from the millions of troops in Changbanpo, Dangyang. Today, the wife wants to take the general away, what is the reason?"" The wife said angrily: ""You are just a warrior under the tent, An dare to take care of me. Family matters!"" Yun said, ""If you want to go, Madam, leave only the little master."" Madam shouted, ""If you get into the boat halfway, you must have an objection!"" Yun said, ""If you don't leave the little master, you will die. I also dare to let the madam go."" The madam shouted that the maid pushed forward and was pushed down by Zhao Yun, so she grabbed A Dou in her arms and carried it out of the bow of the boat. If you want to go to the shore, there is no helper; if you want to commit murder, you are afraid of the truth: you cannot advance or retreat. The madam ordered the servant to take Ah Dou, and Zhao Yun held Ah Dou in one hand and held the sword in the other, so no one dared to approach. Zhou Shan held the rudder at the stern and just let the boat go into the water. The wind is smooth and the water is fast, looking at the middle of the stream. Zhao Yun's palm is hard to cry, and he can only protect Adou, can he move the boat to the shore?","Just as they are about to push off from the shore, a loud shout stops them in their tracks – ‘Wait. I must say goodbye to my lady’ – and there, riding up to the shoreline, is Zhao Zilong. Returning from patrol, he has discovered her departure and, riding as fast as he can, he just reaches the shoreline in time. But Zhao Shan is not to be thwarted and orders the boats to set sail. Still shouting out, Zhao Zilong gallops along the shoreline, demanding that he be allowed to speak to Lady Sun – to no avail, for Zhao Shan simply ignores him. Then, however, Zhao Zilong spots a fishing boat tied up. He grabs his spear, leaps aboard and pushes off in pursuit, with one of his men steering the boat. As they draw nearer and nearer to the boats, Zhao Shan orders the archers to fire, but Zhao Zilong easily deflects them using his spear. Getting closer and closer, Zhao Zilong is stabbed at by Zhao Shan’s men with their swords, but again he deflects them, drawing his own sword. As soon as the boats are close enough, he leaps aboard, driving the defenders back in astonishment and fear. Advancing with his sword drawn, to her horror, he forces his way into Lady Sun’s cabin. ‘How dare you!’ she cries. ‘Where are you going, my lady? Why have you not asked permission?’ ‘My mother is dying, and there is no time for such things.’ ‘But, my lady,’ replies Zhao Zilong, ‘why are you taking the young master with you?’ ‘Ah Dou is my child.","But just as the ships were starting, a voice was heard, shouting, “Do not start yet; let me bid my lady farewell.” The voice was Zhao Yun's; he had just returned from an inspection trip, and they had at once told him of Lady Sun's sudden departure. As soon as he had recovered from his surprise, he dashed down to the river bank like a whirlwind, with only half a dozen followers. He arrived only just in time; the boat was starting, and Zhou Shan stood in the prow, a long spear in his hand. “Who are you that you dare hinder the movements of your mistress?” cried Zhou Shan. Zhou Shan bade his soldiers cast off and get under way, and also to prepare their weapons to fight. The ship moved off with a fair wind and a strong current beneath her keel. But Zhao Yun followed along the bank. “My lady may go or not as she pleases,” cried he, “but I have one word to say to her.” Zhou Shan turned a deaf ear and only urged his soldiers to get greater speed on the ship. Zhao Yun followed down the bank for some three or more miles. Then he saw a fishing boat made fast to the bank. He at once dismounted, cast off the rope, took his spear, and leaped into the boat. Then he made the two men row him toward the vessel in which sat Lady Sun. As he approached, the soldiers of the South Land threatened him with their spears. Thereupon he threw his spear into the bottom of the boat, drew the glittering steel blade he wore, dashed aside the opposing spears, and leaped upon the larger vessel. The guards of the South Land fell back in surprise and fear, and Zhao Yun went down into the body of the ship. There sat Lady Sun with little Liu Shan in her arms. “Why this rude intrusion?” said she angrily. The warrior sheathed his sword and said humbly, “Whither may my mistress be going, and why goes she privily?” “My mother is ill and on the point of death; I had no time to inform any person of my departure,” said Lady Sun. “But why take the young master if you are going merely to see a sick person?” said Zhao Yun. “Liu Shan is my son, and I would not leave him behind to be neglected.” “Mistress, you have acted wrongly. My lord has but this one son of his body, and I rescued the child lord from among many thousand troops of Cao Cao in the great battle at Long Slope Bridge in Dangyang. There is no reason for you to take him away.” Lady Sun took refuge in anger. “You leave my family affairs alone, you common soldier!” cried she. “My lady, if you will go, then go, but leave the young master behind.” “You are a rebel, jumping on board the ship like that!” cried Lady Sun. “If you will not leave the young lord behind, I refuse to let you go, come what may,” said Zhao Yun. Lady Sun called in her maids to seize him, but he just pushed them off. Then he took the boy from her arms and ran out to the prow of the ship. He tried to get the vessel in to the bank, but no one would aid him, and he thought it would be wrong to begin to slay indiscriminately. He knew not what to do in such a quandary. And Lady Sun was screaming to her maids to take the boy away from him. But he kept too firm a grip on the child, and the good sword in his other hand kept every one at bay. Zhou Shan was at the helm, giving all his attention to getting the ship out into the current and away down the river. He steered for the middle of the stream, where the wind was strong. Zhao Yun, one hand taken up with holding the boy, was quite unable to get the vessel in toward the shore."
却說二賊當夜割了張飛首級，便引數十人連夜投東吳去了。次日，軍中聞知，起兵追之不及。時有張飛部將吳班，向自荊州來見先主，先主用為牙門將，使佐張飛守閬中。當下吳班先發表章，奏知天子；然後令長子張苞具棺槨盛貯，令弟張紹守閬中，苞自來報先主。時先主已擇期出師。大小官僚，皆隨孔明送十里方回。孔明回至成都，怏怏不樂，顧謂衆官曰：“法孝直若在，必能制主上東行也。”,"But they said that the two thieves cut off Zhang Fei's head that night, so they led dozens of people to go to Soochow overnight. The next day, when the army heard about it, they were unable to catch up. At that time, Wu Ban, a general under Zhang Fei, came to see the First Sovereign from Jingzhou, and the First Sovereign used him as the general of the teeth, making his assistant Zhang Fei guard Langzhong. At the moment, Wu Ban first published a chapter and reported to the emperor; then he ordered his eldest son Zhang Bao to put a coffin in a coffin for storage, and ordered his younger brother Zhang Shao to guard Langzhong, and Bao came to report to the First Sovereign. At that time, the First Lord had chosen a time to leave the teacher. Bureaucrats, big and small, were sent back ten miles with Kong Ming. When Kongming returned to Chengdu, he was very unhappy, and he said to the officials, ""If Dharma and filial piety are upright, you will surely be able to control the Lord and go eastward.""","Fooling Zhang He, it was he who gained Hanzhong for Xuande. His death prior to the invasion of the south Has been a cause of sadness ever since in Langzhong. The two murderers cut off Zhang Fei’s head and flee south to the Wu.","Langzhong will grieve him all the ages through. Having done their victim to death, the two murderers hacked off his head and made off for the country of Wu without loss of time; and when the deed was known, they had got too far for capture. The assassination was reported in a memorial by a commander of Zhang Fei named Wu Ban, who had left Jingzhou to see the First Ruler and then had been sent to serve under Zhang Fei. He wrote a memorial to the First Ruler and bade the eldest son, Zhang Bao, prepare a coffin for the remains. After the ceremony, leaving his younger brother, Zhang Shao, to hold Langzhong, Zhang Bao went to see the Emperor. The day of departure had already come, and the First Ruler had left the capital. Zhuge Liang and many officers had escorted him out of the city for three miles and taken leave. Returning to Chengdu, Zhuge Liang felt ill at ease, and he remarked to his colleagues, “If Fa Zheng had been alive, he would have been able to interdict this expedition.”"

魏延解孟獲到大寨來見孔明。孔明早已殺牛宰馬，設宴在寨；却敎帳中排開七重圍子手，刀鎗劍戟，燦若霜雪；又執御賜黃金銊斧，曲柄傘蓋，前後羽葆鼓吹，左右排開御林軍，布列得十分嚴整。孔明端坐於帳上，只見蠻兵紛紛穰穰，解到無數。孔明喚到帳中，盡去其縛，撫諭曰：“汝等皆是好百姓，不幸被孟獲所拘，今受驚諕。吾想汝等父母、兄弟、妻子必倚門而望；若聽知陣敗，定然割肚牽腸，眼中流血。吾今盡放汝等回去，以安各人父母、兄弟、妻子之心。”言訖，各賜酒食米糧而遣之。蠻兵深感其恩，泣拜而去。孔明敎喚武士押過孟獲來。不移時，前推後擁，縛至帳前。獲跪於帳下。孔明曰：“先帝待汝不薄，汝何敢背反？”獲曰：“兩川之地，皆是他人所占地土；汝主倚強奪之，自稱為帝。吾世居此處，汝等無禮，侵我土地：何為反耶？”孔明曰：“吾今擒汝，汝心服否？”獲曰：“山僻路狹，誤遭汝手，如何肯服？”孔明曰：“汝旣不服，吾放汝去，若何？”獲曰：“汝放我回去，再整軍馬，共決雌雄；若能再擒吾，吾方服也。”孔明卽令去其縛，與衣服穿了，賜以酒食，給與鞍馬，差人送出路徑，望本寨而去。正是：,"Wei Yanxie Meng Huo went to Dazhai to see Kongming. Kong Ming had already slaughtered oxen and horses, and held a banquet in the village; but he lined up in the tent a seven-layered fence, swords, spears, swords, and halberds, shining like frost and snow; The Royal Forest Army was lined up very neatly. Kong Ming was sitting on the tent, and saw the barbarians rushing around, and there were countless solutions. Kong Ming summoned him to the tent, removed all his restraints, and said, ""You are all good people, unfortunately you were detained by Meng Huo, and now you are shocked. I think your parents, brothers, and wives will lean on the door and look; If you know that the battle is defeated, you will definitely cut your belly and gut, and your eyes will bleed. I will let you all go back now, so as to protect the hearts of your parents, brothers, and wives."" After speaking, they sent them away with food, wine, and rice. The barbarian was deeply grateful and went away in tears. Kong Ming ordered the warriors to escort Meng Huolai. When not moving, push forward and hold back, and tie it to the front of the tent. Kneeling under the tent. Kong Ming said: ""The first emperor treated you well, why would you dare to turn your back?"" Huo said: ""The land of the two rivers is the land occupied by others; If you are rude and invade my land: why is it against you?"" Kong Ming said, ""I capture you now, do you agree with me?"" Huo said, ""The mountain is remote and the road is narrow, and I was caught by your hand by mistake, how can you agree to surrender?"" Kong Ming said: ""If you don't agree, I'll let you go, what if?"" Huo said, ""If you let me go back, you will reorganize the army and horses, and we will decide the male and the female. If you can capture me again, we will serve you."" Clothes are worn, food and wine are given, saddle horses are given, and people are sent out to look for the village. Exactly:","So knowing you’re just good people, forced into military service by Meng Huo, I release you. Go home and celebrate with those you love.’ You can imagine the joy and happiness this provokes, and the grateful troops praise Kong Ming to the Heavens. Then Kong Ming turns his attention to Meng Huo and upbraids him for rebelling. To this Meng Huo furiously replies: ‘Once, all this land of the Riverlands belonged to us. You and your lord seized it by violence and self-declared yourselves to be its rulers – even making your leader an emperor! For generations my ancestors ruled here – on the very lands you’ve seized without good reason. You have acted so treacherously. You are the real traitors. So what is this “rebellion” of which you speak? Answer me that.’ ‘Well,’ says Kong Ming, ‘you’re my prisoner now, so will you obey?’ ‘You trapped me, so why should I surrender?’ To this Kong Ming replies, ‘But you see I’m going to let you go. So what do you have to say to that?’ ‘Set me free, and I’ll gather fresh men and come at you again. But if you capture me then, well, then I’ll submit.’ So Kong Ming orders that the shackles be removed and Meng Huo be given food, drink and clothing, a horse to ride and be allowed to leave the camp. Will this work?","The King and his followers were taken to the main camp, where Zhuge Liang was waiting with wine and meat ready for the captives. But his tent was now guarded by soldiers all well armed with snow-glittering weapons, beside the lictors bearing the golden axes, a present from the Emperor, and other insignia of rank. The feather-hatted drummers and clarion players were in front and behind, and the Imperial Guards were extended on both sides. The whole was very imposing and awe-inspiring. Zhuge Liang was seated at the top of it all and watched the captives as they came forward in crowds. When they were all assembled, he ordered their bonds to be loosed, and then he addressed them. “You are all simple and well-disposed people who have been led into trouble by Meng Huo. I know your fathers and mothers, your brothers and wives, and your children are anxiously watching from the doorways for your return, and they are cut to dear suffering that the news of defeat and capture has reached their ears. They are weeping bitter tears for you. And so I will set you all free to go home and comfort them.” After they had been given food and wine and a present of grain, he sent them all away. They went off grateful for the kindness shown them, but they wept as they thanked Zhuge Liang. Then the guards were told to bring the King before the tent. He came, bound, being hustled forward. He knelt in front of the Commander-in-Chief, who said, “Why did you rebel after the generous treatment you have received from our Emperor?” “The two Lands of the Rivers belonged to others, and your lord took it from them by force, and gave himself the title of Emperor. My people have lived here for ages, and you and yours invaded my country without the least excuse. How can you talk of rebellion to me?” “You are my prisoner; will you submit or are you still contumacious?” “Why should I submit? You happened to find me in a narrow place; that is all.” “If I release you, what then?” “If you release me I shall return, and when I have set my army in order, I shall come to fight you again. However, if you catch me once more, I will submit.” The King's bonds were loosed; he was clothed and refreshed, given a horse and caparisons, and sent with a guide to his own camp."
是夜，天愁地慘，月色無光，孔明奄然歸天。姜維、楊儀遵孔明遺命，不敢舉哀，依法成殮，安置龕中，令心腹將卒三百人守護；隨傳密令，使魏延斷後，各處營寨一一退去。,"It was night, the sky was sad and the earth was miserable, the moonlight was dull, and Kong Ming was about to return to the sky. Jiang Wei and Yang Yi obeyed Kongming's orders and did not dare to express their grief. They built the burial according to the law, placed them in the shrines, and ordered 300 confidants to guard them.","At his death Heaven and Earth mourn; the moon wanes, dimmed by Kong Ming’s soul on its journey to Heaven. But as instructed, Jiang Wei and Yang Yi ban any mourning. They dress his body and put it in the box as they were directed. Three hundred loyal men stand guard.","Heaven grieved and earth mourned on the night of Zhuge Liang's death. Even the moon was dimmed, as Zhuge Liang's soul returned to Heaven. As the late commander had directed, Jiang Wei and Yang Yi forbade the mourning of his death. His body was placed in the coffer as he had wished, and three hundred of his near comrades were appointed to watch it. Secret orders were given to Wei Yan to command the rearguard, and then, one by one, the camps were broken up and the army began its homeward march."
張飛殺到巴郡城下，後軍已自入城。張飛叫休殺百姓，出榜安民。羣刀手把嚴顏推至。張飛坐於廳上，嚴顏不肯跪下。飛怒目咬牙大叱曰：“大將到此，為何不降，而敢拒敵？”嚴顏全無懼色，回叱飛曰：“汝等無義，侵我州郡！但有斷頭將軍！無降將軍！”飛大怒，喝左右斬來。嚴顏喝曰：“賊匹夫！砍頭便砍，何怒也？”張飛見嚴顏聲音雄壯，面不改色，乃回嗔作喜，下階叱退左右，親解其縛，取衣衣之，扶在正中高坐，低頭便拜曰：“適來言語冒瀆，幸勿見責。吾素知老將軍乃豪傑之士也。”嚴顏感其恩義，乃降。後人有詩讚嚴顏曰：,"Zhang Fei was killed in the city of Berkshire, and the army behind him had already entered the city. Zhang Fei told Hugh to kill the people and come out on the list to save the people. The group of knives pushed Yan Yan to him. Zhang Fei sat in the hall, but Yan Yan refused to kneel down. Fei's angry eyes gritted his teeth and shouted: ""The generals are here, why didn't they come down, but dare to resist the enemy?"" Yan Yanquan had no fear, and shouted back at Fei: ""You are unrighteous, and invade our state and county! But there are generals with severed heads. General Wujian!"" Fei was furious and slashed from left to right. Yan Yan shouted, ""A thief! If you chop off your head, why would you be angry?"" When Zhang Fei saw Yan Yan's strong voice and his face did not change his expression, Zhang Fei responded with anger and joy. Then, he supported him and sat high in the middle, bowed his head and bowed, saying: ""It's appropriate to speak blasphemously, but fortunately do not take responsibility. I know that the old general is a hero."" Yan Yan felt his kindness and bowed. Later generations have a poem to praise Yan Yan, saying:","roars Zhang Fei. ‘You immoral raiders! I might lose my head but I will never give in!’ Zhang Fei, furious that he is still resisting, orders his execution. ‘Oh go on, you thug! Take the head, but why this anger?’ Yan Yan’s defiant stance catches Zhang Fei off guard, and he stops to consider this courageous man. He steps down and personally removes the chains, orders that he be given fresh clothes and brings him to sit beside him in a place of honour. Deeply moved by this, Yan Yan falls to his knees.","To reach the walls of the city was now easy. After entering the gates, the leader ordered his soldiers not to hurt the people, and he put out proclamations to pacify the citizens. By and by a party of executioners brought in the prisoner. Zhang Fei took his seat in the great hall, and the late commander of the city was brought before him by a party of executioners. Yan Yan refused to kneel before his captor. “Why did you not surrender at first?” cried Zhang Fei, angrily grinding his teeth. “How dared you try to oppose me?” “Because you are a lot of unrighteous and lawless invaders!” replied Yan Yan without the least sign of fear. “You may behead me as you will, but I will not surrender to you.” Zhang Fei angrily gave the order for his execution. “Strike, if you want to, fool; why so angry?” said Yan Yan. This bold defiance was not lost upon Zhang Fei. Rising from his seat, he went down the steps, put aside the lictors, and began to loosen the prisoner's bonds. Then he dressed Yan Yan in new garments and led him to the high place. When Yan Yan was seated, Zhang Fei made a low bow, saying, “I have always known you were a hero. Now I pray you not remember against me the roughness of my speech.” Yan Yan was overcome with this kindness and forthwith surrendered."

却說關公在麥城盼望上庸兵到，却不見動靜；手下止有五六百人，多半帶傷；城中無糧，甚是苦楚。忽報城下一人敎休放箭，有話來見君侯。公令放入，問之，乃諸葛瑾也。禮畢茶罷，瑾曰：“今奉吳侯命，特來勸諭將軍。自古道：‘識時務者為俊傑。’今將軍所統漢上九郡，皆已屬他人矣；止有孤城一區，內無糧草，外無救兵，危在旦夕。將軍何不從瑾之言：歸順吳侯，復鎮荊襄，可以保全家眷。幸君侯熟思之。”關公正色而言曰：“吾乃解良一武夫，蒙吾主以手足相待，安肯背義投敵國乎？城若破，有死而已。玉可碎而不可改其白，竹可焚而不可毁其節。身雖殞，名可垂於竹帛也。汝勿多言，速請出城。吾欲與孫權決一死戰！”瑾曰：“吳侯欲與君侯結秦、晉之好，同力破曹，共扶漢室，別無他意。君侯何執迷如是？”言未畢，關平拔劍而前，欲斬諸葛瑾。公止之曰：“彼弟孔明在蜀，佐汝伯父，今若殺彼，傷其兄弟之情也。”遂令左右逐出諸葛瑾。瑾滿面羞慚，上馬出城，回見吳侯曰：“關公心如鐵石，不可說也。”孫權曰：“眞忠臣也！似此如之奈何？”呂範曰：“某請卜其休咎。”權卽令卜之。範揲蓍成象，乃“地水師卦” ，更有玄武臨應，主敵人遠奔。權問呂蒙曰：“卦主敵人遠奔，卿以何策擒之？”蒙笑曰：“卦象正合某之機也。關公雖有沖天之翼，飛不出吾羅網矣！”正是：,"However, it is said that Guan Gong was in Maicheng hoping for the arrival of Shangyong soldiers, but there was no movement; there were only five or six hundred men under his command, most of them were injured; there was no food in the city, and it was very painful. Suddenly, someone from Baocheng told Xiu to shoot arrows, and he had something to say to the prince. The official order was put in and asked, it was Zhuge Jin. After the ceremony was over, Jin said: ""I have been ordered by the Marquis of Wu, and I have come to advise the general. Since ancient times, there is a saying: 'Those who understand the current affairs are the best.' Today, the nine commanderies in the Han Dynasty under the command of the general belong to others; there are only isolated cities. In the first district, there is no food and grass inside, and there is no rescue of soldiers outside. The general is in danger. Why don’t the general follow Jin’s words: return to the Marquis of Wu and restore Jingxiang, so that the family can be saved. Fortunately, the prince and the marquis thought about it carefully.” Guan Zheng said sternly: “I am Xie Liang, a warrior, and my lord treat each other as brothers and sisters, is it safe to surrender to the enemy country? The name can be attached to the bamboo and silk. Don’t say too much, please leave the city quickly. I want to fight to the death with Sun Quan!” Jin said: “Wu Hou wants to make Qin and Jin friendship with Jun Hou, to break down Cao Cao and support the Han Dynasty together. Don't have other intentions. Why are you so obsessed with this?"" Before he could finish speaking, Guan Ping drew his sword and stepped forward, intending to kill Zhuge Jin. Gong Zhizhi said, ""His younger brother Kongming is in Shu, and he is in charge of Uncle Ru. If he kills him now, it will hurt his brother's feelings."" With shame on his face, Jin mounted his horse and left the city. When he returned to see the Marquis of Wu, he said, ""Guan Gong's heart is like an iron stone, and he cannot be said."" Sun Quan said, ""I am a loyal minister! Blame it."" Quan Zhi ordered him. Fan Husei's imagery is the ""Geoshui Master Gua"", and there is also Xuanwu's response, and the main enemy runs away. Quan asked Lu Meng: ""The hexagram master's enemy is running far away, what strategy will you use to capture him?"" Meng smiled and said, ""The hexagram image is just right for a certain opportunity. Although Guan Gong has wings that reach the sky, he can't fly out of my net!"" Yes:","Back in Maicheng, Guan Yu waits in vain for sight of the relief column. With so few men and so many wounded, the odds are stacked against him. Before the city gate appears Zhuge Jin, asking for an audience, and he is admitted. ‘I come at the express command of Sun Quan,’ he says to Guan Yu. ‘You’ve lost everything except for this meagre place. It’ll fall either tonight or tomorrow. So why don’t you face reality and surrender to the lord of the south, and soon you’ll be put back in control? This will save your family as well.’ ‘I’m but a simple warrior,’ replies Guan Yu, ‘ but I had the fortune to become a brother of my lord. There is no way I can betray him. If the town falls, I die. Jade may break, but that it is white cannot be changed. Bamboo will burn, but the joints remain. A man may die, but his name will resound for generations. Go now. This will be finished between Sun Quan and myself.’ Zhuge Jin tries other means of persuasion, but this only causes Guan Ping to draw his sword and threaten to kill him. He is stopped by a wave of his hand by his father. Shortly after, Zhuge Jin is driven from the town. Returning flushed with anger and embarrassment, Zhuge Jin informs Sun Quan that Guan Yu will not surrender. ‘Well, that’s real loyalty. So what do we do next?’ asks Sun Quan. Lü Fan recommends that they consult the Yi Jing, and this they do. The answer given is ‘Master with the Earth above Water.’ This is taken to mean an enemy will flee far, far away. ‘If this is so,’ says Sun Quan, ‘how do we capture him?’ Lü Meng replies, ‘This prediction is perfect. Guan Yu may have wings from Heaven, but we’ve nets to catch him!’ It is said:","His army numbered but a few hundred, many wounded; there was no food. Then someone came to the foot of the wall and, calling out to the defenders on the wall not to shoot, said he had a message for the commander. He was allowed to enter; it was Zhuge Jin. When he had made his salutations and taken tea, he began his harangue. “I come at the command of my master, the Marquis of Wu, to persuade you to a wise course. From of old it has always been recognized that the hero must bow to circumstances. The region with its nine territories and forty-one counties that you ruled have come under another, with the exception of this single city. Within, there is no food, without, no help, so that it must fall quickly. Wherefore, O General, why not hear me and join your fortunes to those of Wu? You shall be restored to your governorship, and you will preserve your family. If haply, Sir, you would reflect thereon.” Guan Yu replied, quite calmly, “I am a simple soldier from the village of Jieliang. I am the 'hands and feet' of my lord. How can I betray him? The city may fall, and then I can but die. Jade may be shattered, but its whiteness remains; bamboo may be burned, but its joints stand straight. My body may be broken, but my fame shall live in history. Say no more, but leave the city, I beg. I will fight Sun Quan to the death.” “My master desires to enter into such a league with you as did Jin and Qin in former days, that you may mutually assist to destroy Cao Cao and restore the Hans. That is his idea, and why do you persist in this wrong course?” As Zhuge Jin finished this speech, Guan Ping, who was by, drew his sword to slay him. But his father checked him. “Remember his brother is in Shu, helping your uncle. If you hurt him, you will injure the principle of fraternity.” Guan Yu then bade his servants lead Zhuge Jin away. Zhuge Jin went, his face covered with shame, and left the city. When he reached his master, he told of Guan Yu's obduracy and rejection of all argument. “He is indeed a loyal servant!” said Sun Quan. “Still, what is to be done next?” “Take some casts in the Book of Changes,” said Lu Fan. So the lots were taken and explained to mean that the Marquis' enemies should flee to a distance. Then Sun Quan asked Lu Meng, saying, “If he flies to a distance, how can he be captured?” “The divination exactly fits in with my schemes;” replied Lu Meng, “and though Guan Yu had wings to soar to the skies, he would not escape my net.” The dragon in a puddle is the sport of shrimps,"

It turned out that the clouds were dark and dark during the third watch, and it was Kongming's method of dangling the armor; after the troops were withdrawn, the sky was clear again, and it was Kongming who drove the Liuding and Liujia to sweep away the floating clouds.","Kong Ming is not fooled for a moment, and on pain of death Zheng Wen is told to write a fake letter to Sima Yi claiming that, if Sima Yi himself will lead the raiding-party attack on the camp, he can capture Kong Ming.","After the third watch the sky cleared. Zhuge Liang from the hill-top sounded the gong of retreat. This obscurity in the third watch was due to an incantation called “Concealing Method.” The sky became clear, because Zhuge Liang performed another incantation to have the Deities of Six Layers sweep away the few floating clouds that still persisted."

Hidden weapons in the ship. Zhou Shan took orders and came by the Jingzhou waterway. The boat moored by the river, Shanzi entered Jingzhou, and ordered the clerk to report to Mrs. Sun. The wife ordered Zhou Shan to enter. Kindly submit the secret book. Seeing that Guotai was in critical condition, the lady shed tears and asked. Zhou Shanbai complained: ""The country is too sick and I just miss my wife. If I go too late, I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you. I will teach my wife to bring A Dou to meet me."" If you want to return, you must have someone inform the military advisor, and then you can do it."" Zhou Shan said, ""If the military advisor replied: 'You must report to the emperor, and wait for your order before you can disembark', what should you do?"" Madam said: "" If you leave without saying goodbye, there may be obstacles."" Zhou Shan said, ""In the middle of the river, the boat is ready to be disembarked. Just now, I will ask my wife to get on the bus and leave the city."" Madam Sun heard that her mother was critically ill, how could she not panic? He then hid the seven-year-old boy, Adou, in the car. He accompanied more than 30 people, each with a sword, mounted his horse and left Jingzhou City, and then came to the river and boarded the boat. When the people in the mansion wanted to report the time, Mrs. Sun had already arrived in Shatou Town and was in the middle of the boat.","It is easy for Zhao Shan and his men to slip into Jingzhou disguised as traders. He quietly makes his way to Lady Sun and presents the fake letter to her. Reading the letter, Lady Sun bursts into tears, and Zhao Shan, seeing his advantage, says how desperate the queen mother is to see her daughter and her grandson. But Lady Sun resists, saying that, as Xuande is away, she must seek permission from Kong Ming as her lord’s representative. To this Zhao Shan replies that there is no time to waste and urges her to depart now before they can be stopped. Confused by this distressing news, Lady Sun decides to act without delay. Collecting seven-year-old Ah Dou, Xuande’s son, she is soon in her carriage and heading for the river and the boats waiting to carry her to the south.","It was decided that Zhou Shan should take with him about five hundred soldiers disguised as ordinary traders. He had five vessels and distributed his men among them, while weapons were hidden in the holds. Papers were was forged to look like veritable authority in case they were asked. Zhou Shan set out along the river route for the city of Jingzhou and was not long on the way. He anchored his ships under the bank, landed, and went into the city to the residence, where he bade the doorkeepers announce him. He was admitted and led into the presence of Lady Sun and presently gave her the secret letter. When she read that her mother was in danger of death, she began to weep bitterly and questioned the messenger closely. Zhou Shan invented a story, saying, “The Dowager Marchioness is really fretting for a sight of yours; and if you do not go quickly, it will be too late. The Dowager Marchioness also wants to see little Liu Shan once before she dies.” Lady Sun replied, “You know that the Imperial Uncle is far away on military service, and I ought to inform the chief of the army before returning home.” “But what will you do if the chief says he must inform your husband and await his consent?” said Zhou Shan. “If I went without asking permission—but I fear that is impossible.” “My ships are all ready in the river, and you have only to drive through the city,” said Zhou Shan. Naturally the news of her mother's illness greatly disturbed the young wife. In a short time her carriage was ready, and she mounted, taking Liu Shan with her. She took an escort of thirty guards, all armed, and was soon at the river side and had embarked before the palace people could report what she was doing."

He said, ""The Duke of Wei, Prime Minister Cao, has long heard of Shengde, and a special envoy sent a golden armor as a letter. There is also a secret book."" Song was overjoyed and read the words in the secret book, He said, ""Follow Duke Wei, but don't worry. Someone has a good plan to report."" After sending someone to come back first, he went to see Zhang Lu overnight, saying that Pang De had been bribed by Cao Cao and sold it for a while. Zhang Lu was furious and called Pang De to scold him and wanted to kill him. Yan Pu bitterly admonished. Zhang Lu said: ""If you come to Japan to fight, you will be killed if you don't win!"" Pang De retreated in resentment. The next day, Cao's troops attacked the city, and Pang De led his troops out. He ordered Xu Chu to fight. Chu cheated and defeated, Pound came. Cao Cao rode his horse up the hillside and called out, ""Why didn't Pang Lingming come down earlier?"" Pang De thought, ""Take Cao Cao and reach a thousand generals!"" Then he flew to the hillside. With a shout, the sky collapsed, and even the man and the horse fell into the pit; the hooks and ropes from the four walls stepped forward together, captured Pang De alive, and escorted him up the slope. Cao Cao dismounted, scolded the sergeant, released his bondage, and asked Pang Deken if he would surrender. Pang De thought about Zhang Lu's inhumaneness, and was willing to surrender. Cao Cao personally helped him mount the horse, and returned to Dazhai together, deliberately teaching the city to see him. People report Zhang Lu, and virtue and Cao go hand in hand. Lu Yixin believed Yang Song's words were true.","As Pang De enters the city, the spy slides in behind him and makes his way to Yang Song’s house. Here, he gives the traitor the gold breastplate and a letter proposing that when the time is right Yang Song should have the gates thrown open and let the enemy in. Yang Song agrees and starts to spread rumours that Pang De has lost control of the enemy camp because he has been bribed by Cao Cao. Summoning Pang De, Zhang Lu rails at him and would have him executed there and then but for others interceding on his behalf. Deeply offended, upset and angry, Pang De withdraws to his own quarters. The next day Xu Chu challenges Pang De and, at a crucial moment, turns and flees, leading Pang De on. Just as Pang De is thinking that he might even manage to capture Cao Cao, his horse plunges into a pit, and horse and rider are captured. When he is brought before Cao Cao, he is treated with the utmost respect, and when asked if he will surrender, he thinks back to Zhang Lu’s anger with him, his false accusations and how near he came to being executed. It doesn’t take him long to decide to accept Cao Cao’s offer. And just to make sure Zhang Lu really does believe that Pang De betrayed him earlier, Cao Cao rides with Pang De in front of the city walls to show Zhang Lu how hopeless his cause now is.","He made his way quickly to Yang Song's residence and saw him. He told Yang Song, saying, “The Great Prime Minister, Duke of Wei, knows you by reputation and holds you in great esteem. And as a token thereof he has sent you his golden breastplate and a confidential letter as well.” Yang Song took it all in, read the letter, and said, “I will reply by and by, and the Duke of Wei needs feel no anxiety for I shall find a means of proving my gratitude. You may return.” Soon after, Yang Song went to see Zhang Lu and told him, saying, “Pang De has been defeated because he has been bribed by Cao Cao.” Forthwith Zhang Lu summoned his general, abused him, and threatened to put him to death. Yan Pu, however, protested and proposed to test Pang De in another encounter. Zhang Lu then said, “Tomorrow, if you lose, I will take your head!” Pang De retired full of resentment. The next day Cao Cao attacked, and Pang De went out to repel him. Cao Cao sent out Xu Chu, but bade him pretend defeat. When Pang De pursued, Cao Cao rode toward the hills, where he halted and presently got speech with Pang De, calling out, “Pang De! Why not surrender?” But Pang De thought within himself that to capture Cao Cao would be a fine exploit, so he boldly faced his escort and rode up the hills. But there arose a great shouting as if heaven and earth were clashing together, and he and his followers went headlong into ditches and pits that had been dug. Out flew Cao Cao's troops with ropes and hooks, and Pang De was a prisoner. When he was taken to Cao Cao, he was received with the greatest kindness. Cao Cao himself dismounted, loosed the captive's bonds, and asked him, “Do you surrender?” Pang De thought of the ill-treatment he had just received at the hands of his master and of his injustice, and gave in. At once Pang De was helped to mount a horse by Cao Cao himself and led to the great camp. Soldiers placed for the purpose on the city wall saw what happened and reported to Zhang Lu: “Pang De has ridden off on friendly terms with Cao Cao.” Whereby Zhang Lu was persuaded that Yang Song had spoken truly."

Ding Yi scolded: 'The former king I originally wanted to make my lord the heir, but was hindered by the slanderous ministers; now that the king is not far away, he asks the sin of the flesh and blood, why?' Ding Yu also said: 'According to my lord's wisdom to crown the world, I should inherit the throne from now on. I can't stand. You are the minister of the temple, why don't you know the talent like this!'

He is buried with due honour. The other is Cao Zhi, lord of Linzi, who with two well-known writers and drinkers – brothers by the name of Ding – is often drunk, even early in the morning.","Soon after the accession, Hua Xin memorialized the Prince of Wu, saying, “The Lord of Yanling has cut himself loose from his army and gone quietly to his post, but your other two brothers did not attend the funeral of their father. Their conduct should be inquired into and punished.” Cao Pi took up the suggestion and sent commissioners to each. They who were sent to the younger quickly returned to report: “Cao Xiong, the Lord of Xiaohuai, had hanged himself rather than suffer for his fault.” Cao Pi ordered honorable burial for Cao Xiong and gave him the posthumous title of Prince of Xiaohuai. Soon after, the envoy to Linzi returned to report: “The Lord of Linzi, Cao Zhi, is spending his time in dissipation, his especial boon companions being two brothers named Ding Zhengli and Ding Jingli. They were very rude. When we presented ourselves, Cao Zhi sat bolt upright, but would not say a word. Ding Zhengli used insulting words, saying, 'King Cao intended our lord to succeed, but was turned there from by the slanderous tongues of certain among you. As soon as he is dead, your master begins to think of punishment for his own flesh and blood.' “The other brother Ding Jingli said, 'In intellect our lord leads the age, and he ought to have been heir to his father. Now, not only does he not succeed, but he is treated in this harsh way by a lot of courtiers of your sort, ignorant of what genius means.' “And then Cao Zhi, in a fit of anger, had ordered his lictors to beat the chief envoy and turn him out.”"

Jiang Wei selected two Sichuan generals in Hanzhong, and trained them every day: one was Jiang Shu and the other was Fu Yan. The two are quite brave and love them very much. Suddenly, it was reported that Zhuge Dan in Huainan raised an army to attack Sima Zhao, and Sun Zhen of the Eastern Wu Dynasty helped him, Zhao Da raised the soldiers of the two Huai Rivers, and sent the Empress Dowager Wei and the Lord Wei together. Wei was overjoyed and said, ""I have done a great job today!"" Then he expressed his wish to send troops to attack Wei. After hearing about it, Qiao Zhou sighed and said: ""Recently, the imperial court has been addicted to wine, trusting the noble Huang Hao, ignoring the affairs of the state, only for joy; Bo Joo is tired of conquering, but does not care about the sergeants: the country will be in danger!""

The adviser Qiao Zhou even writes a formal essay to the second ruler condemning such actions as a sign of a weak kingdom lacking in wisdom.","At this time in Shu, the reign style was changed from Long Enjoyment, the twentieth year, to Wonderful Sight, the first year (AD 258). In Hanzhong Jiang Wei had recruited two generals, Fu Qian and Jiang Shu, both of whom he loved greatly, and set them to train the army, horse and foot. Then came the news: “Zhuge Dan has set out to destroy Sima Zhao; Sun Chen of Wu has supported him with a large army; and Sima Zhao has led the army himself, bringing with him the Empress Dowager and the Ruler of Wei.” Jiang Wei said, “The great opportunity has come at last.” So he asked the Latter Ruler's authority to make another expedition. But Qiao Zhou heard this with grief, for internal affairs were not well. Said he, “The court is sunk in dissipation, and the Emperor's confidence is given to that eunuch, Huang Hao; state affairs are neglected for pleasure, which is the Emperor's sole aim. Jiang Wei has led many expeditions and wasted the lives of many soldiers, so that the state is falling.” Qiao Zhou then wrote an essay on “Enemy Kingdoms,” which he sent to Jiang Wei. “When one asks by what means the weak overcame the strong in past times, the answer is that those responsible"

Chu was ordered to lead the army to Linzi City. The guards blocked him, Chu Li cut him, and went straight into the city. No one dared to be sharp and went straight to the palace. I saw that Cao Zhi, Ding Yi, Ding Yu and others were all drunk. Chu all tied him, loaded him in the car, and sent all the officials of the mansion, large and small, to take them out of Ye County and wait for Cao Pi's release.

At this time Gan Ning had been suffering from dysentery, and was suffering from symptoms.","Sun Quan is devastated by the news of these defeats, and it is Zhang Zhao who suggests how they should now respond, recommending certain key commanders for various roles, and with an army of one hundred thousand they advance to confront Xuande.","So he called a great council, and he said, “Sun Huan is besieged in Yiling, and Zhu Ran has been defeated on the river; what can be done?” Then Zhang Zhao said, “Though several of your commanders are dead, yet have you some left. Half a score is enough to relieve your anxiety. Send Han Dang as Commander, with Zhou Tai as his second, Pan Zhang as Van Leader, Ling Tong as Rear Guard; Gan Ning in reserve. You want one hundred thousand troops.” Sun Quan made the appointments as proposed. Gan Ning was very seriously ill just then, but he accepted the task."

蠻兵探知，來報孟獲曰：“蜀兵不染瘴疫之氣，又無枯渴之患，諸泉皆不應。”朶思大王聞知不信，自與孟獲來高山望之。只見蜀兵安然無事，大桶小擔，搬運水漿，飲馬造飯。朶思見之，毛髮聳然，回顧孟獲曰：“此乃神兵也！”獲曰：“吾兄弟二人與蜀兵決一死戰，就殞於軍前，安肯束手受縛！”朶思曰：“若大王兵敗，吾妻子亦休矣。當殺牛宰馬，大賞洞丁，不避水火，直衝蜀寨，方可得勝。”,"When the barbarians found out, they came to report to Meng Huo, saying: ""The soldiers of Shu are not infected with the miasma, and there is no danger of thirst and thirst. The springs should not be used."" King Duosi heard this and did not believe it, so he and Meng Huo came to the mountains to look at him. I saw that the Shu soldiers were safe and sound, carrying large buckets and small burdens, carrying water slurry, and drinking horses to make rice. When Duo Si saw it, his hair rose, and he looked back at Meng Huo and said, ""This is a divine soldier!"" Huo said, ""My two brothers will fight to the death with the soldiers of Shu, and they will die in front of the army, and An Ken will be bound!"" Duo Si said : ""If the king is defeated, my wife will also rest. When you kill the cows and horses, appreciate the caves, do not avoid water and fire, and go straight to the village of Shu, then you will be victorious.""","When news of the successful invasion comes to Meng Huo and King Duosi, they cannot believe their ears and go to see for themselves. ‘These are deities, not humans!’ says Duosi. But they all agree they have no option but to attack and fight to the end.","When Meng Huo heard the news, he was greatly taken aback. “These troops do not appear to have suffered either thirst or fever,” said he. “Our springs have lost their power.” King Duo Si heard it, but doubted. He and Meng Huo ascended into a high hill whence they could see their enemies. They saw no signs of illness or distress; all went on calmly and quietly in the camps, water carrying and cooking, eating and attending to the cattle. Duo Si's hair stood on end as he looked at them. “These are not human soldiers,” said he, shivering. “They must be sent from Heaven.” “Our two brothers will fight one fierce battle with these troops of Shu and die therein,” said Meng Huo, “We cannot wait calmly to be put into bonds.” “But, O King, if your army should be beaten, my whole family will also perish. Let us encourage the people of the ravines. Let us kill bullocks and slaughter horses to feed them, and urge them to go through fire and water to rush right up to the camp of the enemy and seize upon victory.”"

華歆入奏曰：“大王知有神醫華佗否？”操曰：“卽江東醫周泰者乎？”歆曰：“是也。”操曰：“雖聞其名，未知其術。”歆曰：“華佗字元化：沛國譙郡人也。其醫術之妙，世所罕有：但有患者，或用藥，或用鍼，或用灸，隨手而愈。若患五臟六腑之疾，藥不能效者，以麻肺湯飲之，令病者如醉死，却用尖刀剖開其腹，以藥湯洗其臟腑，病人略無疼痛。洗畢，然後以藥線縫口，用藥敷之。或一月，或二十日，卽平復矣。其神妙如此。一日，佗行於道上，聞一人呻吟之聲。佗曰：‘此飲食不下之病。’問之果然。佗令取蒜虀汁三升飲之，吐蛇一條，長二三尺，飲食卽下。廣陵太守陳登，心中煩懣，面赤，不能飲食，求佗醫治。佗以藥飲之，吐蟲三升，皆赤頭，首尾動搖。登問其故。佗曰：‘此因多食魚腥，故有此毒。今日雖愈，三年之後，必將復發，不可救也。’後陳登果三年而死。又有一人眉間生一瘤，癢不可當，令佗視之。佗曰：‘內有飛物。’人皆笑之。佗以刀割開，一黃雀飛去，病者卽愈。有一人被犬咬足指，隨長肉二塊，一痛一癢，俱不可忍。佗曰：‘痛者內有針十個，癢者內有黑白棋子二枚。’人皆不信，佗以刀割開，果應其言。此人眞扁鵲、倉公之流也。見居金城，離此不遠，大王何不召之？”,"Hua Xin entered the memorial and said, ""Does your Majesty know that there is a divine doctor Hua Tuo?"" Cao said, ""Is there a doctor from Zhou Tai in the east of the Jiang River?"" Xin said, ""Yes."" Xin said: ""Hua Tuo's character is metamorphosed: he is also a native of Qiaojun, Peiguo. His medical skills are rare in the world: but there are patients who are cured by taking medicine, acupuncture, or moxibustion. , If the medicine is not effective, drink it with Mafei Decoction, which will make the patient feel drunk to death, but open the abdomen with a sharp knife, wash the internal organs with the medicinal soup, and the patient has no pain. Apply medicine on it. Or one month, or twenty days, you will be calmed down. It is so wonderful. One day, Tuo walked on the road, and heard the sound of a moan. Tuo said: 'This disease is not enough to eat.' Asked it and sure enough. Tuo ordered to take three liters of garlic juice and drink it, spit out a snake, two or three feet long, and eat and drink. Three liters, all of them were bareheaded, their heads and tails swayed. Deng asked why. Tuo said: 'This is because I eat a lot of fishy fish, so it has this poison. Although it is cured today, three years later, it will definitely relapse, which is irreversible.' Hou Chen Dengguo San He died at the age of 20. Another person had a tumor between his eyebrows, which was unbearably itchy, and made Tuo look at him. Tuo said: 'There are flying objects inside.' Everyone laughed at it. He recovered. One person was bitten by a dog on his toe, and two pieces of flesh grew along with it. One pain and one itch were unbearable. Tuo said: 'There are ten needles in the pain, and two black and white chess pieces in the itchy.' If you don’t believe me, I cut it open with a knife, and it’s what I said. This person is really like Bian Que and Cang Gong. Seeing that he lives in Jincheng, it’s not far from here, why didn’t the king call him?”","Eventually, Hua Xin suggests calling in the famous doctor Hua Tuo, who cured Zhou Tai.","Hua Xin one day said to his master, “My lord, have you heard of Hua Tuo?” “Do you mean him of Qiao who cured Zhou Tai?” “Yes; that is he,” replied Hua Xin. “I have heard something of his fame, but I know nothing of his capabilities in his art.” “He is very clever; there are few so skillful. If one is ill and calls him in, he knows immediately whether to use drugs, or the needle, or the cutlery, and the patient finds relief at once. Let one suffer from an internal complaint and drugs are ineffectual, with a dose of hashish he throws the patient into a state of perfect insensibility and then opens the abdomen and washes the affected organs with a medicament. The patient feels no pain. When the cleansing is complete, he sews up the wound with thread, dresses it, and in a month or less the patient is well. This shows you how skillful he is. “One day Hua Tuo was traveling, when he heard a man by the wayside groaning with pain. ' That is dyspepsia,' said Hua Tuo. And further questions confirmed the diagnosis. He prescribed long draughts of the juice of garlic as an emetic, and the man vomited a worm; after this the man was quite well. “Chen Deng, the Governor of Guangling, suffered from a heavy feeling at the heart. His face was red and congested, and he had no appetite. Hua Tuo gave him a drug, and he threw up many internal wriggling parasites with red heads. The Governor asked what had caused the trouble, and Hua Tuo told him that he ate too much strong smelling fish. He could cure Chen Deng this once, but in three years the disease would recur, and then nothing could save him. Three later Chen Deng died. “Another man had a tumor between the eyes, and it itched intolerably. Hua Tuo examined it and said there was a bird in it. The tumor was opened, and, surely enough, a canary flew out. The patient was relieved. “A dog bit a man's toe, and two tumorous growths ensued, one of which itched intolerably and the other pained severely. Hua Tuo said the painful one contained ten needles, and the other a couple of chess pips, black and white. He opened the two swellings, and the contents were as he had said. Really he is of the same class of physician as masters Bian Que and Zang Kong of old times. He lives at Jincheng, not far away, and could be here very soon.”"

却說徐晃逃回見操，說王平反去降劉備矣。操大怒，親統大軍來奪漢水寨柵。趙雲恐孤軍難立，遂退於漢水之西。兩軍隔水相拒。玄德與孔明來觀形勢。孔明見漢水上流頭，有一帶土山，可伏千餘人；乃回到營中，喚趙雲分付：“汝可引五百人，皆帶鼓角，伏於土山之下；或半夜，或黃昏，只聽我營中礮響：礮響一番，擂鼓一番——只不要出戰。”子龍受計去了。孔明却在高山上暗窺。次日，曹兵到來搦戰，蜀營中一人不出，弓弩亦都不發。曹兵自回。當夜更深，孔明見曹營燈火方息，軍士歇定，遂放號礮。子龍聽得，令鼓角齊鳴。曹兵驚慌，只疑劫寨。及至出營，不見一軍。方纔回營欲歇，號礮又響，鼓角又鳴，吶喊震地，山谷應聲。曹兵徹夜不安。一連三夜，如此驚疑，操心怯，拔寨退三十里，就空闊處紮營。孔明笑曰：“曹操雖知兵法，不知詭計。”遂請玄德親渡漢水，背水結營。玄德問計，孔明曰：“可如此如此。”,"But they said that Xu Huang had fled back to see Cao, and that Wang Ping had gone to surrender to Liu Bei. Cao was furious and led the army to seize the Hanshui Zhaizhai. Zhao Yun feared that it would be difficult to stand alone, so he retreated to the west of the Han River. The two armies rejected each other. Xuande and Kong Ming came to see the situation. Kongming saw that there was an earth mountain at the top of the Han River, where more than a thousand people could be placed under it; he returned to the camp and called Zhao Yun to pay: ""You can lead five hundred people, all with drum horns, and place them under the earth mountain; or at midnight, or In the evening, I can only hear the sound of the bells in my camp: the bells are ringing, the drums are beating—just don’t go out to battle.” Zilong went away. Kong Ming peeped secretly on the mountain. The next day, Cao's soldiers came to fight, but no one in the Shu camp did not go out, and neither bows nor crossbows were fired. Cao Bing returned. Later that night, Kong Ming saw that the lights in Cao's camp were dying, and the soldiers rested, so they released their horns. Zilong heard it and made the drum horns chirp in unison. Cao Bing panicked and only suspected that the village would be robbed. When they left the camp, there was no army in sight. Just now returning to the camp and wanting to rest, the horn sounded again, the drum horns sounded again, the screams shook the ground, and the valley responded. Cao Bing was restless all night. For three nights in a row, he was so alarmed and worried, he retreated thirty li from the fortress, and camped in the empty space. Kong Ming laughed and said, ""Although Cao Cao knows the art of war, he doesn't know any tricks."" So he asked Xuande to cross the Han River in person, and set up a camp with his back. Xuande asked about the plan, and Kong Ming said, ""That's how it is.""","That night, after setting fire to the camp, which forces Xu Huang to panic and desert the camp, Wang Ping crosses the river and surrenders to Zhao Zilong. Deeply angered by this betrayal, Cao Cao leads the advance to the bank of the river on the east side, where he faces off against Zhao Zilong on the west. Deadlock ensues, until Kong Ming takes things into his own hands. He sends Zilong with five hundred men to a secluded hillside beyond the enemy camp. He tells Zilong that when a given signal sounds, he is to get his men to make as much warlike, threatening noise as possible. Then Kong Ming watches as one by one the lights go out in the enemy camp opposite. Then, when all is quiet, he gives the signal, and over on the hillside Zilong’s men set up a tremendous ruckus – banging war drums, blowing horns, shouting. Cao Cao’s men leap up from their sleep, convinced they are about to be overwhelmed by the enemy – only to find no one there. This happens again the next night and the night after. Every night the sleep of Cao Cao’s men is disrupted. By the third night the Wei troops are utterly exhausted and completely on edge – even Cao Cao – and so the next day they retreat from the riverbank. On Kong Ming’s advice, Xuande crosses the river and sets up camp with the river behind his men’s backs.","Xu Huang reported Wang Ping's defection, which made Cao Cao very angry. Cao Cao placed himself at the head of a force and tried to retake the bank of the river. Zhao Yun, thinking his troops too few, retired to the west side, and the two armies lay on opposite sides of the stream. Liu Bei and his adviser came down to view the position. Zhuge Liang saw in the upper course of the stream a hill which might well screen a thousand soldiers, so he returned to camp, called in Zhao Yun and said, “General, you lead five hundred troops, with drums and horns, and place them in ambush behind the hill, to await certain orders which will come some time during the night or at dawn. When you hear a detonation, you are not to appear, only give a long roll of the drums at every report.” Zhao Yun departed to play his part in the drama, while Zhuge Liang went to a hill whence he could overlook the scene. When next the army of Cao Cao approached the camp of Shu and offered battle, not a man came out, nor was an arrow or a bolt shot. They retired without any result. But in the depths of the night, when all the lights in the camp were extinguished and all appeared tranquil and restful, Zhuge Liang exploded a bomb, and at once Zhao Yun beat his drums and blared his trumpets. Cao Cao's soldiers awoke in alarm, thinking it was a night raid. They rushed out, but there was no enemy, and as the hubbub ceased they went back to sleep. Soon after there was another bomb, and again the drums and the trumpets seeming to shake the earth itself, and the fearsome roar echoing along the valleys and from the hills again scared Cao Cao's soldiers. Thus the night passed in constant alarms. The next night was the same, and the next. On the fourth day Cao Cao broke up his camp, marched his troops ten miles to the rear and pitched his camp in a clear, wide space among the hills. Zhuge Liang was pleased at the result of his ruse. Said he, smiling, “ Cao Cao is skilled in war, but still he is not proof against all deceitful tricks.” The troops of Shu then crossed the river and camped with the stream behind them. When Liu Bei asked the next move, he was told, but also told to keep the plan a secret."

却說謝雄引軍前行，正遇王雙；戰不三合，被雙一刀劈死。蜀兵敗走。雙隨後趕來。龔起接着，交馬只三合，亦被雙所斬。敗兵回報孔明。孔明大驚，忙令廖化、王平、張嶷三人出迎。兩陣對圓，張嶷出馬。王平、廖化壓住陣角。王雙縱馬，來與張嶷交馬，數合不分勝負。雙詐敗便走，嶷隨後趕去，王平見張嶷中計，忙叫曰：“休趕！”嶷急回馬時，王雙流星鎚早到，正中其背。嶷伏鞍而走，雙回馬趕來。王平、廖化截住，救得張嶷回陣。王雙驅兵大殺一陣，蜀兵折傷甚多。嶷吐血幾口，回見孔明，說：“王雙英雄無敵；如今將二萬兵就陳倉城外下寨，四圍立起排柵，築起重城，深挑壕塹，守禦甚嚴。”孔明見折二將，張嶷又被打傷，卽喚姜維曰：“陳倉道口這條路不可行。別有何策？”維曰：“陳倉城池堅固，郝昭守禦甚密；又得王雙相助，實不可取。不若令一大將，依山傍水，下寨固守；再令良將守把要道，以防街亭之攻；却統大軍去襲祁山，某却如此如此用計，可捉曹眞也。”孔明從其言，卽令王平、李恢，引二枝兵守街亭小路；魏延引一軍守陳倉口。馬岱為先鋒，關興、張苞為前後救應使，從小徑出斜谷望祁山進發。,"But he said that Xie Xiong led the army forward and met Wang Shuang; The Shu soldiers were defeated. Double came later. Gong Qi followed, and the horses were only three-joined, and they were also beheaded by both. The defeated soldiers returned to Kongming. Kong Ming was startled, and hurriedly ordered Liao Hua, Wang Ping, and Zhang Yi to go out to greet him. When the two formations faced each other, Zhang Yi stepped forward. Wang Ping and Liao Hua suppressed the corners of the formation. Wang Shuang rode his horse and came to cross his horse with Zhang Yi. Shuangxiao was defeated and left, and Yi rushed after him. Wang Ping saw that Zhang Yi was in the game, and hurriedly shouted, ""Hurry up!"" Yi walked away in the saddle, and came back on horseback. Wang Ping and Liao Hua intercepted and saved Zhang Yi back to the formation. Wang Shuang drove his troops to kill for a while, and the Shu soldiers suffered many injuries. He vomited a few mouthfuls of blood, and when he returned to see Kongming, he said, ""Wang Shuang is an invincible hero; now, 20,000 soldiers have been deployed outside the city of Chencang, and barricades have been erected around them, and a heavy city has been built. Kong Ming saw that the two generals had been destroyed, and Zhang Yi was injured again. He called Jiang Wei and said, ""The road at the crossing of Chencang Road is not feasible. What else can you do?"" It is not advisable for both sides to help each other. It is not advisable to order a large general to stand by the mountains and rivers, and stick to the village; then order a good general to guard the main road to prevent the attack of Jieting; If you use a trick, you can catch Cao Zhen."" Kong Ming followed his words and ordered Wang Ping and Li Hui to lead two soldiers to guard the Jieting Road; Wei Yan led an army to guard Chencangkou. Ma Dai was the vanguard, Guan Xing and Zhang Bao were the rescuers, and they set off from the trail to the sloping valley to look at the Qishan Mountains.","Soon after, news comes of the Wei vanguard, commanded by the giant Wang Shuang, approaching, and Kong Ming sends troops to counter him. Wang Shuang, on encountering the Shu army, slays the commander, causing the Shu troops to panic and flee. The demoralizing effect of this defeat on the Shu army is considerable, leading to desertions and leaving Kong Ming in serious trouble. Advised by his commanders and especially Jiang Wei that they need to create a diversion in order to trap Cao Zhen and defeat the mighty Wang Shuang, Kong Ming agrees, and the army divides.","The first body sent against Wang Shuang had no success; Xie Xiong fell almost immediately under Wang Shuang's great sword. The men fled and Wang Shuang pursued, and so came upon Gong Qi, who had come to support his colleague. Gong Qi met a similar fate, being slain in the third bout. When the defeated parties returned, Zhuge Liang was anxious and called up Liao Hua, Wang Ping, and Zhang Ni to go out to check this Wang Shuang, They went and drew up in formal array, and then Zhang Ni rode to the front. Wang Shuang rode to meet him, and they two fought several bouts. Then Wang Shuang ran away and Zhang Ni followed. His colleague, Wang Ping, suspected this flight was but a ruse, so he called to Zhang Ni, “Do not follow the fleeing general!” Wang Shuang then turned and hurled one of his meteor hammers, which hit Zhang Ni in the back, so that he fell forward and lay over the saddle. Wang Shuang rode on to follow up this advantage, but Liao Hua and Wang Ping poured out and checked him. Wang Shuang's whole force then came on and slew many of the troops of Shu. Zhang Ni was hurt internally and vomited blood at times. He came back and told Zhuge Liang, saying, “Wang Shuang is very terrible and no one can stand up to him. Beside there is a strong camp at the city with double walls and a deep moat.” Having lost two generals, and a third being wounded, Zhuge Liang called up Jiang Wei and said, “We are stopped this way; can you suggest another road?” “Yes,” said Jiang Wei, “Chencang is too well protected and, with Hao Zhao as defender and Wang Shuang as supporter, cannot be taken. I would propose to move away to some suitable place and make a strong camp. Then try to hold the roads so that the attack on Jieting may be prevented. Then if you will send a strong force against Qishan, I can do something which will capture Cao Zhen.” Zhuge Liang agreed. He sent Wang Ping and Li Hui to hold the narrow road to Jieting, and Wei Yan was sent to guard the way from Chencang. And then the army marched out of the Xie Valley by a small road and made for Qishan."

Song Zisi said: ""I originally wanted to offer Xichuan Prefecture and Cao Cao, but who would want to be so slow! When I came, I opened my mouth before Liu Zhang, and I came back empty-handed today, and I must be laughed at by the people of Shu. I heard that Liu Xuande of Jingzhou The benevolence and righteousness have been spread for a long time, it is better to go back that way. Let’s see how this person is, I have my own opinion.” So he rode his horse and led his servants to look over the border of Jingzhou. When they arrived at the boundary of Yingzhou, they suddenly saw a group of military horses, about five hundred cavalry, headed by a general, dressed in light makeup, before restraining the horse and asking, ""Is it possible that the person who came here is saying goodbye?"" Song said, """" Of course."" The general hurriedly dismounted from the horse and said in a loud voice, ""Zhao Yun has been waiting for a long time."" Panasonic dismounted from the horse and replied to the salute, ""Don't you think Zhao Zilong is very handsome?"" Yun said, ""Of course. A certain one was ordered by the lord Liu Xuande to serve as a doctor. On the road, I galloped on a saddle horse, and specially ordered Zhao Yun to talk about wine and food."" After speaking, the sergeant knelt down and served wine and food, and Yun Jing entered. Song said to himself, ""People say that Liu Xuande is merciful and caring for his guests, but this is the case."" So he and Zhao Yun drank a few cups and went on horseback. When I came to Jieshou, Jingzhou, it was night and day. I went to the station and saw more than 100 people standing outside the door of the station, beating drums. First, he bowed in front of the horse and said, ""According to the order of the elder brother, I will travel far and wide for the doctor, and I will order Guan to sweep the post court and wait for the rest."" After a while, the wine feast was lined up, and the two diligently persuaded each other. After drinking until the last night, Fang Shi stopped and stayed overnight.","Imagine his surprise and delight, then, when, as he and his escort cross the border into Xuande’s lands, he is greeted by Zhao Zilong and an official escort of five hundred cavalrymen, sent to bring him with all due honour to Xuande’s city of Jingzhou. When he reaches his hotel, he is even more delighted to find a hundred men lined up to greet him. Guan Yu himself comes to formally welcome him and has ordered a banquet to honour him. The next day Zhang Song and Guan Yu ride to meet Xuande, who, when he and Kong Ming and Pang Tong see Zhang approaching, dismounts to greet him properly.","He returned to his lodging and left the city that night, reflecting upon what he had intended and what he had accomplished. Thought he, “I did not expect such arrogance when I came with the intention of giving him a region. When I get back, Liu Zhang will expect great things. Now I am returning empty handed and a failure to endure the laughter of my fellow country people. I will not go back. I have heard of the virtues of Liu Bei, and I will go to him and see what manner of man he is. Then I can decide what to do.” So with his little escort and following he made for Jingzhou. He had reached the boundaries of Wuchang when he met a body of horsemen, at the head of whom rode a general in simple undress, who pulled up, saying, “Surely you are the Charioteer Zhang Song.” “I am he,” said Zhang Song. The general quickly dismounted and humbly said, “I have expected you these many days. I am Zhao Yun.” Zhang Song dismounted and returned the salutation, saying, “Then you are no other than the Fine Man of Changshan.” “No other,” was the reply. “And my lord Liu Bei bade me await you here and offer you refreshment after your long and toilsome journey.” At this some soldiers brought forward wine and food which they offered kneeling. Zhang Song said, “I am come because the world says Liu Bei is liberal and kindly disposed.” After a few cups of wine, the two retook the road toward Jingzhou City, which they neared next day at evening. They went to the guest-house. Here they found a large number of people who received the visitor with the beating of drums and every sign of respect. And the officer in command, bowing low, said, “My brother sent me to meet you after your long and dusty journey and prepare the guest-house for your reception. My name is Guan Yu.” So Zhang Song and Zhao Yun dismounted and entered the guest-house, where hosts and guest exchanged formal salutations and took their seats. In a short time refreshments were served, and both men were most diligent in their attention to the traveler. This roadside banquet was prolonged to the time of setting the watch, when they prepared for rest."
却說先主在御營尋思破吳之計，忽見帳前中軍旗旛，無風自倒。乃問程畿曰：“此為何兆？”畿曰：“今夜莫非吳兵來劫營？”先主曰：“昨夜殺盡，安敢再來？”畿曰：“倘是陸遜試敵，奈何？”正言間，人報山上遠遠望見吳兵盡沿山望東去了。先主曰：“此是疑兵。”令衆休動，命關興、張苞各引五百騎出巡。黃昏時分，關興回奏曰：“江北營中火起。”先主急令關興往江北，張苞往江南，探看虛實：“倘吳兵到時，可急回報。”,"However, it was said that the First Sovereign was in the imperial camp trying to think of Wu's plan, and suddenly he saw the flag of the army in front of the tent, and he fell down without wind. He asked Cheng Ji, ""What is the sign of this?"" Ji said, ""Could it be that Wu soldiers came to rob the camp tonight?"" What?"" In the middle of the sentence, Renbao saw Wu Bing from a distance on the mountain, looking eastward along the mountain. The First Sovereign said, ""This is a suspicious soldier."" He ordered everyone to rest, and ordered Guan Xing and Zhang Bao to lead five hundred cavalry each to go out on a tour. At dusk, Guan Xing played back and said, ""There is a fire in the camp in Jiangbei."" The First Sovereign urgently ordered Guan Xing to go to Jiangbei and Zhang Bao to go to Jiangnan to check the truth: ""If Wu's army arrives, you can quickly report back.""","Back at the first ruler’s camp, he is confident that the enemy cannot prevail but he is persuaded to issue orders to Zhang Bao and Guan Xing to go and see if there is any movement by the enemy.","The First Ruler was in his own camp, pondering over a plan to destroy the armies of Wu, when suddenly the staff that bore the great standard in front of his own tent fell over and lay on the ground. There was no wind to account for this, so he turned to Cheng Ji and asked what it might portend. “It means only one thing, that the troops of Wu will raid the camp tonight,” said Cheng Ji. “They will not dare after the slaughter of yesterday.” “But suppose that was only a reconnaissance; what then?” Just then a report came in that some troops of Wu could be seen, very far off, going along the hills eastward. “They are soldiers meant to put us in confusion,” said the First Ruler. “Tell the generals not to move, but let Guan Xing and Zhang Bao, with a small mounted force, go out to reconnoiter.” It was dusk when these two returned, and they then reported: “Fire is seen among the camps on the north bank.” The Emperor hastily bade Guan Xing go to the north camps and Zhang Bao to the south to find out what was really happening."

却說張虎在營中，望見火光，大開寨門，與樂綝盡引人馬，殺奔蜀寨來——寨中却不見一人。急收軍回時，吳班、吳懿兩路兵殺出，斷其歸路。張、樂二將急衝出軍圍，奔回本寨，只見土城之上，箭如飛蝗：原來却被關興、張苞襲了營寨。魏兵大敗，皆投曹眞寨來。方欲入寨，只見一彪敗軍飛奔而來，乃是孫禮；遂同入寨見眞，各言中計之事。眞聽知，謹守大寨，更不出戰。蜀兵得勝，回見孔明。,"But he said that Zhang Hu was in the camp, saw the fire, opened the gate of the village, and led everyone with Le Chen to kill him to the Shu village—but there was no one in the village. When the army was rushed back, Wu Ban and Wu Yi rushed out and cut off their way back. The two generals Zhang and Le rushed out of the army siege and rushed back to their home village, only to see arrows like locusts on the top of the city: it turned out that Guan Xing and Zhang Bao attacked the camp. The Wei army was defeated, and they all turned to Cao Zhenzhai. When Fang wanted to enter the village, he saw a defeated army rushing towards him. It was Sun Li. Then he entered the village and saw the truth. Hearing that, he kept to Dazhai, and never fought. The Shu soldiers were victorious and returned to see Kongming.","With the defending army shattered, Kong Ming and the triumphant Shu army cross through the Qishan pass and into the Wei lands.","When Zhang Hu and Yue Chen saw the fire, they threw open the gates of their camp and sallied forth to help defeat the army of Shu by seizing their camp. But when they reached the Shu camp, they found it empty. So they hurried to set out to return. That was the moment for Wu Ban and Wu Yi to appear and cut off their retreat. However, they fought bravely and got through. But when at length they reached their own camp, they were met by arrows flying thick as locusts. For Guan Xing and Zhang Bao had taken possession in their absence. They could only set out for headquarters to report their mishap. As they neared Cao Zhen's camp, they met another remnant marching up. They were Sun Li's soldiers, and the two parties went into camp together and told the tale of their victimization. Cao Zhen thereafter looked to his defenses and attacked no more. Thus victorious, the soldiers of Shu went to Zhuge Liang, who at once dispatched secret directions to Wei Yan."

却說孫權令呂蒙、甘寧為前隊，自與凌統居中。其餘諸將陸續進發，望合淝殺來。呂蒙、甘寧前隊兵進，正與樂進相迎。甘寧出馬與樂進交鋒，戰不數合，樂進詐敗而走。甘寧招呼呂蒙一齊引軍趕去。孫權在第二隊，聽得前軍得勝，催兵行至逍遙津北，忽聞連珠礮響，左邊張遼一軍殺來，右邊李典一軍殺來。孫權大驚，急令人喚呂蒙、甘寧回救時，張遼兵已到。凌統手下，止有三百餘騎，當不得曹軍勢如山倒。凌統大呼曰：“主公何不速渡小師橋！”言未畢，張遼引二千餘騎，當先殺至，凌統翻身死戰。孫權縱馬上橋，橋南已折丈餘，並無一片板。孫權驚得手足無措。牙將谷利大呼曰：“主公可約馬退後，再放馬向前，跳過橋去。”孫權收回馬來有三丈餘遠，然後縱轡加鞭，那馬一跳飛過橋南。後人有詩曰：,"However, Sun Quan ordered Lü Meng and Gan Ning to be the front team, and Ling Tong to be in the middle. The rest of the generals marched forward one after another, hoping to kill Hefei. Lü Meng and Gan Ning's troops marched forward and were welcoming Le Jin. Gan Ning went out to fight with Le Jin, but the battle was over, and Le Jin cheated and left. Gan Ning greeted Lu Meng and led the army to rush out together. Sun Quan was in the second team. Hearing the victory of the former army, he urged the troops to march north of Xiaoyao Jin. Suddenly, he heard the sound of pearls, Zhang Liao's army on the left was attacking, and Li Dian's army was attacking on the right. Sun Quan was startled, and when he urgently called for Lü Meng and Gan Ning to rescue him, Zhang Liao's troops had already arrived. Ling Tong's subordinates only had more than 300 cavalry, and Cao's army should not be overwhelmed. Ling Tong shouted, ""Master, why don't you cross the Xiaoshi Bridge quickly!"" Before he could finish his words, Zhang Liao led more than 2,000 cavalry to kill him first, and Ling Tong turned around and fought to the death. Sun Quan rode straight to the bridge, and the south of the bridge was more than zhang away, and there was not a single board. Sun Quan was at a loss. The general Gu Li shouted, ""My lord, you can ask the horse to step back, then let the horse go forward and jump over the bridge."" South. A later poem says:","The initial attack by Sun Quan’s men is successful, but then, before he knows quite what is happening, Sun Quan is being attacked by Zhang Liao. Ling Tong is with him but has only about three hundred riders and is unable to withstand Zhang Liao’s assault. ‘My lord, cross the Xiaoshi bridge as fast as you can!’ Ling Tong shouts to Sun Quan, as two thousand of the enemy cavalry bear down upon them. Sun Quan rides hell for leather to the bridge, only to find the far end already destroyed. He hesitates. One of his men sees his fear and shouts, ‘Ride back and then charge forward and leap over the gap, my lord.’","As has been recorded, the leaders of the advance guard of the southern army were the veterans Lu Meng and Gan Ning. Sun Quan and Ling Tong were in the center; the other generals followed them. The leaders of the van met Yue Jin first, and Gan Ning rode out and challenged him. After a few bouts, Yue Jin pretended to be defeated and fled. Gan Ning called to his colleague to join in the pursuit. When Sun Quan heard that this advance guard had been successful, he hastened his army to the Flageolet Ford. But then there came a series of explosions, and up came Zhang Liao and Li Dian, one on each flank. Sun Quan was unprepared for this and sent messengers to call off the pursuit and ask for help from Lu Meng and Gan Ning. Before it could arrived, Zhang Liao had come up. Manifestly, Ling Tong, who had with him only a small troop of three hundred horse, could not long withstand the army of Cao Cao, but he faced them and fought bravely and presently cried to his lord, “Cross the Flageolet Bridge and run back, my lord!” Sun Quan galloped for the bridge, but the southern end had been already broken down and there was a wide breach between the end of the bridge and the shore. Not a single plank was there by which to cross. What could be done? Sun Quan was in a quandary, and helpless. “Go back and jump for it!” yelled one of the generals, Gu Li by name. Sun Quan did so. Backing his horse some thirty spans or so, he then gave it its head and lashed it with his whip. The good beast leaped, cleared the chasm and his master wee safe on the southern shore.

炎大喜，次日帶劍入內。此時魏主曹奐，連日不曾設朝，心神恍惚，舉止失措。炎直入後宮，奐慌下御榻而迎。炎坐畢，問曰：“魏之天下，誰之力也？”奐曰：“皆晉王父祖之賜耳。”炎笑曰：“吾觀陛下：文不能論道，武不能經邦。何不讓有才德者主之？”奐大驚，口噤不能言。傍有黃門侍郎張節大喝曰：“晉王之言差矣！昔日魏武祖皇帝，東蕩西除，南征北討，非容易得此天下；今天子有德無罪，何故讓與人耶？”炎大怒曰：“此社稷乃大漢之社稷也。曹操挾天子以令諸侯，自立魏王，篡奪漢室。吾祖父三世輔魏，得天下者，非曹氏之能，實司馬氏之力也：四海咸知。吾今日豈不堪紹魏之天下乎？”節又曰：“欲行此事，是篡國之賊也！”炎大怒曰：“吾與漢家報讎，有何不可！”叱武士將張節亂瓜打死於殿下。奐泣淚跪告。炎起身下殿而去。奐謂賈充、裴秀曰：“事已急矣，如之奈何？”充曰：“天數盡矣，陛下不可逆天，當照漢獻帝故事，重修受禪臺，具大禮，禪位與晉王：上合天心，下順民情，陛下可保無虞矣。”,"Yan was overjoyed and brought his sword in the next day. At this time, Cao Huan, the master of Wei, had not set up a court for several days, so he was in a trance and was at a loss. Yan Zhi entered the harem, and Huan panicked and got off the imperial couch to welcome him. After Yan finished sitting, he asked, ""Who has the power in the world of Wei?"" Huan said, ""All of them have been given ears by the father and ancestor of the King of Jin."" Yan smiled and said, ""My Majesty: Literature cannot discuss Taoism, and martial arts cannot guide the state. Why not Let the wise and virtuous take over?"" Huan was shocked, unable to speak. Nearby, Zhang Jie, a servant of the Yellow Gate, shouted loudly, ""The King of Jin's words are wrong! In the past, Emperor Wuzu of Wei, who swayed from the east to the west, and conquered the south and the north, was not easy to gain this world. Today, the son is virtuous and innocent, why did he give it to others?"" Yan was furious and said: ""This Sheji is the Sheji of the Han Dynasty. Cao Cao took the Son of Heaven to order the princes to establish himself as the King of Wei and usurp the Han Dynasty. My grandfather helped Wei for the third time and won the world. It is not the ability of the Cao clan, but the power of the Sima clan. ""The world knows it. How can I be unbearable today under Shaowei's rule?"" Jie also said, ""If you want to do this, you are a usurper!"" Yan was furious and said, ""I report to the Han family, why not? !"" The samurai beat Zhang Jie Luangua to his death. Huan cried and cried. Yan got up and left. Huan said to Jia Chong and Pei Xiu: ""The matter is urgent, what can I do?"" Chong said: ""The number of days is over, Your Majesty is irreversible, we should follow the story of Emperor Xian of the Han Dynasty and rebuild the meditation platform, with great gifts and a Zen seat. With the King of Jin: Upstairs is in harmony with Heaven’s heart, downstairs is in accord with the people’s feelings, and Your Majesty can keep it safe.”","It is agreed that this precedent means he could. That is all he needs. He goes immediately to the palace rooms of the Emperor Cao Huan with his sword unsheathed. ‘Exactly who won the kingdom for the Wei?’ he demands. ‘Your grandfather and father,’ says a cowed emperor. ‘Well, Your Majesty,’ says a smiling Sima Yan, ‘frankly you have none of the skills or talents required to rule or command a country. Perhaps it is time to abdicate and let someone more competent take over. Now don’t you think that is a good idea?’ An astonished emperor is left speechless, but an official speaks up for him, claiming that not only did Cao Cao win this, but his descendant is a worthy man. He is beaten to death for his troubles. The emperor’s other advisers, seeing the writing on the wall, recommend abdication, and that way the emperor will be able to live out his years in peace. And so it happens. Early in AD 265 the emperor abdicates, and Sima Yan ascends the throne. Jia Chong reads out the pronouncement that the Mandate of Heaven passed from the Han when they lost it to the Wei forty-five years ago. Now they too have lost it. Heaven and Earth’s choice now rests upon the Sima family. With that Cao Huan is dismissed with a minor title, and Sima Yan becomes the emperor of the new dynasty entitled the Great Jin.","Sima Yan resolved to act promptly. Next day he entered the Palace armed with a sword. No court had been held for many days, for Cao Huang was ill at ease and full of dread. When Sima Yan appeared, the Ruler of Wei left his place and advanced to met him. Sima Yan sat down. “By whose merits did Wei succeed to empire?” he asked suddenly. “Certainly success was due to your forefathers,” replied Cao Huang. Sima Yan smiled, saying, “Your Majesty is unskilled in debate, inept in war, and unfit to rule. Why not give place to another more able and virtuous?” Cao Huang's lips refused a reply. But Zhang Jie, one of the ministers, cried, “You are wrong to speak thus, O Prince. His Majesty's ancestor conquered east and west, north and south, and won the empire by strenuous effort. The present Emperor is virtuous and without fault. Why should he yield place to another?” Sima Yan replied angrily, “The imperial right lay with the Hans, and Cao Cao coerced them as he did the nobles. In making himself the Prince of Wei, he usurped the throne of Han. Three generations of my forefathers upheld the House of Wei, so that their power is not the result of their own abilities, but of the labor of my house. This is known to all the world, and am I not equal to carrying on the rule of Wei?” “If you do this thing, you will be a rebel and an usurper,” said Zhang Jie. “And what shall I be if I avenge the wrongs of Han?” He bade the lictors take Zhang Jie outside and beat him to death, while the Ruler of Wei wept and besought pardon for his faithful counselor. Sima Yan rose and left. Cao Huang turned to Jia Chong and Pei Xiu, saying, “What should I do? Some decision must be taken.” They replied, “Truth to tell, the measure of your fate is accomplished and you cannot oppose the will of Heaven. You must prepare to abdicate as did Emperor Xian of the Hans. Resign the throne to the Prince of Jin and thereby accord with the design of Heaven and the will of the people. Your personal safety need not cause you anxiety.”"

The messenger returned to see the Duke of Guan, uttering the words of Lu Meng, and said that in the city of Jingzhou, the princes and nobles and the families of the generals were all in good condition and there was no shortage of supplies. The duke was furious and said, ""This is a traitor's plan! I can't kill this thief in my life, I will kill him in death, and I hate it!"" He shouted back the envoy. When the messenger left the village, all the generals came to inquire about the affairs of the family. The messenger promised that all the families were well, and Lu Meng was extremely sympathetic and sent letters to the generals. Everyone will be happy, but they will not fight.","Meanwhile, Lü Meng politely turns down the request from Guan Yu. When Guan Yu receives this news he roars with anger and frustration, vowing vengeance upon Lü Meng, and then gruffly dismisses the messenger. Going outside, the messenger is mobbed by men wanting to know how their families are. The letters and oral reports he gives move and trouble them. As a result, they begin to question why they should go on fighting.","When he left the city, Lu Meng himself escorted him to the outskirts and set him on his way. On his return to the army, he gave to Guan Yu the message of Lu Meng and told him that the families were all well and safe and well cared for. This, however, did not greatly please Guan Yu, for he saw in this merely a plan to gain favor and popularity. “The brigand! If I cannot slay him while I live, I will after I am dead. My hate shall not go unappeased.” He roughly dismissed the messenger, who went out and was at once surrounded by those whose families were in the city and who desired to have news of them. And when he gave them the letters and messages and told them all were well, there was great rejoicing among the men in the camp, and kindly feelings for Lu Meng prevailed. And therewith died down the spirit of fighting."

Zhang wanted to go out of Fucheng to meet Xuande in person, so he ordered to prepare the carriage, the tent, the flags, and the armor, which must be clear. The chief clerk Huang Quan remonstrated and said: ""If your lord goes here, you will be harmed by Liu Bei. You have been living for many years, but you cannot bear the scheming of others in your lord's hands: please think about it again."" Zhang Song said: ""Huang Quan's words are the meaning of the clan.

Quan bowed his head and bleed, and approached him with Zhang's robe in his mouth to remonstrate. Zhang was furious and pulled up his clothes.

The Imperial Protector proposed to go out in person to welcome Liu Bei and ordered carriages to be prepared and tents and banners. All the escort were dressed in glittering armor. At this Secretary Huang Quan, the sturdy opponent of the invitation to Liu Bei, again remonstrated. “My lord, if you go out, you will be exposed to danger. I have been in your service for many years, and I would prevent you from being the victim of another's wiles. I pray you reflect.” Zhang Song said, “His words are those of one who would sow discord in a family and encourage the power of the robbers who threaten you. Assuredly such action is to your detriment.” Liu Zhang then spoke angrily to Huang Quan, saying, “I have decided, and why do you oppose me?” The objector bowed his head and wept. Then approaching nearer, he seized hold of the Imperial Protector's robe with his teeth to hinder him. Liu Zhang angrily shook his robe and rose from his seat, but Huang Quan still held on till two of his teeth fell out. Then the guards forced him away, and he retired, still crying."

Jia Xu said, ""We must call Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren back to discuss the matter."" When Cao Yu sent an envoy, Xingye called him back. Before Xiahou Dun arrived, Cao Ren arrived first and went into the mansion to see Cao overnight. Cao Fang was drunk and lay down, and Xu Chu stood in the hall door with a sword. Cao Ren wanted to enter, but was taken by Xu Chu. Cao Ren was furious and said, ""I am the clan of the Cao clan, how dare you stop me?"" Xu Chu said, ""Although the general is close, he is an official guarded by foreign vassals; although Xu Chu is sick, he is now serving as an internal servant. Put it in."" Ren Nai dared not enter. When Cao Cao heard this, he sighed and said, ""Xu Chu is really a loyal minister!"" Not a few days later, Xiahou Dun also arrived, and they discussed conquest. Dun said: ""Wu and Shu are in a hurry to attack. It is advisable to take Zhang Lu in Hanzhong first, and take Shu with the victorious troops. You can go down in one drum."" Cao Cao said: ""It is exactly what I want."" Exactly:","So just over a month later, on the first day of the new year, Cao Cao’s daughter becomes the empress of Han, and not a voice is raised in opposition. As a result Cao Cao grows more and more powerful and he decides the time has come to conquer both Wu and Shu. He summons Cao Ren and Xiahou Dun to come and plan the war. It is Xiahou Dun who suggests what should happen next. ‘ Forget attacking either Wu or Shu at this time. Instead attack Zhang Lu in Hanzhong, and then we can seize Shu.’ ‘That’s exactly what I think,’ says Cao Cao.","Wherefore Cao Cao became even more powerful. But it pleased him not to have rivals in the land, so he again thought of subduing Liu Bei and Sun Quan. Jia Xu proposed, saying, “Xiahou Dun and Cao Ren, who are serving on the frontiers, should be called to give their advice.” They were sent for, and Cao Ren was the first to arrive. As a relative, he felt he had the right to see the great minister without delay and went directly to the palace. But it happened that Cao Cao had been drinking heavily, and his faithful henchman, Xu Chu, would not admit the new arrival. “I am of the family,” said Cao Ren, angry at the hindrance. “Dare you stop me?” “General, you may be a relative, but here you are but an officer from the frontier. I am of little account, but a duty lies on me here in the palace. Our lord is overcome with wine and asleep, and I dare not allow you to enter.” The refusal came to Cao Cao's knowledge, and he commended the loyalty of Xu Chu. Soon after, Xiahou Dun came and was called to the council. Xiahou Dun gave his opinion, saying, “The two rivals should be left until Zhang Lu of Hanzhong has been subdued. The great army that can overcome Zhang Lu will be in condition to attack the Western Land of Rivers, and it will be conquered without difficulty.” The advice coincided with Cao Cao's own idea, and so he prepared an expedition for the west.

邇者，荊州覆敗，大臣失節，百無一還；惟臣尋事，自致房陵、上庸，而復乞身自放於外。伏想殿下聖恩感悟，愍臣之心，悼臣之舉。臣誠小人，不能始終。知而為之，敢謂非罪？臣每聞‘交絕無惡聲，去臣無怨辭’。臣過奉敎於君子，願君王勉之。臣不勝惶恐之至！,"The last one is that Jingzhou was defeated, the ministers were disobedient, and there was no return; only the ministers searched for trouble, and they caused Fangling and Shangyong, and they begged and let themselves go. His Royal Highness Fuxiang was enlightened by the Holy Grace, sympathized with the heart of the minister, and mourned the actions of the minister. Chencheng villain, can not always. Knowing and doing it, dare to say it is not a crime? Every time a minister hears, ""There is no evil voice in the communication, and there is no complaining when the minister goes away."" The minister has been entrusted to the gentleman, and may the king encourage him. The minister is terrified!","When the messenger who took the notice to Meng Da returns with the news and a carefully worded letter from Meng Da to Xuande arguing that out of loyalty he is deserting, Xuande is furious.","“Lately Jingzhou was overwhelmed, and I, an officer of rank, failed in my duty, not one in a hundred behaving as I should. Only I return Fangling and Shangyong and seek service abroad. Now I desire you, O Prince, graciously to understand, to sympathize with thy servant and to condone the step he is about to take. Really I am but a mean man, incapable of great deeds. I know what I am doing, and I dare to say it is no small fault. “They say that dissolution of bonds should not occasion recrimination, and the dismissed servant should take leave without heart-burning. I have taken your orders many times, and now, O Prince, you must act yourself. I write this with extreme trepidation.” But the reading gave rise to great anger in the breast of the Prince. “The unmerited fellow!” said he."
却說鍾會出師之時，有百官送出城外，旌旗蔽日，鎧甲凝霜，人強馬壯，威風凜然：人皆稱羨，惟有相國參軍劉寔，微笑不語。太尉王祥，見寔冷笑，就馬上握其手而問曰：“鍾、鄧二人，此去可平蜀乎？”寔曰：“破蜀必矣——但恐皆不得還都耳。”王祥問其故，劉寔但笑而不答。祥遂不復問。,"But it is said that when Zhong Hui left the division, there were hundreds of officials sent out of the city, with banners and flags covering the sun, frosted armor, strong men and strong horses, and awe-inspiring: everyone admired them, but only the prime minister joined the army, Liu Yu, who smiled without saying a word. Taiwei Wang Xiang, seeing Huan's sneer, immediately shook his hand and asked, ""Zhong and Deng, can we pacify Shu now?"" Huan said, ""We will break Shu—but I'm afraid they won't be able to return to Shu."" When Wang Xiang asked the reason, Liu Yu smiled but did not answer. Xiang Sui asked no more.","Orders come for him to liaise with Zhong Hui for the attack on Hanzhong, while another army is sent to attack Jiang Wei at Tazhong.","Meanwhile in the camp of Zhong Hui, all the officials came out to see him depart. It was a grand sight, the gay banners shutting out the sun, breastplates and helmets glittering. The soldiers were fit and the horses in good condition. They all felicitated the leader. All save one; for Liu Shi was silent. He smiled grimly. Then Commander Wang Xiang made his way through the crowd and said, “Do you think these two—Zhong Hui and Deng Ai—will overcome Shu?” Said Liu Shi, “They will overcome Shu certainly, only I think neither will ever come back.” “Why do you say that?” But Liu Shi did not reply; he only smiled. And the question was not repeated."
却說司馬懿聞北原兵敗，急自引軍來救。方到半路，忽一聲礮響，兩路兵自險峻處殺出，喊聲震地。旗上大書：“漢將張翼廖化”。司馬懿見了大驚。魏軍着慌，各自逃竄。正是：,"But Sima Yi heard that Beiyuan was defeated, and hurriedly brought in troops to rescue him. When Fang was halfway through, there was a sudden sound, and two soldiers rushed out from the precarious place, and the shouts shook the ground. The big book on the flag reads: ""Han general Zhang Yi Liao Hua"". Sima Yi was shocked. Wei Jun panicked and fled each other. Exactly:","Hearing the cries of his men, Sima Yi rides out himself to the rescue, but he is trapped, and his men desert, leaving him stranded. Is this the end for Sima Yi? Let’s find out.","Hearing that his Beiyuan troops had been driven off, Sima Yi came out to the rescue. Midway along the road, just where it was most precipitous, a cohort burst out upon him with fierce yells and bursting bombs. Upon the leading banner he read “Zhang Yi and Liao Hua, Generals of Han”. Panic seized upon his army, and they ran like winds. In the field the craftier leader on the convoy makes a raid,"
忽報東吳遣張温與鄧芝入川答禮。後主聚文武於丹墀，令鄧芝、張温入。温自以為得志，昂然上殿，見後主施禮。後主賜錦墩，坐於殿左，設御宴待之。後主但敬禮而已。宴罷，百官送張温到館舍。次日，孔明設宴相待。孔明謂張温曰：“先帝在日，與吳不睦，今已晏駕。當今主上：深慕吳王，欲捐舊忿，永結盟好，併力破魏。望大夫善言回奏。”張温領諾。酒至半酣，張温喜笑自若，頗有傲慢之意。,"Suddenly, it was reported that Soochow Wu sent Zhang Wen and Deng Zhi into Sichuan to give a gift. Afterwards, the master gathered the civil and military in Danchi, and ordered Deng Zhi and Zhang Wen to enter. Wen thought he was successful, went up to the hall proudly, and saw the empress saluting. Later, the lord bestowed Jindun and sat on the left side of the hall, and set a royal banquet for him. The latter is just a salute. After the banquet, the officials sent Zhang Wen to the hall. The next day, Kong Ming held a banquet to treat each other. Kong Ming said to Zhang Wen: ""The first emperor was in Japan, and he was not on good terms with Wu, but now he is at peace. The present lord: I deeply admire the king of Wu, and want to give up the old wrath. We will always form an alliance and break Wei. I hope the doctor will respond with kind words. ""Zhang Wen Lingnuo. When the wine was half full, Zhang Wen smiled and seemed arrogant.",Kong Ming agrees with the second ruler that if Deng Zhi returns with an envoy from Wu then they will forge an alliance against Wei.,"Presently the report reached the capital that Deng Zhi and Zhang Wen, as envoy of Wu, would soon arrive. The Latter Ruler assembled the courtiers to receive them honorably. The envoy of Wu carried himself as one who had attained his desires, and advanced boldly. Having made his salute, the Latter Ruler gave him to sit on a brocaded stool on his left hand. A banquet followed at which Zhang Wen was treated with much honor. At the end of the banquet, the whole court escorted the envoy to the guest-house where he was to lodge. On the second day there was a banquet at the Prime Minister's palace, and Zhuge Liang broached the real business. He said, “Our First Ruler was not on friendly terms with Wu. But that is all changed, as is demonstrated by these banquets, and our present Emperor is disposed to be very friendly. It is hoped that the former enmity may be entirely forgotten and the two countries swear eternal friendship and alliance in their common end—the destruction of Wei. I look to you, Sir, to speak in favor of this league.” Zhang Wen said that he would support the plan. The wine went merrily round, and as the envoy became mellow, he laughed freely and swaggered and put on a proud demeanor."

夫難平者，事也。昔先帝敗軍於楚，當此時，曹操拊手，謂天下已定——然後先帝東連吳、越，西取巴、蜀，舉兵北征，夏侯授首。此操之失計，而漢事將成也——然後吳更違盟，關羽毁敗，秭歸蹉跌，曹丕稱帝：凡事如是，難可逆料。臣鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已；至於成敗利鈍，非臣之明所能逆覩也。,"Those who are difficult to be flat, things are also. In the past, when the previous emperor was defeated in Chu, at this time, Cao Cao swung his hand, saying that the world was settled - then the previous emperor connected Wu and Yue in the east, Ba and Shu in the west, raised his troops to march north, and Xiahou gave the head. This is a miscalculation, and the Han affairs will be completed - then Wu even violated the alliance, Guan Yu was defeated, Zigui fell, and Cao Pi became emperor: everything is as it is, it is hard to predict. The minister devotes all his efforts to the end, and then dies; as for success or failure, it is beyond the knowledge of the minister to counteract it.","When the Shu army arrive outside Chencang, they find it stoutly fortified and commanded by Hao Zhao.","I do not understand the arguments. “A stable condition of affairs is indeed difficult to obtain. Once, when the First Ruler was defeated in Jingzhou, Cao Cao patted himself on the back and said that the empire was settled. Yet, after that, the First Ruler obtained the support of Wu and Yue on the east, took Ba and Shu on the west, and undertook an expedition to the north, wherein Xiahou Yuan lost his life. So Cao Cao calculations proved erroneous, and the affairs of Han seemed about to prosper. But, still later, Wu proved false to pledges, our Guan Yu was defeated, we sustained a check at Zigui—and Cao Pi assumed the imperial style. Such events prove the difficulty of forecast. I shall strive on to the end, but the final result, whether success or failure, whether gain or loss, is beyond my powers to foresee.”"
時魏主曹髦，改正元三年為甘露元年。司馬昭自為天下兵馬大都督，出入常令三千鐵甲驍將前後簇擁，以為護衞；一應事務，不奏朝廷，就於相府裁處：自此常懷篡逆之心。有一心腹人姓賈，名充，字公閭，乃故建威將軍賈逵之子，為昭府下長史。充語昭曰：“今主公掌握大柄，四方人心必然未安；且當暗訪，然後徐圖大事。”昭曰：“吾正欲如此。汝可為我東行，只推慰勞出征軍士為名，以探消息。”賈充領命，逕到淮南，入見鎮東大將軍諸葛誕。誕字公休，乃瑯琊南陽人，卽武侯之族弟也；向事於魏，因武侯在蜀為相，因此不得重用；後武侯身亡，誕在魏歷任重職，封高平侯，總攝兩淮軍馬。當日賈充託名勞軍，至淮南見諸葛誕。誕設宴待之。酒至半酣，充以言挑誕曰：“近來洛陽諸賢，皆以主上懦弱，不堪為君。司馬大將軍三世輔國，功德彌天，可以禪代魏統。未審鈞意若何？”誕大怒曰：“汝乃賈豫州之子，世食魏祿，安敢出此亂言！”充謝曰：“某以他人之言告公耳。”誕曰：“朝廷有難，吾當以死報之。”充默然。,"At that time, the ruler of Wei, Cao Mao, corrected the third year of Yuan to the first year of Ganlu. Sima Zhao is the self-proclaimed commander-in-chief of all the troops and horses in the world, and he often orders three thousand iron-clad generals to surround himself with guards when he enters and leaves. There was a confidant whose surname was Jia, whose first name was Chong, and whose courtesy name was Gonglu. He was the son of Jia Kui, a general of Jianwei, and he was the chief historian of the Zhao family. Cong Yuzhao said: ""Now that the lord has a great deal of power, the people of the four corners will not be at ease; let's make an unannounced visit, and then make plans for major events."" Zhao said: ""I want this. , to find out the news."" Jia Chong took orders and went to Huainan to meet Zhuge Dan, the general of Zhendong. The word birthday is Gongxiu, a native of Nanyang, Langya, and the younger brother of Marquis Wu; Xiang is in Wei, because Marquis Wu is the chancellor in Shu, so it cannot be reused; after Marquis Wu died, he was born in Wei. Huai army horse. On the same day, Jia Chong entrusted the army with the name Lao, and went to Huainan to see Zhuge Dan. Have a birthday feast. When the wine was half full, he said, ""Recently, all the sages in Luoyang have regarded their masters as cowardly and unbearable to be kings. General Sima has served the country for three generations, and his merits are so great that he can replace Wei Tong. What is the meaning of unjudging Jun?"" Dan was furious and said: ""You are the son of Jia Yuzhou, the world eats Wei Lu, and dare to make such nonsense!"" Chong Xie said: ""Someone told the public ear with the words of others."" Dan said: ""The court is in trouble, I should Retribution."" Chong Muran.","The Wei commanders celebrate, and Emperor Cao Mao changes the title of the year to that of Celebrating Victory to show how pleased he is. But everyone knows that the real ruler is without doubt Sima Zhao. It is he who takes all the key decisions without even the pretence of asking the emperor. In such circumstances it is only a matter of time before aspirations of imperial glory begin to shape Sima Zhao’s thoughts. He is encouraged in this by his chief adviser, Jia Chong, who offers to go and take soundings as to how such an idea might go down in the country. The first person he visits is Zhuge Dan, a cousin of Kong Ming, who lives in Huainan and is the controller of the forces on both sides of the River Huai. Despite being related to the former prime minister of the enemy country of Shu, Zhuge Dan through his own abilities has risen slowly through the ranks in Wei. While dining with him, as if in an aside, Jia Chong mentions that some people of worth have been saying they no longer feel the emperor is up to the task and that the Regent Sima Zhao should take over. ‘ They see him as more worthy, but I wonder what your opinion is?’ Zhuge Dan’s reaction is immediate: ‘If this were to take place, I would die fighting to protect the throne.’ He also criticizes Jia Chong as the son of a long-time servant of the Wei for even raising it.","At this time the style of the reign in Wei was changed from Right Origin, the third year, to Gentle Dew, the first year (AD 256). Sima Zhao commanded all the military forces and made himself Empire Commander-in-Chief. He assumed great pomp, and whenever he moved outside his palace, he was escorted by three thousand mail-clad guards, beside squadrons of cavalry. All power lay in his hands, and he decided all questions so that the court was rather in his palace than in that of the Emperor. Plans for taking the final step constantly occupied his thoughts. The question of mounting the throne was openly mooted by Jia Chong, a confidant, who was a son of Commander Jia Kui. Jia Chong said, “Sir, all real authority is in your hands, and the country is not tranquil. The only remedy is for you to become actual ruler, and you should find out who are your supporters.” Sima Zhao replied, “This has been in my thoughts a long time. You might be my emissary to the east to find out the feeling there. You can pretend you go to thank the soldiers who took part in the late campaign. That would be a good pretext.” Accordingly Jia Chong traveled into the South of River Huai, where he saw Zhuge Dan, General Who Guards the East. This officer was from Nanyang and a cousin of the late Lord of Wuxiang, Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Dan had gone to Wei for employment, but had received no significant office while Zhuge Liang was the Prime minister of Shu. After Zhuge Liang's death, Zhuge Dan's promotion was rapid. He was now Lord of Gaoping and Commander of the south and east of River Huai. Jia Chong went to Zhuge Dan to ask him to convey to the army the appreciation of the soldiers' services. Jia Chong was received courteously, and at a banquet, when host and guest were both mellow with wine, Jia Chong set himself to discover Zhuge Dan's feelings. Jia Chong said, “Lately in Luoyang there has been much talk of the weakness and lack of ability of the Emperor and his unfitness to rule. Now General Sima Zhao comes of a family noted for state service for three generations. His own services and virtues are high as the heavens, and he is the man best fitted to take the rulership of Wei. Is this not your opinion?” But Zhuge Dan did not favor the suggestion. On the contrary, he broke out angrily, “You are a son of Jia Kui of Yuzhou, and your family have received the bounty of Wei. Yet you dare speak of rebellion!” Jia Chong said, “I only repeat what people have said.” Zhuge Dan said, “If the state is in difficulty, then one ought to stand up for it even to the death.” Jia Chong said no more."

岳飛——本是南宋的大將。他抵抗金人的侵略有功，被秦檜陷害而死。這裏是說書人的口氣，所以用了三國以後的典故。,"Yue Fei was a general of the Southern Song Dynasty. He was successful in resisting the aggression of the Jin people, and was framed and killed by Qin Hui. This is the tone of the storyteller, so the allusions after the Three Kingdoms are used.",What will happen next? What indeed. CHAPTER 114,Yue Yi and Yue Fei failed.

主簿王韜曰：“昔日耿恭受困，拜井而得甘泉：將軍何不效之？”昭從其言，遂上山頂泉邊，再拜而祝曰：“昭奉詔來退蜀兵，若昭合死，令甘泉枯竭，昭自當刎頸，敎部軍盡降；如壽祿未終，願蒼天早賜甘泉，以活衆命！”祝畢，泉水湧出，取之不竭；因此人馬不死。,"Wang Tao, the chief clerk, said: ""In the past, Geng Gong was trapped and worshipped the well to get the Ganquan: why didn't the general take effect?"" Zhao followed his words and went up to the spring on the top of the mountain. If Zhaohe dies, the Ganquan will be exhausted, Zhao will cut his neck, and all his troops will be sent down; if his life is not over, may the heaven give the Ganquan to live the lives of all people!"" After the blessing, the spring water gushed out, and it was inexhaustible; therefore Horses don't die.",It is then that Sima Zhao is reminded of the story of how a former hero similarly trapped and without water prayed to the spring and it gushed forth water a hundredfold.,"In this critical situation a certain civil officer, Wang Tao by name, reminded his leader of what Geng Gong had done in ancient time, saying, “O General, why do you not imitate Geng Gong, who, being in great need, prostrated himself and prayed at a well, wherefrom he afterwards was supplied with sweet water?” So the leader went to the summit of the hill and knelt beside the spring and grayed thus: “The humble Sima Zhao received a command to repulse the army of Shu. If he is to die here, then may this spring cease its flow, when he will end his own life and let his soldiers yield to the enemy. But if his allotted span of life be not reached, then, O Blue Vault, increase the flow of water and save the lives of this multitude.” Thus he prayed; and the waters gushed forth in plenty, so that they all quenched their thirst and lived."

却說司馬懿引兵布成陣勢，只待蜀兵亂動，一齊攻之。忽見張郃、戴陵狼狽而來，告曰：“孔明先如此隄防，因此大敗而歸。”懿大驚曰：“孔明眞神人也！——不如且退。”卽傳令敎大軍盡回本寨，堅守不出。,"But he said that Sima Yi led his troops to form a formation, and only waited for the troops of Shu to move and attack them together. Suddenly he saw Zhang He and Dai Ling coming in embarrassed, and said, ""Kong Ming first made such a dike, so he was defeated and returned."" Yi was shocked and said: ""Kong Ming is really a god! - It's better to retreat."" This village can't hold on.","Sima Yi sends a relief force to aid the besieged towns of Wudu and Yinping, only for that force to discover that Kong Ming has taken the two towns and that they are trapped between different groups of Shu troops.","By this time Sima Yi had completed his battle line and was waiting the moment of disorder in the Shu army to attack. Then he saw Zhang He and Dai Ling come limping back dejected and crestfallen. They said, “Zhuge Liang forestalled us; he was well prepared, and so we were quite defeated.” “He is more than human!” exclaimed Sima Yi. “We must retreat.” So the whole army retired into the fortified camps and would not come out."
次日，夏侯楙復整金鼓旗旛，率兵而進。趙雲、鄧芝出迎。芝在馬上謂趙雲曰：“昨夜魏兵大敗而走，今日復來，必有詐也，老將軍防之。”子龍曰：“量此乳臭小兒，何足道哉！吾今日必當擒之！”便躍馬而出。魏將潘遂出迎，戰不三合，撥馬便走。趙雲趕去，魏陣中八員將一齊來迎。放過夏侯楙先走，八將陸續奔走。趙雲乘勢追殺，鄧芝引兵繼進。趙雲深入重地，只聽得四面喊聲大震。鄧芝急收軍退回，左有董禧，右有薛則，兩路兵殺到。鄧芝兵少，不能解救。趙雲被困在垓心，東衝西突，魏兵越厚。時雲手下止有千餘人，殺到山坡之下，只見夏侯楙在山上指揮三軍。趙雲投東則望東指，投西則望西指：因此趙雲不能突圍——乃引兵殺上山來。半山中擂木礮石打將下來，不能上山。趙雲從辰時殺至酉時，不能脫走，只得下馬少歇，且待月明再戰。却纔卸甲而坐，月光方出，忽四下火光沖天，鼓聲大震，矢石如雨，魏兵殺到，皆叫曰：“趙雲早降！”雲急上馬迎敵。四面軍馬漸漸逼近，八方弩箭交射甚急，人馬皆不能向前。雲仰天歎曰：“吾不服老，死於此地矣！”忽東北角上喊聲大起，魏兵紛紛亂竄：一彪軍殺到，為首大將持丈八點鋼矛，馬項下挂一顆人頭。雲視之，乃張苞也。苞見了趙雲，言曰：“丞相恐老將軍有失，特遣某引五千兵接應。聞老將軍被困，故殺透重圍。正遇魏將薛則攔路，被某殺之。”雲大喜，卽與張苞殺出西北角來。只見魏兵棄戈奔走：一彪軍從外吶喊殺入，為首大將提偃月靑龍刀，手挽人頭。雲視之，乃關興也。興曰：“奉丞相之命，恐老將軍有失，特引五千兵前來接應。却纔陣上逢着魏將董禧，被吾一刀斬之，梟首在此。丞相隨後便到也。”雲曰：“二將軍已建奇功，何不趁今日擒住夏侯楙，以定大事？”張苞聞言，遂引兵去了。興曰：“我也幹功去。”遂亦引兵去了。雲回顧左右曰：“他兩個是吾子姪輩，尚且爭先幹功；吾乃國家上將，朝廷舊臣，反不如此小兒耶？吾當捨老命以報先帝之恩！”於是引兵來捉夏侯楙。當夜三路兵夾攻，大破魏軍一陣。鄧芝引兵接應，殺得屍橫遍野，血流成河。夏侯楙乃無謀之人，更兼年幼，不曾經戰；見軍大亂，遂引帳下驍將百餘人，望南安郡而走。衆軍因見無主，盡皆逃竄。興、苞二將，聞夏侯楙望南安郡去了，連夜趕來。楙走入城中，令緊閉城門，驅兵守禦。興、苞二人趕到，將城圍住；趙雲隨後也到：三面攻打。少時，鄧芝亦引兵到。一連圍了十日，攻打不下。忽報丞相留後軍住沔陽，左軍屯陽平，右軍屯石城，自引中軍來到。趙雲、鄧芝、關興、張苞皆來拜問孔明，說連日攻城不下。,"The next day, Xiahou Mao restored the golden drums and flags and led his troops to advance. Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi went out to greet him. Zhi immediately called to Zhao Yun and said, ""Last night the Wei soldiers were defeated and left, and they come back today. There must be a deception, and the old general will guard against it."" Zilong said, ""How can you measure this stinky child? I will capture him today. !"" He jumped out. The Wei general Pan Sui came out to meet him, and when the battle was not three-height, he plucked his horse and left. Zhao Yun rushed over, and the eight members of the Wei formation would all come to greet him. Let Xiahou Mao go first, and the eight generals will run away one after another. Zhao Yun chased after him, and Deng Zhi led his troops forward. Zhao Yun went deep into the heavy ground, only to hear loud shouts from all sides. Deng Zhi hurriedly withdrew the army and retreated, with Dong Xi on the left and Xue Ze on the right, and two soldiers were killed. Deng Zhi had few soldiers and could not be rescued. Zhao Yun was trapped in Gaixin, rushing east and west, and Wei's army became thicker. Shi Yun's subordinates only had more than a thousand men, and they were killed under the hillside, only to see Xiahou Mao commanding the three armies on the hill. When Zhao Yun casts east, he looks at the east, and when he casts in the west, he looks at the west: Therefore, Zhao Yun cannot break through the encirclement - he leads his troops up the mountain. In the middle of the mountain, the wood and stone were about to come down, and they could not go up the mountain. Zhao Yun killed from Chen Shi to You Shi, but could not escape, so he had to dismount and rest for a while, and wait for the moon to fight again. But just after he took off his armor and sat down, the moon was shining, and suddenly the fire was blazing into the sky, the drums were loud, the arrows and stones were like rain, and the Wei soldiers came, and they all shouted: ""Zhao Yun is down early!"" Yun hurriedly mounted his horse to meet the enemy. The horses on all sides were gradually approaching, and the crossbow arrows from all directions were very urgent, and neither the men nor the horses could move forward. Yun Yangtian sighed and said, ""I don't accept my old age, and I'm dying here!"" Suddenly, a loud voice erupted from the northeast corner, and the Wei soldiers scrambled: Yibiao's army was killed, and the leader of the general held an eight-point steel spear and hung from the horse's neck. a human head. Yun Shizhi was Zhang Bao. Bao saw Zhao Yun and said, ""The prime minister is afraid that the old general will be lost, and he sent a special agent to lead 5,000 soldiers to help him. The old general Wen was trapped, so he was able to kill the encirclement. He was blocked by the Wei general Xue Ze and was killed by a certain person."" Yun was overjoyed, and You and Zhang Bao rushed out of the northwest corner. I saw the Wei soldiers abandon their darts and run: Yi Biao army rushed in from the outside, leading the general to carry the Yanyue Dragon Saber and hold the head in his hand. The cloud sees it, and it is Guan Xing. Xing said: ""At the order of the Prime Minister, I feared that the old general would lose, so he invited 5,000 soldiers to come to meet him. However, I met Dong Xi, a Wei general, who was slashed by me. The owl's head is here. The Prime Minister will arrive later. Yun said, ""The two generals have already accomplished extraordinary feats, so why not take advantage of today to capture Xiahou Mao so that a major event can be settled?"" Zhang Bao heard the words and led his troops to go. Xing said, ""I'm going to do my work too."" Yun looked back and said: ""The two of them are my sons and daughters, and they are still competing to be the first to do their best. I am a general of the country and an old minister of the court, so I am not such a child? I should give up my old life to repay the kindness of the previous emperor!"" Let's catch Xiahou Mao. That night, the three-way soldiers attacked and broke the Wei army. Deng Zhi led troops to respond, killing corpses all over the place, blood flowing into rivers. Xiahou Mao was a man without a plan, and he was young and had never fought. When he saw the army was in chaos, he led more than a hundred generals under his tent to look at Nan'an County. Seeing that there was no owner, all the troops fled. The two generals, Xing and Bao, arrived overnight after hearing that Xiahou Mao had gone to Nan'an County. When Mao entered the city, he ordered the city gates to be closed, and he drove his troops to defend him. Xing and Bao arrived and surrounded the city; Zhao Yun also arrived later: they attacked from three sides. When he was young, Deng Zhi also led troops there. After ten days of siege, they were unable to attack. He suddenly reported that the Prime Minister had stayed behind to live in Mianyang, the left army was stationed in Yangping, the right army was stationed in Shicheng, and the Chinese army came. Zhao Yun, Deng Zhi, Guan Xing, and Zhang Bao all came to pay homage to Kong Ming, saying that they could not attack the city for days.","Xiahou Mao turns tail and flees, and the day is once again won by the troops of Shu. The Wei commanders meet that night to discuss what to do next and it is agreed to try to trap Zhao Zilong in an ambush the very next day. When Deng Zhi sees the army of Wei coming so soon after their previous disasters he warns Zhao Zilong that this probably means some sort of trick is planned. But Zhao dismisses these worries, saying of Xiahou Mao, ‘This child still has the smell of mother’s milk on his breath! I’ll finish him off today.’ So saying, Zhao Zilong charges into battle, and when he spots Xiahou Mao he goes straight for him, followed by Deng Zhi. They are, of course, swiftly drawn into an ambush. Realizing what is happening, Deng Zhi manages to pull back his own men and force his way out. But Zhao Zilong is trapped. Surrounded by the Wei men, Zilong fights against overwhelming odds and somehow manages to keep them at bay. Retreating but also determined to get to use the advantage of a small hill, he fights his way up the slope, hoping also to gain a better view of the scale of the threat. But he cannot reach the top because of a barrage of stones and logs. When night falls the Wei troops set fire to the hillside and close in for the kill. Fearlessly Zilong fights on. Down upon him rain thousands of arrows and crossbow bolts. There is no way of escape for him and his men, so he resigns himself to dying on that hill. Then, without warning, cries go up to the northeast, and the Wei soldiers start to scatter in terror. Riding to zilong’s rescue comes Zhang Bao, already bloodstained from the battle he has fought to get this far. Zilong and Zhang Bao drive through the Wei soldiers to the northwest, and then see the disorientated troops suddenly abandon their arms and flee at the sight of yet another force coming to Zilong’s rescue. This time it is Guan Xing. The two rescuers report to Zilong that they have been detailed to help Zilong and that this is why they are here. Zilong’s response is not to say thank you but instead: ‘Let’s go for Xiahou Mao now and finish this off once and for all.’ And so they do, and that very night the Wei army is finally defeated. Xiahou Mao escapes to Nan’an but is closely followed by Zhang Bao and Guan Xing, who then besiege the city. For ten days they and Zhao Zilong and Deng Zhi try to capture the city, but to no avail.","The ambush laid, Xiahou Mao advanced once more to attack, drums rolling and flags flying. As soon as he appeared, Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi went to meet him. Deng Zhi said, “The army of Wei were beaten only yesterday. This renewed attempt must mean that they are trying some trick. You should be cautious, General.” “I do not think this youth, with the smell of mother's milk still on his lips, worth talking about. We shall surely capture him today.” Zhao Yun pranced out, and Pan Sui came to meet him from the side of Wei. But Pan Sui made no stand and quickly ran away. Zhao Yun plunged in to try to capture Xiahou Mao. Then there came out to stop him no less than eight generals of Wei, all of whom passed in front of Xiahou Mao. But one by one they too fled. Zhao Yun pressed forward at full speed, Deng Zhi coming up behind. When Zhao Yun had got deeply involved, with the battle raging all around him, Deng Zhi decided to retire. This was the signal for the ambush to come out, Dong Xi from the right and Xue Ze from the left. Deng Zhi was so hampered that he could not attempt to rescue his colleague. Zhao Yun was thus entirely surrounded. However, he struggled on, losing men at every dash, till he had but one thousand troops left. He was then at the foot of the hill whence Xiahou Mao was directing operations, and observing his enemy from this point of vantage, Xiahou Mao sent troops to check Zhao Yun whithersoever he went. Zhao Yun decided to charge up the hill, but was stopped by rolling bulks of timber and tumbling rocks. The battle had lasted long, and Zhao Yun was fatigued. So he halted to rest a time, intending to renew the struggle when the moon should be up. But just as he had taken off his armor the moon rose and, with it, his enemies began to attack with fire as well, and the thunder of the drums was accompanied by showers of stones and arrows. The oncoming host shouted, “Zhao Yun! Why don't dismount and be bound?” However, Zhao Yun did not think of that, but got upon his steed to strive once more to extricate himself. And his enemies pressed closer and closer, pouring in flights and flights of arrows. No advance was possible, and the end seemed very near. “I refused the repose of age,” sighed he, “and now my end will come to me here!” Just then he heard new shouting from the northeast, and the array of Wei became disordered. To his joy, Zhao Yun saw Zhang Bao coming toward him, the octane-serpent halberd in his hand, and a man's head hanging at his bridle. Soon Zhang Bao reached the veteran general's side and cried, “The Prime Minister feared some misfortune had befallen you, so he sent me to your help; I have five thousand troops here. We heard that you were surrounded. On the way I met Xue Ze and slew him.” Zhao Yun's courage revived, and he and the young general went on toward the southwest, driving the soldiers of Wei before them in disorder. Soon another cohort came in from the side, the leader wielding the green-dragon saber. This was Guan Xing, and he cried, “The Prime Minister sent me with five thousand troops to your aid. On the way I encountered Dong Xi and slain him. Here is his head; and the Prime Minister is coming up too.” “But why not press on to capture Xiahou Mao since you have had such wonderful success?” cried Zhao Yun. Zhang Bao took the hint and went forward. Guan Xing followed. “They are as my own children,” said Zhao Yun to those who stood near. “And they press on wherever there is merit to be won. I am an old leader and high in rank, but I am not worth so much as these two youths. Yet will I risk my life once more for the sake of my old lord the First Ruler.” So he led the remnant of his troops to try to capture Xiahou Mao. During that night the army of Wei was smitten till corpses covered the earth and gore ran in rivers. Xiahou Mao was unskillful, and young, and inexperienced in battle. His army was in utter rout, and he could not think but only flee. At the head of a hundred cavalries, he made for Nanan. His army, leaderless, scattered like rats. Zhang Bao and Guan Xing set out for Nanan. At the news of their coming, Xiahou Mao closed the city gates and urged his soldiers to defend. Zhao Yun soon joined the generals, and they attacked on three sides. Deng Zhi arrived also, and the city was quite surrounded. After vain efforts for ten days, they heard the news: “The Prime Minister has stationed the rear army in Mianyang, the left army in Yangping Pass, the right army in Shicheng. He himself is leading the central army toward Nanan.” The four generals went to visit Zhuge Liang and told him their failure at the city."
却說張郃與夏侯尚來見夏侯淵，說：“天蕩山已失，折了夏侯德、韓浩。今聞劉備親自領兵來取漢中，可速奏魏王，早發精兵猛將，前來策應。”夏侯淵便差人報知曹洪。洪星夜前到許昌，稟知曹操。操大驚，急聚文武，商議發兵救漢中。長史劉曄進曰：“漢中若失，中原震動。大王休辭勞苦，必須親自征討。”操自悔曰：“恨當時不用卿言，以致如此！”忙傳令旨，起兵四十萬親征。時建安二十三年秋七月也。曹操兵分三路而進：前部先鋒夏侯惇，操自領中軍，使曹休押後，三軍陸續起行。操騎白馬金鞍，玉帶錦衣。武士手執大紅羅銷金傘蓋。左右金瓜銀鉞，鐙棒戈矛，打日月龍鳳旌旗。護駕龍虎官軍二萬五千，分為五隊：每隊五千，按靑、黃、赤、白、黑五色，旗旛甲馬，並依本色：光輝燦爛，極其雄壯。,"However, Zhang He and Xiahou Shang came to see Xiahou Yuan and said, ""Tiandang Mountain has been lost, and Xiahou De and Han Hao have been destroyed. Now that I heard that Liu Bei personally led troops to take Hanzhong, I can quickly play the King of Wei, and send out elite soldiers and generals to come to respond. ""Xiahou Yuan sent someone to report to Cao Hong. Hong Xing went to Xuchang a night ago to inform Cao Cao. Cao was shocked, and hurriedly gathered in the civil and military to discuss sending troops to rescue Hanzhong. Liu Yejin, the chief historian, said: ""If Hanzhong is lost, the Central Plains will be shaken. Your Majesty will quit his hard work and must conquer it himself."" Cao regretted and said, ""I hate that I didn't have to speak at that time, so that's why!"" It was also the autumn and July of the twenty-third year of Jian'an. Cao Cao's troops advanced in three directions: Xiahou Dun, the pioneer in the front, led the central army by himself, and Cao Xiu was escorted, and the three armies set off one after another. Cao rides a white horse with golden saddle, jade belt and brocade clothes. The samurai holds a big red rose pin gold umbrella cover. Left and right gourds and silver tomahawks, stirrup sticks and spears, and fight the sun, moon, dragon and phoenix flags. The 25,000 official army escorting dragons and tigers is divided into five teams: each team is 5,000, according to the five colors of yellow, yellow, red, white and black, with flags, banners and horses, and according to their true colors: radiant and extremely majestic.","When news of the fall of Tiandang mountain is brought to Cao Cao, he calls an urgent meeting to discuss how to save Hanzhong. The advice is that he will have to lead the troops himself. ‘If Hanzhong falls, the whole of Wei will be at risk of collapse,’ says Liu Ye. So it is that, within a few days, Cao Cao rides out leading an army of four hundred thousand men. And what a grand sight they make! Cao Cao on his grey horse, wearing rich clothing, with a gilt saddle and covered by a glittering canopy of red silk. To either side of him, ritual symbols in gold and silver of his regal status. Around him ride a private escort of twenty-five thousand, all elaborately colour-coded to symbolize the power of the cosmos and seasons.","The refugees, Zhang He and Xiahou Shang, reached Xiahou Yuan's camp and told their doleful tale, “Tiandang Mountain has been captured, and Xiahou De and Han Hao have died with the loss. Liu Bei is about to invade Hanzhong. Send a swift messenger to inform the Prince of Wei and ask for help.” The news was sent to Cao Hong, who bore it quickly to Capital Xuchang. Cao Cao lost no time in calling a council. Then High Minister Liu Ye said, “The loss of Hanzhong would shake the whole country. You, O Prince, must not shrink from toil and hardship, but must yourself go to lead the army.” “This state of things comes of my not heeding your words before, gentle Sir,” said Cao Cao, then repentant. However, Cao Cao hastily prepared and issued an edict to raise an army of four hundred thousand troops which he would lead. The army was ready in the seventh month, the early autumn, in the twenty-third year (AD 218), and marched in three divisions. The leading division was under Xiahou Dun, Cao Cao commanded the center, and Cao Xiu was the rear guard. Cao Cao rode a white horse, beautifully caparisoned. His guards were clad in embroidered silk. They carried the huge red parasol woven of silk and gold threads. Beside him in two lines were the symbols of kingly dignity, the golden melons, silver axes, stirrups, clubs, spears, and lances; banderoles embroidered with the sun and moon, dragon and phoenix, all were borne aloft. His escort of twenty-five thousand stout warriors led by bold officers, marched in five columns of five thousand each, under banners of the five colors, blue, yellow, red, white, and black. The five companies made a brave show as they marched, each column under its own flag with soldiers in armor and horses in caparisons all of one color and all glittering in the sun."
馳書報入成都。後主劉禪遣使回賀，吳使薛珝答禮。珝自蜀中歸，吳主孫休問蜀中近日作何舉動。珝奏曰：“近日中常侍黃皓用事，公卿多阿附之。入其朝，不聞直言；經其野，民有菜色。所謂‘燕雀處堂，不知大廈之將焚’者也。”休歎曰：“若諸葛武侯在時，何至如此乎！”於是又寫國書，敎人齎入成都，說司馬昭不日篡魏，必將侵吳、蜀以示威，彼此各宜準備。,"Chi Shu reported to Chengdu. The later master Liu Shan sent an envoy to congratulate him, and Wu envoy Xue Jue responded. When Kui returned from Shuzhong, Sun Xiu, the master of Wu, asked Shuzhong what he was doing recently. Kuo said: ""In recent days, Huang Hao has been often serving Huang Hao, and many ministers have attached him to him. When he entered his court, he did not listen to his outspoken words; after his wild life, the people had dishes. The so-called 'the bird is in the hall, and the building will be burned' is also known."" He sighed and said, ""If Marquis Wu of Zhuge was here, why would this be so!"" Then he wrote a national letter and sent people to Chengdu, saying that Sima Zhao would not usurp Wei in the near future, and he would invade Wu and Shu for demonstrations. .","When the second ruler of Shu, Liu Shan, hears of these events, he sends a message of congratulations. In response, Sun Xiu sends his own envoy to Shu. When the messenger returns to Wu, Sun Xiu asks how things stand in Shu. He is informed that the country is falling apart due to the corruption of the eunuchs, the dishonesty of the court and the poverty of the people as a result. ‘This is an example,’ says the messenger, Xue Xu, ‘of sparrows in the roof unaware that the building is about to be burned down!’ Another messenger comes back to Shu to inform the second ruler that, in the opinion of the Wu, Sima Zhao is about to seize imperial power in Wei and that both Shu and Wu should be prepared for any military fallout.","News of this revolution was sent into Chengdu, and the Latter Ruler sent an envoy into Wu with felicitations. In return, the Ruler of Wu sent Xue Xu as his envoy to Shu. When Xue Xu returned, the Ruler of Wu questioned about affairs in the west, and Xue Xu said, “All affairs of state are in the hands of a certain eunuch named Huang Hao, and all the courtiers look up to him as to a father. At court plain truth is never heard, and the country people look sallow and starved. The whole country appears on the verge of destruction. The birds on the roof do not know that the building is about to be burned.” “Ah ! If only Zhuge Liang the Martial Lord was still alive; how different all would be!” said Sun Xiu, with a sigh. Letters were prepared saying that beyond doubt Sima Zhao intended usurpation, and when that came about in Wei, both Wu and Shu would be invaded."
却說姜維令夏侯霸為前部，先引一軍逕取洮陽。霸提兵前進，將近洮陽，望見城上並無一桿旌旗，四門大開。霸心下疑惑，未敢入城，回顧諸將曰：“莫非詐乎？”諸將曰：“眼見得是空城，只有些小百姓，聽知大將軍兵到，盡棄城而去了。”霸未信，自縱馬於城南視之，只見城後老小無數，皆望西北而逃。霸大喜曰：“果空城也。”遂當先殺入，餘衆隨後而進。方到甕城邊，忽然一聲礮響，城上鼓角齊鳴，旄旗遍豎，拽起弔橋。霸大驚曰：“誤中計矣！”慌欲退時，城上矢石如雨。可憐夏侯霸同五百軍，皆死於城下。後人有詩歎曰：,"However, Jiang Wei ordered Xiahou Ba to be the front, and led an army to take Taoyang first. Ba Ti's troops advanced, approaching Taoyang, and saw that there was no flag on the city, and the four gates were wide open. Ba Wei was puzzled and did not dare to enter the city. He looked back at the generals and said, ""Isn't it a fraud?"" The generals said, ""I saw that the city was empty. There were only some small people. When I heard that the general's troops were coming, they abandoned the city and left."" Xin, since he was looking at him from the south of the city, he saw countless old and young people behind the city, all looking to the northwest and fleeing. Ba Da rejoiced and said, ""It's an empty city."" So he should attack first, and the rest of the crowd followed. Fang arrived at the edge of the city, and suddenly there was a loud bang, the drums and horns on the city rang in unison, the flags were erected everywhere, and the suspension bridge was pulled up. Ba Da was startled and said, ""I made a mistake!"" When he was about to retreat, arrows and rocks on the city were like rain. Poor Xiahou Ba and his five hundred troops all died under the city. A later poem sighed and said:","Xiahou Ba is sent to take Taoyang and, arriving there, finds it deserted, and people fleeing out of the back gate. However, entering into the city, he finds himself in a trap. Soldiers suddenly appear on the walls and, closing the gates, slaughter the Shu soldiers trapped inside. Here Xiahou Ba himself perishes, along with almost all his men. Encouraged by this, Deng Ai launches a night raid on Jiang Wei’s camp, which throws the Shu army into chaos.","Meanwhile Xiahou Ba led the van of the Shu army toward Taoyang. As he drew near, he noticed the place seemed to have no defenses; not a flag staff reared its head. The gates stood wide open. He was too wary to go straight in however, and said, “Is there any ruse in there?” His generals said, “We think the city was deserted when they heard your army coming. A few people were running away along the southern road.” Xiahou Ba rode south and saw there that the northwest road, at a little distance from the city, was crowded with fugitives. “The city is really empty,” said Xiahou Ba. He led the way in all ready to fight, and the troops followed. As they came near to the curtain wall, however, a bomb exploded. At this sound the drums beat, trumpets blared, and flags suddenly appeared. At the same moment the drawbridge rose. “Caught!” said Xiahou Ba. As he turned to retire, the arrows and stones flew down in clouds, and under these Xiahou Ba and many of his soldiers lost their lives. Most able strategist and brave,"
先主正慌急之間——此時天色已微明——只見前面喊聲震天，朱然軍紛紛落澗，滾滾投巖：一彪軍殺入，前來救駕。先主大喜；視之：乃常山趙子龍也。時趙雲在川中江州，聞吳、蜀交兵，遂引軍出；忽見東南一帶火光沖天，雲心驚，遠遠探視：不想先主被困，雲奮勇衝殺而來。陸遜聞是趙雲，忽令軍退。雲正殺之間，忽遇朱然，便與交鋒；不一合，一鎗刺朱然於馬下，殺散吳兵，救出先主，望白帝城而走。先主曰：“朕雖得脫，諸將士將奈何？”雲曰：“敵軍在後，不可久遲。陛下且入白帝城歇息，臣再引兵去救應諸將。”此時先主僅存百餘人入白帝城。後人有詩讚陸遜曰：,"The First Sovereign was in a hurry—at this time the sky was already twilight—I saw the shouts in front of the sky, and Zhu Ran’s army fell into the stream one after another, rolling into the rocks: A Biao army rushed in and came to rescue. The First Sovereign was overjoyed; he saw it: It was Zhao Zilong of Changshan. At that time, Zhao Yun was in Jiangzhou in the middle of Sichuan, and when he heard that Wu and Shu were fighting, he led his troops out. Suddenly, when he saw the fire in the southeast, Yun was shocked and visited him from a distance. Lu Xun heard that it was Zhao Yun, and suddenly ordered the army to retreat. While Yun was killing him, he suddenly encountered Zhu Ran, and he confronted him; when he did not meet, he stabbed Zhu Ran under his horse, killed the Wu soldiers, rescued the First Sovereign, and walked away looking at Baidi City. The First Sovereign said: ""Even though I can escape, what will the soldiers and generals do?"" Yun said, ""The enemy army is behind, so don't delay for a long time. Your Majesty will enter the Baidi City to rest, and then the ministers will lead the troops to rescue the generals."" The Lord left only a hundred people to enter Baidi City. Later generations have a poem to praise Lu Xun, saying:","Before his eyes the first ruler sees Zhu Ran’s men disappear as a troop slashes its way through, led by none other than Zhao Zilong. News of his arrival leads Lu Xun to cease the pursuit and to withdraw his men. In the mêlée Zhao Zilong slays Zhu Ran, rescues the first ruler and heads for safety to Baidi. By this stage, there are but a hundred or so men with the first ruler. Protecting his retreat is Fu Tong, but he is swiftly overwhelmed by Wu troops led by Ding Feng, who lies, telling him Xuande is a prisoner.","About the first glimpse of dawn the case seemed quite desperate. But just at the worst they saw Zhu Ran's soldiers suddenly begin to break up and scatter, tumbling into streams and rolling down precipices. Soon the reason was evident: a fearsome general leading a cohort came to their relief. Once again the First Ruler was rescued from pressing danger, and this time the rescuer was Zhao Yun. He had been in Jiangzhou, and news of the straits of his lord had reached him there. He had set out forthwith. Then he had seen the glow of the burnings and had marched toward it. And thus he had arrived just at the moment to save his master when danger was most imminent. As soon as Lu Xun heard that Zhao Yun had appeared, he ordered his troops to stop pursuit and retire. Zhao Yun happening upon Zhu Ran, engaged him forthwith and in the first encounter slew Zhu Ran with a spear thrust. And so the army of Wu were dispersed and retired, and the First Ruler got safely to the wall of Baidicheng. But on the way thither his thoughts went back to his companions in misfortune, and he inquired after them anxiously. “Though I am safe, how about the other generals and soldiers?” asked the First Ruler. “The pursuers are close upon us, and we cannot wait for anything,” said Zhao Yun. “I wish Your Majesty to get into the city as quickly as possible; and while you are reposing yourself, we may try to rescue some of the leaders.” When the First Ruler entered Baidicheng, he was in sore straits, only having about a hundred men left. A poet wrote concerning this victory of Lu Xun:"
却說郭、孫二人走脫，回見司馬懿曰：“武都、陰平二郡已失。孔明伏於要路，前後攻殺，因此大敗，棄馬步行，方得逃回。”懿曰：“非汝等之罪：孔明智在吾先。可再引兵守把雍、郿二城，切勿出戰。吾自有破敵之策。”二人拜辭而去。懿又喚張郃、戴陵分付曰：“今孔明得了武都、陰平，必然撫百姓以安民心，不在營中矣。汝二人各引一萬精兵，今夜起身，抄在蜀兵營後，一齊奮勇殺將過來；吾却引軍在前布陣，只待蜀兵勢亂，吾大驅士馬，攻殺進去：兩軍併力，可奪蜀寨也。若得此地山勢，破敵何難？”二人受計引兵而去。戴陵在左，張郃在右，各取小路進發，深入蜀兵之後。三更時分，來到大路，兩軍相遇，合兵一處，却從蜀兵背後殺來。行不到三十里，前軍不行。張、戴二人自縱馬視之，只見數百輛草車橫截去路。郃曰：“此必有準備。可急取路而回。”纔傳令退軍，只見滿山火光齊明，鼓角大震，伏兵四下皆出，把二人圍住。孔明在祁山上大叫曰：“戴陵、張郃可聽吾言：司馬懿料吾往武都、陰平撫民，不在營中，故令汝二人來劫吾寨，却中吾之計也。汝二人乃無名下將，吾不殺害，下馬早降！”郃大怒，指孔明而罵曰：“汝乃山野村夫，侵吾大國境界，如何敢發此言！吾若捉住汝時，碎屍萬段！”言訖，縱馬挺鎗，殺上山來。山上矢石如雨。郃不能上山，乃拍馬舞鎗，衝出重圍，無人敢當。蜀兵困戴陵在垓心。郃殺出舊路，不見戴陵，卽奮勇翻身又殺入重圍，救出戴陵而回。孔明在山上，見郃在萬軍之中，往來衝突，英勇倍加，乃謂左右曰：“嘗聞張翼德大戰張郃，人皆驚懼。吾今日見之，方知其勇也。若留下此人，必為蜀中之害。吾當除之。”遂收兵還營。,"But they said that Guo and Sun had escaped, and when they returned to see Sima Yi, they said, ""Wudu and Yinping have been lost. Kong Ming was on the main road and attacked and killed before and after, so he was defeated. : ""It's not your fault: Kong Mingming is ahead of me. You can lead troops to guard the Yong and Ji cities, and don't go out to battle. I have my own strategy to defeat the enemy."" The two said goodbye and left. Yi also called Zhang He and Dai Ling to pay them separately and said, ""Now that Kongming has gained Wudu and Yinping, he will surely appease the people to reassure them, and they will not be in the camp. You two will each lead 10,000 elite soldiers, get up tonight and take them behind the Shu barracks. Together we fought bravely to kill the generals, but I led the army to set up a formation in front, and I only waited for the chaos of the Shu army, and I drove the soldiers and horses to attack and attack: the two armies can take over the village of Shu. What's the problem?"" The two of them were led away by the plan. Dai Ling was on the left and Zhang He was on the right. At the third watch, when they came to the main road, the two armies met and joined forces, but they came from behind the Shu soldiers. If you can travel less than thirty miles, the former army will not be able to. Zhang and Dai watched from the horse, only to see hundreds of grass carts crossing the road. He said: ""You must be prepared for this. You can quickly take the road and return."" Only then did he send the order to retreat. He saw that the whole mountain was full of fire, the drums were shaking, and the ambush soldiers came out from all directions, surrounding the two. Kong Ming shouted on the Qishan Mountain, ""Dai Ling and Zhang He can listen to me: Sima Yi expected that I would go to Wudu and Yinping to pacify the people, and I was not in the camp, so I ordered you two to rob my village, but it was my plan. The two of you are unnamed generals, I will not kill them, I will dismount as soon as possible!"" He was furious, pointed at Kong Ming and scolded, ""You are a villager in the mountains, and invade the realm of my great country, how dare you say this! If I catch you , the corpse is broken into ten thousand pieces!"" After saying this, he shot up the mountain with his horse and spear. The arrows and stones on the mountain are like rain. He couldn't go up the mountain, so he beat his horse and danced his spear to break out of the siege. No one dared to stand up to him. Shu soldiers trapped Dai Ling in Gai Xin. He went out of the old way, but Dai Ling was nowhere to be seen. He bravely turned over and entered the siege, rescued Dai Ling and returned. Kong Ming was on the mountain, and when he saw He was among the ten thousand armies, the conflict between the exchanges and the heroism increased, he said to the left and right: ""I heard that Zhang Yide fought against Zhang He, and everyone was terrified. When I see it today, I will know his bravery. If I leave this person behind. , it will be a harm to Shu. I should get rid of it."" Then he withdrew his troops and returned to the camp.","Sima Yi sends a relief force to aid the besieged towns of Wudu and Yinping, only for that force to discover that Kong Ming has taken the two towns and that they are trapped between different groups of Shu troops.","It has been said that Guo Huai and Sun Li escaped. They got back to Sima Yi's camp and said, “Wudu and Yinping were both in the enemy's possession, and Zhuge Liang had prepared an ambush, so that we were attacked front and rear. We lost the day and only escaped on foot.” “It is no fault of yours,” said Sima Yi. “The fact is he is sharper than I. Now go to defend Yongcheng and Meicheng and remain on the defensive; do not go out to give battle. I have a plan to defeat them.” These two having left, Sima Yi called in Zhang He and Dai Ling and said, “Zhuge Liang has captured Wudu and Yinping. He must restore order and confidence among the people of these places and so will be absent from his camp. You two will take ten thousand troops each, start tonight and make your way quietly to the rear of the Shu army. Then you will attack vigorously. When you have done that, I shall lead out the army in front of them and array ready for battle. While they are in disorder, I shall make my attack. Their camp ought to be captured. If I can win the advantage of these hills, their defeat will be easy.” These two left, Dai Ling marching on the left and Zhang He on the right. They took by-roads and got well to the rear of the Shu army. In the third watch they struck the high road and joined forces. Then they marched toward the enemy. After about ten miles there was a halt in front. The two leaders galloped up to see what had caused it, and found many straw-carts drawn across the road. “The enemy has been prepared,” said Zhang He. “We should return.” Just as they ordered the troops to turn about, torches broke into flame all over the hills, the drums rolled, trumpets blared, and soldiers sprang out on every side. At the same time Zhuge Liang shouted from the hill-top, “Dai Ling and Zhang He, listen to my words! Your master reckoned that I should be busy restoring order in the two cities and so should not be in my camp. Wherefore he sent you to take the camp, and you have just fallen into my snare. As you are leaders of no great importance, I shall not harm you. Dismount and yield.” Zhang He's wrath blazed forth at this, and he pointed at Zhuge Liang, crying, “You peasant out of the woods, invader of our great country! How dare you use such words to me? Wait till I catch you; I will tear you to shreds.” He galloped forward to ascend the hill, his spear ready for the thrust. But the arrows and stones pelted too quickly. Then he turned and dashed in among the Shu soldiers, scattering them right and left. He got clear, but he saw Dai Ling was not with him. At once he turned back, fought his way to his comrade and brought Dai Ling out safely. Zhuge Liang on the hill-top watched this warrior and saw he was a right doughty fighting man. “I have heard that soldiers stood aghast when Zhang Fei fought his great fight with Zhang He. Now I can judge Zhang He's valor for myself. He will do harm to Shu one day if I spare him. He will have to be removed.” Then Zhuge Liang returned to his camp."
公亦與泣別。遂留周倉與王甫同守麥城。關公自與關平、趙累引殘卒二百餘人，突出北門。關公橫刀前進。行至初更以後，約走二十餘里，只見山凹處，金鼓齊鳴，喊聲大震，一彪軍到：為首大將朱然，驟馬挺鎗叫曰：“雲長休走！趁早投降，免得一死！”公大怒，拍馬輪刀來戰。朱然便走，公乘勢追殺。一棒鼓響，四下伏兵皆起。公不敢戰，望臨沮小路而走。朱然率兵掩殺。關公所隨之兵，漸漸稀少。走不得四五里，前面喊聲又震，火光大起，潘璋驟馬舞刀殺來。公大怒，輪刀相迎；只三合，潘璋敗走。公不敢戀戰，急望山路而走。背後關平趕來，報說趙累已死於亂軍中。關公不勝悲惶，遂令關平斷後，公自在前開路，隨行止剩得十餘人。行至決石，兩下是山，山邊皆蘆葦敗草，樹木叢雜。時已五更將盡。正走之間，一聲喊起，兩下伏兵盡出，長鈎套索，一齊並舉，先把關公坐下馬絆倒。關公翻身落馬，被潘璋部將馬忠所獲。關平知父被擒，火速來救；背後潘璋、朱然率兵齊至，把關平四下圍住。平孤身獨戰，力盡亦被執。至天明，孫權聞關公父子已被擒獲，大喜，聚衆將於帳中。,"The public also said goodbye. Then he left Zhou Cang and Wang Fu to guard Maicheng. Guan Gongzi, Guan Ping and Zhao Lei led more than 200 disabled soldiers to stand out at the North Gate. Guan Gong slashed forward. After the first watch, after walking for about twenty li, I saw that in the valley of the mountain, the golden drums were sounding in unison, and the shouts were loud, and a biao army arrived: Zhu Ran, the leader of the general, suddenly raised his spear and shouted: ""Yun Changxiu. Let's go! Surrender as soon as possible to avoid death!"" The Duke was furious and slapped the horse wheel knife to fight. Zhu Ran left, and the public chased after him. A drum sounded, and all the soldiers were ambushed. Gong did not dare to fight, and walked away looking at Ju Xiaolu. Zhu Ran led his troops to cover up. Guan Gongsuo followed, and gradually became scarce. He couldn't walk for four or five miles, and the shouts in front of him shook again, and the fire broke out, and Pan Zhang rushed to kill him with a sword and a horse. The Duke was furious, and the swordsmen greeted him; only three times, Pan Zhang was defeated and left. The man did not dare to fight in love, so he eagerly looked at the mountain road and walked away. Guan Ping came from behind and reported that Zhao Lei had died in the chaos of the army. Guan Gong was very distressed, so after Guan Ping was cut off, Gong Zi opened the way forward, and there were more than ten people left. Going to Jueshi, there are mountains on both sides. The sides of the mountains are full of reeds and grasses, and the trees are mixed. The time has come to the end of five. As they were walking, they shouted, and two ambush soldiers came out, long hooks and nooses, all together, first to trip Guan Gong on his horse. Guan Gong fell from his horse and was captured by Pan Zhang's subordinate Ma Zhong. Guan Ping knew his father was captured and came to the rescue quickly; Pan Zhang and Zhu Ran led troops from behind to surround Guan Ping. Ping fights alone, even if he does his best. At dawn, Sun Quan heard that Guan Gong and his son had been captured. He was overjoyed, and the crowd gathered in the tent.","and prepares to charge forth, leaving just one hundred men with Wang Fu to hold the town until help can arrive. So, with just two hundred men, Guan Yu, Guan Ping and Zhao Lei surge out of the north gate at the dead of night, ready for action. Having gone unchallenged for a few miles north, they are suddenly attacked by Zhu Ran. But when he is attacked by Guan Yu, he flees north, drawing the party on. Now Guan Yu has not gone far when more of Zhu Ran’s men suddenly charge. Seeing no way forward, Guan Yu turns and gallops off down a minor road towards Linju. Zhu Ran overwhelms the rearguard and rides off after the fleeing Guan Yu. Charging ahead, Guan Yu runs into the second ambush set by Pan Zhang. Guan Yu’s valiant attacks soon force him to flee. But by now Guan Yu is exhausted. Riding hard, he is reunited with Guan Ping, who has been defending the rear. He has to report that Zhao Lei has been killed. Weary and worn down by sorrow, Guan Yu rides on with no more than a dozen men still with him. It is as they enter a very narrow valley that the end comes. Overgrown with bushes and long grass, this desolate place is where, as dawn begins to appear, they are attacked for the third time. On this occasion, they are attacked with grappling hooks and nets set there by Ma Zhong. Guan Yu’s mighty steed, Red Hare, is brought crashing down, and Guan Yu is thrown to the ground. Bravely Guan Ping rides to his father’s rescue, but it’s no good. He fights on until he has no strength left, desperately trying to reach and free his father. Exhausted at last, he too is captured. Both men, father and son, are now prisoners of the Wu.","The two parted in tears; Wang Fu and Zhou Cang remaining to guard Maicheng. Guan Yu, Guan Ping, and Zhao Lei marched with their weak force out of the north gate. Guan Yu, his green-dragon saber ready to hand, went first. About the third watch, seven miles lay between them and the city. There they saw a deep cleft in the hills wherefrom rolled the sound of beaten drums. And men were shouting. Soon appeared a large force with Zhu Ran at their head. He came dashing forward, and summoned the small party, saying, “Guan Yu, do not run! Surrender and live!” But Guan Yu whipped his steed to a gallop and bore down on the leader with anger in his eyes. Then Zhu Ran ran away. Guan Yu followed him till there came the loud boom of a large drum, and out sprang troops from all sides. Guan Yu dared not engage such a number, and fled in the direction of Linju. Zhu Ran came up behind and attacked the flying soldiers, so that Guan Yu's following gradually became smaller and smaller. Still he struggled on. A few miles farther the drums rolled again, and torches lit up all round. This was Pan Zhang's ambush, and he appeared flourishing his sword. Guan Yu whirled his blade and went to meet him, but Pan Zhang ran away after a couple of bouts. However, Guan Yu saw they were too many for him, and sought refuge among the mountains. His son followed, and when he got within speaking distance, Guan Ping gave him the mournful tidings: “Zhao Lei has fallen in the melee!” Guan Yu was very sad, and bade his son try to protect the rear while he should force his way forward. With about ten men he reached Zhuxi, a place with mountains on both sides. At their foot was a thick mass of reeds and dried grass. The trees grew very close. It was then the fifth watch. Presently the small party stumbled into another ambush, and the ambushing soldiers thrust forth hooks and threw ropes. Entangled in these, Guan Yu's horse fell, and Guan Yu reeled out of the saddle. In a moment Ma Zhong, the Marching General of Pan Zhang, made him a prisoner. Guan Ping dashed to his rescue, but before he could do anything, he also was surrounded and held. Father and son were both captives. With great joy Sun Quan heard of the success of his plans. In the morning, he assembled all his officers in his tent to await the arrival of the prisoners."
早有細作報知孫權。權聚衆將商議。張昭曰：“可差人往魯子敬處，敎急發書到荊州，使玄德同力拒曹。子敬有恩於玄德，其言必從；且玄德旣為東吳之壻，亦義不容辭，若玄德來相助，江南可無患矣。”權從其言，卽遣人諭魯肅，使求救於玄德。肅領命，隨卽修書使人送玄德。玄德看了書中之意，留使者於館舍，差人往南郡請孔明。孔明到荊州，玄德將魯肅書與孔明看畢。孔明曰：“也不消動江南之兵，也不必動荊州之兵，自使曹操不敢正覷東南。”便回書與魯肅，敎：“高枕無憂：若但有北兵侵犯，皇叔自有退兵之策。”使者去了。玄德問曰：“今操起三十萬大軍，會合淝之衆，一擁而來，先生有何妙計，可以退之？”孔明曰：“操平生所慮者，乃西涼之兵也。今操殺馬騰，其子馬超，見統西涼之衆，必切齒操賊。主公可作一書，往結馬超，使超興兵入關，則操又何暇下江南乎？”玄德大喜，卽時作書，遣一心腹人，逕往西涼州投下。,"Sun Quan had been informed of the detailed report long ago. Quan Juzhong will discuss. Zhang Zhao said: ""You can send someone to Lu Zijing and send a letter to Jingzhou urgently, so that Xuande can resist Cao with the same force. Zijing is kind to Xuande, and he will obey his words; and Xuande is a member of Eastern Wu. Yan, it is also incumbent on him, if Xuande comes to help, Jiangnan will be safe."" Quan followed his words, and Yan sent someone to Lu Su to ask Xuande for help. Shou led the order, followed by repairing the book and sent people to Xuande. Xuande read the meaning of the book, left the envoy in the hall, and sent to Nanjun to invite Kongming. When Kong Ming arrived in Jingzhou, Xuande read Lu Sushu and Kong Ming. Kong Ming said, ""I don't need to move the troops from Jiangnan, nor do I need to move the troops from Jingzhou. I will make Cao Cao not dare to look directly at the southeast."" Retreat."" The messenger went. Xuande asked, ""Now that we have raised an army of 300,000 people to join the crowd of Fei and come in a crowd, what is your master plan to retreat?"" Kong Ming said, ""What Cao has worried about in his life is the army of Xiliang. Now, Cao kills Ma Teng, and his son Ma Chao, who sees the people in control of the Western Liang Dynasty, will cut his teeth and fight the thieves. The lord can write a book, go to Ma Chao, and make Chao Xing soldiers enter the pass, then why should Cao go to the south of the Yangtze River?"" Xuan De was overjoyed, and when he wrote a book, he sent a confidant and went straight to Xiliang Prefecture.","When the news reaches Sun Quan, he, of course, asks Lu Su to speak to Xuande and to create a joint front. Lu Su writes to Xuande proposing this, and Xuande consults Kong Ming. ‘Don’t lose sleep over these northerners,’ says Kong Ming. ‘I have a plan which means they’ll never get as far as invading the south.’ After the messenger leaves, Xuande asks what exactly this plan is that will protect Hefei from over three hundred thousand soldiers.","Sun Quan speedily heard of the move and called in his advisers. At the council Zhang Zhao said, “Let us send to Lu Su to tell him to write at once to Liu Bei that he may help us. They are good friends, and Liu Bei will certainly respond favorably. Beside, since Liu Bei and our lord are now connected by marriage, there is no risk of refusal. With the support of Liu Bei, there is no danger to our country.” Sun Quan listened to this advice and sent to Lu Su bidding him to ask help from Liu Bei. Accordingly, on receipt of this command, a letter was written to Liu Bei, who after reading it, retained the messenger at the guest-house till Zhuge Liang could arrive from Nanjun. As soon as he arrived, Liu Bei showed him the letter. The adviser said, “It is not necessary for the South Land's troops to move, nor need we send ours. I can prevent Cao Cao from even daring to look in the southeast direction.” So Zhuge Liang wrote a reply telling Lu Su: “You can lay aside all anxiety and rest content, for if the northern army approach, they will be forced backward at once.” The letter was given to the messenger, and then Liu Bei asked his adviser, “How could the Instructor hope to roll back the huge army of three hundred thousand troops that Cao Cao is preparing to bring south?” Zhuge Liang replied, “Cao Cao's chief fear is Xiliang. Now just lately he has slain Ma Teng and his sons as well, and the people of Xiliang are grinding their teeth with rage. Now you must write and ask Ma Chao to march through the pass, and Cao Cao will have no leisure to think of any expedition to the south.” The letter was written, sent by a trusty hand, and duly delivered. Now Ma Chao was in Xiliang."
却說蠻王孟獲，聽知孔明智破雍闓等，遂聚三洞元帥商議：第一洞乃金環三結元帥，第二洞乃董荼那元帥，第三洞乃阿會喃元帥。三洞元帥入見孟獲。獲曰：“今諸葛丞相領大軍來侵我境界，不得不併力敵之。汝三人可分兵三路而進。如得勝者，便為洞主。”於是分金環三結取中路，董荼那取左路，阿會喃取右路：各引五萬蠻兵，依令而行。,"However, Meng Huo, the barbarian king, heard that Kong Mingzhi had broken Yongkai and others, so he gathered the marshals of the three caves to discuss: the first cave was Marshal Jinhuan Sanjie, the second cave was Marshal Dong Dana, and the third cave was Marshal Ahuinan. Marshal Sandong came to see Meng Huo. Huo said: ""Prime Minister Zhuge is leading a large army to invade our realm, and we have to fight against them together. The three of you can divide your forces and advance in three ways. If you win, you will be the master of the cave."" Tuna took the left, Ah Huinan took the right: each led fifty thousand savages and followed orders.","The three chieftains come with some fifty thousand men each – Jinhuansanjie to take the central position in the attack, Dongtuna the left flank and Ahuinan the right flank.","When the King of the Mangs, Meng Huo, heard how cleverly Zhuge Liang had got rid of Yong Kai, he called together the leaders of the “Three Ravines” to discuss matters. The chief of the first Ravine was Jinhua Sanjie, of the second Dongtu Na, and of the third Ahui Nan. These having come to the King's place, he said to them, “Zhuge Liang and his Grand Army has invaded our country, and we must exert our united strength to drive out the invaders. You three must lead your forces, and whoever conquers the enemy shall be chief of chiefs.” It was arranged that Jinhua Sanjie should march in the center division, Dongtu Na on the left, and Ahui Nan on the right. Each division was fifty thousand tribesmen."

He was afraid of plotting or venting, but in the name of attacking Wu, he ordered the five places of Qi, Yan, Yu, Jing, and Yang to build large ships. Sima Zhao didn't know what he meant, so he summoned Zhong Hui and asked him, ""Why do you need to build a boat to close the river on a dry road?"" The Hui said, ""If Shu hears that our troops are advancing, they will ask for help from Eastern Wu. In the state of attacking Wu, Wu will not dare to act rashly. Within a year, Shu has been broken and the ship has been completed, and the attack on Wu will not go well?"" Zhao was overjoyed and chose to go to the army. At that time, in the fourth year of Wei Jingyuan, on the third day of the autumn and seventh lunar month, Zhong Hui left his apprenticeship. Sima Zhao sent it back ten miles outside the city. Xi Cao Shao Ti secretly told Sima Zhao, ""Today, the lord sent Zhong to lead a hundred thousand troops to attack Shu, and the fools will be ambitious and high-minded, and they should not be in power alone."" Zhao laughed and said, ""Don't I know this?"" Ti said. : ""My lord Yanzhi, why not let someone else take up his post?"" Zhao said countless words, which made Shao Ti's doubts abruptly relieved. Exactly:","‘Zhong Hui will confound the sceptics,’ says Sima Zhao, ‘who claim we cannot win in Shu, because he has a plan.","Zhong Hui marched as soon as he received his seal of office. Lest his real object should be known, he gave out that his force was directed against Wu; and to give color to the pretense, he had many large ships built in Qingzhou, Yanzhou, Yuzhou, Jingzhou, and Yangzhou. He also sent Tang Zi along the coastal regions of Dengzhou and Laizhou to collect vessels. Even his chief, Sima Zhao, was deceived and called him to ask why he was collecting ships. Zhong Hui replied, “If Shu hears that we intend to attack the west, they will ask assistance from Wu. So I pretend to attack Wu, and Wu will not dare to move under a year. When Shu is beaten, the ships will be ready and useful for an expedition into the East.” Sima Zhao was pleased. The day chosen for the march was the third day of the seventh mouth in the fourth year of Wonderful Beginning, in Wei calendar (AD 264). Sima Zhao escorted his leader out of the city for three miles and then took his leave. Shao Ti, Minister of the Western Affairs, whispered a word of warning. “My lord has sent Zhong Hui with a large army against Shu. I think he is too ambitious to be trusted with such powers?” “Think you I do not know?” said Sima Zhao. “Then why have you sent him alone and without a colleague?” Sima Zhao said a few words to Shao Ti which put his doubts at rest."

Sun Quan went very near the city walls of Huancheng to observe its defense, and a flight of arrows greeted him, some striking his great official parasol. He went back to camp and asked his officers to offer plans of attack. Then Dong Xi said, “Pile up great hills of earth and attack from the summits.” Said Xu Sheng, “Set up long ladders and construct platforms whence you can look over the city walls and thus attack.” But Lu Meng said, “All such plans need a long time to prepare, and in the meantime the soldiers of Cao Cao will arrive from Hefei. Do not try such long-drawn-out schemes, but take advantage of the fine, fresh spirit of our newly arrived troops and attack impetuously. Their elan will carry the wall. If you attack tomorrow at dawn, the city will fall before noon.” So the early meal was taken at the fifth watch, and the army went to the attack. The defenders sent down showers of arrows and stones. Gan Ning took an iron chain in his hand and climbed up the wall. They shot at him with bows and crossbows, but he turned aside the arrows and bolts, and he threw the chain round Governor Zhu Guang to pull him down. Lu Meng beat the drum for the attack. The soldiers made a rush forward to climb the wall, and they slew Zhu Guang. His officers and soldiers gave in, and so Huancheng fell to Sun Quan. It was still a long time to noon. In the meantime Zhang Liao was marching to the aid of the city. Half-way he heard that the city had fallen, and so he returned to Hefei."
次日，後主車駕親至相府。門吏見駕到，慌忙拜伏於地而迎。後主問曰：“丞相在何處？”門吏曰：“不知在何處。只有丞相鈞旨，敎擋住百官，勿得輒入。”後主乃下車步行，獨進第三重門，見孔明獨倚竹杖，在小池邊觀魚。後主在後立久，乃徐徐而言曰：“丞相安樂否？”孔明回顧，見是後主，慌忙棄杖，拜伏於地曰：“臣該萬死！”後主扶起，問曰：“今曹丕分兵五路，犯境甚急，相父緣何不肯出府視事？”孔明大笑，扶後主入內室坐定，奏曰：“五路兵至，臣安得不知？臣非觀魚，有所思也。”後主曰：“如之奈何？”孔明曰：“羌王軻比能，蠻王孟獲，反將孟達，魏將曹眞：此四路兵，臣已皆退去了也。止有孫權這一路兵，臣已有退之之計，但須一能言之人為使。因未得其人，故熟思之。陛下何必憂乎？”,"The next day, the main car drove to the prime minister's house in person. When the doorman saw the driver, he hurriedly bowed down to the ground and greeted him. The later master asked, ""Where is the prime minister?"" The doorman said, ""I don't know where it is. Only the prime minister issued a decree to block hundreds of officials, and do not allow anyone to enter."" , see Kong Ming leaning on a bamboo stick alone, watching the fish by the small pond. After the empress stood for a long time, he slowly said, ""Is the prime minister at peace?"" Kong Ming looked back and saw that he was the empress. He hurriedly abandoned his staff, bowed down to the ground, and said, ""This minister deserves to die!"" The empress raised him and asked, ""Now that Cao Pi has divided his troops into five routes, and the situation is very urgent, why didn't the father-in-law refuse to leave the house to see the matter?"" Kong Ming laughed loudly, and helped the queen to sit down in the inner room, and said, ""The troops of the five routes are coming, and I don't know how safe this minister is. The minister is not looking at the fish, but thinking about it."" The master said, ""What can I do?"" Kong Ming said, ""Ke Bineng, king of Qiang, Meng Huo, king of barbarians, Meng Da, general of Wei, Cao Zhen, general of Wei: these four-way soldiers The ministers have already retreated. As long as there are soldiers like Sun Quan, the ministers have plans to retreat, but they must be made by someone who can speak. Since I haven't got them, I think about them carefully. Why should your majesty worry?""","When the second ruler chastises him gently for not helping him when the situation is so critical, Kong Ming smiles and says: ‘I know all about these five armies. But don’t worry about them. I’ve sorted it all out already.’ He then tells the second ruler how, knowing where attacks will come and from whom, he has forestalled Cao Pi by getting in first.","And the next day the Emperor rode in his chariot to the gate of his minister. When the doorkeepers saw the imperial chariot appear, they fell upon their knees to welcome the Emperor. “Where is the Prime Minister?” asked he. “We do not know. But we have orders not to let in the crowd of officers.” The Emperor then descended and went on foot right in to the third gate. Then he saw Zhuge Liang leaning on a staff beside a fishpond looking at the fishes. The Latter Ruler approached, and stood behind him for a long time. Presently the Latter Ruler said slowly and with dignity, “Is the Prime Minister really enjoying himself?” Zhuge Liang started and looked round. When he saw who the speaker was, he suddenly dropped his staff and prostrated himself. “I ought to be put to death ten thousand times,” said Zhuge Liang. But the Emperor put forth his hand and helped him to rise, saying, “Cao Pi threatens immediate invasion from five points; why will you not come forth and attend to business?” Zhuge Liang laughed. He conducted the Emperor into an inner room, and, when he was seated, Zhuge Liang addressed the Emperor, saying, “Could it be possible that I was ignorant of these five armies? I was not looking at the fishes; I was thinking.” “But, this being so, what shall we do?” “I have already turned back that Kebi Neng of the Qiangs, and Meng Huo of the Mangs, and the rebel leader Meng Da, and the army from Wei. I have also thought out a plan to circumvent the army from Wu, but I need a special sort of person to carry it out. I want an envoy, an able talker, one capable of persuading other people. It was because I have not found such a person yet that I was so deeply in thought. But Your Majesty may set your mind at rest and not be anxious.”"

却說晉兵克了牛渚，深入吳境。王濬遣人馳報捷音。晉主炎聞知大喜，賈充奏曰：“吾兵久勞於外，不服水土，必生疾病。宜召軍還，再作後圖。”張華曰：“今大兵已入其巢，吳人膽落，不出一月，孫皓必擒矣。若輕召還，前功盡廢，誠可惜也。”晉主未及應，賈充叱華曰：“汝不省天時地利，欲妄邀功勣，困弊士卒，雖斬汝不足以謝天下！”炎曰：“此是朕意，華但與朕同耳，何必爭辯？”忽報杜預馳表到。晉主視表，亦言宜急進兵之意。晉主遂不復疑，竟下征進之命。王濬等奉了晉主之命，水陸並進，風雷鼓動，吳人望旗而降。吳主皓聞之，大驚失色。諸臣告曰：“北兵日近，江南軍民不戰而降，將如之何？”皓曰：“何故不戰？”衆對曰：“今日之禍，皆岑昏之罪，請陛下誅之。臣等出城決一死戰。”皓曰：“量一中貴，何能誤國？”衆大叫曰：“陛下豈不見蜀之黃皓乎？”遂不待吳主之命，一齊擁入宮中，碎割岑昏，生啖其肉。陶濬奏曰：“臣領戰船皆小，願得二萬兵乘大船以戰，自足破之。”皓從其言，遂撥御林諸軍與陶濬上流迎敵。前將軍張象，率水兵下江迎敵。二人部兵正行，不想西北風大起，吳兵旗幟，皆不能立，盡倒豎於舟中；兵各不肯下船，四散奔走，只有張象數十軍待敵。,"However, it was said that the Jin soldiers overcame Niu Zhu and went deep into the realm of Wu. Wang Jun sent people to report the good news. Yan, the ruler of Jin, was overjoyed to hear that, and Jia Chong said: ""My soldiers have been working outside for a long time, and they will not accept the soil and water, and they will definitely suffer from diseases. It is advisable to call the army back, and then make a later picture."" Zhang Hua said: ""The soldiers have entered their nests now. If the people of Wu fall courageously, within a month, Sun Hao will be captured. If he is called back lightly, his previous achievements will be lost, which is a pity."" Before the Jin master could respond, Jia Chong shouted at Hua: ""You don't take advantage of the time and place, and you want to be reckless. Accumulating merits and detrimental soldiers, although killing you is not enough to thank the world!"" Yan said, ""This is my intention, Huadan shares my ear with me, so why argue?"" Du Yu said suddenly. Jin Zhu looked at the table, and also said that it was appropriate to rush into the army. The lord of Jin no longer doubted, and ordered the army to advance. Wang Jun and others were ordered by the Lord of Jin to advance by water and land, stirred by wind and thunder, and the Wu people looked down at the flag. Wu Zhuhao was shocked when he heard it. The ministers said: ""The northern army is approaching, and the army and people in the south of the Yangtze River will surrender without fighting. What will happen?"" Hao said, ""Why don't you fight?"" The ministers will go out of the city to fight to the death."" Hao said: ""The amount is one of the most expensive, how can you go wrong with the country?"" , Broken and cut Cen faint, raw and eaten its flesh. Tao Jun said: ""The warships led by the ministers are all small, and I would like to get 20,000 soldiers to take the big ships to fight and destroy them by myself."" The former general Zhang Xiang led the sailors down the river to meet the enemy. The soldiers of the two men were on their way, and they didn't want the northwest wind to blow. Wu's soldiers could not stand the flags, and they were all upside down in the boat. The soldiers refused to disembark and ran in all directions. Only Zhang Xiang and dozens of troops were waiting for the enemy.","The Jin troops storm through, Shen Rong and Prime Minister Zhang Ti are slain, and at that the Wu army disintegrates. A poet has written this about Zhang Ti: On Ba hill, Du Yu’s banners flew, Here Zhang Ti of the south loyally died. No longer did regal grace animate the land, But he chose to act as if it did. When realization of the scale of the disaster dawns on Sun Hao, he asks why the troops won’t fight. He is then told bluntly it is because of the corruption of Cen Hun. ‘ Kill him, Your Majesty, and we’ll go out to fight,’ say the officials, But Sun Hao still cannot awake to the real problem and says, ‘Are you seriously suggesting one palace eunuch can destroy a whole kingdom?’ Realizing that he will never act, the officials take matters into their own hands and slay Cen Hun, feasting upon his dismembered body. The few soldiers and sailors who remain are frightened when their banners fall in a great storm; many take this as a profoundly inauspicious sign and desert. Now there are just a few brigades between Jin and total triumph.","The armies of Jin conquered at Niuzhu and penetrated deeply into the country of Wu. From his camp Wang Jun sent a report of his victory to Luoyang, and Sima Yan was pleased. But Jia Chong again opposed further fighting, saying, “The armies have been long absent, and the soldiers will suffer from the unhealthiness of the southern country. It would be well to call them home.” Zhang Hua spoke against this course, saying, “The Jin army has reached the very home and center of the enemy. Soon Wu courage will fail, and the Ruler of Wu himself will be our prisoner. To recall the army now would be to waste the efforts already made.” The Ruler of Jin inclined to neither side. Jia Chong turned upon Zhang Hua savagely, saying, “You are wholly ignorant and understand nothing; you are bent upon winning some sort of glory at the expense of our soldiers' lives. Death would be too good for you.” “Why wrangle?” said Sima Yan. “Zhang Hua agrees with me, and he knows my wishes.” Just at this moment came a memorial from the leader Du Yu also recommending advance, whereupon the Ruler of Jin decided that the army should go on. The royal mandate duly reached the camp of Wang Jun, and the Jin navy went out to the attack in great pomp. The soldiers of Wu made no defense, but surrendered at once. When Sun Hao, the Ruler of Wu, heard his armies had surrendered thus, he turned pale, and his courtiers said, “What is to be done? Here the northern army comes nearer every day and our troops just give in.” “But why do they not fight?” said Sun Hao. The courtiers replied, “The one evil of today is the eunuch Cen Hun. Slay him, and we ourselves will go out and fight to the death.” “How can a eunuch harm a state?” cried Sun Hao. “Have we not seen what Huang Hao did in Shu?” shouted the courtiers in chorus. Moved by sudden fury, the courtiers rushed into the Palace, found the wretched object of their hate and slew him, and even feeding on his palpitating flesh. Then Tao Jun said, “All my ships are small, but give me large vessels and I will place thereon twenty thousand marines and go forth to fight. I can defeat the enemy.” His request was granted, and the royal guards were sent up the river to join battle, while another naval force went down stream, led by Leader of the Van Zhang Xiang. But a heavy gale came on. The flags were blown down and lay over in the ships, and the marines would not embark. They scattered leaving their leader with only a few score men."
却說鍾會請姜維計議收鄧艾之策。維曰：“可先令監軍衞瓘收艾。艾欲殺瓘，則反情實矣。將軍却起兵討之，可也。”會大喜，遂令衞瓘引數十人入成都，收鄧艾父子。瓘部卒止之曰：“此是鍾司徒令鄧征西殺將軍，以正反情也。切不可行。”瓘曰：“吾自有計。”遂先發檄文二三十道。其檄曰：“奉詔收艾，其餘各無所問。若早來歸，爵賞如先；敢有不出者，滅三族。”隨備檻車兩乘，星夜望成都而來。,"However, Zhong Hui asked Jiang Wei to discuss Deng Ai's policy. Wei said: ""You can first order the guards of the guards to collect Ai. If Ai wants to kill Guan, it will be unreasonable. The general has raised troops to beg him, but that's okay."" The meeting was overjoyed, so he ordered Wei Guan to lead dozens of people into Chengdu, where they would be taken away. Deng Ai and his son. Kuan's army officer stopped him and said, ""This is Zhong Situ's order Deng Zhengxi to kill the general. It's not feasible."" Kuan said, ""I have my own plan."" He said, ""Accept the edict to collect the Ai, and the rest will not be asked. If you come back early, you will be rewarded as the first; if you dare not, the three clans will be destroyed.""","Zhong Hui now worries how to go about overthrowing Deng Ai. He asks Jiang Wei for his advice. ‘ Despatch Commander Wei Guan to arrest him. If Deng Ai kills him, that’s outright rebellion, and thus you’ll have the excuse to march against him.’ But when Wen Guan is told to go and arrest Deng Ai with his own troop, they all realize that this is a plot to have Wen Guan killed in order to provide a valid excuse for Zhong Hui to attack. As a result, Wen Guan sends secret messages to Deng Ai’s own officers warning them that he has been instructed to arrest Deng Ai, but if they join him he will make sure they are not arrested as well. ‘If you do not agree, you are likely not only to die but to see your entire clan wiped out.’","Asked to say what was the best plan to secure the arrest of Deng Ai, Jiang Wei said, “Send Wei Guan. If Deng Ai tries to kill Wei Guan, he will manifest the desire of his heart. Then you can destroy him as a traitor.” Hence Wei Guan was sent, with some thirty men, to effect the arrest. Wei Guan's own people saw the danger of the enterprise and urged him not to go, saying, “Zhong Hui clearly wants Deng Ai to kill you to prove his point.” But Wei Guan said, “Do not worry. I have a scheme prepared.” Wei Guan first wrote a score or two of letters, all in the same terms, saying: “Wei Guan has orders to arrest Deng Ai, but no other persons will be dealt with providing they submit quickly. Rewards await those who obey the Imperial Command. However, the punishment for laggards and those who are contumacious will be death to the whole family.”"

So Sun Li and Xin Pi Xingye made a statement to the Lord of Wei, saying that the troops of Shu had left Qishan again, and Cao Zhen had lost his troops and lost his generals, and the situation was very critical. Rui was shocked, and he called Sima Yi inside and said, ""Cao Zhen lost his troops, and the soldiers of Shu went out of Qishan. What's your plan to retreat?"" Yi said, ""This minister has a plan to retreat Zhuge Liang. The soldiers will naturally leave."" It is exactly:","Advised by his commanders and especially Jiang Wei that they need to create a diversion in order to trap Cao Zhen and defeat the mighty Wang Shuang, Kong Ming agrees, and the army divides.","Cao Zhen was very sad when he heard of the loss of Fei Yao. He consulted Guo Huai as to a new plan to drive back the enemy. Meanwhile, flying messengers had gone to the capital with news of Zhuge Liang's arrival at Qishan and the defeat. Cao Rui called Sima Yi to ask for a plan to meet these new conditions. “I have a scheme all ready, not only to turn back Zhuge Liang, but to do so without any exertion on our part. They will retire of their own will.” Cao Zhen's wits are dull; so he"
於是孫峻、滕胤入見吳主孫亮，密奏其事。亮曰：“朕見此人，亦甚恐怖；常欲除之，未得其便。今卿等果有忠義，可密圖之。”胤曰：“陛下可設席召恪，暗伏武士於壁衣中，擲盃為號，就席間殺之：以絕後患。”亮從之。,"So Sun Jun and Teng Yin came in to see Sun Liang, the master of Wu, and secretly reported the matter.

Emperor Wu of Wei refused to accept Chan in Han, just like me who refused to do Chan in Wei."" Jia Chong and others heard the statement , Knowing that Sima Zhao paid attention to his son Sima Yan, he stopped persuading him to enter.

Jia Chong and those of his party urged Sima Zhao to assume the Throne and replace Wei, but he refused. “Formerly King Wen had two-thirds of the empire, and yet he supported and served the state of Yin to its end. Wherefore Confucius called him 'Complete of Virtue.' Emperor Cao of Wei would not replace the Hans, nor will I accept an abdication of Wei.” Those who heard this felt that in these words was an implication that he intended to place his own son Sima Yan on the throne, and they ceased to urge him to act. In the sixth month of that year, Cao Huang, Duke of Changdao, was raised to the throne as Emperor, the period-style being changed to Wonderful Beginning, the first year (AD 260).

Kong Ming only knew that Soochow had violated the situation, and he was very surprised, so he called into the account and asked about it. Feng said, ""I'm here to announce the good news."" Kong Ming said, ""What's the joy?"" Feng said, ""In the past, Mengda's surrender to Wei was a last resort. At that time, Cao Pi loved his talents, and he bestowed them with golden pearls on horses. When entering and leaving, he was designated as a regular attendant of Sanqi, led the prefect of Xincheng, guarded Shangyong, Jincheng, etc., and was entrusted with the responsibility of the southwest. Since Pi's death, Cao Rui has been in the position, and many people in the court are jealous, Meng Da is restless day and night, often called generals Said: 'I am a general of Shu, and I will force it here.' Today, I have sent my confidants to see my father with a book, and tell the Prime Minister sooner or later: when the former went down to Sichuan on five routes, he had this intention; now in Xincheng, I heard that When the prime minister attacked Wei, he wanted to raise the three military horses in Jincheng, Xincheng and Shangyong, so he raised his case and took Luoyang directly; the prime minister took Chang'an, and the two capitals were settled. Today, a certain person has attracted people and sent them in letters many times."" Kong Ming was overjoyed, thick Reward Li Feng and others. Suddenly he reported that Cao Rui, the lord of Wei, was fortunate in Chang'an on the one hand; on the other hand, he ordered Sima Yi to be reinstated and added to the post of Governor of Pingxi. Ma Su, who joined the army, said: ""What is Cao Rui's way! If he comes to Chang'an, he can be captured immediately. Why is the prime minister surprised?"" Kong Ming said: ""Am I afraid of Cao Rui? The only patient who suffers is Sima Yi. If you meet Sima Yi, the matter will be defeated. Dafei Sima Yi's opponent will be captured. If Meng Da dies, the Central Plains will not be easy to obtain."" Ma Su said, ""Why don't you rush to repair the book, so that Meng Da's embankment?"" Kong Ming followed and repaired the book. Let the people who come to return to Meng Da in the starry night.","Back at Kong Ming’s camp, now at Qishan after yet more victories, news comes which seems to offer even greater success. Meng Da, who surrendered to the Wei empire, has decided to change sides again, seize the areas of Jincheng, Xincheng and Shangyong and then march on Luoyang. With Kong Ming now planning to strike out for Chang’an, it looks possible that both ancient capital cities could fall to the Shu. But when news comes of Sima Yi’s restoration and new powers, Kong Ming is deeply troubled. ‘ Sima Yi is formidable, and, if he takes on Meng Da, it will be Sima Yi who will win.’ So saying, he sends a messenger to Meng Da, warning him to beware of Sima Yi and to build up the defences rapidly to deflect any attack.","He was at Qishan, busy with plans for other victories, when Li Yan, who was in command at the Palace of Eternal Peace, sent his son Li Feng to the camp. Zhuge Liang concluded that such a visit could only mean that Wu had invaded them, and he was in consequence cast down. However, he summoned Li Feng to his tent, and when asked the object of his mission, Li Feng replied that he had joyful news to impart. “What is your joyful news?” said Zhuge Liang. “Formerly Meng Da deserted to Wei, but only because he could do nothing else. Cao Pi thought much of his capabilities, treated him most generously, kept him at his side, gave him titles of General Who Establishes Strong Arms and Lord of Pingyang, and appointed him to the posts of Governor of Xincheng and Commander of Shangyong and Jincheng, and so on. But when Cao Pi died, all was changed. In Cao Rui's court were many who were jealous of Meng Da's influence and power, so that he enjoyed no peace. “He used to talk about being originally one of the Shu leaders, and he was forced to do so-and-so. Lately he has sent several confidants with letters to my father asking that he would state his case to you as to the happenings when the five armies came upon Shu. Now he is at Xincheng, and, hearing you are attacking Wei, he proposes to lead the army of the three counties about Xincheng, Jincheng, and Shangyong to attack Luoyang while you attack Changan, whereby both capitals will be taken. I have brought with me his messenger and his letters.” This was good news, and the bearer was fittingly rewarded. But at that moment came the news that Cao Rui was leading an army to Changan and had recalled the banished Sima Yi to office. This piece of bad news saddened Zhuge Liang not a little. He told Ma Su, who said, “Cao Rui should not be your worry. If he goes to Changan, we will march there and capture him on the road, and there will be an end of him.” “Do you think I fear him?” said Zhuge Liang bitterly. “But the recall of Sima Yi is another matter; that troubles me. And Meng Da's proposal will avail nothing if he comes across this man. Meng Da is no match for him. He will he captured, and, if he should be, the Middle Land will be hard to conquer.” “Why not put Meng Da on his guard then?” said Ma Su. Zhuge Liang decided to write, and the letter was dispatched immediately. Meng Da was then at Xincheng, anxiously expecting the return of his last confidential messenger, when, one day, the man returned and gave him this letter from Zhuge Liang himself:"

Every time the minister reads his book, he never fails to sigh with emotion;","When the messenger who took the notice to Meng Da returns with the news and a carefully worded letter from Meng Da to Xuande arguing that out of loyalty he is deserting, Xuande is furious.","“It is well known that when Fan Li saw certain eventualities, he went sailing on the lakes, and Zi Fan acknowledged his faults and stayed by the rivers. Inasmuch as one cannot take means of safeguarding one's self at the critical and dangerous moment , I desire—as is my duty—to go away as I came, untainted. Moreover, I am stupid and without use or merit, merely born in these days as the sport of circumstances. “In the days of old, Shen Sheng, though perfectly filial, incurred the suspicions of his father and died; Zi Xu, though perfectly loyal, was put to death. Meng Tian, though he extended the borders of Qin, suffered the extreme penalty; and Yue Yi, though he destroyed the might of Qi, was the victim of calumny. Whenever I have read of these men, I have been moved to tears, and now I am in like case and the more mortified."

却說毋兵儉在項城，不時差人去樂嘉城哨探，只恐有兵來。請文欽到營共議，欽曰：“都督勿憂：我與拙子文鴦，只消五千兵，敢保樂嘉城。”儉大喜。欽父子引五千兵投樂嘉來。前軍報說：“樂嘉城西，皆是魏兵，約有萬餘。遙望中軍：白旄黃鉞，皂蓋朱旛，簇擁虎帳，內豎立一面錦鏽帥字旗，此必司馬師也——安立營寨，尚未完備。”時文鴦懸鞭立於父側，聞知此語，乃告父曰：“趁彼營寨未成，可分兵兩路，左右擊之，可全勝也。”欽曰：“何時可去？”鴦曰：“今夜黃昏，父引二千五百兵，從城南殺來；兒引二千五百兵，從城北殺來：三更時分，要在魏寨會合。”欽從之，當晚分兵兩路。且說文鴦年方十八歲：身長八尺，全裝慣甲，腰懸鋼鞭，綽鎗上馬，遙望魏寨而進。,"However, he said that Wubingjian was in Xiangcheng, and from time to time he sent people to Lejia City to check out, only to fear that soldiers would come. Wen Qin was invited to the camp to discuss together. Qin said, ""Don't worry about the governor: I and my son Wen Yang have only 5,000 soldiers, and dare to protect the city of Lejia."" Jian was overjoyed. Qin and his son brought 5,000 soldiers to Lejia. Qianjun Bao said: ""To the west of Lejia City, there are all Wei soldiers, about ten thousand. Looking at the central army from a distance: white and yellow toads, soap-covered and red flags, surrounded by tiger tents, and erected a jinrust handsome flag inside, this must be Sima The master is also-an established camp, but it is not yet complete."" At that time, Wenyang was standing with his whip hanging on his father's side. Hearing this, he told his father: ""While the camp is not yet completed, you can divide your troops into two paths and attack them from the left and right, and you can win. Qin said, ""When can we go?"" Yang said, ""Tonight at dusk, my father will lead 2,500 soldiers from the south of the city to kill; my son will lead 2,500 soldiers from the north of the city: at the third watch, we will be at Wei Zhai will meet."" Qin followed it, and that night divided his troops into two groups. Let’s say Wenyang Fang was eighteen years old: he was eight feet long, he was fully armored, he hung a steel whip around his waist, mounted his horse with a spear, and looked at Wei Zhai in the distance.","It is in Huainan, under the leadership of Wen Qin, governor of Yangzhou, and Guanqiu Jian, a famous general, that the rebellion breaks out. Disgusted at the usurping of imperial power by the Sima brothers and the death of Cao Shuang, they launch their rebellion. Their first target is the city of Xiangcheng, where they set up camp. Sima Shi has just had a painful operation to have a mole removed from just below his left eye. He is still in considerable pain, and, when news comes of the revolt, is not keen to have to go himself. However, he knows that, if he does not, then the rebellion will gather strength simply because he has not come. So reluctantly he leads the army to the attack. Paramount among the warriors of the rebellion is the mighty Wen Yang. His weapon of choice is a whip of steel.","His plan was acceptable to Sima Shi, who sent letters to Yanzhou telling Deng Ai to march against Lojia, where Sima Shi himself would soon meet him. Camped at Xiangcheng, Guanqiu Jian sent spies to Lojia to see what might be happening there, for he feared it would be attacked. When he spoke of his fears to Wen Qin, the latter said, “General, you need not be anxious. My son Wen Yang and I will answer for its safety. Give us but five thousand troops.” Father and son, with the five thousand troops, went to Lojia. Before the main body arrived, it was seen that Wei banners were flying on the west of the city. By and by they made out that the leader was no other than Sima Shi himself with more than ten thousand troops. His camp was forming rapidly, but was not yet complete. When this was reported to Wen Qin, his son Wen Yang, bearing his famous whip of steel, was by his father's side. “We should attack before they have settled down in camp, Father,” said he. “Let us go quickly and attack on two sides.” “When can we start?” said the father. “Tonight at dusk. You lead half the force round by the south, and I will march the other half round by the north, and we will meet in the third watch at the Wei camp.” The youth who propounded this plan was then eighteen, tall and strong. He wore complete armor and carried at his waist a steel whip."
孟獲允諾，卽放出張嶷、馬忠，還了孔明。孔明遂送夫人入洞。孟獲接入，又喜又惱。忽報八納洞主到。孟獲出帳迎接，見其人騎着白象，身穿金珠纓絡，腰懸兩口大刀，領着一班餵養虎豹豺狼之士，簇擁而入。獲再拜哀告，訴說前事。木鹿大王許以報讎。獲大喜，設宴相待。次日木鹿大王引本洞兵帶猛獸而出。趙雲、魏延聽知蠻兵出，遂將軍馬布成陣勢。二將並轡立於陣前視之，只見蠻兵旗幟器械皆別；人多不穿衣甲，盡裸身赤體，面目醜陋；身帶四把尖刀；軍中不鳴鼓角，但篩金為號；木鹿大王腰挂兩把寶刀，手執蒂鐘，身騎白象，從大旗中而出。趙雲見了，謂魏延曰：“我等上陣一生，未嘗見如此人物。”二人正沈吟之際，只見木鹿大王口中不知念甚咒語，手搖蒂鐘。忽然狂風大作，飛砂走石，如同驟雨，一聲畫角響，虎豹豺狼，毒蛇猛獸，乘風而出，張牙舞爪，衝將過來。蜀兵如何抵當，往後便退。蠻兵隨後追殺，直趕到三江界路方回。趙雲、魏延收聚敗兵，來孔明帳前請罪，細說此事。,"Meng Huo promised to release Zhang Yi and Ma Zhong and return Kong Ming. Kong Ming then sent his wife into the cave. Meng Huo joined in, happy and annoyed. Suddenly reported the arrival of the master of Bana Cave. Meng Huo went out of the tent to greet him, and saw that he was riding a white elephant, wearing a golden bead tassels, and two large knives hanging from his waist. Worship again and plead, tell the past. The king of the wooden deer, Xu Yi, repaid him. Overjoyed, set a banquet to treat each other. The next day, King Mulu led the soldiers and beasts out of the cave. Zhao Yun and Wei Yan heard that the barbarian troops were coming, and then the general Mabu formed a battle. The two generals stood side by side in front of the formation and looked at them, and saw that the barbarian soldiers had different flags and equipment; many people were naked and naked, with ugly faces; they carried four sharp knives; Number: King Mulu hangs two treasured swords on his waist, holds a peddled bell, rides a white elephant, and emerges from the banner. When Zhao Yun saw it, he said to Wei Yan, ""I have been in battle all my life, and I have never seen such a person."" While the two were pondering, they saw King Mulu reciting an incantation and shaking a bell. Suddenly there was a strong wind, flying sand and rocks, like a shower, with a sound of horns, tigers, leopards, wolves, poisonous snakes and beasts, rushing out in the wind, clawing their teeth and dancing claws, and rushed over. When the soldiers of Shu arrive, they will retreat. The barbarians then chased and killed them until they returned to Sanjiangjie Road. Zhao Yun and Wei Yan gathered the defeated soldiers, came to Kongming's tent to plead guilty, and explained the matter in detail.","Kong Ming, of course, treats her with due respect, and an exchange is arranged – the two Shu commanders in exchange for Lady Zhurong. Now the Bana valley men and their king, Mulu, arrive to join the rebels. When the sun comes up the next day the Shu army get their first view of these wild people. Almost all the warriors are naked; their faces hideous to behold; they each have four daggers and they drive on their men with gongs, not horns and drums. Their king rides on a huge white elephant. With them come tigers, panthers, jackals and wolves. At the battlefront, Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan look at each other in astonishment at the appearance of their foe. ‘Never,’ says Zilong, ‘in all our years at war have we ever seen anything like this!’ Suddenly King Mulu starts to chant, and instantly a terrifying storm breaks, with the wind hurling sand and stones. Riding upon the storm come tigers, panthers, jackals, wolves, snakes and scorpions, roaring and hissing in anger. The Shu troops cannot contend and retreat to the relative safety of Sanjiang. Mortified, Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan bow before Kong Ming and apologize.","Then a message was sent to Meng Huo to say that she would be exchanged for the two captive leaders. The King agreed, and they were set free. As soon as they arrived, the lady was escorted by Zhuge Liang himself to the mouth of the ravine, where Meng Huo welcomed her half gladly, half angrily. Then they told Meng Huo of the coming of the King of the Bana Ravine, and he went out to meet Mu Lu. Mu Lu rode up on his white elephant, dressed in silks, and with many gold and pearl ornaments. He wore a double sword at his belt, and he was followed by the motley pack of fighting animals that he fed, gamboling and dancing about him. Meng Huo made him a low obeisance and then poured out his tale of woes. Mu Lu promised to avenge his wrongs and was led off to a banquet which had been prepared. Next day the deliverer went out to battle, with his pack of wild creatures in his train. Zhao Yun and his colleague Wei Yan quickly made their array of footmen and then took their station in front side by side and studied their opponents. The Mang banners and weapons were all extraordinary. Most of the warriors wore no armor and none wore any clothing. Their faces were sunburned. They carried four sharp pointed knives in their belts. Signals were not given by drum or trumpet, but by a gong. King Mu Lu had two swords in his belt and carried a hand bell. He urged his white elephant forward and emerged from between his flags. “We have spent all our life in the battlefields, but we have never seen the like of that before,” said Zhao Yun. As they talked to one another, they noticed that the opposing leader was mumbling something that might be a spell or a curse, and from time to time he rang his bell. Then suddenly the wind got up, stones began to roll and sand to fly, and there was a sound as of a heavy shower of rain. Next a horn rang out, and thereupon the tigers and the leopards, and the wolves and the serpents, and all the other wild beasts came down on the wind snapping and clawing. How could the soldiers of Shu stand such a thing as that? So they retreated, and the Mangs came after them fiercely, chasing and slaying their enemies as far as the city of Three Rivers. Zhao Yun and Wei Yan mustered their defeated troops and went to their leader to confess their failure. Zhuge Liang, however, was neither angry nor dejected."
恢行至超寨，先使人通名姓。馬超曰：“吾知李恢乃辯士，今必來說我。”先喚二十刀斧手伏於帳下，囑曰：“令汝砍，旣砍為肉醬！”須臾，李恢昂然而入。馬超端坐於帳中不動，叱李恢曰：“汝來為何？”恢曰：“特來作說客。”超曰：“吾匣中寶劍新磨。汝試言之。其言不通，便請試劍！”恢笑曰：“將軍之禍不遠矣！但恐新磨之劍，不能試吾之頭，將欲自試也！”超曰：“吾有何禍？”恢曰：“吾聞越之西子，善毁者不能閉其美；齊之無鹽，善美者不能掩其醜；‘日中則昃，月滿則虧’：此天下之常理也。今將軍與曹操有殺父之讎，而隴西又有切齒之恨；前不能救劉璋而退荊州之兵，後不能制楊松而見張魯之面；目下四海難容，一身無主；若復有渭橋之敗，冀城之失，何面目見天下之人乎？”超頓首謝曰：“公言極善；但超無路可行。”恢曰：“公旣聽吾言，帳外何故伏刀斧手？”超大漸，盡叱退。恢曰：“劉皇叔禮賢下士，吾知其必成，故捨劉璋而歸之。公之尊人，昔年曾與皇叔約共討賊，公何不棄暗投明，以圖上報父讎，下立功名乎？”馬超大喜，卽喚楊柏入，一劍斬之，將首級共恢一同上關來降玄德。玄德親自接入，待以上賓之禮。超頓首謝曰：“今遇明主，如撥雲霧而見靑天！”時孫乾已回。玄德復命霍峻、孟達守關，便撤兵來取成都。趙雲、黃忠接入綿竹。人報蜀將劉晙、馬漢引軍到。趙雲曰：“某願往擒此二人！”言訖，上馬引軍出。玄德在城上管待馬超喫酒。未曾安席，子龍已斬二人之頭，獻於筵前。馬超亦驚，倍加敬重。超曰：“不須主公廝殺，超自喚出劉璋來降。如不肯降，超自與弟馬岱取成都，雙手奉獻。”玄德大喜。是日盡歡。,"To resume the line to Chaozhai, first make people pass their first and last names. Ma Chao said: ""I know that Li Hui is a debater, so I must speak to me now."" First, he summoned twenty swordsmen and axemen to lie down under the tent, and instructed: ""I will order you to chop, and I will chop it into meat sauce!"" After a while, Li Huiang However enter. Ma Chao sat upright in the tent and didn't move, and yelled at Li Hui, ""Why did you come?"" Please try your sword!"" Hui laughed and said, ""The general's disaster is not far away! But I am afraid that the newly sharpened sword will not be able to test my head. : ""I have heard of Xizi of Yue, those who are good at destroying can't hide their beauty; if there is no salt in Qi, those who are good and beautiful can't hide their ugliness; 'In the middle of the day, when the sun is full, when the moon is full, it's a loss': this is the common law of the world. Today's generals and Cao Cao There was the murder of his father, and the hatred of Longxi's gnashing of teeth; in the past, Liu Zhang was unable to save Liu Zhang and retreated to the soldiers of Jingzhou, and later he was unable to control Yang Song and see Zhang Lu's face; now the four seas are difficult to tolerate, and there is no owner; if there is another defeat at Weiqiao, With the loss of Jicheng, how can I see the people of the world?"" Chao Dun nodded and said: ""The public words are very good; but Chao has no way to do it."" Hui said: ""Gong Yan listened to my words, why is there a sword and axe outside the tent?"" Oversized gradually, all repelled. Hui said: ""Uncle Liu's virtuous corporal, I knew it would be successful, so I abandoned Liu Zhang and returned to him. Your honorable man, in the past, had made an appointment with your uncle to fight against thieves. Why didn't you abandon the secret and go to the light, and use the picture to report to your father and make a name for yourself. Huh?"" Ma Chao was overjoyed, and he called Yang Bo to enter, slashed him with one sword, and returned his head to the same pass to bring down Xuande. Xuande personally came in and waited for the courtesy of the guests. Chao Dun thanked him and said, ""Today I meet the Lord of Ming, as if I see the sky in the clouds and mist!"" Sun Qian had already returned. Xuande ordered Huo Jun and Meng Da to guard the gate, and withdrew his troops to take Chengdu. Zhao Yun and Huang Zhong connected to Mianzhu. People reported that Shu generals Liu Yan and Ma Han led the army there. Zhao Yun said, ""I would like to capture these two people!"" After saying this, he mounted his horse and led the army out. Xuande waited for Ma Chao to drink wine in the city. Before the banquet was settled, Zilong had cut off the heads of the two and presented them before the banquet. Ma Chao was also shocked and respected. Chao said: ""There is no need for the lord to fight, Chaozi summons Liu Zhang to surrender. If he refuses to surrender, Chaozi and his younger brother Ma Dai will take Chengdu and offer their hands."" Xuande was overjoyed. It's all day.","It is he whom Kong Ming sends with the offer of help if Ma Chao will serve Xuande. Off Li Hui goes and upon meeting Ma Chao points out the hopelessness of his situation. ‘You are a mortal enemy of Cao Cao, a useless man to Liu Zhang, and Yang Song is poisoning the ear of Zhang Lu, so he doesn’t want you either!’ He then offers Xuande’s proposal to join him. This is received with joy by Ma Chao. Within a few days he comes to offer his services to Xuande at the Jiameng pass. Then together they set out to conquer Chengdu. A few of the men Ma Chao has taken with him desert him and make their way back to Liu Zhang and Chengdu and report on his switching sides. When Liu Zhang hears that the combined armies are heading for the gates of Chengdu, he has the city sealed and prepares for the worst. Ma Chao and his brother Ma Dai ride up to the gate and call for Liu Zhang to come up on the city wall and speak to them. When he hears from Ma Chao’s own lips his account of joining Xuande, he realizes all is up. Moved by a genuine desire to spare the people any further suffering, he orders the gates to be opened. Some among his commanders still want to fight. But when a soothsayer appears and says that the stars show that a bright new ruler has appeared, this confirms Liu Zhang’s desire to surrender to this bright new ruler. None other than Xuande. Xuande’s entrance into the city is greeted with rejoicing by the population. Xuande forbids any retribution on those like Huang Quan or Liu Ba who have opposed him. This is despite the fact that they still do oppose him.","Arrived at the camp, Li Hui sent in his name, at which Ma Chao remarked, “Yes; I know him—a glib and specious persuader. I know what he has come for too.” So Ma Chao placed a score of armed ruffians in hiding about his tent and told them to cut the visitor to pieces if the signal was given. Then the guest was led in and came walking proudly. His host remained seated stiff and upright. Ma Chao spoke roughly, saying, “What are you come for?” “I am here as persuader.” “This sword here in the scabbard is newly ground. You may try me by words, but if the words do not penetrate, I shall ask you to try the sword.” Li Hui smiled, saying, “O, General, evil is not far off. However, I am thinking the newly ground sword will not be tried on my head. You will want to try it on your own!” “What evil were you talking about?” “The worst vilification could not hide the beauty of Lady Xi Shi of Yue, nor could the most fulsome praise gloze over the ugliness of Lady Wuyan of Qi ((two states of old)). The sun rises to the meridian and then declines; the moon waxes to the full and then wanes. All things obey the one law. Now, General, you are at enmity with Cao Cao for your father's death, and in Longxi you carry a stubborn, grinding hate for your family's death. You can neither rescue Liu Zhang by repulsing the army from Jingzhou, nor can you settle Yang Song by getting an interview with Zhang Lu. The whole world now holds no place for a person without a lord; and if you experience further defeats, like that one on River Wei, or the loss of Jicheng, will you not be too shamed to look any human in the face?” Ma Chao bowed his head, saying, “You speak well, Sir. But I am helpless.” “Now that you listen to me, I would ask why those fearsome ruffians are in hiding by your tent?” continued Li Hui. Ma Chao, suddenly stricken with shame, ordered them to retire. Li Hui continued his speech. “Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, is considerate to his subordinates, and I am certain he will succeed, and so I have forsaken Liu Zhang to cleave to him. Your honored father joined him in destroying rebels. Why do you not flee from darkness into the light? Thereby you would avenge your father and become famous.” Ma Chao, convinced of the wisdom of the course thus recommended, proved his conversion by sending for Yang Bo and slaying him forthwith. Taking with him the head of his victim, Ma Chao accompanied Li Hui to the Pass and tendered his submission. Liu Bei welcomed him warmly and treated him as a highly honored guest. Ma Chao bowed his head, saying, “Meeting you, O Illustrious Lord, is like seeing the clear sky when the clouds have been swept aside.” When Sun Qian returned from Yang Song's place, Liu Bei detached a force to go to the capture of Chengdu, left two generals, Meng Da and Huo Jun to guard Jiameng Pass, and made a triumphant entry into Mianzhu with the welcome of Zhao Yun and Huang Zhong. Two generals of the Western Land of Rivers, Ma Han and Liu Jun, came to oppose Liu Bei, but Zhao Yun went out against them while Liu Bei was entertaining Ma Chao at a banquet on the city wall. Ere it had concluded, Zhao Yun slew both the generals and brought their heads to the banquet chamber. This exploit put Ma Chao on his mettle and doubled his respect for the conquerors. “Let not my lord attack,” said Ma Chao. “I will make Liu Zhang surrender of his own accord. Should he resist, my brother Ma Dai and I will take the city and offer it to you with both hands.” Liu Bei was very pleased with the course of events; the day was indeed one of rejoicing."
却說雒城中吳懿、劉璝聽知折了冷苞，遂與衆商議。張任曰：“城東南山僻有一條小路，最為要緊，某自引一軍守之。諸公緊守雒城，勿得有失。”忽報漢兵分兩路前來攻城。張任急引三千軍，先來抄小路埋伏。見魏延兵過，張任敎儘放過去，休得驚動。後見龐統軍來，張任軍士，遙指軍中大將：“騎白馬者必是劉備。”張任大喜，傳令敎如此如此。,"However, they said that Wu Yi and Liu Wei in Luocheng heard that the cold bud was broken, so they discussed with everyone. Zhang Ren said: ""There is a small road in the southeast of the city. The most important thing is that a certain army will lead an army to defend it. The princes will guard Luocheng closely, so that there is no gain or loss."" Zhang Ren hurriedly led 3,000 troops, and first came to ambush by a small road. Seeing Wei Yan's army passing by, Zhang Renji let him go, and Hugh was alarmed. After seeing Pang Tong's army coming, Sergeant Zhang Ren pointed to the general in the army: ""The one who rides the white horse must be Liu Bei."" Zhang Ren was overjoyed, and the order was so.","That’s Xuande’s horse,’ he is told and, now excited at the possibility of capturing Xuande, he prepares his ambush. Pang Tong rides into the narrow valley. Something makes him really worried. ‘Where are we?’ he asks, and he is told that this is known as Fallen Phoenix valley.","When the news of Ling Bao's capture and death reached Luocheng, Wu Yi and Liu Gui took counsel together. Their colleague, Zhang Ren, said, “I know a by-road on the east which is of great importance, and I pray you let me guard it while you two hold the city.” So as soon as the news of the advancing armies came, Zhang Ren led three thousand troops to this road and placed them in ambush. They remained hidden while Wei Yan passed and made no attack. The main body under Pang Tong soon followed. The soldiers in ambush saw a rider on a fine white horse and pointed him out to one another, saying, “That surely is Liu Bei on the white horse.” Their leader Zhang Ren rejoiced too, and he gave certain orders."
却說周泰從軍中殺出，到江邊，不見了孫權，勒回馬，從外又殺入陣中，問本部軍：“主公何在？”軍人以手指兵馬厚處，曰：“主公被圍甚急！”周泰挺身殺入，尋見孫權。泰曰：“主公可隨泰殺出。”於是泰在前，權在後，奮力衝突。泰到江邊，回顧又不見孫權，乃復翻身殺入圍中，又尋見孫權。權曰：“弓弩齊發，不能得出，如何？”泰曰：“主公在前，某在後，可以出圍。”孫權乃縱馬前行。周泰左右遮護，身被數鎗，箭透重鎧，救得孫權。到江邊，呂蒙引一枝水軍前來接應下船。權曰：“吾虧周泰三番衝殺。得脫重圍。但徐盛在垓心，如何得脫？”周泰曰：“吾再救去。”遂輪鎗復翻身殺入重圍之中，救出徐盛。二將各帶重傷。呂蒙敎軍士亂箭射住岸上兵，救二將下船。,"But he said that Zhou Tai had rushed out of the army, and when he reached the riverside, when Sun Quan was nowhere to be seen, he reined in his horse, and rushed into the battle from the outside. He asked the main army, ""Where is your lord?"" Very urgent!"" Zhou Tai stepped forward and rushed in to find Sun Quan. Tai said: ""The lord can go out with Tai."" So Tai was in the front, and the power was behind, struggling to fight. Tai went to the riverside, and when he looked back, he couldn't see Sun Quan. Quan said: ""The bows and crossbows are all fired, but I can't draw them out. How about it?"" Tai said: ""The lord is in the front, and a certain person is in the back, so you can get out of the encirclement."" Sun Quan rode his horse forward. Zhou Tai was shielded from the left and right, and he was shot several times, and the arrows penetrated the heavy armor, saving Sun Quan. At the riverside, Lü Meng led a navy to come to receive him and disembark. Quan said: ""I lost Zhou Tai three times and rushed to kill. I was able to get out of the siege. But Xu Sheng is in Gai's heart, how can I get rid of it?"" Zhou Tai said: ""I will save it again."" Sheng. Both will be seriously injured. Sergeant Lü Meng shot arrows at the soldiers on the shore and rescued the second general from the boat.","Zhou Tai, one of his most loyal commanders, has fought his way through to the riverbank but, realizing Sun Quan is not with him, he plunges back into the fray, crying, ‘Where’s our lord?’, to which men shout back, ‘There, in the thick of the enemy.’ Charging into the mêlée, Zhou Tai reaches Sun Quan and cries, ‘Follow me, my lord.’ So saying, he turns and slashes his way back out again. But once again, when he reaches the shore, he finds Sun Quan is no longer with him. Undeterred, he once again plunges back into the fray, slashing his way through until he again reaches Sun Quan. ‘ There’s no escape,’ cries Sun Quan, as arrows and crossbow bolts rain down on them. ‘You go first,’ shouts Zhou Tai, ‘and I’ll follow.’ As Sun Quan surges forward, Zhou Tai fights left and right to defend him as warriors slash at him and arrows strike him. But at last he brings Sun Quan to the shore and gets him into a rescue boat. ‘Without Zhou Tai coming back three times I would not have survived,’ says Sun Quan to his men. ‘But where’s Xu Sheng? Is he still trapped?’ Hearing this, Zhou Tai turns yet again and throws himself into the battle until he reaches Xu Sheng, who is surrounded by the enemy. Smashing his way through, he brings Xu Sheng to safety. Both of them are badly wounded and only just make it onto the rescue boat.","When Zhou Tai had cut an arterial alley out of the press and reached the river-side, he looked for his master. But Sun Quan was nowhere visible, so Zhou Tai dashed once again into the battle. Coming to his own troops, he cried, “Where is our lord?” They pointed to where the press was most dense. Zhou Tai stiffened and dashed in. Presently he reached his lord's side and cried out, “My lord, follow me and I will hack a way out!” Zhou Tai fought his way out to the river bank. Then he turned to look, and Sun Quan was not behind him. So he turned back, forced his way in and once again found his way to his master's side. “I cannot get out; the arrows are too thick,” said Sun Quan. “Then go first, my lord, and I will follow.” Sun Quan then urged his steed as fast as he could go, and Zhou Tai kept off all pursuit. Zhou Tai sustained many wounds and the arrows rattled on his helmet, but he got clear at last and Sun Quan was safe. As they neared the river bank, Lu Meng came up with some of the naval force and escorted Sun Quan down to the ships. “I owe my safety to Zhou Tai, who thrice came to my aid,” said Sun Quan. “But Xu Sheng is still in the thick of the fight, and how can we save him?” “I will go to his rescue,” cried Zhou Tai. Whirling his spear, Zhou Tai again plunged into the battle and presently brought his colleague safely out of the press. Both were severely wounded. Lu Meng ordered his troops to keep up a rapid flight of arrows so as to command the bank, and in this way the two leaders were enabled to get on board the ships."

Suddenly, it was reported that Lord Wu sent an envoy to come, and he resisted access to ask him.

Kang said: ""You go back first, and I will have a copy of the chapter."" Industry. When the close ministers presented it, Hao demolished it to observe its sparseness, and in the sparseness prepared a statement that Jin could not be defeated, and advised Wu Master to cultivate morality and punishment, thinking of peace, and not taking military affairs as his thing. When the Lord of Wu finished his inspection, he was furious and said, ""I heard that the resistance is in contact with the enemy at the frontier, and now it is true!"" So he sent an envoy to relinquish his military power and demoted him to Sima, but ordered the left general Sun Ji to lead his army on his behalf. The ministers did not dare to remonstrate. Wu Zhuhao changed from Yuan Jianheng to the first year of Fenghuang. The prime minister Wan Yu, the general Liu Ping, and the Dasi Nong Lou Xuan saw that Hao had no way, and they bluntly remonstrated, and they were all killed. For more than ten years before and after, he killed more than forty loyal ministers. Hao often brought 50,000 cavalry in and out. The ministers are terrifying, and there is nothing they can do.","It is into this that the edict from the ruler of Wu arrives, ordering an outright attack on Jin. In reply Lu Kang is politely forthright about why such an invasion will not succeed and he also recommends that the Son of Heaven instead concentrate on virtue and keeping the peace at home. The ruler of Wu is furious. ‘I know that he and the enemy are friends and this is what this is about.’ And so saying, he demotes Lu Kang and sends instead Sun Ji to take over. No one dares breathe a word against this in the court. Over the next ten years the ruler of Wu’s abuses of power grow even worse. His execution of anyone who opposes him becomes more blatant, and the fear he generates prevents any honest discussion or plans being undertaken.","Soon after came a special envoy from the Ruler of Wu to urge upon Lu Kang prompt activity. “Our Emperor sends orders for you to press forward,” said the envoy. “You are not to await a Jin invasion.” “You may return and I will send up a memorial,” replied Lu Kang. So a memorial was written and soon followed the envoy to Jianye. When the Ruler of Wu, Sun Hao, read it, he found therein many arguments against attacking Jin and exhortations to exercise a virtuous rule instead of engaging in hostilities. It angered him. “They say Lu Kang has come to an understanding with the enemy, and now I believe it,” said the Ruler of Wu. Thereupon he deprived Lu Kang of his command and took away his commission and degraded him into Marching General. Sun Ji, General of the Left Army, was sent to supersede Lu Kang. And none dared to intervene. Sun Hao became still more arbitrary and of his own will changed the year-style once more to the Phoenix (AD 269). Day by day his life became more wanton and vicious. The soldiers in every camp murmured with anger and resentment, and at last three high officers—Prime Minister Wan Yu, General Liu Ping, and Minister of Agriculture Lou Xuan—boldly and earnestly remonstrated with the Emperor for his many irregularities. They suffered death. Within ten years more than forty ministers were put to death for doing their duty. Sun Hao maintained an extravagantly large guard of fifty thousand heavy cavalry, and these soldiers were the terror of everyone."

玄德看了書，便敎馬良先回。玄德曰：“吾將回荊州，去論此事。”龐統暗思：“孔明怕我取了西川，成了功，故意將此書相阻耳。”乃對玄德曰：“統亦算太乙數，已知罡星在西，應主公合得西川，別不主凶事。統亦占天文，見太白臨於雒城，先斬蜀將冷苞，已應凶兆矣。主公不可疑心，可急進兵。”,"After Xuande read the book, he instructed Ma Liang to return first.

He said to Xuande, ""Tong also Counting the number of Taiyi, it is known that Gangxing is in the west, and the lord should get Xichuan together, so don’t take the ominous thing. Tong also accounts for the astronomy, seeing Taibai approaching Luocheng, and killing the cold bud of the Shu general first, it is already a bad omen. The lord is not suspicious. , you can rush into the army.""",Ling Bao is brought to Xuande.,"Having read this and sent Ma Liang away, Liu Bei said, “I will return myself to Jingzhou and discuss the matter.” But Pang Tong, who thought in his heart that Zhuge Liang's warning was due to a jealous desire to prevent him from winning the glory of conducting a victorious campaign, opposed this, saying, “I also have made calculations, and I read the signs to mean that the time is favorable for you to get possession of this land, and no evil is foreshown.

He also made great efforts to build the Zhaoming Palace, and ordered civil and military officials to enter the mountains to collect wood. Shang replied: ""Your Majesty has received an auspicious omen: when Gengzi is old, Gai will enter Luoyang."" Hao was overjoyed, and said to Zhongshu Cheng Huahe, ""The first emperor accepted the words of Qing, and ordered the generals separately, along the river, with hundreds of colonies. I ordered the veteran general Ding Feng to sum up the battalion. If I want to annex the Han territory, I think that the lord of Shu will be restored, so where should we take first?"" He advised: ""Today, if Chengdu is not defended, the government will collapse, and Sima Yan must have the heart to swallow Wu. Your Majesty It is the best strategy to cultivate virtue in order to bring peace to the people of Wu. If you forcefully use military armor, you will be wearing sackcloth to put out the fire, and you will surely set yourself on fire: I hope Your Majesty will investigate it."" Make such unfavorable words! If you don't see the face of your old minister, you will be beheaded!"" The samurai pushed out the hall door. Hua He went out of the court and sighed, ""It's a pity that the splendid river and mountains will soon belong to others!"" Then he could not live in seclusion. So Hao ordered the general of Zhendong Lu Kang's troops to settle in the mouth of the river to map Xiangyang.","and then we can all rejoice, as will Heaven.’ In response, Sun Hao simply becomes even more extravagant, building vast palaces. He seeks advice from a fortune-teller, who assures him: ‘Good news, sire. In the future a blue canopy will enter Luoyang.’ Sun Hao takes this to mean that the Wu will conquer the Jin. Sadly this also inflames his desire to campaign against Jin and to conquer lands in the north. Despite the advice of those who understand such things, he is not to be dissuaded, and plans are put in train for an invasion. The first target is to be the Jin city of Xiangyang, and the Wu forces are given to Lu Kang to command.","He even made the officers of the court go into the forest to fell trees for the work. The Ruler of Wu called in the soothsayer Shang Guang and bade him take the cast and inquire as to the attainment of empire. Shang Guang cast a lot and replied, “All is propitious, and in the year of the 'mouse' your blue umbrella will enter Luoyang.” And Sun Hao was pleased. He said to Minister Hua Jiao, “The former rulers listened to your words and sent generals to various points and placed defensive camps along the rivers. And over all these was set Ding Feng. Now my desire is to conquer Han and avenge the wrongs of my brother, the Ruler of Shu. What place should be first conquered?” Hua Jiao replied, “Now that Chengdu has fallen and the Throne there been overturned, Sima Yan will assuredly desire to absorb this land. Your Majesty should display virtue and restore confidence to your people. That would be the best plan. If you engage in war, it will be like throwing on hemp to put out a fire; the hemp only adds to the blaze. This is worthy of careful consideration.” But Sun Hao grew angry and said, “I desire to take this opportunity to return to my real heritage. Why do you employ this ill-omened language? Were it not for your long service, now would I slay you and expose your head as a warning.” He bade the lictors hustle Minister Hua Jiao from his presence, and Hua Jiao left the court. “It is pitiful,” said Hua Jiao. “Ere long our silky, beautiful country will pass to another.” So he retired. And the Ruler of Wu ordered Lu Kang, General Who Guards the East, to camp his army at Jiangkou in order to attack Xiangyang."
忽報張昭自建業而來。權召入問之。昭曰：“今主公損了關公父子，江東禍不遠矣。此人與劉備桃園結義之時，誓同生死。今劉備已有兩川之兵；更兼諸葛亮之謀，張、黃、馬、趙之勇；備若知雲長父子遇害，必起傾國之兵，奮力報讎：恐東吳難與敵也。”權聞之大驚，跌足曰：“孤失計較也！似此如之奈何？”昭曰：“主公勿憂：某有一計，令西蜀之兵不犯東吳，荊州如磐石之安。”權問何計。昭曰：“今曹操擁百萬之衆，虎視華夏，劉備急欲報讎，必與操約和。若二處連兵而來，東吳危矣；不如先遣人將關公首級，轉送與曹操，明敎劉備知是操之所使，必痛恨於操。西蜀之兵，不向吳而向魏矣。吾乃觀其勝負，於中取事：此為上策。”,"Suddenly it was reported that Zhang Zhao had come from Jianye. The right to call in to ask. Zhao said: ""Today, the lord has damaged Guan Gong and his son, and the disaster in Jiangdong is not far away. When this man and Liu Bei made a righteous relationship with Taoyuan, they swore life and death. Now Liu Bei has soldiers from the two rivers; , Zhao Zhiyong; if you know that Yunchang and his son are killed, you will definitely raise the army of the country and try to report: I am afraid that Eastern Wu will be difficult to fight with the enemy."" Quan was shocked when he heard that, and he fell down and said: ""I am alone! What can I do?"" Zhao said, ""Don't worry, lord: there is a plan, so that the soldiers of Xishu will not invade Eastern Wu, and Jingzhou will be as safe as a rock."" Quan asked what plan. Zhao Zhao said: ""Today Cao Cao has a crowd of one million, and they are watching China as a tiger. Liu Bei is eager to retaliate, so he will make peace with Cao. If two troops come together, Eastern Wu will be in danger; it is better to send people first to take Guan Gong's head and transfer it to him. Cao Cao, Ming taught Liu Bei to know that it was Cao's envoy, and he would hate Cao. The troops of Xishu will not go to Wu but to Wei. I will watch their victory and defeat, and take matters from the middle: this is the best policy.""","This is brought home even more when Zhang Zhao points out that, due to their oath taken in the peach orchard, Xuande is bound to seek revenge and that now he controls Shu he has a vast army at his command. ‘This was a terrible mistake. What is to be done?’ asks an agonized Sun Quan. Zhang Zhao has a plan. He suggests divide and rule. ‘ Cao Cao has an army of a million, and if he unites with Xuande the south is doomed,’ he says. ‘But let us send the head of Guan Yu to Cao Cao, so that it will seem to Xuande that this was done at his express command. He’ll then attack the north, and we can watch and see from the safety of the sidelines.’","Soon Zhang Zhao came in from Jianye to see him and blame him for the murder. “My lord, by the slaughter of Guan Yu you have brought misfortune very near to this state. You know the oath sworn in the Peach Garden. Now Liu Bei has the force of the two Lands of Rivers at his back, Zhuge Liang as adviser, and those heroes Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, and Ma Chao to carry out his behests. When Liu Bei hears of the death of both father and son, he will set in motion the whole force he has to avenge them, and I fear you cannot stand such an onslaught.” Sun Quan started up in a fright. “Yes; I have made a little mistake,” said he. “But seeing it is so, what shall I do?” “You need have no fear,” replied Zhang Zhao. “I have a plan to fend off the armies of the west from our borders and keep Jingzhou quite safe.” “What is your plan?” asked Sun Quan. “Cao Cao with his many legions is greedily aiming at the whole empire. If Liu Bei wants revenge, he will ally himself with Cao Cao, and, should they combine against this country, we should be in great danger. Therefore I advise you to send Guan Yu's head to Cao Cao to make it appear that Cao Cao was the prime cause of his destruction. This should divert Liu Bei's extreme hatred toward Cao Cao and send the armies of Shu against Wei instead of toward Wu. After carefully considering the whole matter, I counsel this as the best course of action.”"

He was so grieved that he found Dong Xi's body in the water and buried it together with Chen Wu's body. Feeling Zhou Tai's rescue work, he held a banquet for him. Quan personally held the cup and stroked his back, with tears streaming down his face, and said, ""Qing rescued him twice, even at the cost of his life. He was shot dozens of times, and his skin was like a painting. Solitary, why didn't he want to give Qing the kindness of flesh and blood, and entrust the Qing with the weight of troops and horses. Huh? Qing is the hero of Gu, and Gu should share honor and disgrace with Qing, and share weal and woe."" After saying this, Zhou Tai undressed and the generals watched: the flesh and the flesh were like a knife gouging out, and the roots were all over the body. Sun Quan asked the marks on his fingers one by one. Zhou Tai stated that he was injured in the battle. A wound requires a drink. It was Ri Zhou Tai who was drunk. Quan gave it with the umbrella of Luo Luo, and ordered to go in and out Zhang Gai, thinking that he was famous.","However, great sadness descends upon Sun Quan when the body of Chen Wu is found lying upon the battlefield. For a month there is an impasse, but finally a truce is declared. Now that peace has been restored Cao Cao withdraws to the capital while Sun Quan returns to his base at Moling. Back at the imperial capital, the pressure to give Cao Cao the title ‘king of Wei’ grows and grows until Emperor Xian has no option but to agree.","Sun Quan was much grieved when he came to know that Chen Wu had been slain and Dong Xi drowned, and wept sore. Men were sent to seek for Dong Xi's body, which at last was found. Both generals were buried with great honors. As a recompense for Zhou Tai's services in Sun Quan's rescue, Sun Quan prepared in his honor a great banquet, where Sun Quan himself offered Zhou Tai a goblet of wine and complimented and embraced him while the tears coursed down his cheeks. “Twice you saved my life, careless of your own,” cried Sun Quan, “and you have received many wounds. It is as if your skin had been engraved and painted. What sort of a man should I be if I did not treat you as one of my own flesh and blood? Can I regard you, noble Sir, merely as a unit in my army? You are my meritorious minister. I share the glory you have won and mine are your joys and sorrows.” Then Sun Quan bade Zhou Tai open his dress and exhibit his wounds for all the assembly to see. The skin was gashed all over as if his body had been scored with a knife. Sun Quan pointed to the wounds one after another and asked how each one had been received. And, as Zhou Tai told him, for every wound Sun Quan made him drink off a goblet of wine till he became thoroughly intoxicated. Sun Quan then presented him with a black silk parasol and bade him use it on all occasions as a sign of the glory that was his."

Empress Wu said: ""I heard what the previous emperor said: Kong Ming knew that Wei Yan had a bone in the back of his head, and he wanted to cut it every time. Because of pity for his bravery, my aunt retained it. Now that he is reporting that Yang Yi and others have rebelled, they cannot be taken lightly. Yang Yi is a literati, and the prime minister has entrusted him with the responsibility of long history, so he will definitely be available. This matter should be considered in the long run, and it should not be made a fuss."" While the officials were discussing, they suddenly reported to the chief Shi Yangyi that there was an emergency. The close minister dismantled the watch and read:","It is a few days later that Wei Yan’s petition arrives declaring that Yang Yi has usurped power and only he, Wei Yan, stands against him. Such an unexpected announcement creates great debate within the court, with most people feeling that it is more likely that the haughty Wei Yan is the rebel. The matter is resolved when shortly afterwards Yang Yi’s petition arrives. Adviser Jiang Wan says, ‘Kong Ming never did fully trust Wei Yan","The Latter Ruler said, “Wei Yan is a valiant warrior and could easily have overcome Yang Yi; why then did he destroy the Plank Trail?” Empress Wu said, “The First Ruler used to say that Zhuge Liang knew that treachery lurked in the heart of Wei Yan, and he wished to put Wei Yan to death; he only spared Wei Yan because of his valor. We should not believe too readily this tale of his that Yang Yi has rebelled. Yang Yi is a scholar and a civil officer, and the late Prime Minister placed him in a position of great responsibility, thereby proving that he trusted and valued Yang Yi. If we believe this statement, surely Yang Yi will be forced to go over to Wei. Nothing should be done without due meditation.” As they were discussing this matter, an urgent memorial came from Yang Yi, and opening it, they read: “I, Yang Yi, leader of the retreating army, humbly and with trepidation, present this memorial. In his last moments the late Prime Minister made over to me the charge of the great enterprise, and bade me carry out his plan without change."

Suddenly, flying horses reported more than ten times, saying that Sima Yi led an army of 150,000 people to Wangxicheng. At that time, there were no generals around Kongming, only a group of civil servants. Half of the 5,000 troops he had brought in had already been transported in half, leaving only 2,500 troops in the city. When the officials heard the news, they were all pale. Kong Ming went to the city to look at it, and sure enough, the dust was rising into the sky, and the Wei soldiers were divided into two groups to look at Xicheng County. Kongming sent an order to hide all the flags and flags of the generals; all the generals guarded the city pavilion, and if anyone entered or exited the city rashly or spoke aloud, he would be executed immediately; the four gates were opened, and each gate used twenty soldiers, pretending to be common people, to sweep the streets. , If the Wei army arrives, do not move without authorization, I have my own plans. Kong Ming was wearing a crane cloak and a lun scarf, and led two children to carry a violin, and he sat on the fence in front of the enemy tower in the city, burning incense and playing the violin.","With just five thousand men he is suddenly informed that the Wei army of a hundred and fifty thousand are advancing on the city, led by Sima Yi. He immediately orders that all signs of occupation, such as banners, be removed and that everyone is to be hidden out of sight and not to make a sound. Then, wearing his customary Daoist robes, and accompanied by just two boys, he sits down on the city wall and plays a lute, as if nothing were troubling him.","All these arrangements made, Zhuge Liang took five thousand troops and set out for Xicheng to remove the stores. But messenger after messenger, more than ten of them, came to report: “Sima Yi is advancing rapidly on Xicheng with an army of one hundred fifty thousand troops.” No leader of rank was left to Zhuge Liang; he had only the civil officials and the five thousand soldiers, and as half this force had started to remove the stores, he had only two thousand five hundred left. His officers were all frightened at the news of near approach of the enemy. Zhuge Liang himself went up on the rampart to look around. He saw clouds of dust rising into the sky. The Wei armies were nearing Xicheng along two roads. Then he gave orders: “All the banners are to be removed and concealed. If any officer in command of soldiers in the city moves or makes any noise, he will be instantly put to death.” Next he threw open all the gates and set twenty soldiers dressed as ordinary people cleaning the streets at each gate. When all these preparations were complete, he donned the simple Taoist dress and, attended by a couple of lads, sat down on the wall by one of the towers with his lute before him and a stick of incense burning."
却說孔明將大軍屯於漢中，自回成都養病；文武官僚出城迎接，送入丞相府中；後主御駕自來問病，命御醫調治，日漸痊可。,"But it is said that Kongming put the army in Hanzhong and returned to Chengdu to recuperate; the civil and military bureaucrats went out of the city to meet them and sent them to the prime minister's residence; later, the emperor drove himself to ask about the disease, and ordered the imperial doctor to treat him, and he gradually recovered.",Sima Yi and Liu Ye are directed to join Cao Zhen and advance with four hundred thousand troops to seize the mountain pass into Shu and attack Hanzhong.,The officials of all ranks came to greet him and escort him to his palace.

Now relying on the danger of Lushui, deep ditches and high barriers are waiting for him; the people of Shu can't stand it. It is extremely hot, and we must retreat. At that time, you and I will follow him, and we will be able to capture Zhuge Liang."" After saying this, he laughed. Suddenly, one of the chiefs in the class said, ""The water in the mouth of the sand is shallow. If the soldiers from Shu are leaked, it will be of great benefit; you should divide the army to guard."" Huo laughed and said, ""You are a native of this place, why didn't you know? I was about to ask soldiers from Shu to come. If you cross this water, you will surely die in the water."" The chief said again, ""If there are natives who talk about the method of crossing at night, what should I do?"" Huo said, ""Don't be suspicious: the people in my territory are willing to help the enemy. ?"" Just as he was saying, he suddenly reported that there were not many Shu soldiers, secretly crossing the Lushui River, and following the Jiashan Food Road, under the banner of ""Pingbei General Ma Dai"". Huo laughed and said, ""How dare you measure this junior!"" You dispatched his lieutenant to grow his teeth, and led three thousand soldiers to Jiashanyu.","Meng Huo seriously underestimates the strength and resolve of Ma Dai, and his first attempt to shift him is a failure costing Meng Huo many men. So he sends the chieftain Dongtuna to attack, but, confronted by insults hurled by Ma Dai reminding him he has been pardoned by Kong Ming and set free, Dongtuna retreats in embarrassment.","Meng Huo, thinking all was safe during the hot season, was enjoying himself; wine and music were the order of the day, and military matters were far from his thoughts. In his cups he admitted Zhuge Liang was ruseful, but said his army had nothing to fear. “If I attempt to oppose Zhuge Liang, I shall certainly fall a victim to some wile of his. However, my waiting policy is a safe one. With our defenses, and the river to back them, we can wait for the heat to overcome these men of Shu, who cannot stand the hot season. They will have to retreat, and then we can harass them. And we will capture this Zhuge Liang.” He lay back and laughed at the thought. However, one chief, more prudent than the others, stood forth and said, “Remember the shallows at Shakou; it would be very serious if the soldiers of Shu got across there secretly. It ought to be guarded.” “You belong to these areas. Do you not know that I want the enemy to try to get across there? Why, they will all perish in the water.” “But what if the natives tell them to cross only in the night?” “Do not be so anxious,” said Meng Huo. “Our own people will not help the enemy that far.” It was just then that intelligence came: “The troops of Shu, unknown in number, have crossed the river and, moreover, have seized the Jiashan Gorge. The flags show the words 'General Ma Dai Who Pacifies The North.'“ Meng Huo affected indifference. “This sort of fellow is not worth talking about,” said he. He sent General Mangya Chang with three thousands troops to recapture the gorge and reopen the grain road."
張肅見了，大驚曰：“吾弟作滅門之事，不可不首。”連夜將書見劉璋，具言弟張松與劉備同謀，欲獻西川。劉璋大怒曰：“吾平日未嘗薄待他，何故欲謀反！”遂下令捉張松全家，盡斬於市。後人有詩歎曰：,"When Zhang Su saw it, he was startled and said, ""My younger brother has to do something to destroy the family."" Liu Zhang was furious and said, ""I have never treated him badly, so why do I want to rebel!"" He ordered Zhang Song's family to be captured and beheaded in the city. A later poem sighed and said:","Unfortunately, before he can send it he is interrupted by a visit from his brother. The letter is discovered, and, when Liu Zhang is told of it, Zhang Song and his entire family are executed in the public square. Here was a man unequalled in understanding,","“This plot of my brother's will end in the destruction of the whole family,” said Zhang Su. “I must get in the first word.” So at once he went in and laid the whole matter before the Imperial Protector. “I have always treated your brother so well!” said Liu Zhang, very angry. Liu Zhang issued orders to arrest Zhang Song and behead him and all his household in the market place. Zhang Song, such as he have been but few, Little thought he that a letter would betray When he plotted for another."

却說先主起兵東征。趙雲諫曰：“國賊乃曹操，非孫權也。今曹丕篡漢，神人共怒。陛下可早圖關中，屯兵渭河上流，以討凶逆，則關東義士，必裹糧策馬以迎王師；若舍魏以伐吳，兵勢一交，豈能驟解：願陛下察之。”先主曰：“孫權害了朕弟；又兼傅士仁、糜芳、潘璋、馬忠皆有切齒之讎；啖其肉而滅其族，方雪朕恨。卿何阻耶？”雲曰：“漢賊之讎，公也；兄弟之讎，私也。願以天下為重。”先主答曰：“朕不為弟報讎，雖有萬里江山，何足為貴？”遂不聽趙雲之諫，下令起兵伐吳；且發使往五谿，借番兵五萬，共相策應；一面差使往閬中，遷張飛為車騎將軍，領司隸校尉，封西鄕侯，兼閬中牧。使命齎詔而去。,"But he said that the First Sovereign raised his army and marched eastward. Zhao Yun admonished: ""The traitor is Cao Cao, not Sun Quan. Now Cao Pi has usurped the Han, and the gods and men are angry. Your Majesty can make plans for Guanzhong as soon as possible and station troops on the upper reaches of the Weihe River to deal with the rebellion, then the righteous people in Guandong will pack grain and ride horses to welcome the king. Master, if we abandon Wei to attack Wu, how can we suddenly resolve the situation: I hope Your Majesty will investigate it."" The First Lord said, ""Sun Quan harmed my younger brother, and Fu Shiren, Mi Fang, Pan Zhang, and Ma Zhong all gnashed their teeth. Fang Xue hates it. How can you stop me?"" Yun said: ""The thief of the Han Dynasty is the public; the brother's quarrel is the private. I hope the world is the most important."" The First Lord replied. He said, ""I will not repay my brother, although there are thousands of miles of rivers and mountains, why is it worth it?"" So he did not listen to Zhao Yun's advice, and ordered an army to attack Wu; The mission went to Langzhong, and Zhang Fei was moved to be the general of chariots and cavalry, and he led the commander of the clerk, and he was named the Marquis of Xiyan, and he was also the shepherd of Langzhong. The mission is gone.","To avenge his two brothers Xuande goes to war. Zhao Zilong’s protest is that the real enemy is Wei, not Wu. Cao Pi has usurped the imperial throne and tried to destroy the Han dynasty. This is where Xuande – [the first ruler, as we must now call him as the first ruler of the New Han, the Shu Han] – should strike first. To attack Sun Quan and Wu is to risk being exposed to an attack from Wei when the troops of Shu23 would be overstretched. The first ruler is furious at this, saying he has a sacred obligation to Guan Yu to avenge him. ‘Surely,’ replies Zhao Zilong, ‘this is a personal matter, whereas war against the Wei is a matter of honour and public duty.’ ‘What is the empire worth to me if I fail to avenge my brother?’ So saying, he puts in motion preparations for the invasion of Wu. As part of this he elevates Zhang Fei to a supreme commander position and sends for an additional fifty thousand troops from the Qiang people. Zhang Fei is based in Langzhong when the news is brought to him of the death of Guan Yu.","Eager For Vengeance, Zhang Fei Is Assassinated; Athirst Of Retribution, The First Ruler Goes To War. Zhao Yun was opposed to the attempt to fight Wu, and spoke against the plan. “The real rebel was not Sun Quan, but Cao Cao; and now it is his son who has usurped the Imperial Throne and called forth the anger of gods and men. You should first aim at the inside by camping on the River Wei, from which to attack the rebel. After that the right-thinking sort on the east of the Passes will do their utmost to help you. If you leave River Wei out of consideration in order to fight Wu, your military force will be engaged, and could you disengage it quickly in case of necessity? It is worth reflection.” The First Ruler replied, “Sun Quan slew my brother. Furthermore, Fu Shiren, Mi Fang, Pan Zhang, and Ma Zhong are on his side, all of whom I hate so much that I could eat their flesh with gusto and devour their relatives, whereby I should have my vengeance. Why, Noble Sir, do you obstruct me?” “Because the enmity against Cao Cao is a public matter; vengeance for the manner of your brother's end is private. The empire should be placed first.” “What care I for myriads of square miles of territory as long as my brother is unavenged?” So Zhao Yun's remonstrance was disregarded, and orders went forth to prepare an army against Wu. The First Ruler also sent into the Five Valleys to borrow the aid of fifty thousand of tribesmen. He sent a messenger to Langzhong conferring on Zhang Fei the rank of General of Chariots and Cavalry and the title of Lord of Xiliang. Zhang Fei became also Governor of Langzhong."
却說夏侯楙在長安聚集諸路軍馬。時有西涼大將韓德，善使開山大斧，有萬夫不當之勇，引西羌諸路兵八萬到來；見了夏侯楙，楙重賞之，就遣為先鋒。德有四子，皆精通武藝，弓馬過人：長子韓瑛，次子韓瑤，三子韓瓊，四子韓琪。韓德帶四子并西羌兵八萬，取路至鳳鳴山，正遇蜀兵。兩陣對圓。韓德出馬，四子列於兩邊。德厲聲大罵曰：“反國之賊，安敢犯吾境界！”趙雲大怒，挺鎗縱馬，單搦韓德交戰。長子韓瑛，躍馬來迎；戰不三合，被趙雲一鎗刺死於馬下。次子韓瑤見之，縱馬揮刀來戰。趙雲施逞舊日虎威，抖擻精神迎戰。瑤抵敵不住。三子韓瓊，急挺方天戟驟馬前來夾攻。雲全然不懼，鎗法不亂。四子韓琪，見二兄戰雲不下，也縱馬掄兩口日月刀而來，圍住趙雲。雲在中央獨戰三將。少時，韓琪中鎗落馬。韓陣中偏將急出救去。雲拖鎗便走。韓瓊按戟，急取弓箭射之：連放三箭，皆被雲用鎗撥落。瓊大怒，仍綽方天戟縱馬趕來；却被雲一箭射中面門，落馬而死。韓瑤縱馬舉寶刀便砍趙雲。雲棄鎗於地，閃過寶刀，生擒韓瑤歸陣，復縱馬取鎗殺過陣來。韓德見四子皆喪於趙雲之手，肝膽皆裂，先走入陣去。西涼兵素知趙雲之名，今見其英勇如昔，誰敢交鋒；趙雲馬到處，陣陣倒退。趙雲匹馬單鎗，往來衝突，如入無人之境。後人有詩讚曰：,"But it was said that Xiahou Mao gathered troops and horses from various routes in Chang'an. At that time, there was Han De, a general of the Western Liang Dynasty, who was good at making mountains and axe, and had the courage of ten thousand men, who led 80,000 soldiers from the Western Qiang to arrive. De has four sons, all of whom are proficient in martial arts and excellent in bowing and horses: the eldest son Han Ying, the second son Han Yao, the third son Han Qiong, and the fourth son Han Qi. Han De took his four sons and joined 80,000 Western Qiang soldiers to take the road to Fengming Mountain, where he encountered Shu soldiers. Two pairs of circles. Hande came out, and the four sons were listed on both sides. De scolded him sharply, ""An anti-national thief, dare to violate my realm!"" Zhao Yun was furious, he threw his spear and rode his horse, and fought against Han De. The eldest son, Han Ying, jumped on the horse to greet him; When the second son Han Yao saw him, he rode his horse to fight with a sword. Zhao Yunshi succeeded in his old tiger power, and fought with full spirit. Yao can't stand the enemy. The third son, Han Qiong, eagerly supported Fang Tianji and suddenly came to attack. Yun is not afraid at all, and his marksmanship is not disorderly. The fourth son, Han Qi, saw that the second brother could not fight against the clouds, so he also came forward with two sun and moon knives on his horse and surrounded Zhao Yun. Yun fought the three generals alone in the center. When she was young, Han Qi was shot and fell from the horse. The Han team will rush out to save them. Cloud dragged the gun and left. Han Qiong pressed the halberd and hurriedly took out a bow and arrow and shot it: three arrows were fired in a row, but they were all shot down by Yun's spear. Qiong was furious, and still Chuo Fang Tianji rushed over on his horse; but was shot by Yun Yi's arrow in the face and fell off his horse to his death. Han Yao slashed Zhao Yun with a sword. Yun abandoned the spear on the ground, flashed the treasured sword, captured Han Yao alive and returned to the formation, and then returned to his horse to take the gun and kill him. Han De saw that the four sons were all lost at the hands of Zhao Yun, and their livers and gallbladders were split, so he went into the battle first. The soldiers of Xiliang know Zhao Yun's name well, but now that he is as brave as before, who would dare to confront him; Zhao Yun single-handedly, the conflict, as if entering a no-man's land. A later poem praised:","Xiahou Mao has gathered his forces at Chang’an, where he is joined by troops from the Qiang tribes led by their chieftain Han De and his four sons. He is an enormous fellow wielding a huge battleaxe. When the two armies meet the first challenge is thrown down by Han De and his four sons. Enraged, Zhao Zilong charges into battle and in the space of a few minutes kills the eldest son. This brings the three other brothers into battle with Zhao Zilong. He fights them alone, killing another of the sons, wounding one, who is rescued by his own men, and capturing the last son, Han Yao. At the sight of such slaughter, Han De flees, and his troops with him, though they sustain huge losses at the hands of Zhao Zilong and his men. It is a great victory for Shu. As a poet has said:","Xiahou Mao was at Changan preparing his force. There came to him a general from Xiliang, named Han De, a man of great valor, whose weapon was a mighty battle-ax called “Mountain Splitter.” He brought with him eighty thousand of the Qiang tribesmen and offered his services. They were gladly accepted, and his army was made the van of the attack. This Han De had four sons, all very expert in archery and horsemanship. They were named Han Ying, Han Yao, Han Qiong, and Han Qi, and they came to serve under their father. Han De led his sons and the eighty thousand troops by the road to Phoenix Song Mountain, where they were near the army of Shu, and here they drew up the array. When the battle line was in order, the father, with his four sons, rode to the front and began to revile their enemy, shouting, “Rebels and raiders! How dare you invade our territory?” Zhao Yun quickly lost his temper, rode forward and challenged. The eldest son, Han Ying, accepted and galloped out; but he was slain in the third bout. Immediately his brother Han Yao went out, whirling his sword. But now Zhao Yun's blood was up, and the old dash and vigor came upon him so that the young man had no chance to win the battle. Then the third son, Han Qiong, took his great halberd and dashed out to his brother's aid. Zhao Yun had now two opponents; nevertheless he held his own, nor blenched nor failed a stroke. Seeing that his two brothers were nearing defeat, the fourth son Han Qi went to join in the fray with his pair of swords that he had named “Sun and Moon.” And there was the veteran warrior with three against him, and he still kept them at bay. Presently a spear thrust got home on Han Qi, who fell. Another general then coming out to take his place. Zhao Yun lowered his spear and fled. Han Qiong then took his bow and shot three arrows at the fugitive, who turned them aside so that they fell harmless. Angry at this, Han Qiong again seized his halberd and went in pursuit. But Zhao Yun took his bow and shot an arrow that wounded his pursuer in the face. So Han Qiong fell and died. Han Yao then galloped up and raised his sword to strike, but Zhao Yun slipped past, got within his guard and made Han Yao a prisoner. Zhao Yun quickly galloped into his own array with his captive, dropped him and then, dashing out, recovered his spear, which had fallen when he seized his man. Han De was overwhelmed with the loss of all his sons and went behind the battle array. His Qiang tribesmen were too frightened at the prowess of Zhao Yun to be of any use in battle, and no one dared to meet the old warrior. So they retired, while Zhao Yun rode to and fro among them slaying at his will. I thought of brave old people, of Zhao Yun, Who, spite of numbered years three scores and ten, Was marvelous strong in battle; who one day"
却說東吳大將軍孫綝，聽知全端、唐咨等降魏，勃然大怒，將各人家眷，盡皆斬之。吳主孫亮，時年方十六，見綝殺戮太過，心甚不然。一日出西苑，因食生梅，令黃門取蜜。須臾取至，見蜜內有鼠糞數塊，召藏吏責之。藏吏叩首曰：“臣封閉甚嚴，安有鼠糞？”亮曰：“黃門曾向爾求蜜食否？”藏吏曰：“黃門於數日前曾求蜜食，臣實不敢與。”亮指黃門曰：“此必汝怒藏吏不與爾蜜，故置糞於蜜中，以陷之也。”黃門不服。亮曰：“此事易知耳：若糞久在蜜中，則內外皆濕；若新在蜜中，則外濕內燥。”命剖視之，果然內燥，黃門服罪：亮之聰明，大抵如此——雖然聰明，却被孫綝把持，不能主張。綝之弟威遠將軍孫據入蒼龍宿衞；武衞將軍孫恩、偏將軍孫幹、長水校尉孫闓，分屯諸營。,"However, Sun Chen, the general of the Eastern Wu Dynasty, was furious when he heard that Quan Duan, Tang Zi and others had surrendered to Wei, and beheaded everyone's family members. Sun Liang, the master of Wu, was only sixteen years old, and when he saw that the killing was too much, his heart was very different. One day out of Xiyuan, because of eating raw plums, Huangmen was asked to fetch honey. After taking it in an instant, I saw that there were several pieces of rat dung in the honey, and I called Tibetan officials to blame. The Tibetan official bowed his head and said, ""The minister is very closed, and there is no rat dung?"" Liang said, ""Has the Huangmen asked you for honey?"" The Tibetan official said, ""The Huangmen asked for honey a few days ago, but the minister does not. Dare to do it."" Liang pointed to the Huangmen and said, ""This will make you angry that the Tibetan officials will not meet Ermi, so you put dung in the honey to trap it."" Huangmen refused to accept it. Liang said, ""It's easy to know: if the dung has been in the honey for a long time, it will be wet inside and out; if it is new in the honey, then the outside will be wet and the inside will be dry."" Smart, probably so - although smart, he was controlled by Sun Chen and could not advocate. Chen's younger brother Weiyuan General Sun Ju entered Canglong Suwei; Wuwei General Sun En, Pian General Sun Gan, and Changshui Colonel Sun Kai were divided into camps.","Sun Chen has all the families of the commanders executed. By now the ruler of Wu, Sun Liang, who is only sixteen years old, is completely in the control of Sun Chen.","The Prime Minister of Wu, Sun Chen, was greatly angered by the desertion of so many of his soldiers and officers to Wei, and revenged himself by putting their families to death. The Ruler of Wu, Sun Liang, disapproved of these acts of cruelty, but he was powerless. The young Emperor was of an ingenious turn of mind. One day he went to the West Park to eat of the newly ripened plums. He bade one of the eunuchs bring some honey. It was brought, but there were mouse droppings in it. The Ruler of Wu called the storekeeper and blamed him for carelessness. The storekeeper said, “We are very careful to keep the stores in good order, and the honey cannot not possibly have been fouled in the storehouse.” “Has any one asked you for honey lately?” asked the Ruler of Wu. “One of the eunuchs asked for some a few days ago. I refused him.” The Ruler of Wu called the named eunuch and said, “You defiled the honey out of spite.” The man denied it. “It is very easy to tell,” said the Ruler of Wu. “If the dirt has been lying in the honey for some time it will be wet all through.” Then the Ruler of Wu ordered them to cut one of the lumps, and it was quite dry inside. The eunuch then confessed. This shows the Ruler of Wu was quick-witted. But clever as he was, he could not control his Prime Minister, whose relatives were in command of all the garrisons and armies, so that he was unassailable. His four brothers all had high offices: Sun Jun was General Who Terrifies Distant Regions and Commander of Imperial Guards; Sun En, General Who Shows Prowess; Sun Gan, Imperial Commander; and Sun Kai, Commander of Changshui."

早有細作報入東吳。吳侯孫權會文武商議。顧雍進曰：“劉備分兵遠涉山險而去，未易往還。何不差一軍先截川口，斷其歸路，後盡起東吳之兵，一鼓而下荊襄？此不可失之機會也。”權曰：“此計大妙！”正商議間，忽屏後一人大喝而出曰：“進此計者可斬之！欲害吾女之命耶？”衆驚視之，乃吳國太也。國太怒曰：“吾一生惟有一女，嫁與劉備。今若動兵，吾女性命如何？”因叱孫權曰：“汝掌父兄之業，坐領八十一州，尚自不足，乃顧小利而不念骨肉！”孫權喏喏連聲，答曰：“老母之訓，豈敢有違！”遂叱退衆官。國太恨恨而入。孫權立於軒下，自思：“此機會一失，荊襄何日可得？”正沈吟間，只見張昭入問曰：“主公有何憂疑？”孫權曰：“正思適間之事。”張昭曰：“此極易也。今差心腹將一人，只帶五百軍，潛入荊州，下一封密書與郡主，只說國太病危，欲見親女，取郡主星夜回東吳。玄德平生只有一子，就敎帶來。那時玄德定把荊州來換阿斗。如其不然，一任動兵，更有何礙？”權曰：“此計大妙！吾有一人，姓周，名善，最有膽量。自幼穿房入戶，多隨吾兄。今可差他去。”昭曰：“切勿漏洩。只此便令起行。”,"There has long been a detailed report into Soochow. The Marquis of Wu and Sun Quan met to discuss civil and military affairs. Gu Yongjin said: ""Liu Bei divided his troops and traveled far and across the mountains, and it was not easy to return. Why not send an army to cut off the Chuankou first, cut off its return route, and then use the troops of Eastern Wu to descend to Jingxiang in one drum? This is an opportunity not to be missed."" Quan said, ""This plan is great!"" During the discussion, a person behind the screen shouted loudly and said, ""Those who enter this plan can be executed! Do you want to kill my daughter?"" . Guo Tai was angry and said, ""I have only one daughter in my life, and I am married to Liu Bei. If I go to war now, what will happen to my daughter's fate?"" Because of his scolding Sun Quan, he said, ""You are in charge of your father and brother's business, and you are in charge of eighty-one prefectures. You are not enough. It is to take care of Xiaoli and not to think of flesh and blood!"" Sun Quan said repeatedly, ""How dare you violate the instructions of my mother!"" He then dismissed the officials. The country is too hateful to enter. Sun Quan stood at Xuanxia and thought to himself, ""If this opportunity is lost, when will Jingxiang get it?"" While he was pondering, Zhang Zhaojin asked, ""Do you have any doubts, my lord?"" Zhang Zhao said: ""This is very easy. Today, I have sent one confidant, with only 500 troops, to sneak into Jingzhou, and the next secret letter to the county master, only that the country is too ill, I want to see my own daughter, and take the county master. Xingye went back to Eastern Wu. Xuande had only one son in his life, so he brought it with him. At that time, Xuande decided to exchange Jingzhou for Adou. If not, what would be the hindrance to deploying troops at any time?"" Quan said, ""This is a great plan! I have a person whose surname is Zhou and whose name is Shan. He is the most courageous. He has been in the house since he was a child, and he mostly follows my brother. Now I can send him."" Zhao said, ""Don't leak it. That's all I have to do.""","Back in the land of Wu in the south, the events in Shu – the Riverlands – are, of course, reported by spies to Sun Quan. Gu Yong, seeing that this offers an opportunity to seize Jingzhou, recommends to Sun Quan that, with Xuande gone, they should attack. Before any further plans can be developed, however, someone shouts from behind a screen, ‘This will mean the death of my daughter!’, and out steps a furious queen mother. ‘My only daughter is Xuande’s wife. You attack, and what will become of her? Eh! Answer me. Go on! My son, you have the eighty-one regions of the south. Is this not enough? Must you put at risk your own flesh and blood?’ Mortified, and with no other alternative, Sun Quan apologizes time and time again for putting his sister at risk. So it seems the plan is over before it begins, but that night, when Sun Quan is reflecting on the day’s events, Zhang Zhao comes to him with another plot: ‘Give me five hundred men, and I’ll get into Jingzhou and present Lady Sun with a letter. This will say her mother is dying and wishes more than anything to see her before she dies. I’ll make sure that she leaves with her son – because Xuande will willingly surrender Jingzhou in return for his only heir.’ Sun Quan is delighted and readily agrees. Zhao Shan, a loyal man trusted by Lady Sun, is sent to carry out the scheme. The letter is forged and handed over to Zhao Shan.","Arrived there, Liu Bei soon won the hearts of the people by the strict discipline he maintained over his army and by his gracious manner. News of these doings in the west duly reached the south, and Sun Quan summoned his counselors as to his countermove. Then Gu Yong spoke, saying, “I have an infallible plan to propose. Liu Bei and his army are now far away and separated from us by difficult country. Therefore he cannot return quickly, and my advice is to occupy the passes so that he cannot get through. Then send all your force against Jingzhou and Xiangyang, and they will surely fall to you.” “The plan seems excellent,” said Sun Quan. But just then a voice was heard from behind the screen, crying, “You may just put to death the man who proposed that scheme for trying to compass the death of my daughter.” Every one started with surprise. It was the Dowager Marchioness' voice. Further, Lady Wu looked very angry as she entered, saying, “What is to become of my only daughter, who is the wife of Liu Bei?” She turned her wrathful eyes to Sun Quan and said, “You were heir to your father and brother and obtained possession of all these lands without the least effort. Yet you are dissatisfied and would forget the claims of your own flesh and blood and sacrifice your sister for the sake of adding a little to your lands.” “No, no!” murmured Sun Quan, ashamed. “I would never think of going contrary to my mother's wishes and orders.” He abruptly dismissed the assembly, and when they had gone the old lady, still nursing her wrath, retired to her own apartments. Left alone beneath the portico, Sun Quan sighed sadly. “This chance missed! When will Jingzhou be mine?” thought he. While still deep in reverie, Zhang Zhao came up, saying, “What grieves my lord?” “No great matter; only this last failure to gain my ends.” “The difficulty may be easily removed,” said Zhang Zhao. “Choose some trusty man and charge him with a secret letter to Princess Sun Ren saying that her mother is dangerously ill. Give him five hundred men as escort and tell him to make his way privily into Jingzhou City and deliver the letter. Hearing her mother wants her, she will rush home at once, and she might bring with her the only son of Liu Bei. Liu Bei will be glad enough to exchange Jingzhou for his son. If he will not, you can still send the army.” “That sounds like a good plan,” said Sun Quan. “Further, I have the man to carry it out successfully. He is that Zhou Shan, who was a bold one. He used to accompany my brother in his youth. He is the man to go.” “Keep it a secret, then,” said Zhang Zhao, “and let Zhou Shan start quickly.”"

Zhang Bao and Guan Xing came out together. Guan Xing was immediately in front of the formation, and Shan Zhai confronted Sun Huan. Huan was furious, slapped his horse and waved his sword, and fought with Guan Xing for more than thirty times. The second generals chased and entered the camp, and Wu Ban led Zhang Nan and Feng Xi to drive the soldiers to cover the kill. Zhang Bao bravely took the lead and entered the Wu army, but when he met Xie Jing, he was stabbed to death by Zhang Bao with a spear. Wu Jun ran in all directions. The general of Shu was victorious and withdrew his troops, but Guan Xing was nowhere to be seen. Zhang Bao was startled and said, ""Anguo is at a loss, I am not the only child!"" After saying this, he mounted his horse. After searching for miles, I saw Guan Xing carrying a knife in his left hand and a general in his right hand. Bao asked, ""Who is this?"" Xingxiao replied, ""I was in the midst of a chaotic army, and I was in the middle of a chaotic army, so I was caught by someone alive."" Bao looked at him: it was Tan Xiong, who shot the cold arrow yesterday. Bao was overjoyed, and returned to the camp together, beheaded and drained blood, and sacrificed the dead horse. So he wrote a watch and sent people to the First Sovereign to report victory.","The next day Sun Huan again taunts the two young men, and again they triumph. Charging forward, Zhang Bao slays Xie Jing, and the troops of Wu scatter, fleeing every which way. But at battle’s end there is no sign of Guan Xing. Profoundly alarmed and shouting that he cannot live if Guan Xing does not, Zhang Bao goes in search of him and finds him holding captive the very man, Tan Xiong, who fired the arrow. Dragging him back to their camp, they execute him and pour his blood as a sacrifice to the spirit of the slain horse. With the troops of Sun Huan demoralized and broken, the Shu commanders decide to attack their camp but they are aware that Zhu Ran’s navy is untouched and powerful and fear an attack from the rear if they press forward too quickly.","Next day Sun Huan came out to offer battle again, and the two cousins went forth together. Guan Xing, from horseback by the main standard, challenged his enemy. Sun Huan rode out fiercely, and they two fought near thirty bouts. But Sun Huan was not strong enough and drew off. The two youths followed and reached his camp. Wu Ban, together with Feng Xi and Zhang Nan, also launched another attack. Zhang Bao helped them with all his force and was the first to force his way into the ranks of Wu. He came across Xie Jing, whom he slew with a spear thrust. The soldiers of Wu scattered and fled, and the victory was on the side of Shu. But Guan Xing was missing. Zhang Bao was desperate, saying, “If something wrong happens to Guan Xing, I will not live!” So he girded on his huge spear and rode far and wide seeking him. Presently he met Guan Xing, bearing his sword in his left hand, while his right held a captive. “Who is this?” asked Zhang Bao. “In the melee I met an enemy,” cried Guan Xing, “and I took him prisoner.” Then Zhang Bao recognized Tan Xiong, the man who had let fly the treacherous arrow that had brought down his horse. The two returned to camp, where they slew their prisoner and poured a libation of his blood to the dead horse. After this they drew up a report of the victory for the First Ruler."
鈞領命，引一萬人至長安，命周圍搭起木架，上柏梁臺去。不移時間，五千人連繩引索，旋環而上。那柏梁臺高二十丈，銅柱圓十圍。馬鈞敎先拆銅人。多人併力拆下銅人來，只見銅人眼中潸然淚下。衆皆大驚。忽然臺邊一陣狂風起處，飛砂走石，急若驟雨；一聲響喨，就如天崩地裂：臺傾柱倒，壓死千餘人。鈞取銅人及金盤回洛陽，入見魏主，獻上銅人、承露盤。魏主問曰：“銅柱安在？”鈞奏曰：“柱重百萬斤，不能運至。”叡令將銅柱打碎，運來洛陽，鑄成兩個銅人，號為‘翁仲’，列於司馬門外；又鑄銅龍鳳兩個：龍高四丈，鳳高三丈餘，一立在殿前。又於上林苑中，種奇花異木，蓄養珍禽怪獸。少傅楊阜上表諫曰：,"Jun took the order, led 10,000 people to Chang'an, ordered a wooden frame to be erected around him, and went up to Bailiangtai. Without changing time, 5,000 people connected ropes to index and circled up. The Bailiang platform is twenty zhang high, and the bronze columns are surrounded by ten circles. Ma Junchi first dismantled the bronze figurines. Many people worked together to tear down the bronze figurines, only to see tears welling up in the bronze figurines' eyes. Everyone was shocked. Suddenly, a gust of wind rose from the side of the platform, flying sand and rocks, and it was as urgent as a shower; Jun took the bronze figurine and the golden plate and returned to Luoyang, where he saw the Lord of Wei and presented the bronze figurine and the Chenglu plate. Lord Wei asked, ""Is the copper column safe?"" Jun Zuo said, ""The column weighs one million catties and cannot be transported here."" Rui Ling smashed the copper column and transported it to Luoyang, where it was cast into two bronze figures, named ' Weng Zhong', listed outside the Sima Gate; and two bronze dragons and phoenixes: the dragon is four feet high and the phoenix is more than three feet high, and one stands in front of the hall. In Shanglin Garden, he planted exotic flowers and trees, and kept rare birds and monsters. Young Master Yang Fu remonstrated on the table and said:","Finally, Cao Rui demolishes the huge bronze statue, created centuries before, which stands in Chang’an and, so legend tells, brought longevity to the greatest of the Han rulers. Its main feature is a bowl held in the hands of the statue on top of the immensely tall pillar of bronze. This bowl catches the early morning dew. Mixed with fragments of jade, it is believed that this dew is the elixir of life. And it is this that Cao Rui wants to have in his new palace. Many inauspicious signs and events take place as the workmen try to demolish this strange monument, but nothing seems to touch Cao Rui’s heart or mind. Not even when one official points out that the greatest rulers of the past – Yao, Yu the Great – only built with thatch and lived in simple homes, while the worst of ancient rulers – men such as Jie or Zhou – lived in extravagant palaces and brought ruin on their dynasties: for example, the first emperor of the Qin, whose vast palaces did not survive for even one more reign, as his son was overthrown.","As the Ruler of Wei commanded, they took ten thousand workers to Changan, and they built a scaffold around the figure. Then they attached ropes to haul it down. The terrace being two hundred feet high and the pedestal ten cubits in circumference, Ma Jun bade his laborers first detach the bronze image. They did so and brought it down. Its eyes were moist as with tears, and the workers were affrighted. Then suddenly beside the terrace sprang up a whirlwind, with dust and pebbles flying thick as a shower of rain, and there was a tempestuous roar as of an earthquake. Down fell the pedestal, and the platform crumbled, crushing a thousand people to death. However, the bronze figure and the golden bowl were conveyed to Luoyang and presented to the Emperor. “Where is the pedestal?” asked the Ruler of Wei. “It is too heavy to transport,” replied the Ma Jun. “It weighs a million and half of pounds.” Wherefore the Ruler of Wei ordered the pillar to be broken up and the metal brought, and from this he caused to be cast two figures which he named Saints of Wengzhong. They were placed outside the gate of the Board of War. A pair of dragons and a pair of phoenixes were also cast, the dragons forty feet high and the birds thirty. These were placed in front of the Hall of Audience. Moreover, in the Fragrant Forest Park the Ruler of Wei planted wonderful flowers and rare trees, and he also established a menagerie of strange animals. Yang Fu remonstrated with the Emperor on these extravagances."
却說馬超與龐德、馬岱商議，逕往漢中投張魯。張魯大喜，以為得馬超，則西可以吞益州，東可以拒曹操，乃商議欲以女招超為壻。大將楊柏諫曰：“馬超妻子遭慘禍，皆超之貽害也。主公豈可以女與之？”魯從其言，遂罷招壻之議。或以楊柏之言，告知馬超。超大怒，有殺楊柏之意。楊柏知之，與兄楊松商議，亦有圖馬超之心。正值劉璋遣使求救於張魯，魯不從。忽報劉璋又遣黃權到。權先來見楊松，說：“東西兩川，實為脣齒；西川若破，東川亦難保矣。今若肯相救，當以二十州相酬。”松大喜，卽引黃權來見張魯，說脣齒利害，更以二十州相謝。魯喜其利，從之。巴西閻圃諫曰：“劉璋與主公世讎，今事急求救，詐許割地，不可從也。”忽階下一人進曰：“某雖不才，願乞一旅之師，生擒劉備。務要割地以還。”正是：,"However, Ma Chao negotiated with Pang De and Ma Dai and went straight to Hanzhong to vote for Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu was overjoyed, thinking that with Ma Chao, he could swallow Yizhou in the west and reject Cao Cao in the east. The general Yang Bo said: ""Ma Chao's wife suffered a tragic disaster, and all Chao was harmed. How can the lord have a daughter with him?"" Or tell Ma Chao in the words of Yang Bo. Very angry, with the intention of killing Yang Bo. Yang Bo knew about it and discussed it with his brother Yang Song, and he also had the heart of Tu Ma Chao. Just when Liu Zhang sent an envoy to ask Zhang Lu for help, Lu refused. He suddenly reported that Liu Zhang had sent Huang Quan again. Quan first came to see Yang Song and said: ""The two rivers in the east and the west are really like lips and teeth; if the west river is broken, the east river will not be preserved. Speaking of the benefits and harms of lips and teeth, I would like to thank each other with twenty states. Lu likes its benefits, follow it. Brazil Yanpu said: ""Liu Zhang and the lord Shiyu are urgently asking for help now, and they are cheating on ceding the land, and they cannot follow."" Suddenly, a person came in and said, ""Although a certain person is not talented, I would like to beg a teacher from a journey to capture Liu Bei alive. The land is to be repaid."" It is:","Zhang Lu even contemplates making Ma Chao his son-in-law, but one of his advisers, Yang Bo, strongly resists this, pointing out that Ma Chao’s actions have led to the death of his entire family, so this is not a good augury. When Ma Chao hears of this, he swears to exact revenge on Yang Bo, while Yang Bo swears to get rid of Ma Chao! At this moment the letter from Liu Zhang arrives proposing an alliance against Xuande. Initially Zhang Lu refuses, but when a second letter arrives, his adviser Yang Song reads it and recommends that, seeing that Liu Zhang is offering to make over twenty cities to Zhang Lu, this is too good an offer to refuse. In the ensuing debate, the opinion goes this way and that until a man stands up and says, ‘I’ve but little fame but I can capture Xuande and make Liu Zhang honour his promise of twenty cities. I just need a few soldiers.’","Having escaped from their pursuers, Ma Chao and his few followers decided to make for Hanzhong and offer their services to Governor Zhang Lu. Zhang Lu received them gladly, for he thought with such help he could certainly get possession of Yiazhou on the west as well as repel Cao Cao on the east. More than this, he thought to cement the friendship by giving Ma Chao a daughter to wife. But this displeased one of his generals, Yang Bo. “The misfortune that befell Ma Chao's wife and family was entirely the fault of his own misconduct. Would you give your daughter to such as he to wife?” said Yang Bo. Zhang Lu again considered the matter and abandoned his intention. But a certain busybody told Ma Chao what had been proposed and that Yang Bo had defeated the scheme. Whereupon Ma Chao was very annoyed and sought to compass the death of Yang Bo. Yang Bo and his brother, Yang Song, on the other side conspired to destroy Ma Chao. At this time a messenger from Liu Zhang of Yiazhou arrived in Hanzhong begging for assistance against the invader Liu Bei. Zhang Lu refused help. But then Huang Quan came on the same errand. He first saw Yang Song and talked to him and brought him to favor the scheme. Huang Quan said, “The Eastern and Western Lands of Rivers, which stand next each other as the lips are close to the teeth, are interdependent. If Yiazhou is lost, Hanzhong has little chance to survive. On the other hand, once relieved by your help, Imperial Protector Liu Zhang will reward twenty counties to Hanzhong as compensation.” So Huang Quan won over Yang Song, who led him to see his master. To Zhang Lu again Huang Quan spoke forcibly and laid the matter before him so cogently that Zhang Lu promised his help. Yan Pu, one of Zhang Lu's officers, tried to dissuade him by pointing out the old enmity between him and Liu Zhang, but another suddenly interjected, saying, “Useless I may be, but if you will give me troops, I will capture this Liu Bei and you will retain all your land.” The land's true lord goes west and then"

衆將聽了，皆以為懦。次日，吳班引兵到關前搦戰，耀武揚威，辱罵不絕；多有解衣卸甲，赤身裸體，或睡或坐。徐盛、丁奉入帳稟陸遜曰：“蜀兵欺我太甚！某等願出擊之！”遜笑曰：“公等但恃血氣之勇，未知孫、吳妙法。此彼誘敵之計也：三日後必見其詐矣。”徐盛曰：“三日後，彼移營已定，安能擊之乎？”遜曰：“吾正欲令彼移營也。”諸將哂笑而退。過三日後，會諸將於關上觀望，見吳班兵已退去。遜指曰：“殺氣起矣：劉備必從山谷中出也。”言未畢，只見蜀兵皆全裝慣束，擁先主而過。吳兵見了，盡皆膽裂。遜曰：“吾之不聽諸公擊班者，正為此也。今伏兵已出，旬日之內，必破蜀矣。”諸將皆曰：“破蜀當在初時；今連營五六百里，相守經七八月，其諸要害，皆已固守，安能破乎？”遜曰：“諸公不知兵法：備乃世之梟雄，更多智謀，其兵始集，法度精專；今守之久矣，不得我便，兵疲意阻，取之正在今日。”諸將方纔歎服。後人有詩讚曰：,"When the generals heard it, they all thought it was cowardly. The next day, Wu Ban led his troops to the front of the gate to fight, showing off his strength and swearing; many of them took off their clothes and armor, naked, sleeping or sitting. Xu Sheng and Ding Feng entered the tent and told Lu Xun, ""The soldiers of Shu have deceived me too much! A certain class is willing to attack it!"" Xun laughed and said, ""You are only relying on the courage of your blood, and you don't know Sun and Wu Miao's law. Also: After three days, I will see his deception."" Xu Sheng said, ""After three days, the camp will be moved, can you attack him?"" Xun said, ""I'm just about to order him to move the camp."" The generals laughed and retreated. . After three days, the generals of the General Assembly closed the gate and watched, and saw that the Wu Ban soldiers had retreated. Xun Zhi said, ""The murderous aura is on the rise: Liu Bei must emerge from the valley."" Before he could finish his words, he saw that the soldiers of Shu were all dressed up and used to their attire, and passed by with the First Sovereign. When Wu Bing saw it, he was all gutted. Xun said, ""That's why I don't listen to the princes attacking the squad. Now the ambush has been dispatched, and within ten days, the Shu will be broken."" Camp five or six hundred li, guarding each other for seven or eight months, all of its key points have been firmly guarded, can it be broken?"" Xun said: ""The masters do not know the art of warfare: Bei is the hero of the world, more wise and resourceful, and his troops began to gather. I have been guarding it for a long time now, and I can't help it, and the soldiers are tired and want to block it, so I have to take it today."" The generals were just in admiration. A later poem praised:","‘Watch,’ he says. ‘In a moment Xuande will appear with the ambush troops bored of waiting.’ And right on cue the first ruler does indeed appear with his troops. ‘Now we can attack and destroy their string of camps,’ says Lu Xun.","Those who heard this took it only as another proof of the imbecility of their pedant commander. Next day Wu Ban's soldiers approached closer and challenged to battle, swaggering about and brandishing their weapons and shouting volleys of abuse without end. They manifested contempt by throwing off their armor and clothing and moving to and fro with the utmost carelessness, bare bodies and naked forms, blatantly unready to fight. Some even sat or lay asleep. Xu Sheng and Ding Feng came to the commander's tent to complain, saying, “Those Shu soldiers despise us so much. Let us go out and punish them!” But Lu Xun only smiled, saying, “You see everything from the point of view of brute courage. You seem not to know the principles of war laid down by Sun Zi and Wu Qi. This display is only meant to entice us into fight. You will see the pretense yourselves in about three days.” “In three days the change of camp will be complete, and the enemy will be too strongly posted for our success,” said they. “I am just letting them move their camp.” Xu Sheng and Ding Feng left the tent also sniggering. But on the third day the officers were assembled at a look-out point whence they saw that Wu's army had left. “There is still a deadly look over the valley,” said Lu Xun. “Liu Bei will soon appear.” Very soon they saw a whole army all well accoutered pass across the field escorting the First Ruler. And the sight took away all their courage. “That is why I would not listen to those of you who wanted to fight Wu Ban,” said Lu Xun. “Now that the ambush has been withdrawn, we can settle them in about ten days.” “The proper time to attack was when they began to transfer their camp. Now they are fully established with encampments stretching two hundred miles. Having spent seven or eight months in strengthening where they might be attacked, will it not be difficult to destroy them?” said they. “I see you do not understand how to carry on war. This man Liu Bei is a capable and crafty man. When he first started on this expedition his methods were of the best, and he kept to them for a long time, so we gave him no chance against us. When his troops are worn out and his thoughts cease to be clear, that will be our day to attack.” At last they agreed with their chief. The general discoursed on war, According to the book;"

A close official said: ""Sima Yiguo led more than 100,000 troops to come to resist, and he really has his heart against it."" Rui panic ordered Cao Xiuxian to lead the army to meet him. When Sima Yi saw the soldiers and horses approaching, he only suspected that the chariots were coming in person, and bowed down to greet him. Cao Xiu went out and said, ""Zhongda has been entrusted by the late emperor so much, why did he oppose him?"" Take a break. Yi said: ""This is a plan between the Wu and Shu spies, who want to make my ruler and his ministers kill each other, but he takes advantage of the weakness to attack. I should see the emperor defend it."" Said: ""I have been entrusted by the late emperor to the solitary weight, and An dare to have a different intention? It must be a treacherous plan of Wu and Shu. Please mention a journey of teachers, first break Shu, then attack Wu, and report the late emperor and His Majesty, so as to clarify the heart of the minister."" Rui's doubts remain unresolved. Hua Xin played and said, ""You can't give up your military power. You can stop and return to the fields."" Rui Yi said, cut Sima Yi from his post and returned to Yan, and ordered Cao Xiu's governor Yong and Liang Junma. Cao Rui drove back to Luoyang.","So with a hundred thousand soldiers Cao Rui goes to Anyi. In all innocence and wanting to impress the Son of Heaven, Sima Yi brings thousands of his troops, cavalry and infantry to greet Cao Rui. Cao Rui leads the imperial vanguard and when he meets Sima Yi he demands to know why he is in rebellion. Sima Yi is appalled at this accusation and swears that this must be the work of Wu and Shu. To show goodwill he orders his army to retire. However, not even Sima Yi’s bowing deep before the imperial carriage has the desired effect. On Hua Xin’s advice Sima Yi is stripped of his post and ordered to return to his ancestral village – a huge disgrace.","Ignorant of the reason of the Emperor's coming, and anxious to show off his dignity, Sima Yi went to welcome his ruler in all the pomp of a commander of a great army. As Sima Yi approached, the courtiers told the Emperor, saying, “Sima Yi's defection is certain since such a large army can only mean that he is prepared to resist.” Whereupon Cao Xiu, with a large force, was sent in front to meet him. Sima Yi thought the Imperial Chariot was coming, and he advanced alone and stood humbly by the roadside till Cao Xiu came up. Cao Xiu advanced and said, “Friend, His late Majesty entrusted you with the heavy responsibility of caring for his son; why are you in revolt?” Sima Yi turned pale, and a cold sweat broke out all over him as he asked the reason for such a charge. Cao Xiu told him what had occurred. “This is a vile plot on the part of our rivals, Shu and Wu, to cause dissension,” said Sima Yi. “It is a design to make the Emperor work evil upon his ministers that thereby another may profit. I must see the Son of Heaven and explain.” Ordering his army to retire, Sima Yi went forward alone to the Emperor's chariot, bowed low and said, weeping “His late Majesty gave me charge of his son; could I betray him? This is a wile of the enemy. I crave permission to lead an army, first to destroy Shu and then to attack Wu, whereby to show my gratitude to the late Emperor and Your Majesty and manifest my own true heart.” However, Cao Rui did not feel quite convinced, and Hua Xin said, “In any case withdraw his military powers and let him go into retirement.” And thus it was decided. Sima Yi was forced to retire to his native village. Cao Xiu succeeded to his command, and Cao Rui returned to Luoyang."

Da was shocked and misbehaved. Suddenly the mission arrived, and Liu Feng was transferred back to Mianzhu. Meng Da hurriedly asked Shangyong, the commander of Fangling, Shen Dan, and brothers Shen Yi to discuss and said: ""I and Fa Xiaozhi have both contributed to King Hanzhong; What can I do for it?"" Dan said, ""There is a plan to prevent the king of Hanzhong from harming the public."" Da was overjoyed and asked what plan. Tan said: ""My brother has been trying to join Wei for a long time; you can make a statement, resign from the King of Hanzhong, and join the King of Wei, Cao Pi. Pi will be used again. The two of us will also come to surrender."" , paid to the envoy; that night, he led more than fifty cavalry to go to Wei. The mission was to return to Chengdu with a watch, to play on the King of Hanzhong, and to speak of Mengda's surrender to Wei. The First Lord was furious. Looking at the table it says:","Alongside these concerns, Xuande also wants to avenge Guan Yu and his son, and to do this it is suggested that Liu Feng and Meng Da should be punished for having failed to come to their rescue. It is decided to split them up and send Liu Feng to govern Mianzhu so they can’t confer, and then they can be picked off one by one. This news alerts Meng Da to the fact that plots are afoot. When he receives official notice that Liu Feng is being despatched to Mianzhu on Kong Ming’s orders, he decides to rebel. That very night he leaves with fifty riders and deserts to join the king of Wei. When the messenger who took the notice to Meng Da returns with the news and a carefully worded letter from Meng Da to Xuande arguing that out of loyalty he is deserting, Xuande is furious.","The news that Peng Yang had been made away frightened his sympathizer and friend, Meng Da, and put him in a quandary. What would he better do on the top of this? Liu Feng's promotion and transfer to Mianzhu arrived, and frightened him still more. So he sought advice from two friends and commanders, the brothers Shen Dan and Shen Yi, who lived in Shangyong. “My friend Peng Yang and I did much for the Prince of Hanzhong. But now Peng Yang is dead, and I am forgotten. More than that, the Prince wishes to put me to death. What can I do?” said Meng Da. Shen Dan replied, “I think I can find a plan that will secure your safety.” “What is it?” asked Meng Da, feeling happier. “Desertion. My brother Shen Yi and I have long desired to go over to Wei. You just write the Prince of Hanzhong a memorial resigning your service and betake yourself to the Prince of Wei, who will certainly employ you in some honorable way. Then we two will follow.” Meng Da saw that this was his best course, so he wrote a memorandum, which he gave to the messenger who had brought the recent dispatches to take back with him. That night Meng Da left his post and went to Wei. The messenger returned to Chengdu, handed in Meng Da's memorial and told the story of his desertion. The Prince was angry. He tore open the letter and read:"

Rui was shocked. Suddenly he played Man Chong and others on the table, saying: ""Sun Quan of the Eastern Wu pretended to be the emperor and made an alliance with Shu. Now Lu Xun is dispatched to train troops in Wuchang, waiting for the call. Only at the end of the day, the bandits will be invaded."" Rui Wen knew that there were two dangers. , Bewildered and panicked. At this time, Cao Zhen had not recovered from his illness, so he summoned Sima Yi to discuss it. Yi said: ""As the ministers foolishly expected, Eastern Wu will not raise troops."" Rui said, ""How did you know about it?"" Yi said, ""Kong Ming has tried to repay Xiaoting, but he does not want to swallow Wu, he is only afraid of it. The Central Plains took advantage of the false attack, so they temporarily formed an alliance with Eastern Wu. Lu Xun also knew what it meant, so he pretended to be a force to respond to it. See you very high, Qing Zhen!"" So he made Yi the commander-in-chief, and he commanded the troops and horses of the various routes in Longxi, and ordered his close ministers to take Cao Zhen's general soldier's seal. Yi said, ""My minister will go and get it."" He then left the emperor and left the court, and went straight to Cao Zhen's mansion. When the illness was over, Yi said: ""Eastern Wu and Xishu have joined together, and the troops have entered the pirates. Now Kongming has left the Qishan Mountain again. Does Duke Ming know about it?"" Zhen was surprised and said, ""My family knew that I was seriously ill, but they didn't let me know. The country is in crisis, so why don't you worship Zhongda as the governor so that you can retreat from the soldiers of Shu?"" Yi said, ""A certain person is not qualified for his position."" Zhen said, ""Take the seal with Zhongda."" Do not worry: I would like to lend a helping hand—I just don’t dare to receive this seal.” Zhen jumped up and said, “If Zhongda doesn’t take this job, China will be in danger! I should see the emperor when I am sick to protect him!” Yi said: “” The Son of Heaven already has a favor, but Yi does not dare to hear it."" Zhen Da was overjoyed and said, ""Zhongda has taken up this position now, and he can retire from the soldiers of Shu."" Seeing that Zhen gave the seal again and again, Yi accepted it, and resigned from the Wei Lord. Lead troops to Chang'an to fight Kong Ming decisively. Exactly:","Emperor Cao Rui is suddenly informed of the fall of Chencang; the death of Hao Zhao; that Kong Ming is through the Qishan hills and that Sun Quan has declared himself emperor. In deep distress he summons Sima Yi to advise him. ‘Don’t worry about the Wu. They are just pretending to invade because they have an alliance with Shu. They know Kong Ming wants to avenge Jieting and seize the south even more than he wants the north. Lu Xun will therefore bide his time and see which of us wins. So we only need worry about Shu.’ Delighted, Cao Rui promotes Sima Yi yet again and gives him the highest level of command, even offering him the imperial seal of authority currently held by Cao Zhen – but Sima replies, saying he would get it himself. So now the scene is set for the great confrontation.","He sent an urgent report to Luoyang. At Wei's next court the Emperor was informed of all the misfortunes in the west and the threats in the east. Man Chong said, “Sun Quan has declared himself 'Emperor,' and Lu Xun is drilling his army in Wuchang. An invasion from the east can be expected soon.” Cao Rui was embarrassed and frightened. Cao Zhen, being ill, could not be consulted, and Sima Yi was called. He was ready with a proposal. “In my humble opinion, Wu will not attack us,” said Sima Yi. “What makes you think so?” asked the Ruler of Wei. “Because Zhuge Liang still resents, and wishes to avenge, the event at Xiaoting. He never ceases to desire to absorb Wu. His only fear is that we may swoop down upon Shu. That is why there is an alliance with Wu. Lu Xun knows it also quite well, and he is only making a show of raising an army as they arranged. The truth is he is sitting on the fence. Hence Your Majesty may disregard the menace on the east, and only protect yourself against Shu.” “Your insight is very profound,” said the Ruler of Wei. Sima Yi was created Commander-in-Chief of all the forces in the west, and the Ruler of Wei directed a courtier to go to Cao Zhen for the seal. “I would rather go myself,” said Sima Yi. So he left the audience and went to the palace of Cao Zhen, where presently he saw the invalid. First he asked after his health and then gradually opened his errand. “Shu and Wu have made an alliance to invade us, and Zhuge Liang is at Qishan. Have you heard, Illustrious Sir?” “My people have kept back all news as I am ill,” said he, startled. “But if this is true, the country is in danger. Why have they not made you Commander-in-Chief to stop this invasion?” “I am unequal to the post,” said Sima Yi. “Bring the seal and give it to him,” said Cao Zhen to his attendants. “You are anxious on my account; really I am only come to lend you an arm. I dare not accept the seal.” Cao Zhen started up, saying, “If you do not take it, I shall have to go to see the Emperor, ill as I am. The Middle Land is in danger.” “Really the Emperor has already shown his kindness, but I dare not accept his offer.” “If you have been appointed, then Shu will be driven off.” Thrice Sima Yi declined the seal, but eventually he received it into his hands as he knew Cao Zhen was sincere. Then he took leave of the Ruler of Wei and marched to Changan. The seal of office changes hands,"

却說趙雲在營中，看看等到午時，不見忠回，急忙披挂上馬，引三千軍向前接應；臨行，謂張翼曰：“汝可堅守營寨。兩壁廂多設弓弩，以為準備。”翼連聲應諾。雲挺鎗驟馬直殺往前去。迎頭一將攔路：乃文聘部將慕容烈也，拍馬舞刀來迎趙雲；被雲手起一鎗刺死。曹兵敗走。雲直殺入重圍，又一枝兵截住；為首乃魏將焦炳。雲喝問曰：“蜀兵何在？”炳曰：“已殺盡矣！”雲大怒，驟馬一鎗，又刺死焦炳。殺散餘兵，直至北山之下，見張郃、徐晃兩人圍住黃忠，軍士被困多時。雲大喊一聲，挺鎗驟馬，殺入重圍；左衝右突，如入無人之境。那鎗渾身上下，若舞梨花；遍體紛紛，如飄瑞雪。張郃、徐晃心驚膽戰，不敢迎敵。雲救出黃忠，且戰且走；所到之處，無人敢阻。操於高處望見，驚問衆將曰：“此將何人也？”有識者告曰：“此乃常山趙子龍也。”操曰：“昔日當陽長坂英雄尚在！”急傳令曰：“所到之處，不許輕敵。”趙雲救了黃忠，殺透重圍，有軍士指曰：“東南上圍的，必是副將張著。”雲不回本寨，遂望東南殺來。所到之處，但見“常山趙雲”四字旗號，曾在當陽長坂知其勇者，互相傳說，盡皆逃竄。雲又救了張著。,"However, he said that Zhao Yun was in the camp, and waited until noon, and did not see the loyal return. He hurriedly put on his horse and led three thousand troops forward to meet him; before leaving, he said to Zhang Yi: ""You can stick to the camp. , I thought I was ready."" Yi repeatedly promised. Yun Ting gun slammed straight ahead. A general blocked the way: Murong Lie, a general of the civil service, came to meet Zhao Yun with a horse and a sword; he was stabbed to death by Yun's hand. Cao Bing was defeated. Yun Zhi smashed into the siege, and was intercepted by another army; in the lead was the Wei general Jiao Bing. Yun Bo asked, ""Where are the soldiers from Shu?"" Bing said, ""All of them have been killed!"" Yun was furious, and shot Jiao Bing to death. After killing the remaining soldiers, they reached the foot of the Beishan Mountain. They saw Zhang He and Xu Huang surrounded Huang Zhong, and the sergeant was trapped for a long time. With a loud shout, Yun threw his guns and horses into the siege; he rushed left and right, as if entering a land of no one. The gun was all over his body, like dancing pear blossoms; all over his body, like floating snow. Zhang He and Xu Huang were frightened and did not dare to meet the enemy. Yun rescued Huang Zhong, fighting and walking; wherever he went, no one dared to stop him. Cao saw it from a high place, and asked the generals in surprise, ""Who is this general?"" Someone in the know said, ""This is Zhao Zilong in Changshan."" ""Wherever you go, don't underestimate the enemy."" Zhao Yun rescued Huang Zhong and defeated the heavy encirclement. A sergeant pointed out: ""The one who goes up to the southeast must be the lieutenant Zhang Zhang."" . Wherever he went, he saw the four-character banner of ""Changshan Zhao Yun"", who once knew his brave man in Changban, Dangyang, and told each other that they all fled. Yun saved Zhang Zha again.","When Huang Zhong does not return, Zhao Zilong sets out to find him, leaving a small garrison behind under the command of Zhang Yi to watch over his camp. Zhao Zilong soon runs into enemy troops, and ferocious battle ensues. Slashing his way through, he at last sees Zhang He and his men surrounding Huang Zhong. So terrifying is his attack that he smashes through the ring of soldiers, scattering them and creating chaos and confusion. So much so that Zhang He retreats, and Zhao Zilong is at last able to rescue Huang Zhong.","Both were in difficulties. Meanwhile, time passed and noon came with no news of Huang Zhong. Wherefore Zhao Yun girded on his armor, took three thousand troops with him and went to his aid. Just as he was leaving, he again warned Zhang Yi to keep good watch. “Guard the camp most carefully; see that you have archers and crossbowmen on both sides.” “Yes, yes,” said Zhang Yi. Zhao Yun rode off, spear in hand, and went out to give battle where he could find the enemy. Soon he fell in with one of Wen Ping's companies led by General Murong Lie. Zhao Yun plunged in, cut Murong Lie down, and disposed of the troops of Wei. Then he came to the real press. A cohort barred his way, led by General Jiao Bing. “Where are the soldiers of Shu?” cried Zhao Yun. “All killed,” cried Jiao Bing. Zhao Yun angrily dashed forward and thrust Jiao Bing through so that he died. The cohort scattered, and Zhao Yun went on to the foot of Northern Mountain, where he found Huang Zhong surrounded. With a yell Zhao Yun dashed at the encircling ring, thrusting this way and shoving that, so that every one shrank and recoiled before him. The mighty spear laid low his opponents as the whirlwind scatters the petals of the wild pear tree till they lie on the bosom of the earth like snowflakes. Panic seized Zhang He and Xu Huang so that they dared not stand in his way, and thus Zhao Yun fought his way through and rescued his fellow warrior. Then they fought their way out and none could withstand them. Cao Cao had been watching the course of the fighting from a high place, and when he saw a doughty warrior forcing his way into the press and all going down before him, he asked of his officers if they knew who the hero was. “That is Zhao Yun of Changshan,” replied one who knew. “So the hero of Dangyang is still alive,” said Cao Cao, marveled. Then Cao Cao gave general orders to his soldiers not to attack Zhao Yun without being sure of success, no matter where they met him. Having rescued his colleague and got clear of the battle, Zhao Yun was told Zhang Zhu hemmed in on a hill not far off. Wherefore Zhao Yun went to his relief before going back to his own camp."

I faintly saw the old man coming to Shan Yi holding a staff, and he described it very differently. Kong Ming invited the old man to enter the temple, and after the ceremony, sat down on the stone. Kong Ming asked, ""My husband's surname is Gao?"" The old man said, ""The old man has heard the name of the prime minister of a great country for a long time, and I am fortunate to see him! People from the barbarian side, many of whom have survived the prime minister, are all grateful."" Kong Ming asked the reason for the spring water. The old man replied: ""The water that the army drinks is the water of the Dumb Spring: if you drink it, you will die in a few days. Besides this spring, there are three other springs: there is a spring in the southeast, and the water is so cold that if people drink it, There is no heating in the throat, and the body is weak and died - the name is Rouquan. There is a spring in the south, if people splash on the body, the hands and feet will be black and die - the name is Black Spring. There is a spring in the southwest, boiling like hot soup, people If you take a bath, the skin and flesh will be stripped off and you will die - the name is Miequan. There are four springs in our place, where the poisonous gas gathers, and there is no medicine to cure. And the miasma is very serious, only Wei, Shen, and You can come and go in three hours; For the rest of the time, the miasma is densely covered, and if you touch it, you will die.""","He finds it is dedicated to one of the two commanders who made his way through the deserted landscape, General Ma Yuan.27 Kong Ming prays for help, and suddenly an old man appears. From him Kong Ming learns about all four of the deadly springs and how to protect his men from their effects.","Having prayed thus, Zhuge Liang left the temple. While seeking some native whom he might question, he saw in the distance, on a hill opposite, an aged man leaning on a staff. He approached, and as he drew nearer, Zhuge Liang noted his extraordinary appearance. When he had reached the temple, Zhuge Liang asked the venerable visitor to walk in. After the salutations, the old man sat on the stones, and Zhuge Liang opened the conversation with the usual questions. The old gentleman replied, “Sir Minister, I know you well by repute, and am happy to meet you. Many of the Mangs owe their lives to you, and all have been deeply impressed by your kindness.” Then Zhuge Liang returned to the matter nearest his heart, the mystery of the spring. The old man told him, “That is the Dumb Spring that your soldiers have drunk, and they will die in a few days. Besides that, there are other three poisonous streams called Spring of Destruction, Black Spring, and Spring of Weak Water. All miasma gathers there in the four streams, and it only vaporizes during the two watch before sunset.”"

Meng You was shocked. Dai asked about the situation, and ordered someone to report to Kongming in the outer compartment. Kong Ming was discussing with Ma Su, Lv Kai, Jiang Wan, Fei Bao, etc. about the common people in the tent, and suddenly someone in the tent reported that Meng Huo sent his younger brother Meng You to come to the treasure. Kong Ming looked back on Ma Su and said, ""Do you know the intention of his coming?"" Su said, ""Don't dare to say it clearly—Rong Mou wrote it secretly on a piece of paper, and presented it to the Prime Minister to see if it matched Jun's intention."" Kong Ming followed it. Ma Su wrote it and presented it to Kongming. When Kong Ming finished reading it, he put his palms together and laughed loudly, saying, ""I've already sent the next person to capture Meng Huo's plan. What you see is exactly the same as mine."" He also whispered to pay; he also called Wang Ping, Ma Zhong, and Guan Suo into, and he also paid closely.","Immediately Meng Huo returns to his own camp he has the two chieftains Dongtuna and Ahuinan murdered. Then he seeks the advice of his brother Meng You as to what to do next. Together they hatch a plan. Shortly afterwards Meng You travels to Kong Ming’s camp carrying tributes of gold, pearls, ivory and other treasures.","Meng You loaded a hundred men with gold and jewels and pearls and ivory and rhinoceros horn, crossed River Lu, and was on his way to the main camp of the Shu army, when he heard the sound of drums and a cohort under Ma Dai poured out to stop him. Meng You did not expect to meet an enemy, and was surprised. But Ma Dai only asked what he had come for. And when he had heard, Meng You was detained while a message was sent to Zhuge Liang. The messenger arrived while a council was in progress, the matter under discussion being how to reduce the Mangs. When the messenger had announced that Meng You had come bearing gifts of gold and pearls and such things, Zhuge Liang turned to Ma Su, saying, “Know you why this man has come?” “I dare not say plainly; but let me write it,” said Ma Su. “Write it, then.” So Ma Su wrote and handed the paper to his chief, who had no sooner read it than he clapped his hands with joy, crying, “What you say is exactly what I think. But you may know I have already made arrangements for the capture of Meng Huo.” Then Zhao Yun was called, and some orders were whispered into his ear. Next Wei Yan came, and he also went off with secret orders. Wang Ping, Ma Zhong, and Guan Suo also came, and left with particular instructions."

Hu laughed and said, ""Does he also know that I can drink?"" Then he ordered to open a pot to get a drink. The commander Chen Yuan said: ""There is fear of treacherousness, so the governor should drink slowly."" Hu smiled and said, ""Those who fight against non-toxic people don't have to worry about it."" He poured the pot and drank it. Naturally, people ask questions and communicate with each other often. One day, the rebels waited for Hu. Hu asked, ""Is General Lu okay?"" The visitor said, ""The commander has been ill for a few days and hasn't come out."" Hu said, ""I think his illness is the same as mine. I have prepared the medicine here, so I can send and take it. ""Come back to see resistance with medicine. The generals said, ""Yanghu is my enemy: this medicine is definitely not a good medicine."" Kang said, ""How could there be an uncle Yangshu? You all have no doubts."" He took it. He recovered the next day, and all the generals congratulated him. Kang said: ""He is devoted to virtue, and I only use violence. That is why he will subdue me without fighting. Now it is better to protect the boundaries of each other, not to seek small profits.""","They exchange gifts of meat and wine; on one occasion, hearing Lu Kang has been ill, Yang Hu sends his own special potion and physician to cure him. When such gifts are exchanged, cautious members of both entourages question whether they might be poisoned, and both men dismiss such thoughts as unworthy of the integrity of the other leader and eat and drink happily.","When the gift of wine arrived and the bearers told Yang Hu the story of their reception, he laughed. “So he knows I can drink,” said Yang Hu. He had the jar opened, and the wine was poured out. One of his generals, Chen Yuan, begged him to drink moderately lest there should be some harm come of it. “Lu Kang is no poisoner,” replied Yang Hu. And he drank. The friendly intercourse thus begun continued, and messengers frequently passed from one camp to the other. One day the messengers said that Lu Kang was unwell and had been ailing for several days. “I think he suffers from the same complaint as I,” said Yang Hu. “I have some remedies ready prepared and will send him some.” The drugs were taken over to the Wu camp. But the sick man's officers were suspicious and said, “This medicine is surely harmful; it comes from the enemy.” Lu Kang cried, “What! Think you that old Uncle Yang Hu would poison a person? Do not doubt.” He drank the decoction. Next day he was much better; and when his staff came to congratulate him, he said, “If our opponents take their stand upon virtue and we take ours upon violence, they will drag us after them without fighting. See to it that the boundaries be well kept and that we seek not to gain any unfair advantage.”"

Fortunately, he was captured today. The ear of things. You have to subdue his heart, and it will be peaceful."" When the generals heard what they said, they were not willing to believe it.","Bewildered by Kong Ming’s actions in letting the king of the Man go, his commanders ask for an explanation. ‘I can catch him whenever I want,’ says Kong Ming, ‘but we’ll only ever win the Man tribes to our side if we capture their hearts, not just their bodies. ’ It cannot be said this pleased the commanders.","The officers did not approve of the release of the King of the Mangs, and they came to the tent of Zhuge Liang and said, “Meng Huo is the most important personage of all the Mangs, and his capture is the key to restoring order in the south. Why then, O Minister, did you release him?” “I can capture him just as easily as I can get something out of my pocket. What I want to do is to overcome and win his heart, so that peace may follow of itself.” They listened, but they had no great confidence in the success of the policy of conciliation."

If the two of you don't win again, you will be beheaded!"" Zhuge was still single-shot, full of energy, and fought back the two. Zhuge Zhan commanded two Ye soldiers to rush out and crashed into Wei's formation, clashing from left to right, killing dozens of times. Shi Zuan and Deng Zhong slandered and fled. Zhanqu Shima then covered up for more than 20 li and set up camp to reject him. Shi Zuan and Deng Zhong went back to meet Deng Ai. Seeing that both of them were injured, Ai did not take responsibility for it, but discussed with the generals: ""Zhuge Zhanshan has the ambition to succeed his father, and he has killed more than 10,000 men and horses twice. Ben said, ""Why don't you write a book to lure him?"" Following his words, Ai wrote a book and sent an envoy to the Shu village. The gatekeeper will lead to the tent and present his book. Look at it unpacked. The book says:","Deeply troubled, Deng Ai seeks to win Zhuge Zhan to his side by sending a flattering letter, but Zhuge Zhan simply tears the paper into pieces and executes the messenger.","Deng Ai, however, said to Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan, “This is the critical stage; and if you lose the next battle, you will certainly lose your lives with it.” At the head of ten thousand troops, they went out to battle once more. This time they met the vanguard led by Zhuge Shang, who rode out alone, boldly offering to repulse the leaders of Wei. At Zhuge Zhan's signal the two wings advanced and threw themselves against the Wei line. The center portion of the Wei line met them, and the battle went to and fro many times, till at length the force of Wei, after great losses, had to give way. Both Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan being badly wounded, they fled and the army of Shu pursued and drove the invaders into their camp. Shi Zuan and Deng Zhong had to acknowledge a new defeat, but, when Deng Ai saw both were severely wounded, he forbore to blame them or decree any penalty. To his officers Deng Ai said, “This Zhuge Zhan well continues the paternal tradition. Twice they have beaten us and slain great numbers. We must defeat them, and that quickly, or we are lost.” Then Military Inspector Qiu Ben said, “Why not persuade their leader with a letter?” Deng Ai agreed and wrote a letter, which he sent by the hand of a messenger. The warden of the Shu camp gate led the messenger in to see Zhuge Zhan, who opened the letter and read: “Deng Ai, General Who Conquers the West, writes to Zhuge Zhan, General of the Guard and Leader of the army in the field. “Now having carefully observed your talent in attack, I see you are not equal to your most honored father. From the moment of his emergence from his retreat, he said that the country was to be in tripod division."

Jiang Xu and Yang Fu led troops out. At the two circles, Yang Fu and Jiang Xu came out in white robes, yelling, ""Treacherous thief!"" How did Jiang Xu and Yang Fu stand up to Ma Chao and left after a big defeat. Ma Chao drove his troops over. Yin Feng and Zhao Ang came after the shouting from behind. In a super urgent return, two pinch attacks are made, and the head and the tail can't care for each other. In the middle of the fight, the army and horses of the Shishali brigade came. It turned out that Xiahou Yuan had been ordered by Cao Cao and was leading the army to defeat Ma Chao. How did Chao become a three-way army horse and run back after a big defeat. After walking all night, compared to Pingming, when he reached the gate of Jicheng, random arrows shot down from the city. Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu stood on the city and scolded Ma Chao; Ma Chao's wife Yang was slashed from the city, and the body was left; Ma Chao's three youngest sons and more than ten close relatives were also slashed from the city. will come down. He choked on his chest and almost fell off his horse. Xiahou Yuan led his troops to pursue him. Chao sees the power and does not dare to fight, so he makes a way with Pang De and Ma Dai Sha. He bumped into Jiang Xu and Yang Fu in front of them and killed them for a while; if they were able to rush past, they bumped into Yin Feng and Zhao Ang and killed them for a while. There were only fifty or sixty horses left, and they ran all night. Before and after the fourth watch, when they walked under the city of Li, the gatekeeper only told Jiang Xubing to return, and opened the door to enter. Chao started from the south gate of the city and washed all the people in the city. Go to Jiang Xu's house and take out the old mother. The mother was not afraid, and cursed at Ma Chao. Extremely angry, he killed him with his own sword. Yin Feng and Zhao Ang's family, young and old, were also killed by Ma Chao. Ang's wife, Mrs. Wang, was saved from trouble because she was in the army. The next day, when Xiahou Yuan's army arrived, Ma Chao abandoned the city and rushed out, looking west to flee. After less than twenty li, an army spread out in front, led by Yang Fu. He gnashed his teeth and hated, and stabbed him with a horse and a spear. The seven Fu brothers came to help the battle together. Ma Dai and Pang De held the enemy back. The seven Fu brothers were all killed by Ma Chao. Fu was shot five times, still fighting to the death. After Xiahou Yuan's army came, Ma Chao left. Only Pang De and Ma Dai rode away after five or seven. Xiahou Yuan appeased the people of the states in Longxi on his own, and ordered Jiang Xu and the others to guard each of them separately. Cao Feng Fu was the Marquis of Guannei. Fu Ci said: ""Fu has no power to defend against hardships, and there is no time to die and hardships, so he should be punished by the law, why should he accept the post?"" Cao Jiazhi, died with him.","Drawing Ma Chao to the attack before the city of Licheng, the plotters spring an ambush on Ma Chao, encouraged by the fact that Cao Cao has sent Xiahou Yuan to support the plot. Ma Chao’s army is cut to pieces. Ma Chao escapes but only just and rides hell for leather back to his city of Jicheng. But as soon as he arrives at the gate he is met by a hail of arrows. Two of the friends of Yang Fu who were pardoned at the same time have seized the city. They then drag his wife to the walls and slay her there before her husband’s eyes, throwing her body down before him. Then his three infant sons are brought up and murdered – followed by more than a dozen other members of his family. Ma Chao’s grief and anger know no bounds, and he almost collapses from his horse. But Xiahou Yuan is fast coming up behind him, so he has to turn and fight his way through with a handful of followers. But he is not done for. Using the cover of darkness, Ma Chao and his men double back and arrive at the gate of Licheng. They fool the guards into thinking they are from the rebel group, and the gate is opened. The bloodshed and revenge that follow are horrific. Not even the eighty-two-year-old matriarch is spared – Ma Chao slays her himself. But there is no long-term safety here, so Ma Chao leaves the sacked city and flees west. En route he is attacked again and again until eventually there are fewer than ten men riding with him. But on and on he rides, until he reaches Zhang Lu in Hanzhong, where he offers his services – which are gladly received. The new recruits give Zhang Lu the confidence to plan to seize Yizhou and to defy Cao Cao. Zhang Lu even contemplates making Ma Chao his son-in-law, but one of his advisers, Yang Bo, strongly resists this, pointing out that Ma Chao’s actions have led to the death of his entire family, so this is not a good augury.","The wife of Zhao Ang sold her ornaments and went in person to her husband's camp to feast his soldiers. The fears of Zhao Ang concerning the fate of his son were only too soon justified. At the first news of the march of an army against him, Ma Chao beheaded the young Zhao Yue. Then Ma Chao marched his force, together with Pang De and Ma Dai, to Licheng, and the troops under Jiang Xu and Yang Fu went out to oppose it. The two leaders on the avenging side went to battle dressed in mourning white. They railed at Ma Chao, crying, “Wicked traitor! Rebel!” Ma Chao angrily dashed across toward them, and the fight began. From the very first it was seen that the defenders of the city could not hope to beat off the attack, and they turned to flee. Ma Chao pursued them. But soon he heard the shouting of soldiers behind him and found the other army led by Zhao Ang and Yin Feng was attacking his rear. Wherefore he was between two armies and had a double battle to fight. As he turned toward that in his rear, Jiang Xu and Yang Fu returned again to the attack. And while engaged with these two, there suddenly appeared a third force under Xiahou Yuan, who had just received orders from Cao Cao to come against Ma Chao. Three attacks at once were too much for Ma Chao, and he fled, his force in utter confusion. He retreated all that night and at dawn reached his own city of Jicheng. He hailed the gate, but a flight of arrows was the response. Soon after, Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu appeared and reviled him from the ramparts above. More than this, they dragged his wife, Lady Yang, up upon the wall, hacked her before his face, and threw the bloody body at his feet. They followed up this by the murder in like manner of his three sons and other members of his family to the number of ten and more. And all their dead bodies were flung from the wall. Rage and despair filled Ma Chao's bosom; he almost fell from his steed. But little time was allowed to grieve, for Xiahou Yuan was nearly upon him. Knowing that he could not oppose this force with any chance of victory, he made no battle line, but set off with two of his generals, Ma Dai and Pang De, to cut his way through such parties of the enemy as they might meet. Their sole object was escape, so when they fell upon Yang Fu and Jiang Xu, they only fought to get through, and in the same way they cut an arterial alley through the army under Yin Feng and Zhao Ang. However, they lost most of their few followers, and at the end had only some sixty horsemen left. About the fourth watch they came to Licheng. In the darkness, the gate guards, thinking only of the return of their own troops, opened the gates and unwittingly let in the enemy. Once in the city Ma Chao and his followers began the slaughter, and every one, soldier or common person, was slain, till the city was swept clear from the south gate to the very center. Presently they came to the residence of Jiang Xu and dragged forth his aged mother. She showed no sign of fear, but reviled Ma Chao till in his anger he slew her with his own sword. Thence they went to the house of Yin Feng and Zhao Ang and slew all they found therein. The only person who escaped the massacre was Lady Wang, wife of Zhao Ang, who had accompanied her husband. But the city proved no place of safety. Xiahou Yuan with his army appeared the following day, and Ma Chao fled before him to the west. But ere he had gone seven miles, he came face to face with another army drawn up in battle array. Yang Fu was the leader. Grinding his teeth with rage, Ma Chao set his spear and rode at Yang Fu, while his two generals, Ma Dai and Pang De, attacked the rear. Yang Fu was overcome, and his seven brothers who had gone with him into the battle were slain. Yang Fu himself was wounded in five places, but still fought on till he was wounded down. However, Xiahou Yuan had not left pursuing Ma Chao. He came up to the city, and Ma Chao fled before him to the west. His army was now reduced to the two generals and about five or six of horsemen, and these few were left to go their way. Cao Cao's general, Xiahou Yuan, set himself to restore order and tranquillity in the region of Xizhou, after which he apportioned its defense among Jiang Xu and other trustworthy commanders. The wounded leader Yang Fu was sent to the capital in a carriage. When he arrived Xuchang, he saw Cao Cao who offered him the title of Lordship. But Yang Fu declined the honor, saying, “I have neither the credit of a successful defense nor the merit of death with my master. Death should be my portion rather than honors. How could I accept the offer?”"

從赤松子遊——張良是劉邦的開國功臣；成功之後，他看到劉邦殺戮功臣，就跟着赤松子“學道”去了。赤松子，傳說是一個神仙。,"From Chisongzi Tour - Zhang Liang was Liu Bang's founding hero; after his success, he saw Liu Bang kill the hero, so he followed Chisongzi to ""learn the Tao"".

孔明以扇指曹眞曰：“吾不逼汝。汝可整頓軍馬，來日決戰。”言訖回車。於是兩軍皆退。曹眞將王朗屍首，用棺木盛貯，送回長安去了。副都督郭淮曰：“諸葛亮料吾軍中治喪，今夜必來劫寨。可分兵四路：兩路兵從山僻小路，乘虛去劫蜀寨；兩路兵伏於本寨外，左右擊之。”曹眞大喜曰：“此計與吾相合。”遂傳令喚曹遵、朱讚兩個先鋒分付曰：“汝二人各引一萬軍，抄出祁山之後。但見蜀兵望吾寨而來，汝可進兵去劫蜀寨。如蜀兵不動，便撤兵回，不可輕進。”二人受計，引兵而去。眞謂淮曰：“我兩個各引一枝軍，伏於寨外，寨中虛堆柴草，只留數人。如蜀兵到，放火為號。”諸將皆分左右，各自準備去了。,"Kong Ming pointed at Cao Zhen with his fan and said, ""I won't force you. You can rectify your troops and fight decisively in the future."" After that, he returned to the carriage. So both armies retreated. Cao Zhen stored Wang Lang's body in a coffin and sent it back to Chang'an. Deputy Governor Guo Huai said: ""Zhuge Liang expects that our army will be in charge of the mourning and will come to rob the village tonight. The troops can be divided into four groups: two groups of soldiers will take advantage of the mountain to take advantage of the virtual road to rob the village of Shu; Let it go."" Cao Zhen was overjoyed and said, ""This plan is compatible with me."" Then he ordered Cao Zun and Zhu Zan to share the two vanguards and said, ""You two will lead ten thousand troops each and copy them out of Qishan. When I come from my village, you can send your troops to rob Shu village. If the troops of Shu do not move, then withdraw your troops and do not enter lightly."" The two accepted the plan and led their troops away. He said to Huai, ""I each lead an army and lie outside the village. Firewood is piled up in the middle of the village, leaving only a few people. If the soldiers of Shu arrive, they will set fire to the number."" .","Then Kong Ming challenges Cao Zhen to battle for the following day. Wang Lang’s body is carried back, and the Wei commanders realize they will be at risk of attack by Kong Ming that night because they will need to perform the mourning rituals for Wang Lang. So they decide to set an ambush to forestall the anticipated midnight raid by attacking the Shu camp. Two troops of men are chosen to make a pincer movement on the camp.","After Wang Lang had fallen, Zhuge Liang waved the fan toward Cao Zhen and said, “As for you, I leave you alone for this occasion. Go and get your army in order for tomorrow's battle.” The chariot turned and left the ground; both armies retired for that day. To Cao Zhen fell the melancholy duty of rendering the last services to the aged counselor and setting his coffin on its journey to Changan. Then said General Guo Huai, “Zhuge Liang will certainly think the army occupied with mourning and make a night attack. Let us anticipate him and set out an ambush about our camp. Let two bodies of our troops be hidden outside and two others take the occasion to raid the camp of the enemy.” “I thought of such a scheme myself,” said Cao Zhen. “It exactly suits my plans.” So Cao Zhen gave order to Cao Zun and Zhu Zan: “You are to take ten thousand troops each, get away by the rear of the mountain, and look out for the passing of the soldiers of Shu. When they have gone by, you are to make for their camp. But you are only to attempt a raid if they have left.” Cao Zun and Zhu Zan took the order and left. Then the Commander-in-Chief arranged with Guo Huai each to lead a force and hide outside the camp to wait for the raid of Shu. Only a few soldiers were to be left within to make a fire if the enemy were seen to be coming. And all generals set about the necessary preparations."

Seeing that the troops in Wei's formation were not in order, the birthday was the big exorcist. Cheng Qi retreated, drove the soldiers to cover up, and saw cattle, horses, donkeys and mules all over the countryside. Suddenly there was a loud bang, and two soldiers came: Shibao on the left and Zhoutai on the right. When the birthday was terrified, and when he was about to retreat, Wang Ji and Chen Qian's elite soldiers attacked him. The birth of the soldier was defeated. Sima Zhao led troops to meet him again. The birthday led the defeated soldiers into Shouchun and held on behind closed doors. Zhaoling troops besieged on all sides and attacked the city.","When Zhuge Dan and his Wu allies attack, the Wu soldiers, who have no real interest in the outcome of the battle, run off to loot the wagons, leaving Zhuge Dan and his men alone and exposed.","That day, Zhuge Dan led the central army, while Zhu Yi and Wen Qin commanded the left and right armies. The armies being drawn up, Zhuge Dan looked across at his opponents and saw that the center of the Wei army was taken up by a disorderly mass of transport. Presently he led on his troops to attack, and Cheng Zu, as bidden to do, gave way and fled, leaving a large amount of spoil. When the soldiers of Wu saw such huge quantities of booty, theirs for the taking, they lost all desire to fight and scattered to gather the spoil. While thus occupied, suddenly a bomb exploded and, from left and right, down came Shi Bao and Zhou Tai and the army of Wei upon the spoilers. Zhuge Dan attempted to draw off, but other forces under Wang Ji and Chen Qian appeared, and he was heavily smitten. Then came on Sima Zhao with his army, and Zhuge Dan fled to Shouchun, where he entered and shut the gates. The army of Wei set down to the siege of the city, and the army of Wu retired into camp at Anfeng."
司馬昭覽畢，深疑鄧艾有自專之心，乃先發手書與衞瓘，隨後降封艾詔曰：,"After Sima Zhao finished his visit, he deeply suspected that Deng Ai had a mind of self-determination.","When news of Jiang Wei’s surrender to Zhong Hui reaches Deng Ai in the capital, he is deeply perturbed by this and immediately writes to Sima Zhao, basically saying that, in order to impress Wu and perhaps encourage their surrender, the second ruler, now simply known as Liu Shan, should be given an estate – Yizhou – and honours and kept in luxury in Shu so that Sun Xiu can see how benevolent the Wei are to those who submit.","Reading this memorial, the thought entered the mind of Sima Zhao that Deng Ai was exaggerating his own importance, wherefore he first wrote a private letter and sent it by the hand of Wei Guan to Deng Ai and then caused the Ruler of Wei to issue an edict promoting Deng Ai. The edict ran thus:"
却說曹叡之后毛氏，乃河內人也；先年叡為平原王時，最相恩愛；及卽帝位，立為后；後叡因寵郭夫人，毛后失寵。郭夫人美而慧，叡甚嬖之，每日取樂，月餘不出宮闥。是歲春三月，芳林園中百花爭放，叡同郭夫人到園中賞玩飲酒。郭夫人曰：“何不請皇后同樂？”叡曰：“若彼在，朕涓滴不能下咽也。”遂傳諭宮娥，不許令毛后知道。毛后見叡月餘不入正宮，是日引十餘宮人，來翠花樓上消遣，只聽的樂聲嘹亮，乃問曰：“何處奏樂？”一宮官啟曰：“乃聖上與郭夫人於御花園中賞花飲酒。”毛后聞之，心中煩惱，回宮安歇。次日，毛后乘小車出宮遊玩，正迎見叡於曲廊之間，乃笑曰：“陛下昨遊北園，其樂不淺也！”叡大怒，卽命擒昨日侍奉諸人到，叱曰：“昨遊北園，朕禁左右不許使毛后知道，何得又宣露！”喝令宮官將諸侍奉人盡斬之。毛后大驚，回車至宮，叡卽降詔賜毛皇后死，立郭夫人為皇后。朝臣莫敢諫者。忽一日，幽州刺史毋丘儉上表，報稱遼東公孫淵造反，自號為燕王，改元紹漢元年，建宮殿，立官職，興兵入寇，搖動北方。叡大驚，卽聚文武官僚，商議起兵退淵之策。正是：,"But it is said that after Cao Rui, the Mao family is also from Hanoi; when Rui was the king of Pingyuan in the previous year, he loved each other the most; when he became the emperor, he was established as the empress; Mrs. Guo is beautiful and smart, and she is very wise. It was the spring of the third month of the year, and a hundred flowers were blooming in the Fanglin Garden. Rui and Mrs. Guo went to the garden to enjoy and drink. Mrs. Guo said, ""Why don't you invite the Empress to have fun?"" Rui said, ""If he is here, I won't be able to swallow the drops."" Then she sent a message to Gong E, not to let Empress Mao know. When Mao Hou saw that Rui Yueyu was not in the main palace, he invited more than ten people from the palace to come to the Cuihua Tower for entertainment. The music was loud and loud, so he asked, ""Where is the music played?"" The first palace official said, ""It is a saint. Shang and Madam Guo are enjoying the flowers and drinking in the imperial garden."" When Mao Hou heard this, he was troubled and returned to the palace to rest. The next day, Empress Mao took a trolley out of the palace to play. Just as she saw Rui in the corridors, she smiled and said, ""Your Majesty visited the North Garden yesterday, and it was a lot of fun!"" Rui was furious, and ordered him to serve everyone yesterday. When he arrived, he shouted: ""Yesterday, when I visited the North Garden, I forbid that I would not allow Empress Mao to know about it. Why should I reveal it again?"" He ordered the palace officials to kill all the servants. Empress Mao was startled and returned to the palace, where Rui You ordered Empress Mao to die and made Mrs. Guo the Empress. Courtiers do not dare to remonstrate. Suddenly one day, the governor of Youzhou, Wu Qiujian, reported that Gongsun Yuan of Liaodong had rebelled, and that he had called himself King of Yan, changed his name to the first year of Shaohan in the Yuan Dynasty, built palaces, established official positions, launched troops to join the bandits, and shaken the north. Rui was shocked, and he gathered the civil and military bureaucrats to discuss the strategy of raising troops and retreating from Yuanyuan. Exactly:","Nor is the domestic life of Cao Rui any better. His first wife, the Empress Mao, is set aside for his latest love, and, when Cao Rui thinks the empress has mocked him, he slays all her staff and then ‘suggests’ that she should commit suicide – which she duly does. Yet, despite such abominable behaviour, no one at court makes a sound. Then news comes of a revolt. Gongsun Yuan, lord of Liaodong, has declared himself king, built a palace and set up a court. The north of the kingdom is in flames.","Now the Consort of the Ruler of Wei was of the Mao family of Henei. In earlier days, when he was a prince, he had loved her exceedingly, and when he succeeded to the throne she became Empress Mao. Later he favored Lady Guo, and his Consort Mao was neglected. Lady Guo was beautiful and clever, and the Ruler of Wei delighted in her. He neglected state affairs for her society and often spent a month at a time in retirement with her. Every day there was some new gaiety. In the spring, when the plants in the Fragrant Forest Park were in flower, the Ruler of Wei and Lady Guo came to the garden to enjoy them and to feast. “Why not invite the Empress?” asked Lady Guo. “If she came, nothing would pass my lips,” replied the Ruler of Wei. He gave orders that his Consort should be kept in ignorance of these rejoicings. But when a month passed without the appearance of the Emperor, Empress Mao and her ladies went to the Blue Flower Pavilion to entertain themselves. Hearing music, she asked who was providing it, and they told her that the Emperor and Lady Guo were feasting in the grounds. That day Empress Mao returned to her palace filled with rage. Next day she went out in her carriage and saw the Emperor on a verandah. “Yesterday Your Majesty was walking in the north garden, and you had plenty of music too,” said she, laughing. Cao Rui was wroth and sent for all the attendants. He upbraided them with disobedience, saying, “I had forbidden you to tell things to the Empress, and you disobeyed my command.” With this he put them all to death. Empress Mao feared and returned to her palace. Then an edict appeared forcing Empress Mao to commit suicide and raising Lady Guo to be Empress in her place. And no officer dared to utter a remonstrance. Just after this the Imperial Protector of Youzhou, Guanqiu Jian, sent in a memorial saying that Gongsun Yuan of Liaodong had risen in revolt, had assumed the style of Prince of Yan (an ancient state), and adopted a reign title of Extending Han. Gongsun Yuan had built himself a palace, established an administration of his own, and was disturbing the whole north with plundering. A council met to consider this memorial."
却說張任失了二將，心中憂慮。吳懿、劉璝曰：“兵勢甚危，不決一死戰，如何得兵退？一面差人去成都見主公告急，一面用計敵之。”張任曰：“吾來日領一軍搦戰，詐敗，引轉城北；城內再以一軍衝出，截斷其中；可獲勝也。”吳懿曰：“劉將軍相輔公子守城，我引兵衝出助戰。”約會已定。次日，張任引數千人馬，搖旗吶喊，出城搦戰。張飛上馬出迎，更不打話，與張任交鋒。戰不十餘合，張任詐敗，遶城而走。張飛盡力追之。吳懿一軍截住，張任引軍復回，把張飛圍在垓心，進退不得。正沒奈何，只見一隊軍從江邊殺出。當先一員大將，挺鎗躍馬，與吳懿交鋒；只一合，生擒吳懿，戰退敵軍，救出張飛。視之：乃趙雲也。飛問：“軍師何在？”雲曰：“軍師已至。想此時已與主公相見了也。”二人擒吳懿回寨。張任自退入東門去了。,"But he said that Zhang Ren lost his second general, and he was worried. Wu Yi and Liu Jing said: ""The army is very dangerous. If we don't decide to fight to the death, how can we get the army to retreat? While sending people to Chengdu to see the urgency of the Lord's announcement, at the same time using the enemy's plan."" Zhang Ren said: ""I will lead an army to fight in Japan. If you are defeated by fraud, lead them to the north of the city; if you are in the city, you will break out with an army and cut them off; you can win."" Wu Yi said: ""General Liu will assist the young master to defend the city, and I will lead the troops out to help the battle."" The appointment has been set. The next day, Zhang Ren led thousands of troops, waving flags and shouting, and went out of the city to fight. Zhang Fei went out to greet him, let alone talk, and confronted Zhang Ren. After more than ten battles, Zhang Ren was deceived and went around the city. Zhang Fei tried his best to chase him. Wu Yi's army intercepted, Zhang Ren led the army back, and surrounded Zhang Fei in Gaixin, unable to advance or retreat. There was nothing to do, but a group of troops rushed out from the river. One of the leading generals, armed with spears and horses, confronted Wu Yi; only one united, captured Wu Yi alive, fought back the enemy, and rescued Zhang Fei. Look at it: it is Zhao Yun. Fei asked: ""Where is the military advisor?"" Yun said: ""The military advisor has arrived. I think I have already met the lord at this time."" The two captured Wu Yi and returned to the village. Zhang Ren retreated to the east gate.","But not long after Yan Yan arrives with the bulk of the army, and, seeing this, Zhang Ren turns and flees, with Zhang Fei in hot pursuit right up to the city wall.","The loss of his two generals grieved Zhang Ren sorely. He called his remaining two and asked advice. They proposed to risk all in one desperate battle while they sent to Chengdu to tell their master of their sorry plight. Zhang Ren agreed. Said he, “Tomorrow I will go and challenge them. If they accept and come out to fight, I will feign retreat and inveigle them round to the north side of the city. As they follow me, a sortie must be made when they pass the gate so as to cut their army in two. We ought to overcome them in this way.” “Let me lead the sortie,” said Wu Yi. “General Liu Gui can stay to help our lord's son Liu Xun guard the city.” This also was agreed to. Next morning Zhang Ren went out to offer the challenge, his troops waving flags and shouting lustily. At once Zhang Fei took up the challenge and rode out. He stayed not to parley, but galloped up to Zhang Ren and engaged him. After about ten bouts Zhang Ren seemed to be getting worsted, so he turned and fled, taking the way around the north of the city. Zhang Fei pursued him with all speed. Then as he passed the gate, Wu Yi made a sortie so that Zhang Fei was between two forces and unable to get clear. Zhang Ren turned back to attack. Zhang Fei seemed in a parlous state. But at this very moment a body of soldiers came up from the river-side and a fierce warrior rode straight for Wu Yi, and in the first bout made him prisoner; his troops were then forced back, and Zhang Fei was free. It was Zhao Yun who had so opportunely appeared. “Where is the Directing Instructor?” asked Zhang Fei. “He has arrived; I think he has already seen our lord,” replied Zhao Yun. The prisoner was carried to the camp where Zhuge Liang was. Zhang Fei dismounted and went in to greet him."
却說司馬懿在城中，令次子司馬昭去探前路：若街亭有兵守禦，卽當按兵不行。司馬昭奉令探了一遍，回見父曰：“街亭有兵守把。”懿歎曰：“諸葛亮眞乃神人，吾不如也！”昭笑曰：“父親何故自墮志氣耶——男料街亭易取。”懿問曰：“汝安敢出此大言？”昭曰：“男親自哨見，當道並無寨柵，軍皆屯於山上：故知可破也。”懿大喜曰：“若兵果在山上，乃天使吾成功矣！”遂更換衣服，引百餘騎親自來看。是夜天晴月朗，直至山下，周圍巡哨了一遍，方回。馬謖在山上見之，大笑曰：“彼若有命，不來圍山。”傳令與諸將：“倘兵來，只見山頂上紅旗招動，卽四面皆下。”,"But he said that Sima Yi was in the city, and he ordered his second son, Sima Zhao, to explore the road ahead: If there are soldiers guarding the street pavilion, you should not be able to do so. Sima Zhao was ordered to check it out, and when he saw his father, he said, ""There are soldiers guarding the pavilion."" Yi sighed and said, ""Zhuge Liang is really a god. Men’s materials are easy to take.” Yi asked, “Do you dare to make such a big statement?” Zhao said, “The man saw it personally, there is no stronghold on the road, and the troops are all stationed on the mountain: so I know it can be broken.” Yi He was overjoyed and said, ""If the soldiers are on the mountain, then the angel will succeed!"" Then he changed his clothes and invited more than a hundred cavalry to see it in person. It was a clear night and the moon was bright until the foot of the mountain. When Ma Su saw him on the mountain, he laughed and said, ""If he has an order, he will not come to surround the mountain."" He sent the order to the generals: ""If the soldiers come, I will see the red flag waving on the top of the mountain, and the swastika will go down from all sides.""","Sima Yi moves forward to the attack, especially because he is encouraged when he is told that the inexperienced Ma Su is in charge.","Before Sima Yi marched, he sent his younger son to reconnoiter the road and to find out whether Jieting had a garrison. Sima Zhao had returned with the information that there was a garrison. “Zhuge Liang is rather more than human,” said his father regretfully when Sima Zhao gave in his report. “He is too much for me.” “Why are you despondent, Father? I think Jieting is not so difficult to take.” “How dare you utter such bold words?” “Because I have seen. There is no camp on the road, but the enemy are camped on the hill.” This was glad news. “If they are on the hill, then Heaven means a victory for me,” said his father. At night Sima Yi changed into another dress, took a small escort, and rode out to see for himself. The moon shone brilliantly, and he rode to the hill whereon was the camp and looked all round it, thoroughly reconnoitering the neighborhood. Ma Su saw him, but only laughed. “If Sima Yi has any luck, he will not try to surround this hill,” said he. Ma Su issued an order to his generals: “In case the enemy come, you are to look to the summit for a signal with a red flag, when you shall rush down on all sides.”"
却說劉循逃回見父，說雒城已陷，劉璋慌聚衆官商議。從事鄭度獻策曰：“今劉備雖攻城奪地，然兵不甚多，士衆未附，野穀是資，軍無輜重。不如盡驅巴西梓潼民，過涪水以西。其倉廩野穀，盡皆燒除，深溝高壘，靜以待之。彼至請戰，勿許。久無所資，不過百日，彼兵自走。我乘虛擊之，備可擒也。”劉璋曰：“不然：吾聞拒敵以安民，未聞動民以備敵也。此言非保全之計。”正議間，人報法正有書至。劉璋喚入。呈上書。璋拆開視之。其略曰：,"But he said that Liu Xun fled back to see his father, that Luocheng had fallen, and Liu Zhang panicked and gathered the officials to discuss. Engaged in Zheng Du's offer of policy, he said: ""Although Liu Bei has attacked the city and seized the land, there are not many troops, and the soldiers are not attached. All the valleys are burnt down, deep trenches and high fortifications, and wait for them quietly. When they come to ask for battle, do not allow them. After a long time without resources, but only a hundred days, the soldiers will go away on their own. ""Otherwise: I have heard that the enemy is to be repressed in order to secure the people, but I have never heard of moving the people to prepare for the enemy. This statement is not a plan to protect the people."" During the discussion, there was a book to report to the law. Liu Zhang called in. Submit the book. Zhang disassembled it. It briefly says:","As he consults with his father, a letter arrives from Fa Zheng, who has suggested to Xuande that he try to persuade Liu Zhang to submit.","Liu Xun, son of the Imperial Protector, presently reached Chengdu and told his father of the loss of Luocheng. The Imperial Protector at once called his counselors together, and Adviser Zheng Du said, “Although Liu Bei has been successful and captured cities and towns, yet his army is but small, his hosts are not near him, and he depends upon chance for his grain and has no proper supplies. Therefore our best plan is to remove the people of Baxi and Zitong to the farther side of River Fu, burn all the granaries, fortify the city, and let starvation defeat him. Let us reject all challenges to battle, and in a hundred days his troops will go off of their own accord. Then we can do with him as we will.” “I like not the plan,” said Liu Zhang. “Oppose invaders in order that tranquillity may prevail is a well-worn maxim, but till now I have never heard of disturbing the people in order to oppose the march of an enemy. Your words are not such as safety.” Just at the moment the letter from Fa Zheng arrived. It was opened and the Imperial Protector read: “I was sent to Jingzhou to negotiate an alliance, but the opposition of those about you to their lord has resulted in the present situation."
伏念漢室不幸，操賊專權，欺君罔上，黎民凋殘。備昔與令先君同受密詔，誓誅此賊。今令先君被操所害，此將軍不共天地、不同日月之讎也。若能率西涼之兵，以攻操之右，備當舉荊襄之衆，以遏操之前：則逆操可擒，姦黨可滅，讎辱可報，漢室可興矣。書不盡言，立待回音。,"Fu Nian was unfortunate in the Han Dynasty, and he used the thief to monopolize the power, deceived the king, and the people of Li were withered. Bixi and Ling Xianjun received a secret edict, swearing to execute the thief. Today, the first emperor was killed by Cao, and this general does not share the sky and the earth, and the sun and the moon are different. If you can lead the troops of Xiliang to attack Cao's right, and prepare to mobilize the crowd in Jingxiang to stop Cao in front: then the rebels can be captured, the traitorous party can be destroyed, the humiliation can be reported, and the Han Dynasty can be prospered. The book is not exhaustive, waiting to hear back.","When news reaches Ma Chao of the death of his father and brothers, he vows revenge, and at just that moment Xuande’s message reaches him.","injury of the Emperor and the wretchedness of the people, I, Liu Bei, recall that I and your father were recipients of an edict and we swore to exterminate the recreant. Now your father has suffered death at the hands of the tyrant, and you must avenge him. As the holy books say, you cannot let the same sky cover you nor the same sunshine upon you and your father's murderer. If you can lead your army to attack Cao Cao on one side, I will march my armies to prevent his retreat, and he will be taken, and all his evil crew can be exterminated. Then and thus will your father be avenged and the Hans can be restored. I might add more, but I will await your reply.”"
却說張郃已死，隨後魏兵追到，見塞了道路，已知張郃中計。衆軍勒回馬急退。忽聽的山頭上大叫曰：“諸葛丞相在此！”衆軍仰視，只見孔明立於火光之中，指衆軍而言曰：“吾今日圍獵，欲射一‘馬’，誤中一‘獐’。汝各人安心而去；上覆仲達，早晚必為吾所擒矣。”魏兵回見司馬懿，細告前事。懿悲傷不已，仰天歎曰：“張雋義身死，吾之過也！”乃收兵回洛陽。魏主聞張郃死，揮淚歎息，令人收其屍，厚葬之。,"However, Zhang He was said to be dead, and the Wei soldiers chased after him. Seeing that the road was blocked, it was known that Zhang He had a plan. The troops pulled back their horses and quickly retreated. Suddenly there was a loud cry from the top of the mountain: ""Prime Minister Zhuge is here!"" The army looked up and saw Kong Ming standing in the firelight, referring to the army and saying, ""I was hunting today, and I wanted to shoot a 'horse', but I missed one. 'Deer'. All of you go away in peace; I will capture Zhongda sooner or later."" Wei Bing returned to see Sima Yi and told him about the past. Yi was deeply saddened, looked up to the sky and sighed, ""Zhang Junyi's death is my fault!"" Then he withdrew his troops and returned to Luoyang. When Lord Wei heard Zhang He's death, he wept and sighed, and ordered his body to be collected and buried.","There, late that night, Zhang He and all his men fall to the Shu assault. This death and Sima Yi’s failure to prevent this foolhardy expedition so depress Sima Yi that he retreats back to Luoyang to lick his wounds. Kong Ming returns to Hanzhong and once again becomes the victim of vicious rumours claiming that he is hoarding supplies ready for a rebellion.","Soon the second army of Wei under Wei Ping came up, but too late to help. From the signs they knew that their comrades had been victims of a cruel trick, and they turned back. But as they faced about, a shout was heard, and from the hilltops came, “I, Zhuge Liang, am here!” Looking up they saw his figure outlined against a fire. Pointing to the slain, he cried, “I have gone hunting in this wood, as you see; only instead of slaying a horse, I have killed a deer. But you may go in peace, and when you see your general, tell him that he will be my quarry one day.” The soldiers told this to Sima Yi when they returned, and he was deeply mortified, saying, “Letting friend Zhang He die is my fault!” And when he returned to Luoyang, the Ruler of Wei wept at the death of his brave leader and had his body searched and honorably buried."

二將領命去了。初更時分，東南風驟起。只見御營左屯火發。方欲救時，御營右屯又火起。風緊火急，樹木皆着。喊聲大震。兩屯軍馬齊出，奔離御營中。御營軍自相踐踏，死者不知其數。後面吳兵殺到，又不知多少軍馬。先主急上馬，奔馮習營時，習營中火光連天而起。江南、江北，照耀如同白日。馮習慌上馬引數十騎而走，正逢吳將徐盛軍到，敵住廝殺。先主見了，撥馬投西便走。徐盛捨了馮習，引兵追來。先主正慌，前面又一軍攔住，乃是吳將丁奉。兩下夾攻。先主大驚。四面無路。忽然喊聲大震，一彪軍殺入重圍，乃是張苞，救了先主，引御林軍奔走。正行之間，前面一軍又到，乃蜀將傅彤也，合兵一處而行。背後吳兵追至。先主前到一山，名馬鞍山。張苞、傅彤請先主上的山時，山下喊聲又起：陸遜大隊人馬，將馬鞍山圍住。張苞、傅彤死據山口。先主遙望遍野火光不絕，死屍重疊，塞江而下。,"The second general was ordered to go. At the beginning of the watch, the southeast wind suddenly picked up. I saw Yuying Zuotun fire. When Fang wanted to save him, Yuying's right village caught fire again. The wind was blowing and the trees were burning. Shouting loudly. The two soldiers and horses came out at the same time and ran away from the imperial camp. The imperial battalions trampled on each other, and the number of dead was unknown. The Wu soldiers were killed later, but I don't know how many troops there were. When the First Sovereign hurriedly mounted his horse and rushed to Feng's camp, the camp was filled with fire. Jiangnan and Jiangbei shine like the sun. Feng Xi got on his horse in a panic and led dozens of cavalry away, just as Wu general Xu Sheng's army arrived, and the enemy was fighting. The first master has seen it, and he will leave. Xu Sheng abandoned Feng Xi and led troops to pursue him. The First Sovereign was panicking, but another army in front stopped him, but it was Wu general Ding Feng. Double attack. The First Lord was astonished. There is no way around. Suddenly there was a loud shout, and a Biao army rushed into the siege, but it was Zhang Bao, who saved the First Sovereign and led the Imperial Forest Army to run. In the middle of the march, the army in front arrived again, and it was the general of Shu Fu Tong, who joined forces and marched in one place. Wu Bing chased after him. The First Lord came to a mountain called Ma'an Mountain. When Zhang Bao and Fu Tong invited the First Lord to go up the mountain, there was another shout from the foot of the mountain: Lu Xun's brigade surrounded Ma'an Mountain. Zhang Bao and Fu Tong died in Yamaguchi. The First Sovereign watched from afar, the flames were endless, the corpses overlapped, and they descended from the river.","Back at the first ruler’s camp, he is confident that the enemy cannot prevail but he is persuaded to issue orders to Zhang Bao and Guan Xing to go and see if there is any movement by the enemy. But before they can report back, fires break out in the camps either side of the first ruler. Suddenly troops of Wu soldiers are rushing up the hill, and chaos erupts. The first ruler leaps on his horse and dashes towards the safety of his commander Feng Xi. But the fires have already driven him away, and he is now trying to attack Xu Sheng and to stem the ferocious attack. However, Xu Sheng charges straight past Feng Xi and heads for the first ruler. He tries to escape but runs headlong into Ding Feng attacking from behind, and the first ruler is trapped. At the last moment a great cry goes up, and Zhang Bao breaks through, seizes the first ruler’s horse and dashes off with the Royal Guard alongside to protect them. They take refuge on Ma An hill, while down below the hill is surrounded by the victorious southern troops. Looking out at nightfall, the first ruler sees nothing but destruction and the bodies of the slain men of his army. The next morning the troops set fire to the hill, and the first ruler is only rescued by the courage of Guan Xing, who with a few others charges up the hill to join Zhang Bao and lead the first ruler away towards the safety of Baidi.","And they started. About the middle of the first watch the wind got up and blew strong from the east. Then fire arose from the camp on the left of the First Ruler's own. He was starting to extinguish this flame when another fire began in the camp on his right. With the aid of the strong breeze both fires became fierce, and soon the trees caught. A confused roar showed the gathering strength of the fire. The soldiers of the burning camps were rushing into the First Ruler's own camp to escape the fire, and in their confusion they trampled on each other, so that many died. Behind them came the troops of Wu bent on slaughter. Ignorant of how many they might be, the First Ruler mounted and dashed for Feng Xi's camp, but that also was in flames, which seemed to rise to the very sky. By this time flames were rising from both sides of the river, so that everything was as visible as by day. Feng Xi leaped to his horse and fled, followed by a few of his mounted troops. This small force ran against the soldiers of Wu under Xu Sheng. A melee ensued, thereupon the First Ruler turned and galloped west. Xu Sheng then left Feng Xi and went in pursuit. Presently the Emperor saw a party of soldiers in the way and became greatly alarmed. This was Ding Feng's army, and the First Ruler was between two foes. In his terror he saw no possibility of safety, no road was open. Just at this moment another cohort broke through to his side and rescued him. The leader was Zhang Bao, and he led the Imperial Guards, who fled, taking the First Ruler with them. As they marched along, they fell in with another force of Shu; the leader was Fu Tong, and he joined up with them. The Wu army was still following when the fugitives reached Saddle Hill. The two leaders, Zhang Bao and Fu Tong, were urging their lord to go to the top of this out of immediate danger. Soon Lu Xun arrived with his army and began to surround the hill. Zhang Bao and Fu Tong held the road up the hill and kept the enemy from ascending. From the summit could be seen flames all around, and the First Ruler witnessed the corpses of his soldiers lay about in heaps or floated in the streams."
却說吳主孫休，聞司馬炎已篡魏，知其必將伐吳，憂慮成疾，臥牀不起，乃召丞相濮陽興入宮中，令太子孫（上雨下單）出拜。吳主把興臂、手指（上雨下單）而卒。興出，與羣臣商議，欲立太子孫（上雨下單）為君。左典軍萬彧曰：“（上雨下單）幼不能專政，不若取烏程侯孫皓立之。”左將軍張布亦曰：“皓才識明斷，堪為帝王。”丞相濮陽興不能決，入奏朱太后。太后曰：“吾寡婦人耳，安知社稷之事？卿等斟酌立之，可也。”興遂迎皓為君。,"However, Sun Xiu, the master of Wu, heard that Sima Yan had usurped Wei, and knew that he was going to attack Wu. He became ill with anxiety, and was bedridden, so he summoned the prime minister Pu Yangxing into the palace, and ordered the princes and grandsons to worship. Lord Wu threw up his arms and fingers (in the rain and placed orders) and died. Xing came out, discussed with the ministers, and wanted to establish the prince's descendant (the rain and the order) as the king. Zuo Dian's army Wan Yu said: ""You can't be a dictator when you are young, so it is better to take Sun Hao, the Marquis of Wucheng, to establish him."" , to play Empress Dowager Zhu. The queen mother said: ""My widow, do you know the affairs of the Sheji and Ji? The ministers and others will consider and establish it."" Xing then welcomed Hao as the king.","News of the overthrow of the Wei emperor by Sima Yan profoundly shocks the king of Wu, Sun Xiu, for he knows that his kingdom is now seriously under threat. This so troubles him that he becomes ill and has to take to his bed. Summoning Prime Minister Puyang Xing, and now unable to speak, he points at his heir, Sun Wan, and indicates that they should both assist each other. Having done this, he dies. When Puyang Xing announces the late emperor’s choice, disputes break out.","Let us confer the throne to Sun Hao, Lord of Wucheng.” Zhang Bu, General of the Left Army, supported his election, saying, “Sun Hao is able and prompt in decision. He can handle the responsibilities of an emperor.” However, Puyang Xing was doubtful and consulted the Empress Dowager. “Settle this with the officials;” she replied, “I am a widow and know nothing of such matters.” Finally Sun Hao won the day, and in the seventh month he was enthroned as Emperor of Wu, and the first year of his reign was Prosperous Beginning (AD 264)."

時公正將息箭瘡，按兵不動。忽報：“江東陸口守將呂蒙病危，孫權取回調理，近拜陸遜為將，代呂蒙守陸口。今遜差人齎書具禮，特來拜見。”關公召入，指來使而言曰：“仲謀見識短淺，用此孺子為將！”來使伏地告曰：“陸將軍呈書備禮，一來與君侯作賀，二來求兩家和好，幸乞笑留。”公拆書視之，書詞極其卑謹。關公覽畢，仰面大笑，令左右收了禮物，發付使者回去。使者回見陸遜曰：“關公欣喜，無復有憂江東之意。”,"At that time, justice will suffocate the arrow sores, and will not move. He suddenly reported: ""Jiangdong Lukou guard Lv Meng is critically ill. Sun Quan has called him back to handle the situation. He will serve Lu Xun as a general and will guard Lukou on his behalf. Now Xun has sent someone to give a book and a gift, and I'm here to pay you a visit."" Qi said: ""Zhongmou has little knowledge, so he used this child as a general!"" The envoy prostrated and said, ""General Lu has presented a letter and prepared a ceremony, firstly to congratulate the prince and lord, and secondly to ask for reconciliation between the two families, fortunately begging to stay. ""The public demolition of the book regards it, and the words of the book are extremely humble. After Guan Gong finished reading, he laughed on his back, and ordered the left and right to accept the gifts and sent them back to the messengers. The envoy returned to Lu Xun and said, ""Guan Gong is delighted, and there is no more worry about Jiangdong.""","Sun formally summons Lü Meng back to the court ‘for health reasons’ and appoints Lu Xun to be the flattering flunkey who will fool Guan Yu. Arriving in Lukou, Lu Xun writes a fulsome letter of praise to Guan Yu and despatches it with a surfeit of expensive gifts. When the letter and gifts are delivered to Guan Yu, he seems truly delighted, and this is duly reported back to a very pleased Lu Xun.","When he had assumed charge of the cavalry, the infantry, and the marines, he set about drawing up a letter to Guan Yu, and he selected fine horses and beautiful silks and good wines and delicacies suitable for gifts to go with the letter. He sent all by the hand of a trusty messenger to Fankou. The news of the change of command reached Guan Yu when he lay ill from the effects of his wound and unable to conduct any military operations. Close upon the news came the letter and the gifts from Lu Xun, and the bearer was called in to see the warrior. “Friend Sun Quan was not very prudent when he made a general out of a mere scholar,” said Guan Yu, pointing to the messenger. The messenger said, “General Lu Xun sends this letter and some presents, which he hopes you will accept. He also sends his felicitations, and would rejoice if the two houses could become friends.” Guan Yu read the letter, which was couched in most modest language, and then threw back his head and laughed loud. He bade the attendants receive the various gifts, and sent the bearer away. The messenger forthwith returned to Lukou and said the old warrior had seemed very gratified and would henceforward feel no anxiety that danger might threaten from their direction."
第五十八回　馬孟起興兵雪恨,Chapter fifty-eighth,CHAPTER 58,CHAPTER 58.
却說葭萌關守將孟達、霍峻知張郃兵來。霍峻只要堅守。孟達定要迎敵，引軍下關與張郃交鋒，大敗而回。霍峻急申文書到成都。玄德聞知，請軍師商議。孔明聚衆將於堂上，問曰：“今葭萌關緊急，必須閬中取翼德，方可退張郃也。”法正曰：“今翼德兵屯瓦口，鎮守閬中，亦是緊要之地，不可取回。帳中諸將內選一人去破張郃。”孔明笑曰：“張郃乃魏之名將，非等閒可及。除非翼德，無人可當。”忽一人厲聲而出曰：“軍師何輕視衆人耶？吾雖不才，願斬張郃首級，獻於麾下。”衆視之，乃老將黃忠也。孔明曰：“漢升雖勇，爭奈年老，恐非張郃對手。”忠聽了，白鬚倒豎而言曰：“某雖老，兩臂尚開三石之弓，渾身還有千斤之力；豈不足敵張郃匹夫耶？”孔明曰：“將軍年近七十，如何不老？”忠趨步下堂，取架上大刀，輪動如飛；壁上硬弓，連拽折兩張。孔明曰：“將軍要去，誰為副將？”忠曰：“老將嚴顏，可同我去。但有疎虞，先納下這白頭。”玄德大喜，卽時令嚴顏、黃忠去與張郃交戰。趙雲諫曰：“今張郃親犯葭萌關，軍師休為兒戲。若葭萌一失，益州危矣。何故以二老將當此大敵乎？”孔明曰：“汝以二人老邁，不能成事，吾料漢中必於此二人手內可得。”趙雲等各各晒笑而退。,"However, Jiameng's gatekeepers Meng Da and Huo Jun knew that Zhang He was coming. Huo Jun just needs to stick to it. Meng Da was determined to meet the enemy and led his troops to Xiaguan to confront Zhang He, but he was defeated and returned. Huo Jun hurried to apply for the document to Chengdu. Xuande heard about it and asked the military advisor to discuss it. Kong Ming gathered the congregation in the hall and asked: ""Jiameng Pass is urgent now, we must take Yide from Langzhong before we can retreat to Zhang He."" Fazheng said: ""Now Yide troops are stationed at Wakou and guard Langzhong, it is also very important. The land cannot be taken back. The generals in the tent choose one person to destroy Zhang He."" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""Zhang He is a famous general of Wei, and he cannot be easily reached. Unless Yi De, no one can do it."" ""Why do military advisors despise everyone? Although I am not talented, I would like to cut off Zhang He's head and dedicate it to his subordinates."" Everyone looked at it, and it was veteran Huang Zhongye. Kong Ming said: ""Although Han Sheng is brave, he is old when he is fighting for Nai, so he may not be Zhang He's opponent."" Zhong listened, and his white beard stood upright and said, ""Though he is old, his arms still have three-stone bows, and he still has a thousand pounds all over his body. Strength; is it not enough for the enemy Zhang He?"" Kong Ming said, ""The general is nearly seventy years old, how can he not grow old?"" Kong Ming said: ""The general is going, who will be the lieutenant?"" Zhong said: ""The veteran general Yan Yan, you can go with me. But if there is Yu Yu, please accept this white head first."" Xuande was overjoyed, and ordered Yan Yan and Huang in season. Zhong went to fight Zhang He. Zhao Yun admonished: ""Now Zhang He has committed a personal attack on Jiameng Pass, and the military advisors will be dismissed as a child's play. If Jiameng is lost, Yizhou will be in danger. Why do you have two veteran generals as this great enemy?"" Kong Ming said: ""You think that the two are old and cannot be When things are done, I expect Hanzhong to be within the hands of these two people."" Zhao Yun and the others all laughed and retreated.","‘We need Zhang Fei to go straight to Jiameng pass and confront Zhang He,’ says Kong Ming. ‘But he is vital for the defence of Wakou pass,’ says another of the advisers. ‘Let’s be frank, Zhang He is the most fierce of opponents, and only Zhang Fei can bring him down,’ says Kong Ming. But just as it seems this has been agreed, up pipes Huang Zhong. ‘Send me, and I will bring you Zhang He ’s head,’ he says. ‘I don’t doubt your courage,’ says Kong Ming, ‘but aren’t you too old at seventy to do this?’ Outraged by this, Huang Zhong grabs a sword hanging on the wall and swiftly shows his skill as a swordsman. He then takes down mighty bows from the wall and draws them until they snap in two. Kong Ming agrees to his going but only if he has a lieutenant to assist, whereupon Huang Zhong chooses the equally elderly but determined Yan Yan. ‘If I fail, then you can strike this white-haired old head from my shoulders,’ cries Huang Zhong. The other officers, led by Zhao Zilong, round on Kong Ming. ‘Why are you doing this? What childish game is this?’ asks Zhao Zilong. ‘ Zhang He is our most determined foe, and you send two elderly generals to fight him?’ ‘Do you know,’ says Kong Ming, ‘I am confident that it will be those “two elderly generals” who will capture Hanzhong for us!’ At this Zhao Zilong and the other generals smile knowingly and leave.","Meng Da desiring to go out to meet Zhang He, but Huo Jun being in favor of defense. Meng Da being set on having his way went out, gave battle, and was defeated. Huo Jun reported this to the capital, where Liu Bei at once called in the Directing Instructor to ask advice. Zhuge Liang assembled all the chief generals into the hall. “Jiameng Pass is in danger; we must get Zhang Fei from Langzhong to drive off Zhang He,” said Zhuge Liang. Fa Zheng replied, “Zhang Fei is encamped at Wakou Pass, and Langzhong is no less important than Jiameng Pass. I do not think he should be recalled. Choose one among the generals to go and defeat Zhang He.” Zhuge Liang laughed, “ Zhang He is renowned in Wei; no ordinary leader will avail. Zhang Fei is the only man to send, the only one equal to the task.” Then among the generals one started up crying angrily, “Instructor, why do you thus despise us? I will use what little skill I have in slaying our enemy and will lay his head at the foot of our standard.” The speaker was Veteran General Huang Zhong, and all eyes centered on him. “Friend Huang Zhong, you are bold enough, but what about your age? I fear you are no match for Zhang He.” Huang Zhong's white beard bristled, and he said, “I know I am old. But these two arms can still pull the four-hundred-fifty-pound bow, and the vigor of my body is not yet departed. Am I not strong enough to meet such a poor thing as Zhang He?” “General, you are nearly seventy; can you still hold you are not aged?” Huang Zhong tore down the hall. Seizing one of the great swords off the rack, he whirled it as if it flew. And the stiffest bow that hung on the wall, he pulled till it snapped. “Well, if you will go, who will second you?” said Zhuge Liang. “I would prefer Veteran General Yan Yan. And if there is the least anxiety, well, here is this hoary head.” Liu Bei was pleased to let these two go to fight Zhang He. However, Zhao Yun put in a protest. “Zhang He has already got through Jiameng Pass, so that the fighting will be no child's play, and the loss of that Pass endangers the whole of Yiazhou. It is no task to set to a couple of old men.” Replied Zhuge Liang, “You regard the two as too old and stupid to succeed, but I think the attainment of Hanzhong depends upon these two.” Zhao Yun and many others sniggered as they went from the hall; they did not agree with Zhuge Liang."

次日，覺氣沖上焦，目不見物，急召夏侯惇商議。惇至殿門前，忽見伏皇后、董貴人、二皇子、伏完、董承等，立在陰雲之中。惇大驚昏倒，左右扶出，自此得病。操召曹洪、陳羣、賈詡、司馬懿等，同至臥榻前，囑以後事。曹洪等頓首曰：“大王善保玉體，不日定當霍然。”操曰：“孤縱橫天下三十餘年，羣雄皆滅，止有江東孫權，西蜀劉備，未曾剿除。孤今病危，不能再與卿等相敍，特以家事相託：孤長子曹昂，劉氏所生，不幸早年歿於宛城。今卞氏生四子：丕、彰、植、熊。孤平生所愛第三子植，為人虛華少誠實，嗜酒放縱，因此不立；次子曹彰，勇而無謀；四子曹熊，多病難保；惟長子曹丕，篤厚恭謹，可繼我業。卿等宜輔佐之。”,"The next day, Jue Qi rushed to the scorch and couldn't see anything, so he urgently summoned Xiahou Dun to discuss. When Dun arrived at the gate of the hall, he suddenly saw Empress Fu, Dong Guiren, the second prince, Fu Wan, Dong Cheng, etc., standing in the dark clouds. Dun collapsed in shock, helped him out from left to right, and became ill since then. Cao summoned Cao Hong, Chen Qun, Jia Xu, Sima Yi, etc., to the couch together, and asked them to do things in the future. Cao Hong and others suddenly said: ""Your Majesty is good at protecting jade body, and it will be a shock in the future."" Cao said: ""For more than 30 years, all the heroes have been wiped out. Only Sun Quan in Jiangdong and Liu Bei in Xishu have not been eradicated. Lone is critically ill now. I can no longer talk to Qing and others, so I trust each other with family affairs: the eldest son, Cao Ang, was born to Liu Shi, but unfortunately died in Wancheng at an early age. Today, Bian Shi has four sons: Pi, Zhang, Zhi, and Xiong. The third son, Zhi, was vain and less honest, and he was addicted to drinking and indulging in alcohol, so he did not stand. The second son, Cao Zhang, was brave and inconsiderate. The fourth son, Cao Xiong, suffered from many illnesses. Please help him.""","When Xiahuo Dun is summoned, he tries to approach but he too sees the ghosts and runs away terrified – and is never the same from that day on. Cao Cao summons Cao Hong, Chen Qun, Jia Xu and Sima Yi to his bedside to impart his final will for the succession. They try to reassure him that he will recover, but he dismisses this. ‘For thirty years I have conquered and slain so many brave men. Only Sun Quan and Xuande have evaded me, and now it’s too late.’ So saying, he discusses all his four sons and their strengths and weaknesses until finally he says, ‘Only the oldest, Pi, is fit to take over. Please be sure to support him.’","He was panting and could no longer see distinctly. He sent hastily for Xiahou Dun, who came at once. But as Xiahou Dun drew near the doors, he too saw the shadowy forms of the slain Empress and her children and many other victims of Cao Cao's cruelty. He was overcome with fear and fell to the ground. The servants raised him and led him away, very ill. Then Cao Cao called in four of his trusty advisers—Cao Hong, Chen Qun, Jia Xu, and Sima Yi—that they might hear his last wishes. Cao Hong, speaking for the four, said, “Take good care of your precious self, O Prince, that you may quickly recover.” But Cao Cao said, “Thirty and more years have I gone up and down, and many a bold leader has fallen before me. The only ones that remain are Sun Quan in the south and Liu Bei in the west. I have not yet slain them. Now I am very ill, and I shall never again stand before you; wherefore my family affairs must be settled. My first born—Cao Ang, son of Lady Liu—fell in battle at Wancheng, when he was young. The Lady Bian bore four sons to me, as you know. The third, Cao Zhi, was my favorite, but he was vain and unreliable, fond of wine and lax in morals. Therefore he is not my heir. My second son, Cao Zhang, is valiant, but imprudent. The fourth, Cao Xiong, is a weakly and may not live long.

却說張郃退守瓦口關，三萬軍已折了二萬，遣人問曹洪求救。洪大怒曰：“汝不聽吾言，強要進兵，失了緊要隘口，却又來求救！”遂不肯發兵，使人催督張郃出戰。郃心慌，只得定計，分兩軍去關口前山僻埋伏；分付曰：“我詐敗，張飛必然趕來，汝等就截其歸路。”當日張郃引軍前進，正遇雷銅。戰不數合，張郃敗走，雷銅趕來。兩軍齊出，截斷回路。張郃復回，刺雷銅於馬下。敗軍回報張飛。飛自來與張郃挑戰。郃又詐敗，張飛不趕。郃又回戰，不數合，又敗走。張飛知是計，收軍回寨，與魏延商議曰：“張郃用埋伏計，殺了雷銅，又要賺吾，何不將計就計？”延問曰：“如何？”飛曰：“我明日先引一軍前往，汝却引精兵於後，待伏兵出，汝可分兵擊之。用車十餘乘，各藏柴草，寨住小路，放火燒之。吾乘勢擒張郃，與雷銅報讎。”魏延領計。次日，張飛引兵前進。張郃兵又至，與張飛交鋒。戰到十合，郃又詐敗。張飛引馬步軍趕來，郃且戰且走。引張飛過山峪口，郃將後軍為前，復紮住營，與飛又戰。指望兩彪伏兵出，要圍困張飛；不想伏兵却被魏延精兵到，趕入峪口，將車輛截住山路，放火燒車，山谷草木皆着，煙迷其徑，兵不得出。張飛只顧引軍衝突，張郃大敗，死命殺開條路，走上瓦口關，收聚敗兵，堅守不出。,"However, Zhang He said that Zhang He retreated to Wakou Pass, and his 30,000-strong army had already lost 20,000, so he sent someone to ask Cao Hong for help. Hong was furious and said, ""You don't listen to my words, but you forced your troops to advance, but you lost an important pass, but you came again to ask for help!"" He refused to send troops, and had Zhang He be urged to fight. He was flustered, so he decided to divide the two armies to ambush in a secluded mountain in front of the pass; Fu Fu said, ""I will deceive and defeat, Zhang Fei will definitely come, and you will cut off his return."" After the battle was over, Zhang He was defeated and Lei Tong came. The two armies marched out to cut off the circuit. Zhang He replied and stabbed Thunder Bronze under his horse. The defeated army returned to Zhang Fei. Fei Zilai challenged Zhang He. He cheated and defeated again, but Zhang Fei did not catch up. He returned to the battle again, but he was defeated again. Zhang Fei knew this was a plan, so he withdrew his army and returned to the village. He discussed with Wei Yan and said, ""Zhang He used an ambush plan to kill Lei Tong, and he wanted to make money from me. Why not just use the plan?"" Yan asked, ""How?"" Fei said, ""I will go ahead tomorrow. You lead an army to go, but you lead the elite soldiers behind. When the ambush soldiers come out, you can divide your troops to attack them. Use more than ten chariots, each of which hides firewood, builds a small road, and sets it on fire. I take advantage of the situation to capture Zhang He, and I will report to Lei Bronze. ""Wei Yan took the lead. The next day, Zhang Fei led his troops forward. Zhang He's troops arrived again and confronted Zhang Fei. When the battle reached Shihe, He cheated and lost again. Zhang Fei led the horse infantry to come, and he fought and walked. He led Zhang Fei to cross the mountain pass, with General He's army in front, and then set up camp again, and fought with Fei again. He hoped that the two soldiers would come out in ambush and besiege Zhang Fei; he did not want to ambush, but Wei Yan's elite soldiers arrived and rushed into Yukou. Zhang Fei only cared about leading the army to conflict, Zhang He was defeated, he desperately killed his way, went to Wakou Pass, gathered the defeated soldiers, and could not hold on.","Eventually managing to fight his way free, Zhang He makes his way to the Wakou pass, having lost two thirds of his men. Not surprisingly Cao Hong is incandescent with rage at this disaster. He tells Zhang He to go back and fight. Ashamed, this is what he does the next day and runs straight into troops led by Lei Tong. In the ensuing mêlée, Lei Tong is lured into pursuing an apparently fleeing Zhang He, only for him to fall victim to that old trick. Zhang He suddenly turns and slays Lei Tong. When news of this reaches Zhang Fei, he rushes to the pass and challenges Zhang He.","Zhang He reached Wakou Pass, but with the loss of two-thirds of his army of thirty thousand troops. He stood on defense and sent urgent messages to Cao Hong to come to his rescue. Cao Hong angrily replied, “He disobeyed my orders and marched; he has lost an important point and now he sends to me for help!” While refusing aid, Cao Hong sent to urge his colleague to go out and fight. But Zhang He too greatly feared. At length Zhang He decided upon a plan of action. He sent out two parties into ambush and said to them, “I will pretend defeat and fly. They will follow and you can cut off their retreat.” When he did march out, he met Lei Tong. The two engaged in battle and Zhang He presently ran away. Lei Tong pursued and fell into the ambush. Then Zhang He returned and slew Lei Tong. His troops went back and told Zhang Fei, who came up to provoke another fight. Zhang He again tried his stratagem, but Zhang Fei did not pursue. Again and again the ruse was tried, but Zhang Fei knew it was only a ruse and simply retired to his own camp. He said to Wei Yan, “Zhang He has compassed the death of Lei Tong by leading him into an ambush, and he wants to inveigle me into another. What say you to meeting trick with trick?” “But how?” said Wei Yan. “Tomorrow I will lead the army forward, you following me with some reliable soldiers. When his army come out from their ambush, you can smite them, sending half your men against each party. We will secretly fill the by-roads with loads of combustibles, entice the enemy among them and start a fire. In the confusion, I shall try to capture Zhang He. So will we avenge our comrade's death.” So Zhang Fei went out, and Zhang He's troops came and began to fight. After a half score bouts, Zhang He ran away, and this time Zhang Fei pursued. Zhang He, now fleeing, now stopping to exchange a blow or two, led Zhang Fei through the hills to a valley. Here, suddenly changing front, he halted, made a camp, and offered battle. It was now the time when Zhang He expected his hidden troops to appear and surround Zhang Fei. But none appeared. He knew not that his ambush had been broken up by Wei Yan's army and driven into the valley where the road was filled with cartloads of combustibles, and that the valley even then was all aflame. Then Zhang Fei came to the attack, and the rout was complete. Zhang He, fighting desperately, got through to the Wakou Pass and there mustered the remnant of his force. He strengthened the position and remained behind his ramparts."

却說孫權接得曹操書信，覽畢，欣然應允，卽修書發付使者先回，乃聚文武商議。張昭曰：“近聞雲長擒于禁，斬龐德，威震華夏，操欲遷都以避其鋒。今樊城危急，遣使求救，事定之後，恐有反覆。”權未及發言，忽報呂蒙乘小舟自陸口來，有事面稟。權召入問之。蒙曰：“今雲長提兵圍樊城，可乘其遠出，襲取荊州。”權曰：“孤欲北取徐州，如何？”蒙曰：“今操遠在河北，未暇東顧。徐州守兵無多，往自可克；然其地勢利於陸戰，不利水戰，縱然得之，亦難保守。不如先取荊州，全據長江，別作良圖。”權曰：“孤本欲取荊州，前言特以試卿耳。卿可速為孤圖之。孤當隨後便起兵也。”,"However, Sun Quan said that he received Cao Cao's letter, read it, and readily agreed. Zhang Zhao said: ""I heard that Yun Chang captured Yu Jin, beheaded Pang De, shocked Hua Xia, and tried to move the capital to avoid his attack. Fancheng is in a crisis, and an envoy has been sent to ask for help. He suddenly reported that Lu Meng had come from Lukou in a small boat and had something to report. The right to call in to ask. Meng said: ""Now Yun Chang has sent troops to surround Fancheng, and he can take it far away and attack Jingzhou."" Quan said: ""I want to take Xuzhou from the north, how about it?"" Meng said: ""Now Cao is far away in Hebei, and I don't have time to look east. Xuzhou. If there are not many defenders, it can be conquered by itself; however, the terrain is favorable for land warfare, but not for water warfare. Even if it is obtained, it will be difficult to defend. It is better to take Jingzhou first, and take the entire Yangtze River. Don’t make a good plan.” Quan said: “I want to take it alone Jingzhou, the foreword is to test your ears. You can quickly make a plan for it. Gudang will then raise his army.""","When Sun Quan receives the letter, he summons his advisers. Zhang Zhao is deeply suspicious of Cao Cao’s motives, pointing out that the Wei are faltering. ‘Why, they are even discussing abandoning the capital,’ he says. ‘This is just a trick to divert us from attacking them and to get us instead to help them out by attacking Xuande.’ Before Sun Quan can reply, news comes that Lü Meng has arrived from the city of Lukou. The news he brings is that Guan Yu is off attacking Fancheng and that therefore this is the perfect time to attack and take Jingzhou. That ends the discussion as far as Sun Quan is concerned. The decision is made to seize Jingzhou while Guan Yu is away. Lü Meng is given authorization to prepare the plan of attack, while Sun Quan will follow on soon with the rest of the army.","Sun Quan fell in with the scheme of Cao Cao as soon as he had read Cao Cao's letter. He at once prepared a reply for the messenger to take back, and then gathered his officers, civil and military, to consult. Zhang Zhao was the first speaker. “We know Guan Yu has captured one leader and slain another. This has added greatly to his fame and reputation. Cao Cao was going to move the capital rather than risk an attack. We also know that Fankou is in imminent danger. Cao Cao has asked for our help; but when he has gained his end, I doubt whether he will hold to his promise.” Before Sun Quan had replied they announced the arrival of Lu Meng, who had come in a small ship from Lukou with a special message. He was at once called in and asked what it was. Said Lu Meng, “The armies of Guan Yu being absent at Fankou, the opportunity should be taken to attack Jingzhou.” “But I wish to attack Xuzhou in the north; what of this plan?” said Sun Quan. “It would be better to attack Jingzhou, and so get control of the Great River. Cao Cao is far away to the north and too occupied to regard the east. Xuzhou is weakly held and could be taken easily, but the lie of the land favors the use of an army rather than a navy force. If you capture it, it will not be easy to hold; but once you hold Jingzhou, you can evolve other schemes.” “Really, my desire was to attack Jingzhou, but I wished to hear what you would say to the other plan. Now, Sir, make me a plan speedily and I will act upon it.” So Lu Meng took his leave and went back to Lukou."
於是孔明與許靖，引大小官僚上表，請漢中王卽皇帝位。漢中王覽表，大驚曰：“卿等欲陷孤為不忠不義之人耶？”孔明奏曰：“非也：曹丕篡漢自立，主上乃漢室苗裔，理合繼統以延漢祀。”漢中王勃然變色曰：“孤豈效逆賊所為！”拂袖而起，入於後宮。衆官皆散。三日後，孔明又引衆官入朝，請漢中王出。衆皆拜伏於前。許靖奏曰：“今漢天子已被曹丕所弒，王上不卽帝位，興師討逆，不得為忠義也。今天下無不欲王上為君，為孝愍皇帝雪恨。若不從臣等所議，是失民望矣。”漢中王曰：“孤雖是景帝之孫，並未有德澤以布於民，今一旦自立為帝，與篡竊何異？”孔明苦勸數次，漢中王堅執不從。孔明乃設一計，謂衆官曰：“如此如此。”於是孔明託病不出。,"So Kong Ming and Xu Jing invited the big and small bureaucrats to the table, and asked the emperor of Hanzhong to take the throne. The king of Hanzhong looked at the table, and said in shock, ""You want to trap the solitary people as unfaithful and unrighteous people?"" Kong Ming said, ""No, Cao Pi usurped the Han Dynasty and established himself, and the master is a descendant of the Han family. Sacrifice."" The King of Hanzhong suddenly changed his color and said, ""How can you be a traitor!"" He stood up and entered the harem. All the officials are gone. Three days later, Kong Ming led the officials to the court and invited the king of Hanzhong to leave. All bowed before them. Xu Jing said: ""Today, the emperor of Han has been killed by Cao Pi, the king will not hold the throne, and he will not be loyal and righteous. What you have discussed is a disappointment to the people."" The King of Hanzhong said, ""Although Gu is the grandson of Emperor Jing, there is no virtue and Ze to spread to the people. Now, once he becomes emperor, how is it different from usurpation?"" Kong Ming persuaded the number. Second, Wang Jian of Hanzhong refused to obey. Kong Ming devised a plan and told the officials: ""This is the case."" So Kong Ming did not get sick.","However, when Kong Ming and the other officials present the petition to Xuande, he is genuinely horrified and scandalized. ‘How can you even suggest such a rebellious, disloyal action!’ says Xuande, to which Kong Ming responds, ‘But of course we are not suggesting rebellion. But let’s face facts. Cao Pi has usurped the Han and seized the throne. You are a scion of the House of Liu, and it is your due and proper duty to take back control.’ Rising in his anger, Xuande retorts, ‘You ask me to imitate the actions of a traitor!’ and marches out. Kong Ming leaves it for three days and then calls for a meeting with the king again. ‘Cao Pi has had the emperor murdered, and unless Your Majesty takes the reins of power and goes to war against these traitors you’ll surely have failed to be a loyal and faithful subject. The whole world wants you to rule and to thereby avenge the murder of the late Emperor Xian. If you fail to do so, well, frankly the people will be distraught with disappointment.’ But once again the king refuses, saying that, while he is a scion of Emperor Jing, he has nothing of the virtue of that great founder. Nothing seems able to make him change his mind. But Kong Ming thinks of a plan to force him to act, and he departs for his home, telling everyone that he is very ill. No sooner does Xuande hear this than he goes to visit Kong Ming. Going straight in, Xuande asks, ‘What is wrong with you?’ to which Kong Ming replies, ‘My heart is on fire, and I’m afraid I’ll soon be dead.’ ‘What has brought this on?’ asks Xuande, but Kong Ming makes no reply, no matter how often the king asks him.","Whereupon Zhuge Liang and Xu Jing, at the head of a large number of officers, presented a memorial requesting the Prince to assume the title of Emperor. But Liu Bei objected. “O Nobles, do you desire to set my feet in the way of disloyalty and wrong-doing?” “Not so,” said Zhuge Liang. “But Cao Pi has usurped the Throne, while you are a scion of the House. It is right and proper that you succeed and prolong the line.” But the Prince suddenly showed anger, saying, “Can I imitate the deeds of such a rebel?” He rose and left the chamber, going to his own apartments. So the officials dispersed. But three days later Zhuge Liang again led a deputation to the court, and they requested that the Prince should come forth and hear them. He came, and they all prostrated themselves. Xu Jing spoke, “The late Emperor of the Hans has been slain by Cao Pi. You, O Prince, will fail both in loyalty and rectitude if you do not assume the succession and destroy the wrong-doers. The whole empire requests you to rule that you may avenge the death of the late Emperor, and the people will be disappointed if you do not accede to their wishes.” The Prince replied, “Although I am descended from the grandson of Emperor Myers, I have not been of the least advantage; and if I assumed the title of 'Emperor,' how would that act differ from usurpation?” Zhuge Liang pleaded with him again and again, but the Prince remained obdurate. Then Zhuge Liang bethought that where argument failed a ruse might succeed. So having arranged the parts his several colleagues were to play, he pleaded illness and remained at home. Presently it was told the Prince that his adviser's condition was becoming serious, wherefore Liu Bei went to see him as he lay on his couch."
次日辭歸，見司馬昭細言其事。昭大怒曰：“鼠輩安敢如此！”充曰：“誕在淮南，深得人心，久必為患：可速除之。”昭遂暗發密書與揚州刺史樂綝，一面遣使齎詔徵誕為司空。誕得了詔書，已知是賈充告變，遂捉來使拷問，使者曰：“此事樂綝知之。”誕曰：“他如何得知？”使者曰：“司馬將軍已令人到揚州送密書與樂綝矣。”誕大怒，叱武士斬了來使，遂起部下兵千人，殺奔揚州來。將至南門，城門已閉，弔橋拽起。誕在城下叫門，城上並無一人回答。誕大怒曰：“樂綝匹夫，安敢如此！”遂令將士打城。手下十餘驍騎，下馬渡壕，飛身上城，殺散軍士，大開城門。於是諸葛誕引兵入城，乘風放火，殺至綝家。綝慌上樓避之。誕提劍上樓，大喝曰：“汝父樂進，昔日受魏國大恩！不思報本，反欲順司馬昭耶！”綝未及回言，為誕所殺。一面具表數司馬昭之罪，使人申奏洛陽；一面大聚兩淮屯田戶口十餘萬，并揚州新降兵四萬餘人，積草屯糧，準備進兵。又令長史吳綱送子諸葛靚入吳為質求援，務要合兵誅討司馬昭。,"The next day, he resigned and saw Sima Zhao talk about his affairs in detail. Zhao was furious and said, ""Rats dare to be like this!"" Chong said: ""I was born in Huainan, and won the hearts of the people. It will be a problem for a long time: I can get rid of it quickly."" Birthday is Sikong. When he got the edict, he knew that it was Jia Chong's change, so he arrested him and asked him to interrogate him. The messenger said, ""It's a pleasure to know about this."" The messenger said, ""How did he know?"" The messenger said, ""General Sima has sent people to Yangzhou. Send the secret book and music."" Tang was furious, and he ordered the warrior to behead the envoy, so he raised a thousand soldiers and rushed to Yangzhou. Approaching the South Gate, the city gate was closed, and the suspension bridge was pulled up. He called the door at the bottom of the city, but no one in the city answered. Dan was furious and said: ""Le Chen's husband, An dare to do this!"" So he ordered the soldiers to attack the city. With more than ten cavalry under his command, they dismounted their horses and crossed the trenches, flew to the city, slaughtered the sergeants, and opened the city gates. So Zhuge Dan led his troops into the city, set fire to the wind, and killed them to Chen's house. Chen panicked and went upstairs to avoid him. Dan picked up his sword and went upstairs, shouting loudly, ""Your father is happy to make progress. In the past, you received a great favor from the Wei state! Instead of thinking about repaying the book, you want to obey Sima Zhaoye instead!"" One mask counts Sima Zhao's crimes, and he makes people report to Luoyang. He also ordered the chief historian Wu Gang to send his son Zhuge Liang into Wu as a hostage to ask for help, and he must join forces to punish Sima Zhao.","All this is swiftly reported back to Sima Zhao, who is rattled by such opposition and decides to get rid of Zhuge Dan. He tries to lure him to court by offering him a new post, but Zhuge Dan immediately knows the real reason. A letter demanding the execution of Zhuge Dan is also sent to the imperial governor of the region, Yue Chen. Learning of the letter, Zhuge Dan responds immediately. He draws together a thousand of his men, seizes the provincial capital, slays Yue Chen and his entire family and then sends a formal memorial to the emperor denouncing Sima Zhao and his crimes. Then he recruits men from the fields and within weeks has an army of around one hundred and fifty thousand. He also seeks an alliance with Wu to back up his defiance.","He soon returned and told Sima Zhao what had been said. “The rat!” cried Sima Zhao, angrily. “Zhuge Dan is exceedingly popular there in the South of River Huai; and if he is left too long, he will do harm.” Sima Zhao began to take measures. He wrote privately to Yue Chen, Imperial Protector of Yangzhou, and sent a messenger to Zhuge Dan with an edict making him Minister of Works. This meant that Zhuge Dan had to come to the capital. But Zhuge Dan knew that Jia Chong had done him mischief, and he interrogated the messenger, who told him that Yue Chen knew all about the matter. “How does he know?” “General Sima Zhao sent him a private letter.” The messenger was condemned to death. Then Zhuge Dan placed himself at the head of his personal guard and marched to Yangzhou. The city gates were closed and the drawbridge raised. He summoned the gate, but no one answered. “How dare this fellow Yue Chen treat me thus?” cried Zhuge Dan. He ordered his troops to force the gate. Ten of his bold generals dismounted, crossed the moat, and climbed the ramparts, where they slew all who opposed them and opened the gate. The others entered, set fire to the houses, and began to fight their way toward the state residence. The Imperial Protector sought refuge in a tower, but Zhuge Dan made his way up and reproached his enemy, crying, “ Your father, Yue Jin, enjoyed the bounty of Wei; yet you have not sought to repay the kindness of the Ruling House, but you want to help the rebel Sima Zhao.” Before Yue Chen was able to answer, Zhuge Dan slew him. Then he sent to Luoyang a memorial detailing Sima Yi's many faults, and made preparations for war. He called up all the militia of the south and east of River Huai, to the total of one hundred thousand, and took over the forty thousand troops who had surrendered on the fall of Yue Chen and gathered supplies. He also sent Adviser Wu Gang to Wu for aid, offering his son Zhuge Jing as a hostage for his good faith."
須臾，血流盈盆。佗刮盡其毒，敷上藥，以線縫之。公大笑而起，謂衆將曰：“此臂伸舒如故，並無痛矣。先生眞神醫也！”佗曰：“某為醫一生，未嘗見此。君侯眞天神也！”後人有詩曰：,"For a moment, the blood flowed into the basin. Tuo scraped off the poison, applied medicine, and sutured it with thread. The Duke burst into laughter and told the generals, ""This arm is stretched out as comfortably as before, and there is no pain. Sir, you are truly a genius doctor!"" Tuo said, ""A certain doctor has never seen this in his entire life. You are indeed a god of heaven!"" There is a poem that says:","I felt nothing! You, sir, are a wonderful doctor.’ ‘I have done many operations but never have I seen anything like this! You, sir, are frankly a superhuman!’ Hugely grateful, Guan Yu offers gold to Hua Tuo, who refuses, saying, ‘I need no reward.","But Guan Yu went on with his game, only drinking a cup of wine now and again, and his face betrayed no sign of pain.

Indeed, Master, you are a marvel.” “I have spent my life in the art;” said Hua Tuo, “but I have never seen such a patient as you, Sir.

劉璝又問曰：“我四人氣數如何？”紫虛上人曰：“定數難逃，何必再問？”璝又請問時，上人眉垂目合，恰似睡着的一般，並不答應。四人下山。劉璝曰：“仙人之言，不可不信。”張任曰：“此狂叟也，聽之何益？”遂上馬前行。旣至雒縣，分調人馬，守把各處隘口。劉璝曰：“雒城乃成都之保障，失此則成都難保。吾四人公議，着二人守城，二人去雒縣前面，依山傍險，紮下兩個寨子，勿使敵兵臨城。”冷苞、鄧賢曰：“某願往結寨。”劉璝大喜，分兵二萬，與冷、鄧二人，離城六十里下寨。劉璝、張任守護雒城。,"Liu Zhou asked again, ""How are my four popularity?"" Master Zixu said, ""The number cannot be escaped, so why should I ask again?"" Do not agree. The four went down the mountain. Liu Jing said, ""You must believe the words of the immortals."" Zhang Ren said, ""This is a crazy old man. What's the benefit of listening to it?"" When he arrived at Luo County, he dispatched troops and guarded various passes. Liu Yan said: ""Luocheng is the protection of Chengdu, without it, Chengdu will not be able to guarantee it. The four of us agreed, and two of them were to defend the city. The two of them went to the front of Luoxian County, surrounded by mountains and dangers, and built two stockades. Don't let the enemy. The troops are approaching the city."" Leng Bao and Deng Xian said, ""I would like to go to Jiezhai."" Liu Quan was overjoyed, and divided his troops of 20,000, and together with Leng and Deng, went down to the village sixty miles away from the city. Liu Wei and Zhang Ren guard Luocheng.","See that when the chance comes, you take it – or else you’re landing in the Nine Springs of Hell. Having delivered himself of this, the sage refuses to answer any more personal questions regarding their individual fates. As they return down the hill, Liu Gui says with some embarrassment, ‘Well, I suppose you just have to listen to the words of these immortals.’ But Zhang Ren retorts, ‘He’s nothing more than a mad old man, and what he said was nonsense.’ So on they ride on to Luocheng. As this is crucial for the defence of Chengdu, they decide to divide their forces. Ling Bao and Deng Xian set up two camps on the approaches to the city, while Liu Gui and Zhang Ren defend the city itself.","Lest ye descend to the Nine Golden Springs.” Having read the oracle, they pressed the seer to reveal them their individual fortunes, but he replied, “Why ask these things? None can escape his fate.” Liu Gui ventured to question the Sage further, but his eyelids dropped as if he slumbered. Nor would he vouchsafe a word more, and the four generals took leave and descended the hill. “One must have faith in such as he says,” said Liu Gui. “What is to be gained by listening to the sayings of a daft old man?” replied Zhang Ren. So they continued their road to Luocheng. When they arrived, they said, “Luocheng is the throat of the road to Chengdu. We must create a pincers defense for the city. Two of us are to guard the ramparts while the other two are to station themselves in front of the city, where is a point of vantage sheltered by some hills.” Thus Deng Xian and Ling Bao wanted to build the ramparts outside the city. Twenty thousand troops were told off; the two generals went to establish two camps in two stockades twenty miles away, hoping to be able to keep the foe away from the city. The River Fu Pass being captured, Liu Bei took counsel with his adviser as to the next point to be attempted."

却說姜維引兵過了橋頭，正行之間，前面一軍來到：乃左將軍張翼、右將軍廖化也。維問之。翼曰：“黃皓聽信師巫之言，不肯發兵。翼聞漢中已危，自起兵來時，陽安關已被鍾會所取。今聞將軍受困，特來接應。”遂合兵一處，前赴白水關。化曰：“今四面受敵，糧道不通，不如退守劍閣，再作良圖。”維疑慮未決。忽報鍾會、鄧艾分兵十餘路殺來。維欲與翼、化分兵迎之。化曰：“白水地狹路多，非爭戰之所，不如且退去救劍閣可也：若劍閣一失，是絕路矣。”維從之，遂引兵來投劍閣。將近關前，忽報鼓角齊鳴，喊聲大起，旌旗遍豎，一枝軍把住關口。正是：,"But he said that Jiang Wei led his troops across the bridge, and while they were on their way, an army came in front: Zhang Yi, general on the left, and Liao Hua, general on the right. Wei asked. Yi said: ""Huang Hao listened to the words of the sorcerer and refused to send troops. Yi heard that Hanzhong was in danger, and since the start of the troops, Yang'an Pass had been taken by Zhonghui. I heard that the general was trapped, and came here to respond."" One, go to Baishuiguan. Hua said: ""I am surrounded by enemies on all sides, and the food supply is not available. It is better to retreat to the sword pavilion and make good plans."" Wei's doubts were still unresolved. Suddenly, Zhonghui and Deng Ai split up and attacked in more than ten ways. Wei Yu and Wing and Hua split up to welcome him. Hua said: ""Baishui has many narrow roads, and it is not a place to fight. It is better to retreat and save the Jiange: if the Jiange is lost, it will be a dead end."" Before the pass was approaching, drums and horns rang in unison, shouting loudly, banners and flags were erected, and an army held the pass. Exactly:","The Wei armies led by Zhong Hui and Deng Ai advance without cessation, and place after place falls to them. Jiang Wei is driven back and back. He is almost trapped, but through subterfuge manages to escape across a ford and take up a defensive position at the Jian pass. But no sooner has he arrived than he sees before him a vast army.","Soon after Jiang Wei crossed the bridge, he saw another force, but this was led by his own generals, Liao Hua and Zhang Yi. They told him, “Huang Hao, firm in his faith in the wise woman, would not send help to defend the frontiers. We heard Hanzhong was threatened, and thus marched there to its rescue, but then Zhong Hui had taken the Yangping Pass. We also heard you were surrounded here, so we came to your help.” The two armies amalgamated and marched together. Liao Hua said, “We are attacked all round, and the grain transportation is blocked. It seems to me wisest to retire on the Saber Pass and plan other designs.” But Jiang Wei was doubtful. Then they heard that Deng Ai and Zhong Hui were approaching in ten divisions. Jiang Wei was disposed to stand, but Liao Hua said, “This country of White Water is too narrow and difficult to fight in with any hope of success. It would better to retreat to the Saber Pass. If we loss that pass, all paths will be closed to us.” At last Jiang Wei consented, and the march began. But as they neared the pass, they heard drums rolling and saw flags fluttering, which told them that the pass was held. Hanzhong, that strong defense, is lost."

却說西川百姓，聽知曹操已取東川，料必來取西川；一日之間，數遍驚恐。玄德請軍師商議。孔明曰：“亮有一計，曹操自退。”玄德問何計。孔明曰：“曹操分軍屯合淝，懼孫權也。今我若分江夏、長沙、桂陽三郡還吳，遣舌辯之士，陳說利害，令吳起兵襲合淝，牽動其勢，操必勒兵南向矣。”玄德問：“誰可為使？”伊籍曰：“某願往。”玄德大喜，遂作書具禮，令伊籍先到荊州，知會雲長，然後入吳。到秣陵，來見孫權，先通了姓名。權召籍入。籍見權禮畢，權問曰：“汝到此何為？”籍曰：“昨承諸葛子瑜取長沙等三郡，為軍師不在，有失交割，今傳書送還。所有荊州南郡、零陵，本欲送還；被曹操襲取東川，使關將軍無容身之地。今合淝空虛，望君侯起兵攻之，使曹操撤兵回南。吾主若取了東川，卽還荊州全土。”權曰：“汝且歸館舍，容吾商議。”伊籍退出，權問計於衆謀士。張昭曰：“此是劉備恐曹操取西川，故為此謀。雖然如此，可因操在漢中，乘勢取合淝，亦是上計。”權從之，發付伊籍回蜀去訖，便議起兵攻操：令魯肅收取長沙、江夏、桂陽三郡，屯兵於陸口；取呂蒙、甘寧回；又去餘杭取凌統回。,"But he said that the people of Xichuan, when they heard that Cao Cao had taken Dongchuan, expected that he would come to take Xichuan; they were frightened several times in one day. Xuande asked the strategist to discuss. Kong Ming said: ""Liang has a plan, Cao Cao will retreat."" Xuande asked what plan. Kong Ming said: ""Cao Cao divided his army into Hefei, and he was afraid of Sun Quan. Now if I divide Jiangxia, Changsha, and Guiyang to return to Wu, and use my tongue to argue with people, I will tell my interests and my interests, so that Wu will raise troops to attack Hefei and affect his situation. Cao will force his troops to the south."" Xuande asked, ""Who can be the envoy?"" Yi Ji said, ""Someone wants to go."" , and then into Wu. When he arrived at Moling, he came to see Sun Quan, and he passed his name first. Call for citizenship. When Ji saw Quan's ceremony completed, Quan asked, ""What are you doing here?"" Ji said, ""Yesterday, Zhuge Ziyu took Changsha and other three counties, but because the strategist was not there, the delivery was lost, and now the book is sent back. All the southern counties of Jingzhou, Lingling, originally intended to be returned, was attacked by Cao Cao and took Dongchuan, leaving General Guan with no place to stay. Now Hefei is empty, and Wang Junhou raises troops to attack it, causing Cao Cao to withdraw his troops and return to the south. If my lord takes Dongchuan, you will return the entire territory of Jingzhou. Quan said, ""You will return to the building, and allow me to discuss."" Yi Ji withdrew, and Quan asked all the advisors. Zhang Zhao said: ""This is because Liu Bei was afraid that Cao Cao would take Xichuan, so he planned this. Even so, since Cao Cao is in Hanzhong, it is also the best strategy to take advantage of the situation."" Then they proposed to raise troops to attack: order Lu Su to take the three counties of Changsha, Jiangxia, and Guiyang, and station troops at Lukou; take Lumeng and Ganning back; and go to Yuhang to take Lingtong back.","When news reaches Xuande in the west of Shu, he is convinced that Cao Cao will come for him next. Frankly he is really frightened. However, as usual, Kong Ming has a plan: ‘Cao has an army at Hefei for fear of attack by Sun Quan. Well, if we give Sun back the half of the Jingzhou territory, that might encourage Wu to attack Hefei, and that would draw Cao Cao away.’ When the proposal is sent to Sun Quan, he accepts, even though some of his advisers are sceptical, to say the least. Lu Su is sent to take possession of the lands Xuande has given up, while Sun Quan, Ling Tong and others set off to attack Hefei.","Meanwhile the populace of Yiazhou, having heard of Cao Cao's success in the Eastern Land of Rivers, concluded that the Western Land of Rivers would suffer next, and fear spread among them. Whereupon Liu Bei called in the Directing Instructor and asked his advice. Zhuge Liang replied, “I can make Cao Cao retreat of his own accord.” “What is that plan?” “A part of Cao Cao's army is camped at Hefei because of the fear of Sun Quan. If now we restore three territories of Jingzhou—Changsha, Jiangxia, and Guiyang—, and send a specious person to talk, we can make Sun Quan attack Hefei, which will lead to Cao Cao going southward and not looking to the west.” “Who is a fit person for the messenger?” said Liu Bei. And Yi Ji replied, “I will go.” Liu Bei, well-satisfied, wrote letters and prepared gifts, with which Yi Ji went, calling in at Jingzhou City on the way to tell Guan Yu. Then he went on to the capital city of Moling and saw Sun Quan. After the greetings, Sun Quan asked, “On what business do you come?” Yi Ji replied, “On a former occasion Zhuge Jin would have had the three territories of Changsha, Lingling, and Guiyang, but for the absence of the Directing Instructor, which prevented the actual transfer. Now I am the bearer of letters giving Changsha, Guiyang, and Jiangxia back to you. Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang wanted to restore all the territories of Jingzhou, including those of Nanjun and Lingling, but now that Cao Cao has got possession of Eastern Land of Rivers, there is no place for General Guan Yu. Hefei is weak, and we hope you will attack it so as to make Cao Cao withdraw to the south and let my master take the Eastern Land of Rivers, when he will restore the whole of the Jingzhou Region.” “Go back to the guest-house and let me take counsel in this matter,” said Sun Quan. As soon as Yi Ji had gone, the Marquis of Wu turned to his officers and asked what should be done. Zhang Zhao said, “All this is because Liu Bei fears that Cao Cao will attack him. However, since Cao Cao is absent in Hanzhong, it would be well to seize the opportunity and attack Hefei.” Sun Quan accepted the advice. After he had sent the messenger away, he began to prepare for the expedition. He left Lu Su in command over the three territories of Changsha, Jiangxia, and Guiyang."
吳班殺出重圍，又遇吳兵追趕；幸得趙雲接着，救回白帝城去了。時有蠻王沙摩柯，匹馬奔走，正逢周泰，戰二十餘合，被泰所殺。蜀將杜路、劉寧盡皆降吳。蜀營一應糧草器仗，尺寸不存。蜀將川兵，降者無數。時孫夫人在吳，聞猇亭兵敗，訛傳先主死於軍中，遂驅車至江邊，望西遙哭，投江而死。後人立廟江濱，號曰梟姬祠。尚論者作詩歎之曰：,"Wu Ban broke out of the siege and was chased by Wu soldiers; fortunately, Zhao Yun followed and rescued Baidi City. At that time, there was the barbarian king Shamoke, who was running on horses, just in time for Zhou Tai, who was killed by Tai in the battle for more than 20 times. Shu generals Du Lu and Liu Ning all surrendered to Wu. Shu Ying Yi should have grain and grass, but the size does not exist. Shu generals and troops from Sichuan have descended innumerably. When Mrs. Sun was in Wu, she heard that Xiaoting was defeated, and it was false that the First Sovereign died in the army, so she drove to the riverside, looked westward and cried, and threw herself into the river to die. Later generations built a temple on the riverside, called Xiaoji Temple. The commentator wrote a poem and sighed:","Many are the commanders of the Shu who fall that day – Cheng Ji takes his own life in despair, surrounded as he is; Wu Ban and Feng Xi, raising the siege of Yiling, are cut off and die at the hands of Sun Huan’s army. The tribal leader Shamoke is slain by Zhou Tai, while commanders Du Lu and Liu Ning surrender. Thus all the provisions of the Shu fall into enemy hands. When Lady Sun hears of the destruction of the army of Shu and is told that her husband Xuande has died, she goes to the river and faces west in honour of her husband. Then she throws herself into the river and drowns herself. A temple has arisen there, and a poet has said:","Wu Ban broke through. He was pursued, but he luckily fell in with Zhao Yun and got safely to Baidicheng. The Mang tribesmen King Shamo Ke was flying from the battle field when he met Zhou Tai, who slew him after a short fight. The two Shu generals Du Lu and Liu Ning surrendered to Wu, as did many soldiers. Of the stores and weapons in the camps of Shu nothing was saved. When the story of the disaster to Shu reached the Southern Land, and with it the report that the First Ruler had been killed in battle, Lady Sun gave way to wild grief. She rode down to the river bank and, gazing westward, wept and lamented. Then she threw herself into the stream and was drowned. Posterity erected a temple on the shore called “The Shrine of the Bold Beauty,” and one who described it wrote a poem:"
玄德旣為漢中王，遂修表一道，差人齎赴許都。表曰：,"Xuan Dezhen was the king of Hanzhong, so he repaired a watch and sent people to Xudu. The table says:",Then Xuande writes to the emperor.,"As soon as the investiture was completed, Liu Bei composed a memorial and sent it to Capital Xuchang. This is the document:"
却說魏殿中校尉尹大目，乃曹爽心腹之人——因爽被司馬懿謀殺，故事司馬師，常有殺師報爽之心；又素與文欽交厚——今見師眼瘤突出，不能動止，乃入帳告曰：“文欽本無反心，今被毋丘儉逼迫，以致如此。某去說之，必然來降。”師從之。大目頂盔摜甲，乘馬來趕文欽；看看趕上，乃高聲大叫曰：“文刺史見尹大目麼？”欽回頭視之，大目除盔放在鞍鞽之前，以鞭指曰：“文刺史何不忍耐數日也？”——此是大目知師將亡，故來留欽。欽不解其意，厲聲大罵，便欲開弓射之。大目大哭而回。欽收聚人馬奔壽春時，已被諸葛誕引兵取了；欲復回項城時，胡遵、王基、鄧艾三路兵皆到。欽見勢危，遂投東吳孫峻去了。,"But he said that Lieutenant Colonel Wei Dian Yin Damu was Cao Shuang's confidant-because Shuang was murdered by Sima Yi, the story is that Sima Shi always wanted to kill his teacher to repay Shuang; When the movement stopped, he entered the account and said: ""Wen Qin had no remorse, but now he was persecuted by Guanqiujian, so that he did. If someone goes to talk about it, he will definitely come down."" Damu put his helmet on his armour and chased Wen Qin on horseback; when he saw that he was catching up, he shouted loudly, ""Have you seen Yin Damu?"" The whip pointed and said: ""Why can't the governor of Wen endure for a few days?"" - This is the Damuzhishi who is about to die, so he came to stay in Qin. Qin didn't understand what he meant, and cursed loudly, and wanted to shoot at him with his bow. Big eyes crying back. When Qin gathered his men and horses to rush to Shouchun, they were already captured by Zhuge Dan; when they wanted to return to Xiangcheng, Hu Zun, Wang Ji, and Deng Ai all arrived. Seeing that the situation was in danger, Qin went to Sun Jun in the Eastern Wu Dynasty.","Then Sima Shi’s sickness takes a turn for the worse, and he knows he is dying. He summons his brother Sima Zhao. ‘There is no way,’ says Sima Shi, ‘that I can simply pretend that the heavy duty I have does not count for anything. I must therefore pass the burden on to you. But remember this at all times: trust no one. For if you do, they will destroy our clan.’ Sima Zhao, weeping, accepts the seal of authority. Wanting to ask for advice, Sima Zhao starts to speak, but his words are interrupted by a heart-rending cry from Sima Shi.","Now Minister Yin Damu had accompanied Sima Shi on his expedition, but was no friend of his. He had been of the Cao Shuang's party and bitterly resented the death of his patron. He was watching for a chance to avenge him. Seeing that Sima Shi was ill, he thought to secure his end by making friends with Wen Qin. So he went in to see the sick Sima Shi, and said, “Wen Qin had no sincere intention to rebel, but was led astray by Guanqiu Jian. If you will let me go and speak with him, he will come over to you at once.” Sima Shi said he might go to try, and Yin Damu put on his armor and rode after Wen Qin. By and by he got near enough to shout. “Do you not recognize me? I am Yin Damu.” Wen Qin stopped and looked back. Yin Damu removed his helmet that his face might be clearly seen, and said, “O Imperial Protector, why can you not bear up for a few days?” Yin Damu implied that Sima Shi was very near death, and he wished Wen Qin to remain at hand. But Wen Qin did not understand. He abused Yin Damu and even threatened that the bowmen should shoot, and Yin Damu could only sorrowfully turn away. When Wen Qin reached Shouchun and found it occupied by Zhuge Dan, he tried for Xiangcheng. But three armies under Hu Zun, Wang Ji, and Deng Ai came up and attacked at once so that it seemed impossible that his army could hold out long. So he decided to flee to Wu and serve Sun Jun."

却說吳主孫權，先有太子孫登，乃徐夫人所生，於吳赤烏四年身亡，遂立次子孫和為太子，乃瑯琊王夫人所生。和因與全公主不睦，被公主所譖，權廢之。和憂恨而死。又立三子孫亮為太子，乃潘夫人所生。此時陸遜、諸葛瑾皆亡，一應大小事務，皆歸於諸葛恪。太元元年秋八月初一日，忽起大風，江海湧濤，平地水深八尺。吳主先陵所種松柏，盡皆拔起，直飛到建業城南門外，倒插於道上。權因此受驚成病。至次年四月內，病勢沈重，乃召太傅諸葛恪、大司馬呂岱至榻前，囑以後事。囑訖而薨。在位二十四年，壽七十一歲：乃蜀漢延熙十五年也。後人有詩曰：,"However, it is said that Sun Quan, the master of Wu, first had the crown prince Sun Deng, who was born to Mrs. Xu, who died in Wu Chiwu four years later, and then made the second son and grandson He as the crown prince, who was born to the wife of the king of Langya. He was slandered by the princess because he was at odds with the whole princess, and the right was abolished. and dying of grief. He also established his third son, Sun Liang, as the crown prince, who was born to Mrs. Pan. At this time, Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin were both dead, and all matters, big or small, belonged to Zhuge Ke. On the first day of autumn and August in the first year of Taiyuan, there was a sudden strong wind, the river and sea surged, and the water was eight feet deep on the ground. All the pines and cypresses planted in the mausoleum of Wu Zhuxian were pulled up and flew straight to the south gate of Jianye City, where they were inserted upside down on the road. Quan became stunned. In April of the following year, he was seriously ill, so he summoned the Grand Fu Zhuge Ke and the Great Sima Lv Dai to the bed and asked him to do things in the future. Instructed and died. Twenty-four years in the reign and seventy-one years of life: it was the fifteenth year of Yanxi of the Shu Han Dynasty. A later poem says:","In Wu, also in late summer that year, a storm blows over the tall trees around the shrine of the Sun family and the shock of this brings on a serious illness for Sun Quan. Six months later, in early AD 252, he dies. He had reigned for twenty-four years and was seventy-one years old. A poet has said of him:","The Ruler of Wu, Sun Quan, had named his son Sun Deng as his heir. His mother was Lady Xu. But Sun Deng died, and the second son Sun He was chosen his successor. His mother was Lady Wang. A quarrel arose between Sun He and Princess Quan, who maligned him and intrigued against him, so that he was set aside. Sun He died of mortification. Then the third son Sun Liang was named the Heir Apparent; his mother was Lady Pan. At this time Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin were both dead, and the business of the government, great and small, was in the hands of Zhuge Ke, son of Zhuge Jin. In the first year of Grand Beginning (AD 251), on the first of the eighth month, a great storm passed over Wu. The waves rose to a great height, and the water stood eight feet deep over the low-lying lands. The pines and cypresses, which grew at the cemetery of the Imperial Ancestors of Wu, were uprooted and carried to the South Gate of Jianye, where they stuck, roots upward, in the road. Sun Quan was frightened and fell ill. In the early days of the next year his illness became serious, whereupon he called in Imperial Guardian Zhuge Ke and Regent Marshal Lu Dai to hear the declaration of his last wishes. Soon after he died, at the age of seventy-one. He had reigned for twenty-four years. In Shu-Han calendar it was the fifteenth year of Long Enjoyment (AD 252). A hero, green-eyed and red-bearded,"
却說鍾會大軍，迤邐望漢中進發。前軍先鋒許儀，要立頭功，先領兵至南鄭關。儀謂部將曰：“過此關卽漢中矣。關上不多人馬，我等便可奮力搶關。”衆將領命，一齊并力向前。原來守關蜀將盧遜，早知魏兵將到，先於關前木橋左右，伏下軍士，裝起武侯所遺十矢連弩；比及許儀兵來搶關時，一聲梆子響處，矢石如雨。儀急退時，早射倒數十騎。魏兵大敗。儀回報鍾會。會自提帳下甲士百餘騎來看，果然箭弩一齊射下。會撥馬便回，關上盧遜引五百軍殺下來。會拍馬過橋，橋上土塌，陷住馬蹄，爭些兒掀下馬來。馬掙不起，會棄馬步行：跑下橋時，盧遜趕上，一鎗刺來——却被魏兵中荀愷回身一箭，射盧遜落馬。鍾會麾衆乘勢搶關，關上軍士因有蜀兵在關前，不敢放箭。被鍾會殺散，奪了山關。卽以荀愷為護軍，以全副鞍馬鎧甲賜之。會喚許儀至帳下，責之曰：“汝為先鋒，理合逢山開路，遇水疊橋，專一修理橋梁道路，以便行軍。吾方纔到橋上，陷住馬蹄，幾乎墮橋；若非荀愷，吾已被殺矣！汝旣違軍令，當按軍法！”叱左右推出斬之。諸將告曰：“其父許褚有功於朝廷，望都督恕之。”會怒曰：“軍法不明，何以令衆？”遂令斬首示衆。諸將無不駭然。,"But he said that Zhong would meet the army and look forward to Hanzhong. Xu Yi, the vanguard of the former army, wanted to make a great contribution and lead the troops to Nanzheng Pass first. Yi said the generals said: ""I have passed this pass in Hanzhong. There are not many people and horses at the pass, and we can fight hard to grab the pass."" The generals took orders and marched forward together. It turned out that Lu Xun, the general who was guarding the pass, knew that the Wei soldiers were coming, so he stood around the wooden bridge in front of the pass, put down the sergeant, and equipped the ten arrow crossbow left by the Marquis Wu. , arrows and stones are like rain. When Yi was in a hurry to retreat, he shot down dozens of horses early. Wei Bing was defeated. The instrument will report back to the clock meeting. Will see from the more than a hundred cavalry soldiers under the tent, and sure enough, arrows and crossbows are fired in salvo. If he would call his horse, he would return, and shut Lu Xun and lead five hundred troops to kill him. Will beat the horse to cross the bridge, the soil on the bridge collapses, the horse's hoof is trapped, and the horse is thrown off. The horse could not afford it, so he would abandon the horse and walk: when he ran down the bridge, Lu Xun caught up and stabbed him with a shot—but Xun Kai, a Wei soldier, turned around and shot Lu Xun off the horse. Zhong Hui and his congregation took advantage of the situation to grab the pass, but the sergeant at the gate did not dare to shoot arrows because there were Shu soldiers in front of the pass. He was killed and scattered by Zhong Hui and took Shanguan.卽 took Xun Kai as his guard and gave him a full set of pommel and horse armor. The meeting called Xu Yi to the tent, and charged him, ""You are the vanguard. You are the vanguard, and you will open the way when you meet the mountains, and build bridges when you meet the water. You will repair the bridges and roads so that you can march. I just got to the bridge and got caught in a horse's hoof and almost fell off the bridge. If it wasn't for Xun Kai, I have already been killed! You have violated the military order, and you should follow the military law!"" He pushed around and cut him off. The generals told him, ""His father Xu Chu has made great contributions to the imperial court, and I hope the governor will forgive him."" The generals were all astonished.","The second ruler is completely fooled by her performance, and as a result Huang Hao is able to ensure he ignores all the letters from Jiang Wei.","Meanwhile Zhong Hui was hastening toward Hanzhong. The Van-Leader Xu Yi was anxious to perform some startling exploit, and so he led his force to Nanzheng. He said to his officers, “If we can take this pass, then we can march directly into Hanzhong; the defense is weak.” A dash was made for the fort, each one vying with the rest to be first. But the commander of Nanzheng was Lu Xun, and he had had early information of the coming of his enemies. So on both sides of the bridge he posted soldiers armed with multiple bows and crossbows. As soon as the attacking force appeared, the signal was given by a clapper and a terrific discharge of arrows and bolts opened. Many troops of Wei fell, and the army of Xu Yi was defeated. Xu Yi returned and reported his misfortune. Zhong Hui himself went with a hundred armored horsemen to see the conditions. Again the machine bows let fly clouds of missiles, and Zhong Hui turned to flee. But Lu Xun led out five hundred troops to pursue; and as Zhong Hui crossed the bridge at a gallop, the roadway gave, and his horse's hoof went through so that he was nearly thrown. The horse could not free its hoof, and Zhong Hui slipped from his back and fled on foot. As he ran down the slope of the bridge, Lu Xun came at him with a spear, but one of Zhong Hui's followers, Xun Kai by name, shot an arrow at Lu Xun and brought him to the earth. Seeing this lucky hit, Zhong Hui turned back and signaled to his force to make an attack. They came on with a dash, the defenders were afraid to shoot, as their own troops were mingled with the enemy, and soon Zhong Hui crushed the defense and possessed the pass. The defenders scattered. The pass being captured, Xun Kai was well rewarded for the shot that had saved his general's life. He was promoted to the guards and received presents of a horse and a suit of armor. Xu Yi was called to the tent, and Zhong Hui blamed him for the lack of care in his task, saying, “You were appointed Leader of the Van to see that the roads were put in repair, and your special duty was to see that the bridges were in good condition. Yet on the bridge just now my horse's hoof was caught, and I nearly fell. Happily Xun Kai was by, or I had been slain. You have been disobedient and must bear the penalty.” The delinquent was sentenced to death. The other generals tried to beg him off, pleading, “His father is Xu Chu who had rendered good services to the state.” “How can discipline be maintained if the laws are not enforced?” said Zhong Hui. The sentence was carried out, and the unhappy Xu Yi's head was exposed as a warning. This severity put fear into the hearts of the officers."

忽然西北角上一彪軍殺入，艾見是魏兵，遂乘勢殺出——救鄧艾者，乃司馬望也。比及救出鄧艾時，祁山九寨，皆被蜀兵所奪。艾引敗兵，退於渭水南下寨。艾謂望曰：“公何以知此陣法而救出我也？”望曰：“吾幼年游學於荊南，曾與崔州平、石廣元為友，講論此陣。今日姜維所變者，乃‘長蛇捲地陣’也。若他處擊之，必不可破。吾見其頭在西北，故從西北擊之，自破矣。”艾謝曰：“我雖學得陣法，實不知變法。公旣知此法，來日以此法復奪祁山寨柵，如何？”望曰：“我之所學，恐瞞不過姜維。”艾曰：“來日公在陣上與他鬥陣法，我却引一軍暗襲祁山之後。兩下混戰，可奪舊寨也。”於是令鄭倫為先鋒，艾自引軍襲山後；一面令人下戰書，搦姜維來日鬥陣法。維批回去訖，乃謂衆將曰：“吾受武侯所傳密書，此陣變法，共三百六十五樣，按周天之數。今搦吾鬥陣法，乃‘班門弄斧’耳！但中間必有詐謀，公等知之乎？”廖化曰：“此必賺我鬥陣法，却引一軍襲我後也。”維笑曰：“正合我意。”卽令張翼、廖化引一萬兵去山後埋伏。,"Suddenly, a Biao army rushed in from the northwest corner, and Ai saw that it was a Wei soldier, so he took advantage of the situation and rushed out—the one who rescued Deng Ai was Sima Wang. When Deng Ai was rescued, Qishan and Jiuzhai were all captured by Shu soldiers. Ai Yin defeated the soldiers and retreated to the south of the Wei River. Ai said to Wang, ""Why did you know this formation and rescue me?"" Wang said, ""I traveled to Jingnan when I was young, and I was friends with Cui Zhouping and Shi Guangyuan, and talked about this formation. What Jiang Wei has changed today is the The 'Long Snake Rolls the Ground' also. If he hits it, it will not be broken. I see its head is in the northwest, so I hit it from the northwest, and it will break itself."" Ai Xie said: ""Although I have learned the formation method, I really don't know. Change the law. Gong Yan knows this method, how about this method to retake Qishan Zhaizhai in the future?"" Wang said, ""I'm afraid I won't be able to hide from Jiang Wei."" Fight formation method, but I lead an army to attack Qishan secretly. After two melee battles, the old village can be seized."" So Zheng Lun was in the vanguard, Ai Zi led the army to attack the mountain; array. When Wei Pai came back, he told the generals, ""I received a secret book from Marquis Wu, and there are a total of three hundred and sixty-five variations in this formation, according to the number of days in the week. Today, when I try to fight my battle formation, it is the ears of 'Banmen's axe'! There must be a conspiracy in the middle, do you know about it?"" Liao Hua said: ""This will definitely win me the battle formation, but it will lead an army to attack me later."" Wei smiled and said, ""It is exactly what I want."" Zhang Yi and Liao Hua were ordered. Lead 10,000 soldiers to ambush behind the mountain.","However, Sima Wang tells Deng Ai that he too knows these strategies, and so the next battle is as much a battle of wits, magic and strange powers between Sima Wang and Jiang Wei as one of force.","Suddenly from the northwest a cohort dashed in. To Deng Ai's great joy they were soldiers of Wei, and they forced over the battle array and released him. The leader was Sima Wang. But although Deng Ai had been rescued, his nine camps were seized by his enemy and he had to retire. He led his army to the south of River Wei and made a camp. “How did you know exactly where to strike in that maze?” asked Deng Ai of his rescuer. Sima Wang replied, “In my youth I studied tactics and was friendly with Shi Guangyuan and Cui Zhouping. They explained that formation to me. Jiang Wei used what is known as 'The Serpent Coil,' and the only way to break it is to attack the head, which I saw was in the northwest.” Deng Ai replied, “Although I have studied formations, I do not know all the modifications. But since you know about this, we may be able to recover our camps.” “I fear the little I have learned will not be enough to overcome Jiang Wei.” “Tomorrow you shall contend with him, and while his attention is engaged, I will attack the rear of Qishan, and we will recover our camps.” So a force was prepared to attack on the morrow, and Deng Ai sent a letter of challenge to a contest in tactics for the same day. Jiang Wei marked in to accept. Jiang Wei said to his officers, “In the secret book that I received from the Prime Minister, the variations of the formation are three hundred and sixty-five, corresponding to the circuit of the heavens. This challenge from them is as one going to teach hewing to the God of Carpenters. I think some ruse lies behind this. Can you guess what it is?” Liao Hua replied, “While they engage your attention in this competition, they intend to attack our rear.” “Just so; that is my opinion,” replied Jiang Wei. So he prepared a counter-stroke by sending Liao Hua and Zhang Yi to lie in wait at the back of the hills with ten thousand troops."

The ministers and others must not be neglected, so as to let down my expectations."" He also instructed Zhao Yun, ""I and the minister will follow each other in times of adversity. Today, I don’t want to be separated here. You can think of my old friends, look at my son sooner or later, and don’t take my word for it.” Yun Qi said: “I dare not to be ineffective!” All the officials, I can’t tell you one by one, but I wish all of you love yourself.” After speaking, he passed away at the age of sixty-three: on April 24th, the third year of Zhangwu’s reign. There is a poem in the post-Du Gong Department saying:","Calling all his officials to him, he says the same thing to them, commanding them to support Kong Ming. Turning to his old comrade in arms Zhao Zilong, he says, ‘We’ve survived a lot, you and I. I didn’t think it would end like this. For the sake of our friendship, watch over my sons and honour what I have asked.’ Zhao Zilong, weeping, promises to do exactly that. Finally, he turns to all those assembled there and says, ‘There are too many of you for me to speak personally to each of you, but I wish you all well. Look after yourselves and ensure you act in full accord with that which is best in you.’ He never speaks again. He is sixty-three years old when he dies in the spring of AD 223. Du Fu wrote this poem in his honour:","Turning to the assembled officers, the First Ruler said, “As you have seen, I have confided my orphan son to the care of the Prime Minister and bidden my sons treat him as a father. You too, Sirs, are to treat him with deference. This is my dying request and charge to you.” Turning to Zhao Yun, he said, “You and I have gone together through many dangers and difficulties. Now comes the parting of our ways. You will not forget our old friendship, and you must see to it that my sons follow my precepts.” “I shall never dare to give other than my best,” said Zhao Yun. “The fidelity of the dog and horse is mine to give and shall be theirs.” Then the First Ruler turned to the others, “Noble Sirs, I am unable to speak to you one by one and lay a charge upon each individual; but I say to you: Maintain your self-respect.” These were his last words. He was sixty-three, and he died on the twenty-fourth day of the fourth month (AD 222). A poem was written by Du Fu on his death:"
且說崔禹正行之間，忽見火起，急催兵前進。剛纔轉過山來，忽山谷鼓聲大震：左邊關興，右邊張苞，兩路夾攻。崔禹大驚，方欲奔走，正遇張苞；交馬只一合，被苞生擒而回。朱然聽知危急，將船往下水退五六十里去了。孫桓引敗軍逃走，問部將曰：“前去何處城堅糧廣？”部將曰：“此去正北彝陵城，可以屯兵。”桓引敗軍急望彝陵而走。方進得城，吳班等追至，將城四面圍定。關興、張苞等解崔禹到秭歸來。先主大喜，傳旨將崔禹斬却，大賞三軍。自此威風震動，江南諸將，無不膽寒。,"Let's say that while Cui Yu was walking, he suddenly saw a fire and hurriedly urged his troops to advance. I was just turning around the mountain, and suddenly the valley was beating loudly: Guan Xing on the left, Zhang Bao on the right, both sides attacked. Cui Yu was startled, Fang Yu was about to run, but he met Zhang Bao; he crossed the horse and was captured by Bao and returned. Zhu Ran heard the danger, and set the boat back fifty or sixty miles into the water. Sun Huan led the defeated army to flee, and asked his general, ""Where are you going to go to the city where you will have plenty of food?"" Fang entered the city, Wu Ban and the others chased after him and surrounded the city on all sides. Guan Xing, Zhang Bao and others resolved Cui Yu to return to Zi. The First Sovereign was overjoyed, and passed an decree to behead Cui Yu and reward the three armies. Since then, the prestige has shaken, and all the generals in the south of the Yangtze River have been terrified.","Not only does Wu Ban successfully sack the camps but Zhang Bao and Guan Xing trap Cui Yu, whom Zhu Ran sent to relieve the camps. Sun Huan only just escapes with his life and flees to the fortified town of Yiling. Soon he is surrounded and when the first ruler executes Cui Yu, fear spreads throughout the south.","Cui Yu saw the flames as he marched and pressed on. Then just as he was passing some hills, he came upon the ambush, and Guan Xing and Zhang Bao poured out from left and right. Taken by surprise, Cui Yu could only try to flee, but he met Zhang Bao, who made him prisoner. When Zhu Ran heard the news, he was panic-stricken and dropped down-river twenty miles. The remnant of Sun Huan's troops ran away, following their leader. As they went, Sun Huan inquired, “Is there any city ahead that has good defense and granary?” They told him, saying, “To the north is Yiling, where we can camp.” So they went thither. Just as they reached the wall, their pursuers came up and the city was besieged in all four sides. Guan Xing and Zhang Bao brought the captive Cui Yu back to Zigui and saw the First Ruler, who rejoiced at their success. The prisoner was put to death, and the soldiers were rewarded. The effect of these victories spread far, so that the leaders in Wu had no inclination to fight."

褘曰：“我有心腹二人，與操賊有殺父之讎，見居城外，可用為羽翼。”耿紀問是何人。褘曰：“太醫吉平之子：長名吉邈，字文然；次名吉穆，字思然。操昔日為董承衣帶詔事，曾殺其父。二子逃竄遠鄕，得免於難。今已潛歸許都。若使相助討賊，無有不從。”耿紀、韋晃大喜。金褘卽使人密喚二吉。須臾，二人至。褘具言其事。二人感憤流淚，怨氣沖天，誓殺國賊。金褘曰：“正月十五日夜間，城中大張燈火，慶賞元宵。耿少府、韋司直：你二人各領家僮，殺至王必營前；只看營中火起，分兩路殺入；殺了王必，逕跟我入內，請天子登五鳳樓，召百官面諭討賊。吉文然兄弟於城外殺入，放火為號，各要揚聲，叫百姓誅殺國賊，截住城內救軍；待天子降詔，招安已定，便進兵殺投鄴郡擒曹操，卽發使齎詔召劉皇叔。今日約定，至期二更舉事，勿似董承自取其禍。”五人對天說誓，歃血為盟，各自歸家，整頓軍馬器械，臨期而行。,"He said, ""I have two confidants, and a thief with whom I want to kill my father. Seeing that they live outside the city, they can be used as wings."" Geng Ji asked who they were. He said: ""The son of the imperial physician Ji Ping: the first name is Ji Miao, the style is Wen Ran; the second name is Ji Mu, the style is Si Ran. Cao used to be an edict for Dong Chengyi and killed his father. The two sons escaped and escaped from trouble. . Now I have sneaked back to Xudu. If you can help each other to fight the thieves, there is nothing you can't do."" Geng Ji and Wei Huang were overjoyed. The golden clasp made a secret call for Erji. After a while, the two of them arrived. Clarity speaks volumes. The two were angry and weeping, and their grievances were soaring to the sky, and they vowed to kill the thieves of the country. Jin Bang said: ""On the night of the fifteenth day of the first lunar month, the city lights up to celebrate the Lantern Festival. Geng Shaofu and Wei Sizhi: You two lead the children and kill them before Wang Bi's camp. Just watch the fire in the camp and kill them in two ways. Enter; kill Wang Bi, go in with me, ask the emperor to climb the Wufeng Tower, summon hundreds of officials to face the thieves. Brother Ji Wenran rushed in outside the city, set fire to the horn, and raised their voices to tell the people to kill the thieves , intercepted the rescue army in the city; when the emperor surrendered the edict, and the recruitment had been decided, he would attack the army and go to Ye County to capture Cao Cao, and then sent an envoy to summon Liu Huangshu. It is agreed today that the second shift will be done on the due date, not like Dong Cheng taking it by himself. Disaster."" The five of them swore an oath to the sky, made an alliance with blood, and returned home, rectified the military and horse equipment, and left for the due date.","They also recruit two others, sons of the imperial physician Ji Ping, whom Cao Cao had murdered years before. The two boys escaped but then secretly returned to the city. They plan their attack for the night of the fifteenth day of the first month. This is the day for the annual lantern festival, which reflects and honours the first full moon of the new year. To start the attack, Geng Ji and Wei Huang will bring their armed staff to where Wang Bi has his camp for the Royal Guard. The instant they see fires in that camp they are to charge in. Once Wang Bi has died, they are to go directly with Jin Yi to the palace, where Jin Yi will ask the emperor to climb up into the Tower of Five Phoenixes, from where he will order the capture of Cao Cao. Meanwhile, the two sons of Ji will break into the city and start fires all over the place as a signal. They will then summon the ordinary, decent folk of the city to rise up, seize all traitors and defend the city against any counter-attack. Once the emperor has given his command for traitors to be seized, they will attack Yejun and capture Cao Cao, simultaneously calling on Xuande to come to the rescue of the imperial family.","“And I have two friends outside of the city who will go with us,” said Jin Yi. “Both of them have the murder of a father to avenge. We can get their helps.” “Who are they?” “They are sons of the great physician Ji Ping and are called Ji Mao and Ji Mu. Cao Cao put their father to death for his connection with the plot organized by Dong Cheng, when Dong Cheng received the secret edict conveyed in the robe and girdle, which was conferred upon him by the Emperor. The two sons escaped that time by flight, but they have since secretly returned to the capital. With their help all will go well.” Geng Ji and Wei Huang rejoiced at the prospect of further help, and a messenger was sent to call in the two Reilly brothers. Soon they arrived, and the plot was laid before them. They were deeply affected and shed copious tears. Their wrath rose to the sky and they swore to aid in the destruction of the rebel. “On the fifteenth day of the first month there will be grand illuminations in the city,” said Jin Yi, “and felicitations will continue on every side. Geng Ji and Wei Huang will each lead out their retainers and make their way quickly to Wang Bi's camp to wait till they see the fire begin. Then they will dash in, slay Wang Bi, and follow me inside the Palace. We will then request the Emperor to ascend the Tower of the Five Phoenixes, assemble his officers, and issue orders to destroy the rebels. The two Reilly brothers will make their way into the city and set fires going. Then all will raise their voices and summon the populace to their aid. They are to hold up any rescue force in the city till the Emperor has issued the edict and disturbance is allayed, when they will rush toward Yejun and seize Cao Cao. Then a messenger will be dispatched with a summons for Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle. We will begin our work that night at the second watch, and we will escape the ill success that attended Dong Cheng's attempt.” All five swore before Heaven to be true, and they smeared their lips with blood in earnest of their oath. After this, each returned to his own home to prepare arms and call up their people."
一日，羊祜引諸將打獵，正值陸抗亦出獵。羊祜下令：“我軍不許過界。”衆將得令，止於晉地打圍，不犯吳境。陸抗望見，歎曰：“羊將軍有紀律，不可犯也。”日晚各退。祜歸至軍中，察問所得禽獸，被吳人先射傷者皆送還。吳人皆悅，來報陸抗。抗召來人入，問曰：“汝主帥能飲酒否？”來人答曰：“必得佳釀，則飲之。”抗笑曰：“吾有斗酒，藏之久矣。今付與汝持去，拜上都督。此酒陸某親釀自飲者，特奉一勺，以表昨日出獵之情。”來人領諾，攜酒而去。左右問抗曰：“將軍以酒與彼，有何主意？”抗曰：“彼旣施德於我，我豈得無以酬之？”衆皆愕然。,"One day, Yang Hu invited his generals to hunt, just as Lu Kang also went hunting. Yang Hu ordered: ""Our army is not allowed to cross the border."" When Lu Kang saw this, he sighed and said, ""General Yang has discipline and must not offend."" They all retreated at night. When Hu returned to the army, he questioned the animals and animals he had obtained, and all those who were shot and wounded by the Wu people were returned. Everyone in Wu was happy and came to report to Lu Kang. Kang summoned someone to enter and asked, ""Can your commander drink alcohol?"" The visitor replied, ""You will surely get a good wine, so you can drink it."" Kang laughed and said, ""I have a fighting wine, which I have kept for a long time. I will give it to you now. Go, pay homage to the Governor. This wine Lu Mou personally brewed and drank a spoonful of it, to express the feeling of hunting yesterday."" The person who came took the promise and left with the wine. The left and right asked Kang, ""What's the general's idea for giving him wine?"" Kang said, ""He's doing me good, how can I not be rewarded?"" Everyone was stunned.","Over time Yang Hu and Lu Kang become real friends. They exchange gifts of meat and wine; on one occasion, hearing Lu Kang has been ill, Yang Hu sends his own special potion and physician to cure him.","One day Yang Hu and his officers went out to hunt, and it happened that Lu Kang had chosen the same day to hunt. Yang Hu gave strict orders not to cross the boundary, and so each hunted only on his own side. Lu Kang was astonished at the enemy's scrupulous propriety. He sighed, “The soldiers of Yang Hu have so high a discipline that I may not make any invasion now.” In the evening, after both parties had returned, Yang Hu ordered an inspection of the slaughtered game and sent over to the other side any that seemed to have been first struck by the soldiers of Wu. Lu Kang was greatly pleased and sent for the bearers of the game. “Does your leader drink wine?” asked he. They replied, “Only fine wines does he drink.” “I have some very old wine,” replied Lu Kang, smiling, “and I will give of it to you to bear to your general as a gift. It is the wine I myself brew and drink on ceremonial occasions, and he shall have half in return for today's courtesy.” They took the wine and left. “Why do you give him wine?” asked Lu Kang's officers."

且說孔明大勝，所得器械、馬匹，不計其數，乃引大軍回寨。每日令魏延挑戰，魏兵不出。一連半月，不曾交兵。孔明正在帳中思慮，忽報天子遣侍中費禕齎詔至。孔明接入營中，焚香禮畢，開詔讀曰：,"Moreover, when Kongming won a great victory, he obtained countless weapons and horses, and he led the army back to the village. Wei Yan was challenged every day, but Wei Bing did not go out. For a month and a half, they never fought. Kong Ming was thinking about it in the tent, and suddenly reported that the emperor sent the middle servant Fei Yijie to arrive. Kong Ming entered the camp, and after burning the incense, he issued an edict and read:","Sima Yi sends a relief force to aid the besieged towns of Wudu and Yinping, only for that force to discover that Kong Ming has taken the two towns and that they are trapped between different groups of Shu troops.","Thus a great victory fell to Shu, and their booty was immense; weapons and horses innumerable. Zhuge Liang led his army back to camp. Thereafter he sent parties to offer a challenge at the gate of the Wei camp every day, but the soldiers remained obstinately behind their shelters and would not appear. When this had continued half a month Zhuge Liang grew sad. Then came Fei Yi from Capital Chengdu with an edict of the Emperor. Fei Yi was received with all respect, and incense was burnt as propriety demanded. This done, the command was unsealed, and Zhuge Liang read:"
却說曹眞正在寨中憂悶，忽報左將軍張郃領軍到。郃下馬入帳，謂眞曰：“某奉聖旨，特來聽調。”眞曰：“曾別仲達否？”郃曰：“仲達分付云：‘吾軍勝，蜀兵必不便去；若吾軍敗，蜀兵必卽去矣。’今吾軍失利之後，都督曾往哨探蜀兵消息否？”眞曰：“未也。”於是卽令人往探之，果是虛營，只插着數十面旌旗，兵已去了二日也。曹眞懊悔無及。,"But he said that Cao Zhen was in the middle of the village and was depressed, and suddenly reported that the left general Zhang He was leading the army. He dismounted from his horse and entered the tent, and said to Zhen, ""Someone has come to hear the decree."" Zhen said, ""Have you ever bid farewell to Zhongda?"" If my army is defeated, the soldiers of Shu will be gone. 'After our army's defeat, did the governor ever go to the sentry to check the news of the soldiers of Shu?"" Zhen said, ""Not yet."" , with only dozens of flags planted, and the soldiers have been gone for two days. Cao Zhen felt regretful.",Sima Yi also foresees that Sun Quan is on the verge of declaring himself an emperor and that he will then attack the north. Therefore he is holding back his army ready to attack Lu Xun when he crosses the border from the south. So Cao Zhen is told to refrain from any engagements.,"Zhang He came up to the gate, dismounted, and entered. When he saw Cao Zhen, he said, “I have received a royal command to come and to be into your arrangements.” “Did you take leave of friend Sima Yi?” asked Cao Zhen. Zhang He said, “His instructions to me were to stay away if you were victor, to come if you were not. It seems that our side has missed success. Have you since found out what the troops of Shu are doing?” “Not yet.” So Cao Zhen sent out some scouts, and they found empty camps. There were flags flying, but the army had been gone two days. Cao Zhen was disgusted."

操觀畢大笑，出示羣臣曰：“是兒欲使吾居爐火上耶！”侍中陳羣等奏曰：“漢室久已衰微，殿下功德巍巍，生靈仰望。今孫權稱臣歸命，此天人之應，異氣齊聲。殿下宜應天順人，早正大位。”操笑曰：“吾事漢多年，雖有功德及民，然位至於王，名爵已極，何敢更有他望？苟天命在孤，孤為周文王矣。”司馬懿曰：“今孫權旣稱臣歸附，王上可封官賜爵，令拒劉備。”操從之，表封孫權為驃騎將軍南昌侯，領荊州牧。卽日遣使齎誥勅赴東吳去訖。,"Cao Guanbi laughed, showed his ministers and said, ""You want to make me live on the fire!"" Chen Qun and others in the waiter said: ""The Han Dynasty has been declining for a long time. , this is the response of heaven and man, and the voice is different. Your Highness should respond to heaven and obey people, and take the throne as soon as possible."" Cao laughed and said, ""I have been in the Han for many years, and although I have merit and virtue to the people, as for the king, the name is already extremely high, why? Dare to have more hope? Gou Tianming is in the loneliness, and the loneliness is King Wen of Zhou."" Sima Yi said, ""Today Sun Quanyan has declared himself a subject, and the king can grant him an official title, and order him to reject Liu Bei."" General Nanchang Hou, led Jingzhou animal husbandry. On the next day, he sent an envoy to the Eastern Wu Dynasty.","Cao Cao laughs aloud at the presumption and pomposity of the letter and is all for dismissing it. But others add their voices, saying the Han rule is clearly at an end and that, ‘with your being so renowned for virtue, everyone looks to you. Sun Quan’s letter just confirms that all are awaiting your decision – all the signs point towards this. Be at one with the Will of Heaven and with what the people want.’ ‘I’ve been a loyal servant of the Han for years and through this the people have benefited,’ reflects Cao Cao. ‘Being made king of Wei was enough for me, but if the Mandate of Heaven is to come to me, then I must become like rulers of old such as King Wen of the Zhou.’20","Cao Cao laughed as he read this, and he said to his officers, “Is this youth trying to put me on a furnace?” But Minister Chen Qun and the attendants seriously replied, “O Prince, the Hans have been feeble too long, while your virtues and merits are like the mountains. All the people look to you, and when Sun Quan acknowledged himself as your minister, he is but responsive to the will of God and the desire of humans. It is wrong that you oppose when such contrary influences work to a common end, and you must soon ascend to the high place.” Cao Cao smiled. “I have served the Hans for many years; and if I have acquired some merit, yet I have been rewarded with a princedom and high rank. I dare not aspire to greater things. If the finger of heaven points to me, then shall I be as King Wen of Zhou.” “As Sun Quan acknowledges himself your servant and promises obedience, you, my lord, can confer a title upon him and assign to him the duty of attacking Liu Bei,” said Sima Yi. Approving of the suggestion, Cao Cao gave Sun Quan the titles of General of the Flying Cavalry and Lord of Nanzhang, and appointed him to the Imperial Protectorship of Jingzhou. Forthwith this command was sent away to Sun Quan."

Han Dang and Zhou Tai were startled and hurriedly played the King of Wu, stating that Mi Fang and Fu Shiren killed Ma Zhong and returned to the Emperor of Shu, but were also killed by the Emperor of Shu. Sun Quan was timid, so he gathered in the civil and military to discuss. Bu Li played and said: ""The people who are hated by the Lord of Shu are: Lü Meng, Pan Zhang, Ma Zhong, Mi Fang, and Fu Shiren. Now all these people are dead, only Fan Jiang and Zhang Da are the only two, now Soochow. Why not capture them? The two, together with Zhang Fei's head, sent the envoy back, handed it over to Jingzhou, sent it back to the wife, made a table to ask for peace, reunited with the previous situation, and jointly planned to destroy Wei, then the troops of Shu will retreat."" Quan followed his words and agreed. The wooden box of agarwood contained the flying heads, bound Fan Jiang and Zhang Da, and imprisoned them in the chariot.","‘We will conquer the south,’ declares the first ruler, ‘and once we have killed all those dogs we will hunt down the two murderers, and you too will be able to cut them into pieces as a sacrifice to your father.’ So great is the fear created by the first ruler that Sun Quan is desperate to appease him. Therefore, he has the two murderers of Zhang Fei captured. He sends them, along with the head of Zhang Fei itself, with his ambassador, Cheng Bing, to the camp of the first ruler.","About this time the fear of the First Ruler was very great among the people of the South Land, who stood in dread of him so that they grieved night and day. Han Dang and Zhou Tai were rather frightened too, and they sent a report to their master of the assassination of Ma Zhong and what had befallen the assassins. Then Sun Quan was distressed and called together his counselors. At this meeting Bu Zhi proposed submission and self-humiliation for the sake of peace. Said he, “There were five persons—Lu Meng, Pan Zhang, Ma Zhong, Mi Fang, and Fu Shiren—whom Liu Bei had a grudge against, and they are all dead. Now the objects of his hate are the murderers of Zhang Fei—Fan Jiang and Zhang Da. Why not send back Zhang Fei's head, and these two assassins, and give up Jingzhou and restore Lady Sun and ask for peace and alliance against Wei? This will make the army of Shu retire, and we shall have peace.” This proposal seemed good. So the head of Zhang Fei was enclosed in a sandalwood box; Fan Jiang and Zhang Da were bound and put in a cage-cart."
孔明入南安，招諭軍民，秋毫無犯。衆將各各獻功。孔明將夏侯楙囚於車中。鄧芝問曰：“丞相何故知崔諒詐也？”孔明曰：“吾已知此人無降心，故意使入城。彼必盡情告與夏侯楙，欲將計就計而行。吾見來情，足知其詐，復使二將同去，以穩其心。此人若有眞心，必然阻當；彼忻然同去者，恐吾疑也。他意中度二將同去，賺入城內殺之未遲；又令吾軍有託，放心而進。吾已暗囑二將，就城門下圖之。城內必無準備，吾軍隨後便到：此出其不意也。”衆將拜服。孔明曰：“賺崔諒者，吾使心腹人詐作魏將裴緒也。吾又去賺天水郡，至今未到，不知何故。今可乘勢取之。”乃留吳懿守南安，劉琰守安定，替出魏延軍馬去取天水郡。,"Kong Ming entered Nan'an and enlisted the military and civilians, but Qiu did not commit any crimes. Everyone will contribute. Kong Ming imprisoned Xiahou Mao in the car. Deng Zhi asked: ""Why did the prime minister know that Cui Liang was deceitful?"" Kong Ming said: ""I know that this person has no intention of surrendering and deliberately sent him into the city. He will tell Xiahou Mao to the fullest, and if he wants to make a plan, he will do it. I see the situation and I know it well. If he is deceitful, he will send the two generals to go together to stabilize his heart. If this person has a sincere heart, he will definitely block it; if he goes with him, I am afraid that I will be suspicious. It was not too late; I also ordered my army to have a trust, so I could enter with confidence. I have secretly instructed the two generals, and I will take a picture of the city gate. There must be no preparations in the city, and our army will arrive later: this is unexpected."" The generals bowed. Kong Ming said: ""If you earn Cui Liang, I will make my confidant deceive Pei Xu, a Wei general. I will go to earn Tianshui County again, but I haven't arrived yet. I don't know why. Now I can take advantage of the situation to take it."" Settle down, replace Wei Yan's army and go to take Tianshui County.","Now Kong Ming enters the city, and his men behave so well this reassures the people. Kong Ming goes out of his way to reinforce this message that all will be well. He had of course guessed that Cui Liang never meant to cooperate and so had plotted and set his own trap instead. But while Nan’an and Anding have now fallen to Kong Ming, nothing has been heard from Tianshui. So Wei Yan is sent to take that city.","Zhuge Liang entered the city and at once forbade all plunder. The various generals reported the deeds of valor. The captive Commander-in-Chief was placed in a prisoner's cart. Then Deng Zhi asked, “O Minister, how did you know the treachery of Cui Liang?” “I knew the man was unwilling in his heart to yield, so I sent him into the city that he might have a chance to weave a counter plot with Xiahou Mao. I saw by his manner he was treacherous, and so I sent my two trusty generals with him to give him a feeling of security. Had he been true to me, he would have opposed this; but he accepted it gaily and went with them lest I should suspect him. He thought they could slay my two leaders and entice me in. But my two leaders already had orders what to do. Everything turned out as I thought, and as they did not expect.” The officers bowed their appreciation of his wonderful insight. Then Zhuge Liang said, “I sent one of my trusty people to pretend he was a certain Pei Xu of Wei and so deceive this Cui Liang. I also sent another to Tianshui to do the same, but nothing has happened yet; I do not know the reason.

先帝慮漢、賊不兩立，王業不偏安，故託臣以討賊也。以先帝之明，量臣之才，故知臣伐賊，才弱敵強也。然不伐賊，王業亦亡。惟坐而待亡，孰與伐之？是故託臣而弗疑也。臣受命之日，寢不安席，食不甘味；思惟北征，宜先入南：故五月渡瀘，深入不毛，并日而食——臣非不自惜也：顧王業不可偏安於蜀都，故冒危難以奉先帝之遺意。而議者謂為非計。今賊適疲於西，又務於東，兵法乘勞：此進趨之時也。謹陳其事如左：,"The first emperor was concerned that the Han and the thieves would not be at odds with each other, and the king's industry was not partial to peace, so he entrusted the ministers to punish the thieves. With the knowledge of the first emperor and the talent of the ministers, it is only the weak and the strong that know the ministers to cut down the thieves. However, if you do not cut down the thieves, the king's industry will also perish. Only sitting and waiting to die, who is better than cutting it? This is why he trusts the ministers without doubting them. On the day when the minister was appointed, he could not sleep well and eat unpleasantly; thinking about the northern expedition, it is advisable to enter the south first: Therefore, when crossing Lu in the fifth month, it is not hairy, and it is eaten every day. Therefore, it is difficult to take risks and honor the will of the late emperor. And those who argue are called non-calculations. Today, the thieves are tired in the west, and they are in the east, and the art of war takes advantage of the labor: this is the time to advance. I would like to state that the things are as follows:","Shortly afterwards Kong Ming petitions the second ruler for permission to continue the war against the north, to fulfil the mandate the first ruler gave to him before his death. In fulsome terms Kong Ming describes his war in the south and how now there is the need to strike the north.","“The First Ruler was anxious lest the rebels should set up a rival empire and the legitimate Ruler's domain be restricted. Wherefore he laid upon me, thy minister, to destroy them. Measuring my powers by his perspicacity, he knew that I should attack and oppose my talents, inadequate as they might be, to their strength, for, if I did not, the royal domain would be destroyed. It was a question whether to await destruction without effort, or to attack? Wherefore he assigned me the task confidently. Thenceforward this task occupied all my thoughts. “Considering that the south should be made secure before the north could be attacked, I braved the heat of summer and plunged deep into the wilds of the Mang nations. Sparing not myself nor regarding privation, urged by the one consideration, that the royal domain should not be confined to the capital of Shu, I faced dangers in obedience to the First Ruler's behest. But there are critics who may say that I failed. Now the rebels have been weakened in the west and have become involved in the east. The rule of war is to take advantage of the enemy's weakness, and so now is the time to attack. I shall discuss the various circumstances in order."

Suddenly the mission arrived, and Zhao Wei entered the court. Wei didn't know what to do, so he had to go back to the court. Deng Ai and Sima Wang knew of Jiang Wei's plan, so they pulled out the Weinan troops and then covered up. Exactly:","Jiang Wei has been trying to engage the Wei army, but they hold back from open confrontation. Then the summons comes ordering Jiang Wei home.","Meanwhile Jiang Wei tried every day to bring the enemy to give battle, but they remained obstinately behind their defenses. Jiang Wei began to think some evil scheme was afoot, when suddenly he was recalled by Imperial Edict. Although ignorant of the reason, he could not disobey; and when he began the retreat, Deng Ai and Sima Wang knew that their plot had succeeded."

時蜀將王含守樂城，蔣斌守漢城，見魏兵勢大，不敢出戰，只閉門自守。鍾會下令曰：“兵貴神速，不可少停。”乃令前軍李輔圍樂城，護軍荀愷圍漢城，自引大軍取陽安關。守關蜀將傅僉與副將蔣舒商議戰守之策。舒曰：“魏兵甚衆，勢不可當；不如堅守為上。”僉曰：“不然：魏兵遠來，必然疲困，雖多不足懼。我等若不下關戰時，漢、樂二城休矣。”蔣舒默然不答。忽報魏兵大隊已至關前，蔣、傅二人至關上視之。鍾會揚鞭大叫曰：“吾今統十萬之衆到此，如早早出降，各依品級陞用；如執迷不降，打破關隘，玉石俱焚！”傅僉大怒，令蔣舒把關，自引三千兵殺下關來。鍾會便走，魏兵盡退。僉乘勢追之，魏兵復合。僉欲退入關時，關上已豎起魏家旗號：只見蔣舒叫曰：“吾已降了魏也！”僉大怒，厲聲罵曰：“忘恩背義之賊，有何面目見天下乎！”撥回馬復與魏兵接戰。魏兵四面合來，將傅僉圍在垓心。僉左衝右突，往來死戰，不能得脫；所領蜀兵，十傷八九。僉乃仰天歎曰：“吾生為蜀臣，死亦當為蜀鬼！”乃復拍馬衝殺，身被數鎗，血盈袍鎧；坐下馬倒，僉自刎而死。後人有詩歎曰：,"When the Shu general Wang Han guarded Lecheng, Jiang Bin guarded Hancheng, and seeing the strength of Wei's army, he did not dare to fight, and only guarded himself behind closed doors. Zhong Hui ordered: ""The soldiers are very fast and must not stop."" He ordered Li Fu of the former army to surround the city of Le, the army of Xun Kai to surround the city of Han, and lead the army to take Yang'an Pass. Shu general Fu Yu and deputy general Jiang Shu discussed the strategy of defense. Shu said: ""Wei's troops are too numerous to be overwhelmed; it's better to stick to the top."" Yan said: ""Otherwise: if Wei's troops come from afar, they will definitely be exhausted, although they are too numerous to be afraid. The city is closed."" Jiang Shu didn't answer silently. It was suddenly reported that the Wei Brigade had reached the front of the pass, and Jiang and Fu went to the pass to look at it. Zhong Hui raised his whip and shouted, ""I am here with a group of 100,000 people. If I go out and surrender early, they will be promoted according to their grades. Shu guarded the gate and brought in three thousand soldiers to kill him. Zhong Hui left, and the Wei army retreated. Yu took advantage of the situation to pursue him, and the Wei soldiers reunited. When Yu was about to retreat and enter the pass, the flag of the Wei family was erected on the pass: I saw Jiang Shu shouting: ""I have surrendered to Wei!"" Yu was furious and scolded: ""What kind of face does an ungrateful thief see in the world? !"" Called Ma Fu back to fight with Wei Bing. The Wei soldiers came together and surrounded Fu Yi in Gaixin. The left and the right rushed, and they fought to the death, but they could not escape; the Shu soldiers under the command were wounded eighty-nine out of ten. Yan Nai looked up to the sky and sighed, ""I was born as a Shu official, and I should die as a Shu ghost!"" Then he shot the horse and rushed to kill him. A later poem sighed and said:","The second ruler is completely fooled by her performance, and as a result Huang Hao is able to ensure he ignores all the letters from Jiang Wei. And so the slippery path to the destruction of the kingdom begins.","On the side of Shu, Wang Han commanded at Yuecheng, and Jiang Bin was in Hancheng. As the enemy came in great force, they dared not go out to meet them, but stood on the defensive with the gates of the cities closed. Zhong Hui issued an order, “Speed is the soul of war; no halts.” Li Fu was ordered to lay siege to Yuecheng, and Xun Kai was to surround Hancheng. The main army under Zhong Hui would capture the Yangping Pass. The Shu General Fu Qian commanded at the pass. He discussed plans with Jiang Shu, his second in command, and Jiang Shu was wholly in favor of defense, saying, “The enemy is too strong to think of any other course.” “I do not agree,” replied Fu Qian. “They are now fatigued with marching, and we need not fear them. Unless we go out and attack, the two cities will fall.” Jiang Shu made no reply. Soon the enemy arrived, and both officers went up to the wall and looked out. As soon as Zhong Hui saw them, he shouted, “We have here a host of one hundred thousand. If you yield, you shall have higher rank than you hold now; but if you persist in holding out then, when we take the pass, you shall all perish. Jewels and pebbles will share the same destruction.” This threat angered Fu Qian. He bade Jiang Shu guard the walls, and he went down to give battle, taking three thousand troops. He attacked, and Zhong Hui retreated. Fu Qian pursued. But soon the army of Wei closed up their ranks and counterattacked. Fu Qian turned to retire; but when he reached his own defenses, he saw they flew the flags of Wei; the banners of Shu had gone. “I have yielded,” cried Jiang Shu from the ramparts. Fu Qian shouted angrily, “Ungrateful and treacherous rogue! How can you ever face the world again?” But that did no good. Fu Qian turned to go once more into the battle. He was soon surrounded. He fought desperately, but could not win clear. His troops fell one by one, and when they were reduced to one out of ten, he cried, “Alive I have been a servant of Shu; dead I will be one of their spirits!” Fu Qian forced his way into the thickest of the fight. Then his steed fell, and as he was grievously wounded, he put an end to his own life. The loyalty Fu Qian showed in stressful days"

On the one hand, he personally commanded troops into Sichuan. First allocate 10,000 elite soldiers, and send Zhang Fei's subordinates to take the road to kill Pemba Prefecture and the west of Luocheng. The first to arrive is the first. Another army was dispatched, and Zhao Yun was instructed to be the vanguard, going up the river and meeting at Luocheng. Kong Ming then led Jian Yong, Jiang Wan and others to set out. That Jiang Wan, whose word is Gongyan, is also a native of Lingling and Xiangyan: he is a famous scholar in Jingxiang, and he is now a secretary.","As they set off, Kong Ming warns Zhang Fei to ensure his troops behave in order to win the trust of the people.","Zhuge Liang also appointed tried and worthy people to assist the new commander. Guan Yu's civil staff included Ma Liang, Mi Zhu, Yi Ji, and Xiang Lang; and on military side, he was assisted by Mi Fang, Liao Hua, Guan Ping, and Zhou Cang. This done, Zhuge Liang began to prepare for his departure. Zhang Fei, with ten thousand troops, was sent to fight his way into the country west of Bazhou and Luocheng, and he was to go with all speed. The earlier he got through, the greater merit would be his. Zhao Yun was to lead a force up the Great River and make a junction at Luocheng. Zhuge Liang, with his own body of fifteen thousand troops, would follow. Among those who followed Zhuge Liang was one Jiang Wan, a noted scholar from Lingling. Jiang Wan went as Secretary."

He was shocked and said, ""I didn't expect this to happen today!"" So they gathered at Wenwu and asked about the strategy for retreating the troops. Huang Quan said: ""You can send troops to settle in Luo County overnight to block the road. Although Liu Bei has elite soldiers, he can't pass it."" To guard Luo County, to reject Liu Bei.","Not one drop of blood is spilt in the capture of the pass. When the news of the deaths of Yang Huai and Gao Pei and the fall of the Fu pass reaches Liu Zhang, he is horrified. He is especially distressed that a kinsman should have done this. Huang Quan advises him to fortify Luocheng, as this will block any further advances by the enemy. And so he sends Liu Gui, Ling Bao, Zhang Ren and Deng Xian to guard the city with fifty thousand men.","When Imperial Protector Liu Zhang heard of the doings of his relative and guest, he said, “I did not think that such things would come to pass.” The officers of Yiazhou met to consider how to oppose the further advance of Liu Bei, and Huang Quan said, “Let us send without delay a force to hold Luocheng, which is the very throat of the road he must take. He may have veteran soldiers and fiery generals, but he will not be able to pass.” So the four ablest generals—Deng Xian, Ling Bao, Liu Gui, and Zhang Ren—were told off for this duty, and they led fifty thousand troops."

Quan Wen said: ""In the past, Duke Jin of Zhou recommended Lu Zijing to replace him; later Zijing also recommended Qing to replace him; now the minister must also recommend a person who can look forward to both success and prosperity. It is wonderful to replace him."" Meng said: ""If you use someone who is highly regarded, Yunchang will definitely prepare the embankment. Lu Xun has a deep meaning, but he does not have a distant name, which is not something that Yunchang is jealous of; if you use 卽 as a substitute for a minister, it will definitely help."" Quan was overjoyed, and he worshipped him every day Lu Xun was the commander-in-chief of the right side and guarded Lukou on behalf of Meng. Xun Xie said: ""Someone is young and has no education, and he may not be able to take up his duties."" Quan said: ""Zi Ming protects the Qing, and you must not make mistakes. You must not refuse."" At the end of the year, a letter was repaired, with horses, different brocades, wine gifts, etc., and sent envoys to Fancheng to see Guan Gong.","Having agreed the plan, Lu Xun apprises Sun Quan of the plot. Sun formally summons Lü Meng back to the court ‘for health reasons’ and appoints Lu Xun to be the flattering flunkey who will fool Guan Yu.","Wherefore Lu Meng's malady waxed worse, so that he was confined to bed; and he gave Lu Xun his letter of resignation to carry back to Sun Quan. The messenger hastened back and explained the ruse to his master, who soon after issued a command for Lu Meng to retire and attend to the recovery of his health. But Lu Meng came to Sun Quan to discuss the matter of a successor. Sun Quan said to him, “As to the appointment at Lukou, you know Zhou Yu recommended Lu Su, who at his last moment proposed you. Now you ought to be able to mention some other talented and well-known officer to succeed you.” “If you choose a well-known man, Guan Yu will certainly be on his guard against him. Now Lu Xun is deep and farseeing, but he has no widespread fame. Hence no particular notice would be taken of his appointment and no countermeasures taken. So he is the most suitable person to send.” Sun Quan agreed and thereupon promoted Lu Xun to the rank of General of the Right Army and Admiral of the Right Fleet, and sent him to defend the port. “I am very young,” said Lu Xun, “and feel unequal to such a post.” “Lu Meng has proposed you, and you will not make any mistakes. Pray do not decline,” said Sun Quan. So the appointment was made, and Lu Xun set out at once."

Then said Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong, “Cao Cao is too strong, and we cannot overcome him by mere force. If the struggle continues longer, you will only lose more soldiers. You would better seek to make peace.” Sun Quan followed this advice and dispatched Bu Zhi on a peace mission to Cao Cao's camp. Sun Quan offered a yearly tribute. Cao Cao also saw that the South Land was too strong to be overcome, and consented. Cao Cao insisted, “The Marquis should first send away his army, and then I would retire.” Bu Zhi returned with this message, and Sun Quan sent away the greater part, leaving only Zhou Tai and Jiang Qin to hold Ruxu."

哨探軍見之大驚，不知是人是鬼，火速報知司馬懿。懿自出營視之：只見孔明簪冠鶴氅，手搖羽扇，端坐於四輪車上；左右二十四人，披髮仗劍；前面一人，手執皂旛，隱隱似天神一般。懿曰：“這個又是孔明作怪也！”遂撥二千人馬分付曰：“汝等疾去，連車帶人，盡情都捉來！”魏兵領命，一齊追趕。孔明見魏兵趕來，便敎回車，遙望蜀營緩緩而行。魏兵皆驟馬追趕，但見陰風習習，冷霧漫漫。儘力趕了一程，追之不上。各人大驚，都勒住馬言曰：“奇怪！我等急急趕了三十里，只見在前，追之不上。如之奈何？”孔明見兵不來，又令推車過來，朝着魏兵歇下。魏兵猶豫良久，又放馬趕來。孔明復回車慢慢而行。魏兵又趕了二十里，只見在前，不曾趕上，盡皆癡呆。孔明敎回過車，朝着魏軍，推車倒行。魏兵又欲追趕。後面司馬懿自引一軍到。傳令曰：“孔明善會八門遁甲，能驅六丁六甲之神。此乃六甲天書內‘縮地’之法也：衆軍不可追之。”衆軍方勒馬回時，左勢下戰鼓大震，一彪軍殺來。懿急令兵拒之：只見蜀兵隊裏二十四人，披髮仗劍，皂衣跣足，擁出一輛四輪車；車上端坐孔明，簪冠鶴氅，手搖羽扇。懿大驚曰：“方纔那個車上坐着孔明，趕了五十里，追之不上，這裏如何又有孔明？怪哉！怪哉！”言未畢，右勢下戰鼓又鳴，一彪軍殺來：四輪車上亦坐着一個孔明；左右亦有二十四人，皂衣跣足，披髮仗劍，擁車而來。懿心中大疑，回顧諸將曰：“此必神兵也！”衆軍心下大亂，不敢交戰，各自奔走。,"The sentry troops were shocked when they saw it, not knowing whether it was a man or a ghost, and quickly reported to Sima Yi. Yi Zi went out of the camp to see it: I saw Kongming with a hairpin, a crown, a crane, and a feather fan, sitting on a four-wheeled cart; twenty-four people on the left and right, with their hair and swords in their hair; one person in front, holding a soap banner, faintly like a god. Yi said, ""This is Kongming's fault again!"" He dispatched 2,000 men and horses to pay them off and said, ""You guys go quickly, even the chariots and people, and catch them as much as you want!"" When Kong Ming saw the Wei soldiers coming, he ordered the carriage back and watched the Shu camp slowly moving forward. The Wei soldiers all chased after them, but they saw that the wind was blowing, and the cold fog was lingering. I tried my best to catch up, but I couldn't catch up. Everyone was shocked, so they restrained Ma Yan and said, ""It's strange! I've rushed for thirty miles, but I can't catch up. What can I do?"" Stop at Wei Bing. Wei Bing hesitated for a long time, then let his horses come. Kong Mingfu returned to the car and walked slowly. Wei Bing drove another 20 li, and saw that he was in front of him, but he never caught up. Kong Ming taught him to go back to the car, towards Wei Jun, pushing the car backwards. Wei Bing wanted to chase again. Sima Yi brought in an army behind him. The order said: ""Kong Ming is good at meeting the eight-door Dunjia, which can drive out the gods of the six Dings and the six Jias. This is the method of 'shrinking the ground' in the Sixth Heavenly Book: the army cannot chase it."" There was a big earthquake under the war drum, and a Biao army came. Yi hurriedly ordered the soldiers to refuse: I saw twenty-four people in the Shu soldiers, wearing swords and soapy clothes, and holding out a four-wheeled cart. Yi was startled and said: ""Just now, Kong Ming was sitting in that car, and we drove fifty miles and couldn't catch up. How can there be Kong Ming here? Strange! Strange!"" Killing Lai: There was also a Kongming seated on the four-wheeled cart; there were also twenty-four people on the left and right, clothed in soapy clothes, and with swords in their hair, and they came with the cart. With great doubt in his heart, Yi looked back at the generals and said, ""This must be a magic weapon!""","Parading in front of the enemy, he draws two thousand men away as they chase after him. But no matter how fast they go and no matter how slowly his carriage seems to move ahead, they cannot catch him. It takes Sima Yi to recognize this as a magic trick known as the Eight Doorways. Supported by local deities summoned by Kong Ming, he has managed to create what is known as Shortening the Distance. Sima Yi knows nothing can be done to counter this magic. So he orders the retreat but, turning around, suddenly encounters Kong Ming again in his famous carriage – ahead of him. ‘How is this possible?’ asks the astonished Sima. The effect on the Wei troops is deeply demoralizing and is increased when, taking another path, they again find Kong Ming and his carriage ahead of them. Turning again, they encounter Kong Ming once more. By now the nerve of the army has been broken and in panic they flee back to their base at Shanggui to hide! Having used his identical carriages trick, Kong Ming now has the grain fields to himself, and soon thirty thousand men are reaping the abundant harvest. Only later does Sima Yi learn that, far from Kong Ming appearing four times, the others were in the charge of Jiang Wei, Ma Dai and Wei Yan.","The appearance of a chariot with such attendants more than startled the enemy's scouts, who did not know whether the apparition was that of a human or a demon. They hastened to their general and told him. Sima Yi came out himself and saw the cavalcade, and its central figure being Zhuge Liang, dressed as a Taoist mystic, with head-dress, white robe and a feather fan. Around the chariot were twenty-four hair-loosened beings, each with a sword in hand; and leading was a being as a heaven-sent god with the seven-starred flag. “Some of Zhuge Liang's odd doings,” said he. And Sima Yi ordered two thousand troops, saying, “Chase as fast as you can, and bring in the chariot, escort, and the seated figure.” The soldiers went out to do their bidding; but as soon as they appeared, the chariot retired and took a road leading to the rear of the Shu camp. Although the Wei soldiers were mounted, they could not come up with the cavalcade. What they did meet with was a chilly breeze and a cold mist that rolled about them. They found it uncanny and halted, saying one to another, “How extraordinary it is that we have been pressing on and yet we got no nearer. What does it mean?” When Zhuge Liang saw that the pursuit had ceased, he had his chariot pushed out again to the front and passed within sight of the halted troops. At first they hesitated, but presently took up the pursuit once more. Whereupon the chariot again retired, proceeding slowly, but always keeping out of reach. And thus more than seven miles were covered and the chariot was still not captured. Again the soldiers halted, puzzled and perplexed at this incomprehensible chase. But as soon as they stopped, the chariot came again toward them and they retook pursuit. Sima Yi now came up with a strong force. But he also halted, and said to his generals, “This Zhuge Liang is a master in the arts of necromancy and juggling and Eight Gates and knows how to call up the Deities of Six Layers to his aid. I know this trick of his; it is the 'Ground Rolling' in the 'Book of Six Layers Deities,' and it is vain to pursue.” So they ceased following. But then a roll of drums came from the left side as if a body of troops were approaching. Sima Yi told off some companies to repel them, but there only came into view a small force, and in their midst was a party of men dressed in black, the exact counterpart of the cavalcade he had first sent to pursue. In the chariot sat another Zhuge Liang just like the one that had just disappeared. “But just now he was sitting in that other chariot, which we chased for fifteen miles; how can he be here?” said Sima Yi. Shortly after they heard another roll of the drums, and as the sound died away there appeared another body of men, with a chariot in the midst, exactly like the last and also carrying a sitting figure of Zhuge Liang. “They must be heaven-sent soldiers,” said Sima Yi. The soldiers were now feeling the strain of these weird appearances and began to get out of hand. They dared not stay to fight such beings, and some ran away. But before they had gone far, lo!"

司馬懿見李勝去了，遂起身謂二子曰：“李勝此去，回報消息，曹爽必不忌我矣。只待他出城畋獵之時，方可圖之。”不一日，曹爽請魏主曹芳去謁高平陵，祭祀先帝。大小官僚，皆隨駕出城。爽引三弟，并心腹人何晏等，及御林軍護駕正行，司農桓範叩馬諫曰：“主公總典禁兵，不宜兄弟皆出。倘城中有變，如之奈何？”爽以鞭指而叱之曰：“誰敢為變！再勿亂言！”當日司馬懿見爽出城，心中大喜，卽起舊日手下破敵之人，并家將數十，引二子上馬，逕來謀殺曹爽。正是：,"Sima Yi saw that Li Sheng was gone, so he got up and said to the second son, ""Li Sheng is here, and report back the news. Cao Shuang will not be jealous of me. Only when he goes out to the city to hunt, can he make plans for him."" After a few days, Cao Shuang asked The head of Wei, Cao Fang, went to Ye Gaoping Mausoleum to offer sacrifices to the late emperor. Bureaucrats, big and small, all accompany them out of the city. Shuang invited his three younger brothers and his confidantes He Yan, etc., and the imperial army to escort them on their way. Si Nong Huanfan kowtowed to the horse and said, ""My lord is in charge of banning soldiers. It is not appropriate for all brothers to go out. If there is a change in the city, what should I do?"" He pointed and scolded him, ""Who dares to change! Don't talk nonsense again!"" Sima Yi was overjoyed when he saw that he was out of the city. Cao Shuang. Exactly:","As soon as Li Sheng has gone, Sima Yi rises from his bed, calls his sons to him and says, ‘When Li Sheng reports back, Cao Shuang will no longer worry about me. This means he’ll go out hunting with few precautions. That is when we strike.’ The time comes for the sacrifices to be offered by the young ruler at his father’s tomb. The whole court goes out with Cao Fang and Cao Shuang to attend the ritual. One official remonstrates, saying that this leaves the capital unattended and thus vulnerable to revolt. ‘ And who exactly would lead this? No one,’ says Cao Shuang. The ‘who’ is, of course, Sima Yi.","But no sooner had Cao Shuang gone than Sima Yi rose from his couch and said to his sons, “Li Sheng will take a full account of this to Cao Shuang, who will not fear me any more. But wait till Cao Shuang goes on his next hunting trip, and we will see what can be done.” Soon after this, Cao Shuang proposed to the Ruler of Wei, Cao Fang, to visit the Gaoping Tombs where his father lay and perform the filial sacrifices in person. So they went, a goodly company of officers in the train of the imperial chariot, and Cao Shuang with all his brothers and his friends went with the guards. Huan Fan, Minister of Agriculture, entreated him to remain in the city for fear of plots and risings. “Your Lordship are in charge of the capital security, and you and your brothers should not leave the city together. Suppose there were a revolt, what then?” But Cao Shuang asked angrily and rudely, “Who would dare make trouble?"

却說司馬懿夜觀天文，見一大星，赤色，光芒有角，自東北方流於西南方，墜於蜀營內，三投再起，隱隱有聲。懿驚喜曰：“孔明死矣！”卽傳令起大兵追之。方出寨門，忽又疑慮曰：“孔明善會六丁六甲之法，今見我久不出戰，故以此術詐死，誘我出耳。今若追之，必中其計。”遂復勒馬回寨不出，只令夏侯霸暗引數十騎，往五丈原山僻哨探消息。,"But it was said that Sima Yi watched the astronomy at night, and saw a big star, red, with horns, flowing from the northeast to the southwest, falling into the camp of Shu, and it rose again after three shots, and there was a faint sound. Yi was pleasantly surprised and said, ""Kong Ming is dead!"" Fang went out of the village gate, and suddenly he became suspicious and said: ""Kong Ming is good at learning the laws of Liu Ding and Liu Jia. Now I see that I have not fought for a long time, so I used this trick to trick me to death and lure me out of my ears. If I pursue it now, I will definitely fall for it."" Reining his horse to return to the village did not allow him to return, so Xiahou Ba secretly led dozens of horsemen to a remote post on Wuzhangyuan Mountain to check for news.","Sima Yi cannot understand what the stars are doing, for one reddish one dips and then rises and then dips again three times. Hoping this foretells the death of Kong Ming, he is still so frightened of Kong Ming that he dare not try to take advantage in case this is another of his tricks. Wei Yan, meanwhile, has had a dream.","One night a large red star with bright rays passed from the northeast to the southwest and dropped over the camps of Shu. It dipped thrice and rose again. Sima Yi heard also a low rumbling in the distance. He was pleased and excited, and said to those about him, “Zhuge Liang is dead.” At once he ordered pursuit with a strong force. But just as he passed his camp gates, doubts filled his mind and he gave up the plan. “Zhuge Liang is a master of mysteries; he can get aids from the Deities of the Six Layers; and it may be that this is but a ruse to get us to take the field. We may fall victims to his guile.” So he halted. But he sent Xiahou Ba with a few scouts to reconnoiter the enemy's camps."
却說郭淮收了軍馬，乃謂左右曰：“吾雖不得街亭，却取了列柳城，亦是大功。”引兵逕到城下叫門，只見城上一聲礮響，旗幟皆豎，當頭一面大旗，上書“平西都督司馬懿”。懿撐起懸空板，倚定護心木欄干，大笑曰：“郭伯濟來何遲也？”淮大驚曰：“仲達神機，吾不及也！”遂入城。相見已畢，懿曰：“今街亭已失，諸葛亮必走。公可速與子丹星夜追之。”郭淮從其言，出城而去。懿喚張郃曰：“子丹、伯濟，恐吾全獲大功，故來取此城池。吾非獨欲成功，乃僥倖而已。吾料魏延、王平、馬謖、高翔等輩，必先去據陽平關。吾若去取此關，諸葛亮必隨後掩殺，中其計矣。兵法云：‘歸師勿掩，窮寇莫追。’汝可從小路抄箕谷退兵。吾自引兵當斜谷之兵。若彼敗走，不可相拒，只宜中途截住，蜀兵輜重，可盡得也。”張郃受計，引兵一半去了。懿下令：“竟取斜谷：由西城而進——西城雖山僻小縣，乃蜀兵屯糧之所，又南安、天水、安定三郡總路。若得此城，三郡可復矣。”於是司馬懿留申耽、申儀守列柳城，自領大軍望斜谷進發。,"But he said that Guo Huai had taken the army horses, and he said to the left and right: ""Although I can't have a street pavilion, I have taken Liliucheng, which is also a great achievement."" He led his troops to the bottom of the city and called the gate, only to see the sound of a bang on the city, and the flags were erected. , with a banner in front of him, writing ""Sima Yi, Governor of Pingxi"". Yi propped up the hanging board, leaned against the heart-protecting wooden railing, laughed loudly and said, ""Why is Guo Boji coming?"" Huai was shocked and said, ""Zhongda Shenji, I am too late!"" Then he entered the city. After the meeting was over, Yi said, ""Jieting has been lost today, and Zhuge Liang must go. Gong Ke and Zidan Xingye chase after him."" Guo Huai followed his words and left the city. Yi called Zhang He and said, ""Zidan and Boji are afraid that I will gain great merit, so I came to take this city. I don't want to succeed alone, it's just luck. Yangping Pass. If I go to take this pass, Zhuge Liang will cover up and kill it later, which is the plan. The Art of War says: 'Don't cover up when you return to the teacher, and don't chase after the poor bandits.' Soldiers. If he loses and leaves, he can't refuse, but he should stop halfway, and the Shu soldiers can carry as much as they can."" Zhang He accepted the plan and led half of his troops away. Yi ordered: ""Actually take the inclined valley: enter from the west city - although the west city is a small county in the mountains, it is the place where the soldiers of Shu gather grain, and the three counties of Nan'an, Tianshui and Anding are connected. If this city is obtained, the three counties can be restored. It's over."" So Sima Yi left Shen Dan and Shen Yi to guard Liliucheng, and led the army to look at Xiegu and set off.","However, when Guo Huai and Cao Zhen reach the town gates, they see that Sima Yi has already taken the town.","Guo Huai, pleased with his success, gathered in his army after the victory and said to his officers, “I was disappointed at Jieting, but we have taken this place, and that is merit of high order.” Thereupon he proceeded to the city gates. Just as he arrived, a bomb exploded on the wall, and, looking up, he saw the rampart bedecked with flags. On the largest banner he read the characters “Sima Yi, General Who Pacifies the West”. At that moment Sima Yi himself lifted a board that hung in front of him and looked over the breast-high rail. He looked down and smiled, saying, “How late you are, friend Guo Huai!” Guo Huai was amazed. “He is too much for me,” said he. So Guo Huai resignedly entered the city and went to pay his respects to his successful rival. Sima Yi was gracious, and said, “Zhuge Liang must retire now that Jieting is lost. You join forces with Cao Zhen and follow up quickly.” Guo Huai agreed and took his leave. Sima Yi called to him Zhang He, and said, “Cao Zhen and Guo Huai thought we should win too great merit, so they tried to get ahead of us here. We are not the only ones who desire to achieve good service and acquire merit, but we had the good fortune to succeed. I thought Wei Yan, Ma Su, Wang Ping, and Gao Xiang would first try to occupy Yangping Pass; and if I went to take it, then Zhuge Liang would fall on our rear. It says in the books on war that one should crush a retreating enemy, not pursue broken rebels; so you may go along the by-roads and smite those withdrawing down the Chi Valley, while I oppose the Xie Valley army. If they flee, do not press them too much, but just hold them up on the road and capture the baggage train.” Zhang He marched away with half the force to carry out his part of this plan, while Sima Yi gave orders to go to the Xie Valley by way of Xicheng, which though a small place, was important as a depot of stores for the Shu army, beside commanding the road to the three counties of Nanan, Tianshui, and Anding. If this place could be captured, the other three could be recaptured. Sima Yi left Shen Yi and Shen Dan to guard Liliu and marched his army toward the Xie Valley."
却說西羌國王徹里吉，自曹操時年年入貢；手下有一文一武：文乃雅丹丞相，武乃越吉元帥。時魏使齎金珠并書到國，先來見雅丹丞相；送了禮物，具言求救之意。雅丹引見國王，呈上書禮。徹里吉覽了書，與衆商議。雅丹曰：“我與魏國素相往來，今曹都督求救，且許和親，理合依允。”徹里吉從其言，卽命雅丹與越吉元帥起羌兵一十五萬，皆慣使弓弩、鎗刀、蒺藜、飛鎚等器；又有戰車，用鐵葉裹釘，裝載糧食軍器什物：或用駱駝駕車，或用騾馬駕車，號為“鐵車兵”。二人辭了國王，領兵直扣西平關。守關蜀將韓禎，急差人齎文報知孔明。,"However, it is said that the king of the Western Qiang, Cheli Ji, has paid tribute every year since Cao Cao's time; At that time, Wei sent Ji Jinzhu and a book to the country, and he came first to see Prime Minister Yadan; he sent a gift with the intention of asking for help. Yadan introduced the king and presented him with a book. Cherigi read the book and consulted with the crowd. Yadan said: ""I have been in contact with Wei Guosu, and now the governor of Cao asks for help, and I agree to be with my relatives, and I will obey."" Bows, guns, knives, caltrops, flying hammers, etc.; there are also chariots, which are wrapped with iron leaves and loaded with grain, weapons, and other things: they can drive with camels, or drive with mules and horses, and they are called ""iron chariot soldiers"". The two resigned from the king and led the troops to the Xiping Pass. Han Zhen, the general who guarded Shuguan, urgently dispatched someone to report to Kongming in a letter.","Guo Huai reminds Cao Zhen that for years the Qiang tribes have brought tribute to the court. He suggests that, if Wei offered an imperial princess to be married into the tribal chieftain’s family, then they could ask for soldiers from the tribes in return. Cao Zhen sends a formal letter of proposal, and within weeks one hundred and fifty thousand Qiang tribesmen are on their way, along with their invincible iron-plated war wagons – some drawn by horses, some by camels. The army moves to the Xiping pass, where Han Zhen the Shu commander is in charge.","The King of the western Qiangs was named Cheli Ji. He had rendered yearly tribute since the days of Cao Cao. He had two ministers, one for civil and the other for military affairs, named, respectively, Prime Minister Ya Dan and Chief Leader Yue Ji. The letter was accompanied by presents of gold and pearls, and when the messenger arrived, he first sought Prime Minister Ya Dan, to whom he gave gifts and whose help he begged. Thus he gained an interview with the King, to whom he presented the letter and the gifts. The King accepted both and called his counselors to consider the letter. Ya Dan said, “We have had regular intercourse with the Wei nation. Now that Cao Zhen asks our aid and promises an alliance, we ought to accede to his request.” Cheli Ji agreed that it was so, and he ordered his two chief ministers to raise an army of two hundred fifty thousand of trained soldiers, archers and crossbowmen, spearmen and swordsmen, warriors who flung maces and hurled hammers. Beside these various weapons, the tribesmen used chariots covered with iron plates nailed on. They prepared much grain and fodder and many spare weapons, all of which they loaded upon these iron-clad chariots. The chariots were drawn by camels or teams of horses. The carts or chariots were known as “iron chariots.” The two leaders took leave of their King and went straightway to Xiping Pass. The commander in charge of the Pass, Han Zhen, at once sent intelligence to Zhuge Liang, who asked, “Who will go to attack the Qiangs?”"
是夜司馬師兵到樂嘉，立下營寨，等鄧艾未至。師為眼下新割肉瘤，瘡口疼痛，臥於帳中，令數百甲士環立護衞。三更時分，忽然寨內喊聲大震，人馬大亂。師急問之，人報曰：“一軍從寨北斬圍直入，為首一將，勇不可當！”師大驚，心如火烈，眼珠從肉瘤瘡口內迸出，血流遍地，疼痛難當；又恐有亂軍心，只咬被頭而忍——被皆咬爛。原來文鴦軍馬先到，一擁而進，在寨中左衝右突；所到之處，人不敢當，有相拒者，鎗搠鞭打，無不被殺。鴦只望父到，以為外應：並不見來。數番殺到中軍，皆被弓弩射回。鴦直殺到天明，只聽得北邊鼓角喧天。鴦回顧從者曰：“父親不在南面為應，却從北至，何也？”鴦縱馬看時，只見一軍行如猛風：為首一將，乃鄧艾也，躍馬橫刀，大呼曰：“反賊休走！”鴦大怒，挺鎗迎之。戰有五十合，不分勝敗。正鬥間，魏兵大進，前後夾攻。鴦部下兵各自逃散，只文鴦單人獨馬，衝開魏兵，望南而走。背後數百員魏將，抖擻精神，驟馬追來；將至樂嘉橋邊，看看趕上。鴦忽然勒回馬大喝一聲，直衝入魏將陣中來；鋼鞭起處：紛紛落馬，各自倒退。鴦復緩緩而行。魏將聚在一處，驚訝曰：“此人尚敢退我等之衆耶——可併力追之！”於是魏將百員，復來追趕。鴦勃然大怒曰：“鼠輩何不惜命也！”提鞭撥馬，殺入魏將叢中，用鞭打死數人，復回馬緩轡而行。魏將連追四五番，皆被文鴦一人殺退。後人有詩曰：,"It was Ye Sima's soldiers who arrived at Lejia, set up camp, and waited for Deng Ai to arrive. The teacher is now cutting a new sarcoid, and the sore is sore. He is lying in the tent, and has hundreds of soldiers standing guard. At the third watch, the shouts in the village suddenly shook, and the people and horses were in chaos. The teacher asked him urgently, and the people reported: ""An army will cut the siege straight from the north of the village, and take the lead as a general. You can't be brave!"" The teacher was shocked, and his heart was on fire. ; And fearing that the army will be disturbed, only bite the quilt head and endure - all the quilts are bitten to pieces. It turned out that the Wenyang army came first, rushed in, and rushed left and right in the village; wherever they went, no one dared to stand up, and those who resisted were beaten with guns and whipped, and all were killed. The ducks only expected their father to come, and thought they were responding: they didn't see him coming. After killing the central army several times, they were all shot back by the bow and crossbow. The Yang Ducks slaughtered until dawn, only to hear the drums and horns in the north. Yang looked back at his followers and said, ""My father is not from the south to answer, but from the north, why?"" When Yang looked at the horse, he saw an army marching like a gust of wind: The leader and the general were Deng Ai, who leaped on a horse and crossed a sword. He shouted: ""The rebels, leave!"" Yang Yang was furious and greeted him with a gun. There are fifty battles, no winner or loser. In the middle of the battle, the Wei army made a great advance, attacking from the front and back. The soldiers of Yuanyang's subordinates fled separately, but Wenyang, alone, rushed away from the Wei soldiers and looked south. Hundreds of Wei generals behind them, full of energy, rushed after them on horseback; approaching the Lejia Bridge, watch to catch up. The Yang Ducks suddenly pulled back to their horses and gave a loud shout, and rushed straight into the Wei general's formation. Yang Fu walked slowly. The Wei generals gathered in one place, surprised and said, ""This person still dares to retreat from our group—you can chase him together!"" So the Wei generals returned to chase after him. Yang Yang was furious and said, ""Why don't the rats risk their lives!"" He picked up the whip and plucked the horse, rushed into the Wei general's clump, beaten several people to death with the whip, and returned to the horse's bridle. The Wei generals chased after him for four or five times, but were all killed by Wenyang alone. A later poem says:","It is he who puts most fear into the hearts of the loyalist Wei troops, even though he is only eighteen years old. And it is he who leads a daring raid on the Wei camp. Inside the camp Sima Shi is in terrible pain from his eye but when he hears the shouts as Wen Yang leads the rebels into the Wei camp he rises, biting down on his quilt to stifle the cries of pain. The rebel attack initially creates panic among the Wei soldiers, and in the ensuing confusion many are killed. But slowly they regain their confidence and push back. The plan was that more troops from the rebel side would crash into the camp from the opposite direction – but none come. Instead a further contingent of the Wei troops arrive, trapping Wen Yang. Fleeing, he is pursued by a hundred of the enemy, but time and again Wen Yang turns and, driving straight into their midst, slays right and left with his steel whip until the men back off, and he is able to escape again.","When the hour came to start, he took his spear, swung himself into the saddle and set out. That night Sima Shi, who had arrived and had at once set about settling into camp, lay on a couch in his tent, for he was still suffering pain from the surgery wound beneath his eye. The tent was surrounded by several hundred armored guards. Deng Ai had not arrived. About the third watch Sima Shi heard a great shouting and asked what it was. One replied: “An army has come round from the north and burst into the lines. The leader is too bold for anyone to face.” Sima Shi became much troubled. His heart burned within him, and the excitement caused the wound to open, so that the eyeball protruded and blood flowed freely. The pain became intense, nearly unbearable. In his agony and alarm lest his army should be thrown into confusion, he lay gnawing the bed clothes till they were in rags. Wen Yang's force lost no time, but attacked as soon as it arrived. He dashed into the camp, slashing and thrusting right and left, and everyone gave way before him. If anyone stayed to oppose, the sharp spear or the terrible whip did its work, and that one fell. But after a time, seeing no sign of his father, Wen Yang grew anxious. And he had to retire several times before the fierce flights of arrows and crossbow bolts as he tried to reach the main tent. About daylight he heard shouts and thought they must mean the arrival of his father with help. But the shouting came from the north, and his father was to arrive by the south road. He galloped out to get a clearer view, and saw a force sweeping down like a gale of wind. It was not his father, but a body of the enemy, and the leader was Deng Ai. Deng Ai rode forward shouting, “Rebel, flee not!” Wen Yang had no intention to flee. Setting his spear, he rode savagely toward his opponent. They engaged and fought half a hundred bouts without either gaining the advantage. Then, the duel still raging, the Wei army attacked in full force, and Wen Yang's troops began to give way and run, so that soon he found himself alone. However, he got clear of the fight and went away south. But he was pursued, for more than a hundred Wei generals plucked up courage to follow when he ran away. They pressed on his heels till near the Lojia Bridge, when it seemed that they must catch him. Then he suddenly pulled up his steed, turned and rode in among them, flogging with the terrible steel whip, and wherever it struck there lay warriors and horses in confused heaps. So they left him, and he retook his way in peace. Then the Wei generals met and said, “Lo! Here is a man who has driven us all backward. But we are many and may not suffer that.” Wherefore they reformed and once again took up pursuit. “You fools?” cried Wen Yang, as he saw them coming on. “Have you then no regard for your lives?” Again he fell upon them with the steel whip and slew many, so that the survivors retreated. But yet again they found courage to come on, and yet again, but they had to fall back before the lash of that terrible whip. Defiance hurled at Cao Cao's mighty host Arrayed near Long Slope proclaimed Zhao Yun, A valiant man; and peerless stood he till."

却說玄德歸到寨中。龐統入見曰：“主公今日席上見劉季玉動靜乎？”玄德曰：“季玉眞誠實人也。”統曰：“季玉雖善，其臣劉璝、張任等皆有不平之色，其間吉凶未可保也。以統之計，莫若來日設宴，請季玉赴席；於壁衣中埋伏刀斧手一百人，主公擲盃為號，就筵上殺之；一擁入成都，刀不出鞘，弓不上弦，可坐而定也。”玄德曰：“季玉是吾同宗，誠心待吾；更兼吾初到蜀中，恩信未立；若行此事，上天不容，下民亦怨。公此謀，雖霸者亦不為也。”統曰：“此非統之謀；是法孝直得張松密書，言事不宜遲，只在早晚當圖之。”言未已，法正入見，曰：“某等非為自己，乃順天命也。”玄德曰：“劉季玉與吾同宗，不忍取之。”正曰：“明公差矣：若不如此，張魯與蜀有殺母之讎，必來攻取。明公遠涉山川，驅馳士馬，旣到此地，進則有功，退則無益。若執狐疑之心，遷延日久，大為失計。且恐機謀一洩，反為他人所算。不若乘此天與人歸之時，出其不意，早立基業，實為上策。”龐統亦再三相勸。正是：,"But he said that Xuande returned to the village. When Pang Tong came to see him, he asked, ""Does your lord see Liu Jiyu's movement at the table today?"" Xuande said, ""Ji Yu is really an honest person."" Tong said, ""Although Ji Yu is good, his ministers Liu Wei, Zhang Ren, etc. are all injustices. In the meantime, good and bad luck can’t be guaranteed. According to statistics, Mo Ruo will hold a banquet in the coming day and invite Ji Yu to attend the banquet; he will ambush a hundred swordsmen and axemen in the wall clothes, and the lord will throw the cup as the number, and kill him at the feast; one If you enter Chengdu, the sword will not be sheathed, and the bow will not be wound, so you can sit down.” Xuande said: “Jiyu is my same clan, and treats me sincerely; This matter is not tolerated by the heavens, and the people below are also resentful. Even if the tyrants do this, they will not do it.” Tong said: “This is an unconventional plan; Picture it."" Before he had finished speaking, Fa Zheng came into view and said, ""A certain class is not for himself, but obeys the mandate of heaven."" Xuande said: ""Liu Jiyu is of the same ancestry as me, and I cannot bear to take it."" Zheng said: ""Ming Tolerance Men: If this is not the case, Zhang Lu and Shu will have to kill their mother, and they will definitely come to attack. The Duke of Ming traveled far away in the mountains and rivers, drove the horses and horses, and came here. If you advance, you will be successful, but if you retreat, it will be useless. If you are suspicious, you will delay the day. For a long time, I made a big mistake. And I was afraid that the opportunity would be leaked, and it would be calculated by others. It is better to take advantage of this day and return to people to be unexpected and establish a foundation early, which is the best policy."" Pang Tong also advised three times. Exactly:","Have a hundred men hidden around the wall and invite Liu Zhang for another banquet. If you give us the signal – for example, dropping a cup – we’ll spring into action and kill Liu Zhang. Then our entry into the capital Chengdu will be unopposed.’ To this Xuande replies, ‘He’s my kinsman, and were I to do this neither Heaven nor the people themselves would forgive me.’ At this moment Fa Zheng arrives and adds his words to the argument: ‘This is not done for our own glory but because it’s the Mandate of Heaven.’ Again, Xuande argues that he cannot murder a kinsman, but Fa Zheng again disagrees, pointing out that if Xuande does not seize control then Zhang Lu will. Having come this far across difficult terrain, what would be the point now of turning round and going away? ‘ Seize the moment – both Heaven and the people want this,’ urges Pang Tong. The lord holds to the true Way.","When Liu Bei had returned to his own tent, Pang Tong came in to ask what impression he had of his host of that day. “He seems a very honest man,” said Liu Bei. “He is good enough, but some of his servants are discontented at this turn of affairs, and I would not guarantee there will be no murders. If you took my advice, you would have Liu Zhang assassinated at the return banquet. A hundred ruffians behind the arras, a signal from you, and the deed would be accomplished. All that would be needed, then would be a rush on Capital Chengdu. No sword need be drawn, no arrow fitted to the string.” “He is a brother of my house and has treated me with sincerity. I am a new-comer and so far unknown in this land. Such a deed would be abhorrent to all the world, and these people would resent it. I will not establish myself by such means.” “The scheme is not mine; it originated in a private letter from Zhang Song, who says it will have to be done some time.” At this moment Fa Zheng came in and said, “This is not for ourselves; it is the will of heaven.” “Liu Zhang and I are of the same house, and I would shudder at harming him.” “Sir, you are wrong. If you act not as we propose, then Zhang Lu will take Shu in revenge for the death of his mother. What is there for you at the end of your long march? Advance, and success is yours; retreat, and you have nothing. And delays are most dangerous. At any moment this scheme may leak out, and another will reap the profit. This is the day when Heaven smiles on you."
却說章武元年秋八月，先主起大軍至夔關，駕屯白帝城。前隊軍馬已出川口。近臣奉曰：“吳使諸葛瑾至。”先主傳旨敎休放入。黃權奏曰：“瑾弟在蜀為相，必有事而來。陛下何故絕之？當召入，看他言語。可從則從；如不可，則就借彼口說與孫權，令知問罪有名也。”先主從之，召瑾入城。瑾拜伏於地。先主問曰：“子瑜遠來，有何事故？”瑾曰：“臣弟久事陛下，臣故不避斧銊，特來奏荊州之事：前者，關公在荊州時，吳侯數次求親，關公不允。後關公取襄陽，曹操屢次致書吳侯，使襲荊州；吳侯本不肯許，因呂蒙與關公不睦，故擅自興兵，誤成大事。今吳侯悔之不及。此乃呂蒙之罪，非吳侯之過也。今呂蒙已死，寃讎已息。孫夫人一向思歸。今吳侯令臣為使，願送歸夫人，縛還降將，並將荊州仍舊交還，永結盟好，共滅曹丕，以正篡逆之罪。”先主怒曰：“汝東吳害了朕弟，今日敢以巧言來說乎！”瑾曰：“臣請以輕重大小之事，與陛下論之：陛下乃漢朝皇叔，今漢帝已被曹丕篡奪，不思剿除，却為異姓之親，而屈萬乘之尊，是捨大義而就小義也。中原乃海內之地，兩都皆大漢創業之方，陛下不取，而但爭荊州，是棄重而取輕也。天下皆知陛下卽位，必興漢室，恢復山河；今陛下置魏不問，反欲伐吳：竊為陛下不取。”先主大怒曰：“殺吾弟之讎，不共戴天！欲朕罷兵，除死方休！不看丞相之面，先斬汝首！今且放汝回去，說與孫權：洗頸就戮！”諸葛瑾見先主不聽，只得自回江南。,"But it is said that in the autumn and August of the first year of Zhangwu, the First Sovereign raised an army to Kuiguan, and settled in the city of Baidi. The front troops have already left the Kawaguchi. The close ministers said: ""Wu sent Zhuge Jin to arrive."" Huang Quan said: ""Brother Jin is the prime minister in Shu, and something must come. Why did Your Majesty refuse him? You should call him in and see what he has to say. It is also famous for questioning sins."" The First Lord followed it and called Jin into the city. Jin Bai fell to the ground. The First Sovereign asked: ""Tzuyu is far away, what happened?"" Jin said, ""My brother has been with Your Majesty for a long time, and the minister did not avoid the axe, so he came here to report the incident in Jingzhou: the former, when Duke Guan was in Jingzhou, Wu Houshu The next time I asked for a marriage, Guan Gong refused. Later, when Guan Gong took Xiangyang, Cao Cao sent letters to Wu Hou, and envoys attacked Jingzhou. This is the crime of Lv Meng, not the fault of Marquis Wu. Now Lv Meng is dead, and the grievance is over. Mrs. Sun has always wanted to return. Now the Marquis of Wu is envoy, and I would like to send it back to Mrs. Jingzhou is still handed back, and we will always form an alliance to destroy Cao Pi together, as a crime of usurping."" The First Lord said angrily, ""You have harmed my brother in Dongwu, and today you dare to use flattering words!"" Jin said, ""My minister, please I will discuss it with Your Majesty regarding matters of lightness, greatness and smallness: Your Majesty is the uncle of the Han Dynasty, and now the Emperor of the Han has been usurped by Cao Pi, and he does not want to exterminate them, but he is a relative of a different surname, and the honor of Qu Wancheng is to sacrifice the righteousness for the small righteousness. The Central Plains is a land within the sea, and both capitals are places where the big Han started their businesses. Your Majesty does not take it, but fights for Jingzhou, which is to abandon the heavy and take the light. The whole world knows that His Majesty's position will revive the Han Dynasty and restore the mountains and rivers; Wei Buwen, instead, wanted to attack Wu: steal it for Your Majesty and not take it."" The First Sovereign was furious and said, ""Killing my brother's corpse will not share the sky! If you want me to stop the army, I will stop the death! I don't look at the Prime Minister's face, I will cut it first. Your head! Now let you go back, and say to Sun Quan: If you wash your neck, you will be killed!"" Seeing that the First Sovereign would not listen, Zhuge Jin had no choice but to return to Jiangnan.","Zhuge Jin travels to Baidi, where the first ruler has settled his army, and asks for an audience with him. Initially the latter refuses to meet him, but he is persuaded by Huang Quan to change his mind, given Zhuge Jin is the brother of his own prime minister. Zhuge’s message is really quite simple. He spells out that when Guan Yu was in charge of Jingzhou, Lord Sun had made various offers of alliance, including offering his daughter in marriage to Guan Yu’s son, but they were refused. Lord Sun also turned down suggested alliances with Cao Cao, and it was as an independent agent that Lü Meng attacked Guan Yu – certainly not with Lord Sun’s approval. ‘But now Lü Meng is dead, and Lady Sun wishes greatly to be reunited with her husband,’ says Zhuge Jin. ‘We wish also to restore Jingzhou to you as a sign of our friendship so that together we can destroy the traitor Cao Pi.’ But the first ruler is far from impressed and retorts that it was southerners who murdered his brother. But Zhuge Jin, to his credit, is not put off. ‘If I may, let me examine the situation here,’ he says. ‘You are an imperial uncle of the Han. The Han emperor has been illegally deposed by Cao Pi. However, instead of focusing on extirpating this traitor, you chose to fail in your imperial duty for the sake of an oath with someone not even a blood relative! You set aside a sacred duty for a personal sense of obligation. The heart of the empire is the north, and Chang’an and Luoyang have ever been its capitals. But you are willing to abandon them for the sake of – what – Jingzhou!","His advanced guard had gone beyond the Lands of Rivers when his attendants told him that Zhuge Jin had come as a messenger from Wu. He told them not to admit him. But Huang Quan said, “His brother being your Prime Minister, Zhuge Jin is certainly come on some important mission. Your Majesty ought to see him and hear what he says. If his proposals are admissible, then agree; if not, he can be made use of to take knowledge of your intentions to Sun Quan and let Sun Quan know that you intend to punish his crime.” Then the First Ruler gave way, and the messenger was brought in. He bowed down to the earth. “Zhuge Jin, you have come a long journey; what is its object?” said the First Ruler. “My brother has long served Your Majesty; I have come at the risk of my life to discuss Jingzhou affairs. When Guan Yu was at Jingzhou, my master repeatedly sought to ally the two families by marriage, but was refused. When Guan Yu attacked Xiangyang, Cao Cao wrote again and again urging my master to attack Jingzhou. But the Marquis was unwilling, and it was the enmity between your brother and Lu Meng that led to the attack and the unfortunate success. “My master is now very sorry for it, but it was Lu Meng's doing. However, Lu Meng is now dead and his enmity has died with him. Moreover, Lady Sun is always thinking over returning to you. My master now proposes to send back the lady, to bind and hand over to you those officers who surrendered, and to restore Jingzhou. If the two houses swear perpetual amity, then they may join forces against Cao Pi and punish his usurpation.” To this harangue the First Ruler only replied, “You of Eastern Wu killed my brother; yet you dare to come with your artful talk!” Zhuge Jin said, “I only wish to discuss the relative importance of the issues. Your Majesty is an Imperial Uncle, and Cao Pi has seized the throne of your House. Yet you do not think of destroying the usurper, but on the other hand you disregard the most honorable position in the world for the sake of a so-called brother, a connection of another name. Surely this is rejecting the chief for the subordinate, the main issue for a detail. “The Middle Land is the biggest part of the empire, and the two capitals, Luoyang and Changan, are both famous as places whence the two, one the Founder, the other the Restorer, of the Hans, initiated their mighty task. Your Majesty takes no thought of these, but would dispute over Jingzhou; in other words, the important is abandoned for the worthless. “All the world knows of your assumption of the dignity of Emperor and that you will assuredly restore the Hans and rescue their territory; only now you do not try to deal with Wei, you only desire to attack Wu. I venture to think you have made a bad choice.” All this argument only added fuel to the fire. “The slayer of my brother shall not live in the same world as I. You ask me not to fight. I will cease when I have slain your master. Were it not for the sake of your brother, I would behead you at once. As it is, you may go; and you may tell your master to cleanse his neck ready for the blade of the executioner.” Zhuge Jin saw that the position was hopeless and took his leave to return to the South Land."

却說先主從巫峽建平起，直接彝陵界分，七十餘里，連結四十餘寨；見關興、張苞屢立大功，歎曰：“昔日從朕諸將，皆老邁無用矣；復有二姪如此英雄，朕何慮孫權乎！”正言間，忽報韓當、周泰領兵來到。先主方欲遣將迎敵，近臣奏曰：“老將黃忠，引五六人投東吳去了。”先主笑曰：“黃漢升非反叛之人也；因朕失口誤言老者無用，彼必不服老，故奮力去相持矣。”卽召關興、張苞曰：“黃漢升此去必然有失。賢姪休辭勞苦，可去相助。略有微功，便可令回，勿使有失。”二小將拜辭先主，引本部軍來助黃忠。正是：,"However, he said that the First Sovereign started from Wuxia Jianping, and directly divided the border of Yiling, more than 70 li, and connected more than 40 villages; seeing that Guan Xing and Zhang Bao had repeatedly made great achievements, he sighed and said, ""The generals who followed me in the past are all old and old. It's useless; there are two more heroes like this, why should I worry about Sun Quan!"" Just as he was talking, he suddenly reported that Han Dang and Zhou Tai had come with troops. The First Sovereign wanted to send his generals to meet the enemy, but a close official said: ""The veteran general Huang Zhong, led five or six men to go to Eastern Wu."" The First Sovereign laughed and said, ""Huang Hansheng is not a rebellious person; because I made a mistake and said that the old man is useless, He will definitely not accept the old age, so he is struggling to hold on to the stalemate."" You summoned Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and said, ""Huang Han's promotion here is bound to be a loss. The virtuous woman can go to help each other after resigning from hard work. I have lost it."" The second general paid tribute to the First Sovereign, and brought in the troops of the headquarters to assist Huang Zhong. Exactly:","Sun Quan is devastated by the news of these defeats, and it is Zhang Zhao who suggests how they should now respond, recommending certain key commanders for various roles, and with an army of one hundred thousand they advance to confront Xuande. The first ruler, meanwhile, is delighted by the performance of the two young men and says, perhaps a bit casually, ‘My old commanders are frankly getting a bit past it, so I’m delighted to have such excellent new, young men to take their place.’ News comes of the advance of the troops of Wu, and also that Huang Zhong, that veritable old warrior, has deserted. ‘No,’ says the first ruler, ‘I spoke without thinking about our older generals, and he has gone off in a huff to show us he is still the best!’ But he sends Zhang Bao and Guan Xing after him to ensure the old fighter is all right. So what has happened to Huang Zhong?","Now the First Ruler had made a line of forty camps from Wukou and Jianping to Yiling, spreading twenty-five miles of distance. He was exceedingly pleased with his two nephews, who had distinguished themselves again and again, and he said, “The generals that have followed me since the early days have got aged, and thus no longer a big use. But now that I have such two valorous nephews, I have no fear for Sun Quan.” When he heard of the coming of Sun Quan's army under Han Dang and Zhou Tai, he wished to select a commander to oppose the Wu army. Then those near him reported: “Huang Zhong and a half dozen other officers have run off to Wu.” “Huang Zhong is no traitor;” said the First Ruler, smiling, “it is only that he heard what I happened to say about old and useless leaders. He will not confess he is old and wants to prove he is not.” Then he called Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and said to them, “Huang Zhong may fail in this enterprise of his, so I hope you two will not mind going to his assistance. As soon as there is some success to report, get him to return and do not let him come to grief.” So the two got their troops together and went off to assist the aged warrior. When young, success is easy, thine at will,"
建興九年春二月，孔明復出師伐魏：時魏太和五年也。魏主曹叡知孔明又伐中原，急召司馬懿商議。懿曰：“今子丹已亡，臣願竭一人之力，剿除寇賊，以報陛下。”叡大喜，設宴待之。次日，人報蜀兵寇急。叡卽命司馬懿出師禦敵，親排鑾駕送出城外。懿辭了魏主，逕到長安，大會諸路人馬，計議破蜀兵之策。張郃曰：“吾願引一軍去守雍、郿，以拒蜀兵。”懿曰：“吾前軍不能獨當孔明之衆，而又分兵為前後，非勝算也。不如留兵守上邽，餘衆悉往祁山。公肯為先鋒否？”郃大喜曰：“吾素懷忠義，欲盡心報國，惜未遇知己；今都督肯委重任，雖萬死不辭。”於是司馬懿令張郃為先鋒，總督大軍；又令郭淮守隴西諸郡。其餘衆將各分道而進。前軍哨馬報說：“孔明率大軍望祁山進發，前部先鋒王平、張嶷，逕出陳倉，過劍閣，由散關望斜谷而來。”司馬懿謂張郃曰：“今孔明長驅大進，必將割隴西小麥，以資軍糧。汝可結營守祁山，吾與郭淮巡略天水諸郡，以防賊兵割麥。”郃領諾，遂引四萬兵守祁山。懿引大軍望隴西而去。,"In the spring and February of the ninth year of Jianxing, Kong Ming returned to attack Wei: it was the fifth year of Taihe of Wei. Cao Rui, the master of Wei, knew that Kongming was attacking the Central Plains again, and urgently summoned Sima Yi to discuss it. Yi said, ""Now that Zidan is dead, I would like to do my best to exterminate the bandits and thieves in return for His Majesty."" Rui was overjoyed and held a banquet for him. The next day, people reported that the Shu soldiers were anxious. Rui You ordered Sima Yi to go out to fight the enemy, and personally arranged for Luan to drive out of the city. Yi resigned from Lord Wei and went straight to Chang'an, where all the people gathered to discuss the strategy of breaking the army of Shu. Zhang He said: ""I would like to lead an army to guard Yong and Ji, in order to resist the soldiers of Shu."" Yi said: ""My former army cannot be the crowd of Kong and Ming alone, and it is not a chance of winning if my army is divided into front and rear. Now, the rest of the people will all go to Qishan. Would you be willing to be the vanguard?"" He was overjoyed and said: ""I always have loyalty and I want to serve the country with all my heart, but unfortunately I haven't met a confidant; now the governor is willing to entrust a heavy responsibility, even if he will die."" So Sima Yi ordered Zhang He to be the vanguard. , the governor of the army; and Guo Huai was ordered to guard the counties in Longxi. The rest will go their separate ways. The Qianjun Mabao said: ""Kong Ming led the army to look at the Qishan Mountain, and the pioneers Wang Ping and Zhang Yi in the front went out of the Chencang, crossed the Jiange, and came from the Sanguan to look at the sloped valley."" Sima Yi said to Zhang He: ""Now Kongming is driving a long drive. During the great advance, the wheat in Longxi will be harvested to finance the army. You can set up a camp to defend Qishan, and Guo Huai and I will patrol the Tianshui counties to prevent the thieves from harvesting the wheat."" He led the promise and led 40,000 soldiers to defend Qishan. Yi led the army to look at Longxi and left.","Sima Yi is called to command the Wei forces, and the two armies and their leaders set forth once again for battle. Sima Yi realizes that Kong Ming is going to need supplies, especially of grain, and that therefore he will force the Qishan pass and seize the grain fields of Longxi.","In the spring of the ninth year of Beginning Prosperity, the Shu army once more took the held against Wei. In Wei it was the fifth year of Calm Peace (AD 231). When the Ruler of Wei heard of this new expedition, he called Sima Yi and asked his advice. “Now that my friend Cao Zhen is no more, I am willing to do all that one man can to destroy the rebels against Your Majesty's authority,” said Sima Yi. Cao Rui was gratified by this ready offer, and honored Sima Yi with a banquet. Next day an edict was issued for the army to move. The Ruler of Wei, riding in his state chariot, escorted Sima Yi out of the city, and, after the farewells, the general took the road to Changan, where the force was gathering. There was assembled a council of war. Zhang He offered his services, saying, “I volunteer to guard Yongcheng and Meicheng against the Shu army.” But Sima Yi said, “Our vanguard army is not strong enough to face the enemy's whole force. Moreover, to divide an army is not generally a successful scheme. The better plan will be to leave a guard in Shanggui and send all the others to Qishan. Will you undertake the leadership of the van?” Zhang He consented, saying, “I have always been most loyal and will devote my energies entirely to the service of the state. So far I have not had an adequate opportunity to prove my sincerity; but now that you confer upon me a post of such responsibility, I can only say that no sacrifice can be too great for me, and I will do my utmost.” So Zhang He was appointed van-leader, and then Guo Huai was set over the defense of the counties of Xizhou. Other generals were distributed to other posts, and the march began. The spies reported: “The main force of Shu is directed toward Qishan, and the Leaders of the Van are Wang Ping and Zhang Ni. The route chosen for their march is from Chencang across San Pass and to the Xie Valley.” Hearing this, Sima Yi said to Zhang He, “Zhuge Liang is advancing in great force and certainly intends to reap the wheat in Xizhou for his supply. You get sufficient troops to hold Qishan, while Guo Huai and I go to Tianshui and foil the enemy's plan to gather the wheat.” So Zhang He took forty thousand troops to hold Qishan, and Sima Yi set out westwards to Xizhou."

This is manifest in the late king’s victories in war and the shining virtue of the king today. The Great Way teaches us that the empire does not belong to anyone, for it belongs to everyone. Because the Mighty Yao did not favour his own son, his name is for ever associated with fame. I seek to follow his example. Today, by abdicating to the prime minister, the king of Wei, I follow the example set by Yao and I hope that the king of Wei will not reject this.’","“During the whole of my thirty-two years of reign the land has been in a state of turmoil, but the spirits of my ancestors have preserved me in the midst of danger. Now from the signs of the heavens and the hearts of the people, I see that the virtue of the Hans is exhausted, and happy fortune has devolved upon the House of Wei, as may be seen from the success in war enjoyed by the late King Cao and the resplendent virtue of the present Prince, which answers to the times. “By all noble principles the empire is no private possession, but a public trust. Wherefore the great King Yao, to his eternal glory, passed over his own son. How I admire this deed! Now in imitation thereof I have resolved to abdicate in favor of my Chief Minister, the Prince of Wei, who will not, I hope, disappoint my wishes.”"

A total of 500,000 Sichuan soldiers were raised, and they looked forward to Yizhou. Suddenly Guan Suo, the third son of Duke Guan, entered the army and came to see Kong Ming and said: ""Since Jingzhou fell, he fled to Baojiazhuang to recuperate. Every time he went to Sichuan to see the emperor's report, the sores were not closed, so he couldn't leave. He has almost recovered. , I found out that all the people of Dongwu have been executed, and they came to Xichuan to see the emperor, and just met the soldiers who marched south, and came to see them.""

Hungry, thirsty and thirsty, staying at night in Xiaoxing: Wherever I pass, there is nothing wrong with autumn.","But Kong Ming reassures him that he has put in place worthy commanders to protect the land. So it is that shortly thereafter he sets forth for the south of the country, accompanied by trusted commanders such as Zhao Zilong, Wei Yan, Wang Ping and Zhang Yi. En route they meet the third son of Guan Yu, Guan Suo, whom Kong Ming appoints as head of the vanguard. The well-provisioned army proceeds on its way to battle. When news of the advancing army reaches the three treacherous governors, they meet to confer and plot. Each of them has an army of some fifty to sixty thousand men. They send out an advanced party under E Huan, a giant of a man with an ugly face and the energy of many men.","Zhuge Liang steadily opposed all Wang Lian's efforts to bring about a change of intention, and he soon took leave of the Latter Ruler and made ready to start. Jiang Wan was Army Counselor of the expedition; Fei Yi, Recorder; Fan Jian and Dong Jue, Army Inspectors; Zhao Yun and Wei Yan, Commanders; Wang Ping and Zhang Yi, Deputy Generals. Beside these were other half a hundred leaders and officers of Shu, and the whole force was five hundred thousand troops. Soon after the force marched south to Yiazhou, Guan Suo, the third son of Guan Yu, appeared and wished to see Zhuge Liang, and he said, “After the fall of Jingzhou, I was hidden by the Bao family from where I wanted to go to the Lands of Rivers to ask for a revenge for my father; but I fell in illness, which was long and severe, and I only just recovered. I was then traveling toward Chengdu to meet with the Emperor, when I met the army in the south expedition. I know that vengeance has been taken on the murderers of my father. And now I want to present myself to the Prime Minster.” Zhuge Liang was greatly affected to see him. He sent news of the young man's arrival to the court and gave Guan Suo a post of Van Leader. The army, foot and horse, marched in the best of order, eating when hungry, drinking when thirsty, camping at night, and moving by day."

皓字元宗，大帝孫權太子孫和之子也。當年七月，卽皇帝位，改元為元興元年，封太子孫（上雨下單）為豫章王，追諡父和為文皇帝，尊母何氏為太后，加丁奉為左右大司馬。次年改為甘露元年。皓凶暴日甚，酷溺酒色，寵幸中常侍岑昏。濮陽興、張布諫之，皓怒，斬二人，滅其三族。由是廷臣緘口，不敢再諫。又改寶鼎元年，以陸凱、萬彧為左右丞相。時皓居武昌，揚州百姓泝流供給，甚苦之；又奢侈無度，公私匱乏。陸凱上疏諫曰：,"Haozi Yuanzong, the son of the great emperor Sun Quan and Crown Prince Sun He. In July of that year, Emperor Yu took the throne and changed the Yuan to the first year of Yuanxing. He named the crown prince and grandson (the rain placed an order) as the king of Yuzhang, after the posthumous father and the emperor Wen, honored his mother He as the empress dowager, and Jiading as the left and right grandfather. Sima. The following year was changed to the first year of Ganlu. Hao became more and more violent, drowned in alcohol, and often served Cen faint in favor of him. Puyang Xing and Zhang Bu remonstrated against him, and when they were angry, they beheaded two people and destroyed their three clans. Since the courtier kept his mouth shut, he did not dare to remonstrate. In the first year of Baoding, Lu Kai and Wan Yu were the prime ministers. Shi Hao lived in Wuchang, and the people of Yangzhou went back to supply, which was very hard; he was extravagant, and public and private were scarce. Lu Kai remonstrated and said:","The leading military officers complain that he is a callow youth and what is needed now is a leader – such as Sun Hao, the son of Sun He. They are adamant that he should be their ruler. So Sun Wan is given a small region to govern, and Sun Hao is proclaimed emperor. It is the year AD 265 when he takes the throne. However, it is not long before he starts to show his true, warped nature and manifest his innate cruelty and indeed extreme violence. He elevates the eunuch Cen Hun to be his companion in crime, and when the late emperor’s prime minister, Puyang Xing, and others protest, he arbitrarily has them executed. After that, no one dares complain or resist. His oppressive measures and inordinately heavy taxes bring poverty to wide swathes of the country, and he takes not just through outrageous taxes but by sequestering private funds and family fortunes as well. Even his own appointee as deputy prime minister, Lü Kai, is moved to petition him.","Sun Hao was the son of Sun He, a former Heir Apparent, and grandson of Sun Quan the Great Emperor. The excluded prince, Sun Wan, was consoled with the title of Prince of Yuzhang. Posthumous rank was given to his late father, Sun He the Scholar Emperor, and his mother, Lady He, the Scholar Empress. The Veteran Leader Ding Feng was made Commander of the Right and Left Armies. However, the year-style was changed to Sweet Dew the very next year. The new ruler soon proved himself cruel and oppressive and day by day grew more so. Sun Hao indulged in every form of vice and chose Eunuch Cen Hun as his confidant and favorite. When Prime Minister Puyang Xing and General Zhang Bu ventured upon remonstrance, both, with all their family, were put to death. Thereafter none dared to speak; the mouth of every courtier was “sewn up.” Another year-style, Treasured Paramount, was adopted the next year (266), and the responsibility of the Prime Minister's office was shared by two officers, Lu Kai the Left and Wan Yu the Right. At this time the imperial residence was in Wuchang. The people of Yangzhou shouldered heavy tribute and suffered exceedingly. There was no limit to the Ruler's extravagance; the treasury was swept clean and the income of the royal domain exhausted. At length Lu Kai, Left Prime Minister, ventured a memorial, saying:"

Liu Xuan hurriedly sent people to Chengdu to ask for help. . When Liu Zhang heard that Deng Xian had been compromised, he was shocked and hurriedly gathered the crowd to discuss. The eldest son Liu Xunjin said: ""My son would like to lead troops to guard Luocheng."" Zhang said, ""My son is willing to go, who should I send to assist?"" Wu Yi also. Zhang said, ""It would be best if you have Uncle Zun. Who can be the lieutenant?"" Wu Yi protected Wu Lan and Lei Tong as lieutenants, and ordered 20,000 troops to come to Luocheng. Liu Xuan and Zhang Ren then followed, stating their previous affairs. Wu Yi said: ""It is difficult to resist the enemy when the troops are under the city. What do you think of it?"" Leng Bao said: ""The area here is right next to the Fujiang River, and the river is very urgent. Bring your shovels and hoes to the water, and you can drown Liu Bei's troops."" Wu Yi followed his plan and ordered Leng Bao to go to Jueshui, and Wu Lan and Lei Tong led troops to respond. Leng Bao took the lead and went to prepare the water-determining equipment.","However, when Ling Bao returns to Luocheng, he tells no one about his capture and release, claiming instead to have been a true hero who slew a dozen men and escaped. When news of the defeat reaches Chengdu, Liu Zhang is deeply troubled. His eldest son, Liu Xun, offers to defend Luocheng and, supported by other commanders, he sets off with his army. On arrival at Luocheng they confer with Liu Gui, Zhang Ren and Ling Bao. It is Ling Bao who comes up with an idea: ‘The River Fu flows by and is very swift. Their camp is in the plains below the hills. Give me five thousand men with spades and picks and I’ll divert the river and wash away Xuande and his army.’ As this work proceeds, Xuande is informed of the apparent plot of Sun Quan to link up with Zhang Lu and encourage an attack on Jiameng pass.","So the prisoner was set free. When Ling Bao reached the city and saw his two friends, he told them, saying, “I slew many of the enemy and escaped by mounting the steed of one of them.” Ling Bao said no word of having been captured. Messengers were sent in haste to Chengdu for help. The loss of his general, Deng Xian, disturbed the Imperial Protector greatly. He called his advisers together to consult. Then his eldest son, Liu Xun, said, “Father, let me go to defend Luocheng.” “You may go, my son, but who is there to go with you?” One Wu Yi at once offered himself. He was brother-in-law to Liu Zhang, who said, “It is well that you go, Brother-in-Law, but who will second you?” Wu Yi at once recommended two men, Wu Lan and Lei Tong, who were appointed to assist in the command. Twenty thousand troops were given them, and they set out for Luocheng. Liu Gui and Zhang Ren came out to welcome them and told them what had happened. Wu Yi said, “If the enemy draw near to the walls, it will be hard to drive them off again. What do you two think should be done?” Ling Bao replied, “The city lies along River Fu and the current is strong. The enemy camp lies low at the foot of the hills; and with five thousand people I can cut the river banks, flood their camp, and drown Liu Bei and his army with him.” The plan was approved, and Ling Bao went away to carry it out. Wu Lan and Lei Tong were told off to supervise the workers. They began to prepare the tools for cutting the bank."
且說張郃追蜀兵不上，回到寨中。忽有陳倉城郝昭差人申報，言王雙被斬。曹眞聞知，傷感不已，因此憂成疾病；遂回洛陽，命郭淮、孫禮、張郃守長安諸道。,"Besides, Zhang He could not pursue the troops of Shu and returned to the village. Suddenly, Chen Cangcheng and Hao Zhao sent a report, and Yan Wangshuang was executed. When Cao Zhen heard about it, he was deeply saddened and worried about becoming ill. He then returned to Luoyang and ordered Guo Huai, Sun Li, and Zhang He to guard the roads of Chang'an.","Wei Yan, operating on secret orders from Kong Ming, also traps Wang Shuang and slays him, and then Kong Ming, being a realist, orders a retreat by the Shu army, because indeed they are running out of supplies.","Zhang He, who, failing to come up with the retiring enemy, presently returned to camp. Hao Zhao sent a letter to say that Wang Shuang had met his end. This loss caused Cao Zhen deep grief, so that he became ill and had to return to Luoyang.

張苞入奏曰：“吳班軍馬已至。小臣乞為先鋒。”先主壯其志，卽取先鋒印賜張苞。苞方欲挂印，又一少年將奮然出曰：“留下印與我！”視之，乃關興也。苞曰：“我已奉詔矣。”興曰：“汝有何能，敢當此任？”苞曰：“我自幼習學武藝，箭無虛發。”先主曰：“朕正要觀賢姪武藝，以定優劣。”苞令軍士於百步之外，立一面旗，旗上畫一紅心。苞拈弓取箭，連射三箭，皆中紅心。衆皆稱善。關興挽弓在手曰：“射中紅心，何足為奇！”正言間，忽值頭上一行雁過。興指曰：“吾射這飛雁第三隻。”一箭射去，那隻雁應弦而落。文武官僚，齊聲喝采。苞大怒，飛身上馬，手挺父所使丈八點鋼矛，大叫曰：“你敢與我比試武藝否！”興亦上馬，綽家傳大砍刀縱馬而出曰：“偏你能使矛！吾豈不能使刀！”,"Zhang Bao entered the memorial and said, ""The army and horses of the Wu class have arrived. The little minister begged to be the vanguard."" When Bao Fang wanted to hang the seal, another young man rushed out and said, ""Leave the seal with me!"" It was Guan Xing who saw it. Bao said, ""I have been enjoined."" Xing said, ""How can you be able to take on this position?"" Bao said, ""I have been learning martial arts since I was a child, and my arrows never fail."" The First Lord said, ""I am going to Look at the martial arts of the virtuous, and determine the good and the bad."" Bao ordered the sergeant to set up a flag a hundred paces away, and painted a red heart on the flag. The bud took the bow and took the arrow, and shot three arrows in a row, all of which hit the red heart. All are called good. Guan Xing held his bow in his hand and said, ""It's amazing to hit a red heart!"" Just as he was speaking, a line of geese suddenly passed over his head. Xing Zhi said, ""I shoot the third flying geese."" When the arrow shot, the geese fell in response. Civil and military bureaucrats, applauded in unison. Bao was furious and flew on his horse, holding the eight-point steel spear made by his father in his hand, and shouted, ""Do you dare to compete with me in martial arts!"" But you can make a spear! Can't I make a knife!""","But when the first ruler hands over the seal of authority to lead the army to Zhang Bao, Guan Xing protests mightily. ‘Give that to me!’ he shouts. ‘But I have been given the responsibility,’ says Zhang Bao. ‘Really? You really think you are worthy of this role? Me, I have trained as a warrior since I was a child. No arrow of mine ever misses the mark.’ The row looks set to escalate, but the first ruler steps in and suggests that they display their relative skills in a contest. So a banner with a red target at its centre is placed a hundred yards away. In quick succession Zhang Bao fires three arrows. All three hit the target. In response, Guan Xing, seeing a flight of geese in the sky, says, ‘I will take out the third one.’ Sure enough, no sooner has the arrow left his bow than the third goose falls dead to the ground. ‘Fight me for this honour,’ shouts Zhang Bao, leaping onto his horse and seizing a huge spear. ‘ Happily,’ roars back Guan Xing. ‘You can have the spear, I have my sword.’","Zhang Fei's son, Zhang Bao, came in, saying, “Wu Ban and his army have come; I pray that I may be appointed to lead the van.” The First Ruler admired his noble intent and gave him a van-leader's seal. But just as he was attaching the seal to his girdle, another youth boldly stepped forth and said, “Leave that seal to me!” It was Guan Xing, son of Guan Yu. “I have already received my commission,” said Zhang Bao. “What abilities have you for such a task?” cried Guan Xing. “That I have been training as a soldier since my boyhood. I can shoot and never miss.” “I should like to see your prowess,” said the First Ruler, “that I may decide who is the better.” Zhang Bao ordered some of his people to set up a flag at a hundred paces, and on the flag he drew a heart in red. Then he took his bow and shot three arrows, each of which went through the heart. Those present commended the performance. Then Guan Xing seized his bow, saying, “What is it to hit such a mark?” Just as he said this a flock of wild geese flew over his head. “I will hit the third of the flying geese,” said he. He shot; and the third fell. “Fine!” cried all the assembly as one voice. But Zhang Bao was enraged. Leaping on his steed, he seized the long octane-serpent halberd left him by his father, crying, “Dare you try a real combat?” Guan Xing took up the challenge at once. He sprang into the saddle, took his great saber, and galloped out. “You can use the spear, think you that I cannot wield a sword?” cried he."
次日，張飛又欲下關戰馬超。人報軍師來到。玄德接着孔明。孔明曰：“亮聞孟起世之虎將，若與翼德死戰，必有一傷；故令子龍、漢升守住綿竹，我星夜來此。可用條小計，令馬超歸降主公。”玄德曰：“吾見馬超英勇，甚愛之。如何可得？”孔明曰：“亮聞東川張魯，欲自立為‘漢寧王’。手下謀士楊松，極貪賄賂。可差人從小路逕投漢中，先用金銀結好楊松，後進書與張魯云：‘吾與劉璋爭西川，是與汝報讎。不可聽信離間之語。事定之後，保汝為漢寧王。’令其撤回馬超兵。待其來撤時，便可用計招降馬超矣。”玄德大喜，卽時修書，差孫乾齎金珠從小路逕至漢中，先來見楊松，說知此事，送了金珠。松大喜，先引孫乾見張魯，陳言方便。魯曰：“玄德只是左將軍，如何保得我為漢寧王？”楊松曰：“他是大漢皇叔，正合保奏。”張魯大喜，便差人敎馬超罷兵。孫乾只在楊松家聽回信。,"The next day, Zhang Fei wanted to fight Ma Chao again. People reported that the military division came. Xuande followed Kongming. Kong Ming said: ""Liang heard that Meng Qi's tiger general, if he fought with Yide to the death, would definitely be injured. Therefore, Zilong and Hansheng were ordered to guard Mianzhu, and I came here in Xingye. There is a small plan to make Ma Chao return to the lord."" Xuande said: ""I see Ma Chao's heroism and love him very much. How can I get it?"" Kong Ming said: ""Liang heard that Zhang Lu of Dongchuan wanted to establish himself as the 'King of Hanning'. Yang Song, his adviser, was extremely greedy for bribes. You can send people to Hanzhong from a small path. Use gold and silver to bind Yang Song, and later enter the book with Zhang Luyun: 'I and Liu Zhang are fighting for Xichuan, which is to report to you. You must not listen to the words of alienation. After the matter is settled, I will protect you as King of Hanning.' Order him to withdraw Ma Chaobing. When he comes to withdraw, he can use a plan to recruit Ma Chao."" Xuande was overjoyed, and he was repairing books at the time, and sent Sun Qianjie Jinzhu to Hanzhong from a small route. He came first to see Yang Song, said that he knew about this, and sent Jinzhu. Song was overjoyed and first brought Sun Qian to see Zhang Lu, which was convenient for Chen Yan. Lu said: ""Xuande is only a general of the left, how can I keep me as King of Hanning?"" Yang Song said, ""He is the uncle of the emperor of the Han Dynasty, and he is playing in harmony."" Zhang Lu was overjoyed, so he sent Ma Chao to dismiss the troops. Sun Qian only listened to the reply at Yang Song's house.","Yet again, when dawn breaks, Zhang Fei is up and ready for combat. But before he can enter the fray, Kong Ming arrives, having heard of what is going on and very worried that the end result will be the death of Zhang Fei. ‘I’ve a plan for bringing Ma Chao to our side,’ says Kong Ming. ‘I really admire Ma Chao’s courage,’ says Xuande, ‘but do you really think you can get him?’ ‘As we know, Zhang Lu’s ambition is to be the “king” of Hanning,’ says Kong Ming. ‘One of his senior advisers is a truly greedy little man by the name of Yang Song, who loves bribes. We send someone to Hanzhong to buy his friendship. Then we write to Zhang Lu, saying that your battle with Liu Zhang is because you want to avenge him and that, when you win, you will ask the emperor to make him king of Hanning. This will make him order Ma Chao to cease and retreat, and at that point we can turn Ma Chao to our side.’ So Sun Qian is despatched with the letter and enough gold and pearls to bribe Yang Song. As Kong Ming forecast, Yang Song is more than happy to be bribed. That done, Yang Song brings Sun Qian to meet Zhang Lu, who, because of Xuande’s imperial family connections, believes his offer and accepts with delight.","Early next day Zhang Fei was once more going down out of the Pass to fight, when they told him that the Directing Instructor had arrived. Liu Bei went to receive him, and Zhuge Liang at once began to speak of Ma Chao. “He is the most terrible leader of the age; if he fights a desperate battle with Zhang Fei, loss of a general will ensue. So I have come as quickly as I could. I left Mianzhu in the safe hands of Zhao Yun and Huang Zhong. I think I have a little ruse left that will bring Ma Chao over to our side.” “Now I have seen the man. I greatly admire him,” said Liu Bei. “If we could only win him over!” “Then listen, my lord,” said Zhuge Liang. “Zhang Lu greatly desires the title of 'Prince of Hanzhong.' Among his most intimate subordinates, I know Yang Song open to bribery. So we will send a person secretly to see him and give him gold and silver and so win his support. This done, we will write to Zhang Lu and tell him that you are set upon taking Yiazhou from its present ruler, which will give an opportunity to wipe out the enmity he has so long nourished against Liu Zhang, and that the reward of his remaining firmly on our side to the end will be that you will memorialize the Throne for the coveted title for him. This will make him order Ma Chao to return, and, when that is done, I shall find a means of winning him over.” Liu Bei wrote a letter and sent it by the hand of Sun Qian together with gold and pearls. Sun Qian went by secret roads to give these to Yang Song. And when he found Yang Song and explained his mission in private, he was quickly led into the presence of Zhang Lu. “How can Liu Bei memorialize the Throne to confer on me the rank of a prince when he is but a simple General himself?” asked Zhang Lu, when he understood the offer and its conditions. “He is an Imperial Uncle;” said Yang Song, “with such a rank he could present such a memorial.” Zhang Lu assented. He sent orders to Ma Chao to cease fighting, and Sun Qian remained as the guest of Yang Song till he should see whether Ma Chao would obey the command."

When they saw Weibin's embankment being prepared, they told the generals, ""This must be Sima Yi. Now that the camp is short of food, I have repeatedly sent people to urge Li Yan to transport rice to deal with it, but only I don’t know if the wheat in Longshang is cooked, so I can secretly lead troops to cut it.” So four generals, Wang Ping, Zhang Yi, Wu Ban, and Wu Yi were left to guard the Qishan camp. Kong Ming led Jiang Wei, Wei Yan and other generals to the Halo City. The prefect of Lucheng, who knew Kongming well, hurriedly opened the city and surrendered. After consoling, Kong Ming asked, ""Where is the wheat cooked at this time?"" The prefect said, ""The wheat in Longshang is already cooked."" Come. The former army reported, ""Sima Yi is here to lead his troops."" Kong Ming was shocked and said, ""This person foresaw that I would come to harvest wheat!"" You showered and changed clothes, and pushed three four-wheeled vehicles, all of which had to be decorated in the same way— This car was built in advance by Kongming in the middle of Shu. Jiang Wei was ordered to lead a thousand troops to escort the chariots, and five hundred troops to beat drums, and lie behind Shanggui; Ma Dai was on the left and Wei Yan was on the right. In each car, twenty-four people, clothed and slack, with swords in their hair, and seven-star soap banners in their hands, pushed the car on the left and right. The three of them were persuaded and led their troops to push their carts away. Kong Ming also ordered 30,000 troops to hold sickles and ropes, and wait for the harvesting of wheat. Twenty-four strong men were chosen, all dressed in soapy clothes, with their hair and feet slammed, and surrounded by four-wheeled carts with swords, as messengers for pushing carts. After Guan Xing finished making the canopy appearance, he held the seven-star soap banner and walked in front of the car. Kong Ming sat on the top, looking for Wei Ying to come.","Sima Yi realizes that Kong Ming is going to need supplies, especially of grain, and that therefore he will force the Qishan pass and seize the grain fields of Longxi. Kong Ming easily takes the city of Lucheng close to the grain fields and then moves forward to the main area of Longshang close by the grain fields, only to find Sima Yi already there. But Kong Ming has expected this and now puts his own plan into action. He has had created three exact replicas of his famous carriage, and into these he puts dummies of himself, very lifelike indeed. Alongside each of the carriages walk twenty-four men dressed all in black and barefooted – like followers of some strange cult. He has the same arrangement for his own carriage but adds to this Guan Xing, dressed as an occult local deity figure.","When Zhuge Liang reached Qishan and had settled his army in camp, he saw that the bank of River Wei had been fortified by his enemy. “That must be the work of Sima Yi,” remarked Zhuge Liang to his generals. “But we have not enough food in camp. I have written to Li Yan to send grain, but it has not yet arrived. The wheat in Xizhou is now just ripe, and we will go and reap it.” Leaving Wang Ping, Zhang Ni, Wu Ban, and Wu Yi to guard for the camps, Zhuge Liang, with Wei Yan, Jiang Wei, and several other generals, went over to Lucheng. The Governor of that city knew he could not offer any real defense, so he opened the gates and yielded. After calming the people, Zhuge Liang asked, “Where is the ripe wheat to be found?” The Governor replied, “Longshang is the place.” So Zhang Yi and Ma Zhong were left to guard the city, and the remainder of the army went to Longshang. But soon the leading body returned to say, “Sima Yi has already occupied that city.” “He guessed what I intended to do,” said Zhuge Liang, taken aback. Zhuge Liang then retired, bathed and put on another dress. Next he bade them bring out three four-wheeled chariots, all exactly alike, that were among the impedimenta of the army. They had been built in Shu some time before. Jiang Wei was told off to lead a thousand troops as escort for one chariot, and five hundred drummers were appointed to accompany it. The chariot with its escort and drummers was sent away behind the city. In like manner two other chariots were equipped and sent east and west of the city under Ma Dai and Wei Yan. Each chariot was propelled by a team of twenty-four men, all dressed in black, barefooted and with loosened hair. Each one of the team also had in hand a sword and a black seven-starred flag. While the chariots were taking up their positions, thirty thousand soldiers were ordered to prepare wagons and sickles to cut and carry away the grain. Next Zhuge Liang selected twenty-four good soldiers, whom he dressed and armed like those sent away with the three chariots. These were to push his own chariot. Guan Xing was told to dress up as the God of Clouds and to walk in front of Zhuge Liang's chariot holding a black seven-starred flag. These preparations complete, Zhuge Liang mounted, and the chariot took the road toward the Wei camp."

A later poem praised:","Guan Lu tells him not to be worried – that these were simple tricks of dark magic – and from that moment on Cao Cao revives. He then asks Guan Lu to cast the fortune for the empire, his own lineage and his own personal fortune. But Guan Lu is circumscribed in how much he foretells, not wishing to offend Heaven. On the empire he has this to say: ‘Three and eight run across; a yellow pig meets the tiger; the expedition to the south loses you a limb.’ When he is asked to read the fortune for Shu and Wu, Guan Lu says, ‘The south has lost its chief, and the west has gone on the attack.’ Cao Cao doesn’t believe him, but then news comes that Lu Su has died and that Xuande has sent Zhang Fei and Ma Chao to capture the pass at Xiabian.","Cao Cao was greatly glad. Guan Lu was sent for and came. As soon as the salutations were over, Cao Cao asked him to cast lots for him. Guan Lu at once found the cause and said, “The illness is only due to magical machinations; it should not create anxiety.” Cao Cao was much relieved in his mind, and his health began to improve. Next Cao Cao wished to know about the conditions in the empire's affairs. After the necessary calculations the prophet said, “Three and eight cross; the yellow boar meets the tiger; the southern expedition causes the loss of one limb.” Then Cao Cao asked him to inquire whether his life should be long or not. Guan Lu replied, “Lion in the Palace to preserve the talents of ancestors: the Prince's way is securely renewed, and his son and grandson shall come to high honor.” Then Cao Cao asked concerning himself. “Divination concerning the fate of the universe may not be foreknown; wait a time and I will look into it.” Cao Cao was pleased and would like to keep such a man near him, so he offered him the post of historiographer (who was also soothsayer) at his court, but it was declined. “My destiny is mean, my luck despicable; I am not equal to such an office and dare not undertake it,” said Guan Lu. “Why not?” said Cao Cao. “My forehead has no lofty fullness; my eyes no steady expression; my nose no bridge; my feet no round, solid heels; my back lacks the triple armor (of shoulder blades and intervening muscles); and my breast the three marks (like the character indicating wealth). I can only control evil spirits securely; I cannot rule living humans.” “What think you of my physiognomy?” “What can a minister of extremely exalted rank like yourself desire further?” said Guan Lu. Cao Cao pressed him to say; the soothsayer only laughed. Then Cao Cao asked him to look at the many officers of all kinds standing around. “Every one of them is a servant equal to the administration of the empire,” said Guan Lu. But when Cao Cao asked whether good or bad fortune was to be his, the soothsayer would not give a clear and full reply. A poem says:"

After Sun Quan listened to it, he accepted the two of them, and said to the officials, ""Now that Liu Xuande has taken the throne, he has commanded over 700,000 elite soldiers, and he is very powerful. What can he do about it?"" Zhuge Jin went out and said, ""A certain food prince has been paid for a long time; there is no repayment, so I would like to give up the rest of my life and go to see the Lord of Shu, so that the two countries can be reconciled, and the crime of Cao Pi will be punished."" Quan was overjoyed and sent him away. Zhuge Jin, as an envoy, told the First Sovereign to stop his troops. Exactly:","While all this is happening, Fan Jiang and Zhang Da bring the head of Zhang Fei to Sun Quan. Turning to address his ministers, Sun Quan says, ‘Having seized the imperial throne, Xuande is now advancing to attack us with over seven hundred thousand troops. What are we to do?’ Fear shows on the faces of all the ministers, and then Zhuge Jin steps forward. ‘I’ve always wished to fully serve my lord, so let me go regardless of the dangers to meet Xuande and try to persuade him to see that he should be friends with us so that we can together deal with this traitor Cao Pi.’ Needless to say, Sun Quan is delighted by this offer. A man went to meet the warriors, Peace lies in the gift of this messenger.","In the meantime the two assassins, with the grim evidence of their deed, duly reached Wu and told their story to the Marquis who received them. Then Sun Quan said to his assembled officers, “Liu Bei has declared himself Emperor and is leading against us in person a great host of more than seven hundred thousand. What shall we do, for the danger is imminent?” They all turned pale and looked one at another. Then Zhuge Jin spoke out. “I have been in your service these many years and have never justified the favor you have shown me. I will risk my life and go to this Liu Bei of Shu that I may talk to him plainly and prove to him the advantages of friendship and alliance against Cao Pi.” This offer pleased Sun Quan, who then appointed Zhuge Jin as his messenger to try to induce the First Ruler to keep the peace.

The people of the two rivers, Xinle Taiping, do not close the house at night, and do not pick up things on the road. It is also fortunate that the old and the young are full of accolades, and whenever there is an emergency, they scramble to do it early: Therefore, all the things used for military equipment and equipment are complete;","In Chengdu, capital city of Shu, Kong Ming has taken full responsibility for the affairs of state. As a result, the kingdom is at peace; everyone is happy and well fed; all are willing to shoulder their share of responsibilities. In the year of AD 225 news comes of a revolt in the southern borderlands.","Tranquillity prevailed, and the state of society was well nigh perfect: doors unbolted at night, property left by the roadside remaining untouched till the owner returned for it. Moreover, the harvests were rich year after year, and old and young, with fair, round bellies, well lined, simply sang with joy. The people hastened to fulfill their state duties and vied with each other in the performance of all arts. As a natural consequence all military preparations were perfect, the granaries bursting with grain and the treasury full to overflowing."
却說曹仁見關公落馬，卽引兵衝出城來；被關平一陣殺回，救關公歸寨，拔出臂箭。原來箭頭有藥，毒已入骨，右臂靑腫，不能運動。關平慌與衆將商議曰：“父親若損此臂，安能出敵？不如暫回荊州調理。”於是與衆將入帳見關公。公問曰：“汝等來有何事？”衆對曰：“某等因見君侯右臂損傷，恐臨敵致怒，衝突不便。衆議可暫班師回荊州調理。”公怒曰：“吾取樊城，只在目前；取了樊城，卽當長驅大進，逕到許都，剿滅操賊，以安漢室。豈可因小瘡而誤大事？汝等敢慢吾軍心耶！”平等默然而退。,"But he said that Cao Ren saw Guan Gong fall from his horse, and he led his troops out of the city. It turned out that the arrow had medicine, and the poison had penetrated into the bones. The right arm was swollen and could not move. Guan Ping panicked and discussed with the generals: ""If my father loses this arm, will he be able to attack the enemy? Why don't he return to Jingzhou for a while to recuperate."" The duke asked, ""What are you doing here?"" The crowd replied, ""Because you saw the right arm of the lord and marquis injured, you are afraid that you will be angry with the enemy, and the conflict will be inconvenient. It is suggested that you can temporarily return to Jingzhou for conditioning."" The public said in anger: "" I will take Fancheng only at the moment; if I take Fancheng, I will drive a great advance, go straight to Xudu, annihilate the thieves, and secure the Han family. How can I make a big mistake because of a small sore? You dare to slow down my army!"" Equality! Retire silently.","Seeing Guan Yu fall, Cao Ren charges out of the city, but too late. Guan Ping has come to the rescue of his father and defends him against further attacks until he is safely back in the camp. There, it is clear that the arrow was poisoned and that infection has spread rapidly. Being Guan Yu, he refuses both treatment and the proposal that they retreat so he can rest. Knowing that if Guan Yu dies, the troops will lose all hope, the best possible medical treatment is sought. But there is no one skilled enough to deal with such poison.","At the sight of Guan Yu falling from his charger, Cao Ren led his army out of the city to follow up with an attack, but Guan Ping drove him off and escorted his father back to camp. There the arrow was extracted, but the arrow head had been poisoned. The wound was deep, and the poison had penetrated to the bone. The right arm was discolored and swollen and useless. Guan Ping consulted with the other leaders and proposed, saying, “As fighting is impossible for the moment, we should withdraw to Jingzhou, where my father's wound can be treated.” Having decided upon this, they went to see the wounded warrior. “What have you come for?” asked Guan Yu when they entered. “Considering that you, Sir, have been wounded in the right arm, we fear the result of the excitement of battle. Moreover, you can hardly take part in a fight just now, and we therefore propose that the army retire till you are recovered.” Guan Yu replied angrily, “I am on the point of taking the city, and if I succeed, I must press forward to Capital Xuchang, and destroy that brigand Cao Cao, so that the Hans may be restored to their own. Think you that I can vitiate the whole campaign because of a slight wound? Would you dishearten the army?” Guan Ping and his colleagues said no more, but somewhat unwillingly withdrew."

Kong Ming went out of the city, gathered the victorious soldiers, entered the city to reward the laborers, and suddenly reported to Yongan that Li Yan had a letter of emergency. Kong Ming was shocked and opened the package to see it.

The troops of Shu followed, pressing on them till corpses littered the whole plain and blood flowed in runnels. It was a victory for Zhuge Liang, and he came out to welcome the victors and led them into the city and distributed rewards.

Xuande called in to ask him. He was from Jianning Yuyuan: surnamed Li, given name Hui, and styled Deang. Xuande said: ""I heard from the sun that the Duke was bitterly admonishing Liu Zhang, why did you return to me now?"" Hui said: ""I heard: 'Beautiful birds live in trees, and worthy ministers choose their masters.' The heart of the minister; if you can’t use it, you will lose if you know it. Now the general Rende is deployed in Shu, and the governor will succeed, so he will return to his ear.” Xuande said: “Sir, coming here will definitely benefit Liu Bei.” Hui said: “Now I heard that Ma Chao was in a dilemma. He was in Longxi, and had a relationship with him. I would like to go and say that Ma Chao has returned, what if?"" Kong Ming said, ""I want to get someone to go there for me. I would like to hear the words of the prince."" Li Huiyu Kong Ming's ear said so and so.

It is he whom Kong Ming sends with the offer of help if Ma Chao will serve Xuande.","At this juncture a messenger came with letters from Zhao Yun. Liu Bei called him in and questioned him. He was Li Hui of Jianning, the man who had formerly remonstrated so earnestly with Liu Zhang. “You once pleaded with your master to keep me out; why are you here now?” “Because the prudent bird chooses its perch and the wise person his master. I did attempt to dissuade Liu Zhang of Yiazhou from a course which I felt to be disastrous, and thereby fulfilled my duty as his servant. He rejected my counsel, and I knew he would fail. Your liberality, O General, has won over all the region, and success must be yours. I wish to serve under your banner.” “Your services will surely be of great advantage to me, Sir,” said Liu Bei. Then Li Hui began to talk of Ma Chao, “I knew him when we were in Longxi together. He is now in great straits, and I may be able to talk him over. What say you?” “Just the man to go instead of me,” interjected Zhuge Liang. “But what arguments will you use?” Li Hui leaned over and whispered in his ear thus and thus. What he said seemed to please Zhuge Liang mightily, and he was bidden to go forthwith."

Xuande said, ""The mountain road is dangerous, how can there be no military resistance, long drive and great advance, and come here first? Zhang Fei said, ""Forty-five places on the road pass are all made by veteran general Yan Yan; therefore, I didn't make any effort on the road."" Xuande. Xuande thanked him and said, ""If it wasn't for the old general, would my brother An be able to come here?"" Thanks Yan Yan.

Zhang Fei heard this, so he asked Xuande to divide his troops and kill them to rescue. So Zhang Fei was on the left, Xuande was on the right, and Xia Ben came forward. When Wu Yi and Liu Wei saw the shouting from behind, they panicked and retreated into the city. Wu Lan and Lei Tong pursued Huang Zhong and Wei Yan with their troops, but were stopped by Xuan De and Zhang Fei. Huang Zhong and Wei Yan returned to their horses to attack again. Wu Lan and Lei Tong were unable to resist, so they had to send their troops to surrender. Xuande allowed him to surrender, and withdrew his troops near the city and built the village.","But not long after Yan Yan arrives with the bulk of the army, and, seeing this, Zhang Ren turns and flees, with Zhang Fei in hot pursuit right up to the city wall.","Then Zhang Fei returned to his elder brother to report his arrival and the incidents of the way. Hearing that Zhuge Liang had not yet arrived, Zhang Fei rejoiced, saying, “So I have the credit of first arrival although he is traveling by river.” Liu Bei said, “But how is it you have come so quickly seeing the precipitous road you had to travel? Did you meet no opposition?” Zhang Fei replied, “The fact is I have taken the forty-five garrisons on the way by making use of General Yan Yan, whom I captured. It was not my own merit at all. I have come all the way without the least effort.” Zhang Fei told the story of Yan Yan's capture and services from beginning to end, and then presented the man himself. Liu Bei said, “General, my brother's speedy arrival is certainly owing to your help.” Whereupon Liu Bei took off the golden chain mantle he was wearing and gave it to his new ally. Orders were given for a banquet. While it was being prepared, a messenger came to report, saying, “Huang Zhong and Wei Yan had been fighting with Wu Lan and Lei Tong and had held their own, till enemy reinforcements led by Wu Yi and Liu Gui arrived. Huang Zhong and Wei Yan then fled eastward.” Zhang Fei at once asked his brother to go with him to rescue them. Both went. When Wu Yi and Liu Gui saw the army of Jingzhou coming, they retired into the city. Wu Lan and Lei Tong continued the pursuit. The coming of Liu Bei and Zhang Fei threatened their rear, and Huang Zhong and Wei Yan turned and recommenced the battle. Wu Lan and Lei Tong were thus between two fires and helpless. They offered to surrender and were received. Liu Bei returned to his own camp near the city."

Next he sent for Wang Ping and Ma Zhong, and said to them, “I cannot send Zhao Yun and Wei Yan against the Mangs because they do not know the country. You two are to go, one against each wing, and the two veteran warriors shall support you. Get your troops ready and start tomorrow at dawn.” Wang Ping and Ma Zhong took the orders and went out. Then Zhang Yi and Zhang Ni were given orders: “You two are to march against the center army; you are to act with Wang Ping and Ma Zhong tomorrow. I want to send Zhao Yun and Wei Yan, but I am still afraid they do not know the country well.” Zhang Yi and Zhang Ni also received the orders and went out."

As long as the arrow sore was healed, he wanted to enter the army. Xun Cha knew and prepared the details, and the police sent a message to Sun Quan in the starry night. Sun Quan called Lü Meng for a discussion and said, ""Now that Yun Changguo has withdrawn the troops from Jingzhou and captured Fancheng, he can plan to attack Jingzhou. How about you and my brother Sun Jiao lead the army there together?"" and also. Meng said: ""If the lord can use Meng, you can use Meng alone; if you can use Shuming, you can use Shuming alone. Don't you hear that Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu were the governors of the left and right in the past, and although things depended on Yu, Pu will use his old ministers instead. Living under Yu, I am not in harmony with each other. Later, when I saw Yu’s talent, I began to respect it? Now Meng’s talent is not as good as Yu, and Shuming’s relatives are better than Pu, so I am afraid that they may not be able to help each other.”","His spies tell him that Guan Yu has indeed been fooled and has moved his troops to the siege of Fancheng. Here, he is biding his time until his wound has fully recovered before launching his assault. When news of this reaches Sun Quan, he commissions Lü Meng to lead the attack on Jingzhou.","Spies were sent out to report on proceedings, and they returned to say that half the troops of Jingzhou had been sent to assist in the siege of Fankou. That city was to be seriously assaulted as soon as Guan Yu had recovered. This news was promptly sent on to Sun Quan, who at once called in Lu Meng to decide upon the next move. “Now is the favorable moment to get possession of Jingzhou,” said Sun Quan. “I propose to send you and my brother, Sun Jiao, to lead the army.” This Sun Jiao was really only a cousin, as he was the second son of Sun Quan's uncle, Sun Jing. But Lu Meng objected. “My lord, if you think to employ me, then employ me only; if Sun Jiao, then Sun Jiao only. You cannot have forgotten that Zhou Yu and Cheng Pu were associate commanders, and although the final decision lay with Zhou Yu, yet the other presumed upon his seniority and there was some unfriendliness between the two. All ended well because Cheng Pu recognized the ability of his colleague and so supported him. I know I am not so clever as Zhou Yu, but Sun Jiao's consanguinity will be a greater obstacle than mere length of service, and I fear he may not be wholly with me.”"

Jia Chong said, ""Why didn't the lord seal the bell to control it? Zhao followed his proposal and sent the envoy Xiu Zhao to appoint Hui as Situ, and he ordered Wei Kuan to supervise the two-way army and horses, and paid Kuan with a handwritten letter, so that the attendees would watch over Deng Ai to prevent him from changing.

Sima Zhao accepted the suggestion and issued an edict raising Zhong Hui to Minister of the Interior. After this the Inspector of the Forces, Wei Guan, was set over both armies, with special orders to keep a watch upon Deng Ai and guard against any attempt at insubordination.

Rui unfolded on the royal bed and watched with Sima Yi. Yi Zuo said: ""This statement is very reasonable, and Wu should be destroyed. This minister is willing to lead an army to help Cao Xiu."" Suddenly one of the class entered and said, ""The words of the Wu people are repeated over and over again, and I cannot be convinced. , will not surrender. This is a special trick to lure soldiers."" Everyone looked at it, and it was Jianwei General Jia Kui. Yi said, ""You must not ignore this statement, and you must not miss the opportunity."" Lord Wei said, ""Zhong Da and Jia Kui can help Cao Xiu together."" The two of them took orders to finish. So Cao Xiu led the army to take the city of Anhui; Jia Kui led the former general Man Chong and the governor of Dongguan, Hu Zhi, to take Yangcheng and go straight to Dongguan; Sima Yi led the army to take Jiangling.","This is reported to Sima Yi and Cao Rui, who start to discuss again plans for a possible attack on Shu. It is at this point that a letter comes from Cao Xiu, commander of the Wei army in Yangzhou. He informs the emperor that the Wu governor of Poyang, by name Zhou Fang, has written secretly, offering to surrender his region to Wei and asking for troops to come to enable this to take place.","The Ruler of Wei accepted the recommendation, and an edict went forth promoting Hao Zhao to General Who Guards the West, and sending him to command in the county of Chencang. Soon after this edict was issued, a memorial was received from Cao Xiu, Minister of War and Commander of Yangzhou, saying that Zhou Fang, the Wu Governor of Poyang, wished to tender his submission and transfer his allegiance, and had sent a man to present a memorandum under seven headings showing how the power of the South Land could be broken and to ask that an army be dispatched soon. Cao Rui spread the document out on the couch that he and Sima Yi might read it. “It seems very reasonable,” said Sima Yi. “Wu could be quite destroyed. Let me go with an army to help Cao Xiu.” But from among the courtiers stepped out Jia Kui, who said, “What this man of Wu says may be understood in two ways; do not trust it. Zhou Fang is a wise and crafty man and very unlikely to desert. In this is some ruse to decoy our soldiers into danger.” “Such words also must be listened to,” said Sima Yi. “Yet such a chance must not be missed.” “You and he might both go to the help of Cao Xiu,” said the Ruler of Wei. Sima Yi and Jia Kui went. A large army, led by Cao Xiu, moved to Huancheng. Jia Kui, assisted by General Man Chong and Governor Hu Zhi of Dongwan, marched to capture Yangcheng, and facing the East Pass. Sima Yi led the third army to Jiangling."
却說吳王見張温入蜀未還，乃聚文武商議。忽近臣奏曰：“蜀遣鄧芝同張温入國答禮。”權召入。張温拜於殿前，備稱後主、孔明之德，願求永結盟好，特遣鄧尚書又來答禮。權大喜，乃設宴待之。權問鄧芝曰：“若吳、蜀二國同心滅魏，得天下太平，二主分治，豈不樂乎？”芝答曰：“‘天無二日，民無二王’。如滅魏之後，未識天命所歸何人。但為君者，各修其德；為臣者，各盡其忠，則戰爭方息耳。”權大笑曰：“君之誠款，乃如是耶！”遂厚贈鄧芝還蜀。自此吳、蜀通好。,"However, it was said that the King of Wu saw that Zhang Wen had entered Shu and had not returned, so he gathered with Wen and Wu to discuss. Suddenly a close official said: ""Shu sent Deng Zhi and Zhang Wen to enter the country to answer the ceremony."" Quan summoned him. Zhang Wen worshipped in front of the hall, claiming to be the queen of the throne, the virtue of Kong Ming, wishing for a good alliance forever, and specially dispatched Deng Shangshu to answer the ceremony. Quan was overjoyed and set a banquet for him. Quan asked Deng Zhi and said, ""Wouldn't it be fun if the two kingdoms of Wu and Shu were united in destroying Wei, and the world would be peaceful, and the two rulers would be divided into rule?"" After the Wei Dynasty was destroyed, I didn't know who the mandate of Heaven belonged to. But those who are monarchs should cultivate their virtues; those who are ministers should be loyal to each other, and then the war will stop."" Quan laughed and said: ""The sincerity of the monarch is like this. Yay!"" Then he gave Deng Zhi a generous gift to return to Shu. From then on, Wu and Shu communicated well.",Kong Ming agrees with the second ruler that if Deng Zhi returns with an envoy from Wu then they will forge an alliance against Wei.,"Then Deng Zhi was ordered to return to Wu and thank its ruler for his courtesy, and he was to accompany Zhang Wen. So both, having taken leave of the Prime Minister, set out on their journey to the east. In the meantime Sun Quan was beginning to feel perplexed at the long delay of his envoy. He had summoned a council to discuss this question, when the report came that his own envoy had returned, and Deng Zhi was with him. They were brought in forthwith; and Zhang Wen, having made his obeisance, began to discourse upon the virtue of the Ruler of Shu and Zhuge Liang and to lay before his lord the proposal for a league of peace. Deng Zhi, the Chair of the Secretariat, was empowered to discuss this matter. Turning to Deng Zhi, Sun Quan said, “Would it not be a happy result if tranquillity should be restored to the empire by the destruction of Wei, and Wu and Shu should share its administration?” “The sky knows not two suns,” replied Deng Zhi, “nor can the people recognize two kings. If Wei be destroyed, no one can say upon whom the divine command will devolve. But one who becomes a prince must perfect his virtue, and those who become ministers must be wholly loyal. In this way strife will cease.” Sun Quan smiled, saying, “And your sincerity is beyond question.” Deng Zhi was dismissed with rich gifts, and after this Wu and Shu were good friends."
延大喜，遂同馬岱引兵直取南鄭。姜維在南鄭城上，見魏延、馬岱耀武揚威，風擁而來。維急令拽起弔橋。延、岱二人，大叫：“早降！”姜維令人請楊儀商議曰：“魏延勇猛，更兼馬岱相助，雖然軍少，何計退之？”儀曰：“丞相臨終，遺一錦囊，囑曰：‘若魏延造反，臨城對敵之時，方可開拆，便有斬魏延之計。’今當取出一看。”遂出錦囊拆開看時，題曰：“待與魏延對敵，馬上方許拆開。”維大喜曰：“旣丞相有戒約，長史可收執。吾先引兵出城，列為陣勢，公可便來。”姜維披挂上馬，綽鎗在手，引三千軍，開了城門，一齊衝出，鼓聲大震，排成陣勢。維挺鎗立馬於門旗之下，高聲大罵曰：“反賊魏延！丞相不曾虧你，今日如何背反？”延橫刀勒馬而言曰：“伯約：不干你事。只敎楊儀來！”儀在門旗影裏，拆開錦囊視之，如此如此。儀大喜，輕騎而出，立馬陣前，手指魏延而笑曰：“丞相在日，知汝久後必反，敎我隄備，今果應其言。汝敢在馬上連叫三聲‘誰敢殺我’，便是眞大丈夫，吾就獻漢中城池與汝。”延大笑曰：“楊儀匹夫聽着！若孔明在日，吾尚懼他三分；他今已亡，天下誰敢敵我？休道連叫三聲，便叫三萬聲，亦有何難？”遂提刀按轡，於馬上大叫曰：“誰敢殺我？”一聲未畢，腦後一人厲聲而應曰：“吾敢殺你！”手起刀落，斬魏延於馬下。衆皆駭然：斬魏延者，乃馬岱也。原來孔明臨終之時，授馬岱以密計，只待魏延喊叫時，便出其不意斬之；當日楊儀讀罷錦囊，已知伏下馬岱在彼，故依計而行，果然殺了魏延。後人有詩曰：,"Yan was overjoyed, so he led troops with Ma Dai to take Nanzheng directly. Jiang Wei was on the city of Nanzheng, and when he saw Wei Yan and Ma Dai showing off their might, the wind rushed in. The emergency order pulled up the suspension bridge. Yan and Dai shouted: ""Early come down!"" Jiang Wei asked Yang Yi to discuss it and said, ""Wei Yan is brave, and he also helps Ma Dai. Although the army is small, why should he retreat?"" Yi said: ""The prime minister is dying, leaving one The kit said: 'If Wei Yan rebels and confronts the enemy in the city, you can open it, and there is a plan to kill Wei Yan.' ""When we confront Wei Yan, let's open it up immediately."" Wei Daxi said: ""The prime minister has a precept, and the long history can accept it. I will lead the troops out of the city first, and put them in the formation, and the public can come."" The horses, with their spears in their hands, led three thousand troops, opened the city gate, and rushed out together, the drums roaring loudly, and they formed a formation. Wei Ting gun immediately under the door flag, shouted loudly: ""Rebel Wei Yan! The prime minister has never wronged you, how can you turn your back today?"" Teach Yang Yi to come!"" In the shadow of the door flag, Yi opened the bag and looked at it, and so on. Yi was overjoyed, lightly rode out, and immediately pointed his finger at Wei Yan and smiled, saying: ""The prime minister is in the sun, I know that you will rebel after a long time, and teach me to prepare the embankment, and now I will answer my words. You dare to call three times in a row, 'Who is it?' If you dare to kill me, you are the real man, and I will dedicate the Hanzhong city to you."" Yan laughed and said, ""Yang Yifu, listen! If Kongming were in the sun, I would still fear him for three points; he is dead now, who in the world would dare to Enemy me? Huo Dao called three times in a row, and then called thirty thousand times, what's the difficulty?"" He took up the knife and pressed the bridle, and immediately shouted, ""Who dares to kill me?"" He replied, ""I dare to kill you!"" He raised his sword and fell, and cut Wei Yan off his horse. Everyone was astonished: the one who killed Wei Yan was Ma Dai. It turned out that when Kongming was dying, he gave Ma Dai a secret plan, and only when Wei Yan shouted, he killed him unexpectedly; that day Yang Yi finished reading the kit and knew that Ma Dai was there, so he followed the plan and killed Wei Yan. A later poem says:","Encouraged by this, they first attack Nanzheng, where Jiang Wei is already ensconced along with Yang Yi. Profoundly worried about how to deal with this, Jiang Wei asks Yang Yi for advice. ‘As he was dying,’ he says, ‘Kong Ming gave me this silk bag to be opened when Wei Yan rebelled.’ So saying, he opens the bag and reads the cover of the envelope. It says, ‘Only to be opened when you confront Wei Yan.’ So, armed with this, Yang Yi follows Jiang Wei out of the city gates to confront Wei Yan and Ma Dai. Jiang Wei shouts his defiance at Wei Yan, who replies, ‘This doesn’t involve you, Jiang Wei. It’s Yang Yi I have come to fight.’ In the shadow of the gateway Yang Yi opens the letter left by Kong Ming and then rides out to be beside Jiang Wei, confronting Wei Yan and Ma Dai. ‘Your betrayal was predicted by Kong Ming,’ he says. ‘However, if you can shout, “Who will dare kill me?” three times, I will know you for a true warrior and will surrender Hanzhong to you.’ Roaring with laughter, Wei Yan says, ‘Listen to me, you pathetic coward. I was only partially afraid of Kong Ming when he was alive. Now he is dead, who is there to fear? Eh? Answer me that! I’ll shout this not just three times, but thirty thousand times – as if frankly this was of any importance!’ So saying, and holding his sword in the air, he shouts, ‘Who will dare kill me?’ Before the shout fades away, a voice comes from behind him: ‘I dare kill you!’ A sword flashes through the air, and Wei Yan falls dead from his horse. And who killed Wei Yan? Ma Dai, for Kong Ming told him before he died that when he heard Wei Yan shout, ‘Who will dare kill me?’ that was the signal to slay him. As a poet has written:","So they marched together toward Nanzheng, where was Jiang Wei. From the bridge Jiang Wei saw their approach and marked their proud, martial look. He ordered the drawbridge to be raised and sent to tell his colleague, Yang Yi. As they drew near, both Wei Yan and Ma Dai shouted out, “Surrender!” In spite of the smallness of their following, Jiang Wei felt that Ma Dai acting with Wei Yan was a dangerous combination, and he wanted the advice of Yang Yi. “Wei Yan is valorous, and he is having the help of Ma Dai. How shall we repel them?” asked Jiang Wei. Yang Yi replied, “Just before his death, the Prime Minister gave me a silken bag, which he said I was to open when Wei Yan's mutiny reached a critical point. It contains a plan to rid ourselves of this traitor, and it seems that now is the moment to see what should be done.” So Yang Yi opened the bag and drew forth the letter it held. On the cover he read, “To be opened when Wei Yan is actually arrayed opposite you.” Said Jiang Wei, “As this has all been arranged for, I would better go out, and when his line is formed then you can come forth.” Jiang Wei donned his armor, took his spear, and rode out, with three thousand troops. They marched out of the city gates with the drums beating. The array completed, Jiang Wei took his place under the great standard and opened with a volley of abuse. “Rebel Wei Yan, the late Prime Minister never harmed you; why have you turned traitor?” Wei Yan reined up, lowered his sword and replied, “ Friend Jiang Wei, this is no concern of yours; tell Yang Yi to come.” Now Yang Yi was also beneath the standard, but hidden. He opened the letter, and the words therein seemed to please him, for he rode forward blithely. Presently he reined in, pointed to Wei Yan and said, “The Prime Minister foresaw your mutiny and bade me be on my guard. Now if you are able thrice to shout, 'Who dares kill me?', then you will be a real hero, and I will yield to you the whole of Hanzhong.” Wei Yan laughed. “Listen, you old fool! While Zhuge Liang lived I feared him somewhat. But he is dead and no one dares stand before me. I will not only shout the words thrice, but a myriad times. Why not?” Wei Yan raised his sword, shook his bridle, and shouted, “Who dares kill me?” He never finished. Behind him someone shouted savagely, “I dare kill you!” and at the same moment Wei Yan fell dead, cut down by Ma Dai. This was the denouement, and was the secret entrusted to Ma Dai just before Zhuge Liang's death. Wei Yan was to be made to shout these words and slain when he least expected it. Yang Yi knew what was to happen, as it was written in the letter in the silken bag. A poem says:"

這消息播入漢中，早驚動了漢寧太守張魯。原來張魯乃沛國豐人。其祖張陵在西川鵠鳴山中造作道書以惑人，人皆敬之。陵死之後，其子張衡行之。百姓但有學道者，助米五斗，世號“米賊”。張衡死，張魯行之。魯在漢中自號為“師君”；其來學道者皆號為“鬼卒”；為首者號為“祭酒”；領衆多者號為“治頭大祭酒”。務以誠信為主，不許欺詐。如有病者，卽設壇使病人居於靜室之中，自思己過，當面陳首，然後為之祈禱；主祈禱之事者，號為“姦令祭酒”。祈禱之法，書病人姓名，說服罪之意，作文三通，名為“三官手書”：一通放於山頂以奏天，一通埋於地以奏地，一通沈於水以申水官。如此之後，但病痊可，將米五斗為謝。又蓋義舍：舍內飯米、柴火、肉食齊備，許過往人量食多少，自取而食；多取者受天誅。境內有犯法者，必恕三次；不改者，然後施刑。所在並無官長，盡屬祭酒所管。如此雄據漢中之地已三十年。國家以為地遠不能征伐，就命魯為鎮南中郎將，領漢寧太守，通進貢而已。當年聞操破西涼之衆，威震天下，乃聚衆商議曰：“西涼馬騰遭戮，馬超新敗，曹操必將侵我漢中。我欲自稱為漢寧王，督兵拒曹操，諸軍以為何如？”閻圃曰：“漢川之民，戶出十萬餘衆，財富糧足，四面險固；今馬超新敗，西涼之兵，從子午谷奔入漢中者，不下數萬。愚意益州劉璋昏弱，不如先取西川四十一州為本，然後稱王未遲。”張魯大喜，遂與弟張衞商議起兵。早有細作報入川中。,"This news was broadcast in Hanzhong, and Zhang Lu, the prefect of Hanning, was already alerted. It turned out that Zhang Lu was a native of Pei Guofeng. His ancestor Zhang Ling made a Taoist book in Huming Mountain in Xichuan to confuse people, and everyone respected it. After Ling died, his son Zhang Heng acted. The common people, but there are those who learn Taoism, help rice five buckets, and are known as ""rice thieves"". Zhang Heng died, and Zhang Lu acted. Lu was called ""Master Master"" in Hanzhong; all those who came to learn Taoism were called ""Ghost Soldiers""; the leader was called ""Sacrificial Wine""; Integrity is the main business, and fraud is not allowed. If there is a sick person, an altar is set up so that the sick person can live in a quiet room, think about his own past, put his head in front of him, and then pray for it; those who pray for the Lord are called ""sacrifice wine for rape orders"". The method of prayer, the name of the patient, the meaning of persuading sin, the three links in the composition, called ""Three Official Handwriting"": one is placed on the top of the mountain to play the sky, the other is buried on the ground to play the ground, and the other is submerged in the water to declare the water officials. . After this, but the illness can be recovered, the rice is five buckets as a thank you. It also builds a righteous house: The house is fully equipped with rice, firewood, and meat. It is allowed that people in the past can eat as much as they want, and they can eat it themselves; those who take more will be punished by heaven. Those who violate the law in the territory will be forgiven three times; those who do not change will then be punished. There are no rulers there, but they are all under the control of the sacrificial wine. It has been so strong in Hanzhong for thirty years. The state thought that the land could not be conquered, so it ordered Lu to be the Zhonglang general of Zhennan, and led the prefect of Hanning to pay tribute. When I heard that Cao broke through the people of Xiliang and shook the world, they gathered together to discuss and said: ""Ma Teng in Xiliang was killed, Ma Chaoxin was defeated, Cao Cao will definitely invade Hanzhong. I want to call myself the king of Hanning, and the military governor rejects Cao Cao. Why do the armies behave like this?"" Yan Pu said: ""The people of Hanchuan have more than 100,000 households, rich and food, and are in danger on all sides; now Ma Chao has been defeated, and the soldiers of Xiliang have rushed into Hanzhong from Ziwu Valley. Tens of thousands. The foolish Yizhou Liu Zhang is weak, it is better to take the forty-one prefectures of Xichuan as the foundation, and then it is not too late to call the king."" Zhang Lu was overjoyed, so he discussed with his younger brother Zhang Wei to raise an army. There has been a detailed report into Sichuan.","News of what has happened spreads far and wide and reaches to the west to Hanzhong, where the governor, Zhang Lu, is deeply troubled. He is the grandson of Zhang [Dao] Ling, a Daoist master who went to meditate on Mount Huming in the western Riverlands of Shu. There, he wrote a book designed to fool the common folk into believing he had magical, even divine powers. The local people greatly respected him, and, after he died, his son Zhang Heng continued his tradition. Those wishing to study the Dao had to donate five bushels of rice. This earned him the nickname ‘Rice Thief’. When Zhang Heng died, Zhang Lu continued the tradition. Zhang Lu gave himself the title ‘supreme ruler’, while his followers were called ‘ghost fighters’. The headman was called ‘libationer’ while those in charge of large forces were called ‘lead healing libationer’. True sincerity was the core of this tradition; neither lying nor deception was permitted. If someone fell ill, an altar was created, and the sick person was brought to the Place of Silence, where they could reflect upon their sins which had caused this illness. Once this was articulated, prayers could be offered and overseen by the superintendent of libations. The prayers accompanied the written confession of the individual and three copies were made, entitled ‘The Petition to the Three Officials’. One was then put on top of a hill to reach Heaven, one was buried in the ground to reach Earth and one was thrown into water to reach the officials of the Underworld. After this, if the patient recovered, he or she donated five bushels of rice as a thanksgiving. Besides this, they also had public places where the poor could find free rice, meat and somewhere to cook. Everyone was allowed to take this for their honest needs, but any excess, it was believed, would bring down punishment from Heaven. Those who offended were given three pardons and after that they were punished. They had no officials, because everyone was governed by the libationers. In this way Hanzhong has been ruled for thirty years and has survived because they are too far away from the imperial court for anyone to particularly worry about them. Instead, the court simply gave Zhang Lu an imperial title of prefect and insisted that he send in the tax as usual. On hearing that Cao Cao has triumphed over the western army and is beginning to throw his weight around, Zhang Lu calls together his advisers. ‘ With Ma Teng murdered and Ma Chao in retreat, it’s inevitable that Cao Cao will next come after us. To pre-empt this I’m going to announce that I’m now the prince of Hanning and head the resistance. What do you think?’ His adviser Yan Pu replies, ‘The people of this region number more than one hundred thousand households. There’s considerable wealth and more than enough grain. We’re protected on four sides by natural defences. The defeat of Ma Chao has meant huge numbers of refugees have flooded into our area. In my honest opinion, Liu Zhang, governor of Yizhou, is a weak man. So I suggest we seize the forty-one departments of the western Riverlands and from there declare independence.’ Pleased with what he hears, Zhang Lu commissions his brother Zhang Wei to summon the army. It is not long before news of this uprising reaches the heartlands of Shu.","The fame of these doings penetrated west into Hanzhong, and one of the first to be moved to indignation was Zhang Lu, Governor of Hanning. This Zhang Lu was a native of Pei ((an ancient state)). He was a grandson of Zhang Ling who retired to Mount Humming, in the Eastern Land of Rivers, where he had composed a work on Taoism for the purpose of deluding the multitude. Yet all the people respected Zhang Ling, and when he died his son, Zhang Heng, carried on his work, and taught the same doctrines. Disciples had to pay a fee in rice, five carts. The people of his day called him the Rice Thief. Zhang Lu, his son, styled himself Master Superior, and his disciples were called Commonly Devil Soldiers. A headman was called Libationer, and those who made many converts were called Chief Libationers. Perfect sincerity was the ruling tenet of the cult, and no deceit was permitted. When any one fell ill, an altar was set up and the invalid was taken into the Room of Silence where he could reflect upon his sins and confess openly. Then he was prayed for. The director of prayers was called Superintending Libationer. When praying for a person, they wrote his name on a slip and his confession and made three copies thereof, called “The writing of the Three Gods.” One copy was burned on the mountain top as a means of informing Heaven; another was burned to inform Earth; and the third was sunk in water to tell the Controller of the Waters. If the sick person recovered, he paid as fee five carts of rice. They had Public Houses of Charity wherein the poor found rice and flesh and means of cooking. Any wayfarer was allowed to take of these according to the measure of his appetite. Those who took in excess would invite punishment from on high. Offenses were pardoned thrice; afterwards offenders were punished. They had no officials but all were subject to the control of the Libationers. This sort of cult had been spreading in Hanzhong for some thirty years and had escaped repression so far because of the remoteness of the region. All the Government did was to give Zhang Lu the title of General Who Guards the South and the post of Governor of Hanning and take means to secure from him a full quota of local tribute. When the reports of Cao Cao's success against the west, and his prestige and influence, reached the Hanzhong people, Zhang Lu met with his counselors, saying, “Ma Teng has died, and Ma Chao defeated, thus the northwest has fallen. Cao Cao's next ambition will be the southwest, and Hanzhong will be his first attack. I should act first by assuming the title of Prince of Hanzhong and superintending the defense.1” In reply one Yan Pu said, “The army of this region counts one hundred thousand, and there are ample supplies of everything. The Eastern Land of Rivers is a natural stronghold with its mountains and rivers. Now Ma Chao's soldiers are newly defeated, and the fugitives from the Ziwu Valley are very numerous. We can add them to our army by several ten-thousands more. My advice is that as Liu Zhang of Yiazhou is weak, we should take possession of the forty-one counties of the Western Land of Rivers, and then you may set up your sovereign as soon as you like.” This speech greatly pleased Zhang Lu, who then began to concert measures with his brother, Zhang Wei, to raise an army. Stories of the movement reached Yiazhou, whose Imperial Protector was Liu Zhang."
却說邊庭探知此事，報入洛陽。是日曹叡設朝，近臣奏曰：“邊官報稱：諸葛亮率領大兵三十餘萬，出屯漢中，令趙雲、鄧芝為前部先鋒，引兵入境。”叡大驚，問羣臣曰：“誰可為將，以退蜀兵？”忽一人應聲而出曰：“臣父死於漢中，切齒之恨，未嘗得報。今蜀兵犯境，臣願引本部猛將，更乞陛下賜關西之兵，前往破蜀：上為國家効力，下報父讎，臣萬死不恨！”衆視之，乃夏侯淵之子夏侯楙也。楙字子休；其性最急，又最吝；自幼嗣與夏侯惇為子。後夏侯淵為黃忠所斬，曹操憐之，以女淸河公主招楙為駙馬，因此朝中欽敬。雖掌兵權，未嘗臨陣。當時自請出征，曹叡卽命為大都督，調關西諸路軍馬前去迎敵。司徒王朗諫曰：“不可：夏侯駙馬素不曾經戰，今付以大任，非其所宜。更兼諸葛亮足智多謀，深通韜略，不可輕敵。”夏侯楙叱曰：“司徒莫非結連諸葛亮，欲為內應耶？吾自幼從父學習韜略，深通兵法。汝何欺我年幼？吾若不生擒諸葛亮，誓不回見天子！”王朗等皆不敢言。夏侯楙辭了魏主，星夜到長安，調關西諸路軍馬二十餘萬，來敵孔明。正是：,"But he said that Bian Ting found out about this and reported it to Luoyang. On the same day Cao Rui set up the imperial court, a close official said: ""The border officials reported that Zhuge Liang led more than 300,000 troops and went out of Hanzhong, and ordered Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi to be the vanguards of the front and led the troops in."" Rui was shocked and asked the ministers and said: ""Who can be a general to retreat from the soldiers of Shu?"" Suddenly one person came out and said: ""My father died in Hanzhong, and the hatred of the gnashing of teeth has never been repaid. Now that the soldiers of Shu have violated the border, I would like to invite the generals of the headquarters, and even beg Your Majesty. Give soldiers from Guanxi to go to Poshu: serve the country above, report to the father below, and the minister will never hate him!"" Everyone regarded him as Xiahou Mao, the son of Xiahou Yuan. The character Zixiu is named Zixiu; his nature is the most urgent and most miserly; he has been the son of Xiahou Dun since he was a child. Later, Xiahou Yuan was beheaded by Huang Zhong, and Cao Cao took pity on him, and took the daughter Qihe Princess Zhao Mao as his consort, so he was respected by the court. Although he is in power, he has not yet fought. At that time, when he asked to go on an expedition, Cao Ruiyou was appointed as the chief governor, and he dispatched the troops and horses of the Guanxi roads to meet the enemy. Situ Wang Lang admonished: ""No: Xiahou's concubine has never fought before, and it is not appropriate for him to take on a great responsibility now. Moreover, Zhuge Liang is resourceful and knowledgeable in strategy, and he should not underestimate the enemy."" Do you want to be an internal response? I have learned strategy from my father since I was a child, and I have a deep understanding of the art of war. Why did you deceive me when I was young? If I don’t capture Zhuge Liang alive, I swear I won’t see the Son of Heaven!” Wang Lang and others did not dare to say anything. Xiahou Mao resigned from Lord Wei, Xingye went to Chang'an, and dispatched more than 200,000 troops and horses from various Guanxi routes to attack Kongming. Exactly:","News soon reaches Cao Rui of the attack by three hundred thousand men, and that the vanguard under Zhao Zilong and Deng Zhi has already crossed the border. At his own request, Xiahou Mao is given permission to lead the defence. He especially wants this role because he seeks revenge for his father, Xiahou Yuan, who died when Xuande took Hanzhong. Xiahou Mao is renowned for his ferocious temper and for being very tight-fisted. He is also married to a sister of Cao Rui. So he is put in charge despite others, including a leading minister, pointing out that the young man has no relevant experience, especially when confronting someone as skilful as Kong Ming. Xiahou Mao deflects this by asking whether the minister is himself in league with Kong Ming. ‘If I don’t take Kong Ming alive, then I’ll never return to see the Son of Heaven,’ cries Xiahou Mao.","Naturally, this movement was duly reported in Luoyang at a court held by Cao Rui, when a minister said, “A report from the border stations says that Zhuge Liang has marched three hundred thousand troops into Hanzhong. Zhao Yun and Deng Zhi are leading the advanced guard.” The report alarmed the Emperor, and he asked, “Who can lead an army to repel the advance?” At once out spoke one, saying, “My father died in Hanzhong, and to my bitter resentment his death is unavenged. Now I desire to lead the army against Shu, and I pray that the armies west of the Pass may be given me for this purpose. I shall render a service to the state, as well as taking vengeance for my father. I care not what fate may befall me.” The speaker was Xiahou Yuan's son, Xiahou Mao. He was by nature very impulsive and also very miserly. When young he had been adopted by Xiahou Dun. When Xiahou Yuan was killed by Huang Zhong, Cao Cao was moved and married Xiahou Mao to one of his daughters, Princess Qinghe, so that he was an Emperor's son-in-law. As such he enjoyed great deference at court. But although he held a military commission, he had never been with the army. However, as he requested the command, he was made Commander-in-Chief to get the western army ready to march. The Minister Wang Lang spoke against the appointment, saying, “The appointment is wrong. Xiahou Mao, the Son-in-Law, has never seen a battle and is unsuitable for this post, especially when his opponent is the clever and crafty Zhuge Liang, a man thoroughly versed in strategy.” “I suppose you have arranged with Zhuge Liang to be his ally,” sneered Xiahou Mao. “Ever since I was a boy, I have studied strategy, and I am well acquainted with army matters. Why do you despise my youth? Unless I capture this Zhuge Liang, I pledge myself never again to see the Emperor's face.” Wang Lang and his supporters were silenced. Xiahou Mao took leave of the Ruler of Wei and hastened to Changan to get his army in order."

Ren was startled and wanted to hold on. Vice-general Zhai Yuan said: ""The king of Wei ordered the general to take Jingzhou on an appointment with Eastern Wu, and now he came by himself, and he wanted to die, so why should he avoid him?"" It's better to stick to it. It's the best policy."" General Xiahoucun said: ""This scholar's words are heard. Haven't you heard 'water comes to cover the soil, and soldiers are approaching'? He ordered Man Chong to guard Fancheng, and led his own troops to welcome Yunchang. Yun Chang knew that Cao's army was coming, and called Guan Ping and Liao Hua, two generals, and went under the plan. Confronted with Cao Bing in two battles. Liao Hua went out to fight, and Zhai Yuan went out to greet him. When the two generals fought not long ago, they were defeated by cheating, and they drove away. The next day, come to fight again. Xiahoucun and Zhai Yuan went out to meet them, and the Jingzhou soldiers were defeated again, and they chased and killed for more than twenty miles. Cao Ren urgently ordered the front army to return quickly, but Guan Ping and Liao Hua came to kill him from behind, causing Cao's army to be in chaos. Cao Ren knew that he was in the middle of the plan, so he first sent an army to Xiangyang; a few miles away from the city, the embroidered flag in front of him was drawn, and Yun Chang reined in his horse and crossed his sword to block the way. Cao Ren was frightened and did not dare to confront each other. The cloud is long and does not catch up. After a few moments, Xiahou Cun's army arrived, and when he saw Yun Chang, he was furious and confronted with Yun Chang. Zhai Yuan left, was caught up by Guan Ping, and cut him with a knife. Taking advantage of the situation, most of Cao's soldiers died in the Xiangjiang River. Cao Ren retreated to Fancheng.","But Cao Ren has the greater authority and, leaving Man Chong in the city to defend it, he rides out to engage with Guan Yu. Almost as soon as the first encounter takes place the Jingzhou men retreat, pursued by Cao Ren and his men. The same happens the next day until, fooled by this, Cao Ren suddenly finds himself caught up in an ambush. Seeing Guan Yu standing passively on the hillside, Cao Ren is struck with terror and rushes from the battle scene, back to the security of Fancheng. As a result Guan Yu is able to seize the city of Xiangyang.","Cao Ren was in Xiangyang when he heard that Guan Yu was coming against him. He was much put about, and inclined to trust solely to defense. But his next command, Zhai Yuan, did not support this course and argued against it. “The Prince of Wei has ordered you to act in concert with Wu and take Jingzhou. For the other side to come against such a combination is to walk in the way of death; certainly we have no occasion to avoid a conflict.” On the other hand the newly sent Adviser Man Chong inculcated caution. Said he, “Guan Yu is brave and cunning and one not to be met lightly. I think defense is best.” Then General Xiahou Cun said contemptuously, “This is all the talk of a lot of book-folk. When the flood approaches, bank up to keep it out. Let the enemy come with their tired soldiers, and we shall go out, defeat them, and receive our reward, for we are sure of victory.” Cao Ren was won over to the side of those of action. He placed Man Chong in command of the defenses while he went outside to beat off Guan Yu. When the two forces met, Guan Yu called to his side Guan Ping and Liao Hua, to whom he gave certain orders. These two advanced, settled their array, and Liao Hua then rode out and offered a challenge. Zhai Yuan accepted it; but soon after the combat began, Liao Hua made as if he was defeated and turned to leave the field. Zhai Yuan went after him. The Jingzhou troops retired seven miles or so. Soon the Jingzhou soldiers came again and offered battle, when Xiahou Cun and Zhai Yuan both went out. The maneuver of the preceding day was repeated, and the Jingzhou army retreated another seven miles. But suddenly there was a detonation behind the army of Cao Cao, and the rolling of drums as for attack. Cao Ren hastily called upon his troops to return. They did so; but Guan Ping and Liao Hua then turned and followed on their heels so that the troops of Cao Cao were thrown into confusion. Cao Ren by this time had seen that a trap had been laid and he had fallen therein, so he hastily marched with one army to Xiangyang. He got to within a short distance of the city when he saw before him a handsome banner waving in the wind, and out came Guan Yu with his green-dragon saber ready to slay. Cao Ren was powerless from fear, and, fighting being impossible, he turned off in a diagonal direction for Xiangyang. Then Xiahou Cun came. He fell into a rage at the sight of the old warrior and went to fight him. But Xiahou Cun was slain in the first encounter. Zhai Yuan fled, but Guan Ping pursued and slew him. Then the pursuit was continued, and the loss of Cao Cao's side was very heavy. More than half were drowned in River Xiang. This phase ended with Cao Ren fleeing to Fankou and Guan Yu in possession of Xiangyang."
軍人回見張飛，哭告嚴顏如此毁罵。張飛大怒，咬牙睜目，披挂上馬，引數百騎來巴郡城下搦戰。城上衆軍百般痛罵。張飛性急，幾番殺到弔橋，要過護城河，又被亂箭射回。到晚全無一個人出，張飛忍一肚氣還寨。次日早晨，又引軍去搦戰。那嚴顏在城敵樓上，一箭射中張飛頭盔。飛指而恨曰：“若挐住你這老匹夫，我親自食你肉！”到晚又空回。第三日，張飛引了軍，沿城去罵。原來那座城子是個山城，周圍都是亂山。張飛自乘馬登山，下視城中，見軍士盡皆披挂，分列隊伍，伏在城中，只是不出；又見民夫來來往往，搬磚運石，相助守城。張飛敎馬軍下馬，步軍皆坐，引他出敵，並無動靜。又罵了一日，依舊空回。張飛在寨中，自思：“終日叫罵，彼只不出，如之奈何？”猛然思得一計，敎衆軍不要前去搦戰，都結束了在寨中等候；却只敎三五十個軍士，直去城下叫罵，引嚴顏軍出來，便與廝殺。張飛磨拳擦掌，只等敵軍來。小軍連罵了三日，全然不出。張飛眉頭一縱，又生一計，傳令敎軍士四散砍打柴草，尋覓路徑，不來搦戰。嚴顏在城中，連日不見張飛動靜，心中疑惑，着十數個小軍，扮作張飛砍柴的軍，潛地出城，雜在軍內，入山中探聽。,"The soldiers returned to see Zhang Fei and cried out to Yan Yan for such scolding. Zhang Fei was furious, gritted his teeth and opened his eyes, put on his horse, and led hundreds of horses to fight under the city of Berkshire. The army in the city cursed in every possible way. Zhang Fei was in a hurry, and hit the drawbridge several times, trying to cross the moat, but was shot back by random arrows. No one came out at night, Zhang Fei endured his anger and returned to the village. The next morning, he led the army to fight again. That Yan Yan was on the tower of the city enemy and shot Zhang Fei's helmet with an arrow. Flying fingers and hating said: ""If you hold you old man, I will eat your meat myself!"" At night, he returned empty. On the third day, Zhang Fei led the army and went along the city to curse. It turned out that the city was a mountain city, surrounded by chaotic mountains. Zhang Fei climbed the mountain on his own horse, looked down at the city, and saw that all the soldiers were dressed in uniforms, lined up in ranks, crouched in the city, but did not go out; Zhang Fei ordered the horse army to dismount, and the infantry army all sat down, leading him out of the enemy, but there was no movement. After another day of scolding, it was still empty. Zhang Fei was in the village and thought to himself, ""I yelled at him all day long, but he didn't come out. What can I do?"" Suddenly he came up with a plan and told the army not to go to fight. A sergeant went straight to the city and yelled at him, led Yan Yan's army out, and fought with him. Zhang Fei grinded his fists and waited for the enemy to come. Xiaojun scolded for three days in a row, but didn't come out at all. Zhang Fei raised his brows and made another plan, ordering the sergeants to cut firewood in all directions, to find a way, and not to fight. Yan Yan was in the city, and she did not see Zhang Fei's movement for several days, and she was puzzled. She had dozens of small troops, pretending to be Zhang Fei's army chopping wood, sneaking out of the city, mixing in the army, and entering the mountains to listen.",For three days Zhang Fei tries to draw Yan Yan and his men out by taunting them.,"And thus mutilated he returned to Zhang Fei. When Zhang Fei heard of it, his wrath boiled up and he cursed the defender of the city. Grinding his teeth and glaring with rage, he put on his armor, mounted his steed, and went up close to the walls with a few mounted followers, and challenged those on the ramparts to fight him. But the defenders on the walls only replied with shameful abuse, and none accepted the challenge. Zhang Fei galloped again and again to the drawbridge, only to be driven off each time with flights of arrows. But not a man came outside the walls. As the day closed in, the warrior, still fuming with wrath, returned to his own camp. Next day Zhang Fei again led his troops to the foot of the wall and challenged; again the challenge was refused. But Yan Yan shot an arrow from the tower that struck Zhang Fei's helmet. This angered him still more, and pointing the finger of disdain at his enemy, Zhang Fei cried, “I will capture you yet, you old fool, and then I will devour your flesh!” So again at eventide the troops of Jingzhou returned to camp bucking their desire. On the third day Zhang Fei and his troops made the circuit of the city along the edge of the moat, hurling insults at their enemies. It so happened that the city was set on a hill with rugged heights all round, so that going around it the assailants were sometimes on hill tops and sometimes on the level. While standing on one of the hills, Zhang Fei noticed that he could see clear down into the city. There stood the defenders in their ranks, all ready for battle although none of them came out. And the common people went to and fro carrying bricks and bringing stones to strengthen the defenses. Then Zhang Fei ordered his horsemen to dismount and his footmen to sit down so that they could not be seen from the city. He hoped thus to cheat the defenders into thinking that there were none to attack and so induce them to come out. But this also was vain, for still the defenders declined battle, and another day was lost. The army once more returned to camp. That night Zhang Fei sat in his tent trying to think out some means to overcome an enemy that steadily refused to come out from behind the walls. Presently, however, the brain behind the knitted brows conceived a plan. So next day, instead of sending all the troops to offer a challenge from the foot of the wall, Zhang Fei kept most of them in camp and sent only a few to howl insults and hurl abuse. He hoped by this means to inveigle Yan Yan out to attack the small number of troops. But this also failed, and he was left all day rubbing hid hands with impatience. Never a man appeared without the wall. Foiled again, another ruse grew up behind his bushy eyebrows. He set his troops to cut firewood and seek out and explore the tracks that lay about the city. No longer did they challenge the wall. After some days of this, Yan Yan began to wonder what mischief was brewing, and he sent out spies, dressed as were the firewood cutters, to mingle with them and try to discover what was afoot. That day, when the troops returned to camp, Zhang Fei sat in his tent stamping his foot with rage and execrating his enemy."

The flag was lowered that day, and Ai was overjoyed. After a while, Zhang Shao waited, and Ai Ren welcomed him in. The three bowed down at the foot of the steps, presenting the jade seal of the upper and lower stamps. Ai was overjoyed by the demolition and surrender of the book, and received the jade seal, and treated Zhang Shao, Qiao Zhou, Deng Liang and others with great respect. Ai Zuo returned the book and paid three people to go back to Chengdu to reassure people. The three of them bid farewell to Deng Ai, returned to Chengdu, met the Empress, and submitted a letter, detailing the kindness of Deng Ai's treatment of each other. After the master opened the seal and looked at it, he was overjoyed, and sent his servant Jiang Xianjie to order Jiang Wei to surrender early; he sent Shangshu Lang Li Hu, and sent a booklet and Ai: a total of 280,000 households, 940,000 men and women, and 100,000 soldiers and soldiers. 2,000, 40,000 officials, more than 400,000 grains, 2,000 catties of gold and silver, and 200,000 jins of silk and silk. The remainder is in the library, not enough to count. On the first day of the twelfth lunar month, the ruler and his ministers will surrender.","Soon the envoys arrive at Deng Ai’s camp with the document of surrender and the seal of authority. They are treated well and return to the second ruler to inform him of what has happened. He then sends instructions to Jiang Wei to also surrender. But Liu Chen cannot bear the shame and in his rage he returns to his palace, bearing his sword.","Every day Deng Ai's horsemen rode to the city to see what was afoot. It was a glad day when they returned reporting the hoisting of the flag of surrender. The general had not long to wait. The three messengers soon arrived and presented the letter announcing surrender and the seal therewith. Deng Ai read the letter with great exultation, and took possession of the seal. He treated the envoys courteously, and by their hands sent back a letter to allay any anxiety among the people. In due time they reentered the city and bore this missive to the Latter Ruler, who read it with much satisfaction. Then he sent Minister Jiang Xian to order Jiang Wei to surrender. Li Hu, Chair of the Secretariat, carried to the victorious Deng Ai the statistical documents of the resources of the kingdom: 2,800,000 households, 9,140,000 souls, 102,000 armed soldiers of all ranks, and 40,000 civil employees. Besides, there were granaries with 4,000,000 carts of grain, treasuries with 3,000 pounds of gold and silver and 200,000 rolls of silks of many qualities, and many unenumerated but precious things in the various storehouses. Li Hu arranged that the ceremony of surrender should take place on the first day of the twelfth month."

漢丞相武鄕侯諸葛亮，致書於大司馬曹子丹之前：切謂夫為將者：能去能就，能柔能剛；能進能退，能弱能強。不動如山岳，難知如陰陽；無窮如天地，充實如太倉；浩渺如四海，眩曜如三光。預知天文之旱澇，先識地理之平康。察陣勢之期會，揣敵人之短長。嗟爾無學後輩，上逆穹蒼，助篡國之反賊，稱帝號於洛陽；走殘兵於斜谷，遭霖雨於陳倉！水陸困乏，人馬猖狂！拋盈郊之戈甲，棄滿地之刀鎗！都督心崩而膽裂，將軍鼠竄而狼忙！無面見關中之父老，何顏入相府之廳堂！史官秉筆而記錄，百姓衆口而傳揚：仲達聞陣而惕惕，子丹望風而遑遑！吾軍兵強而馬壯，大將虎奮以龍驤！掃秦川為平壤，蕩魏國作坵荒！,"The Prime Minister of the Han Dynasty, Marquis Wuyan Zhuge Liang, wrote a letter before Cao Zidan, the Great Sima: Qi said that his husband is a general: he can go and be done, he can be flexible and rigid; he can advance and retreat, and he can be weak and strong. Unmoving like mountains, hard to know like Yin and Yang; infinite like heaven and earth, full like Taicang; vast like the four seas, dazzling like three lights. Predict the drought and flood in astronomy, and first understand the peace and health of geography. During the period of observation of the battle, the enemy's short and long. The younger generation who has no school, went up against the sky, helped the rebels who usurped the country, called the emperor in Luoyang; walked the remnants of the soldiers in the inclined valley, and was rained in Chencang by the rain! The land and water are sleepy, and the people and horses are rampant! Throw away the armor of the suburbs, and abandon the swords and guns of the ground! The governor's heart is broken and his courage is broken, and the general is busy with the rat! Seeing the elders in Guanzhong without face, He Yan entered the hall of the Prime Minister's Mansion!

The letter is a stream of subtle, pointed abuse deriding his achievements and saying that history will only remember him as a coward, a failure and a fraud. The fury this evokes is too much for Cao Zhen’s weakened body, and that same night he collapses and dies. The Wei ruler orders Sima Yi the very next day to engage his full force against the Shu army in revenge. And this is what happens. Sima Yi spots Kong Ming in his Daoist robes and seated in his carriage.","Cao Zhen was too ill to rise, but he opened the cover and read: “The Prime Minister of Han, Zhuge Liang, to the Minister of War, Cao Zhen: “You will permit me to say that a leader of an army should be able to go and come, to be facile and obdurate, to advance and retire, to show himself weak or strong, to be immovable as mountains, to be inscrutable as the operations of nature, to be infinite as the universe, to be everlasting as the blue void, to be vast as the ocean, to be dazzling as the lights of heaven, to foresee droughts and floods, to know the nature of the ground, to understand the possibilities of battle arrays, to conjecture the excellencies and defects of the enemy. “Alas! One of your sort, ignorant and inferior, rising impudently in heaven's vault, has had the presumption to assist a rebel to assume the imperial style and state at Luoyang, to send some miserable soldiers into Beach Valley. There they happened upon drenching rain. The difficult roads wearied both soldiers and horses, driving them frantic. Weapons and armors littered the countryside, swords and spears covered the ground. You, the Commander-in-Chief, were heart-broken and cowed, your generals fled like rats. You dare not show your faces at home, nor can you enter the halls of state. The historians' pens will record your defeats; the people will recount your infamies. ' Sima Yi is frightened when he hears of battle fronts, Cao Zhen is alarmed at mere rumors.' My soldiers are fierce and their steeds strong; my great generals are eager as tigers and majestic as dragons. I shall sweep the Middle Land bare and make Wei desolate.”"
白樂天亦有詩曰：,Bai Letian also has a poem saying:,"The green woods, sun-dappled and beautiful,",And Bo Juyi also wrote a poem:
却說孫權受了封爵，衆文武官僚拜賀已畢，命收拾美玉明珠等物，遣人齎進謝恩。早有細作報說：“蜀主引本國大兵，及蠻王沙摩柯番兵數萬，又有洞溪漢將杜路、劉寧二枝兵，水陸並進，聲勢震天。水路軍已出巫口，旱路軍已到秭歸。”時孫權雖登王位，奈魏王不肯接應，乃問文武曰：“蜀兵勢大，當復如何？”衆皆默然。權歎曰：“周郎之後有魯肅；魯肅之後有呂蒙；今呂蒙已亡，無人與孤分憂也！”言未畢，忽班部中一少年將，奮然而出，伏地奏曰：“臣雖年幼，頗習兵書。願乞數萬之兵，以破蜀兵。”權視之，乃孫桓也。桓字叔武，其父名河，本姓俞氏，孫策愛之，賜姓孫；因此亦係吳王宗族。河生四子。桓居其長，弓馬熟嫺，常從吳王征討，累立奇功，官授武衞都尉；時年二十五歲。權曰：“汝有何策勝之？”桓曰：“臣有大將二員：一名李異，一名謝旌，俱有萬夫不當之勇。乞數萬之衆，往擒劉備。”權曰：“姪雖英勇，爭奈年幼；必得一人相助，方可。”虎威將軍朱然出曰：“臣願與小將軍同擒劉備。”權許之，遂點水陸軍五萬，封孫桓為左都督，朱然為右都督，卽日起兵。哨馬探得蜀兵已至宜都下寨，孫桓引二萬五千軍馬，屯於宜都界口，前後分作三營，以拒蜀兵。,"However, he said that Sun Quan had been awarded a title, and all the civil and military bureaucrats had finished paying their respects. A detailed report has long ago said: ""The Lord of Shu has brought in his own soldiers, including the barbarian king Shamo Kefan, tens of thousands of soldiers, and two soldiers from Dongxi Han generals Du Lu and Liu Ning. Mouth, the Han Lu army has arrived at Zigui."" At that time, although Sun Quan ascended the throne, the King of Naiwei refused to accept him, so he asked Wen Wu, ""The army of Shu is strong, what should we do?"" Everyone was silent. Quan Tan said: ""After Zhou Lang, there was Lu Su; after Lu Su there was Lü Meng; now that Lü Meng is dead, there is no one to share the worries with orphans!"" ""Although the minister is young, he is quite familiar with military books. I would like to beg tens of thousands of soldiers to defeat the soldiers of Shu."" Quan regarded him as Sun Huan. The word Huan is Shuwu, his father's name is He, his original surname is Yu, and Sun Ce loves him and gives him the surname Sun; therefore, he is also the clan of the King of Wu. He has four sons. Huan Ju, his chief, was skilled in bowing and horses, and he often conquered from the King of Wu. Quan said, ""What's your strategy to win this?"" Huan said, ""I have two generals: one Li Yi and one Xie Jing, both of whom have the courage to be inappropriate. They beg tens of thousands of people to capture Liu Bei. Quan said: ""Although I am brave, I want to be young. You must have someone to help you."" Zhu Ran, the general of Huwei, said: ""I would like to capture Liu Bei with the junior general."" He named Sun Huan the left governor and Zhu Ran the right governor, and the army began to rise on the next day. The sentry found that the soldiers of Shu had arrived at Yidu, and Sun Huan led 25,000 troops and settled them at the border of Yidu.","Sun Quan submits to Wei and accepts the title of king but this does not stop the Shu invasion. Far from it, and soon the vast army is at the kingdom’s gates, and there is precious little sign of any help coming from the Wei emperor in Xuchang, despite Sun Quan now being a vassal king. He is just bemoaning the lack of a Lu Su or Lü Meng to advise him when a young man steps forward and offers his services. This is Sun Huan, a nephew by adoption of the king, who says that if given thirty to fifty thousand troops he could bring the head of Xuande to Sun Quan assisted by his friends Li Yi and Xie Jing. The warrior Zhu Ran offers to go with them, and permission is given for fifty thousand troops to accompany them. Wu Ban, leader of the forces of Shu, is astonished to hear that a stripling like Sun Huan has been sent against him.","And when he had received the felicitations of his officers, Sun Quan gave orders to collect beautiful works in jade and brilliant pearls, which were sent to Wei as return gifts. Not long after came tidings of the forces under the ruler of Shu: “The First Ruler, together with King Shamo Ke of the Mang nations, leads his own army and a large number of tribesmen from the east and south; furthermore, he is aided by the two Han generals of Dongxi, Liu Ning and Du Lu, with their cohorts. They advance both by land and by water, a mighty host, of which the shouting shakes the heavens. The naval force has already come out at Wukou, and the land force has reached Zigui.” Although Sun Quan had been created a prince, yet Emperor Pi would not send a relieve army. And when the news came, the Prince of Wu asked present advice from his officers, but there was none to help him; they only muttered and were silent. “Ah!” sighed he. “After Zhou Yu I had Lu Su, and Lu Meng succeeded Lu Su. But now they have all three gone, and there is no one to share my troubles!” But just then a very youthful general stepped out from the ranks of the officials and said, with a lowly obeisance, “Though I am young, I am not a little versed in the books of war, and with a few legions I could destroy the power of Shu.” Sun Quan recognized Sun Huan, the son of Yu He. Sun Ce loved the youth and gave him his own family name of Sun and so made him a member of his own clan. Yu He had four sons, of whom Sun Huan was the eldest. He was an expert archer and horseman and had accompanied his protector in several campaigns, where he had distinguished himself right well and had been given a rank. At this time he was twenty-five. “How do you think you can overcome them?” “There are two able commanders under my command named Xie Jing and Li Yi, both very brave. With a few legions I will capture Liu Bei.” “Though you are brave, nephew, yet you are young and ought to have an assistant.” Thereupon Tiger General Zhu Ran stepped forward, saying, “Let me go.” Sun Quan consented, and he told off fifty thousand of soldiers and marines, over whom he placed Sun Huan and Zhu Ran as joint commanders. They were to start as soon as possible. The scouts reported that the army of Shu was camped at Yidu, and Sun Huan, Commander of the Left, led half his army to the borders of that county and camped in three stockades."

孫權跳過橋南，徐盛、董襲駕舟相迎。凌統、谷利扺住張遼。甘寧、呂蒙引軍回救，却被樂進從後追來，李典又截住廝殺，吳兵折了大半。凌統所領三百餘人，盡被殺死。統身中數鎗，殺到橋邊，橋已折斷，遶河而逃。孫權在舟中望見，急令董襲棹舟接之，乃得渡回。呂蒙、甘寧皆死命逃過河南。這一陣殺得江南人人害怕；聞張遼大名，小兒也不敢夜啼。衆將保護孫權回營。權乃重賞凌統、谷利，收軍回濡須，整頓船隻，商議水陸並進；一面差人回江南，再起人馬來助戰。,"Sun Quan jumped over the south of the bridge, and Xu Sheng and Dong Xi rode a boat to meet him. Ling Tong and Gu Li occupied Zhang Liao. Gan Ning and Lü Meng led the army back to the rescue, but were chased by Le Jin, Li Dian stopped the fight again, and Wu Bing lost most of them. More than 300 people led by Ling Tong were all killed. Tong was shot several times and reached the bridge. The bridge was broken and he fled around the river. Sun Quan saw it in the boat, and he urgently ordered Dong Xi to pick him up in the boat, so he had to cross back. Both Lü Meng and Gan Ning escaped from Henan with their lives. This slaughter made everyone in Jiangnan scared; hearing Zhang Liao's name, the children did not dare to cry at night. The generals will protect Sun Quan and return to the camp. Quan Nai rewarded Ling Tong and Gu Li heavily, withdrew the army and returned to Shuxu, rectified the ships, and negotiated to advance by land and water.","At the crucial moment the horse takes off and flies through the air, landing safely on the far bank. Ling Tong loses all of his three hundred men but survives. Yet all over the battlefield the slaughter is terrible. So much so that the name of Zhang Liao is used for many years afterwards to frighten naughty children in Wu. Sun Quan and his surviving men return to their camp and then pack up and make for the port at Ruxu to plan a fresh assault by sea and land. Reinforcements also have to be found.","Having reached the farther shore, Sun Quan embarked on one of the boats of Xu Sheng and Dong Xi and was rowed to a place of safety, while Ling Tong and Gu Li were still fighting with Zhang Liao's army. Gan Ning and Lu Meng, coming to their aid, were pursued by Yue Jin, and Li Dian also stayed their progress. But the soldiers of the South Land fought bravely; half of their force fell, and Ling Tong's troop of three hundred horse perished all, while Ling Tong himself was wounded, but found his way to the bridge. Finding it destroyed, he fled along the stream. Presently he was seen by Sun Quan from the boat and taken on board by Dong Xi. Gan Ning and Lu Meng also cut their ways back to the southern shore. The terrible slaughter at this battle put such fear into the minds of the people of the South Land that the name of Zhang Liao kept the very children quiet at night. When Sun Quan reached his camp, he richly rewarded Ling Tong and Gu Li. Then he led his army back to Ruxu and began to put his ships in order so that the army and navy might act in unison. He also sent home for reinforcements."
且說玄德在葭萌關日久，甚得民心。忽接得孔明文書，知孫夫人已回東吳。又聞曹操興兵犯濡須，乃與龐統議曰：“曹操擊孫權，操勝必將取荊州，權勝亦必取荊州矣。為之奈何？”龐統曰：“主公勿憂：有孔明在彼，料想東吳不敢犯荊州。主公可馳書去劉璋處，只推：‘曹操攻擊孫權，權求救於荊州。吾與孫權脣齒之邦，不容不相援。張魯自守之賊，決不敢來犯界。吾今欲勒兵回荊州，與孫權會同破曹操，奈兵少糧缺。望推同宗之誼，速發精兵三、四萬，行糧十萬斛相助，請勿有誤。’若得軍馬錢糧，却另作商議。”,"Besides, Xuande has been in Jiameng Pass for a long time, and he is very popular among the people. Suddenly, he received Kong Ming's documents and knew that Mrs. Sun had returned to Soochow. He also heard that Cao Cao had raised his troops to attack Shuxu, so he suggested to Pang Tong: ""Cao Cao attacked Sun Quan, and if Cao Cao wins, he will take Jingzhou, and if he wins, he will take Jingzhou. What can we do?"" Pang Tong said, ""Don't worry, lord: there is Confucius there. It is expected that Soochow Wu would not dare to violate Jingzhou. The lord Kechi went to Liu Zhang's place, and only pushed: 'Cao Cao attacked Sun Quan, and Quan asked for help in Jingzhou. Sun Quan and I are close friends, and we cannot help each other. Zhang Lu's self-defense thief will never dare Coming to invade the world. I want to force my troops to return to Jingzhou, and join Sun Quan to defeat Cao Cao. Nai soldiers are short of food. I hope to promote the friendship of the same clan, and quickly send out 30,000 to 40,000 elite soldiers and 100,000 grains to help each other. Please make no mistake. 'If you get money and rations for the army and horses, we will negotiate separately.""","Xuande is now based at Jiameng pass. Here, his thoughtful and compassionate behaviour and that of his men have earned him support from the local people. However, when news comes of what has happened between Cao Cao and Sun Quan, he is troubled and he seeks advice. Pang Tong recommends, ‘Write to Liu Zhang saying that Sun Quan needs your help against Cao Cao. This’ll mean you can head back to support him. Also, say you need support yourself – let’s say between thirty and forty thousand of his best soldiers and a hundred thousand bushels of grain to manage the march back. If Liu Zhang does as you ask, we can then move to the next step.’ So Xuande sends the letter by messenger.","In the meantime, Liu Bei had been winning the hearts of the people about Jiameng Pass, where his army lay. When he received the news of his wife's flight and of Cao Cao's threatened attack, he called in Pang Tong and laid the matter before him. “The victor, whoever it is, will assuredly possess himself of our region of Jingzhou,” said Liu Bei at the close. “You need not trouble about that region,” said Pang Tong. “I do not think the South Land or the Middle Land will try to take it so long as Zhuge Liang is there. But, my lord, write to Liu Zhang telling him you wish to return on account of this threatening danger. It will be a plausible excuse. You may say that on account of Cao Cao's attack, Sun Quan has sent to you for help, and that as his country and yours are neighbors and dependent upon each other for safety you cannot refuse. Further, you will assure him that there is no danger of any invasion by Zhang Lu. However, we have too few troops for our purpose and insufficient grain, so you must also urge your relative to send you thirty or forty thousand of veterans and a plentiful supply of food. He will not refuse, and with more soldiers and provisions we can do as we please.”"

一日，吳主孫亮悶坐，黃門侍郎全紀在側，紀乃國舅也。亮因泣告曰：“孫綝專權妄殺，欺朕太甚；今不圖之，必為後患。”紀曰：“陛下但有用臣處，臣萬死不辭。”亮曰：“卿可只今點起禁兵，與將軍劉丞各把城門，朕自出殺孫綝。但此事切不可令卿母知之：卿母乃綝之姊也。倘若泄漏，誤朕匪輕。”紀曰：“乞陛下草詔與臣。臨行事之時，臣將詔示衆，使綝手下人皆不敢妄動。”亮從之，卽寫密詔付紀。紀受詔歸家，密告其父全尚。尚知此事，乃告妻曰：“三日內殺孫綝矣。”妻曰：“殺之是也。”口雖應之，却私令人持書報知孫綝。綝大怒，當夜便喚弟兄四人，點起精兵，先圍大內；一面將全尚、劉丞，并其家小俱拿下。比及平明，吳主孫亮聽得宮門外金鼓大震。內侍慌入奏曰：“孫綝引兵圍了內苑。”亮大怒，指全后罵曰：“汝父兄誤我大事矣！”乃拔劍欲出。全后與侍中近臣，皆牽其衣而哭，不放亮出。孫綝先將全尚、劉丞等殺訖，然後召文武於朝內，下令曰：“主上荒淫久病，昏亂無道，不可以奉宗廟，今當廢之。汝諸文武，敢有不從者，以謀叛論！”衆皆畏懼，應曰：“願從將軍之令。”尚書桓懿大怒，從班部中挺然而出，指孫綝大罵曰：“今上乃聰明之主，汝何敢出此亂言！吾寧死不從賊臣之命。”綝大怒，自拔劍斬之，卽入內指吳主孫亮罵曰：“無道昏君！本當誅戳，以謝天下！看先帝之面，廢汝為會稽王，吾自選有德者立之！”叱中書郎李崇奪其印綬，令鄧程收之。亮大哭而去。後人有詩歎曰：,"One day, Sun Liang, the master of Wu, sat sullenly, with Quan Ji, the servant of the Huangmen, beside him, and Ji was the uncle of the country. Liang Yin sobbed and said, ""Sun Chen's tyrannical killings have deceived me too much; if you don't do it now, you will be troubled in the future."" Ji said, ""Your Majesty has a good minister, and the minister will never quit."" Liang said, ""You can only order now, sir. The ban was raised, and the general Liu Cheng and the city gate were each closed, and I went out to kill Sun Chen. But this matter must not be made known to Qing mother: Qing mother is Chen's sister. If it is leaked, it will be misleading and light. I beg His Majesty to send an edict to the ministers. When they are about to act, the ministers will show the edict to the public, so that no one under the commander dares to act rashly."" Liang obeyed and wrote a secret edict to pay the discipline. Ji was ordered to return home and secretly informed his father, Quan Shang. When he knew about this, he told his wife, ""You will kill Sun Chen within three days."" His wife said, ""It's okay to kill him."" Although he responded, he privately ordered Sun Chen to report to him with a book. Chen was furious, and he called four of his brothers that night, mobilized elite soldiers, and encircled the big inside first; on the one hand, he took Quan Shang, Liu Cheng, and their family members. Compared with Ping Ming, Sun Liang, the master of Wu, heard the golden drum shaking outside the palace gate. The inner servant panicked and said, ""Sun Chen led the troops to surround the inner garden."" Liang was furious, pointing at the queen and scolding, ""Your father and brother have misunderstood me in a big matter!"" He drew his sword and was about to come out. The whole queen and the courtiers in the courtroom all held their clothes and wept, but they did not show it. Sun Chen first killed Quan Shang, Liu Cheng, etc., and then summoned Wen Wu to the court, and ordered: ""My lord is debauched and ill for a long time, dazed and incoherent, and cannot serve the ancestral temple. It should be abolished now. You are conspiring to betray!"" Everyone was afraid, and responded, ""I would like to obey the general's orders."" Shang Shu Huan Yi was furious and stepped out of the squad, pointing at Sun Chen and cursing, ""This is the master of wisdom, How dare you make such nonsense! I would rather die than obey the orders of the thieves."" Infuriated, he pulled out his sword and cut him off. He went in and pointed at Sun Liang, the lord of Wu, and cursed, ""The ignorant lord! I should have been stabbed to thank the world! In the face of the former emperor, I will depose you as the king of Kuaiji, and I will choose a virtuous person to establish it!"" Li Chong, the scholar of the middle school, took his seal and ordered Deng Cheng to accept it. Bright cried. A later poem sighed and said:","By now the ruler of Wu, Sun Liang, who is only sixteen years old, is completely in the control of Sun Chen. The weakness of his position is further exposed when he tries to overthrow Sun Chen by plotting with his brother-in-law to take over the city and kill Sun Chen. But his brother-in-law privately informs his father. He is married to the eldest sister of Sun Chen, so he is immediately informed of the plot. As a result Sun Chen deposes the ruler, claiming that he is morally corrupt and utterly incompetent to perform the required imperial rituals for the ancestors. Within moments Sun Liang has been seized and sent into internal exile, weeping as he leaves. A poet has said: Quoting great leaders of the past, Such treacherous actions mock them. Mourn for Sun Liang, a wise ruler","One day the Ruler of Wu, musing over his sorrows and feeling very miserable, began to weep. The officer in charge of the eunuchs, who was an Imperial Brother-in-Law, stood by. “Sun Chen holds all real power and does as he wishes, while I am despised,” said the Ruler of Wu. “Something must be done.” Quan Ji said, “I would think no sacrifice too great if Your Majesty would make use of me.” “If you could muster the Palace Guards and help General Liu Cheng to keep the gates, I would go and murder that ruffian. But you must not let anyone know; for if you tell your noble mother, who is a sister of Sun Chen, she will tell her brother, and that would be very serious for me.” “Will Your Majesty give me a command that I may have authority to act when the time comes?” said Quan Ji. “At the critical moment I could show the edict and hold back Sun Chen's supporters.” The command was given, and Quan Ji went home. But he could not keep his secret, and confided the plan to his father, Quan Shang. His father told his wife, “Sun Chen will be got rid of in three days.” “Oh, he deserves that,” said she. Although she seemed to approve with her tongue, she sent a secret messenger with a letter to the proposed victim. That same night Sun Chen called in his four leader brothers, and the Palace was surrounded. The conspirators were seized, with Liu Cheng and Quan Shang and all their families. About dawn the Ruler of Wu was disturbed by a commotion at the gates, and a servant told him, “Sun Chen with his army has surrounded the Inner Palace.” Sun Liang knew that he had been betrayed. He turned on Empress Quan, who was of the Quan house, and reproached her. “Your father and brother have upset all my plans.” Drawing his sword, he was dashing out when his Consort and her people clung to his clothing and held him back. After putting to death Liu Cheng's and Quan Shang's parties, Sun Chen assembled the officers in the court and addressed them thus: “The Emperor is vicious and weak, depraved and foolish and unfit for his high office. Wherefore he must be deposed. Any of you who oppose will be punished as for conspiracy.” Only one of those present dared to say a word of protest. It was High Minister Huan Yi, who said, “How dare you utter such words? Our Emperor is very intelligent, and I will not support you. I would rather die.” Sun Chen wrathfully drew his sword and slew Huan Yi. Then Sun Chen went into the Palace and said to Sun Liang, “O unrighteous and unenlightened Highness, your death would be the only fitting reparation to make to the empire, but out of consideration for your ancestors you are only deposed and degraded to princely rank as Prince of Kuaiji. I will select a worthy successor.” Minister Li Zong was ordered to bring in the royal seal, which was delivered to Deng Cheng. The deposed ruler retired weeping. The sage example of the wise Yi Yin"
却說敗兵回到益州，報劉璋。璋大驚，閉門不出。人報城北馬超救兵到，劉璋方敢登城望之。見馬超、馬岱立於城下，大叫：“請劉季玉答話。”劉璋在城上問之。超在馬上以鞭指曰：“吾本領張魯兵來救益州，誰想張魯聽信楊松讒言，反欲害我。今已歸降劉皇叔。公可納士拜降，免致生靈受苦。如或執迷，吾先攻城矣！”劉璋驚得面如土色，氣倒於城上。衆官救醒。璋曰：“吾之不明，悔之何及！不若開門投降，以救滿城百姓。”董和曰：“城中兵尚有三萬餘人；錢帛糧草，可支一年：奈何便降？”劉璋曰：“吾父子在蜀二十餘年，無恩德以加百姓；攻戰三年，血肉捐於草野：皆我罪也。我心何安？不如投降以安百姓。”衆人聞之，皆墮淚。忽一人進曰：“主公之言，正合天意。”視之，乃巴西西充國人也：姓譙，名周，字允南。此人素曉天文。璋問之，周曰：“某夜觀乾象，見羣星聚於蜀郡；其大星光如皓月，乃帝王之象也。況一載之前，小兒謠云：‘若要吃新飯，須待先主來。’此乃預兆。不可逆天道。”黃權、劉巴聞言皆大怒，欲斬之。劉璋當住。忽報蜀郡太守許靖，踰城出降矣。劉璋大哭歸府。,"But he said that the defeated soldiers returned to Yizhou and reported to Liu Zhang. Zhang was shocked and closed the door. People reported that Ma Chao in the north of the city had arrived to rescue the troops, and Liu Zhangfang dared to go up to the city to see him. Seeing Ma Chao and Ma Dai standing under the city, they shouted, ""Please answer Liu Jiyu."" Liu Zhang asked him on the city. Chao immediately pointed his whip and said, ""I am capable of bringing Zhang Lu's troops to rescue Yizhou, but who would want Zhang Lu to listen to Yang Song's slander and want to harm me. Now he has surrendered to Uncle Liu. The public can bow down to save the lives of suffering. Mi, I'll attack the city first!"" Liu Zhang's face turned pale in shock, and his anger fell on the city. Officers wake up. Zhang said: ""I don't know, how long do I regret it? Why don't I open the door and surrender, so as to save the people of the city."" Dong He said: ""There are still more than 30,000 soldiers in the city; Surrender?"" Liu Zhang said, ""My father and son have been in Shu for more than 20 years, and they have no kindness to add to the people. After three years of fighting, their flesh and blood were donated to the grass and fields: all my sins. How can I feel at ease? It is better to surrender to help the people."" All in tears. Suddenly a person came in and said: ""The words of the lord are in line with the will of heaven."" As he saw it, he was a native of Xichong, Brazil: surnamed Qiao, given name Zhou, and styled Yunnan. This person knows astronomy. Zhang asked about it, and Zhou said: ""One night, I was watching the Qianxiang Xiang, and I saw a group of stars gathered in Shu County; the starlight was like a bright moon, and it was the image of the emperor. A year ago, a child's rumor said: 'If you want to eat new rice, We have to wait for the First Lord to come.' This is an omen. It is irreversible."" Huang Quan and Liu Ba were furious when they heard this, and wanted to kill him. Liu Zhang lived there. He suddenly reported to Xu Jing, the prefect of Shu County, that he had left the city and surrendered. Liu Zhang cried and returned to the house.","At first Xuande wants to keep Liu Zhang in the city out of respect. But Kong Ming argues, ‘There isn’t enough room for two lords. And Liu Zhang’s inability to decide has cost him his right to rule. Don’t go all wimpish on me,’ he tells Xuande. ‘ Seize the moment.’ So Liu Zhang is sent to what is in effect comfortable house arrest in Jingzhou but given an honorific title to compensate him.","But Liu Zhang was greatly distressed at the news of his fresh misfortunes, which reached him with the return of his defeated soldiers. He barred the gates and stopped all exits. Before long came news of the approach of Ma Chao with an army of rescue. The Imperial Protector then ventured to mount the walls, and soon Ma Chao and Ma Dai rode up and stood below the ramparts. And Ma Chao called out, “I wish to speak with Liu Zhang.” Then Liu Zhang showed himself, and Ma Chao plunged into the matter without more ado. “I took the leadership of Zhang Lu's army to rescue Yiazhou, little thinking that, under the calumnious advice of Yang Song, Zhang Lu would try to slay me. However, now I have gone over to the side of Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, and advise you, Sir, to do the same, you and all your officers. Thereby you will all escape harm. If any one holds on a misguided course, I shall take the city.” Such words came as a shock, and Liu Zhang paled. His feelings overcame him and he swooned. When he came to his senses, he muttered, “I am stupid and I am sorry. Better open the gates and end it. The city will be saved.” “No, no,” cried Dong He. “There are thirty thousand of good soldiers in the city and ample money and stores for a year to come. Hold out!” But Liu Zhang was broken, saying, “My father and I have ruled Shu for twenty years and have done no particular good for the people. And we have fought for three years; the grass has been be stained with the blood of my people; and the fault is mine. I could not bear it, and so I see no better way than to surrender, whereby I may bring peace to the people.” Those about him wept. One man spoke, saying, “You speak as Heaven guides you.” Turning toward him they recognized a man of Baxi named Qiao Zhou, who had the reputation of being an astrologer. “I have studied the aspect of the heavens and a multitude of stars gathered over the west, one of which shone as the full moon: a right royal star. And I recall a popular couplet of last year: “When comes the ruler from the east, Then may you on new rice feast. “None can withstand the decree of the Most High.” Liu Ba and Huang Quan, who heard these words, were very angry at such a speech and rose up to smite the speaker. But Liu Zhang stayed them. Next came news that Xu Jing, the Governor of the Shu District, had gone over to the invaders. This was the last blow. Liu Zhang went home weeping."
第一百一回　出隴上諸葛妝神,Chapter 11: Zhuge Make-up God in Longshang,CHAPTER 101 Kong Ming pretends to be a god.,"CHAPTER 101. Going Out From Longshang, Zhuge Liang Dresses"
却說高翔回見孔明，說魏兵搶奪木牛流馬各五六匹去了。孔明笑曰：“吾正要他搶去：我只費了幾匹木牛流馬，却不久便得軍中許多資助也。”諸將問曰：“丞相何以知之？”孔明曰：“司馬懿見了木牛流馬，必然倣我法度，一樣製造。那時我又有計策。”數日後，人報魏軍也會造木牛流馬，往隴西搬運糧草。孔明大喜曰：“不出吾之算也。”便喚王平分付曰：“汝引一千兵，扮作魏人，星夜偷過北原，只說是巡糧軍，混入彼運糧軍中，將護糧之人，盡皆殺散；却驅木牛流馬而回，逕奔過北原來：此處必有魏兵追趕，汝便將木牛流馬口內舌頭扭轉，牛馬就不能行動，汝等竟棄之而走。背後魏兵趕到，牽拽不動，扛擡不去。吾再有兵到，汝却回身再將牛馬舌扭過來，長驅大行，魏兵必疑為怪也。”,"But he said that Gao Xiang went back to see Kong Ming, and said that the Wei soldiers went to snatch five or six horses each from the wooden cow and the horse. Kong Ming smiled and said, ""I was just asking him to snatch it: I only spent a few wooden ox and horses, but soon I got a lot of support from the army."" It must be made in the same way as my law. At that time, I had a plan."" A few days later, it was reported that the Wei army would also build wooden cattle and horses to carry grain and grass to Longxi. Kong Ming was overjoyed and said, ""It's not worth it for me."" He called Wang Ping to share it and said, ""You brought in a thousand soldiers, pretending to be from Wei, and stole across the northern plains in the starry night. You only said that you were patrolling the grain army and mixed into the grain transport army. , kill all the people who are protecting the grain, but drive the wooden ox and horses back, and run straight across the northern plains: there must be Wei soldiers chasing, you will twist the tongue of the wooden ox and the horse, and the ox and horse will not be able to move, and you have abandoned them. Then go away. The Wei soldiers from behind arrive, but they can’t pull them, and they can’t carry them away. When another soldier arrives, you turn around and twist the ox and horse’s tongue again, and drive the big line, and the Wei soldiers must be suspicious.”","Zheng Wen is, of course, executed, and then Kong Ming tries to draw the Wei army out to the attack, but to no avail. He realizes that what he needs is a lure, a trick to make the Wei army come out so that he can destroy them. He also needs fresh supplies of grain to feed his army and by a series of plots and plans he tricks the Wei and captures their own grain wagons. This at last provokes Sima Yi into sending out his men to the attack. And they fall into Kong Ming’s long-planned ambush. Hearing the cries of his men, Sima Yi rides out himself to the rescue, but he is trapped, and his men desert, leaving him stranded.","Gao Xiang returned to camp and reported the loss of a few of his wooden oxen and horses. “I wished him to capture some of them,” said Zhuge Liang, much pleased. “I am just laying out these few, and before long I shall get some very solid help in exchange.” “How do you know, O Minister,” said his officers. “Because Sima Yi will certainly copy them; and when he has done that, I have another plan ready to play on him.” Some days later Zhuge Liang received a report that the enemy were using the same sort of wooden bullocks and horses to bring up supplies from Xizhou. “Exactly as I thought,” said be. Calling Wang Ping, he said, “Dress up a thousand soldiers as those of Wei, and find your way quickly and secretly to Beiyuan. Tell them that you are escort for the convoy, and mingle with the real escort. Then suddenly turn on them so that they scatter. Next you will turn the herd this way. By and by you will be pursued. When that occurs, you will give a turn to the tongues of the wooden animals, and they will be locked from movement. Leave them where they are and run away. When the soldiers of Wei come up, they will be unable to drag the creatures and equally unable to carry them. I shall have soldiers ready, and you will go back with them, give the tongues a backward turn and bring the convoy here, The enemy will be greatly astonished.”"
却說樊城圍解，曹仁引衆將來見曹操，泣拜請罪。操曰：“此乃天數，非汝等之罪也。”操重賞三軍，親至四冢寨，周圍閱視，顧謂諸將曰：“荊州兵圍塹鹿角數重，徐公明深入其中，竟獲全功。孤用兵三十餘年，未敢長驅逕入敵圍。公明眞膽識兼優者也！”衆皆歎服。操班師還於摩陂駐紮。徐晃兵至，操親出寨迎之。見晃軍皆按隊伍而行，並無差亂。操大喜曰：“徐將軍眞有周亞夫之風矣！”遂封徐晃為平南將軍，同夏侯尚守襄陽，以遏關公之師。操因荊州未定，就屯兵於摩陂，以候消息。,"But he said that the siege of Fancheng was resolved, and Cao Ren led the crowd to meet Cao Cao in the future, crying and begging for sin. Cao said, ""This is the number of days, and it's not your fault."" Cao Zhong rewarded the three armies, went to the Sizhong village in person, looked around, and said to the generals, ""Jingzhou soldiers surrounded the moat with several deer horns, and Xu Gongming went deep into it. , actually got all the merits. I have been alone for more than 30 years, and I have not dared to drive into the enemy's siege. Gongming is truly courageous and talented!"" Everyone was amazed. The class teacher is also stationed in Mopi. When Xu Huang arrived, he went out of the village to welcome him. It can be seen that the Huang army is all walking according to the team, and there is no confusion. Cao was overjoyed and said, ""General Xu really has Zhou Yafu's style!"" Then he made Xu Huang the general of Pingnan, and guarded Xiangyang with Xiahou Shang, in order to restrain Guan Gong's division. Cao Cao was undecided in Jingzhou, so he stationed troops in Mopi to wait for news.","Cao Cao’s arrival has lifted the siege of Fancheng. Cao Ren comes before his father, mortified that he has had to summon him. ‘This is the destiny set by Heaven – not by you,’ his father says. By now Guan Yu has run out of places to find safety because he now knows Jiangling has fallen. He is caught between the Wei and Wu forces. He is advised to write urgently to Lü Meng, now ensconced in Jingzhou, reminding him that once they were on the same side in the struggle against Cao Cao and suggesting that they become allies again.","With tears he acknowledged his fault and asked pardon. “It was the will of heaven, and no fault of yours,” said Cao Cao; and he rewarded the armies. When he visited Sizhong and had inspected the captured stockades, he remarked on the defenses, saying, “Xu Huang was very clever to overcome these. With my thirty years of war, I should not have dared to penetrate such opposition. He is valiant and wise, and both in a high degree.” “Aye,” said they with him, for they could not but agree. Cao Cao's army marched back to Mopo and there camped. When Xu Huang returned, Cao Cao went out of the stockade to meet him, and netted with joy when seeing the excellent order and discipline that his army showed. Every soldier was in his place, the ranks perfectly kept, all without a trace of disorder. “General Xu Huang has the spirit of the old Zhou Yafu,” said Cao Cao, and on the spot conferred on his commander the title of General Who Pacifies the South. Xu Huang was sent soon after to share in the defense of Xiangyang with Xiahou Shang to meet Guan Yu's army. Jingzhou being still in turmoil, Cao Cao remained at Mopo waiting for news."

却說黃忠、嚴顏到關上，孟達、霍峻見了，心中亦笑孔明久調度：“是這般緊要去處，如何只敎兩個老的來！”黃忠謂嚴顏曰：“你見諸人動靜麼？他笑我二人年老，今可建奇功，以服衆心。”嚴顏曰：“願聽將軍之令。”兩個商議定了，黃忠引軍下關，與張郃對陣。張郃出馬，見了黃忠，笑曰：“你許大年紀，猶不識羞，尚欲出陣耶！”忠怒曰：“豎子欺吾年老！吾手中寶刀却不老！”遂拍馬向前與郃決戰。二馬相交，約戰二十餘合，忽然背後喊聲起：原來是嚴顏從小路抄在張郃軍後。兩軍夾攻，張郃大敗。連夜趕去，張郃兵退八九十里。黃忠、嚴顏收兵入寨，俱各按兵不動。曹洪聽知張郃輸了一陣，又欲見罪。郭淮曰：“張郃被迫，必投西蜀；今可遣將助之，就如監臨，使不生外心。”曹洪從之，卽遣夏侯惇之姪夏侯尚并降將韓玄之弟韓浩，二人引五千兵，前來助戰。二將卽時起行，到張郃寨中，問及軍情。郃言：“老將黃忠，甚是英雄；更有嚴顏相助，不可輕敵。”韓浩曰：“我在長沙知此老賊利害。他和魏延獻了城池，害吾親兄，今旣相遇，必當報讎。”遂與夏侯尚引新軍離寨前進。原來黃忠連日哨探，已知路徑。嚴顏曰：“此去有山名天蕩山：山中乃曹操屯糧積草之地。若取得那個去處，斷其糧草，漢中可得也。”忠曰：“將軍之言，正合吾意。可與吾如此如此。”嚴顏依計，自領一枝軍去了。,"But they said that Huang Zhong and Yan Yan were at the gate, and Meng Da and Huo Jun saw them, and they also laughed at Kong Mingjiu's dispatch: ""It's such an urgent place, how can you only send two old people here!"" Huang Zhong said to Yan Yan, ""You Did you see the movement of everyone? He laughed at me that we are both old, and now we can do some amazing things to convince everyone."" Yan Yan said, ""I would like to listen to the general's order."" , against Zhang He. Zhang He came out of the horse, saw Huang Zhong, smiled and said, ""You are so old, you still don't know how to be ashamed, and you still want to go out!"" Zhong said angrily, ""Shuzi deceives me when I am old! The sword in my hand is not old!"" A decisive battle with He. The two horses crossed each other, and they fought for more than 20 times. Suddenly, there was a shout from behind: It turned out that Yan Yan copied from the small road behind Zhang He's army. The two armies attacked and Zhang He was defeated. After rushing over overnight, Zhang He's soldiers retreated eight or ninety li. Huang Zhong and Yan Yan withdraw their troops and enter the village, and they all hold their troops and do not move. Cao Hong heard that Zhang He had lost for a while, and wanted to see the crime again. Guo Huai said: ""Zhang He is forced to go to the Western Shu; now he can send his generals to help him, just like a prisoner, so he won't have an outsider's heart."" Hao, the two led 5,000 soldiers and came to help. The second general set off at 30, and went to Zhang He Village to ask about the military situation. He Yan: ""Veteran Huang Zhong is very heroic; he is even more supportive with Yan Yan. Don't underestimate the enemy."" Han Hao said: ""I knew the interests of this old thief in Changsha. He and Wei Yan sacrificed the city and harmed my brother. If you meet, you will be rewarded."" Then he and Xiahou Shang led the new army to leave the village and advance. It turned out that Huang Zhong was sent out for several days, and the path was known. Yan Yan said: ""There is a mountain here called Tiandang Mountain: in the mountain is the place where Cao Cao's grain and grass are stored. If you get that place and cut off his grain and grass, you can get it in Hanzhong."" Zhong said: ""The general's words are exactly what I want. But it's like this with me."" Yan Yan followed his plan and went with an army.","At this Zhao Zilong and the other generals smile knowingly and leave. Arriving before Zhang He ’s forces, the two old generals are roundly abused and mocked by the defenders. Zhang He rides out to do battle with Huang Zhong, thinking this will be over swiftly. But the fight is fierce, and, unbeknown to Zhang He, that old veteran Yan Yan has used the diversion to take his men round behind Zhang He’s men. Suddenly he attacks, and Zhang He is caught between the two generals and their men. Zhang He is roundly defeated and forced to retreat many miles and regroup his shattered forces. Once again Cao Hong is furious at yet another failure and sends reinforcements led by Xiahou Shang and Han Hao to assist Zhang He. Now, while this is taking place, Huang Zhong’s spies have reported back that Cao Cao has built his supply base at Tiandang mountain. They conclude that if they can cut that off, then Hanzhong will fall. So Yan Yan sets off to put into place his part of their new plan.","In due course the two Veteran Generals arrived at the Pass. At sight of them, Meng Da and Huo Jun, the defenders of the Pass, laughed in their hearts, thinking: “Zhuge Liang has slipped up in his calculations in sending such a pair of dotards on such an important mission.” Huang Zhong said to Yan Yan, “You see the behavior of these people? They are laughing at us because we are old. Now we will do something that will win admiration from all the world.” “I should be glad to hear your orders,” replied Yan Yan. The two generals came to a decision how to act. Huang Zhong led his army down below to meet Zhang He in the open plain. Both drew up their array. When Zhang He rode out and saw his venerable opponent, he laughed in his face. “You must be very old, and yet you are unashamed to go into the battle, eh?” said Zhang He. “You menial!” replied the veteran. “Do you despise me for my age? You will find my good sword, however, young enough.” So he urged forward his steed and rode at Zhang He. The two chargers met and a score of bouts were fought. Then suddenly a great shouting came from the rear. Yan Yan had come up and fallen upon the rear portion of Zhang He's army. Thus attacked on two sides, Zhang He was defeated. The pursuit did not cease with nightfall, and Zhang He was driven back near thirty miles. Contented with this success, Huang Zhong and Yan Yan went into their camp, where they rested their soldiers for a time. When Cao Hong heard of Zhang He's new defeat, he was going to exact the penalty. But Guo Huai persuaded him to forbear. “If he is pressed too hard, he may take refuge in Shu,” said Guo Huai. “Rather send him help. You will thus keep a hold over him and prevent his desertion.” Wherefore Xiahou Shang and Han Hao were sent with reinforcements. Xiahou Shang was a nephew of Xiahou Dun, and Han Hao was the brother of Han Xuan, the late Governor of Changsha. They had five thousand troops. The two generals soon reached Zhang He, and asked how now the situation was going. “That old man Huang Zhong is really a hero;” said Zhang He, “and with Yan Yan's help he is very formidable.” “When I was at Changsha, I heard the old man was very fierce. He and Wei Yan yielded the city to Liu Bei and killed my own brother. Now that I shall meet him, I can have my revenge,” said Han Hao. So he and Xiahou Shang led out the new army. Now, by means of spies Huang Zhong had got a thorough knowledge of the country, and Yan Yan said, “Hereabout there is a mountain named Tiandang Mountain wherein Cao Hong has stored his supplies. If we can gain its possession, we shall reduce the enemy to want and we shall get Hanzhong.” Huang Zhong replied, “I think so, too, and so let us do so and so.” Yan Yan agreed with him and marched off with a body of troops to carry out his part in the stratagem."
早有伏路小軍飛報入寨，冷苞早已準備了。一聲礮響，三軍上馬，殺將出來。魏延縱馬提刀，與冷苞接戰。二將交馬，戰到三十合，川兵分兩路來襲漢軍。漢軍走了半夜，人馬力乏，抵當不住，退後便走。魏延聽得背後陣脚亂，撇了冷苞，撥馬回走。川兵隨後趕來，漢軍大敗。走不到五里，山背後鼓聲震地，鄧賢引一彪軍從山谷裏截出來，大叫：“魏延快下馬受降！”魏延策馬飛奔，那馬忽失前蹄，雙足跪地，將魏延掀將下來。鄧賢馬奔到，挺鎗來刺魏延。鎗未到處，弓弦響，鄧賢倒撞下馬。後面冷苞方欲來救，一員大將，從山坡上躍馬而來，厲聲大叫：“老將黃忠在此！”舞刀直取冷苞。冷苞抵敵不住，望後便走。黃忠乘勢追趕，川兵大亂。,"A small army from Fulu had already reported to enter the village, and Leng Bao had already prepared. With a bang, the three armies mounted their horses, and the generals came out. Wei Yan rode his horse with a sword and fought against Leng Bao. The two generals handed over their horses, and when the battle reached 30, the Sichuan soldiers attacked the Han army in two directions. The Han army left in the middle of the night, lacking in strength and unable to stand up, so they retreated and left. Wei Yan heard the confusion behind his back, put aside his cold bud, and turned his horse back. The Sichuan soldiers came later, and the Han army was defeated. Before they could walk five miles, the sound of drums shook the ground behind the mountain. Deng Xian led a force of soldiers to intercept it from the valley and shouted, ""Wei Yan, get off his horse and surrender!"" Kneeling down, he lifted Wei Yan down. Deng Xian rushed to the horse and stabbed Wei Yan with a gun. Before the gun was everywhere, the bowstring rang, and Deng Xian knocked and dismounted. Leng Baofang was about to come to the rescue, but a general came prancing from the hillside and shouted, ""Veteran Huang Zhong is here!"" Leng Bao couldn't resist the enemy, and left after looking. Huang Zhong took advantage of the situation to chase, and the Sichuan soldiers were in chaos.","In the end Deng Xian’s men from the other camp also join the attack on the enemy. The foolish Wei Yan is about to be killed by Deng Xian himself when an arrow takes Deng Xian down, and the cry goes up, ‘Old man Huang Zhong has come.’","Early as it was, yet the camp commander was on the alert, for the advancing force had been observed by his scouts. At the first sign of attack, the defenders poured out in full force. Wei Yan galloped up and made straight for Ling Bao. These two fought twenty or so of bouts, and then the troops of the Western Land of Rivers came up and joined in the battle. The troops of Jingzhou under Wei Yan having marched a long distance, were fatigued and could not withstand this onslaught, so they fell back. Wei Yan heard the confused sound of hoofs behind him and, giving up all thought of finishing his encounter with Ling Bao, turned his horse and fled. The troops of the Western Land of Rivers kept up the pursuit, and the attackers were defeated and retired. They had gone about two miles when another army of Yiazhou appeared from behind some hills. They advanced with heating drums. Their leader, Deng Xian, shouted to Wei Yan to surrender, but Wei Yan heeded him not; whipping up his steed he fled the faster. However, the tired horse tripped and fell on its knees, throwing its rider to the ground. Deng Xian's forces came galloping up, and he himself set his spear to thrust and slay Wei Yan. Before the spear could get where it was supposed to be, twang! went a bowstring, and Deng Xian lay prone upon the earth. Ling Bao, Deng Xian's colleague, rode up quickly to his rescue, but just then a body of horse came dashing down the hill, and their leader shouted, “General Huang Zhong is here!” With uplifted sword Huang Zhong rode toward Ling Bao, who turned his steed and galloped off to the rear. Huang Zhong pursued, and the army of Yiazhou were thrown into confusion."

曹操看畢，大笑曰：“孫仲謀不欺我也。”重賞來使，遂下令班師，命廬江太守朱光，鎮守皖城，自引大軍回許昌。孫權亦收軍歸秣陵。權與衆將商議：“曹操雖然北去，劉備尚在葭萌關未還。何不引拒曹操之兵，以取荊州？”張昭獻計曰：“且未可動兵。某有一計，使劉備不能再還荊州。”正是：,"After Cao Cao saw it, he laughed and said, ""Sun Zhongmou will not deceive me."" He rewarded the envoys heavily, and then ordered the class division to order Zhu Guang, the prefect of Lujiang, to guard the city of Anhui, and lead the army back to Xuchang. Sun Quan also withdrew his army and returned to Moring. Quan discussed with the generals: ""Although Cao Cao has gone north, Liu Bei is still at Jiameng Pass and has not returned. Why not invite Cao Cao's troops to take Jingzhou?"" Zhang Zhao offered a plan and said: ""And there is no way to move troops. There is a plan to send Liu Bei. I can no longer return Jingzhou."" It is exactly:","Sun Quan and his advisers are triumphant and start to think that now is the time, with Xuande still away and a victorious army, to seize Jingzhou. But this is opposed by Zhang Zhao. ‘This is not the time to attack. Instead, I have an idea which will mean that Xuande never returns to Jingzhou.’ So what is this plan?","Cao Cao read the letter and laughed. “Sun Quan speaks the truth!” said he. He rewarded the messenger and issued orders to retreat. The Governor of Lujiang, Zhu Guang, was left to guard Huancheng; the army marched for the capital. Sun Quan returned to Moling. At a meeting of his advisers he said, “Cao Cao has marched north, Liu Bei is at Jiameng Pass; why should I not lead the army that has just repulsed the northern forces to take Jingzhou?” Thereupon Zhang Zhao offered another plan, saying, “Do not move a soldier; I know how to keep Liu Bei from returning to Jingzhou.” Cao Cao's army march away,"

冬十月，魏王宮成，差人往各處收取奇花異果，栽植後苑。有使者到吳地，見了孫權，傳魏王令旨，再往温州取柑子。時孫權正尊讓魏王，便令人於本城選了大柑子四十餘擔，星夜送往鄴郡。至中途，挑擔役夫疲困，歇於山脚下，見一先生，眇一眼，跛一足，頭戴白藤冠，身穿靑懶衣，來與脚夫作禮，言曰：“你等挑擔勞苦，貧道都替你挑一肩何如？”衆人大喜。於是先生每擔各挑五里。但是先生挑過的擔兒都輕了。衆皆驚疑。先生臨去，與領柑子官說：“貧道乃魏王鄕中故人：姓左，名慈，字元放，道號‘烏角先生’。如你到鄴郡，可說左慈申意。”遂拂袖而去。,"In October of winter, when the palace of the King of Wei was completed, he sent people to collect exotic flowers and fruits and plant them in the back garden. A messenger came to Wu, met Sun Quan, passed the order of the King of Wei, and then went to Wenzhou to fetch oranges. At that time, Sun Quan was respecting the king of Wei, so he ordered more than forty dandelions of big oranges to be selected from the city and sent to Ye County in the starry night. In the middle of the journey, the porter was tired and rested at the foot of the mountain. When he saw Mr. Yi, he stared at him, limping on one foot, wearing a white cane crown, and wearing a lazy coat. , how about the poor road pick a shoulder for you?"" Everyone was overjoyed. So the gentleman picked five miles for each load. But the burden that Mr. had carried was light. Everyone was astonished. When the master arrived, he said to the leader of the orange sub-guan: ""Pin Dao is an old friend of the Wei King Yanzhong: his surname is Zuo, his first name is Ci, his character is Yuanfang, and his road name is 'Mr. Wujiao'. If you go to Ye County, you can say Zuo Cishen's meaning."" Then he walked away.","When his palace is completed, Cao Cao wants to create an exotic garden and so sends men across the land to find rare plants. He also loves sweet oranges, and this brings his men to Wu and to visit Sun Quan. Now that a sort of peace has been established, he wishes to express his gratitude and so he has forty loads of these oranges prepared and sends them to Cao Cao’s new palace. En route the porters stop to rest at the base of a hill. Suddenly an old man, half blind and lame, wearing old and odd clothes, appears. ‘Looks like you need some help,’ he says. ‘Can an old Daoist be of assistance?’ And so saying, he heaves up one of the loads and goes some distance with them. When it comes time for him to leave, the others notice that their own loads seem to have become much lighter. As he departs, the old man says, ‘This poor Daoist is known as Zuo Ci and has the Daoist name Master Blackhorn. He comes from the same village as your king of Wei. When you reach him, please give him my best wishes.’ And with that he disappears.","In the winter of that year, in the tenth month, the building of the palace of the new Prince of Wei was completed and the furnishing begun. From all parts were collected rare flowers and uncommon trees to beautify the gardens. One agent went into the South Land and saw Sun Quan, to whom he presented a letter from Cao Cao asking that he might be allowed to proceed to Wenzhou to get some oranges. At that period Sun Quan was in a most complaisant mood toward Cao Cao, so from the orange trees in his own city, he picked forty loads of very fine fruits and sent them immediately to Yejun. On the way, the bearers of the oranges fell tired, and they had to stop at the foot of a certain hill. There came along an elderly man, blind of one eye and lame of one leg, who wore a white rattan head-dress and a black loose robe. He saluted the bearers and stayed to talk. Presently he said, “Your burdens are heavy, O porters; may this old Taoist lend you a shoulder? What do you say?” Naturally they were pleased enough, and the amiable wayfarer bore each load for two miles. When they resumed their burdens, they noticed that the loads seemed lighter than before, and they felt rather suspicious. When the Taoist was taking his leave of the officer in charge of the party, he said, “I am an old friend from the same village as the Prince of Wei. My name is Zuo Ci. Among Taoists I bear the appellation of 'Black-Horn'. When you get to the end of your journey, you may say that I was inquiring after your lord.” Zuo Ci shook down his sleeves and left."

却說司馬師左眼肉瘤，不時痛癢，乃命醫官割之，以藥封閉，連日在府養病；必聞淮南告急，乃請太尉王肅商議。肅曰：“昔關雲長威震華夏，孫權令呂蒙襲取荊州，撫恤將士家屬，因此關公軍勢瓦解。今淮南將士家屬，皆在中原，可急撫恤，更以兵斷其歸路，必有土崩之勢矣。”師曰：“公言極善。但吾新割目瘤，不能自往——若使他人，心又不穩。”時中書侍郎鍾會在側，進言曰：“淮楚兵強，其鋒甚銳；若遣人領兵去退，多是不利。倘有疎虞，則大事廢矣。”師蹶然起曰：“非吾自往，不可破賊！”遂留弟司馬昭守洛陽，總攝朝政。師乘輭輿，帶病東行。令鎮東將軍諸葛誕，總督豫州諸軍，從安風津取壽春；又令征東將軍胡遵，領靑州諸軍，出譙、宋之地，絕其歸路；又遣荊州刺史監軍王基，領前部兵，先取鎮南之地。師領大軍屯於襄陽，聚文武於帳下商議。光祿勳鄭袤曰：“毋丘儉好謀而無斷，文欽有勇而無智。今大軍出其不意。江、淮之卒，銳氣正盛，不可輕敵；只宜深溝高壘，以挫其銳——此亞夫之長策也。”監軍王基曰：“不可：淮南之反，非軍民思亂也；皆因毋丘儉勢力所逼，不得已而從之。若大軍一臨，必然瓦解。”師曰：“此言甚妙。”遂進兵於（氵隱）水之上，中軍屯於（氵隱）橋。基曰：“南頓極好屯兵，可提兵星夜取之：若遲則毋丘儉必先至矣。”師遂令王基前部兵來南頓城下寨。,"However, he said that Sima Shi had a tumor in his left eye, which was painful and itchy from time to time, and ordered the medical officer to cut it off, seal it with medicine, and recuperate in the house for days. Su said: ""In the past, Guan Yunchang had a huge shock in Huaxia, and Sun Quan ordered Lv Meng to attack Jingzhou and give relief to the families of the soldiers. Therefore, Guan Gong's army disintegrated. Today, the families of the soldiers in Huainan are all in the Central Plains. The situation is high.” The master said: “The public words are very good. But I have recently cut the tumor on my eyes, and I can’t go on my own. If I make others, my heart will not be stable.” Zhongshu’s servant Lang Zhonghui was on the side, and he said: “Huaichu The army is strong and its front is very sharp; if you send people to lead the army to retreat, it will be disadvantageous. If there is a danger, the big thing will be abolished."" The teacher jumped up and said: ""If I don't go on my own, I can't break the bandit!"" His younger brother, Sima Zhao, guarded Luoyang and was the chief regent. The teacher traveled eastward with illness. Zhuge Dan, the general of Zhendong, was ordered to govern all the troops of Yuzhou to take Shouchun from Anfengjin; Hu Zun, the general of Zhengdong, was ordered to lead the troops of Jinzhou to leave the land of Qiao and Song, and they must not return; they also sent the governor of Jingzhou. The army king base, led the front troops, first took the land of Zhennan. The division led a large army to settle in Xiangyang, and gathered Wen and Wu to discuss under the tent. Guang Luxun Zheng Tiao said: ""Wuqiujian is scheming but unstoppable, Wen Qin has courage but no wisdom. Today's army is unexpected. The soldiers of Jiang and Huai are vigorous and vigorous, and the enemy should not be underestimated; Its sharpness—this is Yafu’s long-term strategy.” Wang Ji, the supervisor of the army, said: “It is impossible: the opposite of Huainan is not because the army and the people are in chaos; It will inevitably collapse."" The master said, ""That's a wonderful statement."" Then the army marched on the (Qiyin) water, and the Chinese army stationed at the (Qiyin) bridge. Ji said: ""Nantun is very good at gathering troops, and he can send troops to take it in the night. If it is late, Qiu Jian will come first.""","It is in Huainan, under the leadership of Wen Qin, governor of Yangzhou, and Guanqiu Jian, a famous general, that the rebellion breaks out.","Now that mole below the left eye of Sima Shi used to pain at times, and he decided to have it removed. The surgeon excised it, closed and dressed the wound, and the patient rested quietly in his palace till it should heal. It was at this time that he received the disquieting news of opposition to his authority. Whereupon he called in Commander Wang Su to discuss the matter. Said Wang Su, quoting Guan Yu as an example, “When Guan Yu was most famous, Sun Quan sent Lu Meng to capture Jingzhou. What did Lu Meng do? He first won over the officers of Guan Yu by taking care of their families and thus broke the power of his enemy like a tile. Now the families of all the officers in the South of River Huai are here in the Middle Land. Treat them well, at the same time taking care that they do not get away, and you will be irresistible.” “Your words are good,” said Sima Shi. “However, I cannot go out to war till I have recovered. Yet, to send another is to take great risks, and I shall feel insecure.” There was also present Secretary Zhong Hui, who here interposed, saying, “The forces of the South of River Huai and Chu are very formidable. If you send another, there is danger whatever happens; and if your leader makes a serious mistake, your whole policy will fail.” “No one but myself can succeed,” cried Sima Shi, starting from his couch. “I must go.” So, in spite of illness, he resolved to lead in person. He left his brother in charge of affairs at Luoyang and set out, traveling in a padded carriage. Zhuge Dan, General Who Guards the East, was given command over all the forces of Yuzhou and ordered to march from Anfeng and to take possession of Shouchun. Hu Zun, General Who Conquers the East, with the Qingzhou forces, was sent to bar any retreat at Qiaosong. Wang Ji, Imperial Protector of Yuzhou and Army Inspector, was sent to capture Chennan. To his camp at Xiangyang, Sima Shi summoned all his officers to a council. Zheng Mao spoke first, saying, “Guanqiu Jian is fond of laying plans, but slow to come to any decision. His fellow-conspirator Wen Qin is bold, but imprudent. Now this scheme of theirs is too large for their minds; but as their soldiers are full of spirit, they should not be engaged lightly. We should remain on the defensive till their ardor has burned out. This is what Zhou Yafu of old time did.” But Wang Ji objected, saying, “This is not a rising of the people, nor of the soldiers, but is the work of Guanqiu Jian. The people are merely his tools and cannot help themselves. The rebellion will go to pieces as soon as an army approaches the county.” “I agree with you,” replied Sima Shi. Then he advanced upon River Ying and camped by the bridge. Wang Ji said, “The city of Nandun is an excellent camping ground; occupy it at once, for if not the enemy will do so.” Sima Shi sent Wang Ji to carry out his own plan."
却說姜維傳令退兵。廖化曰：“‘將在外，君命有所不受。’今雖有詔，未可動也。”張翼曰：“蜀人為大將軍連年動兵，皆有怨望；不如乘此得勝之時，收回人馬，以安民心，再作良圖。”維曰：“善。”遂令各軍依法而退。命廖化、張翼斷後，以防魏兵追襲。,"However, Jiang Wei ordered to retreat. Liao Hua said: ""'The generals are outside, and the emperor's orders will not be accepted.' Although there is an edict, it has not been moved."" Zhang Yi said: ""The people of Shu have used troops for the generals for years, and they all have resentment; it is better to take advantage of this victory, Take back the troops, in order to reassure the people, and then make a good plan."" Wei said: ""Good."" Then he ordered the troops to retreat according to law. He ordered Liao Hua and Zhang Yi to break down to prevent Wei soldiers from pursuing them.","Whatever other faults he has, Jiang Wei knows how to manage a retreat. Instead of a rout, he makes a tactical withdrawal, safeguarding his men with a strong rearguard force to protect them, so much so that Deng Ai, observing it, decides not to attack, and thus the Shu army make their way back safely to the land of Shu.","Jiang Wei Defeats The Wei Army. When the order to retreat was given, Liao Hua said, “A leader in the field is independent and need not obey even the command of his prince.” Zhang Yi said, “The country begins to resent these many years of war; rather take the occasion of the victory you have just won to return and pacify the people.” “It is good,” said Jiang Wei. A systematic and orderly retirement began. The army of Wei, loth to forgo an opportunity, followed, but the absence of the least confusion gave them no chance."

The chiefs of the caves were called and said: ""All the armies have all their firearms. When they arrive at the Shu village tonight, they will set fire to the number. I will take the central army and capture Zhuge Liang."" , each came across the Lushui. Meng Huo led more than 100 confidantes and barbarians to throw Kongming Dazhai directly, and there was no army in the way. Going to the gate of the village, Huo and his generals rushed in—it was an empty village, and there was no one in sight. He was bumped into the central army, only to see the candles in the tent shining brightly, Meng You and all the soldiers were drunk. It turned out that Meng You was under the control of Kong Ming, Ma Su and Lv Kai, who made Le Ren play a zaju, diligently persuaded him to drink, and put medicine in the wine, and they all fainted, just like people who died of drunkenness. Meng Huo went into the account and asked him, there were people who were awake, but they were just pointing. Knowing the plan, Meng You and others were rescued. But when they rushed back to the squadron, the shouts in front were loud, and the fire broke out suddenly. Surprised, when he rushed to the left team, the flames soared into the sky, and a Biao army was killed: Wei Yan was the leader of the Shu general. Huo hurriedly looked at the right team, and saw the fire flared up again, and another Biao army was killed: Zhao Yun was the leader of the Shu general. The Three Route Army will attack in the future, and there will be no way out. Meng Huo abandoned the sergeant and fled on his horse looking at the Lushui. When I saw dozens of savage soldiers on the Lushui River, driving a small boat, they were panicked and ordered to approach the shore. The men and horses disembarked just now, and a horn sounded, tying Meng Huo. It turned out that Ma Dai had received a trick, and invited the soldiers of the headquarters to pretend to be savage soldiers, and punted the boat here to lure Meng Huo.","The plot, of course, is that Meng You’s soldiers will open the gates for an attack by the massed tribes of the Man, who will burn down the camp, scatter the enemy and, as Meng Huo hopes, capture Kong Ming. But when that night Meng Huo and his men storm the camp they find it deserted and their men on the inside drunk and drugged, lying on the floor of Kong Ming’s tent.","This was pleasing news, and Meng Huo prepared his thirty thousand troops ready to march out to the camp. They were divided into three divisions. The King called up his chieftains and notables, and said, “Let each army carry the means of making fire, and as soon as they arrive let a light be shown as a signal. I am coming to the main camp to capture Zhuge Liang.” With these orders they marched, and they crossed River Lu at sunset. The King, with a hundred generals as escort, pressed on at once toward the main camp of Shu. They met with no opposition. They even found the main gate open, and Meng Huo and his party rode straight in. But the camp was a desert; not a soldier was visible. Meng Huo rode right up to the large tent and pushed open the flap. It was brilliantly lighted with lamps, and lying about under their light were his brother and all his men, dead drunk. Zhuge Liang had ordered Ma Su and Lu Kai to entertain Meng You and his men with wine and dance performances. The wine they had been pressed to drink while the plays were going on had been heavily drugged, and they had fallen down almost as soon as they had swallowed it. One or two who had recovered a little could not speak: they only pointed to their mouths. Meng Huo then saw that he had been the simple victim of another ruse. However, he picked up his brother and the others and started off to return to his main army. But as he turned, torches began to flash out and drums to beat. The Mangs were frightened and took to their heels. But they were pursued, and the pursuing cohort was led by Wang Ping. The King bore away to the left to escape, but again a cohort appeared in front of him; Wei Yan was there. Meng Huo tried the other side; and was stopped by Zhao Yun. He was in a trap; and attacked on three sides and no fourth to escape by, what could he do? He abandoned everything, making one wild rush for the River Lu. As he reached the river bank, he saw a bark on the river with Mang soldiers on board. Here was safety. He hailed the boat and jumped on board as soon as it touched the bank. No sooner had he embarked than suddenly he was seized and bound. The boat, which Ma Dai had provided and prepared, was part of the general plan, and the Mang soldiers therein were Ma Dai's soldiers disguised."

If there is a change in the past, why should he regret it? It is better to invite the queen mother and the emperor to join the expedition, so that it can be safe."" Zhaoxi said. ""This statement is exactly in line with my intention."" Then he entered the empress dowager and said: ""Zhuge Dan rebelled, and the ministers raised civil and military bureaucrats. The plan should be stopped: please ask the empress dowager to accompany the emperor to go on a personal expedition, so as to follow the will of the previous emperor."" The empress dowager was afraid and had to follow it. . The next day, Zhao invited Cao Mao, the Lord of Wei, to set off. Mao said: ""The great general is in charge of the army and horses of the world, and he can be dispatched, so why should I do it myself?"" Zhao said: ""Otherwise: in the past, when the ancestors of Wu traversed the four seas, Emperor Wen and Emperor Ming had the will to include the universe, and the heart of annexing the eight wastelands. You must do it on your own. Your Majesty is in the right place to match your predecessors, to sweep away the past, why should you be afraid of yourself?"" Mao was afraid of authority, so he had to follow it. Zhao Sui issued an edict to mobilize 260,000 soldiers from the two capitals, and ordered Wang Ji, the general of Zhennan, to be the front vanguard, Chen Qian, the general of Andong, to be the deputy vanguard, Shi Bao, the supervisor of the army, to be the left army, and the governor of Yanzhou, Zhou Tai, to be the right army. Protect the car driver, mighty, and come to Huainan.","When Zhuge Dan’s memorial to the emperor arrives at the court, Sima Zhao reads it and resolves not only to send an army to crush the revolt but to lead it himself. However, Jia Chong points out that Sima Zhao might face a revolt in the court while he is away unless he takes the imperial family with him. So Cao Mao is forced to join the army along with the queen mother. The attacking army of around two hundred and sixty thousand advances like a tidal wave towards the south, while Zhu Yi of the Wu moves his army north.","In Luoyang, Zhuge Dan's memorial angered Sima Zhao, who wished to set out to revenge the attack at once, but Jia Chong preached caution. “My lord, you derived your power from your father and brother, and people have not had time to discover your own virtue. If you leave the court and there be a revulsion of feeling against you, you will lose all. Rather request the Empress Dowager and the Son of Heaven to go with you in the expedition, and nothing is to be feared,” said Jia Chong. “That is an excellent plan.” Sima Zhao went into the Palace and proposed it to Her Majesty, saying, “Zhuge Dan is in revolt, and I and my colleagues intend to punish him. I beg that you will accompany the expedition as the late Emperor would have done.” The Empress was afraid, but dared not refuse, and the next day was requested to set out with the Ruler of Wei, Cao Mao. Cao Mao said, “General, you command all the armies and dispose them as you will; why do you ask me to go?” Sima Zhao replied, “Your Majesty is wrong to hesitate. Your ancestors traveled over the empire and wished to unite the whole under one ruler. Wherever there was a worthy opponent, they went to face him. Your Majesty should follow their example and sweep the land clean. Why fear?” Cao Mao, fearing his minister's terrible power, consented, and an edict was issued for the commands to mobilize two hundred sixty thousand troops of two capitals. Wang Ji, General Who Corrects the South, was in command of the van, and Chen Qian, General Who Pacifies the East, was second in command of the van. Shi Bao, Army Inspector, and Zhou Tai, Imperial Protector of Yangzhou, led the imperial escort. The army moved into the South of River Huai like a great flood."
孔明收得勝之兵，回到祁山時，永安城李嚴，遣都尉茍安解送糧米至軍中交割。茍安好酒，於路怠慢，違限十日。孔明大怒曰：“吾軍中專以糧為大事，誤了三日，便該處斬！汝今誤了十日，有何理說？”喝令推出斬之。長使楊儀曰：“茍安乃李嚴用人，又兼錢糧多出於西川，若殺此人，後無人敢送糧也。”孔明乃叱武士去其縛，杖八十放之。茍安被責，心中懷恨，連夜引親隨五六騎，逕奔魏寨投降。懿喚入，茍安拜告前事。懿曰：“雖然如此，孔明多謀，汝言難信。汝能為我幹一件大功，吾那時奏准天子，保汝為上將。”安曰：“但有甚事，卽當効力。”懿曰：“汝可回成都布散流言，說孔明有怨上之意，早晚欲稱為帝，使汝主召回孔明：便是汝之功。”茍安允諾，逕回成都，見了宦官，布散流言，說孔明自倚大功，早晚必將篡國。宦官聞知大驚，卽入內奏帝，細言前事。後主驚訝曰：“似此如之奈何？”宦官曰：“可詔還成都，削其兵權，免生叛逆。”後主下詔，宣孔明班師回朝。蔣琬出班奏曰：“丞相自出師以來，累建大功，何故宣回？”後主曰：“朕有機密事，必須與丞相面議。”卽遣使齎詔星夜宣孔明回。使命逕到祈山大寨，孔明接入，受詔以畢，仰天歎曰：“主上年幼，必有佞臣在側！吾正欲建功，何故取回？我如不回，是欺主也。若奉命而退，後日再難得此機會也。”姜維問曰：“若大軍退，司馬懿乘勢掩殺，當復如何？”孔明曰：“吾今退軍，可分五路而退：今日先退此營。假如營內兵一千，却掘二千竈。今日掘三千竈，明日掘四千竈，每日退軍，添竈而行。”楊儀曰：“昔孫臏擒龐涓，用添兵減竈之法；今丞相退兵，何故增竈？”孔明曰：“司馬懿善能用兵，知吾退兵，必然追趕；心中疑吾有伏兵，定於舊營內數竈；見每日增竈，兵又不知退與不退，則疑而不敢追。吾徐徐而退，自無損兵之患。”遂傳令退軍。,"When Kong Ming received the victorious soldiers and returned to Qishan, Li Yan of Yongan City sent the captain Gou Anjie to deliver grain and rice to the army for delivery. Gou An is fond of wine, but he neglects Yu Lu and violates the limit for ten days. Kong Ming was furious and said: ""Our military secondary school regards food as a major event. If you miss it for three days, you should be executed! You have missed ten days now, what's the reason?"" He ordered to be executed. The envoy Yang Yi said, ""Gou An is Li Yan's servant, and he also has a lot of money and grain from Xichuan. If you kill this person, no one will dare to send grain."" Gou An was blamed, and he held a grudge in his heart. He led him with five or six cavalry all night, and went straight to Wei Zhai to surrender. Yi called in, and Gou An asked for the past. Yi said: ""Nevertheless, Kongming is very resourceful, but you can't believe what you say. You can do a great job for me, and then I made the right son of the emperor to protect you as an admiral."" An said: ""But what is the matter? Effectiveness."" Yi said: ""You can go back to Chengdu to spread rumors that Kongming has resentment and wants to be called emperor sooner or later, so that your master will recall Kongming: it is your work."" Gou An promised, and went back to Chengdu. When he met the eunuch, he spread rumors that Kongming would take over the country sooner or later. The eunuch was shocked when he heard about it, so he entered the palace and played the emperor, detailing the past. The Empress Dowager was surprised and said, ""So what can I do?"" The eunuch said, ""You can order Chengdu to return to Chengdu, cut down its military power, and avoid rebellion."" When Jiang Wan left the class, he said: ""The prime minister has made great achievements since he left the division. Why did he announce his return?"" The mission went to Qishan Dazhai, Kongming joined in, and after receiving the edict, he looked up to the sky and sighed: ""The Lord is young, and there must be a minister on the side! I am trying to make merit, why take it back? If I don't return, I will deceive the Lord. If you are ordered to retreat, there will be a rare opportunity in the future."" Jiang Wei asked: ""If the army retreats and Sima Yi takes advantage of the situation to cover up the attack, what should I do?"" Kong Ming said: ""I retreat now, and I can retreat in five ways: I retreat first today. In this camp, if there are 1,000 soldiers in the camp, but 2,000 stoves are dug. Today, 3,000 stoves are dug, and 4,000 stoves are dug tomorrow. Every day, the army retreats and adds stoves."" Yang Yi said: ""In the past, Sun Bin captured Pang Juan, and he used Tim The method of reducing the army; now the prime minister is withdrawing his troops, why increase the stove?"" Kong Ming said, ""Sima Yi is good at using troops, and knowing that I am retreating, he will definitely pursue it; he suspects that I have an ambush, and decides to count the stoves in the old camp; see the daily increase of stoves. , the soldiers did not know whether to retreat or not, so they were suspicious and did not dare to pursue. I retreated slowly, and I would not hurt the soldiers."" Then he ordered to retreat.","It is then that by accident Kong Ming sets in train a series of troubles. A minor official, Gou An, a drunkard and a lazy man by nature, has taken days to bring a vital supply of grain for the Shu army. Discovering this and knowing how vital supply chains are, Kong Ming is all for having him executed but is persuaded not to. Instead he orders him beaten eighty times with a whip. Burning with resentment, Gou An deserts and goes over to Sima Yi. Sima Yi sends him furtively back to Chengdu to spread rumours that Kong Ming, buoyed by his string of military successes, is now planning to usurp the throne. Gou An proves to be very effective at this, and the result is that the second ruler begins to suspect Kong Ming and, to make sure he does not rebel, summons him back to the capital. When the recall arrives at Kong Ming’s camp, he knows that behind it are lies and rumour. Although he is close to fulfilling his long-held desire of crushing Wei, he has no option but to return and bring the army back with him. However, he also knows that Sima Yi is the one behind this and therefore expects he will attack as the Shu army retreats. Through a cunning plan of making it look as if more troops have joined at each night’s stop – by the number of fire pits left where the army has camped overnight – he fools Sima Yi yet again into thinking the Shu army is expanding, not shrinking.","Zhuge Liang mustered his victorious army and returned to Qishan. Now Li Yan sent an officer, General Gou An, from Baidicheng with a convoy of grain. Gou An was a drunkard and loitered on the road so that he arrived ten days late. Zhuge Liang, angry at the delay, upbraided him, saying, “This grain is of the utmost importance to the army and you delay it. Three days' delay ought to mean the death penalty; what can you say to this delay of ten?” Gou An was sentenced to death and hustled out. But Yang Yi ventured to intervene, saying, “Gou An is a servant of Li Yan, and Li Yan has sent large supplies of all sorts from the Western Land of Rivers. If you put this man to death, perhaps others will not undertake escort duty.” Zhuge Liang then bade the executioners loose the offender, give him eighty blows, and let him go. This punishment filled Gou An's heart with bitter resentment, and, in the night, he deserted to the enemy, he and his half dozen personal staff. He was taken before Sima Yi and told the tale of his wrongs. “Your tale may be true, but it is hard to trust it,” said Sima Yi. “Zhuge Liang is full of guile. However, you may render me a service, and if you do, I will ask the Ruler of Wei that you may be allowed to serve him and obtain a post for you.” “Whatever you ask, I will do the best I can,” replied the deserter. “Then go to Chengdu and spread a lying report that Zhuge Liang is angry with the powers there and means to make himself emperor. This will get him recalled, and that will be a merit to you.” Gou An accepted the treacherous mission. In Chengdu he got hold of the eunuchs and told them his lying tale. The eunuchs became alarmed for their own safety and told the Emperor all these things. “In such a case what am I to do?” asked the Latter Ruler. “Recall him to the capital,” said the eunuchs, “and take away his military powers so that he cannot rebel.” The Latter Ruler issued an edict recalling the army. Jiang Wan said, “The Prime Minister has rendered many and great services since he led out the army; wherefore is he recalled?” “I have a private matter to consult him about,” said the Latter Ruler. “I must see him personally.” So the edict was issued and sent to Zhuge Liang. The messenger was at once received as soon as he reached Qishan. “The Emperor is young, and there is some jealous persons by his side,” said Zhuge Liang sadly. “I was just going to achieve some solid success; why am I recalled? If I go not, I shall insult my Prince; if I retire, I shall never get such a chance again.” “If the army retire, Sima Yi will attack,” said Jiang Wei. “I will retire in five divisions. Thus today this camp goes. Supposing that there are a thousand soldiers in the camp, then I shall have two thousand cooking places prepared, or if there are three thousand soldiers, then four thousand cooking plates shall be got ready; and so on, increasing the cooking arrangements as the troops are sent away.” Yang Yi said, “In the days of old, when Sun Bin was attacking Pang Juan, Sun Bin decreased the cooking arrangements as the soldiers were increased. Why do you reverse this, O Minister?” “Because Sima Yi is an able leader and would pursue if he knew we were retreating. But he would recognize the probability of an ambush; and if he sees an increase in the cooking arrangements in a camp, he will be unable to conclude whether the troops have gone or not, and he will not pursue. Thus I shall gradually withdraw without loss.” The order for retreat was given."
却說孔明入漢中，欲歸成都見後主。都護李嚴妄奏後主曰：“臣已備辦軍糧，行將運赴丞相軍前，不知丞相何故忽然班師。”後主聞奏，卽命尚書費禕入漢中見孔明，問班師之故。禕至漢中，宣後主之意。孔明大驚曰：“李嚴發書告急，說東吳將興兵寇川，因此回師。”費禕曰：“李嚴奏稱軍糧已辦，丞相無故回師，天子因此命某來問耳。”孔明大怒，令人訪察：乃是李嚴因軍糧不濟，怕丞相見罪，故發書取回，却又妄奏天子，遮飾己過。孔明大怒曰：“匹夫為一己之故，廢國家大事！”令人召至，欲斬之。費禕勸曰：“丞相念先帝託孤之意，姑且寬恕。”孔明從之。費禕卽具表啟奏後主。後主覽表，勃然大怒，叱武士推李嚴出斬之。參軍蔣琬出班奏曰：“李嚴乃先帝託孤之臣，乞望恩寬恕。”後主從之，卽謫為庶人，徙於梓潼郡閒往。,"But he said that Kong Ming had entered Hanzhong and wanted to return to Chengdu to see his later master. After the chief guard Li Yan played it, the Lord said: ""This minister has prepared the military rations, which are about to be transported to the Prime Minister's army. I don't know why the Prime Minister suddenly taught him."" . Yi went to Hanzhong, and declared the meaning of the Empress Lord. Kong Ming was shocked and said: ""Li Yan sent a letter in a hurry, saying that the Eastern Wu is going to raise troops Kochuan, so he returned to the division."" Fei Yi said: ""Li Yan reported that the military rations have been prepared, and the prime minister returned to the division for no reason. Therefore, the emperor ordered someone to come and ask the ear."" Kong Ming was furious, and he was asked to investigate: it was Li Yan who was afraid that the prime minister would meet with him because of the lack of rations. Kong Ming was furious and said, ""For the sake of one's own sake, abolish the country's affairs!"" Fei Yi persuaded him, ""The prime minister recites the late emperor's intention of entrusting the orphan, and forgive him for the time being."" Kong Ming obeyed. Fei Yi's scepter is the master after the opening of the performance. After the master looked at the list, he was furious and yelled at the samurai to push Li Yan to kill him. Jiang Wan, who joined the army, went out of the squad and said, ""Li Yan is a minister entrusted to me by the late emperor, begging for mercy and forgiveness.""","Kong Ming returns to Hanzhong and once again becomes the victim of vicious rumours claiming that he is hoarding supplies ready for a rebellion. When Kong Ming is challenged as to why he has abandoned the invasion, he exclaims with astonishment that Li Yan the adviser has sent a note informing him of a potential invasion by the Wu, and that is why he has returned. Suddenly he realizes he has been lied to, and this is all a plot to overthrow him. Kong Ming can see that the plot is unfolding, so he starts his own investigation. He finds that Li Yan is supposed to have sent supplies but has failed to do so. To cover up his error, he fabricated the note and then started the rumours in order to draw attention away from his own betrayal. When the second ruler is informed, he orders the execution of the traitor. Then, reminded that his father had chosen Li Yan as one of his council of advisers, he instead takes all Li Yan’s official posts from him and reduces him to the rank of a commoner. Having dealt with this, and also having taken on Li Yan’s son Li Feng as an adviser, Kong Ming rests the army for three years in order to restore supplies and build up the military strength.","Zhuge Liang had no sooner reached Hanzhong than he prepared to go on to Capital Chengdu and see his lord. But Li Yan, who was in the capital, said to the Latter Ruler, “Why does the Prime Minister return, for I have kept him fully supplied with all things needed for the army?” Then the Latter Ruler sent Fei Yi into Hanzhong to inquire why the army had retired. And when he had arrived and showed the cause of his coming, Zhuge Liang was greatly surprised and showed the letter from Li Yan, saying, “Li Yan wrote to warn that East Wu was about to invade the country.” Fei Yi said, “Li Yan memorialized to the Throne, saying he had sent you supplies and knew not why Your Excellency returned.” So Zhuge Liang inquired carefully, and then it came out that Li Yan had failed to find sufficient grain to keep the army supplied, and so had sent the first lying letter to the army that it might retire before the shortage showed itself. His memorial to the Throne was designed to cover the former fault. “The fool has ruined the great design of the state just to save his own skin,” cried Zhuge Liang bitterly. He called in the offender and sentenced him to death. But Fei Yi interceded, saying, “O Minister, the First Ruler had loved and trusted Li Yan with his son. Please forgive him this time.” And so Li Yan's life was spared. However, when Fei Yi made his report, the Latter Ruler was wroth and ordered Li Yan to suffer death. But this time Jiang Wan intervened, saying, “Your late father named Li Yan as one of the guardians of your youth.” And the Latter Ruler relented."
甘寧見凌統回，卽告權曰：“寧今夜只帶一百人馬去劫曹營；若折了一人一騎，也不算功。”孫權壯之，乃調撥帳下一百精銳馬兵付寧；又以酒五十瓶，羊肉五十斤，賞賜軍士。甘寧回到營中。敎一百人皆列坐，先將銀碗斟酒，自吃兩碗，乃語百人曰：“今夜奉命劫寨，請諸公各滿飲一觴，努力向前。”衆人聞言，面面相覷。甘寧見衆人有難色，乃拔劍在手，怒叱曰：“我為上將，且不惜命；汝等何得遲疑！”衆人見甘寧作色，皆起拜曰：“願効死力。”甘寧將酒肉與百人共飲。食盡，約至二更時候，取白鵝翎一百根，插於盔上為號；都披甲上馬，飛奔曹操寨邊，拔開鹿角，大喊一聲，殺入寨中，逕奔中軍來殺曹操。原來中軍人馬，以車仗伏路穿連，圍得鐵桶相似，不能得進。甘寧只將百騎，左衝右突。曹兵驚慌，正不知敵兵多少，自相擾亂。那甘寧百騎，在營內縱橫馳驟，逢着便殺。各營鼓譟，舉火如星，喊聲大震。甘寧從寨之南門殺出，無人敢當。孫權令周泰引一枝兵來接應。甘寧將百騎回到濡須。操兵恐有埋伏，不敢追襲。後人有詩讚曰：,"When Gan Ning saw Ling Tong returning, he told Quan: ""Ning will only take a hundred men and horses to rob Cao's camp tonight; if one man and one ride are broken, it will not be considered meritorious."" The soldiers paid Ning; they also rewarded the soldiers with fifty bottles of wine and fifty catties of mutton. Gan Ning returned to the camp. All a hundred people sat in line, first poured wine from silver bowls, and ate two bowls for themselves. Then they said to the hundred people, ""Tonight, I have been ordered to rob the village. Please each of you have a full drink and try your best to move forward."" . When Gan Ning saw that the crowd was embarrassed, he drew his sword in his hand, and shouted angrily, ""I am an admiral, and I will spare my life; why do you hesitate!"" When everyone saw Gan Ning's expression, they all bowed and said, ""I am willing to serve my life force. ."" Gan Ning drank wine and meat with a hundred people. After they had finished eating, at about the second watch, they took a hundred white goose feathers and put them on their helmets as a number; Run to the army to kill Cao Cao. It turned out that the Chinese soldiers and horses used chariots and battles to cross the road, and they were surrounded by iron barrels, so they could not enter. Gan Ning only had a hundred cavalry, rushing from left to right. Cao's soldiers panicked, not knowing how many enemy soldiers there were, and disturbed each other. That Gan Ning, a hundred horsemen, galloped across the camp, killing them whenever they met. The battalions roared, raised fire like stars, and shouted loudly. Gan Ning rushed out from the southern gate of the village, and no one dared to be. Sun Quan ordered Zhou Tai to lead an army to meet him. Gan Ning brought Baiqi back to Ruxu. Cao soldiers feared an ambush, did not dare to pursue. A later poem praised:","Gan Ning, delighted by his foe’s failure, asks Sun Quan for permission to attack with his one hundred men. ‘If I lose even one man, then you can say I have failed,’ he brags. In the middle of the night, Gan Ning and the one hundred set out, wearing white goose feathers in their helmets to identify themselves. Storming the barricades of the enemy camp, they create so much noise and confusion that Cao Cao’s men think they are being attacked by thousands, not by a mere hundred. Slashing their way through the camp, they spread chaos and mayhem and then, as swiftly as they arrived, they gallop out by the south gate and return triumphantly home. Not a single man or horse has died. Great is the praise heaped upon Gan Ning by Sun Quan.","When Ling Tong had come back, his rival Gan Ning went to Sun Quan and said, “Now let me have the hundred horsemen, and I will raid the enemy's camp this night. If I lose a soldier or a mount, I will claim no merit.” Sun Quan commended his courage and chose a hundred of his best veterans, whom he placed under Gan Ning's command for the raid. Sun Quan also gave him as a feast for the soldiers fifty flasks of wine and seventy five pounds of mutton. Returning to the tents, Gan Ning drew up his little force and made them sit down in rows. Then he filled two silver goblets with wine, solemnly drank to them, and said, “Comrades, tonight our orders are to raid the camp of the enemy. Wherefore fill your goblets and call up all your strength for the task.” But the men did not welcome his words; instead they looked one at another uncertain. Seeing them in this mood, Gan Ning adopted a fierce tone, drew his sword and cried, “What are you waiting for? If I, a leader of rank, can risk my life, cannot you?” Moved by the angry face of the leader, the men rose, bowed their heads and said, “We will fight to the last.” Then the wine and meat were distributed to them and each one ate his fill. The second watch was chosen as the hour to start, and each man stuck a white goose plume in his cap whereby they could recognize each other in the darkness. At the time appointed they buckled on their armor, mounted and, galloping away, quickly came to Cao Cao's camp. Hastily throwing aside the thorny barriers, they burst in with a yell that rose to the very heavens. They made straight for the center, hoping to slay Cao Cao himself. But the troops of the leader's brigade had made a rampart of their carts within which they were sheltered as if in an iron tun, so that the raiders failed to find a way in. However, Gan Ning and his small force dashed hither and thither, cutting and slashing, till Cao Cao's men were quite bewildered and frightened. They had no notion of the number of their assailants. All their efforts only increased the confusion. Wherefore the hundred men had it all their own way and rushed from point to point slaying whomever they met. But soon the drums beat in every camp and torches were lit and shouts arose, and it was time for the raiders to get away. Gan Ning led his little body of troops out through the south gate with never a soldier trying to stop him, and rode for his own camp. He met Zhou Tai, who had been sent to help him in case of need; but the need had not arisen, and the hundred heroes with their leader rode back in triumph. There was no pursuit. A poem was written praising this exploit:"
却說陸遜見蜀兵懈怠，不復隄防，升帳聚大小將士聽令曰：“吾自受命以來，未嘗出戰。今觀蜀兵，足知動靜，故欲先取江南岸一營。誰敢去取？”言未畢，韓當、周泰、凌統等應聲而出曰：“某等願往。”遜敎皆退不用，獨喚階下末將淳于丹曰：“吾與汝五千軍，去取江南第四營：蜀將傅彤所守。今晚就要成功。吾自提兵接應。”淳于丹引兵去了，又喚徐盛、丁奉曰：“汝等各領兵三千，屯於寨外五里，如淳于丹敗回，有兵趕來，當出救之，却不可追去。”二將自引軍去了。,"But he said that Lu Xun saw that the soldiers of Shu were slack and did not restore the embankment, so he raised his tent and gathered the large and small soldiers to obey the order and said: ""Since I was ordered, I have never fought. I am watching the soldiers of Shu, and I know the movement and stillness, so I want to take a battalion on the southern bank of the Yangtze River first. Who dares to go? Take it?"" Before the words were finished, Han Dang, Zhou Tai, Ling Tong, etc. responded and said, ""Some of you are willing to go."" Xun Ji all retreated, but called Chunyu Dan, the last general of the ranks, and said, ""I and you five thousand troops. , go to get the fourth battalion in Jiangnan: the general of Shu Fu Tong is guarding. It will be successful tonight. I will send troops to meet."" Chunyudan led the troops, and called Xu Sheng and Ding Feng, saying: ""You and others will lead the troops. Three thousand, who are stationed five li outside the village, like Chunyu Dan, who is defeated, and soldiers come, they should be rescued, but they cannot be chased."" The second general led his troops away.","Lu Xun can see that the troops of Shu are becoming lazy and forgetting to secure their camps properly. But to test how unprepared they are he sends out an expeditionary force to try to take one of the camps on the south. They are roundly defeated. This casts down the hopes of the commanders, but Lu Xun says, ‘I needed to test the enemy.","“There has been no fighting since I received our lord's command. I have spent the time in acquiring a knowledge of the enemy. As a preliminary operation I want to capture a camp on the south bank. Who volunteers?” Out stepped Han Dang and Zhou Tai and Ling Tong, all three at once, each crying that he wanted to be sent. But they were sent back; the Commander-in-Chief did not want any of them. Then he called up the junior general, Chunyu Dan, and said, “You will take the fourth camp on the south side; you may have five thousand troops. The commander of the post is Fu Tong. I shall support you.” When Chunyu Dan had gone, Lu Xun summoned Xu Sheng and Ding Feng and said, “Each of you will take three thousand troops and bivouac two miles from the camp, so that if your colleague is repulsed and pursued, you can rescue him.”"

The two formations were facing each other, Feng Li was immediately under the banner of the gate, and he scolded with his sword: ""Back to the country and rebel, An dare to talk nonsense!"" Meng Da said: ""Your death is imminent, and you are still obsessed with yourself!"" Feng was furious. , slapped the horse wheel knife, and went straight to Mengda. When the battle failed, he was defeated and left. Feng Chengxu chased and killed for more than twenty li. Xiahou Shang attacked on the left, Xu Huang attacked on the right, and Meng Da returned to fight: the three armies attacked. Liu Feng was defeated and left. He ran back to Shangyong overnight, and Wei soldiers came behind him. Liu Feng called for the gate under the city, and the arrows shot down from the city. Shen Dan shouted from the enemy's tower, ""I have surrendered to Wei!"" Feng was furious and wanted to attack the city, but the army behind him was approaching. Feng Li's feet were not strong, so he had to look at Fangling and ran, seeing that all Wei flags had been planted on the city. Shen Yi flew the flag on the enemy building, and a troop of soldiers came out from the back of the city. Feng was unable to resist the enemy, so he eagerly looked at Xichuan and left. Akira chased after him. Liu Feng's subordinates only had more than a hundred cavalry left, and when they arrived in Chengdu, they met the King of Hanzhong, cried and worshipped the ground, and recited their forewords. Xuande said angrily, ""What is the face of humiliating your son to come to see me again!"" Feng said: ""Uncle's trouble is not because he can't save him, because Meng Da remonstrated him."" Xuande turned his anger and said, ""You must eat people. Eat, wear human clothes, not earth puppets! Anke listens to the slanderers!"" Life pushed out and cut him.

Later, when he heard that Meng Da recruited him, he destroyed the book and beheaded the envoy, and he felt regretful in his heart;","The next day they meet in single combat, and after a few bouts Meng Da turns and flees, closely followed by the furious Liu Feng. But this is a trap, and soon Liu Feng is attacked from left and right in an ambush. He just manages to escape and flees to Shangyong, only to find that the city has fallen to the Wei troops as the governor has surrendered. With the enemy closing in behind him, Liu Feng flees next to Fangling, only to see the flags of Wei fluttering on the battlements, for this city too has fallen. With barely a hundred men, Liu Feng flees until eventually he staggers back into Chengdu, where he falls on the ground before Xuande, king of Hanzhong as he now is, and begs forgiveness.","Liu Feng rode to the front, pointed with his sword at his opponent and railed against him. “Death is very near you,” replied Meng Da, “yet you continue blindly in the way of foolishness and will not understand.” Liu Feng rode out flourishing his sword. He engaged Meng Da, who ran away before the conflict had well begun. Liu Feng pursued hotly to seven miles. Then he fell into an ambush and found himself attacked on two sides by Xiahou Shang and Xu Huang. Also Meng Da returned to the attack. Liu Feng was forced to fly. He made straight for Shangyong, pursued all the way. When he reached the city and hailed the gate, he was met by a volley of arrows. “I have surrendered to Wei,” cried Shen Dan from the city tower. It was impossible to attack the city, as the army of Wei was close behind, and having no resting place, he set off for Fangling. He arrived there to find the banners of Wei set out along the walls. Then he saw Shen Yi wave a signal from the tower, and at once there appeared from the shelter of the wall a body of soldiers led by Xu Huang. Then Liu Feng made for home. But he was pursued, and only a hundred riders of his remained to him when he regained Chengdu. Seeking an interview with his father, he found but scant sympathy, for in response to his petition, made prostrate, and weeping, Liu Bei said, “Shameful son! How are you come to see me at all?” “My uncle's mishap was not due to my refusal of help, but because Meng Da thwarted me.” “You eat as a man, you dress as a man; but you have no more the instincts of a man than an image of clay or wood. What mean you by saying another wretch thwarted you?” Liu Bei bade the executioners expel Liu Feng and put him to death. But the Prince felt some compunction later when he heard of Liu Feng's treatment to the messenger who had brought Meng Da's letter inviting him to become a traitor."
龐統退歸館舍，門吏忽報：“有客特來相訪。”統出迎接，見其人身長八尺，形貌甚偉；頭髮截短，披於頸上；衣服不甚齊整。統問曰：“先生何人也？”其人不答，逕登堂仰臥牀上。統甚疑之，再三請問。其人曰：“且消停，吾當與汝說知天下大事。”統聞之愈疑，命左右進酒食。其人起而便食，並無謙遜；飲食甚多，食罷又睡。統疑惑不定，使人請法正視之，恐是細作。法正慌忙到來。統出迎接，謂正曰：“有一人如此如此。”法正曰：“莫非彭永言乎？”陞階視之。其人躍起曰：“孝直別來無恙！”正是：,"When Pang Tong returned to the hall, the doorman suddenly reported: ""A guest is here to visit."" Tong went out to greet him, and saw that he was eight feet long and had a very majestic appearance; his hair was cut short and draped around his neck; his clothes were not well-groomed. Tong asked, ""Who are you, sir?"" The man didn't answer, and went up to the hall and lay on the bed. If you are in doubt, ask again. The man said, ""Come on, let me tell you that I know the world's major events."" Hearing this, he became more and more suspicious, and ordered him to drink and eat. He gets up and eats without any humility; he eats a lot, and then sleeps after eating. All doubts are uncertain, and it may be meticulous to ask people to ask the Fa to face them squarely. Fazheng arrives in a hurry. Tong went out to greet him, and said to Zheng: ""There is one person who is like this."" Fa Zheng said: ""Isn't it Peng Yongyan?"" The person jumped up and said, ""Farewell to Xiaozhi!"" It was exactly:","That night Pang Tong returns to his quarters only to be told that a stranger has come and is waiting for him in his rooms. What he finds is a tall, shabbily dressed man with badly cut hair. ‘ And who might you be, sir?’ asks Pang Tong. But he gets no answer. Instead the man simply lies down on Pang Tong’s bed! Again Pang Tong asks, ‘Who are you?’ to which the man says, ‘Just wait a minute and then I’ll tell you what fate is about to befall the world.’ Stunned by this, Pang Tong meekly orders wine and food and the man wolfs it down. Then he falls asleep! Now considerably annoyed, to put it mildly, Pang Tong asks for Fa Zheng to come and advise him. ‘Could this possibly be Peng Yang?’ asks Fa Zheng, and he goes to have a look. The stranger leaps up and says, ‘Fa Zheng! I hope you are well?’ So who exactly is this stranger?","After the council, when Pang Tong returned to his lodging, the doorkeeper told him that a visitor had arrived. When Pang Tong went out to receive him, he saw a huge tall fellow eight cubits in stature and of noble countenance. His hair had been cut short and hung upon his neck. He was poorly dressed. “Who may you be, Master?” asked Pang Tong. The visitor made no reply, but went at once straight up the room and lay upon the couch. Pang Tong felt very suspicious of the man and repeated his question. Pressed again, the visitor said, “Do let me rest a little; then I will talk with you about everything in the world.” This answer only added to the mystery and increased the host's suspicion, but he had wine and food brought in, of which the guest partook ravenously. Having eaten, he lay down and fell asleep. Pang Tong wag greatly puzzled and thought the man must be a spy. He sent for Fa Zheng, met him in the courtyard, and told him about the strange visitor. “Surely it can be no other than Peng Yang,” said Fa Zheng. Fa Zheng went inside and looked. Immediately the visitor jumped up, saying, “I hope you have been well since we parted last!” Because two old friends meet again,"

""Yi said: ""This must be Kongming's plan again."" The two said: ""If the governor is so doubtful, when will the bandits be destroyed? My two brothers should fight to the death to repay the country's kindness."" Yi said, ""He In this way, the two of you can fight separately."" He then ordered Xiahou Hui and Xiahou He to lead 5,000 soldiers each to the end. Yi sits and waits for an answer.","Meanwhile, Sima Yi’s son Sima Shi is chafing at the bit to have a go, but his father quotes the holy sage: ‘Getting upset about minor issues ruins the greater plan.’ But reports keep coming in of the Shu troops digging in and settling down which greatly alarm the Wei commanders.","Xiahou Hui and Xiahou He went to their chief, Sima Yi, and said, “The enemy have set out camps and are engaged in field work as though they intended to remain. If they are not destroyed now, but are allowed to consolidate their position, they will be hard to dislodge.” “This certainly is one of Zhuge Liang's ruses,” said the chief. “You seem very afraid of him, General,” retorted they. “When do you think you can destroy him? At least let us two brothers fight one battle that we may prove our gratitude for the Emperor's kindness.” “If it must be so, then you may go in two divisions,” said Sima Yi."

Seeing that Zhang Fei's head was in the box, his face did not change, and he burst into tears. Zhang Bao wielded a sharp sword, and cut off Fan Jiang and Zhang Dawan to Ling Chi, offering sacrifice to the spirit of his father.","He sends them, along with the head of Zhang Fei itself, with his ambassador, Cheng Bing, to the camp of the first ruler. Cheng Bing also brings a proposal that Sun Quan should return the first ruler’s wife, Lady Sun, and hand over Jingzhou as a sign of friendship. The first ruler is profoundly moved by sight of the head of his old friend and brother and orders an altar be built. Here, Zhang Bao slices apart the two murderers as a sacrifice to his father’s spirit.","All these were sent, with letters, by the band of Cheng Bing to the camp at Xiaoting. The First Ruler was about to march farther east when they told him that a messenger had come from the South Land and what he had brought. The Ruler struck his forehead with both hands, saying, “This is the direct gift of Heaven through my youngest brother's spirit.” He bade Zhang Bao prepare an altar whereon to sacrifice the heads of his father's assassins. When he opened the box and saw the fresh features of Zhang Fei, he broke into wailing for the dead. Then the son hewed Fan Jiang and Zhang Da in pieces and offered them upon the altar."

却說冷苞見當夜風雨大作，引了五千軍，逕循江邊而進，安排決江，只聽得後面喊聲亂起。冷苞知有準備，急急回軍。後面魏延引軍趕來，川兵自相踐踏。冷苞正奔走間，撞着魏延。交馬不數合，被魏延活捉去了。比及吳蘭、雷銅來接應時，又被黃忠一軍殺退。魏延解冷苞到涪關。玄德責之曰：“吾以仁義相待，放汝回去，何敢背我！今次難饒！”將冷苞推出斬之，重賞魏延。玄德設宴管待彭羕。忽報荊州諸葛亮軍師，特遣馬良奉書至此。玄德召入問之。馬良禮畢曰：“荊州平安，不勞主公憂念。”遂呈上軍師書信。玄德拆書觀之，略云：,"However, Leng Bao saw that the storm was raging that night, and he attracted 5,000 troops. Leng Bao knew that he was ready and hurried back to the army. Later Wei Yan led the army to come, and the Sichuan soldiers trampled on each other. Leng Bao was running and bumped into Wei Yan. There were not many matches, and Wei Yan was captured alive. When Bieji Wu Lan and Lei Tong came to respond, they were defeated by Huang Zhong's army. Wei Yan solved the cold bud and went to Fuguan. Xuande reprimanded him and said, ""I will treat each other with kindness and righteousness, let you go back, how dare you carry me back! This time it will be hard to forgive me!"" He pushed Leng Bao out and beheaded him and rewarded Wei Yan. Xuande held a banquet for Peng Yi. He suddenly reported to Zhuge Liang's military advisor in Jingzhou, and sent Ma Liang to write to him here. Xuande called in to ask him. Ma Liang said at the end of the ceremony: ""Jingzhou is safe, don't worry about your lord."" Then he sent a letter from the military advisor. Xuande opened the book and looked at it, and said a little:","Patrols are sent out along the river, led by Wei Yan and Huang Zhong. Late that night, in the midst of a dramatic storm, Ling Bao and his troops head out along the river to cut the channel. They almost immediately run into Xuande’s troops. Confused and thwarted, they decide to retreat. But it’s too late. They are attacked, and in the battle Wei Yan captures Ling Bao and his men are put to the sword. Ling Bao is brought to Xuande.","One very stormy night, Ling Bao ventured out with a strong reconnoitering party and went along the river bank to seek a suitable place for the breach. But a sudden shouting in his rear told him that the army of Jingzhou were on the alert, and he at once retired. Wei Yan came in pursuit and, as he pressed nearer, Ling Bao's troops hurried forward, trampling each other down in their haste. Suddenly Ling Bao and Wei Yan ran against each other, and they engaged. The fight was very short, for Wei Yan soon took his opponent prisoner. Wu Lan and Lei Tong who came to Ling Bao's rescue were easily beaten off, and Ling Bao was carried away. When Wei Yan reached the Pass, Liu Bei saw Ling Bao and greatly blamed him for his base ingratitude. “I treated you generously and set you free; you repaid me with ingratitude. I cannot forgive again.” So the prisoner was beheaded, and his captor was rewarded. A banquet was given in honor of Peng Yang. Soon after this came a letter from Zhuge Liang, by the hand of Ma Liang, who reported all calm in Jingzhou and told Liu Bei that he need feel no anxiety. Opening the letter, Liu Bei read: “I have been making some astrological calculations."
往者，羊祜不博謀於朝臣，而密與陛下計，故令朝臣多異同之議。凡事當以利害相校。度此舉之利，十有八九，而其害止於無功耳。自秋以來，討賊之形頗露；今若中止，孫皓恐怖，徙都武昌，完修江南諸城，遷其民居，城不可攻，野無所掠：則明年之計亦無及矣。,"In the past, Yang Hu did not conspire with the courtiers, but secretly planned with His Majesty, so the courtiers had many similarities and differences. Everything should be based on interests. There are nine out of ten benefits of this move, but its harm ends in the ears of ineffectiveness. Since the autumn, the form of chasing thieves has been quite exposed; now if it stops, Sun Hao will be terrified, and he will move to Wuchang, complete the construction of the cities in the south of the Yangtze River, and move their dwellings.","Immediately he sends commanders and troops in many directions, each with a Wu city to attack – Du Yu against Jiangling; Sima Zhou against Tuzhong; Wang Hun against Hengjiang; Wang Rong against Wuchang; Hu Fen against Xiakou, while the navy is sent down the river to attack as well under the command of Admiral Wang Jun.","“Formerly Yang Hu explained his plans confidentially to Your Majesty, but did not lay them before the court. The result has been much debate and conflict of opinion. In every project there are pros and cons, but in this the arguments are mostly in favor. The worst that can happen is failure. Since last autumn the proposed attack has become generally known, and, if we stop now, Sun Hao will be frightened and remove the capital to Wuchang, repair his fortifications in the South Land and move his threatened people out of danger. Then the capital cannot be assaulted, nor is there anything left in the countryside to rob. Hence next year's attack will also fail.”"

Suddenly Cao Cao sent Xue Ti to send a wooden box with a Cao seal on it, and the book said: ""When thieves come, they will be sent."" It was the daily newspaper that Sun Quan brought in an army of 100,000 to attack Hefei. Zhang Liao opened the box to observe it. The inner book said: ""If Sun Quan arrives, the two generals Zhang and Li will fight, and General Le will defend the city."" General Zhang Liao will teach Li Dian and Le Jin to watch. Le Jin said: ""What is the general's intention?"" Zhang Liao said: ""My lord is on an expedition, and Wu soldiers thought that I would be defeated. Now we can send troops to meet me, fight hard, break their sharp edges, so as to reassure the hearts of the people, and then we can defend. ."" Li Diansu and Zhang Liao were at odds, so hearing Liao's remarks, he silently did not answer. When Le Jin saw that Li Dian was silent, he said, ""There are so many thieves and I am few, and it is difficult to meet the enemy, so it is better to stick to it."" Zhang Liao said: ""The public and the others are all selfish and don't care about public affairs. I will go out to meet the enemy and fight to the death."" Prepare horses left and right. Li Dian suddenly got up and said: ""General is like this, how can Dian dare to forget about public affairs because of personal regrets? I would like to listen to the command."" Zhang Liao was overjoyed and said: ""Jian Mancheng is willing to help each other, and will lead an army to ambush in the north of Xiaoyao Jin; If you kill him, you can first cut off the Xiaoshi Bridge, and Le Wenqian and I will attack it."" Li Dian took the order and went to ambush his army.","A message from Cao Cao seems to suggest both. In the end, led by Zhang Liao’s decision, they agree on an attack. A key to this is that they should destroy the Xiaoshi bridge. The initial attack by Sun Quan’s men is successful, but then, before he knows quite what is happening, Sun Quan is being attacked by Zhang Liao.","Because of the loss of Huancheng, Zhang Liao grieved greatly. Cao Cao had sent by the hands of Xue Ti a small casket sealed with his own seal and bearing outside the words, “If rebels come, open this.” So when he received the news of the coming of a powerful army, Zhang Liao opened the casket and read the letter therein, which said, “If Sun Quan comes to attack Hefei, the two Generals Li Dian and Zhang Liao are to go out to oppose him, and Yue Jin is to be left to guard the walls.” Zhang Liao sent the letter to the two men named therein. “What do you think to do?” said Yue Jin. Zhang Liao replied, “Our lord is away, and Wu is coming to attack for certain. We must go out to repel them and exert ourselves to the utmost to inflict defeat upon their advanced guard. Thus we shall appease the fears of the populace, and then we can hold as best we may.” But Li Dian was silent, for he was ever unfriendly to Zhang Liao. Then seeing his colleague inclined to hold off, Yue Jin said, “I am for remaining on the defensive since the enemy is so much more numerous than we.” “Gentlemen, it seems you are selfish and not devoted to the common weal,” said Zhang Liao. “You may have your private reasons for what you do, but I intend to go out and try to repel the enemy. I will fight them to the death.” Thereupon Zhang Liao bade his servants saddle his steed. At this, Li Dian's better feelings were aroused, and he rose, saying, “How can I be careless of the common weal and indulge my private feelings? I am ready to follow you and do as you command.” Zhang Liao was elated at this moral victory, and said, “Since I can depend upon your help, my friend, then I would ask you to lie in ambush on the north of the Flageolet Ford in order to destroy the bridge there as soon as the army of Wu has crossed. I, with my friend Yue Jin, will smite the enemy.” Li Dian went away to muster his troops and prepare the ambush."

Every day the soldiers were ordered to fight, but the Wei army did not go out to meet him. Kong Ming took his own car to the front of Qishan Mountain and the Weishui River to see the geography. When I reached the mouth of a valley, I saw that it was shaped like a gourd, and it could accommodate more than a thousand people; the two mountains were combined into one valley, which could accommodate four or five hundred people; the two mountains behind it were surrounded, and only one person and one rider could pass. Kong Ming was overjoyed when he saw it, and he asked the commander, ""What is the name of this place?"" He replied, ""It is called Fangfang Valley, also known as Gourd Valley."" Kong Ming returned to the tent and summoned the generals Du Rui and Hu Zhonger. People, with ears to teach secrets. He ordered Huoji to join the army craftsmen as more than 1,000 people into the gourd valley to make ""wooden cattle"" and ""flowing horses"" for use; and ordered Ma Dai to lead 500 soldiers to guard the mouth of the valley. Kong Ming instructed Ma Dai: ""The craftsmen are not allowed to let them out; outsiders are not allowed to put them in. I also come to watch from time to time. The only way to catch Sima Yi is to do this. You must not leak the news."" Ma Dai was ordered to leave. .

Next he considered new plans for capturing the south bank. Every day be sent a party to offer a challenge before the camps of the enemy, but no one accepted. One day Zhuge Liang rode in his small chariot to the front of the Qishan Mountains, keenly scanned the course of River Wei and carefully surveyed the lie of the land. Presently he came to a valley shaped like a bottle-gourd, large enough to form a hiding place for a whole thousand soldiers in the inner recess, while half as many more could hide in the outer. In rear the mountains were so close that they left passage only for a single horseman. The discovery pleased the general mightily, and he asked the guides what the place was called. They replied, “It is called Shangfang Valley, and nicknamed Gourd Valley.” Returning to his camp, he called up two leaders named Du Rui and Hu Zhong and whispered into their ears certain secret orders. Next he called up a thousand craftspeople and sent them into the Gourd Valley to construct “wooden oxen and running horses” for the use of the troops. Finally he set Ma Dai with five hundred troops to guard the mouth of the Gourd Valley and prevent all entrance and exit. Zhuge Liang said, “People from outside cannot enter, from inside cannot exit. I will visit the valley at irregular intervals to inspect the work. A plan for the defeat of Sima Yi is being prepared here and must be kept a profound secret.” Ma Dai left to take up the position. The two generals, Du Rui and Hu Zhong, were superintendents of the work in the Gourd Valley. Zhuge Liang came every day to give instructions."
於是吳王留住鄧芝，集多官問曰：“孤掌江南八十一州，更有荊、楚之地，反不如西蜀偏僻之處也：蜀有鄧芝，不辱其主；吳並無一人入蜀，以達孤意。”忽一人出班奏曰：“臣願為使。”衆視之，乃吳郡吳人：姓張，名温，字惠恕，見為中郎將。權曰：“恐卿到蜀見諸葛亮，不能達孤之情。”温曰：“孔明亦人耳，臣何畏彼哉？”權大喜，重賞張温，使同鄧芝入川通好。,"So the King of Wu kept Deng Zhi, and gathered many officials to ask: ""I alone control the eighty-one states in the south of the Yangtze River, and there are even more places in Jing and Chu, but it is not as remote as Xishu: Deng Zhi is in Shu, and he will not disgrace his master; No one from Wu entered Shu, so as to achieve his loneliness."" Suddenly one of them left the class and said, ""This minister is willing to serve as an envoy."" Everyone looked at him, but he was a native of Wu in Wu County: his surname was Zhang, his name was Wen, his word was Huishu, and he was in the middle. Lang will. Quan said, ""I'm afraid that when you come to Shu to see Zhuge Liang, you won't be able to reach the solitary feelings."" Wen said, ""Kong Ming is also a human ear, so why should the minister be afraid of him?""",Kong Ming agrees with the second ruler that if Deng Zhi returns with an envoy from Wu then they will forge an alliance against Wei.,"Deng Zhi was detained, and a conclave of officers gathered. Said Sun Quan to the assembly, “Under my hand are all eighty-one counties of the southeast, and I have the lands of Jingzhou to boot, yet I am not so well off as that little country of Shu, for Shu has Deng Zhi for an envoy, and he glorifies his lord. I have no one to send to declare my wishes to Shu.” Then one stepped forth and said he would go. The speaker was Zhang Wen of Wucheng, who held the office of Imperial Commander. “Sir, I fear that when you reach Shu and are in the presence of Zhuge Liang, you will not explain my real sentiments,” said Sun Quan. Zhang Wen replied, “Think you that I shall fear him? He also is but a man.”"

且說姜維至成都，入見後主，問召回之故。後主曰：“朕為卿在邊庭，久不還師，恐勞軍士，故詔卿回朝，別無他意。”維曰：“臣已得祁山之寨，正欲收功，不期半途而廢。此必中鄧艾反間之計矣。”後主默然不語。姜維又奏曰：“臣誓討賊，以報國恩。陛下休聽小人之言，致生疑慮。”後主良久乃曰：“朕不疑卿；卿且回漢中，俟魏國有變，再伐之可也。”姜維歎息出朝，自投漢中去訖。,"Let’s say that Jiang Wei went to Chengdu, and after seeing the Lord, asked why he was recalled. The later master said: ""I am in the side court for the minister, and I will not return to the division for a long time, because I am afraid that the sergeant will be overwhelmed, so I ordered the minister to return to the court, and I have no other intentions."" Give up halfway. This must be in Deng Ai's countermeasures."" The queen was silent. Jiang Wei also said: ""I swear to punish the thieves in order to repay the kindness of the country. Your Majesty will not listen to the words of the villain, which will cause doubts."" It’s okay to cut it again.” Jiang Wei sighed and left the court, and went to Hanzhong to end.","As soon as Jiang Wei arrives in Chengdu he goes and confronts the second ruler about why he has been recalled. ‘We were worried that you might be worn out by such activities,’ says the second ruler lamely, to which Jiang Wei retorts, ‘I had victory within my grasp! I think the only reason was that someone has been spreading rumours and that Deng Ai lies behind this.’ The second ruler really has nothing to say in reply, so shortly afterwards Jiang Wei returns to Hanzhong, ready for yet another attack on Wei.","On his return to Chengdu, Jiang Wei had audience with the Latter Ruler, whereat he inquired why he had been commanded to return. The Latter Ruler replied, “Because you have been so long on the frontier, noble Sir; I thought the soldiers must be weary. There was no other reason.” “Your Majesty, thy servant had got his camps on Qishan and was on the eve of complete success. To leave off thus in the middle just played into the hands of our enemies. Surely Deng Ai found means of sowing distrust in me.” The Latter Ruler sat lost in thought, and silent. Jiang Wei continued, “I am pledged to destroy those rebels and prove my devotion to my country. Your Majesty should not listen to the babble of mean persons till distrust grows in your heart.” “I do not distrust you,” said the Latter Ruler after a long pause. “You may return into Hanzhong and await the next favorable opportunity.” Jiang Wei left the court and betook himself into Hanzhong to the army."
却說司馬懿在渭北寨內傳令曰：“渭南寨柵，今已失了。諸將如再言出戰者斬。”衆將聽令，據守不出。郭淮入告曰：“近日孔明引兵巡哨，必將擇地安營。”懿曰：“孔明若出武功，依山而東，我等皆危矣；若出渭南，西止五丈原，方無事也。”令人探之，回報果屯五丈原。司馬懿以手加額曰：“大魏皇帝之洪福也！”遂令諸將堅守勿出，彼久必自變。,"However, it was said that Sima Yi sent an order from the Weibei Village, saying: ""The Weinan Village Gate has now been lost. If the generals say again, they will kill those who go to war."" Guo Huai came in and said: ""In the near future, Kongming will lead troops to patrol the post, and he will definitely choose a place to camp."" Yi said: ""If Kongming goes out of martial arts, if he goes to the east by the mountains, all of us will be in danger; if he goes out of Weinan and stops at Wuzhangyuan in the west, there will be nothing to do. Also."" It was intrigued and reported to Guotun Wuzhangyuan. Sima Yi raised his forehead with his hand and said, ""The great blessing of the Great Wei Emperor!"" So he ordered the generals to stick to it, and he would change himself after a long time.","he says. ‘There is no way to make things go against that.’ Desperate to make the Wei troops come out to fight again, Kong Ming even sends a woman’s headdress and a shroud to mock and insult Sima Yi, but this doesn’t draw him out.","From the new camp on the north bank of the river, Sima Yi issued an order that he would put to death any officer who proposed going out to battle. The final result of the late ill-advised expedition had been the loss of the south bank of the river. Accordingly no one spoke of attacking, but all turned their energies toward defense. Guo Huai went to the general to talk over plans. He said, “The enemy have been carefully spying out the country and are certainly selecting a new position for a camp.” Sima Yi said, “If Zhuge Liang goes out to Wugong Hills, and thence eastward, we shall be in grave danger; if he goes southwest by River Wei, and halts on the Wuzhang Hills, we need feel no anxiety.” They decided to send scouts to find out the movements of their enemy. Presently the scouts returned to say that Zhuge Liang had chosen the Wuzhang Hills. “Our great Emperor of Wei has remarkable fortune,” said Sima Yi, clapping his hand to his forehead. Then he confirmed the order to remain strictly on the defensive till some change of circumstances on the part of the enemy should promise advantage."
孔明令押過董荼那、阿會喃至帳下，盡去其縛，以酒食衣服賜之；令各自歸洞，勿得助惡。二人泣拜，各投小路而去。孔明謂諸將曰：“來日孟獲必然親自引兵廝殺，便可就此擒之。”乃喚趙雲、魏延至，付與計策，各引五千兵去了。又喚王平、關索同引一軍，授計而去。孔明分撥已畢，坐於帳上待之。,"Kong Ming ordered Dong Duna and Ahuinan to be taken to the tent, to remove their bondage, and to give them food, wine, and clothes; they each returned to their caves, and did not help evil. The two of them wept and worshipped, and each cast a path away. Kong Ming said to the generals: ""In the future, Meng Huo will definitely lead his troops to fight, so he can be captured here."" He also called Wang Ping and Guan Suo to lead the same army, and left with a plan. Kong Ming had finished allocating and sat on the tent waiting for him.","The two men are brought before Kong Ming and to their immense relief they are released. But Kong Ming then says, ‘Beware. Tomorrow Meng Huo will personally lead the attack and that is when we will capture him.’ And having assigned his men to different tasks, he sets in motion the plan to capture the king. Sure enough, Meng Huo, hearing of the disaster of the three chieftains’ revolt, decides to move to the attack himself and before long he is facing Wang Ping on the battlefield.","As soon as they appeared, Zhuge Liang loosed their bonds, gave them refreshments and released them, bidding them offend no more. They thanked him for their liberty, and disappeared along a by-road. Then Zhuge Liang said to his generals, “Tomorrow Meng Huo will come in person to make an attack. We shall probably capture him again.” Then he summoned Zhao Yun and Wei Yan and gave them orders. They left, each with five thousand troops. Next he sent Wang Ping. And then he sat in his tent to wait for the result."
却說孟獲在帳中專望回音，忽報有二人回了；喚入問之，具說：“諸葛亮受了禮物大喜，將隨行之人，皆喚入帳中，殺牛宰馬，設宴相待。二大王令某密報大王：今夜二更，裏應外合，以成大事。”,"However, Meng Huo said that Meng Huo was in the tent looking for an answer, and suddenly reported that two people had returned; when he called in to ask him, he said, ""Zhuge Liang was overjoyed by the gift, and he called all the people who were with him into the tent to kill the ox and the horse. Set a banquet to treat each other. The two kings ordered a certain secret report to the king: Tonight’s second watch, the inside and the outside should be combined to achieve a major event.”","Meng You but also his men, plying them with drink. Knowing that as far as he is concerned Kong Ming has fallen for the plot, Men You sends two of his men back to Meng Huo’s camp to say all is falling into place as planned.","Meng Huo was anxious about the reception that would be given to his brother and the treatment of his gifts, so he sat in his tent expecting the messenger at any moment. Then two men came, and he questioned them eagerly. They said, “The presents have been accepted, and even the porters have been invited to drink in the tent and have been regaled with beef and flesh in plenty. O King, your brother sends the news that all will be ready at the second watch for the attack. He will support you from within.”"
於是姜維引兵五萬，望枹罕進發。兵至洮水，守邊軍士報知雍州刺史王經、副將軍陳泰。王經先起馬步兵七萬來迎。姜維分付張翼如此如此，又分付夏侯霸如此如此：二人領計去了，維乃自引大軍背洮水列陣。王經引數員牙將出而問曰：“魏與吳、蜀，已成鼎足之勢。汝累次入寇，何也？”維曰：“司馬師無故廢主，鄰邦理宜問罪，何況讎敵之國乎？”,"So Jiang Wei led 50,000 troops to look forward to Fanghan. When the soldiers arrived at Taoshui, the sergeant guarding the frontier reported to the governor of Yongzhou, Wang Jing, and deputy general Chen Tai. Wang Jingxian raised 70,000 infantrymen to welcome him. Jiang Wei paid Zhang Yi like this, and Xiahou Ba like this: the two led the plan, and Wei Nai led the army behind Taoshui to form an array. Wang Jing's quoting staff were about to come out and asked, ""Wei, Wu, and Shu have become a cauldron. Why did you join the bandits so many times?"" Wei said, ""Sima Shi abolished the master for no reason, and it is appropriate for the neighbors to ask for the crime, not to mention Yu. The country of the enemy?""","Thinking that they have the Shu army trapped – who are backed up against the River Tao – they attack, only to be roundly defeated by Jiang Wei, who, inspired by this, presses on to attack Didao.","So Jiang Wei led an army of fifty thousand troops out by Baohan. When he reached River Yao, the spies reported his arrival to Wang Jing, Imperial Protector of Yongzhou, who led out seventy thousand troops against him. Jiang Wei gave certain orders to Zhang Yi and Xiahou Ba, and after they had marched, he drew up the main body by River Yao. Wang Jing rode out to parley. “Wu, Shu, and Wei are now actually established as a tripod; why then have you invaded our borders these many times?” Jiang Wei replied, “Because Sima Shi deposed hid prince without cause, and it behooves the neighboring countries to punish such a crime. Moreover, your country is a rival state.”"
不一日，孫權領衆至。呂蒙出郭迎接入衙。權慰勞畢，仍命潘濬為治中，掌荊州事；監內放出于禁，遣歸曹操，安民賞軍，設宴慶賀。權謂呂蒙曰：“今荊州已得，但公安傅士仁，南郡糜芳，此二處如何收復？”言未畢，忽一人出曰：“不須張弓隻箭，某憑三寸不爛之舌，說公安傅士仁來降，可乎？”衆視之，乃虞翻也。權曰：“仲翔有何良策，可使傅士仁歸降？”翻曰：“某自幼與士仁交厚；今若以利害說之，彼必歸矣。”權大喜，遂令虞翻領五百軍，逕奔公安來。,"Not a day later, Sun Quan led the crowd. Lü Meng went out of Guo to meet him. After Quan's condolences, he still ordered Pan Jun to be in the governance and in charge of Jingzhou affairs; he was released from prison and sent to Cao Cao, so that the people would be rewarded with the army, and a banquet was held to celebrate. Quan asked Lü Meng, ""Now Jingzhou has been captured, but the police, Fu Shiren, and Nanjun Mifang, how can these two places be recovered?"" You said that the public security officer Fu Shiren is here to surrender, is that right?"" Everyone looked at him, but Yu Fan also. Quan said, ""What good strategy does Zhongxiang have to make Fu Shiren return?"" He said, ""A certain friend has been close to Shiren since childhood; if he talks about it in terms of benefits and harms, he will surely return."" Quan was overjoyed and ordered Yu to lead five Hundreds of troops, go straight to the police.","Almost immediately after the city’s capture, Sun Quan arrives with his vast army. With the Jingzhou region now in their control, they turn their thoughts to how to consolidate these triumphs and take Gong’an and Nanjun. Gong’an is controlled by Fu Shiren, and Nanjun by Mi Fang. It is Yu Fan who offers the way forward, pointing out that neither man is enamoured of Guan Yu after their dramatic dressing down and punishment by him. Offer them escape from the control of Guan Yu and they might well jump at the opportunity. When Fu Shiren receives the proposal that he surrender – by an arrow fired over his city walls – he thinks back to when he was disgraced by Guan Yu.","When Sun Quan visited the city, Lu Meng met him at the boundary and led him to the official residence, where Sun Quan issued rewards and commendations. This done, Sun Quan ordered Pan Jun to take charge of the new possession. Yu Jin, who was in prison, was freed and sent back to Cao Cao. When the people had been comforted and the soldiers rewarded, there was a great banquet in honor of the success of the expedition. Then said Sun Quan to Lu Meng, “We have got the city of Jingzhou, but now Fu Shiren is holding Gongan and Mi Fang Nanjun. How can we get these two territories?” Suddenly Yu Fan started up and offered his services. “You will need neither bows nor arrows,” said Yu Fan, “unless my little tongue is worn out. I can persuade Fu Shiren to surrender.” “Friend Yu Fan, how will you do it?” asked Sun Quan. “Fu Shiren and I are very old friends, ever since we were boys; and if I explain the matter to him, I am sure he will come over to this side.” So Yu Fan, with an escort, left quickly for Gongan, where his friend was in command."

Now that the lord has captured Hanzhong, Yizhou is shaken. If you can attack it quickly, it will be disintegrated. Knowing is more valuable than taking time. The time must not be lost."" Cao Cao sighed and said, ""'People are suffering and not satisfied, but when they get to Long, they look back to Shu'?"" Liu Ye said, ""Sima Zhongda's words are true: if you are less slow, Zhuge will be better at governing the country. For the prime minister, Guan, Zhang and others bravely championed the three armies and served as generals. The people of Shu are determined to guard the pass, and they cannot be violated."" Cao said: ""The soldiers are far away from toil, and they should be saved.""","When news reaches Xuande in the west of Shu, he is convinced that Cao Cao will come for him next.","When the Eastern Land of Rivers was quite subdued, First Secretary Sima Yi said, “The people of Shu are not loyal to Liu Bei because of his uprooting the late ruler, Liu Zhang; and if on the strength of your present success you press forward, Liu Bei will become as a shattered tile. The wise person takes the occasion when it serves, and this should not be missed.” Cao Cao sighed, “There is no end—as human want has no limit; now that I have Hanzhong, I am forced into taking Yiazhou.” Liu Ye supported his colleague, saying, “Sima Yi spoke well. If you delay, Zhuge Liang will have become top minister, while Guan Yu, Zhang Fei and the other bold warriors will be at the head of the army. If the people of Shu once settle down, and the points of vantage are held, you will not be able to overcome them.” Cao Cao replied, “My soldiers have marched far and suffered much; beside we must show pity.”"

却說鄧艾引兵追趕，只見前面蜀兵旗幟整齊，人馬徐徐而退。艾歎曰：“姜維深得武侯之法也！”因此不敢追趕，勒軍回祁山寨去了。,"But he said that Deng Ai led his troops to chase, and saw that the flags of the Shu soldiers in front were neat and tidy, and the men and horses retreated slowly. Ai Tan said, ""Jiang Wei has learned the law of Marquis Wu!"" So he did not dare to pursue, and the army returned to Qi Shanzhai.","Instead of a rout, he makes a tactical withdrawal, safeguarding his men with a strong rearguard force to protect them, so much so that Deng Ai, observing it, decides not to attack, and thus the Shu army make their way back safely to the land of Shu. As soon as Jiang Wei arrives in Chengdu he goes and confronts the second ruler about why he has been recalled.","The army of Wei, loth to forgo an opportunity, followed, but the absence of the least confusion gave them no chance. As he saw his enemy disappearing in perfect order, Deng Ai sighed, “Jiang Wei is a worthy inheritor of the warlike methods of Zhuge Liang.” Deng Ai did not pursue but returned to his camp on Qishan."

Zhen discussed with Wang Lang and Guo Huai the strategy of retreating. Lang said: ""In the future, you can strictly organize the team and display the flags. The old man came out of his own accord. With only one word, he would teach Zhuge Liang to surrender, and the soldiers of Shu would retreat without fighting."" , Ping Ming must be neat and tidy, the people are majestic, the flags are horned, and each is in order. At that time, people were asked to issue the gauntlet first. The next day, the two armies faced each other and formed a formation in front of Qishan. The Shu army saw that the Wei army was very majestic, which was very different from Xiahou Mao.","The advisers recommend that Cao Zhen and the elderly minister of home affairs Wang Lang should be in command of the army to defend Wei from Kong Ming. When the two armies confront each other, heralds summon both sides for a parley and Wang Lang","Cao Zhen marched by way of Changan and camped on the west bank of the River Wei. At a council, which the Commander-in-Chief called to consider the best mode of attack, Wang Lang asked that he might be allowed to parley with the enemy. “Let the army be drawn up in complete battle order and unfurl all the banners. I will go out and call a parley with Zhuge Liang, at which I will make him yield to us without a blow, and the army of Shu shall march home again.” Cao Zhen agreed that the aged counselor should try. So orders were given to take the early meal at the fourth watch and have the men fall in with their companies and files at daylight, all in review order. Everything was to be grand and imposing, the flags fluttering and the drums rolling, every man in his place. Just before this display, a messenger was to deliver a declaration of war. Next day, when the armies were drawn up facing each other in front of the Qishan Mountains, the soldiers of Shu saw that their enemies were fine, bold warriors, very different from those that Xiahou Mao had brought against them."

却說玄德見紅日平西，敎後軍先退。軍士方回身，城上一片聲喊起，南門內軍馬突出。張任逕來軍中捉玄德。玄德軍中大亂。黃忠、魏延又被吳蘭、雷銅敵住。兩下不能相顧，玄德敵不住張任，撥馬往山僻小路而走。張任從背後追來，看看趕上。玄德獨自一人一馬，張任引數騎趕來。玄德正望前儘力加鞭而行，忽山路一軍衝出。玄德馬上叫苦曰：“前有伏兵，後有追兵，天亡我也！”只見來軍當頭一員大將：乃是張飛。原來張飛與嚴顏正從那條路上來，望見塵埃起，知與川兵交戰。張飛當先而來，正撞着張任，便就交馬。戰到十餘合，背後嚴顏引兵大進。張任火速回身。張飛直趕到城下。張任退入城，拽起弔橋。,"But Xuande said that seeing the red sun flattening the west, he instructed the army to retreat first. Sergeant Fang turned around, the city shouted loudly, and the army horses protruded from the south gate. Zhang Renjing came to the army to capture Xuande. There was great chaos in Xuande's army. Huang Zhong and Wei Yan were inhabited by Wu Lan and Lei Tong. Unable to care for each other, Xuande couldn't stand against Zhang Ren, so he drove his horse to a remote mountain road. Zhang Ren chased him from behind to see if he could catch up. Xuande was alone on a horse, and Zhang Renyin came on horseback. Xuande was looking ahead and doing his best with the whip, when suddenly an army from Shanlu rushed out. Xuande immediately complained and said, ""There are soldiers in ambush in front, and soldiers behind, and I will die!"" I saw the leading general of the incoming army: it was Zhang Fei. It turned out that Zhang Fei and Yan Yan were coming from that road, and when they saw the dust rising, they knew they were fighting with the Sichuan soldiers. Zhang Fei came first and bumped into Zhang Ren, so he handed over the horse. After more than ten battles, Yan Yan led his troops to advance. Zhang Ren quickly turned around. Zhang Fei rushed to the bottom of the city. Zhang Ren retreated into the city and pulled up the suspension bridge.","The very next day they launch an assault, but Zhang Ren is able to mount a counter-attack through one of the city gates that Xuande has not attacked. The result is a complete success for Zhang Ren, and his attack takes Xuande by surprise. Zhang Ren rides straight for Xuande and crashes through his men, scattering them. Xuande turns and flees. Zhang Ren, with just a few of his men, pursues him into the hills and draws closer and closer. Just as it seems inevitable that Xuande will be captured, round the corner comes a troop – led by Zhang Fei. The two Zhangs clash. But not long after Yan Yan arrives with the bulk of the army, and, seeing this, Zhang Ren turns and flees, with Zhang Fei in hot pursuit right up to the city wall.","At sundown Liu Bei ordered the retirement of his army, and the rearmost company turned about to march back to camp. At this moment arose still louder shouting from the ramparts, and out at the south gate burst Zhang Ren and his force. Zhang Ren made straight for Liu Bei, who was in the middle of his army. Liu Bei's soldiers were thrown into confusion. As his two generals on the east side were also attacked, they could render no help, and Liu Bei fled to the hills. Zhang Ren followed and soon got very near. They were a whole company pursuing one solitary man, and as Liu Bei plied his whip he felt that the odds were much against him. Just then he saw another company of soldiers ahead, emerging from a hill path. “An ambush in front; pursuers in rear! Surely Heaven wishes to destroy me!” cried Liu Bei. But all was not lost As they drew nearer, he recognized his own troops, and the leader who dashed to meet him was his brother Zhang Fei. Zhang Fei and Yan Yan had happened to take that road, and Zhang Fei had hastened forward when he saw the dust of conflict. Zhang Fei and Zhang Ren soon came up with each other, and they fought ten bouts. By this time Yan Yan with the main body had come up, and Zhang Ren turned and fled. Zhang Fei followed and chased him as far as the city wall. The gate was opened to allow Zhang Ren to enter and at once shut. The drawbridge was raised."
却說鄧艾暗度陰平，引兵行時，又見一個大空寨。左右告曰：“聞武侯在日，曾發一千兵守此險隘。今蜀主劉禪廢之。”艾嗟呀不已，乃謂衆人曰：“吾等有來路而無歸路矣！前江油城中，糧食足備：汝等前進可活，後退卽死，須併力攻之。”衆皆應曰：“願死戰！”於是鄧艾步行，引二千餘人，星夜倍道來搶江油城。,"But he said that Deng Ai was in darkness, and when he was leading his troops, he saw another large empty village. The left and right said: ""I heard that Marquis Wu was in Japan and sent a thousand troops to guard this dangerous pass. Now Liu Shan, the master of Shu, has abolished it."" In Qianjiangyou City, there is enough food: if you advance, you can live, but if you retreat, you must attack them together."" All the people responded, ""I wish to fight to the death!"" So Deng Ai walked, leading more than 2,000 people, and the starry night came. Grab Jiangyou City.","Here Deng Ai wrapped in felt came rolling down, Astonished that Kong Ming had foreseen just that. With such an element of surprise they easily take Jiangyou.","Presently he came to a roomy camp, empty and deserted. He was told that while Zhuge Liang lived, a thousand troops had been kept in garrison at this point of danger, but the Latter Ruler had withdrawn them. Deng Ai sighed at the thought. He said to his troops, “Now retreat is impossible, there is no road back. Before you lies Jiangyou with stores in abundance. Advance and you live, retreat and you die. You must fight with all your strength.” “We will fight to the death!” they cried. The leader was now afoot, doing double marches with his two thousand troops toward Jiangyou.

When the two formations were facing each other, He Ping came out of his horse and scolded: ""The rebel Wei Yanan is there?"" Yan Yi scolded: ""You helped Yang Yi rebel, why dare you scold me!"" How dare you rebel!"" He pointed at the Sichuan soldiers and said, ""You sergeants are all from Xichuan. There are many parents, wives, brothers, relatives and friends in Sichuan. The prime minister was in Japan, and he never treated you badly. Everyone go home and wait for the reward."" When the army heard the words, they shouted, and most of them dispersed. Yan was furious, wielded his sword and rode his horse, taking He Ping straight. Welcome with a flat gun. After a few close battles, he succumbed to the defeat and left, and Yan followed. All the armies fired their bows and crossbows, and then returned their horses. Seeing that all the troops were defeated, he turned his anger into anger, beat the horses to catch up, killed several people, but could not stop them; only the three hundred men led by Ma Dai did not move. Yan said to Dai: ""The public really helps me, and after the completion of the matter, I will never bear it."" Then he and Ma Dai chased and killed He Ping. Ping led the soldiers to run away. Wei Yan gathered the remnants of the army and discussed with Ma Dai, ""What if I will join Wei?"" Dai said: ""The general's words are not wise: why don't you try to dominate your own business, but bow your knees lightly to others? I look at the general. Wisdom and courage are fully prepared, and the men of the two Sichuans, who dares to resist the enemy? I swear to take Hanzhong first with the general, and then attack Xichuan.""","Commander He Ping leads the loyal troops and, emerging behind Nangu, he challenges Wei Yan to single combat, shouting, ‘Where are you, you traitor Wei Yan?’ to which Wei Yan replies, ‘You’re the traitor, helping one like Yang Yi. Don’t you try to shout me down!’ ‘The prime minister’s body is not cold yet,’ retorts He Ping, ‘ and you have already rebelled.’ Then, turning to Wei Yan’s soldiers, he says ‘You men, when did the prime minister ever do you harm? Why are you helping the traitor? Go home, and we’ll reward you.’ A huge cheer goes up, and many of the men set off home straight away. Infuriated by all this, Wei Yan attacks, and He Ping charges forward as well. They fight many rounds, until He Ping pretends to retreat. Wei Yan tries to follow him, but arrows drive him back. Watching his army literally fall apart, he chases some, slaying them as they run. The only troops to stand firm are the three hundred men around Ma Dai. But when Wei Yan suggests that they desert and join the Wei army, it is Ma Dai who says, ‘Better that we as men of honour carve out our own lands than surrender to another. You’re the best soldier in the whole land. I swear to follow you and suggest we take Hanzhong, from where we can attack the West of Shu.’","When He Ping had got to the rear of Nangu Valley, they announced their presence with rolling drums. The scouts quickly told Wei Yan, who at once armed himself, took his sword, and rode out to confront He Ping. When both sides were arrayed, He Ping rode to the front and began to revile his opponent. “Where is that rebel Wei Yan?” cried He Ping. “You aided that traitor Yang Yi;” cried Wei Yan, no way backward with his tongue, “how dare you abuse me?” He Ping waxed more indignant. “You rebelled immediately after the late chief's death, before even his body was cold. How could you?” Then shaking his whip at the followers of Wei Yan, He Ping cried, “And you soldiers are Shu people. Your fathers and mothers, wives and children, and your friends are still in the land. Were you treated unkindly that you have joined a traitor and aid his wicked schemes? You ought to have returned home and waited quietly the rewards that would have been yours.” The soldiers were touched by his words; they cheered, and more than a half ran away. Wei Yan was now raging. He whirled up his sword and galloped forward straight for He Ping, who went to meet him with his spear ready. They fought several bouts, and then He Ping rode away as if defeated. Wei Yan followed, but He Ping's troops began to shoot and Wei Yan was driven backward. As he got near his own ranks, Wei Yan saw many generals leaving their companies and going away. He rode after them and cut some of them down. But this did not stay the movement; they continued to go. The only steady portion of his own army was that commanded by Ma Dai. They stood their ground. “Will you really help me?” said Wei Yan. “I will surely remember you in the day of success.” The two then went in pursuit of He Ping, who fled before them. However, it was soon evident that He Ping was not to be overtaken, and the pursuers halted. Wei Yan mustered his now small force. “What if we go over to Wei?” said Wei Yan. “I think your words unwise,” said Ma Dai. “Why should we join anyone? A really strong person would try to carve out his own fortune and not be ready to crook the knee to another. You are able enough and brave enough to be more than a match for any leader in the Lands of Rivers. No one would dare to stand up to you. I pledge myself to go with you to the seizure of Hanzhong, and thence we will attack the Western Land of Rivers.”"
次日，孔明令土人引路，自乘小車到桃花渡口北岸山僻去處，遍觀地理。山險嶺峻之處，車不能行，孔明棄車步行。忽到一山，望見一谷，形如長蛇，皆危峭石壁，並無樹木，中間一條大路。孔明問土人曰：“此谷何名？”土人答曰：“此處名為盤蛇谷。出谷則三江城大路。谷前名塔郎甸。”孔明大喜曰：“此乃天賜吾成功於此也！”遂回舊路，上車歸寨，喚馬岱分付曰：“與汝黑油櫃車十輛，須用竹竿千條。櫃內之物，如此如此。可將本部兵去把住盤蛇谷兩頭，依法而行。與汝半月限，一切完備。至期如此施設。倘有走漏，定按軍法。”馬岱受計而行。又喚趙雲分付曰：“汝去盤蛇谷後，三江大路口如此守把。所用之物，尅日完備。”趙雲受計而去。又喚魏延分付曰：“汝可引本部兵去桃花渡口下寨。如蠻兵渡水來敵，汝便棄了寨，望白旗處而走。限半個月內，須要連輸十五陣，棄七個寨柵。若輸十四陣，也休來見我。”魏延領命，心中不樂，怏怏而去。孔明又喚張翼另引一軍，依所指之處，築立寨柵去了。却令張嶷、馬忠引本洞所降千人，如此行之：各人都依計而行。,"The next day, Kongming ordered the natives to lead the way, and took a small car to a remote place on the north bank of the Taohua Ferry, looking at the geography. The mountains were steep and steep, and the car could not go, so Kong Ming abandoned the car and walked. Suddenly, when I reached a mountain, I saw a valley, shaped like a long snake, with dangerous cliffs, no trees, and a large road in the middle. Kong Ming asked the natives, ""What is the name of this valley?"" The natives replied: ""This place is called Coil Snake Valley. Out of the valley is the road of Sanjiang City. The name of the valley is Talangdian."" This is also here!"" Then he returned to the old road, got on the car and returned to the village, and called Ma Dai to pay him: ""You have ten black oil tankers with you, and you have to use a thousand bamboo poles. The things in the tank are like this. You can send the troops from the headquarters. Go and hold both ends of the Coil Snake Valley and follow the law. Within half a month, everything will be complete. When the time comes, it will be installed in this way. If there is any leakage, it will be according to the military law."" Ma Dai took the plan and went. He also called Zhao Yun to pay and said, ""After you go to Coil Snake Valley, you will guard the intersection of Sanjiang like this. The things you use will be complete every day."" Zhao Yun accepted the plan and left. He also called Wei Yan to pay and said: ""You can lead your troops to the Taohua Ferry to go down to the village. If the barbarian soldiers cross the water and come to the enemy, you will abandon the village and walk away looking at the white flag. Within half a month, you need to lose 15 consecutive losses. If you lose fourteen, don't come to see me."" Wei Yan took the order, feeling unhappy and left in despair. Kong Ming also called Zhang Yi to lead another army, and built a fortress according to the point. However, Zhang Yi and Ma Zhong were ordered to bring in the thousand people who had been brought down from the cave, and they did so: everyone followed their plan.","The following day Kong Ming goes and reconnoitres for himself and finds a winding valley, like a huge serpent. He is delighted and exclaims, ‘This is exactly what I hoped to find. Indeed, I believe Heaven has prepared this for us.’ Returning, he summons his officers. To Ma Dai he says, ‘You take the ten black carriages and a thousand bamboo poles. Seize each end of the valley and then do as I tell you. You have two weeks to get ready.’ And he tells Ma Dai his plan. Then Zhao Zilong is given his instructions. ‘Go and control the end of the valley that leads to Sanjiang and make sure you are ready.’ Again Kong Ming gives his orders, and Zhao Zilong departs to carry them out. The most complex instructions are given to Wei Yan. ‘ Go to the banks of Peach Blossom river. Now, when the Man soldiers attack, abandon the camp and retreat to where you will see a white flag flying. Make camp there. In two weeks I want you to “lose” fifteen battles and abandon up to seven camps. But do not come looking for me until after the fifteenth battle.’ This is not quite what Wei Yan hoped he would be called upon to do, but he accepts, even though his heart is troubled by these strange commands. Zhang Yi is told to prepare a camp with fortifications at a special place, while Zhang Ni and Ma Zhong are given a thousand of the Man soldiers who have surrendered and told of their special role in this plot.","He rode in his light chariot with a few natives as guides. He came to the ford, and from a secluded spot in the mountains on the north bank, he looked about him. The whole country was mountainous and difficult, impassable for any carriage. So he got out and went afoot. Presently, from a hill he saw a long winding valley, like a huge serpent. The sides were very precipitous and bare. However, a road ran through the middle. “What is the name of the valley?” asked Zhuge Liang. “It is called 'Coiled Serpent Valley,'“ said the guides. “At the other end you come into the high road to Three Rivers. The road goes by a valley called 'Talang See.'“ “The very thing,” cried Zhuge Liang. “Surely this is providence. I shall score a great success here.” Having seen enough, he retraced his steps, found his chariot, and returned to camp. Arrived at the camp, Ma Dai was called and put in charge of the preparations. Zhuge Liang gave him an order: “I will give you the ten black painted carts, and you are to get a thousand long bamboo poles. Open the carts, and follow my instructions there. Then you are to keep the two ends of the Coiled Serpent Valley. Half a month is the deadline, and all of these must be performed with the most perfect secrecy under military law and punishment.” Next Zhao Yun was sent to a point on the Three River road; Wei Yan to camp at the Peach Flowers Ford. Zhuge Liang told Wei Yan, “If the Mangs come over the river, you are to abandon the camp and march toward a certain white flag you will see. Further, in half a month you would have to acknowledge defeat some fifteen times and abandon seven camps. On no account are you to come to interview me even after fourteen defeats.” Wei Yan went off, not a little hipped at the prospect, but prepared to obey. Next, Zhang Yi was sent to make a stockade at a certain indicated point, and Zhang Ni and Ma Zhong was told to lead the Mang soldiers who had surrendered, and other orders were given."

言訖又哭。衆官曰：“二小將軍且退。容聖上將息龍體。”侍臣奏曰：“陛下年過六旬，不宜過於哀痛。”先主曰：“二弟俱亡，朕安忍獨生！”言訖，以頭頓地而哭。多官商議曰：“今天子如此煩惱，將何解勸？”馬良曰：“主上親統大兵伐吳，終日號泣，於軍不利。”陳震曰：“吾聞成都靑城山之西，有一隱者：姓李，名意。世人傳說此老已三百餘歲，能知人之生死吉凶，乃當世之神仙也。何不奏知天子，召此老來，問他吉凶？勝如吾等之言。”遂入奏先主。先主從之，卽遣陳震齎詔，往靑城山宣召。震星夜到了靑城，令鄕人引入山谷深處，遙望仙莊，淸雲隱隱，瑞氣非凡。忽見一小童來迎曰：“來者莫非陳孝起乎？”震大驚曰：“仙童如何知我姓字？”童子曰：“吾師昨者有言：‘今日必有皇帝詔命至；使者必是陳孝起。’”震曰：“眞神仙也！人言信不誣矣！”遂與小童同入仙莊，拜見李意，宣天子詔命。李意推老不行。震曰：“天子急欲見仙翁一面，幸勿吝鶴駕。”再三敦請，李意方行。旣至御營，入見先主。先主見李意鶴髮童顏，碧眼方瞳，灼灼有光，身如古柏之狀，知是異人，優禮相待。李意曰：“老夫乃荒山村叟，無學無識。辱陛下宣召，不知有何見諭？”先主曰：“朕與關、張二弟結生死之交，三十餘年矣。今二弟被害，親統大軍報讎，未知休咎如何。久聞仙翁通曉玄機，望乞賜敎。”李意曰：“此乃天數，非老夫所知也。”先主再三求問，意乃索紙筆畫兵馬器械四十餘張，畫畢便一一扯碎。又畫一大人仰臥於地上，傍邊一人掘土埋之，上寫一大“白”字，遂稽首而去。先主不悅，謂羣臣曰：“此狂叟也！不足為信！”卽以火焚之，便催軍前進。,"After saying that, I cried again. The officials said: ""Second little generals, retreat. Admiral Rong Sheng rests his dragon body."" The court officials said, ""Your Majesty is over sixty years old, so it is not appropriate to be too sad."" Live!"" After saying this, he cried with a head start. A number of officials discussed and said, ""Today I am so troubled, how can I persuade him?"" Ma Liang said, ""The Lord personally ordered a large army to attack Wu, and weeping all day long, which is not good for the army."" Chen Zhen said, ""I heard that the west of Jincheng Mountain in Chengdu, There is a hermit: his surname is Li, his name means. It is said in the world that this old man is more than 300 years old. He can know the good and bad luck of life and death. Wait for the words."" Then he went to play the First Sovereign. The First Sovereign obeyed, and sent Chen Zhen to edict and summoned him to Mount Jincheng. Zhen Xingye arrived in Jincheng, and led the people into the depths of the valley, looking at Xianzhuang in the distance, the clouds were faint, and the auspiciousness was extraordinary. Suddenly, a young boy came to greet him and said, ""Could it be that Chen Xiaoqi came here?"" He was shocked and said, ""How does a fairy know my surname?"" The messenger must be Chen Xiaoqi.'"" Zhen said, ""It's a real immortal! People's words and beliefs are not false!"" Then they entered the fairy village with Xiaotong, met Li Yi, and declared the emperor's order. Li Yi pushes old. Zhen said: ""The Son of Heaven is eager to see the immortal man, but fortunately do not be stingy with the crane."" When he arrived at the imperial camp, he entered to meet the First Sovereign. The first master saw that Li Yihe had a childish face, blue eyes and square pupils, shining brightly, and his body was like an ancient cypress. Li Yi said: ""This old man is an old man in a barren mountain village. He has no education or knowledge. I have insulted Your Majesty's summons. I don't know what you have to say."" He was killed, and the army of his own family reported it, but I don't know how to blame it. I have heard for a long time that Xian Weng knows the mystery, and I hope to beg for help."" Li Yi said, ""This is the number of days, not the old man's knowledge."" More than 40 pieces of military and horse equipment were drawn with paper and pen, and they were torn apart one by one after the painting. He also painted a large man lying on his back on the ground, with a man beside him digging and burying it, with a large ""white"" written on it, and he bowed his head and left. The First Sovereign was displeased and said to the ministers: ""This is a mad man! It's not enough to be believed!"" He set fire to it, and urged the army to advance.","But when the first ruler hands over the seal of authority to lead the army to Zhang Bao, Guan Xing protests mightily. ‘Give that to me!’","But they have met violent deaths, and the sight of these two youths wrings my heart to the very core.” “Young gentlemen, please retire,” said the officers to the two youthful generals, “and let our Sacred One repose his dragon body.” They went. Said the attendants, “Your Majesty is no longer young; you are over sixty, remember, and it is not fitting that you give way to such extreme sorrow.” “But my brothers—dead,” wailed the First Ruler. “How can I live without them?” He broke into a fresh paroxysm and beat his head on the ground. “What can be done?” asked the officers one to another. “He is in such trouble! How can we comfort him?” Ma Liang said, “Sire, it is bad for the army to spend whole days in wailing and tears when leading against the enemy.” And then Chen Zhen said, “There is a certain hermit living among the Blue Mountains, near Chengdu, who is said to be three hundred years old. He is called Li Yi, and people say he is a seer. Let us tell His Majesty and let him send for this old man that he may know what the future may have in store. It will have more weight than anything we can say.” They went to the First Ruler and told him; he agreed to summon the seer and sent Chen Zhen with the command. Soon the messenger reached the town near the hills and asked the people where the prophet dwelt. They led him far into a secluded valley like a fairy village, very unlike any ordinary spot. Soon a lad came to receive the visitor. “You are surely Chen Zhen.” Chen Zhen was startled that the lad knew him, and still more so at the familiar address, and said, “O superhuman boy, how do you know my name so well?” “Last evening my master told me that a messenger with an imperial command would come today and mentioned your name.” “Truly he is more than wise;” said Chen Zhen, “and people have not believed him.” So the two proceeded to the old man's abode, and Chen Zhen declared his errand. The old man said he was too aged to travel. “But the Emperor anxiously desires to see you face to face, if haply you would not mind making the effort.” In the end, and after much persuasion, the old fellow consented and went. The First Ruler received him affably, surprised at the contrast between his hoary head and fresh boyish complexion. The venerable one had blue eyes, with square and sparkling pupils. His carriage was erect, and he stood straight as a pine tree. “This is no common man,” thought the First Ruler, and he treated him with distinguished courtesy. The seer said, “I am but an old man of the barren hill country, without learning or wisdom; you shame me, O Emperor, by calling me, and I know not why.” “I and my two brothers, both now deceased, swore a mutual oath some thirty years ago. Both have gone, both by violent deaths. I would lead a great army to avenge them and wish to know how the expedition will end. Hearing that you, Venerable Sir, are learned in the deeper mysteries, I sent for you and beg you to tell me.” “But this is fate; it is not for an old man like me to know.” But the First Ruler pressed him to say. However, the aged one got paper and a brush and wrote: “Soldiers, horses, weapons”—again and again on many sheets of paper. Having done this, he suddenly tore them into fragments. Further, he drew a picture of a tall man lying supine and another above him digging a grave. And over all he wrote: “White.” After this he bowed and departed, leaving the First Ruler annoyed. “This is only a demented man; what he says is not worthy of confidence,” said the First Ruler. And he burned the paper. Then he ordered an advance at full speed."
却說章武二年春正月，武威後將軍黃忠隨先主伐吳；忽聞先主言老將無用，卽提刀上馬，引親隨五六人，逕到彝陵營中。吳班與張南、馮習接入，問曰：“老將軍此來，有何事故？”忠曰：“吾自長沙跟天子到今，多負勤勞。今雖七旬有餘，尚食肉十斤，臂開二石之弓，能乘千里之馬，未足為老。昨日主上言吾等老邁無用，故來此與東吳交鋒，看吾斬將，老也不老！”,"However, it was said that in the first month of spring in the second year of Zhangwu, the post-Wuwei general Huang Zhong followed the First Sovereign to attack Wu; suddenly, hearing the First Sovereign's words that the veteran general was useless, he took up his sword and mounted his horse, and led five or six men to the Yiling camp. Wu Ban joined Zhang Nan and Feng Xi and asked, ""What happened to the old general here?"" Zhong said, ""I have been working hard since Changsha and the emperor until now. Although I am more than seventy years old, I still eat meat for ten years. Jin, with a bow of two stones in the arm, and a horse that can ride a thousand miles, is not old enough. Yesterday, the Lord said that my old age is useless, so I came here to fight against Eastern Wu, and watch me cut generals, and I am not old!""","When Huang Zhong hears that the first ruler has been dismissive of his older commanders, he is outraged. So much so that he takes up his sword, mounts his horse and sets off for battle! Arriving at Wu Ban’s camp, he is asked why he has come and tells them in no uncertain terms that he is fit enough and strong enough for war.","When he heard his master talk of old and incapable leaders, he girded on his sword and with a few faithful followers made his way to the camps at Yiling. He was welcomed by Wu Ban, the commander in charge of the siege there. “For what reason do you come, O Veteran General?” asked he. “I have followed the Emperor ever since he left Changsha, and I have done diligent service. I am now over seventy, but my appetite is still good for ten pounds of meat, and I can still stretch the strongest bow, and I can still ride five hundred miles without fatigue. I am not weak or worn out. But our master has been talking of old and useless leaders, and I am come to take part in the fight with Wu. If I slay one of their leaders, he will see I may be old but not worn out.”"

權聞言惶愧，卽叱退武士，命芝上殿，賜坐而問曰：“吳、魏之利害若何？願先生敎我。”芝曰：“大王欲與蜀和，還是欲與魏和？”權曰：“孤正欲與蜀主講和；但恐蜀主年輕識淺，不能全始全終耳。”芝曰：“大王乃命世之英豪，諸葛亮亦一時之俊傑；蜀有山川之險，吳有三江之固：若二國連和，共為脣齒，進則可以兼吞天下，退則可以鼎足而立。今大王若委贄稱臣於魏，魏必望大王朝覲，求太子以為內侍；如其不從，則興兵夾攻，蜀亦順流而進取：如此則江南之地，不復為大王有矣。若大王以愚言為不然，愚將就死於大王之前，以絕說客之名也。”言訖，撩衣下殿，望油鼎中便跳。權急命止之，請入後殿，以上賓之禮相待。權曰：“先生之言，正合孤意。孤今欲與蜀主連和，先生肯為我介紹乎？”芝曰：“適欲烹小臣者，乃大王也；今欲使小臣者，亦大王也：大王猶自狐疑未定，安能取信於人？”權曰：“孤意已決，先生勿疑。”,"When Quan heard the words, he was ashamed, and he scolded the warriors back. He ordered Zhi to go up to the hall, gave him a seat, and asked, ""What are the interests of Wu and Wei? May you teach me, sir."" Zhi said, ""Your Majesty wants to reconcile with Shu, or does he wish to reconcile with Wei. Quan said: ""Guzheng wants to make peace with the master of Shu; but I am afraid that the master of Shu is young and knowledgeable, and will not be able to hear everything from the beginning to the end."" Zhi said: ""The king is the hero of the world, and Zhuge Liang is also a hero of the moment; there are mountains and rivers in Shu. The danger is that Wu has the solidity of three rivers: if the two kingdoms are united and they are like lips and teeth, if they advance, they can swallow the whole world, and if they retreat, they can stand on the top of their heads. ; If they do not follow, they will raise troops to attack, and Shu will also follow the flow and make progress: If this is the case, the land in the south of the Yangtze River will no longer be the king. If the king is not the case with foolish words, the foolish general will die before the king, in the name of a great talker. That's right."" After saying that, he lifted his clothes and went down to the palace, looking at the oil tripod and jumping. The authority urgently orders to stop it, please enter the apse, and treat each other with courtesy. Quan said: ""Sir's words are in line with Gu Yi. Gu now wants to make peace with the Lord of Shu, would you be willing to introduce me?"" Zhi said: ""The person who wants to cook a small minister is a great king; now I want to make a small minister This is also the great king: the great king is still doubtful and undecided, can he win the trust of others?"" Quan said, ""The loneliness has been decided, sir, don't doubt it.""",Kong Ming agrees with the second ruler that if Deng Zhi returns with an envoy from Wu then they will forge an alliance against Wei.,"As soon as Sun Quan heard these words, he bade the soldiers go, and called the envoy into the hall. There he invited him to a seat and said, “What is the real matter between Wei and Wu? I desire that you would inform me.” Then Deng Zhi replied, “Do you, great Prince, desire to discuss peace with Wei or with Shu?” “I really desire to discuss peace with the Ruler of Shu. But he is young and inexperienced and ignorant, and unable to carry a matter through.” “Prince, you are a valiant warrior, just as Zhuge Liang is a great minister. Now Shu has the strength of its mountainous geography just as Wu has the protection of its three rivers. If these two countries are at peace, they are mutually protective. They may swallow up the rest of the empire, or they may stand secure alone. If you send tribute to Wei and acknowledge yourself one of its ministers, you will be expected to attend at court, and your heir-apparent will become a servant in that court; and if you disobey, an army of Wei will be sent to attack you. Shu also will come down the river and invade your country. Then this country will be yours no longer. And if you listen not to these words of mine, and refuse my offer, I shall commit suicide before your face and so justify the post I have as an envoy.” As Deng Zhi spoke these last words, he gathered up his robes and marched down the hall as though he was just going to jump into the cauldron. “Stop him!” cried Sun Quan, and they did so. Then he requested Deng Zhi to go into an inner apartment, where he treated the envoy as a guest of the highest honor. “O Master,” said Sun Quan, “your words exactly express my thoughts, and I desire to make a league of peace with your country. Are you willing to be the intermediary?” “Just now it was you, O Prince, who wished to boil this poor servant; now it is also you who wish to use him. How can such a doubtful person be trusted?” “My mind is made up,” replied Sun Quan. “Do not doubt me, Master.”"

却說孔明渡了瀘水，下寨已畢，大賞三軍，聚諸將於帳下曰：“孟獲第二番擒來，吾令遍觀各營虛實，正欲令其來劫營也。吾知孟獲頗曉兵法，吾以兵馬糧草炫耀，實令孟獲看吾破綻，必用火攻。彼令其弟詐降，欲為內應耳。吾三番擒之而不殺，誠欲服其心，不欲滅其類也。吾今明告汝等，勿得辭勞，可用心報國。”衆將拜伏曰：“丞相智、仁、勇三者足備；雖子牙、張良，不能及也。”孔明曰：“吾今安敢望古人耶？皆賴汝等之力，共成功業耳。”帳下諸將聽得孔明之言，盡皆喜悅。,"However, he said that Kongming had crossed the Lushui River and had finished his entry into the fortress. He rewarded the three armies and gathered the generals under the tent, saying: ""Meng Huo has been captured for the second time. Knowing that Meng Huo is quite knowledgeable about the art of war, I show off with soldiers, horses, food, and grass. In fact, when Meng Huo sees my flaws, he will attack with fire. He ordered his younger brother to deceive and surrender. I want to destroy its kind. Now I tell you clearly, don’t give up your labor, but serve the country with your heart.” The generals bowed down and said, “The prime minister is fully equipped with wisdom, benevolence, and courage; although Ziya and Zhang Liang cannot be reached.” Kong Ming said: ""I dare to look to the ancients now? All of them depend on your strength to achieve success together."" The generals under the tent were all delighted when they heard Kong Ming's words.","Kong Ming again explains to his officers his desire to win the tribes by kindness not through violence. However, Meng Huo is full of anger and resentment. He sends gifts to the eight tribes of the borders, calling all the Man peoples to come to his aid. Hundreds of thousands obey but perhaps they should have noticed that when Kong Ming is informed of this, he simply smiles.","Pledged was he to subdue the south, Thereby to repay the First Ruler's deference with service. Wherefore he attacked the Mangs. Yet seven times he freed their captured king. After the crossing of the river, the soldiers were feasted. Then Zhuge Liang addressed his officers: “I let Meng Huo see our camp the second time he was our prisoner, because I wanted to tempt him into raiding it. He is something of a soldier, and I dangled our supplies and resources before his eyes, knowing he would try to burn them and that he would send his brother to pretend to submit that thereby he could get into our camp and have a chance to betray us. I have captured and released him three times, trying to win him over. I do not wish to do him any harm. I now explain my policy that you may understand I am not wasting your efforts and you are still to work your best for the government.” They all bowed, and one said, “O Minister, you are indeed perfect in every one of the three gifts: wisdom, benevolence, and valor. Not even Lu Wang or Zhang Liang can equal you!” Said Zhuge Liang, “How can I expect to equal our men of old? But my trust is in your strength, and together we shall succeed.” This speech of their leader's pleased them all mightily."
當日張任射死龐統，漢軍擁塞，進退不得，死者大半。前軍飛報魏延。魏延忙勒兵欲回，奈山路逼窄，廝殺不得。又被張任截斷歸路，在高阜處用強弓硬弩射來。魏延心慌。有新降蜀兵曰：“不如殺奔雒城下，取大路而進。”延從其言，當先開路，殺奔雒城來。塵埃起處，前面一軍殺至，乃雒城守將吳蘭、雷銅也；後面張任引兵追來。前後夾攻，把魏延圍在垓心。魏延死戰不能得脫。但見吳蘭、雷銅後軍自亂，二將急回馬去救。魏延乘勢趕去，當先一將，舞刀拍馬，大叫：“文長，吾特來救汝！”視之，乃老將黃忠也。兩下夾攻，殺敗吳、雷二將，直衝至雒城之下。劉璝引兵殺出，却得玄德在後當住接應。黃忠、魏延翻身便回。玄德軍馬比及奔到寨中，張任軍馬又從小路裏截出。劉璝、吳蘭、雷銅當先趕來。玄德守不住二寨，且戰且走，奔回涪關。蜀兵得勝，迤邐追趕。玄德人困馬乏，那裏有心廝殺，且只顧奔走。將近涪關，張任一軍追趕至緊。幸得左邊劉封，右邊關平，二將引三萬生力兵截出，殺退張任；還趕二十里，奪回戰馬極多。,"Zhang Ren shot Pang Tong to death that day, and the Han army was congested, unable to advance or retreat, and most of the dead were killed. The former army reported to Wei Yan. Wei Yan was busy trying to force his troops to return, but the Naishan road was narrowed and they could not fight. He was cut off by Zhang Ren and shot at Gaofu with a strong bow and a crossbow. Wei Yan panicked. A new soldier who surrendered to Shu said: ""It's better to kill Benluo City and take the road to enter."" Where the dust started, an army in front was killed, Wu Lan and Lei Tong, the defenders of Luocheng; Zhang Ren led troops to pursue them. Attacking from front and back, Wei Yan was surrounded by Gaixin. Wei Yan couldn't get out of the fight to the death. But seeing Wu Lan and Lei Tong's army in chaos, the two generals rushed back to their horses to rescue them. Wei Yan took advantage of the momentum and rushed to the front. He was the first general, waving his sword and beating his horse, and shouted: ""Chairman Wen, I am here to save you!"" As he saw it, it was the veteran general Huang Zhongye. They attacked twice, defeated the two generals Wu and Lei, and rushed to Luocheng. Liu Wei led his troops out, but Xuande had to wait in the back. Huang Zhong and Wei Yan turned over and returned. Xuande's army horse Biji rushed to the village, and Zhang Ren's army and horse intercepted it from the path. Liu Xuan, Wu Lan, and Lei Tong came first. Xuande couldn't hold the Erzhai, and he fought and walked back to Fuguan. The Shu soldiers were victorious and chased after him. The people of Xuande were tired of horses, and they were determined to fight, and they only cared about running. As Fuguan was approaching, Zhang Yijun was chasing after him. Fortunately, Liu Feng on the left and Guan Ping on the right, the second general led 30,000 new troops to intercept and slaughter Zhang Ren.","As the Han rises again The path to Shu is clear. The way is open And a dragon is there! The battle that then ensues swings first this way towards Xuande’s men and then back to the men of Shu. At one point Zheng Ren almost captures a cornered Xuande, but a timely intervention by thirty thousand of his troops saves him.","Not only was the leader of the expedition slain, but more than half of his soldiers fell in the narrow road that fatal day. Some of the troops in the van escaped and ran off to tell Wei Yan of the mishap to the army, and he halted and turned back to help. However, it was difficult to march back, and he could not hack a way through, for the road was held by Zhang Ren, and archers and crossbowmen occupied all the heights. Then one of the renegades proposed that they should try to return along the high road, and they started for Luocheng this way. But in front of them arose a great cloud of dust, betraying the approach of an enemy. Wu Lan and Lei Tong, the defenders of the city, were moving toward them, and Wei Yan was between the two armies closed in like the kernel of a nut. Wei Yan fought hard to get through. When his case seemed most desperate and hopeless, he observed signs of confusion in the army that lay between him and the city. Soon that army turned and faced the other way. He pressed forward and presently saw troops of his own side, led by the veteran Huang Zhong. “I will rescue you, Wei Yan!” shouted Huang Zhong, as he came near. Now the defenders of Luocheng found themselves between two enemies, and they were smitten heavily. They could not check Wei Yan and Huang Zhong, who got close to the very walls of Luocheng. Seeing them near, Liu Gui, who had been left to defend the city, poured out against them. Thereupon Huang Zhong and Wei Yan, in spite of the nearness of the army of Liu Bei, refused battle and turned sway from the city. Liu Bei's army made a dash for two stockades, but when Zhang Ren came along the by-road, and the other three defenders of the city came on, the stockades could not be held, and Liu Bei's army had to retire. Now fighting and now marching, the army of Liu Bei strove hard to reach River Fu Pass, but Zhang Ren pressed close. However, Liu Feng and Guan Ping came up, and not only drove back the pursuers but chased them some seven miles. Finally, Liu Bei and his troops reached the Pass, weary and dispirited. His son and nephew returned from the pursuit with many horses they had captured from the flying enemy. However, nothing had been gained and the victory lay rather with the army of the Western Land of River."

却說玄德軍馬在雒城。法正所差下書人回報說：“鄭度勸劉璋盡燒野穀，并各處倉廩，率巴西之民，避於涪水西，深溝高壘而不戰。”玄德、孔明聞之，皆大驚曰：“若用此言，吾勢危矣！”法正笑曰：“主公勿憂：此計雖毒，劉璋必不能用也。”不一日，人傳劉璋不肯遷動百姓，不從鄭度之言。玄德聞之，方始寬心。孔明曰：“可速進兵取綿竹：如得此處，成都易取矣。”遂遣黃忠、魏延領兵前進。費觀聽知玄德兵來，差李嚴出迎。嚴領三千兵出，各布陣完。黃忠出馬，與李嚴戰四五十合，不分勝負。孔明在帳中敎鳴金收軍。黃忠回陣，問曰：“正待要擒李嚴，軍師何故收兵？”孔明曰：“吾已見李嚴武藝，不可力取。來日再戰，汝可詐敗，引入山峪，出奇兵以勝之。”黃忠領計。次日，李嚴再引兵來，黃忠又出戰，不十合詐敗，引兵便走。李嚴趕來，迤邐趕入山峪，猛然省悟。急待回時，前面魏延引兵擺開。孔明自在山頭，喚曰：“公如不降，兩下已伏強弩，欲與吾龐士元報讎矣。”李嚴慌下馬卸甲投降。軍士不曾傷害一人。孔明引李嚴見玄德。玄德待之甚厚。嚴曰：“費觀雖是劉益州親戚，與某甚密，當往說之。”玄德卽命李嚴回城招降費觀。嚴入綿竹城，對費觀讚玄德如此仁德；今若不降，必有大禍。觀從其言，開門投降。玄德遂入綿竹，商議分兵取成都。忽流星馬急報，言孟達、霍峻守葭萌關，今被東川張魯遣馬超與楊柏、馬岱領兵攻打甚急，救遲則關隘休矣。玄德大驚。孔明曰：“須是張、趙二將，方可與敵。”玄德曰：“子龍引兵在外未回。翼得已在此，可急遣之。”孔明曰：“主公且勿言，容亮激之。”,"He said that Xuande's army was in Luocheng. The person sent by Fazheng to send the book reported: ""Zheng Du persuaded Liu Zhang to burn all the wild valleys and storehouses in various places, and lead the people of Brazil to avoid the west of the Fushui River. The deep trenches and high fortresses did not fight."" Xuande and Kong Ming heard this. They were all shocked and said, ""If I use these words, my situation is in danger!"" Fazheng laughed and said, ""My lord, don't worry: although this tactic is poisonous, Liu Zhang will definitely not be able to use it."" Within a day, it was rumored that Liu Zhang would not move. To move the people, do not follow the words of Zheng Du. When Xuande heard this, Fang Shi was relieved. Kong Ming said: ""You can quickly advance troops to take Mianzhu: if you get here, Chengdu will be easy to take."" He then sent Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to lead the army forward. Fei Guan heard that Xuande's troops were coming, and sent Li Yan to greet him. Yan led 3,000 soldiers out, and they were all set up. Huang Zhong went out and fought with Li Yan forty or fifty. Kong Ming ordered Ming Jin to withdraw from the tent. Huang Zhong returned to the formation and asked, ""I'm about to capture Li Yan, why did the military commander withdraw the troops?"" Kong Ming said, ""I've seen Li Yan's martial arts, and I can't take it by force. If you fight again in the future, you can cheat and lead to the mountain valley. Surprise your troops to win."" Huang Zhong led the plan. The next day, Li Yan led the troops again, and Huang Zhong went to battle again. Li Yan came, rushed into the mountain valley, and suddenly realized. When he was anxious to return, Wei Yan in front led his troops to move away. Kong Ming was at the top of the mountain, and called out, ""If you don't surrender, you have already put down a strong crossbow, and you want to report to me, Pang Shiyuan."" Li Yan dismounted his horse and surrendered in a panic. The sergeant never hurt anyone. Kong Ming invited Li Yan to see Xuande. Xuande was very kind. Yan said, ""Although Fei Guan is a relative of Liu Yizhou, he is very close to a certain person, so he should talk to him."" Xuande ordered Li Yan to return to the city to recruit Fei Guan. Yan entered Mianzhu City and praised Fei Guan for being so benevolent. Listen to his words, open the door and surrender. Xuande then entered Mianzhu and discussed dividing his troops to take Chengdu. Suddenly, Meteor and Ma urgently reported that Mengda and Huo Jun were guarding Jiameng Pass, and now Zhang Lu of Dongchuan sent Ma Chao, Yang Bo, and Ma Dai to lead troops to attack them urgently. Xuande was shocked. Kong Ming said: ""You must be the two generals of Zhang and Zhao before you can fight the enemy."" Xuande said, ""Zilong has led his troops outside and has not returned. Yide is already here, so he can be dispatched urgently."" Kong Ming said: ""My lord, please don't return. Say it, Rong Liang is excited.""","So, first of all, Zhang Lu sends Huang Quan to Liu Zhang to say he will help. Then he gives Ma Chao twenty thousand soldiers and despatches him towards the pass. But he also sends Yang Bo to oversee manoeuvres. Meanwhile Xuande is determined to seize Mianzhu. This is the gateway to capturing Chengdu. Huang Zhong and Wei Yan are sent to take the city. Initially resistance is offered by the champion Li Yan. He rides out and challenges Huang Zhong to single combat, but neither of them can overcome the other. Kong Ming therefore devises a plot to trap Li Yan. Huang Zhong rides out the next day to single combat but then turns and flees, luring Li Yan into following him. Li Yan rides straight into an ambush, and when Kong Ming calls upon him to surrender he does so immediately, and through this not a single man is wounded or dies. Having surrendered, Li Yan offers to negotiate the surrender of Mianzhu, and this is swiftly achieved. As a result, no one is killed in the taking of the city. Then urgent news comes. A desperate message tells of the attack on the Jiameng pass by Ma Chao. This attack has caught the defenders off guard, and victory is within the grasp of Ma Chao. Of course, Xuande immediately decides a relief column needs to be sent, and that Zhang Fei should lead it. But Kong Ming decides to play a game with Zhang Fei, to really get him geared up for action. ‘Don’t say anything about this commission to him when he comes in,’ says Kong Ming to a somewhat bewildered Xuande. Having heard that action was called for, Zhang Fei comes to see Xuande convinced that he will be chosen. Shouting out loudly and cheerfully, he says, ‘Just coming to say goodbye before I go off and deal with this Ma Chao.’ Kong Ming acts as if Zhang Fei is not there and says, ‘Ma Chao is attacking the pass, but I cannot think who could possibly take him on, except perhaps Guan Yu.’","Meanwhile, the messenger sent by Fa Zheng had returned to Luocheng to report: “Zheng Du advised Liu Zhang to set fire to all the plains and valleys between the capital and the invaders, as well as the granaries, to move sway the people, and to stand solely on the defensive.” This news caused Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang great anxiety, for it would be a grave danger to them. However, Fa Zheng was more sanguine. “Do not be anxious,” said he, “the plan would be extremely harmful, but it will not be carried out. Liu Zhang will not do that.” Surely enough, very soon they heard that Liu Zhang had not adopted the suggestion; he would not remove the people. It was a great relief to Liu Bei. Then said Zhuge Liang, “Now let us capture Mianzhu quickly, for, that done, Chengdu is as good as ours.” Liu Bei therefore told off Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to advance first. When Commander of Mianzhu, Fei Guan, heard of their advance, he ordered Li Yan to go out to stop them, and Li Yan led out three thousand troops. The two sides being arrayed, Huang Zhong rode out and fought some half hundred bouts with Li Yan. Neither was able to claim a victory, and so Zhuge Liang from the midst of the host ordered them to beat the gongs to cease from battle. When Huang Zhong had got back to his side again, he said, “O Instructor, why did you sound the retirement just as I was getting the better of my opponent?” “Because I saw that Li Yan was not to be overcome by mere force. Tomorrow you shall fight again, and then you shall lead him into the hills by the ruse of pretended defeat. There will be a surprise awaiting him.” Huang Zhong agreed to try this plan, and so on the morrow accepted Li Yan's challenge when it was offered. After about the tenth bout, Huang Zhong and his troops pretended to be worsted and ran. Li Yan pursued and was quickly lured into the mountains. Suddenly his danger flashed into his mind, and he turned to go back. But he found Wei Yan's troops drawn up across his path, while Zhuge Liang from a hill top near by cried, “You would better yield; if not, there are bows and crossbows on both sides of you—all ready to avenge the death of our Pang Tong.” Li Yan dropped off his horse, threw aside his armor, and offered submission. Not a soldier of his had been hurt. The prisoner was conducted to Liu Bei, who was very affable and so won Li Yan's heart that Li Yan offered to try to seduce Fei Guan from his allegiance. “Though he is related to Liu Zhang, yet Fei Guan and I are very close friends. Let me go and persuade him.” Wherefore Li Yan was sent back to the city to induce his chief to come over to Liu Bei's side. Li Yan talked to such effect of the kindness and virtues of Liu Bei that Fei Guan was won over, opened the city gates, and admitted the invaders. As soon as Liu Bei had entered Mianzhu, he set out his forces to take the capital. While thus engaged, a hasty messenger came to tell of the doings at Jiameng Pass: “There suddenly appeared an army from the east under Ma Chao, Ma Dai, and Yang Bo. They are attacking, and the Pass will certainly be lost if help is not sent quickly.” “We need both Zhang Fei and Zhao Yun for this,” remarked Zhuge Liang. “Then we could oppose successfully.” “But Zhao Yun is away,” said Liu Bei. “However, Zhang Fei is here. Let us send him quickly.” “Do not say anything, my lord,” said Zhuge Liang."

正論間，忽報費褘到，孔明請入問之。褘曰：“魏主曹叡聞東吳三路進兵，乃自引大軍至合淝，令滿寵、田豫、劉劭分兵三路迎敵。滿寵設計盡燒東吳糧草戰具，吳兵多病。陸遜上表於吳王，約會前後夾攻，不意齎表人中途被魏兵所獲：因此機關洩漏，吳兵無功而還。”孔明聽知此信，長歎一聲，不覺昏倒於地；衆將急救，半晌方甦。孔明歎曰：“吾心昏亂，舊病復發，恐不能生矣！”是夜孔明扶病出帳，仰觀天文，十分驚慌；入帳謂姜維曰：“吾命在旦夕矣！”維曰：“丞相何出此言？”孔明曰：“吾見三台星中，客星倍明，主星幽隱，相輔列曜，其光昏暗：天象如此，吾命可知！”維曰：“天象雖則如此，丞相何不用祈禳之法挽回之？”孔明曰：“吾素諳祈禳之法，但未知天意若何。汝可引甲士四十九人，各執皂旗，穿皂衣，環繞帳外；我自於帳中祈禳北斗。若七日內主燈不滅，吾壽可增一紀；如燈滅，吾必死矣。閒雜人等，休敎放入。凡一應需用之物，只令二小童搬運。”姜維領命，自去準備。時值八月中秋。是夜銀河耿耿，玉露零零；旌旗不動，刁斗無聲。姜維在帳外引四十九人守護。孔明自於帳中設香花祭物：地上分布七盞大燈，外布四十九盞小燈，內安本命燈一盞。孔明拜祝曰：“亮生於亂世，甘老林泉；承昭烈皇帝三顧之恩，託孤之重，不敢不竭犬馬之勞，誓討國賊。不意將星欲墜，陽壽將終。謹書尺素，上告穹蒼：伏望天慈，俯垂鑒聽，曲延臣算，使得上報君恩，下救民命，克復舊物，永延漢祀。非敢妄祈，實由情切。”拜祝畢，就帳中俯伏待旦。次日，扶病理事，吐血不止——日則計議軍機，夜則步罡踏斗。,"In the middle of the discussion, suddenly the report fee arrived, and Kong Ming asked him to come in. He said: ""Wei Lord Cao Rui heard that Soochow Wu was advancing on three routes, so he led the army to Hefei, and ordered Man Chong, Tian Yu, and Liu Shao to divide his troops to face the enemy. I'm sick. Lu Xun sent a letter to King Wu, and he attacked him before and after the appointment, but he didn't intend that the person was captured by Wei Bing in the middle: so the agency leaked, and Wu Bing returned without success."" When Kong Ming heard the letter, he sighed and fainted. On the ground; the generals first aid, Fang Su after a long while. Kong Ming sighed and said, ""My heart is dizzy, my old disease has relapsed, and I'm afraid I won't be able to live!"" At night, Kongming helped the sick and went out of the tent, looking up at the astronomical sky, and was very panicked; ""Why did the prime minister make such a statement?"" Kong Ming said, ""I see that among the three stars, the guest star is brighter, the main star is hidden, and the stars are complementary, and their light is dim: the sky is like this, I know it!"" Wei said: ""The sky is like this. Even so, why don't the prime minister use the method of praying to save him?"" Kong Ming said: ""I know the method of praying, but I don't know what the will of heaven is. Surround the outside of the tent; I will pray to the Big Dipper in the tent. If the main lamp does not go out within seven days, my lifespan will be extended by one period; if the lamp goes out, I will die. , only let the second child carry it."" Jiang Wei took the order and went to prepare. It's Mid-Autumn Festival in August. It is the night of the Milky Way, and the jade dew is scattered; the flags are not moving, and the fights are silent. Jiang Wei led forty-nine guards outside the tent. Kong Mingzi set up incense flower offerings in the tent: seven large lamps on the ground, forty-nine small lamps on the outside, and one lamp of life in the inner. Kong Ming paid his respects and said: ""Liang was born in troubled times, Gan Lao Linquan; I bear the kindness of Emperor Zhaolie's three cares, take care of orphans, dare not exhaust the labor of dogs and horses, and swear to punish the country's thieves. Unexpectedly, the stars are about to fall, and Yang's life will end. Chisu, report to the sky: Fu Wangtian's mercy, bowing down and listening, Qu Yanchen counts, so that he can report the kindness of the king, save the lives of the people, restore the old things, and forever extend the Han ritual. ""After praying, he prostrated himself in the tent and waited. The next day, he helped the patient, and he vomited blood continuously—the day was to discuss the military aircraft, and the night was to fight with each other.","Instead the messenger is questioned by Sima Yi about the habits of Kong Ming. ‘ He rises early and works late into the night,’ says the messenger. ‘ He oversees all the details, including punishments, and eats almost nothing.’ This heartens Sima Yi, who tells his officers that such a lifestyle means Kong Ming cannot last much longer. His own officers try to encourage Kong Ming to lighten his workload but they cannot move him. However, such questioning disturbs Kong Ming’s equilibrium, and his refusal to pay any attention makes his officers give up trying to help. Sima Yi is also having trouble with his commanders, who want to attack, whereas Sima Yi is holding the defensive position. He even has to ask Cao Rui to confirm the order that there is to be no attack, so as to keep his officers in line. When news reaches Kong Ming of the defeat and retreat of the Wu army, he collapses. As his officers help him up, he mutters, ‘This old problem. Perhaps my end is near.’ Late that night he staggers out to study the stars and then tells Jiang Wei that he has but a few days to live because the stars show that his end is near. Jiang Wei beseeches him to try magic to prolong his life, and he agrees. It is the late summer of AD 234, and a great ritual site is set up for Kong Ming to commune with his guiding star. But the next day after the ritual, he is weaker, and blood comes from his mouth. Sima Yi sees in the stars that Kong Ming is failing and immediately orders an attack. As Kong Ming is praying with a ritual lamp burning bright – sign of his life energy – Wei Yan rushes in to announce that the Wei army is advancing to the attack. So hasty and clumsy is he that he knocks over the lamp, and it goes out.","Just at this time Fei Yi came. He was called in to see the Prime Minister, and Zhuge Liang asked the reason for his coming. He replied, “The Ruler of Wei, Cao Rui, hearing that Wu has invaded his country at three points, has led a great army to Hefei and sent three other armies under Man Chong, Tian Du, and Liu Shao, to oppose the invaders. The stores and fight-material of Wu have been burned, and the army of Wu have fallen victims to sickness. A letter from Lu Xun containing a scheme of attack fell into the hands of the enemy, and the Ruler of Wu has marched back into his own country.” Zhuge Liang listened to the end; then, without a word, he fell in a swoon. He recovered after a time, but he was broken. He said, “My mind is all in confusion. This is a return of my old illness, and I am doomed.” Ill as he was, Zhuge Liang that night went forth from his tent to scan the heavens and study the stars. They filled him with fear. He returned and said to Jiang Wei, “My life may end at any moment.” “Why do you say such a thing?” “Just now in the Triumvirate constellation the Guest Star was twice as bright as usual, while the Host Star was darkened; the supporting stars were also obscure. With such an aspect I know my fate.” “If the aspect be as malignant as you say, why not pray in order to avert it?” replied Jiang Wei. “I am in the habit of praying,” replied Zhuge Liang, “but I know not the will of God. However, prepare me forty-nine guards and let each have a black flag. Dress them in black and place them outside my tent. Then will I from within my tent invoke the Seven Stars of the North. If my master-lamp remain alight for seven days, then is my life to be prolonged for twelve years. If the lamp goes out, then I am to die. Keep all idlers away from the tent and let a couple of guards bring me what is necessary.” Jiang Wei prepared as directed. It was then the eighth month, mid-autumn, and the Milky Way was brilliant with scattered jade. The air was perfectly calm, and no sound was heard. The forty-nine men were brought up and spaced out to guard the tent, while within Zhuge Liang prepared incense and offerings. On the floor of the tent he arranged seven lamps, and, outside these, forty-nine smaller lamps. In the midst he placed the lamp of his own fate. This done, he prayed: “Zhuge Liang, born into an age of trouble, would willingly have grown old in retirement. But His Majesty, Liu Bei the Glorious Emperor, sought him thrice and confided to him the heavy responsibility of guarding his son. He dared not do less than spend himself to the utmost in such a task, and he pledged himself to destroy the rebels. Suddenly the star of his leadership has declined, and his life now nears its close. He has humbly indited a declaration on this silk piece to the Great Unknowable and now hopes that He will graciously listen and extend the number of his days that he may prove his gratitude to his prince and be the savior of the people, restore the old state of the empire and establish eternally the Han sacrifices. He dares not make a vain prayer; this is from his heart.” This prayer ended, in the solitude of his tent he awaited the dawn. Next day, ill as he was, he did not neglect his duties, although he spat blood continually. All day he labored at his plans, and at night he paced the magic steps, the steps of seven stars of Ursa Major and Ursa Minor."
懿令兩寨人馬暫退二十里，縱城內軍民出城樵採柴薪，牧放牛馬。司馬陳羣問曰：“前太尉攻上庸之時，兵分八路，八日趕至城下，遂生擒孟達而成大功；今帶甲四萬，數千里而來，不令攻打城池，却使久居泥濘之中，又縱賊衆樵牧：某實不知太尉是何主意。”懿笑曰：“公不知兵法耶？昔孟達糧多兵少，我糧少兵多，故不可不速戰；出其不意，突然攻之，方可取勝。今遼兵多，我兵少，賊飢我飽，何必力攻？正當任彼自走，然後乘機擊之。我今放開一條路，不絕彼之樵牧，是容彼自走也。”陳羣拜服。,"Yi ordered the men and horses of the two villages to temporarily retreat for twenty li, and the soldiers and civilians in the city went out of the city to collect firewood and herd cattle and horses. Sima Chen Qun asked, ""When the former Grand Commander attacked Shangyong, his troops were divided into eight routes, and they rushed to the bottom of the city on the eighth day, and they captured Meng Da alive and achieved great success. After living in the mud for a long time, he let the thieves and the woodcutter and herdsmen: I really don’t know what the commander’s idea was.” Yi smiled and said, “You don’t know the tactics of war? In the past, Mengda had more food and less soldiers, and I had less food and more soldiers, so I had to hurry up. Fight; surprise, attack it suddenly, then you can win. Today Liao has many soldiers, I have few soldiers, and the thieves are hungry and I am full, why should I attack? Just let him go on his own, and then take the opportunity to attack. The woodcutter and herdsman for him is to allow him to walk by himself."" Chen Qun bowed.","The enemy really stands very little chance against a commander as skilful as Sima Yi, but the weather – it is autumn – causes many problems for the Wei army, and this leads to dissent. Sima Yi deals with this with severity, showing little mercy.","Then Sima Yi ordered the south camp to be abandoned, and the army marched seven miles south, thus allowing the soldiers and people in the city to come out to gather fuel and pasture their cattle. The attacking army could not understand this move, and Chen Qun spoke about it. “When you besieged Shangyong, O Regent Marshal, you attacked all round at eight points, and the city fell in eight days. Meng Da was taken, and you won a great success. Now your forty thousand troops have borne their armors many days over long marches and you do not press the attack, but keep the them in the mud and mire and let the enemy gather supplies and feed their cattle. I do not know what your intention may be.” “Sir,” replied the Commander-in-Chief, “I see you are ignorant of war after all. You do not understand the different conditions. Meng Da then had ample supplies and few troops; we were under exactly opposite conditions, and so we had to attack vigorously and at once. The suddenness of the attack defeated the enemy. But look at present conditions. The Liaodong troops are many and we few; they are on the verge of starvation, and we are full fed. Why should we force the attack? Our line is to let the soldiers desert and capture the city. Therefore I leave a gate open and the road free that they may run away.” Chen Qun then understood and acknowledged the correctness of the strategy."
迷當從之，遂引羌兵在前，魏兵在後，逕奔鐵籠山。時值三更，先令人報知姜維。維大喜，敎請入相見。魏兵多半雜在羌人部內；行到蜀寨前，維令大兵皆在寨外屯紮，迷當引百餘人到中軍帳前。姜維、夏侯霸二人出迎。魏將不等迷當開言，就從背後殺將起來。維大驚，急上馬而走。羌、魏之兵，一齊殺入。蜀兵四分五落，各自逃生。維手無器械，腰間止有一副弓箭，走得慌忙，箭皆落了，只有空壼。維望山中而走，背後郭淮引兵趕來；見維手無寸鐵，乃驟馬挺鎗追之。看看至近，維虛拽弓弦，連響十餘次。淮連躲數番，不見箭到，知維無箭，乃挂住鋼鎗，拈弓搭箭射之。維急閃過，順手接了，就扣在弓弦上；待淮追近，望面門上儘力射去，淮應弦落馬。維勒回馬來殺郭淮，魏軍驟至。維下手不及，只掣得淮鎗而去。魏兵不敢追趕，急救淮歸寨，拔出箭頭，血流不止而死。司馬昭下山引兵追趕，半途而回。夏侯霸隨後逃至，與姜維一齊奔走。維折了許多人馬，一路收紮不住，自回漢中：雖然兵敗，却射死郭淮，殺死徐質，挫動魏國之威，將功補罪。,"Fan should follow it, and then led the Qiang soldiers in the front, Wei soldiers in the back, and went straight to the Iron Cage Mountain. It's the third watch, so let's report to Jiang Wei first. Wei is overjoyed, please come and meet. Most of the Wei soldiers were mixed in the Qiang tribe; before they reached the Shu village, the Wei Ling soldiers were all stationed outside the village, and they should lead more than 100 people to the front of the central army tent. Jiang Wei and Xiahouba went out to greet him. Wei Jiang did not wait for Fan to speak, and then killed Jiang from behind. Wei was startled and hurried off on his horse. The soldiers of Qiang and Wei entered together. The Shu soldiers fell into four parts, and each escaped. Wei had no equipment in his hands, and there was a pair of bows and arrows at his waist. He walked in a hurry, all the arrows fell, and there was only an empty ridge. Wei Wang walked in the middle of the mountain, and Guo Huai led his troops behind him; seeing that Wei was unarmed, he suddenly chased after him with a spear on his horse. Looking closer, Wei Xu pulled the bowstring and rang it more than ten times in a row. Huailian hid several times, but did not see the arrow coming. Knowing that Wei had no arrows, he hung up the steel spear and shot it with a bow and arrow. Wei rushed past, took it smoothly, and buckled it on the bowstring; when Huai approached, he tried his best to shoot at the door, and Huai Yingxian fell off his horse. Wei Le returned to Malaysia to kill Guo Huai, and the Wei army suddenly arrived. Wei couldn't get his hands on it, so he just grabbed the spear and left. Wei Bing didn't dare to chase, and rescued Huai to return to the village, pulled out the arrowhead, and died of bleeding. Sima Zhao went down the mountain and led his troops to pursue him, but returned halfway. Xiahouba then fled to the area and ran with Jiang Wei. Wei broke down many men and horses, unable to hold back all the way, and returned to Hanzhong: Although he was defeated, he shot Guo Huai and killed Xu Zhi, frustrating the prestige of Wei State, and making up for the crime.","Attacking the Shu camp, they surprise the men and overwhelm the camp. Jiang Wei has to flee but he manages to wound Guo Huai as he retreats. That night Guo Huai dies. Once again the armies retreat. Jiang Wei has lost again, though he has managed to kill Xu Zhi and Guo Huai, so the effort so far as he is concerned is not completely wasted.","He set out forthwith, his own army leading and the army of Wei in the rear. At the third watch he sent on a messenger to tell Jiang Wei of his coming. And the Shu leader was glad. Mi Dang was invited to enter. On the march the soldiers of Wei had mingled with the Qiangs, and many of them were in the forefront of the army. Mi Dang went up toward the gate with a small company, and Jiang Wei with Xiahou Ba went to welcome him. Just as they met, before Mi Dang could say a word, the Wei generals dashed on past him and set on to slay. Jiang Wei was taken aback, leaped on his steed and fled, while the mixed force of troops of Wei and Qiangs drove the camp defenders before them and sent them flying. When Jiang Wei leaped upon his steed at the gate, he had no weapon in his hand, only his bow and quiver hung at his shoulder. In his hasty flight the arrows fell out and the quiver was empty, so when he set off for the hills with Guo Huai in pursuit, Jiang Wei had nothing to oppose to the spears of his pursuers. As they came near he laid hands upon his bow and made as if to shoot. The string twanged and Guo Huai blenched. But as no arrow went flying by, Guo Huai knew Jiang Wei had none to shoot. Guo Huai therefore hung his spear, took his bow and shot. Jiang Wei caught the arrow as it flew by and fitted it to his bowstring. He waited till Guo Huai came quite near, when he pulled the string with all his force and sent the arrow flying straight at Guo Huai's face. Guo Huai fell even as the bowstring sang. Jiang Wei pulled up and turned to finish his fallen enemy, but the soldiers of Wei were nearly upon him, and he had only time to snatch up Guo Huai's spear and ride off. Now that Jiang Wei was armed and their own leader wounded, the soldiers of Wei had no more desire to fight. They picked up their general and carried him to camp. There the arrow-head was pulled out, but the flow of blood could not be stanched, and Guo Huai died. Sima Zhao descended from the hill as soon as Jiang Wei moved away, and pursued some distance before returning. Xiahou Ba forced his way out and rejoined Jiang Wei as soon as he could, and they marched away together. The losses of Shu in this defeat were very heavy. On the road they dared not halt to muster or reform, but went helter-skelter into Hanzhong. In that campaign, though the Shu army were defeated, they had killed Xu Zhi and Guo Huai on the other side and had damaged the prestige of Wei."
玄德再三推遲不過，只得依允。建安二十四年秋七月，築壇於沔陽，方圓九里，分布五方，各設旌旗儀仗。羣臣皆依次序排列。許靖、法正請玄德登壇，進冠冕璽綬訖，面南而坐，受文武官員拜賀為漢中王。子劉禪，立為王世子。封許靖為太傅，法正為尚書令。諸葛亮為軍師，總理軍國重事。封關羽、張飛、趙雲、馬超、黃忠為五虎大將；魏延為漢中太守。其餘各擬功勳定爵。,"Xuande postponed it again and again, so he had to obey. In the autumn and July of the twenty-fourth year of Jian'an, the altar was built in Mianyang, with a radius of nine miles and five directions, with flags and honor guards set up in each. The ministers are arranged in order. Xu Jing and Fazheng invited Xuande to go to the altar, enter the crown and seal, and sat facing south, and were congratulated by civil and military officials as the king of Hanzhong. His son Liu Chan was established as the prince. He appointed Xu Jing as Taifu, and Fazheng as a minister. Zhuge Liang was a military advisor and the prime minister of military affairs. Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, and Huang Zhong were appointed as generals of the Five Tigers; Wei Yan was appointed as the prefect of Hanzhong. The rest of the proposed meritorious deeds.","So at last, after turning it down three times, as convention demands, Xuande agrees, and in late AD 219 he is crowned with full ritual, facing south, with the five directions marked on a specially created altar. He appoints his son Liu Shan as his heir, and Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Zilong, Ma Chao and Huang Zhong are named the Five Tiger Generals. Wei Yan is made governor of Hanzhong. Then Xuande writes to the emperor.","As there seemed no option, Liu Bei listened and complied. In the twenty-fourth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 219), in the seventh month, an altar was set up at Mianyang, nine square miles, which was set around with the proper flags and banners and symbols. In the presence of all his civil and military officers assembled according to their rank, and at the request of the two Ministers Xu Jing and Fa Zheng, Liu Bei received the head dress and seat of a prince. Then he took his seat, facing the south as a ruler should, and received the salutes and felicitations of all his officers as the Prince of Hanzhong. And his son Liu Shan was nominated his heir-apparent. Xu Jing was given the title of Royal Guardian; Fa Zheng that of Chair of the Secretariat. Zhuge Liang was reappointed Directing Instructor of the Forces, with the additional powers of control over the whole state policy. Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, and Ma Chao were the Five Tiger Generals. Wei Yan was made Governor of Hanzhong, and all the others who had assisted were given ranks and offices."
却說糜芳聞荊州有失，正無計可施。忽報公安守將傅士仁至，芳忙接入城，問其事故。士仁曰：“吾非不忠：勢危力困，不能支持。我今已降東吳，將軍亦不如早降。”芳曰：“吾等受漢中王厚恩，安忍背之？”士仁曰：“關公去日，痛恨吾二人；倘一日得勝而回，必無輕恕：公細察之。”芳曰：“吾兄弟久事漢中王，豈可一朝相背？”正猶豫間，忽報關公遣使至，接入廳上。使者曰：“關公軍中缺糧，特來南郡、公安二處取白米十萬石，令二將軍星夜去解軍前交割。如遲立斬。”芳大驚，顧謂傅士仁曰：“今荊州已被東吳所取，此糧怎得過去？”士仁厲聲曰：“不必多疑！”遂拔劍斬來使於堂上。芳驚曰：“公如何？”士仁曰：“關公此意，正要斬我二人。我等安可束手受死？公今不早降東吳，必被關公所殺。”正說間，忽報呂蒙引兵殺至城下。芳大驚，乃同傅士仁出城投降。蒙大喜，引見孫權。權重賞二人。安民已畢，大犒三軍。,"However, Mi Fang heard that Jingzhou had made a mistake, and she had nothing to do. Suddenly reporting to the public security guard Fu Shiren to arrive, Fang rushed into the city and asked him about the accident. Shiren said: ""I'm not unfaithful: I'm in danger and I can't support it. I've already surrendered to Eastern Wu, and it would be better for the general to surrender sooner."" Fang said, ""We have received the kindness of the King of Hanzhong, and will we bear it?"" Shiren Said: ""Guan Gong went to Japan and hated the two of us; if one day he came back victorious, there would be no forgiveness: Gong inspected him carefully."" Fang said, ""My brother has been with the King of Hanzhong for a long time, so how can we go against each other?"" He was hesitating. During the time, the official dispatched an envoy to the customs, and entered the hall. The messenger said: ""Guan Gong's army is short of food, so he came to Nanjun and Public Security to fetch 100,000 shi of white rice, and ordered the two generals Xingye to go and deliver the army before the army. Jingzhou has already been taken by Eastern Wu, how can I get this food?"" Shiren said sharply, ""Don't be suspicious!"" He drew his sword and slashed to the hall. Fang was startled and asked, ""How is your grandfather?"" Shiren said, ""Gongguan Guan intends to kill the two of us. I'll wait for Anke to die? If you don't come down to Eastern Wu early today, you will be killed by Duke Guan."" During this time, he suddenly reported that Lü Meng had led his troops to kill him under the city. Fang was shocked and went out of the city with Fu Shiren to surrender. Overjoyed, he introduced Sun Quan. The weight rewards both of them. Peace of mind has been completed, and the three armies will be rewarded.","In Nanjun, the governor Mi Fang has heard all the disastrous news of the fall of Jiangling. What he does not expect is that his old friend Fu Shiren would turn up and tell him personally of his defection. ‘I’m no traitor but I had no choice. The odds against me were too great. So I surrendered to Wu. I would urge you to consider doing the same.’ ‘I cannot betray the king of Hanzhong,’ Mi Fang says. ‘Guan Yu has hardly earned our undying loyalty,’ Fu Shiren says, recalling his whipping of them. ‘If he triumphs, then things will not go well for us – he is unlikely to forget or forgive.’ ‘But my brother and I, we have served the king for many years,’ says Mi Fang, ‘and I can’t just stop being loyal.’ At that moment a messenger arrives from Guan Yu demanding that the two cities provide huge quantities of rice for the army. Fu Shiren immediately kills the messenger, to the horrified astonishment of Mi Fang. ‘Why did you do that?’ he demands. ‘This is all a plot by Guan Yu to have us killed,’ exclaims Fu Shiren. Suddenly they are informed that Lü Meng is advancing on the city. Fear of this finally persuades Mi Fang, who surrenders the city to a delighted Lü Meng. Back in Xuchang, Cao Cao receives Sun Quan’s letter outlining the attack on Jingzhou and asking for Cao Cao to join the attack on Guan Yu.","The fall of Jingzhou put Mi Fang in a quandary; and before he could decide upon any course, his old colleague Fu Shiren came to see him. Fu Shiren was admitted, and when asked why he had come, he blurted out his business without beating about the bush. “I am faithful enough, but I got into difficulties and danger and could not hold on, so I have surrendered to Wu. And I advise you to do the same.” “You and I have both fed on the bounty of the Prince of Hanzhong, and I cannot understand how you can turn against him.” “Guan Yu went away hating both of us intensely; and even if he comes back victorious, I do not think he will forgive us. Just think it over.” “My brother and I have followed the Prince these many years, and I do not like leaving him like this.” Mi Fang hesitated. Before he could make up his mind, there came a messenger, saying, “The army in Fankou is short of grain, and I was sent to demand white rice for the soldiers. Nanjun and Gongan are to send ten thousand carts at once. Delay will be most severely punished.” This sudden demand was a shock to Mi Fang. “Where am I to get the rice?” said he despairingly to his friend and tempter. “Jingzhou is now in the hands of Wu.” “Do not dilly-dally,” said Fu Shiren. Thereupon he drew his sword and slew the messenger as he stood in the hall. “What have you done?” cried Mi Fang. “Guan Yu wanted to slay us two and has forced me to this. Are we to fold our hands and await death? Either you give in at once and go over to Wu, or you will be put to death by Guan Yu.” Just then they heard that Lu Meng's troops had actually reached the city wall. Mi Fang saw that nothing could save his life but desertion, so he went out with Fu Shiren and gave in his allegiance to Lu Meng, by whom he was led to Sun Quan. Sun Quan gave both of them presents, after which he proceeded to restore order and to reward his army for their services."

孟獲來到本寨，先伏刀斧手於帳下，差心腹人到董荼那、阿會喃寨中，只推孔明有使命至，將二人賺到大寨帳下，盡皆殺之，棄屍於澗。孟獲隨卽遣親信之人，守把隘口，自引軍出了夾山峪，要與馬岱交戰，却並不見一人；及問土人，皆言昨夜盡搬糧草復渡瀘水，歸大寨去了。獲再回洞中，與親弟孟優商議曰：“如今諸葛亮之虛實，吾已盡知，汝可去如此如此。”,"When Meng Huo came to this village, he put the swordsman and axe under the tent first, and sent his confidants to Dong Duna and Ahui Lanzhai. , abandoned the corpse in the stream. Meng Huo sent his cronies to guard the pass. Since he led his army out of Jiashanyu, he wanted to fight with Madai, but no one was seen. When he asked the natives, they all said that they had brought food and grass to cross the Lushui River last night and returned to the university. Zhai went. After returning to the cave again, he discussed with his younger brother Meng You and said, ""I know the truth of Zhuge Liang now, so you can go like this.""",Immediately Meng Huo returns to his own camp he has the two chieftains Dongtuna and Ahuinan murdered.,"But Meng Huo's first act on his return to his own camp was to send one of his people to Dongtu Na's and Ahui Nan's camps, and pretend to ask them to come to meet a messenger from Zhuge Liang. When the two generals came, Meng Huo ordered assassins who had been placed hidden to do away with the two leaders. Their corpses were thrown into a gully. Then he sent his friends to guard the most important strategic points, while he marched to fight a battle with Ma Dai. But when he got near the valley, he saw no signs of the enemy, and, on questioning an inhabitant, he heard that the Shu army, with all their stores, had recrossed the river and joined the main body in the northern bank. Meng Huo then returned to his own ravine and discussed matters with his brother, Meng You, saying, “I know all the details of the enemy's force from what I saw in their camp.” And Meng Huo gave his brother certain instructions, which Meng You at once began to carry out."
益州旣定，玄德欲將成都有名田宅，分賜諸官。趙雲諫曰：“益州人民，屢遭兵火，田宅皆空；今當歸還百姓，令安居復業，民心方服；不宜奪之為私賞也。”玄德大喜，從其言，使諸葛軍師定擬治國條例。刑法頗重。法正曰：“昔高袓約法三章，黎民皆感其德。願軍師寬刑省法，以慰民望。”孔明曰：“君知其一，未知其二：秦用法暴虐，萬民皆怨，故高袓以寬仁得之。今劉璋闇弱，德政不舉，威刑不肅；君臣之道，漸以陵替。寵之以位，位極則殘；順之以恩，恩竭則慢。所以致弊，實由於此。吾今威之以法，法行則知恩；限之以爵，爵加則知榮。恩榮並濟，上下有節。為治之道，於斯著矣。”法正拜服。自此軍民安堵。四十一州地面，分兵鎮撫，並皆平定。法正為蜀郡太守，凡平日一餐之德，睚眦之怨，無不報復。或告孔明曰：“孝直太橫，宜稍斥之。”孔明曰：“昔主公困守荊州，北畏曹操，東憚孫權，賴孝直為之輔翼，遂翻然翱翔，不可復制。今奈何禁止孝直，使不得少行其意耶？”因竟不問。法正聞之，亦自斂戢。,"When Yizhou was settled, Xuande wanted to distribute famous farm houses in Chengdu to various officials. Zhao Yun admonished: ""The people of Yizhou have been repeatedly attacked by weapons and fire, and their fields and houses are empty; now they should be returned to the people, so that they can live in peace and resume business, and the people's hearts will be satisfied; it is not appropriate to take them as private rewards."" Military divisions formulate regulations for governing the country. Criminal law is heavy. Fazheng said: ""In the past, Gao had made three chapters of the law, and the people of Li and the people all felt his virtue. I hope that the military teachers will lenient the punishment and save the law to comfort the people."" Kong Ming said: ""You know one thing, but you don't know the second: Qin's law is tyrannical, and all the people are resentful. Therefore, Gao Wei obtained it with generosity and benevolence. Now Liu Zhang is dark and weak, and his virtuous government is not upheld, and his power and punishment are not solemn; the way of monarch and ministers is gradually replaced by mausoleum. Slow. Therefore, it is because of this. I am proud of the law, and the law will know the kindness; limit it to the rank, and the rank will be honored. That's it."" Fa Zheng bowed. Since then, the military and civilians have been blocked. Forty-one states on the ground, divided troops to suppress, and all were pacified. Fazheng is the prefect of Shu County, and he will take revenge for all the virtues of a meal on a daily basis, and the grievances of the canthus. Or tell Kong Ming: ""Xiaozhi is too tyrannical and should be reprimanded a little."" Kong Ming said: ""In the past, the lord was trapped in Jingzhou, afraid of Cao Cao in the north, and Sun Quan in the east. , so you can't do what you want?"" Yin didn't ask. Fa Zheng heard it, and he restrained himself.","All those who have joined Xuande are rewarded with posts and titles and vast amounts of money, and treasures are sent to Guan Yu in Jingzhou. However, a plan to redistribute the land of the newly conquered territory to his followers is stoutly opposed by Zhao Zilong, who points out that the people have already suffered enough, and that generosity now will win support for the future. The land of Shu is now in Xuande’s control. The laws are overhauled; corrupt or over-rigorous local governors are held in check, and the land is settled. In the south in Wu, Sun Quan soon learns of Xuande’s triumphs and, needless to say, immediately thinks of trying to seize disputed Jingzhou.","Yiazhou being settled, Liu Bei next desired to confiscate the lands of the more famous of the inhabitants about Capital Chengdu and divide them among his officers. But here Zhao Yun and others dissuaded him, saying, “The sufferings of the people have been severe and losses great; it would be wise policy to let them settle down to their occupations as soon as possible. It would be wrong to reward our own people at the expense of these people.” Liu Bei listened and gave in with good grace. To Zhuge Liang, Liu Bei assigned the revision of the laws, the punishments to be made, on the whole, heavy. Then Fa Zheng spoke up, “The founder of the Hans, Liu Bang, drew up three chapters of law, and the people were all profoundly affected by his virtue. I would rather that the laws be few and liberal that people may be comforted.” Zhuge Liang replied, “You only look at one side. The laws of Qin 1 were fiercely cruel and provoked resentment among the people; it was fitting that the Supreme Ancestor should temper them with kindness. Under the weak administration of Liu Zhang, there has never been an efficient government, and there is a lack of respect for the law. The proper relationship between ruler and minister has been gradually obscured. Favor has been the means of rising, and the highest in rank have been the basest; kindness has been extended into license, and the most benefited have been the most contemptuous. And thereby have crept in many evils. Now I mean to inculcate respect for the dignity of the law, and kindness shall follow its attainment: there shall be moderation in conferring rank, but honor shall really follow on such promotion. In the mutual cooperation of kindness and honor and in proper distinction between superiors and inferiors lies the efficiency of a government.” Fa Zheng had no argument to oppose. In due time all became perfectly tranquil, and all the forty-one counties, with their respective garrisons, were peaceful and contented. As Governor of the Shu District, Fa Zheng earned much hatred, caring for no one but himself, and one person told of the complaints to Zhuge Liang, urging his dismissal. But Zhuge Liang referred to his meritorious services, saying, “When my lord was in Jingzhou, fearful of his enemy on the north and trembling lest he be attacked from the east, Fa Zheng was his sure support. In these prosperous days one can hardly begin to discipline him. Could we reasonably forbid him following somewhat his own way?” So no investigation was made, but Fa Zheng heard of the complaints and corrected his faults."

却說姜維在沓中，聽知魏兵大至，傳檄廖化、張翼、董厥提兵接應；一面自分兵列將以待之。忽報魏兵至。維引兵出迎。魏陣中為首大將乃天水太守王頎也。頎出馬大呼曰：“吾今大兵百萬，上將千員，分二十路而進，已到成都。汝不思早降，猶欲抗拒，何不知天命耶！”維大怒，挺鎗縱馬，直取王頎。戰不三合。頎大敗而走。姜維驅兵追殺至二十里，只聽得金鼓齊鳴：一枝兵擺開，旗上大書“隴西太守牽弘”字樣。維笑曰：“此等鼠輩，非吾敵手！”遂催兵追之。又趕到十里，却遇鄧艾領兵殺到。兩軍混戰。維抖擻精神，與艾戰有十餘合，不分勝負——後面鑼鼓又鳴。維急退時，後軍報說：“甘松諸寨，盡被金城太守楊欣燒毁了。”維大驚，急令副將虛立旗號，與鄧艾相拒。維自撤後軍，星夜來救甘松，正遇楊欣。欣不敢交戰，望山路而走。維隨後趕來。將至山巖下，巖上木石如雨，維不能前進。比及回到半路，蜀兵已被鄧艾殺敗。魏兵大隊而來，將姜維圍住。維引衆騎殺出重圍，奔入大寨堅守，以待救兵。忽然流星馬到，報說：“鍾會打破陽安關，守將蔣舒歸降，傅僉戰死，漢中已屬魏矣。樂城守將王含，漢城守將蔣斌，知漢中已失，亦開門而降。胡濟抵敵不住，逃回成都求援去了。”,"But they said that Jiang Wei was in the middle of the pile, and when he heard about the arrival of Wei's troops, he told Liao Hua, Zhang Yi, and Dong Jue to bring troops to join him; Suddenly reported the arrival of Wei soldiers. Wei led troops out to greet him. The chief general in the Wei formation was Wang Qi, the prefect of Tianshui. Qi got out of his horse and shouted: ""I have a million soldiers and a thousand generals, who are advancing in twenty routes, and have reached Chengdu. You don't want to come down early, but you still want to resist, why don't you know the destiny!"" Wei was furious and stood up. The spear steered the horse and took Wang Qi directly. The battle is not triad. Qi was defeated and left. Jiang Wei chased the soldiers for twenty li, only to hear the sound of golden drums: a soldier was spread out, and the words ""Longxi Prefect Qin Hong"" were written on the flag. Wei laughed and said, ""These rats are not my opponents!"" He urged his troops to pursue them. They rushed to Shili again, but met Deng Ai's troops and killed him. The two armies fought. Wei Dou Lei's spirit, and Ai Zhan have more than ten times, no winner or loser - gongs and drums sounded later. When Wei retreated urgently, the army reported, ""All the villages in Gansong have been burnt down by Yang Xin, the prefect of Jincheng."" Wei was shocked and ordered his lieutenant to set up a banner and reject Deng Ai. Wei withdraws his army, and Xingye comes to rescue Gan Song, but he is meeting Yang Xin. Xin did not dare to fight, and walked away looking at the mountain road. Wei then came. It will be down to the rock, and the rocks on the rock are like rain, and Wei can't move forward. By the time he returned halfway, the Shu soldiers had been defeated by Deng Ai. The Wei Brigade came and surrounded Jiang Wei. Wei led his cavalry to break out of the siege and rushed into Dazhai to hold on, waiting to be rescued. Suddenly a meteor arrived and reported: ""Zhonghui will break through Yang'an Pass, the guard Jiang Shu will surrender, Fu Yi died in battle, and Hanzhong is already in Wei. He opened the door and surrendered. Hu Ji was unable to withstand the enemy and fled back to Chengdu for help.""","The Wei armies led by Zhong Hui and Deng Ai advance without cessation, and place after place falls to them.","Jiang Wei at Tazhong heard of the invasion and wrote to his three generals—Zhang Yi, Liao Hua, and Dong Jue—to march against the enemy, while he prepared to repulse them if they came to his station. Soon they came, and he went out to encounter them. Their leader was Wang Qi, Governor of Tianshui. When near enough, Wang Qi shouted, “Our forces are numbered by millions, our generals by thousands. Two hundred thousand are marching against you, and Chengdu has already fallen. In spite of this you do not yield, wherefore it is evident you do not recognize the divine command.” Jiang Wei cut short this tirade by galloping out with his spear set. Wang Qi stood three bouts and then fled. Jiang Wei pursued, but seven miles away he met a cohort drawn up across the road. On the banner he read that the leader was Qian Hong, Governor of Longxi. “Dead rat! No match for me,” said Jiang Wei, smiling. Despising this antagonist, he led his army straight on, and the enemy fell back. He drove them before him for three more miles, and then came upon Deng Ai. A battle at once began, and the lust of battle held out in the breast of Jiang Wei for a score of bouts. But neither could overbear the other. Then in the Shu rear arose the clang of gongs and other signs of coming foes. Jiang Wei retired the way he had come, and presently one came to report: “The Governor of Jincheng, Yang Xin, has destroyed the camps at Gansong.” This was evil tidings. He bade his generals keep his own standard flying and hold Deng Ai while he went to try to recover the camps. On the way he met Yang Xin, but Yang Xin had no stomach for a fight with Jiang Wei and made for the hills. Jiang Wei followed till he came to a precipice down which the enemy were hurling boulders and logs of wood so that he could not pass. Jiang Wei turned to go back to the battle-field he had just left, but on the way he met the army of Wei, for Deng Ai had crushed his generals. Jiang Wei was surrounded, but presently got clear with a sudden rush and hastened to the great camp. Next came the news: “Zhong Hui has defeated the Yangping Pass; Jiang Shu has surrendered, while Fu Qian has fallen in the field. Hanzhong is now in the possession of Wei. Wang Han of Yuecheng and Jiang Bin of Hancheng has also opened their gates and yielded to the invaders at the loss of Hanzhong. Hu Ji has gone to Chengdu for help.”"
夏五月，丕感寒疾，醫治不痊，乃召中軍大將軍曹眞、鎮軍大將軍陳羣、撫軍大將軍司馬懿三人入寢宮。丕喚曹叡至，指謂曹眞等曰：“今朕病已沈重，不能復生。此子年幼，卿等三人，可善輔之，勿負朕心。”三人皆告曰：“陛下何出此言？臣等願竭力以事陛下，至千秋萬歲。”丕曰：“今年許昌城門無故自崩，乃不祥之兆，朕故自知必死也。”正言間，內侍奏征東大將軍曹休入宮問安。丕召入謂曰：“卿等皆國家柱石之臣也：若能同心輔朕之子，朕死亦瞑目矣！”言訖，墮淚而薨。時年四十歲，在位七年。於是曹眞、陳羣、司馬懿、曹休等，一面舉哀，一面擁立曹叡為大魏皇帝。諡父丕為文皇帝，諡母甄氏為文昭皇后。封鍾繇為太傅，曹眞為大將軍，曹休為大司馬，華歆為太尉，王朗為司徒，陳羣為司空，司馬懿為驃騎大將軍。其餘文武官僚，各各封贈。大赦天下。時雍、涼二州缺人守把，司馬懿上表乞守西涼等處。曹叡從之，遂封懿提督雍、涼等處兵馬。領詔去訖。,"In Xia Wuyue, Pi felt cold and could not heal, so he called Cao Zhen, the general of the Chinese army, Chen Qun, the general of the Zhen army, and Sima Yi, the general of the Fu army, into the palace. Pi called Cao Ruizhi, pointed at Cao Zhen and the others, and said, ""I am very ill today and cannot be resurrected. This son is young, and the three of you can help him well. Don't let me down."" All three said, """" Why did Your Majesty say this? The ministers and others are willing to do their best to serve His Majesty. Long live forever."" Pi said, ""This year, the gate of Xuchang collapsed for no reason. Cao Xiu, the general of the East, entered the palace to greet him. Pi called him in and said, ""Your Excellency and the others are all officials of the country's pillars: If I can help my son with one heart, I will die with my eyes closed!"" At the age of forty, he reigned for seven years. So Cao Zhen, Chen Qun, Sima Yi, Cao Xiu, etc., while expressing their condolences, supported Cao Rui as the emperor of Wei. His posthumous father Pi was Emperor Wen, and his posthumous mother Zhen was Empress Wenzhao. Zhong Yao was appointed Taifu, Cao Zhen was appointed General, Cao Xiu was appointed Chief Sima, Hua Xin was appointed Chief Lieutenant, Wang Lang was appointed Situ, Chen Qun was appointed Secretary Kong, and Sima Yi was appointed General of Hussars. The rest of the civil and military bureaucrats were given gifts. Amnesty the world. When Yong and Liang states were short of guards, Sima Yi went to the table and begged to guard Xiliang and other places. Cao Rui followed him, and then he sealed the troops and horses of the Admiral Yi, Yong, Liang, and others. Take the edict to the end.","Cao Pi has a son, Cao Rui, whose mother, Lady Zhen, the first wife and empress of Cao Pi, was killed by his father. This was wrought through a terrible plot contrived by a concubine, Lady Guo, who wanted to be empress. When Cao Pi fell dangerously ill and looked as if he might die, she claimed this was due to witchcraft practised by Lady Zhen. After the murder of his mother, Cao Rui was brought up by the new empress, as she had no children of her own. In the autumn of AD 226 Cao Pi falls seriously ill. Gathering the three most senior military commanders, Cao Zhen, Chen Qun and Sima Yi, to his deathbed, he instructs them to help the young Cao Rui to become emperor and to guide him as he grows into manhood. Having made sure of this, Cao Pi sheds a tear and dies. He is forty years old and has reigned for seven years. Cao Rui is enthroned as the new Wei emperor, and all the formal responsibilities are given to the loyal supporters of the dynasty. In particular Sima Yi asks to be made governor of Xiliang and the western regions, and his wish is granted.","They were Commander of the Central Army Cao Zhen, General Who Guards the West Chen Qun, and Grand Commander Sima Yi. When they had come, the Emperor's son was called, and the dying Emperor spoke thus: “I am grievously ill, and my end is near. I confide to your care and guidance this son of mine; you must support him out of good feeling for me.” “Why does Your Majesty talk thus?” said they. “We will do our utmost to serve you for a thousand autumns and a myriad years.” “No; I know that I am about to die,” said the Emperor. “The sudden fall of the gates of Xuchang this year was the omen, as I well knew.” Just then the attendants said that General Who Conquers the East Cao Xiu had come to ask after the Emperor's health. They were told to call Cao Xiu into the chamber. When he had entered, Cao Pi said to him, “You and these three are the pillars and cornerstones of the state. If you will only uphold my son, I can close my eyes in peace.” These were his last words. A flood of tears gushed forth, and Cao Pi sank back on the couch dead. He was forty years of age and had reigned seven years (AD 229). The four ministers raised the wailing for the dead and forthwith busied themselves with setting up Cao Rui as the Emperor of Great Wei. The late Emperor received the posthumous style of “Emperor Pi.” The late Empress, the consort who had suffered death, was styled “Empress Zhen.” Honors were distributed freely in celebration of the new reign. Zhong Yao was made Imperial Guardian; Cao Zhen, Regent Marshal; Cao Xiu, Minister of War; Hua Xin, Grand Commander; Wang Lang, Minister of the Interior; Chen Qun, Minister of Works; Sima Yi, Imperial Commander of the Flying Cavalry; and many others, conspicuous and obscure, were promoted. A general amnesty was declared throughout all the land. About this time a vacancy existed in the governorship of Xizhou and Xiliang. Sima Yi asked for the post and got it. He left for his new office as soon as he had received the appointment."
曹叡覽畢，大驚失色，急問羣臣。太尉華歆奏曰：“司馬懿上表乞守雍、涼，正為此也。先時太祖武皇帝嘗謂臣曰：‘司馬懿鷹視狼顧，不可付以兵權；久必為國家大禍。’今日反情已萌，可速誅之。”王朗奏曰：“司馬懿深明韜略，善曉兵機，素有大志；若不早除，久必為禍。”叡乃降旨，欲興兵御駕親征。忽班部中閃出大將軍曹眞奏曰：“不可：文皇帝託孤於臣等數人，是知司馬仲達無異志也。今事未知眞假，遽爾加兵，乃逼之反耳。或者蜀、吳奸細行反間之計，使我君臣自亂，彼却乘虛而擊，未可知也：陛下幸察之。”叡曰：“司馬懿若果謀反，將奈何？”眞曰：“如陛下心疑，可倣漢高偽遊雲夢之計。御駕幸安邑，司馬懿必然來迎；觀其動靜，就車前擒之，可也。”叡從之，遂命曹眞監國，親自領御林軍十萬，逕到安邑。,"When Cao Rui finished reading, he was shocked and asked the ministers urgently. Taiwei Hua Xin said: ""Sima Yi went to the table to beg for the protection of Yong and Liang, and this is precisely why. Earlier, Emperor Taizu Wu tried to call his ministers and said: 'Sima Yi's eagle looks at the wolf, and he can't give military power; he will be a great country for a long time. Disaster. 'Today's disobedience has been sprouted, so we can quickly execute it."" Wang Lang said: ""Sima Yi is well-versed in strategy, good at military tactics, and has great ambitions; if it is not eliminated early, it will be a disaster for a long time."" If you want to raise troops, drive your army, and go on a personal expedition. Cao Zhen, the great general, flashed in the troop of the sudden class, and said: ""No: Emperor Wen entrusted Gu Yu to the ministers and several others, knowing that Sima Zhongda had no intentions. Now that the matter is unknown, it is true that he has to add troops suddenly, but to force him to the opposite. Er. Or maybe the spy of Shu and Wu made a conspiracy against each other, causing my ruler and ministers to rebel, but he took advantage of it and attacked, I don't know: Your Majesty is fortunate to investigate him."" Rui said: ""If Sima Yi rebels, what will he do?"" Zhen said. : ""If Your Majesty is suspicious, you can imitate Han Gao's puppet wandering Yunmeng plan. If you are lucky enough to drive to Anyi, Sima Yi will surely come to meet him; watching his movement, he will be captured in front of the car."" Rui obeyed and ordered Cao Zhen to supervise the country and personally He led an army of 100,000 garrison troops to Anyi.","The fake proclamation creates great anxiety in the court, and adviser Hua Xin recalls that, ‘The great august emperor told me that Sima Yi has the eyes of an eagle and the stare of a wolf and that he would bring disaster upon the dynasty if he had the power.’ Debate rages. Some say, ‘Strike now.’ Others say, ‘Don’t believe a word of this. Sima Yi is not a rebel. This all smacks of a plot by the Shu or Wu to destabilize the empire.’ In the end it is agreed that Cao Rui will go on imperial inspection to Anyi, where Sima Yi will have to officially receive him. Cao Zhen says, ‘Watch how he behaves and if he shows signs of revolt, seize him then and there.’ So with a hundred thousand soldiers Cao Rui goes to Anyi.","At once he called a council of his officials to consider it. Hua Xin said, “That was the reason for his having requested the governorship of Xizhou and Xiliang. Now Emperor Cao, the Founder of Great Wei, frequently said to me that Sima Yi was ambitious and hungry, and should not be entrusted with military authority lest he harm the state. This is the first beginning of rebellion, and the author should be put to death.” Wang Lang said, “Sima Yi is a master of strategy and skilled in tactics. Moreover, he is ambitious and will cause mischief if he be allowed to live.” Wherefore Cao Rui wrote a command to raise an army, which he would lead to punish the minister. Suddenly Cao Zhen stood forth from the rank of military officers and said, “What you advise is impossible. His late Majesty, Emperor Pi, confided his son to the care of certain officers of state, of whom Sima Yi is one, wherefore it is certain that he felt sure of his probity. So far nothing is known certainly. If you hastily send an army to repress him, you may force him into rebellion. This may be but one of the base tricks of Shu or Wu to cause dissension in our midst so that occasion be found to further their own aims. As no one knows, I pray Your Majesty reflect before you do anything.” “Supposing Sima Yi really contemplates a revolt; what then?” said Cao Rui. Cao Zhen replied, “If Your Majesty suspects him, then do as did Liu Bang the Supreme Ancestor of Han when, under pretense of taking a trip on the Lake Yunmeng, he summoned his vassals—and seized Han Xin, who had been denounced. Go to Anyi; Sima Yi will assuredly come out to meet you, and his actions and demeanor may be watched closely. He can be arrested if needed.” Cao Rui changed his mind. Leaving Cao Zhen to regulate the affairs of state, the young Emperor went out with the Imperial Guards, to the number of one hundred thousand, and traveled to Anyi."

Huang Quan said: ""It is not too late. You will send people to report to the various passes, add troops to guard the guard, and do not allow it to be released. Jingzhou rides into the pass one by one."" Zhang followed his words and galloped to each pass in the starry night.","Alarmed by the discovery of a real plot and threat against him, Liu Zhang orders the passes to be strongly guarded. He commands that no one from Jingzhou should be allowed in or out. Meanwhile, Xuande has arrived at the Fu pass and invites the two commanders, Yang Huai and Gao Pei, to come and pay their respects as he departs.","Having thus learned of a real conspiracy to deprive him of his heritage, Liu Zhang assembled his officers and asked their advice.

The front was not far from the Kui Pass, and Xun immediately saw that the front was facing the mountains and rivers, a burst of murderous aura, and he rose into the sky; so he stopped his horse and looked back at the generals and said, ""There must be an ambush ahead, and the three armies cannot advance lightly."" Xun retreated more than ten li, In the open and broad terrain, they formed a formation to defend against the enemy troops; they sent sentry horses to visit. In return, there was no army stationed here, and Xun did not believe it, so he dismounted from his horse and climbed the mountain to look at it, and his murderous spirit resumed. No matter how closely Xun was inspected, the sentry horse reported that there was no one riding in front of him. Xun saw that the sun was about to sink in the west, his murderous aura grew, and he hesitated in his heart, causing his confidants to visit again. It was reported that there were eighty or ninety piles of rubble by the river, and no one was there. Xun was very suspicious, and asked the natives to ask. After a while, several people arrived. Xun asked, ""Who made the piles of rubble? How can there be murderous aura in the pile of rubble?"" The natives said, ""This is where the fish belly Pu. When Zhuge Liang entered the river, he drove his troops here, took the stones and formed a formation. on the sand; from then on there is often a cloud of air, rising from within.""","Drawing near to Baidi, Lu Xun is suddenly alarmed by strange apparitions. He halts the army and tries to work out what is happening. ‘I think there must be an ambush,’ he says and sends men to investigate. But they find nothing but eighty to ninety piles of rocks. But rising from them comes a strange mist. Questioning locals, Lu Xun is told that Kong Ming had these piles created, and ever since this strange mist has arisen.","There could be no question that this exploit brought tremendous glory to Lu Xun. Anxious to push his advantage as far as possible, he led his exultant army westward. But as he drew near to Kui Pass, he suddenly pulled up his horse, remarking that he saw an aura of death about the mountain side in front. “We may not yet advance farther; I suspect an ambush.” So they retreated three miles and camped in a wide open space. And the army was arrayed ready against any sudden attack. Meanwhile, scouts were sent out. They returned reporting no soldiers. Lu Xun doubted and went up to the summit of a hill whence he could see over the country. The aura was still visible to him, and so he dispatched other people to spy. But he received the same report; not a soldier, not a horse. Still, as the sun got lower and lower in the west, he saw the same appearance accentuated, and he began to feel grave doubts. He sent a confidant to look once more. This man came back, saying, “There is not a single soldier, but I have noticed on the river bank nearly a hundred heaps of boulders.” The Commander-in-Chief, still doubting, called in several of the natives and questioned them about the stones. “Who put them there? Why did they look so ghastly?” asked Lu Xun. “We do not know. This place is called Fishbelly Creek. When Zhuge Liang was going west into the Lands of Rivers, he came along here with a lot of soldiers and heaped up the boulders like that above the Sandy Rapid. We have seen vapors rising from the boulders; they seemed to come from inside them.”"

Jian invited into the back hall, and the ceremony was over; during the speech, Jian burst into tears. Qin asked why. Jian said: ""Sima Shi has dictatorial power and abolished the master, and the heaven and the earth have been reversed. Do you feel sad?"" Qin said: ""If the governor is willing to fight the thieves with justice, Qin is willing to sacrifice his life to help. Qin Zhongzi Wenshu, Xiaozi Ayang , there are ten thousand husbands who are not brave enough, often want to kill brother Sima, and report to Cao Shuang: Now I can make you a pioneer."" Jian was overjoyed, and at that time Fengjiu took an oath. The two falsely claimed that the Queen Mother had a secret edict, and ordered Huainan officers, soldiers and soldiers to enter Shouchun City, set up an altar in the west, slaughter the white horse and make an alliance, declare that Sima Shi was rebellious, and now follow the Queen Mother's secret edict, ordering all the troops and horses in Huainan to fight the thieves with justice . All are pleased. Jian picked up 60,000 soldiers and stationed them in Xiangcheng. Wen Qin led 20,000 soldiers outside as wandering soldiers, coming and going. Jian moved all the counties and ordered them to raise troops to help each other.","It is in Huainan, under the leadership of Wen Qin, governor of Yangzhou, and Guanqiu Jian, a famous general, that the rebellion breaks out.","It has been said that in the second year of Right Origin (AD 256) Guanqiu Jian, of the South of River Huai, General Who Guards the East, was commanding the forces in River Huai when he heard the news Sima Shi deposed Cao Fang. He was moved to great anger, and his eldest son, Guanqiu Dian, fomented his father's wrath, saying, “Father, you are chief of all this region. With this Sima Shi in such a position, the country is in danger, and you cannot sit still and look on.” “My son, you speak well,” replied Guanqiu Jian. Whereupon he requested Wen Qin, Imperial Protector of Yangzhou, to come and consult with him. This Wen Qin had been a client of Cao Shuang's, and he hastened at the call of the general. When he arrived, he was led into the private apartments, and, the salutations at an end, the two began to talk over the situation. Presently the host began to weep, and his visitor asked the cause of his tears. “Think you that this conduct of Sima Shi does not tear my heart? He has deposed the Emperor and now holds in his grip all authority of the state. Things are all upside down.” Wen Qin replied, “You are the chief of this region. If you are willing to play the part, you ought to take arms and slay this rebel. I will help you, regardless of consequences. My second son, Wen Yang, is a good warrior and a man of great valor, Moreover, he hates Sima Shi and wishes to avenge on the Sima brothers the death of Cao Shuang. He would make an excellent leader of the van.” Guanqiu Jian was delighted to get such ready and willing support, and the two poured a libation in pledge of mutual good faith. Then, pretending that they held an edict from the Empress Dowager, they summoned all the officers to Shouchun, where they built an altar on the west side and sacrificed a white horse, smearing their lips with its blood in token of their oath. They made this declaration: “Sima Shi is a rebel and devoid of rectitude. We have a secret edict commanding us to muster the forces of the South of River Huai and put down this rebellion.” Thus supported, Guanqiu Jian led sixty thousand troops to Xiangcheng, where he camped, while his fellow-conspirator Wen Qin took twenty thousand troops to the front to go to and fro lending help where it was needed.

Cao Ren led the army to set up the village by clipping the river, and crossed the grain and forage vehicles as a barrier. When Ma Chao heard this, he ordered the sergeants to each carry a bunch of grass and fire seeds, and led the army with Han Sui to kill them in front of the village. Cao soldiers could not resist the enemy, abandoned the fort and left. The car and the pontoon were all burned down. The Xiliang army was victorious and intercepted the Weihe River.

Asked about it, he was a native of Jingzhao and lived in seclusion in Zhongnan Mountain: his surname was Lou, his name was Zibo, and his Taoist name was ""Mengmei Jushi"". Cao treated him with courtesy and courtesy, Zibo said, ""The prime minister has wanted to set up camp across Wei for a long time, so why not build it now?"" Cao said, ""It is impossible to build a fort on a sandy soil. What good advice can the hermit give him?"" Zibo Said: ""The prime minister uses his troops like a god, doesn't he know the time of the sky? The cloudy clouds have been gathering for a few days, and the north wind will be together, and it will be freezing. After the wind rises, he will drive the soldiers to carry the soil and splash water. It is like the dawn of the sky, and the city of the soil has been established."" Cao Dawu, He rewarded Zibo generously, but Zibo did not accept it and left.","It is inconclusive, and by morning both sides have had enough and withdraw. Despite various plans and strategies of Cao Cao, in the end Ma Chao’s men take control of the mouth of the River Wei and Cao has to think defensively. He tries to have walls built, but the mud is too wet and they collapse. Then one night an old Daoist sage visits him and tells him to take note of the change in the weather. A bitingly cold wind is about to sweep down upon them, and this will mean that if they build the walls and wet them then the bitter cold will freeze them as solid as blocks of ice and make the walls firm.","The fight narrated in the last chapter lasted till morn when each side drew off, Ma Chao camping on the River Wei, whence he kept up harassing attacks both day and night. Cao Cao, also camped in the bed of the same river, began to construct three floating bridges out of his rafts and boats so as to facilitate communication with the south bank. Cao Ren established a camp on the river, which he barricaded with his carts and wagons. Ma Chao determined to destroy this camp, so his troops collected straw and each man marched with a bundle and took fire with him. Han Sui's forces were to fight. While one party attacked, the other party piled up the straw, which they lit, and soon there was a fierce fire all around. The defenders could do nothing against it, so they abandoned the camp and ran away. All the transport and bridges were destroyed. It was a great victory for the Xiliang army and gave them the command of the River Wei. Cao Cao was sad at the failure to make good his strong camp and fearful of his defenselessness. Then Xun You proposed a mud wall. So three thousand soldiers were set to build a mud rampart. The enemy seeing this harassed the workmen with perpetual attacks at different points so that the work went slowly. Beside, the soil was very sandy, and the wall would not stand but collapsed as fast as it was built. Cao Cao felt helpless. It was the ninth month of the sixteenth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (AD 211), and the fierce cold of winter was just coming on. Ominous clouds covered the sky day after day with never a break. One day as Cao Cao sat in his tent, very disheartened, a stranger was announced and was led in. He was an old man who said he had a suggestion to offer. He was tall, as delicate as a crane and as refined as a pine tree. He gave his name as Lou Zibo and said he came from Jingzhao. He was a recluse and a Taoist, his religious name being Plum-Blossom Dreamer. Cao Cao received him with great courtesy, and presently the venerable one began, saying, “O Prime Minister, you have long been striving to make a camp on the river. Now is your opportunity; why not begin?” “The soil is too sandy to stand,” said Cao Cao. “But if you have some other plan to propose, pray tell me what it is, O Hermit.” “You are more than human, O Prime Minister, in the art of war, and you surely know the times and seasons. It has been overcast for many days, and these clouds foretell a north wind and intense cold. When the wind begins to blow, you should hurry your army to carry up the earth and sprinkle it with water. By dawn your wall will be complete.” Cao Cao seized upon the suggestion. He offered his aged visitor a reward, but the venerable one would receive nothing."
却說孔明已將起程日期申報玄德，敎都會聚雒城。玄德與衆官商議：“今孔明、翼德分兩路取川，會於雒城，同入成都。水陸舟車，已於七月二十日起程，此時將及待到。今我等便可進兵。”黃忠曰：“張任每日來搦戰，見城中不出，彼軍懈怠，不做準備，今日夜間分兵劫寨，勝如白晝廝殺。”玄德從之，敎黃忠引兵取左，魏延引兵取右，玄德取中路。當夜二更，三路軍馬齊發。張任果然不做準備。漢軍擁入大寨，放起火來，烈燄騰空。蜀兵奔走，連夜直趕到雒城，城中兵接應入去。玄德還中路下寨；次日，引兵直到雒城，圍住攻打。張任按兵不出。攻到第四日，玄德自提一軍攻打西門，令黃忠、魏延在東門攻打，留南門北門放軍行走。原來南門一帶都是山路，北門有涪水：因此不圍。張任望見玄德在西門，騎馬往來，指揮打城，從辰至未，人馬漸漸力乏。張任敎吳蘭、雷銅二將引兵出北門，轉東門，敵黃忠、魏延；自己却引軍出南門，轉西門，單迎玄德。城內盡撥民兵上城，擂鼓助喊。,"However, it was said that Kong Ming had declared the departure date to Xuande, and taught the city to gather in Luocheng. Xuande discussed with the officials: ""Now Kongming and Yide will take the Sichuan by two routes, and they will meet in Luocheng and enter Chengdu together. The land and water boats have already left on July 20th, and we will be here in time. Now I will wait. The troops can be advanced."" Huang Zhong said: ""Zhang Ren comes to fight every day, and seeing that he is out of the city, his army is slack and unprepared. Today night, we divide our troops to rob the village, and the victory is like fighting in the daytime."" Lead troops to take the left, Wei Yan leads to the right, Xuande takes the middle. At the second watch that night, the Three Route Army was dispatched in unison. Zhang Ren really wasn't prepared. The Han army rushed into Dazhai and set fire to the sky. The soldiers of Shu ran and rushed to Luocheng overnight, and the soldiers in the city joined in. Xuande went back to the village in the middle; the next day, he led his troops to Luocheng, besieged and attacked. Zhang Ren pressed his troops out. On the fourth day of the attack, Xuande raised an army to attack the west gate, ordered Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to attack at the east gate, and left the south gate and the north gate to let the army walk. It turned out that the area around the south gate was all mountain roads, and the north gate had Fushui: so it was not surrounded. Zhang Renwang saw Xuande at the west gate, riding to and fro, commanding the city to fight. Zhang Renchi, Wu Lan and Lei Tong, led the troops out of the north gate, turned to the east gate, and faced Huang Zhong and Wei Yan; All the militiamen in the city went up to the city, beating drums and shouting.","Back at the siege of Luocheng, Xuande has heard that Kong Ming and Zhang Fei are on their way. He decides to take the city, having bored the defenders by never responding to the taunts that Zhang Ren has thrown at him day after day. The very next day they launch an assault, but Zhang Ren is able to mount a counter-attack through one of the city gates that Xuande has not attacked.","In the meantime, Zhuge Liang was preparing. Having decided upon the date of departure, he wrote to inform Liu Bei and he made Luocheng the rendezvous for the various armies. On receipt of this letter, Liu Bei assembled his officers and explained to them its purport. He bade them be ready to march on the twenty-second day of the seventh month. Both river and land forces were to set out the same day. But the fiery old man Huang Zhong was dissatisfied that there should be no local victory in the River Fu Pass. He said, “Day after day the enemy has come to challenge us, and day after day we have refused. They must have grown lax, and I propose a night raid on their camp. We shall catch them unprepared and shall score a victory.” Liu Bei agreed to try. He arranged for a night raid, Huang Zhong on the right, Wei Yan on the left, and the center force under his own command. They set out at the second watch and soon arrived. They found Zhang Ren's troops unprepared, rushed the camp, and set it on fire. The flames were very fierce, and the troops of Yiazhou fled in confusion and sought shelter in Luocheng. They were admitted. After pursuing them for some distance, Liu Bei made a camp. Next day Liu Bei marched right up to the city to besiege it. Zhang Ren kept quiet within and made no attempt to beat off the besiegers. On the fourth day Liu Bei led an attack on the west gate, sending Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to attack the east. The south gate was left to give the besieged a chance to escape if they would. Now, outside the south gate of Luocheng the country was rough and hilly, while the swift River Fu ran past the north. For this reason the city could not be surrounded. From the city wall, Zhang Ren watched the progress of the attack and saw Liu Bei the whole day indefatigably going to and fro directing the assault. He also saw that as the sun dropped toward the west, the attacking force showed signs of weariness. Wherefore he sent his two generals, Wu Lan and Lei Tong, out of the city by the north gate with orders to make their way around and attack Huang Zhong and Wei Yan. Zhang Ren said he himself would go out by the south gate and steal round to attack Liu Bei. Lest the withdrawal of troops from the ramparts should discover his plans, he sent the populace up on the walls to make a show and bade them shout loudly to reinforce the rolling of the drums."
却說諸葛恪引兵至東興，收兵賞勞了畢，乃聚諸將曰：“司馬昭兵敗北歸，正好乘勢進取中原。”遂一面遣人齎書入蜀，求姜維進兵攻其北，許以平分天下；一面起大兵二十萬，來伐中原。臨行時，忽見一道白氣，從地而起，遮斷三軍，對面不見。蔣延曰：“此氣乃白虹也，主喪兵之兆。太傅只可回朝，不可伐魏。”恪大怒曰：“汝安敢出不利之言，以慢吾軍心！”叱武士斬之。衆皆告免，恪乃貶蔣延為庶人。仍催兵前進。丁奉曰：“魏以新城為總隘口，若先取得此城，司馬昭破膽矣。”恪大喜，卽趲兵直至新城。守城牙門將軍張特，見吳兵大至，閉門堅守，恪令兵四面圍定。早有流星馬報入洛陽。主簿虞松告司馬師曰：“今諸葛恪困新城，且未可與戰：吳兵遠來，人多糧少，糧盡自走矣。待其將走，然後擊之，必得全勝——但恐蜀兵犯境，不可不防。”師然其言，遂令司馬昭引一軍助郭淮防姜維；毋丘儉、胡遵拒住吳兵。,"However, he said that Zhuge Ke led his troops to Dongxing, and after collecting the troops and rewarding the labor, he gathered his generals and said, ""Sima Zhao's army has been defeated and returned to the north, just to take advantage of the situation to enter the Central Plains."" , promised to divide the world equally; on the one hand, two hundred thousand soldiers were raised to attack the Central Plains. When they were leaving, they suddenly saw a white gas rising from the ground, blocking the three armies, and they were not seen on the opposite side. Jiang Yan said: ""This qi is a white rainbow, and it is an omen of the death of the soldiers. Taifu can only return to the dynasty, not to attack Wei."" Ke was furious and said, ""You dare to say unfavorable words to slow down my army!"" Samurai beheaded. Everyone was excused, and Ke Nai demoted Jiang Yan as a commoner. Still pushing troops forward. Ding Feng said: ""Wei takes the new city as the general pass. If we take this city first, Sima Zhao will be stunned."" Zhang Te, the general guarding the city's Yamen, saw the arrival of Wu's troops, and he held the door behind closed doors and ordered his troops to surround him on all sides. Meteor horses have already reported to Luoyang. The chief clerk Yu Song told Sima Shi: ""Now Zhuge Ke is trapped in the new city, and he can't fight: Wu's troops are coming from afar, and there are many people and little food, and they will go away when they run out of food. Wait for him to leave, and then attack him, and he will be completely victorious— - But we must guard against the fear of Shu soldiers invading the territory."" The teacher said this, and ordered Sima Zhao to lead an army to help Guo Huai defend Jiang Wei; Guanqiu Jian and Hu Zun refused to hold Wu soldiers.",The Wu army fail to capture anywhere and when they besiege Xincheng they are outwitted by its governor.,"Zhuge Ke marched his army to Dongxing, and he made great feastings and distribution of rewards in celebration of victory. Then he said to his leaders, “Sima Zhao has suffered a defeat and retreated to the north. It is time to take the Middle Land.” So he told his officers that this was his intention, and also sent away letters to Shu to engage the aid of Jiang Wei, promising that the empire should be divided between them when they had taken it. An army of two hundred thousand troops was told off to invade the Middle Land. Just as it was starting, a stream of white vapor was seen emerging from the earth, and as it spread it gradually enveloped the whole army so that people could not see each other. “It is a white rainbow,” said Jiang Yan, “and it bodes ill to the army. I advise you, O Commander, to return and not march against Wei.” “How dare you utter such ill-omened words and blunt the keenness of my army?” cried Zhuge Ke, angrily. He bade the lictors take Jiang Yan out and put him to death. But Jiang Yan's colleagues interceded for him, and he was spared, but he was stripped of all rank. Orders were issued to march quickly. Then Ding Feng offered a suggestion, saying, “Wei's chief defense is Xincheng; it would be a severe blow to Sima Shi to capture it.” Zhuge Ke welcomed this suggestion and gave orders to march on Xincheng. They came up and found the city gates closed, wherefore they began to besiege the city. The commander in the city, Zhang Te, saw the legions of Wu at the walls, held a strict defense. A hasty messenger was sent to Luoyang, and First Secretary Yu Song told the Prime Minister, Sima Shi. Yu Song said, “Zhuge Ke is laying siege to Xincheng; the city should not try to repulse the attack, but simply hold out as long as possible. When the besiegers have exhausted their provisions, they will be compelled to retire. As they retreat, we can smite them. However, it is necessary to provide against any invasion from Shu.” Accordingly Sima Zhao was sent to reinforce Guo Huai so as to keep off Jiang Wei, while Guanqiu Jian and Hu Zun kept the army of Wu at bay."

姜維聽得此信，忻然上表，再議出師伐魏。時蜀漢景耀元年冬，大將軍姜維，以廖化、張翼為先鋒，王含、蔣斌為左軍，蔣舒、傅僉為右軍，胡濟為合後，維與夏侯霸總中軍，共起蜀兵二十萬，拜辭後主，逕到漢中，與夏侯霸商議，當先攻取何地。霸曰：“祁山乃用武之地，可以進兵，故丞相昔日六出祁山。因他處不可出也。”維從其言，遂令三軍並望祁山進發，至谷口下寨。時鄧艾正在祁山寨中，整點隴右之兵。忽流星馬到，報說蜀兵見下三寨於谷口。艾聽知，遂登高看了，回寨生帳，大喜曰：“不出吾之所料也！”原來鄧艾先度了地脈，故留蜀兵下寨之地；地中自祁山寨直至蜀寨，早挖了地道，待蜀兵至時，於中取事。此時姜維至谷口分作三寨，地道正在左寨之中，乃王含、蔣斌下寨之處。鄧艾喚子鄧忠，與師纂各引一萬兵，為左右衝擊；却喚副將鄭倫，引五百掘子軍，於當夜二更，逕從地道直至左營，從帳後地下擁出。,"When Jiang Wei heard the letter, he made a statement and then discussed sending a teacher to attack Wei. In the winter of the first year of Jingyao's reign in Shu Han, Jiang Wei, the general, led Liao Hua and Zhang Yi as the vanguard, Wang Han and Jiang Bin as the left army, Jiang Shu and Fu Yi as the right army, Hu Ji as the queen, Wei and Xiahou Ba as the leader. The central army, with a total of 200,000 soldiers from Shu, said goodbye to the later master and went straight to Hanzhong to discuss with Xiahou Ba, where to attack first. Ba said: ""Qishan is a place for military use and can be used to advance troops, so the prime minister used to go out of Qishan six times. Because he couldn't go out from other places."" At that time, Deng Ai was in Qi Shanzhai, and the soldiers of Longyou were on the hour. Suddenly Meteor arrived and reported that Shu soldiers had seen the next three villages at Taniguchi. When Ai heard about it, he climbed up and looked at it. He returned to the village to build his tent. He exclaimed with great joy, ""It's not what I expected!"" , I dug a tunnel early, and when the soldiers of Shu arrived, they took matters into the middle. At this time, Jiang Wei and Taniguchi were divided into three villages, and the tunnel was in the left village, where Wang Han and Jiang Bin descended. Deng Ai called his son Deng Zhong, and Shi Zuan each led 10,000 troops to attack from the left and right; but he called his lieutenant Zheng Lun, led 500 digging troops, and on the second watch of the night, they walked from the tunnel to Zuoying, from the back of the tent to the underground. hold out.","Jiang Wei hears of all this and of course immediately proposes an invasion of Wei! Predictably he advances through the Qishan hills and sets up camp on the plains. Deng Ai is delighted. He is expecting this and has left the plains for Jiang Wei to occupy, but has dug a long tunnel under the area where the enemy camp is set.","On the arrival of these letters, Jiang Wei hastened to seek permission to attempt another expedition. Consent being given, a large army marched into Hanzhong in the winter of the first year of Wonderful Sight (AD 258). Liao Hua and Zhang Yi were appointed Leaders of the Van, Wang Han and Jiang Bin as Commanders of the Left, and Jiang Shu and Fu Qian as Commanders of the Right, while Jiang Wei and Xiahou Ba led the main column. Asked what he thought should be the first objective, Xiahou Ba replied, “There is no better fighting ground than Qishan, as the tactics of the late Prime Minister made evident, and it is the only good exit.” So thither three armies marched, and they made three camps at the entrance to the valley. At this time Deng Ai had a training camp at Qishan drilling the Longyou troops. The scouts told him of the coming of the western army, and he ascended a hill to see and verify their reports. He seemed pleased when he saw the enemy camp. “They have just done as I foresaw,” said Deng Ai. Now Deng Ai had carefully considered the “pulse” of the countryside, and so had not interfered with the Shu army when it was on the march or settling into camp. Moreover, he had excavated a subterranean road to the spot where he had thought they would halt, and their left camp had been pitched just on it. Wang Han and Jiang Bin commanded in that camp. Deng Ai called his son Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan and sent them with ten thousand troops each to attack the left camp, one on each flank. Then he sent Zheng Lun and five hundred troops into the underground road, which opened in rear of the camp of Wang Han and Jiang Bin. As the newly made camp was not yet well fortified, Wang Han and Jiang Bin exercised great care and kept their troops under arms all night, watching with vigilance."

馬超看畢，卽時揮涕回書，發使者先回，隨後便起西涼軍馬。正欲進發，忽西涼太守韓遂，使人請馬超往見。超至遂府，遂將出曹操書示之。內云：“若將馬超擒赴許都，卽封汝為西涼侯。”超拜伏於地曰：“請叔父就縳俺兄弟二人，解赴許昌，免叔父戈戟之勞。”韓遂扶起曰：“吾與汝父結為兄弟，安忍害汝？汝若興兵，吾當相助。”馬超拜謝。韓遂便將操使者推出斬之，乃點手下八部軍馬，一同進發。那八部？乃侯選、程銀、李堪、張橫、梁興、成宜、馬玩、楊秋也。八將隨着韓遂，合馬超手下龐德、馬岱共起二十萬大兵，殺奔長安來。長安郡守鍾繇，飛報曹操；一面引軍拒敵，布陣於野。西涼州前部先鋒馬岱，引軍一萬五千，浩浩蕩蕩，漫山遍野而來。鍾繇出馬答話。岱使寶刀一口，與繇交戰。不一合，繇大敗奔走。岱提刀趕來。馬超、韓遂引大軍都到，圍住長安。鍾繇上城守護。長安乃西漢建都之處，城郭堅固，壕塹險深，急切攻打不下。一連圍了十日，不能攻破。龐德進計曰：“長安城中土硬水鹻，甚不堪食，更兼無柴。今圍十日，軍民饑荒，不如暫且收軍。只須如此如此，長安唾手可得。”馬超曰：“此計大妙！”卽時差“令”字旗傳於各部，盡敎退軍，馬超親自斷後。各部軍馬漸漸退去。鍾繇次日登城看時，軍皆退了，只恐有計。令人哨探，果然遠去，方纔放心；縱令軍民出城打柴取水，大開城門，放人出入。至第五日，人報馬超兵又到，軍民競奔入城，鍾繇仍復閉城堅守。,"After Ma Chao finished reading, he waved his tears back to the book, and sent the messenger to return first, and then the horses of the Xiliang army began to rise. Just as he was about to set out, Han Sui, the prefect of Western Liang, sent someone to invite Ma Chao to meet him. When he reached Suifu, he sent Cao Cao's book to show him. Nei Yun: ""If Ma Chao is taken to Xudu, you will be named Marquis of Xiliang."" Chao bowed to the ground and said, ""Please uncle, tie my two brothers, and go to Xuchang to save my uncle's trouble."" Han Sui lifted him up and said, ""I have become brothers with your father. How can I bear to harm you? If you want to raise an army, I will help you."" Ma Chao thanked him. Han Sui pushed the messenger out and beheaded him, and ordered his eight troops to set off together. The eight? They were Hou Xuan, Cheng Yin, Li Kan, Zhang Heng, Liang Xing, Cheng Yi, Ma Wan, and Yang Qiu. The eight generals followed Han Sui, and together with Ma Chao's subordinates Pang De and Ma Dai, a total of 200,000 soldiers came to Chang'an. Chang'an County was in charge of Zhong Yao, and reported to Cao Cao; Ma Dai, a pioneer in the front of Xiliang Prefecture, led an army of 15,000 troops, coming from all over the mountains and plains. Zhong Yao went out to answer. Dai used a sword to fight Yao. If they do not unite, Yao will be defeated and run away. Dai came with a knife. Ma Chao and Han Sui led a large army to surround Chang'an. Zhong Yao went to the city to guard. Chang'an was the capital of the Western Han Dynasty. The city was strong, and the trenches were deep and dangerous, so it could not be attacked urgently. After ten days of siege, they could not break through. Pang De entered into the plan and said: ""The soil in Chang'an is hard and the water is unbearable, and there is no firewood. Today's ten-day siege, the army and the people are famined, it is better to withdraw the army for the time being. As long as this is the case, Chang'an is within easy reach."" Ma Chao said: ""This plan is great. !"" The flag with the word ""order"" in the jet lag was passed on to all the ministries, and all the troops were ordered to retreat, and Ma Chao personally broke the back. The military horses gradually retreated. When Zhong Yao went to the city the next day to see, all the troops had retreated, and there was only a plan. It was a sentinel, but it was really far away, and I was relieved; even if the military and civilians were sent out of the city to collect firewood and water, the city gates were opened wide, and people were let in and out. On the fifth day, people reported that Ma Chaobing had arrived again, and the army and the people rushed into the city, but Zhong Yao still closed the city and stood firm.","When news reaches Ma Chao of the death of his father and brothers, he vows revenge, and at just that moment Xuande’s message reaches him. Without hesitating, Ma Chao responds, saying he will attack Cao Cao from the west, as the letter suggests, if Xuande will attack from the south. After gathering support from others in the region, over two hundred thousand tribal warriors march towards the capital Chang’an. The governor Zhong Yao urgently sends news of this attack to Cao Cao. Then, taking his own troops, he advances to meet the enemy. The first engagement ends in defeat for the governor, who flees back into the safety of Chang’an, while Ma Chao and his men lay siege to the ancient capital. Ten days of siege go by without success for Ma Chao. It is then that Pang De, one of Ma Chao’s commanders, suggests a ruse. ‘Things will be pretty desperate inside the city now. Why don’t we retreat so that the people can come out and refurbish their supplies,. Many will come and go and … well. I have this idea.’ Ma Chao listens and agrees heartily with what he hears. So the besiegers lift the siege and melt away into the distant hills. As soon as Zhong Yao is certain they are far off, he opens the gates and, sure enough, people pour out – and pour back in again – plus some people who have never been in the city in the first place! This goes on for five days until the enemy forces are sighted moving back down to the attack, and the gates are hastily closed.","Wiping his tears, Ma Chao wrote a reply which was returned by the bearer. The Xiliang army was then mustered; horse and foot were assembled. Just before the day that had been fixed for the start, the Imperial Protector of Xizhou, Han Sui, sent for Ma Chao, to whom he showed a letter from Cao Cao promising the Lordship of Xiliang as a reward for sending Ma Chao a prisoner to the capital. “Bind us both, Uncle, and send us thither; you need not move a single spear,” said the younger man prostrating himself. But Han Sui raised him, saying, “Your father and I were sworn brothers; think you I would harm you? Rather will I help if you are going to fight.” Ma Chao expressed his gratitude. The unhappy bearer of Cao Cao's letter was dragged forth and beheaded. This done, the two took count of their armies. Han Sui had eight divisions under eight commanders—Yang Qiu, Cheng Yin, Hou Xuan, Liang Xing, Cheng Yi, Li Kan, Ma Wan, and Zhang Heng—all to be relied upon to follow Han Sui. Ma Chao had two leaders, Pang De and Ma Dai. The total force was two hundred thousand troops with which the commanders march to Changan. The Governor of that city was Zhong Yao. As soon as he heard what was afoot, he sent a fleet messenger to Cao Cao and prepared for defense. He led his force out into the open plain and arrayed it for battle. Ma Dai, with fifteen thousand, came on first, pouring over the countryside like a flood. Zhong Yao would parley with him, but Ma Dai came forward, sword in hand, to attack. However, the defender did not take the challenge but turned and fled. Ma Dai followed in pursuit. Soon the main body of the invaders arrived, and they surrounded the city, which Zhong Yao set about defending. Changan had been the capital of the Western Hans and so was well fortified with a solid wall and a deep moat, safe against the most terrific attacks. The new armies besieged the city for ten days without success. Then Pang De proposed a plan. Said he, “Since the land about the city is barren and the water bitter, the people must have communication with the country around in order to live. Further they have no fuel. Ten days of siege must have exhausted the supplies in the city, wherefore if we relax for a time—well, you will see. We shall capture the city without moving a finger.” “Your plan seems excellent,” said Ma Chao, when he heard what it was. Thereupon they sent orders to each division to retire, and Ma Chao covered the retreat. Next day Zhong Yao went up on the walls to look around and saw that the besiegers had gone. However, suspecting a ruse, he sent out spies, who returned to say the soldiers had really moved away to a distance. Wherefore he felt much relieved and allowed both soldiers and people to go out into the country to cut the much needed firewood and bring in water. The city gates, thrown wide open, were thronged with those passing in and out. This continued for five days, and then they heard that Ma Chao's army was returning. A panic ensued. The people rushed into the city, and the gates were once more barred."

正言間，忽見師入，皇后大驚。師按劍謂芳曰：“臣父立陛下為君，功德不在周公之下；臣事陛下，亦與伊尹何別乎？今反以恩為讎，以功為過，欲與二三小臣，謀害臣兄弟，何也？”芳曰：“朕無此心。”師袖中取出汗衫，擲之於地曰：“此誰人所作耶？”芳魂飛天外，魄散九霄，戰慄而答曰：“此皆為他人所逼故也。朕豈敢興此心？”師曰：“妄誣大臣造反，當加何罪？”芳跪告曰：“朕合有罪，望大將軍恕之！”師曰：“陛下請起：國法未可廢也。”乃指張皇后曰：“此是張緝之女，理當除之！”芳大哭求免，師不從，叱左右將張后捉出，至東華門內，用白練絞死。後人有詩曰：,"In the middle of the sentence, suddenly seeing the teacher entering, the queen was shocked. The teacher called Fang on the sword and said: ""My father has established your majesty as your ruler, and your merits and virtues are not under Zhou Gong; how is it different from Yi Yin when you serve your majesty? Chen, why do you want to murder your brother?"" Fang said, ""I don't have this intention."" The teacher took out his shirt from his sleeve and threw it on the ground, saying, ""Who did this?"" He replied, ""It's all forced by others. How could I dare to take this into consideration?"" The master said, ""What crime should I add to falsely accusing the minister of rebelling?"" Fang knelt down and said, ""I am guilty, and I hope the general will forgive me. It!"" The teacher said, ""Your Majesty, please wake up: the laws of the state cannot be abolished."" This refers to Empress Zhang, who said, ""This is Zhang Ji's daughter, so she should be eliminated!"" Fang cried and begged for forgiveness. After that, he was caught and taken to Donghua Gate, where he was hanged with Bai Lian. A later poem says:","The three men and their entire clans are executed, and in his fury Sima Shi forces entry into the palace and heads straight for the emperor’s quarters. Throwing the dragon-phoenix shirt on the floor, he erupts: ‘Why have you turned against us? We’ve done nothing but serve you. Why do you see love as opposition; mistake service for failure?’ Emperor Cao Fang tries to pass blame off on others, but the blood-soaked shirt cries out his offence. With no other option, the emperor confesses his role in the plot. Turning to face the empress, Sima Shi says, ‘You’re Zhang Qi’s daughter and therefore you must face the consequences.’ His soldiers drag her away, while the emperor screams for mercy – but to no avail. She is strangled. As a poet has commented:","Sima Shi strode in, sword in hand. “My father placed Your Majesty on the throne, a service no less worthy than that of Duke Zhou; I have served Your Majesty as Yi Yin served his master. Now is kindness met by enmity and service regarded as a fault. Your Majesty has plotted with two or three insignificant officials to slay me and my brother. Why is this?” “I had no such intention,” said Cao Fang. In reply Sima Shi drew the garment from his sleeve and threw it on the ground. “Who did this?” Cao Fang was overwhelmed; his soul flew beyond the skies, his spirit lied to the ninth heaven. Shaking with fear, he said, “I was forced into it. How could I think of such a thing?” “To slander ministers by charging them with rebellion is an aggravated crime,” said Sima Shi. Cao Fang knelt at his feet, saying, “Yes; I am guilty; forgive me.” “I beg Your Majesty to rise; the laws must be respected.” Pointing to Empress Zhang, Sima Shi said, “She is of the Zhang house and must die.” “Spare her,” cried Cao Fang, weeping bitterly. But Sima Shi was obdurate. He bade the lictors lead her away, and she was strangled with a white silk cord at the palace gate. Now I recall another year; and lo!"

却說蜀兵前隊哨至陳倉，回報孔明，說：“陳倉口已築起一城，內有大將郝昭守把，深溝高壘，遍排鹿角，十分謹嚴；不如棄了此城，從太白嶺鳥道出祁山甚便。”孔明曰：“陳倉正北是街亭；必得此城，方可進兵。”命魏延引兵到城下，四面攻之。連日不能破。魏延復來告孔明，說城難打。孔明大怒，欲斬魏延。忽帳下一人告曰：“某雖無才，隨丞相多年，未嘗報効。願去陳倉城中，說郝昭來降，不用張弓隻箭。”衆視之，乃部曲靳詳也。孔明曰：“汝用何言以說之？”詳曰：“郝昭與某，同是隴西人氏，自幼交契。某今到彼，以利害說之，必來降矣。”孔明卽令前去。靳詳驟馬，逕到城下叫曰：“郝伯道故人靳詳來見。”城上人報知郝昭。昭令開門放入，登城相見。昭問曰：“故人因何到此？”詳曰：“吾在西蜀孔明帳下，參贊軍機，待以上賓之禮。特令某來見公，有言相告。”昭勃然變色曰：“諸葛亮乃我國之讎敵也！吾事魏，汝事蜀：各事其主！昔時為昆仲，今時為讎敵！汝再不必多言，便請出城！”靳詳又欲開言，郝昭已出敵樓上了。魏軍急催上馬，趕出城外。詳回頭視之，見昭倚定護心木欄杆。詳勒馬以鞭指之曰：“伯道賢弟，何太情薄耶？”昭曰：“魏國法度，兄所知也。吾受國恩，但有死而已。兄不必下說詞。早回見諸葛亮，敎快來攻城：吾不懼也！”詳回告孔明曰：“郝昭未等某開言，便先阻却。”孔明曰：“汝可再去見他，以利害說之。”詳又到城下，請郝昭相見。昭出到敵樓上。詳勒馬高叫曰：“伯道賢弟，聽吾忠言：汝據守一孤城，怎拒數十萬之衆？今不早降，後悔無及！且不順大漢而事奸魏，抑何不知天命，不辨淸濁乎？願伯道思之。”郝昭大怒，拈弓搭箭，指靳詳而喝曰：“吾前言已定，汝不必再言！可速退——吾不射汝！”,"However, he said that the frontier of the Shu soldiers reached Chencang and reported back to Kong Ming, saying: ""Chencangkou has built a city, with the great general Hao Zhao guarding it, with deep trenches and high fortresses, and rows of antlers. Bailing Bird Road is very easy to get out of Qishan."" Kong Ming said: ""To the north of Chencang is Jieting; you must get this city before you can advance troops."" He ordered Wei Yan to lead his troops to the city and attack it from all sides. It can't be broken for days. Wei Yanfu came to sue Kong Ming, saying that the city was difficult to attack. Kong Ming was furious and wanted to kill Wei Yan. Suddenly, a person in the tent reported, ""Although a certain person has no talent, he has been with the Prime Minister for many years, but he has yet to repay him. I would like to go to Chencang City and say that Hao Zhao is coming to surrender, and he does not need to use a bow but an arrow."" Kong Ming said: ""What words do you use to talk about it?"" He said in detail: ""Hao Zhao and a certain person, both from Longxi, have made a contract since childhood. When a certain person is there now, he will talk about it in terms of profit and harm, and he will come down."" Kong Ming Swastika to go. Jin Xiang jumped on his horse and went down to the city to call, ""Hao Bodao's old friend Jin Xiang is here to see you."" The people in the city reported to Hao Zhao. Zhaoling opened the door, put it in, and met at the city. Zhao asked, ""Why did the old man come here?"" He said in detail: ""I am under the tent of Kongming in Xishu, the counselor of the military plane, and I am waiting for the courtesy of the above guests. I have specially ordered a certain person to come to see the prince and have something to tell me."" Zhao suddenly changed color and said: ""Zhuge Liang is the enemy of our country! I am in Wei, and you are in Shu: each has its own master! In the past he was Kunzhong, but now he is the enemy! You don't need to say more, please leave the city!"" Jin Xiang wants to speak again , Hao Zhao has left the enemy building. Wei Jun hurriedly mounted his horse and drove out of the city. Looking back in detail, he saw Zhao leaning on the heart-protecting wooden railing. Xing Lema pointed at him with the whip and said, ""Brother Bo Dao, why is your love so merciless?"" Zhao said, ""The law of the Wei State is known to my brother. I have received the favor of the state, but I will die. Brother does not need to say anything. See Zhuge Liang early, and tell me to attack the city: I'm not afraid!"" He told Kong Ming in detail, ""Hao Zhao did not wait for someone to speak, so he blocked him first."" Kong Ming said, ""You can go to see him again, Let’s talk about the benefits and harms.” Xiang went to the castle again and asked Hao Zhao to meet him. Zhao went out to the enemy's upstairs. Xing Lema shouted, ""Brother Bo Dao, listen to my loyal words: You are defending a lonely city, how can you reject hundreds of thousands of people? If you don't come down early this morning, you will regret it! And if you don't obey the big Han and act against Wei, why don't you know? Heaven's mandate, can't you tell the difference? May Bodao think about it."" Hao Zhao was furious, took a bow and an arrow, pointed at Jin Xiang and shouted: ""My preamble has been decided, you don't have to say it again! You can retreat quickly - I don't Shoot you!""","When the Shu army arrive outside Chencang, they find it stoutly fortified and commanded by Hao Zhao. Having failed in an outright attack, Kong Ming is in despair, but Jin Xiang, one of his commanders, suggests a more subtle approach. He is a friend of Hao Zhao and offers to go and discuss surrender with him. His first visit is a failure, as Hao Zhao refuses to discuss anything with him and drives him from the city. His second attempt doesn’t even get him inside the city, and this time he has to flee as Hao Zhao takes aim from the city wall with a bow and arrow.","The first companies of the army of Shu sent out their scouts as far as Chencang. They came back and reported: “A rampart has been built and behind it is a general named Hao Zhao in command. The rampart is very strong and is further defended by thorny barriers. Instead of taking Chencang, which seems difficult, it would be easier to go out to Qishan by the Taibo Mountains, where is a practicable, though winding, road.” But Zhuge Liang said, “Due north of Chencang is Jieting, so that I must get this city in order to advance.” Wei Yan was sent to surround Chencang and take it. He went, but days passed without success. Therefore he returned and told his chief the place was impregnable. In his anger, Zhuge Liang was going to put Wei Yan to death, but an officer stepped forth and said, “I have followed the Prime Minister for a long time, but have not achieved worthy service. Now I want to go to Chencang and persuade Hao Zhao to yield; thus, our army does not need to use a single bow or arrow.” Others turned their attention to Counselor Jin Xiang. “How do you think you will persuade him?” said Zhuge Liang. “What will you say?” “Hao Zhao and I are both from Xizhou and pledged friends from boyhood. If I can get to see him, I will so lay matters before him that he must surrender.” Jin Xiang got permission to try, and rode quickly to the wall of Chencang. Then he called out, “Friend Hao Zhao, your old chum Jin Xiang has come to see you.” A sentry on the wall told Hao Zhao, who bade them let the visitor enter and bring him up on the wall. “Friend, why have you come?” asked Hao Zhao. “I am in the service of Shu, serving under Zhuge Liang as an assistant in the tactical department. I am created exceedingly well, and my chief has sent me to say something to you.” Hao Zhao was rather annoyed, and said, “Zhuge Liang is my enemy. I serve Wei while you serve Shu. Each serves his own lord. We were brothers once, but now we are enemies; so do not say any more.” And the visitor was requested to take his leave. Jin Xiang tried to reopen the conversation, but Hao Zhao left him and went up on the tower. The Wei soldiers hurried Jin Xiang on to his horse and led him to the gate. As he passed out, he looked up and saw his friend leaning on the guard rail. He pulled up his horse, pointed with his whip at Hao Zhao, and said, “My friend and worthy brother, why has your friendship become so thin?” “Brother, you know the laws of Wei,” replied Hao Zhao. “I have accepted their bounty, and if that leads to death, so be it. Say no more, but return quickly to your master and tell him to come and attack. I am not afraid.” So Jin Xiang had to return and report failure. “He would not let me begin to explain,” said he. “Try again,” said Zhuge Liang. “Go and really talk to him.” So the go-between soon found himself once more at the foot of the wall. Hao Zhao presently appeared on the tower, and Jin Xiang shouted to him, “My worthy brother, please listen to my words while I explain clearly. Here you are holding one single city; how can you think of opposing one hundred thousand troops? If you do not yield, you will be sorry when it is too late. Instead of serving the great Hans, you are serving a depraved country called Wei. Why do you not recognize the decree of Heaven? Why do you not distinguish between the pure and the foul? Think over it.” Then Hao Zhao began to get really angry. He fitted an arrow to his bow and he called out, “Go! Or I will shoot."
羣臣讀詔已畢。孔明曰：“國不可一日無君；請立嗣君，以承漢統。”乃立太子禪卽皇帝位，改元建興。加諸葛亮為武鄕侯，領益州牧。葬先主於惠陵，諡曰昭烈皇帝。尊皇后吳氏為皇太后。諡甘夫人為昭烈皇后。糜夫人亦追諡為皇后。陞賞羣臣，大赦天下。,"The ministers have finished reading the edict. Kong Ming said: ""The country cannot be without a ruler for one day; please establish an heir to inherit the Han lineage."" Add Zhuge Liang as Marquis of Wu Yan, and lead Yizhou shepherd. He was buried in Huiling and was given the posthumous title of Emperor Zhaolie. Respect Queen Wu as Empress Dowager. The posthumous Mrs Gan was Empress Zhaolie. Madam Mi was also posthumously named Queen. Reward the ministers and give amnesty to the world.","Xuande’s body is carried back to Chengdu. There, the formal rituals of mourning and of enthroning the new emperor, his son Liu Shan, as the second ruler take place so the Han lineage can continue without a break. Xuande is named as August Emperor Zhao Lie, meaning Reflected Glory, and he is buried at Huiling.","This is my final and simple command.” When this had been read, Zhuge Liang said, “The state cannot go a single day without a ruler, wherefore I beg you to install the heir as successor to the great line of the Hans.” Thereupon the ceremony was performed, and the new Emperor took his place. The style of the reign was changed to “Beginning Prosperity.” Zhuge Liang was made Lord of Wuxiang and Imperial Protector of Yiazhou. Then they buried the late Emperor at Huiling with the posthumous style of Liu Bei the Glorious Emperor. The Empress, of the Wu family, was formally created Empress Dowager. The late Consort Gan became the Glorious Empress, and the Lady Mi was granted similar, also posthumous, rank. There were promotions in rank and rewards for all, and a general amnesty was proclaimed."
操令卜東吳、西蜀二處。輅設卦云：“東吳主亡一大將，西蜀有兵犯界。”操不信。忽合淝報來：“東吳陸口守將魯肅身故。”操大驚，便差人往漢中探聽消息。不數日，飛報劉玄德遣張飛、馬超兵屯下辦取關。操大怒，便欲自領大兵再入漢中，令管輅卜之。輅曰：“大王未可妄動。來春許都必有火災。”操見輅言累驗，故不敢輕動，留居鄴郡，使曹洪領兵五萬，往助夏侯淵、張郃同守東川；又差夏侯惇領兵三萬，於許都來往巡警，以備不虞；又敎長史王必總督御林軍馬。主簿司馬懿曰：“王必嗜酒性寬，恐不堪任此職。”操曰：“王必是孤披荊棘歷艱難時相隨之人，忠而且勤，心如鐵石，最足相當。”遂委王必領御林軍馬屯於許都東華門外。,"Ordered the two divisions of Dongwu and Xishu. The hexagram of Xue She said: ""The lord of Eastern Wu has lost a major general, and there are soldiers in Xishu who have invaded the world."" I don't believe it. Suddenly Hefei reported: ""Lu Su, the general of Lukou in Eastern Wu, has died."" Cao was so shocked that he sent people to Hanzhong to find out the news. A few days later, Liu Xuande dispatched Zhang Fei and Ma Chaobing to clear the border. Cao was furious, so he wanted to lead his own troops into Hanzhong again, and ordered Guan Xie to scout him. Xue said: ""Your Majesty can't move rashly. There will be a fire in Xudu in the spring."" Cao saw Xia Houyuan and Zhang He guarding together, so he didn't dare to move lightly, and stayed in Ye County. Dongchuan; also sent Xiahou Dun to lead 30,000 troops to patrol in Xudu, in case of any danger; and also sent Changshi Wangbi to supervise the imperial army and horses. The chief clerk, Sima Yi, said: ""The king must be an alcoholic, and he may not be able to hold this position."" Cao said: ""The king must be the one who will follow through the tough times, loyal and diligent, with a heart like an iron stone, and the most equal. ""Then appointed Wang Bi to lead the imperial army and horses to settle outside the gate of Donghua, the capital of Xu.","Cao Cao doesn’t believe him, but then news comes that Lu Su has died and that Xuande has sent Zhang Fei and Ma Chao to capture the pass at Xiabian.","Could the shade of death detect, But the secrets of his skill Died with him,—are secrets still. Again Cao Cao asked him to divine concerning his rivals Wu and Shu. Guan Lu said, “The south just lost a famous leader, and the west is encroaching on your territory.” Cao Cao's doubts as to the accuracy of one of these events were soon set at rest, for a messenger came from Hefei to report: “Lu Su, the Supreme Commander of the South Land, has died in Lukou.” Then Cao Cao sent hurriedly into Hanzhong, and the scout returned to report: “Zhang Fei and Ma Chao have taken the Xiabian Pass and are threatening Hanzhong.” Cao Cao was angry and inclined to march at once against the invaders; but he consulted the great soothsayer, who advised him not to move. “Do not act in haste. In the coming spring there will be a conflagration in Xuchang,” said Guan Lu. Having been witness of the verification of Guan Lu's words, Cao Cao was in no mood to neglect the warning. He stayed on in his palace, but he sent Cao Hong with fifty thousand troops to assist in the defense of the Eastern Land of Rivers, while Xiahou Dun, with thirty thousand troops, went to Xuchang to keep careful watch and be ready against any surprises. He placed High Minister Wang Bi in command of the Imperial Guard. Sima Yi warned Cao Cao against this Wang Bi, saying, “The man is given to wine, and slack. He is not a fit person for such a post.” Cao Cao replied, “He is very fit. He has followed me through all difficulties and dangers. He is loyal and diligent, solid as stone or iron.” Wang Bi was appointed and led the guard into camp at the capital, outside the East Gate of the Imperial Palace."
四將行兵之次，劉璝曰：“吾聞錦屏山中有一異人，道號‘紫虛上人’，知人生死貴賤。吾輩今日行軍，正從錦屏山過。何不試往問之？”張任曰：“大丈夫行兵拒敵，豈可問於山野之人乎？”璝曰：“不然：聖人云：‘至誠之道，可以前知。’吾等問於高明之人，當趨吉避凶。”於是四人引五六十騎至山下，問徑樵夫。樵夫指高山絕頂上，便是上人所居。四人上山至庵前，見一道童出迎。問了姓名，引入庵中。只見紫虛上人，坐於蒲墩之上。四人下拜，求問前程之事。紫虛上人曰：“貧道乃山野廢人，豈知休咎？”劉璝再三拜問，紫虛遂命道童取紙筆，寫下八句言語，付與劉璝。其文曰：,"The second time the four generals marched, Liu Yan said, ""I heard that there is a strange man in the Jinping Mountains, whose name is 'Zi Xushangren', who knows the importance of life and death. My generation is marching today, and we are passing through Jinping Mountain. Why don't you try to ask him?"" Zhang Ren said, ""How can you ask people who are in the mountains and fields when you are fighting against the enemy?"" Yan said, ""No, the sage said: 'The way of sincerity can be known beforehand.' Avoid the murderer."" So the four led fifty or sixty horses to the foot of the mountain and asked the woodcutter. The woodcutter pointed to the very top of the mountain, where the Venerable Master lived. The four of them went up the mountain to the front of the nunnery, and saw a boy coming out to greet them. Asked for the name and introduced into the nunnery. I saw Master Zixu, sitting on the Podun. The four bowed down and asked about the future. Master Zixu said, ""Poor Dao is a waste in the mountains and wild, how do you know what to do with it?"" Its text says:","Now when they are en route, Liu Gui says to the others that he knows of a Daoist called the Supreme Master of the Purple Void who lives in the nearby hills. ‘He has the power to foretell life and death,’ says Liu Gui, ‘and all manner of things. Why don’t we go and ask his advice?’ Zhang Ren dismisses this. ‘ Men of war do not go visiting hermits,’ he says with great disdain. ‘I totally disagree,’ retorts Liu Gui. ‘After all the Master15 has said, ‘Those who follow the Way know the future.’ This Daoist may be able to give us some guidance.’ So the four men with their escort turn aside and ride up the mountain to the sage’s hut. They are admitted to the Supreme Master’s presence only to find they are initially ignored, and Liu Gui has to repeat his request a number of times before the Master picks up a brush and writes eight lines. To the left: dragon – to the right: phoenix, To the western rivers they fly.","So the four ablest generals—Deng Xian, Ling Bao, Liu Gui, and Zhang Ren—were told off for this duty, and they led fifty thousand troops. As they marched, Liu Gui said, “In the Silky Hills there is a wonderful Taoist who calls himself 'The Super Human of the Dark Void.' He has the gift of second sight, so let us visit him as we pass and inquire what our fortunes are to be.” “What should one seek of a hermit when one is out to repulse an enemy?” said his colleague, Zhang Ren, contemptuously. “Your view is wrong,” said Liu Gui. “The Holy One ((Confucius)) has said that it is characteristic of the most entire sincerity to be able to foreknow. So let us inquire of this man of high intelligence that we may know what to do and what to avoid.” Whereupon they went up into the hills and sought the hermit's retreat. They were a small party, on horseback. Meeting a wood-cutter, they inquired the whereabouts of the dwelling of the wise man, and he pointed to one of the highest hills, saying that the Sage lived on the very summit. They climbed up to the spot he had told them of and found a small hut. At their summons, a lad in Taoist garb came out to speak with them. He asked their names and led them into the presence of the Super Human, who received them seated on a rush cushion. They made a low obeisance, told him the reason of their coming, and asked of the future. “How can a poor Taoist recluse know ought of fortunes, good or evil?” said he. However, after a time, as Liu Gui repeated his request again and again and comported himself most humbly, the hermit bade the lad bring paper and ink and he wrote eight lines, which he handed to his questioner."

司馬炎觀表，大喜，便令興師——賈充、荀勗、馮紞三人，力言不可，炎因此不行。祜聞上不允其請，歎曰：“天下不如意事，十常八九。今天與不取，豈不大可惜哉！”至咸寧四年，羊祜入朝，奏辭歸鄕養病。炎問曰：“卿有何安邦之策，以敎寡人？”祜曰：“孫皓暴虐已甚，於今可不戰而克。若皓不幸而歿，更立賢君，則吳非陛下所能得也。”炎大悟曰：“卿今便提兵往伐，若何？”祜曰：“臣年老多病，不堪當此任。陛下另選智勇之士，可也。”遂辭炎而歸。是年十一月，羊祜病危，司馬炎車駕親臨其家問安。炎至臥榻前，祜下淚曰：“臣萬死不能報陛下也！”炎亦泣曰：“朕深恨不能用卿伐吳之策——今日誰可繼卿之志？”祜含淚而言曰：“臣死矣，不敢不盡愚誠：右將軍杜預可任。若欲伐吳，須當用之。”炎曰：“舉善薦賢，乃美事也；卿何薦人於朝，卽自焚其奏稿，不令人知耶！”祜曰：“拜官公朝，謝恩私門，臣所不取也。”言訖而亡。炎大哭回宮，勅贈太傅鉅平侯。南州百姓聞羊祜死，罷市而哭。江南守邊將士，亦皆哭泣，襄陽人思祜存日，常遊於峴山，遂建廟立碑，四時祭之。往來人見其碑文者，無不流涕，故名為“墮淚碑”。後人有詩歎曰：,"Sima Yan looked at the watch and was overjoyed, so he ordered Jia Chong, Xun Xu, and Feng Xun to start his teachers. Hu Wenshang refused to accept his request, sighed and said: ""Unfortunate things in the world are always unsatisfactory. It would be a pity not to take it today!"" In the fourth year of Xianning, Yang Hu entered the court and gave a speech to return to Yang to recover from his illness. Yan asked, ""What is your plan to keep the country safe, so as to teach the widow?"" Hu said, ""Sun Hao's tyranny has become so severe that he can overcome it without fighting now. If Hao dies unfortunately, and a virtuous ruler is established, then Wu is beyond the reach of His Majesty. ""Yan Dawu said: ""Your Excellency will send troops to attack now, what's the matter?"" Hu said: ""My minister is old and sick, and I cannot bear this position. Your Majesty can choose another man of wisdom and courage."" In November of that year, Yang Hu was critically ill, and Sima Yan came to his house in a car to say hello. When Yan Zhi was lying in front of the couch, Hu shed tears and said: ""I can't avenge your Majesty if I die!"" Yan Yi cried and said, ""I deeply regret that I can't use Qing's strategy to defeat Wu - who can follow Qing's ambition today?"" Hu said with tears in his eyes. ""The minister is dead, and I dare not fail to be sincere: Du Yu, the right general, can be appointed. If you want to attack Wu, you must use it."" Yan said: ""It is a beautiful thing to do good things and recommend people to the court. It's a manuscript, no one will know it!"" Hu said: ""I worship the official and public court, thank my private family, and the minister will not take it."" After saying this, he died. Yan cried and returned to the palace, and he gave the Grand Master Juping Marquis as a gift. When the people of Nanzhou heard the death of Yang Hu, they stopped the market and cried. The soldiers guarding the border in the south of the Yangtze River also wept. The people of Xiangyang, who lived in Sihu, often traveled to Xian Mountain, and built temples and monuments to worship them at four seasons. People who come and go see the inscription on the inscription, and they all shed tears, hence the name ""Tearfall Monument"". A later poem sighed and said:","He then sets out how desperate the people of Wu are under the tyranny of Sun Hao. He has every expectation that the request for permission to invade will be agreed. But while Sima Yan agrees, his advisers do not, and so no permission is given. Deeply disappointed, Yang Hu bemoans that a real opportunity has been lost. In the year AD 278 he travels to court and asks permission to retire to his home village, as he is unwell. Asked for his advice, he says, ‘Wu is ready for revolt and consequently for conquest, but if someone virtuous were to arise after Sun Hao, then the situation would change and the opportunity would be lost.’ Asked if he will lead an invasion, he declines on grounds of health and recommends the ruler find a younger man. Then he goes back to his home village. However, the return home does not solve the problem of his health, and a few months later he is at death’s door. Sima Yan makes the journey to be at his bedside. Deeply moved by this, Yang Hu expresses his gratitude and loyalty to Sima; in return, Sima apologizes for having failed to act against Wu when Yang Hu so strongly and accurately proposed it. In response to Sima’s question about who else could undertake the task, Yang Hu recommends Du Yu. Having ensured continuity, Yang Hu dies. Across the land people mourn the passing of this great and, even more importantly, good man. In Xiangyang the people remember that he loved to ride in the Xian hills. So they build a temple and carve a stele, and people go there each season to pray. Those who read the stele always cry, which is how it gained its name, ‘The Stele of Tears’. A poem has described this:","When Sima Yan read this, he gave orders for the army to move. But three officers—Jia Chong, Xun Xu, and Feng Dan—opposed it, and the orders were withdrawn. Yang Hu was disappointed and said, “What a pity it is that of ten affairs in the world, one always meets with eight or nine vexations!” In the fourth year of Universal Tranquillity, in Jin calendar (AD 278), Yang Hu went to court and asked leave to retire on account of ill health. Before granting him leave to go, Sima Yan asked, “Do you have plans to propose to settle the state?” Yang Hu replied, “Sun Hao is a very cruel ruler and could be conquered without fighting. If he were to die and a wise successor sat upon his throne, Your Majesty would never be able to gain possession of Wu.” “Suppose your army attacked now; what then?” asked the Ruler of Jin. “I am now too old and too ill for the task,” replied Yang Hu. “Some other bold and capable leader must be found.” Yang Hu left the court and retired to his home. Toward the end of the year he was nigh unto death, and the Ruler of Jin went to visit him. The sight of his master at his bedside brought tears to the eyes of the faithful old leader. “If I died a myriad times, I could never requite Your Majesty,” said Yang Hu. Sima Yan also wept, saying, “My great grief is that I could not take advantage of your abilities to attack Wu. Who now is there to carry out your design?” Hesitatingly the sick man replied, “I am dying and must be wholly sincere. General Du Yu is equal to the task, and is the one man to attack Wu.” Sima Yan said, “How beautiful it is to bring good people into prominence! But why did you write a memorial recommending certain people and then burn the draft so that no one knew?” The dying man answered, “I bowed before the officials in open court, but I did not beseech the kindness of the private attendants.” So Yang Hu died, and Sima Yan wailed for him and then returned to his palace. He conferred on the dead leader the posthumous rank of Imperial Guardian and Lord of Juping. The traders closed their shops out of respect to his memory, and all the frontier camps were filled with wailing. The people of Xiangyang, recalling that he loved to wander on the Xian Hills, built there a temple to him and set up a stone and sacrificed regularly at the four seasons. The passers-by were moved to tears when they read Yang Hu's name on the tablet, so that it came to be called “The Stone of Tears.” I saw the fragments of a shattered stone"

On the same day, the Empress Sima Shi was ordered to announce the arrival, and the civil and military bureaucrats, Bei Luan, drove outside the Xiye Gate to greet him. Fashion hurriedly replied. Taiwei Wang Su said: ""Your Majesty should not answer the ceremony."" Mao said: ""I am also a human subject, so why don't you answer the ceremony?"" Wen Wu helped Mao Shang's carriage into the palace, and Mao said: ""The queen mother has ordered, I don't know why, Wu An dares to take a chariot and enter?"" Then he walked to Taiji East Hall. Sima Shi greeted him, Mao bowed down first, and Shi hurriedly helped him up. Greetings are over, introduce the queen mother. Afterwards he said: ""I saw that when you were young, you had the appearance of an emperor; now you can be the ruler of the world: you must be respectful and frugal, give virtue and benevolence, and do not insult the previous emperor."" Mao resigned again and again. The teacher ordered Wen Wu to invite Mao to come out of the Taiji Hall. It was Hitachi as the new emperor, and the sixth year of Jiaping was changed to the first year of Zhengyuan, and the world was amnesty. Civil and military officials, each with a gift.","Sima Shi calls a council of ministers and denounces the emperor, saying he is unfit to rule. Cajoling the queen mother, he arranges for Cao Fang to abdicate and with the queen mother selects another member of the Cao family, Cao Mao, to be emperor.","The Emperor-elect Cao Mao was the grandson of Emperor Pi, and son of Cao Lin, Prince of Donghai. When Cao Mao he was nearing the capital, all the officers attended to receive him at the Nanye Gate, where an imperial carriage awaited him. He hastily returned their salutations. “The ruler ought not to return these salutations,” said Wang Su, one of the officers. “I also am a minister and must respond,” replied he. They conducted him to the carriage to ride into the palace, but he refused to mount it, saying, “Her Majesty has commanded my presence; I know not for what reason. How dare I enter the Palace in such a carriage?” He went on foot to the Hall, where Sima Shi awaited him. He prostrated himself before Sima Shi. Sima Shi hastily raised him and led him into the presence. The Empress Dowager said, “In your youth I noticed that you bore the impress of majesty. Now you are to be the Ruler of the Empire. You must be respectful and moderate, diffusing virtue and benevolence. You must do honor to your ancestors—the former emperors.” Cao Mao modestly declined the proposed honor, but he was compelled to accept it. He was led out of the presence of the Empress Dowager and placed in the seat of empire in the Hall of Principles. The style of the reign was changed from Domestic Calm, the sixth year, to Right Origin, the first year (AD 254). An amnesty was granted. Honors were heaped upon Sima Shi, who also received the golden axes, with the right to proceed leisurely within the precincts, to address the Throne without using his name, and to wear arms at court. Many other officers also received promotions."
武侯淚向西風灑，為念無人佐鞠躬。,Marquis Wu shed tears to the west wind and bowed for the sake of no one.,"The tears of Kong Ming drifted upon the west wind, For there was no one else like him.","In the western winds blowing. For he knew the warrior gone, This grieving is beyond knowing."
司馬昭入壽春，將諸葛誕老小盡皆梟首，滅其三族。武士將所擒諸葛誕部卒數百人縛至。昭曰：“汝等降否？”衆皆大叫曰：“願與諸葛公同死，決不降汝！”昭大怒，叱武士盡縛於城外，逐一問曰：“降者免死。”並無一人言降。直殺至盡，終無一人降者。昭深加歎息不已，令皆埋之。後人有詩歎曰：,"Sima Zhao entered Shouchun and took Zhuge Dan to all the young and old, destroying his three clans. The warriors bound hundreds of Zhuge Dan's soldiers who had been captured. Zhao said, ""Are you coming down?"" Everyone shouted, ""I would like to die with Duke Zhuge, and I will never come down to you!"" Zhao was so angry that he ordered all the warriors to be bound outside the city, and asked one by one, ""Whoever comes down will be spared. Die."" No one said anything. Killed until the end, and no one came down in the end. Zhao sighed deeply and ordered everyone to be buried. A later poem sighed and said:","The Wu soldiers caught up in the fall of the city surrender, and although Sima Zhao wants to kill them all he is persuaded to have mercy, as this will be of advantage in the long run for their relationship with Wu.","When Sima Zhao entered the city, he put to death the whole family of Zhuge Dan. Some of his guards fell into the hands of Sima Zhao alive, and he offered them their lives if they would yield. They all refused, saying, “We would rather share the fate of our leader.” They were sent out of the city to be beheaded, but orders were given to offer each one his life at the last moment. Thus, before a person was about to receive the fatal blow, that one was asked to yield. Not one accepted, and they all died. In admiration for their fortitude, they were honorably interred by order of Sima Zhao. The loyal servant flees not in the day of disaster;"
張郃尋見夏侯尚、韓浩議曰：“此天蕩山，乃糧草之所；更接米倉山，亦屯糧之地：是漢中軍士養命之源。倘若疎失，是無漢中也。當思所以保之。”夏侯尚曰：“米倉山有吾叔夏侯淵分兵守護，那裏正接定軍山，不必憂慮。天蕩山有吾兄夏侯德鎮守，我等宜往投之，就保此山。”於是張郃與二將連夜投天蕩山來，見夏侯德，具言前事。夏侯德曰：“吾此處屯十萬兵，你可引去，復取原寨。”郃曰：“只宜堅守，不可妄動。”忽聽山前金鼓大震，人報黃忠兵到。夏侯德大笑曰：“老賊不諳兵法，只恃勇耳！”郃曰：“黃忠有謀，非止勇也。”德曰：“川兵遠涉而來，連日疲困，更兼深入戰境，此無謀也。”郃曰：“亦不可輕敵。且宜堅守。”韓浩曰：“願借精兵三千擊之，當無不克。”德遂分兵與浩下山。黃忠整兵來迎。劉封諫曰：“日已西沈矣，軍皆遠來勞困，且宜暫息。”忠笑曰：“不然：此天賜奇功，不取是逆天也。”言畢，鼓譟大進。韓浩引兵來戰。黃忠揮刀直取浩，只一合，斬浩於馬下。蜀兵大喊，殺上山來。張郃、夏侯尚急引軍來迎。忽聽山後大喊，火光沖天而起，上下通紅。夏侯德提兵來救火時，正遇老將嚴顏，手起刀落，斬夏侯德於馬下。原來黃忠預先使嚴顏引軍埋伏於山僻去處，只等黃忠軍到，却來放火柴草堆上，一齊點着，烈燄飛騰，照耀山峪。嚴顏旣斬夏侯德，往山後殺來。張郃、夏侯尚前後不能相顧，只得棄天蕩山，望定軍山投奔夏侯淵去了。黃忠、嚴顏守住天蕩山，捷音飛報成都。玄德聞之，聚衆將慶喜。法正曰：“昔曹操降張魯，定漢中，不因此勢以圖巴、蜀，乃留夏侯淵、張郃二將屯守，而自引大軍北還：此失計也。今張郃新敗，天蕩失守，主公若乘此時，舉大兵親往征之，漢中可定也。旣定漢中，然後練兵積粟，觀釁伺隙，進可討賊，退可自守。此天與之時，不可失也。”,"Zhang He found Xiahoushang and Han Hao and said: ""This Tiandang Mountain is a place for grain and grass; it is connected to Micang Mountain, and it is also a place for grain storage: it is the source of life for soldiers in Hanzhong. Think about that so I will protect it."" Xiahou Shang said, ""My uncle Xiahou Yuan is guarding Micang Mountain, and there is Dingjun Mountain there, so don't worry about it. Tiandang Mountain is guarded by my brother Xiahou De. ""So Zhang He and the second generals went to Tiandang Mountain overnight to meet Xiahou De and tell them what happened. Xiahou De said, ""I am stationing 100,000 soldiers here, and you can lead them there to regain the original fortress."" He said, ""You should only stick to it, and don't move rashly."" Suddenly, he heard a great earthquake from the golden drums in front of the mountain, and people reported that Huang Zhong's soldiers had arrived. Xiahou De laughed loudly and said, ""The old thief does not know the art of war, he only relies on his ears!"" He said, ""Huang Zhong has a plan, but he is not only brave."" In a battle situation, there is no plan."" He said, ""You should not underestimate the enemy. You should stick to it."" Han Hao said, ""I would like to use 3,000 elite soldiers to attack it, and I will be able to defeat it."" De Sui divided his troops and went down the mountain with Hao. Huang Zhong's troops came to welcome him. Liu Feng admonished: ""The sun has set in the west, and the troops have all come from far away to work hard, and it is advisable to take a break."" Zhong smiled and said, ""Otherwise: this day has given us extraordinary power, and it would be against the sky to not take it."" Enter. Han Hao led troops to fight. Huang Zhong swung his saber straight to take Hao, only one hit, cut Hao off the horse. The soldiers of Shu shouted and came up the mountain. Zhang He and Xiahou Shang hurriedly led an army to greet him. Suddenly, I heard the shouting from the back of the mountain, and the flames shot up into the sky, turning red up and down. When Xiahou De sent troops to put out the fire, he met the veteran Yan Yan. It turned out that Huang Zhong had ordered Yan Yan to lead the army to ambush in a remote place in the mountains. Just waiting for Huang Zhong's army to arrive, he came to set matches on the haystacks, and lit them all together. Yan Yanyan beheaded Xiahou De and went to the back of the mountain to kill him. Zhang He and Xiahoushang could not see each other before and after, so they had to abandon Tiandang Mountain and hope that Dingjun Mountain went to Xiahouyuan. Huang Zhong and Yan Yan defended Tiandang Mountain, and the good news flew to Chengdu. When Xuande heard about it, the crowd would rejoice. Fazheng said: ""In the past, Cao Cao surrendered to Zhang Lu and settled Hanzhong. He did not use the force to conquer Ba and Shu, but instead left Xiahouyuan and Zhang He as two generals, and then led the army back north: this was a miscalculation. If the lord takes advantage of this time and raises a large army to fight against it in person, Hanzhong can be settled. After settling Hanzhong, then train troops to accumulate grain, watch for provocations and wait for gaps. If you advance, you can attack the thieves, and if you retreat, you can defend yourself. and also.""","‘Just let me attack with three thousand men,’ says Han Hao, ‘and I will triumph!’ Against Zhang He’s advice , Xiahou De details three thousand men, and Han Hao rides out to confront Huang Zhong. Although exhausted, Huang Zhong tells his men to be ready to attack. When challenged by Liu Feng as to the wisdom of this with such weary troops, he replies, ‘Heaven has presented us with an opportunity for victory. Not to take it would therefore offend Heaven!’ So into the attack they go, led by Huang Zhong. Han Hao falls almost immediately to Huang Zhong; Yan Yan takes out one of the north’s main commanders, Xiahou De, brother of Xiahou Shang. The disasters force Zhang He and Xiahou Shang to abandon Tiandang camp and try to escape to another supply base on nearby Dingjun mountain. Meanwhile Huang Zhong and Yan Yan seize the supply depot at Tiandang, and the news of the triumph is sent back to a delighted Xuande in Chengdu. It is agreed that Xuande himself should advance on Hanzhong. Now Zhao Zilong and Zhang Fei come with him in support. So it is that in the autumn of AD 218 Xuande’s army arrives at Jiameng pass. Here, the old generals come to discuss the next steps. ‘","Then Zhang He sought the two generals who had brought about the misfortune and said to them, “This is Tiandang Mountain, where our stores are. Close by is Micang Mountain. The two mountains are the very source of life of the Hanzhong army. Lose them and Hanzhong is gone too. We must see to their security.” Xiahou Shang said, “My uncle, Xiahou Yuan, will look out for the defense of Micang Mountain, which is next to his station at Dingjun Mountain; there need be no anxiety about that. And my brother, Xiahou De, guards Tiandang Mountain. Let us go to him and help to protect that.” Zhang He and the two generals set out at once. They reached the mountain and told Xiahou De all that had happened. “I have one hundred thousand troops in camp here,” replied he. “You may take some of them and recover your lost camps.” “No,” replied Zhang He. “The only proper course is to defend.” Almost as they spoke the rolling of drums and the clang of gongs were heard, and the look-outs came to say that Huang Zhong was near. “The old ruffian does not know much of the art of war; after all,” said Xiahou De with a laugh, “he is only a brave.” “Be not mistaken; he is crafty and not only bold,” said Zhang He. “This move is against the rules and not at all crafty. He is worn from a long march and his soldiers are fatigued, and they are deep in an enemy's country.” “Nevertheless, be careful how you attack,” said Zhang He. “You would still do well to depend upon defense only.” “Give me three thousand good soldiers, and I will cut him to pieces,” cried Han Hao. They told off the three companies for him, and down he went into the plain. As he approached, Huang Zhong arrayed his army. Liu Feng put in a note of warning, saying, “The sun is setting, and our men are weary. Let us retire for the fight tomorrow.” But Huang Zhong paid little attention, saying, “I do not hold with your objections. This is the one God-given opportunity to make good, and it would be a sin not to take it.” So saying, the drums rolled for a great attack. Han Hao came forward with his troops, and the aged general went toward him whirling his sword. In the first encounter Han Hao fell. At this the soldiers of Shu gave a yell and went away up the hill, whereupon Zhang He and Xiahou Shang hastily moved out to withstand them. But a great red glare sprang into the sky from behind the hill, and a shouting arose. Hastily Xiahou De led off his troops to meet the danger there and went straight into the arms of Yan Yan. The Veteran General's arm rose, the sword fell, and Xiahou De dropped from his steed to rise no more. This ambush, into which the dead general had rushed, had been carefully prepared by Huang Zhong, who had sent Yan Yan away before he marched himself and given Yan Yan orders what to do. It was the brushwood that Yan Yan's men had spent the time in collecting that now sent forth the flames reaching up to the heavens and filling the valleys. Yan Yan, after slaying Xiahou De, came round the hill to aid in the attack so that the defenders were taken both in front and rear. They could do nothing and presently left the battlefield and rushed toward Dingjun Mountain to seek refuge with Xiahou Yuan. Meanwhile the victors took steps to hold the position they had won and sent the good news of victory to Capital Chengdu. And when the news arrived, Liu Bei called together all his officers to rejoice. Then said Fa Zheng, “Not long ago Zhang Lu submitted to Cao Cao, and thereby Cao Cao got possession of Hanzhong quite easily. Instead of following up this by an advance westward, he left two generals to guard it and went south. That was a mistake. Now, my lord, do not make a mistake yourself, but take advantage of the present favorable position, with Zhang He newly defeated and Tiandang Mountain captured, to attack Hanzhong and you will have it at once. Once that is yours, you can train your army and amass supplies ready for a stroke against the arch-rebel himself. This God-given advantage will be confirmed to you and you should not miss it.” Both Liu Bei and Zhuge Liang saw the wisdom of this scheme and prepared to act."

却說曹丕之母卞氏，聽得曹熊縊死，心甚悲傷；忽又聞曹植被擒，其黨丁儀等已殺，大驚。急出殿，召曹丕相見。丕見母出殿，慌來拜謁。卞氏哭謂丕曰：“汝弟植平生嗜酒疎狂，蓋因自恃胸中之才，故爾放縱。汝可念同胞之情，存其性命。吾至九泉亦瞑目也。”丕曰：“兒亦深愛其才，安肯害他？今正欲戒其性耳。母親勿憂。”,"However, he said that Cao Pi's mother, Bian, was very sad when he heard that Cao Xiong was hanged, and was shocked when he heard that Cao Wei had been captured and that his party Ding Yi and others had been killed. He rushed out of the hall and summoned Cao Pi to meet him. When Pi saw his mother leaving the temple, he panicked and came to pay homage. Mrs. Bian cried to Pi and said, ""Your younger brother Zhi has been addicted to alcohol and crazy in his life, because he is arrogant about his talents, so you let it go. You can remember the love of your compatriots and save your life. I will also close my eyes when I go to Jiuquan."" Pi said: ""My son also loves his talents deeply. Are you willing to harm him? Now I want to stop his sexuality. Mother, don't worry.""","The other is Cao Zhi, lord of Linzi, who with two well-known writers and drinkers – brothers by the name of Ding – is often drunk, even early in the morning. But Cao Zhi is also famous as a poet and initially refuses to respond to his brother the king’s requests to come and pay homage. An army of three thousand men attack and seize Cao Zhi and the Ding brothers. The brothers are immediately executed on Cao Pi’s orders – a fact that brings sadness to many of the writers and thinkers at that time – while Cao Zhi is brought before his brother. Now Cao Pi wants to kill his brother, but his mother pleads with him to be compassionate.","Cao Pi's mother, Lady Bian, was alarmed at the severity of the new rule, and the suicide of her youngest son wounded her deeply. When she heard that Cao Zhi had been arrested and his comrades put to death, she left her palace and went to see her eldest son. As soon as he saw her, the Prince hastened to meet her. She began to weep. “Your brother has always had that weakness for wine, but we let him go his way out of consideration for his undoubted ability. I hope you will not forget he is your brother and that I bore you both. Spare his life that I may close my eyes in peace when I set out for the deep springs.” “I also admire his ability, Mother, and have no intention to hurt him. But I would reform him. Have no anxiety as to his fate,” said Cao Pi. So the mother was comforted and withdrew."

徐質連日引兵搦戰，蜀兵不出。哨馬報司馬昭說：“蜀兵在鐵籠山後，用木牛流馬搬運糧草，以為久計，只待羌兵策應。”昭喚徐質曰：“昔日所以勝蜀者，因斷彼糧道也：今蜀兵在鐵籠山後運糧，汝今夜引兵五千，斷其糧道，蜀兵自退矣。”徐質領令，初更時分，引兵望鐵籠山來，果見蜀兵二百餘人，驅百餘頭木牛流馬，裝載糧草而行。魏兵一聲喊起，徐質當先攔住。蜀兵盡棄糧草而走。質分兵一半，押送糧草回寨；自引兵一半追來。追不到十里，前面車仗橫截去路。質令軍士下馬拆開車仗，只見兩邊忽然火起。質急勒馬回走，後面山僻窄狹處，亦有車仗截路，火光迸起。質等冒煙突火，縱馬而出。一聲礮響，兩路兵殺來：左有廖化，右有張翼，大殺一陣，魏兵大敗。徐質奮死隻身而走，人困馬乏。,"Xu Zhi led troops to fight for days, but the soldiers of Shu did not come out. The sentinel reported to Sima Zhao, saying: ""The soldiers of Shu used wooden oxen and horses to carry grain and grass behind the Iron Cage Mountain, thinking it was a long-term plan and only waiting for the Qiang soldiers to respond."" Zhao called Xu Zhi and said, ""The reason why people who won Shu in the past was because they cut off their grain route. ""Today, the soldiers of Shu are transporting grain behind the Iron Cage Mountain, and you will lead 5,000 troops tonight, cut off their grain route, and the Shu soldiers will retreat."" More than 200 soldiers drove more than 100 wooden oxen and horses, loaded with grain and grass. Wei Bing shouted, and Xu Zhi stopped him first. The soldiers of Shu abandoned all their food and grass and left. Qualitatively divided half of the troops, escorted grain and grass back to the village; self-introduced half of the troops to chase. After less than ten miles, the car in front crossed the road. The sergeant ordered the sergeant to dismount and dismantle the battle, only to see that the two sides suddenly burst into flames. In a hurry, the horse pulled back and walked back, and in the narrow and narrow place in the mountain behind, there were also chariots intercepting the road, and the fire burst out. The quality, etc., smoked and burst into flames, and rushed out. With a loud bang, two soldiers came: Liao Hua on the left and Zhang Yi on the right. Xu Zhi fought to his death and left alone, exhausted.","The first engagement goes badly for the Shu army, and Xu Zhi takes a mighty toll of the Shu soldiers. But at the next engagement it is the Wei troops who suffer, and Xu Zhi is slain.","When the troops of Wei came up and challenged, the troops of Shu refused battle. The scouts reported to Sima Zhao: “The Shu supplies are coming up along the rear of Iron Cage Mountain, and they are using the wooden oxen and running horses as transport.” They also reported the look of permanency in the defenses and said they were evidently awaiting the arrival of their allies the Qiang tribes. Then said Sima Zhao to Xu Zhi, “We formerly defeated the army of Shu by cutting off supplies, and we can do that again. Let five thousand troops go out tonight and occupy the road.” About the middle of the first watch Xu Zhi marched across the hills; and when he came to the other side, he saw a couple of hundred soldiers driving a hundred or so heads of mechanical animals laden with grain and forage. His army rushed down upon them with shouts, and the troops of Shu, seeing that their road was impassable, abandoned their supplies and ran away. Xu Zhi took possession of the supply train, which he sent back to his own camp under the escort of half his troops. With the other half he set out in pursuit. About three miles away, the road was found blocked with carts set across the track. Some of his soldiers dismounted to clear the way; but as they did so, the brushwood on both sides burst into a blaze. Xu Zhi at once drew off his force and turned to retire, but coming to a defile he found the road again blocked with wagons, and again the brushwood began to burn. He made a dash to escape, but before he could get clear a bomb roared, and he saw the troops of Shu coming down on him from two directions. Liao Hua and Zhang Yi from left and right fell on Xu Zhi with great fury, and the troops of Wei were wholly defeated. Xu Zhi himself got clear, but without any following. He struggled on till he and his steed were almost spent with fatigue."

I saw thousands of ghosts faintly scattered in the cloud of sorrow and resentment, all scattered with the wind. So Kong Ming ordered all the sacrifices to be discarded in the Lushui.","At the climax of the ceremony Kong Ming cries out aloud in anguish, and the whole army is moved to tears at his distress.","Zhuge Liang broke into loud lamentations at the end of this prayer and manifested extreme emotion, and the whole army shed tears. Meng Huo and his followers also moaned and wept, and amid the sad clouds and angry mists they saw the vague forms of many demons floating away on the wind till they disappeared. The material portion of the sacrifice was then thrown into the river."
臣伏自三省：受國厚恩，荷任一方，陳力未效，所獲已過，不宜復忝高位，以重罪謗。羣僚見逼，迫臣以義。臣退惟寇賊不梟，國難未已；宗廟傾危，社稷將墜：誠臣憂心碎首之日。若應權通變，以寧靜聖朝，雖赴水火，所不得辭：輒順衆議，拜受印璽，以崇國威。,"The ministers are in the three provinces: receiving the country's generous favor, paying for either party, Chen Li has not been effective, what has been obtained has passed, and it is not appropriate to return to a high position and slander with serious crimes. When the bureaucracy sees persecution, they persecute the ministers with righteousness. The ministers retire, but the bandits and thieves are not arrogant, the national disaster is not over; If you should adapt to the power and use the tranquility of the Holy Dynasty, even if you go to water and fire, you can’t say no: you will obey the public opinion, worship and receive the seal, and honor the country’s prestige.","He then talks about the pressure he has been under and how he has wrestled with his conscience. The key issue, however, is that the traitor Cao Cao has not been executed yet, and as a result the ancestral temple is in peril and the shrine for the wellbeing of the nation threatened. This could drive a man to despair, he says, but he has chosen to rise to the occasion by accepting the role of king.","Having reflected upon the ancient models and being desirous of temporary alleviation, my fellows have made me assume the title of Prince of Hanzhong with the addition of Regent Marshal. “I have deeply considered these things. If one receives kindness from the Throne and accepts the responsibility for a portion of the state and fail, then such a fault would only be made the more serious by holding high rank and thereby increasing the burden of reproach. But my fellows have urged me, and they have convinced me that it would be right; and, should I refuse, the wicked will not be destroyed and the danger to the state will not be removed. The temple of our ancestors is in danger, and the imperial prerogatives are failing. A faithful servant, who in the day of tribulation can undertake a suitable policy whereby to preserve the dynasty, should not refuse his help at any cost. Wherefore I have yielded and accepted the position for the glory of the state."
趙雲、魏延見孔明不用，各有慍色。孔明曰：“吾非不用汝二人。但恐以中年涉險，為蠻人所算，失其銳氣耳。”趙雲曰：“倘我等識地理，若何？”孔明曰：“汝二人只宜小心，休得妄動。”二人怏怏而退。趙雲請魏延到自己寨內商議曰：“吾二人為先鋒，却說不識地理而不肯用。今用此後輩，吾等豈不羞乎？”延曰：“吾二人只今就上馬，親去探之；捉住土人，便敎引進，以敵蠻兵，大事可成。”雲從之，遂上馬逕取中路而來。方行不數里，遠遠望見塵頭大起。二人上山坡看時，果見數十騎蠻兵，縱馬而來。二人兩路衝出。蠻兵見了，大驚而走。趙雲、魏延各生擒幾人，回到本寨，以酒食待之，却細問其故。蠻兵告曰：“前面是金環三結元帥大寨，正在山口。寨邊東西兩路，却通五溪洞并董荼那、阿會喃各寨之後。”,"Zhao Yun and Wei Yan were sullen when they saw that Kong Ming was not needed. Kong Ming said: ""I don't need you two. But I'm afraid that the middle-aged people will be involved in danger, and they will lose their sharpness."" Zhao Yun said: ""What if I knew geography like me?"" Kong Ming said: ""You two People should only be careful, don't act rashly."" The two retreated in frustration. Zhao Yun asked Wei Yan to discuss in his village, saying: ""The two of us are pioneers, but they say they don't know geography and are unwilling to use them. Wouldn't we be ashamed to use this younger generation now?"" Yan said: ""The two of us are only going on horses today. If you catch the natives, you will bring them in, and you will be able to do great things if you fight against the barbarians."" Yun Congzhi then mounted his horse and took the middle road. Fang traveled for a few miles, and saw the dust head rising from a distance. When the two of them went up the hillside to look, they saw dozens of cavalry soldiers coming on horseback. The two rushed out. When the barbarian saw it, he ran away in shock. Zhao Yun and Wei Yan each captured a few people alive, returned to their home village, treated them with food and wine, but asked them the reason. The barbarian soldiers said, ""In front is the Dazhai, Marshal of Sanjie, Jinhuan, at the mountain pass. There are two roads from the east and west to the village, but it leads to Wuxi Cave and behind Dong Dana and Ahuinan villages.""","In planning how to confront them, Kong Ming plays games with the loyalty of his old martial allies Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan. He speaks as if he considers them too old and unfamiliar with the territory. So he appoints younger men – Wang Ping and Ma Zhong – to lead the main attacking troops. Disgruntled, the two older men take themselves off and, having captured some locals, from whom they gather information on the enemy, devise their own strategy for attacking the three armies in their various encampments. Leading five thousand of the best fighters, Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan set out at the dead of night for the camp of Jinhuansanjie.","Zhao Yun and Wei Yan now began to feel hurt. Noticing this, Zhuge Liang said, “I have no wish to pass you over, you two, but I fear that if you get too deeply into the country and should fall victims to the Mangs, it will have an ill effect on the others.” “But what if we did know the geography of the country?” said Zhao Yun. “All I say to you is to be careful how you do anything,” replied Zhuge Liang. The two soldiers left and went together to the camp of Zhao Yun. Zhao Yun said, “We are greatly ashamed at being put in the background because we do not know the country. We cannot bear this.” “Then let us ride out and survey,” said his colleague. “Let us capture a few natives and make them show us the road, and let us defeat these tribesmen.” They rode off. Before they had gone far they saw a cloud of dust in the distance. Climbing a hill to get a better view, they saw a small party of mounted Mangs coming toward them. The two waited till they were near and then suddenly burst out. The Mangs, taken entirely by surprise, ran away all but a few, who yielded themselves prisoners. The two warriors returned to camp. The prisoners were given wine and food; and when they had satisfied their hunger, they were questioned. Said they, “The camp of Chief Jinhua Sanjie is just in front, just by the entrance to the mountains. Near the camp, running east and west, is the Five Valleys."

却說安定太守崔諒，在城中聞蜀兵圍了南安，困住夏侯楙，十分慌懼，卽點軍馬約共四千，守住城池。忽見一人自正南而來，口稱有機密事。崔諒喚入問之，答曰：“某是夏侯都督帳下心腹將裴緒。今奉都督將令，特來求救於天水、安定二郡。南安甚急，每日城上縱火為號，專望二郡救兵，並不見到；因復差某殺出重圍，來此告急，可星夜起兵為外應。都督若見二郡兵到，却開城門接應也。”諒曰：“有都督文書否？”緒貼肉取出，汗已濕透；略敎一視，急令手下換了匹馬，便出城望天水而去。不二日，又有報馬到，告天水太守已起兵救援南安去了，敎安定早早接應。崔諒與府官商議。多官曰：“若不去救，失了南安，送了夏侯駙馬，皆我兩郡之罪也：只得救之。”諒卽點起人馬，離城而去，只留文官守城。崔諒提兵向南安大路進發，遙望見火光沖天，催兵星夜前進。離南安尚有五十餘里，忽聞前後喊聲大震，哨馬報道：“前面關興截住去路，背後張苞殺到！”安定之兵，四下逃竄。諒大驚，乃領手下百餘人，往小路死戰得脫，奔回安定。方到城壕邊，城上亂箭射下來。蜀將魏延在城上叫曰：“吾已取了城也！何不早降？”原來魏延扮作安定軍，夤夜賺開城門，蜀兵盡入：因此得了安定。,"However, they said that Cui Liang, the prefect of Anding, heard that the soldiers of Shu had surrounded Nan'an in the city and trapped Xiahou Mao. Suddenly I saw a man coming from the south, claiming to have a secret. Cui Liang called in to ask him, and replied, ""This is Pei Xu, a confidant under the command of the Xiahou governor. Today, on the order of the governor, I have come to ask for help in the two counties of Tianshui and Anding. Nan'an is very urgent. Looking at the rescue of soldiers from the two counties, I didn’t see it; because a certain dispatcher broke out of the siege and came here in an emergency, but the starry night raised troops to respond. If the governor sees the soldiers from the two counties arriving, he will open the city gate to respond.” Liang said: “There is a document from the governor. No?"" Xu Tie's meat was taken out, sweat soaked; after a brief glance, he hurriedly ordered his subordinates to change horses, and went out of the city to look at Tianshui. The next day, another report arrived, telling Tianshui that the prefect had raised troops to rescue Nan'an, and told An Ding to respond early. Cui Liang discussed with the government officials. Duoguan said, ""If you don't go to save Nan'an, you will lose Nan'an and send Xiahou's concubine, all of which are my two counties' sins: I have to save them."" Lian You ordered his troops and left the city, leaving only the civil servants to guard the city. Cui Liang sent his troops to Nan'an Road, and saw the flames rising into the sky, urging the troops to advance in the starry night. There were still more than fifty miles away from Nan'an, when suddenly I heard loud shouts from the front and back, and the sentry reported: ""Guan Xing blocked the way in front, and Zhang Bao killed behind him!"" The soldiers of stability fled in all directions. Forgive the shock, but led more than a hundred of his men to fight to the death on the road, and ran back to stability. Fang arrived at the moat, and arrows shot down from the city. Wei Yan, the general of Shu, called out from the city, ""I have already taken the city! Why didn't I come down earlier?"" It turned out that Wei Yan was pretending to be an army of stability and opened the gate of the city every night, and all the soldiers of Shu entered: therefore, stability was obtained.","Thus the governor of Anding receives a sudden visit from a messenger ‘from Nan’an’ by the name of Pei Xu claiming to bring a letter (very wet, soiled and not easily read) from Xiahou Mao at Nan’an asking for help. The next day another surprise visitor turns up, saying that the governor of Tianshui has already sent his men to help Nan’an and Xiahuo Mao. Not long after, the governor of Anding, Cui Liang, sets off for Nan’an, spurred on because he sees flames in the distance. Kong Ming’s men have piled up brushwood around the city and lit it to make it look like a city about to be sacked. But he still has about twenty miles to go when he is ambushed by Zhang Bao and Guan Xing. Fleeing, he heads back to the supposed safety of Anding, only to discover that Wei Yan has captured the city.","He mustered his four thousand soldiers, resolved to defend his city as long as possible. Then there came a man from the south direction, who said he had secret letters. Cui Liang had him brought into the city, and, when questioned, the man said, “I am one of Xiahou Mao's trusted soldiers and named Pei Xu. I was sent to beg for help from Tianshui and Anding. The city of Nanan is hard pressed; every day we have raised fires to call the attention of your cities to our plight, but our signals have all failed. No one has come. I was ordered to fight my way through the besiegers and come to tell you. You are to give assistance immediately, and our General will open the gates to help you.” “Have you a letter from the General?” asked Cui Liang. A letter was produced from inside the man's dress, all moist with perspiration. After the Governor had read it, the soldier took it back and went on to Tianshui. Two days later a mounted messenger came to say: “Governor Ma Zun of Tianshui with his troops have already started for Nanan. The troops of Anding should march at once to their aid.” Cui Liang took the advice of his officers. Most of them said, “If you do not go, and Nanan is taken, we shall he blamed for giving up the Imperial Son-in-Law. He must be rescued.” Thereupon Cui Liang marched; the civil officers were left in charge of the city. The army took the high road to Nanan. They saw flames shooting up to the sky all the time, and the Governor urged the army to march faster. When fifteen miles from the city, there was heard the drums of an attacking force, and the scouts came to say that the road ahead was held by Guan Xing, while Zhang Bao was coming up quickly in their rear. At this news the soldiers scattered in all directions. Cui Liang had a hundred men left with whom he tried to cut his way out that he might return to his own city. He got through. But when he came to his own city, a flight of arrows greeted him from the wall, and Wei Yan shouted to him, saying, “I have taken the city; you would better yield!” This was what had happened. Wei Yan and his soldiers, disguised as an Anding soldiers, in the darkness of the night had beguiled the wardens of the gate into opening it, and the men of Shu had got in."

却說公孫淵乃遼東公孫度之孫，公孫康之子也。建安十二年，曹操追袁尚，未到遼東，康斬尚首級獻操，操封康為襄平侯；後康死，有二子：長曰晃，次曰淵，皆幼；康弟公孫恭繼職。曹丕時封恭為車騎將軍襄平侯。太和二年，淵長大，文武兼備，性剛好鬥，奪其叔公孫恭之位，曹叡封淵為揚烈將軍遼東太守。後孫權遣張彌、許宴齎金寶珍玉赴遼東，封淵為燕王。淵懼中原，乃斬張、許二人，送首與曹叡。叡封淵為大司馬樂浪公。淵心不足，與衆商議，自號為燕王，改元紹漢元年。副將賈範諫曰：“中原待主公以上公之爵，不為卑賤；今若背反，實為不順。更兼司馬懿善能用兵，西蜀諸葛武侯且不能取勝，何況主公乎？”淵大怒，叱左右縳賈範，將斬之。參軍倫直諫曰：“賈範之言是也。聖人云：‘國家將亡，必有妖孽。’今國中屢見怪異之事：近有犬戴巾幘，身披紅衣，上屋作人行。又城南鄕民造飯，飯甑之中，忽有一小兒蒸死於內。襄平北市中，地忽陷一穴，湧出一塊肉，周圍數尺，頭面眼耳口鼻都具，獨無手足，刀箭不能傷，不知何物。卜者占之曰：‘有形不成，有口不聲；國家亡滅，故現其形。’——有此三者，皆不祥之兆也。主公宜避凶就吉，不可輕舉妄動。”淵勃然大怒，叱武士綁倫直并賈範同斬於市。令大將軍卑衍為元帥，楊祚為先鋒，起遼兵十五萬，殺奔中原來。,"However, it was said that Gongsun Yuan was the grandson of Gongsun Du in Liaodong and the son of Gongsun Kang. In the twelfth year of Jian'an, Cao Cao pursued Yuan Shang, but before he arrived in Liaodong, Kang Zhan Shang's head was sacrificed to Cao Cao, and Cao made Kang the Marquis of Xiangping; after Kang died, he had two sons: the first named Huang, the second named Yuan, both young; Kang's younger brother Gongsun Congrats to succession. At that time, Cao Pi made Gong the Marquis of Xiangping, the general of chariots and cavalry. In the second year of Taihe, Yuan grew up, possessed both civil and military skills, and was just right to fight. Later, Sun Quan sent Zhang Mi and Xu Yanjie Jinbao Zhenyu to Liaodong, and made Yuan the King of Yan. Yuan was afraid of the Central Plains, so he beheaded Zhang and Xu, and sent their heads to Cao Rui. Rui Fengyuan was the Duke of Sima Lelang. Yuan's heart was not enough, so he discussed with the public, and called himself King of Yan, and changed it to the first year of Yuan Shaohan. Deputy General Jia Fanjian said: ""In the Central Plains, it is not mean to treat the lord above the duke, but now if you turn your back, it will be disobedient. Moreover, Sima Yi is good at military use, and Zhuge Wuhou of Xishu cannot win, let alone the lord?"" Yuan Furious, he slammed Jia Fan from left to right and beheaded him. Joining the army, Lun Zhi said: ""Jia Fan's words are true. The sage said: 'The country will perish, and there will be evil spirits.' There are often strange things in the country today: there are dogs wearing scarves and red clothes, and they go up to the house to walk around. In the south of the city, the people made rice, and in the rice retort, a young child died of steaming inside. In the north city of Xiangping, the ground suddenly sank into a point, and a piece of meat came out, several feet around, with head, face, eyes, ears, nose, and nose. No limbs, swords and arrows can't hurt, I don't know what. The fortune teller said: 'If you have a form, you can't make a sound. It is good for the lord to avoid evil and do not act rashly."" Yuan was furious, and ordered the warrior to tie Lunzhi and Jia Fantong to the city. The general Bei Yan was made the marshal, Yang Zuo was the vanguard, and 150,000 soldiers from the Liao Dynasty were sent to the Central Plains.",Cao Rui orders Sima Yi to come to court and then despatches him to deal with the revolt of the lord of Liaodong.,"This Gongsun Yuan was a grandson of Gongsun Du the Warlike, and a son of Gongsun Kang in Liaodong. In the twelfth year of Rebuilt Tranquillity, when Cao Cao was pursuing Yuan Shang, who had fled eastward, Gongsun Kang had captured Yuan Shang, beheaded him, and sent his head to Cao Cao. For this service Gongsun Kang received the title of Lord of Xiangping. After Gongsun Kang's death, as his two sons—Gongsun Huang and Gongsun Yuan—were young, his brother Gongsun Gong took the chiefship; and Cao Pi, beside confirming the lordship, gave him the rank of General of the Flying Cavalry. A few years later, the second son, Gongsun Yuan, being now grown up, well-educated and trained in military exercises, obstinate and fond of fighting, took away his uncle's power and ruled the heritage of his father. Cao Rui conferred upon him the title of General Who Wields Ferocity, and made him Governor of Liaodong. Then the Ruler of Wu, Sun Quan, anxious to secure Gongsun Yuan's support, sent two envoys, Zhang Mi and Xu Yan, with gifts of gold and gems and pearls and offered Gongsun Yuan the title of Prince of Yan. Fearing that the Middle Land would resent any dallying with Wu, Gongsun Yuan slew the Wu envoys and sent the heads to the Ruler of Wei. For this proof of fealty, Cao Rui gave him the title of Grand General and the Dukedom of Yuelang. However, Gongsun Yuan was dissatisfied, and his thoughts turned toward independence. He took council with his officers and proposed to style himself Prince of Yan and to adopt a reign-title of Extending Han, the first year. One general, Jia Fan, opposed this and said, “My lord, the central authorities have treated you well and honored you. I fear that Sima Yi is too skillful a leader for rebellion to succeed. You see even Zhuge Liang cannot defeat him; how much less can you?” Gongsun Yuan's reply was to condemn Jia Fan to death. However, Adviser Lun Zhi ventured upon further remonstrance. “Jia Fan spoke well. The Sacred One says that extraordinary phenomena presage the destruction of a state. Now this time portents are not wanting, and wonders have been seen. A dog, dressed in red and wearing a turban, went up to the roof and walking like a man. Moreover, while a certain person living in a village south of the city was cooking his food, he saw a child in the pan, boiled to death. A great cave opened near the market place and threw out a large, fleshy body completely human save that it lacked limbs. Swords could not cut it; arrows could not penetrate it. No one knew what to call it; and when they consulted the soothsayers, they obtained the reply, 'Incomplete shape, silent mouth: a state is near destruction.' These prodigies are all inauspicious. Flee from evil and strive to walk in fair fortune's way. Make no move without most careful thought.” This second remonstrance enraged Gongsun Yuan still more, and he sent Lun Zhi to death with Jia Fan. Both were executed in the public place. Gongsun Yuan then prepared to make a bid for empire. He raised an army of one hundred fifty thousand, appointed Bei Yan as Commander, and Yang Zuo as Leader of the Van."
次日，人報劉皇叔遣幕賓簡雍在城下喚門。璋令開門接入。雍坐車中，傲睨自若。忽一人掣劍大喝曰：“小輩得志，傍若無人！汝敢藐視吾蜀中人物耶！”雍慌下車迎之。此人乃廣漢綿竹人也：姓秦，名宓，字子勅。雍笑曰：“不識賢兄，幸勿見責。”遂同入見劉璋，具說玄德寬洪大度，並無相害之意。於是劉璋決計投降，厚待簡雍；次日，親齎印綬文籍，與簡雍同車出城投降。玄德出寨迎接，握手流涕曰：“非吾不行仁義，奈勢不得已也！”共入寨，交割印綬文籍，並馬入城。,"The next day, it was reported that Uncle Liu Huang sent Mubin Jian Yong to call the door under the city. Zhang order to open the door to access. Yong sat in the car, proudly looking at himself. Suddenly, a man slammed his sword and shouted: ""The younger generation is successful, and there is no one around! You dare to despise the people in my Shu!"" Yong panic got out of the car to greet him. This person is also from Mianzhu, Guanghan: his surname is Qin, his given name is Mi, and his style is Zichi. Yong smiled and said, ""I don't know your worthy brother, so I'm fortunate not to be blamed."" Then he went to see Liu Zhang together, saying that Xuande was generous and magnanimous, and had no intention of harming each other. So Liu Zhang decided to surrender and treated Jian Yong favorably; the next day, he personally printed the inscriptions on the ribbon, and went out of the city with Jian Yong to surrender. Xuande came out of the village to greet him, shook his hands and said, ""If I can't do benevolence and righteousness, I have no choice but to do so!"" They entered the village together, handed over the printed books, and entered the city on horseback.","So Liu Zhang is sent to what is in effect comfortable house arrest in Jingzhou but given an honorific title to compensate him. All those who have joined Xuande are rewarded with posts and titles and vast amounts of money, and treasures are sent to Guan Yu in Jingzhou.","Next day they reported that Liu Bei, the Imperial Uncle, had sent Jian Yong as legate to visit Liu Zhang and he was even then at the city gate. Jian Yong was admitted, and he entered, riding in a carriage and looking about him most haughtily. Suddenly he was hailed from the street by a man with a sword in his hand, who cried, “You have got your wish, wretched creature, and you seem to think there is no one to compare with you. But do not look so contemptuously at us of Shu.” Jian Yong quickly got out of his carriage to speak to the speaker, who was a man of Mianzhu named Qin Mi. “Worthy brother,” said Jian Yong, “I did not recognize you. I pray you not to be angry.” Both then went to visit Liu Zhang, and they spoke of the liberality and broad-mindedness of Liu Bei, said he had no intention to harm any one, and praised him to such effect that Liu Zhang then and there made up his mind finally that he would give up the struggle. So he treated Jian Yong very honorably that day. And the next day, taking his seal and insignia if of office and his archives, he accompanied Jian Yong out of the city and went to Liu Bei's camp. Liu Bei came out in person to receive him. Taking Liu Zhang by the hand, Liu Bei wept, saying, “It is not that I wish to act cruelly or wrongly; I am the victim of circumstances and cannot help it.” They entered the camp together, where the seal of office and the documents changed hands. Afterwards they rode into the city side by side."
忽報費褘自成都來見丞相。孔明請入。費褘禮畢，孔明曰：“吾有一書，正欲煩公去東吳投遞，不知肯去否？”褘曰：“丞相之命，豈敢推辭？”孔明卽修書付費褘去了。褘持書逕到建業，入見吳主孫權，呈上孔明之書。權拆視之，書略曰：,"He suddenly reported that Fei had come from Chengdu to see the Prime Minister. Kong Ming, please come in. When the ceremony was over, Kong Ming said, ""I have a book that I want to trouble the Duke to deliver to Dongwu, but I don't know if I will go?"" He said, ""How dare you refuse the order of the prime minister?"" Kong Ming paid for the book. He took the book path to Jianye, met Sun Quan, the master of Wu, and presented the book of Kongming. Quan dismantles it, and the book briefly says:","In desperation he sends the learned adviser Fei Yi as an envoy to Sun Quan, the Wu emperor, asking for help.","Just at this time Fei Yi arrived front Chengdu. Zhuge Liang received him and, after the ceremonies were over, said, “I would trouble you, Sir, to carry a letter for me into East Wu; will you undertake the mission?” “Could I possibly decline any task you laid upon me?” said Fei Yi. So Zhuge Liang wrote a letter and sent it to Sun Quan. Fei Yi took it and hastened to Jianye, where he saw Sun Quan, the Ruler of Wu, and presented this letter: “The Hans have been unfortunate, and the line of rulers has been broken."

前蒙遣差結好荊州，不意主公左右不得其人，以致如此。今荊州眷念舊情，不忘族誼。主公若能幡然歸順，量不薄待。望三思裁示。,"The former Meng sent a messenger to form a good relationship with Jingzhou, but he didn't care that the lord would not be able to control anyone, so this is the case. Today, Jingzhou remembers the old love and does not forget the family friendship. If the lord is willing to surrender, he will not be taken lightly. Please think twice.","As he consults with his father, a letter arrives from Fa Zheng, who has suggested to Xuande that he try to persuade Liu Zhang to submit.","However, the ruler of Jingzhou still remembers old friendship and is mindful of the ties of relationship. If you, my master, could reverse your policy and lend your support to your relative, I think you would be generously treated. I hope you will consider this carefully.”"

When Kong Ming heard this, he was overjoyed and said, ""I have been wanting to attack Wei for a long time, but there are soldiers from Sima Yi, General Yong and Liang. What do I worry about when the plan is demoted today?"" Kong Ming's ""Apprenticeship Table"" is a part of the class. The table says:",Hua Xin takes over his army. When Kong Ming is told of what has happened he is delighted because he is fearful of invading Wei if Sima Yi has an army.,"Zhuge Liang rejoiced when they told him of the success that had attended the ruse. “Sima Yi and the forces he commanded in Xizhou and Xiliang have been the obstacles in my long-wished-for attack on Wei. Now he has fallen, I have no more anxiety.” At the first great assembly of officers at court, Zhuge Liang stepped forth and presented to the Ruler of Shu a memorial on the expedition he contemplated. “The First Ruler had accomplished but half his great task at his death."

Mao held his sword and shouted, ""I am the Son of Heaven! You are breaking into the palace, wanting to kill the emperor?"" The forbidden soldiers saw Cao Mao, but they did not dare to move. Jia Chong called Cheng Ji and said, ""What's the use of Duke Sima raising you? It's just for today's business."" When bound? ""Chong said: ""Sima Gong has an order, as long as you die. ""Chengji Nianji went straight to the front of the carriage. Mao shouted: ""How dare you be rude!"" Before he finished speaking, he was stabbed in the chest by Chengji's halberd and knocked out of the chariot. With another halberd, the blade came out from his back and died by the chariot. Jiao Bo came to meet him with a spear, but was stabbed to death by Chengji's halberd. They all fled. Wang Jing came later and scolded Jia Chong, saying, ""The rebel An dares to kill the king! ""Full of rage, he slammed around and bound Ding, and reported to Sima Zhao. Zhao entered, and saw that Mao was dead, he pretended to be in a state of shock, banged his head against the chariot and cried, and told the ministers.","In the street he is confronted by an armed Jia Chong on horseback, with Cheng Ji and Cheng Zu in attendance, followed by many thousands of armed troops. Emperor Cao Mao shouts above the noise, ‘This is the Son of Heaven. Do you intend to murder your rightful ruler?’ Jia Chong then turns to Cheng Ji. ‘This is why you have been retained by Sima Zhao’, and at this command Cheng Ji shifts his halberd and asks, ‘Dead or as a prisoner?’ ‘Dead – by order of Sima Zhao,’ replies Jia Chong. Then Cheng Ji charges. Cao Mao cries out aloud, ‘ You traitor, how dare you!’ but these are his last words. Cheng Ji’s halberd stabs him in the chest. Cao Mao struggles out of the carriage, only to be struck again in the back. Dead, he falls down beside the carriage. All his guard flee. Only Wang Jing cries out in outrage, and he is seized and bound while a report is sent to Sima Zhao. When Sima Zhao comes to the scene of the murder, he pretends to be truly upset.","Presently Jia Chong came in sight. He was armed and mounted on a fine horse. Beside him rode two generals, Cheng Zu and Cheng Ji, and behind him followed a body of mail-clad guards, who shouted one to another as they rode. Then Cao Mao held up his sword and cried, “I am the Son of God. Who are you thus breaking into the forbidden precincts? Are you come to murder your lawful ruler?” The soldiers suddenly stopped, for they were palace guards. Then Jia Chong shouted to Cheng Ji, saying, “What did Duke Sima Zhao train you for if not for this day's work?” Cheng Ji took his halberd and turned to Jia Chong, saying, “Death or capture?” “Duke Sima Zhao said the man had to die,” replied Jia Chong. Cheng Ji rushed toward the carriage. “Fool! How dare you?” cried the Ruler of Wei. But the shout was cut short by a thrust from the halberd full in the breast; another thrust, and the point came out at the back, so that Cao Mao lay there dead beside his carriage. Jiao Bo coming up to strike a blow in defense was also slain, and the little escort scattered. Wang Jing, who had followed, upbraided Jia Chong, shouting, “Rebel and traitor! How dare you kill the Emperor?” Jia Chong got angry and bade his lictors arrest Wang Jing and stop his tongue. When they told Sima Zhao, he went into the Palace, but the Emperor was dead. He assumed an air of being greatly shocked and beat his head against the carriage, weeping and lamenting the while. He sent to tell all the officials of high rank."

却說蠻王孟獲在帳中正坐，忽哨馬報來，說三洞元帥，俱被孔明捉將去了；部下之兵，各自潰散。獲大怒，遂起蠻兵迤邐進發，正遇王平軍馬。兩陣對圓，王平出馬橫刀望之：只見門旗開處，數百南蠻騎將兩勢擺開。中間孟獲出馬，頭頂嵌寶紫金冠，身披纓絡紅錦袍，腰繫碾玉獅子帶，脚穿鷹嘴抹綠靴，騎一匹捲毛赤兔馬，懸兩口松紋鑲寶劍，昂然觀望，回顧左右蠻將曰：“人每說諸葛亮善能用兵；今觀此陣，旌旗雜亂，隊伍交錯；刀鎗器械，無一可能勝吾者：始知前日之言謬也。早知如此，吾反多時矣。誰敢去擒蜀將，以振軍威？”言未盡，一將應聲而出，名喚忙牙長；使一口截頭大刀，騎一匹黃驃馬，來取王平。二將交鋒，戰不數合，王平便走。孟獲驅兵大進，迤邐追趕。關索略戰又走，約退二十餘里。孟獲正追殺之間，忽然喊聲大起，左有張嶷，右有張翼，兩路兵殺出，截斷歸路。王平、關索復兵殺回。前後夾攻，蠻兵大敗。孟獲引部將死戰得脫，望錦帶山而逃。背後三路兵追殺將來。獲正奔走之間，前面喊聲大起，一彪軍攔住：為首大將乃常山趙子龍也。獲見了大驚，慌忙奔錦帶山小路而走。子龍衝殺一陣，蠻兵大敗，生擒者無數。孟獲止與數十騎奔入山谷之中，背後追兵至近，前面路狹，馬不能行，乃棄了馬匹，爬山越嶺而逃。忽然山谷中一聲鼓響：乃是魏延受了孔明計策，引五百步軍，伏於此處。孟獲抵敵不住，被魏延生擒活捉了。從騎皆降。,"But they said that the barbarian king Meng Huo was sitting in the tent, and suddenly the horses came to report, saying that the three-hole marshals had all been captured by Kong Ming, and the soldiers of his subordinates were scattered. He was furious, so he set up a barbarian army and set out to meet Wang Ping's army. When the two formations were facing each other, Wang Ping stepped out and looked at them with a sword: I saw the gate flags open, and hundreds of southern barbarians swung the two formations away. In the middle, Meng Huo went out on a horse, with a purple and gold crown inlaid on his head, wearing a red brocade robe with tassels, a jade lion belt around his waist, and green boots with an eagle's beak on his feet. Looking back at the barbarian generals left and right, he said: ""People always say that Zhuge Liang is good at using troops; today, when I look at this formation, the flags and flags are messed up, the ranks are intertwined, and none of the swords and guns can defeat me. It's been a long time. Who dares to capture the generals of Shu to strengthen the army?"" Before he could finish his words, a general came out, named Busy Teeth Long; he used a large sword to cut off his head and rode a yellow horse to take Wang Ping. The two generals confronted each other, and Wang Ping left. Meng Huo drove his troops forward and chased after him. Guan Suo strategically left again, about twenty miles back. While Meng Huo was chasing him, he suddenly shouted loudly, Zhang Yi on the left and Zhang Yi on the right, two soldiers rushed out, cutting off the way back. Wang Ping and Guan Suo returned with their troops. Attacking from front and back, the brute force was defeated. Meng Huo's generals escaped in a deadly battle and fled looking at Jindai Mountain. Behind the three-way soldiers chasing and killing the future. While Huozheng was running, there was a loud shout in front of him, and a Biao army stopped him: The chief general was Changshan Zhao Zilong. When he was shocked, he hurried to the Jindai Mountain path. Zilong rushed to kill for a while, the brute force was defeated, and there were countless people who were captured. Meng Huozhi and dozens of cavalry rushed into the valley, chasing the soldiers from behind, the road in front was narrow, and the horses could not move, so he abandoned the horses and climbed the mountains and fled. Suddenly, there was a sound of drums in the valley: it was Wei Yan who took Kong Ming's plan and led five hundred foot soldiers to lie down here. Meng Huo was unable to resist the enemy and was captured alive by Wei Yan. All descend from riding.","Viewing his enemy, he is dismissive of the supposed skills of Kong Ming. ‘You call this an army?’ he says scornfully. ‘This Kong Ming is no military genius! This is pathetic. Had I realized how foolish he was and how false his reputation, I’d have rebelled long ago!’ This is why, when the initial challenge match between the Man tribes’ warrior Mangyachang and Wang Ping results in Wang Ping’s apparent defeat and flight, Meng Huo is trapped into advancing. He is, of course, drawn into an ambush and is captured by Wei Yan, while Meng’s troops are routed, with huge losses and many taken prisoner. Wei Yan brings the captured Meng Huo to Kong Ming’s camp, where he has put on a display of the Shu army’s wealth and strength designed to awe the rebel chief. Kong Ming immediately orders the release of the soldiers, saying, ‘I know that your families are desperate for news of you and fear the worse.","The King of the Mangs was sitting in his tent when the scouts told him that his three chiefs had been captured and their armies scattered. It made him very angry, and he quickly got his army ready to march. Soon he met Wang Ping, and, when the armies were arrayed, Wang Ping rode out to the front, saber in his hand. The flaunting banners of the array formation of his foes then opened out, and he saw their ranks. Many generals were on horseback on both sides. In the middle was the King, who advanced to the front. He wore a golden, inlaid head-dress; his belt bore a lion's face as clasp; his boots had pointed toes and were green; he rode a frizzy-haired horse the color of a red hare; he carried at his waist a pair of swords chased with the pine amber. He looked haughtily at his foes, and then, turning to his generals, said, “It has always been said that Zhuge Liang is a wonderful soldier, but I see that is false. Look at this array with its banners all in confusion and the ranks in disorder. There is not a weapon among all the swords and spears better than ours. If I had only realized this before, I would have fought them long ago. Who dares go out and capture a Shu general to show them what sort of warriors we are?” At once a general rode toward the leader Wang Ping. His name was Mangya Chang; his weapon was a huge headsman's sword, and he rode a dun pony. Riding up to Wang Ping, the two engaged. Wang Ping only fought a short time, and then fled. Meng Huo at once ordered his troops on in quick pursuit, and the troops of Shu retreated seven miles or so before the Mangs were near enough to fight. Just as the Mangs thought their enemies were in their power, a great shouting arose and two cohorts appeared, Zhang Ni from the left and Zhang Yi from the right, and attacked. The Mangs could not retreat, and as the force under Wang Ping and Guan Suo also turned upon them, the Mangs were surrounded and lost the day. Meng Huo and some of his generals fought their way out and made for the Brocade Mountains. The troops of Shu followed and forced them forward, and presently there appeared, in front, Zhao Yun. Meng Huo hastily changed his route to go deeper into the mountains, but Zhao Yun's soldiers spread around, and the Mangs could not make a stand. Here many were captured. Meng Huo and a few horsemen got away into a valley, which, however, soon became too narrow for the horses to advance. Meng Huo then left his horse and crawled up the mountains, but very soon he fell upon Wei Yan, who had been sent with five hundred troops to lie in wait in that very valley. Meng Huo tried to struggle but soon was captured. The King and his followers were taken to the main camp, where Zhuge Liang was waiting with wine and meat ready for the captives."
却說魏延在本寨中，夜作一夢，夢見頭上忽生二角，醒來甚是疑異。次日，行軍司馬趙直至，延請入問曰：“久知足下深明《易》理——吾夜夢頭生二角，不知主何吉凶？煩足下為我決之。”趙直想了半晌，答曰：“此大吉之兆：麒麟頭上有角，蒼頭頭上有角，乃變化飛騰之象也。”延大喜曰：“如應公言，當有重謝！”直辭去，行不數里，正遇尚書費褘。褘問何來。直曰：“適至魏文長營中，文長夢頭生角，令我決其吉凶。此本非吉兆，但恐直言見怪，因以麒麟蒼龍解之。”褘曰：“足下何以知非吉兆？”直曰：“角之字形乃刀下用也。今頭上有角，其凶甚矣。”褘曰：“君且勿洩漏。”直別去。費褘至魏延寨中，屏退左右，告曰：“昨夜三更，丞相已辭世矣。臨終再三囑付，令將軍斷後以當司馬懿，緩緩而退，不可發喪。今兵符在此，便可起兵。”延曰：“何人代理丞相之大事？”褘曰：“丞相一應大事，盡託與楊儀；用兵密法，皆授與姜伯約。此兵符乃楊儀之令也。”延曰：“丞相雖亡，吾今現在。楊儀不過一長史，安能當此大任？他只宜扶柩入川安葬。我自率大兵攻司馬懿，務要成功。豈可因丞相一人而廢國家大事耶？”褘曰：“丞相遺令，敎且暫退，不可有違。”延怒曰：“丞相當時若依我計，取長安久矣！吾今官任前將軍、征西大將軍南鄭侯，安肯與長史斷後！”褘曰：“將軍之言雖是，然不可輕動，令敵人恥笑。待吾往見楊儀，以利害說之，令彼將兵權讓與將軍，何如？”延依其言。,"However, it is said that Wei Yan was in the village and had a dream at night, dreaming that two horns suddenly appeared on his head, and waking up very suspicious. The next day, Sima Zhao Zhi, who was marching in the army, asked him to enter and asked, ""I have known for a long time that I understand the principles of the Book of Changes. I have two horns in my dream at night. After a long while, he replied, ""This is a great auspicious sign: there are horns on the head of the unicorn, and there are horns on the head of the blue, which are like changing and flying."" Not counting miles, I am encountering the book fee. Bang asked where. Zhi said: ""It's time to reach Wei Wenchang's camp, and Wenchang's dream has a horn, and let me decide whether it is a good or bad omen. This is not a good omen, but I am afraid to say it outright, so I will solve it with a unicorn and a blue dragon."" Zhi said: ""The zigzag shape of the horns is also used under the sword. Now there are horns on the head, and it is very fierce."" Bang said: ""Master, please do not leak."" Zhi don't go. Fei Chong went to Wei Yanzhai, and withdrew to the left and right, saying, ""Last night at the third watch, the prime minister has passed away. On his deathbed, he ordered the general to become Sima Yi after he was cut off, and then he retreated slowly and did not mourn. You can raise troops."" Yan said, ""Who is the prime minister for the important affairs?"" He said, ""The prime minister should entrust Yang Yi with all the important matters; he will give Jiang Boyue a secret method of military affairs. This military talisman is also the order of Yang Yi."" Yan He said, ""Although the prime minister is dead, I am now. Yang Yi has only a long history, so An Neng should take up this important task? He should only be buried in Sichuan with the coffin. I will lead a large army to attack Sima Yi, and I must succeed. Ye?"" He said: ""The prime minister's order, he ordered to retreat temporarily, and it must not be violated."" Yan anger said: ""When the prime minister is equal, if you follow my plan, I will take Chang'an for a long time! Marquis Zheng, An Ken and Chang Shi have cut off the queen!"" He said: ""Although the general's words are true, they should not be taken lightly and the enemy will be ridiculed. When I go to see Yang Yi, I will talk about it in terms of interests and disadvantages, and ask him to hand over the military power to the general. How? ?"" Yan Yi said.","Wei Yan, meanwhile, has had a dream. He dreams that he has two horns coming out of his head. Disturbed by this, he asks Zhao Zhi if he can explain it. Troubled, Zhao Zhi tells him it is auspicious but when later he discusses this with Fei Yi he says that actually it is an inauspicious sign but that he doesn’t want to alarm Wei Yan. When Wei Yan finds out that Yang Yi has been given prime ministerial responsibilities at Kong Ming’s deathbed, he becomes very difficult, questioning why Yang was chosen and not him. ‘Let’s attack, and this way fulfil the hoped-for victory against Sima Yi. No point in stopping now just because the prime minister is dead!’ But Fei Yi has to point out that Kong Ming’s last instructions were to retreat. To pacify Wei Yan, Fei Yi promises to discuss this with Yang Yi, but when he tells Yang Yi of the conversation, he says that Kong Ming warned that Wei Yan would rebel.","One night as Wei Yan lay asleep in his tent, he dreamed a dream. In his vision two horns grew out of his head. When he awoke he was much perplexed to explain his dream. Marching General Zhao Zhi came to see him, and Wei Yan said, “You are versed in the Book of Changes. I have dreamed that two horns grew upon my head, and would trouble you to expound the dream and tell me its portent.” Zhao Zhi thought a moment and replied, “It is an auspicious dream. Dragon and Linlion both have horns on the head. It augurs transformation into an ascending creature.” Wei Yan, much pleased, thanked the interpreter of his dream and promised him gifts when the dream proved true. Zhao Zhi left and presently met Fei Yi, who asked whence he came. “From the camp of our friend Wei Yan. He dreamed that he grew horns upon his head, and I have given him an auspicious interpretation. But really it is inauspicious. However, I did not wish to annoy him.” “How do you know it is inauspicious?” “The word for horn is composed of two parts, 'knife' above and 'use' below, and so means that there is a knife upon his head. It is a terrible omen.” “Keep it secret,” said Fei Yi. Then Fei Yi went to the camp of Wei Yan, and when they were alone, he said, “The Prime Minister died last night in the third watch. He left certain final orders, and among them, that you are to command the rearguard to keep Sima Yi at bay while the army retreats. No mourning is to be worn. Here is your authority, so you can march forthwith.” “Who is acting in place of the late minister?” asked Wei. “The chief command has been delegated to Yang Yi, but the secret plans of campaign have been entrusted to Jiang Wei. This authority was issued from Yang Yi.” Wei Yan replied, “Though the Prime Minister is dead, I am yet alive. The Military Counselor Yang Yi is only a civil officer and unequal to this post. He ought to conduct the coffin home while I lead the army against Sima Yi. I shall achieve success, and it is wrong to abandon a whole plan of campaign because of the death of one man, even if that be the Prime Minister.” “The Prime Minister's orders were to retire, and these orders are to be obeyed.” “If the Prime Minister had listened to me, we should now have been at Changan. I am the General Who Conquers the West and Lord of Nanzheng. I am not going to act as rearguard for any civil official,” said Wei Yan, angry. “It may be as you say, General, but you must not do anything to make us ridiculous. Let me go back to Yang Yi and explain, and I may be able to persuade him to pass on to you the supreme military authority he holds.”"
却說孔明班師回國，孟獲率引大小洞主酋長，及諸部落羅拜相送；前軍至瀘水，時值九月秋天，忽然陰雲布合，狂風驟起；兵不能渡，回報孔明。孔明遂問孟獲。獲曰：“此水原有猖神作禍，往來者必須祭之。”孔明曰：“用何物祭享？”獲曰：“舊時國中因猖神作禍，用七七四十九顆人頭并黑牛白羊祭之，自然風恬浪靜，更兼連年豐稔。”孔明曰：“吾今事已平定，安可妄殺一人？”遂自到瀘水岸邊觀看。果見陰風大起，波濤洶湧，人馬皆驚。孔明甚疑，卽尋土人問之。土人告說：“自丞相經過之後，夜夜只聞得水邊鬼哭神號。自黃昏直至天曉，哭聲不絕。瘴煙之內，陰鬼無數。因此作禍，無人敢渡。”孔明曰：“此乃我之罪愆也：前者馬岱引蜀兵千餘，皆死於水中；更兼殺死南人，盡棄此處：狂魂怨鬼，不能解釋，以致如此。吾今晚當親自往祭。”土人曰：“須依舊例，殺四十九顆人頭為祭，則怨鬼自散也。”孔明曰：“本為人死而成怨鬼，豈可又殺生人耶？吾自有主意。”喚行廚宰殺牛馬，和麵為劑，塑成人頭，內以牛羊等肉代之，名曰“饅頭。”當夜於瀘水岸上，設香案，鋪祭物，列燈四十九盞，揚旛招魂；將饅頭等物，陳設於地。三更時分，孔明金冠鶴氅，親自臨祭，令董厥讀祭文。其文曰：,"However, it was said that when Kongming's class returned to his country, Meng Huo led the chiefs of the large and small caves, and Luobai of various tribes to send them off. Kong Ming then asked Meng Huo. Huo said: ""This water was originally caused by rampant gods, and people who come and go must sacrifice it."" Kong Ming said: ""What kind of sacrifice should I use?"" Huo said: ""In the old days, because of rampant gods and disasters, seven, seven, forty-nine people were used in the country. The head and the black cow and the white sheep are sacrificed to him, and the wind is calm and the waves are naturally calm, and it has been prosperous for successive years."" Kong Ming said, ""I have calmed down the matter now. Seeing that the wind was blowing, the waves were turbulent, and everyone was startled. Kong Ming was very suspicious, so he looked for a native to ask him. The natives reported: ""Since the Prime Minister passed by, every night I can only hear the cries of ghosts beside the water. From dusk until dawn, the cries are continuous. Within the miasma, there are countless ghosts. Therefore, no one dares to cross. Kong Ming said, ""This is my guilt: the former Ma Dai led more than a thousand soldiers from Shu, and they all died in the water; moreover, he also killed the southerners and abandoned them here: mad souls and resentful ghosts, I can't explain, that's why. Tonight, you should go to the sacrifice in person."" The natives said, ""The rules must remain the same. If you kill forty-nine human heads as sacrifices, then the ghosts will disperse."" Kong Ming said, ""It was originally a human death that became a ghost, how could it be done again? Killing people? I have my own idea."" He called the chef to slaughter cattle and horses, mixed noodles as a potion, molded human heads, and replaced them with meat such as cattle and sheep. The sacrifices consisted of forty-nine lanterns and raised banners to evoke the soul; steamed buns and other items were placed on the ground. During the third watch, Kongming, wearing a golden crown and a crane cloak, personally came to the sacrifice and ordered Dong Jue to read the sacrifice. Its text says:","Meng Huo looks at the storms swirling around the Shu army and divines immediately that this is caused by malicious spirits who must be pacified by offering sacrifices. When Kong Ming asks what kind of sacrifices, Meng Huo replies, ‘In the past, when these malicious spirits were driven crazy, lashing out in all directions, the only thing that worked was to offer forty-nine human heads – seven times seven – plus a black ox and a white goat.’ Kong Ming is loath to shed more blood but he knows the army is deeply troubled and anxious. When the local people are asked why they think this is happening they tell him they believe the trouble is caused by the ghosts of those soldiers – both Shu and Man – who died in the river. They have heard terrible cries and shrieks ever since the battle as well as seen strange ghostly shapes and eerie mists. They tell him yet again that only human sacrifice will work. To this Kong Ming replies ‘But these ghosts are from men who’ve died, so why would more deaths be of any use? To be honest, I’ve a much better plan.’ He has forty-nine fake heads created by moulding dough stuffed with meat. These he offers in a ceremony in the middle of night, wearing his Daoist robes. A long proclamation is formally and ritually read out to appease the souls of the dead.","But on trying to cross the river, a tremendous storm came and hindered them. Wei Yan having reported his difficulty to Zhuge Liang, Meng Huo was asked if he knew of any reason for such a storm. Meng Huo replied, “Wild spirits have always troubled those who would cross this river; it is necessary to propitiate them with sacrifices.” “What is the sacrifice?” asked Zhuge Liang. “In the old days when malicious spirits brought misfortune, they sacrificed humans to the number of seven sevens and offered their heads. They also slew a black ox and a white goat. Sacrifice thus; the wind will subside and the waters come to rest. The same used to be done to secure a plenteous harvest.” “How can I slay a single man without good reason now that fighting is done and peace has returned?” said Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang went down to the river to see for himself. The north wind was blowing hard, and the waves were high. Both humans and horses seemed frightened. He himself was perplexed. Then he sought out some of the natives and questioned them. They said, “We have heard the demons moaning every night since the army crossed the river. The cries begin at dusk and continued till dawn. There are many dark demons in the malarial vapors and no one dared cross.” “The sin is mine,” said Zhuge Liang, “for more than a thousand soldiers of Ma Dai perished in these waters beside the southern people. Their poor distressed souls are not yet freed. Therefore I will come this night and sacrifice to them.” “According to the ancient rule the number of victims ought to be forty-nine; then the spirits will disperse,” said the natives. “As the resentful demons are here because of the deaths of people, where is the sense in slaying more humans? But this will I do. I will make balls of flour paste after the manner of human heads and stuff them with the flesh of oxen and goats. These shall be used instead of human heads, for indeed they be called 'mantou' or 'human heads.'“ By nightfall, an altar had been set up on the bank of the river with the sacrificial objects all arranged. There were also forty-nine lamps. Flags were flying to summon the souls. The “mantou” were piled up on the ground. In the middle of the third watch, at midnight, Zhuge Liang, dressed in Taoist garb, went to offer the sacrifice in person, and he bade Dong Jue read this prayer:"

You have sent your modest refusal of our offer to abdicate. But I have long since seen that the virtue of Han is passing, and I could only rely upon the late Prince, your father, who virtuously undertook the great task of removing the evil oppressors and purging the land. Now his son Cao Pi has succeeded. His perfect virtue is resplendent, his fame universal and his benevolence is wafted to all parts. The divine choice rests upon him. “In the days of old, Yao the Great would abdicate, and did so in favor of Shun, who possessed merit after his twenty accomplishments; and the God-king Shun in the same manner handed the Throne to Yu after he had labored to control the floodwaters. The House of Han succeeded in the course of ages to the work of Yao and now passes on the sacred trust, to promote the repose of the Earth and manifest the command of Heaven. “By the hand of the Minister Zhang Yin, this is sent with the emblems and the seal.”"

忽一日，玄德自覺渾身肉顫，行坐不安；至夜，不能寧睡，起坐內室，秉燭看書，覺神思昏迷，伏几而臥；就室中起一陣冷風，燈滅復明，抬頭見一人立於燈下。玄德問曰：“汝何人，夤夜至吾內室？”其人不答。玄德疑怪，自起視之，乃是關公於燈影下，往來躲避。玄德曰：“賢弟別來無恙！夜深至此，必有大故。吾與汝情同骨肉，因何迴避？”關公泣告曰：“願兄起兵，以雪弟恨！”言訖，冷風驟起，關公不見。玄德忽然驚覺，乃是一夢：時正三鼓。玄德大疑，急出前殿，使人請孔明來。孔明入見。玄德細言夢警。孔明曰：“此乃王上心思關公，故有此夢。何必多疑？”玄德再三疑慮，孔明以善言解之。,"Suddenly one day, Xuande consciously trembled all over his body, walking and sitting uneasy; at night, unable to sleep peacefully, he sat up in the inner room, held a candle and read a book, felt unconscious, fell down and lay down; He looked up and saw a man standing under the lamp. Xuande asked, ""Who are you who came to my inner room at night?"" The man did not answer. Xuande was suspicious, and since he saw it, it was Guan Gong who was hiding under the shadow of the lamp. Xuande said: ""My worthy brother, stay safe! It's so late at night, there must be a big reason. My love is the same as you, why do you avoid it?"" , the cold wind suddenly rose, Guan Gong disappeared. Xuande suddenly realized that it was a dream: the three drums at the right time. Xuande was very suspicious, so he rushed out of the front hall and sent someone to invite Kong Ming. Kong Ming came in. Xuande spoke carefully about the dream police. Kong Ming said: ""This is the king's mind about Guan Gong, so I have this dream. Why do I have to be suspicious?"" Xuande repeated his doubts, and Kong Ming explained it with kind words.","Sitting in his inner room, he collapses in a faint on the table. The candle blows out and then relights itself as a cold wind blows through the room. Lifting his head up, Xuande can see the shape of a man in the light of the candle. ‘Who are you that you dare come to my room in the middle of the night?’ he demands. But answer comes there none. Suddenly Xuande realizes that it is Guan Yu, wandering back and forth. ‘My dear brother, how have you been since we last met?’ asks Xuande. ‘There must be some trouble that brings you here like this in the middle of the night. Come, we are brothers, so why are you being evasive?’ Weeping, Guan Yu replies, ‘My dear brother, I beg you to take an army and avenge me’, and, so saying, he disappears. Horrified, Xuande summons Kong Ming, who tries to reassure him that this is simply because he is worried about Guan Yu. As Kong Ming returns to his quarters, Xu Jing arrives to say that Lü Meng has taken Jingzhou and that Guan Yu is dead.","Liu Bei was ill at ease and felt a creepiness of the skin that boded evil. He was restless by day and sleepless by night. One night he rose from his couch and was reading by the light of a candle when drowsiness overcame him, and he fell asleep over the low table by his side. He dreamed. A cold gust of wind swept through the chamber, almost putting out the candle flame. When it brightened again he glanced up and saw a figure standing near the light. “Who are you, who thus come by night to my chamber?” asked he. The figure made no reply, and Liu Bei got up to go over and see who it was. Then the figure took the shape of his brother. But it avoided him, retreating as he advanced. Liu Bei said, “Brother, there is nothing wrong, I hope. But surely something of great importance brings you here thus in the dead of the night. And why do you avoid me, your brother, who loves you as himself?” Then the figure wept and said, “Brother, send your armies to avenge me.” As Guan Yu said that, a chilly blast went through the room, and the figure disappeared. Just then Liu Bei awoke and knew that he had dreamed. The drums were beating the third watch as he awoke. He felt greatly worried and disturbed. So he went into the front portion of the palace and sent for Zhuge Liang. Soon he came, and Liu Bei told him of the vision. “You have been thinking too deeply of Guan Yu lately, my lord,” said Zhuge Liang. “There is no need to be distressed.” But Liu Bei could not find comfort, and Zhuge Liang was long in calming his feelings and arguing away his fancies."

If the soldiers of Shu fail to achieve their aspirations, they must retreat and lure the enemy, but Qing Ming should not pursue them. When his food is exhausted, he will go on his own, and then take advantage of the weakness to attack him, then it will not be difficult to win, and the suffering of fatigue of the army and horses will also be avoided: plan is not good at this.","He too has been observing the stars and has concluded they augur good fortune for the Wei, so he is surprised at Kong Ming’s move – all the more so after three years of peace. The Wei ruler sends him off with instructions to only take up a defensive position.","“When you, Noble Sir, reach the banks of River Wei and have well fortified that position, you are not to give battle. The army of Shu, disappointed of their desire, will pretend to retire and so entice you on, but you will not pursue. You will wait till their supplies are consumed and they are compelled to retreat, when you may smite them. Then you will obtain the victory without distressing the army unduly. This is the best plan of campaign.”"

孔明令人密授計與魏延，一面敎拔寨齊起。楊儀曰：“今已大勝，挫盡魏兵銳氣，何故反欲收軍？”孔明曰：“吾兵無糧，利在急戰。今彼堅守不出，吾受其病矣。彼今雖暫時兵敗，中原必有添益。若以輕騎襲吾糧道，那時要歸不能。今乘魏兵新敗，不敢正視蜀兵，便可出其不意，乘機退去。所憂者但魏延一軍，在陳倉道口拒住王雙，急不能脫身；吾已令人授以密計，敎斬王雙，使魏人不敢來追。只今後隊先行。”當夜孔明只留金鼓守在寨中打更。一夜，兵已盡退，只落空營。,"Kong Ming sent a secret plan to Wei Yan, and at the same time ordered the village to be raised. Yang Yi said, ""We have already won a great victory, and the strength of Wei's troops has been defeated. Why do you want to withdraw the army?"" Kong Ming said: ""My soldiers have no food, and the advantage is in the urgent battle. Now he can't hold on, and I am sick. Temporarily defeated, the Central Plains will definitely benefit. If light cavalry attacked my grain road, then I would not be able to return. Now that the Wei soldiers are newly defeated, if they dare not face the Shu soldiers, they can be surprised and take the opportunity to retreat. The only worry is the Wei Yan army. , I refused Wang Shuang at the crossing of Chencang Road, and I couldn’t get out. I have given someone a secret plan to kill Wang Shuang, so that the Wei people dare not come after him.

CHAPTER 98 Chasing after the Shu army, Wang Shuang is killed. Taking Chencang, Kong Ming wins a battle, while Sun Quan becomes emperor. Sima Yi points out that the Shu army have over-extended their supply lines and that at the most they have a month’s supply of grain. ‘If we just wait, don’t attack or respond to intimidation, then they will have to retreat. In the disarray of retreat, we can attack and seize Kong Ming.’","Then Zhuge Liang gave orders to break camp and retreat. This move was not understood, and Yang Yi asked the leader, “O Minister, you have just scored a victory, and the enemy have lost their bravery; why retreat?” “Because we are short of food,” said Zhuge Liang. “Our success lay in swift victory, but the enemy will not fight, and thus they weaken us day by day. Though we have worsted them now, they will soon be reinforced, and their light horse can cut off our provisions. Then we could not retreat at all. For a time they will not dare look at us, and we must take the occasion to do what they do not expect, and retreat. But I am solicitous about Wei Yan, who is on the Chencang road to keep off Wang Shuang. I fear he cannot get away. I have sent him certain orders to slay Wang Shuang, and then the force of Wei will not dare to pursue.” So the retreat began, but to deceive the enemy the watchmen were left in the empty camp to beat the watches through the night. Cao Zhen was depressed at his recent misfortune. Then they told him Zhang He had come."

却說張松到了許都館驛中住定，每日去相府伺候，求見曹操。原來曹操自破馬超回，傲睨得志，每日飲宴，無事少出，國政皆在相府商議。張松候了三日，方得通姓名。左右近侍先要賄賂，却纔引入。操坐於堂上。松拜畢，操問曰：“汝主鄮璋連年不進貢，何也？”松曰：“為路途艱難，賊寇竊發，不能通進。”操叱曰：“吾掃淸中原，有何盜賊？”松曰：“南有孫權，北有張魯，西有劉備，至少者亦帶甲十餘萬，豈得為太平耶？”操先見張松人物猥瑣，五分不喜；又聞語言衝撞，遂拂袖而起，轉入後堂。左右責松曰：“汝為使命，何不知禮，一味衝撞？幸得丞相看汝遠來之面，不見罪責。汝可急速回去！”松笑曰：“吾川中無諂佞之人也！”而忽階下一人大喝曰：“汝川中不會諂佞，吾中原豈有諂佞者乎？”,"However, he said that Zhang Song had settled in the post of Xuduguan, and he went to the prime minister's residence every day to serve and ask to see Cao Cao. It turned out that Cao Cao returned from breaking Ma Chao, proud of his ambitions, feasting every day, nothing less, and the state affairs are all discussed in the prime minister's house. Zhang Song waited for three days before he got the name. The left and right attendants asked for bribes before they were introduced. Sitting in the hall. When Song had finished his worship, Cao asked, ""Why has your lord Yanzhang not paid tribute for years?"" Song said, ""Because the road is difficult, thieves and thieves have stolen hair, and I can't get in."" Cao said, ""I swept the Central Plains, and there are some What thieves?"" Song said: ""There is Sun Quan in the south, Zhang Lu in the north, Liu Bei in the west, and at least those with more than 100,000 armors, how can they be Taiping?"" The language collided, so he stood up and turned into the back hall. The left and right blamed Song and said: ""You are on a mission, why don't you know the etiquette and just collide? Fortunately, the prime minister sees the face of you from afar, and sees no guilt. You can go back quickly!"" Song said with a smile: ""There is no flattering person in my river! ""And suddenly a person at the next step shouted, ""There is no flattery in Ruchuan, how can there be flatterers in my Central Plains?""","After arriving in Xuchang, Zhang Song tries day after day to gain an audience with Cao Cao, but to no avail. Cao Cao now sees himself as so important he doesn’t bother with minor affairs. Eventually, by bribing Cao Cao’s servants, Zhang Song does gain an audience. As Zhang Song kowtows, Cao Cao asks abruptly, ‘Your master, Liu Zhang, has failed to submit any tribute for many years now. Why?’ ‘Well, you see,’ replies Zhang Song, ‘we’ve so many thieves and robbers the roads are unsafe, and so we can’t send the tribute.’ ‘What thieves and robbers? I’ve made our country safe, so how can this be?’ To which Zhang Song replies, ‘Well, in the south there is Sun Quan, in the north Zhang Lu, while to the west, of course, is Xuande. At the very least they each have over one hundred thousand men. In the light of all that, how on earth can you say the land is safe and at peace?’ Now Cao Cao already dislikes Zhang Song’s appearance and this dislike is increased by his blunt comments. Without another word, Cao Cao rises and leaves the room. His servants lecture Zhang Song on how he should have behaved, but Zhang Song simply says, ‘Sorry, but we Riverlanders from Shu in the west don’t bend and scrape’, and, so saying, he prepares to depart. At this someone speaks up, saying, ‘You lot really have no idea how to flatter, do you?’","Zhang Song arrived in Xuchang, and, after he had established himself in his lodging, he made daily visits to the Prime Minister's palace to try to obtain an interview. But the last success had filled Cao Cao with insufferable pride, and he did nothing but give banquets. He never appeared except for the most important affairs, and even carried on the business of the state in his own residence. So Zhang Song waited many days. But when he got to know the persons who were nearest the Prime Minister, he bribed them and obtained an audience. Cao Cao was seated in the high place, and after his visitor had finished his salutations, he said, “Your master Liu Zhang has sent no tribute for several years; why?” “Because the roads are dangerous and thieves and robbers infest them. Intercourse is restricted.” Cao Cao interrupted in a loud harsh voice, saying, “What thieves and robbers are there when I have cleansed the empire?” “How can you say the land is tranquil when one sees Sun Quan in the south, Zhang Lu and Liu Bei in the west, and every one of these with armies reckoned in legions? The weakest of them has one hundred thousand troops.” The mean appearance of the emissary had prejudiced Cao Cao from the outset; and when Cao Cao heard these blunt words, he suddenly shook out his sleeves, rose and left the hall. Those in attendance were annoyed with Zhang Song and said, “How can you behave so rudely when you come on a mission? Your whole attitude was blunt and discourteous. Happily for you, our lord remembered you had come from afar and did not take open notice of your fault. The best thing for you is to go home again as quickly as you can.” But Zhang Song smiled. “We have no plausible flatterers and glib talkers in our western country,” said he. At this, one from below the steps called out, “So you call us plausible and glib then; and you have none such in your country, eh?”"

却說陣武與龐德大戰，後面又無應兵，被龐德趕至峪口，樹林叢密；陣武再欲回身交戰，被樹株抓住袍袖，不能迎敵，為龐德所殺。曹操見孫權走脫了，自策馬驅兵，趕到江邊對射。呂蒙箭盡。正慌間，忽對江一宗船到，為首一員大將，乃孫策女壻陸遜，自引十萬兵到；一陣射退曹兵，乘勢登岸追殺曹兵，復奪戰馬數千匹——曹兵傷者，不計其數，大敗而回——於亂軍中尋見陳武屍首。,"However, it is said that Zhenwu fought Pang De, and there were no soldiers behind him. He was driven by Pang De to Yukou, where the woods were dense. kill. Cao Cao saw that Sun Quan had escaped, so he drove his horse and drove his troops to the riverside to shoot. Lu Meng's arrows are exhausted. In the midst of a panic, a boat from Jiang’s army suddenly arrived, and the leading general, Sun Ce’s daughter, Lu Xun, brought in 100,000 troops; he shot back Cao’s soldiers, took advantage of the situation to land on the shore to hunt down Cao’s soldiers, and regained thousands of horses. - Cao Bing's wounded, innumerable, returned from defeat - Chen Wu's corpse was found in the chaotic army.","Both of them are badly wounded and only just make it onto the rescue boat. Just as it seems inevitable that Cao’s men will overwhelm the southerners, Lu Xun, the son-in-law of Sun Ce, appears with one hundred thousand men and drives Cao’s men back. The Wei suffer terrible losses, and thousands of their horses are seized by the triumphant Wu. However, great sadness descends upon Sun Quan when the body of Chen Wu is found lying upon the battlefield.","Now Chen Wu had engaged the legion under Pang De. Being inferior in force and no aid being forthcoming, Chen Wu was forced into a valley where the trees and undergrowth were very dense. He tried to turn, but was caught by the branches, and while so entangled he was killed by Pang De. When Cao Cao saw that Sun Quan had escaped from the battle to the river bank, he urged his steed forward in pursuit. He sent flights of arrows toward the fugitives. By this time Lu Meng's troops had emptied their quivers, and he began to be very anxious. But just then a fleet of ships sailed up led by Lu Xun, the son-in-law of Sun Ce, who came with one hundred thousand marines and drove back Cao Cao's army. Then he landed to pursue. He captured many thousands of horses and slew many men, so that Cao Cao was quite defeated and retired. Then they sought and found the body of Chen Wu among the slain."
玄德看畢大喜，設宴相待法正。酒過數巡，玄德屏退左右，密謂正曰：“久仰孝直英名，張別駕多談盛德。今獲聽敎，甚慰平生。”法正謝曰：“蜀中小吏，何足道哉！蓋聞馬逢伯樂而嘶，人遇知己而死。張別駕昔日之言，將軍復有意乎？”玄德曰：“備一身寄客，未嘗不傷感而歎息。嘗思鷦鷯尚存一枝，狡兔猶藏三窟，何況人乎？蜀中豐餘之地，非不欲取；奈劉季玉係備同宗，不忍相圖。”法正曰：“益州天府之國，非治亂之主，不可居也。今劉季玉不能用賢，此業不久必屬他人。今日自付與將軍，不可錯失。豈不聞‘逐兔先得’之語乎？將軍欲取，某當効死。”玄德拱手謝曰：“尚容商議。”,"Xuande was overjoyed when he saw Bi, and held a banquet to treat Fazheng. After a few rounds of drinking, Xuande retreated to the left and right, and secretly said: ""I have long admired the reputation of filial piety, and Zhang Biejia talked more about the virtues. Now that I have heard the instructions, I am very comforted in my life."" Gai heard that horses neigh when they meet Bole, and people die when they meet confidants. Zhang Biejia’s words in the past, does the general have any meaning again?” Xuande said: “Prepare a suit to send guests, and I don’t feel sad and sigh. , the cunning rabbit still hides three caves, how much more people? There is plenty of land in the middle of Shu, and it is not unwilling to take it; but Liu Jiyu is prepared with the same clan, and cannot bear to take pictures."" Fazheng said: ""Yizhou, the country of Tianfu, is not the master of chaos. It’s impossible to live in. Today Liu Jiyu can’t use virtuous people, and this career will soon belong to others. Today, I give it to the general, so don’t miss it. Haven’t you heard the saying 'the rabbit is first served'? De bowed his hands and said, ""Shangrong to discuss.""","Fa Zheng brings to the court of Xuande a formal letter from Liu asking for his kinsman’s help in destroying the threat from Zhang Lu. Over dinner that night Xuande comments, ‘I find it so hard to even contemplate the idea of attacking someone who is from the same imperial family as me.’ ‘My lord,’ Fa Zheng responds, ‘Liu Zhang has every possible natural advantage yet he is incapable of ruling. If you do not come to the rescue others will seize the country from him. To be honest it is as if the land is being presented to you.’","This letter greatly pleased Liu Bei. He made a banquet for the bearer thereof, and when they had mellowed themselves with wine, he dismissed the attendants and spoke to Fa Zheng in confidence. “Friend, I have long admired you, and Zhang Song extolled your virtues. I shall always feel grateful for this opportunity of hearing you.” Fa Zheng bowed, saying, “That is too great praise for a humble emissary from Shu. But they say that horses always neighed in recognition of Bo Le, the supreme judge of horses, and when a person has found his lord, he dies for him. Have you thought further of Zhang Song's proposals, General?” “I have always been a wanderer, often in suffering and sorrow. I have often thought of the wren for even that tiny bird has a twig to rest on; and of the cunning hare, that secures safety with three openings to its burrow. Does not a person need at least a shelter? Your land of the west is fertile and a temptation, but its ruler is of my family, and I cannot plot against him.” “Yes; Yiazhou is a very paradise. But without a ruler it cannot exist. Liu Zhang knows not how to use the wise people, and his heritage must speedily pass to another. Today it is offered to your hands, and you must not miss the opportunity. You know the saying, that the leader in the hunt gets the quarry. If you will only consent, I will serve you to the death.” Liu Bei signified his gratitude. Said he, “Let me reflect for a time and take advice.”"

華歆引李伏、許芝近前奏曰：“陛下若不信，可問此二人。”李伏奏曰：“自魏王卽位以來，麒麟降生，鳳凰來儀，黃龍出現，嘉禾蔚生，甘露下降：此是上天示瑞，魏當代漢之象也。”許芝又奏曰：“臣等職掌司天，夜觀乾象，見炎漢氣數已終，陛下帝星隱匿不明；魏國乾象，極天察地，言之難盡。更兼上應圖讖。其讖曰：‘鬼在邊，委相連；當代漢，無可言。言在東，午在西；兩日並光上下移。’以此論之，陛下可早禪位。‘鬼在邊’，‘委相連’，是‘魏’字也；‘言在東，午在西’，乃‘許’字也；‘兩日並光上下移’，乃‘昌’字也：此是魏在許昌應受漢禪也。願陛下察之。”帝曰：“祥瑞圖讖，皆虛妄之事；奈何以虛妄之事，而遽欲朕舍祖宗之基業乎？”王朗奏曰：“自古以來，有興必有廢，有盛必有衰。豈有不亡之國、不敗之家乎？漢室相傳四百餘年，延至陛下，氣數已盡，宜早退避，不可遲疑；遲則生變矣。”帝大哭，入後殿去了。百官哂笑而退。,"Hua Xin cited Li Fu and Xu Zhi for a prelude and said, ""If Your Majesty doesn't believe me, you can ask these two people."" Li Fu said, ""Since the reign of King Wei, unicorns have been born, phoenixes have come to ceremonies, yellow dragons have appeared, and Jiahe has been born. , Nectar descends: This is the heaven showing Rui, the image of Wei and the contemporary Han."" Xu Zhi also played: ""The minister and other officials are in charge of the sky, watching the Qianxiang at night, seeing the end of the Yan Han Qi, Your Majesty's Emperor Star is hidden and unknown; Elephant, the sky and the earth are indescribably hard to describe. In addition, it should be a prophecy. The prophecy says: 'The ghosts are on the side, the committees are connected; the contemporary Han is speechless. The words are in the east, the afternoon is in the west; Shift.' On this basis, His Majesty can take the position of Zen early. 'The ghost is on the side', 'the committee is connected', is the word 'Wei'; Two days and the light will move up and down', which is also the word for 'Chang': this is Wei who should receive Han Chan in Xuchang. I hope your majesty will check it."" The emperor said: ""The auspicious pictures and prophecies are all false things; but why use false things, And do you want to give up the foundation of our ancestors?"" Wang Lang said: ""Since ancient times, if there is prosperity, there will be failure, and if there is prosperity, there will be decline. Is there a country that will not perish, and a family that will not be defeated? If it is delayed until Your Majesty, the anger is exhausted, it is advisable to retreat early, and do not hesitate; Baiguan laughed and retreated.","Eventually he says, sobbing, ‘I cannot but think back to the Supreme Ancestor and how through his actions he overcame Qin and defeated utterly the Chu and established this dynasty, which has passed from generation to generation down through the Liu family for four hundred years. Although I have little talent, what is it that I have done that is so wrong? So wrong that I have to surrender that which has been passed down to me from my ancestors? Go back and consider all this again.’ In response, Hua Xin brings forward two astrologers, who describe the auspicious signs mentioned earlier and claim that this proves that Heaven has taken the mandate to rule from the Han and given it to the Wei. However, the emperor dismisses these signs and interpretations without further consideration only to be confronted by another of Cao Cao’s advisers, Wang Lang, who says: ‘Ever since time began, what grows must also die. What has been successful must fail. Every dynasty ends, and every family falls. Your house has ruled for over four hundred years.","Then Hua Xin led forward Xu Zhi and Li Fu nearer the throne, saying, “If Your Majesty thinks we may be mistaken, pray ask these two, who will explain.” Said Li Fu, “Since the Prince of Wei has taken his seat, the Linlion has descended, the Phoenix has appeared, the yellow Dragon has come forth, the Grain of Felicity has flourished, and Sweet Dew has watered the earth. All these things augur that Heaven decrees a change and Wei must replace Han.” Xu Zhi continued, “The astrologers, watching the aspect of the skies at night, have seen the blazing light of the star of Han gradually fade away and Your Majesty's own star become dim. On the other hand, the aspect of the sky and the attitude of the earth have been wholly bright in favor of Wei to a degree hard to state in words. Moreover, the lots have been cast, and they gave the word 'Devil , at the side, has been sent, there must be an inroad upon Han without word'; another lot, 'Word, in east, light moves west, two suns radiating as the air blows south.' These oracles gave two words which, joined, compose Xu; 'two suns, one on the other,' which is Chang. These signs are unmistakeable, for when put together the whole reads, ' Wei at Xuchang is to receive the abdication of Han.' If you consider, Your Majesty must admit this.” “All empty words and madness, this talk of auguries and lots! Is it reasonable that I should suddenly abandon the great heritage for such nonsense?” Then Wang Lang said, “Wax and wane has been the law of all things from the beginning; every period of glory is followed by one of obscurity. Has any rule endured forever or any House never failed? The rule of Han, handed down through four centuries to Yourself, has lost its vigor, and the time has come to yield. Retirement may not be delayed or confusion will ensue.”"

Kong Ming raised the tent and called the generals, saying: ""I expect that the Wei soldiers will leave, and the Wei master will send an edict to take Cao Zhen and Sima Yi back. If I pursue him, I must be prepared; it is better to let him go and make a good plan. ""Suddenly Wang Ping sent someone to report, saying that the Wei soldiers had returned. Confucius sent people and passed it on to Wang Ping: ""You can't pursue it, I have a plan to break the Wei army."" It is:","When an imperial command comes telling them to abandon the attempt and return home, everyone is delighted but also aware of the risks of a counter-attack by Shu.","Now Zhuge Liang had reckoned upon this month of rain and so had had his troops camped in a safe place.

Kong Ming said, ""The king has agreed to the request, so he can build a platform to choose auspiciousness and honor him."" Xu Ci and the counselor Meng Guang saluted and built a platform in the south of Wudan in Chengdu. All things are ready, many officials have set up Luan Jia, and invited the King of Hanzhong to the altar to make sacrifices. Qiao Zhou stood on the altar and read the sacrificial text aloud, saying:","Whereupon Kong Ming immediately leaps up from his sickbed and, throwing aside a screen, reveals that gathered behind, listening to every word, are the court officials and commanders. Right on cue they prostrate themselves and shout, ‘As you wish! Just let us now choose the coronation day!’ ‘You have tricked me,’ cries the king, ‘and what you ask is disreputable.’ Kong Ming replies, ‘But, Your Majesty, you have now consented, so we must go and build the altar and choose the auspicious day for the rituals of coronation!’","The Prince was greatly startled, and said, “You are committing me to doing what is dishonorable!” But Zhuge Liang said, “Since consent has been given, let a terrace be built and a day chosen for the great ceremony.” The Prince was escorted back to his palace, and Academician Xu Ci and Minister Meng Guang were told off to see to the building of the terrace south of Chengdu. And when all was ready, a great concourse of officers solemnly escorted the Prince, seated in a carriage of the imperial pattern, to the ground prepared, and he went up to the altar and performed the appointed sacrifice. This done, the solemn announcement was read in a loud voice:"
晉主覽疏，遂與羣臣議曰：“王公之論，與羊都督暗合。朕意決矣。”侍中王渾奏曰：“臣聞孫皓欲北上，軍伍已皆整備，聲勢正盛，難與爭鋒。更遲一年以待其疲，方可成功。”晉主依其奏，乃降詔止兵莫動，退入後宮，與祕書丞張華圍棋消遣。近臣奏邊庭有表到。晉主開視之，乃杜預表也。表略云：,"The Lord of Jin looked at the sparseness, and then discussed with the ministers: ""The prince's argument is in secret with the governor of the sheep. I have decided."" The king of the attendant said: ""I heard that Sun Hao wants to go north, and the army has been prepared and has momentum. It is difficult to compete with each other when it is prosperous. It will take a year to wait until it is exhausted before it can succeed."" The Jin master followed his instructions, and ordered the troops to stop moving, retreated into the harem, and played games with Zhang Hua, the secretary. The close minister played the side court to have a watch. The Jin Lord opened his eyes to it, and it was a foreshadowing of Du. The table is a little bit cloudy:","Yet Sima Yan, ruler of Jin, cannot make up his mind whether to attack. Sometimes he is for it, then an adviser will make some objection, and he will change his mind. Then one day a memorial comes from Du Yu. He essentially argues that unless they attack now, the south will invade them. And so at last Sima Yan decides to go to war. Immediately he sends commanders and troops in many directions, each with a Wu city to attack – Du Yu against Jiangling; Sima Zhou against Tuzhong; Wang Hun against Hengjiang; Wang Rong against Wuchang; Hu Fen against Xiakou, while the navy is sent down the river to attack as well under the command of Admiral Wang Jun.","I pray Your Majesty not to miss the tide.” At the next assembly of officers Sima Yan said to them, “I have decided to act; I have received similar advice from Yang Hu and Wang Jun.” At this arose Minister Wang Hun and said, “I hear Sun Hao intends to march north to the Middle Land and has his army ready. Report says it is formidable and would be hard to defeat. I counsel to await another year till that army has lost its first vigor.” A command to cease warlike preparations was the result of this counsel. The Ruler of Jin betook himself to his private chamber where he engaged in a game of chess with Zhang Hua as opponent. While at the game, another memorial arrived; it was from Du Yu. It read:"
維忿忿而出，卽往見郤正，備將此事告之。正曰：“將軍禍不遠矣。將軍若危，國家隨滅。”維曰：“先生幸敎我以保國安身之策。”正曰：“隴西有一去處，名曰沓中：此地極其肥壯。將軍何不效武侯屯田之事，奏知天子，前去沓中屯田？一者：得麥熟以助軍實；二者，可以盡圖隴右諸郡；三者，魏人不敢正視漢中；四者，將軍在外掌握兵權，人不能圖，可以避禍：此乃保國安身之策也，宜早行之。”維大喜，謝曰：“先生金玉之言也。”次日，姜維表奏後主，求沓中屯田，效武侯之事。後主從之。維遂還漢中，聚諸將曰：“某累出師，因糧不足，未能成功。今吾提兵八萬，往沓中種麥屯田，徐圖進取。汝等久戰勞苦，今日斂兵聚穀，退守漢中；魏兵千里運糧，經涉山嶺，自然疲乏；疲乏必退：那時乘虛追襲，無不勝矣。”遂令胡濟守漢壽城，王含守樂城，蔣斌守漢城，蔣舒、傅僉同守關隘。分撥已畢，維自引兵八萬，來沓中種麥，以為久計。,"Wei came out angrily, but when he went to see it, he was right, and was ready to report the matter. Zheng said: ""The general disaster is not far away. If the general is in danger, the country will be destroyed."" Wei said: ""Sir, it is fortunate that you have taught me to protect the country."" Zheng said: ""There is a place in Longxi, called Tazhong: this place is extremely Fat and strong. Why didn’t the general follow the matter of the Marquis Wu’s arranging the fields and report to the Son of Heaven, and go to Tazhong to stow fields? One: the wheat is cooked to help the army; Face Hanzhong squarely; the fourth is that the generals hold military power outside, and people can’t take pictures, but they can avoid disasters: this is a strategy to protect the country and safety, and it should be done early.” Wei was overjoyed and thanked: “Mr. Jinyu’s words.” The next day , Jiang Wei expressed the postmaster, asking Dazhong to settle the fields, and follow the affairs of Marquis Wu. The master follows it. Weisui returned to Hanzhong, and gathered his generals and said, ""I am tired of leaving the division, but due to lack of food, I have not succeeded. Today, I have raised 80,000 troops and planted wheat and fields in the middle of the pile. Soldiers gathered in the valley and retreated to Hanzhong; Wei soldiers transported grain for thousands of miles and traveled through the mountains, and they were naturally tired; when they were exhausted, they would retreat: at that time, they would be invincible in pursuit."" Hu Ji was then ordered to guard Hanshoucheng, Wang Han to guard Lecheng, Jiang Bin to guard Hancheng, and Jiang Bin to guard Hancheng. Shu and Fu Yan guarded the pass together. After the allocation was completed, Wei brought in 80,000 troops to plant wheat in the middle of the pile, thinking it was a long-term plan.","‘Huang Hao is simply my servant,’ says the second ruler. ‘ He is no threat whatsoever. I do hope you have not taken against him.’ But Jiang Wei is not swayed and warns the second ruler that terrible consequences will ensue if the man is not killed. ‘We live and let live – I hope you can abide by that,’ says the second ruler, and he calls Huang Hao to come out of hiding. Grovelling on the ground before Jiang Wei, Huang Hao claims he only ever tries to be of service to the kingdom and has no interest in interfering in public affairs.","Outside he sought his friend Xi Zheng and told him what had happened. “General, you are in grave danger,” said Xi Zheng. “And if you fall, the country falls with you.” “Can you advise me?” said Jiang Wei. “How can I secure the state and myself?” Xi Zheng replied, “There is a place of refuge for you in Longxi, and that is Tazhong. It is a rich country, and you can make a cantonment there like the Martial Lord did. Request the Emperor to let you go thither. You can gather in corn and wheat for your armies, you can secure all the west of Longyou, you can keep Wei from troubling Hanzhong, you will retain your military authority, so that no one will dare intrigue against you, and you will be safe. Thus you can ensure the safety of the state and yourself. You should lose no time.” “Your speech is gold and jewels,” said Jiang Wei, gratefully. Without loss of time, Jiang Wei memorialized the Throne and obtained the Latter Ruler's consent. Then he returned to Hanzhong, assembled his officers, and told them his plans. “Our many expeditions have failed to achieve success owing to lack of supplies. Now I am about to take eighty thousand troops to Tazhong to form a cantonment and grow wheat and corn ready for the next expedition. You are spent with much fighting and may now repose while collecting grain and guarding Hanzhong. The armies of Wei are from home and have to drag their grain over the mountains. They will be worn out with the labor and must soon retire. That will he the time to smite them, and success must be ours.” Hu Ji was set over Hanshou, Wang Han over Yuecheng, Jiang Bin over Hancheng, and Jiang Shu and Fu Qian went to guard the passes. After these arrangements had been made, Jiang Wei went off to Tazhong to grow grain and mature his plans."

Xiu, whose courtesy name is Zilie, is the sixth son of Sun Quan. He was in the tiger forest at night and dreamed of riding a dragon to the sky. Looking back, he could not see the tail of the dragon, and he was startled. The next day, Sun Kai and Dong Chao arrived and asked to return to the capital. On the way to Qu'a, there was an old man who claimed his surname Gan and Xiu. When they arrived at Busseting, General Sun En came to greet them. Xio did not dare to take the chariot, so he entered in a small car. Baiguan greeted him by the side of the road, and Xio hurriedly got out of the car to greet him. When Sun Chen came out, he ordered him to help him up. Please enter the main hall and ascend the throne to the throne of the emperor. Xio repeatedly humbly yielded, only to receive the jade seal. The civil officials and military generals, the court congratulations have been completed, the world is amnesty, and the first year of Yuan Yong'an is changed; Sun Chen is appointed as the prime minister, the minister of Jingzhou; many officials have their own awards; and the elder brother's son Sun Hao is named Wucheng Hou. Sun Chen has a family of five princes, all of whom are banned from the army and have power over the people. Sun Xiu, the master of Wu, feared that it would change from within. The arrogance is getting worse.","Now Sun Chen simply seizes all power, appointing his relatives to all the key positions. He brings to court a bewildered relative of the deposed ruler and against his wish has this man, Sun Xiu, made ruler. It is the year AD 258, and Sun Chen is made prime minister. Much later that year, slighted by something the poor innocent ruler has done, Sun Chen decides to go the final step and seize imperial power for himself. Alarmed by what he sees happening, the ruler, Sun Xiu, calls for help from his adviser Zhang Bu.","Sun Chen then sent two ministers of the court, Sun Kai and Dong Chao, went as envoys to Hulin to request Sun Xiu, Prince of Langye, the sixth son of Sun Quan, to ascend the throne. The Emperor-elect had had some premonition of the high honor to which he was now called, for in a dream he saw he ascended into the skies seated on a dragon. Only the dragon seemed to have no tail. He woke up in a fright, and the next day brought the Imperial Envoys, Sun Kai and Dong Chao. Sun Xiu set out. At Que his carriage was stopped by a venerable old man who claimed to be Gan Xiu and offered felicitations. “Your Majesty should move faster, for things may change swiftly,” said the aged one. Sun Xiu thanked the old man. At Busai Pavilion awaited Sun En with a chariot, but Sun Xiu's modesty would not allow him to mount it. He remained in his own simple carriage and therein traveled to the Palace. Officials lined the road to salute him, and he dismounted to return their salutations. Then Sun Chen stood forth and bade them take the newly-elected Emperor by the arm and lead him into the Great Hall, where, after thrice refusing the honor, he at last took his seat in the Dragon Throne and received the jade seal passed from one ruler to another. When all the officers had made obeisance, there were the usual amnesties, promotions, and honors, and Eternal Tranquillity, the first year (AD 258), was the name of the new reign. Sun Chen was confirmed as Prime Minister, with the Protectorship of Jingzhou. Moreover, Sun Hao, the son of his elder brother, was created Lord of Wucheng. Sun Chen, with five persons in his family holding lordships and the whole army under their command, was immensely powerful, able to set up and pull down at will. The new Ruler of Wu, Sun Xiu, secretly feared him; and although outwardly he showed Sun Chen great favor, yet he kept careful watch over Sun Chen, whose arrogance knew no bounds."
却說張郃、戴陵領兵前來，驟如風雨。馬忠、張嶷、吳懿、吳班四將接着，出馬交鋒。張郃大怒，驅兵追殺。蜀兵且戰且走，魏兵追趕約有二十餘里，時值六月天氣，十分炎熱，人馬汗如潑水。走到五十里外，魏兵盡皆氣喘。孔明在山上把紅旗一招，關興引兵殺出。馬忠等四將，一齊引兵掩殺回來。張郃、戴陵死戰不退。忽然喊聲大震，兩路軍殺出：乃王平、張翼也。各奮勇追殺，截其後路。郃大叫衆將曰：“汝等到此，不決一死戰，更待何時！”魏兵奮力衝突，不得脫身。忽然背後鼓角喧天，司馬懿自領精兵殺到。懿指揮衆將，把王平、張翼困在垓心。翼大呼曰：“丞相眞神人也！計已算定，必有良謀。吾等當決一死戰！”卽分兵兩路：平引一軍截住張郃、戴陵，翼引一軍力當司馬懿。兩頭死戰，叫殺連天。姜維、廖化在山上探望，見魏兵勢大，蜀兵力危，漸漸抵當不住。維謂化曰：“如此危急，可開錦囊看計。”二人拆開視之，內書云：“若司馬懿兵來圍王平、張翼至急，汝二人可分兵兩枝，竟襲司馬懿之營，懿必急退，汝可乘亂攻之。營雖不得，可獲全勝。”二人大喜，卽分兵兩路，逕襲司馬懿營中而去。,"But it was said that Zhang He and Dai Ling led the troops to come, and it was like a storm. The four generals Ma Zhong, Zhang Yi, Wu Yi, and Wu Ban went on to confront each other. Zhang He was furious and chased after him. The soldiers of Shu fought and walked, and the soldiers of Wei chased for about twenty li. It was June, and the weather was very hot, and the people and horses were sweating like water. Fifty miles away, the Wei soldiers were all out of breath. Kong Ming swung the red flag on the mountain, and Guan Xing led his troops out. Ma Zhong and the other four generals led their troops to cover up and came back together. Zhang He and Dai Ling did not retreat. Suddenly there was a loud shout, and two troops rushed out: Wang Ping and Zhang Yi. Each bravely chases and kills, cutting the way. He shouted to all the generals: ""You wait here, if you don't decide to fight to the death, what time will you wait!"" Wei Bing fought hard and could not escape. All of a sudden, the drums and horns in the back were loud, and Sima Yi led his elite soldiers to kill him. Yi commanded the generals and trapped Wang Ping and Zhang Yi in Gai Xin. Yi shouted: ""The prime minister is really a god! The plan has been settled, and there must be a good plan. We should fight to the death!"" The two sides fought to the death, called Killing Liantian. Jiang Wei and Liao Hua visited on the mountain and saw that Wei's forces were strong and Shu's forces were in danger, and they gradually became unstoppable. Wei said to Hua, ""It's so critical, you can open your kit to see the plan."" The two opened it and looked at it, and the book said: ""If Sima Yi's troops come to surround Wang Ping and Zhang Yi in a hurry, the two of you can divide your troops into two branches. If you attack Sima Yi's camp, Yi will retreat quickly, and you can take advantage of the chaos to attack it. Even if the camp fails, you can achieve complete victory."" The two of them were overjoyed, and they split their troops and attacked Sima Yi's camp.","So he accepts and he is back in all his formal positions of power. However, to his frustration he cannot now entice Sima Yi to engage with him. No amount of taunting draws any of the Wei troops out to battle. So Kong Ming gives orders for his men to pack up and ‘retreat’ – or rather pretend to retreat in order to draw the enemy out. Sima Yi is determined not to be tricked again by Kong Ming, but his commanders are becoming restless through inaction and long for battle. When news comes that Kong Ming has apparently retreated, they are jubilant and press for permission to wipe out the departing army. But Sima Yi is cautious. He discovers that the enemy have only retreated a short distance and fears a trap. For three days spies report on the slow movement of the Shu army, until his commanders can bear it no longer and demand action. Sima Yi gives in and orders an all-out attack. Despite Sima Yi’s best efforts and schemes, Kong Ming once again outwits him and inflicts a crushing defeat upon the Wei troops, including sacking Sima Yi’s own camp.","Zhang He and Dai Ling hurried along like a rain squall till they were suddenly confronted by Ma Zhong, Zhang Ni, Wu Yi, and Wu Ban. Zhang He dashed toward his enemy, and then they retired, stopping at intervals to fight. The Wei army pursued for about seven miles. It was the sixth moon and very hot, so that soldiers and horses sweated profusely. When they had gone ten miles farther, the soldiers and horses were panting and nearly spent. Then Zhuge Liang, who had watched the fighting from a hill, gave the signal for Guan Xing to emerge and join battle. Ma Zhong, Zhang Ni, Wu Ban, and Wu Yi all led on their troops. Zhang He and Dai Ling fought well, but they could not extricate themselves and retire. Presently, with a roll of drums, Wang Ping and Zhang Yi came out and made for the rear to cut the retreat. “Why do you not fight to death?” shouted Zhang He to his generals when he saw the new dangers. The soldiers of Wei dashed this way and that, but were stayed at every attempt. Then there was heard another roll of drums, and Sima Yi came up in the rear. He at once signaled to his generals to surround Wang Ping and Zhang Yi. “Our minister is truly wonderful. The battle goes just as he foretold,” cried Zhang Yi. “He will surely send help now, and we will fight to the death.” Thereupon the Shu force were divided into two parties. Wang Ping led one army to hold up Zhang He and Dai Ling; Zhang Yi led the other division to oppose Sima Yi. On both sides the fighting was keen and continued all the day. From their station on a hill, Jiang Wei and Liao Hua watched the battle. They saw that the Wei force was very strong and their side was in danger and slowly giving way. “Now surely is the moment to open the bag,” said Jiang Wei. So the bag was opened, and they read the letter. It said: “If Sima Yi comes and Wang Ping and Zhang Yi seem hard pressed, you are to divide forces and go off to attack Sima Yi's camp, which will cause him to retire, and then you can attack him as his army is in disorder. The actual capture of the camp is not of great moment.” So Jiang Wei and Liao Hua divided the force and started for the enemy's camp."

却說黃忠聽知夏侯尚、韓浩來，遂引軍馬出營。韓浩在陣前，大罵黃忠：“無義老賊！”拍馬挺鎗，來取黃忠。夏侯尚便出夾攻。黃忠力戰二將，各鬥十餘合，黃忠敗走。二將趕二十餘里，奪了黃忠營寨。忠又草創一營。次日，夏侯尚、韓浩趕來，忠又出陣，戰數合，又敗走。二將又趕二十餘里，奪了黃忠營寨，喚張郃守後寨。郃來前寨諫曰：“黃忠連退二日，於中必有詭計。”夏侯尚叱張郃曰：“你如此膽怯，可知屢次戰敗！今再休多言，看吾二人建功！”張郃羞赧而退。次日，二將又戰，黃忠又敗退二十里；二將迤邐趕上。次日，二將兵出，黃忠望風而走：連敗數陣，直退在關上。二將扣關下寨，黃忠堅守不出。孟達暗暗發書，申報玄德，說：“黃忠連輸數陣，見今退在關上。”玄德慌問孔明。孔明曰：“此乃老將驕兵之計也。”趙雲等不信。玄德差劉封來關上接應黃忠。忠與封相見，問劉封曰：“小將軍來助戰何意？”封曰：“父親得知將軍數敗，故差某來。”忠笑曰：“此老夫驕兵之計也。看今夜一陣，可盡復諸營，奪其糧食馬匹。此是借寨與彼屯輜重耳。今夜留霍峻守關，孟將軍可與我搬糧草奪馬匹。小將軍看我破敵。”,"However, Huang Zhong heard that Xiahoushang and Han Hao were coming, so he led the troops out of the camp. In front of the battle, Han Hao scolded Huang Zhong: ""Unrighteous old thief!"" Xia Houshang attacked. Huang Zhong fought against the two generals, each fighting more than ten times, and Huang Zhong was defeated. The second general drove more than twenty li and captured Huangzhong's camp. Loyalty created a camp again. The next day, Xia Houshang and Han Hao came, Zhong fought again, the battle was combined, and he was defeated. The two generals drove another twenty li, seized Huangzhong's camp, and called Zhang He to guard the rear. He came to Qianzhai and said, ""Huang Zhong retreated for two days in a row, and there must be a trick in the middle."" Xiahou Shang said to Zhang He: ""You are so timid, you know that you have been defeated many times! Now let's stop talking and see the two of us make contributions!"" Zhang He was ashamed. and retreat. The next day, the two generals fought again, and Huang Zhong was defeated and retreated twenty li; the two generals caught up. The next day, the second generals came out, and Huang Zhong looked at the wind and walked away: losing streak for a few times, and retreating straight to Guanshang. The second general buckled the gate and went down to the village, but Huang Zhong could not hold on to it. Meng Da secretly issued a letter to declare Xuande, saying: ""Huang Zhong has lost several times in a row, and I see that he is retreating at the gate now."" Xuande asked Kongming in a panic. Kong Ming said: ""This is the plan of the veteran general's arrogant soldiers."" Zhao Yun and others did not believe it. Xuande sent Liu Feng to the gate to meet Huang Zhong. Zhong and Feng met each other and asked Liu Feng, ""What's the point of the little general coming to help in the war?"" Feng said, ""My father learned that the generals were defeated, so he sent someone to come."" Zhong laughed and said, ""This old man is arrogant. If you look at it for a while tonight, you can restore all the camps and grab their food and horses. This is to use the fortress and the pit to transport the ears. Leave Huo Jun to guard the gate tonight, and General Meng can move grain and grass with me to grab the horses. The little general sees me defeating the enemy. ""","Huang Zhong then sets in place the other part of the plot. Challenging Xiahou Shang and Han Hao to battle, he then turns and flees, pursued by the enemy. He abandons one of his camps to them. The next day he again flees and again abandons another camp. Zhang He begins to be suspicious but is firmly put in his place by Xiahou Shang, who calls him a coward for having lost so many battles. ‘Watch,’ he says, ‘as we show you how it is done and earn ourselves fame!’ The next day Huang Zhong once again retreats until at last he can go no further, as he is up against the pass. Kong Ming hears of this and reassures a troubled Xuande that this is all part of a plan to lull the enemy into false expectations. And sure enough, in the middle of the next night, Huang Zhong attacks with five thousand of his men. Catching the enemy completely by surprise, he sweeps them before him, and by the time the sun rises he has regained all three camps and all the goods and chattels that the enemy have stored there. By pressing hard upon the enemy, Huang Zhong pushes the northern troops right to the banks of the Han River.","At news of the coming of new armies, Huang Zhong marched out to meet them. He found Han Hao in front of his array, and Han Hao began to abuse the veteran, shouting out, “Disgraceful old ruffian!” Then Han Hao whipped up his steed and set his spear at Huang Zhong. Xiahou Shang also rode out and took part in the combat. The veteran held them both at bay for some half score bouts and then fled. They pursued him for seven miles, when they reached and seized his camp. Huang Zhong, however, quickly made another defense of brushwood. Next day Xiahou Shang and Han Hao renewed the pursuit, which ended with the capture of the temporary camp of the day before. And they had advanced seven miles further. Then they called upon Zhang He to protect the rear camp. When Zhang He came up, he dissuaded them from continuing. “Huang Zhong has retreated before you for two days; there is some deep stratagem behind this,” said Zhang He. Xiahou Shang scoffed at him, saying, “You are such a coward that you have been defeated many times. Now say no more, but let us accomplish something.” Zhang He retired much mortified and shamed. Next day the two generals again went out to battle, and again Huang Zhong fled from them for seven miles. The two generals pursued as quickly as they could. The day after, Huang Zhong fled without any pretense of showing fight, except at short intervals. He got to Jiameng Pass and went on the defensive. The pursuers knocked at the very gate of the Pass and made a camp close by. Then Meng Da secretly wrote to Liu Bei that Huang Zhong had been repeatedly defeated and now was in the Pass and unable to go out. Liu Bei became alarmed and consulted Zhuge Liang, who said, “The old general is making the enemy over-confident—to their ultimate destruction.” But Zhao Yun did not share this opinion, nor did many others, and Liu Bei decided to send Liu Feng to reinforce his aged general. The young man came to the Pass and saw Huang Zhong, who asked him, “General, what makes you come here?” “My father heard that you have sustained several defeats, and he has sent me,” said Liu Feng. “But I am only employing the ruse of leading on the enemy,” said Huang Zhong, smiling. “You will see tonight that in one battle I shall regain all the camps and capture their supplies and many horses. I have only lent the camps to them to store their supplies. Tonight I shall leave Huo Jun to guard the Pass, while General Meng Da will gather up the spoils for us. Now, young Sir, you shall see the destruction of the enemy.”"
韓當、周泰聽知先主御駕來征，引兵出迎。兩陣對圓，韓當、周泰出馬，只見蜀營門旗開處，先主自出，黃羅銷金傘蓋，左右白旄黃鉞，金銀旌節，前後圍繞。當大叫曰：“陛下今為蜀主，何自輕出？倘有疎虞，悔之何及！”先主遙指罵曰：“汝等吳狗，傷朕手足，誓不與立於天地之間！”當回顧衆將曰：“誰敢衝突蜀兵？”部將夏恂，挺鎗出馬。先主背後張苞挺丈八矛，縱馬而出，大喝一聲，直取夏恂。恂見苞聲若巨雷，心中驚懼；恰待要走，周泰弟周平見恂抵敵不住，揮刀縱馬而來。關興見了，躍馬提刀來迎。張苞大喝一聲，一矛刺中夏恂，倒撞下馬。周平大驚，措手不及，被關興一刀斬了。二小將便取韓當、周泰。韓、周二人，慌退入陣。先主見之，歎曰：“虎父無犬子也！”用御鞭一指，蜀兵一齊掩殺過去，吳兵大敗。那八路兵，勢如泉湧，殺的那吳軍屍橫遍野，血流成河。,"Han Dang and Zhou Tai heard that the First Lord was coming to fight and led troops out to meet them. The two formations were facing each other, Han Dang and Zhou Tai came out, only to see the flag of Shuying Gate open, the First Sovereign came out, Huang Luo pinned the golden umbrella cover, left and right white and yellow tomahawks, gold and silver banners, surrounded by front and back. When he shouted, ""Your Majesty is now the Lord of Shu, why should you take it lightly? If there is a problem, why should you regret it?"" Between heaven and earth!"" When looking back at the generals, he said, ""Who dares to conflict with the soldiers of Shu?"" Behind the First Sovereign, Zhang Bao stood eight zhang and eight spears, galloped out, shouted loudly, and took Xia Xun directly. Xun saw the sound of budding like a thunderbolt, and was frightened in his heart; just as he was about to leave, Zhou Tai's younger brother Zhou Ping saw that Xun couldn't resist the enemy, and came forward with a saber. Guan Xing saw him, and the prancing horse came to greet him with a knife. Zhang Bao shouted and stabbed Xia Xun with a spear, knocking him off the horse. Zhou Ping was shocked and caught off guard, and was beheaded by Guan Xing. The second teenager took Han Dang and Zhou Tai. The people of Han and Tuesday retreated in panic. Seeing this, the forerunner sighed and said, ""The father of a tiger has no son of a dog!"" With a single finger of the royal whip, the soldiers of Shu covered up and killed them, and the soldiers of Wu were defeated. The Eighth Route soldiers were surging like a spring, and the corpses of the Wu army they killed were scattered all over the field, blood flowing into rivers.","The Wu commanders advance to confront him, and their armies clash. In one-to-one combat Zhang Bao fells Xia Xun, and Guan Xing fells Zhou Ping, and then they turn their attentions to the two supreme commanders. Confronted by such warriors, they retreat in confusion. The army of Shu descends upon the fleeing army of Wu, and so great is the slaughter of the Wu army that the very ground itself is buried under the bodies of the dead.","When Han Dang and Zhou Tai heard that the army of Shu was approaching, they marched toward it. When near, the two armies were arrayed. The two leaders of Wu rode out and saw the First Ruler riding out under the great standard with his staff about him. A silken umbrella splashed with gold was over his head; right and left were white banners, golden axes, and other insignia of an emperor. Then Han Dang spoke, “Your Majesty is now Ruler of Shu; why do you risk your life in the battlefield? It would be most regrettable if any untoward event happened.” The First Ruler pointed the finger of scorn at the speaker and said, “You rats of Wu bereft me of my brother, and I have sworn that you shall not live with me under the same sky!” “Who dares plunge in among the enemy?” asked Han Dang, turning to those in his train. The Marching General Xia Xun set his spear and rode to the front, and as he did so Zhang Bao with a roar galloped out to meet him. But this thunderous voice affrighted Xia Xun, and he sought to flee. Then Zhou Tai's brother, Zhou Ping, seeing that his colleague was panic-stricken, flourished his sword and rode out too. At once Guan Xing dashed to the front. Zhang Bao roared again and thrusting at Xia Xun and unhorsing him. This disconcerted Zhou Ping and enfeebled his defense, so that Guan Xing speedily slew him with a slash. Then the two youths rode furiously at Han Dang and Zhou Tai. They sought refuge in their battle array. “The tiger fathers have not begotten curs of sons,” said the First Ruler with a sigh of satisfaction. Then he waved his whip as a signal to fall on, and the Wu army suffered a great defeat. The Shu force of the eight divisions was irresistible as a river in flood, and the slaughter was immense."

Just as he was meeting Deng Ai, Jian ordered Ge Yong to go out and confront Ai. Guanqiu Jian refused to fight to the death. Jianghuai soldiers in chaos. Hu Zun and Wang Ji led troops to attack from all sides. Guanqiu Jian was unable to withstand the enemy, and led more than a dozen horsemen to take the road away.

Fei Yi, the servant in the middle, said: ""The minister heard that those who govern the country must obey the law. If the law does not work, how can they be convinced? Coming down is the right thing to do."" The later master followed suit, and he ordered Kong Ming to be demoted to the position of General of the Right. When Kongming was ordered to be demoted, he was afraid that Kongming would be embarrassed, so he said: ""The people of Shu know that the prime minister has first established the four counties, and they are deeply pleased."" I can’t agree. Your Excellency congratulates me with this, which is enough to make me feel ashamed.” Yi also said, “I heard that the Prime Minister won Jiang Wei, and the emperor was very pleased.” Kong Ming said angrily: “The army was defeated and returned, and I never won an inch of land. It is also my grave sin. If I measure one Jiang Wei, what harm will it do to Wei?"" Yi also said: ""The prime minister is now commanding hundreds of thousands of male divisions, can we attack Wei again?"" Kong Ming said: ""In the past, when the army was stationed in Qishan and Jigu , I have more soldiers than thieves, and I can't break the thieves, but the thieves break: the disease is not in the number of soldiers, but in the ears of the commander and general. If you want to reduce your troops and save your generals, you must think clearly about the punishment, which is more flexible in the future. Otherwise, what’s the use of having a lot of troops? From now on, everyone will have a long-term view of the country, but if you are diligent in attacking my faults and blaming me for being short, things will be settled, the thieves can be destroyed, and the merits can be put to good use and wait for it.” Fei Yi's generals all obeyed him. Fei Yi returned to Chengdu. In Hanzhong, Kong Ming cherished the army and loved the people, encouraged his troops to teach martial arts, built tools for sieging cities and crossing waters, accumulated food and grass, and prepared war rafts. After careful exploration, report to Luoyang.","So Kong Ming is reduced in his military titles but retained as an acting prime minister, and honour is fulfilled. Kong Ming now sets about training and preparing his men ready for whatever engagement should now arise. This is reported to Sima Yi and Cao Rui, who start to discuss again plans for a possible attack on Shu.","“Why does the Prime Minister speak thus?” said the Latter Ruler. “It is but the ordinary fortune of war.” Minister Fei Yi said, “The ruler must enhance the majesty of the law, for without law how can people support him? It is right that the Prime Minister should be degraded in rank.” Thereupon an edict was issued reducing Zhuge Liang to the rank of General of the Right Army, but retaining him in the same position in the direction of state affairs and command of the military forces. Fei Yi was directed to communicate the decision. Fei Yi bore the edict into Hanzhong and gave it to Zhuge Liang, who bowed to the decree. The envoy thought Zhuge Liang might be mortified, so he ventured to felicitate him in other matters. “It was a great joy to the people of Shu when you, O Minister, captured the four northwest counties,” said he. “What sort of language is this?” said Zhuge Liang, annoyed. “Success followed by failure is no success. It shames me indeed to hear such a compliment.” “His Majesty will be very pleased to hear of the acquisition of Jiang Wei.” This remark also angered Zhuge Liang, who replied, “It is my fault that a defeated army has returned without any gain of territory. What injury to Wei was the loss of Jiang Wei?” Fei Yi tried again. “But with an army of one hundred thousand bold veterans, you can attack Wei again.” “When we were at Qishan and Chi Valley, we outnumbered the enemy, but we could not conquer them. On the contrary, they beat us. The defect was not in the number of soldiers, but in the leadership. Now we must reduce the army, discover our faults, reflect on our errors, and mend our ways against the future. Unless this is so, what is the use of a numerous army? Hereafter every one will have to look to the future of his country. But most diligently each of you must fight against my shortcomings and blame my inefficiencies; then we may succeed. Rebellion can be exterminated and merit can be set up.” Fei Yi and the officers acknowledged the aptness of these remarks. Fei Yi went back to the capital, leaving Zhuge Liang in Hanzhong resting his soldiers and doing what he could for the people, training and heartening his troops and turning special attention to the construction of apparatus for assaults on cities and crossing rivers. He also collected grain and fodder and built battle rafts, all for future use. The spies of Wei got to know of these doings in the Lands of Rivers and reported to Luoyang."

The sergeant took the order and came to Weizhai with a book, asking to see Sima Yi. After reading the demolition book, Yi Huan asked, ""Who are you?"" He replied, ""A certain person is from the Central Plains and lives in Shu: Zheng Wen is in the same boat as a certain person. Now Kong Ming is a pioneer because of Zheng Wen's merits. I will ask a certain person to present the book, about tomorrow night, and raise the fire as a sign. I hope that the governor will personally bring the army to rob the village. Zheng Wen will answer."" Sima Yi repeatedly questioned, and then carefully checked the book, and it was true; He gave the sergeant food and wine, and said, ""Today's second shift is scheduled, and I will come to Jiezhai. If the major event is successful, I will reuse you."" The sergeant said goodbye and returned to the village to inform Kongming. Kong Ming stepped on the gang with his sword, and his prayers were over, and he called Wang Ping and Zhang Yi to pay such and such; he also called Ma Zhong and Ma Dai to pay such and such; and he called Wei Yan to pay such and such. Kong Ming led dozens of people to sit on the mountain, commanding the army.","Kong Ming is not fooled for a moment, and on pain of death Zheng Wen is told to write a fake letter to Sima Yi claiming that, if Sima Yi himself will lead the raiding-party attack on the camp, he can capture Kong Ming.","Then Zhuge Liang selected a certain persuasive speaker from among his officers and whispered certain instructions in his ear. The officer at once left and carried the letter just written to the Wei camp, where he asked to see the Commander-in-Chief. He was admitted, and the letter was read. “Who are you?” said Sima Yi. “I am a man from the Middle Land, a poor fellow stranded in Shu. Zheng Wen and I are fellow villagers. Zhuge Liang has given Zheng Wen a van-leadership as a reward for what he has done, and Zheng Wen got me to bring this letter to you and to say that he will show a light tomorrow evening as a signal, and he hopes you will lead the attack yourself. Zheng Wen will work from the inside in your favor.” Sima Yi took great pains to test the reliability of these statements, and he examined the letter minutely to see if it bore any signs of fabrication, but he found it was Zheng Wen's writing. Presently he ordered in refreshments for the bearer of the letter, and then he said, “We will fix today at the second watch for the raid, and I will lead in person. If it succeeds, I will give you a good appointment as a reward.” Taking leave, the soldier retraced his steps to his own camp and reported the whole interview to Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang held his sword aloft toward the North Star, took the proper paces for an incantation, and prayed. This done, he summoned Wang Ping, Zhang Ni, Wei Yan, Ma Dai, Ma Zhong, and Jiang Wei, to whom he gave certain instructions. When they had gone to carry them out, he ascended a hill, taking with him a few score guards only."

於是司馬懿請駕拔營入洛陽。曹爽兄弟三人回家之後，懿用大鎖鎖門，令居民八百人圍守其宅。曹爽心中憂悶。羲謂爽曰：“今家中乏糧，兄可作書與太傅借糧。如肯以糧借我，必無相害之心。”爽乃作書令人持去。司馬懿覽書，遂遣人送糧一百斛，運至曹爽府內。爽大喜曰：“司馬公本無害我之心也！”遂不以為憂。原來司馬懿先將黃門張當捉下獄中問罪。當曰：“非我一人，更有何晏、鄧颺、李勝、畢軌、丁謐等五人，同謀篡逆。”懿取了張當供詞，却捉何晏等勘問明白：皆稱三月間欲反。懿用長枷釘了。城門守將司蕃，告稱桓範矯詔出城，口稱太傅謀反。懿曰：“誣人反情，抵罪反坐。”亦將桓範等皆下獄，然後押爽兄弟三人并一干人犯，皆斬於市曹，滅其三族；其家產財物，盡抄入庫。時有曹爽從弟文叔之妻，乃夏侯令女也：早寡而無子，其父欲改嫁之，女截耳自誓。及爽被誅，其父復將嫁之，女又斷去其鼻。其家驚惶，謂之曰：“人生世間，如輕塵棲弱草，何至自苦如此？且夫家又被司馬氏誅戮已盡，守此欲誰為哉？”女泣曰：“吾聞：‘仁者不以盛衰改節，義者不以存亡易心。’曹氏盛時，尚欲保終；況今滅亡，何忍棄之？——此禽獸之行，吾豈為乎！”懿聞而賢之，聽使乞子自養，為曹氏後。後人有詩曰：,"So Sima Yi invited the camp to Luoyang. After the three Cao Shuang brothers returned home, Yi locked the door with a large lock and ordered 800 residents to guard his house. Cao Shuang was worried. Xi said to Shuang: ""The family is short of food now, so brother can make a book and borrow food from the master. If you are willing to lend me food, you will not have any intention of harming each other."" Shuang wrote a book and asked him to go. Sima Yi read the book, so he sent people to deliver a hundred husks of grain to Cao Shuang's house. Shuang was overjoyed and said, ""Sima Gong has no intention of harming me!"" So he was not worried. It turns out that Sima Yi first captured Huangmen Zhang Dang and put him in prison for questioning. When he said, ""It's not me, there are five other people, including He Yan, Deng Yang, Li Sheng, Bi Gui, and Ding Mi, who conspired to usurp."" Reverse the month. Yi nailed it with a long flail. The city gate guard, Si Fan, complained that Huan Fan Jiao had ordered him out of the city, and said that Taifu was conspiring against him. Yi said, ""If you falsely accuse someone of being against your feelings, you will be punished for your crime."" He also sent Huan Fan and others to prison, and then detained the three brothers Shuang and a group of criminals. . At that time, there was Cao Shuang's younger brother, Uncle Wen's wife, who was also the daughter of Xiahou: she was widowed and childless. When Shuang was executed, his father would marry him again, and his daughter had her nose cut off. His family was alarmed and said, ""The world of life is like a light dust and weak grass, why do you suffer like this? Besides, the husband's family has been killed by the Sima Clan, and who should keep this desire?"" The woman cried and said, ""I Hearing: 'Benevolent people do not change their minds with prosperity and decline, and righteous people do not change their minds with survival or death.' When the Cao clan was prosperous, he still wanted to preserve his end; ""Yi heard it and was wise, and he asked the beggar to support himself, and he became the queen of the Cao clan. A later poem says:","Cao Fang asks Cao Shuang what he wants to do. But he is paralysed by fear. Unable to make up his mind, he dithers all day and all night and when dawn comes the next day he still cannot decide whether to trust Sima Yi or flee in order to raise an army to counter-attack. Finally he decides to surrender and to accept the loss of his power and wealth if it means he can survive. So he hands over his badges and apparatus of authority and is sent to live on his estate. But the gates are locked and guarded by Sima Yi’s men. Now Sima Yi sets about eliminating all who opposed him, all who seized power and all who abused their positions. It is not long before Cao Shuang, his brothers and their entire clan are executed.","It was decided to request the Emperor to declare the hunt at an end and order a return to the city. Cao Shuang, Cao Xi, and Cao Xun were confined in their own house, the gate whereof was fastened with a huge lock, and soldiers were set to guard it round about. They were sad and anxious, not knowing what would be their fate. Then Cao Xi said, “We have but little food left. Let us write and ask for supplies. If Sima Yi sends us food, we may be sure he does not intend harm.” They wrote, and a hundred carts of supplies were sent. This cheered them, and Cao Shuang said, “Our lives are safe in the hands of Sima Yi.” Sima Yi had Zhang Dang arrested and put to the question. Zhang Dang said he was not the only one who had tried to subvert the government, and he named the five friends of Cao Shuang— He Yan, Deng Yang, Li Sheng, Ding Mi, and Bi Gui. So they were arrested and, when interrogated, confessed that a revolt had been arranged for the third month. Sima Yi had them locked in one long wooden collar. The Commander of the Gates, Si Fan, testified that Huan Fan had imposed upon him with a pretended command from Her Majesty and so had escaped out of the city. Beside Huan Fan had said the Imperial Guardian was a rebel. Then said Sima Yi, “When a person maligns another and is false, the punishment for such a crime as he imputes falls upon his own head.” Huan Fan and those with him were thrown into prison. Presently Cao Shuang and his brothers, all persons connected with them, and their clans were put to death in the market place. All the treasures of their houses was sent to the public treasury. Now there was a certain woman of the Xiahou family who had been wife to Wen Shu, a second cousin of Cao Shuang. Early left a childless widow, her father wished her to marry again. Lady Xiahou refused and cut off her ears as a pledge of constancy. However, when the Caos were all put to death, her father arranged another marriage for her; whereupon she cut off her nose. Her own people were chagrined at her obstinate determination. “For whom are you keeping your vow?” said they. “Man is but as the light dust upon the tender grass, and what is the good of mutilating your body?” The woman replied, weeping, “I have heard that honorable persons do not break a vow of chastity for the sake of wealth, and the hearts of righteous persons are constant unto death regardless of all losses. While the house of Cao enjoyed prosperity, I remained faithful; how much more should I be true now that it has fallen upon evil days? Can I act like a mere beast of the field?” The story of her devotion came to the ears of Sima Yi, who praised her conduct and allowed her to adopt a son to rear as her own and so continue the family. A poem says:"
孔明在車上大笑曰：“吾以為漢朝大老元臣，必有高論，豈期出此鄙言！吾有一言，諸軍靜聽：昔桓、靈之世，漢統陵替，宦官釀禍；國亂歲凶，四方擾攘。黃巾之後，董卓、傕、汜等接踵而起，遷劫漢帝，殘暴生靈。因廟堂之上，朽木為官；殿陛之間，禽獸食祿。狼心狗行之輩，滾滾當朝；奴顏婢膝之徒，紛紛秉政。以致社稷丘墟，蒼生塗炭。吾素知汝所行：世居東海之濱，初舉孝廉入仕。理合匡君輔國，安漢興劉；何期反助逆賊，同謀篡位！罪惡深重，天地不容！天下之人，願食汝肉！今幸天意不絕炎漢，昭烈皇帝繼統西川。吾今奉嗣君之旨，興師討賊。汝旣為諂諛之臣，只可潛身縮首，苟圖衣食；安敢在行伍之前，妄稱天數耶！皓首匹夫！蒼髯老賊！汝卽日將歸於九泉之下，何面目見二十四帝乎！老賊速退！可叫反臣與吾共決勝負！”,"Kong Ming laughed loudly in the car and said: ""I thought that the great old minister of the Han Dynasty must have a high opinion, how could I have made such a slander! , Eunuchs caused disasters; the country was in turmoil every year, and the four sides were disturbed. After the Yellow Turban, Dong Zhuo, Jue, Si and others rose up one after another, and moved to rob the Han emperor. Lu. The generation of the wolf-hearted and dog-walking, rolling in the dynasty; the slave-faced servants and the knees, one after another, ruled the government. As a result, the villages and the hills were ruined. I know what you have done: living on the coast of the East China Sea, and being a filial and honest official. It is reasonable and reasonable. Kuangjun will help the country, Anhan will rejuvenate Liu; when will you help the rebels and conspire to usurp the throne! The sins are so heavy that the heaven and earth will not tolerate it! The people of the world are willing to eat your flesh! Today, I am fortunate that God’s will is endless, and Emperor Zhaolie takes over Xichuan. I now serve It is the decree of the heir to raise teachers to seek out thieves. You are a flattering minister, so you can only hide your head and hide your head, and try to get food and clothing; An dare to claim the number of days before joining the army! Under the Jiuquan, how can you see the twenty-four emperors! The old thief retreats quickly! You can ask the rebels to decide the outcome with me!""","To this Kong Ming retorts that he is amused by the baseness of Wang Lang’s speech and gives his own version of the troubles of the Han dynasty, culminating in the Mandate of Heaven passing to his august emperor, Xuande, and now to his son. The task Xuande left unfinished – putting down rebels – is now his responsibility. ‘How dare you talk to me about Heaven’s Will, you white-haired idiot!’ Kong Ming says. ‘When you go to Hell – which will be very soon, looking at you – what will you have to say to the ancestral emperors of the Han? Ehh? Go on, get lost!’ This so shocks Wang Lang that he can barely breathe, and suddenly he cries aloud and drops dead from his horse.","Zhuge Liang laughed. Said he, “I regarded you as an old and tried servant of the Han Dynasty and thought you would hold some noble discourse. Could I imagine you would talk so foully? I have a word to say that all the armies may hear. In the days of Emperors Huan and Ling the rule of Han declined, the officers of state were the authors of evil, the government fell into confusion, and misfortune settled on the country. Trouble was rife in every quarter. The rebels you mentioned arose one after another, deposing the emperor and afflicting the people. Because the household officers were corrupt and foolish, and the court officials were as brute beasts, living only that they might feed; because people, wolfishly cruel in their hearts, savagely mean in their conduct, were in office one after another, and slavish flatterers bending slavish knees confounded the administration, therefore the Throne became as a waste heap, and the people were trodden into the mire. “I know all about you. You came from the eastern seashore; you got into office with a low degree; you properly aided your sovereign and supported the state, cared for the tranquillity of Han and magnified the Lius. But could one have imagined that you would turn and assist rebels and enter into a plot to usurp the Throne? Indeed your crime is great and your guilt heavy. Heaven and earth will not suffer you; the inhabitants of this country would devour you. “But happily the design of Heaven is to retain the glorious dynasty. The late Emperor Bei continued the line in the Lands of Rivers, and I have been entrusted by the present Emperor with the task of destroying you rebels. “Since you are such a false and specious minister, you have but to hide your body and cover your head, concern yourself about your belly and your back. Do not come out before the armies to rave about the decrees of Heaven. You fool and rebel! Mark you, today is your last day; this day even you descend to the Nine Golden Springs. How will you stand before the two scores and four emperors of Latter Han that you will meet there? Retire, you rebel! Go tell your rebellious companions to come and fight one battle with me that shall decide the victory.”"
趙雲、魏延聽知此話，遂點精兵五千，敎擒來蠻兵引路。比及起軍時，已是二更天氣；月明星朗，趁着月色而行。剛到金環三結大寨之時，約有四更。蠻兵方起造飯，準備天明廝殺。忽然趙雲、魏延兩路殺入，蠻兵大亂。趙雲直殺入中軍，正逢金環三結元帥；交馬只一合，被雲一鎗刺落馬下，就梟其首級。餘軍潰散。魏延便分兵一半，望東路抄董荼那寨來。趙雲分兵一半，望西路抄阿會喃寨來。比及殺到蠻兵大寨之時，天已平明。,"When Zhao Yun and Wei Yan heard this, they ordered 5,000 elite soldiers to capture the barbarians to lead the way. Compared to the time when the army started, it was already the second day of the weather; When I first arrived at Sanjie Dazhai in Jinhuan, there were about four shifts. The savage soldiers set up to cook and prepare to fight at dawn. Suddenly Zhao Yun and Wei Yan rushed in, and the barbarians were in chaos. Zhao Yun went straight into the central army, just in time for the Jinhuan Sanjie Marshal; the horses were only one and he was stabbed by Yun and fell off the horse, and he slapped his head. The rest of the army disintegrated. Wei Yan split up half of his troops and copied Dong Dana Village from Wangdong Road. Zhao Yun divided half of his troops and came to Ahuilan Village from Wangxi Road. By the time he reached the barbarian Dazhai, the sky was already clear.","Leading five thousand of the best fighters, Zhao Zilong and Wei Yan set out at the dead of night for the camp of Jinhuansanjie.

Splitting their forces, Zhao Zilong heads for the camp of Ahuinan, while Wei Yan sets off for the camp of Dongtuna.","The camps of the other two chiefs—Dongtu Na and Ahui Nan—are behind.” Having listening to this information, Zhao Yun and Wei Yan got together five thousand troops, took the captured men as guides, and marched out about the second watch. It was a clear night, and the moon gave light to march by. The first camp was reached about the fourth watch. The Mang soldiers were already awake and preparing their morning meal, as they intended to attack at daylight. Suddenly Zhao Yun and Wei Yan gave a signal of attack, and their troops poured forward. The vigorous and unexpected attack of the two generals threw the camp into confusion. Zhao Yun fought into the center of the camp and encountered Jinhua Sanjie. Both leaders engaged, and Zhao Yun slew Jinhua Sanjie by a spear thrust. Then Zhao Yun dismounted and cut off the head of the Chief. Then Wei Yan took half the force and went west to the second camp, while Zhao Yun marched east to the third one. By the time they reached the camps, day had dawned."

Kong Ming saw Wei Yan lure Sima Yi into the valley on the mountain, and he was very happy in an instant: he thought that Sima Yi would die this time. Unexpectedly, it rained heavily, and the fire could not be ignited. The Post Horse reported that both Sima Yi and his son had fled.

When Zhuge Liang from the hill-top saw that Sima Yi had been inveigled into the trap by Wei Yan, he rejoiced exceedingly; and when he saw the flames burst forth, he thought surely his rival was done for. Then, unhappily for him, Heaven thought it well to send down torrents of rain, which quenched the fire and upset all his calculations.

The man regarded him as Sima Yi. Caoxi asked, ""What is Zhongda's opinion?"" Yi said, ""Jiangdong Sun Quan married Liu Bei with his younger sister, and then took the opportunity to steal it back; Liu Bei occupied Jingzhou and did not return it: they both hate each other. A person who has been arguing with one tongue will go to the book to talk about Sun Quan, and he will send his troops to take Jingzhou, and Liu Bei will send troops from the two rivers to save Jingzhou. At that time, the king raised his troops to take Hanchuan, so that Liu Bei could not save both ends, and he was bound to be in danger.""","When Cao Cao hears that Xuande has been made king, his fury knows no bounds. ‘ That lowlife, straw sandal-maker. Now I’ll destroy him!’ And so saying, he orders an invasion force to be prepared to attack Shu. However, wiser heads intervene, and then one of those in the court previously unnoticed by Cao Cao steps forward. His name is Sima Yi. He says, ‘Don’t waste your energy on long-distance campaigns out of righteous anger. There’s a simpler means of bringing Xuande down without firing a single arrow and it only requires one general.’ Amused but also intrigued, Cao Cao asks, ‘And what is this plan?’","When this memorial reached Capital Xuchang, Cao Cao was in his palace at Yejun, and it annoyed him greatly. “How dare this mean weaver of straw shoes behave thus?” said he. “Now I swear that I will destroy him.” So he issued orders for the whole force of the state to go out against the two Lands of Rivers to wage fierce war with the new Prince of Hanzhong. But a remonstrance came from the mouth of one man. “Let not the great Prince of Wei trouble himself to go on a distant expedition because of a temporary annoyance. I can propose a plan of which the execution will need not the bending of a single bow, and yet it will make Liu Bei bring down disaster upon his own head. When his army shall have become exhausted, it will only be necessary to send one single general against him and victory will be ours.” Cao Cao looked at the officer; it was First Secretary Sima Yi. “What is your exalted view, my friend?” said Cao Cao. “Sun Quan's sister is wife to Liu Bei, but Sun Quan has found an occasion to steal away the bride. Liu Bei is in possession of Jingzhou still, and he and Sun Quan are bitter enemies. Therefore send some able speaker with a letter to Wu to persuade the Marquis to send an army to recover Jingzhou. That will draw thither all the armies of Shu, when you can send your army to Hanzhong. Liu Bei will be helpless and his strength will be wasted.”"

Emperor Zhang was in Yuanhe, and moved to Jingling, where Zhishu lived here. Later, the official Yan went to Yizhou, where he fell ill and died of gangrene in the first year of Xingping. Zhao Wei, a state official, and others, jointly protected Zhang as the shepherd of Yizhou. Zhang once killed Zhang Lu's mother and younger brother, so he had a scorpion. Zhang made Pang Xi the prefect of Brazil to reject Zhang Lu. When Pang Xi found out that Zhang Lu wanted to raise troops to take Sichuan, he urgently reported to Liu Zhang. Zhang was a coward in his whole life, and when he heard this letter, he was greatly worried, and he hurriedly gathered all the officials to discuss it. Suddenly a person came out and said, ""Don't worry, my lord: although a certain person is not talented, with a tongue that is not rotten, Zhang Lu dare not look directly at Xichuan."" It is:","The governor, Liu Zhang, is a long-time enemy of Zhang Lu and has in fact executed both his mother and brother. Knowing that this makes Zhang Lu a danger, he garrisoned Baxi, a town close to Hanzhong, and appointed Pang Xi as the commander.

Prince Gong had been moved out to Jingling several generations ago, and the family had settled there. Later, Liu Yan became an official, and when he died in due course, his son was recommended for the vacant Protectorship of Yiazhou. There was enmity between Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu, for Liu Zhang had put to death Zhang Lu's mother and brother. When he knew of the danger, Liu Zhang dispatched Pang Xi as Governor of Baxi to ward off Zhang Lu. But Liu Zhang had always been feeble, and when he received news from his commander of Zhang Lu's movements, his heart sank within him for fear, and he hastily called in his advisers. At the council one haughtily said, “My Master, be not alarmed; I am no genius, but I have a bit of a healthy tongue, and with that I will make Zhang Lu afraid even to look this way.” When plots did grow about the west,"

操次日自引兵為前隊；見山勢險惡，林木叢雜，不知路徑，恐有伏兵，卽引軍回寨，謂許褚、徐晃二將曰：“吾若知此處如此險惡，必不起兵來。”許褚曰：“兵已至此，主公不可憚勞。”次日操上馬，只帶許褚、徐晃二人，來看張衞寨柵。三匹馬轉過山坡，早望見張衞寨柵。操揚鞭遙指，謂二將曰：“如此堅固，急切難下！”言未已，背後一聲喊起，箭如雨發，楊昂、楊任分兩路殺來。操大驚。許褚大呼曰：“吾當敵賊！徐公明善保主公！”說罷，提刀縱馬向前，力敵二將。楊昂、楊任不能當許褚之勇，回馬退去，其餘不敢向前。徐晃保着曹操奔過山坡，前面又一軍到；看時，却是夏侯淵、張郃二將，聽得喊聲，故引軍殺來接應。於是殺退楊昂、楊任，救得曹操回寨。操重賞四將。自此兩邊相拒五十餘日，只不交戰。曹操傳令退軍。賈詡曰：“賊勢未見強弱，主公何故自退耶？”操曰：“吾料賊兵每日隄備，急難取勝。吾以退軍為名，使賊懈而無備，然後分輕騎抄襲其後，必勝賊矣。”賈詡曰：“丞相神機，不可測也。”於是令夏侯淵、張郃分兵兩路，各引輕騎三千，取小路抄陽平關後。曹操一面引大軍拔寨盡起。楊昂聽得曹兵退，請楊任商議，欲乘勢擊之。楊任曰：“操詭計極多，未知眞實，不可追趕。”楊昂曰：“公不往，吾當自去。”楊任苦諫不從。楊昂盡提五寨軍馬前進，只留些少軍士守寨。是日大霧迷漫，對面不相見。楊昂軍至半路，不能行，且權紮住。,"Cao led his own troops as the front team the next day; seeing that the mountains were dangerous, the forests were cluttered, and the path was unknown, and there were fears that there would be an ambush, so he led the army back to the village, and said to the two generals Xu Chu and Xu Huang: ""If I knew that this place was so dangerous, I would definitely not raise troops. Come."" Xu Chu said, ""The soldiers have arrived here, so the lord must not be afraid of it."" The next day, he mounted the horse and brought only Xu Chu and Xu Huang to see Zhang Weizhaizhai. The three horses turned around the hillside and saw Zhang Weizhai Zhai. He pointed his whip at a distance, and said to the two generals, ""It's so strong, it's hard to get down!"" Before he could finish his sentence, a shout came from behind. Shocked. Xu Chu shouted, ""I am an enemy thief! Xu Gongming is good at protecting the lord!"" After saying this, he raised his sword and rode forward, fighting against the two generals. Yang Ang and Yang Ren couldn't be Xu Chu's brave, so they retreated, and the rest did not dare to move forward. Xu Huang was protecting Cao Cao and ran across the hillside, and another army arrived in front; when he saw it, it was the two generals Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He. He heard the shouts, so he led an army to kill him. So he killed Yang Ang and Yang Ren, and saved Cao Cao back to the village. Reward the four generals. Since then, the two sides have rejected each other for more than fifty days, but have not fought. Cao Cao ordered to retreat. Jia Xu said: ""The thief's strength has not been seen, so why did your lord retreat?"" Cao said, ""I expect the thieves to prepare the dikes every day, and it is difficult to win in a hurry. In the name of retreating the army, I make the thieves slack and unprepared, and then divide them up. If the light cavalry plagiarizes after him, he will surely defeat the thieves."" Jia Xu said, ""The prime minister's magic is unpredictable."" So he ordered Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He to divide their troops into two groups, each leading three thousand light cavalry, and taking a small road to capture the back of Yangping Pass. Cao Cao led a large army to pull out the fortress. Yang Ang heard that Cao's army was retreating, and asked Yang Ren to discuss it, and wanted to take advantage of the situation to attack him. Yang Ren said: ""There are a lot of tricks, I don't know the truth, so I can't chase."" Yang Ang said: ""If you don't go, I should go by yourself."" Yang Ren refused to obey. Yang Ang did his best to advance the troops from the five villages, leaving only a few soldiers to guard the villages. It was a foggy day, and we didn't see each other. Yang Ang's army was halfway through, unable to move, and Quan blocked.","When Cao Cao’s advance forces arrive after their long march, they are exhausted, which is why, on the very first night they camp opposite Zhang Lu’s army, his men attack. Using fire to alarm the enemy and catching them still rising from their beds, they almost wipe out Cao Cao’s men. Those who escape struggle back to tell Cao Cao of their defeat. When he comes in person to survey the pass, he is alarmed at the wild terrain and wonders why on earth he has come. On the following day, out trying to survey the scene, Cao Cao is almost trapped and captured by a surprise attack by Zhang Lu’s commanders, Yang Ang and Yang Ren. Once again it is Xu Chu who saves the day by charging recklessly at the enemy commanders, who take fright and flee. For fifty days there is an impasse, with neither side really making any significant move. In a final attempt to break through, Cao Cao orders what seems to be a retreat but really is a trick to lull the enemy into a false sense of security. Yang Ang is fooled and wishes to attack the retreating army, but Yang Ren is sure this is a plot by Cao Cao. However, nothing he can say convinces Yang Ang.","Then he saw the dangerous and evil nature of the place, with its thick growth of trees; and as he knew nothing of the roads and was fearful of an ambush, he returned to his camp. Calling up his two leaders, Xu Chu and Xu Huang, he said, “Had I known the dangerous nature of the place, I would never have come.” Xu Chu replied, “The soldiers are here now, my lord, and you cannot recoil before the hardships.” Next day Cao Cao with only Xu Chu and Xu Huang rode out to reconnoiter the enemy's camp. As they rode over the hills, Cao Cao pointed out the position with his whip and said, “It will be very difficult to reduce a place as strong as this.” Just then there arose a shout in their rear, and a shower of arrows fell about them. Yang Ang and Yan Ren were attacking and the danger became great. “Friend Xu Huang, you look after our lord!” cried Xu Chu, “I can hold the enemy.” Xu Chu galloped out, and the two leaders could not stand Xu Chu and took to flight, while their troops scattered. In the meantime Xu Huang led his master over the hills. Soon he met an army of soldiers led by Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He, who had heard the sound of fighting and had come to the rescue, and Cao Cao got back safely to camp. The four generals were rewarded. For fifty days the two armies held each other at bay without coming to a fight. At the end of this time, orders were given to retire in the camp of Cao Cao. “We have not tried the strength of the enemy,” said Jia Xu. “You should not retire, my lord.” “I see that they are always on the alert,” said Cao Cao. “I am only retiring to put them off their guard. By and by I will send some light horse to attack their rear. I shall defeat them then.” “Ah! Your skill is unfathomable!” cried Jia Xu. Three thousand horsemen led by Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He got round behind the Yangping Pass by unfrequented roads, while Cao Cao broke up his camp and led his main body backward. When Yang Ang heard of the retreat, he thought it would be a good chance to attack, but Yan Ren opposed it, saying, “Cao Cao is full of ruses. The occasion is unclear; we should not lead an attack.” Yang Ang was willful and said, “I shall go; you may come or not, as you wish.” In spite of the protestations of his colleague, Yang Ang marched, taking with him the soldiers of five camps and leaving only a few defenders. The day he set out was very foggy, so that one could hardly see his neighbor's face, and soon the force got into difficulties and could not advance. They bivouacked on the road."

却說司馬懿在營中堅守，忽一夜仰觀天文，大喜，謂夏侯霸曰：“吾見將星失位，孔明必然有病，不久便死。你可引一千軍去五丈原哨探。若蜀人攘亂不出接戰，孔明必然患病矣。吾當乘勢擊之。”霸引兵而去。孔明在帳中祈禳已及六夜，見主燈明亮，心中甚喜。姜維入帳，正見孔明披髮仗劍，踏罡步斗，壓鎮將星。忽聽得寨外吶喊，方欲令人出問，魏延飛步入告曰：“魏兵至矣！”延脚步急，竟將主燈撲滅。孔明棄劍而歎曰：“死生有命，不可得而禳也！”魏延惶恐，伏地請罪；姜維忿怒，拔劍欲殺延。正是：,"But he said that Sima Yi was standing in the camp, and suddenly he looked up at the astronomy all night, and was overjoyed. He said to Xiahouba: ""I see that the general star has lost his position, Kong Ming must be sick, and he will die soon. You can lead a thousand troops to the Wuzhangyuan sentry. If the people of Shu can't fight the chaos, Kong Ming will definitely be sick. I should take advantage of the situation to attack him."" Ba led his troops away. Kong Ming had been praying in the tent for six nights, and when he saw that the main lamp was bright, he was very happy. Jiang Wei entered the tent, and saw Kong Ming throwing a sword, stepping on the gang, and suppressing the general star. Suddenly he heard shouts from outside the village, and Fang wanted to ask people to ask questions. Wei Yanfei stepped in to report, ""Wei soldiers are here!"" Kong Ming abandoned his sword and sighed, ""Death and life have fate, but you can't get it!"" Wei Yan was frightened and fell to the ground to plead guilty; Jiang Wei was angry and drew his sword to kill Yan. Exactly:","So hasty and clumsy is he that he knocks over the lamp, and it goes out. Then Kong Ming knows his time is drawing to a close. ‘It’s not possible to avoid one’s fate,’ he says. Wei Yan falls to the ground, begging forgiveness, and Jiang Wei is so furious he draws his sword, but Kong Ming commands him to put it away.","Sima Yi remained still on the defensive. One night as he sat gazing up at the sky and studying its aspect, he suddenly turned to Xiahou Ba, saying, “A leadership star has just lost position; surely Zhuge Liang is ill and will soon die. Take a reconnoitering party to the Wuzhang Hills and find out. If you see signs of confusion do not attack; it means that Zhuge Liang is ill. I shall take the occasion to smite hard.” Xiahou Ba left with an army. It was the sixth night of Zhuge Liang's prayers, and the lamp of his fate still burned brightly. He began to feel a secret joy. Presently Jiang Wei entered and watched the ceremonies. He saw Zhuge Liang was loosening his hair, his hand holding a sword, his heels stepping on Ursa Major and Ursa Minor to hold the leadership star. Suddenly a great shouting was heard outside, and immediately Wei Yan dashed in, crying, “The Wei soldiers are upon us!” In his haste Wei Yan had knocked over and extinguished the Lamp of Fate."

却說陳震回到漢中，報知孔明。孔明尚憂陳倉不可輕進，先令人去哨探。回報說：“陳倉城中郝昭病重。”孔明曰：“大事成矣。”遂喚魏延、姜維分付曰：“汝二人領五千兵，星夜直奔陳倉城下；如見火起，併力攻城。”二人俱未深信，又來告曰：“何日可行？”孔明曰：“三日都要完備；不須辭我，卽便起行。”二人受計去了。又喚關興、張苞至，附耳低言，如此如此。二人各受密計而去。,"However, Chen Zhen returned to Hanzhong and reported to Kongming. Kong Ming was still worried that Chen Cang could not enter lightly, so he sent people to send them to scout. The report said: ""Hao Zhao in the city of Chencang is seriously ill."" Kong Ming said, ""The big thing is done."" Then he called Wei Yan and Jiang Wei to pay and said, ""You two lead five thousand soldiers and go straight to the city of Chencang in the starry night; , and attack the city together."" Neither of them were convinced, and they came to report, ""When is it feasible?"" Kong Ming said, ""It must be completed in three days; . He called Guan Xing and Zhang Baozhi again, whispering in his ears, and so on. The two went away under a secret plan.","When Kong Ming hears that that part of his plan is in hand he sends spies to see how things stand at Chencang. Hearing that the valiant Hao Zhao is seriously ill, he despatches Wei Yan and Jiang Wei to attack the city immediately. But they are only to attack when they see flames rising within the city. ‘You have three days to get ready to leave!’ he tells an astonished Wei Yan and Jiang Wei. Then he orders Zhang Bao and Guan Xing to carry out secret instructions, and they set out as well. But when Wei Yan and Jiang Wei arrive at the city, it is to find that Kong Ming has already taken it.","When Chen Zhen returned to Hanzhong and reported to the Prime Minister, Zhuge Liang was still worried that he could not advanced by the road through Chencang. Soon after this, however, scouts brought the news that the able defender of the city, Hao Zhao, was very ill. “That means success for me,” cried he, cheering. He called in Wei Yan and Jiang Wei, and said, “Take five thousand troops and hasten to Chencang. If you see a blaze, then attack.” They could hardly believe the order was meant, and came again to see their chief and asked the exact date of departure. “In three days you should be ready to march. Do not come to take leave of me, but set out as soon as possible.” After they had left his tent, he summoned Guan Xing and Zhang Bao and gave them secret instructions."

How can you expect it to be repaid?""","Hugely grateful, Guan Yu offers gold to Hua Tuo, who refuses, saying, ‘I need no reward. I came because of your high reputation for virtue. But you should now rest for a hundred days, and here is a prescription for you to apply to the wound.’ And so saying, he leaves. And as far as Guan Yu is concerned, he is ready for war again. Meanwhile, Cao Cao is reeling from the defection of Yu Jin and the death of Pang De.","As for superhuman valor rivals Guan Yu had none, So for holy touch in healing Hua Tuo stood alone.

於是曹丕安居王位，改建安二十五年為延康元年。封賈詡為太尉，華歆為相國，王朗為御史大夫。大小官僚，盡皆陞賞。諡曹操曰武王，葬於鄴郡高陵。令于禁董治陵事。禁奉命到彼，只見陵屋中白粉壁上，圖畫關雲長水渰七軍擒獲于禁之事：畫雲長儼然上坐，龐德憤怒不屈，于禁拜伏於地，哀求乞命之狀。原來曹丕以于禁兵敗被擒，不能死節，旣降敵而復歸，心鄙其為人，故先令人圖畫陵屋粉壁，故意使之往見以愧之。當下于禁見此畫像，又羞又惱，氣憤成病，不久而死。後人有詩歎曰：,"So Cao Pi settled on the throne, and the 25th year of An'an was rebuilt as the first year of Yankang. Feng Jiaxu was made Taiwei, Hua Xin was appointed Prime Minister, and Wang Lang was appointed Censor. Bureaucrats, big and small, are rewarded. The posthumous title of Cao Cao was King Wu, and he was buried in the Gaoling of Ye County. Order Yu to ban Dong Zhiling. Jin was ordered to go there, and on the white powder wall in the mausoleum, there was a picture of Guan Yunchang’s capture of Yu Jin by the Seventh Army: Hua Yunchang seemed to be sitting on the top, Pang De was angry and unyielding, Yu Jin bowed to the ground, begging for life. It turned out that Cao Pi, because he was defeated by the forbidden army and was captured, could not die, and returned after surrendering to the enemy. When Yu Jin saw this portrait, he was ashamed and annoyed, became ill with anger, and died soon after. A later poem sighed and said:","Cao Pi now starts to rule with full confidence. He makes Jia Kui his chief commander and Hua Xin his prime minister, and many others are given rewards. Cao Cao is named posthumously as King Wu.22 He is buried at Gaoling in Ye. Yu Jin is given responsibility for the tomb. However, when he reaches the site, he sees painted on the wall of the tomb a picture of the battle between Guan Yu and himself, complete with all the disasters that have befallen him – the loss of seven armies and his own capture. It even shows Pang De gloating, and himself prone on the ground. The fact is that Cao Pi despises him and no longer has any confidence in him. So shocked is Yu Jin by this deliberate and cruel insult that he falls ill and not long after he dies. A poet has said:","Cao Pi, being now firmly established, changed the name of the period of his rule to the Prolonged Repose Era, the First Year (AD 220). He made Jia Xu Grand Commandant, Hua Xin Prime Minister, and Wang Lang High Minister, and made many promotions. To the late Prince, he gave the posthumous title of the King of Great Might, and buried him in Gaoling. To the superintendence of the building of King Cao's tomb, Cao Pi nominated Yu Jin, but with malevolent intent. For when Yu Jin reached his post, he found the walls of the rooms decorated with chalk sketches depicting the drowning of the seven armies and the capture of himself by Guan Yu. Guan Yu was looking very dignified and severe. Pang De was refusing to bow to the victor, while Yu Jin himself was lying in the dust pleading for his life. Cao Pi had chosen this method of putting Yu Jin to open shame, because Yu Jin had not preferred death to the dishonor of capture, and had sent an artist on purpose to depict the shameful scenes. When Yu Jin saw them, shame and rage alternately took possession of him till he fell ill. Soon after he died. War waged he for many a year,"

却說孔明提兵大進，前軍已至瀘水，哨馬飛報說：“瀘水之內，並無船筏；又兼水勢甚急，隔岸一帶築起土城，皆有蠻兵守把。”時值五月，天氣炎熱，南方之地，分外炎酷，軍馬衣甲，皆穿不得。孔明自至瀘水邊觀畢，回到本寨，聚諸將至帳中，傳令曰：“今孟獲兵屯瀘水之南，深溝高壘，以拒我兵；吾旣提兵至此，如何空回？汝等各各引兵，依山傍樹，揀林木茂盛之處，與我將息人馬。”乃遣呂凱離瀘水百里，揀陰涼之地，分作四個寨子；使王平、張嶷、張翼、關索各守一寨，內外皆搭草棚，遮蓋馬匹，將士乘涼，以避暑氣。參軍蔣琬看了，入問孔明曰：“某看呂凱所造之寨甚不好：正犯昔日先帝敗於東吳時之地勢矣。倘蠻兵偷渡瀘水，前來劫寨，若用火攻，如何解救？”孔明笑曰：“公勿多疑：吾自有妙算。”蔣琬等皆不曉其意。,"However, he said that Kongming had sent troops to advance, and the front army had already reached the Lushui, and the sentry horse flew to report: ""There are no boats and rafts in the Lushui; Guard."" It was May, the weather was hot, and the southern land was extremely hot, and military vests and armor could not be worn. When Kongming had finished his visit to the Lushui River, he returned to his home village, where he gathered his generals in the tent, and sent an order: ""Now Meng Huo's troops are stationed in the south of the Lushui River, with deep ditches and high fortresses to resist my troops; Empty return? You all lead your troops, lean on the mountains and beside the trees, choose a place where the forests are lush, and I will stop your troops and horses."" He sent Lu Kai hundreds of miles away from the Lushui River, chose a shady place, and divided it into four stockades; Wang Ping, Zhang Yi, Zhang Yi, and Guan Suo each guarded a village. They built grass huts inside and outside to cover the horses, and the soldiers enjoyed the shade to escape the heat. Jiang Wan, who joined the army, looked at it and asked Kong Ming: ""I see that the fortress built by Lv Kai is very bad: it is a violation of the situation when the former emperor was defeated in Eastern Wu. Fire attack, how to rescue?"" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""Don't be suspicious: I have a good plan of my own."" Jiang Wan and others did not know what it meant.","Meng Huo’s strategy is to simply wait out the attacking army of Shu. It is now mid-summer, and the heat is affecting the invading army badly. Realizing this, Kong Ming orders his men to camp in the coolness of the hills and to build shelters.","Spies came back to report: “No boats or rafts can be found to cross, and the current is too strong to think of fording. Beside, we can see the formidable defenses on the farther bank, the mud wall and the turrets all fully manned.” The weather was burning hot, for it was the fifth mouth, and the soldiers could not tolerate their armor nor even their clothing. When Zhuge Liang had inspected the river, he returned to his tent and assembled his officers, to whom he read this order: “The enemy is securely established on the south bank ready to repel our attack. Yet, having come so far, we cannot return empty. For the present you will all seek what shelter you can find in the forests, and rest and refresh your people.” Then he sent Lu Kai to a distance to select a cool stretch of thirty miles, and there he made four stockades. Within the stockades he built huts for the soldiers and sheds for the horses, so that they were sheltered from the intense heat. The four camps were stationed by Wang Ping, Zhang Ni, Zhang Yi, and Guan Suo. However, Jiang Wan, observed these shelters and went to Zhuge Liang, saying, “These shelters of Lu Kai are very unsuitable. He has made the same mistake as that which led to the defeat of the First Ruler at the hands of Wu. He has not taken into account the surroundings of the stockades, and if the Mangs should come over and start a fire, there could be no rescue.” “Do not anticipate trouble,” said the Commander-in-Chief, smiling. “I have provided against all such dangers.” Jiang Wan did not know what the chief meant to do, but he said no more."

却說敗殘蠻兵有千餘人，大半中傷而逃，正遇蠻王孟獲。獲收了敗兵，心中稍喜，却與帶來洞主商議曰：“吾今洞府已被蜀兵所占，今投何地安身？”帶來洞主曰：“止有一國可以破蜀。”獲喜曰：“何處可去？”帶來洞主曰：“此去東南七百里，有一國名烏戈國。國主兀突骨，身長丈二，不食五榖，以生蛇惡獸為飯；身有鱗甲，刀箭不能侵。其手下軍士，俱穿藤甲；其藤生於山澗之中，盤於石壁之內；國人採取浸於油中，半年方取出晒之；晒乾復浸，凡十餘遍，却纔造成鎧甲；穿在身上，渡江不沈，經水不濕，刀箭皆不能入。因此號為‘藤甲軍’。今大王可往求之。若得彼相助，擒諸葛亮如利刀破竹也。”孟獲大喜，遂投烏戈國，來見兀突骨。其洞無宇舍，皆居土穴之內。孟獲入洞。再拜哀告前事。兀突骨曰：“吾起本洞之兵，與汝報讎。”獲欣然拜謝。於是兀突骨喚兩個領兵俘長：一名土安，一名奚泥，起三萬兵，皆穿藤甲，離烏戈國望東北而來。行至一江，名桃花水。兩岸有桃樹，歷年落葉於水中，若別國人飲之盡死；惟烏戈國人飲之，倍添精神。兀突骨兵至桃花渡口下寨，以待蜀兵。,"However, they said that there were more than a thousand defeated barbarians, and most of them fled with slander, and they were encountering the barbarian king Meng Huo. He was a little overjoyed when he received the defeated soldiers, but he discussed with the master of the cave and said, ""My cave has been occupied by the soldiers of Shu, where should I go now?"" The master of the cave said, ""There is only one country that can defeat Shu. He was delighted and said, ""Where can I go?"" He brought the cave master and said, ""This is seven hundred miles to the southeast, and there is a country called Wuge. The evil beast is the food; it has scales and armor, and swords and arrows cannot penetrate it. The soldiers and soldiers under it all wear rattan armor; It is dried and then soaked, more than ten times, but the armor is formed; when worn on the body, it will not sink when crossing the river, the water will not get wet, and neither swords nor arrows can enter. Therefore, it is called 'Tengjia Army'. Today, the king can ask for it. If you get his help, Zhuge Liang will be captured like a sharp knife breaking a bamboo."" Meng Huo was overjoyed, so he went to Wu Ge and came to see Wu Tugu. There are no houses in the caves, and they all live in earth caves. Meng Huo entered the cave. Say goodbye to the past. Wu Tugu said: ""I will raise the soldiers of this cave and report to you."" He was gladly thanked. So Wu Tu Gu summoned two leaders and prisoners: one Tuan and one Xi Ni, who raised 30,000 soldiers, all wearing rattan armor, and came from the northeast of the country of Ugo. Going to a river, it is named Peach Blossom Water. There are peach trees on both sides of the strait, and their leaves fall into the water over the years. If people from other countries drink them, they will die; but the people of Wugo country drink them, and they will increase their spirits. The Wutu bone soldiers went to the Taohua Ferry to go down the village, waiting for the soldiers of Shu.","And with that Kong Ming releases them all but as they go he says, ‘If I do catch you for the seventh time, that is it. If you will not submit then, I’ll show no mercy.’ Regrouping once again, but with only a thousand or so men, Meng Huo is told that there is one last hope: the Wugu tribe. Their chieftain Wutugu is huge and eats only snakes and other dangerous animals alive. Their strength comes from their rattan armour. This is so strong because of the way they repeatedly soak the rattan in oil. They do this up to ten times, and it makes the armour impervious to any arrow or sword. It also floats so they can easily cross rivers. So Meng Huo travels the hundreds of miles to their land to meet their chieftain. The people there live in caves, not houses. Wutugu agrees to help Meng Huo, and soon some thirty thousand men have answered the call. Then they march out to do battle with Kong Ming and continue until they reach Peach Blossom river.","The defeated Mangs who had fled were of thousands, and more than half of them were wounded. They fell in with their King, who restored what order was possible and felt glad that he had still some leaders left. Then he and the Chief Dai Lai took counsel together. “Whither can we go?” said Meng Huo. “Our stronghold is in the hands of the enemy.” Dai Lai replied, “There is but one country that can overcome these troops; that is the Wugo Kingdom. It lies two hundred miles to the southeast. The King of that state is named Wutu Gu. He is a giant of twelve spans. He does not eat grain, but lives on serpents and venomous beasts. He wears scaly armor, which is impenetrable to swords and arrows. His warriors wear rattan armor. This rattan grows in gullies, climbing over rocks and walls. The inhabitants cut the rattans and steep them in oil for half a year. Then they are dried in the sun. When dry they are steeped again, and so on many times. Then they are plaited into helmets and armor. Clad in this, the men float across rivers, and it does not get wet. No weapon can penetrate it. The soldiers are called the Rattan Army. You may seek aid from this king, and with his help you can take Zhuge Liang as easily as a sharp knife cleaves a bamboo.” Meng Huo went to the Wugo Kingdom and saw the King. The people of this country do not live in houses, but dwell in caves. Meng Huo told the story of his woes and obtained a promise of help, for which he expressed great gratitude. Wutu Gu called up two generals named Xi Ni and Tu An and gave them thirty thousand of the rattan-armored soldiers and bade them march northeast. They came to a river called the River of Peach Flowers, on both banks of which grow many peach trees. Year after year the leaves of these trees fall into the river and render it poisonous to all but the natives. But to the natives it is a stimulant which doubles their vigor. They camped on the bank of this river to await the coming of the army of Shu."

却說孔明大驅士馬，復出祈山。勞軍已畢，魏延、陳式、杜瓊、張嶷四將入帳拜伏請罪。孔明曰：“是誰失陷了軍來？”延曰：“陳式不廳號令，潛入谷口，以此大敗。”式曰：“此事魏延敎我行來。”孔明曰：“他倒救你，你反攀他！將令以違，不必巧說！”卽令武士推出陳式斬之。須臾，懸首於帳前，以示諸將——此時孔明不殺魏延，欲留之以為後用也。孔明旣斬了陳式，正議進兵，忽有細作報說曹眞臥病不起，現在營中治療。孔明大喜。謂諸將曰：“若曹眞病輕，必便回長安。今魏兵不退，必為病重，故留於軍中，以安衆人之心。吾寫下一書，敎秦良的降兵持與曹眞，眞若見之，必然死矣。”遂喚降兵至帳下，問曰：“汝等皆是魏軍，父母妻子，多在中原，不宜久居蜀中。今放汝等回家，若何？”衆軍泣淚拜謝。孔明曰：“曹子丹與吾有約；吾有一書，汝等帶回，送與子丹，必有重賞。”魏軍領了書，奔回本寨，將孔明書呈與曹眞。眞扶病而起，拆封視之。其書曰：,"However, he said that Kongming had driven the horses and returned to pray for the mountain. After the labor force was over, Wei Yan, Chen Shi, Du Qiong, and Zhang Yi entered the tent to bow down and plead guilty. Kong Ming said: ""Who fell into the army?"" Yan said: ""Chen Shi did not give orders to sneak into the mouth of the valley, and this was a great defeat."" Shi said: ""Wei Yan told me to do this."" You, you back up against him! You will be ordered to violate it, don't say it by accident!"" The samurai ordered the Chen Shi Zhanzhi. After a while, hang his head in front of the tent to show the generals - at this time, Kong Ming did not kill Wei Yan, and wanted to keep it for later use. Kong Mingyan beheaded Chen Shi, and was discussing to enter the army, but there was a small report saying that Cao Zhen was lying ill and was now being treated in the camp. Kong Ming was overjoyed. He told the generals: ""If Cao Zhen's illness is mild, he will definitely return to Chang'an. Now that the Wei soldiers do not retreat, he must be seriously ill, so he stays in the army to reassure the hearts of the people. I will write a book to teach Qin Liang's army. Jiang Bingchi and Cao Zhen, if he sees him, he will surely die."" Then he summoned Jiang Bing to the tent, and asked, ""You are all from the Wei army, your parents and wives are mostly in the Central Plains, and it is not suitable for you to live in Shu for a long time. I will let you go now. Waiting for you to go home, Ruo why?"" The army cried and thanked him. Kong Ming said: ""Cao Zidan has an appointment with me; I have a book, you will bring it back and give it to Zidan, and there will be a reward."" He got up from the sickness, unpacked and looked at it. Its book says:","Back to Kong Ming. He orders the execution of Chen Shi for disobedience but spares Wei Yan, not least because he has plans for him for the future, though he does not entirely trust him. News comes to Kong Ming of the ill health of Cao Zhen. ‘ He’s only remaining with his troops,’ declares Kong Ming, ‘to boost morale, so let us destroy him.’ So saying, he writes a letter to Cao Zhen and sends it with some of the men who surrendered earlier, freeing them in the process.","After this adventure Zhuge Liang hastened back to Qishan. After the soldiers had been feasted and services recognized, the four discontented leaders—Wei Yan, Chen Shi, Du Qiong, and Zhang Ni—came to the tent to apologize. “Who caused the loss?” said Zhuge Liang. Wei Yan said, “Chen Shi disobeyed orders and rushed into the valley.” “Wei Yan told me to,” said Chen Shi. “Would you still try to drag him down after he rescued you?” said Zhuge Liang. “However, when orders have been disobeyed, it is useless to try and gloze it over.” Zhuge Liang sentenced Chen Shi to death, and he was led away. Soon they brought his head into the presence of the assembled generals. Wei Yan was spared as there was yet work for him to accomplish. After this, Zhuge Liang prepared to advance. The scouts reported that Cao Zhen was ill, but was being treated by doctors in his tent. The news pleased Zhuge Liang, and he said to his officers, “If Cao Zhen's illness is slight, they will surely return to Changan. They must be delayed by his serious sickness. He stays on so that his soldiers may not lose heart. Now I will write him such a letter that he will die.” Then he called up the soldiers of Wei who had yielded, and said to them, “You are Wei troops, and your families are all over there: it is wrong for you to serve me. Suppose I let you go home?” They thanked him, falling prostrate and weeping. Then Zhuge Liang continued, “Friend Cao Zhen and I have a compact, and I have a letter for him which you shall take. The bearer will be well rewarded.” They received the letter and ran home to their own tents, where they gave their Commander-in-Chief the letter."

且說孔明到永安宮，見先主病危，慌忙拜伏於龍榻之下。先主傳旨，請孔日坐於龍榻之側，撫其背曰：“朕自得丞相，幸成帝業；何期智識淺陋，不納丞相之言，自取其敗。悔恨成疾，死在旦夕。嗣子孱弱，不得不以大事相託。”言訖，淚流滿面。孔明亦涕泣曰：“願陛下善保龍體，以副天下之望！”先主以目遍視，只見馬良之弟馬謖在傍，先主令且退。謖退出，先主謂孔明曰：“丞相觀馬謖之才何如？”孔明曰：“此人亦當世之英才也。”先主曰：“不然：朕觀此人，言過其實，不可大用。丞相宜深察之。”分付畢，傳旨召諸臣入殿，取紙筆寫了遺詔，遞與孔明而歎曰：“朕不讀書，粗知大略。聖人云：‘鳥之將死，其鳴也哀；人之將死，其言也善。’朕本待與卿等同滅曹賊，共扶漢室；不幸中道而別。煩丞相將詔付與太子禪，令勿以為常言。凡事更望丞相敎之！”孔明等泣拜於地曰：“願陛下將息龍體！臣等盡施犬馬之勞，以報陛下知遇之恩也。”先主命內侍扶起孔明，一手掩淚，一手執其手，曰：“朕今死矣！有心腹之言相告！”孔明曰：“有何聖諭？”先主泣曰：“君才十倍曹丕，必能安邦定國，終定大事。若嗣子可輔，則輔之；如其不才，君可自為成都之主。”孔明聽畢，汗流遍體，手足失措，泣拜於地曰：“臣安敢不竭股肱之力，盡忠貞之節，繼之以死乎！”言訖，叩頭流血。先主又請孔明坐於榻上，喚魯王劉永、梁王劉理近前，分付曰：“爾等皆記朕言：朕亡之後，爾兄弟三人，皆以父事丞相，不可怠慢。”言罷，遂命二王同拜孔明。二王拜畢，孔明曰：“臣雖肝腦塗地，安能報知遇之恩也！”,"Let’s say that when Kongming went to Yong’an Palace, he saw that the First Lord was in critical condition, and hurriedly bowed down under the dragon’s couch. The First Master passed the decree, and asked Confucius to sit on the side of the dragon couch, caress his back, and said, ""I am the prime minister, and I am fortunate to become the emperor's career; when the wisdom is shallow, I do not accept the prime minister's words, and I will bring myself to defeat. Regret becomes an illness and death. At the end of the day. The heir is weak and has to be supported by big things."" At the end of the sentence, tears flowed down his face. Kong Ming also burst into tears and said, ""May your majesty protect the dragon's body well, so that the world can look forward to it!"" When Su withdrew, the First Lord asked Kong Ming, ""How does the prime minister see Ma Su's talents?"" Kong Ming said, ""This person is also a talented person in the world."" The prime minister should take a deep look at it."" After the distribution was completed, a decree called the ministers into the hall, took paper and pen to write a posthumous edict, handed it to Kong Ming and sighed: ""I don't read books, I know the rough. The sage said: 'The bird will die. , its sound is also mourning; when a person is about to die, its words are also good. 'I would like to be the same as Qing to destroy Cao's thieves and help the Han family together; As the saying goes, I hope the Prime Minister will teach him more about everything!"" Kong Ming and others wept and bowed to the ground and said, ""May Your Majesty stop the dragon body! The ministers and others will do their best to repay His Majesty's kindness."" He covered his tears with one hand, held his hand with the other, and said, ""I am dead now! I have a confidant to tell you!"" Kong Ming said, ""What is the holy decree?"" Anbang and the country will be settled in the end. If the heir can help, he will help him; if he is not talented, the lord can be the master of Chengdu."" After listening to Kong Ming, sweating all over his body, his hands and feet were at a loss, and he wept and bowed to the ground, saying: ""I am very brave. Inexhaustible strength, do the best of loyalty, and then die!"" After saying this, he kowtowed and bleed. The First Sovereign also asked Kong Ming to sit on the couch, and called Liu Yong, King of Lu, and Liu Li, King of Liang, to come forward, and said, ""All of you will remember what I said: After my death, all three of your brothers will serve as prime ministers as their fathers, and they should not be neglected."" After that, he ordered the two kings to worship Kongming together. After the two kings paid their respects, Kong Ming said, ""Although this minister's liver and brain are on the ground, An Neng can repay the kindness of the encounter!""","Speaking in confidence to Kong Ming, the first ruler says, ‘You brought me success. So how could I have been such a fool as to ignore your advice and so bring this disaster upon us? I am dying. My heir – he’s too weak to rule, so you must take over responsibility. That’s why I place the kingdom into your hands.’ Kong Ming tries to persuade the first ruler that there is hope he might recover, but the first ruler knows this is not so. He warns Kong Ming about Ma Su, the younger brother of Ma Liang. ‘What do you think of him?’ asks the first ruler. ‘I think he is one of our best men,’ replies Kong Ming. ‘Wrong,’ says the first ruler. ‘ He is all hot air and nothing else. Don’t promote him under any circumstances.’ Then he dictates his last will and testament, officially handing responsibility for its execution to Kong Ming as his prime minister. ‘We did our best to rid the world of that traitor Cao,’ says the first ruler, ‘and, in so doing, support the House of Han. I leave now with this still to be finished – not even halfway there to be honest. To you, Prime Minister, I entrust my heir. Teach him well. I am relying upon you for that.’ Kong Ming is overcome with grief, and his eyes fill with tears. The first ruler speaks again to Kong Ming. ‘I’m about to die,’ he says, ‘and if my heir is unable to fulfil his duties and protect the kingdom, then you must take over. You must become the king instead.’ Kong Ming is distraught and weeps, prostrating himself many times upon the floor. Then the first ruler summons Liu Yong and Liu Li to come to his bedside and he commands them to serve Kong Ming as they would serve their own father.","He bowed to the ground at the foot of the Dragon Couch. The dying Emperor bade him come near and sit beside him, and he patted his Minister on the back, saying, “The attainment of emperorship was your work. Little thought you that I should prove so stupid as not to follow your advice and so bring about the late disasters. But I am deeply sorry, and now I shall not live long. My heir is a degenerate, but I must leave him to do the best he can with the great inheritance.” And the tears flowed in streams. “I trust Your Majesty will fulfill the hopes of the people by a speedy recovery,” said Zhuge Liang, also in tears. Turning his head, the First Ruler saw Ma Su, Ma Liang's brother, at the bedside. He bade him retire. When Ma Su had left the chamber, the First Ruler said, “Do you think Ma Su is clever?” “He is one of the ablest people in the world,” said Zhuge Liang. “I do not think so. I think his words exceed his deeds. Do not make much use of him. Watch him carefully.” Having said this, he bade them summon the high officers of state to the chamber. Taking paper and pen, the First Ruler wrote his testament. He handed it to the Prime Minister with a sigh and said, “I am no great scholar, and I only know the rough outlines of what should be known. But the Teacher has said: 'A bird's song is sad when death is near, and a dying person's words are good.' I was waiting that we might aid each other in the destruction of the Caos and the restoration of the Hans, but ere the work is complete I am called away, and this last command of mine I confide to you as Prime Minister to be handed to my son and heir, Liu Shan. My words are to be taken seriously. I trust that you will instruct and guide my son.” Zhuge Liang and all those present wept and prostrated themselves, saying, “We pray Your Majesty repose yourself. We will do our utmost whereby to prove our gratitude for the kindness we have received.” At the First Ruler's command the attendants raised Zhuge Liang from the earth. With one hand the dying man brushed away the falling tears, while with the other he grasped Zhuge Liang's hand and said, “The end is near; I have something more to say as to a close general.” “What holy command has Your Majesty to give?” “You are many times more clever than Cao Pi, and you must safeguard the kingdom and complete the great work. If my son can be helped, help him. But if he proves a fool, then take the throne yourself and be a ruler.” Such a speech almost startled Zhuge Liang out of his senses. A cold sweat broke out all over his body, and his limbs threatened to cease to support him. He fell on his knees, saying, “I could never do otherwise than wear myself to the bone in the service of your son, whom I will serve till death.” He knocked his head upon the ground till blood ran down. The dying man called Zhuge Liang closer, and at the same time making his two sons come near, he said to them, “My sons, remember your father's words. After my death you are to treat the Prime Minister as you would your father and be not remiss, for thereby you will fulfill your father's hopes.” He made the two Princes pay to Zhuge Liang the obeisance due to a father. Said Zhuge Liang, “Were I destroyed and ground into the earth, I should be unable to repay the kindness I have experienced.”"

As for ministers serving outside, they should rely on officials for everything they need, and do not govern production separately. On the day of the minister's death, do not have surplus silk inside and surplus wealth outside, so as to bear His Majesty.","He then allocates his estate in Chengdu to his children, stressing how little it is – eight hundred mulberry trees and about fifteen hundred acres – not much for all that he has done. Once the memorial is completed, he summons Yang Yi and orders that his body after death be placed in a large box, sitting up.","“To my household belong eight hundred mulberry trees and a hundred acres of land; thus there is ample provision for my family. While I have been employed in the service of the state, my needs have been supplied from official sources, but I have not contrived to make any additions to the family estate. At my death I shall not leave any increased possessions, even an excess roll of silk, that may cause Your Majesty to suspect that I have wronged you.”"

權聞言，不能決，乃問於張昭、顧雍等。昭曰：“陸伯言極有高見，可問之。”權卽召陸遜至。遜奏曰：“曹丕坐鎮中原，急不可圖；今若不從，必為讎矣。臣料魏與吳皆無諸葛亮之敵手。今且勉強應允，整軍預備，只探聽四路如何。若四路兵勝，川中危急，諸葛亮首尾不能救，主上則發兵以應之，先取成都，深為上策；如四路兵敗，別作商議。”權從之，乃謂魏使曰：“軍需未辦，擇日便當起程。”使者拜辭而去。權令人探得西番兵出西平關，見了馬超，不戰自退；南蠻孟獲起兵攻四郡，皆被魏延用疑兵計殺退回洞去了；上庸孟達兵至半路，忽然染病不能行；曹眞兵出陽平關，趙子龍拒住各處險道，果然“一將守關，萬夫莫開”。曹眞屯兵於斜谷道，不能取勝而回。,"Hearing that, Quan could not decide, so he asked Zhang Zhao, Gu Yong and others. Zhao said: ""Lu Boyan has a very good opinion, you can ask him."" Quan You summoned Lu Xun. Xun said: ""Cao Pi is sitting in the Central Plains, and he is in a hurry. If he doesn't follow suit now, he will be in trouble. The minister expects that neither Wei nor Wu has a rival to Zhuge Liang. Now let me reluctantly agree, prepare the whole army, and only inquire about the four routes. If the soldiers on the road are victorious, the middle of Sichuan is in danger, and Zhuge Liang cannot save him from head to toe, the Lord will send troops to respond, and take Chengdu first, which is the best policy; If not done, choose a convenient day to set off."" The messenger said goodbye and left. Quan Ren was able to find Xifan soldiers out of Xiping Pass, met Ma Chao, and retreated without fighting; Nanman Menghuo attacked the four counties, but Wei Yan used suspicious tactics to kill them and returned to the cave; ; Cao Zhen's troops went out of Yangping Pass, and Zhao Zilong refused to take dangerous roads everywhere, and sure enough, ""a general guards the pass, and ten thousand men do not open it."" Cao Zhen stationed his troops on the Xiegu Road, but he was unable to win and returned.",Sun Quan listened to him and so has not sent his army to join the ultimately futile attack planned by the Wei on Shu.,"Sun Quan listened, but was not prepared to give a decided answer. He betook himself to his counselors, Zhang Zhao and Gu Yong, who said, “Lu Xun is the man of profound knowledge; he should be consulted.” So Lu Xun was called, and his speech ran thus: “Cao Pi is too firmly established in the Middle Land to be upset now; and if this offer of his be refused, we shall provoke his enmity. Neither Wei nor Wu, so far as I see, has any one fit to oppose Zhuge Liang. We must perforce consent and put our army in order. But we can wait till we see how the four armies speed. If Shu seems likely to fall and Zhuge Liang is outmaneuvered, then our army can be dispatched and we will take Capital Chengdu. If the four armies fail, we shall have to consider.” So Sun Quan said to the envoy of Wei, “We are not ready at the moment, so we will choose a day to start later.” And with this answer the envoy left. Next they made careful inquiries about the success or failure of the four armies against Shu. The spies reported: “The western Qiangs under Kebi Neng have turned back when they saw Ma Chao in command at Xiping Pass. The southern Mangs led by Meng Huo have been perplexed at the tactics of Wei Yan and have retreated to their territories. The Shangyong leader, Meng Da, have set out, but half way have fallen ill and gone back. And Cao Zhen's army, while marching toward Yangping Pass, have been brought to a halt by the defensive preparations of Zhao Yun, who has garrisoned every pass and occupied every point of vantage; they have eventually retreated, after being camped in the Xie Valley for some time.”"
楊阜過歷城，來見撫彝將軍姜敍。敍與阜是姑表兄弟：敍之母是阜之姑，時年已八十二。當日楊阜入姜敍內宅，拜見其姑，哭告曰：“阜守城不能保，主亡不能死，愧無面目見姑。馬超叛君，妄殺郡守，一州士民，無不恨之。今吾兄坐據歷城，竟無討賊之心，此豈人臣之理乎？”言罷，淚流出血。敍母聞言，喚姜敍入，責之曰：“韋使君遇害，亦爾之罪也。”又謂阜曰：“汝旣降人，且食其祿，何故又興心討之？”阜曰：“吾從賊者，欲留殘生，與主報寃也。”敍曰：“馬超英勇，急難圖之。”阜曰：“有勇無謀，易圖也。吾已暗約下梁寬、趙衢。兄若肯興兵，二人必為內應。”敍母曰：“汝不早圖，更待何時？誰不有死？死於忠義，死得其所也。勿以我為念。汝若不聽義山之言，吾當先死。以絕汝念。”,"Yang Fu passed Licheng to see Jiang Xu, the general of Fu Yi. Xu and Fu were cousins: Xu's mother was Fu's aunt, and she was eighty-two. On that day, Yang Fu entered Jiang Xu's house, visited his aunt, and cried out, ""Fu guarding the city cannot be protected, the master cannot die, and he is ashamed to see his aunt. Ma Chao betrayed the king, killed the county governor, and all the people in the state hated him. Now, my brother is sitting in the city of Li, but he doesn't have the heart to fight thieves, how can this be the reason of the ministers?"" After speaking, tears flowed out of blood. When Xu's mother heard the words, she called Jiang Xu into, and reprimanded him: ""The murder of the envoy of Wei is also your crime."" She also said to Fu, ""You have surrendered people, and you have eaten their money, why are you eager to ask for it? Fu said: ""My followers want to leave the rest of my life to avenge the lord."" Xu said: ""Ma Chao is heroic, and he is eager to try to do it."" Fu said: ""If you have courage but no strategy, it is easy to do it. I have made a secret agreement. Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu. If my brother is willing to raise an army, the two of them will respond internally.” Xu Mu said, “If you don’t plan early, when will you wait? Who won’t die? Die with loyalty and righteousness, and you will die. Don’t think of me. If you don't listen to Yishan's words, I will die first. To stop your thoughts.""","As he consults with his father, a letter arrives from Fa Zheng, who has suggested to Xuande that he try to persuade Liu Zhang to submit. The letter has somewhat the opposite result, as in his fury Liu Zhang tears up the letter and plans for the counter-attack. So desperate is he, he is even persuaded to write to his other arch-enemy, Zhang Lu, asking for help. Far off in the northwest, Ma Chao has built up his own base among the Qiang tribes of Longxi. He has defeated the governor of Jicheng, taken over the city and then pardoned the governor for resisting. However, visiting relatives soon after, this governor, Yang Fu, breaks down and confesses he is ashamed that he betrayed the trust he was given to defend the city. There and then a plot is hatched, supported in particular by one relative, an eighty-two-year-old matriarch. Drawing Ma Chao to the attack before the city of Licheng, the plotters spring an ambush on Ma Chao, encouraged by the fact that Cao Cao has sent Xiahou Yuan to support the plot.","Wherefore Yang Fu was granted leave and went away from the army. On the way, he went to his maternal cousin, General Jiang Xu, Commander of Licheng. The general's mother, then an old lady of eighty-two was Yang Fu's aunt. When Yang Fu saw her, he wept before her, saying, “Behold an unfortunate man! The city I had to defend is lost; my master is dead; and I have survived him. I am ashamed to look you in the face. Now this Ma Chao ravages the countryside, and everyone hates him. Yet my cousin sits still and does nothing against Ma Chao. Is this fitting conduct for a state servant?” Yang Fu wept bitterly. The old lady was moved by his grief, called in her son and said to him reproachfully, “You are the cause of the evil that has come upon the noble Wei Kang.” Then turning once more toward Yang Fu, she said, “But what can now be done? You have surrendered and, more than that, you have accepted service under your late enemy.” “It is true,” replied Yang Fu. “I have surrendered and I have accepted service, but it is with the desire to preserve my miserable life till I can avenge my master.” “A bold man is Ma Chao, and difficult to destroy,” said Jiang Xu. “Not very difficult,” replied Yang Fu, “for though he is bold, yet he is unskillful. Already I have two friends Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu by his side, and they would help against him if you, my brother, would only supply a force.” “What is to be gained by delay?” then said the old lady. “Is there any who will not have to die? To perish in the way of loyalty and righteousness is to die in the right path. Do not think of me, for if you do, and heed not the call of your cousin, then will I die at once so that you may be free to make up your mind.” There was now no excuse for delay, and Jiang Xu had to act."

You can be careful with the embankment. If the army retreats, there will be a plan."" Su Yong said happily: ""The Governor If you are willing to answer, you will capture Zhao Yun alive."" Then he led three thousand soldiers in front and rushed into Jigu. Look to catch up with the soldiers of Shu, I saw a red flag and white characters flashing behind the hillside, and a letter: ""Zhao Yun"". Su Yong quickly withdrew his troops and retreated. After walking for a few miles, the shouting was loud, and a sturdy army rushed out; the leader of the general, with his spear and horse, shouted, ""Do you know Zhao Zilong!"" Su Yong was shocked and said, ""Why is there Zhao Yun here? Unprepared, Zhao Yun stabbed him to death under the horse, and the rest of the army disintegrated. Clouds rushing forward, another army arrives behind him: it is the general of Guo Huai, Wan Zheng. Yun saw that the Wei soldiers were in a hurry, so he pulled his horse and stood at the intersection, waiting for a confrontation - the Shu soldiers had already gone more than 30 miles. Wan Zheng recognized Zhao Yun and did not dare to move forward. Yun waited until the sky was dusk before dialing back the horse and advancing slowly. When Guo Huai arrived, Wan Zhengyan and Zhao Yun were as brave as before, so they did not dare to approach. Huai Chuan ordered the army to rush, and hundreds of cavalry warriors came. When they reached the big forest, they heard a loud shout from behind, ""Zhao Zilong is here!"" Over a hundred of Wei soldiers fell off their horses, and the rest all crossed the mountain. Wan Zheng reluctantly came to the enemy, was shot by Yun Yi's arrow, and fell into the stream. Yun pointed at him with a spear and said, ""I spare your life and go back! Quickly teach Guo Huai to come here!"" Wan Zheng escaped and returned. Yun escorted the chariots and horses to look at Hanzhong and left, and there was nothing lost along the way. Cao Zhen and Guo Huai recaptured the three counties as their own.","Having roundly defeated them, Kong Ming gives orders for the Shu army to begin its own withdrawal back to Hanzhong.","Now Guo Huai was leading his army through the Chi Valley. He called up his van-leader, Su Yong, and said to him, “Zhao Yun is a warrior whom no one can withstand. You must keep a most careful guard lest you fall into some trap while they are retreating.” Su Yong replied, smiling, “If you will help me, O Commander, we shall be able to capture this Zhao Yun.” So Su Yong, with three thousand troops, hastened on ahead and entered the valley in the wake of the Shu army. He saw upon a slope in the distance a large red banner bearing the name of Zhao Yun. This frightened him, and he retired. But before he had gone far a great uproar arose about him, and a mighty warrior came bounding forth on a swift steed, crying, “Do you recognize Zhao Yun?” Su Yong was terrified. “Whence came you?” he cried. “Is there another Zhao Yun here?” But Su Yong could make no stand, and soon fell victim to the spear of the veteran. His troops scattered, and Zhao Yun marched on after the main body. But soon another company came in pursuit, this time led by a general of Guo Huai, named Wan Zheng. As they came along Zhao Yun halted in the middle of the road to wait for the enemy. By the time Wan Zheng had come close, the other Shu soldiers had gone about ten miles along the road. However, when Wan Zheng drew nearer still and saw who it was standing in his path, he hesitated and finally halted. Presently he turned back and retired altogether, confessing on his return that he had not dared to face the old warrior, who seemed as terrible as ever. However, Guo Huai was not content and ordered him to return to the pursuit of the retreating army. This time Wan Zheng led a company of several hundred horsemen. Presently they came to a wood, and, as they entered, a loud shout arose in the rear, “Zhao Yun is here!” Terror seized upon the pursuers, and many fell from their horses. The others scattered among the hills. Wan Zheng braced himself for the encounter and went on. Zhao Yun shot an arrow which struck the plume on his helmet. Startled, Wan Zheng tumbled into a water stream. Then Zhao Yun pointed his spear at him and said, “Be off! I will not kill you. Go and tell Guo Huai to come quickly, if he is coming.” Wan Zheng fled for his life, while Zhao Yun continued his march as rear-guard, and the retreat into Hanzhong steadily continued. There were no other episodes by the way. Cao Zhen and Guo Huai took to themselves all the credit of having recovered the three counties—Nanan, Tianshui, and Anding."
次日，兩軍出營布成陣勢。超分龐德為左翼，馬岱為右翼，韓遂押中軍。超挺鎗縱馬，立於陣前，高叫：“虎癡快出！”曹操在門旗下回顧衆將曰：“馬超不減呂布之勇。”言未絕，許褚拍馬舞刀而出。馬超挺鎗接戰。鬥了一百餘合，勝負不分。馬匹困乏，各回軍中，換了馬匹，又出陣前。又鬥一百餘合，不分勝負。許褚性起，飛回陣中，卸了盔甲，渾身筋突，赤體提刀，翻身上馬，來與馬超決戰。兩軍大駭。兩個又鬥到三十餘合，褚奮威舉刀便砍馬超。超閃過，一鎗望褚心窩刺來。褚棄刀將鎗挾住。兩個在馬上奪鎗。許褚力大，一聲響，拗斷鎗桿，各拿半節在馬上亂打。操恐褚有失，遂令夏侯淵、曹洪兩將齊出夾攻。龐德、馬岱見操將齊出，麾兩翼鐵騎，橫衝直撞，溷殺將來。操兵大亂。許褚臂中兩箭。諸將慌退入寨。馬超直殺到河邊，操兵折傷大半。操令堅閉休出。馬超回至渭口，謂韓遂曰：“吾見惡戰者莫如許褚，眞‘虎癡’也！”,"The next day, the two armies set out to form a battle. Chaofen Pang De was the left wing, Ma Dai was the right wing, and Han Sui held the central army. Chao held his spear and rode his horse, standing in front of the battle, shouting, ""Tiger idiot, come out!"" Cao Cao looked back at the generals under the banner of the gate and said, ""Ma Chao does not diminish Lv Bu's bravery."" Ma Chao fought with a gun. After more than 100 fights, there is no winner or loser. The horses were tired, so they all returned to the army, changed horses, and went out to battle again. There were more than one hundred fights, no winners or losers. Xu Chu got up, flew back into the formation, took off his armor, his muscles protruded all over his body, he carried a knife in his naked body, turned on his horse, and came to fight Ma Chao decisively. The two armies were horrified. The two fought for more than 30 times, and Chu Fen raised his sword and slashed Ma Chao. Chao flashed, and a shot stabbed at Chu's heart. Chu abandoned the knife and grabbed the gun. The two immediately grabbed their guns. Xu Chu was powerful, and with a loud noise, he broke the barrel of the gun, and each took half a knot and beat him on the horse. Cao Cao was afraid that Chu would lose, so he ordered Xiahou Yuan and Cao Hong to attack together. When Pang De and Ma Dai saw the Cao generals coming out together, they rode their two-winged iron cavalry, rampaged, and killed the future. Trooping up. Xu Chu had two arrows in his arm. The generals retreated into the village in panic. Ma Chao went straight to the river, and most of his soldiers were injured. Order to close and leave. Ma Chao returned to Weikou and said to Han Sui, ""I see no one who fights badly like Xu Chu, who is really a 'tiger idiot'!""","Ma Chao can see that beside Cao Cao there is a mighty warrior whom he is sure is Xu Chu – known also as Lord Tiger. When challenged, Xu Chu shouts back that it is indeed him and the next day he sends a challenge back to Ma Chao for a one-to-one fight. The ensuing struggle is a titanic one. Both men attack, and the first bout lasts a hundred rounds with neither man coming out on top. The second bout also goes to a hundred rounds, but again with no conclusion. The third bout ends with the two men struggling to batter each other to death with two pieces of a broken spear with which Ma Chao has nearly pierced Xu Chu.","Then he wrote his pledge to slay Tiger-Lust on the morrow. Next day both armies moved out and arrayed in order of battle. Ma Chao gave Pang De and Ma Dai command of the two wings, while Han Sui took the center. Ma Chao took up his station in front of the center and shouted, “Where is the Tiger-Lust?” Cao Cao, who was on horseback by the standard, turned and said, “Ma Chao is no less bold than Lu Bu!” As he spoke, Xu Chu rode forth whirling his sword and the duel began. They fought over a hundred bouts, and neither had the advantage. But then, their steeds being spent with galloping to and fro, each retired within his own lines and obtained a fresh mount. The contest was renewed, and a hundred more encounters took place, still without victory to either. Suddenly Xu Chu galloped back to his own side, stripped off his armor, showing his magnificent muscles and, naked as he was, leaped again into the saddle and rode out to continue the battle. Again the champions engaged, while both armies stood aghast. Thirty bouts more, and Xu Chu, summoning up all his force, plunged toward Ma Chao with his sword held high to strike. But Ma Chao avoided the stroke and rode in with his spear pointing directly at his opponent's heart. Throwing down his sword, Xu Chu dashed aside the spear, which passed underneath his arm. Then ensued a struggle for the spear, and Xu Chu by a mighty effort snapped the shaft so that each held one half. Then the duel was continued, each be laboring the other with the pieces of the broken spear. At this point Cao Cao began to fear for his champion and so ordered two of his generals, Xiahou Yuan and Cao Hong, to go out and take a hand. At this Pang De and Ma Dai gave the signal to their armored horsemen to attack. They rode in, and a melee began in which Cao Cao's troops were worsted, and the great champion Xu Chu received two arrow wounds in the shoulder. So the troops of Cao Cao retreated to their stockade, Ma Chao following them to the river. Cao Cao's army lost more than half their number. Cao Cao barred his gates and allowed none to go out. Ma Chao went down to the river. When he saw Han Sui, he said, “I have seen some wicked fighters, but none to match that Xu Chu."

The way of human relations cannot be abolished. The princess must be accepted to assist the internal affairs."" . Fazheng replayed and said: ""Wu Yi has a younger sister, beautiful and virtuous. I have heard that someone who has a vision is like this girl: she will be very noble later. She once promised Liu Yan's son Liu Mao; She is a concubine."" The King of Hanzhong said: ""Liu Mao is of the same clan as me, so it is not reasonable."" Fazheng said, ""In terms of his relatives, what is the difference between Jin Wenzhi and Huaiying?"" For the princess - two later sons: the elder Liu Yong, the word is Gongshou; the second Liuli, the word Fengxiao.","Back in Shu, Xuande has remarried – a marriage that brings two more children – and the populace is at peace.","The Prince of Hanzhong returned to his capital Chengdu. Fa Zheng memorialized, saying, “O Prince, thy consort has passed away and the Lady Sun has returned to her maiden home, perhaps never to come again. Human relations should not be set at nought, wherefore a secondary consort should be sought, so that all things may be correctly ordered within the palace.” The Prince having signified his acceptance of the principle, Fa Zheng continued, “There is the sister of Wu Yi, comely and good, and declared by the physiognomist as destined to high honor. She was betrothed to Liu Mao, son of Liu Yan, but he died in youth, and she has remained unwedded. Take her as a wife.” “It is incompatible with propriety; Liu Mao and I are of the same ancestry.” “As to the degree of relationship, would it differ from the marriage of Duke Wen of Jin and Huai Ying?” Upon this precedent the Prince gave his consent and wedded the lady, and she bore to him two sons, the elder of whom was named Liu Yung and the younger Liu Li."

The two arrays were facing each other, and the horses grew out of their busy teeth, and they confronted Ma Dai; only when they came together, they were slashed by Dai with a knife. The barbarians came back after a great defeat, and came to see Meng Huo and talk in detail. The generals were summoned and asked, ""Who dares to go to the enemy Ma Dai?"" Before the words were finished, Dong Tu said, ""I want to go."" Meng Huo was overjoyed, and left with three thousand soldiers. He was afraid that someone would cross the Lushui again, so he sent Ah Huinan and led 3,000 soldiers to guard the Shakou.","So he sends the chieftain Dongtuna to attack, but, confronted by insults hurled by Ma Dai reminding him he has been pardoned by Kong Ming and set free, Dongtuna retreats in embarrassment.","When Ma Dai saw the Mang soldiers approaching, he placed two thousand troops in front of the hills and drew up the troops in formal array. Then Mangya Chang rode out to give battle. This was but a small engagement, as the general of the tribespeople fell at the first stroke of Ma Dai's sword. The Mangs ran away at once. They returned to the King's camp and told him what had happened. Whereupon he called up all his generals and asked for another to go up against Ma Dai. “I will go,” cried Dongtu Na. The King gave him three thousand troops. After he had gone, Meng Huo thought it would be wise to keep others from crossing the river. So he sent a force of three thousand under Ahui Nan to guard Shakou."

Yun Chang led the order, and at the same time, he dispatched Fu Shiren and Mi Fang to be the vanguard, and first led an army to settle outside Jingzhou City; After drinking until the second watch, it was suddenly reported that there was a fire in the village outside the city. Yun Chang hurriedly put on his horse, and when he went out of the city to see, it was Fu Shiren and Mi Fang who were drinking, leaving a fire behind the tent. Yun Chang led his troops to save the fire, and the fire was extinguished at the fourth watch. When Yun Chang entered the city, he summoned Fu Shiren and Mi Fang to rebuke him: ""I ordered you two to be the vanguards, and you have never left the division. First, burn a lot of military equipment, food and grass, and then kill the soldiers of the headquarters: such a mistake, what is the use of the two of you! ""Challenged to kill him. Fei Shi said: ""Before leaving the division, I will kill the generals first, which will not be good for the army. You can temporarily forgive him."" Yun Chang was still angry, and scolded the two of them: ""I don't see Fei Sima's face, and I will kill you two. The leader of the people!"" He called the warriors to each forty, took off the pioneer seal, and punished Mi Fang to guard Nanjun, and Fu Shiren to guard the public security; and said: ""If I come back victorious, if there is a slight difference, I will be punished for both crimes!"" Embarrassed, he walked away. Chief Yun then ordered Liao Hua to be the vanguard, Guan Ping to be the lieutenant general, and Ma Liang and Yi Ji to be the staff officers of the General Central Army, and they marched together. First, there was Hu Ban, the son of Hu Hua, who came to Jingzhou to surrender to the Duke Guan; the Duke reminisced about his old love for saving him, and loved him very much; he was ordered to follow Fei Shi to Sichuan to see the King of Hanzhong receiving the title. Fei Shi bid farewell to Guan Gong, took Hu Ban, and went back to Shu.","Ordered to do this, Guan Yu begins to prepare and appoints two key officials to lead the attack, Fu Shiren and Mi Fang.","Next Fei Shi produced the edict ordering the capture of Fankou. Guan Yu lost no time in obeying its command. He appointed Fu Shiren and Mi Fang Leaders of the Van to take the first army out of the city into camp. This done, a banquet was prepared for Fei Shi, and they sat late at their wine. While still at table there was an alarm of fire in the new camp, and Guan Yu hastened out of the city to see. He found that the two generals had also been feasting, and the fire had started behind their tent, a spark having fallen into some explosives, whence it spread and destroyed the whole camp and all that was in it. Guan Yu and his soldiers did what they could to put out the fire and then reentered the city. There Guan Yu summoned the two generals before him, abused them for their lack of care, and sentenced them to death. However, Fei Shi interceded for them, saying, “It is not well to put two leaders to death at the beginning of a campaign, before even the army has marched. You might reprieve them at least.” Guan Yu's anger had by no means subsided, but he recalled the two generals and said, “Were it not that I have the greatest regard for Chairman Fei Shi here , I had let the sentence take its course. Now I will only flog you.” So the two officers received forty blows each and were degraded from leading the van. Their seals were taken away, and Mi Fang was sent to Nanjun, Fu Shiren to Gongan. “Now be warned,” said Guan Yu. “If, when I return from my victories, there is the least sign of disorder on your part, you will suffer for both faults.” The two men flushed crimson and went out. Then two new officers were appointed, Liao Hua and Guan Ping. Next Guan Yu took command of the main army, and he had two advisers—Ma Liang and Yi Ji. Then it was that Hu Hua's son, Hu Ban, came to Jingzhou and joined Guan Yu, who loved him for the sake of his father and the good service Hu Ban had rendered when he saved Guan Yu. Guan Yu sent Hu Ban to the Prince of Hanzhong in the train of Fei Shi."

時龍驤將軍王濬率水兵順流而下。前哨報說：“吳人造鐵索，沿江橫截；又以鐵錐置於水中為準備。”濬大笑，遂造大筏數十萬，上縛草為人，披甲執仗，立於週圍，順水放下。吳兵見之，以為活人，望風先走。暗錐着筏，盡提而去。又於筏上作火炬，長十餘丈，大十餘圍，以麻油灌之，但遇鐵索，燃炬燒之，須臾皆斷。兩路從大江而來，所到之處，無不克勝。,"At that time, the general of Longchung, Wang Jun, led his sailors down the river. The Sentinel said: ""Wu's man-made iron cables cross the river; they are prepared by placing iron cones in the water."" Jun laughed and built hundreds of thousands of large rafts. Let go. When Wu Bing saw it, he thought that the living people should look to the wind and leave first. The dark cone took the raft and went away. He also made a torch on the raft, more than ten feet long and more than ten surrounding, and irrigated it with sesame oil. The two roads came from the big river, and wherever they went, they were invincible.","As part of this attack Admiral Wang Jun is heading down the river when his spies bring information about both the iron chains stretched across the river and the sunken spikes. Hearing this, he orders huge fire ships prepared and then sends them down the river. The sailors set fire to them just before they run into the chains and are grounded upon the spikes. So intense is the heat generated that the iron chains melt, the spikes fall apart, and the navy sails on. The Wu generals Zhuge Xing and Shen Rong gather with Prime Minister Zhang Ti and recommend surrender.","Now the Jin leader Wang Jun had gone down the river with his naval force. From his scouts he heard of the iron chains and the hammers that had been laid in the river to hinder his progress. But he only laughed. He constructed great rafts of timber and placed on them straw effigies of soldiers in armors and sent them down river with the current. The defenders of Wu took them for real troops and, alarmed by their numbers, fled in panic. Then the great hammers and chains were dragged away as the rafts drifted on. Moreover, on the rafts they laid great torches many fathoms long, and very thick, made of straw soaked in linseed oil. When the raft was checked by a chain, the torches were lighted and the chains exposed to the heat till they melted and broke asunder. Thus the rafts went down stream conquering wherever they came."

權覽畢，大喜，乃謂費褘曰：“朕久欲興兵，未得會合孔明。今旣有書到，卽日朕自親征，入居巢門，取魏新城；再令陸遜、諸葛瑾等屯兵於江夏、沔口取襄陽；孫韶、張承等出兵廣陵取淮陰等處：三路一齊進軍，共三十萬，尅日興師。”費褘拜謝曰：“誠如此，則中原不日自破矣！”權設宴款待費褘。飲宴間，權問曰：“丞相軍前，用誰當先破敵？”褘曰：“魏延為首。”權笑曰：“此人勇有餘，而心不正。若一朝無孔明，彼必為禍——孔明豈未知耶？”褘曰：“陛下之言極當！臣今歸去，卽當以此言告孔明。”遂拜辭孫權，回到祁山，見了孔明，具言吳主起大兵三十萬，御駕親征，兵分三路而進。孔明又問曰：“吳主別有所言否？”費褘將論魏延之語告之。孔明歎曰：“眞聰明之主也！吾非不知此人：為惜其勇，故用之耳。”褘曰：“丞相早宜區處。”孔明曰：“吾自有法。”褘辭別孔明，自回成都。,"When Quan was overjoyed, he told Fei to say: ""I have been wanting to raise troops for a long time, but I have not been able to meet Kongming. Today, a book arrives, and I will go on my own expedition, enter Chaomen, and take Weixin City; I will then order Lu Xun, Zhuge Jin, etc. The troops were stationed in Jiangxia and Miankou to take Xiangyang; Sun Shao, Zhang Cheng and others sent troops to Guangling to take Huaiyin and other places: all three marched together, a total of 300,000 troops, and the army will be raised every day."" Fei Bo thanked him and said: ""If this is the case, the Central Plains will not survive. It's self-defeating!"" Quan hosted a banquet to entertain Fei. During the banquet, Quan asked, ""In front of the Prime Minister's army, who should be the first to defeat the enemy?"" He said, ""Wei Yan is the leader."" Quan laughed and said, ""This person is more than brave, but his heart is not right. It's a disaster - how can you not know about Kongming?"" He said: ""Your Majesty's words are very worthy! The minister is going back now, and you should tell Kongming with these words."" A large army of 300,000 soldiers was raised, and the imperial chariots marched in person. Kong Ming asked again, ""Does the Lord Wu have anything else to say?"" Kong Ming sighed and said: ""The master of wisdom! I don't know this person: I use my ears to cherish his courage."" Say goodbye to Kongming and return to Chengdu.","Sun Quan immediately agrees to come to his assistance by attacking Wei, intending instead to use this as a cover to seize Xincheng and then Xiangyang and Huaiyang. At the banquet to celebrate this new alliance, Sun Quan asks Fei Yi who is in charge of the vanguard, and, on being told Wei Yan, comments that this is a most untrustworthy man. When Fei Yi reports this back along with the good news of the alliance, Kong Ming comments that this shows how good a commander Sun Quan is. When pressed to take care about Wei Yan, Kong Ming replies obliquely, ‘I have my plans!’ Sima Yi then tries the old deserter trick. He sends a soldier by the name of Zheng Wen to pretend to have deserted to the Shu side. He hopes that Zheng Wen will enable him to know Kong Ming’s plans and thereby thwart them. But the plan backfires terribly. Kong Ming is not fooled for a moment, and on pain of death Zheng Wen is told to write a fake letter to Sima Yi claiming that, if Sima Yi himself will lead the raiding-party attack on the camp, he can capture Kong Ming.","Sun Quan was pleased at the news and said to the envoy, “I have long desired to set my arm in motion, but have not been able to arrange with Zhuge Liang. After this letter I will lead an expedition myself and go to Juchao and capture Xincheng of Wei. Moreover, I will send Lu Xun and Zhuge Jin to camp at Miankou and Jiangxia, and take Xiangyang. I will also send an army under Sun Shao into Guangling to capture Huaiyang. The total number will be three hundred thousand troops, and they shall start at once.” Fei Yi thanked him and said, “In such a case the Middle Land will fall forthwith.” A banquet was prepared. At this, Sun Quan said, “Whom did the Prime Minister send to lead the battle?” Fei Yi replied, “Wei Yan was the chief leader.” “A man brave enough, but crooked. One day he will work a mischief unless Zhuge Liang is very wary. But surely he knows.” “Your Majesty's words are to the point;” said the envoy, “I will return at once and lay them before Zhuge Liang.” Fei Yi quickly took leave and hastened to Qishan with his news of the intended expedition of Wu. “Did the Ruler of Wu say nothing else?” asked Zhuge Liang. Then Fei Yi told him what had been said about Wei Yan. “Truly a comprehending ruler,” said Zhuge Liang, appreciatively. “But I could not be ignorant of this. However, I use Wei Yan because he is very bold.” “Then Sir, you ought to decide soon what to do with him.” “I have a scheme of my own.” Fei Yi returned to Chengdu, and Zhuge Liang resumed the ordinary camp duties of a leader."
是日，狂風大作。四壁廂火明鼓響，蜀兵殺到。蠻兵獠丁，自相衝突。孟獲大驚，急引宗族洞丁殺開條路，逕奔舊寨。忽一彪軍從寨中殺出：乃是趙雲。獲慌忙回西洱河，望山僻處而走。又一彪軍殺出：乃是馬岱。孟獲只剩得數十個敗殘兵，望山谷中而逃。見南、北、西三處，塵頭火光，因此不敢前進，只得望東奔走。方纔轉過山口，見一大林之前，數十從人，引一輛小車；車上端坐孔明，呵呵大笑曰：“蠻王孟獲！天敗至此，吾已等候多時也！”獲大怒，回顧左右曰：“吾遭此人詭計，受辱三次；今幸得這裏相遇。汝等奮力前去，連人帶車砍為粉碎！”數騎蠻兵，猛力向前。孟獲當先吶喊。搶到大林之前，趷踏一聲，踏了陷坑，一齊塌倒。大林之內，轉出魏延，引數百軍來，一個個拖出，用索縛定。孔明先到寨中，招安蠻兵，并諸甸酋長洞丁——此時大半皆歸本鄕去了——除死傷外，其餘盡皆歸降。孔明以酒肉相待，以好言撫慰，盡令放回。蠻兵皆感歎而去。少頃，張翼解孟優至。孔明誨之曰：“汝兄愚迷，汝當諫之。今被吾擒了四番，有何面目再見人耶？”孟優羞慚滿面，伏地告求免死。孔明曰：“吾殺汝不在今日，吾且饒汝性命，勸諭汝兄。”令武士解其繩索，放起孟優。優泣拜而去。,"It's the day, the wind blows. Fire and drums rang out in the four walls, and the soldiers of Shu came. The savage soldiers are in conflict with themselves. Meng Huo was shocked, and hurriedly led his clan Dong Ding to kill to open a path and ran to the old village. Suddenly Yibiao's army rushed out of the village: it was Zhao Yun. Huo hurriedly returned to the Xi'er River and walked away from the remote area of the mountain. Another Biao army came out: it was Ma Dai. Meng Huo only had dozens of defeated soldiers left, and they fled in the valley. I saw fire in the south, north and west, so I didn't dare to move forward, so I had to look east. I just turned around the mountain pass and saw a large forest. Before I saw a large forest, dozens of followers led a small car. Kongming sat on the car, he laughed and said, ""Meng Huo, the barbarian king! Heaven has been defeated for a long time. I have been waiting for a long time!"" Angrily, he looked back and said, ""I have been humiliated three times by this man's tricks. Today, I am fortunate to meet you here. You all go forward with all your might, even with your men and chariots chopped to pieces!"" Meng Huo shouted first. Before grabbing Dalin, he stepped into the pit and collapsed together. Within the Dalin, Wei Yan was transferred out, and hundreds of troops were brought in, dragged out one by one, and secured with ropes. Kong Ming went to the village first, recruited the barbarians, and all the chieftains of the Dian Ding Dong Ding - at this time most of them have returned to their hometown - except for the casualties, the rest all surrendered. Kong Ming treated each other with wine and meat, comforted with kind words, and ordered them to be released. The barbarians all sighed and left. After a while, Zhang Yi resolved Meng You to arrive. Kong Ming instructed him and said, ""Your brother is foolish and confused, and you should advise him. I have captured him four times now, how can I see you again?"" Kong Ming said, ""I will not kill you today, but I will spare your life and advise your brother."" He ordered the warrior to untie his rope and release Meng You. Youqi bowed and went away.","Little does he know that his lands have already been penetrated by the Shu troops. Suddenly fires are ignited all around the Man army, and panic breaks out, with men fleeing in all directions. Soon Meng Huo has but a handful of soldiers still with him, and they retreat into a valley to the east. To his amazement and delight he sees Kong Ming’s carriage trundling along ahead of him, and Kong Ming, seeing him, shouts, ‘Hah, king of the Man! Heaven has defeated you again, but you took so long to get here.’ ‘Three times he has tricked me,’ cries Meng Huo to his men. ‘Now let’s get him. Charge!’ Not many of his men follow him, but some riders do charge forward, with Meng Huo leading. Just as they close for the kill, the ground beneath them collapses, and they and their horses fall into deep pits. Wei Yan has them pulled out and binds them tight. Then he marches them off to Kong Ming’s camp. Of course, Kong Ming pardons the soldiers and sets them free. He remonstrates with Meng You and urges him to at least try to tame his brother. Then he too is released.","One day was very stormy. Then the Mangs saw great flames spring up around them, and at the same time the rolling of drums heralded an attack. The Mangs, instead of going out to meet the enemy, began to force their way out of the Shu attack. Meng Huo became alarmed and fled with all his clans and dependents. They fought their way through and made a dash for their former camp. Just as they reached it, there appeared a cohort of the enemy led by Zhao Yun. Meng Huo turned off west and sought refuge in the mountains. But he was fiercely attacked by a cohort under Ma Dai. With a small remnant of followers, he got away into a valley. Soon he saw in the west, north and south clouds of smoke rising and the glow of torches, so that he was forced to halt. However, the east remained clear, and presently he fled in that direction. As he was crossing the mouth of a gully, he noticed a few horsemen outlined against a thick wood and saw they were escorting a small carriage. And in that carriage sat Zhuge Liang. Zhuge Liang laughed, and said, “So King of the Mangs has got here! How does Heaven make you defeated so? I have waited for you a long time.” Meng Huo angrily turned to his followers and said, “Thrice have I been the victim of this man's base wiles and have been put to shame. Now chance has sent him across my path, and you must attack him with all your energy. Let us cut him to pieces and those with him.” The Mang horsemen, with Meng Huo shouting to encourage them, pushed forward in hot haste toward the wood. But in a few moments they all stumbled and disappeared into some pits that had been dug in the way. And just then Wei Yan emerged from the wood. One by one the Mangs were pulled out of the pits and bound tight with cords. Zhuge Liang returned to his camp, where the captors of the King could bring in their prisoner. Zhuge Liang busied himself in soothing the other Mang prisoners. Many of the notables and chiefs of the tributaries had betaken themselves to their own ravines and villages with their followers. Many of those who remained came over and yielded to Shu. They were well fed and assured of safety, and allowed to go to their own. They went off gladly enough. By and by Zhang Yi brought up the King's brother, Meng You. Zhuge Liang reproached him for his brother's behavior. “Your brother is a misguided simpleton; you ought to remonstrate with him and persuade him to change his course. Here you are, a captive for the fourth time; are you not ashamed? How can you have the effrontery to look anyone in the face?” A deep flush of shame passed over Meng You's face, and he threw himself to the earth begging forgiveness. Zhuge Liang said, “If I put you to death, it shall not be today. This time I pardon you, but you are to talk to your brother.” So Meng You was loosed from his bonds and allowed to get up. He went away weeping."

却說魏兵旣發，早有細作入沓中報知姜維。維卽具表申奏後主：“請降詔遣左車騎將軍張翼領兵守護陽平關，右車騎將軍廖化領兵守陰平橋頭：這二處最為要緊，若失二處，漢中不保矣。一面當遣使入吳求救。臣一面自起沓中之兵拒敵。”時後主改景耀六年為炎興元年，日與宦官黃皓在宮中遊樂。忽接姜維之表，卽召黃皓問曰：“今魏國遣鍾會、鄧艾大起人馬，分道而來，如之奈何？”皓奏曰：“此乃姜維欲立功名，故上此表。陛下寬心，勿生疑慮。臣聞城中有一師婆，供奉一神，能知吉凶，可召來問之。”後主從其言，於後殿陳設香花紙燭享祭禮物，令黃皓用小車請入宮中，坐於龍牀之上。後主焚香祝畢，師婆忽然披髮跣足，就殿上跳躍數十遍，盤旋於案上。皓曰：“此神人降矣。陛下可退左右親禱之。”後主盡退侍臣，再拜祝之。師婆大叫曰：“吾乃西川土神也。陛下欣樂太平，何為求問他事？數年之後，魏國疆土亦歸陛下矣。陛下切勿憂慮。”言訖，昏倒於地，半晌方甦。後主大喜，重加賞賜。自此深信師婆之說，遂不聽姜維之言，每日只在宮中飲宴歡樂。姜維累申告急表文，皆被黃皓隱匿：因此誤了大事。,"However, he said that Wei Bing had made a mess, and he had already made a detailed report to inform Jiang Wei. After the declaration of the Weixiu, he said: ""Please send the left chariot general Zhang Yi to lead the troops to guard Yangping Pass, and the right chariot general Liao Hua to lead the troops to guard the Yinping bridgehead: these two places are the most important, if the two places are lost, Hanzhong will not be able to do so. On the one hand, we should send envoys to Wu to ask for help. On the other hand, the minister raised the army in the middle to resist the enemy."" At that time, the master changed the sixth year of Jingyao to the first year of Yanxing, and he and the eunuch Huang Hao played in the palace. Suddenly taking Jiang Wei's watch, he summoned Huang Hao and asked, ""Now Wei State has sent Zhonghui and Deng Ai to raise their men and horses, and come here from different paths, what should I do?"" Watch. Your Majesty is at ease, and do not have any doubts. I heard that there is a master in the city, who worships a god, and can know good or bad, so you can call him to ask."" Hao used a trolley to enter the palace and sat on the dragon bed. After the master burnt incense to congratulate, the master suddenly dipped her hair and stomped her feet, and jumped dozens of times in the hall, hovering over the table. Hao said: ""This goddess has come down. Your Majesty can retreat to the left and right to pray for him."" The master shouted, ""I am the god of the land of Xichuan. Your Majesty is happy and peaceful, why do you ask him? A few years later, the territory of Wei will also return to His Majesty. Your Majesty, don't worry."" , Fang Su after a long while. After the Lord was overjoyed, he added a reward. From then on, he believed in the words of his master, so he did not listen to Jiang Wei's words, and only feasted happily in the palace every day. Jiang Weilei made an urgent statement, all of which were concealed by Huang Hao: Therefore, a major event was missed.","Orders come for him to liaise with Zhong Hui for the attack on Hanzhong, while another army is sent to attack Jiang Wei at Tazhong. As the situation escalates, Jiang Wei writes a memorial to the second ruler asking for additional help to defend the kingdom. But the letter is intercepted by Huang Hao and then interpreted to the second ruler as simply Jiang Wei trying to aggrandize himself. ‘There is nothing to worry about,’ says Huang Hao. ‘I know a shaman in the city, and her deity can tell the future. Shall we ask her what the deity says about the future?’ So she is brought to the palace, and the second ruler performs the rituals and burns the incense. The shaman unties her hair, takes off her shoes and in a frenzy dances wildly, whirling round and round until she collapses on the altar. ‘Her deity is descending,’ says Huang Hao. ‘ Clear everyone else out.’ ‘I am the protector god of the Shu,’ she says in a trance. ‘ Your Majesty’s lands are at peace. Why do you ask about anything else? Soon the Wei lands will be yours as well. Have no fears, sir.’ Then she collapses and takes quite some time to revive. The second ruler is completely fooled by her performance, and as a result Huang Hao is able to ensure he ignores all the letters from Jiang Wei.","He at once sent up a memorial asking that certain defensive arrangements be made. Zhang Yi, Left Commander of the Flying Cavalry, was to guard the Yangping Pass, and Liao Hua, Right Commander of the Flying Cavalry, was to command at the Yinping Bridge in Yinping, which were the two most important points upon which depended the security of Hanzhong. He also sent to engage the help of Wu, and gathered soldiers in Tazhong ready for the march. That year in Shu the reign-style had been changed from Wonderful Sight, the fifth year, to Joyful Prosperity, the first year (AD 264). When the memorial of Jiang Wei came to the Latter Ruler, it found him as usual amusing himself with his favorite Huang Hao. He read the document and said to the eunuch, “Here Jiang Wei says that the Wei armies under Deng Ai and Zhong Hui are on the way against us. What shall we do?” “There is nothing of the sort. Jiang Wei only wants to get a name for himself, and so he says this. Your Majesty need feel no alarm, for we can find out the truth from a certain wise woman I know. She is a real prophetess. May I call her?” The Latter Ruler consented, and a room was fitted up for the seance. They prepared therein incense, flowers, paper, candles, sacrificial articles and so on, and then Huang Hao went with a chariot to beg the wise woman to attend upon the Latter Ruler. She came and was seated on the Dragon Couch. After the Latter Ruler had kindled the incense and repeated the prayer, the wise woman suddenly let down her hair, dropped her slippers, and capered about barefoot. After several rounds of this, she coiled herself up on a table. Huang Hao then said, “The spirit has now descended. Send everyone away and pray to her.” So the attendants were dismissed, and the Latter Ruler entreated the wise woman. Suddenly she cried out, “I am the guardian spirit of the Western Land of Rivers. Your Majesty, rejoices in tranquillity; why do you inquire about other matters? Within a few years the land of Wei shall come under you, wherefore you need not be sorrowful.” She then fell to the ground as in a swoon, and it was some time before she revived. The Latter Ruler was well satisfied with her prophesy and gave her large presents. Further, he thereafter believed all she told him. The immediate result was that Jiang Wei's memorial remained unanswered; and as the Latter Ruler was wholly given to pleasure, it was easy for Huang Hao to intercept all urgent memorials from the general."

却說陸遜正望捷音。須臾，徐盛、朱桓、全琮皆到。所得車仗、牛馬、驢騾、軍資、器械，不計其數，降兵數萬餘人。遜大喜，卽同太守周魴并諸將班師還吳。吳主孫權，領文武官僚出武昌城迎接，以御蓋覆遜而入。諸將盡皆陞賞。權見周魴無髮，慰勞曰：“卿斷髮成此大事，功名當書於竹帛也。”卽封周魴為關內侯，大設筵會，勞軍慶賀。陸遜奏曰：“今曹休大敗，魏兵喪膽；可修國書，遣使入川，敎諸葛亮進兵攻之。”權從其言，遂遣使齎書入川去。正是：,"But he said that Lu Xun was looking forward to Jieyin. Soon, Xu Sheng, Zhu Huan, and Quan Cong all arrived. The chariots, oxen, horses, donkeys and mules, military resources, and equipment were innumerable, and more than tens of thousands of troops were dropped. Xun was overjoyed, and he returned to Wu with the prefect Zhou Bing and his class of generals. Sun Quan, the master of Wu, led the civil and military bureaucrats out of Wuchang City to meet him, and entered with an imperial cover. All will be rewarded. When Quan saw that Zhou Bao had no hair, he offered his condolences and said, ""You have made this great event by cutting off your hair, and your fame and fame should be written on the bamboo silk."" You made Zhou Bao the Marquis of Guannei, and set up a large banquet to celebrate with the army. Lu Xun said: ""Now Cao Xiu has been defeated, and the Wei soldiers are afraid; you can repair the national letter, send an envoy into Sichuan, and send Zhuge Liang to attack him."" Exactly:","Lu Xun is rewarded for his brilliance, and the returning army bring vast quantities of arms, horses and captured men back to Wu. Elated by this success, Lu Xun now proposes that Wu should make an alliance with Shu and Kong Ming for a joint attack on Wei. Sun Quan supports this plan, and it is agreed to send a letter immediately to Shu.","In the meantime, Lu Xun was awaiting news of victory. Soon Xu Sheng, Zhu Huan, and Quan Zong came and reported their successes, and they brought great spoil of carts and bullocks, horses and mules and military material and weapons. And they had also ten thousand prisoners. There was great rejoicing, and Lu Xun with Zhou Fang led the army home into Wu. On their return Sun Quan, the Prince of Wu, came out with a numerous cortege of officers to welcome the victors, and an imperial umbrella was borne over the head of Lu Xun as they wended their way homeward. When the officers presented their felicitations, Sun Quan noticed that Zhou Fang had no hair, and Sun Quan was very gracious to him, saying, “This deed of yours, and the sacrifice you made to attain it, will surely be written in the histories.” He made Zhou Fang the Lord of the Gate Within. Then there were great feastings and greetings and much revelry. Lu Xun said, “Cao Xiu has been thoroughly beaten, and the soldiers of Wei are cowed. I think now is an occasion to send letters into Shu to advise Zhuge Liang to attack Wei.” Sun Quan agreed, and letters were sent."
衆將得令，次日侵晨，引兵四面圍合，築土山，掘地道，立礮架，裝雲梯，日夜攻打不息，箭如急雨，射入城去。公孫淵在城中糧盡，皆宰牛馬為食。人人怨恨，各無守心，欲斬淵首，獻城歸降。淵聞之，甚是驚憂，慌令相國王建、御史大夫柳甫，往魏寨請降。二人自城上繫下，來告司馬懿曰：“請太尉退二十里，我君臣自來投降。”懿大怒曰：“公孫淵何不自來？殊為無理！”叱武士推出斬之，將首級付與從人。從人回報，公孫淵大驚，又遣侍中衞演來到魏營。司馬懿升帳，聚衆將立於兩邊。演膝行而進，跪於帳下，告曰：“願太尉息雷霆之怒。尅日先送世子公孫修為質當，然後君臣自縳來降。”懿曰：“軍事大要有五：能戰當戰，不能戰當守，不能守當走，不能走當降，不能降當死耳——何必送子為質當？”叱衞演回報公孫淵。演抱頭鼠竄而去，歸告公孫淵。淵大驚，乃與子公孫修密議停當，選下一千人馬，當夜二更時分，開了南門，往東南而走。淵見無人，心中暗喜。行不到十里，忽聽得山上一聲礮響，鼓角齊鳴：一枝兵攔住，中央乃司馬懿也；左有司馬師，右有司馬昭，二人大叫曰：“反賊休走！”淵大驚，急撥馬尋路奔逃。早有胡遵兵到；左有夏侯霸、夏侯威，右有張虎、樂綝：四面圍得鐵桶相似。公孫淵父子，只得下馬納降。懿在馬上顧諸將曰：“吾前夜丙寅日，見大星落於此處，今夜壬申日應矣。”衆將稱賀曰：“太尉眞神機也！”懿傳令斬之。公孫淵父子對面受戮。司馬懿遂勒兵來取襄平。未及到城下時，胡遵早引兵入城中。人民焚香拜迎。魏兵盡皆入城。懿坐於衙上，將公孫淵宗族，並同謀官僚人等，俱殺之，計首級七十餘顆。出榜安民。人告懿曰：“賈範、倫直苦諫淵不可反叛，俱被淵所殺。”懿遂封其墓而榮其子孫；就將庫內財物，賞勞三軍，班師回洛陽。,"The generals received orders, and the next day they invaded in the morning. They led troops to encircle them on all sides, built mountains of earth, dug tunnels, erected pylons, and installed cloud ladders. When Gongsun Yuan ran out of food in the city, he slaughtered cattle and horses for food. Everyone resents, each has no heart, and wants to behead the head of the Yuan and offer the city to surrender. When Yuan heard this, he was very alarmed and panicked, and he panicked the chancellor Wang Jian and the imperial censor Liu Fu to ask for their surrender to Wei Zhai. The two descended from the city and came to report to Sima Yi: ""Please retreat twenty li, my monarch and ministers will surrender."" Yi was furious and said, ""Why didn't Gongsun Yuan come? It's unreasonable!"" First, give the head to the servant. Returning from the people, Gongsun Yuan was shocked and sent his servant Zhong Weiyan to Wei Ying. Sima Yi raised the tent, and the assembled generals stood on both sides. Yan walked on his knees, knelt under the tent, and said: ""May the Taiwei calm down the wrath of Thunder. In the near future, I will first send the prince Gongsun Xiu as a pledge, and then the ruler and his ministers will bind themselves and come down."" Yi said: ""There are five major military matters. : If you can fight, you should fight, if you can't fight, you should defend, if you can't defend, you should walk, if you can't walk, you should surrender, if you can't surrender, you should die - why should you give your son as a pledge?"" He Weiyan returned to Gongsun Yuan. Yan ran away with his head in his arms and reported to Gongsun Yuan. Yuan was shocked, so he discussed with his son Gongsun Xiumi to stop, and selected a thousand men and horses. At the second watch of the night, they opened the south gate and went southeast. Yuan saw no one, and was secretly happy. After walking less than ten li, I suddenly heard a bang on the mountain, and the drum horns rang together: a soldier stopped, Sima Yi in the center; Sima Shi on the left, Sima Zhao on the right, the two shouted: ""The rebels, go away!"" Yuan Startled, he hurried to find a way to flee. Hu Zun's troops had already arrived; on the left were Xiahouba and Xiahouwei, and on the right were Zhang Hu and Le Chen: they were surrounded by iron buckets on all sides. Gongsun Yuan and his son had to go down to Mana. Yi Zai immediately looked after the generals and said, ""I saw the big star falling here on Bingyin day the night before. Tonight, Renshen day should be ready."" Gongsun Yuan and his son were slaughtered opposite each other. Sima Yi then mobilized his troops to take Xiangping. Before reaching the city, Hu Zun led troops into the city. The people burn incense to greet them. All Wei soldiers entered the city. Sitting on the office, Yi killed the Gongsun Yuan clan, as well as the bureaucrats and other conspirators, and counted more than seventy heads. Get out of the list. The people told Yi, ""Jia Fan and Lunzhi are bitter and Jian Yuan cannot rebel, and they will both be killed by Yuan.""","When Gongsun Yuan is eventually captured and executed along with his son, Sima Yi rounds up the whole clan and kills them all – over seventy of them.","They opened the attack the next morning at dawn, throwing up banks and sapping the walls, setting up stone-throwing machines and rearing ladders. When night came the attack did not cease. Arrows fell in the city like pelting rain. Within the city, grain began to run short, and soon there was none. They slaughtered bullocks and horses for food. The soldiers began to be mutinous and no longer fought with any spirit. There was talk of slaying Gongsun Yuan and yielding the city. Gongsun Yuan was disheartened and frightened, and decided to sue for peace. He sent his Prime Minister Wang Jian and Imperial Censor Liu Fu out of the city to beg Sima Yi to allow him to submit. These two had to be let down from the walls by ropes, as no other means of exit were possible. Wang Jian and Liu Fu found their way to Sima Yi and said, “We pray you, O Regent Marshal, retire seven miles and allow the officers to come forth and surrender.” “Why did not Gongsun Yuan himself come?” said Sima Yi. “He is rude.” He put the two envoys to death and sent their heads back into the city. Gongsun Yuan was still more alarmed, but he resolved to make one more attempt. This time he sent High Counselor Wey Yan as his envoy. Sima Yi received this messenger sitting in state in his tent with his officers standing right and left. Wey Yan approached on his knees, and when he reached the door of the tent recited his petition. “I pray you, O Regent Marshal, turn your thunderous wrath from us; we will send the son of our leader, Gongsun Xiu, the Heir Apparent, as hostage and all the officers shall appear before you bound with cords.” Sima Yi replied, “There are five possible operations for any army. If you can fight, fight; if you cannot fight, defend; if you cannot defend, flee; if you cannot flee, surrender; if you cannot surrender, die. These five courses are open to you, and a hostage would be useless. Now return and tell your master.” Wey Yan put his hands over his head and fled like a rat. He went into the city and related what had happened to him. The Gongsuns, father and son, resolved to flee. They chose a thousand of mounted troops, and in the dead of night opened the south gate and got out. They took the road to the east and were rejoiced to find it clear. All went well for a distance of three miles, when a bomb exploded. This was followed by a roll of drums and the blare of trumpets; and a cohort stood in the way. The leader was Sima Yi, supported by his two sons—Sima Shi and Sima Zhao. “Stop, O rebel!” cried the sons. But Gongsun Yuan lashed his steed to a gallop. Then Hu Zun, Xiahou Ba, Xiahou Wei, Zhang Hu, and Yue Chen, with their troops, came up and quickly surrounded them so that they were helpless. Gongsun Yuan saw that escape was impossible, so he came with his son, dismounted, and offered surrender. Sima Yi hardly looked at the two men, but he turned to his officers and said, “That night the star fell to this land, and today, five days later, the omen becomes true.” They all felicitated him, saying, “The Regent Marshal is superhuman!” Gongsun Yuan and Gongsun Xiu were slain where they stood. Then Sima Yi turned to resume the siege of Xiangping; but before he had reached the walls, Hu Zun's army had entered. Sima Yi went in and was received with great respect, the people burning incense as he passed. He went to the residence, and then the whole of the Gongsun Yuan's clan, and all who had assisted in his rising, were beheaded. They counted heads to the number of seventy. The city taken and the rebels destroyed, Sima Yi issued a proclamation in order to restore confidence among the people. Certain persons told him, “Jia Fan and Lun Zhi had been against the revolt and had therefore suffered death.” So Sima Yi honored their tombs and conferred ranks upon their children."
却說朱然聽知孫桓損兵折將，正欲來救，忽伏路軍引幾個小卒上船投降。然問之，小卒曰：“我等是馮習帳下士卒，因賞罰不明，特來投降，就報機密。”然曰：“所報何事？”小卒曰：“今晚馮習乘虛要劫孫將軍營寨，約定舉火為號。”朱然聽畢，卽使人報知孫桓。報事人行至半途，被關興殺了。朱然一面商議，欲引兵去救應孫桓。部將崔禹曰：“小卒之言，未可深信。倘有疎虞，水陸二軍，盡皆休矣。將軍只宜穩守水寨，某願替將軍一行。”然從之，遂令崔禹引一萬軍前去。是夜馮習、張南、吳班分兵三路，直殺入孫桓寨中，四面火起，吳兵大亂，尋路奔走。,"However, Zhu Ran heard that Sun Huan had lost his troops and was about to come to rescue him, but suddenly the army led a few pawns on board and surrendered. However, when asked, the small soldier said, ""I am a soldier under Feng Xi's account. Because the rewards and punishments are unclear, we came here to surrender and report it as a secret."" Then he said, ""What is the report?"" General Sun is camping, and it is agreed that the fire will be named."" After Zhu Ran listened, he sent a messenger to report to Sun Huan. The reporter was halfway through and was killed by Guan Xing. Zhu Ran negotiated and wanted to lead troops to rescue Ying Sun Huan. The commander Cui Yu said: ""I can't believe the words of the little soldier. If there is a danger, the land and water armies will all be suspended. The general should only keep the water village, and someone is willing to act for the general."" Cui Yu led ten thousand troops to go. It was Ye Fengxi, Zhang Nan, and Wu Ban who divided their troops into three paths, and went straight into Sun Huan's village, where fire broke out from all sides, and Wu soldiers were in chaos, looking for a way to run.","With the troops of Sun Huan demoralized and broken, the Shu commanders decide to attack their camp but they are aware that Zhu Ran’s navy is untouched and powerful and fear an attack from the rear if they press forward too quickly. To prevent this, they plan an ambush and send men pretending to be deserters into Zhu Ran’s encampment to lure him into the trap. The plot works. Not only does Wu Ban successfully sack the camps but Zhang Bao and Guan Xing trap Cui Yu, whom Zhu Ran sent to relieve the camps.","Hearing of the ill success and losses of his colleague, Commander of the Right Zhu Ran was already thinking of going to his help, when a few deserters appeared and hoarded his ship. He questioned them, and they said, “We are Feng Xi's soldiers, and we have deserted because of unfair treatment. We have a secret to tell.” “What secret can you betray?” “Tonight Feng Xi is going to make an attack upon General Sun Huan's camp; he thinks it is a good chance. They are going to raise a fire as a signal.” Zhu Ran saw no reason to doubt the men, and he sent off at once to tell Sun Huan. But the messenger never arrived, as Guan Xing intercepted and slew him. Then Zhu Ran deliberated upon going to help. “You cannot trust what those soldiers said,” said Cui Yu, one of the commanders. “Both army and navy will be lost if anything goes wrong. No, General; rather keep careful watch and let me go.” Zhu Ran saw this was the wiser plan, so he gave Cui Yu ten thousand troops, and Cui Yu left. That night Wu Ban, Zhang Nan, and Feng Xi made an attack on Sun Huan's camp from three directions, and the soldiers were scattered and fled. Then the three generals set the whole camp on fire."

却說玄德令黃忠、魏延各守一寨，自回涪城，與軍師龐統商議。細作報說：“東吳孫權遣人結好東川張魯，將欲來攻葭萌關。”玄德驚曰：“若葭萌關有失，截斷後路，吾進退不得，當如之何？”龐統謂孟達曰：“公乃蜀中人，多知地理，去守葭萌關如何？”達曰：“某保一人與某同去守關，萬無一失。”玄德問何人。達曰：“此人曾在荊州劉表部下為中郎將，乃南郡枝江人：姓霍，名峻，字仲邈。”玄德大喜，卽時遣孟達、霍峻守葭萌關去了。,"However, Xuande ordered Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to guard a village each, and then returned to Fucheng to discuss with the military advisor Pang Tong. The detailed report said: ""Sun Quan of the Eastern Wu Dynasty sent people to form a good relationship with Zhang Lu of Dongchuan, and he will come to attack Jiameng Pass."" Xuande said in surprise: ""If Jiameng Pass is lost and the back road is cut off, I will not be able to advance or retreat. What should I do? Pang Tong called Meng Da and said, ""The man is from the middle of Shu, and he knows a lot about geography. How about going to guard Jiameng Pass?"" Da said, ""A certain security guard will go with a certain person to guard the pass, and nothing will go wrong."" Xuande asked who. Da said: ""This person was a general under Liu Biao in Jingzhou, and he is from Zhijiang, Nanjun. His surname is Huo, his name is Jun, and his courtesy name is Zhongmiao."" .","As this work proceeds, Xuande is informed of the apparent plot of Sun Quan to link up with Zhang Lu and encourage an attack on Jiameng pass. On Pang Tong’s advice he sends reinforcements to the pass, because if this were to be captured, he would be stranded.","Leaving Huang Zhong and Wei Yan in command of the two camps, Liu Bei went away to Fucheng to consult with Pang Tong, the army's instructor. Intelligence had been received that Sun Quan had sent a messenger to seek to make a league with Zhang Lu to make a joint attack upon the Jiameng Pass, and Liu Bei was alarmed lest it should come to pass. “If they do that, I am taken in the rear and helpless in both advance and retreat,” said he. “What do you counsel, O Instructor?” Pang Tong turned to Meng Da, saying, “You are a native of Shu and well skilled in its topography; what can be done to make the Pass secure?” “Let me take a certain man with me, and I will defend it myself and answer for its safety.” “Who is he?” asked Liu Bei. “He was formerly an officer under Liu Biao. His name is Huo Jun, and he is a native of Nanjun in the south.” This offer was accepted, and the two generals departed."

却說司馬懿見了鄭文之書，便欲引二子提大兵來劫蜀寨。長子司馬師諫曰：“父親何故據片紙而親入重地？倘有疎虞，如之奈何？不如令別將先去，父親為後應，可也。”懿從之，遂令秦朗引一萬兵，去劫蜀寨。懿自引兵接應。是夜初更，風淸月朗。將及二更時分，忽然陰雲四合，黑氣漫空，對面不見。懿大喜曰：“天使我成功也！”於是人盡啣枚，馬皆勒口，長驅大進。秦朗當先，引一萬兵直殺入蜀寨中，並不見一人。朗知中計，忙叫退兵。四下火把齊明，喊聲震地：左有王平、張嶷，右有馬岱、馬忠，兩路兵殺來。秦朗死戰，不能得出。背後司馬懿見蜀寨火光沖天，喊聲不絕，又不知魏兵勝負，只顧催兵接應，望火光中殺來。忽然一聲喊起，鼓角喧天，火礮震地：左有魏延，右有姜維，兩路殺出。魏兵大敗，十傷八九，四散逃奔。此時秦朗所引一萬兵，都被蜀兵圍住，箭如飛蝗。秦朗死於亂軍之中。司馬懿引敗兵奔入本寨。,"However, Sima Yi said that when he saw Zheng Wenzhi's book, he wanted to lead his second son to bring soldiers to rob Shu. The eldest son Sima Shi advised, ""Why did my father enter the important land according to a piece of paper? If there is a danger, what should I do? It is better to order the generals to go first, and the father to answer later."" 10,000 soldiers, to rob Shu Village. Yi self-introduced troops to respond. It is the beginning of the night, and the wind and the moon are bright. It was about the second watch, when the dark clouds suddenly closed, the black air filled the air, and the opposite side was nowhere to be seen. Yi was overjoyed and said, ""Angel, I have succeeded!"" Qin Lang took the lead and led 10,000 troops into the Shu village, but no one was seen. Lang knew the plan, and hurriedly called for the retreat. The torches were thrown all over Qi Ming, and the shouts shook the ground: Wang Ping and Zhang Yi were on the left, Ma Dai and Ma Zhong were on the right, and two soldiers were coming. Qin Lang fought to the death, he couldn't come out. Behind him, Sima Yi saw the fire in the Shu village, shouting incessantly. Suddenly there was a shout, the drum horns roared into the sky, and the fire clattered to the ground: Wei Yan on the left, Jiang Wei on the right, both rushed out. The Wei soldiers were defeated, wounded eighty-nine out of ten, and fled in all directions. At this time, the 10,000 soldiers led by Qin Lang were surrounded by Shu soldiers, arrows like locusts. Qin Lang died in the chaos of the army. Sima Yi led the defeated soldiers into the village.","Kong Ming is not fooled for a moment, and on pain of death Zheng Wen is told to write a fake letter to Sima Yi claiming that, if Sima Yi himself will lead the raiding-party attack on the camp, he can capture Kong Ming.","Sima Yi had been taken in by Zheng Wen's letter and intended to lead the night raid. But the elder of his sons, Sima Shi, expostulated with his father. “Father, you are going on a dangerous expedition on the faith of a mere scrap of paper,” said his son. “I think it imprudent. What if something goes unexpectedly wrong? Let some general go in your place, and you come up in rear as a reserve.” Sima Yi saw there was reason in this proposal, and he finally decided to send Qin Lang, with ten thousand troops, and Sima Yi himself would command the reserve. The night was fine with a bright moon. But about the middle of the second watch the sky clouded over, and it became very black, so that a man could not see his next neighbor. “This is providential,” chuckled Sima Yi. The expedition duly started, soldiers with gags, and horses with cords round their muzzles. They moved swiftly and silently, and Qin Lang made straight for the camp of Shu. But when he reached it, and entered, and saw not a soldier, he knew he had been tricked. He yelled to his troops to retire, but lights sprang up all round, and attacks began from four sides. Fight as he would, Qin Lang could not free himself. From behind the battle area Sima Yi saw flames rising from the camp of Shu and heard continuous shouting, but he knew not whether it meant victory for his own army or to his enemy. He pressed forward toward the fire. Suddenly, a shout, a roll of drums, and a blare of trumpets close at hand, a bomb that seemed to rend the earth, and Wei Yan and Jiang Wei bore down upon Sima Yi, one on each flank. This was the final blow to him. Of every ten soldiers of Wei, eight or nine were killed or wounded, and the few others scattered to the four winds. Meanwhile Qin Lang's ten thousand troops were falling under arrows that came in locust-flights, and their leader was killed. Sima Yi and the remnant of his army ran away to their own camp."

却說司馬懿正憂悶間，忽哨馬報說：“蜀兵用木牛流馬轉運糧草。人不大勞，牛馬不食。”懿大驚曰：“吾所以堅守不出者，為彼糧草不能接濟，欲待其自斃耳。今用此法，必為久遠之計，不思退矣——如之奈何？”急喚張虎、樂綝二人分付曰：“汝二人各引五百軍，從斜谷小路抄出；待蜀兵驅過木牛流馬，任他過盡，一齊殺出；不可多搶，只搶三五匹便回。”二人依令，各引五百軍，扮作蜀兵，夜間偷過小路，伏在谷中，果見高翔引兵驅木牛流馬而來。將次過盡，兩邊一齊鼓譟殺出。蜀兵措手不及，棄下數匹。張虎、樂綝歡喜驅回本寨。司馬懿看了，果然進退如活的一般，乃大喜曰：“汝會用此法，難道我不會用！”便令巧匠百餘人，當面拆開，分付依其尺寸長短厚薄之法，一樣製造木牛流馬。不消半月，造成二千餘隻，與孔明所造者一般法則，亦能奔走。遂令鎮遠將軍岑威，引一千軍驅駕木牛流馬，去隴西搬運糧草，往來不絕。魏營軍將，無不歡喜。,"However, Sima Yi said that Sima Yi was in a state of depression, and suddenly the horse newspaper said: ""The soldiers of Shu use wooden oxen and horses to transport food and grass. The people are not too tired, and the cattle and horses will not eat."" I want to wait for him to kill himself. Using this method now, it must be a long-term plan, and I don’t think about retreating—how can I do it?” Urgently called Zhang Hu and Le Chen to share them, saying, “You two lead five hundred dollars each. The army, copy it out from the Xiegu Road; wait for the Shu soldiers to drive past the wooden cows and horses, let them pass, and kill them all together; don’t rob more, only grab three or five horses and go back.” According to the order, the two led five hundred troops each, pretending to be Soldiers of Shu, who stole across the path at night and crouched in the valley, saw that Gao Xiang led his troops to drive the wooden oxen and horses. After the time was over, both sides shouted and killed together. The Shu soldiers were caught off guard and abandoned several horses. Zhang Hu and Le Chen Huanxi drove them back to the village. Sima Yi saw it, and it was as if the advance and retreat were alive. He was overjoyed and said, ""You know how to use this method, why can't I use it!"" He ordered more than a hundred skilled craftsmen to disassemble them in person, and distribute them according to their size, length, thickness and thickness. The same as making wooden cows and horses. In less than half a month, more than 2,000 animals were created, and they were able to run around in the same way as those created by Kongming. Then he ordered Cen Wei, the general of Zhenyuan, to lead a thousand troops to drive wooden oxen and horses to Longxi to carry grain and grass. Wei Ying generals are all happy.","That night eight or nine men out of ten of the Wei army die, Qin Lang among them, and Sima Yi only just escapes. For Kong Ming has used occult powers to bring the clouds in and then uses divine powers to clear them away afterwards. Zheng Wen is, of course, executed, and then Kong Ming tries to draw the Wei army out to the attack, but to no avail.","Sima Yi was already sad enough at his defeat, when the spies told him of these wooden bullocks and horses of new design which the soldiers of Shu were using to convey their grain. This troubled him still more, and he said to his generals, “I knew the transportation from the Lands of Rivers was difficult; therefore, I shut the gates and remained on the defensive waiting for the enemy to be starved. With this device, they may never be compelled to retreat for want of food.” Then he called up Zhang Hu and Yue Chen and gave orders: “Each of you with five hundred troops will goes to the Xie Valley by by-roads. When you see the Shu soldiers transport their grain by, you are to let them through, but only to attack at the end and capture four or five of the wooden horses and bullocks.” So a thousand soldiers went on this service disguised as soldiers of Shu. They made their way along the by-ways by night and hid. Presently the wooden convoy came along under the escort of Gao Xiang. Just as the end of it was passing, they made a sudden rush, and captured a few of the “animals” which the soldiers of Shu abandoned. In high glee they took them to their own camp. When Sima Yi saw them, he had to confess they were very life-like. But what pleased him most was that he could imitate them now that he had models. “If Zhuge Liang can use this sort of thing, it would be strange if I could not,” said he. He called to him many clever craftspeople and made them then and there take the machines to pieces and make some exactly like them. In less than half a month, they had completed a couple of thousand after Zhuge Liang's models, and the new mechanical animals could move. Then Sima Yi placed Cen Wei, General Who Guards the Frontiers, in charge of this new means of transport, and the “animals” began to ply between the camp and Xizhou. The Wei soldiers were filled with joys."

Cao Xian waited at the palace gate. When Mu Shun met Cao Cao, Cao asked, ""Where are you going?"" Shun replied, ""The Empress is ill and ordered to seek a doctor."" Cao said, ""Where is the doctor who has been summoned?"" Shun said, ""It hasn't been called yet. ""Fuck around, searched all over the body, there is no entrainment, let it go. Suddenly the wind blew off his hat. Cao called it back, took the hat and looked at it, and saw nothing, and returned the hat to wear it. Mu Shun put his cap on his hands upside down. Worried and suspicious, he searched left and right in his hair and found Fu Wanshu. When I read it, the words in the book want to connect with Sun and Liu as external responses. Cao was furious, and insisted that Mu Shun asked him in the secret room, but Shun refused to move. Cao ordered 3,000 armored soldiers overnight, surrounded Fu's private house, and captured both the young and the old; he found the book written by Fu Hou, and sent all the three Fu clan to prison. In the Ming Dynasty, the general of the imperial forest, Xi Lu, entered the palace on a festival, and first received the empress's seal.","‘Where have you been?’ asks Cao Cao. ‘The empress is sick, so I’ve been to call her doctor,’ says Mu Shun. ‘And where is this doctor?’ enquires Cao Cao. ‘Coming, coming,’ replies Mu Shun. But Cao Cao is not fooled. Mu Shun is searched, and before long the letter is found. Yet, despite torture, Mu Shun will not betray the empress. But to no avail. That night Cao Cao arrests Fu Wan and the whole family. Then he orders Chi Lü of the Royal Guard to go and seize the imperial seal of the empress.","But there was a traitor, and Cao Cao heard of the letters. So he waited at the palace gate for Mu Shun to come out. “Where are you going?” asked Cao Cao, when Mu Shun appeared. “The Empress is indisposed and has bidden me call a physician.” “Where is the summon for the physician?” “There is no summon.” Cao Cao bade his guards search Mu Shun, but they did not find the letter. So he was allowed to go. But just then a gust of wind blew off his hat, and it struck Cao Cao that that had not been examined. So Mu Shun was called back. Nothing was found in the hat, but when it was given back Mu Shun put it on with both hands. There was something suspicious about the movement, and Cao Cao bade the searchers examine his hair. Therein the letter of Fu Wan was found. Cao Cao read it; it said that Sun Quan and Liu Bei were to be induced to help. The unhappy Mu Shun was taken away into a secret place and interrogated, but he would confess nothing. That night three thousand soldiers surrounded the dwelling of Fu Wan, who was arrested with all his family. Searching the house, they found the first letter in the handwriting of the Empress. Fu Wan and his family were then consigned to a gaol. At dawn, a party of Imperial Guards, under Chi Lu, bearing ensigns of authority, entered the Palace with orders to take away the seal of the Empress."

Pi went out of the side hall and summoned Cao Zhizhi to see him. Hua Xin asked, ""Could it be that the Queen Mother persuaded Her Highness not to kill Zijian?"" Pi said, ""Of course."" Xin said, ""Zijian is talented and wise, and it will not be a thing in the pool. Later troubles."" Pi said, ""Mother's order must not be violated."" Xin said, ""Everyone said that the son's construction was complete, but the ministers did not believe it. The Lord can call in and try it. If not, kill him; Then he will be demoted, and he will never be spoken of by people in the world."" Pi followed it. After a while, Cao Zhizhi saw it, and fell down in fear to plead guilty. Pi said: ""Although I and you are brothers in love, our righteousness belongs to the monarch and minister. Are you safe and shy? In the past, when the emperor was in Japan, you often boasted to others with your articles. I deeply doubt that you will use someone else's ghostwriting. Recite a poem in seven steps. If you can, you will be spared death; if you can't, you will be punished severely, and will never be forgiven."" Zhi said, ""I would like to beg for the title."" At that time, there was an ink painting on the hall of two cows fighting each other. Under the earth wall, a cow fell into a well and died. Pi pointed to the painting and said, ""This painting is the title. It is not allowed to include the words 'under the wall of two oxen fighting, and one ox fell into a well and died'."" Zhi walked seven steps, and his poem was completed. The poem says:","Now Cao Pi wants to kill his brother, but his mother pleads with him to be compassionate. So instead, Cao Pi sets his brother a task. ‘You are renowned as a poet, so here is the task,’ he says. ‘Walk seven paces and by the end of that compose a poem based on this drawing of two bulls here on the wall. Do you see? One of them has died as a result of a fight and has fallen in a well. But you cannot say, “Two bulls fought beside a wall and one died in a well.” Cao Zhi takes the seven steps and then recites the following brand-new poem:","The Prince then went to a private room and bade them call his brother. Said Hua Xin, “Surely the Princess-Mother has just been interceding for your brother; is it not so?” “It is so,” replied the Prince. “Then let me say that Cao Zhi is too clever to be content to remain in a humble station. If you do not remove him, he will do you harm.” “I must obey my mother's command.” “People say your brother simply talks in literature. I do not believe it myself, but he might be put to the test. If he bears a false reputation, you can slay him; if what they say is true, then degrade him, lest the scholars of the land should babble.” Soon Cao Zhi came, and in a state of great trepidation bowed low before his elder brother, confessing his fault. The Prince addressed him, saying, “Though we are brothers, yet the proper relation between us of prince and minister must not be overlooked. Why then did you behave indecorously? While the late Prince lived, you made a boast of your literary powers, but I am disposed to think you may have made use of another's pen. Now I require you to compose a poem within the time taken to walk seven paces, and I will spare your life if you succeed. If you fail, then I shall punish you with rigor.” “Will you suggest a theme?” asked Cao Zhi. Now there was hanging in the hall a black and white sketch of two bulls that had been fighting at the foot of a wall, and one of them had just fallen dead into a well. Cao Pi pointed to the sketch and said, “Take that as the subject. But you are forbidden to use the words 'two bulls, one bull, fighting, wall's foot, falling, well and dead.'“ Cao Zhi took seven paces and then recited this poem:"

Kong Ming said: ""What is the insight of the old man, please ask for help."" The old man said: ""This is a few miles to the west, and there is a valley. After entering the interior for twenty miles, there is a stream called Wan'an Stream. There is a high-ranking scholar named 'Wan An Yin Man': This person has been out of the stream for more than ten years. There is a spring behind the grass nunnery, named Anle Spring. If you suffer from scabies, or feel miasma, you can bathe in Wan'an River, and nothing will happen. There is a first-class grass in front of the nunnery, called 'Xie Ye Yunxiang'. If a person has a leaf in his mouth, the miasma will not be polluted. The prime minister can ask for it quickly. It is."" Kong Ming thanked him, and asked, ""I am deeply impressed by the virtue of living in such a way. Would you like to hear Gao's surname?"" Guidance."" After saying this, he opened the temple and entered the stone wall. Kong Ming was astonished, worshipped the temple god again, searched for a car on the old road, and returned to Dazhai.","From him Kong Ming learns about all four of the deadly springs and how to protect his men from their effects. ‘ Travel only in the afternoon, when the mists have cleared, and chew on a special herb.’ To find this, Kong Ming is told to go deeper into the countryside until he comes to the valley of the stream of Everlasting Peace. ‘Here you will find a hermit and before his hut flows the spring of Peace and Happiness. These waters will cure those already afflicted, and here grows the special herb of protection,’ says the old man. ‘Who are you, sir?’ asks Kong Ming. ‘I am the guardian spirit of this mountain sent to help you by General Ma Yuan.’ So saying, he disappears. The very next day Kong Ming and his affected men travel to the valley and find the spring and the hermit.","“In short, the Mangs cannot be conquered,” said Zhuge Liang when the old man had finished. “And Wu cannot be repressed, nor Wei overcome. And the Hans cannot be restored. So, I fail in the task set me by my Prince. Wish that I might die?” “Be not so cast down, O Minister,” said the aged one. “I can lead you to a place where you may counteract all this.” “I would ask for your instruction, Venerable One,” said Zhuge Liang. “What exalted advice have you to confer upon me? I hope you will instruct me.” “West of this, not far off, is a valley, and seven miles from its entrance is a stream called the 'Spring of Eternal Peace,' near which there lives a recluse known as the Hermit of the Stream. He has not left the valley these twenty years. Behind his hut there gushes out a spring of water, called the 'Spring of Peace and Joy.' This is the antidote to your poison. Bathing in its waters is a cure for skin diseases and for malaria. Moreover, near the hut grows an herb called the 'garlic-leaved fragrance.' Chewing a leaf of this safeguards one from malaria. You can do no better than go to the hut of the recluse forthwith and get these remedies.” Zhuge Liang humbly thanked his aged counselor, and said, “Venerable Sir, I am profoundly affected by your merciful kindness and compassion. May I ask again by what name may call you?” The old man rose and entered the temple, saying, “I am the Spirit of this mountain, sent by Ma Yuan to guide you.” As he said this, he shouted at the solid rock behind the temple, and it opened of itself and let him in. Zhuge Liang's astonishment was beyond words. He made another obeisance to the Spirit of the temple and went down by the way he had come. Then he returned to his camp."

Xuande hurriedly summoned him to ask him. The two of them said that Jingzhou was at a loss, and Guan Gong's soldiers were defeated and asked for help, and they submitted a form. Before the demolition of the temple, the courtier again played Liao Huazhi from Jingzhou. Xuande called in urgently. He cried and worshipped the ground, and recited the fact that Liu Feng and Meng Da did not send troops to rescue them. Xuande was shocked and said: ""If this is the case, my brother will rest!"" Kong Ming said: ""Liu Feng and Meng Da are so rude, the crime cannot be punished! The king is relieved, and Liang personally mentions the teacher of a trip to rescue Jingxiang. Urgent."" Xuande wept and said, ""Yunchang has a loss, and he is not alone! When he is alone, he will bring an army to rescue Yunchang!"" Before dawn, he reported several times in a row, saying that Guan Gongye came to Ju at night, and it was captured by General Wu. After Xuande heard it, he shouted and fell to the ground. Exactly:","However, Xuande has overheard this and shouts, ‘Why did you try to keep this terrible news from me?’ ‘But it could just be rumours,’ replies a flustered Kong Ming. Then Ma Liang and Yi Ji arrive to report the fall of Jingzhou and Guan Yu’s plea for help. But hot on their heels comes Liao Hua, who, with tears flowing, reports how Liu Feng and Meng Da refused to come to Guan Yu’s aid. Horrified, Xuande says, ‘Then there is no hope for my brother.’ ‘Death is too good for such traitors,’ says Kong Ming. ‘Be reassured, my lord, I’ll take an army and take back Jingzhou.’ But Xuande cannot be consoled, crying out that he cannot bear the thought of life without his brother and that he himself will lead the attack. A messenger is sent to inform the other brother, Zhang Fei, of what has happened. As the day breaks the final round of news comes in. The fall of Jingzhou; Guan Yu’s flight; his capture; his loyalty; and his death alongside his son.","The two men soothed their lord as best they could; but even as they spoke to him, one of the private attendants said that Ma Liang and Yi Ji had arrived. Liu Bei called them in and questioned them eagerly. They said, “Jingzhou has indeed been lost, and Guan Yu begs for instant help.” The letters they brought had not been read before Liao Hua was ushered in. He prostrated himself and, weeping, told the story of the refusal of help on the part of Liu Feng and Meng Da. “Then is my brother lost!” cried Liu Bei. “If those two have really behaved so badly, the offense is even too great for death,” said Zhuge Liang. “But calm yourself, O Prince. I will see about an army and lead it to the rescue.” “If Guan Yu is gone, I cannot live,” moaned Liu Bei. “Tomorrow I myself will set out with an army to rescue him.” Liu Bei sent off a messenger to Zhang Fei in Langzhong and gave orders to muster horse and foot for instant departure. Before day dawned other messengers arrived, giving step by step the sequence of the tragedy: “Guan Yu had cut his way to Linju at night and been captured by a general of Wu. He had refused to bend, and both father and son had gone to the Nine Springs.” When he heard of the final catastrophe, Liu Bei uttered a great cry and fell swooning. His mind went back to the pledge of days gone by;"
褘辭延出營，急到大寨見楊儀，具述魏延之語。儀曰：“丞相臨終，曾密囑我曰：‘魏延必有異志。’今我以兵符往，實欲探其心耳。今果應丞相之言。吾自令伯約斷後可也。”於是楊儀領兵扶柩先行，令姜維斷後；依孔明遺令，徐徐而退。魏延在寨中，不見費褘來回覆，心中疑惑，乃令馬岱引十數騎往探消息。回報曰：“後軍乃姜維總督，前軍大半退入谷中去了。”延大怒曰：“豎儒安敢欺我！我必殺之！”因顧謂岱曰：“公肯相助否？”岱曰：“吾亦素恨楊儀，今願助將軍攻之。”延大喜，卽拔寨引本部兵望南而行。,"Bang Ciyan left the camp and rushed to Dazhai to see Yang Yi and recount Wei Yan's words. Yi said: ""When the Prime Minister was about to die, he once secretly told me: 'Wei Yan must have a different ambition.' So Yang Yi led the troops to support the coffin first, and ordered Jiang Wei to cut off the back. Wei Yan was in the village, but he didn't see Fei's reply, so he was puzzled, so he ordered Ma Dai to lead dozens of horses to find out the news. In return, he said, ""The latter army is Governor Jiang Wei, and most of the former army has retreated into the valley."" Yan was furious and said, ""Shu Ru'an dares to deceive me! I will kill him!"" ?"" Dai said: ""I also hate Yang Yi, and now I would like to help the general to attack him."" Yan was overjoyed, and he pulled out the village and led his troops to the south.","To pacify Wei Yan, Fei Yi promises to discuss this with Yang Yi, but when he tells Yang Yi of the conversation, he says that Kong Ming warned that Wei Yan would rebel. So instead of Wei Yan at the rear, Jiang Wei takes this position, and the army begins to move out. When Fei Yi doesn’t return, Wei Yan begins to be suspicious. Discovering that Jiang Wei has on Yang Yi ’s command taken the rearguard position, he grows indignant and, turning to Ma Dai, asks him to help him kill Yang Yi. Pretending to agree, Ma Dai goes with Wei Yan and his troops.","Wei Yan agreed, and Fei Yi went back to the main camp and told Yang Yi what had passed. Yang Yi replied, “When near death the Prime Minister confided to me that Wei Yan would turn traitor. I sent him the authority to test him, and now he has discovered himself as the Prime Minister foretold. So I will direct Jiang Wei to command the rearguard.” The coffer containing the remains of Zhuge Liang was sent on in advance, and Jiang Wei took up his post to cover the retreat. Meanwhile Wei Yan sat in his tent waiting for the return of Fei Yi and was perplexed at the delay. When the suspense became unbearable, he sent Ma Dai to find out the reason. Ma Dai returned and told him: “Jiang Wei is covering the retreat, and that most of the army has already gone.” Wei Yan was furious. “How dare he play with me, the pedantic blockhead?” cried he. “But he shall die for this.” Turning to Ma Dai, Wei Yan said, “Will you help me?” Ma Dai replied, “I have long hated Yang Yi; certainly I am ready to attack him.” So Wei Yan broke camp and marched southward."

遂集大小將士聽令：使朱然於水路進兵，來日午後東南風大作，用船裝載茅草，依計而行。韓當引一軍攻江北岸，周泰引一軍攻江南岸。每人手執茅草一把，內藏硫黃燄硝，各帶火種，各執鎗刀，一齊而上。但到蜀營，順風舉火。蜀兵四十屯，只燒二十屯，每間一屯燒一屯。各軍預帶乾糧，不許暫退。晝夜追襲，只擒了劉備方止。衆將聽了軍令，各受計而去。,"Then they assembled large and small soldiers and obeyed the order: let Zhu Ran march on the waterway, the southeast wind will be strong in the afternoon, and the boats will be loaded with thatch, and they will go according to the plan. Han Dang led an army to attack the northern bank of the Jiang, and Zhou Tai led an army to attack the southern bank of the Jiang. Each person holds a piece of thatch with sulphur flaming nitrate in it, each with a fire, each with a gun and a knife, and they go up together. But when they arrived at Shuying, they lifted fire with the wind. The soldiers of Shu had forty tuns, but only 20 tuns were burned, and one tun was burned for each tun. All armies bring dry rations in advance and are not allowed to retire temporarily. They pursued day and night, but only captured Liu Bei and Fang Zhi. The generals listened to the order and went away.","‘Fill your boats with straw. Han Dang is to attack the north shore and Zhou Tai the south. Every soldier must carry his weapons and a bundle of straw with explosive materials inside. As soon as you reach the enemy camps set fire to the bundles. Set fire to all forty of the camps. Make sure you have food enough for a couple of days and hunt the enemy down day after day until you capture Xuande.’ Back at the first ruler’s camp, he is confident that the enemy cannot prevail but he is persuaded to issue orders to Zhang Bao and Guan Xing to go and see if there is any movement by the enemy.","Then he summoned his generals to receive orders: “Zhu Ran is to lead the marine force. He is to advance next day afternoon, when the southeast wind will serve. His ships are laden with reeds and straw, which are to be used as ordered. Han Dang is to attack the north bank, Zhou Tai the south. Each soldier, in addition to his weapons, is to carry a bundle of straw or reeds, with sulfur and saltpeter hidden therein, and each has a piece of tinder. They are to advance, and, when they reach the Shu camps, they are to start a conflagration. But they are to burn only alternate camps, twenty in all, leaving the others untouched. They are to advance and only stop if they capture Liu Bei.” The leaders received the orders and so set out."
且說後主在成都，寢食不安，動止不寧；夜作一夢，夢見成都錦屏山崩倒；遂驚覺，坐而待旦，聚集文武，入朝圓夢。譙周曰：“臣昨夜仰觀天文，見一星，赤色，光芒有角，自東北落於西南，主丞相有大凶之事。今陛下夢山崩，正應此兆。”後主愈加驚怖。忽報李福到，後主急召入問之。福頓首泣奏丞相已亡；將丞相臨終言語，細述一遍。後主聞言大哭曰：“天喪我也！”哭倒於龍牀之上。侍臣扶入後宮。吳太后聞之，亦放聲大哭不已。多官無不哀慟，百姓人人涕泣。後主連日傷感，不能設朝。忽報魏延表奏楊儀造反，羣臣大駭，入宮啟奏後主——時吳太后亦在宮中。後主聞奏大驚，命近臣讀魏延表。其略曰：,"Let’s say that the Empress was in Chengdu, restless in sleep and food, and restless in movement. At night, I had a dream that the Jinping Mountain in Chengdu collapsed; Qiao Zhou said: ""I looked up at the astronomy last night, and saw a star, red, with horns, falling from the northeast to the southwest. The prime minister has a terrible thing. Today, your majesty dreams of a landslide, which is exactly the omen."" . Suddenly, Li Fu was reported to be there, and the Lord hurriedly summoned him to ask him. Fulton first sobbed and announced that the Prime Minister was dead; recited the Prime Minister's dying words in detail. When the queen heard this, he wept and said, ""Heaven mourn me!"" He fell on the dragon bed crying. The courtiers helped into the harem. The Queen Mother Wu also burst into tears when she heard it. Many officials mourned, and the people wept. The queen was sad for days and could not set the dynasty. Suddenly, Wei Yan reported that Yang Yi had rebelled, and the ministers were horrified. They entered the palace and played the empress master—the Empress Dowager Wu was also in the palace at that time. The later master was shocked when he heard the performance, and ordered his close officials to read Wei Yan's table. It briefly says:","A back road is found, and messengers sent to Chengdu to inform the second ruler of Wei Yan’s rebellion. In Chengdu, the second ruler has had a dream of an avalanche, and when he summons his advisers to interpret this, they tell him of the star that has fallen to earth and that these portents all mean Kong Ming has died. The arrival of Li Fu confirms that this is true and the second ruler collapses with grief. All are deeply moved, and even the ordinary folk cry aloud. It is a few days later that Wei Yan’s petition arrives declaring that Yang Yi has usurped power and only he, Wei Yan, stands against him.","Meanwhile in Chengdu the Latter Ruler of Shu was troubled; he lost his appetite and was sleepless. Then he dreamed that the Silky Hills that protected his capital was rived and fell. This dream troubled him till morning, when he called in his officers of all ranks to ask them to interpret his vision. When he had related his dream, Qiao Zhou stood forth and said, “Last night I saw a large red star fall from the northeast to the southwest; surely it forebodes a misfortune to the First Minister. Your Majesty's dream corresponds to what I saw.” The Latter Ruler's anxiety increased. Presently Li Fu returned and was summoned into the Latter Ruler's presence. Li Fu bowed his head and wept, saying, “The Prime Minister is dead.” He repeated Zhuge Liang's last messages and told all that he knew. The Latter Ruler was overcome with great sorrow, and wailed, crying, “Heaven smites me!” and he fell over and lay upon his couch. They led him within to the inner chambers; and when Empress Wu, the Empress Dowager, heard the sad tidings, she also wailed without ceasing. And all the officers were distressed and wept, and the common people showed their grief. The Latter Ruler was deeply affected, and for many days could hold no court. And while thus prostrate with grief, they told him that Wei Yan had sent up a memorial charging Yang Yi with rebellion. The astounded courtiers went to the Latter Ruler's chamber to talk over this thing, and Empress Wu was also there. The memorial was read aloud. It was much like this:"
却說吳將朱桓，年方二十七歲，極有膽略，孫權甚愛之；時督軍於濡須，聞曹仁引大軍去取羨溪，桓遂盡撥軍守把羨溪去了，止留五千騎守城。忽報曹仁令大將常雕同諸葛虔、王雙，引五萬精兵飛奔濡須城來。衆軍皆有懼色。桓按劍而言曰：“勝負在將，不在兵之多寡。兵法云；‘客兵倍而主兵半者，主兵尚能勝於客兵。’今曹仁千里跋涉，人馬疲困。吾與汝等，共據高城，南臨大江，北背山險，以逸待勞，以主制客：此乃百戰百勝之勢。雖曹丕自來，尚不足憂，況仁等耶？”於是傳令，敎衆軍偃旗息鼓，只作無人守把之狀。,"However, it was said that the Wu general Zhu Huan was twenty-seven years old, very courageous, and Sun Quan loved him very much. At that time, the commander of the army, Yu Shuxu, heard that Cao Ren led a large army to take Xianxi, and Huan then sent the army to guard Xianxi. Five thousand cavalry remained to defend the city. Cao Ren suddenly reported that the general Chang Diao, together with Zhuge Qian and Wang Shuang, led 50,000 elite soldiers to fly to Ruxu City. All the troops were terrified. According to the sword, Huan said: ""The victory or defeat depends on the generals, not the number of soldiers. The art of warfare says: 'If the number of guest soldiers is doubled and the main soldier is half, the main soldier can still outperform the guest soldiers.' You and others, occupying Gaocheng together, facing the big river in the south, and facing the mountains in the north, take care of yourselves, and control the guests with your master: this is the trend of a hundred victories in a hundred battles. Even though Cao Pi came by himself, there is nothing to worry about, so what are you waiting for?"" The army died down, just as if there were no guards.","An attack by Cao Ren on Xianxi is skilfully defeated by Zhu Huan despite his youth – he is only twenty-seven. He easily traps the advance party led by Chang Diao, whom he personally slays on the battlefield, then trounces Cao Ren’s own troop, seizing vast quantities of arms, horses and provisions.","The Wu leader, Zhu Huan, who had been sent against Cao Ren at Ruxu, was a young man of twenty-seven. He was bold and resourceful, and Sun Quan held him in great regard. Hearing that Cao Ren was going to attack Xianxi, Zhu Huan led the bulk of his troops to defend it, leaving only five thousand troops in Ruxu. Then he heard that the van of the enemy, fifty thousand under Commander Chang Diao, with the aid of Zhuge Qian and Wang Shuang, had made a dash for Ruxu, so he hastened back and found the officers were in great fear. Drawing his sword, he made a speech, “Success depends upon the leader rather than on the number of soldiers. The Art of War says that the value of one soldier who inhabits the place equals that of two soldiers who come from afar; and those who are in possession, however in small number, can overcome those who come from afar. Now the enemy is weary from a long march, and I and you, my men, can hold this place together. We have the Great River to defend us on the south, and we are backed by the mountains on the north. Success should be ours easily, and we are as hosts at home awaiting the arrival of our weary visitors. This will give us victory in every fight. Even if Cao Pi comes, we need feel no anxiety. How much less care we for Cao Ren and his troops?”"
建安二十一年，夏五月，羣臣表奏獻帝，頌魏公曹操功德，極天際地，伊、周莫及，宜進爵為王。獻帝卽令鍾繇草詔，冊立曹操為“魏王”。曹操假意上書三辭。詔三報不許，操乃拜命受“魏王”之爵，冕十二旒，乘金根車，駕六馬，用天子車服鑾儀，出警入蹕，於鄴郡蓋魏王宮，議立世子。操大妻丁夫人無出。妾劉氏生子曹昂，因征張繡時死於宛城。卞氏所生四子：長曰丕，次曰彰，三曰植，四曰熊。於是黜丁夫人，而立卞氏為魏王妃。第三子曹植，字子建，極聰明，舉筆成章，操欲立之為後嗣。長子曹丕，恐不得立，乃問計於中大夫賈詡。詡敎如此如此。自是但凡操出征，諸子送行，曹植乃稱述功德，發言成章；惟曹丕辭父，只是流涕而拜，左右皆感傷。於是操疑植乖巧，誠心不及丕也。丕又使人買囑近侍，皆言丕之德。操欲立後嗣，躊躇不定，乃問賈詡曰：“孤欲立後嗣，當立誰？”賈詡不答，操問其故。詡曰：“正有所思，故不能卽答耳。”操曰：“何所思？”詡對曰：“思袁本初、劉景升父子也。”操大笑，遂立長子曹丕為王世子。,"In the 21st year of Jian'an, in the fifth month of summer, the ministers performed the tribute to the emperor, and praised the merits of Cao Cao, Duke of Wei. Emperor Xian ordered Zhong Yao to issue an imperial edict, and established Cao Cao as ""King of Wei"". Cao Cao pretended to write three words. Cao Nai was ordered to receive the title of ""King of Wei"", with a crown of twelve, riding a golden root chariot, driving six horses, using the emperor's chariot to dress Luan Yi, leaving the police and entering the palace, building the Weiwang Palace in Ye County, and making a decision. Shizi. The eldest wife, Mrs. Ding, has not come out. Concubine Liu gave birth to a son Cao Ang, who died in Wancheng during the expedition of Zhang Xiu. Bian's four sons were named Pi, the second was Zhang, the third was Zhi, and the fourth was Xiong. So Mrs. Ding was dismissed, and Mrs. Bian was established as Princess Wei. The third son, Cao Zhi, with the word Zijian, is very smart, and he is very smart, and he wants to establish him as an heir. The eldest son, Cao Pi, was afraid that he would not be able to stand, so he asked Jia Xu, a doctor in the middle school. Guess it is so. Since when Cao Cao went on an expedition and all the sons saw him off, Cao Zhi said his merits and made a speech; but when Cao Pi resigned his father, he just bowed with tears, and both left and right were sentimental. So Cao suspected that Zhi Zhi was well-behaved, and his sincerity was not as good as Pi's. Pi also ordered people to buy and instruct his attendants, all of whom spoke of the virtues of Pi. Cao wanted to establish an heir, but hesitated, so he asked Jia Xu, ""I want to establish an heir, who should be established?"" Jia Xu did not answer, and Cao asked the reason. Xu said, ""I'm thinking about something, so I can't answer it."" Cao said, ""What are you thinking about?"" Xu replied, ""I think about Yuan Benchu, Liu Jingsheng and his son."" Cao laughed, and made his eldest son, Cao Pi, the prince of the king.","He has heralds to clear the way as if he is the emperor and builds himself a grand palace at Yejun. All this is, of course, part of his designs to establish his own dynasty. Planning for the establishment of his dynasty, he decides to name his heir apparent. His main wife, Lady Ding, is barren while his concubine Lady Liu lost her son Cao Ang during the war. So he initially choses Cao Zhi, famous as a poet and scholar, one of his four sons by his concubine Lady Bian. Removing Lady Ding, he makes Lady Bian his principal wife. Her eldest son, Cao Pi, is furious at being bypassed and asks Jia Xu’s advice. As a result, he starts to turn up whenever his father goes out to fight, weeping and throwing himself on the floor as if deeply troubled at the risks his father is taking. In comparison, Cao Zhi writes long poems about his father’s exploits. Cao Pi also uses bribery to get those close to Cao Cao to sing his praises. Over time, Cao Cao is persuaded that Cao Pi is a more loyal son. Cao Cao is now very unsure what to do, so he asks advice from Jia Xu. His advice is to choose Cao Pi, and so it is that he becomes the heir apparent.","In the twenty-first year of Rebuilt Tranquillity (216), in the fifth month of that year, a great memorial signed by many officers went up to Emperor Xian, praying: “The Duke of Wei has rendered so great services that no minister before him, in Heaven as well as on Earth, not even Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou, could match his manifest merits to the state. Thus, the title of kingship should be granted to him.” The memorial was approved, and a draft edict was prepared by the famous Zhong Yao to make Cao Cao Prince of Wei. Thrice Cao Cao with seeming modesty pretended to decline the honor, but thrice was his refusal rejected. Finally he made his obeisance and was enrolled as Prince of Wei with the usual insignia and privileges, a coronet with twelve strings of beads and a chariot with gilt shafts, drawn by six steeds. Using the formalities of the Son of God, he decorated his imperial chariot with bells and had the roads cleared when he passed along. He built himself a palace at Yejun. Then he began to discuss the appointment of an heir-apparent. His principal wife, Lady Ding, was without issue; but a concubine, Lady Liu, had borne him a son, Cao Ang, who had been killed in battle at the siege of Wancheng when Cao Cao fought against Zhang Xiu. A second concubine, Lady Bian, had borne him four sons: Cao Pi, Cao Zhang, Cao Zhi, and Cao Xiong. Wherefore he elevated Lady Bian to the rank of Queen of Wei in place of Lady Ding. The third son, Cao Zhi, was very clever and a ready master of composition. Cao Cao wished him to be named the heir. Then the eldest son, Cao Pi sought from the High Adviser Jia Xu a plan to secure his rights of primogeniture, and Jia Xu told him to do so and so. Thereafter, whenever the father went out on any military expedition, Cao Zhi wrote fulsome panegyrics, but Cao Pi wept so copiously at bidding his father farewell that the courtiers were deeply affected and remarked that though Cao Zhi was crafty and clever, he was not so sincerely filial as Cao Pi. Cao Pi also bought over his father's immediate attendants, who then rang the praises of his virtues so loud that Cao Cao was strongly disposed to name him as the heir after all. After hesitating a long time, the matter was referred to Jia Xu. “I wish to name my heir; who shall it be?” said Cao Cao. Jia Xu would not say, and Cao Cao asked why. “I was just recalling the past in my mind and could not reply at once,” said Jia Xu. “What were you recalling?” “I was thinking of two fathers, Yuan Shao and Liu Biao, and their sons.” Cao Cao smiled. Soon after this he declared his eldest son his heir."

Let's say that Ma Liang went to Sichuan, and when he came to see Kongming, he presented the picture above and said, ""Now we have moved the camp to Jiajiang, which covers 700 li across the river, and more than 40 villages below. Let the prime minister look at the picture originally."" When Kong Ming saw it, he slapped the table and complained, ""Who ordered the Lord to go down the village like this? You can kill this person!"" Ma Liang said, ""It's all the Lord's own actions, not the conspiracy of others."" Kong Ming He sighed and said, ""The Han Dynasty is over!"" Liang asked why. Kong Ming said: ""Bao Yuanxi is in danger and forms a camp. This is a big taboo for the military family. If he attacks with fire, how can he be rescued? How can there be even a camp of seven hundred miles and can resist the enemy? The disaster is not far away! Lu Xun refused to defend. You should go to see the Son of Heaven quickly and change the camps, you can't do this."" Liang said, ""If Wu's army has already won, what will happen to it?"" Kong Ming said, ""Lu Xun dare not come after him, Chengdu. You can keep it safe."" Liang said, ""Why didn't you pursue Xun?"" Kong Ming said, ""I'm afraid that Wei soldiers will attack him. If the lord loses, he should go to Baidi City to avoid him. Ten thousand soldiers are at Yufupu."" Liang was shocked and said, ""A certain person has come and gone in Yufupu several times, but he has never seen a single soldier. Why did the prime minister make such a lie?"" Kong Ming said, ""I will see you later, don't bother to ask too much."" Ma Liang asked for a seal and rushed to the imperial camp. Kong Ming returned to Chengdu and dispatched troops and horses to rescue him.","He sends orders to his own front lines to be ready to attack Wu when the south is fully engaged in defeating the army of Shu. The map showing the placement of the camps at last reaches Kong Ming, far away on the eastern border of Shu. Slamming his fist onto the table, he exclaims, ‘Who the hell presented this idea to our lord? He should be executed!’ ‘None other than our lord himself,’ replies Ma Liang, the messenger. ‘Then the vitality of the Han is ending,’ says Kong Ming. ‘But why? asks Ma Liang. ‘Because to lay out your forces like this goes against every rule in the book,’ says Kong Ming. ‘Get back as fast as possible and tell the Son of Heaven to move his camps closer together and away from such restrictive manoeuvring space, because being surrounded by woods and streams will be fatal if they are attacked. If you are too late, tell our lord to escape to Baidi. I’ve left ten thousand men there just in case.’ ‘But I travelled past there on my way here and saw no one,’ says Ma Liang. ‘Are you really telling the truth?’ ‘They’re there, so don’t worry.’ And with that Kong Ming gives Ma Liang the urgent message, and he sets off immediately, riding pell-mell for the first ruler’s camp.","The Ruler of Wei would himself bring up the reinforcement in this southern campaign. Reaching Chengdu, Ma Liang lost no time in seeing the Prime Minister and presenting the plan of the armies as they were in the field. “Now the forces are on both sides of the Great River extending along a front of two hundred miles, with forty stations, each beside a mountain stream or in a pleasantly shaded forest. At our lord's command, I prepared this map, and he sent me to ask your opinion.” “Who advised such an arrangement? He ought to be put to death, whoever it was,” cried Zhuge Liang sorrowfully, tapping the table at his side. “It is entirely our lord's own work; no other had any hand in it,” said Ma Liang. “The life and energy of the Hans are done indeed,” said Zhuge Liang. “He has committed those very faults which the rules of the Art of War lay down as to be particularly avoided. The camps are made where free movement is impossible, and nothing can save him if the enemy use fire. Beside, what defense is possible along a two-hundred-mile front? Disaster is at hand, and Lu Xun sees it all, which explains his obstinate refusal to come out into the open. Go back as quickly as you can and tell our lord that this will not do, that it must be changed at once.” “But if I am too late—if Wu has already attacked and won—, what then?” “The enemy will not dare to follow up their victory by a march on Chengdu. So this capital is secure.” “Why will they not?” “Wei is behind their back; that is why. Our lord will be compelled to shelter in Baidicheng. I have already placed ten thousand troops in hiding at Fishbelly Creek.” “Have you? I have been up and down that creek three or four times without seeing a soldier. I do not see the reason of telling lies to me,” said Ma Liang. “You will see; do not ask so many questions.” With the precious instructions which he had persuaded Zhuge Liang to draw up, Ma Liang hastened back to the imperial camp, while Zhuge Liang went to the capital to prepare a relief expedition. The soldiers of Shu had become slack and idle and no longer maintained adequate defense, wherefore"

In the past, when the world was in great chaos, the Ming government used Wu to stifle it, and nine out of ten. Now those who have not accepted the king's order are Wu and Shu'er. Wu has the danger of the Yangtze River, and Shu has the resistance of Chongshan, which makes it difficult to fight. I foolishly thought that it would be better to increase Wende, to sleep on soldiers according to armor, to stop the army and raise the soldiers, and to move from time to time. Today, if hundreds of thousands of people are gathered on the banks of the Yangtze River, if the thieves hide deep in the danger, so that our soldiers and horses cannot use their powers, and they have no use for their powers, the power of heaven will be subdued: only Ming Gong will investigate carefully.","You’re renowned, sir,’ writes Fu Gan, ‘for your success in suppressing rebels and bandits. You have complete control over much of the empire, with the exceptions of Shu and Wu. Of these Wu is guarded by the Great river and Shu by mountain ranges. Concentrate your efforts not on conquest but on good government. You should accept that the empire has been divided into three.","“I, Fu Gan, understand that inspiring fear is the chief consideration in war, as inculcating virtue is in government. These two combined in one person fit him to be a prince. Formerly, in the days of disturbance, you, Illustrious Sir, attacked the rebels and restored tranquillity almost everywhere, the only regions unsubdued and not under your control being Wu and Shu. The former of these is protected by the Great River, the latter secured by its mountains, and both difficult to conquer by force of arms. My humble opinion is that it is more fitting to increase the authority of civil government, to lay aside arms and rest weapons, to cease from war and train your soldiers until the times shall be favorable. If your mighty legions be now sent to camp on the river bank and the rebels should take refuge behind their natural defenses, your soldiers will be unable to prove their prowess; and should extraordinary strategies be planned, the rebels will not be available. In such a case your high prestige would be impaired. I trust, Illustrious Sir, you will deign to examine this.”"
是夜北風大作，操盡驅兵士擔土潑水；為無盛水之具，作縑囊盛水澆之，隨築隨凍。比及天明，沙水凍緊，土城已築完。細作報知馬超。超領兵觀之，大驚，疑有神助。次日，集大軍鳴鼓而進。操自乘馬出營，止有許褚一人隨後。操揚鞭大呼曰：“孟德單騎至此，請馬超出來答話。”超乘馬挺鎗而出。操曰：“汝欺我營寨不成，今一夜天已築就，汝何不早降！”馬超大怒，意欲突前擒之，見操背後一人睜圓怪眼，手提鋼刀，勒馬而立。超疑是許褚，乃揚鞭問曰：“聞汝軍中有虎侯，安在哉？”許褚提刀大叫曰：“吾卽譙郡許褚也！”目射神光，威風抖擻。超不敢動，乃勒馬回。操亦引許褚回寨。兩軍觀之，無不駭然。操謂諸將曰：“賊亦知仲康乃虎侯也？”自此軍中皆稱褚為虎侯。許褚曰：“某來日必擒馬超。”操曰：“馬超英勇，不可輕敵。”褚曰：“某誓與死戰！”卽使人下戰書，說虎侯單搦馬超來日決戰。超接書大怒曰：“何敢如此相欺耶！”卽批次日誓殺“虎癡”。,"It was the night when the north wind was blowing so hard that it drove the soldiers to carry the soil and pour water; as there was no water container, they made a bag to hold the water, and it was frozen as they were built. Compared with the dawn, the sand and water were frozen, and the earth city had been built. Make a detailed report to know Ma Chao. The super leader watched it, shocked, and suspected that there was divine help. The next day, a large army marched in with drums. Cao rode out of the camp on his own horse, only Xu Chu followed. Cao whipped the whip and shouted, ""Meng De has come here alone, please let Ma Chao come and answer."" Chao riding his horse and spearing out. Cao said, ""You lied to me that the camp could not be built. The sky has been built overnight. Why didn't you come down earlier!"" Ma Chao was furious and wanted to arrest him. Suspecting that it was Xu Chu, he raised his whip and asked, ""I heard that there is a Tiger Marquis in your army, are you safe?"" Chao didn't dare to move, so he pulled his horse back. Cao also led Xu Chu back to the village. The two armies were amazed. Cao called the generals and said, ""Do the thieves know that Zhongkang is also the Marquis of Tiger?"" Xu Chu said, ""A certain day will surely capture Ma Chao."" Cao said, ""Ma Chao is heroic and should not underestimate the enemy."" Chu said, ""A certain oath will fight to the death!"" Chao Jieshu was furious and said, ""How dare you deceive each other like this!""","A bitingly cold wind is about to sweep down upon them, and this will mean that if they build the walls and wet them then the bitter cold will freeze them as solid as blocks of ice and make the walls firm. When Ma Chao sees what has happened he begins to wonder if Cao Cao has gained the support of the deities! The next day he advances upon Cao Cao, and this swiftly turns into a personal challenge. Ma Chao can see that beside Cao Cao there is a mighty warrior whom he is sure is Xu Chu – known also as Lord Tiger.","That night the wind came down in full force. Every man possible was set to earth-carrying and wetting. As they had no other means of carrying water, they made stuff bags which they filled with water and let out the water over the earth. And so as they piled the earth, they froze it solid with water, and by dawn the wall was finished and stood firm. When his scouts told Ma Chao that the enemy had built a wall, he rode out and saw it. Ma Chao was greatly perplexed and began to suspect help from the gods. However, very soon after, he got his whole army together and sounded an attack. Cao Cao himself rode out of the camp, with only the redoubtable Xu Chu in attendance, and advanced toward the enemy. Flourishing his whip he called out, “I, Cao Cao, am here alone, and I beg Ma Chao to come out to parley with me.” Thereupon Ma Chao rode out, his spear set ready to thrust. “You despised me because I had no wall to my camp, but lo! in one single night, God has made me a wall. Do you not think it time to give in?” Ma Chao was so enraged that he almost rushed at Cao Cao, but he was not too angry to notice the henchman behind him, glaring in angry fashion, who held a gleaming sword in his grip. Ma Chao thought this man could be no other than Xu Chu, so he determined to find out. With a flourish of his whip, he said, “Where is the noble 'Marquis Tiger' that I hear you have in your camp?” At this Xu Chu lifted his sword and roared, “I am Xu Chu of Qiao!” From Xu Chu's eyes shot gleams of supernatural light and his attitude was so terror-striking that Ma Chao dared not move. He turned his steed and retired. Cao Cao and his doughty follower returned to their camp; and as they two passed between the armies, not a man there but felt a quiver of fear. “They know our friend Xu Chu over there as Marquis Tiger,” said Cao Cao when he returned. And thereafter the soldiers all called Xu Chu by that name. “I will capture that fellow Ma Chao tomorrow,” said Xu Chu. “Ma Chao is very bold,” said his master. “Be careful!” “I swear to fight him to the death,” said Xu Chu. Then Xu Chu sent a written challenge to his enemy saying that the Marquis Tiger challenged Ma Chao to a decisive duel on the morrow. Ma Chao was very angry when he received the letter. “Dare he insult me so?” cried he."

Yang Yigu is the queen of the starry night. The latter decree said: ""The name has justified his crimes, but he still recites his previous merits, and he will be buried with a coffin."" Yang Yi and others helped Kong Ming's coffin to Chengdu. Then the Lord burst into tears. Up to the public officials, down to the people in the mountains and forests, men and women, young and old, all wept bitterly and mournfully shook the ground. Later, the Lord ordered the coffin to enter the city and stopped at the Prime Minister's residence. His son Zhuge Zhan was filial piety and lived in mourning.","A mere silk bag, a plan no one could imagine, Was what seized the day! When news reaches the second ruler he orders that Wei Yan be buried with honours as befitted his earlier bravery and valour for the kingdom. By now the body of Kong Ming has reached the outskirts of the capital, and everyone from ruler to peasant comes out to greet and to mourn Kong Ming. In every valley and on every hill, ordinary folk weep. Yang Yi is rewarded by being given high honours, while Ma Dai is given the high rank that was previously held by Wei Yan.","So before Dong Yun had reached Nanzheng, Wei Yan was dead. Ma Dai joined his army to Jiang Wei's, and Yang Yi wrote another memorial, which he sent to the Latter Ruler. The Latter Ruler issued an edict: “Wei Yan had paid the penalty of his crime; he should be honorably buried in consideration of his former services.” Then Yang Yi continued his journey and in due time arrived at Chengdu with the coffin of the late Prime Minister. The Latter Ruler led out a large cavalcade of officers to meet the body at a point seven miles from the walls, and he lifted up his voice and wailed for the dead, and with him wailed all the officers and the common people, so that the sound of mourning filled the whole earth. By royal command the body was borne into the city to the Palace of the Prime Minister, and his son Zhuge Zhan was chief mourner."
雲長自回荊州。魯肅與呂蒙共議：“此計又不成，如之奈何？”蒙曰：“可申報主公，起兵與雲長決戰。”肅卽時使人申報孫權。權聞之大怒，商議起傾國之兵，來取荊州。忽報：“曹操又起三十萬大軍來也！”權大驚，且敎魯肅休惹荊州之兵，移兵向合淝、濡須，以拒曹操。,"Yunchang has since returned to Jingzhou. Lu Su and Lu Meng discussed together: ""This plan is not possible, what can I do?"" Meng said: ""You can report to the lord, raise troops to fight Yun Chang decisively."" Su Su sent people to report Sun Quan. Quan was furious when he heard that, and he discussed raising the army of the country to take Jingzhou. He suddenly reported: ""Cao Cao has raised another 300,000 troops!"" Quan was shocked, and ordered Lu Suxiu to provoke the troops of Jingzhou, and moved his troops to Hefei and Ruxu to reject Cao Cao.","When Lu Su reports the failure of this plot to Sun Quan, he declares that he is determined now to go to war to seize Jingzhou. But then word comes that Cao Cao is preparing to attack with over three hundred thousand troops, and the plans for Jingzhou are put on hold while Wu prepares to face this new threat.","Guan Yu took his homeward way, while Lu Su and his two confederates talked over what had occurred. “What can be done now?” said Lu Su. “The only thing is to tell our master and let him send an army,” replied Lu Meng. Lu Su sent a messenger to Sun Quan, who, in his wrath, was for sending every available soldier at once against Jingzhou. But at this crisis there came news that Cao Cao was raising a huge army with the intention of attacking the South Land. So hasty orders were sent to Lu Su to make no move, but to send all the troops he could from Hefei and Ruxu toward the north to repel Cao Cao."
王朗聽罷，氣滿胸膛，大叫一聲，撞死於馬下。後人有詩讚孔明曰：,"When Wang Lang heard this, his chest filled with anger, he shouted, and crashed to death under the horse. Later generations have a poem to praise Kong Ming, saying:","This so shocks Wang Lang that he can barely breathe, and suddenly he cries aloud and drops dead from his horse.",Fierce wrath filled the old man's breast. With one despairing cry Wang Lang fell to the earth dead. This exploit of Zhuge Liang's has been lauded in verse:
魏主覽表，正在猶豫，楊阜、華歆亦上疏諫。魏主卽下詔，遣使詔曹眞、司馬懿還朝。,Lord Wei looked at the watch and was hesitating. Yang Fu and Hua Xin also gave advice. The Lord of Wei issued an edict and sent envoys to edict Cao Zhen and Sima Yi to return to the court.,"When an imperial command comes telling them to abandon the attempt and return home, everyone is delighted but also aware of the risks of a counter-attack by Shu.","The Ruler of Wei could not make up his mind, but two other memorials by Yang Fu and Hua Xin followed, and then he issued the command to return, which was sent to Cao Zhen and Sima Yi. Cao Zhen and Sima Yi had already discussed the abandonment of the expedition."
早有消息報入東吳。吳主皓大驚，急召丞相張悌、司徒何植、司空滕修，計議退兵之策。悌奏曰：“可令車騎將軍伍延為都督，進兵江陵，迎敵杜預；驃騎將軍孫歆進兵拒夏口等處軍馬。臣敢為軍師，領左將軍沈瑩、右將軍諸葛靚，引兵十萬，出屯牛渚，接應諸路軍馬。”皓從之，遂令張悌引兵去了。皓退入後宮，面有憂色。幸臣中常侍岑昏問其故。皓曰：“晉兵大至：諸路已有兵迎之；爭奈王濬率兵數萬，戰船齊備，順流而下，其鋒甚銳：朕因此憂也。”昏曰：“臣有一計，令王濬之舟，皆為齏粉矣。”皓大喜，遂問其計。岑昏奏曰：“江南多鐵，可打連環索百餘條，長數百丈，每環重二三十斤，於沿江緊要去處橫截之。再造鐵錐數萬，長丈餘，置於水中。若晉船乘風而來，逢錐則破，豈能渡江也？”皓大喜，傳令撥匠工於江邊連夜造成鐵索、鐵錐，設立停當。,"There has long been news reported to Soochow. Wu Zhuhao was shocked and urgently summoned Prime Minister Zhang Ti, Situ He Zhi, and Sikong Teng Xiu to discuss the strategy of retreating. Ti said: ""You can make Wu Yan, the general of the chariots and cavalry, as the governor, and march to Jiangling to meet the enemy Du Yu; the general of the hussars, Sun Xin, advance the army to reject the troops at Xiakou and other places. The minister dares to be the military adviser, and leads the left general Shen Ying and the right general Zhuge Liang. Lead in 100,000 troops, go out to Niuzhu, and meet all the troops and horses."" Hao followed and ordered Zhang Ti to lead the troops. Hao retreated into the harem with a worried look on his face. Among the fortunate ministers, Cen fainted and asked why. Hao said: ""The army of Jin has reached a large number: there are troops on all roads to meet them; Wang Jun of Zhengnai led tens of thousands of troops, the warships are fully prepared, and they are going down the river. Their fronts are very sharp: I am worried about this."" Huan said: ""My minister. There is a plan that will make Wang Jun's boat all rubbish."" Hao was overjoyed and asked about his plan. Cen Hun said: ""There is a lot of iron in the south of the Yangtze River, and it can be used to make more than 100 chain ropes, hundreds of zhang long, and each ring weighs 20 to 30 catties. It will be cut at the urgent place along the river. The iron cones are tens of thousands more long, and placed in In the water. If Jin boats come by the wind, they will be broken when they meet the cones, how can they cross the river?"" Hao was overjoyed, and ordered the craftsmen to make iron ropes and iron cones by the river overnight, and set up a stop.","Immediately he sends commanders and troops in many directions, each with a Wu city to attack – Du Yu against Jiangling; Sima Zhou against Tuzhong; Wang Hun against Hengjiang; Wang Rong against Wuchang; Hu Fen against Xiakou, while the navy is sent down the river to attack as well under the command of Admiral Wang Jun. In overall charge is Yang Ji – to be based at Xiangyang. When the news reaches Sun Hao, he is greatly alarmed and orders flow out of the palace to show resistance. But as he goes back to his private chambers, his favourite, the eunuch Cen Hun, can see he is troubled and asks what it is that so worries him. ‘Our armies can deal with the land invasion, but I’m really worried about the naval attack.’ ‘Well,’ says Cen Hun, ‘I know how we can deal with them.’ And he comes up with an astonishing plan. Iron is collected from across the land and cast into thousands of mighty chains and huge iron spikes. These are stretched across the river, and the spikes dropped into the river channel to break up the attack and sink the ships.","The Ruler of Wu was greatly alarmed at the news of such armies and fleets, and he called to him quickly his Prime Minister Zhang Ti, Minister of the Interior He Zhi, and Minister of Works Teng Xun, to consult how to defend his land. Zhang Ti proposed: “Send Commander of the Flying Cavalry Wu Yan to meet the enemy at Jiangling; Commander of the Flying Cavalry Sun Xin to Xiakou; I volunteer to take command of a camp at Niuzhu, together with the General of the Left Shen Rong and General of the Right Zhuge Xing, ready to lend help at any point.” The Ruler of Wu approved his dispositions and felt satisfied that he was safe by land. But in the privacy of his own apartment he felt miserable, for he realized that no preparations had been made against an attack by water under the Wei leader Wang Jun. Then the favorite eunuch Cen Hun asked the Emperor why he bore a sad countenance, and Sun Hao told him of his dread of the enemy navy. “The armies of Jin are coming, and I have deployed troops for general defense. Only the water front, by which Wang Jun and his several thousand battleships sail east along the tide, makes me feel so worried.” “But I have a scheme that will smash all Wang Jun's ships,” cried Cen Hun. “What is it?” asked the Ruler of Wu, pleased to hear this. “Iron is plentiful. Make great chains with heavy links and stretch them across the river at various points. Also forge many massive hammers and arrange them in the stream, so that when the enemy's ships sail down before the wind, they will collide with the hammers and be wrecked. Then they will sail no more.” Blacksmiths were soon at work on the river bank welding the links and forging the hammers."
靳詳回見孔明，具言郝昭如此光景。孔明大怒曰：“匹夫無禮太甚！豈欺吾無攻城之具耶？”隨叫土人問曰：“陳倉城中，有多少人馬？”土人告曰：“雖不知的數，約有三千人。”孔明笑曰：“量此小城，安能禦我！休等他救兵到，火速攻之！”於是軍中起百乘雲梯，一乘上可立十數人，周圍用木板遮護。軍士各把短梯輭索，聽軍中擂鼓，一齊上城。郝昭在敵樓上，望見蜀兵裝起雲梯，四面而來，卽令三千軍各執火箭，分布四面；待雲梯近城，一齊射之。孔明只道城中無備，故大造雲梯，令三軍鼓譟吶喊而進；不期城上火箭齊發，雲梯盡着，梯上軍士多被燒死。城上矢石如雨，蜀兵皆退。孔明大怒曰：“汝燒吾雲梯，吾却用‘衝車’之法！”於是連夜安排下衝車。次日，又四面鼓譟吶喊而進。郝昭急命運石鑿眼，用葛繩穿定飛打，衝車皆被打折。孔明又令人運土填城壕，敎廖化引三千鍬钁軍，從夜間掘地道，暗入城去。郝昭又於城中掘重壕橫截之。如此晝夜相攻，二十餘日，無計可破。孔明正在營中憂悶。忽報：“東邊救兵到了，旗上書：‘魏先鋒大將王雙’。”孔明問曰：“誰可迎之？”魏延出曰：“某願往。”孔明曰：“汝乃先鋒大將，未可輕出。”又問：“誰敢迎之？”裨將謝雄應聲而出。孔明與三千軍去了。孔明又問曰：“誰敢再去？”裨將龔起應聲要去。孔明亦與三千兵去了。孔明恐城內郝昭引兵衝出，乃把人馬退二十里下寨。,"Jin Xiang returned to see Kong Ming, stating that Hao Zhao was in such a situation. Kong Ming was furious and said, ""I'm so rude! How can you deceive me that I don't have the tools to attack the city?"" There are 3,000 people."" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""Measure this small town, and you can protect me! Don't wait for him to rescue the soldiers, and attack it quickly!"" Wooden cover. The sergeants each put up short ladders and ropes, listened to the drumming of the army, and went up to the city together. Hao Zhao was on the top of the enemy building and saw the soldiers of Shu who had installed cloud ladders and came from all sides. He ordered the three thousand troops to hold rockets and distribute them in four directions; Kongming only knew that the city was unprepared, so he built a large cloud ladder, which made the three armies shout and shout; unexpectedly, the rockets on the city were all fired, the cloud ladder was exhausted, and many sergeants on the ladder were burned to death. The arrows and stones on the city were like rain, and the soldiers of Shu all retreated. Kong Ming was furious and said, ""You burned my cloud ladder, but I used the method of 'rushing the chariot'!"" So he arranged to get off the chariot overnight. The next day, there was shouting and shouting from all sides. Hao Zhao was in a hurry to chisel holes in the Destiny Stone, and used ge rope to pierce through the fixed fly, and the rushing car was discounted. Kongming also ordered earth to fill the trenches, and ordered Liao Hua to lead an army of 3,000 shovels and cymbals to dig tunnels at night and enter the city secretly. Hao Zhao also dug a heavy trench in the city to cut through it. This day and night attacked each other for more than twenty days, and there was no way to break it. Kong Ming was feeling sad in the camp. He suddenly reported: ""The rescue troops from the east have arrived, and the flag reads: 'Wei Xianfeng General Wang Shuang'."" Kong Ming asked, ""Who can welcome him?"" Wei Yan said, ""Someone wants to go."" General, you can't come out lightly."" Then he asked, ""Who dares to welcome him?"" The general Xie Xiong responded. Kong Ming went with three thousand troops. Kong Ming asked again, ""Who dares to go again?"" Kong Ming also went with three thousand soldiers. Kongming feared that Hao Zhao would lead his troops out of the city, so he retreated his troops twenty li to the village.","His second attempt doesn’t even get him inside the city, and this time he has to flee as Hao Zhao takes aim from the city wall with a bow and arrow. Through the reports of his spies, Kong Ming discovers that there are probably only three thousand men in the city. He orders a hundred siege towers built, confident that he can swiftly seize this small city. But Hao Zhao is ready, and thousands of flaming arrows not only destroy the towers but there by burn to death most of the men inside as well. Next Kong Ming orders battering rams made and launches a mass attack, but, using huge rocks on ropes, Hao Zhao smashes them out of the way. Finally Kong Ming orders a tunnel dug under the walls, but Hao Zhao counter-digs a tunnel and slays the miners. Soon after, news comes of the Wei vanguard, commanded by the giant Wang Shuang, approaching, and Kong Ming sends troops to counter him.","I meant what I said at first, and I will say no more.” Again Jin Xiang returned and reported failure to Zhuge Liang. “The fool is very ill-mannered,” said Zhuge Liang. “Does he think he can beguile me into sparing the city?” He called up some of the local people and asked about the forces in the city. They told him about three thousand. “I do not think such a small place can beat me,” said Zhuge Liang. “Attack quickly before any reinforcements can arrive.” Thereupon the assailants brought up scaling ladders, upon the platforms of which ten or more men could stand. These were surrounded by planks as protection. The other soldiers had short ladders and ropes, and, at the beat of the drum, they attempted to scale the walls. But when Hao Zhao saw the ladders being brought up, he made his soldiers shoot fire-arrows at them. Zhuge Liang did not expect this. He knew the city was not well prepared for defense, and he had had the great ladders brought up and bade the soldiers take the wall with a rush. He was greatly chagrined when the fire arrows set his ladders on fire and so many of his soldiers were burned. And as the arrows and stones rained down from the wall, the soldiers of Shu were forced to retire. Zhuge Liang angrily said, “So you burn my ladders; then I will use battering rams.” So the rams were brought and placed against the walls and again the signal given for assault. But the defenders brought up great stones suspended by ropes, which they swung down at the battering rams and so broke them to pieces. Next the besiegers set to work to bring up earth and fill the moat, and Liao Hua led three thousand soldiers to excavate a tunnel under the ramparts. But Hao Zhao cut a counter-trench within the city and turned that device. So the struggle went on for near a month, and still the city was not taken. Zhuge Liang was very depressed. That was not all. The scouts reported the coming of a relief force of Wei, the flags of which bore the name of Wang Shuang. Some one had to try to turn him back, and Wei Yan offered himself. “No,” said Zhuge Liang, “you are too valuable as Leader of the Van.” General Xie Xiong offered his services; they were accepted, and Xie Xiong was given three thousand troops. After he had gone, Zhuge Liang decided to send a second force, and for command of this General Gong Qi volunteered and was accepted. Gong Qi also had three thousand troops. Then Zhuge Liang feared lest there would be a sortie from the city to aid the relief force just arriving, so he led off the army seven miles and made a camp."

Yang Feng sent Meng Huo, Meng You, Duo Si and others to Kongming Village. Kong Ming ordered to enter. Yang Feng and others bowed under the tent and said, ""A certain class of sons and daughters are all grateful for the kindness of the Prime Minister, so they captured Meng Huo, Meng You and others to present them."" Kong Ming laughed and said, ""Are you convinced now?"" Huo said, ""It's not your ability, but the people in my cave, who are killing each other, and that's why. If you want to kill, you will kill, but you won't accept it!"" Kong Ming said: ""You earn When I enter a land without water, the Dumb Spring, the Dead Spring, the Black Spring, and the Soft Spring are so poisonous that my army is safe, isn’t it God’s will? Why are you so obsessed?” Huo added, “My ancestor lived in Yinkeng Mountain, and there were The dangers of the three rivers are very strong. If you capture him, I will serve you as a descendant."" Kong Ming said: ""I will let you go back again, rearrange the troops and horses, and decide the outcome together with me; just like that time. If you capture it, if you don’t accept it, you will destroy the nine clans.” He swayed to the left and right of his shackles and released Meng Huo. Blessed again. Kong Ming also released Meng You and King Duo Si from their bondage, and gave them food and wine to suppress the shock. The two were frightened and did not dare to face it. Kong Ming ordered the pommel horse to be returned. Exactly:","With their leaders captured, the tribes scatter back to their homelands, while Yang Feng brings the three captured leaders to Kong Ming. He is richly rewarded. So once again Kong Ming greets Meng Huo, smiling. ‘Will you submit now?’ he asks. ‘Why?’ replies the still defiant Meng Huo. ‘You didn’t do this. It was betrayal by my own people. Kill me if you want, but I’ll not submit!’ ‘It was the Will of Heaven that my troops have not been affected by the poisonous springs. So given that, how much longer will you persist in this stupidity?’ asks Kong Ming. ‘Beyond here, in the valley of the Silver Pit hills, my ancestors lived.","Leaving Meng Huo, Meng You, and Duo Si in the hands of Yang Feng, the Mang warriors dispersed, each man returning to his own valley. Yang Feng then took the prisoners to the camp of Shu, where he bowed at the tent door, saying, “I and my sons and the sons of my brother are grateful to you for much kindness, wherefore we bring to you as an offering the persons of these rebels.” Zhuge Liang rewarded Yang Feng and bade them bring forward Meng Huo. “This time are you prepared to yield?” said the Prime Minister. “It is not your ability, but the treachery of my own people that has brought me to this. If you wish to slay, slay; but I will not yield.” “You know you were the cause of my army entering into a waterless land, where there were those four evil streams, and yet my soldiers were not poisoned and came to no harm. Does it not seem to you like evidence of a superior protecting power? Why will you follow this misguided road and always be obstinate?” Meng Huo replied, “My fathers have long held the Silver Pit Hills, and the three rivers and the two forests are their ramparts. If you can take that stronghold, then will I and my heirs for ever acknowledge your power and yield.” “I am going to liberate you once more,” said Zhuge Liang, “ and you may put your army in order if you will and fight a decisive battle. But after that, if you are my prisoner and are still refractory and unsubmissive, I shall have to exterminate your whole family.” Zhuge Liang ordered the lictors to loose the prisoner's bonds and let him go. After he had gone, the other two, Meng You and Duo Si, were led in and they also received their liberty. They were given wine and food. but they were confused and could not look Zhuge Liang in the face. They were given horses to travel on."

Cao Cao ordered Xu Huang to be the vanguard and come to the decisive battle. A person in front of the tent came out and said, ""A certain person knows the geography well, and would like to help General Xu to break down Shu with him."" According to him, he was a native of Dangqu in Basi: surnamed Wang, given name Ping, styled Zijun; see General Chongyamen. Cao was overjoyed and ordered Wang Ping to be the deputy pioneer to help Xu Huang. Cao stationed troops in the north of Dingjun Mountain. Xu Huang and Wang Ping led the army to the Han River, and Huang ordered the former army to cross the water and form an array. Ping said: ""If the army is crossing the water, if it has to retreat quickly, how can it be done?"" Huang said: ""In the past, Han Xin was in formation with his back to the water. The enemy used this tactic without a plan. Can the general today know what Zhao Yun and Huang Zhong meant?""

Command has been shared between Xu Huang and an unexpected secondary commander, Wang Ping, a local man with local knowledge. Advancing to the banks of the river, Xu Huang prepares to cross. But Wang Ping strongly recommends that he doesn’t, because how would he get back if disaster struck? But Xu Huang is not interested in this and, quoting historical precedent, he builds a bridge and crosses over. So what happens next?","Soon it was reported: “Cao Cao is coming again down through the Xie Valley to try to capture River Han.” But Liu Bei laughed, saying, “He will not succeed, for I think that we shall gain command of the river.” Then Liu Bei led his army west of the river to oppose Cao Cao. When Cao Cao drew near, he sent out Xu Huang to lead the van and open the battle. A General named Wang Ping said, “I know the country well, and I wish to help General Xu Huang to destroy the army of Shu.” Wang Ping was sent as second in command. Cao Cao camped on the north of Dingjun Mountain, and his advanced guard marched away making for River Han. And when they reached the bank, Xu Huang gave orders to cross to the other side. “To cross the river is well,” said Wang Ping, “but what if you have to retreat?” “Of old, when Han Xin made his array with a river in his rear, he said that out of the place of death one could return to life.” “You are mistaken now. The cases are not the same, for then Han Xin knew his opponents were unskillful. Have you reckoned upon the skill of our opponents, Zhao Yun and Huang Zhong?” “You may lead the footmen to hold the enemy while I destroy them with the horsemen,” said Xu Huang. Then bridges were built and the army crossed. A man of Wei blindly quoted Han Xin,"
却說曹爽嘗與何晏、鄧颺等畋獵。其弟曹羲諫曰：“兄威權太甚，而好出外游獵，倘為人所算，悔之無及。”爽叱曰：“兵權在吾手中，何懼之有？”司農桓範亦諫，不聽。時魏主曹芳，改正始十年為嘉平元年。曹爽一向專權，不知仲達虛實。適魏主除李勝為荊州刺史，卽令李勝往辭仲達，就探消息。勝逕到太傅府中，早有門吏報入。司馬懿謂二子曰：“此乃曹爽使來探吾病之虛實也。”乃去冠散髮，上牀擁被而坐；又令二婢扶策，方請李勝入府。勝至牀前拜曰：“一向不見太傅，誰想如此病重。今天子命某為荊州刺史，特來拜辭。”懿佯答曰：“并州近朔方，好為之備。”勝曰：“除荊州刺史：非并州也。”懿笑曰：“你方從并州來？”勝曰：“漢上荊州耳。”懿大笑曰：“你從荊州來也！”勝曰：“太傅如何病得這等了？”左右曰：“太傅耳聾。”勝曰：“乞紙筆一用。”左右取紙筆與勝。勝寫畢，呈上。懿看之，笑曰：“吾病的耳聾了。此去保重。”言訖，以手指口。侍婢進湯，懿將口就之，湯流滿襟，乃作哽噎之聲曰：“吾今衰老病篤，死在旦夕矣。二子不肖，望君敎之。君若見大將軍，千萬看覷二子！”言訖，倒在牀上，聲嘶氣喘。李勝拜辭仲達，回見曹爽，細言其事。爽大喜曰：“此老若死，吾無憂矣！”,"But he said that Cao Shuang tasted hunting with He Yan, Deng Yang and others. His younger brother Cao Xijian said: ""Brother is too powerful, and he likes to go out hunting. If it is calculated by others, there is no time to regret it."" Shuangxiao said: ""The military power is in my hands, why should I be afraid?"" Also admonish, do not listen. At that time, the head of Wei Cao Fang, the first ten years of the correction was the first year of Jiaping. Cao Shuang has always been authoritarian, ignorant of the truth of Zhongda. The Lord of Wei decided to remove Li Sheng as the prefect of Jingzhou, and ordered Li Sheng to resign from Zhongda to investigate the news. Shengjing went to the Taifu's mansion, and a doorman had already reported to him. Sima Yi said to the two sons, ""This is the fact that Cao Shuang has sent me to investigate the truth of my illness."" Sheng went to the bed and said: ""I have never seen Taifu, who would have thought that he would be so seriously ill. Today, my son has appointed a certain governor of Jingzhou, and I came here to pay my respects."" ""Except for the governor of Jingzhou: it is not Bingzhou."" Yi smiled and said, ""You are from Bingzhou?"" Sheng said: ""Jingzhou's ear in Han Dynasty."" Yi laughed and said, ""You are from Jingzhou!"" Sheng said: "" How can Taifu become so ill?"" Left and right said, ""Taifu is deaf."" Sheng said, ""I want to use a pen and paper."" The left and right took the pen and paper with Sheng. Win the writing and present it. Yi looked at it, smiled and said, ""I'm deaf. I'll take care of myself now."" After saying this, he pointed his finger. When the maid entered the soup, Yi Jiang's mouth was filled with the soup. The soup was full, and he said with a choked voice: ""I am old and sick, and I will die at the end of the day. The two sons are unworthy, and I hope you will teach them. Look at the second son!"" After saying this, he fell on the bed, hoarse and panting. Li Sheng said goodbye to Zhong Da, returned to see Cao Shuang, and talked about the matter in detail. Shuang was overjoyed and said, ""If this old man dies, I will have no worries!""","As soon as Li Sheng has gone, Sima Yi rises from his bed, calls his sons to him and says, ‘When Li Sheng reports back, Cao Shuang will no longer worry about me.","Cao Shuang and his five friends were devoted to hunting and were often out of the city. Cao Xi, a brother of Cao Shuang, remonstrated with him about this and pointed out the dangers of such frequent absence on these excursions. “You are in an exalted position and yet you are constantly being out hunting. If anyone took advantage of this to work you evil, you might have to be exceedingly regretful.” Cao Shuang only showed anger and replied, “The whole military authority is in my hands and what is there to fear?” Huan Fan, Minister of Agriculture, also reasoned with him, but Cao Shuang would not listen. About this time the style of the reign was changed from Right Beginning, the tenth year, to Domestic Calm, the first year (AD 249). Now ever since Cao Shuang had enjoyed the monopoly of military authority, he had never heard the truth about the state of health of the man he had maneuvered out of power. But when the Ruler of Wei appointed Li Sheng to the governorship of Qingzhou, Cao Shuang bade Li Sheng go to take leave of Sima Yi, at the same time to find out the true state of his health. So Li Sheng proceeded to the residence of the High Minister and was announced. Sima Yi saw through the device at once and told his sons, saying, “This is Cao Shuang's wish to find out my real condition.” And he bade them play their parts in the scene he arranged, before the visitor was admitted. Sima Yi threw aside his head-dress, so letting his hair fall in disorder, stretched himself upon his couch, tumbled the bed ding into confusion, got a couple of servant girls to support him, and then told his servants to lead in the visitor. Li Sheng came in and went up to the sick man, saying, “It is a long time since I have seen you, and I did not know you were so seriously ill. His Majesty is sending me to Qingzhou, and I have come to pay my respects to you and bid you farewell.” “Ah; Bingzhou is in the north; you will have to be very careful there,” said Sima Yi feigning that he had not heard. “I am going as Governor of Qingzhou, not Bingzhou,” said Li Sheng. “Oh, you have just come from Bingzhou.” “Qingzhou, in Huashang Mountains.” “Just back from Qingzhou, eh?” said Sima Yi, smiling. “How very ill the Imperial Guardian is!” said Li Sheng to the servants. “The Minister is deaf,” said they. “Give me paper and a pen,” said Li Sheng. Writing materials were brought, when Li Sheng wrote what he wished to say and put it before his host. “My illness has made me very deaf; take care of yourself on the way,” said Sima Yi. Looking up, he pointed to his mouth. One of the girls brought some broth and held the cup for him to drink. He put his lips to the cup, but spilled the broth all over his dress. “I am very weak and ill,” said he, “and may die at any moment. My sons are but poor things, but you will instruct them; and when you see the Regent Marshal, you will ask him to take care of them for me, will you not?” At this point Sima Yi fell back on the couch, panting, and Li Sheng took his leave. He told Cao Shuang what he had seen, and Cao Shuang rejoiced, thinking his rival could not last long. “If the old man died, I should not be the one to grieve,” said Cao Shuang."

Fly off the horse to join the army division. Kong Ming was startled and asked, ""How can I get there first?"" Kong Ming congratulated him and said: ""General Zhang can use his strategies, and they are all the masters of Hongfu."" Zhao Yun explained that Wu Yi had seen Xuande. Xuande said, ""Are you coming down?"" Wu Yi said, ""I was caught, so why didn't I come down?"" Xuande was overjoyed and released him personally. Kong Ming asked: ""How many people are in the city guarding the city?"" Wu Yi said: ""There is Liu Xun, the son of Liu Jiyu, and the assistants Liu Wei and Zhang Ren. Liu Wei is not serious; Zhang Ren is a native of Shu County. He said, ""First arrest Zhang Ren, then take Luocheng."" He asked, ""What is the name of this bridge in the east of the city?"" Wu Yi said, ""Jinyan Bridge."" Kong Ming then rode his horse to the bridge, looked around the river, and returned When they got to the village, they called Huang Zhong and Wei Yan to listen to the order and said, ""Five or six miles south of Jinyan Bridge, there are reeds and scorpions on both sides, so you can ambush. Wei Yan leads a thousand gunmen to the left, and just stabs the generals immediately; Huang Zhong leads a thousand gunmen. The swordsman is on the right, and he only cuts down and sits down on his horse. To kill and disperse the other army, Zhang Ren will turn to the Shandong road and come. Zhang Yide will lead a thousand troops to lie there, and he will be captured there."" He also called Zhao Yun to the north of the Jinyan Bridge: ""When I lead Zhang Ren to cross the bridge, you will dismantle the bridge, but you will force your troops to the north of the bridge, so that Zhang Ren dare not look north to go, and retreat to the south, but it is a good plan."" The dispatch has been decided. , the military advisers go to lure the enemy.","But not long after Yan Yan arrives with the bulk of the army, and, seeing this, Zhang Ren turns and flees, with Zhang Fei in hot pursuit right up to the city wall.","Zhang Fei dismounted and went in to greet him. Zhuge Liang was surprised, and said, “How comes it that you arrived before me?” Liu Bei told the story of Zhang Fei's prudence and sagacity in dealing with Yan Yan. Zhuge Liang congratulated Zhang Fei and said, “When Zhang Fei behaves with such skill, my lord's good fortune is indeed ample.” When the prisoner was taken in, Liu Bei asked him if he would surrender. Wu Yi replied, “Why not, seeing I am a prisoner?” Thereupon Liu Bei himself loosed his bonds. Zhuge Liang began to question him upon the defense. Wu Yi told him the names of the officers, saying, “The son of the Imperial Protector, Liu Xun, and his generals Liu Gui and Zhang Ren are the defenders. Liu Gui does not count for much, but Zhang Ren is a man to be avoided.” “Then before we can get the city we must capture Zhang Ren,” said Zhuge Liang. “There is a bridge on the east; what is it called?” “It is known as the 'Bridge of the Golden Goose.'“ Zhuge Liang rode over to the bridge and scrutinized the neighborhood. After his return to camp, he summoned Huang Zhong and Wei Yan for orders. To them he said, “On the east of the city is a bridge called the Bridge of the Golden Goose, and about two miles south of this I saw a dense growth of reed and sedge which would afford excellent shelter. Wei Yan is to lead a thousand spearmen to the left and attack, but only attack horsemen. Huang Zhong will lead a thousand swordsmen who are to cut the horses. When Zhang Ren has lost most of his troops and horses, he will flee by the hill road, where he will fall into an ambush of Zhang Fei.” Next Zhao Yun was called and sent to lie in ambush close to the bridge, which he was to destroy as soon as the enemy had crossed. That done, Zhao Yun was to take up a position beyond the bridge to prevent the enemy from getting away to the north. Forced to the south, their destruction would be inevitable. These arrangements made, Zhuge Liang himself went to challenge the enemy and try to bring them to battle."

Zhao obeyed and urged the army to attack. Quan Yi led his troops into Shouchun, and seeing the strength of Wei's troops, he thought that there was no way to advance or retreat, so he surrendered to Sima Zhao. Zhao Jiayi was a general, and he was grateful for Zhao's kindness, so he repaired his family book with his father Quan Duan and his uncle Quan Yi, saying that Sun Chen was not benevolent. Yi got Yishu, and he and Duan led thousands of people to open the door and go out. Zhuge Dan was sad in the city. The advisors Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi said: ""There are few food in the city and there are many soldiers, so I can't defend it for a long time, so I can lead the Wu and Chu troops to fight to the death with the Wei soldiers."" Tang was furious and said: ""I want to defend, you want to fight, is there any other way? What a different heart! If you talk again, you will be executed!"" The two of them looked up to the sky and sighed: ""The birthday is about to die! I might as well come down early to avoid death!"" At the second watch of the night, Jiang and Jiao crossed the city and surrendered to Wei, Sima. Zhao relied on it - so although there were people who dared to fight in the city, they did not dare to fight.","However, the presence of Sun Chen does little to help. He orders attacks which are futile and loses the Wu good men. Humiliated and furious, he then executes the commander whom he has made undertake these perilous missions, throwing all the blame upon the unfortunate man. In the end his oppressive rule leads one of the commanders, Quan Yi, to desert and join the Wei forces. Quan Yi also gets news through to his uncle in Shouchun, who also deserts and leads his men out of the city to join the Wei army. Seeing what is inevitable, Sun Chen deserts the army and its inevitable defeat and hurries back to Wu. Inside Shouchun the fraught situation does little to improve Zhuge Dan’s temper, and any suggestion of a different military strategy draws nothing but contempt from him. By this he alienates his own commanders, who begin to desert. Starvation begins to bite, and the defenders become seriously weak. Any complaints are dealt with severely. Zhuge Dan himself roams the streets, striking down any who complain. Such harshness only leads of course to more desertions. The end is inevitable. The city is stormed, and though Zhuge Dan tries to escape he is trapped and slain. His whole family are then killed, while his faithful soldiers refuse to bend the knee to Sima Zhao, and all of them – over three hundred – are executed.","When this was known in the Wei camp, Zhong Hui said to his chief, “Now the city of Shouchun may be attacked, for Sun Chen has gone away, and there is no hope of succor for the besieged.” A vigorous assault began. Quan I tried to cut his way through and get into the city; but when he saw Shouchun quite surrounded by the enemy and no hope of success, he gave in and went over to Sima Zhao, by whom he was well received and given the rank of General. Deeply affected by this kindness, Quan I wrote to his father, Quan Duan, and uncle, Quan Yi, advising them to follow his example. He tied the letter to an arrow and shot it over the walls. Quan Yi found the letter, and he and Quan Duan, with their several thousand troops, came out and yielded. Within the city Zhuge Dan was very sad. Two advisers, Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi, came to him and said, “The food in the city is short, and the soldiers are many; this can not last long. General, you should let the Wu troops to go out and make a decisive fight with the Wei army.” Zhuge Dan turned on them angrily. “Why do you tell me to fight when I am set on holding out to the very last? If you say that again, you shall die as traitors.” “He is lost,” said they, going away. “We can do no other than surrender or we shall die too.” That night Jiang Ban and Jiao Yi slipped over the wall and surrendered. Both were given employment. Of those left in the city some were for fighting, but no one dared say so."

Yi said: ""Shu has not been attacked: today the road is flaming, and the Shu soldiers will not leave. If our army goes deep into the area, they will guard their dangerous points and will be in a hurry."" Rui said: ""If the Shu soldiers come to invade again, What can I do?"" Yi said, ""This minister has decided that Zhuge Liang will follow Han Xin's plan to save Chencang in secret. The minister will raise one person to the entrance of Chencang Road, build a city and defend it, and nothing will go wrong: this person is nine feet long, good at shooting with his arms, and has a deep strategy. Zhuge Liang joined the bandits, and this person can be a good candidate."" Rui was overjoyed and asked, ""Who is this person?"" Yi Zuo said, ""He is from Taiyuan: his surname is Hao, his name is well-known, his style is Bodao, and he is now a general of Zaba, guarding Hexi. .""","This is reported to Sima Yi and Cao Rui, who start to discuss again plans for a possible attack on Shu.","The Ruler of Wei called Sima Yi to council and asked how Shu might be annexed. “Shu cannot be attacked,” was the reply. “In this present hot weather they will not come out, but, if we invade, they will only garrison and defend their strategic points, which we should find it hard to overcome.” “What shall we do if they invade us again?” “I have prepared for that. Just now Zhuge Liang is imitating Han Xin when he secretly crossed the river into Chencang. I can recommend a man to guard the place by building a rampart there and rendering it absolutely secure. He is a nine-span man, round shouldered and powerful, a good archer and prudent strategist.

I think there is enough to ambush in the wheat fields in the east and west of Lucheng; who would dare to go for me?"" Jiang Wei, Wei Yan, Ma Zhong, and Ma Dai came out and said, ""Someone is willing to go."" Kongming was overjoyed, and ordered Jiang Wei and Wei Yan to lead 2,000 soldiers each to the southeast and northwest; Ma Dai and Ma Zhong each led Two thousand soldiers, lying in the southwest and northeast two places: ""Only hearing the sound of the scorpion, the four corners will kill together."" The four generals accepted the plan and led their troops to go. Kongming himself led more than a hundred people, each of them took a fire and went out of the city, and waited in the wheat field.","But once again Kong Ming has foreseen this, and through ambush and vigorous defence of the city walls the Wei army are trapped between two forces of the Shu army and heavily defeated.","Let me attack the rear, while you lead against the front, and we shall take the city and Zhuge Liang too.” An attack was decided upon. In Lucheng, while the soldiers were still busy with the wheat, Zhuge Liang called up his generals, and said, “The enemy will attack tonight. There is a suitable place for an ambush in the newly reaped fields, but who will lead for me?” Four generals—Jiang Wei, Wei Yan, Ma Dai, and Ma Zhong—offered themselves, and he posted them, each with two thousand troops, outside the four corners of the city. They were to await the signal and then converge. When these had gone, Zhuge Liang led out a small party of one hundred soldiers and hid in the newly reaped fields."

Leng Bao returned to the horse and fought with Huang Zhong again. After less than ten rounds, the army and horses behind him came up, and Leng Bao had to abandon the Zuo Zhai and lead the defeated army to the Right Zhai. I saw that the flags in the village were completely different, and Leng Bao was shocked. When he was watching the horse, the leading general, with a golden robe, was Liu Xuande - Liu Feng on the left, Guan Ping on the right - shouted, ""I have captured the stockade, where do you want to go?"" It turned out that Xuande led the troops from After responding, he took advantage of the situation to seize Dengxian Village. Lengbao had no way to go at both ends, so he took a remote path in the mountains and wanted to return to Luocheng. After walking less than ten miles, the soldiers in ambush on the narrow road suddenly raised their hooks and caught Leng Bao alive. It turned out that it was Wei Yan who knew the criminal and had no explanation. He packed up the rear army and ordered the soldiers of Shu to lead the way. He tied Leng Bao with a rope and threw him to Xuande Village.","The foolish Wei Yan is about to be killed by Deng Xian himself when an arrow takes Deng Xian down, and the cry goes up, ‘Old man Huang Zhong has come.’ Riding into the fray, the old warrior attacks Ling Bao, who flees. Deng Xian is finished off, and the men of Shu are scattered. When Ling Bao rushes for sanctuary into the other Shu camp, that of the now dead Deng Xian, it is to find it occupied by none other than Xuande! Ling Bao retreats rapidly and, taking only country paths, he believes he can make it safely back to Luocheng. But this is not to be. Wei Yan, realizing the trouble he is in because of his arrogance, has worked out where to place an ambush, and it is he who captures Ling Bao. Standing before the troops who have surrendered, Xuande says, ‘Men of Shu.","So Huang Zhong was able to rescue his colleague Wei Yan. Huang Zhong had thus slain Deng Xian and forced his way up to the gate of the camp. Once again Ling Bao came and engaged Huang Zhong. The two had fought some ten bouts when appeared another body of soldiers. Thereupon Ling Bao fled again, and this time he made for the other camp, abandoning his own to the troops of Jingzhou. But when he drew near his camp, he saw no longer the familiar flags of his own side. Instead, alien banners fluttered in the breeze. He checked his steed and stared at the new force. The leader was a general wearing a silver breastplate and clad in a silken robe, no other than Liu Bei himself. On his left was his son and on his right rode his nephew. “Whither would you come?” cried Liu Bei. “The camp is ours; I have captured it.” Now Liu Bei had led his troops in the track of the other two armies ready to help either in case of need. He had come across the empty and undefended camp and taken possession. Left with no place of refuge, Ling Bao set off along a byway to try to get back to Luocheng. He had not gone far when he fell into an ambush and was taken prisoner. Bound with cords he was taken to the camp of Liu Bei. The ambush had been prepared by Wei Yan, who, knowing he had committed a fault that could in no wise be explained away, had collected as many of his soldiers as he could find and made some of the captured soldiers of Yiazhou guide him to a spot suitable for laying an ambush. Liu Bei had hoisted the flag of amnesty for his enemies, and whenever any soldier of the Western Land of Rivers laid down his weapons and stripped off his armor he was spared."

His heart alarmed him, and presently he reined in his steed and asked if any knew the name of that place. One of the soldiers of Yiazhou who had joined his army said, “This is called 'The Fallen Phoenix Slope.'“ Pang Tong shuddered. “An evil omen for me, since Blooming-Phoenix is my Taoist name. There is no luck for me here.” He decided to retire. But as he gave the order, the roar of a bomb rent the air and arrows began to fly toward him thick as swarming locusts. All the hidden men were shooting at the rider of the white horse. And there, wounded by many arrows, poor Pang Tong died at the age of thirty-six. A poem says:"

却說馬超自兵敗入羌，二載有餘，結好羌兵，攻取隴西州郡。所到之處，盡皆歸降；惟冀州攻打不下。刺史韋康，累遣人求救於夏侯淵。淵不得曹操言語，未敢動兵。韋康見救兵不來，與衆商議：“不如投降馬超。”參軍楊阜哭諫曰：“超等叛君之徒，豈可降之？”康曰：“事勢至此，不降何待？”阜苦諫不從。韋康大開城門，投拜馬超。超大怒曰：“汝今事急請降，非眞心也！”將韋康等四十餘口盡斬之，不留一人。有人言：“楊阜勸韋康休降，可斬之。”超曰：“此人守義，不可斬也。”復用楊阜為參軍。阜薦梁寬、趙衢二人，超盡用為軍官。楊阜告馬超曰：阜妻死於臨洮，乞告兩個月假，歸葬其妻，便回，馬超從之。,"But he said that Ma Chao had been defeated by his troops and entered the Qiang. After two years, he formed a good army of Qiang and attacked Longxi Prefecture. Wherever they went, they all surrendered; but Jizhou could not be attacked. Inspector Wei Kang, tired to send people to Xiahou Yuan for help. Yuan could not speak Cao Cao's words, and did not dare to move his troops. When Wei Kang saw that the rescuer was not coming, he discussed with the crowd: ""It's better to surrender Ma Chao."" Yang Fu, who joined the army, cried and remonstrated, ""How can you surrender the super-class traitor?"" Kang said, ""The situation is now, so why not surrender? ""Fu Kui refused to obey. Wellcome opened the city gates and voted for Ma Chao. Chao Chao said angrily, ""You are in a hurry to surrender now, and you are not serious!"" He cut off Wei Kang and others forty, leaving no one behind. Someone said: ""Yang Fu persuaded Wei Kang to surrender, and he could be executed."" Chao said: ""This person is righteous and cannot be executed."" He reused Yang Fu to join the army. Fu recommended Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu, both of whom were used as officers. Yang Fu told Ma Chao, ""Fu's wife died in Lintao, and he begged for a two-month leave to bury his wife, so he returned, and Ma Chao followed.","As he consults with his father, a letter arrives from Fa Zheng, who has suggested to Xuande that he try to persuade Liu Zhang to submit.","Two years had elapsed since Ma Chao had been defeated and gone over to the Qiang tribes in the northwest. He had made friends with them and with their aid had conquered portions of Longxi. His expeditions had been very successful, the people opening their gates at the first summons. Only Jicheng had stood out, but ever this was on the point of yielding. The Governor of Jicheng, Wei Kang, had sent many urgent appeals for help to Xiahou Yuan, who, however, would do nothing without his master's order. Wei Kang was in despair, and at a council his officers advised him to yield. However, one of them, Yang Fu, earnestly opposed yielding, saying, “We cannot surrender to a lot of rebels such as are Ma Chao and his colleagues.” “What is there to hope for?” asked Wei Kang despairingly. Although Yang Fu besought Wei Kang with bitterness to hold out, it was useless; Wei Kang rejected his advice, opened the city gates, and bowed his head in submission. “You only yield now as the last resource,” cried Ma Chao, angry at the delay he had suffered. “This is no real submission.” Whereupon he put to death Wei Kang and all his family to the number of two score. But when one told Ma Chao that Yang Fu had been really responsible for the long delay, in that Yang Fu had urged his master to hold out, Ma Chao did not put him to death but praised him and said, “Yang Fu had but done his duty.” Ma Chao further showed his approval by employing Yang Fu and two of his friends in his own army. These two friends were named Liang Kuan and Zhao Qu. One day Yang Fu went to his new chief and said, “My wife has died in Lintao; I wish to take leave for two months to bury her.”"
却說王含、蔣斌因立寨未定，恐魏兵來劫寨，不散解甲而寢。忽聞中軍大亂，急綽兵器上的馬時，寨外鄧忠引兵殺到。內外夾攻，王、蔣二將，奮死抵敵不住，棄寨而走。姜維在帳中聽得左寨中大喊，料道有內應外合之兵，遂急上馬，立於中軍帳前，傳令曰：“如有妄動者斬！便有敵兵到營邊，休要問他，只管以弓弩射之！”一面傳示右營，亦不許妄動。果然魏兵十餘次衝擊，皆被射回。只衝殺到天明，魏兵不敢殺入。鄧艾收兵回寨，乃歎曰：“姜維深得孔明之法！兵在夜而不驚，將聞變而不亂：眞將才也！”次日，王含、蔣斌收聚敗兵，伏於大寨前請罪。維曰：“非汝等之罪，乃吾不明地脈之故也。”又撥軍馬，命二將安營訖。却將傷死身屍，填於地道之中，以土掩之。令人下戰書單搦鄧艾來日交鋒。艾忻然應之。,"But they said that Wang Han and Jiang Bin had not decided to establish the fortress, and they were afraid that Wei soldiers would come to rob the fortress and go to bed without disbanding their armour. Suddenly hearing the chaos of the Chinese army, when the horses on the weapons were anxious, Deng Zhong outside the village led his troops to kill. Attacking from inside and outside, the two generals, Wang and Jiang, fought to the death and could not resist the enemy, so they abandoned the fortress and left. In the tent, Jiang Wei heard the shouting from the Zuozhai. He expected that there would be troops who should cooperate with the outside and inside, so he hurriedly mounted his horse and stood in front of the central army tent. On the side, if you want to ask him, just shoot him with a bow and crossbow!"" As he told the right camp, he was not allowed to move rashly. Sure enough, the Wei soldiers were shot back more than ten times. Only rushing to Tianming, the Wei soldiers did not dare to enter. Deng Ai withdrew his troops and returned to the village, but sighed and said, ""Jiang Wei has mastered the method of Confucius! The soldiers will not be alarmed at night, and will not be disturbed when they hear about the changes: the true generals are talented!"" The next day, Wang Han and Jiang Bin gathered the defeated soldiers and surrendered plead guilty in front of Dazhai. Wei said, ""It's not your fault, it's because I don't know the geology."" But the wounded and dead were filled in the tunnel and covered with soil. It was ordered to fight against Deng Ai in Japan. Ai Xinran responded.","He is expecting this and has left the plains for Jiang Wei to occupy, but has dug a long tunnel under the area where the enemy camp is set. It is a good plan – it means there could be an attack from above and below ground. However, despite all his plans and preparations, a major night attack from above and below ground fails to overwhelm the Shu army, and Deng Ai has to admit defeat. A major battle the next day sees Deng Ai driven back by the triumphant Shu.","So when the alarm was given, they had but to seize their weapons and go out. But as the two leaders were mounting their steeds, Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan had attacked from without, and Zheng Lun from within. Thus attacked from three sides, soon Wang Han and Jiang Bin found the position untenable and fled. When Jiang Wei saw that his left camp had been attacked on three sides, he mounted and took his position in front of the center camp. “Let no one move on pain of death!” he shouted. “Stand still, and when the enemy approaches shoot.” The right camp was ordered to stand fast. His defense was effective. A dozen of times the troops of Wei came forward, only to be driven back before the arrows and bolts of the defenders. Daylight found the Shu camps still firm, and the Wei troops drew off. “Jiang Wei has indeed learned of Zhuge Liang,” said Deng Ai. “His soldiers stood the night attack without flinching, and the leaders took the chances of battle quite calmly. He is able.” Next day, when Wang Han and Jiang Bin went to confess their fault, Jiang Wei said, “It was less your fault than mine, for I did not clearly recognize the nature of the terrain.” So no penalty was inflicted. The camp was made stronger, and the subterranean passage was filled with the bodies of the slain. A challenge to battle for the following day was sent to Deng Ai, who accepted it joyfully."
叡覽訖，乃謂多官曰：“司馬懿堅守不出，今何故又上表求戰？”衞尉辛毗曰：“司馬懿本無戰心，必因諸葛亮恥辱，衆將忿怒之故，特上此表，欲更乞明旨，以遏諸將之心耳。”叡然其言，卽令辛毗持節至渭北寨傳諭，令勿出戰。司馬懿接詔入帳，辛毗宣諭曰：“如再有敢言出戰者，卽以違旨論。”衆將只得奉詔。懿暗謂辛毗曰：“公眞知我心也。”於是令軍中傳說：魏主命辛毗持節，傳諭司馬懿勿得出戰。蜀將聞知此事，報與孔明。孔明笑曰：“此乃司馬懿安三軍之法也。”姜維曰：“丞相何以知之？”孔明曰：“彼本無戰心；所以請戰者，以示武於衆耳。豈不聞：‘將在外，君命有所不受。’安有千里而請戰者乎？此乃司馬懿因將士忿怒，故借曹叡之主，以制衆人。今又播傳此言，欲懈我軍心也。”,"When Rui Lan arrived, he called the officials and said, ""Sima Yi can't stand strong, so why is he going to the table to ask for war now?"" The guard Xin Pi said, ""Sima Yi has no heart to fight, but because of Zhuge Liang's humiliation and the anger of the generals, he will be particularly angry. On this list, I want to beg for a clearer decree, so as to restrain the hearts and ears of the generals."" Rui said, and ordered Xin Pi to hold a festival to Weibei Village to pass the order, ordering not to go out to battle. Sima Yi accepted the edict and entered the tent, and Xin Pi declared: ""If there are any more people who dare to speak out and go to war, they will be regarded as violating the edict."" The generals had to obey the edict. Yi secretly told Xin Pi to say, ""Your Majesty knows my heart."" So there was a legend in the army: The Lord of Wei ordered Xin Pi to hold the festival, and told Sima Yi not to go out to fight. When the generals of Shu heard about this, they reported it to Kongming. Kong Ming smiled and said, ""This is the law of the three armies of Sima Yi'an."" Jiang Wei said, ""How did the prime minister know about it?"" Kong Ming said, ""He has no intention to fight, so those who invite him to fight will show his martial arts to all ears. Don't you hear: 'When the general is outside, the emperor's orders will not be accepted.' Is there anyone who invites a battle for thousands of miles? This is because Sima Yi is angry with the soldiers, so he uses the master of Cao Rui to control the people. Now I spread this word again, I want to relax the heart of our army. ""","Desperate to make the Wei troops come out to fight again, Kong Ming even sends a woman’s headdress and a shroud to mock and insult Sima Yi, but this doesn’t draw him out. Instead the messenger is questioned by Sima Yi about the habits of Kong Ming. ‘","Cao Rui read it and turned questioningly to his courtiers seeking an explanation. Xin Pi supplied it. “Sima Yi has no desire to give battle; this memorial is because of the shame put upon the officers by Zhuge Liang's gift. They are all in a rage. He wishes for an edict to pacify them.” Cao Rui understood and gave to Xin Pi an authority flag and sent him to the River Wei camp to make known that it was the Emperor's command not to fight. Sima Yi received the messenger with all respect, and it was given out that any future reference to offering battle would be taken as disobedience to the Emperor's especial command in the edict. The officers could but obey. Sima Yi said to Xin Pi, “Noble Sir, you interpreted my own desire correctly.” It was thenceforward understood that Sima Yi was forbidden to give battle. When it was told to Zhuge Liang, he said, “This is only Sima Yi's method of pacifying his army. He has never had any intention of fighting and requested the edict to justify his strategy. It is well known that a general in the field takes no command from any person, not even his own king. Is it likely that he would send a thousand miles to ask permission to fight if that was all he needed? The officers were bitter, and so Sima Yi got the Emperor to assist him in maintaining discipline. All this is meant to slacken our soldiers.”"

却說孔明自令馬謖等守街亭去後，猶豫不定。忽報王平使人送圖本至。孔明喚入，左右呈上圖本。孔明就文几上拆開視之，拍案大驚曰：“馬謖無知，坑陷吾軍矣！”左右問曰：“丞相何故失驚？”孔明曰：“吾觀此圖本：失却要路，占山為寨。倘魏兵大至，四面圍合，斷汲水道路，不須二日，軍自亂矣。若街亭有失，吾等安歸？”長史楊儀進曰：“某雖不才，願替馬幼常回。”孔明將安營之法，一一分付與楊儀——正待要行，忽報馬到來，說：“街亭、列柳城，盡皆失了！”孔明跌足長歎曰：“大事去矣！——此吾之過也！”急喚關興、張苞分付曰：“汝二人各引三千精兵，投武功山小路而行。如遇魏兵，不可大擊，只鼓譟吶喊，為疑兵驚之。彼當自走，亦不可追。待軍退盡，便投陽平關去。”又令張翼先引軍去修理劍閣，以備歸路。又密傳號令，敎大軍暗暗收拾行裝，以備起程。又令馬岱、姜維斷後，先伏於山谷中，待諸軍退盡，方始收兵。又令心腹人，分路報與天水、南安、安定三郡官吏軍民，皆入漢中。又遣心腹人到冀縣搬取姜維老母，送入漢中。,"But he said that Kong Ming was hesitant after he ordered Ma Su to wait for Shoujieting to go. He suddenly reported to Wang Ping that he sent a picture book to him. Kong Ming called in, and left and right showed the picture above. Kong Ming took it apart on the text table and looked at it, and he was shocked and said: ""Ma Su is ignorant, and trapped our army!"" The left and right asked, ""Why is the prime minister shocked?"" Kong Ming said: ""I read this picture: I lost the way , occupying the mountain as a stronghold. If the Wei army reaches a large number, encircles it on all sides, and cuts off the road to draw water, it will not take two days and the army will be in chaos. Although a certain person is not talented, I would like to return for the young horses."" Kong Ming gave Yang Yi the method of setting up the camp one by one - just as he was about to go, he suddenly reported the arrival of the horse and said, ""Jieting and Liliucheng are all lost!"" Kong Ming sighed and said: ""The big thing is over! - This is my fault!"" He called Guan Xing and Zhang Bao to share them and said, ""You two will each lead three thousand elite soldiers and go down the path of Wugong Mountain. Soldiers, don't make a big blow, just shout and scream, to startle the suspicious soldiers. He should walk on his own, but don't chase him. When the army has retreated, he will go to Yangping Pass."" Then Zhang Yi first led the army to repair the sword pavilion, in preparation for the way back. They also secretly sent orders to instruct the army to pack their bags secretly in preparation for their departure. After he ordered Ma Dai and Jiang Wei to cut off, they would first lie down in the valley and wait until all the troops had retreated before withdrawing their troops. He also ordered his confidantes to report to the three counties of Tianshui, Nan'an, and Anding, and all of them entered Hanzhong. They also sent confidants to Jixian to take Jiang Wei's mother and send him to Hanzhong.","From there he directs the next stage of his plan, laying ambushes and attacks to confront Kong Ming’s men. Meanwhile, Kong Ming has received Wang Ping’s map and is in despair at the stupidity of Ma Su. Then news comes of the fall of Jieting and Lieliu. He hastily advances to Xicheng, where the army’s supplies are stored. With just five thousand men he is suddenly informed that the Wei army of a hundred and fifty thousand are advancing on the city, led by Sima Yi.","After Zhuge Liang had sent Ma Su to guard Jieting, his mind was constantly disturbed. Then arrived the messenger with the topography and plan prepared by Wang Ping. Zhuge Liang went over to his table and opened the letter. As he read it he smote the table in wrath. “Ma Su's foolishness has destroyed the army!” he cried. “Why are you so disturbed, O Minister?” asked those near. “By this plan I see that we have lost command of an important road. The camp has been made on the hill; and if the Wei army come in force, our army will be surrounded and their water supply interrupted. In two days the soldiers will be in a state of mutiny; and if Jieting shall be lost, how shall we be able to retire?” Here High Counselor Yang Yi said, “I am none too clever I know, but let me go to replace Ma Su.” Zhuge Liang explained to Yang Yi how and where to camp; but before he could start, a horseman brought the news of the loss of Jieting and Liliu. This made Zhuge Liang very sad, and he sighed, saying, “The whole scheme has come to nought, and it is my fault.” Zhuge Liang sent for Guan Xing and Zhang Bao, and said, “Each of you takes three thousand of good soldiers and go along the road to Wugong Hills. If you fall in with the enemy, do not fight, but beat drums and raise a hubbub and make them hesitate and be doubtful, so that they may retire. Do not pursue, but when they retire, make for Yangping Pass.” He also sent Zhang Yi to put Saber Pass in order for retreat and issued instructions for making ready to march. Ma Dai and Jiang Wei were told to guard the rear, but they were to go into ambush in the valleys till the whole army would have retreated. Trusty messengers were sent with the news to Tianshui, Nanan, and Anding that the officers, army and people might go away into Hanzhong. He also sent to remove to a place of safety in Hanzhong the aged mother of Jiang Wei."
張飛和魏延連日攻打關隘不下。飛見不濟事，把軍退二十里，却和魏延引數十騎，自來兩邊哨探小路。忽見男女數人，各背小包，於山僻路攀藤附葛而走。飛於馬上用鞭指與魏延曰：“奪瓦口關，只在這幾個百姓身上。”便喚軍士分付：“休要驚恐他。好生喚那幾個百姓來。”軍士連忙喚到馬前。飛用好言以安其心，問其何來。百姓告曰：“某等皆漢中居民，今欲還鄕，聽知大軍廝殺，塞閉閬中官道；今過蒼溪，從梓潼山檜釿川入漢中，還家去。”飛曰：“這條路取瓦口關遠近若何？”百姓曰：“從梓潼山小路，却是瓦口關背後。”飛大喜，帶百姓入寨中，與了酒食；分付魏延：“引兵扣關攻打，我親自引輕騎出梓潼山攻關後。”便令百姓引路，選輕騎五百，從小路而進。,"Zhang Fei and Wei Yan kept attacking the pass for days. Fei saw that it was not going to help, so he retreated the army twenty li, but led dozens of cavalry with Wei Yan, and came to both sides to check the path. Suddenly I saw a number of men and women, each carrying a small bag, and walking on a remote road in the mountains, climbing vines and geese. Fei Yu Ma said to Wei Yan with the finger of the whip: ""Duowakou Pass is only for these few people."" Then he called the sergeant to pay: ""Don't scare him. It's good to call those people."" The sergeant called Ma quickly. forward. Fei used kind words to reassure his heart and asked him where he came from. The people said, ""A certain class of people are all Hanzhong residents. Now they want to return to Hanzhong. They heard that the army was fighting and blocked the official road in Langzhong. Now they cross Cangxi and enter Hanzhong from Zitong Mountain and Huiyi River, and return home."" Fei said: ""How far is it from Wakou Pass on this road?"" The people said, ""From the small road in Zitong Mountain, it is behind Wakou Pass."" Fei Da was overjoyed and brought the people into the village, along with wine and food, and distributed them to Wei Yan: ""Lead troops to detain the pass and attack. , I personally lead the Qingqi out of Zitong Mountain to attack the key point."" Then he ordered the people to lead the way, choosing five hundred Qingqi, and entered from the small road.","When news of this reaches Zhang Fei, he rushes to the pass and challenges Zhang He. Zhang He tries to pull the same trick on Zhang Fei, but he doesn’t fall for it. Their struggles over the next few days are inconclusive, despite each trying to outwit the other by such tricks and ambushes. Zhang He is now firmly ensconced in the camp guarding the Wakou pass. Then one day Zhang Fei notices some traders travelling by a steep hillside path.","Zhang Fei and Wei Yan then tried to take the Pass, but day after day they failed. Zhang Fei, seeing no hope of success, retired seven miles and bivouacked. From this point he sent out scouts under Wei Yan to explore the country. While going along, they observed some burden-bearers, men and women, going up a very retired path, pulling down the creepers, and pushing aside the grasses. “That is the way to take Wakou Pass,” cried Zhang Fei, pointing with his whip to the wayfarers. He ordered his soldiers not to scare the people, but to call a few gently and bring them to him. They soon had several standing before their leader, who spoke to them kindly and put them at ease. “Whence come you?” asked Zhang Fei. “We belong to Hanzhong and are going home. We heard that you were out fighting and the high road to Langzhong was blockaded, and so we have come across the Mist Torrent and Zitong Mountains and down River Guijin. We are going to our homes in Hanzhong.” “Can one reach Wakou Pass by this road? And how far is it?” The country people replied, “A small road leads past to the rear of the Pass from Zitong Mountains.” For this piece of information Zhang Fei rewarded them by taking them into his camp and giving them a good meal. Then he sent off Wei Yan to make a frontal attack on the Pass, while he himself with five hundred light horse attacked it from the rear by way of Mount Zitong."

Suddenly someone came from Jingzhou and said that Dongwu proposed to Guan Gong, but Guan Gong refused. Kong Ming said: ""Jingzhou is in danger! Someone can come back for Guan Gong."" During the negotiation, Jingzhou reported the mission and came one after another. A few days later, Guan Xing arrived, and he made a statement about the Seventh Army of Water. Suddenly, he reported the arrival of the horse, and reported that Guan Gong had set up many piers on the riverside, and the dikes were very dense, which was absolutely safe. Therefore, Xuande was relieved.","The terrible news from the east comes through in dribs and drabs. First, the news that Wu has offered a marriage alliance to Guan Yu – upon which Kong Ming comments, ‘Jingzhou will fall.’ Next, Guan Xing, Guan Yu’s oldest son, arrives to tell of Guan Yu’s triumph over the seven armies through the flooding trick. Then news comes of the establishment of the chain of beacons. This reassures Xuande that all is in order. A few days later, Xuande is unable to sleep.","The fields yielded bountiful harvests. Suddenly there came one who told of the attempt of Sun Quan to ally himself with Guan Yu by marriage, and the indignant rejection of the proposal. “Jingzhou is in danger,” said Zhuge Liang. “Recall and replace Guan Yu.” Then began to arrive a series of messengers from Jingzhou, bearers of news of the moves in the game. At first they brought good tidings, then evil. Guan Xing came first to tell of the drowning of the seven armies of Yu Jin. Then one reported the installation of beacon towers along the river bank, and other preparations which seemed as near perfect as any could be. And Liu Bei's anxiety ceased.

There is a lot of food and grass in the city, but there are few people and horses. When I heard that the soldiers of Shu were coming, I was in a hurry with Wang Zhen and Li Peng, two generals, to lead the troops twenty miles away from the city to the village. The next day, the soldiers of Shu came, and Wang Yin's second generals came into battle. Jiang Wei went out and said with hope: ""Now Sima Zhao has moved his master to the army, it must have the intention of Li Jue and Guo Si. I have been ordered by the court to come here to ask the guilt, and you should surrender early. If you are still ignorant , the whole family will be punished!"" Wang answered loudly: ""You are rude, and you have committed crimes in the country. If you don't leave early, you will not be able to return!"" Before the words were finished, Wang Zhen came out with a spear behind Wang Zhen, and Fu Yu in the Shu formation came out. welcome. When the battle was not tenable, and there was a flaw in the sale, Wang Zhen stabbed with a spear. Fu Yan flashed past, caught him alive on the horse, and returned to his main formation. Li Peng was furious and came to the rescue. Yi deliberately slowed down, waited for Li Peng to approach, and tried to throw it to the ground, secretly holding the iron slip in his hand; when Peng caught up with the knife and wanted to slash, Fu Ying stole back and looked back at Li Peng with only a brief face at the door, beating his eyes hard. burst out, died under the horse. Wang Zhen was stabbed to death by the Shu army. Jiang Wei drove his troops forward. Sima Wang abandoned the village and entered the city, but did not go out behind closed doors. Wei ordered: ""The sergeant will take a night's rest tonight to keep his spirits up. In the future, he must enter the city."" The next day, when it was clear, the soldiers of Shu rushed to the city and rushed to the city. Hit the city with a rocket fire. The thatched huts on the city were set on fire, and the Wei soldiers were in chaos. Wei also sent people to fill the city with dry wood, and set fire to the sky. The city was about to fall, and the Wei soldiers were weeping bitterly in the city, and the voices of the four wilds were heard.","At first he is successful, overwhelming Sima Wang, a cousin of Sima Zhao, who is commander of the city of Changcheng, where Wei supplies are stored. Defeated in the field, Sima Wang retreats into the city, and Jiang Wei besieges it. Just as the Shu troops are about to overwhelm the city walls and seize the city, reinforcements arrive, led by the great Wei general Deng Ai.","The Commander in Changcheng was Sima Wang, a cousin of Sima Zhao. Huge stores of grain were in the city, but its defenses were weak. So when Sima Wang heard of the approach of the Shu army, he and his two leaders, Wang Zhen and Li Peng, made a camp seven miles from the walls to keep any attack at a distance. When the enemy came up, Sima Wang and his two generals went forth from the ranks to meet them. Jiang Wei stood in the front of his army and said, “Sima Zhao has forced his prince to go with him to war, which plainly indicates that he intends to emulate the deeds of Li Jue and Guo Si. My government has commanded me to punish this fault. Wherefore I say to you yield at once; for if you persist in the way of error, you and yours shall all be put to death.” Sima Wang shouted back, “You and yours are wholly strangers to any feeling of rectitude. You have repeatedly invaded a superior state's territory; and if you do not at once retire, I will see to it that not even a breastplate returns.” With these words General Wang Zhen rode out, his spear set ready to thrust. From the host of Shu came Fu Qian to take the challenge, and the two champions engaged. After a few encounters Fu Qian tempted his opponent by feigning weakness. Wang Zhen thrust at the opening he gave. Fu Qian evaded the blow, snatched Wang Zhen out of the saddle, and bore him off. Seeing this, his colleague, Li Peng whirled up his sword and went pounding down toward the captor. Fu Qian went but slowly, thus luring Li Peng into rash pursuit. When Li Peng was near enough, Fu Qian dashed his prisoner with all his strength to the earth, took a firm grip on his four-edged brand, and smote Li Peng full in the face. The blow knocked out an eye, and Li Peng fell dead. Wang Zhen had been already killed by the Shu troops as he lay on the ground. Both generals being dead, the troops of Wei fled into the city and barred the gates. Jiang Wei gave orders for the army to rest that night and take the city on the morrow with all vigor. Next day, at dawn, the assault began. The soldiers, fresh from their rest, vied with each other who should be first on the wall. They shot over the ramparts fire-arrows and firebombs and burned all the buildings on the wall. They next brought up brushwood and piled it against the rampart and set it alight, so that the flames rose high. When the city seemed about to fall, the defenders set up a howling and a lamentation that could be heard all around."
為臣食祿當思報，事主臨危合盡忠。,"For the minister's food and wealth, he should think about retribution, and the victim will be loyal in the face of danger.","Suddenly Sima Yi recalls that one member of the extended Cao clan whom he has not killed is the great warrior Xiahou Xuan, who undoubtedly could be a threat.","“You call him lord and take his pay, Then stand by him when danger nears.”"
是夜，關平引一枝兵殺入魏寨，不見一人。平知是計，火速退時，左邊徐商，右邊呂建，兩下夾攻。平大敗回營，魏兵乘勢追殺前來，四面圍住。關平、廖化支持不住，棄了第一屯，逕投四冢寨來。早望見寨中火起。急到寨前，只見皆是魏兵旗號。關平等退兵，忙奔樊城大路而走。前面一軍攔住，為首大將，乃是徐晃也。平、化二人奮力死戰，奪路而走，回到大寨，來見關公曰：“今徐晃奪了偃城等處；又兼曹操自引大軍，分三路來救樊城；多有人言荊州已被呂蒙襲了。”關公喝曰：“此敵人訛言，以亂我軍心耳！東吳呂蒙病危，孺子陸遜代之，不足為慮！”,"That night, Guan Ping led an army into Wei Zhai, but no one was seen. Knowing that it was a plan, when they retreated quickly, Xu Shang on the left and Lv Jian on the right, attacked twice. Ping was defeated and returned to the camp, and Wei soldiers took advantage of the momentum to chase and attack, and surrounded him on all sides. Guan Ping and Liao Hua couldn't support it, they abandoned the first village and went to Sizhongzhai. I saw the fire in the village early. When I rushed to the front of the village, I saw that they were all under the banner of Wei soldiers. Guan Ping retreated and hurried to Fancheng Road. The army in front stopped him, and the chief general was Xu Huang. Ping and Hua fought to the death, took the road, returned to Dazhai, and came to see Guan Gong and said: ""Now Xu Huang has captured Yancheng and other places; and Cao Cao has led his own army to rescue Fancheng in three ways; there are many people. It is said that Jingzhou has been attacked by Lü Meng."" Guan Gong shouted: ""This enemy is making false statements to disturb our army's heart! Eastern Wu Lü Meng is critically ill, and his son Lu Xun takes his place.","When night falls, Guan Ping and his men attack the north camp – only to find not a soul there. Realizing too late that this is a trap, they are suddenly surprised by an attack by Xu Shang and Lü Jian. Guan Ping and his men flee, but many die in the conflict. Heading towards Sizhong, they are astonished and horrified to see that camp on fire and the whole encampment in the hands of the Wei army. Only by the skin of their teeth do Guan Ping and Liao Hua escape and make it back to where Guan Yu is based. There, they report the collapse of their defence and the seizure of Yancheng and the camps. They also have to pass on the news that Cao Cao is advancing on Fancheng and that Lü Meng has taken Jingzhou. Guan Yu reacts angrily, denouncing the news about Jingzhou. ‘That is nothing but a lie!’ he roars. ‘ Lü Meng is ill, and this is just some inexperienced youth called Lu Xun. Nothing to worry about – do you understand?’","Then Guan Ping knew he had been deceived, and turned to retreat. He was at once attacked on two sides by Xu Shang and Lu Qian from left and right. Unable to stand, his troops ran for the camp. The soldiers of Wei followed, and presently the camp was surrounded. They were compelled to abandon the position and set off for Sizhong. As they drew near they saw torches, and presently knew by the ensigns displayed that the camp had also fallen to the enemy. Retiring, they hastened along the high road toward Fankou, but presently their way was barred by a force under Xu Huang himself. By dint of hard fighting they got away and returned to their main camp, and Guan Ping went to his father. “Xu Huang has got possession of Yencheng; Cao Cao's main army is on the way in three divisions; and many say that Jingzhou is in the enemy's hands.” Guan Yu bade him be silent. “This is a fabrication of the enemy,” said Guan Yu, “but it may dishearten the soldiers. We know Lu Meng is ill, and they have appointed that impractical fellow Lu Xun to succeed him at Lukou. There is nothing to fear.”"
却說張郃、徐晃領兵追至蜀寨，天色已暮；見寨中偃旗息鼓，又見趙雲匹馬單鎗，立於營外，寨門大開，二將不敢前進。正疑之間，曹操親到，急催督衆軍向前。衆軍聽令，大喊一聲，殺奔營前；見趙雲全然不動，曹兵翻身就回。趙雲把鎗一招，壕中弓弩齊發。時天色昏黑，正不知蜀兵多少。操先撥回馬走。只聽得後面喊聲大震，鼓角齊鳴，蜀兵趕來。曹兵自相踐踏；擁到漢水河邊，落水死者，不知其數。趙雲、黃忠、張著各引兵一枝，追殺甚急。操正奔走間，忽劉封、孟達率二枝兵，從米倉山路殺來，放火燒糧草。操棄了北山糧草，忙回南鄭。徐晃、張郃紮脚不住，亦棄本寨而走。趙雲占了曹寨，黃忠奪了糧草、漢水，所得軍器無數，大獲勝捷，差人去報玄德。玄德遂同孔明前至漢水，問趙雲的部卒曰：“子龍如何廝殺？”軍士將子龍救黃忠、拒漢水之事，細述一遍。玄德大喜，看了山前山後險峻之路，欣然謂孔明曰：“子龍一身都是膽也！”後人有詩讚曰：,"However, they said that Zhang He and Xu Huang led the troops to chase to the Shu village, and the sky was already dusk; seeing that the banners were quiet in the village, and that Zhao Yun was standing outside the camp with a single gun, and the gate of the village was wide open, so the two generals did not dare to advance. When he was in doubt, Cao Cao arrived in person and hurriedly urged the army to move forward. The army obeyed the order, shouted loudly, and rushed to the front of the camp; seeing that Zhao Yun was completely motionless, Cao Bing turned over and returned. Zhao Yun swung his gun and fired a bow and crossbow in the trench. It was dark and dark, and I didn't know how many Shu soldiers were there. Fuck first dial back the horse and go. Only the shouts from behind were loudly shaken, the drum horns rang in unison, and the soldiers of Shu came. Cao's soldiers trampled on each other; they rushed to the Han River and fell into the water and died. Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, and Zhang Zhu each led an army to pursue and kill them urgently. While Cao was running, suddenly Liu Feng and Meng Da led two soldiers to kill them from Micang Mountain Road and set fire to food and grass. He abandoned Beishan's grain and grass and hurriedly returned to Nanzheng. Xu Huang and Zhang He were unable to hold their feet, so they also abandoned their village and left. Zhao Yun occupied Cao Zhai, Huang Zhong seized food and grass, Han water, and obtained countless weapons. Xuande then went to the Han River with Kong Ming and asked Zhao Yun's subordinates, ""How did Zilong fight?"" Xuande was overjoyed, and when he saw the steep road in front of the mountain and behind the mountain, he happily said to Kong Ming: ""Zilong is full of courage!""","Meanwhile Zhang Yi positions archers and crossbowmen in hiding. Cao Cao himself is advancing with the troops when he sees Zhao Zilong standing defiant and alone. He spurs on his troops, but as they rush forward, Zilong’s silent stance alarms them, and they halt. This is the moment when Zilong gives the signal, and the arrows and bolts fly through the air. Chaos reigns as the Wei soldiers, including Cao Cao, turn and flee in the face of the attacking Shu forces. Many are lost. The supplies are destroyed, and the whole Wei army retreats to Nanzheng in disarray. Great is Xuande’s praise for Zhao Zilong and his decisive actions.","It was dusk when Zhang He and Xu Huang neared the camp of the army of Shu. They saw that the ensigns and weapons had been overthrown, and no drums beat at their approach. They also saw the one figure of the doughty warrior at the gate, and then they halted and dared advance no farther. While they hesitated, Cao Cao arrived and urged his army to march quicker. They answered with a shout and made a dash forward, but they saw the one figure at the gate, and every man halted. And before long, one by one they turned about and went away. Then Zhao Yun gave a signal to his troops to come out of the moat, and the archers and bowmen began to shoot. The soldiers of Cao Cao knew not in the dusk how many their enemies were, but terror seized upon them and they ran, each trying to be first. And as they ran, the drums rolled, and the soldiers of Shu shouted and pursued, till the flight became a perfect rout and a confused mass of troops reached the banks of River Han. The press continuing, many soldiers of Cao Cao were forced into the river and were drowned. Zhao Yun, Huang Zhong, and Zhang Zhu followed close on the heels of the routed army; and while Cao Cao was making off with all speed, two other generals of Shu, Liu Feng and Meng Da, came from Micang Mountain and set fire to all the army stores of food and forage in Northern Mountain. Then Cao Cao abandoned the stores in Northern Mountain and set out hastily for Nanzheng. Zhang He and Xu Huang could make no stand, and they also abandoned their camps, which Zhao Yun at once occupied. Beside the stores of food, the victors collected countless weapons along the banks of the river. They sent news of the victory to Liu Bei, who came with Zhuge Liang to the scene of the victory, and there they heard the full story of Zhao Yun's prowess. Liu Bei was glad, and when he had seen the steepness and difficulties of the surrounding hills and understood the fine deeds of valor that had been done, he turned to Zhuge Liang and said, “Truly, the man is brave all through!” Behold Zhao Yun of Changshan, Whose whole body is valor;"
※※※,※※※,"After that Jiang Wei helps Kong Ming take Tianshui, while Xiahou Mao and Ma Zun flee to safety in Qianghu.","When the Shu army reached the west bank of River Wei, the scouts reported their movements in Luoyang, and, at a court held in the first year of the era of Calm Peace (AD 227), a minister told the Ruler of Wei of the threatened invasion."
王平受計引兵而去。孔明又喚張嶷分付曰：“汝引五百軍，都扮作六丁六甲神兵，鬼頭獸身，用五彩塗面，妝作種種怪異之狀；一手執繡旗，一手仗寶劍；身挂葫蘆，內藏煙火之物，伏於山傍。待木牛流馬到時，放起煙火，一齊擁出，驅牛馬而行。魏兵見之，必疑是神鬼，不敢來追趕。”張嶷受計引兵而去。孔明又喚魏延、姜維分付曰：“汝二人同引一萬兵，去北原寨口接應木牛流馬，以防交戰。”又喚廖化、張翼分付曰：“汝二人引五千兵，去斷司馬懿來路。”又喚馬忠、馬岱分付曰：“汝二人引二千兵去渭南搦戰。”六人各各遵令而去。,"Wang Ping led his troops away. Kong Ming also called Zhang Yi to pay and said, ""You have led five hundred troops, all of them dressed as six soldiers of six armors and six armors, with ghost heads and beast bodies, painted with five colors on their faces, and made up in all kinds of strange shapes; one hand holds an embroidered flag, and the other holds a sword. Hanging a gourd, with fireworks hidden inside, it crouches beside the mountain. When the wooden cows and horses arrive, they set off fireworks, rush out together, and drive the cows and horses away. When Wei soldiers see it, they must be ghosts and dare not come to chase.” Zhang Yi led his troops away. Kong Ming also called Wei Yan and Jiang Wei to pay and said, ""You two will lead 10,000 soldiers together and go to Beiyuan Zhaikou to meet the wooden cows and horses in order to prevent war."" Soldiers, go and cut off Sima Yi's way."" Then he called Ma Zhong and Ma Dai to pay and said, ""You two lead 2,000 soldiers to Weinan to fight.""","Hearing the cries of his men, Sima Yi rides out himself to the rescue, but he is trapped, and his men desert, leaving him stranded.","Next he called Zhang Ni and said, “Dress up five hundred soldiers in the costume of the Deities of the Six Layers so that they appear supernatural. Fit them with demon heads and wild beast shapes, and let them stain their faces various colors so as to look as strange as possible. Give them flags and swords and bottle-gourds with smoke issuing from combustibles inside. Let these soldiers hide among the hills till the convoy approaches, when they will start the smoke, rush out suddenly and drive off the wooden animals. No one will dare pursue such uncanny company.” When Zhang Ni had left, Wei Yan and Jiang Wei were called. “You will take ten thousand troops, go to the border of Beiyuan to receive the wooden transport creatures and defend them against attack.” Then another five thousand under Zhang Yi and Liao Hua was sent to check Sima Yi if he should come, while a small force under Ma Dai and Ma Zhong was sent to bid defiance to the enemy near their camp on the south bank."
蹶然——突然而起的樣子。,Knocked up - the appearance of a sudden rise.,We will find out.,The result of the new expedition will be told in the next chapter.
驃騎大將軍總領雍、涼等處兵馬事司馬懿，謹以信義布告天下：昔太祖武皇帝，創立基業，本欲立陳思王子建為社稷主；不幸奸讒交集，歲久潛龍。皇孫曹叡，素無德行，妄自居尊，有負太祖之遺意。今吾應天順人，尅日興師，以慰萬民之望。告示到日，各宜歸命新君。如不順者，當滅九族！先此告聞，想宜知悉。,"Sima Yi, the general of the hussars in charge of the military affairs of Yong and Liang, would like to declare to the world with faith: Emperor Taizu Wu, who founded the foundation, originally wanted to establish Prince Chen Si as the head of the society. The emperor's grandson, Cao Rui, had no morals and was arrogant, and had the will of the Taizu. Today, I obey the heavens and obey the people, and strive to raise teachers every day, so as to comfort the hope of the people. When the notice arrives, each should return to the new king. If you don't go well, you will destroy the nine clans! First of all, I want to know about it.","The poster then goes on to say that in order to fulfil Cao Cao’s original intentions, ‘Sima Yi has no option but to overthrow the current ruler in accordance with the wishes of Heaven and the people.’","“I, Sima Yi, Imperial Commander of the Flying Cavalry, Commander of the Forces of Xizhou and Xiliang, confident in the universal principles of right, now inform the empire, saying: “The Founder of this Dynasty, Emperor Cao, established himself with the design of recurring the empire to the Lord of Linzi Cao Zhi. Unfortunately, calumny spread abroad, and the Emperor could not manifest himself for many years. His grandson, Cao Rui, does not follow a virtuous course, though sitting in the high place, and has not fulfilled the great intention of his ancestor. Now I, in accordance with the will of Heaven and favoring the desires of the people, have decided upon a day to set my army in motion in order to secure the wish of the people; and when that day arrives, I call upon each one to gather to his lord; and I will destroy utterly the family of any who shall disobey. You are hereby informed that you may all know.” This document frightened the young Emperor, and he turned pale."
操屯兵日久，欲要進兵，又被馬超拒守；欲收兵回，又恐被蜀兵恥笑：心中猶豫不決。適庖官進雞湯。操見碗中有雞肋，因而有感於懷。正沈吟間，夏侯惇入帳，稟請夜間口號。操隨口曰：“雞肋！雞肋！”惇傳令衆官，都稱“雞肋”。行軍主簿楊修，見傳“雞肋”二字，便敎隨行軍士，各收拾行裝，準備歸程。有人報知夏侯惇。惇大驚，遂請楊修至帳中問曰：“公何收拾行裝？”修曰：“以今夜號令，便知魏王不日將退兵歸也：雞肋者，食之無肉，棄之有味。今進不能勝，退恐人笑，在此無益，不如早歸：來日魏王必班師矣。故先收拾行裝，免得臨行慌亂。”夏侯惇曰：“公眞知魏王肺腑也！”遂亦收拾行裝。於是寨中諸將，無不準備歸計。當夜曹操心亂，不能穩睡，遂手提鋼斧，遶寨私行。只見夏侯惇寨內軍士，各準備行裝。操大驚，急回帳召惇問其故。惇曰：“主簿楊德祖，先知大王欲歸之意。”操喚楊修問之，修以雞肋之意對。操大怒曰：“汝怎敢造言，亂我軍心！”喝刀斧手推出斬之，將首級號令於轅門外。,"Cao had been camping for a long time, and he wanted to advance, but was rejected by Ma Chao; he wanted to withdraw his troops, but he was afraid of being ridiculed by the soldiers of Shu: he was hesitant in his heart. It is suitable for the official to enter the chicken soup. Cao saw that there were chicken ribs in the bowl, so he felt it. While he was pondering, Xiahou Dun entered the account and asked for the night slogan. Cao said casually: ""Chicken ribs! Chicken ribs!"" Dun Chuan ordered all the officials to call them ""chicken ribs"". Yang Xiu, the chief clerk of the march, saw the word ""chicken rib"" in the legend, so he ordered the accompanying sergeants to pack their bags and prepare for their return. Someone reported to Xiahou Dun. Dun was greatly alarmed, so he asked Yang Xiu to go to the tent and asked, ""Why did you pack your suitcase?"" Xiu said, ""With the order tonight, I know that the King of Wei will soon retreat from his troops. Taste. If you can’t win if you advance now, if you retreat, it’s useless here, so it’s better to return early: In the future, the King of Wei will be instructed. So pack your bags first, so as not to panic when you leave.” Xiahou Dun said, “Your Majesty knows the heart of the King of Wei! ""So he also packed his bags. So the generals in the village were all ready to reckon. That night Cao Cao was so upset that he couldn't sleep peacefully, so he took a steel axe and walked around the village privately. I saw the sergeants in Xiahou Dunzhai, all preparing their luggage. Cao was shocked, and hurriedly returned to the account and summoned Dun to ask why. Dun said: ""Master Yang Dezu, the Prophet King wants to return."" Cao called Yang Xiu to ask him, and Xiu responded with a tasteless meaning. Cao was furious and said, ""How dare you make a statement and disturb our army's heart!"" The sword and axemen pushed him out and ordered his head to be placed outside the Yuanmen.","With these additional forces, Cao Cao defends the valley, and it is here that the armies fight again. The battle is indecisive, and for many days the enemies sit facing each other. One night Cao Cao is having dinner when he is given a bowl of chicken soup, and floating in the soup is some chicken gristle. Asked at that moment to give the password for the night, he says, ‘Chicken gristle’. When Yang Xiu, who is his primary secretary, hears this he tells his men to start packing up to go home. Challenged by Xiahou Dun as to why he has done this, Yang Xiu says because of the password. ‘Chicken gristle has no meat on it, but it adds to the flavour. So this means we cannot advance, but to retreat will put us out of favour with others. So we have no option but to go home!’ Soon everyone is packing up, and when Cao Cao discovers what is going on he is furious. ‘How dare you make up these stories!’ he shouts at Yang Xiu and orders his immediate execution. Cao Cao and Yang Xiu have a long history of misunderstandings and of Yang Xiu being perhaps a little too clever for Cao Cao, who both admires and resents him.","Here he remained many days, prevented from advancing by Ma Chao and fearing the ridicule of Shu if he should retreat. One day, while he was anxiously trying to decide what to do, his cook sent in some chicken broth. He noticed in the broth some chicken tendons, and this simple fact led him into a train of reflection. He was still deep in thought when Xiahou Dun entered his tent to ask the watchword for that night. Cao Cao at once involuntarily replied, “Chicken tendon.” The word was passed on in orders. When First Secretary Yang Xiu saw the order that the watchword was “chicken tendon,” he told all his people to pack up their belongings ready for the march. One who saw this went and told Xiahou Dun, who sent for Yang Xiu and asked why he had packed up. Yang Xiu replied, “By tonight's orders I see that the Prince of Wei is soon going to retire. ' Chicken tendons' are tasteless things to eat, and yet it is a pity to waste them. Now if we advance, we cannot conquer; and if we retire, we fear we shall look ridiculous. There being no advantage here, the best course is to retire. You will certainly see the Prince of Wei retreat before long. I have made my preparations so as not to be hurried and confused at the last moment.” “You seem to know the Prince's inmost heart,” said Xiahou Dun, and he bade his servants pack. The other generals seeing this, also made preparations for departure. Cao Cao's mind was too perturbed for sleep. In the night he got up, took a steel battle-ax in his hand, and wandered privily through the camp. When he got to Xiahou Dun's tents, he saw everything packed and ready for a move. Much surprised, he made his way back to his own tent and sent for that officer. “Why is everything in your camp packed as if ready for the march?” “Yang Xiu, the First Secretary, seems to have private knowledge of the Prince's design to retire,” said Xiahou Dun. Cao Cao summoned Yang Xiu and questioned him, and Yang Xiu replied with the chicken tendon incident. “How dare you invent such a story and disturb the hearts of my army?” Cao Cao called in his lictors and told them to take Yang Xiu away and behead him and hang his head at the camp gate."
却說楊懷、高沛二人身邊各藏利刃，帶二百軍兵，撁羊送酒，直至軍前。見並無準備，心中暗喜，以為中計。入至帳下，見玄德正與龐統坐於帳中。二將聲喏曰：“聞皇叔遠回，特具薄禮相送。”遂進酒勸玄德。玄德曰：“二將軍守關不易，當先飲此盃。”二將飲酒畢，玄德曰：“吾有密事與二將軍商議，閒人退避。”遂將帶來二百人盡趕出中軍。玄德叱曰：“左右與吾捉下二賊！”帳後劉封、關平應聲而出。楊、高二人急待爭鬥，劉封、關平各捉住一人。玄德喝曰：“吾與汝主是同宗兄弟，汝二人何故同謀，離間親情？”龐統叱左右搜其身畔，果然各搜出利刃一口。統便喝斬二人；玄德還猶未決。統曰：“二人本意欲殺吾主，罪不容誅。”遂叱刀斧手斬楊懷、高沛於帳前。黃忠、魏延早將二百從人，先自捉下，不曾走了一個。玄德喚入，各賜酒壓驚。玄德曰：“楊懷、高沛離間吾兄弟，又藏利刃行刺，故行誅戮。爾等無罪，不必驚疑。”衆皆拜謝。龐統曰：“吾今卽用汝等引路，帶吾軍取關。各有重賞。”衆皆應允。是夜二百人先行，大軍隨後。前軍至關下叫曰：“二將軍有急事回，可速開關。”城上聽得是自家軍，卽時開關。大軍一擁而入，兵不血刃，得了涪關。蜀兵皆降。玄德各加重賞，遂卽分兵前後守把。次日勞軍，設宴於公廳。玄德酒酣，顧龐統曰：“今日之會，可為樂乎！”龐統曰：“伐人之國而以為樂，非仁者之兵也。”玄德曰：“吾聞昔日武王伐紂，作樂象功，此亦非仁者之兵歟？汝言何不合道理？可速退！”龐統大笑而起。左右亦扶玄德入後堂。睡至半夜，酒醒。左右以逐龐統之言，告知玄德。玄德大悔；次早穿衣陞堂，請龐統謝罪曰：“昨日酒醉，言語觸忤，幸勿挂懷。”龐統談笑自若。玄德曰：“昨日之言，惟吾有失。”龐統曰：“君臣俱失，何獨主公？”玄德亦大笑，其樂如初。,"However, they said that Yang Huai and Gao Pei had sharp knives at their sides, led 200 soldiers, sent sheep and wine to the front of the army. Seeing that he was not prepared, he secretly rejoiced in his heart, thinking that he was a plan. Entering the tent, I saw Xuande sitting in the tent with Pang Tong. The second general said: ""I heard that Uncle Huang is returning from afar, and he sent him with a special gift."" Then he went into the wine and persuaded Xuande. Xuande said: ""It is not easy for the two generals to guard the gate, so you should drink this cup first."" After the two generals finished drinking, Xuande said, ""I have a secret matter to discuss with the second generals, and the idlers should retreat."" Then he brought two hundred people and drove them out. Chinese Army. Xuande shouted, ""Let me catch the two thieves right and left!"" Liu Feng and Guan Ping came out from behind the tent. Yang and Gao were eager to fight, and Liu Feng and Guan Ping each captured one. Xuande shouted: ""My master and I are brothers from the same clan, why did you two conspire together and alienate your family?"" Pang Tong scoured his body left and right, and sure enough, each found a sharp knife. Tong then beheaded the two; Xuande was still undecided. Tong said: ""The two of them intended to kill my lord, and the crime cannot be punished."" He then ordered the sword and axe to cut Yang Huai and Gao Pei in front of the tent. Huang Zhong and Wei Yan had already captured 200 servants, but they did not leave any of them. Xuande called in, and each gave a drink to suppress the shock. Xuande said: ""Yang Huai and Gao Pei separated my brothers, and they hid their sharp knives to stab them, so they executed them. You are innocent, so don't be surprised."" Everyone thanked them. Pang Tong said: ""I will use you now to lead the way and lead my army to the customs. Each will be rewarded heavily."" Everyone agreed. It was the night that two hundred people went first, and the army followed. The former army called at the pass: ""Second General has an urgent matter, so you can quickly switch."" The city heard that it was his own army, and the switch was turned on at the same time. The army swarmed in, and the soldiers were not bloody, and they took Fuguan. The soldiers of Shu all descended. Xuande each increased the reward, so he divided his troops to guard the front and rear. The next day, the army was exhausted, and a banquet was held in the public hall. When Xuande was drinking, Gu Pangtong said, ""Today's meeting can be fun!"" Pang Tong said, ""It is not a soldier of the benevolent to be a soldier of the benevolent."" , Doing music and elephant art, this is not the army of the benevolent? Why is your statement unreasonable? You can retreat quickly!"" Pang Tong laughed loudly. Left and right also helped Xuande into the back hall. Sleep until midnight, wake up. Left and right, told Xuande with the words of Chasing Pang Tong. Xuande regretted greatly; the next morning, he dressed and went to the hall, and asked Pang Tong to apologize and said: ""Yesterday, I was drunk and my words were off-putting. Fortunately, don't worry about it."" Pang Tong talked and laughed freely. Xuande said, ""I am the only one who lost what I said yesterday."" Pang Tong said, ""The ruler and the ministers are all lost, so why is the master alone?"" Xuande also laughed, and his joy was as good as ever.","Meanwhile, Xuande has arrived at the Fu pass and invites the two commanders, Yang Huai and Gao Pei, to come and pay their respects as he departs. They, pretty sure he is planning something, decide to bring an armed guard with them and hide knifes in their clothes, intending to kill Xuande as soon as they meet him. With two hundred men they descend into the pass and come to see Xuande. Xuande is forewarned of trouble, not least by a banner blowing over, which is interpreted by Pang Tong as meaning there is a plot to murder him. As soon as the two commanders come bearing gifts, Xuande welcomes them and then, pretending he has some great secret to share with them, orders their men out of the meeting. Immediately the two men are seized and the knives found on them. ‘Kill them!’ cries Pang Tong. But Xuande hesitates, not sure that this is right. It has to be forcibly presented to him that they planned to kill him and so deserve to die. Persuaded by this, he gives permission and the two men are executed there and then. As for the two hundred men, Xuande offers them freedom or the right to join his army and in return is cheered to the rafters. It is then that Pang Tong springs the next step in his plan. He asks the two hundred if they will help capture the pass through subterfuge by leading Xuande’s men into the fortification. The men are so delighted at not being executed they agree and they lead the way. When the men arrive at the gate they call out for entry. Peering down, the soldiers inside recognize them, and the gate is thrown open. In rush Xuande and his men, as well as the Shu turncoats.","The two generals of the Western Land of Rivers, Yang Huai and Gao Pei, armed with hidden daggers, came up, their escort bearing gifts of sheep and wine. They marked no precautions being taken against an attack and began to think their task of murder would be an easy one. They were led in to where Liu Bei sat under a tent, his adviser with him. They said, “We hear, O Imperial Uncle, that you contemplate a long march, and therefore we come to offer a few poor gifts to speed you on your way.” The cups of farewell were duly filled. Then Liu Bei replied, “You have a heavy responsibility to defend the Pass, Generals. I pray you drink first.” They drank. Then Liu Bei said, “I have a secret matter to talk over with you.” So all the two hundred soldiers of the escort were sent away and led to the midst of the camp. As soon as they had gone, Liu Bei shouted, “My generals, lay hands upon these two rebels!” Thereupon Liu Feng and Guan Ping rushed out from behind the tent. The two generals of the Pass were taken aback, but began to struggle. However, Liu Feng and Guan Ping each seized one man and held him. “Your lord and I are of the same house;” said Liu Bei, “why then have you plotted against me and conspired to sow enmity between us?” Pang Tong bade them search the captives, and the hidden daggers were found. So both were ordered to immediate execution. However, Liu Bei hesitated and was unwilling to confirm the sentence and put them to death. But his adviser insisted that they were worthy of death for the assassination they had penned, and bade the executioners fall on. So the two men were beheaded. Of their following not one had been allowed to slip away. Liu Bei summoned the soldiers of the escort to his tent, gave them wine to comfort them, and said, “Your leaders conspired to sow dissension between brothers and were found with daggers hidden beneath their clothing. They were assassins in intent and have met the fate they merited. You have committed no crime and need feel no alarm.” The soldiers thanked him for his clemency with low obeisance. Then said Pang Tong, “If you will now show the way so that our troops may capture the Pass, you shall even be rewarded.” They consented. That same night the army set out, with the soldiers of the renegade escort leading the way. When they reached the Pass they hailed the gate, saying, “Open the gate quickly; the generals have returned earlier than they expected because of important business.” Hearing the voices of their comrades, the gate guards had no suspicion of treachery and threw open the gates. In rushed the enemy soldiers and so gained possession of River Fu Pass without shedding a drop of blood. The defenders came over to the side of Liu Bei and were liberally rewarded. This done, the army was posted so as to guard the approaches and maintain what they had captured. The next few days were spent in banquets and feasts in celebration of success. At one of these feasts, Liu Bei turned to his adviser, saying, “This is what one might call a joyful occasion.” “To employ warlike weapons in making an attack upon the possession of another is not using them in the best way,” replied Pang Tong. “Nor is such attack the most proper occasion for rejoicing.” Liu Bei replied, “The success of King Wu of Zhou was celebrated with music; I suppose weapons were not well used on that occasion either. Why do you talk so wide of reason? You would better retire.” Pang Tong laughed and withdrew from the table, while the attendants supported Liu Bei to his own chamber, where he had a long sleep. About midnight he awoke from his wine, and then the servants told him that he had driven sway his adviser from the feast. He was at once filled with remorse. Next day, having dressed early in full costume of ceremony, he took his seat in the great hall, summoned his adviser and apologized handsomely for his rude behavior the night before. “I drank too much last night and spoke rudely; pray forget it.” Pang Tong, who had taken the whole episode in very good part from the first, laughed and talked as usual. But Liu Bei went on, “Really I was the only one to blame yesterday.” “We both slipped up; it was not only you, my lord,” said Pang Tong. Then Liu Bei laughed too, and the two were as good friends again as ever."
却說魏延、姜維領兵到陳倉城下看時，並不見一面旗號，又無打更之人。二人驚疑，不敢攻城。忽聽得一聲礮響，四面旗幟齊豎。只見一人綸巾羽扇，鶴氅道袍，大叫曰：“汝二人來的遲了。”二人視之：乃孔明也。二人慌忙下馬，拜伏於地曰：“丞相眞神計也！”孔明令放入城，謂二人曰：“吾打探得郝昭病重，吾令汝三日內領兵取城，此乃穩衆人之心也。吾却令關興、張苞，只推點軍，暗出漢中。吾卽藏於軍中，星夜倍道逕到城下，使彼不能調兵。吾早有細作在城內放火、發喊相助，令魏兵驚疑不定。兵無主將，必自亂矣。吾因而取之，易如反掌。兵法云：‘出其不意，攻其無備。’正謂此也。”魏延、姜維拜伏。孔明憐郝昭之死，令彼妻小扶靈柩回魏，以表其忠。,"But they said that when Wei Yan and Jiang Wei led the troops to look under Chencang City, they didn't see a banner and no one to fight. The two were astonished and dared not attack the city. Suddenly there was a sound, and the four flags were erected. I saw a man wearing a turban and a feather fan, and a crane wearing a robe. He shouted, ""You two are late."" The two dismounted their horses in a hurry, bowed down on the ground, and said, ""The prime minister has a real plan!"" Kong Ming ordered him to put him in the city, and said to the two of them, ""I found out that Hao Zhao is seriously ill, and I ordered you to lead troops to take the city within three days. It is to stabilize the hearts of the people. But I ordered Guan Xing and Zhang Bao to push some troops and hide out of Hanzhong. I hid in the army, and went to the city under the starry night, so that they could not transfer troops. Setting fires in the city and shouting for help made Wei soldiers suspicious. Without a leader, the soldiers would be in chaos. So I took them, and it was as easy as the palm of my hand. Jiang Wei Bai Fu. Kong Ming took pity on Hao Zhao's death, and ordered his wife to support the coffin back to Wei to show her loyalty.","The defenders were so demoralized by the sickness of Hao Zhao that they put up little resistance, not least because pro-Shu men inside the city fired the city gates. During the mêlée that followed, and knowing the city has fallen and all hope is lost, Hao Zhao passes away on his sickbed. After the capture of Chencang, Kong Ming’s army go on to seize the San pass and thus prevent the Wei reinforcements reaching the city.","When Wei Yan and Jiang Wei reached the walls, they were perplexed to find no sign of life. No flags were flying and no watchmen struck the hours. They delayed their attack for a time. Then they heard a bomb, and suddenly the wall was thick with flags, and there appeared the well-known figure of the minister. “You have come too late,” cried Zhuge Liang. Both dropped out of the saddle and prostrated themselves. “Really, you are supernatural, O Minister!” they cried. They entered the city, and then he explained to them, saying, “I heard the news that Hao Zhao was seriously sick, so I sent you with the deadline of three days as a blind to calm the people of this city. Then I hid myself in the ranks of another force under Guan Xing and Zhang Bao, which came to Chencang by double marches. Also, I had sent spies into the city to start the fires and throw the defenders into confusion. An army without a leader could never fight, and I could take the city easily. This is an instance of the rule of war: 'Do the unexpected; attack the unprepared.'“ They bowed. In commiseration Zhuge Liang sent all the family of Hao Zhao, and his coffin, over to Wei, thus showing his sense of the dead man's loyalty."
孫權旣亡，諸葛恪立孫亮為帝，大赦天下，改元建興元年；諡權曰大皇帝，葬於蔣陵。早有細作探知其事，報入洛陽。司馬師聞孫權已死，遂議起兵伐吳。尚書傅嘏曰：“吳有長江之險，先帝屢次征伐，皆不遂意；不如各守邊疆，乃為上策。”師曰：“天道三十年一變，豈得常為鼎峙乎？吾欲伐吳。”昭曰：“今孫權新亡，孫亮幼懦，其隙正可乘也。”遂令征南大將軍王昶引兵十萬攻南郡；，征東將軍胡遵引兵十萬攻東興，鎮南都督毋丘儉引兵十萬攻武昌：三路進發。又遣弟司馬昭為大都督，總領三路軍馬。是年冬十二月，司馬昭兵至東吳邊界，屯住人馬，喚王昶、胡遵、毋丘儉到帳中計議曰：“東吳最緊要處，惟東興郡也。今他築起大堤，左右又築兩城，以防巢湖後面攻擊，諸公須要仔細。”遂令王昶、毋丘儉各引一萬兵，列在左右：“且勿進發；待取了東興郡，那時一齊進兵。”昶、儉二人受令而去。昭又令胡遵為先鋒，總領三路兵前去：“先搭浮橋，取東興大堤；若奪得左右二城，便是大功。”遵領兵來搭浮橋。,"After Sun Quan's death, Zhuge Ke made Sun Liang emperor, granted amnesty to the world, and changed it to the first year of Jianxing in the Yuan Dynasty. He had already made a detailed investigation to find out what happened, and reported to Luoyang. When Sima Shi heard that Sun Quan was dead, he proposed to attack Wu. Shangshu Fu Hao said: ""Wu has the danger of the Yangtze River, and the previous emperor's many expeditions were unsuccessful. It is better to guard the frontiers. It is the best policy."" Attack Wu."" Zhao said: ""Today Sun Quan is newly killed, Sun Liang is young and cowardly, and the gap can be taken advantage of."" Wang Chang, the general of the southern army, led 100,000 troops to attack Nanjun; Hu Zun, the general of the army of the east, led 100,000 troops To attack Dongxing, the governor of Zhennan, Guanqiujian, led 100,000 troops to attack Wuchang: three routes. He also sent his younger brother Sima Zhao to be the commander-in-chief of the three-way army. In the twelfth month of the winter, Sima Zhao's troops went to the border of Eastern Wu, where they settled their troops and called Wang Chang, Hu Zun, and Wuqiujian to the tent for a discussion, saying: ""The most important place in Eastern Wu is Dongxing County. Raise the embankment and build two cities on the left and right to prevent Chaohu from attacking from behind, so you need to be careful."" Wang Chang and Wuqiujian were ordered to each draw 10,000 soldiers and lined them up on the left and right: ""Don't go ahead; At that time, we will march together."" Chang and Jian were ordered to leave. Zhao also ordered Hu Zun to be the vanguard, and led three soldiers to go: ""Build a pontoon first, and take the Dongxing Embankment; if you win the two cities on the left and right, it will be a great achievement."" Zun led the soldiers to build the pontoon.","By now most of the great men of the kingdom – Lu Xun, Zhuge Jin and others – have died. It is Zhuge Jin’s son, Zhuge Ke, who now holds power and enthrones the heir apparent Sun Liang as emperor. But Zhuge Ke is a foolish and ambitious man. Soon he has taken control of the whole court and country and is living a life of extravagance. Using his power, he has any who oppose him killed and brings a chill of fear over the whole land. News of the death of Sun Quan inspires in Sima Shi a desire to invade Wu. Despite being advised that this would be a foolish move, he insists. He marches south, and in response Zhuge Ke goes north to the border. The Wu troops, through various plots and schemes, inflict terrible losses on the Wei army, forcing them to retreat.","Zhuge Ke immediately placed his late lord's son Sun Liang on the throne, and the opening of the new reign was marked by the adoption of the style Great Prosperity, the first year. A general amnesty was proclaimed. The late ruler received the posthumous style of Sun Quan the Great Emperor and was buried in Jiangling. When these things were reported in the Wei capital, Sima Shi's first thought was to attack the South Land. But his plans were opposed by First Secretary Fu Gu, saying, “Remember what a strong defense to Wu is the Great River. The country has been many times attacked by our ancestors, but never conquered. Rather let us all hold what we have till the time be expedient to possess the whole empire.” Sima Shi replied, “The way of Heaven changes thrice in a century, and no three-part division is permanent. I wish to attack Wu.” Sima Zhao, his brother, was in favor of attack, saying “The occasion is most opportune. Sun Quan is newly dead, and the present ruler is a child.” An expedition was decided upon. Wang Chang, General Who Conquers the South, was sent with one hundred thousand troops against Nanjun. Guanqiu Jian, General Who Guards the South, was given one hundred thousand troops to go against Wuchang. Hu Zun, General Who Conquers the East, led one hundred thousand troops against Dongxing. They marched in three divisions. Sima Zhao was made Commander-in-Chief of the campaign. In the winter of that year, the tenth month, Sima Zhao marched the armies near to the Wu frontiers and camped. Sima Zhao called together Wang Chang, Guanqiu Jian, Hu Zun, and various other commanders to decide upon plans. He said, “The county of Dongxing is most important to Wu. They have built a great rampart, with walls right and left to defend Lake Chaohu from an attack in the rear. You gentlemen will have to exercise extreme care.” Then he bade Wang Chang and Guanqiu Jian each to take ten thousand troops and place themselves right and left, but not to advance till Dongxing had been captured. When that city had fallen, these two were to go forward at the same time. Hu Zun was to lead the van. The first step was to construct a floating bridge to storm the rampart. The two walls should then be captured."
魏左將軍郭淮聞報，飛奏洛陽。司馬師問諸將曰：“誰敢去敵蜀兵？”輔國將軍徐質曰：“某願往。”師昔知徐質英勇過人，心中大喜，卽令徐質為先鋒，令司馬昭為大都督，領兵望隴西進發。軍至董亭，正遇姜維，兩軍列成陣勢。徐質使開山大斧，出馬挑戰。蜀陣中廖化出迎。戰不數合，化拖刀敗回，張翼縱馬挺鎗而迎；戰不數合，又敗入陣。徐質驅兵掩殺，蜀兵大敗，退三十餘里。司馬昭亦收兵回，各自下寨。,"Wei Zuo general Guo Huai heard the news and flew to Luoyang. Sima Shi asked the generals, ""Who dares to go to the enemy's army?"" General Xu Zhi said, ""I would like to go."" The teacher knew Xu Zhi's bravery and brilliance in the past, and he was overjoyed, so he ordered Xu Zhi to be the vanguard, and ordered Sima Zhao was the commander-in-chief, leading troops to look forward to Longxi. When the army reached Dongting, they were meeting Jiang Wei, and the two armies formed a formation. Xu Zhi made a big axe and went out to challenge. In the Shu formation, Liao Hua came out to greet him. After a few close battles, Hua Tuo Dao was defeated, and Zhang Yi faced him with his horse and spear; Xu Zhi drove his troops to cover up the attack, and the Shu troops were defeated and retreated more than thirty li. Sima Zhao also withdrew his troops and went down to their respective villages.","In response Sima Shi sends Xu Zhi to lead the Wei army, renowned as he is for his valour.","When Guo Huai heard of the threatened attack, he sent a hasty memorial to Luoyang. Sima Shi at once asked his leaders, “Who will go out to meet the army from the west?” Xu Zhi volunteered, and as Sima Shi had a high opinion of his capacity, he appointed Xu Zhi as Leader of the Van. The brother of the Prime Minister, Sima Zhao, went as Commander-in-Chief. The Wei army set out for Xizhou, reached Dongting and there fell in with Jiang Wei. When both sides were arrayed Xu Zhi, who wielded a mighty splitter-of-mountains ax as his weapon, rode out and challenged. Liao Hua went forth to accept, but after a few bouts he took advantage of a feint and fled. Then Zhang Yi set his spear and rode forth to continue the fight. He also soon fled and returned within his own ranks. Thereupon Xu Zhi gave the signal to fall on in force, and the army of Shu lost the day. They retired ten miles, Sima Zhao also drew off his troops, and both sides encamped."
後主覽表曰：“相父南征，遠涉艱難；方始回都，坐未安席；今又欲北征，恐勞神思。”孔明曰：“臣受先帝託孤之重，夙夜未嘗有怠；今南方已平，可無內顧之憂；不就此時討賊，恢復中原，更待何日？”忽班部中太史譙周出奏曰：“臣夜觀天象，北方旺氣正盛，星曜倍明，未可圖也。”乃謂孔明曰：“丞相深明天文，何故強為？”孔明曰：“天道變易不常，豈可拘執？吾今且駐軍馬於漢中，觀其動靜而後行。”譙周苦諫不從。於是孔明乃留郭攸之、董允、費褘等為侍中，總攝宮中之事。又留向寵為大將，總督御林軍馬，蔣琬為參軍；張裔為長史，掌丞相府事；杜瓊為諫議大夫；杜微、楊洪為尚書；孟光、來敏為祭酒；尹默、李譔為博士；郤正、費詩為祕書；譙周為太史：內外文武官僚一百餘員，同理蜀中之事。,"The later master looked at the table and said: ""Xianfu's expedition to the south, it is difficult to travel far away; when I first returned to the capital, I did not have a seat; now I want to expedition north, I am afraid to worry about it."" Kong Ming said: ""This subject is entrusted by the late emperor. Laziness; today the south is at peace, so there is no need to worry about it; if we don’t fight thieves at this time and restore the Central Plains, how long will we wait?” The middle Taishi Qiao Zhou of the Kuban Department made a remark: “I watch the sky at night, and the north is full of vitality. Sheng, the stars are brighter and brighter, and there is no picture.” It was said to Kong Ming: “The prime minister has a deep understanding of the language of the future, why is he strong?” Kong Ming said: “The way of heaven is not always changing, how can it be restrained? It moves after it moves."" Qiao Zhou bitterly remonstrated. Therefore, Kong Ming left Guo Youzhi, Dong Yun, Fei Bang and others as his attendants to take charge of the affairs in the palace. He also left Xiang Chong as a general, the governor-general of the imperial army and horses, and Jiang Wan as an army officer; Zhang Yi as the chief historian and in charge of the prime minister's office; Du Qiong as a remonstrance doctor; Du Wei and Yang Hong as ministers; Meng Guang and Laimin as sacrifices Wine; Yin Mo and Li Zhuan as doctors; Que Zheng and Fei Shi as secretaries; Qiao Zhou as Taishi: more than 100 civil and military bureaucrats, both inside and outside the country, who are also responsible for affairs in Shu.","Despite Kong Ming’s best efforts to dissuade the old general, Zhao Zilong insists and wins the right to be in the vanguard. One of the officers, Deng Zhi, offers to help Zhao Zilong, and Kong Ming appoints five thousand of the best troops and ten officers to assist and to protect the old warrior.","The Emperor read it through and said, “My Father-Minister, you have only just returned from a distant and fatiguing expedition against the Southern Mangs; you are not yet refreshed, and I fear this march to the north will be almost too much even for you.” Zhuge Liang replied, “The heaviest responsibility lies upon me, the well-being of Your Majesty confided to me by the First Ruler. My efforts may not be relaxed night or day. The south is at rest, at home is no anxiety; what better time could be hoped for to destroy the rebels and recover the capital?” Forth from the ranks of courtiers stood Minister Qiao Zhou and said, “I have studied the aspect of the stars; the northern quarter is brilliant and strong. The scheme will not speed.” Then turning toward the Prime Minister, he continued, “You, O Minister, understand the mysteries of the skies; why do you oppose the stars?” “Because the stars are in infinite changes,” replied Zhuge Liang. “One may rely on the stars too much. Moreover, I have already sent the army into Hanzhong, where I shall act as soon as I have studied what is afoot.” Qiao Zhou pleaded in vain; Zhuge Liang was too strongly set upon his purpose to yield. So Guo Youzhi, Dong Yun, and Fei Yi were ordered to attend to matters in the palace; Xiang Chong was to control all military affairs and forces; Jiang Wan was made Military Adviser; Chen Zhen became Chair of the Secretariat; Zhang Yi, Controller of the Prime Minister's palace; Du Qiong, Imperial Censor; Du Wei and Yang Hong, Ministers; Meng Guang and Lai Min, Libationers; Yin Mo and Li Zhuan, Academicians; Xi Zheng and Fei Shi, General Secretaries; Qiao Zhou, Imperial Recorder; and others to the number of over a hundred, all to manage the administration of Shu in the absence of Zhuge Liang."
却說張飛聞馬超攻關，大叫而入曰：“辭了哥哥，便去戰馬超也！”孔明佯作不聞，對玄德曰：“今馬超侵犯關隘，無人可敵；除非往荊州取關雲長來，方可與敵。”張飛曰：“軍師何故小覷吾？吾曾獨拒曹操百萬之兵，豈愁馬超一匹夫乎？”孔明曰：“翼德拒水斷橋，此因曹操不知虛實耳。若知虛實，將軍豈得無事？今馬超之勇，天下皆知。渭橋六戰，殺得曹操割鬚棄袍，幾乎喪命，非等閒之比。雲長且未必可勝。”飛曰：“我只今便去；如勝不得馬超，甘當軍令！”孔明曰：“卽爾肯寫文書，便為先鋒。請主公親自去一遭。留亮守綿竹。待子龍來，却作商議。”魏延曰：“某亦願往。”孔明令魏延帶五百哨馬先行，張飛第二，玄德後隊，望葭萌關進發。魏延哨馬先到關下，正遇楊柏。魏延與楊柏交戰，不十合，楊柏敗走。魏延要奪張飛頭功，乘勢趕去，前面一軍擺開，為首乃是馬岱。魏延只道是馬超，舞刀躍馬迎之。與馬岱戰不十合，岱敗走。延趕去，被岱回身一箭，中了魏延左臂。延急回馬走。馬岱趕到關前，只見一將喊聲如雷，從關上飛奔至面前。原來是張飛初到關上，聽得關前廝殺，便來看時，正見魏延中箭，因驟馬下關，救了魏延。飛喝馬岱曰：“汝是何人！先通姓名，然後廝殺！”馬岱曰：“吾乃西涼馬岱是也。”張飛曰：“你原來不是馬超！快回去！非吾對手！只令馬超那廝自來！說道燕人張飛在此！”馬岱大怒曰：“汝焉敢小覷我！”挺鎗躍馬，直取張飛。戰不十合，馬岱敗走。張飛欲待追趕，關上一騎馬到來，叫：“兄弟且休去！”飛回視之，原來是玄德到來。飛遂不趕，一同上關。玄德曰：“恐怕你性躁，故我隨後趕來到此。旣然勝了馬岱，且歇一宵，來日戰馬超。”,"However, Zhang Fei heard that Ma Chao had attacked the pass, and shouted and entered: ""I have resigned my brother, and I will go to fight Ma Chao!"" Kong Ming pretended not to hear it, and said to Xuande: ""Today, Ma Chao has invaded the pass, and no one can beat him; unless you go to Jingzhou to get it When Guan Yun has come, he can fight the enemy."" Zhang Fei said, ""Why did the strategist underestimate me? I once rejected Cao Cao's millions of soldiers, so why should I worry about the horse surpassing one husband?"" Kong Ming said, ""Yide refused to water and break the bridge. Cao Cao doesn't know the truth. If you know the truth, how can the general be okay? Today, Ma Chao's bravery is known to the whole world. In the six battles at Weiqiao, Cao Cao was killed, and he almost lost his life. Fei said: ""I will only go now; if I can't win Ma Chao, I am willing to be the military commander!"" Kong Ming said: ""If you are willing to write documents, you will be the vanguard. Please go there personally. Stay Liang and guard Mianzhu. Wait for Zilong. Come here, but discuss it."" Wei Yan said, ""Someone is willing to go."" Kong Ming ordered Wei Yan to lead five hundred sentry horses first, Zhang Fei second, and Xuande's rear team, looking forward to Jiameng Pass. Wei Yan sent his horse to the gate first and was meeting Yang Bo. Wei Yan and Yang Bo fought, and Yang Bo was defeated. Wei Yan wanted to take Zhang Fei's head, and hurried to take advantage of the momentum, and the army in front was spread out, led by Ma Dai. Wei Yan only knew that it was Ma Chao, and danced with a knife to welcome him. The battle with Ma Dai was inconsistent, and Dai was defeated. Yan rushed to Wei Yan's left arm. Hurry back to the horse. Ma Dai rushed to the front of the gate, and saw a general shouting like thunder, flying from the gate to the front. It turned out that it was Zhang Fei who first arrived at Guanshang. He heard the fight in front of Guanshang, and when he came to see it, he saw Wei Yan hit the arrow. Fei called Ma Dai and said, ""Who are you! Know your name first, then fight!"" Ma Dai said: ""I am Xiliang Ma Dai."" Zhang Fei said: ""You are not Ma Chao! Go back! Not my opponent! Only let Ma Chao's servant come! Said that Zhang Fei from Yan is here!"" Ma Dai said furiously, ""How dare you underestimate me!"" When the battle was not tenable, Ma Dai was defeated. Zhang Fei was about to catch up, but Guan Yi came on a horse and called out, ""Brother, let's go!"" Fei looked back at him, and it turned out that Xuande was coming. Fei Sui did not rush, and went to the customs together. Xuande said: ""I'm afraid you are impatient, so I came here later. I won the victory over Ma Dai, let's rest overnight, and fight Ma Chao in the next day.""","Kong Ming acts as if Zhang Fei is not there and says, ‘Ma Chao is attacking the pass, but I cannot think who could possibly take him on, except perhaps Guan Yu.’ ‘Excuse me,’ says a cross Zhang Fei, ‘do I count for nothing? I’ve defeated armies of one million – what’s this Ma Chao to me!’ ‘You haven’t always been that wise, and Ma Chao is renowned for his courage. Remember how Cao Cao had to cut his beard and try to disguise himself in order to escape Ma Chao. I’m not sure even Guan Yu could defeat him.’ ‘I will!’ roars Zhang Fei. ‘And should I fail, which I very much doubt, I’ll take my punishment as martial law demands.’ ‘Well, so long as you are willing to take that vow, then you may lead,’ says a smug Kong Ming. Shortly after, Wei Yan is sent ahead with a small troop, with Zhang Fei behind and, following close behind him, Xuande. The battles are fierce – Wei Yan fights Yang Bo; then Ma Dai, Ma Chao’s brother, wounds Wei Yan with an arrow and speeds after him; until Zhang Fei turns up and takes on Ma Dai, thinking it is Ma Chao himself; until he is restrained by Xuande. Chaos all round! The next day Ma Chao challenges Zhang Fei to single combat, but Xuande initially refuses to allow him to go.","But as soon as Zhang Fei heard of the danger, he came rushing in, shouting, “I must say farewell, Brother! I am off to fight Ma Chao.” However, Zhuge Liang made as if he heard not and said to Liu Bei, “That Ma Chao has invaded Jiameng Pass, and we have no one to drive him back. Nobody can stand up to him, unless we can get Guan Yu from Jingzhou. Guan Yu could do it.” “Why do you despise me, O Instructor?” cried Zhang Fei. “Did I not once drive back a whole army with my mere voice? Think you that I mind a stupid fool like Ma Chao?” Zhuge Liang said, “Yes, Zhang Fei; but when you forced back the waters and broke the bridge in the Long Slope, you succeeded because your enemies were doubtful. If they had known, General, you would not have come off so easily. All the world knows this Ma Chao and has heard about his six battles at River Wei; and how he made Cao Cao cut off his beard and throw away his robe. Ma Chao very nearly slew Cao Cao too. This is no lightsome task like that, and even Guan Yu might fail.” “All I care for is to go, and if I do not overcome this fellow, I will take the consequences.” “Well, if you will put that in writing, you may lead the attack. And I will ask our lord to lead another army to back you up this time. He can leave the defense of this town to me till Zhao Yun returns.” “I also want to go,” said Wei Yan. Wei Yan was allowed to go with five hundred of light horse in advance of Zhang Fei. Liu Bei marched third. Wei Yan and his scouts soon arrived at Jiameng Pass and there fell in with Yang Bo. They engaged; but after a few bouts Yang Bo fled. At this success Wei Yan was seized with ambition to rival it and try to snatch the credit that would fall to Zhang Fei. So he pursued. But he presently came across a line of battle all drawn up, the commander being Ma Dai. Wei Yan, thinking it was the redoubtable Ma Chao, rode toward him whirling his sword. Soon Ma Dai turned and ran away, and Wei Yan followed him. However, Ma Dai presently turned back and shot an arrow, which wounded Wei Yan in the left arm, so that he left the pursuit and turned his face the other way. Then Ma Dai came after him and chased Wei Yan nearly up to the Pass. Here Ma Dai was suddenly confronted by a fierce thunder-roaring leader who dashed down from the Pass as on a flying steed. It was Zhang Fei, who had just arrived. Hearing the noise of battle below the Pass, Zhang Fei had come to learn what it meant and saw the arrow wound Wei Yan. Soon Zhang Fei was in the saddle and off to the rescue; but before he engaged, he would ascertain if the foe was worthy of his steel. “Who are you? Tell your name,” cried Zhang Fei, “then I may fight with you.” “I am Ma Dai of Xiliang.” “As you are not Ma Chao, go away quickly, for you are no match for me. You may bid Ma Chao himself come, and tell him that Zhang Fei of Yan is here.” “How dare you treat me with contempt?” cried Ma Dai in hot anger, and he came galloping up with his spear set ready to thrust. But after a half score bouts he fled. Zhang Fei was about to pursue when a rider came up to him hastily, crying, “Do not pursue, my brother.” The rider was Liu Bei and Zhang Fei stopped. The two returned together to the Pass. “I knew your impulsive temper, and so I followed you. Since you have got the better of him, you may well rest and recuperate for the fight tomorrow with Ma Chao.”"
却說曹眞與司馬懿商議曰：“今連陰三十日，軍無戰心，各有思歸之意，如何禁止？”懿曰：“不如且回。”眞曰：“倘孔明追來，怎生退之？”懿曰：“先伏兩軍斷後，方可回兵。”正議間，忽使命來召。二人遂將大軍前隊作後隊，後隊作前隊，徐徐而退。,"But he said that Cao Zhen discussed with Sima Yi and said, ""Today, on the 30th day of Lianyin, the army has no intention to fight, and everyone has the intention of returning. How can we prohibit it?"" Yi said, ""It's better to go back."" , how can you retreat?"" Yi said, ""The two armies are cut off first, and then you can return to the army."" During the discussion, suddenly the mission came to call. The two then made the front team of the army the rear team and the rear team as the front team, and slowly retreated.","When an imperial command comes telling them to abandon the attempt and return home, everyone is delighted but also aware of the risks of a counter-attack by Shu.","Cao Zhen had said, “We have had rain for a whole month, and the soldiers are downhearted and think only of getting home again. How can we stop them?” Sima Yi replied, “Return is best.” “If Zhuge Liang pursue, how shall we repulse him?” “We can leave an ambush.” While they were discussing this matter, the Emperor's command arrived. Whereupon they faced about and marched homeward."

Shi Huan's name was the Son of Heaven, but he couldn't stand for it, and the government was governed by the Sima family. Zhao's wife is Wang Su's daughter, and they have two sons: the first is Sima Yan, who is tall and burly, standing on the ground, his hands are over his knees, smart, valiant, and courageous; the second is Sima You, who is mild-mannered, courteous, frugal and filial, and Zhao loves him very much. Since Sima Shi had no son, Si You succeeded him. Zhao Chang said: ""The world is the world of my brother."" So Sima Zhao was conferred the title of King of Jin, and wanted to make You the heir. Shan Tao admonished: ""It is ominous to abolish the elders and establish the younger ones."" Jia Chong, He Zeng, and Pei Xiu also admonished: ""The eldest son is smart and talented, and has extraordinary talents; It is also the prime minister."" Zhao hesitated, but the captains Wang Xiang and Sikong Xunyi admonished him, ""In the previous generation, there was a lot of chaotic affairs. I hope your highness thinks about it."" Zhao then made his eldest son, Sima Yan, the prince.","And Sima Zhao, realizing the man is basically a simpleton, also appreciates he has nothing to fear from him. In recognition of his victories and the collapse of Shu, courtiers petition Cao Huan to make Sima Zhao a king in his own right as a reward. Unable to say no, the Son of Heaven ennobles Sima Zhao as the king of Jin.","The courtiers thought that so grand an exploit as the conquest of the west was worthy of high honor, so they memorialized the Ruler of Wei, Cao Huang, to confer the rank Prince of Jin on Sima Zhao. At that time, Cao Huang ruled in name only, for he had no authority. The whole land was under Sima Zhao, whose will the Emperor himself dared not cross. And so, in due course, the Duke of Jin became Prince of Jin. After being made Prince of Jin, Sima Zhao posthumously created his father, Sima Yi, the Original Prince and his late elder brother, Sima Shi, the Wonderful Prince. The wife of Sima Zhao was the daughter of Wang Su. She bore to him two sons, the elder of whom was named Sima Yan. Sima Yan was huge of frame, his flowing hair reached to the ground when he stood up, and both hands hung down below his knees. He was clever, brave, and skilled in the use of arms. The second son, Sima You, was mild of disposition, a filial son and a dutiful brother. His father loved him dearly. As Sima Shi had died without leaving sons, this youth, Sima You, was regarded as his son, to continue that line of the family. Sima Zhao used to say: “The empire was really my brother's.” Becoming a prince, it was necessary for Sima Zhao to choose his heir, and he wished to name his younger son Sima You. But Shan Tao remonstrated. “It is improper and infelicitous to prefer the younger,” said Shan Tao. And Jia Chong, He Zeng, and Pei Xiu followed in the same strain. “The elder is clever, able in war, one of the most talented people in the state and popular. With such natural advantages he has a great destiny; and was not born to serve.” Sima Zhao hesitated, for he was still unwilling to abandon his desire. But two other officers—Grand Commander Wang Xiang and Minister Xun Kai—also remonstrated, saying, “Certain former dynasties have preferred the younger before the elder and rebellion has generally followed. We pray you reflect upon these cases.” Finally Sima Zhao yielded and named his elder son Sima Yan as his successor."

Chaoqian stepped into Han Sui’s tent, and saw the five generals and Han Sui secretly speaking, only to hear Yang Qiu say, “It’s not too late, you can do it quickly!” Chao Chao was furious, swung his sword straight in, and shouted, “A group of thieves. How dare you murder me!"" Everyone was shocked. Chao Yijian looked at Han Sui and slashed towards the door, so he panicked and greeted him, his left hand was chopped off long ago. The five generals waved their knives in unison. Chao Zong stepped out of the tent, and the five generals slaughtered around them. Super single wielding the sword, rivaling the five generals. At the bright spot of the sword, blood splattered: he chopped over the horse to play, slayed Liang Xing, and the three generals escaped each other. When Chaofu entered the tent to kill Han Sui, he was rescued by the left and right. A fire broke out behind the tent, and the soldiers of the villages moved. Super hurried on the horse. Pang De and Ma Dai also came and fought each other. When Chao led the army out, he had four troops: Xu Chu in the front, Xu Huang in the back, Xiahou Yuan on the left, and Cao Hong on the right. Soldiers of Xiliang kill themselves. Chao did not see Pang De and Ma Dai, so he led more than a hundred cavalry and stopped on the Wei Bridge. The sky was twilight, and I saw Li Kanyin's army passing under the bridge, chasing after him with super guns. Li Kan dragged his gun away. It happened that Yu Jin came from behind Ma Chao, and Jin opened his bow to shoot Ma Chao. Chao heard the sound of the strings behind him, and flashed quickly, but he shot Li Kan in front and fell to his death. Super return to Malay to kill in the ban. The forbidden horse is gone. Chao returned to the bridge to live on the bridge, and the troops were large before and after, and the Tiger Guards took the lead, shooting Ma Chao with random arrows. Chao plucked it with a gun, and all the arrows fell to the ground. Super order from the ride to and from the sudden kill. Zheng Nai Cao's soldiers were surrounded by a strong and thick siege, and they could not rush out. Chaoyu shouted from the bridge and rushed into Hebei, where he was cut off from the cavalry. Chao Du clashed in the formation, but was shot down by a dark crossbow and sat down. Ma Chao fell to the ground, and the army was forced to close. In the midst of a critical situation, suddenly a Biao army came in from the northwest corner, including Pang De and Ma Dai. The two rescued Ma Chao, and the war horse and Ma Chao rode in the general, turned over to kill a bloody road, and walked northwest. When Cao Cao heard that Ma Chao had escaped, he sent orders to the generals: ""There is no difference in the morning and night, so be sure to rush to Ma'er. If you get the head, you will be rewarded with thousands of gold, and you will be the marquis of ten thousand households. Those who are born and won will be named generals."" , chasing after him. Ma Chao didn't care about the tiredness of the people and horses, and only cared about running. Gradually all disperse from riding. If the infantry could not get up, most were captured. When there were more than thirty cavalry left, they went with Pang De and Ma Dai to look at Lintao in the west of Longxi.","However, Ma Chao already knows of their plot and the secret deal and with faithful men such as Pang De and Ma Dai he strides off to confront Han Sui. Quietly entering Han Sui’s tent, he finds all the conspirators together. Roaring with anger, he launches himself at the men, cutting off Han Sui ’s hand when he raises it to protect himself. The fight spills out of the tent. Ma Chao cuts down two of the conspirators, while the other three flee. Returning to finish off Han Sui, he is thwarted because attendants have pulled Han Sui away to safety. Now Cao Cao’s men rush to the attack, and chaos prevails, with discord among Ma Chao’s own men as well as the attack by Cao Cao’s troops. Realizing the dangers, Ma Chao takes up a defensive position to guard the Wei bridge with a small troop of loyal men. Arrows rain down on him, and he survives, but despite brave attempts to charge forward, the sheer number of Cao’s men forces him back. With no other option, Ma Chao turns and charges off to the north, leaving his men to their fate. But even this does not work, for a crossbow shot kills his horse, and the enemy troops close in for the kill. Suddenly, as if from nowhere, Pang De and Ma Dai thunder to the rescue, catching Cao’s men off guard and scattering them. Soon they race off, with Ma Chao mounted now on another horse. Cao Cao gives orders that every possible effort is made to catch him and offers a huge reward to whomsoever does that. Ma Chao rides like the devil, and soon only a handful of his men are still with him – Pang De and Ma Dai among them. They ride pell-mell to sanctuary in Lintao.","All this was done, but not without some hesitation and delay, and some news of the plot reached Ma Chao. He found out the careful preparations that had been made and resolved to act first. Leaving Ma Dai and Pang De in reserve, he chose a few trusted leaders and with stealthy steps made his way into Han Sui's tent. There he found Han Sui and his five confederates deep in conversation. He just caught a word or two that Yang Qiu said, “We must not delay, now is the time.” In burst Ma Chao raging and yelling, “You herd of rebels! Would you dare to plot against me?” They were taken aback. Ma Chao sprang at Han Sui and slashed at his face. Han Sui put up his hand to ward off the blow, and it was cut off. The five drew their swords and set on Ma Chao and his men who rushed outside. Soon Ma Chao was hemmed in by the five, but he kept them at bay by wonderful swordsmanship. And as the swords flashed, the red blood flowed. Soon Ma Wan was down and Liang Xing disabled; then the other three fled. Ma Chao ran back into the tent to finish Han Sui, but the servants had removed him. Then a torch was lit, and soon there was commotion all through the camp. Ma Chao mounted his horse, for Pang De and Ma Dai had now arrived, and the real fight began. Cao Cao's troops poured in from all sides, and the Xiliang soldiers fought with each other. Losing sight of his companions, Ma Chao and a few of his followers got to the head of the floating bridge over the River Wei just about dawn. There he fell across Li Kan coming over the bridge. Ma Chao set his spear and rode at him full tilt. Li Kan let go his spear and fled. Lucky for him, it seemed at first that Yu Jin came up in pursuit. But unable to get near enough to seize Ma Chao, Yu Jin sent an arrow flying after him. Ma Chao's ear caught the twang of the bowstring, and he dodged the arrow, which flew on and killed Li Kan. Ma Chao turned to attack his pursuer, who galloped away, and then he returned and took possession of the bridge. Quickly Cao Cao's troops gathered about him, and the fiercest among them, the Tiger Guards, shot arrows at Ma Chao, which he warded off with his spear shaft so that they fell harmless to the earth. Ma Chao and his troops rode to and fro striking a blow wherever there was a chance, but the enemy were very thick about him, and he could not force his way out. In desperation he cut an arterial alley northwards and got through, but quite alone. Of his followers everyone fell. Still he kept on dashing this way and that, till he was brought down by a crossbow bolt. He lay upon the ground and his enemies were pressing in. But at the critical moment, an army came in from the northwest and rescued him. Pang De and Ma Dai had come up in the very nick of time. Thus Ma Chao was rescued, and they set him on one of the soldiers' horses, and he again took up the battle. Leaving a trail of blood in his rear, he got away northwest. Hearing that his enemy had got away, Cao Cao gave order to his generals, “Pursue him day and night, and rich rewards are for him dead or alive. For his head the rewards are a thousand ounces of gold and the lordship of a fief of ten thousand families. If any one captures Ma Chao, the reward is the rank of general.” Consequently the pursuit was hot as every one was anxious to win renown and reward. Meanwhile careless of all but flight, Ma Chao galloped on, and one by one his followers dropped by the way. The footmen who were unable to keep up were captured till very few remained, and only some scores of riders were left. They traveled toward Lintao, a city in Longxi."

Just as he was talking, suddenly Meteor Horse reported that Chen Shi was broken. There were more than 4,000 people, only 400 or 500 with wounded people and horses, and they were stationed in the valley. Kong Ming ordered Deng Zhi to come back to Jigu to comfort Chen Shi and prevent him from changing. On the one hand, he called Ma Dai and Wang Ping and said, ""If there are Wei soldiers guarding the Xiegu, the two of you will lead the army across the mountains, travel by night and day, and leave quickly. On the left side of the mountain of prayer, hold the fire as the horn.” He called Ma Zhong and Zhang Yi to pay the bills and said, “You, too, will walk from the mountain on the side road, day and night, and walk out of the right side of the mountain of prayer, hold the fire as the horn, and join Ma Dai and the king. Let’s meet at peace and rob Cao Zhen’s camp together. Since I attacked it from three sides in the valley, the Wei troops can be broken.” Kong Ming also called Guan Xing and Liao Hua to pay and said: This is so. The two received a secret plan and led their troops away. Kong Ming led his elite soldiers to go the same way. In the middle of the line, he called Wu Ban and Wu Yi to teach him a secret plan, and he also led his troops to advance.","Deng Zhi, adviser to Kong Ming, argues that Kong Ming is always right, only to have Chen Shi say, ‘So how come he lost at Jieting if he’s so brilliant?’ Refusing to be curbed, Chen Shi breaks off with five thousand men and, passing through the hills, he prepares for battle. But he hasn’t gone far when suddenly he is attacked. He tries to force his way back, only to find the path blocked by Wei troops. When at last he is able to retreat into the pass, he has only four or five hundred men left alive, and all of them are wounded.","When Deng Zhi told his chief of the bad behavior of Chen Shi and Wei Yan, Zhuge Liang only laughed. Said he, “That fellow Wei Yan has never been quite true; he has always been disposed to disobey and is unsteady. However, he is valiant, and so I have saved him for our use, but he will do real harm some day.” Then came a messenger with news of Chen Shi's defeat and loss of troops. Zhuge Liang sent Deng Zhi back again to Chi Valley to console with Chen Shi and so keep him from actual mutiny. Then Zhuge Liang called to his tent Ma Dai and Wang Ping, and said, “If there are any troops of Wei in the Xie Valley, you are to go across the mountains, marching by night and concealing yourselves by day, and make for the east of Qishan. When you arrive, make a fire as a signal.” Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni were told to go in similar fashion to the west of Qishan and join up with the other two. Then they were to make a joint attack on Cao Zhen's camp. Zhuge Liang would also attack in the center. Guan Xing and Liao Hua also received secret orders. The armies marched rapidly. Not long after starting, two other detachments led by Wu Ban and Wu Yi received secret orders and left the main body."

Deng Ai was still in the mansion. Gan led dozens of people into the room and shouted, ""Accept Deng Ai and his son!"" Ai was shocked and got out of bed. The kung fu samurai was tied to the cart. When his son Deng Zhong asked, he was also caught and tied to the car. The generals in the mansion were startled, and they were about to snatch it, but when they saw the dust rise, the sentinel reported that Zhong Situ's army had arrived. Everyone was running around. Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei dismounted and entered the mansion, and saw that Deng Ai and his son had been bound. He would lash out at Deng Ai's leader, saying, ""How dare you raise a calf!"" Jiang Wei also scolded: ""Is there a day when an ordinary husband is in danger?"" Ai also cursed. Will send Ai and his son to Luoyang. When he entered Chengdu, he was able to get Deng Ai's military horses, and his prestige was shocking. He asked Jiang Wei to say: ""Today I am taking advantage of my life's wish."" Wei said: ""In the past, Han Xin did not listen to Kuaitong's words, and he was in trouble at the Weiyang Palace; the doctor did not follow Fan Li in Wuhu, and died under his sword. Death: Isn't the fame of the two sons impressive? The benefits and harms are not clear, so it's too early to see how many times. Now that the Duke of Daxun has arrived, and his master has been shaken, why not go on a boat and climb the mountain of Emei, and follow Chisongzi travel?"" Hui laughed and said, ""Your words are bad: I'm not in my forties, and I'm just thinking about making progress, how can I do the same thing?"" Wei said, ""If you don't retire, you should plan a good plan early. This shows that Duke Ming's intelligence is capable, and I don't bother with the old man's words."" Hui held his palms and laughed and said, ""Boyue knows my heart."" Since then, the two have discussed important matters every day. Wei Mi wrote to the postmaster: ""I hope Your Majesty will endure the humiliation for a few days, and Wei will make the Sheji endangered and restore peace, and the sun and moon will be quiet and bright again - the Han Dynasty will not be destroyed.""","Only then does he set out with two prison wagons for Chengdu. Upon arrival, all of Deng Ai ’s officers take up the offer and kowtow to Wen Guan at the break of the following day. Emboldened, Wen Guan breaks into Deng Ai’s quarters while he is still asleep and arrests him and his son. Almost immediately Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei arrive on the scene. They mercilessly beat Deng Ai, shouting abuse at him. But Deng Ai replies with equal venom. Once Deng Ai and son are en route as prisoners to Luoyang, Zhong Hui conscripts all Deng Ai’s men into his own army. Crowing at his success and the fulfilment of his dream, he is gently chided by Jiang Wei, who points out that many in the past have thought they had risen to the top, only to find it is at that point that their fall begins. He even recommends that Zhong Hui might think about retiring or possibly becoming a hermit on Emei mountain. ‘I’m not even forty yet, so I’ve no plans to retire,’ replies Zhong Hui, and with the tacit encouragement of Jiang Wei he begins to have expansionist ideas. Jiang Wei even writes secretly to the second ruler encouraging him to have hopes for the restoration of the Han.","Wei Guan sent these letters to various officers who were serving under Deng Ai. He also prepared two cage carts. Wei Guan and his small party reached Chengdu about cockcrow and found waiting for him most of the officers to whom he had written. They at once yielded. Deng Ai was still asleep when the party reached his palace, but Wei Guan entered and forced his way into Deng Ai's chamber. He roared out: “I serve the Son of Heaven's command to arrest Deng Ai and his son!” The noise awakened the sleeper, who tumbled off his couch in alarm. But before Deng Ai could do anything to defend himself, he was seized, securely bound, and huddled into one of the carts. Deng Ai's son, Deng Zhong, rushed in at the noise, but was also made prisoner and thrust into the other cart. Many generals and attendants in the Palace want to attempt a rescue, but before they had prepared, they saw dust arose outside, and Zhong Hui with an army was close at hand, thus they scattered. Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei dismounted at the Palace gates and entered. The former, seeing both the Dengs prisoners, struck the elder about the head and face with his whip and insulted him, saying, “Vile cattle breeder! How dare you have your own scheme?” Nor was Jiang Wei backward. “You fool! See what your good luck has brought you today!” cried he. And Deng Ai replied in kind. Zhong Hui at once sent off both the prisoners to Luoyang, and then entered Chengdu in state. He added all Deng Ai's army to his own forces, so that he became very formidable. “Today I have attained the one desire of my life,” cried Zhong Hui. Jiang Wei replied, “At the beginning of Han, Han Xin hearkened not to Kuai Tong to establish his own kingdom, and so blundered into trouble at the Weiyang Palace, where he met his fate. In Yue, High Minister Wen Zhong would not follow Fan Li into retirement on the lakes, and so fell victim to a sword. No one would say these two—Han Xin and Wen Zhong—were not brilliant, but they did not scent danger early enough. Now, Sir, your merit is great and your prestige overwhelming that of your prince, but why do you risk future dangers? Why not sail off in a boat leaving no trace of your going? Why not go to Mount Omi and wander free with Master Red-Pine?” Zhong Hui smiled. “I do not think your advice much to the point. I am a young man, not forty yet, and think rather of going on than halting. I could not take up a do-nothing hermit's life.” “If you do not, then take heed and prepare for dangers. Think out a careful course, as you are well able to do. You need not trouble any old fool for advice.” Zhong Hui laughed loud and rubbed his hands together with glee. “How well you know my thoughts, my friend!” said he. They two became absorbed in the plans for their grand scheme. But Jiang Wei wrote a secret letter to the Latter Ruler, saying: “I pray Your Majesty be patient and put up with humiliations for a season, for Jiang Wei, your humble servant, will have the country restored in good time. The sun and moon are all the more glorious when they burst through the dark clouds. The House of Han is not yet done.”"
自此一連留張松飲宴三日，並不提起川中之事。松辭去，玄德於十里長亭，設宴送行。玄德舉酒酌松曰：“甚荷大夫不棄，留敍三日；今日相別，不知何時再得聽敎。”言罷，潸然淚下。張松自思：“玄德如此寬仁愛士，安可捨之？不如說之，令取西川。”乃言曰：“松亦思朝暮趨侍，恨未有便耳。松觀荊州：東有孫權，常懷虎踞；北有曹操，每欲鯨吞；亦非可久戀之地也。”玄德曰：“故知如此，但未有安跡之所。”松曰：“益州險塞，沃野千里，民殷國富；智能之士，久慕皇叔之德；若起荊襄之衆，長驅西指，霸業可成，漢室可興矣。”玄德曰：“備安敢當此？劉益州亦帝室宗親，恩澤布蜀中久矣。他人豈可得而動搖乎？”松曰：“某非賣主求榮；今遇明公，不敢不披瀝肝膽：劉季玉雖有益州之地，稟性闇弱，不能任賢用能；加之張魯在北，時思侵犯，人心離散，思得明主。松此一行，專欲納款於操；何期逆賊恣逞奸雄，傲賢慢士，故特來見明公。明公先取西川為基，然後北圖漢中，收取中原，匡正天朝，名垂靑史，功莫大焉。明公果有取西川之意，松願施犬馬之勞，以為內應。未知鈞意若何？”玄德曰：“深感君之厚意。奈劉季玉與備同宗，若攻之，恐天下人唾罵。”松曰：“大丈夫處世，當努力建功立業，著鞭在先。今若不取，為他人所取，悔之晚矣。”玄德曰：“備聞蜀道崎嶇，千山萬水，車不能方軌，馬不能聯轡；雖欲取之，用何良策？”松於袖中取出一圖，遞與玄德曰：“松感明公盛德，敢獻此圖。但看此圖，便知蜀中道路矣。”玄德略展視之，上面盡寫着地理行程：遠近闊狹，山川險要，府庫錢糧，一一俱載明白。松曰：“明公可速圖之。松有心腹契友二人：法正、孟達。此二人必能相助。如二人到荊州時，可以心事共議。”玄德拱手謝曰：“靑山不老，綠水長存。他日事成，必當厚報。”松曰：“松遇明主，不得不盡情相告，豈敢望報乎？”說罷作別。孔明命雲長等護送數十里方回。,"From then on, Zhang Song stayed for three consecutive days for a banquet and did not mention the incident in Sichuan. Song resigned, and Xuande held a banquet to see him off at the Shili Long Pavilion. Xuande held the wine and drank the pine and said, ""The doctor will not give up, I will stay for three days; today we will meet, I don't know when I will listen to you again."" After saying this, he burst into tears. Zhang Song thought to himself: ""Xuande is so lenient and kind to people, can he let him go? It's better to say, order to take Xichuan."" He said: ""Song also thinks about serving in the morning and evening, and hates not having a good ear. Song Guan Jingzhou: In the east there is Sun Quan, who is always squatting with tigers; in the north there is Cao Cao, who wants to be swallowed by a whale; it is not a place that can be loved for a long time."" Xuande said: ""So I know this, but there is no safe place."" Song said: ""Yizhou Dangerous fortress, fertile and wild for thousands of miles, the people of Yin and the country are rich; intelligent people, long-term admiration for the virtues of Huangshu; if the people from Jingxiang and Xiangyang are driven to the west, the hegemony can be achieved, and the Han Dynasty can flourish."" Xuande said: ""Be prepared to be brave. This? Liu Yizhou is also a relative of the emperor's clan, and he has been favored in Shu for a long time. How can others be shaken by it?"" Song said: ""A certain non-seller seeks glory; In addition, Zhang Lu is in the north, when he thinks about violations, his heart is scattered, and he thinks about the master. When he looses this line, he only wants to pay money to Cao; , so I came to see Duke Ming. Duke Ming first took Xichuan as the base, then north to Hanzhong, collected the Central Plains, rectified the celestial dynasty, and was famous in history, and made great contributions. Duke Ming had the intention of taking Xichuan, and he was willing to give the labor of dogs and horses. I don’t know what Jun’s intention is?” Xuande said, “I deeply appreciate your kindness. Liu Jiyu and Bei are of the same clan. If you attack him, you will be scolded by the world.” Song said, “When a man lives in the world, he should try his best to make a contribution and build a career. First. If you don't take it now, it will be taken by others, and it will be too late to regret it."" Xuande said: ""I have heard that the Shu Road is rugged, with thousands of mountains and rivers. What good strategy should I use?"" Song Yu took out a picture from his sleeve, handed it to Xuande and said, ""Song Yu feels that Duke Ming is so virtuous and dares to present this picture. But looking at this picture, you will know the road in the middle of Shu."" Xuande showed his vision. In addition, the geographical itinerary is written on it: far and near, wide and narrow, the mountains and rivers are dangerous, and the government treasury money and grain are all contained and understood. Song said: ""Ming Ming can quickly figure it out. Song has two confidants and friends: Fazheng and Mengda. These two will definitely be able to help each other. For example, when the two arrive in Jingzhou, they can discuss things together."" Xuande handed over his hands and thanked: "" The mountain is immortal, and the green water lasts forever. If he succeeds in his day, he will be rewarded generously."" Song said, ""When Song meets the master of Ming, he has to report to his heart's content, how dare he hope for the reward?"" Kong Ming ordered Yun Chang and others to escort them back for dozens of miles.","Zhang Song, stressing Xuande’s imperial lineage, asks if it is not possible that one day he might ascend to the throne as a legitimate heir, to which Xuande quietly defers. Three days later, it is time to leave, and once again discussion turns to the perilous state of Xuande’s lordship and control of a region. It is now that Zhang Song puts forward his idea: ‘My lord, I am truly impressed by you and so I’ll be honest with you also. Liu Zhang isn’t worthy of the lordship of Yizhou. He’s weak and fails to make use of either the wise or skilful people in his court. He’s threatened by rebellion in the north from Zhang Lu, and so naturally people yearn for a better ruler. I was sent to seek help from Cao Cao but discovered him to be a traitor unable to work with the worthy or draw upon the wise. So I came to see you. Come, take the Riverlands, take Shu for yourself. Start by pretending at first to be heading for Hanzhong but then seize the whole land. Your place in the history books will be assured. If you’re willing to do this, I’ll do all in my power to assist. So, what do you say to that?’ Xuande repeats what he has said so often before about not attacking a member of the same imperial family. Zhang Song counters this by pointing out that others might get there before Xuande does and then he would be sorry! Xuande, in one last attempt at diversion, says he understands the roads are terrible and the mountains impassable. This is when Zhong Song produces the maps he has secretly taken. He shows Xuande how to advance into Shu and assures him of support from his friends. ‘So long as the hills are always green and the rivers flow, I’ll ensure you are rewarded,’ says Xuande, to which Zhang Song replies, ‘I desire no reward, for having met a wise and benevolent lord, I’ve done what was necessary.’ Back in Yizhou, Zhang Song shares his plans with his friends","The next three days were spent in banquets and wine parties, but all the time no mention was made of the Western Land of Rivers. And when, at the end of that time, Zhang Song took leave, his host was at the three-mile “parting road” to bid him farewell and offer refreshment. When the moment came for the parting, Liu Bei raised his wine-cup and said, “I am sincerely grateful that you deigned to come here. You have prolonged your visit to three days, but now the moment of parting has come. Who knows when I may have the privilege of receiving your instructions again?” As Liu Bei said this, the tears flowed, but he hid them while Zhang Song, willing to believe that this emotion was on his account, thought how wonderfully kind and noble his host must be to be thus affected. Quite overcome, Zhang Song decided to speak about the west. So he said, “I have thought that I, too, would come to you one day, but so far I have found no way. In Jingzhou I see Sun Quan on the east, always ready to pounce; I see Cao Cao on the north, greedy to swallow. So this is not a wholly desirable place for you to remain in.” “I know this but too well,” said Liu Bei, “but I have no secure place to go to.” “Yiazhou is well protected, has much fertile soil, is populous and well governed. Its scholars are attracted by your virtue. If you marched your armies westward, you could easily become a real power there and restore the glory of the Hans.” “But how dare I attempt this? The ruler is also of the Imperial House. The whole region is devoted to him for his good deeds, and no other person could attain such a hold.” “I am no traitor,” said Zhang Song, “but in your presence I feel constrained to be perfectly open and plain. Liu Zhang, the Imperial Protector of Yiazhou, is naturally weak and can neither use the wise nor employ the capable. Then again Zhang Lu threatens the north. People are distracted and would gladly welcome an appreciative ruler. The journey I have just made was to propose to support Cao Cao and place the region under him, but I found him rebellious and set on evil, proud and arrogant. So I have turned aside to you. If you will take Yiazhou, you will have a base from which to deal with Hanzhong when you will, and the whole country beside. You will continue the rightful line, and your name will live in history. Would not that be real fame? If then you think of taking our country, I am willing to do what little I can as an ally within. But do you contemplate such a step?” “I am deeply grateful that you think so well of me. But the Imperial Protector being a member of the family, I should lay myself open to general execration, were I to attack him.” “When a hero finds himself in the world, his duty is to work out his destiny, to exert himself and perform his task as best as he can, to press forward among the foremost. At the moment the position is that, if you fail to seize this opportunity, some other will take possession of Yiazhou, and you will regret when too late.” “And I have heard much of the difficult nature of the country, its many high mountains and numerous streams, and its narrow roads. How could such a country be invaded?” Then Zhang Song drew the map from his sleeve, saying, “I am so deeply affected by your virtue that I offer you this map of the country, whereby its roads and rivers may be known.” Liu Bei unrolled the map; it was covered with notes, on the lie of the land, lengths and widths, and such matters. Strategic points on rivers and hills were shown, and store-houses and granaries and treasuries. Everything was plainly stated. Zhang Song went on, “Sir, you can prepare your plans promptly. I have two friends who will certainly help you. And when they come to see you, you may be perfectly frank with them. Their names are Fa Zheng and Meng Da.” Liu Bei thanked him with joined hands. Said he, “As the blue mountains grow not old and the green waters always remain, so shall I never forget. And when I shall have accomplished my task, you shall have no mean reward.” Replied Zhang Song, “I look for no reward. Having met with an enlightened lord, I felt compelled to unbosom myself to him.” Zhang Song left soon after, and Guan Yu escorted him for several miles."

玄德、孔明皆深然之，遂傳令趙雲、張飛為先鋒，玄德與孔明親自引兵十萬，擇日圖漢中；傳檄各處，嚴加隄備。時建安二十三年，秋七月吉日。玄德大軍出葭萌關下營，召黃忠、嚴顏到寨，厚賞之。玄德曰：“人皆言將軍老矣，惟軍師獨知將軍之能。今果立奇功。但今漢中定軍山，乃南鄭保障，糧草積聚之所；若得定軍山，陽平一路，無足憂矣。將軍還敢取定軍山否？”黃忠慨然應諾，便要領兵前去。孔明急止之曰：“老將軍雖然英勇，然夏侯淵非張郃之比也。淵深通韜略，善曉兵機，曹操倚之為西涼藩蔽；先曾屯兵長安，拒馬孟起；今又屯兵漢中。操不託他人，而獨託淵者，以淵有將才也。今將軍雖勝張郃，未卜能勝夏侯淵。吾欲酌量着一人去荊州，替回關將軍來，方可敵之。”忠奮然答曰：“昔廉頗年八十，尚食斗米、肉十斤，諸侯畏其勇，不敢侵犯趙界，何況黃忠未及七十乎？軍師言吾老，吾今並不用副將，只將本部兵三千人去，立斬夏侯淵首級，納於麾下。”孔明再三不容。黃忠只是要去。孔明曰：“旣將軍要去，吾使一人為監軍同去，若何？”正是：,"Xuande and Kongming understood this, so they ordered Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei to be the vanguards. Xuande and Kongming personally led 100,000 troops to choose a day to map Hanzhong; It was the 23rd year of Jian'an, and it was an auspicious day in autumn and July. Xuande's army went out of Jiameng Pass to camp, summoned Huang Zhong and Yan Yan to the village, and rewarded them generously. Xuande said: ""Everyone says that generals are old, but military advisers only know what a general can do. Today, he has achieved extraordinary achievements. But today, Dingjun Mountain in Hanzhong is the protection of Nanzheng, where food and grass are accumulated; if Dingjun Mountain is obtained, Yangping all the way. , there is nothing to worry about. Will the general still dare to take the Dingjun Mountain?"" Huang Zhong complied with his promise, and wanted to lead his troops there. Kong Ming stopped him and said: ""Although the old general is brave, Xiahou Yuan is not comparable to Zhang He. Yuan has a deep understanding of strategy and is good at military tactics. Cao Cao relies on it to cover the Xiliang vassal. The troops are stationed in Hanzhong. Those who do not rely on others, but only rely on Yuan, have generals and talents in Yuan. Although the general is better than Zhang He today, it is not known that he will be able to defeat Xiahou Yuan. ""Zhong Fenran replied: ""In the past, Lian Po was eighty years old, and he still ate ten kilograms of rice and meat. The princes were afraid of his bravery and did not dare to invade Zhao's realm. Besides, Huang Zhong was not even seventy years old? Today, there is no need for lieutenants, only three thousand soldiers from the headquarters will be sent, and Xiahou Yuan's head will be beheaded and taken under his command."" Kong Ming repeatedly refused. Huang Zhong is just going. Kong Ming said: ""General Yan is going, and I will send one person to go with him as a supervisor. What if?""","Thank you, Huang Zhong,’ says Xuande. ‘Even though some mocked you, Kong Ming had confidence in you, and you’ve done marvels. All our foes have left is Dingjun mountain. If we take that, then our way to Yangping is clear. Are you up for a further challenge?’ Even though Huang Zhong is keen, Kong Ming urges caution. ‘ Xiahou Yuan, who holds Dingjun, is no fool. Remember he defended Xiliang, defeated Ma Chao and has taken Hanzhong. I think we need to call for Guan Yu to come and take control.’ Huang Zhong is predictably furious: ‘I will take my three thousand best men and will bring you Xiahou Yuan’s head.’ Despite Kong Ming’s continued opposition, in the end Huang Zhong wins but agrees that Kong Ming can choose the assistant to go with him. So who does Kong Ming choose?","Zhao Yun and Zhang Fei were to lead the van, while Liu Bei with Zhuge Liang commanded the main army of one hundred thousand troops. A day was chosen to set out, and orders were sent to everyone to keep careful guard for Yiazhou. It was a certain auspicious day in the seventh month of the twenty-third year that the army marched (AD 218). Reaching Jiameng Pass, Huang Zhong and Yan Yan were summoned and well rewarded for their services. Liu Bei said to Huang Zhong, “People said you were old, General, but the Directing Instructor of the army know you better than they, and you have rendered amazing service. Still, Dingjun Mountain is yet to be captured, and it is both a great central store and a major defense of Nanzheng. If we could get Dingjun Mountain, we could be quite easy about the whole region of Hanzhong. Think you that you are equal to taking Dingjun Mountain?” To this harangue of Liu Bei, the veteran nobly answered that he was willing to try and was ready to start when they would. Said Zhuge Liang hastily, “Do not be hasty. You are brave enough, General, but Xiahou Yuan is a man of different stamp from Zhang He. Xiahou Yuan is a real strategist and tactician; so much so that Cao Cao relies upon him as his defense against Xiliang. It was he who was set to defend Changan when threatened by Ma Chao. Now he is in Hanzhong, and Cao Cao puts his whole confidence in him and his skill as a leader. You have overcome Zhang He, but it is not certain you will conquer this man. I think I must send down to Jingzhou for Guan Yu for this task.” Huang Zhong hotly replied, “Old Lian Po was eighty years old and yet he ate a bushel of rice and ten pounds of flesh, so that his vigor frightened the nobles and not one dared encroach upon the borders of the state of Zhao. I am not yet seventy. You call me old, O Instructor; then I will not take any helper, but go out simply with my own three thousand troops, and we will lay Xiahou Yuan's head at your feet.” Zhuge Liang refused to allow him to go; Huang Zhong insisted. At last Zhuge Liang consented, but said he would send an overseer. They put upon his mettle the man who was to go,"
次日，魏兵大至。後主率太子諸王，及羣臣六十餘人，面縛輿櫬，出北門十里而降。鄧艾扶起後主，親解其縛，焚其輿櫬，並車入城。後人有詩歎曰：,"The next day, the Wei army arrived. Later, the lord led the princes, the princes, and more than sixty other officials, bound the thorns with their faces, and went out of the north gate ten li and descended. Deng Ai helped the late master, released his bondage personally, burned his carcass, and drove into the city. A later poem sighed and said:","The only hero the northern lands’ king, Liu Chen. He gave his life to save his ancestor’s shame, Distraught, weeping below the blue sky.","Soon the main body of the Wei army came. The Latter Ruler and all his courtiers to the number of sixty went out three miles from the north gate to bow their heads in submission, the Latter Ruler binding himself with cord and taking a coffin with him. But Deng Ai with his own hands loosened the bonds raised the Latter Ruler from the ground. The coffin was burned. Then the victorious leader and the vanquished Emperor returned into the city side by side."
却說鄴城門上，忽一日見貼下告示一道。守門者揭了，來奏曹叡。叡觀之，其文曰：,"However, he said that a notice was posted on the Yecheng gate one day. The gatekeeper revealed it and came to play Cao Rui. Rui Guanzhi wrote:","One day such a proclamation is found nailed to the main city gate of Yecheng. It is taken to Cao Rui, who reads that, according to this poster, his father apparently wanted Cao Zhi to become the next emperor. Apparently – again according to this poster – because of a charge of treason he was passed over, and instead Cao Rui was enthroned – ‘a man with no discernible virtue’!",Whence it came about that a notice suddenly appeared on the city gate of Yejun. The wardens of the gate took it down and sent it to Cao Rui. This is what it said:

Everyone regarded him as Meng Huo's wife and brother, now the head of the Eighth Division, named ""Bringing the Cave Master"". Overjoyed, asked who. He brought the owner of the cave and said: ""Go to Bana Cave in the southwest. The master of the cave, King Mulu, has deep knowledge of magic: he can ride an elephant; he can call the wind and rain; he is often accompanied by tigers, leopards, wolves, poisonous snakes and scorpions. He also has 30,000 divine soldiers. , is very heroic. The king can repair books and ceremonies, and a certain person will go to ask for it. If this person is willing, why should you be afraid of Shu soldiers?"" Huo Xinran, ordered the old country to leave with the book. However, King Duosi was ordered to guard Sanjiang City, thinking that it was a barrier in front.","Gathering his surviving thousand or so men together, Meng Huo swears to take revenge, and his men all cry their agreement. It is also agreed that help should be sought from King Mulu of the Bana valley, who is renowned for his magical powers and at whose command tigers, leopards, wolves, scorpions and poisonous snakes come to his aid. So Meng Huo’s brother-in-law is sent with gifts to entice him to join the uprising. Meanwhile King Duosi fortifies Sanjiang.","In his own ravine, Meng Huo gathered his family and clan to the number of a thousand or more and addressed them: “I have been put to shame by the leaders of Shu many times, and I have sworn to take revenge for the insults. Has anyone any proposal to make?” Thereupon a certain one replied, saying, “I can produce a man able to defeat Zhuge Liang.” The assembly turned to the speaker, who was a brother of Meng Huo's wife. He was the head of eight tribes of the Southern Mangs, and was named Chief Dai Lai. “Who is the man?” asked Meng Huo. Chief Dai Lai replied, “He is Mu Lu, King of the Bana Ravine. He is a master of witchcraft who can call up the wind and invoke the rain. He rides upon an elephant and is attended by tigers, leopards, wolves, venomous snakes, and scorpions. Beside, he has under his hand thirty thousand superhuman soldiers. He is very bold. O King, write him a letter and send him presents, which I will deliver. If he will consent to lend his aid, what fear have we of Shu?” Meng Huo was pleased with the scheme and ordered Dai Lai to draft a letter. Then he ordered Duo Si to defend Three Rivers and make the first line of defense."

曹眞看畢大喜，曰：“天使吾成功也！”遂重賞來人，便令回報，依期會合。眞喚費耀商議曰：“今姜維暗獻密書，令吾如此如此。”耀曰：“諸葛亮多謀，姜維智廣，或者是諸葛亮所使——恐其中有詐。”眞曰：“他原是魏人，不得已而降蜀，又何疑乎？”耀曰：“都督不可輕去，只守定本寨。某願引一軍接應姜維。如成功，盡歸都督；倘有奸計，某自支當。”眞大喜，遂令費耀引五萬兵，望斜谷而進。行了兩三程，屯下軍馬，令人哨探。當日申時分，回報：“斜谷道中，有蜀兵來也。”耀忙催兵進。蜀兵未及交戰先退。耀引兵追之，蜀兵又來。方欲對陣，蜀兵又退：如此者三次，俄延至次日申時分。魏兵一日一夜，不曾敢歇，只恐蜀兵攻擊。方欲屯軍造飯，忽然四面喊聲大震，鼓角齊鳴，蜀兵漫山遍野而來。門旗開處，閃出一輛四輪車，孔明端坐其中，令人請魏軍主將答話。耀縱馬而出，遙見孔明，心中暗喜，回顧左右曰：“如蜀兵掩至，便退後走。若見山後火起，却回身殺去，自有兵來接應。”分付畢，躍馬出呼曰：“前者敗將，今何敢又來！”孔明曰：“喚汝曹眞來答話！”耀罵曰：“曹都督乃金枝玉葉，安肯與反賊相見耶！”孔明大怒，把羽扇一招，左有馬岱，右有張嶷，兩路兵衝出。魏兵便退。行不到三十里，望見蜀兵背後火起，喊聲不絕。費耀只道號火，便回身殺來。蜀兵齊退。耀提刀在前，只望喊處追趕。將次近火，山路又鼓角喧天，喊聲震地，兩軍殺出：左有關興，右有張苞。山上矢石如雨，往下射來。魏兵大敗。費耀知是中計，急退軍望山谷中而走，人馬困乏。背後關興引生力軍趕來，魏兵自相踐踏及落澗身死者，不知其數。耀逃命而走，正遇山坡口一彪軍：乃是姜維。耀大罵曰：“反賊無信！吾不幸誤中汝奸計也！”維笑曰：“吾欲擒曹眞，誤賺汝矣！速下馬受降！”耀驟馬奪路，望山谷中而走。忽見谷中火光沖天，背後追兵又至。耀自刎身死，餘衆盡降。孔明連夜驅兵，直至祁山前下寨，收住軍馬，重賞姜維。維曰：“某恨不得殺曹眞也。”孔明亦曰：“可惜大計小用矣。”,"Cao Zhen was overjoyed when he saw Bi, and said, ""Angel, I succeeded!"" Then he rewarded the people who came, and ordered them to return, and they would meet on schedule. He called Fei Yao to discuss it and said, ""Now Jiang Wei is offering a secret book to me, so I am like this."" Yao said: ""Zhuge Liang is resourceful, Jiang Wei Zhi Guang, or Zhuge Liang's agent - I am afraid that there is a fraud."" Zhen said: ""He It was originally from Wei and had to surrender to Shu, so why should there be any doubt?"" Yao said: ""The governor should not be taken lightly, and he should only guard the Dingbenzhai. A certain willing to lead an army to meet Jiang Wei. If it succeeds, it will be returned to the governor; Self-support."" He was overjoyed, so he ordered Fei Yao to lead fifty thousand soldiers to look at the sloping valley and enter. After two or three trips, the army horses were stationed, which made people look out. At the time of the declaration that day, he reported: ""In the Xiegu Road, there are soldiers from Shu."" Yao hurriedly urged the troops to enter. The Shu soldiers retreated before they could fight. Yao led his troops to pursue him, and the Shu soldiers came again. Fang wanted to fight, but the Shu soldiers retreated: if this happened three times, Russia would postpone it until the next day. The Wei soldiers worked day and night, never daring to rest, only fearing that the Shu soldiers would attack. Fang wanted to gather his troops to make meals, but suddenly there were loud shouts from all sides, drums and horns blared in unison, and Shu soldiers came from all over the mountains and plains. When the flag opened, a four-wheeled vehicle flashed out. Kong Ming sat in it, and asked the commander of the Wei army to answer. Yao rode his horse out and saw Kong Ming in the distance. He was secretly delighted, and he looked back and said: ""If the soldiers of Shu are covering up, then back away. If you see fire from the back of the mountain, but turn around and kill, your own soldiers will come to meet them."" Then the horse jumped out and shouted: ""The former was defeated, how dare you come again now!"" Kong Ming said: ""Call you Cao Zhen to answer!"" Yao cursed: ""The governor of Cao is a golden branch and a jade leaf, An Ken will meet the rebels!"" Angrily, he moved the feather fan, Ma Dai on the left, Zhang Yi on the right, and two soldiers rushed out. The Wei soldiers retreated. After walking for less than thirty miles, I saw the fire behind the soldiers of Shu, shouting incessantly. Fei Yao only shouted fire and turned around to kill. The Shu soldiers retreated. Yao carried the knife in front, and only looked to chase after him. The next time was close to the fire, the mountain road was full of horns, and the shouts shook the ground. The two armies rushed out: Guanxing on the left, Zhang Bao on the right. The arrows and stones on the mountain are like rain, shooting down. Wei Bing was defeated. Fei Yaozhi was in the middle of the plan, and the army quickly retreated and walked into the valley, and the troops and horses were exhausted. Behind Guan Xing's new force came, Wei Bing trampled on each other and fell into the stream to die, I don't know how many. Yao fled for his life, and met a Biao army at the mountain pass: it was Jiang Wei. Yao scolded, ""Rebels are untrustworthy! Unfortunately, I was caught in your treachery!"" Wei laughed and said, ""I wanted to capture Cao Zhen, but I made you by mistake! Quickly dismount and accept the surrender!"" And go. Suddenly, I saw the fire in the valley soaring into the sky, and the chasing troops came again. Yao killed himself, and the rest of the crowd surrendered. Kong Ming drove his troops all night until he settled down in front of Qishan Mountain, stopped his horses, and rewarded Jiang Wei. Wei said, ""I wish I could kill Cao Zhen."" Kong Ming also said, ""It's a pity that it's too big for a small plan.""","Advised by his commanders and especially Jiang Wei that they need to create a diversion in order to trap Cao Zhen and defeat the mighty Wang Shuang, Kong Ming agrees, and the army divides.","The letter pleased Cao Zhen, and he said, “This is heaven-sent help to aid me in an achievement.” Cao Zhen rewarded the messenger and bade him return to say that it was accepted. Then he called Fei Yao to his councils and said, “I have just had a secret letter from Jiang Wei telling me to act in a certain fashion.” But Fei Yao replied, “Zhuge Liang is very crafty, and Jiang Wei is very knowing. If by chance Zhuge Liang has planned all this and sent this man, we may fall into a snare.” “But Jiang Wei is really a man of Wei; he was forced into surrender. Why are you suspicious?” “My advice is not to go, but to remain here on guard. Let me go to meet this man, and any service I can accomplish will redound to your credit. And if there be any craft, I can meet it for you.” Cao Zhen approved this and bade Fei Yao take fifty thousand troops by way of the Xie Valley. Fei Yao marched away and halted after the second or third stage and send out scouts. This was done, and the scouts reported that the Shu army was coming through the valley. Fei Yao at once advanced, but before the troops of Shu got into contact with him, they retired. Fei Yao pursued. Then the troops of Shu came on again. Just as Fei Yao was forming up for battle, the Shu army retreated again. And these maneuvers were repeated thrice, and a day and a night passed without any repose for the Wei army. At length rest was imperative, and they were on the point of entrenching themselves to prepare food when a great hubbub arose all around, and with beating of drums and blaring of trumpets, the whole country was filled with the soldiers of Shu. Suddenly there was a stir near by the great standard, and out came a small four-wheeled chariot in which sat Zhuge Liang. He bade a herald call the leader of the Wei army to a parley. Fei Yao rode out and, seeing Zhuge Liang, he secretly rejoiced. Turning to those about him, he said, “If the soldiers of Shu come on, you are to retire and look out for a signal. If you see a blaze, you are to turn and attack, for you will be reinforced by Jiang Wei.” Then Fei Yao rode to the front and shouted, “You rebel leader in front there; how dare you come here again after the last defeat?” Zhuge Liang replied, “Go and call Cao Zhen to a parley.” “My chief, Cao Zhen, is of the royal stock; think you that he will come to parley with rebels?” Zhuge Liang angrily waved his fan, and there came forth Ma Dai and Zhang Ni and their troops with a rush. The Wei army retired. But ere they had gone far, they saw a blaze in the rear of the advancing host of Shu and heard a great shouting. Fei Yao could only conclude that this was the signal of Jiang Wei he was looking for, and so he faced about to attack. But the enemy also turned about and retired. Fei Yao led the pursuit, sword in hand, hastening to the point whence the shouting came. Nearing the signal fire, the drums beat louder than ever, and then out came two armies, one under Guan Xing and the other under Zhang Bao, while arrows and stones rained from the hill-tops. The Wei troops could not stand it and knew not only they were beaten, but beaten by a ruse. Fei Yao tried to withdraw his force into the shelter of the valley to rest, but the enemy pressed on him, and the army of Wei fell into confusion. Pressing upon each other, many fell into the streams and were drowned. Fei Yao could do nothing but flee for his life. Just as he was passing by a steep hill there appeared a cohort, and the leader was Jiang Wei. Fei Yao began to upbraid him, crying, “Faithless ingrate! I have haplessly fallen in your treachery and craftiness!” Jiang Wei replied, “You are the wrong victim; we meant to capture Cao Zhen not you. You would do well to yield!” But Fei Yao only galloped away toward a ravine. Suddenly the ravine filled with flame. Then he lost all hope. The pursuers were close behind, so Fei Yao with a sword put an end to his own life. Of the army of Wei many surrendered. The Shu army pressed home their advantage and, hastening forward, reached Qishan and made a camp. There the army was mustered and put in order. Jiang Wei received a reward, but he was chagrined that Cao Zhen had not been taken. “My regret is that I did not slay Cao Zhen,” said he. “Indeed, yes,” replied Zhuge Liang. “It is a pity that a great scheme should have had so poor a result.”"
且說魏王曹丕，自卽王位，將文武官僚，盡皆陞賞；遂統甲兵三十萬，南巡沛國譙縣，大饗先塋。鄕中父老，揚塵遮道，奉觴進酒，效漢高祖還沛之事。人報大將軍夏侯惇病危，丕卽還鄴郡。時惇已卒，丕為挂孝，以厚禮殯葬。,"Let us say that Cao Pi, the king of Wei, who came from the throne of Yu, raised all the civil, military, bureaucratic, and bureaucrats with rewards. In the middle of the old age, the dust covered the road, and the wine was served at the beginning, imitating the work of the emperor of the Han Dynasty to return to Pei. People reported that the general Xiahou Dun was critically ill, and Pei returned to Ye County. When Shi Dun died, Pi was buried with filial piety.","With barely a hundred men, Liu Feng flees until eventually he staggers back into Chengdu, where he falls on the ground before Xuande, king of Hanzhong as he now is, and begs forgiveness.","So no military movements were made. After he had succeeded to the princedom, Cao Pi raised all his officers to high rank and had an army prepared of three hundred thousand, and maneuvered them over the southern territories and made great feasts in the county of Qiao in the old state of Pei, which was the land of his ancestors. As the grand army passed by, the aged villagers lined the roads offering gifts of wine, just as when the Founder of the Hans returned home to Pei. When it was announced that the Regent Marshal Xiahou Dun was near death, Cao Pi hastened back to Yejun, but arrived too late to see him. He put on mourning for the great leader and instituted magnificent funeral ceremonies."
且說劉封、孟達自取上庸，太守申耽率衆歸降，因此漢中王加劉封為副將軍，與孟達同守上庸。當日探知關公兵敗，二人正議間，忽報廖化至。封令請入問之。化曰：“關公兵敗，見困於麥城，被圍至急。蜀中援兵，不能旦夕卽至。特令某突圍而出，來此求救。望二將軍速起上庸之兵，以救此危。倘稍遲延，公必陷矣。”封曰：“將軍且歇，容某計議。”,"Let's say that Liu Feng and Meng Da took Shangyong by themselves, and the prefect Shen Dan led the crowd to surrender. Therefore, the king of Hanzhong added Liu Feng as a deputy general and guarded Shangyong with Meng Da. On the same day, when they found out that Guan Gong was defeated, the two suddenly reported that Liao Hua had arrived. Please inquire about the order. Hua said: ""Guan Gong's army was defeated, and he saw that he was trapped in Maicheng, and he was besieged urgently. The reinforcements from the middle of Shu could not arrive overnight. I specially ordered a certain person to break out of the siege and came here to ask for help. I hope that the second generals will quickly raise the soldiers of Shangyong to save this place. Dangerous. If there is a little delay, the Duke will be trapped."" Feng said: ""General, please rest, let me discuss.""","As the enemy take up positions around Maicheng to besiege it, Liao Hua is able to slip through and ride hell for leather to Shangyong to get help. ‘Guan Yu is trapped at Maicheng, and it’ll be a long time before troops from Shu can arrive. This is why I’ve been sent to you. We need your help. Even the slightest hesitation on your behalf will spell doom for Guan Yu.’ After Liao Hua has gone to rest, Liu Feng and Meng Da sit down to discuss this.","Now, having captured Shangyong, Liu Feng and Meng Da had remained to guard it. Liu Feng had been created Governor General, and together with Meng Da, to defend that city. When they heard of the defeat of Guan Yu, they took counsel what to do. When Liao Hua came, he was admitted into the city. He told the tale of Guan Yu's straits, and asked for help. “Guan Yu is closely besieged in Maicheng. Help from the west will be a long time in coming, so I have been sent to beg your assistance. I hope you will march the Shangyong troops thither as quickly as possible, for any delay will be fatal.” Liu Feng replied, “Sir, go to the rest-house for a time till we can decide.”"
是歲八月間，報稱石邑縣鳳凰來儀，臨淄城麒麟出現，黃龍現於鄴郡。於是中郎將李伏、太史丞許芝商議：種種瑞徵，乃魏當代漢之兆，可安排受禪之禮，令漢帝將天下讓於魏王。遂同華歆、王朗、辛毗、賈詡、劉廙、劉曄、陳矯、陳羣、桓階等，一班文武官僚，四十餘人，直入內殿，來奏漢獻帝，請禪位於魏王曹丕。正是：,"In the eighth month of the year, it was reported that Shiyi County Phoenix came to Yi, Linzi City Qilin appeared, and Huanglong appeared in Ye County. So Zhonglang generals Li Fu and Taishi Cheng Xu Zhi discussed: All kinds of auspicious expeditions are signs of the Wei Dynasty and Han Dynasty, and they can arrange to receive the ritual of Zen, so that the Emperor of Han will surrender the world to the King of Wei. Then, together with Hua Xin, Wang Lang, Xin Pi, Jia Xu, Liu Yu, Liu Ye, Chen Jiao, Chen Qun, Huan Jie, etc., a group of civil and military bureaucrats, more than 40 people, went straight to the inner hall, and came to pay tribute to Emperor Xian of Han, please Zen was located in Cao Pi, the king of Wei. Exactly:","With barely a hundred men, Liu Feng flees until eventually he staggers back into Chengdu, where he falls on the ground before Xuande, king of Hanzhong as he now is, and begs forgiveness.","In the late summer of this same year, it was reported that a phoenix had been seen to bow at Shiyi, and a linlion had appeared at Linzi, while a yellow dragon was observed in Yejun. Whereupon Imperial Commander Li Fu and Minister Xu Zhi discussed these appearances, and putting them all together they concluded, saying, “Those splendid signs presage that Wei is about to supplant Han, and the altar of abdication should be set up.” Presently a deputation of forty high officers, both military and civil, led by Hua Xin, Wang Lang, Xin Pi, Jia Xu, Liu Ye, Liu Yi, Chen Jiao, Chen Qun, and Huan Jie went into the Palace and proposed to Emperor Xian that he should abdicate and yield to the Prince of Wei, Cao Pi."
孔明卽笑而遣之。獲忻然拜謝而去。於是聚得諸洞壯丁數千人，望南迤邐而行。早望見塵頭起處，一隊兵到：乃是兄弟孟優，重整殘兵，來與兄報讎。兄弟二人，抱頭相哭，訴說前事。優曰：“我兵屢敗，蜀兵屢勝，難以抵當。只可就山陰洞中，退避不出。蜀兵受不過暑氣，自然退矣。”獲問曰：“何處可避？”優曰：“此去西南有一洞，名曰禿龍洞。洞主朶思大王，與弟甚厚，可投之。”於是孟獲先敎孟優到禿龍洞，見了朶思大王。朶思慌引洞兵出迎。孟獲入洞，禮畢，訴說前事。朶思曰：“大王寬心：若川兵到來，令他一人一騎不得還鄕，與諸葛亮皆死於此處！”獲大喜，問計於朶思。朶思曰：“此洞中，止有兩條路：東北上一路，就是大王所來之路，地勢平坦，土厚水甜，人馬可行；若以木石壘斷洞口，雖有百萬之衆，不能進也。西北上有一條路，山險嶺惡，道路窄狹；其中雖有小路，多藏毒蛇惡蝎；黃昏時分，煙瘴大起，直至巳、午時方收，惟未、申、酉三時，可以往來；水不可飲，人馬難行。此處更有四個毒泉：一名啞泉，其水頗甜，人若飲之，則不能言，不過旬日必死；二曰滅泉，此水與湯無異，人若沐浴，則皮肉皆爛，見骨必死；三曰黑泉，其水微淸，人若濺之在身，則手足皆黑而死；四曰柔泉，其水如冰，人若飲之，咽喉無煖氣，身軀輭弱如綿而死。此處蟲鳥皆無，惟有漢伏波將軍曾到；自此以後，更無一人到此。今壘斷東北大路，令大王穩居敝洞，若蜀兵見東路截斷，必從西路而入；於路無水，若見此四泉，定然飲水；雖百萬之衆，皆無歸矣——何用刀兵耶？”孟獲大喜，以手加額曰：“今日方有容身之地！”又望北指曰：“任諸葛亮神機妙算，難以施設！四泉之水，足以報敗兵之恨也！”自此，孟獲、孟優終日與朶思大王筵宴。,"Kong Ming smiled and sent him away. He was thankful and left. So they gathered thousands of strong men from all the caves, looking southward. As soon as I saw the beginning of Chentou, a group of soldiers arrived: it was brother Meng You, who reorganized the remaining soldiers and came to report to his brother. The two brothers hug each other and cry, telling the past. You said: ""My soldiers have been defeated many times, and the Shu soldiers have won many times, so it is difficult to stand up. I can only retreat in the cave of the mountain. The Shu soldiers can't stand the heat, so they will naturally retreat."" Huo asked, ""Where can we avoid it? You said, ""There is a cave in the southwest of this place, called the Bald Dragon Cave. The owner of the cave, King Duosi, is very close to his younger brother, so he can invest in it."" So Meng Huo first sent Meng You to the Bald Dragon Cave, where he met King Duosi. Duosi panicked and led the soldiers out of the cave to welcome him. Meng Huo entered the cave, finished the ceremony, and told the story. Duo Si said, ""Your Majesty is open-hearted: if the troops from Sichuan arrive, he will not be able to return to his horse, and he and Zhuge Liang will both die here!"" He was overjoyed and asked Duo Si for a plan. Duosi said: ""There are only two roads in this cave: the northeast road is the road where the king came. The terrain is flat, the soil is thick and the water is sweet, and people and horses are feasible. It is impossible to enter. There is a road in the northwest. The mountains are dangerous and the road is narrow and narrow. Although there are small roads, there are many poisonous snakes and scorpions hidden in it. During the three seasons, you can come and go; the water is not drinkable, and it is difficult for people and horses to travel. There are also four poisonous springs here: a dumb spring, whose water is quite sweet, if people drink it, they will not be able to speak, and they will die within ten days; Mie Spring, this water is no different from soup. If a person takes a bath, the flesh and skin will be rotten, and the bones will die. The third is the Black Spring, whose water is slightly sloppy. The spring, its water is like ice, if people drink it, the throat will not warm, the body will be weak like cotton and die. There are no insects and birds here, only General Han Fubo has been there; since then, no one has come here. Block off the northeastern road, so that the king can live in the cave. If the soldiers of Shu see that the east road is cut off, they will enter from the west road; if there is no water on the road, if they see these four springs, they will definitely drink water; even if there are millions of them, they will all be gone— Why would you use a sword?"" Meng Huo was overjoyed, raised his forehead with his hand, and said, ""I have a place to live today!"" Looking at the north finger, he said, ""It is difficult for Zhuge Liang to set up a clever plan! The water of the four springs is enough to repay the hatred of the defeated soldiers! ""Since then, Meng Huo and Meng You have been feasting with King Duosi all day long.","And once again, having ascertained that Meng Huo will indeed make another attempt, but if defeated he will – he promises – submit, Kong Ming releases him. He joins up with his brother Meng You, and they decide to take refuge in Bald Dragon ravine until the heat of summer drives the invading army away. Bald Dragon ravine’s chieftain, Duosi, assures them that this place is a perfect refuge because there are only two roads in and out. One is blocked by fortifications and is impassable to any enemy. The other road is a track across desolate landscapes and past four deadly springs – the only source of water anywhere in the region of the path. ‘ No one,’ he confidently tells Meng Huo and You, ‘will ever get through there.","Zhuge Liang smiled, but let him go. The King thanked him and left. As soon as he was set at liberty, Meng Huo got together several thousand of his adherents and went away southward. Before long he fell in with his brother, Meng You, who had got together an army and was on his way to avenge his brother. As soon as they saw each other, the brothers fell upon each other's necks and wept. They related their experiences. Meng You said, “We cannot stand against the enemy. We have been defeated several times. Now I think we would better go into the mountains and hide in some dark gully where they cannot find us. Those soldiers of Shu will never stand the summer heat; they must retire.” “Where can we hide?” asked his brother. “I know a valley away southwest from us called 'Bald Dragon Ravine,' and the King, Duo Si, is a friend of mine. Let us take refuge with him.” “Very well; go and arrange it,” said Meng Huo. So Meng You went. When he got there and talked to the chief, King Duo Si lost no time, but came out with his soldiers to welcome Meng Huo, who then entered the valley. After the exchange of salutations, Meng Huo explained his case. Duo Si said, “O King, rest content. If those men from the Lands of Rivers come here, I will see to it that not one goes home. And Zhuge Liang will meet his death here too.” Naturally, Meng Huo was pleased; but he wanted to know how his host could feel so secure. Duo Si said, “In this ravine there are only two roads, the one you came by and another by the northwest. The road you traveled along is level and soft, and the waters are sweet. Humans and horses may both use it. But if we close the mouth of the ravine with a barricade, then no one, however strong, can get in. The other road is precipitous, dangerous, and narrow. The only path is beset with venomous serpents and scorpions, and as evening comes on there are malarial exhalations which are dangerous till past noon the next day. The road is only practicable between two watches before sunset. Then the water is undrinkable. The road is very difficult. “Then again there are four streams actually poisonous. One is called 'The Dumb Spring.' Its water is pleasant to the palate, but it makes people dumb and they die in a few days. A second fountain is called 'The Spring of Destruction' and is hot. But if a person bathes therein, his flesh rots till his bones protrude and he dies. The third is 'The Black Spring.' Its waters are greenish. If it be sprinkled on a person's body, his limbs turn black and presently he dies. The fourth is 'The Spring of Weak Water,' ice cold. If a person drink of this water his breath is chilled, he becomes weak as a thread and soon dies. Neither birds nor insects are found in this region, and no one but the Han General Ma Yuan, who was styled General Who Quells the Waves for this exploit, has ever passed. Now the northeast road shall be blocked, and you may hide here perfectly safe from those troops of Shu, for, finding that way blocked, they will try the other road, which is waterless save for the four deadly springs. No matter how many they be, they will perish, and we need no weapons.” “Now indeed I have found a place to live in,” cried Meng Huo, striking his forehead. Then looking to the north he said, “Even Zhuge Liang's wonderful cunning will be of no avail. The four springs alone will defeat him and avenge my army.” The two brothers settled down comfortably as guests of King Duo Si, with whom they spent the days in feasting."
却說孔明歸帳，先喚趙雲、魏延聽令。孔明曰：“汝二人各引本部軍去劫魏寨。”魏延進曰：“曹眞深明兵法，必料我乘喪劫寨。他豈不隄防？”孔明笑曰：“吾正欲曹眞知吾去劫寨也。彼必伏兵在祁山之後，待我兵過去，却來襲我寨；吾故令汝二人，引兵前去，過山脚後路，遠下營寨，任魏兵來劫吾寨。汝看火起為號，分兵兩路：文長拒住山口，子龍引兵殺回，必遇魏兵，却放彼走回，汝乘勢攻之，彼必自相掩殺：可獲全勝。”二將引兵受計而去。又喚關興、張苞分付曰：“汝二人各引一軍，伏於祁山要路；放過魏兵，却從魏兵來路，殺奔魏寨而去。”二人引兵受計去了。又令馬岱、王平、張翼、張嶷四將，伏於寨外，四面迎擊魏兵。孔明乃虛立寨柵，居中堆起柴草，以備火號；自引諸將退於寨後，以觀動靜。,"But they said that Kong Ming returned to the account, and called Zhao Yun and Wei Yan to listen to the order first. Kong Ming said, ""The two of you will each lead their own troops to rob Wei Zhai."" Wei Yanjin said, ""Cao Zhen is very knowledgeable about the art of warfare, and he must expect me to take the funeral and rob the fort. Wouldn't he have a dike?"" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""I just want Cao Zhen to know. I am going to rob the village. He will ambush his troops behind Qishan and wait for my troops to pass, but they will attack my village. Therefore, I ordered the two of you to lead the troops forward, cross the back road at the foot of the mountain, and leave the camp far away, and let the Wei soldiers come to rob my village. You see the fire as a sign, and divide your troops into two paths: Chief Wen refused to hold on to the mountain pass, Zilong led his troops to fight back, he would meet Wei soldiers, but let him go back, you took advantage of the situation to attack him, and he would cover and kill himself: you can get a complete victory. ."" The second general led his troops away. He also called Guan Xing and Zhang Bao to pay them separately, saying: ""You two lead an army and lie down on the main road of Qishan; let the Wei soldiers go, but they come from the Wei soldiers and go to the Wei village."" Count to go. They also ordered four generals, Ma Dai, Wang Ping, Zhang Yi, and Zhang Yi, to lie down outside the fortress and attack the Wei soldiers on all sides. Kong Ming set up a fence and piled up firewood in the center to prepare for the fire.","Meanwhile Kong Ming hatches his own, even more convoluted plot of appearing to raid but actually setting his own ambush for the ambush! In fact, what happens is that when the two battalions of the Wei soldiers break into the Shu camp it is deserted, but in the darkness each thinks the other is the enemy troop, and they fall on each other, inflicting terrible losses on their own men. When they realize what has happened, they try to retreat, only to run into an attack by Zhao Zilong on one side and Wei Yan on the other.","When Zhuge Liang reached his tent, he called to him Zhao Yun and Wei Yan, and said to them, “You two are to make a night attack.” “Cao Zhen is a man of experience and will be on the lookout,” ventured Wei Yan. “But that is just what I want; I want him to know we shall attack tonight. He will then put some troops in hiding in rear of the Qishan Mountains, who will make for our camp as soon as they see us pass toward theirs. I am sending you to let yourselves be seen passing the hill. but you are to camp behind it and at a distance. When the soldiers of Wei attack this camp, you will see a signal. Then Wei Yan will hold the approach to the hill, and Zhao Yun will make his way back in fighting order. He will meet the army of Wei returning and will let them pass. The enemy will assuredly fall to fighting among themselves, and we shall finish the battle.” These two having gone away to carry out their portions of the plan, Zhuge Liang next called up Guan Xing and Zhang Bao: “You are to take each ten thousand troops and hide in the high road to the mountain. When the troops of Wei come, let them pass and then march along the road they came by to their camp that they have just left.” These two having left, Zhuge Liang placed Ma Dai, Wang Ping, Zhang Ni, and Zhang Yi in ambush about the camp. Within the camp the tents and shelters were left standing as if the camp was occupied, while wood and straw were heaped up ready to give the signal."
曹操回寨，却得曹仁死據定了寨柵，因此不曾多折軍馬。操入帳歎曰：“吾若殺了曹洪，今日必死於馬超之手也！”遂喚曹洪，重加賞賜。收拾敗軍，堅守寨柵；深溝高壘，不許出戰。超每日引兵來寨前辱罵搦戰，操傳令敎軍士堅守，如亂動者斬。諸將曰：“西涼之兵，盡使長鎗，當選弓弩迎之。”操曰：“戰與不戰，皆在於我，非在賊也。賊雖有長鎗，安能便刺？諸公但堅壁觀之，賊自退矣。”諸將皆私相議曰：“丞相自來征戰，一身當先；今敗於馬超，何如此之弱也？”過了幾日，細作報來：“馬超又添二萬生力兵來助戰，乃是羌人部落。”操聞知大喜。諸將曰：“馬超添兵，丞相反喜，何也？”操曰：“待吾勝了，却對汝等說。”三日後又報關上又添軍馬。操又大喜，就於帳中設宴作賀。諸將皆暗笑。操曰：“諸公笑我無破馬超之謀，公等有何良策？”徐晃進曰：“今丞相盛兵在此，賊亦全部見屯關上，此去河西，必無準備；若得一軍暗渡蒲阪津，先截賊歸路，丞相逕發河北擊之，賊兩不相應，勢必危矣。”操曰：“公明之言，正合吾意。”便敎徐晃引精兵四千，和朱靈同去逕襲河西，伏於山谷之中，待我渡河北同時擊之。徐晃、朱靈領命，先引四千軍暗暗去了。操下令，先敎曹洪於蒲阪津，安排船筏。留曹仁守寨，操自領兵渡渭河。早有細作報知馬超。超曰：“今操不攻潼關，而使人準備船筏，欲渡河北，必將遏吾之後也。吾當引一軍扣河拒住岸北。操兵不得渡，不消二十日，河東糧盡，操兵必亂，却循河南而擊之，操可擒矣。”韓遂曰：“不必如此。豈不聞兵法有云：‘兵半渡可擊。’待操兵渡至一半，汝却於南岸擊之，操兵皆死於河內矣。”超曰：“叔父之言甚善。”卽使人探聽曹操幾時渡河。,"Cao Cao returned to the village, but Cao Ren died and settled the village, so he did not lose many troops. Cao entered the tent and sighed, ""If I kill Cao Hong, I will die at the hands of Ma Chao today!"" So he called Cao Hong and gave him another reward. Pack up the defeated army and stick to the gates; deep trenches and high fortresses are not allowed to fight. Chao every day brings troops to the village to insult and fight, and he orders the sergeants to stick to it, like beheading those who disturb. The generals said: ""The soldiers of Xiliang should make full use of their spears, and choose bows and crossbows to meet them."" Cao said: ""Whether or not to fight, it is all up to me, not the thieves. Although the thieves have long spears, they will stab them when they can. The lords, but watch against the wall, and the thieves will retreat."" All the generals said to each other privately: ""The prime minister has come to fight, and he is the first; how can he be so weak now that he was defeated by Ma Chao?"" After a few days, he made a detailed report. Come: ""Ma Chao has added 20,000 new troops to help the battle, it's the Qiang tribe."" Cao heard that he was overjoyed. The generals said, ""Ma Chao has added troops, and the prime minister is overjoyed. Why?"" Cao said, ""I will tell you when I win."" Cao was overjoyed, so he held a banquet in the tent to congratulate him. All the generals laughed. Cao said, ""You gentlemen laugh at me that I have no plan to defeat Ma Chao, what is your good strategy?"" Xu Huangjin said, ""The prime minister is here with all his troops, and all the thieves have also seen the gates. If you go to Hexi, you will be unprepared. If you get an army. Crossing Pubanjin secretly, first intercept the thief's return route, and the prime minister will attack him in the opposite direction, and the thieves will not respond, and it will be in danger."" Cao said: ""Kong Ming's words are exactly what I want."" Xu Huang led four elite soldiers. Qian, together with Zhu Ling, went to attack the west of the river, and lay down in the valley, waiting for me to cross the river and attack him at the same time. Xu Huang and Zhu Ling took the lead and led the 4,000 troops to go in secret. Cao ordered that Cao Hong should be sent to Pubanjin first to arrange boats and rafts. Leaving Cao Ren to guard the village, Cao led his troops across the Wei River. Ma Chao has already made a detailed report. Chao said: ""Today I will not attack Tongguan, but have people prepare boats and rafts. If I want to cross the Hebei, I will definitely stop me. I should lead an army to hold the river to the north of the bank. I can't cross the river, and it will take twenty days to reach the east of the river. When the grain runs out, the troops will be in chaos, but if they follow Henan to attack them, they can be captured."" Han Sui said, ""It doesn't have to be like this. Don't you hear that there is a saying in the art of warfare: 'Half-crossing can be attacked.' However, you attacked him on the south bank, and all Cao Cao soldiers died in Hanoi."" Chao said, ""Uncle's words are very good."" You sent people to find out when Cao Cao was crossing the river.","he is being defended by none other than Cao Hong, who holds Ma Chao at bay until more men arrive to protect Cao Cao and Ma Chao retreats. It does not pass Cao Cao’s notice that, if he had executed Cao Hong, he himself would have died, and he rewards him handsomely. From now on Cao Cao holds back from any attack. News comes that Ma Chao has received twenty thousand Qiang tribesmen to reinforce his army, and Cao Cao, to the astonishment of his commander, smiles. Three days later comes news of more reinforcements for Ma Chao, and again Cao Cao smiles. Shortly after this, Xu Huang and Cao Cao agree on the following strategy. Because Ma Chao has all his troops stationed at the pass, the west bank of the River Wei is undefended. They decide to send a task force to seize the bank so they can cut off any retreat by Ma Chao’s men and then they will attack the enemy from the north of the River Wei. It doesn’t take long before Ma Chao realizes what is happening and moves to the attack to thwart Cao Cao as he manoeuvres his men into place.","Then Cao Cao was escorted to his camp defended by Cao Ren. He found the camps were still unharmed and the losses had not been great. As he sat in his tent, Cao Cao said, “Had I not spared Cao Hong, I should have fallen at the hands of Ma Chao today.” So he called in his rescuer and rewarded him well. And they got together the scattered troops and strengthened the camp, deepening the moat and raising the rampart. Ma Chao came daily and challenged any one to combat and abused them all shamefully, but, by the order of the Prime Minister, these insults were treated with silent contempt. “Our enemies use long spears,” said the officers. “We will meet them with bows and crossbows.” “They may have long spears,” replied Cao Cao, “but whether I give battle or not depends on my decision. How can they thrust at us if we do not go out? All you have to do is to take no notice of them, and they will speedily retire.” The officers wondered. They said one to another, “The Prime Minister came out on this expedition of his own will and was foremost in the fight; why does he accept defeat so easily?” After some days the spies reported: “Ma Chao has been reinforced by twenty thousand Qiangs, the tribespeople beyond the frontier.” Cao Cao took the news gleefully. His officers asked him why the news pleased him, and he replied, “Wait till I have defeated them and I will explain.” Three days later there was a report of further reinforcements, and Cao Cao not only smiled but gave a banquet. His officers ridiculed him in secret. Then said Cao Cao, “You gentlemen laugh because I cannot destroy Ma Chao. Well then, can any one of you propose a plan?” Then rose Xu Huang and said, “O Prime Minister, you have a large force here, and the enemy are strongly posted beyond the Pass. This means that on the west side of River Wei they are unprepared. If you can get an army secretly across the river and block the ferry, you will cut off their retreat; and if you can smite them on the north side of the river, they can get no reinforcements and must fail.” “What you propose is just what I think,” said Cao Cao. So Xu Huang was placed over four thousand troops, and with Zhu Ling, marched to the west of River Wei and hid in the gullies. They were to wait till Cao Cao crossed the river to the north so that both could strike together. Then Cao Cao ordered Cao Hong to prepare boats and rafts at the Reed Ferry. Cao Ren was left in command of the camps. Cao Cao himself crossed River Wei, and when Ma Chao heard of the new military movements, he said, “I understand. The Pass is left, rafts are being prepared; that means that he is going to cross to the north side and cut off my retreat. I must coast along the river and keep him off. If I can do that, his food will run short within twenty days, and that will cause a mutiny. I will travel along the south bank and attack.” Han Sui did not approve this plan. He quoted the military maxim to strike when troops were half over the river. “Attack from the south bank when his army is in the act of crossing, and his army will be drowned in the river,” said he. “Uncle, your words are good,” replied Ma Chao. And the spies went forth to find out the time of crossing the river."

Wan, the day is ready. The teams of people, surrounded by clouds and fog, all listened to Meng Huo's call. The Fulu Army found out about it and reported it to Kongming. Kong Ming smiled and said, ""I'm just trying to get all the barbarians to arrive, and see what I can do."" Exactly:","but perhaps they should have noticed that when Kong Ming is informed of this, he simply smiles.","In the meantime Meng Huo, puffed up with pride at getting off three times, hastened home to his own ravine, whence he sent trusted friends with gifts to the Eight Nations and the Ninety-three Sees and all the Mang quarters and clans to borrow shields and swords and warriors and braves.

They all assembled on an appointed day, massing like clouds and sweeping in like mists gathering on the mountains, each and all obeying the commands of the King Meng Huo.

Suddenly it was reported that someone had come from Chengdu, saying that Zhang Bao was dead. When Kong Ming heard this, he burst into tears, vomited blood, and fell unconscious to the ground. Everyone wakes up. Kong Ming has been bedridden since then. All generals are grateful. A later poem sighed and said:","Meanwhile, Kong Ming returns triumphantly home and sets about planning another invasion. This all falls apart when news comes that Zhang Bao has died of his head wounds. This breaks Kong Ming’s heart, and he weeps until he makes himself ill. As a poet has said:","Zhuge Liang led his victorious army to their camp. He intended to advance again, when a messenger arrived from Capital Chengdu with the sad news that Zhang Bao had died.

Xin Chang sighed and said, ""If I didn't ask my sister, I would have lost the righteousness!"" Later, a poem praised Xin Xianying and said:","It is not long before Cao Shuang, his brothers and their entire clan are executed.

Suddenly Sima Yi recalls that one member of the extended Cao clan whom he has not killed is the great warrior Xiahou Xuan, who undoubtedly could be a threat.","After Cao Shuang had suffered death, Jiang Ji said to Sima Yi, “Xin Chang and Luu Zhi and others who had been of his party had forced the gate and joined the rebels. Yang Zong had opposed the surrender of the seal of the late minister.

All the officials were standing outside the door, and when they saw it, the main face was filled with joy. After the Lord said goodbye to Kong Ming, he got on the imperial carriage and returned to the DPRK. Everyone was puzzled. Kong Ming saw that one of the officials looked up to the sky and smiled, and his face also had a happy expression. Kong Ming regarded him as a new savage in Yiyang: his surname was Deng, his name was Zhi, and his word was Bomiao. Kong Mingyin made Deng Zhi stay. Many officials are scattered. Kong Ming invited Zhi to the academy and asked Zhi, ""Now Shu, Wei, and Wu Ding are divided into three kingdoms. If you want to discuss the two kingdoms and unite Zhongxing, which country should you attack first?"" Zhi said, ""On a foolish point of view, Wei is a traitor of the Han Dynasty. , its power is very large, and it is difficult to shake it. It should be taken slowly and slowly. Now that the Lord has ascended to the throne for the first time, the people's hearts are not at ease. It is time to unite with Eastern Wu, become lips and teeth, and wash away the old grievances of the former emperor. This is a long-term plan. What is the Prime Minister's intention?"" Kong Ming laughed and said, ""I've been thinking about it for a long time, but I haven't gotten it yet—I can't get it today!"" Zhi said, ""What does the Prime Minister want him to do?"" Kong Ming said, ""I want to get someone to do it. Go to the Eastern Wu. If Gong Yan can understand this meaning, he will definitely not disgrace the emperor's order. It is necessary for him to be appointed as an official."" Zhi said: ""The foolish talent has a shallow wisdom, and I may not be able to take this position."" Kong Ming said: ""I In the coming days, I will tell you about the Son of Heaven, and I will invite Bo Miao and his party, and don't refuse."" Zhi agreed and left. On the next day, Kong Ming made the appointment of the queen, and sent Deng Zhi to talk about Soochow. Zhi bid farewell, looking forward to Soochow. Exactly:","A mightily relieved second ruler leaves Kong Ming. As he goes, Kong Ming notices one official, Deng Zhi, who seems to be amused. Kong Ming stops him leaving and invites him into his inner chamber. ‘We now have three kingdoms,’ says Kong Ming, ‘Shu, Wei and Wu. My plan is to restore the Han dynasty by subduing both of the other kingdoms. Which one should I attack first?’ To this Deng Zhi replies, ‘Wei’s too strong at present. Our new ruler is young, and no one is yet sure about him. So let’s not rush. Instead, let us mend fences with Wu and combine our efforts. After all, we no longer have to worry about the late ruler’s quest for revenge. In the long run this will be to our advantage.’ Kong Ming is delighted and asks Deng Zhi if he is willing to go to Wu. Although he protests that he is not very experienced in such affairs, he is persuaded and the next day accepts the mission from the second ruler.","They two drank a few cups of wine together, and the Prime Minister escorted his master to his chariot. A ring of courtiers were waiting, and they could not help remarking the happiness that shone in their master's face. The Latter Ruler took his leave and returned to his palace, but the courtiers did not know what to think. Now Zhuge Liang had noted a certain man among the crowd who smiled and looked quite happy. Zhuge Liang looked at him intently and then recollected his name, which was Deng Zhi of Xinye, a descendant of Regent Marshal Deng Yu of Han. Zhuge Liang sent a man privately to detain Deng Zhi, and when all the others had gone, Zhuge Liang led him into the library for a chat. Presently he came to the matter near his heart. “The three states have become a fact,” said Zhuge Liang. “Now if our state wanted to absorb the other two and restore the condition of one rule, which country should it attack first?” “Though Wei is the real rebel, yet Wei is strong and would be very difficult to overthrow. Any move against it would have to develop slowly. As our Emperor has but lately succeeded his father and the people are none too decided in his favor, I should propose a treaty of mutual defense with Wu. This would obliterate the enmity of His late Majesty and would have important results. However, you, Sir, may have another opinion. What is it?” “That is what I have been thinking of this long time, but I had not the person for the task. Now I have found him.” “What do you want the person to do?” said Deng Zhi. “I want him to go as envoy to Wu to negotiate such a treaty. As you understand the position so well, you will surely do honor to your prince's commission as envoy. There is no other who would succeed.” “I fear I am not equal to such a task: I am not clever enough and too ignorant.” “I will inform the Emperor tomorrow and beg him to appoint you. Of course you will accept.” Deng Zhi consented and then took his leave. As promised, Zhuge Liang memorialized, and the Latter Ruler consented that the mission should be entrusted to Deng Zhi. And he started."

Wang Jing's mother and son were tortured with a smile. All the people in the city were weeping. A later poem says:","Likewise, Wang Jing and his entire family were executed.","Wang Jing's whole household were imprisoned. He himself was standing in the courthouse when he saw his mother, Lady Zhao, being brought up a prisoner.

Loyalty rose up, went out of the tent and got on the horse. Feng Xi and others persuaded: ""Old general, please stop advancing lightly."" Zhong refused to listen, and rode away. Wu Ban ordered Feng Xi to lead troops to assist in the battle. Zhong was in front of the Wu army, reined in his horse, and fought with the vanguard Pan Zhang. Zhang Yin Department will go to the historical site. Ji deceived Zhong when he was old, and went out to fight with a gun; Pan Zhang was furious, and waved the Guanlong sword of the minister to fight against Huang Zhong. The number of horses is combined, and there is no winner. Zhong fought hard and fought hard, but Zhang was no match for him, so he turned his horse and left. Zhong took advantage of the situation to chase and kill, and returned with a complete victory. The road meets Guan Xing and Zhang Bao. Xing said: ""I am here to help the old general by the imperial decree; Yan has already made a merit, please return to the camp quickly."" Zhong did not listen.","Arriving at Wu Ban’s camp, he is asked why he has come and tells them in no uncertain terms that he is fit enough and strong enough for war. When news comes that the troops of Wu are approaching, he swings himself back into the saddle and rides to battle. Wu Ban orders Feng Xi to follow him and to try to protect him. The enemy forces are commanded by Pan Zhang. Seeing this, Huang Zhong challenges him to single combat. Pan Zhang is no match for the old warrior. Pan retreats, pursued by Huang Zhong. Having seen him off, Huang Zhong returns triumphantly to his own side to be met by Zhang Bao and Guan Xing. They tell him they have been ordered by the first ruler to bring him safely home. Huang Zhong simply ignores them!","Just about that time the leading division of the Wu army drew near the camp. Huang Zhong hastily rose, went out of the tent, and mounted to go into the battle. “Aged General, be careful,” said the generals. But Huang Zhong paid no attention and set off at full speed. However, Wu Ban and Feng Xi rode out to help him. As soon as he saw the array of the enemy, he pulled up and challenged Commander Pan Zhang of the vanguard. Pan Zhang sent out one of his generals, Shi Ji, to take the challenge. Shi Ji despised his seed antagonist and rode lightly forth with his spear set, but in the third bout Huang Zhong cut him down. This angered Pan Zhang who flourished the green-dragon saber, the great sword of the old warrior Guan Yu which had passed into his possession, and took up the battle. These two fought several bouts, and neither was victor, for Huang Zhong was brimful of energy. His antagonist, seeing that he could not overcome the old man, galloped off. Huang Zhong pursued and smote his army and scored a full victory. On his way back Huang Zhong fell in with the two youthful generals, Guan Xing and Zhang Bao. “We come by the sacred command to aid you if necessary. And now that you have scored so complete a victory, we pray you return to the main camp,” said they. But the veteran would not."

The person who is hated by the Lord of Shu today is Ma Zhong'er; why not kill him and dedicate his head to the Lord of Shu, saying: 'I waited for the last resort to surrender to Wu, and now I know that the imperial car is coming, and I specially went to the camp to plead guilty.'"" Ren said: ""No, there will be disasters if you go."" Fang said: ""The Lord of Shu is merciful and virtuous; now Prince Adou is my nephew. , but he only thinks of the affection of our country, and he will not do harm."" The two of them had already made up their minds and prepared their horses first. At the third watch, they entered the tent to assassinate Ma Zhong, and cut off the head. The two of them brought dozens of horses and went straight to the Xiaoting Pavilion. Soldiers on the road, first introduced Zhang Nan and Feng Xi, and talked about it. The next day, he went to the imperial camp to meet the First Sovereign, presented Ma Zhong's head, and cried out in front of him: ""The ministers have no remorse; they were tricked by Lü Meng, saying that the Duke of Guan was dead, and the gates of the city were opened, so the ministers and the others had no choice but to do so. And come down. Now I hear that the holy car is coming, and I will kill this thief, out of the hatred of Your Majesty Xue. Your Majesty Fu Qi forgives the sins of the ministers and others."" The First Lord was furious and said, ""When I have been away from Chengdu for a long time, why don't you two? Come to plead guilty? The situation is in danger today, so I come here to speak eloquently, and want to save my life! If I spare you, under the Jiuquan, how can I see Guan Gonghu!"" After saying this, Guan Xing was ordered to set up Guan Gong's spiritual position in the imperial camp. The First Sovereign personally held Ma Zhong's head and made sacrifices before him. Guan Xing also ordered Guan Xing to strip Mi Fang and Fu Shiren of their clothes, knelt in front of the spirit, and personally stabbed him with a knife to sacrifice Guan Gong. Suddenly Zhang Bao went up to the tent and cried in front of him and said, ""The two uncles have all been executed; when will the grievances of the minister and father be repaid?"" , I will capture the two thieves, and I will consecrate them with you personally to sacrifice to your father."" Bao weeping and thanking him, he left.","They complain that they have been fooled into following Wu in the attack on Guan Yu. They decide that if they can kill the two traitors Mi Fang and Fu Shiren, then they might win the approval and forgiveness of the new first ruler. Overhearing this, Mi Fang decides to pre-empt the plot, and he and Fu Shiren creep into Ma Zhong’s tent late that night and murder him, cutting off his head. Then they make good their escape with a handful of followers, hoping to win the first ruler’s approval and forgiveness for their crime. But this is not to be. Brought before the first ruler, they say, ‘We didn’t mean to rebel. It was all Lü Meng’s fault. He told us Guan Yu was already dead and tricked us into opening the gate and surrendering. So this is why we have come to you with the head of the traitor, so your revenge has been fulfilled, and we humbly beg your forgiveness.’ Incandescent with rage, the first ruler rises from his throne and says, ‘So why didn’t you come to me before now? You come now, full of your lies, because you’re terrified for your lives. If I were to forgive you, to let you go free, how could I face the spirit of Guan Yu in the abode of the Nine Springs of Hell!’ So orders are given to prepare an altar with the image of Guan Yu upon it. The first ruler personally carries the head of Ma Zhong and offers it on the altar. Then he orders Guan Xing to strip Mi Fang and Fu Shiren and make then kneel down. There, before the altar to his father, Guan Xing cuts the two men into pieces as a sacrifice to his father. This leaves Zhang Bao desperate to avenge his own father, and he asks when he too can have revenge.","Mi Fang started as he heard this. He told Fu Shiren, saying, “The troops are mutinous, and we ourselves are in danger. Ma Zhong is an object of especial hatred to the Ruler of Shu; suppose we kill him and surrender. We can say we were compelled to give in to Wu, but as soon as the news of the Emperor came near we wanted to get back.” “It will not do,” said Fu Shiren. “If we go, they will kill us.” “No; the Ruler of Shu is liberal and kind. And the heir, Liu Shan, is my nephew. They will surely not do any harm to a connection.” In the end they decided to go. And in the third watch they made their way into their chief's tent and stabbed him to death. Then they cut off his head, and with their grisly trophy and a few followers they set off for the camp of the Ruler of Shu. They arrived at the outposts and were taken to see Zhang Nan and Feng Xi, to whom they told their tale. Next day they went into the main camp and were admitted to the presence of the First Ruler, to whom they offered their trophy. And they threw themselves on the ground and wept, saying “We are not traitors. We were the victims of Lu Meng's wickedness. He said that Guan Yu was dead and tricked us into giving up the city. We could not help surrendering. When we heard the Sacred Chariot had come, we slew Ma Zhong to satisfy your vengeance, and we implore forgiveness.” But the First Ruler was angry, and said, “I left Chengdu a long time ago; why did you not come to confess your fault before? Now you find yourselves in danger and so you come with this specious tale to try to save your lives. If I pardon you, how shall I look my brother in the face when we meet beneath the Nine Golden Springs?” Then he bade Guan Xing set up an altar to his father in the camp, and thereon the First Ruler offered the head of Ma Zhong in sacrifice before the tablet of Guan Yu. This done, he had Guan Xing strip the two deserters make them kneel before the altar, and presently with his own hand he hewed them in pieces as a sacrifice. Presently Zhang Bao came in and wailed before him, saying, “The two enemies of my uncle have been slain, but when will vengeance be taken upon those of my father?” “Do not grieve, my nephew,” said the First Ruler, “I am going to lay waste the South Land and slay the whole of the curs that live there. I will assuredly capture the two murderers of your father, and you shall hack them to pieces as a sacrifice.” Zhang Bao went away, still weeping."

When Kongming had finished entering the city, he asked, ""Who will guard this city with the public so that it is safe?"" The couple said, ""A certain person who has obtained this county today is all from Yongchang Buwei, whose surname is Lu, whose name is Kai, and whose courtesy name is Ji. Ping: It's all the power of this person."" Kong Ming then invited Lu Kai to come. When Kai entered and saw the ceremony, Kong Ming said, ""I have heard for a long time that the Duke is a high-ranking scholar in Yongchang. Thanks to the Duke for protecting the city. Now that I want to pacify the barbarians, what is the point of the Duke?"" , Knowing that the southerners have been wanting to rebel for a long time; so they secretly sent people into their territory to see where the troops could be fighting, and drew a picture called 'Pingman's palm map'. Now I dare to offer it to Duke Ming. Duke Ming will try to observe it. : It can also help one of the savages."" Kong Ming was overjoyed, so he used Lu Kai as the military commander, and he was also the commander of the army. So Kong Ming raised his troops and advanced into the southern barbarian realm.","‘Well,’ says Kong Ming, ‘if you were to bring me the head of Zhu Bao I could of course then trust you.’ Gao Ding and E Huan take off to do exactly that. When they confront Zhu Bao, he is of course totally at a loss as to what they are talking about. With one swipe of E Huan’s halberd, Zhu Bao is beheaded, and all his men submit. Kong Ming is delighted when Gao Ding brings him Zhu Bao’s head.","Governor Wang Kang of Yongchang then came out of the city and welcomed Zhuge Liang; and, when Zhuge Liang had made his entry into that city, he called Wang Kang and asked, “Who has aided you in the defense of this city?” The Governor said, “The safety of this city is due entirely to Lu Kai.” So Lu Kai was called. He came and bowed. Zhuge Liang said, “Long since I heard of you as a remarkable person of this area. We are greatly indebted to you for its safety. Now we wish to conquer the Mangs; have you any advice to offer?” Lu Kai then produced a map of the country and presented it, saying, “From the time of my appointment, I have felt certain that the southern tribespeople would rise against you, and so I sent secret agents to map out the country and find the strategic points. From that information I prepared this map, which I call 'The Plan to Subdue the Mangs.' I beg you, Sir, to accept it, as it may be of use.” Then Zhuge Liang took Lu Kai into his service as Military Adviser and Guide. With Lu Kai's help, Zhuge Liang advanced and penetrated deeply into the country."
却說譙周官居太史，頗明天文；見孔明又欲出師，乃奏後主曰：“臣今職掌司天臺，但有禍福，不可不奏：近有羣鳥數萬，自南飛來，投於漢水而死，此不祥之兆。臣又觀天象，見奎星躔於太白之分，盛氣在北，不利伐魏。又成都人民，皆聞柏樹夜哭：有此數般災異，丞相只宜謹守，不可妄動。”孔明曰：“吾受先帝託孤之重，當竭力討賊，豈可以虛妄之災氛，而廢國家大事耶？”遂命有司設太牢祭於昭烈之廟，涕泣拜告曰：“臣亮五出祁山，未得寸土，負罪非輕！今臣復統全師，再出祁山，誓竭力盡心，剿滅漢賊，恢復中原，鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已！”祭畢，拜辭後主，星夜至漢中，聚集諸將商議出師。忽報關興病亡。孔明放聲大哭，昏倒於地，半晌方甦。衆將再三勸解，孔明歎曰：“可憐忠義之人，天不與以壽！我今番出師，又少一員大將也！”後人有詩歎曰：,"However, he said that Qiao Zhou was an official in Taishi, and he was quite literate. When he saw that Kongming wanted to become a teacher again, he played and said, ""This minister is now in charge of the roof, but there are blessings and misfortunes, so I must play: There are tens of thousands of birds flying from the south. Died in the Han River, this is an ominous omen. The minister also observed the sky and saw that Kui Xing was lying in the Taibai part, and his vigor was in the north, which was not conducive to attacking Wei. And the people of Chengdu heard the cypress tree crying at night: there are so many disasters The prime minister should only be cautious and not act rashly."" Kong Ming said, ""I have been entrusted by the late emperor with the utmost importance, and I should try my best to hunt down the thieves. How can I be deceitful and abolish the affairs of the state?"" Liezhi Temple, weeping and saluting, said: ""Chen Liang went out of Qishan five years ago, but he didn't get an inch of land, so the guilt is not light! Today, I will return to the whole division and go out of Qishan again. After death!"" After the sacrifice, he said goodbye to the queen, Xingye went to Hanzhong in the night, and gathered all the generals to discuss the apprenticeship. Sudden declaration of prosperity and death. Kong Ming burst into tears, passed out and fell to the ground, Fang Su after a long while. The generals tried to persuade them again and again, Kong Ming sighed and said: ""Pity the loyal and righteous people, God will not live with you! I am a teacher this time, and there is one less general!"" Later, a poem sighed:","Qiao Zhou, as the official astrologer for the court, reports that inauspicious signs have been seen. For example, thousands of birds drowning themselves are clearly a warning, while at the same time astrological signs indicate good fortune for the Wei dynasty. In the city people are saying they have heard the cypress trees crying at night. He urges no action in the light of these signs, which seem to favour peace and the Wei kingdom rather than the Shu. But Kong Ming dismisses these as ‘inconsequential’ and certainly not enough to deflect duty. Instead he offers sacrifices at the temple of the first ruler, Xuande, declaring that he has tried five times to fulfil the command to suppress the north and restore the Han and that he will now try to do this for the sixth time. From the temple he goes straight to Hanzhong to prepare. Upon arrival, he is profoundly distressed to hear of the death of Guan Xing as a result of illness. As a poet has said:","This is an evil augury. Moreover, I have studied the aspect of the sky, and the 'Wolf' constellation is influencing the aspect of the planet Venus. An aura of prosperity pervades the north. To attack Wei will not be to our profit. Again, the people in Chengdu say that the cypress trees moan in the night. With so many evil omens, I wish that the Prime Minister should not go forth to war, but remain at home to guard what we have.” “How can I?” said Zhuge Liang. “His late Majesty laid upon me a heavy responsibility, and I must exert myself to the utmost in the endeavor to destroy these rebels. The policy of a state cannot be changed because of vain and irresponsible talk of inauspicious signs.” Zhuge Liang was not to be deterred. He instructed the officials to prepare the Great Bovine Sacrifice in the Dynastic Temple. Then, weeping, he prostrated himself and made this declaration: “Thy servant Zhuge Liang has made five expeditions to Qishan without gaining any extension of territory. His fault weighs heavily upon him. Now once again he is about to march, pledged to use every effort of body and mind to exterminate the rebels against the Han House, and to restore to the dynasty its ancient glory in its old capital. To achieve this end, he would use the last remnant of his strength and could die content.” The sacrifice ended, he took leave of the Latter Ruler and set out for Hanzhong to make the final arrangements for his march. While so engaged, he received the unexpected news of the death of Guan Xing. He was greatly shocked, and fainted. When he had recovered consciousness, his officers did their utmost to console him. “How pitiful! Why does Heaven deny long life to the loyal and good? I have lost a most able general just as I am setting out and need him most.” As all are born, so all must die;"

Xun's real name was Lu Yi, later changed his name to Xun, and his courtesy name was Boyan. Eight feet in length, with a face as beautiful as jade. The official led the town west general. Called now. After visiting the pilgrimage, Quan said, ""Now that the soldiers of Shu are approaching the territory, Gu Te ordered the governor to supervise the army and horses to defeat Liu Bei."" Xun said, ""Jiangdong Wen and Wu are all old ministers of the great king; if the ministers are young and incapable, can they control them?"" Quan Said: ""Kan Derun protects his family with his whole family, and he is alone and knows his talents. Now he is serving him as a great governor, and he will not refuse."" Those who do not obey the orders will be executed first and then singed.” Xun said, “Homong is heavily entrusted, dare not to obey orders? The congregation at the altar will be given a white and yellow yoke, a military talisman with a seal and a ribbon, and then they will be ordered to be solemn. Now, the king should follow this ceremony, choose a day to build the altar, and worship Bo Yan as the great governor. Quan Congzhi ordered people to build a complete altar overnight, congregate hundreds of officials, invite Lu Xun to the altar, worship as the great governor, the general of Youhujun Zhenxi, make him the marquis of Lou, give him a sword and seal, and command the six prefectures, eighty-one prefectures and Jingjing. , Chu Zhulu military horses. The King of Wu instructed him, ""Within the walls, the solitary masters; outside the walls, the generals rule.""","This young man is called Lu Xun. His appointment is deeply unpopular with martial advisers such as Zhang Zhao. Indeed, when Lu Xun takes up his post, there is widespread mockery and disdain among the military officers. But despite this, Sun Quan gives him full authority on the battlefield. His arrival at the front leads to even more mockery, but the officers have no option but to obey. They raise the issue of Sun Huan being trapped at Yiling and needing urgently to be rescued, but Lu Xun refuses to go to his aid, saying that he can look after himself until the western forces have been beaten.","he is the man. Gentlemen, that is enough.” Lu Xun was called home. Lu Xun was originally named Lu Yi. He was a native of Wu County in Wu, grandson of Lu Jun, who was Commandant of the City Gates, and son of Lu Yu, Commander of Jiujiang. He was eight spans in height, with a beautiful face, like the finest jade. When Lu Xun arrived at court and made his bow, Sun Quan said to him, “I wish to send you in supreme command of all the forces against Shu.” “Sir, you have numerous old and tried officers under your command; I am very young and not at all clever,” replied Lu Xun. “Kan Ze goes bail for you and pledges his whole house. Moreover, I know your abilities. You must be Commander-in-Chief and may not refuse the appointment.” “But what will happen if the officers do not support me?” “Here is authority!” said Sun Quan, taking his own sword from his side and giving it to Lu Xun. “Slay the disobedient and report afterwards.” “I am grateful for this proof of confidence, but I dare not accept forthwith. I pray you assemble all the officers and confer the office upon me in their presence.” Said Kan Ze, “The ancient fashion was to set up a platform and thereon present to the leader-elect a white yak's tail and a golden ax with the seal of office and commission. Thereafter his dignity and the reverence due from others were beyond all question. It would be well, O Prince, to follow the old rule. Choose a good day and appoint Lu Xun before all the world, and no one will refuse support.” An altar was begun at once. They worked at it day and night, and as soon as it was finished a great assembly was called. Then Lu Xun was requested to ascend and make his bow on receiving his appointment as Commander-in-Chief, Leader of the Senior, General Who Guards the West, and Lord of Fenglou. The sword of authority and the seal of office were presented. His powers extended over the six territories and the eighty-one counties of the South Land, over the forces in Jingzhou and Wu.

He blocked the main road at the entrance of the cave, and there were soldiers inside. The mountains were so steep that they could not advance."" Kong Ming asked Lu Kai to ask. Kai said, ""I heard that there is a road to this cave, but I don't know the details."" Jiang Wan said, ""Meng Huo has been captured four times, and he has lost his nerve, so he dares to go out again? The weather is hot today, and the troops and horses are tired, so the expedition is useless. The teacher will return to the country."" Kong Ming said: ""If this is the case, Meng Huo's plan is in the middle. As soon as our army retreats, he will take advantage of the situation to chase after him. Now that we have arrived here, is there any reason to return?"" The front; however, the new savage soldiers were taught to lead the way, looking for the northwest path to enter. When I came to a spring, people and horses were all thirsty, fighting to drink this water. Wang Ping explored this way and repaid Kongming. Compared to the time of Dazhai, he couldn't speak, but only pointed.","But Kong Ming has come this far and knows that to turn back, even with these terrible conditions, will mean defeat. So he is, of course, eager to see if there is any way into Bald Dragon ravine. Wang Ping is sent with a detachment to try the track route but in desperation in the wilderness they drink from the first of the deadly springs and are struck dumb. Local people tell them they are doomed to die within a week or two.","In leathern jerkin donned for war. Just at the moment of setting out southward, the spies brought news of Meng Huo's retreat into the Bald Dragon Ravine and the barricading of one entrance. They also said, “The valley is garrisoned, the hills are precipitous and even impassable.” So Zhuge Liang called in Lu Kai and questioned him, but he did not know exactly the conditions. Then out spoke Jiang Wan, saying, “Meng Huo's repeated captures have broken his spirit so that he dare not take the field again. Our soldiers are exhausted with this intense heat, and little is to be gained by prolonging the campaign. The best move would be to return to our own country.” “If we do this, we shall fall victims to Meng Huo's scheme,” said Zhuge Liang. “If we retreated, he would certainly follow. Beside, having advanced so far, it would be fruitless to turn back now.” Wang Ping was sent on with the advanced guard and some of the Mangs as guides to seek an entrance on the northwest. They found the road and came to the first spring—the Dumb Spring—, of which the thirsty men and horses drank freely. Wang Ping returned to report his success, but by the time he reached camp, he and all his soldiers were speechless. They could only point to their mouths."

When Ling Tong saw Gan Ning's merits, he said eagerly, ""Tong wishes to be the enemy of Zhang Liao."" Quan promised him. The commander then led five thousand troops, and left Shusu. Quan Zi cited Gan Ning to watch the battle. Against Yuan Chu, Zhang Liao went out, with Li Dian on the left and Le Jin on the right. Ling Tong straightened his horse with his sword and went out to the front of the formation. Zhang Liao sent music in and out to welcome him. The two fought to fifty, and there was no winner. When Cao Cao heard about it, he personally rode his horse to the gate to see it. Seeing the two generals fighting fiercely, he ordered Cao Xiu to secretly release cold arrows. Cao Xiu dodged behind Zhang Liao, opened a bow and arrow, and Ling Tong sat down in the middle. The horse stood upright and overturned Ling Tong to the ground. Le Jin hurriedly stabbed with a gun. Before the gun arrived, only the sound of the bowstring could be heard, and an arrow hit Le Jin in front of the door, turning over and falling from the horse. The two armies went out together, and each rescued a general and returned to the camp. Ming Jin strikes. Ling Tong returned to the village to thank Sun Quan. Quan said, ""Gan Ning is the one who released the arrow to save you."" Ling Tong nodded his head and bowed to Ning and said, ""I don't want the Duke to be so kind!"" Since then, he and Gan Ning have become friends of life and death, and will never do evil again.","The following day Zhang Liao rides out and challenges the enemy. Ling Tong, spurred on by jealousy of Gan Ning’s success the night before, responds by charging into single combat battle with Zhang Liao’s companion Yue Jin. Their confrontation is heated, but after fifty bouts neither has gained the upper hand. Hearing of this confrontation, leaders on both sides come to watch the contest, and at a critical moment Cao Cao secretly orders Cao Xiu to fire an arrow at Ling Tong. The arrow brings down his horse, and Yue Jin races forward with his spear raised to slay Ling Tong. But at the crucial moment, in response, an arrow flies out from the southerners and hits Yue Jin in the face. In agony he falls from his horse. In the ensuing chaos men rush forward from both sides to rescue their own people and bring the battle to an end. When Ling Tong comes to Sun Quan to apologize for having failed, he is quietly told that his life was saved by that arrow. To his astonishment he is told that it was fired by none other than Gan Ning. From that day on the old feud is forgotten, and they became bosom pals.","Sun Quan was very proud of his subordinate's doughty deed, and said, “Cao Cao may have his Zhang Liao, but I can match him with my friend Gan Ning.” Soon Zhang Liao came to proffer another challenge, and Ling Tong, impatient at being excelled by his rival and enemy, begged that he might go out to fight. His request was granted, and he marched out a short distance from Ruxu with five thousand troops. Sun Quan, with Gan Ning in his train, went out to look on at the encounter. When both armies had come out on the plain and were arrayed, Zhang Liao, with Li Dian and Yue Jin, one on either side, advanced to the front. Ling Tong, sword in hand, galloped out towards him and, at Zhang Liao's command, Yue Jin took the challenge and went to open the combat. They fought half a hundred bouts, and neither seemed to have the better of the other. Then Cao Cao, hearing of the great contest going on, rode up to the battlefield and took position under the great standard, whence he could see the fighting. Seeing both combatants were waxing desperate, he thought to decide the struggle by an unfair blow. He bade Cao Xiu let fly a secret arrow, which he did by creeping up under cover of Zhang Liao. It struck Ling Tong's steed, which reared and threw its rider. Yue Jin dashed forward to thrust at the fallen warrior with his spear, but before the blow could be given, the twang of another bow was heard and an arrow speeding by hit Yue Jin full in the face. He fell from his horse. Then both sides rushed forward to rescue their champions; the gongs clanged, and the combat ceased. Ling Tong returned to his camp and reported himself to his master. “The arrow that saved you was shot by Gan Ning,” said Sun Quan. Ling Tong turned to his rival and bowed low. “I could not have supposed you would have rendered me such a service, Sir,” said he to Gan Ning. This episode ended the strife and enmity between the two leaders, who thereafter swore perpetual friendship."
却說漢中王令魏延總督軍馬，守禦東川。遂引百官回成都。差官起造宮庭，又置館舍，自成都至白水，共建四百餘處館舍亭郵。廣積糧草，多造軍器，以圖進取中原。細作人探聽得曹操結連東吳，欲取荊州，卽飛報入蜀。漢中王忙請孔明商議。孔明曰：“某已料曹操必有此謀；然吳中謀士極多，必敎操令曹仁先興兵矣。”漢中王曰：“似此如之奈何？”孔明曰：“可差使命就送官誥與雲長，令先起兵取樊城，使敵軍膽寒，自然瓦解矣。”漢中王大喜，卽差前部司馬費詩為使，齎捧誥命投荊州來。雲長出郭，迎接入城。至公廨禮畢，雲長問曰：“漢中王封我何爵？”詩曰：“‘五虎大將’之首。”雲長曰：“那五虎將？”詩曰：“關、張、趙、馬、黃是也。”雲長怒曰：“翼德吾弟也；孟起世代名家；子龍久隨吾兄，卽吾弟也：位與吾相並，可也。黃忠何等人，敢與吾同列！大丈夫終不與老卒為伍！”遂不肯受印。詩笑曰：“將軍差矣：昔蕭何、曹參與高祖同舉大事，最為親近，而韓信乃楚之亡將也；然信位為王，居蕭、曹之上，未聞蕭、曹以此為怨。今漢中王雖有‘五虎將’之封，而與將軍有兄弟之義，視同一體。將軍卽漢中王，漢中王卽將軍也。豈與諸人等哉？將軍受漢中王厚恩，當與同休戚、共禍福，不宜計較官號之高下：願將軍熟思之。”雲長大悟，乃再拜曰：“某之不明，非足下見敎，幾誤大事。”卽拜受印綬。,"However, the king of Hanzhong ordered Wei Yan to supervise the army and horses to guard Dongchuan. He then led hundreds of officials back to Chengdu. The officials built palaces, and then built the buildings. From Chengdu to Baishui, more than 400 buildings and pavilions were built. Accumulate food and grass, build more weapons, in order to enter the Central Plains. The careful investigation led Cao Cao to connect with Soochow Wu and wanted to take Jingzhou, so he flew to Shu. The King of Hanzhong hurriedly asked Kong Ming to discuss. Kong Ming said: ""Someone has expected that Cao Cao must have this plan; however, there are many advisers in Wuzhong, so he must order Cao Ren to raise his army first."" Send the official Gao and Yunchang, and order the army to take Fancheng first, which will make the enemy army tremble and disintegrate naturally."" The king of Hanzhong was overjoyed, and he sent Sima Feishi from the front as his envoy, and he took the Gao's order and went to Jingzhou. Cloud grows out of Guo and welcomes him into the city. After the ceremony was over, Yun Chang asked, ""What title did the king of Hanzhong confer on me?"" The poem said: ""The head of the 'Five Tiger Generals'."" Yun Chang asked, ""What about the five tiger generals?"" Zhang, Zhao, Ma, and Huang are the same."" Yun Chang said angrily: ""Yide is my younger brother; Meng Qi has been a famous family from generation to generation; Zilong has been with my brother for a long time, and my younger brother is also: my position is the same as mine, that's okay. Huang. Zhonghe and others, dare to rank with me! A gentleman will never be in the company of an old soldier!"" So he refused to accept the seal. The poem laughed and said, ""The generals are bad: in the past, Xiao He and Cao participated in the great event of the great ancestor and were the closest, and Han Xin was the fallen general of Chu; however, Xin was the king, above Xiao and Cao, and had never heard of Xiao or Cao Yi. This is resentment. Although the king of Hanzhong has the title of 'Five Tiger Generals', he and the general are brothers, and they are regarded as one. You should share weal and woe and good fortune with the same people, and it is not appropriate to care about the superiority of the official title: I hope the general will think about it carefully."" Yun Chang realized, and then bowed again and said: ""Something is unclear. Printing ribbon.","‘Let’s send a letter to Sun Quan suggesting he attacks and captures Jingzhou, which will mean Xuande will have to rush to its defence, and we can easily recapture Hanzhong.’ Cao Cao is much taken with this suggestion, and so it is agreed. Adviser Man Chong is chosen to take the letter to Sun Quan. Upon receipt of the proposal Sun Quan and his advisers decide that this is too good an offer to refuse. Man Chong returns with this news, while Sun Quan also decides to see what Guan Yu is up to in Jingzhou. He sends Kong Ming’s brother Zhuge Jin to ask Guan Yu for the hand of his daughter in marriage to his son. The proposal is met with total horror by Guan Yu. ‘ Marry my tiger’s child to a mere mongrel’s offspring! Why, if it wasn’t for the fact that your brother is Kong Ming I would have had you executed!’ and with that Zhuge Jin is driven out of the city. So plans are laid by Sun Quan and Cao Cao to attack, starting with Man Chong going to Fancheng to prepare for an assault on Jingzhou in partnership with Cao Ren. This is Sun Quan’s ploy for using the troops of Cao Cao to soften up the enemy resistance. When Xuande hears of the pact between Cao Cao and Sun Quan, he asks Kong Ming what to do next. ‘Well, this isn’t exactly a surprise,’ says Kong Ming. ‘And you can be sure that Sun Quan’s advisers are behind the plan that Cao Ren attacks first. So let’s send a messenger to Guan Yu and have him attack and capture Fancheng itself. That should put the cat among the pigeons and break up this alliance.’","Having laid on Wei Yan the task of holding the Eastern Land of Rivers, the Prince of Hanzhong, with his officers, returned to Chengdu and began to set his new house in order. A palace was begun and public guest-houses were built, and between Chengdu and Baishui, at selected places, they built four hundred rest-houses and post stations. The Prince of Hanzhong also set himself to accumulate great stores of grain and forage and to till his arsenals with weapons with the design of mastering the capital in the north and the whole empire. Then his spies told him of the treaty between Cao Cao and Sun Quan, with designs upon Jingzhou, and he hastily called in Zhuge Liang to ask what should be done. “I felt that Cao Cao would try to do this,” said Zhuge Liang, “and most of the advisers in the South Land will persuade Cao Cao to order Cao Ren to begin the campaign.” “But what am I to do?” asked the Prince. “First send a special messenger to Guan Yu with his new title, telling him to capture Fankou, which will so damp the ardor of the enemy that they will break off themselves.” Therefore Liu Bei sent Fei Shi, a minister from his Board of War, to take the patent of the new title to Guan Yu, who received the delegate with great deference and conducted him into the city. After they had arrived at the official residence, Guan Yu inquired what new title had been conferred upon him. “The First of the Five Tiger Generals,” replied Fei Shi. “And who are the five?” “Their names are Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, Zhao Yun, Ma Chao, and Huang Zhong.” “The second is my brother,” said Guan Yu. “Ma Chao comes of a famous family, and Zhao Yun has been with my elder brother so long that he is as a brother. It is right for them to be put on a level with me. But what sort of a man is this Huang Zhong that he is ranked with us? The really great man does not stand shoulder to shoulder with any old soldier that comes along.” And Guan Yu refused both title and seal. “You do wrong to refuse,” said Fei Shi. “Of old, Xiao He and Cao Shen helped Liu Bang, the Founder of the Han Dynasty, in his great enterprise and were very dear friends, while Han Xin was but a runaway leader from Chu. Yet Liu Bang made Han Xin a prince, and so placed over the heads of the other two. I have never heard that these two resented it. The Prince of Hanzhong has his Five Tiger Generals, but he is still your brother and all that that means. As his brother, you are he and he is you. Is there any comparison with any other? The Prince has always treated you with the greatest kindness. You two are one in sorrow and joy, sharers of disaster and good fortune. No such question as that of a mere title ought to reckon at all. I pray you, Sir, reflect.” Guan Yu understood, and thanked Fei Shi, saying, “You have prevented me from making a great mistake due to my ignorance.” Guan Yu then received the seal with all humility."

次日，曹操三面豎立雲梯，飛礮攻打。張魯見其勢已極，與弟張衞商議。衞曰：“放火盡燒倉廩府庫，出奔南山，去守巴中可也。”楊松曰：“不如開門投降。”張魯猶豫不定。衞曰：“只是燒了便行。”張魯曰：“我向本欲歸命國家，而意未得達；今不得已而出奔，倉廩府庫，國家之有，不可廢也。”遂盡封鎖。是夜二更，張魯引全家老小，開南門殺出。曹操敎休追趕，提兵入南鄭；見魯封閉庫藏，心甚憐之，遂差人往巴中，勸使投降。張魯欲降，張衞不肯。楊松以密書報操，便敎進兵，松為內應。操得書，親自引兵往巴中。張魯使弟衞領兵出敵，與許褚交鋒；被褚斬於馬下。敗軍回報張魯，魯欲堅守。楊松曰：“今若不出，坐而待斃矣。某守城，主公當親與決一死戰。”魯從之。閻圃諫魯休出。魯不聽，遂引軍出迎。未及交鋒，後軍已走。張魯急退，背後曹兵趕來。魯到城下，楊松閉門不開。張魯無路可走，操從後追至，大叫：“何不早降！”魯乃下馬投拜。操大喜；念其封倉庫之心，優禮相待，封魯為鎮南將軍。閻圃等皆封列侯。於是漢中皆平。曹操傳令各郡分設太守，置都尉，大賞士卒。惟有楊松賣主求榮，卽命斬之於市曹示衆。後人有詩歎曰：,"The next day, Cao Cao erected cloud ladders on three sides, and Fei Teng attacked. Zhang Lu saw that his power was extremely high, so he discussed with his younger brother Zhang Wei. Wei said, ""I set fire to the warehouses of Canglin and went to Nanshan to guard Bazhong."" Yang Song said, ""It's better to open the door and surrender."" Zhang Lu hesitated. Wei said: ""Just burn it."" Zhang Lu said: ""I wanted to return to the country, but I didn't get it. Now I have to run away. The warehouse of the warehouse, the state's possession, cannot be abolished."" . It was the second watch of the night, and Zhang Lu led the whole family and opened the South Gate to kill. Cao Cao ordered Xiu to pursue him, and sent troops to Nanzheng; seeing that Lu had closed the warehouse, he felt pity for him, so he sent people to Bazhong to persuade him to surrender. Zhang Lu wanted to surrender, but Zhang Wei refused. Yang Song reported the drill with a secret book, so he ordered the army, and Song was the inner responder. He was able to read the book, and personally led troops to Bazhong. Zhang Lu sent his younger brother Wei to lead his troops to attack the enemy and confront Xu Chu; he was beheaded by Chu. The defeated army returned to Zhang Lu, and Lu wanted to hold on. Yang Song said: ""If you don't go out now, you can sit down and wait to be killed. A certain defender of the city, the lord should be a relative and fight to the death."" Lu followed. Yan Pu advised Lu to quit. Lu did not listen, so he led an army out to meet him. Before the confrontation, the rear army has left. Zhang Lu retreated in a hurry, and Cao soldiers came from behind. When Lu arrived at the city, Yang Song closed the door. Zhang Lu had nowhere to go, so Cao chased after him, shouting, ""Why don't you come down early!"" Lu Nai dismounted and bowed. Cao was overjoyed; recited his heart for sealing the warehouse, treated each other with courtesy, and made Lu the general of Zhennan. Yan Pu and others were all named Marquis of Lie. So both Han and China were peaceful. Cao Cao ordered the prefectures to be assigned to the prefectures, the commanders were appointed, and the soldiers were rewarded. Only Yang Song sold the seller for glory, and ordered him to be executed by the city Cao Shizhong. A later poem sighed and said:","And just to make sure Zhang Lu really does believe that Pang De betrayed him earlier, Cao Cao rides with Pang De in front of the city walls to show Zhang Lu how hopeless his cause now is. It is then just a matter of time before the Cao Cao forces overwhelm the city and it falls, but not before Zhang Lu orders the grain warehouses and treasury to be sealed and protected. His reasoning is that these are the property of the Han dynasty and its people and not his own. Then he and his family, accompanied by Yang Song, flee to Bazhong. Cao Cao is impressed by the honour of the man when he discovers the warehouses protected. He sends a message to Bazhong asking Zhang Lu to surrender. He wants to, but his brother resists. Yang Song sends a message to say that if Cao Cao attacks, he will help him secure the city. Fooling Zhang Lu into going out of the city to attack Cao Cao ’s troops, Yang Song refuses him re-entry when he retreats from the battlefield, and there outside the city Zhang Lu has no option but to surrender to Cao Cao. He is received with great praise and honour. As a consequence, the whole of the Hanzhong area is now in Cao Cao’s hands, and all who have surrendered have been given new posts. But not the traitor Yang Song – Cao Cao has him publicly executed. As a poet wrote:","Soon after, scaling ladders were set against the city walls, and catapults threw in great stones. The danger being imminent, Zhang Wei counseled, saying, “Set all supplies on fire and flight to the Southern Mountains, where we might be able to defend Bazhong.” On the other hand, Yang Song said, “The best course is to throw open the gates and surrender.” Zhang Lu could not decide which to do. His brother, Zhang Wei, maintained that burning everything and flight was the only course. Zhang Lu said, “I have been always loyal at heart and desired to return to allegiance when circumstances would permit. I have been unable to attain my desire, but now fight seems the only course open to me. However, the granaries and treasures, the public offices and the government property of all kinds must be kept safe.” So the public buildings were all carefully barred and sealed. The same night, in the late evening, Zhang Lu and his family went out through the south gate and found their way through. Cao Cao let them go unpursued. When Cao Cao entered the city and saw the proofs of Zhang Lu's care of the government property, he compassionated the Governor's misfortunes. He then sent a messenger into Bazhong to induce Zhang Lu to surrender. Zhang Lu was disposed to do so, but his brother would not hear of it. Yang Song wrote a secret letter to Cao Cao urging him to attack and promising treacherous aid. Cao Cao presently attacked, and Zhang Wei came out to meet him. But his opponent was the mighty Xu Chu, who made short work of him. The beaten soldiers fled back into the city, which Zhang Lu then decided to defend. As this would not give Yang Song the chance to carry out his treacherous scheme, he persuaded his master, saying, “If we stay passive, death will surely come. My lord should go out and fight the enemy to the conclusion, leaving me to defend the city.” Zhang Lu took this advice, although it was opposed by Yan Pu, and went out. But before his van got near the enemy, his rear ranks began to desert, and Zhang Lu retreated. Cao Cao pursued him to the city walls, where Zhang Lu found the gates shut against him. “Surrender, O Zhang Lu!” cried Cao Cao. There being now no way open, Zhang Lu dismounted, prostrated himself, and gave in. Because of this and his care of the public property, Cao Cao treated him with great kindness and consoled him with the title of General Who Guards the South. Yan Pu and many others also were enrolled among the nobles. To each county was appointed a Military Commander, in addition to the Governor. All the soldiers were feasted and rewarded. Then Yang Song, who had sold his master, came and sued for honors. He was condemned to public execution and exposure. Selling one's lord may make great service, But the gains thereof are vanity;"
却說獻計者，乃尚書孫資也。曹叡問曰：“卿有何妙計？”資奏曰：“昔太祖武皇帝收張魯時，危而後濟；常對羣臣曰：‘南鄭之地，眞為天獄。’中斜谷道為五百里石穴，非用武之地。今欲盡起天下之兵伐蜀，則東吳又將入寇。不如以現在之兵，分命大將據守險要，養精蓄銳。不過數年，中國日盛，吳、蜀二國，必自相殘害：那時圖之，豈非勝算？乞陛下裁之。”叡乃問司馬懿曰：“此論若何？”懿奏曰：“孫尚書所言極當。”叡從之，命懿分撥諸將守把險要，留郭准、張郃守長安，大賞三軍，駕回洛陽。,"However, he said that the person who offered the plan was the Shangshu Sun Zi. Cao Rui asked, ""What's your plan?"" Zi Zuo said, ""In the past, when Emperor Taizu Wu took Zhang Lu, he was in danger and then came to the rescue; he often said to his ministers: 'The land of Nanzheng is really a heavenly prison.' Zhongxie Valley Road It is a stone cave of 500 miles, not a place to use force. Now if you want to use all the troops in the world to attack Shu, the Eastern Wu will enter the bandits again. It is better to use the current troops to divide the commanders to guard the dangerous places and recharge their batteries. It will only take a few years. , China is prospering, and the two kingdoms of Wu and Shu will definitely kill each other: at that time, is it not a chance to win? I beg Your Majesty to rule it out."" Rui Nai asked Sima Yi, ""What is this theory?"" The words are extremely worthy."" Rui obeyed, and ordered Yi to assign the generals to guard the dangerous positions, leaving Guo Zhun and Zhang He to guard Chang'an, rewarding the three armies, and driving back to Luoyang.","The official is Sun Zi, and his point is that sending all the army off to take Hanzhong exposes the rest of the country to invasion by Wu. Better to defend the borders, build up the wealth and security of the country, and leave Shu and Wu to argue with each other. Swayed by these arguments, Sima Yi agrees entirely, and so this is the course they take.","The proposer of the great plan that was to reunite the empire was the Chair of the Secretariat, named Sun Zi. “Noble Sir, expound your excellent scheme,” said the Ruler of Wei. And Sun Zi said, “When your great progenitor, Emperor Cao, first got Zhang Lu, he was at a critical stage in his career, but thenceforward all went well. He used to say the land of Nanzheng is really a natural hell. In the Xie Valley there are one hundred fifty miles of rocks and caves, so that it is an impossible country for an army. If Wei be denuded of soldiers in order to conquer Shu, then for sure we shall be invaded by Wu on the east. My advice is to divide the army among the various generals and appoint each a place of strategic value to hold, and let them train their forces. In a few years the Middle Land will be prosperous and wealthy, while the other two Shu and Wu, will have been reduced by mutual quarrels and will fall an easy prey. I hope Your Majesty will consider whether this is not a superior plan.” “What does the General think? said Cao Rui to Sima Yi. He replied, “Minister Sun Zi says well.” So Cao Rui bade Sima Yi draw up a scheme of defense and station the soldiers, leaving Guo Huai and Zhang He to guard Changan."
臣亮言：先帝創業未半，而中道崩殂；今天下三分，益州罷敝，此誠危急存亡之秋也。然侍衞之臣，不懈於內；忠志之士，忘身於外者；蓋追先帝之殊遇，欲報之於陛下也。誠宜開張聖聽，以光先帝遺德，恢弘志士之氣；不宜妄自菲薄，引喩失義，以塞忠諫之路也。宮中府中，俱為一體；陟罰臧否，不宜異同：若有作奸犯科，及為忠善者，宜付有司，論其刑賞，以昭陛下平明之治；不宜偏私，使內外異法也。侍中、侍郎郭攸之、費褘、董允等，此皆良實，志慮忠純，是以先帝簡拔以遺陛下：愚以為宮中之事，事無大小，悉以咨之，然後施行，必得裨補闕漏，有所廣益。將軍向寵，性行淑均，曉暢軍事，試用之於昔日，先帝稱之曰“能”，是以衆議舉寵以為督：愚以為營中之事，事無大小，悉以咨之，必能使行陣和穆，優劣得所也。親賢臣，遠小人，此先漢所以興隆也；親小人，遠賢臣，此後漢所以傾頹也。先帝在時，每與臣論此事，未嘗不歎息痛恨於桓、靈也！侍中、尚書、長史、參軍，此悉貞亮死節之臣也。願陛下親之、信之，則漢室之隆，可計日而待也。,"The minister said brightly: The first emperor was not halfway through his business, but the middle way collapsed; today, after three points, Yizhou will stop, this is the autumn of sincerity and danger. However, the ministers of the guards are unremitting in the interior; the loyal men, those who forget themselves outside; the one who pursues the special encounter of the late emperor, and wants to repay it to His Majesty. Sincerely, it is advisable to open Sheng Ting, to honor the virtues of the late emperors, and to magnify the spirit of lofty ideals; The palace, the palace, and the palace are all one; whether the punishment is wrong or not, there should be no similarities and differences: if there is a traitor and a criminal, and a loyal and good person, it is advisable to pay a minister, judge the punishment and reward, so as to show His Majesty’s peaceful governance; . The servants, the servants, Guo Youzhi, Fei Bao, Dong Yun, etc., are all good and practical, and their will is loyal and pure. Therefore, the previous emperor simply chose to leave His Majesty: I think that the affairs in the palace are not big or small. Benefit to fill Que leakage, there is a wide range of benefits. General Xiang Chong, who is of good temperament and good knowledge of military affairs, tried it out in the past, and the former emperor called it ""Neng"". Can make the formation and Mu, the good and the bad get what you want. Pro-virtuous ministers, far-off villains, this is the reason why the early Han Dynasty prospered; pro-little people, distant virtuous ministers, the later Han Dynasty collapsed. When the late emperor was there, every time he discussed this matter with his ministers, he sighed and hated Yu Huan and Ling! Serving Zhong, Shang Shu, Chang Shi, and joining the army are all the ministers of Zhenliang's death festival. May His Majesty kiss and trust him, and the prosperity of the Han family can be counted for days.",So now he persuades the second ruler to go to war. He presents him with a formal petition in which he urges the second ruler to carry forward the intentions for reunification of the empire that his father espoused.,"At this moment the empire is in three parts, and our country is weak; it is a most critical moment for us. Still, ministers are not remiss in the capital, and loyal and devoted soldiers sacrifice their lives abroad, for they still remember the special kindness of the First Ruler and wish to show their gratitude to him by service to Your Majesty. Therefore it would be indeed fitting that you should extend your holy virtue to glorify his virtuous memory in the stimulation of the will of your purposeful officers. Your Majesty should not lose yourself in the pursuit of mean things, quoting phrases to confound the eternal principles of rectitude and so preventing remonstrance from honest people. One rule applies to the palace of the Emperor and the residence of a courtier; there must be one law rewarding the good and punishing the evil. Evil-doers and law-breakers, as also true and good people, should be dealt with according to their deserts by the officers concerned in order to manifest Your Majesty's impartial and enlightened administration. Partiality is wrong, as is one law for the court and another for the regions. “The High Ministers Fei Yi, Guo Youzhi, and Dong Yun are honest men, devotedly anxious to be loyal to the last degree; wherefore His late Majesty chose them in his testament. My advice is to consult them in all palace matters, great or small, before taking action. Your Majesty will reap the enormous advantage of having any failings corrected. “General Xiang Chong is a man of well-balanced temperament, versed in military matters, to whom, after testing him, the late Emperor applied the epithet 'capable.' The consensus of opinion is that he should be Commander-in-Chief. My advice is to consult him in all military matters, great or small, whereby your military forces will yield their maximum, each one being employed to the best advantage. “Attract worthy people; repel mean ones. This policy achieved the glory of the Former Hans, while its reversal ruined the Latter Hans. When the late Emperor was with us, he often discussed this with your servant, and he took much to heart the story of Emperors Huan and Ling. “The Chair of the Secretariat Chen Zhen, Commander Zhang Yi, and Minister Jiang Wan are both incorruptible and enlightened people, honest to the death. I wish that Your Majesty should have them near and hold them in confidence. If this be done, then the glory of the House of Han will be quickly consummated."
未知孟獲整兵再來，勝負如何，且看下文分解。,"It is unknown how Meng Huo's troops will come back, and what the outcome will be. Let's see the breakdown below.","If you can capture me there, well then I will submit, and that submission will bind all the generations to come.’ To this Kong Ming says, ‘If, after releasing you, you gather your forces together to contest me","The way has been long and now danger is near, But faith in their leader banishes fear."
却說郭淮聽知司馬昭困於鐵籠山上，欲提兵來。陳泰曰：“姜維會合羌兵，欲先取南安。今羌兵已到，將軍若撤兵去救，羌兵必乘虛襲我後也。可先令人詐降羌人，於中取事：若退了此兵，方可救鐵籠之圍。”郭淮從之，遂令陳泰引五千兵，逕到羌王寨內，解甲而入，泣拜曰：“郭淮妄自尊大，常有殺泰之心，故來投降。郭淮軍中虛實，某俱知之。只今夜願引一軍前去劫寨。便可成功。如兵到魏寨，自有內應。”迷當大喜，遂令俄何燒戈同陳泰來劫魏寨。俄何燒戈敎泰降兵在後，令泰引羌兵為前部。是夜二更，竟到魏寨，寨門大開。陳泰一騎馬先入。俄何燒戈驟馬挺鎗入寨之時，只叫得一聲苦，連人帶馬，跌在陷坑裏。陳泰從後面殺來，郭淮從左邊殺來，羌兵大亂，自相踐踏，死者無數，生者盡降。俄何燒戈自刎而死。郭淮、陳泰，引兵直殺到羌人寨中，迷當大王急出帳上馬時，被魏兵生擒活捉，來見郭淮。淮慌下馬，親去其縳，用好言撫慰曰：“朝廷素以公為忠義，今何故助蜀人也？”迷當慚愧伏罪。淮乃說迷當曰：“公今為前部，去解鐵籠山之圍，退了蜀兵，吾奏准天子，自有厚賜。”,"However, Guo Huai heard that Sima Zhao was trapped on Iron Cage Mountain and wanted to send troops. Chen Tai said: ""Jiang Wei will join the Qiang soldiers and want to take Nan'an first. Now that the Qiang soldiers have arrived, if the general withdraws his troops to rescue me, the Qiang soldiers will take advantage of the falsity to attack me. You can first send people to deceive the Qiang people and take matters in the middle: if Only by retreating this soldier will we be able to save the siege of the iron cage."" Guo Huai followed, so he ordered Chen Tai to lead 5,000 soldiers to the Qiangwangzhai, disarmed his armor and entered, weeping and saying, ""Guo Huai is arrogant and always proud of himself. I have the intention to kill Tai, so I came to surrender. Guo Huai's army is empty and real, and everyone knows it. Just tonight I would like to lead an army to rob the village. It will be successful. Shao Ge and Chen Tai came to rob Wei Village. Russia He Huo Ge and Tai surrendered to the rear, and ordered Tai to lead the Qiang soldiers to the front. It was the second watch of the night, when he arrived at Wei Village, and the gate of the village was wide open. Chen Taiyi rode in first. When Eho Huo Ge suddenly put his horse and spear into the village, he only screamed bitterly, and he fell into the pit with his horse and man. Chen Tai came from behind, Guo Huai came from the left, the Qiang soldiers were in chaos, trampling on each other, countless dead, and all the living. Oho burnt himself to death. Guo Huai and Chen Tai led their troops to the Qiang village. When the king rushed out of his tent and mounted his horse, he was captured alive by Wei soldiers and came to see Guo Huai. Huai got off his horse in a panic, went to his bondage, comforted him with kind words, and said, ""The court has always been loyal to the public, so why do you help the people of Shu now?"" Mi should be ashamed and guilty. Huainai said, ""I am in the front now, I am going to solve the siege of Iron Cage Mountain, and I will retreat the soldiers of Shu.","So that is what Sima Zhao does, and after he makes the offerings and prayers the stream pours forth more than enough to slake the thirst of the men. Meanwhile Chen Tai of the Wei army has pretended to desert along with five thousand men and joined the Qiang in their alliance with Jiang Wei and the Shu. However, his real reason is to dupe the Qiang into mounting a raid on the Wei camp, where they will then be ambushed. Believing he is genuine, the king of the Qiang, Midang, orders an attack that very night. Led on by the duplicitous Chen Tai, one of their senior commanders leads the attack on the enemy camp. Of course, no sooner have they tried to enter than the commander’s horse falls into a deep pit, and, from behind, the troops who claimed to be deserting attack the Qiang and in front Chen Tai leads another detachment of Wei soldiers to the attack. Thousands of the Qiang die, and King Midang is captured. He is persuaded to leave the alliance with the Shu and rejoin his old allies the Wei, because when he arrives bound in chains Guo Huai releases him.","However, news of the dangerous position of Sima Zhao had come to Guo Huai, who set about a rescue. Chen Tai said to him, “Jiang Wei has made a league with the Qiangs, and they have arrived to help him. If you go away to rescue Sima Zhao, the Qiangs will attack from the rear. Therefore I would propose to send some one to the tribespeople to try to create a diversion and get them to retire. If they are disposed of, you may go to the rescue of Sima Zhao.” Guo Huai saw there was much reason in this, and told Chen Tai to take a force of five thousand troops and go to the camp of the King of the Qiangs. When Chen Tai reached the camp, he threw off his armor and entered weeping and crying that he was in danger of death. He said, “Guo Huai sets himself up as superior to everyone and is trying to slay me. Therefore I have come to offer my services to you. I know all the secrets of the Wei army, and, if you will, this very night I can lead you to their camp. I have friends in the camp to help, and you can destroy it.” King Mi Dang was taken with the scheme, and sent his General Ehe Shaoge to go with Chen Tai. The deserters from Wei were placed in the rear, but Chen Tai himself rode with the leading body of the Qiangs. They set out at the second watch and soon arrived. They found the gates open, and Chen Tai rode in boldly. But when Ehe Shaoge and his troops galloped in, there suddenly arose a great cry as soldiers and horses went tumbling into great pits. At the same time Chen Tai came round in the rear and attacked, while Guo Huai appeared on the flank. The Qiangs trampled each other down, and many were killed. Those who escaped death surrendered, and the leader, Ehe Shaoge, committed suicide in a pit. Guo Huai and Chen Tai then hastened back into the camp of the Qiangs. Mi Dang, taken unprepared, rushed out of his tent to get to horse, but was made prisoner. He was taken before Guo Huai, who hastily dismounted, loosed the prisoner's bonds, and soothed him with kindly words. “Our government has always regarded you as a loyal and true friend,” said Guo Huai. “Why then are you helping our enemies?” Mi Dang sank to the ground in confusion, while Guo Huai continued, “If you will now raise the siege of Iron Cage Mountain and drive off the troops of Shu, I will memorialize the Throne and obtain a substantial reward for you.” Mi Dang agreed."
却說關公正坐帳中，忽探馬飛報：“曹操差于禁為將，領七枝精壯兵到來。前部先鋒龐德，軍前擡一木櫬，口出不遜之言，誓欲與將軍決一死戰。兵離城止三十里矣。”關公聞言，勃然變色，美髯飄動，大怒曰：“天下英雄，聞吾之名，無不畏服；龐德豎子，何敢藐視吾耶！關平一面攻打樊城，吾自去斬此匹夫，以雪吾恨！”平曰：“父親不可以泰山之重，與頑石爭高下。辱子願代父去戰龐德。”關公曰：“汝試一往，吾隨後便來接應。”關平出帳，提刀上馬，領兵來迎龐德。兩陣對圓，魏營一面皂旗上大書“南安龐德”四個白字。龐德靑袍銀鎧，鋼刀白馬，立於陣前；背後五百軍兵緊隨，步卒數人肩擡木櫬而出。關平大罵龐德：“背主之賊！”龐德問部卒曰：“此何人也？”或答曰：“此關公義子關平也。”德叫曰：“吾奉魏王旨，來取汝父之首！汝乃疥癩小兒，吾不殺汝！快喚汝父來！”平大怒，縱馬舞刀，來取龐德。德橫刀來迎。戰三十合，不分勝負，兩家各歇。,"But he said that Guan Gong was sitting in the tent, and he suddenly inspected Ma Fei to report: ""Cao Cao is worse than the ban as a general, and he is coming with seven elite soldiers. Pang De, the pioneer in the front, carried a wooden tree in front of the army, and said unkind words, vowing to be with the general. We will fight to the death. The soldiers are no more than thirty miles away from the city."" When Guan Gong heard the words, his color changed suddenly, his beard fluttered, and he said angrily: ""Heroes in the world, when you hear my name, you are not afraid to obey; Pang Deshuzi, how dare you despise me! Guan Ping is attacking Fancheng, and I will kill this husband myself, and I will hate it!"" Ping said: ""My father cannot be as heavy as Mount Tai and compete with stubborn stones. I am willing to fight Pang De on behalf of my father."" Guan Gong said. ""As soon as you try to go, I will come to meet you."" Guan Ping came out of the tent, mounted his sword, and led troops to welcome Pang De. The two formations were facing each other, and Wei Ying had a soap flag with four white characters ""Nan An Pang De"" written on it. Pang De's robes of silver armor, steel knives and white horses, stood in front of the battle; five hundred soldiers followed closely behind, and several infantrymen came out with wooden sticks on their shoulders. Guan Ping scolded Pang De: ""A thief who backs the master!"" Pang De asked his subordinates, ""Who is this?"" Take the head of your father! You are a scabby child, and I will not kill you! Quickly call your father!"" Ping was furious, riding his horse and wielding a sword, and came to take Pang De. De Hengdao arrives. Thirty times of battle, no winner or loser, each of the two families rested.","When Guan Yu hears about the seven armies closing in on Fancheng, and about Pang De and his coffin, anger turns his face black, and his huge beard shakes with fury. ‘The great heroes of our land fear me, so who exactly is this idiot?’ to which his son Guan Ping says, ‘Father, let me take him on, because it is unseemly that Tai mountain18 should have to fight a little pebble!’ When the two forces take to the field, Pang De proudly flies his standard – a black flag with his title upon it and with his by now notorious coffins upright beside it. Guan Ping challenges Pang De, and, on hearing that this is Guan Yu’s son, Pang De roars, ‘I’ve the special commission of the king of Wei to take the head of your father.","Guan Yu was sitting in his tent when his spies came to report: “Seven armies of the north under Yu Jin are approaching. They are ten miles away. The van leader is Pang De.” Rage took possession of Guan Yu. His face changed color, his beard shook, and he roared out, “There is never a fighting man in all the world who has heard my name without trembling. Does this fellow dare disdain me?” Then he ordered Guan Ping to attack Fankou while he went out to stay the impudent boaster who dared him. “Father,” said Guan Ping, “Taishan Mountain in its majesty does not quarrel with a pebble. Let me go and fight this Pang De.” “Well, my son, go and try; I will support you.” So Guan Ping took his sword, mounted his steed, and went out with his troops. Both sides being drawn up for battle. On the side of Wei there flew a single black flag on which was inscribed “Pang De, Corrector of the West” in white. The leader himself wore a blue robe with a silver helmet and rode a white charger. He stood out in front backed by his five hundred veterans, and a few foot soldiers were there too, bearing the gruesome coffin. Guan Ping was very angry, crying out, “Turncoat! Traitor!” “Who is that?” asked Pang De of his followers. A certain one replied, “That is Guan Yu's adopted son, Guan Ping.” Pang De cried, “I have an edict from the Prince of Wei to take your father's head. You are but a weakling and I will spare you. But call your father.” Guan Ping dashed forward flourishing his sword. Pang De went to meet him, and there followed thirty odd bouts with no advantage to either. Both sides then drew off to rest."

忽一日，長史楊儀入告曰：“卽今糧米皆在劍閣，人夫牛馬，搬運不便，如之奈何？”孔明笑曰：“吾已運謀多時也：前者所積木料，并西川收買下的大木，敎人製造‘木牛’‘流馬’，搬運糧米，甚是便利。牛馬皆不水食，可以轉運，晝夜不絕。”衆皆驚曰：“自古及今，未聞有‘木牛’‘流馬’之事。不知丞相有何妙法，造此奇物？”孔明曰：“吾已令人依法製造，尚未完備。吾今先將造木牛流馬之法，尺寸方員，長短闊狹，開寫明白，汝等視之。”衆大喜。孔明卽手書一紙，付衆觀看。衆將環遶而視。其造木牛之法云：,"Suddenly one day, Yang Yi, the chief historian, came in and said, ""Now the grain and rice are all in the Jiange, and the people, cattle and horses are inconvenient to carry. What should I do?"" Kong Ming smiled and said, ""I have been thinking about it for a long time: the wood materials built by the former are not easy to carry. And the big wood bought by Xichuan, instructed people to make 'wooden cattle' and 'flowing horses', which is very convenient for carrying grain and rice. Both cattle and horses do not have water or food, they can be transported day and night."" Everyone was shocked and said: ""Since ancient times and now , I have never heard of the 'wooden ox' and 'flowing horse'. I don't know what wonderful method the prime minister has to make this strange thing?"" Kong Ming said: ""I have asked people to make it according to the law, but it is not yet complete. The dimensions are square, the length is short, the width is narrow, the opening and writing are clear, and you will see it."" Everyone was overjoyed. Kong Ming's handwritten a piece of paper, and the audience watched it. The crowd will look around.

With no other option, Zheng Wen writes the letter and is then placed under armed guard. Sima Yi is convinced of its authenticity and gives orders to prepare for the attack.","One day Yang Yi went to Zhuge Liang and said, “The stores of grain are all at Saber Pass, and the labor of transport is very heavy. What can be done?” Zhuge Liang replied, smiling, “I have had a scheme ready for a long time. The timber that I collected and bought in the Lands of Rivers was for the construction of wooden transport animals to convey grain. It will be very advantageous, as they will require neither food nor water and they can keep on the move day and night without resting.” All those within hearing said, “From old days till now no one has ever heard of such a device. What excellent plan have you, O Minister, to make such marvelous creatures?” “They are being made now after my plans, but they are not yet ready. Here I have the sketches for these mechanical oxen and horses, with all their dimensions written out in full. You may see the details.” Zhuge Liang then produced a paper, and all the generals crowded round to look at it. They were all greatly astonished and lauded, “The Prime Minister is superhuman!” A few days later the new mechanical animals were complete and began work."

Fei Wei is the master of the secret expression of this statement. The Empress was furious and ordered Yang Yi to be imprisoned for questioning, intending to be executed. Jiang Wan said: ""Although Yi is guilty, but he has done a lot of merits with the Prime Minister recently, and he cannot be executed, so he should be abolished as a commoner."" Later, the Lord followed and demoted Yang Yi to go to Hanjia County as a citizen. Yi was ashamed and killed herself.","Now the second ruler raises Jiang Wei to take Kong Ming’s place as prime minister; Fei Yi becomes the head of the secretariat, and others receive their rewards. But Yang Yi feels belittled, as he expected to have a higher post than his junior, Jiang Wei. He even comments that perhaps he should have deserted and joined Wei, where he would have been given real honours! When the second ruler hears this, he cashiers him and sends him into internal exile. Unable to bear the shame of this, Yang Yi commits suicide.","He said to Fei Yi, “If when the Prime Minister died I had gone over to Wei, with the whole army, I should not have been thus left out in the cold.” Fei Yi secretly reported this speech to the Latter Ruler, who was angered and threw Yang Yi into prison. The Latter Ruler intended putting him to death, but Jiang Wan interceded, saying, “Yang Yi had followed the late Prime Minister in many campaigns and had had many good services. Your Majesty should not put him to death, but take away his rank.” And Yang Yi was reprieved."

Countless sergeants slandered the wounded. Ma Zhong led Fu Shiren and Mi Fang to settle in Jiangzhu. At the third watch that night, the soldiers were crying nonstop. Mi Fang listened to it secretly, and a group of people said: ""We are all soldiers of Jingzhou. We were killed by Lü Meng's tricks. Now that Liu Huangshu is driving the expedition in person, Soochow will end sooner or later. Those who hate it: Mi Fang and Fu Shiren. I will wait.

Guan Xing returns to the first ruler with Zhang Bao and presents the head of Pan Zhang to him. Great is the rejoicing. Back at the camp of the shattered army of Wu, there is general despair.

Then they collected their troops, many wounded, and stationed them in various points. Ma Zhong, together with Mi Fang and Fu Shiren, marched to the river bank and encamped. The night they arrived, many soldiers were groaning with the pain of their wounds. Mi Fang, who was listening unknown to them, heard one of them say, “We are Jingzhou soldiers and victims of Lu Meng's vile machinations. If we had only remained under Liu Bei! Now he is Emperor and has set out to destroy Wu, and he will do it one day. But he has a special grudge against Mi Fang and Fu Shiren. Why should we not kill these two and go over to Shu? They will think we have done well.” Another said, “Do not be hasty; we will do it presently when there is a chance.”"

却說孔明令魏延兩路伺候；果然雍闓、高定兩路兵來，被伏兵殺傷大半，生擒者無數，都解到大寨來。雍闓的人，囚在一邊；高定的人，囚在一邊。却令軍士謠說：“但是高定的人免死，雍闓的人盡殺。”衆軍皆聞此言。少時，孔明令取雍闓的人到帳前，問曰：“汝等皆是何人部從？”衆偽曰：“高定部下人也。”孔明敎皆免其死，與酒食賞勞，令人送出界首，縱放回寨。孔明又喊高定的人問之。衆皆告曰：“吾等實是高定部下軍士。”孔明亦皆免其死，賜以酒食；却揚言曰：“雍闓今日使人投降，要獻汝主並朱褒首級以為功勞，吾甚不忍。汝等旣是高定部下軍，吾放汝等回去，再不可背反。若再擒來，決不輕恕。”,"But they said that Kongming ordered Wei Yan to serve on both sides; sure enough, Yong Kai and Gao Ding came, and most of them were killed and wounded by the ambush soldiers, and there were countless people who were captured, and they all came to Dazhai. Those of Yong Kai are imprisoned on the side; those of Gao Ding are imprisoned on the side. But the sergeant told a rumor: ""But the people of Gaoding are spared death, and the people of Yongkai will be killed."" All the troops heard this. When he was young, Kong Ming ordered the people who had taken Yong Kai to come to the tent, and asked, ""Who are you all from?"" The crowd said, ""Gao Ding's subordinates."" , it was sent to the head of the world and returned to the village. Kong Ming called out to the people of Gao Ding to ask him again. All of them said: ""We are actually soldiers of Gao Ding's subordinates."" Kong Ming also spared him from death and gave him food and wine; but he threatened: ""Yong Kai made people surrender today, and I will give your Lord and Zhu Bao's head as a credit. , I can't bear it. You are Gao Ding's subordinate army, I will let you go back, and you can't turn your back.","Once again the Shu army triumphs, and many men from both rebel groups are captured. Kong Ming divides the captured soldiers into their two original groups. He has rumours spread that the men of Gao Ding will be spared while the men of Yong Kai will be executed. It is hardly surprising, then, that when Kong Ming calls for Yong Kai’s men to be brought to him and he asks whom they served they all say, ‘Gao Ding!’ He lets them all go as he did with the real men of Gao Ding. However, he lets them know that someone has come to him from Yong Kai, offering to bring the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao in order to obtain pardon.","Now Zhuge Liang had told Wei Yan to wait for this double attack, and so when it came to pass, both divisions fell into an ambush and suffered great loss, many being killed and more captured. The prisoners were taken to the camp, and the soldiers belonging to the two leaders—Yong Kai and Gao Ding—were confined separately. Then Zhuge Liang told the soldiers to let it be known that only those belonging to Gao Ding would be spared, the others would be put to death. When time had been given for this story to spread among the prisoners, Yong Kai's troops were brought up to the commander's tent. “Whose soldiers were you?” asked Zhuge Liang. “Gao Ding's,” cried they all, falsely. Then they were all pardoned, and, after being given wine and food, they were taken to the frontier and set free. Next the real Gao Ding's soldiers were brought forward, and the same question was put to them. “We all really belong to Gao Ding's command,” said they. In like manner they were pardoned and refreshed with wine and food. Then Zhuge Liang addressed them, saying, “Yong Kai has just sent a messenger to ask that he may surrender, and he offers to bring with him the heads of Gao Ding and Zhu Bao as a proof of merit. But I will not receive him, and you, since you are Gao Ding's soldiers, shall be released and allowed to return to him. But let there be no ingratitude and fighting again, for if there is, I certainly will not pardon you next time.”"

The left and right said: ""Liu Bei's army was defeated and he was trapped in a city, and he just took advantage of the situation to attack it; now seeing the stone formation and retreating, why?"" Xun said: ""I am not afraid of the stone formation and retreat; My father is no different, now that I know that I am chasing the soldiers of Shu, I will definitely attack. Two days after the retreat of the troops, people from three places came to report: ""Wei soldiers, Cao Ren, went out of Shuxu, Cao Xiu, out of the cave entrance, and Cao Zhen out of Nanjun: three hundred thousand soldiers and horses, and the starry night arrives at the border, I don't know what it means."" Xun smiled and said: ""Not what I expected. I have ordered the soldiers to reject it."" It is:","So shocked is Lu Xun by this that, despite his triumph and the urging of his commanders, he orders retreat. ‘It is not the rocks that frighten me. But I think Cao Pi will use this opportunity to attack.’ And indeed, just two days later, news comes that hundreds of thousands of Wei troops have massed on the border. Smiling, Lu Xun says, ‘I expected this, and my plans to stop them are already in motion.’","Lu Xun took his way to his camp in deep thought. “This Zhuge Liang is well named Sleeping-Dragon,” said he, “I am not his equal.” Then, to the amazement of all, he gave orders to retire. The officers ventured to remonstrate, seeing that they had been so successful. “General, you have utterly broken the enemy, and Liu Bei is shut up in one small city; it seems the time to smite, and yet you retire because you have come across a mysterious arrangement of stones.” “I am not afraid of the stones, and it is not on their account that I retire. But I fear Cao Pi. He is no less resourceful than his father, and when he hears I am marching into Shu, he will certainly attack us. How could I return then?” The homeward march began."
時吳兵退屯安豐，魏主車駕駐於項城。鍾會曰：“今諸葛誕雖敗，壽春城中糧草尚多，更有吳兵屯安豐以為掎角之勢。今吳兵四面攻圍：彼緩則堅守，急則死戰——吳兵或乘勢夾攻，吾軍無益。不如三面攻之，留南門大路，容賊自走；走而擊之，可全勝也。吳兵遠來，糧必不繼；我引輕騎抄在其後，可不戰而自破矣。”昭撫會背曰：“君眞吾之子房也！”遂令王基撤退南門之兵。,"When Wu soldiers retreated to Anfeng, the master of Wei was stationed in Xiangcheng. Zhong Hui said: ""Although Zhuge Dan is defeated today, there is still a lot of food and grass in Shouchun City, and there is even a tendency for Wu soldiers to settle in Anfeng and think they are holding hands. Today, Wu soldiers are besieging from all sides: if they are slow, they will stand firm, and if they are urgent, they will fight to the death - Wu Bing Or take advantage of the momentum to attack, our army is useless. It is better to attack from three sides, leave the south gate road, allow the thieves to go on their own; walk and attack them, and they can be completely victorious. When the Wu soldiers come from a distance, the food will not continue; But if you don't fight, you will be defeated."" Zhaofu Hui said, ""Your son is really my son!"" He ordered Wang Ji to withdraw the troops at the southern gate.","When Zhuge Dan and his Wu allies attack, the Wu soldiers, who have no real interest in the outcome of the battle, run off to loot the wagons, leaving Zhuge Dan and his men alone and exposed.","The Ruler of Wei, Cao Mao, was lodging at this time in Xiangcheng. Then said Zhong Hui, “Zhuge Dan has been worsted, but the city wherein he has taken refuge is well supplied, and his allies, the troops of Wu, are not distant. His position is strong. Our soldiers are besieging the city all round, which means that those within will hold out for a long time, or they will make a desperate sortie. Their allies also may fall upon us at the same time, and it would go hard with us. Therefore, I advise that the attack be made only on three sides, leaving the south gate open for them if they wish to flee. If they flee, we can fall on the fugitives. The troops of Wu cannot have supplies for very long; and if we sent some light cavalry round by their rear, we might stay their fighting power without a battle.” “You are my Zhang Liang,” said Sima Zhao, stroking the back of his adviser. “Your advice is excellent.” So Wang Ji, who was on the south of the city, was ordered to withdraw."
却說獻策之人，乃治書侍御史陳羣，字長文。操問曰：“陳長文有何良策？”羣曰：“今劉備、孫權結為辱齒，若劉備欲取西川，丞相可命上將提兵，會合淝之衆，逕取江南，則孫權必求救於劉備。備意在西川，必無心救權；權無救則力乏兵衰：江東之地，必為丞相所得。若得江東，則荊州一鼓可平也。荊州旣平，然後徐圖西川，天下定矣。”操曰：“長文之言，正合吾意。”卽時起大兵三十萬，逕下江南；令合淝張遼，準備糧草，以為供給。,"However, he said that the person who offered the policy was Chen Qun, the official secretary of the imperial court, with a long text. Cao asked, ""What is the best strategy for Chen Changwen?"" Qun said, ""Now Liu Bei and Sun Quan are in a relationship, and if Liu Bei wants to take Xichuan, the prime minister can order his generals to raise troops, join the crowd of Fei, and take the south of the Yangtze River, then Sun Quan will We must ask for help from Liu Bei. If our intention is in Xichuan, we must have no intention to save our power; Xu Tu Xichuan, the world will be settled."" Cao said: ""The words of the long text are exactly what I want."" At the same time, the army of 300,000 soldiers marched down to the south of the Yangtze River; they ordered Hefei Zhangliao to prepare food and grass as a supply.","The speaker is Chen Qun, a minor official, who points out that Sun Quan and Xuande are now as close ‘as lips and teeth’. What is needed is to drive a wedge between them. If Cao were to attack Hefei and Sun Quan, this would create a dilemma for Xuande. ‘ He wants to go west for his own gain,’ says Chen Qun, ‘but Sun Quan would expect him to drop everything and come to his rescue. But Xuande won’t. It’s quite simple. Sun without Xuande will fold quickly, and then we can take care of Xuande after that.’ So Cao Cao sends an army of three hundred thousand south to the attack.","“What is this good plan of yours, friend Chen Qun?” asked Cao Cao of the speaker, who was a civilian in his service. Chen Qun replied, “Your two principal enemies—Liu Bei and Sun Quan—are now firm allies, close as lips and teeth. But Liu Bei wants the Western Land of Rivers and if you, O Prime Minister, send a mighty host against Sun Quan, Sun Quan must ask help from his friend Liu Bei, who, having his heart set on the west, will refuse it. Sun Quan without this aid cannot stand and will become so weak that the South Land will be yours for the taking, and Jingzhou will follow in a tap of the drum. The west will follow and the whole empire is yours.” “Those are my thoughts put into words,” replied Cao Cao. The expeditionary force of three hundred thousand troops set out for the south. Zhang Liao of Hefei was in command of the supply department."

A later poem praised:","Many are the commanders of the Shu who fall that day – Cheng Ji takes his own life in despair, surrounded as he is; Wu Ban and Feng Xi, raising the siege of Yiling, are cut off and die at the hands of Sun Huan’s army.","Now Wu Ban and Zhang Nan had been besieging Yiling. Then came Feng Xi and told of the need of their lord, and they led off their army to rescue him. Whereupon Sun Huan was set free as Lu Xun had foretold would happen. As soon as Sun Huan was free, he set off in pursuit of Feng Xi and Zhang Nan. These two marched until they met an army of Wu face to face, and so were between two forces. A desperate battle was fought, and both these generals perished therein. Feng Xi was loyal without peer."

却說馬超在西涼州，夜感一夢：夢見身臥雪地，羣虎來咬。驚懼而覺，心中疑惑，聚帳下將佐，告說夢中之事。帳下一人應聲曰：“此夢乃不祥之兆也。”衆視其人，乃帳前心腹校尉：姓龐，名德，字令明。超問：“令明所見若何？”德曰：“雪地遇虎，夢兆殊惡。莫非老將軍在許昌有事否？”言未畢，一人踉蹌而入，哭拜於地曰：“叔父與弟皆死矣！”超視之，乃馬岱也。超驚問何為。岱曰：“叔父與侍郎黃奎同謀殺操，不幸事泄，皆被斬於市。二弟亦遇害。惟岱扮作客商，星夜走脫。”超聞言，哭倒於地。衆將救起。超咬牙切齒，痛恨操賊。忽報荊州劉皇叔遣人齎書至。超拆視之，書略曰：,"But he said that Ma Chao was in Xiliang Prefecture, and he had a dream at night: he dreamed that he was lying in the snow, and a group of tigers came to bite him. Frightened and awake, with doubts in his heart, he gathered his generals under the tent and told him what happened in his dream. A person under the tent responded and said, ""This dream is an ominous omen."" Everyone looked at him, and he was the captain of the confidant in front of the tent. Chao asked: ""What did Lingming see?"" De said: ""I meet a tiger in the snow, and the omen in my dream is very bad. Could it be that the old general has something to do in Xuchang?"" Both my brother and I are dead!"" It was Ma Dai who surpassed him. Surprised to ask why. Dai said: ""Uncle and servant Huang Kui were murdered together. Unfortunately, they were both beheaded in the city. The second brother was also killed. But Dai pretended to be a merchant and got away in the night."" Chao heard the words and fell to the ground crying. All will be rescued. Super gritted his teeth and hated fucking thieves. He suddenly reported that Uncle Liu Huangshu of Jingzhou had sent a letter to him. Looking beyond it, the book briefly says:","After the messenger leaves, Xuande asks what exactly this plan is that will protect Hefei from over three hundred thousand soldiers. ‘ Cao Cao’s greatest fear is attack by the western tribal soldiers,’ Kong Ming replies. ‘Now that he’s killed Ma Teng, his son Ma Chao has taken control of the Xiliang tribal warriors. Write to him suggesting an alliance, because he’ll be dying to revenge his father. If he attacks the north, then they can’t attack us.’ The message is duly sent.","In his dream he saw himself lying out on a snowy plain and many tigers were coming up and biting him. He awoke in a fright and began to wonder what the dream portended. Failing to explain it, he told the dream to his officers. One of them ventured to say the portent was evil. This was General Pang De. “What is your interpretation?” asked Ma Chao. “Meeting with tigers on a snowy plain is a very inauspicious subject to dream about. Assuredly our old General is in trouble at the capital.” And at that moment one entered in hot haste and cast himself on the earth, weeping and crying, “The Uncle and his sons are dead!” It was Ma Dai, the nephew of Ma Teng. And he told the story of the evil: “Uncle Ma Teng and Huang Kui had planned to assassinate Cao Cao, but the plot had miscarried and become known. Ma Tie fell in the battlefield, Uncle Ma Teng and Ma Xiu were put to death in the market place, and I escaped in disguise.” Ma Chao fell to the ground and wept bitterly, grinding his teeth with rage at his enemy Cao Cao. They lifted him to his feet and led him away to repose. Soon after arrived a messenger with a letter from Liu Bei, which read like this: “In these latter days of the hapless Hans, when the rebellious and tyrannical Cao Cao monopolizes all power, to the"

權從其言，隨遣使者以木匣盛關公首級，星夜送與曹操。時操從摩陂班師回洛陽，聞東吳送關公首級至，喜曰：“雲長已死，吾夜眠貼席矣。”階下一人出曰：“此乃東吳移禍之計也。”操視之：乃主簿司馬懿也。操問其故，懿曰：“昔劉、關、張三人桃園結義之時，誓同生死。今東吳害了關公，懼其復讎，故將首級獻與大王，使劉備遷怒大王，不攻吳而攻魏，他却於中乘便而圖事耳。”操曰：“仲達之言是也。孤以何策解之？”懿曰：“此事極易。大王可將關公首級，刻一香木之軀以配之，葬以大臣之禮。劉備知之，必深恨孫權，盡力南征。我却觀其勝負：蜀勝則擊吳，吳勝則擊蜀。二處若得一處，那一處亦不久也。”操大喜，從其計，遂召吳使入。呈上木匣。操開匣視之，見關公面如平日。操笑曰：“雲長公別來無恙！”言未訖，只見關公口開目動，鬚髮皆張，操驚倒。衆官急救，良久方醒，顧謂衆官曰：“關將軍眞天神也！”吳使又將關公顯聖附體、罵孫權追呂蒙之事告操。操愈加恐懼，遂設牲醴祭祀，刻沈香木為軀，以王侯之禮，葬於洛陽南門外。令大小官員送殯，操自拜祭，贈為荊王，差官守墓；卽遣吳使回江東去訖。,"Quan followed his words, and sent an envoy to hold Guan Gong's head in a wooden box, and sent it to Cao Cao on a starry night. When Shi Cao returned to Luoyang from the Mopi class, he heard that Dong Wu had sent Guan Gong's head to the rank, and said with joy: ""Yun Chang is dead, I will sleep at night."" ."" Opposite: It is the chief clerk, Sima Yi. When Cao asked him the reason, Yi said: ""In the past, when Liu, Guan, and Zhang were united in Taoyuan, they vowed to live and die together. Now Dongwu has killed Guan Gong, and he is afraid of his return, so he offers his head to the king, so that Liu Bei is angry with the king. He did not attack Wu but attacked Wei, but he took advantage of the convenience of the middle to plan things."" Cao said: ""Zhongda's words are true. How can I solve it?"" Yi said: ""This matter is very easy. Guan Gong's head is engraved with the body of a fragrant wood to match it, and buried as a minister's ceremony. Liu Bei knew that he would hate Sun Quan deeply and try his best to fight south. Once you get one, that one will not be long before."" Cao was overjoyed, and following his plan, he summoned Wu envoys to enter. Present in wooden box. Cao opened the box and looked at it, and saw Guan Gong's face as usual. Cao laughed and said, ""Don't come here, Yun Changgong!"" Before the words were finished, Guan Gong opened his eyes, his beard and hair were stretched, and Cao was shocked. The officials gave first aid, and after a long time they woke up. Gu said to the officials, ""General Guan is a real god!"" The Wu envoy then told Guan Gong to show his saintly possession and scolded Sun Quan for chasing Lü Meng. Cao became more and more afraid, so he set up a sacrificial sacrifice, carved agarwood as the body, and buried it outside the south gate of Luoyang with the ceremony of a prince. They ordered officials of all sizes to send funerals, made sacrifices by themselves, presented them as King Jing, and sent officials to guard the tomb;","So the plan is put into motion. Guan Yu’s head is put in a special box and delivered to Cao Cao. Hearing of the death of Guan Yu, Cao Cao comments that he will now sleep well at night, but Sima Yi is not so sure he should be so sanguine. ‘This is a trick to divert disaster from the south onto us,’ he says. ‘What on earth are you talking about?’ asks Cao Cao. ‘Xuande and his two brothers swore to live and die as one. Sun Quan now fears that his actions will draw the wrath of Xuande down upon him. So he sends you the head so that Xuande’s fury will be diverted against you instead!’ ‘Well, well. Good point,’ says Cao Cao. ‘So what do we do?’ ‘Have a body created out of wood and put Guan Yu’s head on it and give it full military honours and burial. This shifts the blame back to Sun Quan, so Xuande will attack Wu. Then we can wait and see. If Shu is winning, we attack Wu. If Wu is winning, we attack Shu!’ Cao Cao is delighted with this plan and orders the box be brought to him. Opening it, he sees that the face of Guan Yu looks exactly as it did in life. Teasingly he asks the head, ‘I hope you’ve been keeping well since we last met!’ But as he speaks the mouth opens, the eyes roll around, and the hair on the head and beard stands upright! Cao Cao collapses in a faint. ‘ Guan Yu’s no mere mortal!’ he says on coming round, and when he hears of what happened to Lü Meng he orders the grandest ceremony. With every official in the city attending, he buries Guan Yu outside the walls of Luoyang with the fullest of ritual observance.","Sun Quan thought the move worth making, and so the head of the great warrior was placed in a box and sent off as quickly as possible to Cao Cao. At this time Cao Cao's army had marched back from Mopo to Luoyang. When he heard of the coming of the gruesome gift, he was glad at heart and said, “So Guan Yu is dead; now I can stick to my mat and sleep soundly at night.” But Sima Yi saw through the ruse and said from his place by the steps, “This is a trick to divert evil from Wu.” “What do you mean? How?” said Cao Cao. “The Peach Garden Oath bound the three brothers to live and die together. Now Wu is fearful of revenge for the execution of one of the three and sends the head to you to cause Liu Bei's wrath to fasten on you, O Prince. Sun Quan wishes Liu Bei to attack you instead of himself, the real perpetrator of the crime. Then he will find a way of accomplishing his ends while you two are quarreling.” “You are right, friend;” said Cao Cao, “and now how can we escape?” “I think escape is easy. You have the head of Guan Yu; make a wooden image of the remainder of the body, and bury the whole with the rites suitable to a minister of state. When Liu Bei hears of this, he will turn his hate toward Sun Quan and raise all his forces to attack him. If you will think it out, you will see that whichever is victor the other will be smitten; and if we get one of the two, the other will follow before very long.” Cao Cao was pleased with the solution. Then he ordered the messenger to come in with the box, which was opened, and he looked upon the face of the dead. The features had not changed; the face bore the same appearance as of old. Cao Cao smiled. “I hope you have been well since our last meeting, Guan Yu,” said Cao Cao. To his horror, the mouth opened, the eyes rolled, and the long beard and hair stiffened. Cao Cao fell to the ground in a swoon. They rushed to him, but it was a long time before he recovered consciousness. “General Guan Yu is indeed a spirit,” he said. Suddenly the messenger who had brought the dead warrior's head became also possessed by the spirit of Guan Yu, and fell to cursing and reviling his master, Sun Quan, and he told the story of what had befallen Lu Meng. Cao Cao, filled with dread, prepared sacrifices and performed the rites for the honored dead. An effigy was carved out of heavy fragrant wood and buried outside the south gate with all the rites of a princely noble, a huge concourse of officials of all grades following in the procession. At the funeral Cao Cao himself bowed before the coffin and poured a libation. He also conferred on the dead the posthumous title of Prince of Jingzhou, and appointed guardians of the tomb."

Zhou Jian second generation, and Jian Zhu Ji, relying on the power of Jin and Zheng Jia. Longxing, the great ancestor, respected the younger brother of the prince, opened up the nine kingdoms, beheaded Zhu Lu, and established the great sect. Today, the wicked, upright, ugly, and righteous, there are many disciples, hidden evil intentions, usurpation has been revealed; the imperial clan is weak, the imperial family has no place, considering the ancient style, according to the false expediency: the superior minister is the king of Hanzhong, the Great Sima.","Quoting from history, he argues that nothing is better or more appropriate for an imperial family than to promote and support its own members – even the most distant branches thereof. This, he argues, is especially necessary when someone as ambitious as Cao Cao is usurping and corrupting the court and seizing power. It is in the light of this that he, Xuande, as a member of the imperial family has agreed to the call by his own people to take up the mantle of family responsibility and become king of Hanzhong.","“Now my fellows consider that history has repeated itself. They attach the utmost importance to the family and would manifest it with all their might. Hereditary succession of rulers is still a principle. The rulers of Zhou, taking the two preceding dynasties as models, strengthened its position through all the states, and it reinforced itself with the support of the states of Jing and Zheng. When the great Founder of the Hans came into his own, he ennobled his whole family with kingships and lordships. Later, the dynasty had to issue a general command throughout the whole of the nine regions in order to destroy the widespread Lu Family and to enhance the Liu Family. “Now Cao Cao is an enemy of all rectitude, and his followers are all evil. His treachery is manifest. Since the members of the imperial clan are few and weak, the clan is not honored."

In the future, the war will be divided into three armies: but there are many forests in the valley, so do not enter lightly."" Wu Tugu said: "" Your Majesty is right. I already know that the Chinese often use tricks. From now on, I will do what I say and do. I will fight in front of you, and you will teach me from behind."" The two discussed it. Suddenly reported that Shu soldiers set up camp on the north bank of Taohuadukou. Wutuguyu sent two prisoners to lead the Tengjia army to cross the river to fight against the soldiers of Shu. Wei Yan was defeated and left. The barbarians are afraid that there will be an ambush, and they will return without rushing. The next day, Wei Yan went to set up camp again. The barbarians sent out, and led the army across the river to fight. Extend to welcome it. Do not count together, delay defeat. The barbarians chased and killed for more than ten li, and when they saw that there was no movement, they settled in the middle of Shu Village. The next day, the leader of the second prisoner asked Wutugu to come to the village to tell him about it. Wutu Guzhu led the army forward and chased Wei Yan for a while. All Shu soldiers abandoned their armor and left. I saw that there was a white flag in front of me, and I hurriedly led the defeated soldiers to the white flag. There was a village long ago, and I settled in the middle of the village. Wu Tugu chased after the soldiers, and Yan led the soldiers to abandon the village and leave. The barbarians won the Shu village. The next day, he looked forward to chase and kill. Wei Yan returned to fight, but he was defeated without a three-way alliance, and he just walked away looking at the white flag. There is another village, which is extended to live in the village. The next day, the barbarians came again. Extend the strategy and go. The barbarians occupied the village of Shu.","Zhang Yi is told to prepare a camp with fortifications at a special place, while Zhang Ni and Ma Zhong are given a thousand of the Man soldiers who have surrendered and told of their special role in this plot. Now everything is ready. The plot starts well. Day after day Meng Huo and Wutugu attack Wei Yan’s camps and day after day they ‘defeat’ him. Camp after camp is abandoned and seized by the Man tribes. Step by step Wei Yan, guided by Kong Ming and a series of white flags marking the next camp, draws the Man army closer and closer to the winding valley and its secrets.","Meng Huo had begun to have a real terror of Zhuge Liang, and he warned King Wutu Gu of Wugo, saying, “This Zhuge Liang is exceedingly crafty. Ambush is one of his favorite ruses, so you should warn your soldiers that on no account should they enter a valley where the trees are thick.” “Great King, you speak with reason,” said Wutu Gu. “I have always heard that the people of the Middle Empire are full of wiles, and I will see that your advice is followed. I will go in front to fight, and you may remain in the rear to give orders.” Presently the scouts told them of the arrival of the troops of Shu on the bank of the Peach Flowers River. Wutu Gu sent his two generals—Xi Ni and Tu An—to cross the river and engage them. The two sides met, but Wei Yan soon suffered a defeat and left the field. The Mangs were afraid to pursue as they dreaded an ambush. In the meantime, Wei Yan laid out another camp. The Mangs crossed the river in greater force. Wei Yan came out to meet them, but again fled after a very short fight. This time the Mangs pursued, but having lost their hold of the enemy after three miles, and coming then to the late camp of the Shu army, which seemed quite safe, they occupied it. Next day Xi Ni and Tu An asked their King Wutu Gu to come to the camp, and they reported what had happened. Wutu Gu decided to make a general advance to drive the troops of Shu before him. They fled, even casting aside their breastplates and throwing away their arms; they were in such haste to flee. And the troops of Shu went toward a white flag that appeared in the distance. They found a camp already made, which they occupied. Soon, however, Wutu Gu came near, and as he pressed forward Wei Yan abandoned this camp and fled. When the Mangs reached the camp, they took up quarters therein. Soon after they set out to renew the pursuit, but Wei Yan turned back and checked them. This was only a temporary check, for he fled after three encounters, going toward a white flag in the distance. This sort of thing continued daily until the soldiers of Shu had been defeated and driven out of the field fifteen times and had abandoned their camp on seven different occasions."

且說魏延受了密計，當夜二更拔寨，急回漢中。早有細作報知王雙。雙大驅軍馬，併力追趕。追到二十餘里，看看趕上，見魏延旗號在前，雙大叫曰：“魏延休走！”蜀兵更不回頭。雙拍馬趕來。背後魏兵大叫曰：“城外寨中火起，恐中敵人奸計。”雙急勒馬回時，只見一片火光沖天，慌令退軍。行到山坡左側，忽一騎馬從林中驟出，大喝曰：“魏延在此！”王雙大驚，措手不及，被延一刀砍於馬下。魏兵疑有埋伏，四散逃走。延手下止有三十騎人馬，望漢中緩緩而行。後人有詩讚曰：,"Let's say that Wei Yan was under a secret plan, and that night he pulled out the village and rushed back to Hanzhong. Wang Shuang had already made a detailed report. Shuang Da drove the army horses and chased them. After chasing after more than 20 li, he saw that he had caught up. Seeing Wei Yan's flag in front, Shuang shouted, ""Wei Yanxiu, go!"" The Shu soldiers did not turn back. Double beat horses come. The Wei soldiers behind him shouted, ""The fire in the fortress outside the city, I'm afraid that the enemy will be tricked."" Walking to the left side of the hillside, a horse suddenly came out of the forest, shouting, ""Wei Yan is here!"" Wang Shuang was shocked and caught off guard, and was slashed by Yan under his horse. Suspected of an ambush, the Wei soldiers scattered and fled. There were only thirty cavalry under Yan's men, watching Hanzhong walk slowly. A later poem praised:","Wang Shuang is instructed to patrol the roads to prevent any fresh supplies reaching the Shu army. Meanwhile Minister Sun Li comes up with a plot. He has wagons prepared that look as if they are grain convoys but are actually filled with inflammable materials so that they can lure the Shu into attacking and then destroy them with fire. Kong Ming is beginning to despair but even he is amused when he realizes that the so-called grain wagons are a trap. After all, he is the master of fire in warfare! But he sees that they could use the anticipated attack as a trap of their own by luring the enemy into attacking the Shu camp and then ambushing them. This they do, and the Wei army is completely outfoxed and defeated. Wei Yan, operating on secret orders from Kong Ming, also traps Wang Shuang and slays him, and then Kong Ming, being a realist, orders a retreat by the Shu army, because indeed they are running out of supplies.","When Wei Yan received his secret orders, he broke up camp that night and hastened toward Hanzhong. Wang Shuang's scouts heard this and told their chief, who hurried in pursuit. After about seven miles, he came in sight of Wei Yan's ensigns. As soon as he got within hailing distance, he shouted, “Do not flee, Wei Yan!” But no one looked back, so he again pressed forward. Then he heard one of his guards behind him shouting, “There is a blaze in the camp outside the wall; I think it is some wile of the enemy.” Wang Shuang pulled up and, turning, saw the fire. He therefore tried to draw off his troops. Just as he passed a hill, a horseman suddenly came out of a wood. “Here is Wei Yan!” shouted the horseman. Wang Shuang was too startled to defend himself and fell at the first stroke of Wei Yan's blade. Wang Shuang's troops thought this was only the beginning of an ambush and serious attack, so they scattered; but really Wei Yan only had thirty men with him, and they moved off leisurely toward Hanzhong.

却說鄧艾知蜀兵出祁山，早與陳泰下寨準備；見蜀兵連日不來搦戰，一日五番哨馬出寨，或十里或十五里而回。艾凭高望畢，慌入帳與陳泰曰：“姜維不在此間，必取董亭襲南安去了。出寨哨馬只是這幾匹，更換衣甲，往來哨探，其馬皆困乏，主將必無能者。陳將軍可引一軍攻之，其寨可破也。破了寨柵，便引兵襲董亭之路，先斷姜維之後。吾當先引一軍救南安，逕取武城山。若先占此山頭，姜維必取上邽。上邽有一谷，名曰段谷，地狹山險，正好埋伏。彼來爭武城山時，吾先伏兩軍於段谷，破維必矣。”泰曰：“吾守隴西二三十年，未嘗如此明察地理。公之所言，眞神算也。公可速去。吾自攻此處寨柵。”於是鄧艾引軍星夜倍道而行，逕到武城山；下寨已畢，蜀兵未到，卽令子鄧忠，與帳前校尉師纂，各引五千兵，先去段谷埋伏，如此如此而行。二人受計而去。艾令偃旗息鼓，以待蜀兵。,"But he said that Deng Ai knew that the soldiers of Shu had left the Qishan Mountains, and had already prepared with Chen Tai to go down to the village. Seeing that the soldiers of Shu did not come to fight for several days, he sent his horses out of the village five times a day, or returned within ten or fifteen miles. After Ai Ping finished his high hopes, he panicked into the tent and said to Chen Tai, ""Jiang Wei is not here, so he must take Dong Ting and go to Nan'an. There are only a few horses going out of the village, changing their armor and going to and from the sentry, and their horses are all sleepy. , the main general will be incompetent. General Chen can lead an army to attack it, and his fortress can be broken. When the fortress is broken, he will lead his troops to attack the road of Dongting, and then cut Jiang Wei first. Chengshan. If we occupy the top of the mountain first, Jiang Wei will take Shangqi. There is a valley in Shangqi called Duangu. Tai said, ""I have been guarding Longxi for twenty or thirty years, and I have never seen such a clear geography. What the public said is true. The public can go quickly. I will attack the fortress here by myself."" Go, go straight to Wucheng Mountain; after going down to the village, before the troops of Shu arrive, the commander Deng Zhong, and the captain of the front of the tent, Shi Zuan, each lead 5,000 soldiers, first go to Duangu to ambush, and so on. The two were taken away. Ai Lingyan calmed down and waited for the soldiers of Shu.","Chen Tai and Deng Ai overwhelm Jiang Wei and his Shu troops at every occasion, and once again Jiang Wei has no option but to retreat back to Hanzhong.","As soon as Deng Ai had heard that the enemy would come out at Qishan, he had camped there with his colleague Chen Tai. But when days had passed without anyone coming to fling a challenge, he sent out spies to find out where the Shu army was lurking. They could find nothing, and so Deng Ai went to the summit of a hill to look around. He came to the conclusion, saying, “Jiang Wei must not be in this camp. He must be on his way to capture Nanan. Those soldiers in the Shu camp were nothing but a feint, accentuated by the daily change of uniform. Going to and fro for days, the horses look tired, and their leaders are certainly none of the ablest. Therefore, General, I advise an attack here. If that succeeds, the Dongting road can be occupied, and Jiang Wei will be unable to retreat. I think I ought to try to relieve Nanan. I will go by the Wucheng Mountain, and if I occupy that, the enemy will try to take Shanggui. Near that place is a narrow and precipitous valley called Block Valley, just the place for an ambush, where I shall lie in wait till Jiang Wei comes to take the Wucheng Mountain.” Chen Tai replied, “I have been here over twenty years and have never known so much of the military possibilities of the place. You are very wonderful and must carry out your plan.” So Deng Ai marched toward Nanan by double marches. Soon they came to the Wucheng Mountain, where they camped without opposition. He sent his son Deng Zhong and Shi Zuan, each leading five thousand troops, to lie in wait in the Block Valley and not to betray their presence. In the meantime Jiang Wei was marching between Dongting and Nanan. Near the Wucheng Mountain, he turned to Xiahou Ba and said, “That hill is our point, and Nanan is close. I fear lest the artful Deng Ai may seize and fortify it.” They hastened, anxious to reach the hill before the enemy."

Cao Cao was startled, and gathered together with Wen and Wu to discuss it and said: ""A certain person knows that Yun is long, wise and brave, and now he is in Jingxiang, like a tiger with wings. What can I do? I just want to move the capital to avoid it."" Sima Yi said, ""No, it is not because of the war that Jin and others are caught in the water; it does not harm the country's big plans. , Sun Quan will not be happy. The king can send envoys to the Eastern Wu Chen to talk about the interests and interests, and after Sun Quan secretly raise an army to attack Yunchang, Xu Shiping will cut off the land in the south of the Yangtze River to seal Sun Quan, and the danger of Fancheng will be solved by itself."" Lord. Book Jiang Ji said: ""Zhongda's words are true. Now you can send an envoy to Eastern Wu, and you don't need to move the capital."" Cao Yiyun, so he did not move the capital; When the time comes, it is not as good as Pang De! Today, while sending an envoy to the Eastern Wu, on the other hand, I will definitely get a great general to be the leader of the cloud-"" Before the words were finished, the next general said, ""A certain wishes to go."" Manipulate it: it is Xu Huang. Cao was overjoyed, so he dispatched 50,000 elite troops, and ordered Xu Huang to be his general, and Lü Jian to be his deputy.","Meanwhile, Cao Cao is reeling from the defection of Yu Jin and the death of Pang De. Summoning his advisers, he asks them, given the recent bout of disasters, what he should do, even suggesting that they should abandon the capital. Sima Yi says, ‘Don’t be too depressed by what has passed. There is conflict between Xuande and Sun Quan, and we need to exploit this. Send an emissary to Sun Quan offering him the whole of the south so that he’ll move against Jingzhou behind Guan Yu’s back. He’ll have to turn back, and that way you save Fancheng.’ So it is agreed and having despatched the letter to Sun Quan he appoints Xu Huang as commander and Lü Jian as his second to go to oppose any further advances by Guan Yu.","Having captured Yu Jin and accomplished the death of Pang De, Guan Yu became more famous and more fear-inspiring through the whole empire than even before. Cao Cao called together his advisers to help him decide upon what he should do. Said Cao Cao, “I must acknowledge this Guan Yu as the one man who, in skill and valor, overtops the whole world. Lately he has obtained possession of Jingzhou and the territory near it, and has so become very terrible. He is a tiger with wings added. Pang De is no more; Yu Jin is his prisoner; the armies of Wei have lost their morale; and if he led his armies here, Xuchang, we should be helpless. I can only think of avoiding the peril by removal of the capital. What think you?” “No; do not take that step,” said Sima Yi, rising to reply. “Yu Jin and all the others you lost were victims of the flood and slain in battle. These losses do no harm at all to your great plan. The Suns and Lius are no longer friends since Guan Yu has accomplished his desire. You may send a messenger into Wu to foment the quarrel and cause Sun Quan to send his armies to attack the army of Guan Yu from the rear, promising that, when things are tranquil, you will reward the south to Sun Quan. In this way you will relieve Fankou.” Here Minister Jiang Ji said, “Sima Yi speaks well, and the messenger should lose no time. Do not move the capital or send an army.” Cao Cao therefore did not carry out his first proposal. But he was sad at the loss of Yu Jin, and spoke of him affectionately, “Yu Jin had followed me faithfully for thirty years, yet in that moment of truth he was less than Pang De.” It was necessary to send someone with the letters to Wu and also to find another leader willing to face Guan Yu. Cao Cao had not long to wait for the latter, as an officer stepped out from the ranks of those in waiting and offered himself. It was Xu Huang. Xu Huang's offer was accepted, and he was given fifty thousand of veterans."
却說張飛在帳中，神思昏亂，動止恍惚，乃問部將曰：“吾今心驚肉顫，坐臥不安，此何意也？”部將答曰：“此是君侯思念關公，以致如此。”飛令人將酒來，與部將同飲，不覺大醉，臥於帳中。范、張二賊，探知消息，初更時分，各藏短刀，密入帳中，詐言欲稟機密重事，直至牀前。原來張飛每睡不合眼。當夜寢於帳中，二賊見他鬚豎目張，本不敢動手；因聞鼻息如雷，方敢近前，以短刀刺入飛腹。飛大叫一聲而亡。時年五十五歲。後人有詩歎曰：,"But he said that Zhang Fei was in the tent, his mind was in a daze, and his movements were in a trance, so he asked the subordinate general: ""I am trembling in my heart now, sitting and lying uneasy, what is the meaning of this?"" , so it is."" Fei sent people to bring wine and drank together with his subordinates, and unknowingly got drunk and lay in the tent. The two thieves Fan and Zhang, to find out the news, at the beginning of the shift, each hid short knives, secretly entered the account, and slandered the secret and important matters, until the bed. It turned out that Zhang Fei couldn't sleep well every time. When he was sleeping in the tent at night, the two thieves saw that he had to open his eyes, and at first he didn't dare to make a move; because he smelled like thunder, he dared to come forward and stabbed Fei's belly with a short knife. Fei screamed and died. Fifty-five years old. A later poem sighed and said:","Unable to sleep because of his pent-up fury, Zhang Fei drinks heavily and soon falls down drunk. As soon as they discover that this is the case, the two murderers slip into his tent. Now Zhang Fei, a true soldier, has learned how to sleep with his eyes open. Seeing this, the two men freeze in horror until they hear a deep snore and realize he is asleep. Pulling out their daggers, they move in for the kill. Slowly they advance, silent until they are standing above the sleeping warrior. Glancing at each other, they signal they are ready. Then each one plunges his dagger into Zhang Fei’s stomach. With but one cry, Zhang Fei convulses and within moments lies dead. He is fifty-five years old. A poet has said this about him:","That day Zhang Fei was greatly disturbed in his mind and restless. He told some of his subordinates, saying, “I feel nervous and creepy and shivery and cannot not rest. What does it mean?” “This is due to too much brooding over the loss of your brother,” said they. Then Zhang Fei bade them bring in wine, and he drank with his officers. Presently he became quite intoxicated and lay down on a couch in his tent. Meanwhile the two assassins had followed all his doings, and when they knew he was lying on his couch intoxicated and incapable, they went into the tent, each armed with a water-sharp dagger. They got rid of the attendants by saying they had confidential matters to talk about and so got into the inner rooms. But even then they dared do nothing, for Zhang Fei slept always with open eyelids, and he lay on his couch as if still awake. However, huge snores soon convinced them that their victim really slept, and they crept to the side of the couch. Then both stabbed simultaneously deep into the body. Zhang Fei uttered one cry and lay still. So he died at the hand of assassins at the age of fifty-five years. He who whipped the inspector in Anxi,"

却說鄧艾催督先鋒鄭倫來襲山後。倫剛轉過山角，忽然一聲礮響，鼓角喧天，伏兵殺出：為首大將，乃廖化也。二人未及答話，兩馬交處，被廖化一刀，斬鄭倫於馬下。鄧艾大驚，急勒兵退時，張翼引一軍殺到。兩下夾攻，魏兵大敗。艾捨命突出，身被四箭。奔到渭南寨時，司馬望亦到。二人商議退兵之策。望曰：“近日蜀主劉襌，寵幸中貴黃皓，日夜以酒色為樂，可用反間計召回姜維，此危可解。”艾問衆謀士曰：“誰可入蜀交通黃皓？”言未畢，一人應聲曰：“某願往。”艾視之，乃襄陽党均也。艾大喜，卽令党均齎金珠寶物，逕到成都結連黃皓，布散流言，說姜維怨望天子，不久投魏。於是成都人人所說皆同。黃皓奏知後主，卽遣人星夜宣姜維入朝。,"However, Deng Ai urged the pioneer Zheng Lun to attack the back of the mountain. Lun had just turned the corner of the mountain, when suddenly there was a loud bang, the drums blared the sky, and the soldiers in ambush rushed out: The chief general was Liao Hua. Before the two could answer, the two horses crossed each other, and Liao Hua slashed Zheng Lun off the horse. Deng Ai was shocked, and when he hurriedly retreated, Zhang Yi led an army to kill him. With two pinch attacks, the Wei soldiers were defeated. Ai sacrificed his life and was shot by four arrows. When he ran to Weinan Village, Sima Wang also arrived. The two discussed the strategy of retreating. Wang said, ""Liu Ru, the master of Shu recently, favored Huang Hao, a middle-ranking nobleman, and enjoyed wine day and night. He could use countermeasures to recall Jiang Wei. This danger can be solved."" ?"" Before the words were finished, one person answered, ""Someone wants to go."" Ai Shizhi was a party member of Xiangyang. Ai was overjoyed, and ordered the party to give away gold and jewels, and went to Chengdu to connect with Huang Hao, spreading rumors that Jiang Wei resented the emperor, and soon joined Wei. So everyone in Chengdu says the same thing. Huang Hao reported to the queen, and sent people to Xingye to announce Jiang Wei's entry into the court.","But once again it is a disaster for the Wei, and both Sima Wang and Deng Ai are roundly defeated. They have to retreat – Deng Ai even receives wounds from four arrows as he flees. Facing military defeat, Deng Ai and Sima Wang come up with another plan. They decide to undermine Jiang Wei ’s credibility with the second ruler and his favourite, the eunuch Huang Hao. Bribes are taken to Huang Hao, and soon rumours circulate in Chengdu that Jiang Wei, dissatisfied with his level of power and authority, is planning to go over to the Wei. Soon the rumours are so prevalent that Huang Hao feels able to petition the second ruler to order Jiang Wei to come back.","Now Deng Ai had hurried on Zheng Lun to make the first attack. As Zheng Lun turned the corner of the hill, a bomb exploded. At once the drums rolled and an ambush discovered itself. Liao Hua was in command. Neither side stayed to parley, and the leaders engaged in single combat. In the first encounter Liao Hua cut Zheng Lun down. Deng Ai had not expected such preparation, and he hastened to withdraw. Then Zhang Yi came forth and attacked on the other side. The army of Wei was worsted. Deng Ai fought his way out, but he bore four arrow wounds upon his body. He got to the river, where he found Sima Wang, and they discussed how to get away. But Sima Wang proposed another form of attack. “Recently the Ruler of Shu has had a favorite, Eunuch Huang Hao, in whom he places all his trust and with whom he spends his time in one round of pleasure. Let us use the eunuch to sow distrust between the Emperor and his general and so get Jiang Wei recalled. In that way we shall retrieve our defeat.” So Deng Ai assembled his advisers and asked who could go into Shu and get into communication with Huang Hao. Dang Jun volunteered at once. Deng Ai entrusted gold and pearls and precious things to him, and sent him into Shu to win the treacherous alliance of the eunuch. As Dang Jun went, he also disseminated reports that Jiang Wei was angry and intended to go over to Wei. These rumors became the common talk in Chengdu, and everyone believed them. Huang Hao carried them to the Emperor, and a messenger was sent to call the general to the capital."

且說郭淮聞郝昭病重，乃與張郃商議曰：“郝昭病重，你可速去替他。我自寫表申奏朝廷，別行定奪。”張郃引着三千兵，急來替郝昭。時郝昭病危。當夜正呻吟之間，忽報蜀軍到城下了。昭急令人上城守把。時各門上火起，城中大亂。昭聽知驚死。蜀兵一擁入城。,"Let’s say that Guo Huai heard that Hao Zhao was seriously ill, so he discussed with Zhang He: “Hao Zhao is seriously ill, you can go and replace him quickly. I wrote my own table to declare to the court, don’t make a decision.” Zhang He led three thousand soldiers and rushed to replace Hao. Zhao. At that time, Hao Zhao was critically ill. While groaning that night, he suddenly reported that the Shu army had arrived at the city. Zhao urgently sent people to guard the city. When the gates were set on fire, the city was in chaos. Zhao heard the shock and died. Shu soldiers rushed into the city.","He told the others to take three days because he actually set out straight away with Zhang Bao and Guan Xing. The defenders were so demoralized by the sickness of Hao Zhao that they put up little resistance, not least because pro-Shu men inside the city fired the city gates.","Now when Guo Huai heard that the commander of Chencang was ill, he and Zhang He talked over the matter. Guo Huai said, “Hao Zhao is very ill; you would better go and relieve him. I will report to the capital what we have done that they may arrange.” So Zhang He started with his three thousand troops to relieve the sick man. Hao Zhao was indeed at the point of death, and suddenly they told him that the army of Shu had reached the walls. Hao Zhao roused himself and bade them go on the ramparts. But then fire broke out at each gate, a panic spread in the city and the noise of the confusion startled the dying man so that he passed away just as the troops of Shu were bursting in."

司馬懿看畢，心中大怒——乃佯笑曰：“孔明視我為婦人耶？”卽受之，令重待來使。懿問曰：“孔明寢食及事之煩簡若何？”使者曰：“丞相夙興夜寐，罰二十以上皆親覽焉。所啖之食，日不過數升。”懿顧謂諸將曰：“孔明食少事煩，其能久乎！”使者辭去，回到五丈原，見了孔明，具說：“司馬懿受了巾幗女衣，看了書札，並不嗔怒，只問丞相寢食及事之煩簡，絕不提起軍旅之事。某如此應對，彼言：‘食少事煩，豈能長久？’”孔明歎曰：“彼深知我也！”主簿楊顒曰：“某見丞相常自校簿書，竊以為不必：夫為治有體，上下不可相侵。譬之治家之道，必使僕擲執耕，婢曲爨，私業無曠，所求皆足，其家主從容自在，高枕飲食而已。若皆身親其事，將形疲神困，終無一成。豈其智之不如婢僕哉：失為家主之道也。是故古人稱坐而論道，謂之三公；作而行之，謂之士大夫。昔丙吉憂牛喘，而不問橫道死人；陳平不知錢穀之數，曰：‘自有主者。’今丞相親理細事，汗流終日，豈不勞乎？司馬懿之言，眞至言也。”孔明泣曰：“吾非不知：但受先帝託孤之重，惟恐他人不似我盡心也！”衆皆垂淚。自此孔明自覺神思不寧。諸將因此未敢進兵。,"When Sima Yi finished reading it, he was furious in his heart - he pretended to laugh and said, ""Does Kong Ming see me as a woman?"" Yi asked, ""What is the trouble of Confucius when sleeping, eating, and other matters?"" The messenger said, ""The prime minister is so excited to sleep at night, and he will be punished for more than 20 years to see in person. The food he eats is only a few liters a day."" Yi Gu called the generals. Said: ""Kongming is troubled by little food, it can last for a long time!"" The messenger resigned, returned to Wuzhangyuan, saw Kongming, and said: ""Sima Yi received the women's clothes, read the book, and did not get angry, but only asked the Prime Minister how he slept and ate. The trouble is simple, never mention the military affairs. When a certain responds like this, he said: 'Eating less food is annoying, how can it last for a long time?'"" Kong Ming sighed and said, ""He knows me well!"" Chief clerk Yang Yong said: "" I saw that the prime minister often wrote books from the school, and I secretly thought that it was not necessary: the husband is to govern and have the body, and the upper and lower cannot invade each other. For example, the way to manage the family, you must make the servants throw the plough, the maid, and the private business has no space. The owner of the family is calm and comfortable, and he just eats and eats. If he does everything personally, he will be tired and sleepy, and nothing will be accomplished. How can his wisdom be inferior to that of a servant: it is also the way to be a master of the family. Therefore, the ancients called it sitting and talking about the Tao, They are called San Gong; if they do it, they are called scholars and officials. In the past, Bingji was worried about cow wheezing, but did not ask about the dead; Chen Ping did not know the number of money and grains, and said: 'He who has his own master.' All day long, don’t you work hard? Sima Yi’s words are the true words.” Kong Ming wept and said, “I don’t know: but I was entrusted by the late emperor so much, I’m afraid that others will not be as dedicated as I am!” Everyone wept. Since then, Kong Ming felt restless. Therefore, the generals did not dare to enter the army.","Desperate to make the Wei troops come out to fight again, Kong Ming even sends a woman’s headdress and a shroud to mock and insult Sima Yi, but this doesn’t draw him out.","Sima Yi, although inwardly raging, pretended to take it all as a joke and smiled. “So he regards me as a deer,” said he. He accepted the gift and treated the messenger well. Before the messenger left, Sima Yi asked him a few questions about his master's eating and sleeping and hours of labor. “The Prime Minister works very hard,” said the messenger. “He rises early and retires to bed late. He attends personally to all cases requiring punishment of over twenty of strokes. As for food, he does not eat more than a few pints of grain daily.” “Indeed, he eats little and works much,” remarked Sima Yi. “Can he last long?” The messenger returned to his own side and reported that Sima Yi had taken the whole episode in good part and shown no sign of anger. He had only asked about the Prime Minister's hours of rest, and food, and such things. He had said no word about military matters. “I told him that you ate little and worked long hours, and then he said, 'Can he last long?' That was all.” “He knows,” said Zhuge Liang, pensively. First Secretary Yang Yong presently ventured to remonstrate with his chief. “I notice,” said Yang Yong, “that you check the books personally. I think that is needless labor for a Prime Minister to undertake. In every administration the higher and subordinate ranks have their especial fields of activity, and each should confine his labors to his own field. In a household, for example, the male servants plow and the female servants cook, and thus operations are carried on without waste of energy, and all needs are supplied. The master of the house has ample leisure and tranquillity. If one individual strives to attend personally to every matter, he only wearies himself and fails to accomplish his end. How can he possibly hope to perform all the various tasks so well as the maids or the servants? He fails in his own part, that of playing the master. And, indeed, the ancients held this same opinion, for they said that the high officers should attend to the discussion of ways and means, and the lower should carry out details. Of old, Bing Ji was moved to deep thought by the panting of an ox, but inquired not about the corpses of certain brawlers which lay about the road, for this matter concerned the magistrate. Chen Ping was ignorant of the figures relating to taxes, for he said these were the concern of the controllers of taxes. O Minister, you weary yourself with minor details and sweat yourself every day. You are wearing yourself out, and Sima Yi has good reason for what he said.” “I know; I cannot but know,” replied Zhuge Liang. “But this heavy responsibility was laid upon me, and I fear no other will be so devoted as I am.” Those who heard him wept. Thereafter Zhuge Liang appeared more and more harassed, and military operations did not speed."
且說魏將岑威引軍驅木牛流馬，裝載糧草，正行之間，忽報前面有兵巡糧。岑威令人哨探，果是魏兵，遂放心前進。兩軍合在一處。忽然喊聲大震，蜀兵就本隊裏殺起，大呼：“蜀中大將王平在此！”魏兵措手不及，被蜀兵殺死大半。岑威引敗兵抵敵，被王平一刀斬了。餘皆潰散。王平引兵盡驅木牛流馬而回。敗兵飛奔報入北原寨內。郭淮聞軍糧被劫，疾忙引軍來救。王平令兵扭轉木牛流馬舌頭，俱棄於道中，且戰且走。郭淮敎且莫追，只驅回木牛流馬。衆軍一齊驅趕，却那裏驅得動？郭淮心中疑惑。正無奈何，忽鼓角喧天，喊聲四起，兩路兵殺來：乃魏延、姜維也。王平復引兵殺回。三路夾攻，郭淮大敗而走。王平令軍士將牛馬舌頭，重復扭轉，驅趕而行。郭淮望見，方欲回兵再追，只見山後煙雲突起，一隊神兵擁出，一個個手執旗劍——怪異之狀，擁護木牛流馬，如風擁而去。郭淮大驚曰：“此必神助也！”衆軍見了，無不驚畏，不敢追趕。,"Let's say that Wei general Cen Wei led the army to drive away the wooden oxen and horses, loaded the grain and grass, and suddenly reported that there were soldiers patrolling the grain ahead. Cen Wei was sent to send a sentry, but if it was a Wei soldier, he moved forward with confidence. The two armies joined together. Suddenly, the shouting was loud, and the soldiers of Shu jumped up in their own team, shouting, ""Wang Ping, the general of Shu, is here!"" Wei Bing was caught off guard, and most of them were killed by the soldiers. Cen Wei led the defeated soldiers to meet the enemy, and was beheaded by Wang Ping. The rest collapsed. Wang Ping led his troops to drive back the wooden cows and horses. The defeated soldiers rushed to report into Beiyuan Village. Guo Huai heard that the military supplies had been robbed, and hurriedly brought in the army to rescue him. Wang Ping ordered the soldiers to twist the tongues of the wooden ox and the horse, and all of them abandoned the road, fighting and walking. Guo Huai told him not to pursue him, but drove back the wooden cows and horses. All the armies are driven together, but where can they be driven? Guo Huai was puzzled. Just as he was helpless, suddenly the drums and horns blared, shouting everywhere, and two soldiers attacked: Wei Yan and Jiang Wei. Wang Pingfu led his troops to fight back. Three-way attack, Guo Huai was defeated and left. Wang Ping ordered the sergeant to twist the tongues of the ox and horse repeatedly to drive away. Guo Huai saw that, Fang wanted to return to the soldiers and chase them again, only to see smoke and clouds protruding from the back of the mountain, and a team of magical soldiers rushed out, one by one holding flags and swords - a strange shape, supporting the wooden cows and horses, and rushed away like the wind. Guo Huai was shocked and said, ""This will definitely be helped by God!"" When the army saw it, they were all terrified and did not dare to chase.","Hearing the cries of his men, Sima Yi rides out himself to the rescue, but he is trapped, and his men desert, leaving him stranded.","So one day when a convoy was on its way from Xizhou, the scouts in front suddenly reported some soldiers ahead who said they were escort for the grain. Commander Cen Wei halted and sent to inquire. It appeared the newcomers were really the soldiers of Wei, however, and so he started once more. The newcomers joined up with his own troops. But before they had gone much farther, there was a yell, and the men of Shu began to kill, while a voice shouted, “Wang Ping is here!” The convoy guard were taken aback. Many were killed, but the others rallied round Cen Wei and made some defense. However, Wang Ping slew Cen Wei, and the others ran this way and that, while the convoy was turned toward the Shu camp. The fugitives ran off to Beiyuan and reported the mishap to Guo Huai, who set out hot foot to rescue the convoy. When he appeared, Wang Ping gave the order to turn tongues, left the wooden animals in the road, and ran away. Guo Huai made no attempt to pursue, but tried to put the wooden animals in motion toward their proper destination. But he could not move them. He was greatly perplexed. Then suddenly there arose the roll of drums all round, and out burst two parties of soldiers. These were Wei Yan and Jiang Wei's troops, and when they appeared Wang Ping's soldiers faced about and came to the attack as well. These three being too much for Guo Huai; he retreated before them. Thereupon the tongues were turned back again and the wooden herd set in motion. Seeing this, Guo Huai came on again. But just then he saw smoke curling up among the hills and a lot of extraordinary creatures burst out upon him. Some held swords and some flags, and all were terrible to look at. They rushed at the wooden animals and urged them away. “Truly these are supernatural helpers,” cried Guo Huai, quite frightened. The soldiers also were terror-stricken and stood still."
却說陳武聽得江邊廝殺，引一軍來，正與龐德相遇，兩軍混戰。孫權在濡須塢中，聽得曹兵殺到江邊，親自與周泰引軍前來助戰。正見徐盛在李典軍中攪做一團廝殺，便麾軍殺入接應。却被張遼、徐晃兩枝軍，把孫權困在垓心。曹操上高阜處看見孫權被圍，急令許褚縱馬持刀殺入軍中，把孫權軍衝作兩段，彼此不能相救。,"But he said that Chen Wu heard the fight by the river, and led an army to meet Pang De, and the two armies were fighting. Sun Quan was in Ruxuwu, when he heard Cao's soldiers have been killed by the river, and personally led the army with Zhou Tai to help the battle. Seeing that Xu Sheng was in a fight among Li Dian's army, the army rushed in to meet him. However, Sun Quan was trapped in Gaixin by Zhang Liao and Xu Huang. Cao Cao went up to Gaofu and saw Sun Quan being surrounded, so he ordered Xu Chu to ride his horse and take a sword into the army.","The fighting sways this way and that, Wu’s troops sack one of the Wei camps; a storm sinks a Wu ship with one of the main commanders on board, and all perish; Pang De confronts Chen Wu in a maelstrom of fighting by the Ruxu wall; and Sun Quan rides out with Zhou Tai to help Chen Wu, only to find himself trapped between two of the Wei forces. Cao Cao spots the danger that Sun Quan is in and the possibility of killing or capturing him. He orders Xu Chu to attack immediately. The shock of his entry into the battle splits the Wu forces, leaving Sun Quan dangerously exposed. Things are going very badly indeed for Sun Quan.","Chen Wu, hearing the noise of battle, set out for the river bank. On his way Chen Wu met Pang De and the legion under him. A melee ensued. Then Sun Quan with Zhou Tai and his troops joined in. The small force from the ships that had attacked Li Dian was now surrounded. So Sun Quan gave the signal for an onslaught that should rescue them. This failed, and Sun Quan was himself surrounded in turn and soon in desperate straits. From a height, Cao Cao saw his difficulties and sent in Xu Chu to cut Sun Quan's column in halves so that neither half could aid the other."
高定卽引部將鄂煥并本部兵，殺奔朱褒營來。比及離寨約有十里，山後一彪軍到，乃朱褒也。褒見高定軍來，慌忙與高定答話。定大罵曰：“汝如何寫書與諸葛丞相處，使反間之計害吾耶？”褒目瞪口呆，不能回答。忽然鄂煥於馬後轉過，一戟刺朱褒於馬下。定厲聲而言曰：“如不順者皆戮之！”於是衆軍一齊拜降。定引兩部軍來見孔明，獻朱褒首級於帳下。孔明大笑曰：“吾故使汝殺此二賊，以表忠心。”遂命高定為益州太守，總攝三郡；令鄂煥為牙將。三路軍馬已平。,"Gao Ding led the general E Huan to join the troops of the headquarters, and rushed to Zhu Bao's camp. It was about ten li from Lizhai, and a Biao army arrived at the back of the mountain, and that was Zhu Bao. Seeing Gao Ding's army coming, Bao hurriedly answered with Gao Ding. Ding cursed, ""How can you write a book and get along with Zhuge Cheng, so that you can harm me?"" Bao was stunned and could not answer. Suddenly E Huan turned around behind the horse and stabbed Zhu Bao under the horse with a halberd. Ding said sharply, ""If you don't obey, kill them!"" So all the troops bowed down. Ding led two troops to see Kongming and presented Zhu Bao's head under the tent. Kong Ming laughed loudly and said, ""That's why I asked you to kill these two thieves to show your loyalty."" He then ordered Gao Ding to be the prefect of Yizhou, commanding the three counties in total, and E Huan to be the general of Ya. The three-way army has been leveled.","Completely baffled by this, Gao Ding replies, ‘That’s just a plot by Zhu Bao. Don’t trust him an inch.’ ‘Well,’ says Kong Ming, ‘if you were to bring me the head of Zhu Bao","Thereupon Gao Ding and his subordinate, E Huan, led away their troops to the camp of Zhu Bao. When they were about three miles from his camp, Zhu Bao appeared with a cohort. As soon as they recognized each other, Zhu Bao hastily came forward to parley. But Gao Ding cried out to him, “Why did you write a letter to the Prime Minister and so intrigue with him to get me killed?” Zhu Bao stared open mouthed and could not reply. Then E Huan rode out from behind his chief and struck Zhu Bao with his halberd so that he fell to the ground. Thereupon Gao Ding shouted, “The soldiers should either yield or be slain!” And they yielded in a body. Gao Ding then went back to Zhuge Liang and offered the head of the man just slain. Zhuge Liang laughed again. “I have made you kill both these as a proof of loyalty.” Then he created Gao Ding Governor of Yiazhou and chief of three territories, while E Huan was made General. Thus the three divisions were disposed of and troubled the peace no more."
却說姜維恐救兵到，先將軍器車仗一應軍需，步兵先退，然後將馬軍斷後。細作報知鄧艾。艾笑曰：“姜維知大將軍兵到，故先退去。不必追之，追則中彼之計也。”乃令人哨探，回報果然駱谷道狹之處，堆積柴草，準備要燒追兵。衆皆稱艾曰：“將軍眞神算也！”遂遣使齎表奏聞。於是司馬昭大喜，又加賞鄧艾。,"However, Jiang Wei said that he was afraid that the rescued soldiers would arrive, so he first ordered the equipment and chariots to meet the military needs, and the infantrymen retreated first, and then cut off the horse army. Report to Deng Ai in detail. Ai smiled and said: ""Jiang Wei knows that the general's troops are coming, so we retreat first. There is no need to chase him, the pursuit will be in his plan."" soldier. Everyone called Ai and said: ""The general is really a god!"" Then he sent an envoy to report it. So Sima Zhao was overjoyed and rewarded Deng Ai.","Jiang Wei defeats Deng Ai but is betrayed at home. Jiang Wei is able to escape, because Deng Ai knows there is little point in pursuing him, as he will try to set ambushes, and, well, frankly, what is the point in chasing him! He is going back with his tail between his legs anyway. The failure of the Wu troops to support Zhuge Dan leads to horrific recriminations and consequences back in Wu.","He sent all his stores and baggage away first with the footmen, and kept the cavalry to cover the retirement. The spies reported his movements to Deng Ai, who said, “He has gone because he knew that the main army would soon be upon him. Let him go, and do not follow. If we pursue, he will play us some evil trick.” Scouts were sent to keep in touch with the retreating army, and when they returned they reported that preparations of dry woods and straws had been made in the Luo Valley to check any pursuit with fire. The officers praised the prescience of Deng Ai, “General, your calculation is superhuman!” When Deng Ai reported these matters to the capital, Sima Zhao was very pleased and confer more rewards."

却說張郃為救軍不到，心中正悶。人報魏延在關下攻打。張郃披挂上馬，却待下山，忽報：“關後四五路火起，不知何處兵來。”郃自領兵來迎。旗開處，早見張飛。郃大驚，急往小路而走。馬不堪行，後面張飛追趕甚急，郃棄馬上山，尋徑而逃，方得走脫。隨行只有十餘人，步行入南鄭，見曹洪。洪見張郃只剩下十餘人，大怒曰：“吾敎汝休去，汝取下文狀要去；今日折盡大兵，尚不自死，還來做甚！”喝令左右推出斬之。行軍司馬郭淮諫曰：“‘三軍易得，一將難求’。張郃雖然有罪，乃魏王所深愛者也，不可便誅。可再與五千兵逕取葭萌關，牽動其各處之兵，漢中自安矣。如不成功，二罪俱罰。”曹洪從之，又與兵五千，敎張郃取葭萌關。郃領命而去。,"However, when Zhang He said that he could not save the army, he felt bored in his heart. People reported that Wei Yan was attacking at the gate. Zhang He draped himself on his horse, but when he was going down the mountain, he suddenly reported, ""The four or five roads behind the pass are on fire, and I don't know where the troops are coming."" He led the troops to greet him. At the flag opening, see Zhang Fei early. He was startled and hurried to the path. The horse was unbearable, and Zhang Fei was in a hurry to chase after him. There were only a dozen or so people with him, and they walked into Nanzheng to meet Cao Hong. When Hong saw that there were only a dozen or so men left in Zhang He, he was furious and said, ""I will tell you to retire, and you will take the order to go. Today, I will destroy all the soldiers, and I will not die, so I will do more!"" The marching Sima Guo Huai admonished: ""'Three armies are easy to obtain, but one general is difficult to obtain'. Although Zhang He is guilty, he is the beloved of the King of Wei, and he cannot be easily executed. He can then go to Jiameng Pass with five thousand soldiers, and affect him. The soldiers everywhere will be safe in Hanzhong. If they do not succeed, they will be punished for both crimes."" Cao Hong followed, and together with five thousand soldiers, ordered Zhang He to take Jiameng Pass. He took orders and left.","Calling them to him, he finds out there is a very narrow pathway that means he can get behind the pass and attack from there. Wei Yan is sent with a hand-picked troop and takes up his position silently at the rear of the pass. Then Zhang Fei attacks. No sooner has Zhang He armed himself to confront the frontal attack than word comes of fires and attacks from the rear. The double attack is a complete success, and, of the men left after this battle, only ten escape with Zhang He and struggle back to Cao Hong’s camp. Although Cao Hong wants to execute him, he is dissuaded by others and eventually reluctantly agrees to supply a further five thousand men for him to use to take Jiameng pass and hold Hanzhong.","Zhang He was grieved and disappointed that Cao Hong sent no help, and the news of Wei Yan's attack only added to his sorrow. But he girded on his armor and was about to ride out when they told him that fires had started at half a dozen places behind the Pass. They most likely indicated soldiers. However, he went out to meet them, and, to his horror, when the flags opened out, his eyes fell on the figure of Zhang Fei. Away he ran along a by-road. But his steed was not fast, and as Zhang Fei pressed him close, Zhang He dismounted and ran up the mountain side. So Zhang He escaped. He had, however, some ten followers, and it was a small and dejected party that presently found its way into Nanzheng. He saw Cao Hong, and Cao Hong was very angry at his plight. “I told you not to go, but you were willful. And you gave in your written pledge. You have lost all your soldiers, yet you do not commit suicide. What will you do next?” Cao Hong ordered the lictors to put Zhang He to death. But Marching General Guo Huai, interceded. “An army is easily raised; a leader is hard to find. Though Zhang He is guilty, he is a great favorite with our prince. I think you should spare him. Rather give him command of another army and send him to take Jiameng Pass and so hold up the soldiers at all the stations. Hanzhong will be tranquil of its own accord. If he fails a second time, you can punish him for both faults.” Cao Hong was satisfied to do this, and instead of dealing with his fault, he gave Zhang He five thousand troops and told him to take the Pass. The Commanders of the Pass were Meng Da and Huo Jun."
早有人報知曹操。操顧賈詡曰：“吾事濟矣！”問：“來日是誰合向我這邊？”人報曰：“韓遂。”次日，操引衆將出營，左右圍繞。操獨顯一騎於中央。韓遂部卒多有不識操者，出陣觀看。操高叫曰：“汝諸軍欲觀曹公耶？吾亦猶人也，非有四目兩口，但多智謀耳。”諸軍皆有懼色。操使人過陣謂韓遂曰：“丞相謹請韓將軍會話。”韓遂卽出陣；見操並無甲仗，亦棄衣甲，輕服匹馬而出。二人馬頭相交，各按轡對語。操曰：“吾與將軍之父，同舉孝廉，吾嘗以叔事之。吾亦與公同登仕路，不覺有年矣。將軍今年妙齡幾何？”韓遂答曰：“四十歲矣。”操曰：“往日在京師，皆靑春年少，何期又中旬矣！安得天下淸平共樂耶！”只把舊事細說，並不提起軍情。說罷大笑。相談有一個時辰，方回馬而別，各自歸寨。早有人將此事報知馬超。超慌來問韓遂曰：“今日曹操陣前所言何事？”遂曰：“只訴京師舊事耳。”超曰：“安得不言軍務乎？”遂曰：“曹操不言，吾何獨言之？”超心甚疑，不言而退。,"Cao Cao was reported early. Cao Gu Jiaxu said, ""I have done a good job!"" He asked, ""Who will join me in the future?"" People reported, ""Han Sui."" Cao Duxian rides in the center. Many of Han Sui's subordinates did not know how to exercise, and they went out to watch. Cao shouted, ""Do your troops want to see the Duke of Cao? I'm just like a human being. I don't have four eyes and two mouths, but I have a lot of wisdom and ears."" All the troops were afraid. Cao's envoys said to Han Sui, ""The prime minister would like to invite General Han to talk."" The heads of the two horses cross each other, and each speaks on the bridle. Cao said: ""My father and the general's father are both filial and honest, and I have tried to serve him as an uncle. I am also on the road with the public, and I don't realize that I am getting older. How old is the general this year?"" Han Sui replied: ""Four It's ten years old."" Cao said: ""In the past in the capital, all of them were young and young, and it's the middle of the year! Peace and harmony in the world!"" Say it and laugh. After talking for an hour, Fang returned to the horse and parted, each returning to the village. Someone had already reported this to Ma Chao. Chao panicked and asked Han Sui, ""What did Cao Cao say before the battle today?"" Then he said, ""Just tell the old story of the capital."" Chao said, ""Does An De not talk about military affairs?"" Then he said, ""Cao Cao doesn't talk about it. Why do you say it alone?"" Chaoxin was very suspicious and retreated without saying a word.","He shouts out, ‘You know I’m Cao Cao. I’m just an ordinary human being, not some terrible demon with four eyes or many mouths!’ Then he sends a message to Han Sui, saying that he wants to meet him and talk. So Han Sui too rides out, and together, with no one else there, the two men talk of times past, of their families and of growing old. It is harmless chatter, but Cao Cao makes a point of often laughing out loud. The talk goes on for a couple of hours, and then each man rides back to his own lines. Of course, Ma Chao hears about this and, deeply suspicious, asks Han Sui what is going on. Han Sui tries to reassure him that it was harmless chatter about times past, but Ma Chao is very suspicious indeed.","Soon Cao Cao got to know what they were doing, and he turned to Jia Xu, saying, “I am succeeding.” “Who keeps the look-out on this side tomorrow?” asked Cao Cao. “Han Sui,” replied some one. Next day Cao Cao at the head of a large party of his generals rode out of the camp, and the officers presently spread out right and left, he himself remaining a solitary rider visible in the center. Han Sui did not know that Cao Cao had come out. Presently Cao Cao called out, “Do any of you soldiers want to see Cao Cao? Here I am quite alone. I have not four eyes nor a couple of mouths, but I am very knowing.” The soldiers turned pale with fright. Then Cao Cao called up a man and told him to go and see Han Sui and say, “Sir, the Prime Minister humbly asks you to come and confer with him.” Thereupon Han Sui went out, and seeing Cao Cao wore no armor, Han Sui also threw off his and rode out clad in a light robe. Each rode up to the other till their horse's heads nearly touched and there they stood talking. Said Cao Cao, “Your father and I were granted filial degrees at the same time, and I used to treat him as an uncle. You and I set out on our careers at the same time, too, and yet we have not met for years. How old may you be now?” “I am forty,” replied Han Sui. “In those old days in the capital, we were both very young and never thought about middle age. If we could only restore tranquillity to the state, that would be a matter of rejoicing.” After that they chatted long about old times, but neither said a word on military matters. They gossiped for a couple of hours before they took leave of each other. It was not long before some one told Ma Chao of this meeting, and he went over to his ally to ask about it. “What was it Cao Cao came out to discuss today ?” said Ma Chao. “He just recalled the old days when we were together in the capital.” “Did he say nothing about military matters?” “Not a word; and I could not talk about them alone.” Ma Chao went out without a word, but he felt suspicious."
孔明辭出，至中門外，迎見許靖。靖曰：“某纔赴軍師府下報一機密，聽知軍師入宮，特來至此。”孔明曰：“有何機密？”靖曰：“某適聞外人傳說，東吳呂蒙已襲荊州，關公已遇害，故特來密報軍師。”孔明曰：“吾夜觀天象，見將星落於荊、楚之地，已知雲長必然被禍；但恐王上憂慮，故未敢言。”二人正說之間，忽然殿內轉出一人，扯住孔明衣袖而言曰：“如此凶信，公何瞞我！”孔明視之：乃玄德也。孔明、許靖奏曰：“適來所言，皆傳聞之事，未足深信。願王上寬懷，勿生憂慮。”玄德曰：“吾與雲長，誓同生死；彼若有失，孤豈能獨生耶！”,"Kong Ming resigned and went outside the Zhongmen to meet Xu Jing. Jing said, ""Someone went to the military division's mansion to report a secret, and heard that the military division entered the palace, so I came here."" Kong Ming said, ""What is the secret?"" Jing said: ""A certain Shi has heard a legend from an outsider that Lumeng of Eastern Wu has attacked Jingzhou. Guan Gong has been killed, so I came here to report to the military advisor."" Kong Ming said: ""I watched the sky at night, and saw the general star falling on the land of Jing and Chu, and I knew that Yunchang would be in danger; but I was afraid that the king would be worried, so I did not dare to say anything. While the two were talking, suddenly a person came out of the hall, grabbed Kong Ming's sleeve and said, ""You are so fierce and trustworthy, why did you hide it from me!"" Kong Ming regarded it as Xuande. Kong Ming and Xu Jing said: ""What Shi Lai said are all rumors, and I have not believed enough. May the king be gracious and not worry."" Xuande said: ""I and Yun Chang swear to live and die together; How can you be alone!""","As Kong Ming returns to his quarters, Xu Jing arrives to say that Lü Meng has taken Jingzhou and that Guan Yu is dead. ‘ Sadly I’m not surprised,’ says Kong Ming, ‘because I saw a military star fall over Jingzhou last night, and so I knew that Guan Yu was no more. But we must try to keep this from Xuande.’ However, Xuande has overheard this and shouts, ‘Why did you try to keep this terrible news from me?’","As Zhuge Liang left the palace, he met Xu Jing, who said, “Instructor, I went to your residence to deliver a very secret piece of news, and they told me to find you here.” “What is your secret?” “There is a report about that Wu has got possession of Jingzhou; Lu Meng has taken it. And more than that, Guan Yu is dead. I had to come to tell you.” “I saw it in the sky some nights ago. A large star of a general fell over against Jingzhou, and I knew some evil had befallen Guan Yu. But I feared the effect upon our master, and I forbore to say anything.” They did not know that Liu Bei was standing just within the door. Suddenly he rushed out, seized Zhuge Liang by the sleeve and said, “Why did you hide from me? Why, when you had such terrible news?” “Because it is only a rumor,” replied they. “It is too improbable for belief. We pray you not to be distressed.” “By our oath we live or die together; how can I go on living if he is lost?”"

却說徐晃引軍渡漢水，王平苦諫不聽，渡過漢水紮營。黃忠、趙雲告玄德曰：“某等各引本部兵去迎曹兵。”玄德應允。二人引兵而行。忠謂雲曰：“今徐晃恃勇而來，且休與敵；待日暮兵疲，你我分兵兩路擊之可也。”雲然之，各引一軍據住寨柵。徐晃引兵從辰時搦戰，直至申時，蜀兵不動。晃盡敎弓弩手向前，望蜀營射去。黃忠謂趙雲曰：“徐晃令弓弩射者，其軍必將退也；可乘時擊之。”言未已，忽報曹兵後隊果然退動。於是蜀營鼓聲大震：黃忠領兵左出，趙雲領兵右出。兩下夾攻，徐晃大敗。軍士逼入漢水，死者無數。晃死戰得脫，回營責王平曰：“汝見吾軍勢將危，如何不救？”平曰：“我若來救，此寨亦不能保。我曾諫公休去，公不肯聽，以致此敗。”晃大怒，欲殺王平。平當夜引本部軍就營中放起火來，曹兵大亂，徐晃棄營而走。王平渡漢水來投趙雲，雲引見玄德。王平盡言漢水地理。玄德大喜曰：“孤得王子均，取漢中無疑矣。”遂命王平為偏將軍，領鄕導使。,"However, they said that Xu Huang led troops to cross the Han River, but Wang Ping refused to listen to his remonstrance and crossed the Han River to camp. Huang Zhong and Zhao Yun told Xuande: ""A certain group will lead the troops of the headquarters to welcome Cao's soldiers."" Xuande agreed. The two lead troops. Zhong said to Yun: ""Now Xu Huang is coming bravely, and let's stop fighting the enemy; when the sun goes down and the troops are exhausted, you and I can divide our troops and attack them in two ways."" Xu Huang led his troops to fight from the time of Chen until the time of Shen, and the soldiers of Shu did not move. Shaking all the bows and crossbowmen forward, Wang Shuying shot them. Huang Zhong said to Zhao Yun: ""If Xu Huang ordered the bow and crossbow to shoot, his army will definitely retreat; he can take advantage of the time to attack him."" Then the drums of the Shu camp shook: Huang Zhong led the troops to the left, and Zhao Yun led the troops to the right. With two pinch attacks, Xu Huang was defeated. The sergeant forced into the Han River, and the dead were numerous. Huang died in battle and was freed, and he returned to the camp and charged Wang Ping: ""You see that my army is in danger, why don't you save it?"" Ping said: ""If I come to save this village, I will not be able to save it. , resulting in defeat."" Huang was furious and wanted to kill Wang Ping. That night, the army of the main headquarters set fire to the camp, causing Cao's troops to be in chaos, and Xu Huang abandoned the camp and left. Wang Ping crossed the Han River to cast Zhao Yun, and Yun introduced Xuande. Wang Ping speaks volumes about the geography of the Han River. Xuande was overjoyed and said, ""I have no doubt that Prince Jun will be taken over by Hanzhong."" He then appointed Wang Ping as the general of the side and led the envoy.","As foreseen by Wang Ping, Xu Huang’s adventure to the other side of the river is a disaster. Attacked on all sides by Xuande’s troops, Xu Huang’s men suffer catastrophic losses. In the end, as Wang Ping warned him, Xu Huang is forced to try to escape back across the river. Here many of his men drown. You can therefore imagine Wang Ping’s disgust when Xu Huang comes raging up to him saying it is Wang Ping’s fault. ‘You knew the danger, so why didn’t you come and rescue us?’ ‘What!’ exclaims Wang Ping. ‘And put our base here in jeopardy! I warned you not to go.’ This simply puts Xu Huang into an even more intemperate rage. Frankly Wang Ping has had enough. That night, after setting fire to the camp, which forces Xu Huang to panic and desert the camp, Wang Ping crosses the river and surrenders to Zhao Zilong.","In spite of the most earnest dissuasion, Xu Huang crossed the river and camped. Huang Zhong and Zhao Yun asked to be allowed to go against the host of Cao Cao, and Liu Bei gave his consent. Then said Huang Zhong, “Xu Huang has been bold enough to come; we will not go out against him till evening, when his soldiers are fatigued. Then we will fall upon him one on either side.” Zhao Yun consented, and each retired to a stockade. Xu Huang appeared and for a long time tried to draw them into a fight, but they refused to go forth. Then Xu Huang ordered his bowmen to begin to shoot straight before them, and the arrows and bolts fell in the Shu camp. Huang Zhong said, “He must be thinking of retreat or he would not shoot thus. Now is our time to smite him.” Then the scouts reported that the rearmost bodies of the enemy had begun to retreat. The drums of Shu rolled a deafening peal, and Huang Zhong's army from the left and Zhao Yun's army from the right came to the attack, and the double fight began. Xu Huang was badly defeated, and the flying soldiers were forced to River Han, where many were drowned. But Xu Huang escaped after fighting desperately, and when he got back to camp, he blamed his colleague Wang Ping for not having come to his aid. “Had I done so, these camps would have been left unguarded,” said Wang Ping. “I tried to dissuade you from going, but you would not hear me, and you brought about this reverse yourself.” Xu Huang in his wrath tried to slay Wang Ping; but Wang Ping escaped to his own camp. In the night, Wang Ping set fire on both camps, and great confusion reigned in the lines. Xu Huang ran away, but Wang Ping crossed the river and surrendered to Zhao Yun, who led him to Liu Bei. Wang Ping told Liu Bei all about River Han and the country near by. “I shall surely capture Hanzhong now that you are here to help me, friend Wang Ping,” said Liu Bei. Liu Bei made Wang Ping General and Army Guide."

At that time, Deng Yang was present and asked Xue: ""You say that you are good at ""Yi"", but your words do not match the meaning of the words in ""Yi"". Why?"" Xian said: ""If you are good at ""Yi"", you don't say ""Yi""."" Yan smiled and praised it and said: ""It can be said that it is not annoying."" Because of this, he said: ""Try to make a hexagram for me: Can I reach the three princes?"" He asked: ""There are dozens of flies in the dream, and they come to collect on the nose, What sign is this?"" He said: ""Yuan, Kai, Fu Shun, Zhou Gong and Zhou, all are courteous and courteous, and enjoy many blessings. Today, the rank of monarchs and lords are respected and powerful, but those who are virtuous, and those who are afraid of power are all very careful. The way to seek blessings. The nose is also the mountain; the mountain is high and not dangerous, so it is long and noble. Now the flies stink and gather, and the high-ranking person should not be afraid? Lu: Then the three masters can come, and the flies can be driven away."" Deng Yang said angrily: ""This old man often talks about his ears!"" He said: ""The old man sees not to be born, and the frequent talker does not talk about it."" Then he walked away. . The two laughed loudly and said, ""A real madman!"" When he got home, he told his uncle. My uncle was startled and said, ""He and Deng are both powerful and powerful. How could you violate them?"" He said, ""Why should I be afraid of talking to the dead?"" My uncle asked why. Xue said: ""Deng Yang walks, his tendons are not tied to his bones, his pulse is not fleshy, he stands up and leans, if he has no hands and feet: this is the sign of 'ghost impatient'. The essence is refreshing and the smoke is floating, and the face is like a tree: This is the appearance of 'ghost and secluded'. Sooner or later, the two of them will be killed, so why should they be afraid?""","The young boy is brought in and told to trust Sima Yi and Cao Shuang. Falling upon his father’s neck, the boy weeps and will not let go. And this is how Cao Rui dies, his son weeping upon his shoulder. He is thirty-six and has reigned for thirteen years. It is not long after the enthronement of the young king that Cao Shuang begins to usurp the imperial powers. He places his own henchmen in the senior posts; builds himself palaces; steals imperial concubines from the imperial palace and removes control of the military from Sima Yi. Seeing which way the wind is blowing, Sima Yi retires and, feigning illness, disappears from sight. His sons do likewise. Things go on like this for ten years. During this time Sima Yi is so invisible Cao Shuang largely forgets about him, though he always fears him. Anxious suddenly to know whether the man still poses a threat to him, he sends Imperial Inspector Li Sheng to visit him. When Sima Yi knows who has come and why, he takes to his bed. He even pretends both that he is hard of hearing and that his mind is slipping by pretending not to understand anything Li Sheng says. ‘Death awaits me,’ he says as the visitor departs. When Li Sheng reports this to Cao Shuang, he says, ‘So I’ve nothing to fear, because he’s going to die.’ As soon as Li Sheng has gone, Sima Yi rises from his bed, calls his sons to him and says, ‘When Li Sheng reports back, Cao Shuang will no longer worry about me.","Now He Yan heard of Guan Lu's great skill in divination and sent to Pingyuan to invite him to discuss about the Book of Changes. When the soothsayer arrived, Deng Yang was of the company to meet him, and he said to Guan Lu, “You call yourself a skillful diviner, but your speech does not resemble the language of the Book of Changes. How is that?” Guan Lu replied, “An interpreter does not use the language of the original.” He Yan laughed, saying, “Certainly good words are not wearisome. But cast a lot for me, and tell me whether I shall ever arrive at the highest office or not, for I have dreamed repeatedly that many blue flies settled on my nose.” Guan Lu replied, “Gao Kai and Gao Yuan aided King Shun; Duke Zhou assisted the young Emperor Cheng of Zhou Dynasty; all these were kindly and modest and enjoyed great happiness. You, Sir, have come to high honors and wield great powers, but those who esteem you are few and those who fear you, many. You are not careful to walk in the way of good fortune. Now the nose is an eminence. If an eminence retains its characteristic, thereby it remains in honor; But is it not that blue flies gather to foul objects and the lofty fears a fall? I would wish you to give of your abundance for the good of the poor and avoid walking in the wrong road. Then indeed may you reach the highest dignity, and the blue flies will disperse.” “This is mere senile gossip,” said Deng Yang. “The gift of age is to see that which is yet to come; the gift of gossip is to perceive what is not said,” replied Guan Lu. Thereupon he shook out his sleeves and went away. “He is very mad, really,” said his two hosts. Guan Lu went home. When he saw his uncle, Guan Lu gave him an account of the interview. His uncle was alarmed at the probable consequences, and said, “Why did you anger them? They are too powerful for you to offend.” “What is there to fear? I have keen talking to two dead men.” “What do you mean?” “Deng Yang's gait is that of one whose sinews are loosed from his bones, and his pulse is unsteady. When he would stand, he totters as a man without limbs. This is the aspect of a disembodied soul. He Yan looks as if his soul was about to quit its habitation. He is bloodless, and what should be solid in him is mere vapor. He looks like rotten wood. This is the aspect of a soul even now in the dark valley.

瑾滿面羞慚，急辭下船，再往西川見孔明。孔明已自出巡去了。瑾只得再見玄德，哭告雲長欲殺之事。玄德曰：“吾弟性急，極難與言。子瑜可暫回，容吾取了東川、漢中諸郡，調雲長往守之，那時方得交付荊州。”瑾不得已，只得回東吳見孫權，具言前事。孫權大怒曰：“子瑜此去，反覆奔走，莫非皆是諸葛亮之計？”瑾曰：“非也：吾弟亦哭告玄德，方許將三郡先還，又無奈雲長恃頑不肯。”孫權曰：“旣劉備有先還三郡之言，便可差官前去長沙、零陵、桂陽三郡赴任，且看如何。”瑾曰：“主公所言極是。”權乃令瑾取回老小，一面差官往三郡赴任。不一日，三郡差去官吏，盡被逐回，告孫權曰：“關雲長不肯相容，連夜趕逐回吳。遲後者便要殺。”孫權大怒，差人召魯肅責之曰：“子敬昔為劉備作保，借吾荊州；今劉備已得西川，不肯歸還，子敬豈得坐視？”肅曰：“肅已思得一計，正欲告主公。”權問：“何計？”肅曰：“今屯兵於陸口，使人請關雲長赴會。若雲長肯來，以善言說之；如其不從，伏下刀斧手殺之。如彼不肯來，隨卽進兵，與決勝負，奪取荊州便了。”孫權曰：“正合吾意。可卽行之。”闞澤進曰：“不可：關雲長乃世之虎將，非等閒可及。恐事不諧，反遭其害。”孫權怒曰：“若如此，荊州何日可得！”便命魯肅速行此計。肅乃辭孫權，至陸口，召呂蒙、甘寧商議；設宴於陸口寨外臨江亭上，修下請書，選帳下能言快言一人為使，登舟渡江。江口關平問了，遂引人入荊州，叩見雲長，具道魯肅相邀赴會之意，呈上請書。雲長看書畢，謂來人曰：“旣子敬相請，我明日便來赴會。汝可先回。”,"With a face full of shame, Jin hurriedly resigned and disembarked, and went to Xichuan to see Kongming. Kong Ming has gone on a tour by himself. Jin had to see Xuande again and cried out that Yun Chang wanted to kill him. Xuande said: ""My younger brother is impatient, and it is extremely difficult to talk. Ziyu can go back for a while. Let me take Dongchuan and Hanzhong counties, and transfer Yunchang to guard them. Then we can hand over to Jingzhou."" Jin had no choice but to return to the east. When Wu saw Sun Quan, he made a statement. Sun Quan was furious and said, ""Ziyu has gone here, and he has been running over and over again. Could it be that it is all Zhuge Liang's plan?"" Jin said, ""No, my brother also cried to Xuande, Fang Xu will return the three prefectures first, but Yun Chang is helpless. Stubborn.” Sun Quan said, “If Liu Bei has promised to return the three counties first, he can send officials to the three counties of Changsha, Lingling, and Guiyang, and let’s see how it goes.” Jin said, “What your lord said is very true. ""Quan Nai ordered Jin to take back the old and young, and on the other hand, sent officials to serve in the three counties. A few days later, officials from the three counties were sent back, and they were all expelled. They told Sun Quan, ""Guan Yun is not willing to be compatible, so he drove back to Wu overnight. Later, the latter will be killed."" Sun Quan was furious and sent Lu Su to blame him. He said, ""Zijing used to protect Liu Bei and borrowed Jingzhou from me; now Liu Bei has taken Xichuan, and he refuses to return it. How can Zijing sit back and watch?"" Su said, ""Su has already thought of a plan, and is about to sue the lord."" Quan Ask: ""What's the plan?"" Su said: ""Now the troops are stationed at Lukou, and someone will invite Guan Yunchang to attend the meeting. If Yunchang is willing to come, speak with kind words; If you are willing to come, follow your lead to advance the army, decide the outcome, and seize Jingzhou.” Sun Quan said, “It is exactly what I want. You can do it.” Kan Zejin said, “No: Guan Yunchang is a tiger general in the world, and he cannot be reached easily. If things don't go well, they will be harmed instead."" Sun Quan said angrily, ""If this is the case, when will Jingzhou be obtained!"" He ordered Lu Su to carry out this plan quickly. Su Nai resigned from Sun Quan, went to Lukou, summoned Lu Meng and Gan Ning to discuss it; set up a banquet at the Linjiang Pavilion outside Lukou Village, revised the letter of invitation, selected a person who could speak quickly, and boarded the boat to cross the river. Jiangkou Guan Ping asked, and then he led people into Jingzhou, and he met Yun Chang, and with the intention of Lu Suxiang invited him to the meeting, he submitted a letter of invitation. After Yun Chang finished reading the book, he said to the person who came: ""I respectfully invite you, I will come to the meeting tomorrow. You can come back first.""","Zhuge Jin scuttles back to Kong Ming in Chengdu, but he is away, so it is to Xuande that he makes his complaint. ‘Tell you what,’ says Xuande. ‘ Go back to Wu. Let me finish my conquests here in Shu, and then I will invite Guan Yu to come and govern them. At that point Jingzhou can be returned.’ Realizing he has been played and now utterly humiliated, Zhuge Jin has no option but to return to Sun Quan empty-handed. Sun Quan decides to act on the earlier promise of Xuande to return some parts of the land. He sends off a group of bureaucrats to try to simply take over the disputed part of the territory. They are no match for Guan Yu’s fury, which soon sends them packing. Deeply frustrated, Sun Quan summons Lu Su, who, of course, acted as guarantor of this whole deal. He sets forth a plot. ‘ Let me lure Guan Yu to a banquet at Lukou. I’ll present our case carefully and thoroughly to him. If I can’t persuade him to surrender the territory, then, well, I’ll have him assassinated!’","Zhuge Jin, overwhelmed with shame, took his leave, sought his ship, and hastily returned to Chengdu to see his brother. But Zhuge Liang had gone away upon a journey. However, he saw Liu Bei and related what had happened, and said that Guan Yu was going to slay him. “My brother is hasty,” said Liu Bei. “It is difficult to argue with him. But return home for the present, and when I have finished my conquest of Hanzhong, I will transfer Guan Yu to another post, and then I may be able to return Jingzhou.” Zhuge Jin had no choice but to accept this reply and carry the unsatisfactory news to his master, who was greatly annoyed and said, “This running to and fro was nothing more than one of your brother's tricks.” The unhappy messenger denied, saying, “No, no! Zhuge Liang had interceded with many tears and obtained the promise to return three territories from Liu Bei. It was the obstinacy of Guan Yu that spoiled all.” “Since Liu Bei said he would return three territories, we may send officials to take over their administration. Think you that might be done?” said Sun Quan. “What you say, my lord, seems most proper.” The family of Zhuge Jin were restored to liberty, and officers were sent to take charge of the three territories of Changsha, Lingling, and Guiyang. But they quickly returned, saying, “Guan Yu would have none of us, but had chased us away at once with threats to kill us if we did not hasten!” Sun Quan then summoned Lu Su and laid the blame on him. “You are Liu Bei's guarantor in this matter; how can you sit quietly looking on while Liu Bei fails to perform his contract?” said Sun Quan. “I have thought out a plan and was just going to impart it to you,” said Lu Su. “And what is your plan?” Lu Su said, “There is a camp at Lukou; invite Guan Yu to a banquet there and try to persuade him. If he still remains obstinate, have some assassins ready to slay him. Should he refuses the banquet, then we must try conclusions with an army.” “This suits me,” said Sun Quan, “and it shall be done.” “It should not be done,” interrupted Kan Ze. “The man is as bold as a tiger and not at all like common humans. The plan will fail and result in more harm.” “Then when may I expect to get my Jingzhou?” asked Sun Quan, angrily. Sun Quan ordered Lu Su to carry out his plan, and Lu Su went to Lukou forthwith and settled the preliminaries of the banquet with Lu Meng and Gan Ning. The place selected was by the river. Then Lu Su wrote a letter and found a persuasive person to deliver it. The messenger set out and sailed across the river to the post, where he was received by Guan Ping, who conducted him to his father. “As Lu Su invites me, I will come tomorrow; you may return,” was Guan Yu's reply."
玄德入成都，百姓香花燈燭，迎門而接。玄德到公廳，陞堂坐定。郡內諸官，皆拜於堂下；惟黃權、劉巴，閉門不出。衆將忿怒，欲往殺之。玄德慌忙傳令曰：“如有害此二人者，滅其三族！”玄德親自登門。請二人出仕。二人感玄德恩禮，乃出。孔明請曰：“今西川平定，難容二主：可將劉璋送去荊州。”玄德曰：“吾方得蜀郡，未可令季玉遠去。”孔明曰：“劉璋失基業者，皆因太弱也。主公若以婦人之仁，臨事不決，恐此土難以長久。”玄德從之，設一大宴，請劉璋收拾財物，佩領振威將軍印綬，令將妻子良賤，盡赴南郡公安住歇，卽日起行。,"When Xuande entered Chengdu, the people greeted them with fragrant lanterns and candles. Xuande went to the public hall and sat down in the hall. All the officials in the prefecture worshiped under the hall; only Huang Quan and Liu Ba did not go out behind closed doors. The generals were angry and wanted to kill them. Xuande hurriedly sent an order saying: ""If you harm these two people, destroy their three clans!"" Xuande personally went to the door. Please both work. The two felt the grace of Xuande and went out. Kong Ming asked, ""Now that Xichuan is pacified, it is difficult to tolerate the two masters: you can send Liu Zhang to Jingzhou."" Xuande said: ""We have obtained Shu County, but we cannot make Ji Yu go away."" Kong Ming said: ""Liu Zhang lost his foundation and all those who lost his foundation. It's too weak. If the lord is a woman, if he is indecisive, I am afraid that this land will not last long."" Xuande obeyed and set up a large banquet, asking Liu Zhang to pack up his belongings, wearing the seal of General Zhenwei, and ordering his wife to be good. Cheap, go to the Nanjun Police Station to stay and rest, and leave on the next day.","All those who have joined Xuande are rewarded with posts and titles and vast amounts of money, and treasures are sent to Guan Yu in Jingzhou.","The people gave Liu Bei a cordial welcome, burning incense and illuminating the city. The victor went to the residence of the chief of the region, where he took his seat and was saluted by all the subordinate officials. However, Huang Quan and Liu Ba stayed away from the ceremony. This annoyed the more violent of Liu Bei's supporters, and they wished to kill the delinquents. But Liu Bei would not allow violence and threatened condign punishment to any one who might interfere with these two. When the reception was over, Liu Bei went to visit the two recalcitrants, whereupon both came out and made their obeisance. Said Zhuge Liang to Liu Bei, “We have vanquished, and all opposition in Yiazhou is at an end. But there cannot be two rulers, so you must remove Liu Zhang to Jingzhou.” “But I do not wish to exile him,” said Liu Bei. “He lost his prestige through weakness. If you are weak and undecided, you also will not last long.” Liu Bei saw his advice was good, and so he gave a great banquet whereat he begged Liu Zhang to pack up his treasures and prepare to move. He gave the dispossessed Imperial Protector the title General Who Spreads Prestige. Liu Zhang went away to Gongan in Jingzhou, taking with him his family and all his possessions."

却說鄧艾得了王瓘書信，大喜，急寫回書，令來人回報。至八月十五日，鄧艾引五萬精兵逕往墵山谷中來，遠遠使人凭高眺望，只見無數糧車，接連不斷，從山凹中而行。艾勒馬望之，果然皆是魏兵。左右曰：“天已昏暮，可速接應王瓘出谷口。”艾曰：“前面山勢掩映，倘有伏兵，急難退步；只可在此等候。”正言間，忽兩騎馬驟至，報曰：“王將軍因將糧草過界，背後人馬趕來，望早救應。”艾大驚，急催兵前進。時值初更，月明如晝。只聽得山後吶喊，艾只道王瓘在山後廝殺。逕奔過山後時，忽樹林後一彪軍撞出，為首蜀將傅僉，縱馬大叫曰：“鄧艾匹夫！已中吾主將之計！何不早早下馬受死！”艾大驚，勒回馬便走。車上火盡着——那火便是號火。兩勢下蜀兵盡出，殺得魏兵七斷八續，但聞山下山上只叫：“拏住鄧艾的，賞千金，封萬戶侯！”諕得鄧艾棄甲丟盔，撇了坐下馬，雜在步軍之中，爬山越嶺而逃。姜維、夏侯霸只望馬上為首的逕來擒捉，不想鄧艾步行走脫。維領得勝兵去接王瓘糧車。,"But he said that Deng Ai was overjoyed when he received the letter from Wang Kun, and he wrote back the letter in a hurry to get someone to return. On the fifteenth day of the eighth month, Deng Ai led 50,000 elite soldiers to the valley, and from a distance, people could see from the heights, and saw countless grain carts, one after another, traveling from the valley. Elema looked at him, and sure enough, they were all Wei soldiers. The left and right said: ""It's already dusk, you can quickly meet Wang Kuan and go out of the valley."" Ai said: ""The mountains ahead are hidden, and if there are soldiers in ambush, it will be difficult to retreat; you can only wait here."" The report said: ""General Wang is behind because he has crossed the border, and the men and horses are coming from behind. I hope to rescue him early."" Ai was shocked and urged his troops to advance. It is the beginning of time, and the moon is as bright as day. I could only hear the cry from the back of the mountain, and Ai Zhidao was fighting behind the mountain. As he ran across the back of the mountain, suddenly a Biao army crashed out from behind the woods, and Fu Yan, the leader of the Shu general, shouted: ""Deng Aipifu! My lord's plan has been hit! Why don't you get off your horse and die!"" Ai was shocked. , pulled back the horse and left. The car was on fire—the fire was the horn. The two forces went down to the Shu soldiers, killing the Wei soldiers intermittently, but when they came down from the mountain, they only shouted: ""Take Deng Ai, reward thousands of gold, seal Wanhu Hou!"" Dismounted, mixed in the infantry, climbed the mountains and fled. Jiang Wei and Xiahouba only wanted to capture Jing, who was headed immediately, and did not want Deng Ai to escape on foot. Wei led the victorious soldiers to pick up Wang Gan's grain cart.","When Wang Guan turns up to defect to Jiang Wei, claiming he is driven to this by the murder of his uncle Wang Jing and the killing of his own family, Jiang Wei is delighted. But then Xiahou Ba arrives and when he hears the news he is not delighted: ‘You can’t seriously believe this, can you? I’ve never heard about this man before. Is he really related to Wang Jing?’ But Jiang Wei laughs and confesses that he hasn’t been fooled for a moment but is going to fight fire with its own fire! So plot after plot is undertaken. False information is fed to Deng Ai, purporting to come from Wang Guan. Fooled by this, Deng Ai is drawn into an ambush and defeated, almost losing his life.","The letter, apparently from Wang Guan, was sufficient for Deng Ai, and he wrote back to say it was agreed. So on the fifteenth day, Deng Ai led out fifty thousand veteran troops and moved in sight near Yunshan Valley. And the scouts saw endless carts of grain and fodder in the distance zigzagging through the mountains. When Deng Ai got closer, he distinguished the uniforms of Wei. His staff urged him, saying, “It is getting dark; O General, hurry to help Wang Guan escort the convoy out of the valley.” “The mountains ahead are hazardous,” said the general. “If by any chance an ambush has been laid, we could hardly escape. We will wait here.” But just then two horsemen came up at a gallop and said, “Just as General Wang Guan was crossing the frontier with the convoy, he was pursued, and reinforcements are urgently needed.” Deng Ai, realizing the importance of the request, gave orders to press onward. It was the first watch, and a full moon was shining as bright as day. Shouting was heard behind the hills, and he could only conclude it was the noise of the battle in which Wang Guan was engaged. So Deng Ai dashed over the hills. But suddenly a body of troops came out from the shelter of a grove of trees, and at their head rode the Shu leader, Fu Qian. “Deng Ai, you are stupid! You have just fallen into the trap set for you by our general. Dismount and prepare for death!” Deng Ai halted and turned to flee. Then the wagons burst into flame. That flame was a signal, and down came the army of Shu. He heard shouts all round him, “A thousand ounces of gold for anyone who captures Deng Ai, and a lordship of ten thousand households as well!” Terrified, Deng Ai dropped his arms, threw aside his armor, slipped from his steed, mingled with the footmen, and with them scrambled up the hills. The generals of Shu only looked for him among the mounted leaders, never guessing that he had got away among the common soldiers. So he was not captured. Jiang Wei gathered in his victorious army and went to meet Wang Guan and his convoy."

少頃，魏主曹髦出內，令護衞焦伯，聚集殿中宿衞蒼頭官僮三百餘人，鼓譟而出。髦仗劍升輦，叱左右逕出南闕。王經伏於輦前，大哭而諫曰：“今陛下領數百人伐昭，是驅羊而入虎口耳，空死無益。臣非惜命，實見事不可行也。”髦曰：“吾軍已行，卿無阻當。”遂望龍門而來。,"After a short while, Cao Mao, the lord of Wei, went out, and ordered Jiao Bo to guard him, and gathered more than 300 officers and children of Wei Cangtou, who were in the hall, and shouted out. Mao took his sword and ascended to the chariot, and walked out of the South Tower. Wang Jing bowed in front of the chariot, wept a lot, and remonstrated, ""Now your Majesty is leading hundreds of people to attack Zhao, just to drive the sheep into the tiger's mouth. It is useless to die in vain. The minister does not cherish his life, it is impossible to see the truth."" Mao said: """" My army has already marched, and you will be unstoppable."" Then he looked at the Dragon Gate and came.","Shortly after this, Emperor Cao Mao summons his guard and with a crowd of servants some three hundred strong sets out to confront Sima Zhao. Taking his own sword, Cao Mao is riding in the imperial carriage, and as they leave the palace Wang Jing, weeping, prostrates himself and tries to stop the emperor from leaving. ‘These few men cannot fight Sima Zhao. It’s like sending sheep into the mouth of a tiger. This is pointless.’ But Cao Mao will not be deterred. ‘We’re moving out. Get out of my way,’ he says, and the procession turns out of the palace gate.","Shortly after, Cao Mao appeared, called the officer of the guard, Jiao Bo, and bade him muster his force, as many as he could. Jiao Bo got together about three hundred, and this little force marched out to the beating of a drum as escort to a small carriage, in which sat the Ruler of Wei gripping his sword. They proceeded south. Wang Jing stepped to the front and prayed Cao Mao to stay his steps and not go. “To go against Sima Zhao with such a force is driving the sheep into the tiger's jaws. To die such a death is a vain sacrifice. You can do nothing,” said Wang Jing. “Do not hinder me. I have made up my mind,” replied the Ruler of Wei, heading toward the Dragon Gate."
璋欲行，一人叫曰：“主公不納黃公衡忠言，乃欲自就死地耶？”伏於階前而諫。璋視之，乃建寧愈元人也：姓李，名恢。叩首諫曰：“竊聞‘君有諍臣，父有諍子’。黃公衡忠義之言，必當聽從。若容劉備入川，是猶迎虎於門也。”璋曰：“玄德是吾宗兄，安肯害吾？再言者必斬！”叱左右推出李恢。張松曰：“今蜀中文官各顧妻子，不復為主公効力；諸將恃功驕傲，各有外意；不得劉皇叔，則敵攻於外，民攻於內，必敗之道也。”璋曰：“公所謀，深於吾有益。”次日，上馬出榆橋門。人報：“從事王累，自用繩索弔於城門之上，一手執諫章，一手仗劍，口稱如諫不從，自割斷其繩索，撞死於此地。”劉璋敎取所執諫章觀之。其略曰：,"When Zhang wanted to go, a person called out, ""My lord does not accept Huang Gongheng's loyal words, but wants to die by himself?"" Zhang regarded him as a native of the Yuan Dynasty in Jianning: his surname was Li and his given name was Hui. He bowed his head and said, ""I have heard that 'the ruler has his ministers, the father has his son'. Huang Gongheng's words of loyalty and righteousness must be obeyed. If Liu Bei is allowed to enter Sichuan, it is like welcoming a tiger to the door."" Zhang said: ""Xuande is my Brother Zong, are you willing to harm me? Anyone who speaks again will be executed!"" Li Hui was pushed around. Zhang Song said, ""Today, the officials of the Chinese government in Shu care about their wives, and they no longer serve the master; the generals are proud of their merits, and have their own opinions; if Liu Huangshu is not allowed, the enemy will attack from the outside, and the people will attack from the inside, and they will be defeated. ""Zhang said: ""What the master is planning is more beneficial to me."" The next day, he mounted his horse and left the Yuqiao Gate. People reported: ""Wang Lei, who was engaged in work, hung himself on the city gate with a rope, held a remonstrance in one hand and a sword in the other. He said that if he refused to obey, he cut his rope and died here."" Liu Zhang took the view of the remonstrance. Of. It briefly says:","Liu Zhang decides to go and meet Xuande at Fucheng. This is strongly resisted by two of his advisers, so much so that one of them, Huang Quan, literally grips Liu ’s clothes in his teeth to try to prevent his going. The final attempt to stop him is dramatic. Liu receives notice that Wang Lei, one of his advisers, has strung himself upside down above the city gate with a letter of protest in one hand and a sword in the other. He threatens to cut the rope and crash to his death if Liu does not turn back from his planned trip and welcome. Furious that he is being denounced in this manner when he sees himself as going to meet ‘a benevolent and just man’, Liu Zhang goes on his way.","As Liu Zhang was starting, another man cried, “My lord, do you neglect the loyal words of your faithful Huang Quan to go to your death?” And he threw himself prostrate at the steps in remonstrance. He was Li Hui of Jianning. “The prince may have ministers who remonstrate with him, and the father may have children who oppose,” said Li Hui. “Huang Quan has spoken faithfully, and you ought to listen. To let Liu Bei into this land is to welcome the tiger into your gates.” “Liu Bei is my brother and will not harm me,” said the Imperial Protector. “And any other who shall oppose me shall suffer death.” So Li Hui was thrust out. “The officers of Shu regard the safety of their families and no longer render you service. The generals are arrogant, and each has some scheme of his own to further. If you do not get Liu Bei to oppose the enemy without and your own people oppose you within, surely you are on the road to ruin.” So spoke Zhang Song, and the Imperial Protector replied, “I know the plan is for my advantage.” Whereupon he mounted his horse to ride out to Elm Tree Bridge. Then a messenger reported to him: “Wang Lei has suspended himself, head downwards, at the city gate. In one hand he holds a written remonstrance and in the other a knife. And he says that if you heed him not, he will cut the rope and die at your feet.” Liu Zhang went to the gate, took the writing and read: “Good medicine is bitter in the mouth but good for the disease; faithful words offend the ear but are good for the conduct. Of old King Huai of Chu listened not to Qu Yuan, but attended the meeting at Wu Pass and was captured by the state of Qin."
姜維看畢，大怒曰：“此腐儒之論也！”擲之於地。遂提川兵來取中原。乃問傅僉曰：“以公度之，可出何地？”僉曰：“魏屯糧草，皆在長城；今可逕取駱谷，度沈嶺，直到長城，先燒糧草，然後直取秦川：則中原指日可得矣。”維曰：“公之見與吾計暗合也。”卽提兵逕取駱谷，度沈嶺，望長城而來。,"After Jiang Wei finished reading it, he was furious and said, ""This is a theory of Confucianism!"" He threw it on the ground. So he brought troops from Sichuan to take the Central Plains. So he asked Fu Yi, ""Where can we go with the public?"" Yi said: ""Wei's forage is all on the Great Wall; now we can take Luogu, go through Shenling, and reach the Great Wall, first burn the grain, and then go straight to the Great Wall. Take Qinchuan: then the Central Plains can be obtained by the end of the day."" Wei said: ""The views of the public and my plan are secretly compatible."" You sent troops to take Luogu, pass Shenling, and look at the Great Wall.","But it is Jiang Wei who opens the scroll and, reading this, he is furious and throws it away. He ignores all the warning signs and ploughs ahead with his schemes. At first he is successful, overwhelming Sima Wang, a cousin of Sima Zhao, who is commander of the city of Changcheng, where Wei supplies are stored.","“An effusion from the pen of a rotten pedant?” cried Jiang Wei wrathfully as he finished reading, and he dashed the essay on the ground in contempt. The protest was disregarded, and the army marched. “In your opinion where should we begin?” asked he of Fu Qian. Fu Qian replied, “The great storehouse of Wei is at Changcheng, and we ought to burn their grain and forage. Let us go out by the Luo Valley and cross the Shen Ridge. After the capture of Changcheng, we can go on to Qinchuan, and the conquest of the Middle Land will be near.” “What you say just fits in with my secret plans,” replied Jiang Wei. So the army marched to the Luo Valley and crossed the Shen Ridge."
却說曹操興師西征，分兵三隊：前部先鋒夏侯淵、張郃；操自領諸將居中；後部曹仁、夏侯惇，押運糧草。早有細作報入漢中來。張魯與弟張衞，商議退敵之策。衞曰：“漢中最險無如陽平關。可於關之左右，依山傍林，下十餘個寨柵，迎敵曹兵。兄在漢寧，多撥糧草應付。”張魯依言，遣大將楊昂、楊任，與其弟卽日起程。軍馬到陽平關，下寨已定。夏侯淵、張郃前軍隨到；聞陽平關已有準備，離一十五里下寨。是夜軍士疲困，各自歇息。忽寨後一把火起，楊昂、楊任兩路兵殺來劫寨。夏侯淵、張郃急上得馬，四下裏大兵擁入，曹兵大敗，退見曹操。曹操怒曰：“汝二人行軍許多年，豈不知‘兵若遠行疲困，可防劫寨’？如何不作準備？”欲斬二人，以明軍法。衆官告免。,"But it is said that Cao Cao launched his army to the west, and divided his troops into three teams: Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He in the front; Cao led his generals in the middle; Cao Ren and Xiahou Dun in the rear, escorted grain and grass. He has already made a detailed report into Hanzhong. Zhang Lu and his younger brother Zhang Wei discussed strategies to retreat from the enemy. Wei said: ""Hanzhong is the most dangerous as Yangping Pass. You can go to the left and right of the pass, close to the mountains and beside the forest, and go down more than ten fortresses to meet the enemy Cao soldiers. My brother is in Hanning, and we need to allocate more food and grass to deal with it."" Zhang Luyi said, The generals Yang Ang and Yang Ren were dispatched to set off with their younger brothers on the next day. The army and horses arrived at Yangping Pass, and the village has been settled. Xiahouyuan and Zhang He's front troops followed; Wenyang Pingguan had been prepared, and they were 15 miles away from the village. It was the night sergeant who was tired and rested. Suddenly, a fire broke out behind the village, and two soldiers from Yang Ang and Yang Ren came to rob the village. Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He hurriedly mounted their horses, and all the troops rushed in. Cao's army was defeated and retreated to meet Cao Cao. Cao Cao said angrily: ""The two of you have been marching for many years, and you don't know that 'if the soldiers are tired and tired, they can prevent the robbery of the fortress'? Why don't you make preparations?"" Officials waived.","Cao Cao conquers Hanzhong. Sun Quan escapes. It is not long before Zhang Lu learns of Cao Cao’s planned offensive. It is agreed by all his commanders to try to hold the enemy at the Yangping pass. Commanders Yang Ang and Yang Ren are sent to confront Cao Cao and his army. When Cao Cao’s advance forces arrive after their long march, they are exhausted, which is why, on the very first night they camp opposite Zhang Lu’s army, his men attack.","The expedition against the Eastern Land of Rivers went out in three divisions. Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He were Leaders of the Van; Cao Cao with his commanders marched in the center; and Cao Ren brought up the rear. Xiahou Dun was in charge of the commissariat. The spies soon carried the news into Hanzhong, and Zhang Lu called in his brother Zhang Wei to consult how to meet the attack. Said Zhang Wei, “The strategic point to hold is Yangping Pass, and there should be ten stockades there with the forest and hills to support them. You, my brother, should make your depot of supplies at Hanning.” Thereupon two generals, Yang Ang and Yan Ren, were sent with Zhang Wei to the Pass, and they built ten stockades. Soon Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He arrived and learned the Pass had prepared a defense. They camped at a point five miles away. The soldiers were fatigued after the long march, and all lay down to rest without placing proper guards. Suddenly the camp was attacked in the rear by Yang Ang and Yan Ren from different points. Xiahou Yuan and Zhang He mounted quickly and tried to beat off the attackers, but the enemy poured in all round, and their army suffered great loss. They returned to the main body to tell of their defeat, and their chief abused them for their want of care. “Old soldiers like you should have known better and taken precautions against a raid of the camp when the enemy knew your soldiers were exhausted by a long march.” Cao Cao even desired to put them to death as a warning, but their fellow-officers interceded and he spared them. Soon Cao Cao himself marched in the van."
却說鄧艾聞姜維在沓中屯田，於路下四十餘營，連絡不絕，如長蛇之勢。艾遂令細作相了地形，畫成圖本，具表申奏。晉公司馬昭見之，大怒曰：“姜維屢犯中原，不能剿除，是吾心腹之患也。”賈充曰：“姜維深得孔明傳授，急難退之。須得一智勇之將，往刺殺之，可免動兵之勞。”從事中郎荀勗曰：“不然：今蜀主劉禪溺於酒色，信用黃皓，大臣皆有避禍之心——姜維在沓中屯田，正避禍之計也。若令大將伐之，無有不勝，何必用刺客乎？”昭大笑曰：“此言最善。吾欲伐蜀，誰可為將？”荀勗曰：“鄧艾乃世之良材，更得鍾會為副將，大事成矣。”昭大喜曰：“此言正合吾意。”乃召鍾會入而問曰：“吾欲令汝為大將，去伐東吳，可乎？”會曰：“主公之意，本不欲伐吳，實欲伐蜀也。”昭大笑曰：“子誠識吾心也——但卿往伐蜀，當用何策？”會曰：“某料主公欲伐蜀，已畫圖本在此。”昭展開視之：圖中細載一路安營下寨屯糧積草之處，從何而進，從何而退，一一皆有法度。昭看了大喜曰：“眞良將也！卿與鄧艾合兵取蜀，何如？”會曰：“蜀川道廣，非一路可進；當使鄧艾分兵各進，可也。”昭遂拜鍾會為鎮西將軍，假節鉞，都督關中人馬，調遣靑、徐、兗、豫、荊、揚等處；一面差人持節令鄧艾為征西將軍，都督關外隴上，使約期伐蜀。次日，司馬昭於朝中計議此事，前將軍鄧敦曰：“姜維屢犯中原，我兵折傷甚多；只今守禦，尚自未保，奈何深入山川危險之地，自取禍亂耶？”昭怒曰：“吾欲興仁義之師，伐無道之主，汝安敢逆吾意？”叱武士推出斬之。須臾，呈鄧敦首級於階下。衆皆失色。昭曰：“吾自征東以來，息歇六年，治兵繕甲，皆已完備，欲伐吳、蜀久矣。今先定西蜀，乘順流之勢，水陸並進，併吞東吳：此滅虢取虞之道也。吾料西蜀將士，守成都者八九萬，守邊境者不過四五萬，姜維屯田者不過六七萬。今吾已令鄧艾引關外隴右之兵十餘萬，絆住姜維於沓中，使不得東顧；遣鍾會引關中精兵二三十萬，直抵駱谷：三路以襲漢中。蜀主劉禪昏闇，邊城外破，士女內震，其亡可必矣。”衆皆拜服。,"However, Deng Ai heard that Jiang Wei was in the middle of the Tazhong field, and there were more than forty camps under the road, and they were in constant contact, like a long snake. Ai Sui Ling made detailed topographical pictures, drew them into a map, and presented them with a table. When Ma Zhao of the Jin Company saw it, he was furious and said, ""Jiang Wei has repeatedly violated the Central Plains and cannot be eliminated. This is a problem for my confidants."" Jia Chong said: ""Jiang Wei has been taught by Kong Ming, and it is difficult to retreat. He must have a wise and brave general to assassinate him. If so, the labor of deploying troops can be avoided.” The master of the middle school, Xun Xu, said: “Otherwise: Liu Chan, the current master of Shu, is drowning in wine, trusting Huang Hao, and ministers all have the heart to avoid disasters-Jiang Wei is in the middle of the field, and he is avoiding it. It is also a plan of disaster. If a general is ordered to attack him, there is nothing invincible, so why use an assassin?"" Zhao Da laughed and said, ""This is the best statement. If I want to attack Shu, who can be the general?"" He is a good person, and even more Zhong Hui is the deputy general, and the great thing is accomplished."" Zhao Da said, ""This statement is exactly what I want."" He summoned Zhong Hui to enter and asked, ""I want to make you a general and go to attack the East. Wu, what is it?"" Hui said: ""My lord's intention is not to attack Wu, but really want to attack Shu."" Zhao Da laughed and said, ""Zicheng knows my heart, but what should you use when you go to attack Shu? What is the strategy?"" The meeting said, ""A certain material master wants to attack Shu, and he has already drawn a picture here."" Zhao Zhan looked at it: The picture details the places where grain and grass accumulate in the camp and Xiazhai, where to advance and where to retreat. , all have laws. Zhao Zhao looked at the great joy and said, ""You are a good general! How about Qing and Deng Ai joining forces to take Shu?"" The meeting said, ""Shu River is wide and cannot be advanced all the way. It is okay to have Deng Ai divide his troops to advance separately."" Zhao then bowed. Zhong Hui is the general of Zhenxi, false festival Yue, and the governor of Guanzhong, dispatching Qi, Xu, Yan, Yu, Jing, Yang, etc.; on the other hand, he dispatched Deng Ai to be the general of the expedition to the west, and the governor of Guanwai Long Shang, ordered the expedition of Qiqi. Shu. The next day, Sima Zhao discussed this matter in the court, and the former general Deng Dun said: ""Jiang Wei has repeatedly violated the Central Plains, and our soldiers have suffered many injuries; I am only defending the defense now, and I have not yet protected myself. Troubled?"" Zhao said angrily, ""I want to revive the teachers of benevolence and righteousness, and attack the ungodly masters, how dare you go against my will?"" In a short while, it was Deng Dun's head at the foot of the stairs. Everyone lost their color. Zhao said: ""Since I conquered the East, I have rested for six years, and I have completed my army and repaired armor. I want to attack Wu and Shu for a long time. Now I will first set up Xishu, and take advantage of the trend of the current to advance by water and land, and annex Dongwu: this The way of destroying Guo and taking Yu is also the way. I estimate that there are 80,000 to 90,000 soldiers in Xishu who guard Chengdu, 40,000 to 50,000 guards at the frontier, and only 60,000 to 70,000 Jiang Wei. Now I have ordered Deng Ai to lead soldiers from Longyou outside the border. More than 100,000, stumbling Jiang Wei in the middle of the pile, so that he can't look east; dispatching bells will lead 200,000 or 300,000 elite soldiers from Guanzhong to Luogu: three routes to attack Hanzhong. If there is an internal earthquake, his death will be inevitable."" All the people bowed in obedience.","Grovelling on the ground before Jiang Wei, Huang Hao claims he only ever tries to be of service to the kingdom and has no interest in interfering in public affairs. ‘I’m in your hands, general,’ he says, ‘and I hope you’ll be merciful.’ Confronted with such unabashed fakery, Jiang Wei strides away in anger. At a loss as to what to do and fearful that if he falls the kingdom and dynasty will too, he seeks advice from his friend Xi Zheng. It is he who suggests that Jiang Wei establish military colonies where the troops can settle, grow food, train and build up supplies ready in a few years to go on the offensive again. This also has the advantage of removing Jiang Wei from the environs of the malicious and corrupt court and thus protects him as well. Inspired by this, Jiang Wei does exactly that, and soon he and eighty thousand men are en route to the region of Tazhong to set up the colonies. When Deng Ai and Sima Zhao hear of this, they send spies to find out what exactly is going on. They decide that a pre-emptive strike is needed, and so Sima Zhao summons Zhong Hui and gives him command. They agree that they will pretend they are preparing an attack on Wu but actually are preparing to take down Shu, especially given the disordered state of affairs due to the evil influence of Huang Hao. As Sima Zhao sees him off, one of his senior advisers says, ‘You have given him one hundred thousand men, but I don’t trust him.’ Sima Zhao smiles and says, ‘Don’t worry. I know!’ He then says something to his adviser which makes him in turn smile. What did Sima Zhao say? Let’s find out. CHAPTER 116 A shaman fools the second ruler. Kong Ming’s spirit appears to Zhong Hui. ‘Zhong Hui will confound the sceptics,’ says Sima Zhao, ‘who claim we cannot win in Shu, because he has a plan.","Deng Ai heard of these dispositions and discovered that the armies of Shu were distributed in forty-eight camps, each connected with the next like the joints of a huge serpent. He sent out his spies to survey the country, and they made a map which was sent to the capital. But when the Duke of Jin, Sima Zhao, saw the memorial and the map, he was very angry. “This Jiang Wei has invaded our country many times, and we have been unable to destroy him. He is the one sorrow of my heart.” Said Jia Chong, “He has carried on the work of Zhuge Liang only too thoroughly, and it is hard to force him back. What you need is some crafty brave to assassinate him, so remove this constant menace of war.” But Adviser Xun Xu said, “That is not the way. Liu Shan, the Ruler of Shu, is steeped in dissipation and has given all his confidence to one favorite, the eunuch Huang Hao. The higher officers of state are concerned solely with their own safety, and Jiang Wei has gone to Tazhong only that he may save his life. If you send an able leader and a strong army, victory is certain. Where is the need for an assassin's dagger?” “These are excellent words,” said Sima Zhao, with a laugh, “but if I would attack Shu, where is the leader?” “Deng Ai is the ablest leader of the day,” said Xun Xu. “Give him Zhong Hui as his second, and the thing is done.” “Exactly what I think,” said Sima Zhao. So he summoned Zhong Hui and said to him, “I desire to send you as leader against Wu; can you go?” “My lord's design is not against Wu, but Shu,” was his reply. “How well you know my inmost thought!” said Sima Zhao. “But how would you conduct an expedition against Shu?” “Thinking that my lord would desire to attack Shu, I have already prepared plans. Here they are.” He laid out his maps, and thereon were shown the camps, and storehouses, and roads all complete. Sima Zhao was highly pleased. “You are an excellent leader,” said he. “What say you to going with Deng Ai?” “The Lands of Rivers is large, and there is space for more than one set of operations. Deng Ai can be sent along another line.” Zhong Hui was given the title of General Who Conquers the West and the insignia of a Commander-in-Chief over the forces within the pass and control of the armies of Qingzhou, Xuzhou, Yanzhou, Yuzhou, Jingzhou, and Yangzhou. At the same time a commission with authority flag was sent to Deng Ai giving him command of the forces without the pass, with the title of General Who Conquers the West. And the time for an attack on Shu was settled. When Sima Zhao was settling the plans in the court, General Deng Dun said, “Why are you sending our armies into a distant and dangerous country and thus inviting trouble? Jiang Wei has invaded this country many times, and the wars have cost us many lives. We should rather seek safety in defense.” “I am sending a righteous army against an unrighteous ruler; how dare you oppose my designs?” Sima Zhao ordered the executioners to put Deng Dun to death forthwith, and they soon returned to lay his head at the foot of the steps. This frightened all those present, and they turned pale. Sima Zhao said, “It is six years since I conquered the east, and the six years have been spent in preparation. I have long intended to reduce both Wu and Shu. Now I will destroy Shu, and then like a flood I will descend upon Wu and conquer that. That is the method 'destroy Guo to capture Yu.' ((Guo and Yu are two ancient states)). I can tell very nearly what forces they have in Shu. There are eighty or ninety thousand troops in the garrison of Capital Chengdu, forty or fifty thousand on the frontier, while Jiang Wei has about sixty thousand in his cantonments. Against them we can pit one hundred thousand troops under Deng Ai, enough to hold Jiang Wei and keep him from moving east, and Zhong Hui has two or three hundred thousand veterans. And they will go in three divisions straight into Hanzhong. Liu Shan, the Ruler of Shu, is a blind fool with his frontier cities in ruins, his courtiers and women quaking with fear. He will not last long.” The assembly praised this perspicacity."
孔明遂同姜維回寨，升帳商議取天水、上邽之計。維曰：“天水城中尹賞、梁緒，與某至厚；當寫密書二封，射入城中，使其內亂，城可得矣。”孔明從之。姜維寫了二封密書，拴在箭上，縱馬直至城下，射入城中。小校拾得，呈與馬遵。遵大疑，與夏侯楙商議曰：“梁緒、尹賞與姜維結連，欲為內應，都督宜早決之。”楙曰：“可殺二人。”尹賞知此消息，乃謂梁緒曰：“不如納城降蜀，以圖進用。”是夜，夏侯楙數次使人請梁、尹二人說話。二人料知事急，遂披挂上馬，各執兵器，引本部軍大開城門，放蜀兵入。夏侯楙、馬遵驚慌，引數百人出西門，棄城投羌胡城而去。梁緒、尹賞迎接孔明入城。安民已畢，孔明問取上邽之計。梁緒曰：“此城乃某親弟梁虔守之，願招來降。”孔明大喜。緒當日到上邽喚梁虔出城來降。孔明重加賞勞，就令梁緒為天水太守，尹賞為冀城令，梁虔為上邽令。孔明分撥已畢，整兵進發。諸將問曰：“丞相何不去擒夏侯楙？”孔明曰：“吾放夏侯楙，如放一鴨耳。今得伯約，得一鳳也。”,"Kong Ming then returned to the village with Jiang Wei and raised his tent to discuss plans to take Tianshui and Shanggui. Wei said: ""In Tianshui City, Yin Shang, Liang Xu, and a certain Zhihou; you should write two secret letters and shoot them into the city to cause civil strife, and the city can be obtained."" Kong Ming followed suit. Jiang Wei wrote two secret books, tied it to an arrow, rode his horse to the bottom of the city, and shot into the city. The small school found it and presented it to Ma Zun. Zun was very suspicious and discussed with Xiahou Mao, saying: ""Liang Xu and Yin Shang are connected with Jiang Wei, and if they want to be an internal response, the governor should decide early."" Mao said: ""You can kill both of them."" He said to Liang Xu, ""It is better to surrender the city to Shu, in order to gain access to it."" That night, Xiahou Mao asked Liang and Yin several times to speak. Knowing that the governor was in a hurry, the two put on their horses, each armed with weapons, and led the army of the headquarters to open the city gate and let the soldiers of Shu enter. Xiahou Mao and Ma Zun panicked and led hundreds of people out of the west gate, abandoning the city and fleeing to Qianghu City. Liang Xu and Yin Shang welcomed Kong Ming into the city. After settling down on the people, Kong Ming asked about the plan to take Shang Gui. Liang Xu said: ""This city is guarded by a certain younger brother Liang Qian, and I would like to invite him to surrender."" Kong Ming was overjoyed. Xu went to Shanggui that day and called Liang Qian out of the city to come down. Kong Ming re-enhanced the reward and made Liang Xu the prefect of Tianshui, Yin reward as the commander of Jicheng, and Liang Qian as the commander of Shanggui. Kong Ming's distribution has been completed, and the whole army is set off. The generals asked, ""Why didn't the prime minister go and capture Xiahou Mao?"" Kong Ming said, ""If I release Xiahou Mao, it would be like putting a duck's ear. Now that I have a boy's appointment, I will get a phoenix.""","After that Jiang Wei helps Kong Ming take Tianshui, while Xiahou Mao and Ma Zun flee to safety in Qianghu.","You are the one.” Jiang Wei bowed and thanked him, and they two returned to camp. Soon after their arrival, the new recruit and Zhuge Liang consulted how to capture Tianshui and Shanggui. Jiang Wei had a scheme. “The two civil officers in charge of the city, Yin Shang and Liang Xu, are excellent friends of mine,” said he, “and I will write a letter to each, shoot it over the wall tied to an arrow, and ask them to help by raising a revolt within the city.” They decided upon this, and two secret letters were duly written and sent flying over the ramparts, where they were found and taken to the Governor. Ma Zun was doubtful what action to take and consulted with Xiahou Mao, asking him to decide. “Put both the men to death,” Xiahou Mao replied. But Yin Shang heard what was toward and said to Liang Xu, “The best course for us is to yield the city to Shu and trust to them to treat us well as our recompense.” That evening Xiahou Mao sent many times to summon the two officers to him, but they thought it too great a risk to answer the call. Instead, they armed themselves and rode at the head of their own soldiers to the gates, opened them and let in the troops of Shu. Ma Zun and Xiahou Mao fled by the west gate with a hundred faithful followers and sought refuge with the Qiang tribespeople. Liang Xu and Yin Shang welcomed Zhuge Liang, who entered the city, restored order, and calmed the people. This done, Zhuge Liang asked how he might capture Shanggui. Liang Xu said, “My brother, Liang Qian, holds that city, and I will call upon him to yield it.” Thereupon Liang Xu rode over to Shanggui and called out his brother to submit. Zhuge Liang rewarded the two brothers and then made Liang Xu Governor of Tianshui; Yin Shang, Magistrate of Jicheng; and Liang Qian, Magistrate of Shanggui. Next the army prepared to advance. His officers asked, “O Minister, why do you not pursue and capture Xiahou Mao?” Zhuge Liang replied, “I let him go as I would release a duck; in my friend Jiang Wei I recognized a phoenix.”"
