少間晴霽，嬌娜已能自蘇。見生死於旁，大哭曰：“孔郎爲我而死，我何生矣！”松娘亦出，共舁生歸。嬌娜使松娘捧其首，先以金簪撥其齒，自乃撮其頤，以舌度紅丸入，又接吻而呵之。紅丸隨氣入喉，格格作響，移時豁然而蘇。見眷口，恍如夢悟。於是一門團圓，驚定而喜。生以幽曠不可久居，議同鏇里。滿堂交讚，惟嬌娜不樂。生請與吳郎俱，又慮翁媼不肯離幼子。終日議不果。忽吳家一小奴，汗流氣促而至。驚致研詰，則吳郎家亦同日遭劫，一門俱沒。嬌娜頓足悲傷，涕不可止。共慰勸之。而同歸之計遂決。,"Xiaojian Qingji, Jiao Na has been able to self-sugar. Seeing life and death, she cried and said, ""Kong Lang died for me, why am I alive!"" Song Niang also came out, and they all returned home. Jiao Na asked Song Niang to hold her head, first she used a golden hairpin to poke her teeth, then she pinched her cheeks, and then she slid her tongue into a red pill, and kissed her again. The red pill entered the throat with the air, making a rattling sound, and suddenly it came out in time. Seeing the mouth of the relatives, it is like a dream. So a reunion, surprised and happy. Born in a secluded place and cannot live for a long time, it is discussed in the same rotation. The whole house praised, but Jiaona was not happy. He asked Wu Lang to be together, and he was worried that Weng Li would not leave the youngest son. Endless discussions. Suddenly, a young slave in the Wu family came sweating and panting. When he was shocked and questioned, Wu Lang's family was also robbed on the same day, and everything was lost. Jiaona was full of sadness and couldn't stop crying. Consolation to it. And the plan to return together was decided.","In a short time, the sky cleared up and Jiaona began to revive. When she found Kong dead at her side, she cried piteously, lamenting, “Master Kong has died for me, so how can I still live!” Song also emerged from the pit, and together the women carried Kong back. Jiaona had Song hold her husband’s head up while the young master used a golden hairpin to pry open his teeth; she then pinched his cheeks, used her tongue to push her red pellet into his mouth, then joined her lips to his and blew. The red pellet was forced into his throat by the breath and his throat made a gurgling sound. In a little while, he returned to life. He saw his whole family in front of him, as if he’d just awakened from a dream. The family all gathered around in a circle, their initial fright dissipated and now filled with happiness. Because of the pit’s connection to the underworld, Kong decided they couldn’t live in their residence any longer, and proposed that they all return to his village. Everyone offered their support except for Jiaona, who seemed unhappy. Kong requested that she and her husband, Master Wu, join the rest of them, but upon thinking it over, she worried that her husband’s parents would miss their grandchildren, so they discussed the matter all day long without settling it. Suddenly a Wu family servant arrived, sweating profusely and gasping for air. Alarmed, they immediately began to ask him questions and it came out that Master Wu’s household that same day had also met with disaster, and that the entire family had been wiped out. Jianona was completely heartbroken, unable to stop crying. Together, they consoled and encouraged her. And thus the return to Kong’s hometown was planned and approved.","In a little while the storm passed, and Grace regained consciousness, only to see Kong dead by her side. ‘How can I continue to live,’ she sobbed bitterly, ‘when he has given his life for me?’ Pine came forward, and the two cousins carried his body into the house. Grace bade Pine lift up Kong's head, while her brother Huangfu prised open his mouth with a golden hairpin. Grace then pinched his cheeks and pressed a red bolus into his mouth with her tongue, pressing her lips to his and pushing the bolus deep into his throat with her breath. There was a gurgling sound as it descended, and a minute later he regained consciousness and to his great joy saw his family gathered around him. It was as if he had awoken from a dream. The place was too desolate for him to be able to settle there, and he proposed instead that they should all return with him to his former home. They agreed to this, except for Grace. When Kong saw how downcast she was, he suggested that she should bring her husband with her, but that left the unresolved problem of his parents, who would be loth to be separated from their son. They had been discussing the matter all day, when suddenly a young servant came rushing in from the Wu household, breathless and drenched in perspiration, to announce that the entire Wu family had perished that very day in a natural calamity. Grace was beside herself with grief, and stamped the ground, sobbing inconsolably. There was nothing now to prevent them from returning with Kong."
既歸，灰心木坐，了不勾當家務。居數月，出門自遁，直抵舊寺，謂弟子曰：“我即汝師。”眾疑其謬，相視而笑。乃述返魂之由，又言生平所爲，悉符。眾乃信，居以故榻，事之如平日。後公子家屢以輿馬來哀請之，略不顧瞻。又年餘，夫人遣紀綱至，多所饋遺，金帛皆卻之，惟受布袍一襲而已。友人或至其鄉，敬造之。見其人默然誠篤，年僅三十，而輒道其八十餘年事。,"After returning home, I sat down in despair and did not engage in housework. After staying for several months, he went out to escape and went straight to the old monastery, and said to his disciple, ""I am your teacher."" The crowd doubted his absurdity, looked at each other and laughed. It is the reason for the return of the soul, and also the life and actions, which are all symbols. The people believe in it, and they live in the old couch, and things are as usual. The Hou Gongzi's family repeatedly appealed to him with horses and horses, but he didn't care. After another year, his wife sent Ji Gang to arrive, and he left many gifts, but all the gold and silk were given away, but he was only given a cloth robe. Friends or to their hometown, respect and build it. Seeing that he was silent and sincere, he was only thirty years old, and he said that he was more than eighty years old.","Once he was back home, he sat, pale and lethargic, refusing to take charge of any of the family’s business. Living this way for several months, finally he slipped out the gate to escape and went straight back to the old monastery where he called out to his disciples, “ It’s me, your Master.” The monks were extremely skeptical, exchanging glances with each other and scoffing. So he related to them how his soul had returned, then described what his life with them in the monastery had been like, till it all fit together. With his disciples convinced at last, he occupied his old dais once again and resumed his daily routines. Afterwards, the young master’s family sent horses and sorrowful requests that he return, which he refused even to acknowledge. When more than a year had gone by, the young master’s wife sent a responsible servant with many gifts to leave there. He turned away the gold and silk, keeping for himself only a simple cloth robe. Some of his friends once went to Changqing and paid him a respectful visit, discovering that he had become quiet and sincere. Though he appeared to be only about thirty years old, he often spoke of events that had taken place over eighty years earlier.","On his return home, from that day onwards he sat in a bemused state, refusing to take the slightest part in family affairs. Several months went by like this, until finally one day he upped and left again, heading straight back to Changqing and his old monastery. ‘I am your Master,’ he announced to his former disciples. This time they all thought he was raving, and looked at one another and laughed. But then he started telling them of how his soul had found a new body, and recounted in precise detail a number of events in his life as a monk, all of which tallied exactly with what they knew of their Master. They were obliged to believe him. He slept once more in his old bed, and they waited on him as they had done before. The young nobleman's family came several times, with a great cortege of carriages and horses, and pleaded with him to go home with them, but he turned a deaf ear to their entreaties. More than a year later, his wife sent a household steward with rich gifts of gold and silk, all of which he refused, except for a single plain cotton robe, which he kept for his own use. From time to time his friends from Henan Province would call on him if they were in the neighbourhood. They found a man of quiet dignity and sincerity, barely thirty years old but with the wisdom of a man fifty years his senior."
凌晨，道士呼王去，授一斧，使隨眾采樵。王謹受教。過月餘，手足重繭，不堪其苦，陰有歸志。一夕歸，見二人與師共酌，日已暮，尚無燈燭。師乃剪紙如鏡粘壁間，俄頃月明輝室，光鑒毫芒。諸門人環聽奔走。一客曰：“良宵勝樂，不可不同。”乃於案上取酒壺分賚諸徒，且囑盡醉。王自思：七八人，壺酒何能遍給？遂各覓盎盂，競飲先釂，惟恐樽盡，而往複挹注，竟不少減。心奇之。俄一客曰：“蒙賜月明之照，乃爾寂飲，何不呼嫦娥來？”乃以箸擲月中。見一美人自光中出，初不盈尺，至地遂與人等。纖腰秀項，翩翩作“霓裳舞”。已而歌曰：“仙仙乎！而還乎！而幽我於廣寒乎！”其聲清越，烈如簫管。歌畢，盤鏇而起，躍登幾上，驚顧之間，已複爲箸。三人大笑。又一客曰：“今宵最樂，然不勝酒力矣。其餞我於月宮可乎？”三人移席，漸入月中。眾視三人，坐月中飲，鬚眉畢見，如影之在鏡中。移時月漸暗，門人燃燭來，則道士獨坐，而客杳矣。幾上餚核尚存；壁上月，紙圓如鏡而已。道士問眾：“飲足乎？”曰：“足矣。”“足，宜早寢，勿誤樵蘇。”眾諾而退。王竊欣慕，歸念遂息。,"In the early morning, the Taoist priest called the king to go, gave him an axe, and asked the crowd to gather firewood. Wang Jin was taught. After more than a month, my hands and feet are calloused, and I can't bear the pain. Returning home overnight, I saw the two of them having a drink with their teacher. The teacher is paper-cut like a mirror sticking to the wall, and the moon is shining brightly in the room, and the light is reflected in a ray of light. The people of the gates listened and ran. One of the guests said: ""A good night is a joy, and it cannot be different."" Wang Zisi: Seven or eight people, how can you give the pot of wine all the time? So they all searched for an ounce of pot, and they competed to drink it first, for fear that the bottle would run out. Intrigued. A guest in Russia said, ""I have been given the moonlight, and I drink silently. Why don't you call Chang'e to come?"" He threw a chopstick into the moon. I saw a beautiful woman emerging from the light, not full of feet at first, and then waited with others when she reached the ground. Slim waist and show items, elegantly do ""Neon Dress Dance"". He just sang: ""Xianxian! And still! And you are quiet in the vast cold!"" His voice was clear and clear, as strong as a flute. After the song was over, he circled up, jumped up a few times, and in shock, it was turned into a chopstick. The three laughed. Another guest said: ""Tonight is the most fun, but I can't beat the power of wine. Can I have a meal in the Moon Palace?"" The three moved their seats and gradually entered the middle of the moon. The crowd looked at the three of them, drinking while sitting on the moon, all the men and women saw them, like shadows in the mirror. As the time passed, the moon became dark, and the disciples came to light candles. The Taoist priest sat alone, and the guests were gone. The nuclei still exist on a few walls; the moon on the wall is just as round as a mirror. The Taoist priest asked the crowd, ""Are you enough to drink?"" He said, ""It's enough."" Wang Chi admired and resigned.","Wang kowtowed to all of them and succeeded in being allowed to stay at the monastery. As the morning sun rose, the Daoist priest called for Wang to get an axe, sending him out with the many others to select and collect firewood. Wang solemnly listened, doing as he was instructed. After a month of this, he developed thick calluses on both hands and feet, could no longer endure his hardships, and began nurturing a private desire to return home. One evening he returned to see two visitors drinking together with his master. Though the sun had already given way to dusk, still no lamps or candles had been lit. The master then cut paper with scissors to form a mirror shape and pasted it to the wall. In an instant the room glowed with the bright splendor of the moon, a brightness sufficient to reveal even the finest hairs or corn silks. All the disciples heard about this and rushed to the room. One of the visitors said, “It’s a fine night to enjoy the sublimely beautiful together.” The Daoist reached for a wine jar on the table and gave it to his disciples, urging them to drink all they could. Wang considered to himself: how can seven or eight people all get enough from just one wine jar? Then each of them looked for something suitable to drink from, vying to be the first to drain a goblet for fear that the wine would run out; but as they kept pouring from it time and time again, it didn’t seem to be reduced even a little. Wang felt this was very strange. Suddenly one of the guests spoke up: “Thank you for granting us the bright, shining light of the moon— it’s just that it’s kind of lonesome drinking wine by itself. Why not call the moon goddess to come down here?” Taking a chopstick, the Daoist proceeded to fling it into the center of the paper moon. They saw a beautiful lady emerge from the midst of the rays. At first not even quite a foot tall, by the time she reached the ground she was equal in size to a regular person. With her tiny waist and elegant neck, she lightly performed the “rainbow skirt dance.” And then she sang, As I dance airily, I must either return to the mortal world Or remain secluded in the icy Moon Palace! Her voice was exceedingly clear, as resonant as the notes of a xiao flute. Having finished her song, she spun around and rose up, jumping up onto the table, and with everyone looking at her in surprise, she turned herself into a chopstick again. The three men roared with laughter. Again one of the visitors spoke: “This evening has been perfectly enjoyable, but the wine’s potency is getting to me. Would you agree to have a farewell drink with me in the Moon Palace?” The three men relocated their banquet, gradually, to the center of the paper moon. The crowd of disciples gazed upon them sitting there, drinking, their beards and eyebrows totally visible as if images in a mirror. After some time, the moon grew dark; a disciple, however, brought a candle. The Daoist priest was discovered sitting alone as normal, the guests long gone. The leftovers from earlier were still in dishes on the table, but the moon on the wall was now just a piece of paper shaped like a circular mirror. The Daoist asked his disciples, “Have you had enough to drink?” “Quite enough,” they replied. “If so, then you’d better get to bed—you won’t be able to collect firewood if you’re not rested.” The group promised they would do so and withdrew. Wang was secretly both happy and jealous, so he stopped thinking about going back home.","The priest had several disciples, and when they assembled towards evening, Wang bowed to each one of them in turn. Early the following morning, the priest summoned Wang, gave him an axe and told him to go and cut wood with the others. Wang promptly obeyed. After a month or so of this, his hands and feet were a mass of blisters. He decided he could bear it no longer and secretly began to long for home. One evening, he returned from his chores to see two men sitting and drinking with the priest. It was already dusk, but the lamps had not yet been lit. Instead the priest cut out a circular piece of paper and stuck it on the wall like a round mirror, whereupon the room was instantly bathed in dazzling light. The mirror had become a veritable moon. The disciples stood around in a ring, coming and going at the priest's beck and call. ‘On such a fine night as this,’ remarked one of the guests, ‘we should share our pleasure with one and all.’ So saying, he took a wine jug from the table and began pouring for all the disciples, bidding them drink their fill and be merry. ‘How can that one jug possibly provide for all seven or eight of us?’ thought Wang silently to himself. The disciples went in search of more goblets, each eager to have a drink before the wine ran out. But, however often the wine was poured, to their amazement the supply never seemed to diminish. ‘You have graciously provided us with this moonlight,’ said one of the priest's guests. ‘Should we not enliven the occasion by inviting the goddess Chang E to join us from her palace?’ With this he tossed one of his chopsticks at the ‘moon’, and a beautiful lady appeared in the middle of the circle of light, at first no more than a foot high, but attaining a full woman's height as she descended to the ground. Her slender waist and graceful arching neck were soon swaying to the steps of the centuries-old dance known as ‘Rainbow Skirts’. And when the dance was finished, she began to sing: Lightly lightly Have I danced! Is this the world of men, Or am I still confined In my Cold Palace Of the moon? Her voice was pure and thrilling, like the sound of the flute. When her song was done, she pirouetted up on to the table and, before her astonished audience knew what was happening, was once more transformed into a chopstick. The three men at the table laughed heartily. ‘What a splendid evening this has been!’ exclaimed one of them. ‘But I don’t think I can drink much more. Will you gentlemen accompany me for a last cup of farewell in the Palace of the Moon?’ The three of them rose, walked slowly towards the wall and entered the moon. The disciples watched them sitting up there drinking, perfectly visible down to the last whisker and eyebrow, as clear as a reflection in a mirror. Presently the moon began to fade, and when the disciples lit candles they beheld their Master sitting quite alone at the table. His companions were nowhere to be seen. The sweetmeats were still on the table, the moon no more than a mirror-shaped circle of paper on the wall. ‘Have you all drunk your fill?’ asked the priest of his disciples. ‘Yes, Master,’ was the reply. ‘Then early to bed. Tomorrow there will be more wood to chop and grass to cut.’ The disciples retired obediently for the night. Wang was thrilled by what he had witnessed, and his earlier thoughts of admitting defeat and abandoning his Taoist ordeal evaporated."
張某暴卒，隨鬼使去見冥王。王稽簿，怒鬼使誤捉，責令送歸。張下，私浼鬼使求觀冥獄。鬼導曆九幽，刀山、劍樹，一一指點。末至一處，有一僧紮股穿繩而倒懸之，號痛欲絕。近視則其兄也。張見之驚哀，問：“何罪至此？”鬼曰：“是爲僧，廣募金錢，悉供淫賭，故罰之。欲脱此厄，須其自懺。”張既蘇，疑兄已死。,"Zhang died violently and went to see Hades with a ghost. Wang Jibo was mistakenly captured by an angry ghost and ordered to return. Zhang Xia, a private ghost envoy asks to see the hell. Ghost guide calendar Jiuyou, knife mountain, sword tree, one by one. At the last place, a monk tied his strands through a rope and hung upside down, screaming in agony. Myopic is his brother. Zhang Jianzhi was startled and asked: ""What's the crime?"" The ghost said: ""It's a monk who raises money widely, and all of them make offerings to prostitution and gambling, so he punishes him. If he wants to get rid of this evil, he must repent himself."" Zhang Jisu, Suspected brother is dead.","A man named Zhang suddenly died, so he complied with a ghost envoy who came to take him to see the Hell King. The king examined his book of death records and became furious with the ghost envoy for accidentally having brought him the wrong person, reproachfully ordering that he be taken back. As Zhang walked out of the king’s presence, he secretly asked a favor of the envoy, begging for a look at Hell’s prisons. The ghost guided him through the various levels of the underworld, past the Mountain of Swords and the Grove of Daggers, pointing out each spot one by one. At last they arrived at a place where there was a Buddhist monk, hanging by a rope that had been inserted into a hole bored through his thigh, howling in pain and begging to be cut down. Approaching to take a closer look, Zhang could see it was his elder brother. The sight left Zhang terrified and distressed as he asked, “What crime has deserved this?” The ghost replied, “He was a monk who traveled widely to solicit large monetary donations which he spent on whoring and gambling—and that’s the reason for his punishment. If he wishes to be free of this torment, he must repent for what he has done.” Mountain of Swords: The daoshan is a proverbial signifier of quintessential threat or punishment. It might be compared with Sisyphus’s stone or Ixion’s wheel in Greek myth. Once Zhang had been restored to life, he figured that his elder brother must have died already.","A man named Zhang died suddenly and was escorted at once by devil attendants into the presence of Yama, King of the Underworld. Yama checked his registers and turned angrily to the attendants, informing them that they had brought the wrong man and were to take him back immediately. As they left, Zhang secretly entreated his devil guards to let him have a quick look at Hell and they led him all the way through the Nine Dark Places, past the Mountain of Knives and the Forest of Swords, pointing out the various sights one by one. By and by they reached a place where a Buddhist monk was hanging upside down in the air, suspended by a rope through a hole in his leg. He was crying out in excruciating pain. As Zhang approached, he saw to his great horror and distress that the man was his own brother. He asked his guards the reason for this appalling punishment, and they informed him that the monk had been condemned to this torment for having collected alms on behalf of his order, which he had then squandered on gambling and debauchery. ‘Nor,’ they added, ‘will his punishment cease until he repents his misdeeds.’ When Zhang regained consciousness, fearing that his brother must already be dead, he hurried off to the Xingfu Monastery, where he had been in residence."
〈山魈〉,<Mandrill>,7.,Sun Taibo told me this story.
江西孟龍潭與朱孝廉客都中，偶涉一蘭若，殿宇禪舍，俱不甚弘敞，惟一老僧掛褡其中。見客入，肅衣出迓，導與隨喜。殿中塑志公像，兩壁畫繪精妙，人物如生。東壁畫散花天女，内一垂髫者，拈花微笑，櫻唇欲動，眼波將流。朱注目久，不覺神搖意奪，恍然凝思；身忽飄飄如駕雲霧，已到壁上。見殿閣重重，非複人世。一老僧說法座上，偏袒繞視者甚眾，朱亦雜立其中。少間似有人暗牽其裾。回顧，則垂髫兒囅然竟去，履即從之，過曲欄，入一小舍，朱次且不敢前。女回首，搖手中花遙遙作招狀，乃趨之。舍内寂無人，遽擁之亦不甚拒，遂與狎好。既而閉戶去，囑勿咳。夜乃複至。如此二日，女伴共覺之，共蒐得生，戲謂女曰：“腹内小郎已許大，尚發蓬蓬學處子耶？”共捧簪珥促令上鬟。女含羞不語。一女曰：“妹妹姊姊，吾等勿久住，恐人不歡。”群笑而去。生視女，髻雲高簇，鬟鳳低垂，比垂髫時尤豔絕也。四顧無人，漸入猥褻，蘭麝熏心，樂方未艾。,"Among the guest capitals of Menglongtan and Zhu Xiaolian in Jiangxi, Lan Ruo was occasionally involved, and the temples and temples were not very open, and only an old monk hung in them. Seeing guests come in, clean clothes and go out, guide and rejoice. There is a statue of Duke Zhi in the hall, and the two murals are exquisitely painted, and the characters are like life. In the east mural, the goddess with scattered flowers, a person with a stubble, smiles with a flower, her lips are about to move, and her eyes will flow. Zhu stared at it for a long time, he didn't realize his mind was shaken, and he suddenly meditated; Seeing that the halls and pavilions are heavy, they are not reincarnated. An old monk preached at the seat, and there were many people who were biased and looked around, and Zhu also stood among them. There seems to be someone secretly holding his back. Looking back, the drooping beard went as fast as he could, and he followed it, crossed the curly fence, and entered a small house, but Zhu Ci did not dare to go forward. The woman looked back and waved Hua Yaoyao in her hand as a gesture, which she followed. There was no one in the house, and even if he embraced him, he did not refuse, so he made good friends with him. After closing the house, I asked not to cough. Night comes again. After two days like this, the female companions felt it together, they searched for life together, and joked to the girl: ""The little boy in the belly has grown up, and he is still a virgin?"" The woman was shy. A woman said, ""Sister and sister, please don't stay for a long time, for fear of being unhappy."" The group laughed and left. Born as a female, the bun is high and the clouds are clustered, and the phoenix is low, which is more beautiful than when the bun is down. Looking around at no one, gradually becoming obscene, Lan Musk is intoxicated, and the music is still in the ascendant.","Meng Longtan, from Jiangxi province, was visiting the capital with a juren named Zhu. By chance they found themselves at a Buddhist monastery, where neither the hall nor the meditation chambers were particularly spacious or grand, and which was occupied only by a single aged monk. Seeing the visitors, he made his robe look respectable and came out to greet them, then showed them around. In the midst of the hall was a statue of Zhigong, a magic monk of the Han dynasty. On either side were murals painted in intricate detail, vividly depicting lifelike human figures. The east mural was of the “Heavenly Maidens Scattering Flowers,” in which a teenage girl picks a flower with a wistful smile, her cherry lips on the verge of opening and the waves in her eyes about to flow. Zhu stared at her for a long time, unaware of how his mind was wandering, until he fell into a trance. “Heavenly Maidens Scattering Flowers”: A common motif of offering in Buddhist art, the heavenly maidens, known as Devatas in India and as Tennyo or Tennin in Japan, are frequently pictured in illustrations of the sutras, strewing lotus flowers that become the seats for pious Buddhists. For more bawdy lotus symbolism, see Eberhard (169-70). His body suddenly began floating and fluttering as though sailing on a cloud, till he found himself entering the mural. There he saw countless halls and pavilions totally unlike those in the world of mortals. An aged Buddhist monk sitting on a dais preached the Dharma while a considerable crowd of monks, wearing robes that bared one shoulder, watched. Zhu mixed in and stood amongst them. Soon, he seemed to feel someone covertly yanking at the front of his garment. He turned to find the mural’s teenage girl. She smiled and walked away. Following her along a winding railing until she entered a small chamber, Zhu then held back, hesitantly, rather than venturing any further. The girl turned her head, raising the flower in her hand in a beckoning motion, so he hurried to her. Since there was no one else inside the quiet chamber, he hastily embraced her, and meeting very little resistance from her, they proceeded to make love. When they were finished, she locked the door and left, advising him not even to cough. Then she returned that evening. This went on for two days. The girl’s companions perceived that something was up and searched together until they found him, then made fun of the girl by teasing, “A little guy’s already getting big inside your belly, yet you still wear your hair loose like a virgin?” They held out hairpins and earrings, urgently insisting that she put her hair up. The girl, feeling ashamed, did not speak. One of the other girls said, “Sisters all, we mustn’t hang around any longer—otherwise they’ll be unhappy.” Laughing, then, the group went away. Zhu took a good look at the girl, her hair coiled up high while her phoenix earrings dangled low, and with the contrast he found her even more lovely than when she wore her hair down. Checking to be sure no one else was around, he began taking more indecent liberties with her; with her orchid and musky fragrance suffusing his senses, he indulged his pleasures without ceasing.","In the main hall stood a statue of the Zen Master Baozhi, and there were superb murals on the two flanking walls, representations of men and animals that seemed to breathe with life. On the eastern wall was a painting of Apsaras Scattering Flowers, beautiful fairylike beings, among whom Zhu noticed one maiden with unbound hair, a flower in her hand and a magically smiling face. Her lips seemed to move, and the light in her eyes rippled like water. Zhu stared at this maiden like a man transfixed, and was soon utterly transported by the vision. He was wafted bodily up on to the wall and into the mural itself. He felt himself pillowed on clouds, and saw stretching before him a grand panorama of palaces and pavilions, a veritable fairy realm. He could see an aged abbot preaching the Dharma from a pulpit, surrounded by a throng of robed monks. Zhu was mingling with the crowd when presently he felt someone secretly tugging at his sleeve, turned to look, and saw the maiden with the unbound hair walking smilingly away from him. He followed her down curving balustraded pathways to the doorway of a small pavilion, where he hesitated. The maiden looked back and beckoned him on with the flower that she still held in her hand. So he followed her into the pavilion, where they found themselves alone, and where with no delay he embraced her and, finding her to be far from unreceptive, proceeded to make love to her. Afterwards she left him and went away, closing the door behind her and bidding him not to make the slightest sound. That same night she returned, and so their liaison continued for a further two days. Her female companions perceived soon enough that there was something afoot, and discovered Zhu in his hiding place. ‘Look at you!’ they teased the girl. ‘You've most probably got a baby on the way by now, and still you wear your hair like a little girl!’ They brought out hairpins and pendants, and helped her put up her hair like a grown woman, while all along she maintained a coy silence. ‘Come, sisters, let's go!’ cried one of them. ‘We’re spoiling their fun!’ And off they went, giggling among themselves. Zhu gazed at her once more. With hair now piled high in a black cloudlike chignon and phoenix ornaments hanging down from it, she seemed even more adorably beautiful than before. They were alone again and soon fell to further sports of love, his senses suffused with the heady perfume that emanated from her body, a scent of orchid mingled with musk."
至日，使華裝行新婦禮，女笑極不能俯仰，遂罷。生以憨癡，恐泄漏房中隱事，而女殊密祕，不肯道一語。每值母憂怒，女至一笑即解。奴婢小過，恐遭鞭楚，輒求詣母共話，罪婢投見恒得免。而愛花成癖，物色遍戚黨；竊典金釵，購佳種，數月，階砌藩溷無非花者。庭後有木香一架，故鄰西家，女每攀登其上，摘供簪玩。母時遇見輒訶之，女卒不改。一日西人子見之，凝注傾倒。女不避而笑。西人子謂女意屬己，心益盪。女指牆底笑而下，西人子謂示約處，大悦。及昏而往，女果在焉，就而淫之，則陰如錐刺，痛徹於心，大號而踣。細視非女，則一枯木臥牆邊，所接乃水淋竅也。鄰父聞聲，急奔研問，呻而不言；妻來，始以實告　火燭窺，見中有巨蠍如小蟹然，翁碎木，捉殺之。負子至家，半夜尋卒。鄰人訟生，訐發嬰寧妖異。邑宰素仰生才，稔知其篤行士，謂鄰翁訟誣，將杖責之，生爲乞免，遂釋而出。母謂女曰：“憨狂爾爾，早知過喜而伏憂也。邑令神明，幸不牽累。設鶻突官宰，必逮婦女質公堂，我兒何顏見戚里？”女正色，矢不複笑。母曰：“人罔不笑，但須有時。”而女由是竟不複笑，雖故逗之亦終不笑，然竟日未嚐有戚容。,"On the day of the solstice, the bride is dressed in a splendid attire, and the woman smiles so hard that she can't look down. Born with foolishness, she is afraid of revealing the secrets in the room, but Nvshu is secretive and refuses to say a word. Every time the mother is worried and angry, the daughter will solve it with a smile. The slaves and servants are too small, and they are afraid of being whipped, so they ask their mothers to talk to each other, and the sinful servants will be spared. And the love of flowers has become an addiction, and they have been searching all over the party; There is a wooden incense rack in the back of the court, so it is adjacent to the Western family, and every time the woman climbs on it, she picks the hairpin for play. When the mother met Noir Hezhi, the female soldier did not change. One day, the Westerners saw him, and he was poured out. The woman smiled involuntarily. Westerners say that women's minds belong to themselves, and their hearts are more volatile. The woman pointed to the bottom of the wall and smiled, and the western man said that he was at the place of the promise, and he was very happy. And when he goes in the dark, the female fruit is there, and he is lustful, and the yin is like a cone thorn, and the pain is piercing in the heart, and the large size is stunned. If you look closely at the non-woman, you will see a dead wood lying beside the wall, which is connected to the orifice of water. The neighbor's father heard the sound and rushed to investigate, but he groaned without saying a word; when his wife came, he began to tell the truth, peeping with a fire and candle, and saw that there was a giant scorpion like a small crab. Negative son arrives home, looking for pawns in the middle of the night. Neighbors litigated students and scolded Yingning as strange. Yi Su Yang was a talented person, and Nim knew that he was a virtuous man. He said that his neighbor was slandering him with a lawsuit, and he blamed him with a stick. The mother said to her daughter: ""Han Kuang Er, I knew that I was overjoyed, but I was worried. The city commander is a god, but fortunately I don't get involved. If the falcon is a sudden officer, the woman will be arrested and held in court. How can my son see Qili?"" Straightforward, Ya no longer smiles. The mother said: ""People don't laugh, but they have to have time."" And the girl didn't laugh anymore, even though she was teasing her, she didn't laugh, but she didn't have a face.","When the wedding day arrived, they had her magnificently dressed for the marriage ritual; but Yingning was laughing so hard that she was unable to kneel properly, so they gave up that part of the ceremony. Because of all her foolishness, Wang feared she might divulge the details of their sexual intimacy; but Yingning was especially careful, and didn’t give anything away with her words. Whenever Wang’s mother became worried or angry, Yingning would appear, and even a single laugh would make her feel better. If the servants or maids ever went a little too far and feared they might suffer a whipping for their actions, they’d beg Yingning to visit Wang’s mother and speak on their behalf; the guilty maids who trusted themselves to her mediation were usually excused. But she had a persistent craving for flowers, searching high and low for them, from relatives and friends; she even pawned a gold hairpin to purchase the seeds for especially beautiful varieties, until after several months there wasn’t a stair, pathway, fence, or outhouse that wasn’t surrounded by flowers. In the rear of the courtyard, there was a trellis of banksia roses that had been planted by the family of the neighbor to the west. Yingning often climbed up it to pick some flowers to wear in her hair for fun. Wang’s mother would scold her whenever she saw her doing so. Yingning, however, would never change her ways. One day, the neighbor’s son saw her and couldn’t take his eyes off her , he was so smitten by her beauty. Yingning didn’t try to avoid him, but just laughed. The neighbor’s son thought she was making herself available to him, so his heart filled with desire. Yingning pointed to a place at the base of the wall, laughed, and then climbed down, while the neighbor’s son, thinking she was proposing a rendezvous there, was deliriously happy. Once night fell, he went to the spot, and Yingning was already waiting there. He pulled her close and thrust himself into her, but felt something like an awl stab his privates with a pain that penetrated to his very heart, and after screaming madly, he stumbled and fell. On closer examination, he saw that it wasn’t Yingning, but a rotten log leaning against the wall, and the place he’d thrust into was a soggy knothole. When his father next door heard him yell, he hurriedly rushed over to find out what had happened, but his son merely groaned and wouldn’t say anything. Once the man’s wife appeared, however, the son told them everything. When they lit a torch and examined the knothole, they saw that inside it was a huge scorpion, the size of a small crab. The old man split the log open, then caught and killed the scorpion. He hoisted his son onto his back and carried him home, where he died in the middle of the night. The neighbor brought a suit against Wang, alleging that Yingning was a demon spirit. The county magistrate, who thought of Wang as an admirable man of talent and knew he was a scholar of sincere and honest intentions, determined that the old neighbor was making a false accusation, and was about to have him beaten as punishment. Wang interceded to have the sentence dropped, so the matter was cleared up and the neighbor released. Wang’s mother told Yingning, “This idiocy has gone far enough, and I knew that this excessive frivolity was covering up something worth worrying about. It’s lucky for you that the magistrate didn’t implicate you; if he’d been a muddle-headed official, you’d certainly have been arrested and tried in court—how could my son and I face our relatives and neighbors then?” Yingning wore a serious expression and swore she’d never laugh again. Wang’s mother said, “People don’t have to stop laughing, but they mustn’t do it all the time.” But because of all this, Yingning never laughed again, and even if she was teased, she still wouldn’t laugh; but she also never, ever looked sad.","She spied on the girl during the day, but never detected anything untoward. She certainly had a shadow like a normal living human. On the wedding day, they dressed her up in a bridal gown and prepared her for the ceremony, but then she was taken with one of her laughing fits and became quite incapable of standing or kneeling properly, so in the end the usual formalities had to be dispensed with. After the wedding, Wang, in view of his wife's complete naivety, was anxious that she might make some inappropriate reference to their private sexual relations. But she turned out to be particularly discreet in this regard, and never once said anything of the kind. Quite the contrary. She was in every way the very soul of discretion and sensitivity. If ever his mother was depressed or angry, all it needed was for Yingning to come and laugh, and the dark mood was at once dispelled. And if the maids were ever in any sort of trouble and feared a beating, they would ask Yingning to intercede on their behalf with the mistress and she always won them a free pardon. She was passionately fond of flowers, and was always seeking to obtain new varieties from friends and relations. She even secretly pawned her own jewellery in order to buy more flowers, and after a few months every little corner of the house, every terrace, every fence, every shed, even the privy, had its floral display. In the Wangs’ back garden there was a banksia rose that had strayed from their neighbours’ garden to the west, and was rambling all over a trellis. Yingning would often go there and climb the trellis to pick some of the fragrant blossoms for her hair. Mrs Wang reprimanded her for this, but she paid no heed. One day when she was up the trellis, the neighbour's son caught sight of her and was instantly smitten. He stared at her, and Yingning, with her usual directness, smiled back. He, thinking that she was leading him on, became more aroused than ever. Still with a broad smile on her face, Yingning pointed to a spot on his side of the wall, before climbing back down on to her own side. The young man was beside himself with joy at what he took to be an assignation, and returned to the same spot that very evening, to find her waiting for him. He lost no time, and began to make love to her at once, only to feel a fierce shooting pain in his member, as if a sharp awl were boring into it. He fell with a great cry to the ground, and then, when he strained his eyes, saw before him not a beautiful woman but a rotten old log propped up against the wall. He had been making love to a dank hole worn in the log by the dripping rain. The young man's father heard him scream and came hurrying to his aid, but in reply to his questions the youth could only groan. It was only when his wife came to his side that he told the truth. They lit a lamp and shone it at the log, discovering in the hole a huge scorpion, the size of a small crab. The father, having chopped open the log and killed the scorpion, carried his son into the house, but later that night the young man died. The family took young Wang to court, accusing his wife of sorcery. But the Magistrate, who had a high opinion of Wang and knew of his excellent reputation, dismissed the charge as false and would have had the dead youth's father caned had not Wang intervened on his behalf and procured his release. Wang's mother spoke to Yingning afterwards. ‘This time your silliness has really gone too far! I always knew there was something strange about your excessive cheerfulness, and that it would bring trouble and sorrow sooner or later. Luckily for you the Magistrate is a wise man, and the case will go no further. But if it had been some fool of a judge, he would have had you arrested and questioned in court, and my poor son would never have been able to hold his head up in public again!’ Yingning looked at her seriously for a moment and swore that she would never laugh again. ‘There's nothing wrong with laughing,’ said Mrs Wang. ‘But it should be in the right place and at the right time.’ From that day forth, Yingning never laughed again. Even if someone tried to provoke her, she kept a straight face, though never an unpleasantly gloomy one."
明末濟屬多盜，邑各置兵，捕得輒殺之。章丘盜尤多。有一兵佩刀甚利，殺輒導窾。一日捕盜十餘名，押赴市曹。内一盜識兵，逡巡告曰：“聞君刀最快，斬首無二割。求殺我！”兵曰：“諾。其謹依我，無離也。”盜從之刑處，出刀揮之，豁然頭落。數步之外猶圓轉，而大讚曰：“好快刀！”,"At the end of the Ming Dynasty, there were many thieves, and each city set up troops to capture and kill them. There are many thieves in Zhangqiu. There is a soldier with a very powerful sword, who kills Noir Daoyuan. One day more than ten robbers were arrested and taken to the city. One of the robbers knew the soldiers, and he patrolled and said: ""I heard that your sword is the fastest, and you can behead without two cuts. Please kill me!"" The soldier said: ""No. The knife swung, and suddenly his head fell. A few steps away, he still turned in a circle, and praised: ""What a fast knife!""","At the end of the Ming dynasty, Jinan was overrun by thieves. Every town mustered its soldiers, who always executed the thieves when they caught them. In Zhangqiu, the thieves were especially plentiful. There was a soldier there who wore an exceptionally sharp sword, that could slice off a head with a single stroke. One day, more than ten thieves had been arrested and were being escorted to the execution grounds. One of the thieves in the group, who knew the soldier, hung back and said to him, “I’ve heard that your sword is so exceptionally sharp, when you behead someone, you never need two strokes. I beg you to kill me!” The soldier replied, “Alright. Stay near me, and don’t wander off.” Once the thieves arrived together at the place of execution, he drew out his sword, flourished it once and suddenly the thief’s head fell off. Several paces away, it was still rolling and loudly declaring, “Truly a sharp sword!”","At the end of the Ming dynasty, the region around Ji’nan was overrun by bandits. Every township had its garrison of soldiers, and whenever a bandit was apprehended he was swiftly executed. The town of Zhangqiu had an especially large number of such bandits, and one of the government soldiers stationed there was known to possess a very sharp sword. His blade cut clean through anything, as though it were cleaving the air. One day, a group of a dozen bandits were caught and brought to the execution ground. One of them recognized the soldier with the sharp sword. ‘Everyone says you’ve got the sharpest sword,’ he mumbled. ‘They say it can cut a head clean off in a single blow. I beg you, be the one to kill me!’ ‘Very well,’ replied the soldier. ‘Be careful to stay right next to me.’ The bandit followed the soldier closely to the execution ground. The soldier drew his sword and swung it once. The man's head tumbled to the ground and rolled a few feet. And as it rolled, it gasped, ‘That is a sharp sword!’"
異史氏曰：“毛角之儔，乃有王公大人在其中。所以然者，王公大人之内，原未必無毛角者在其中也。故賤者爲善，如求花而種其樹；貴者爲善，如已花而培其本：種者可大，培者可久。不然，且將負鹽車，受羈馽，與之爲馬。不然，且將啖便液，受烹割，與之爲犬。又不然，且將披鱗介，葬鶴鸛，與之爲蛇。”,"Mr. Yi Shi said: ""The couple with hairy horns has their lords among them. Therefore, among the princes and lords, there may not be those without hairy horns. Therefore, the humble are good, just like asking for flowers and planting their trees; The noble ones are good, just like the flowers have been cultivated for their roots: those who plant them can be big, and those who cultivate them can last for a long time. Otherwise, they will bear salt carts, be restrained, and become horses with them. Otherwise, they will eat feces and cook them. If they are cut, they will be dogs. Otherwise, they will be covered with scales, and the cranes and storks will be buried, and they will be snakes.”","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “Among the animals there are former noblemen; at the same time, some noblemen were once animals. When a humble person does a good deed, it’s like planting a tree in order for it to flower later; when a great person does a good deed, it’s like nurturing the roots of the tree that has already been brought to flower: such a person should grow a bigger tree and nurture longer roots. Otherwise, one is merely pulling a salt cart, enduring the bridle as a horse does; or else one is just lapping up urine and feces like a dog until it’s killed and cooked; or if not, one is just throwing on a scaly armor in order to end up buried in the belly of a crane or stork, like a snake.” 27.

Suddenly looking at him from afar, he said, ""The ghosts are here!"" Everyone was eager to find bows and arrows, but the things had already rushed to Weng. Weng servant, go away with his forehead. When they are seen together, the forehead bones are removed like a palm, and they are unconscious. Negative to home, then died. See you later. I don't know why it's weird.","The buckwheat had already been stacked up in the storehouse, leaving behind copious amounts of wheat straw, so old An asked the others to collect the straw and pile it up neatly, then he would personally climb up and stamp it down, until the pile accumulated to a certain height. Suddenly he looked off in the distance and shouted in fright, “The evil ghost is here!” While the people anxiously sought for their bows and arrows, the thing itself rushed at An. As he fell down, it gnawed at his forehead, then left. The others went up together to look at him—and there was a section of bone the size of a hand missing from the unconscious old man’s forehead. Carrying him on their backs, they took him back inside his home, where he died. No one ever saw the ghost again. Indeed, nobody knows what kind of ghost it was. 11.","By now all the threshed buckwheat was safely stored in the granary, but the stalks of straw still lay higgledy-piggledy on the threshing floor. Old An gave orders for the straw to be bound together and piled into a rick, then he himself climbed up on to the rick, which was several feet high. He was treading it down firmly when suddenly he saw something in the distance. ‘The monster is coming again!’ he cried aghast. Before his men could get to their bows, the creature had already jumped at him, and knocked him back on to the rick. It took a bite out of his forehead and went away again. The men climbed up and saw that a whole chunk of the old man's forehead, a piece the size of a man's palm, had been bitten off, bone and all. He had already lost consciousness, and they carried him home, where he died. The monster was never seen again. Nobody could even agree on what sort of creature it was."

The Taoist priest bowed his thanks, and said to the crowd: ""The monks do not understand being stingy. I have good pears, please send them out to make offerings to guests."" And when it's done, put the core in your hand, untie the shovel on your shoulders, take it a few inches deep into the ridge, and cover it with soil. The city people asked for Tangwo irrigation, the good people asked the Linlu shop to get boiling, and the Taoist priest took the dip. With ten thousand eyes, you can see that hooks sprout and grow bigger; Russia becomes a tree, with branches and leaves supporting it; flowers are swiftly and solid, huge and fragrant, and the trees are full of trees. The Taoist priest is the one who picks the top of the tree and gives it to the spectator, and goes to the end in an instant. Already, the tree was cut down with a shovel, and it was cut off after a long time. With Ye He on his shoulder, he walked away calmly.","The bystanders encouraged the villager to give the Daoist one of his pears that’d gone off and then send him away, but the villager refused to go along with the suggestion. In the midst of this a hired laborer, unable to endure the noisy conflict, took some of his money and bought a pear, then handed it over to the Daoist. The priest bowed his thanks and declared to the crowd, “We Daoists don’t understand miserliness. I now have a nice quality pear and will bring it out to share with all of you here.” Somebody asked, “Since you’ve got a nice pear, why don’t you eat it yourself?” He replied, “I needed this fruit’s seeds to grow others.” Thereupon he held the pear in both hands and devoured it. When he finished, he took the seeds in his hand, rearranged his clothing so he could use a spade, dug into the soil to a depth of several inches, inserted the seeds and then covered them with earth. Facing the people in the marketplace, he asked for some warm water to irrigate them and to make them fertile. Some mean-spirited volunteer thereupon approached a nearby shop to get some boiling water—which the priest received and poured over the hole he’d made. The eyes of the gathered crowd looked on, witnessing sprouts poke out and gradually get larger; in an instant, they formed a tree with branches supporting lush foliage; suddenly there were flowers, and just as suddenly, enormous and incredibly fragrant fruit filled the entire tree. The Daoist priest then reached to the top of the tree and plucked them off, bestowing them on the observers so they ran out in no time at all. Next he vigorously chopped away at the tree, contending with it for quite a while, eventually cutting it down; then he put the leafy load over his shoulder, and slowly walked away with it.","Onlookers urged the vendor to give the monk one of his less succulent pears, just to be rid of him, but the man obstinately refused. A waiter who was serving the customers at a nearby wine-stall, seeing that the scene was threatening to grow ugly, bought a pear and gave it to the monk, who bowed in thanks and turned to the assembled crowd. ‘Meanness,’ he declared, ‘is something we monks find impossible to understand. I have some very fine pears of my own, which I should like to give you.’ ‘If you have such fine pears,’ said one of the crowd, ‘then why did you not eat them yourself? Why did you need to go begging?’ ‘I needed this one for the seed,’ was the monk's reply. So saying, he held the pear out in front of him and began munching it until all he had left was a single seed from its core, which he held in one hand while taking down a hoe from his shoulder and making a little hole in the ground. Here he placed the seed and covered it with earth. He now asked for some hot water to sprinkle on it, and one of the more enterprising members of the crowd went off and fetched him some from a　roadside tavern. The water was scalding hot, but the monk proceeded to pour it on the ground over his seed. The crowd watched riveted, as a tiny sprout began pushing its way up through the soil, growing and growing until soon it was a fully fledged tree, complete with branches and leaves. And then it flowered and bore fruit, great big, fragrant pears. Every branch was laden with them. The monk now climbed up into the tree and began picking the pears, handing them down to the crowd as he did so. Soon every single pear on the tree had been given away. When this was done, he started hacking at the tree with his hoe, and had soon felled it. Then, shouldering the tree, branches, leaves and all, he sauntered casually off."
張回棹，悼恨欲死。因登金山謁寺僧，詢黿之異，將以仇黿。僧聞之，駭言：“吾儕日與習近，懼爲禍殃，惟神明奉之；祈勿怒，時斬牲牢，投以半體，則躍吞而去。誰複能相仇哉！”張聞，頓思得計。便招鐵工起鑪山半，治赤鐵重百餘斤。審知所常伏處，使二三健男子，以大鉗擧投之，黿躍出，疾吞而下。少時波湧如山；頃之浪息，則黿死已浮水上矣。行旅寺僧並快之，建張老相公祠，肖像其中以爲水神，禱之輒應。,"Zhang Huizhao, mourned and wanted to die. Because of the monks who went to the Ye Temple on the Jinshan Mountain and asked about the difference, they would take revenge against Yuan. When the monk heard it, he said in horror: ""My wife is close to Xi, and I fear that it will bring disaster, but the gods will honor him; I pray not to be angry, and when I do, I will cut the animal prison and throw it in half, and then I will swallow it up. Who will be able to enmity each other again!"" Zhang Wen thought for a moment. He recruited ironworkers to set up a furnace for half a mountain to treat hematite weighing more than 100 catties. At the place where the judge was always lying down, he made two or three strong men lift and throw them with tongs, and they jumped out and swallowed them quickly. In a young age, the waves surged like a mountain; in an instant, the waves ceased, and the death had already floated on the water. The monks who traveled to the temple also quickly built Zhang Lao Xianggong's ancestral hall, in which the portrait was regarded as the god of water, and the prayers were often answered.","Zhang returned to the site, mourning sorrowfully and wishing he were dead. Subsequently, he climbed Gold Mountain to visit a Buddhist monastery, in order to inquire about the monstrous turtle that had become the object of his hatred. Shocked, a monk who heard his story, replied, “We live near it daily, and fear that it endangers people’s lives, so we serve it as a god, and I pray it hasn’t been angered; at regular times we sacrifice livestock, throwing the body segments into the river—then something surfaces, swallows them, and submerges again. Who could hope to survive the enmity of such power!” When Zhang heard this, a plan suddenly occurred to him. It was easy to enlist some blacksmiths, who had set up a forge on the mountainside, to smelt some red iron weighing a few hundred jin. When they had learned where the thing most frequently hid itself, they directed two or three strong men to use large tongs to lift the hot iron up and throw it into the river. The monster turtle came up, quickly swallowed it, and went back down. Shortly, waves the size of hills began surging. An instant later, the billows ceased and the monstrous turtle, dead, floated to the surface. Travelers and monks quickly united and built a temple to old Master Zhang, placing an effigy of him inside it—where they revere him as a water deity, and when they supplicate him, he answers them. 57.","When Zhang returned, he was grief-stricken at their deaths. He climbed up to the monastery on Gold Mountain and called on the monks there, asking them for information about the turtle's strange ways, so that he could plan his revenge. The monks were appalled at his intentions. ‘We live with the turtle every day, in constant fear of the devastation it is capable of causing. All we can do is worship it and pray to it not to fly into a rage. From time to time we slaughter animals, cut them in half and throw them into the river. The turtle jumps out of the water, gulps them down and disappears. No one would be so crazy as to try to seek revenge!’ As he listened to the monks’ words, Zhang was already forming his plan. He recruited a local blacksmith, who set up a furnace on the hillside above the river and smelted a large lump of iron, over a hundred catties in weight. Zhang then ascertained the turtle's exact hiding place and hired a number of strong men to lift up the red-hot molten iron with a great pair of tongs and hurl it into the river. True to form, the turtle leaped out of the water, gulped down the molten metal and plunged back into the river. Minutes later, mountainous waves came boiling to the water's surface. Then, in an instant, the river became calm and the turtle could be seen floating dead on the water. Travellers and monks alike rejoiced at the turtle's death. They built a temple to old man Zhang, erected a statue of him inside it and worshipped him as a water god. When they prayed to him, their wishes were always fulfilled."

Every time he found a small snake, he’d swallow the whole thing, like he was gobbling down a green onion. With the big ones, he’d take his knife and cut them into small chunks, then grabbing the bits with both hands, he’d eat them. When he chewed, it sounded like crunching metal and his cheeks were smeared with blood. He was also skilled at sniffing them out, so one time he smelled a snake behind a wall and ran over to it hastily: it turned out to be over a chi long. At the time, he wasn’t wearing his knife in his sash, so after he bit its head off, the tail was still wriggling from the corner of his mouth.","Wang Puling, a man of my home town of Zichuan, had a servant by the name of Lü Fengning, who had a passion for eating snakes. If he came upon a very small one, he munched it up whole and swallowed it like a spring onion. Larger ones he cut up into small pieces and ate with his hands, crunching them up loudly and vigorously, and letting the blood dribble all over his chin. He had a very keen sense of smell. Once he sniffed out a snake through a wall and went rushing out to catch it. It was over a foot long. He had no knife with him at the time, so he bit into its head and ate it with the tail dangling and wriggling from his mouth."

The four officials in the hall were all dressed in red, sitting east and west facing each other. They were young at the time, and they didn't understand what officials were. Suddenly, a man led a boy with draped hair and loaded his load up, as if something was white; the voices were roaring, and he didn't hear what he said, but he regarded the hall as laughter. That is, there are people in Tsing Yi who shout out to play drama. The man answered Fangxing's orders and asked, ""What kind of drama are you doing?"" The answer: ""It can reverse the creature."" The official was white. After a short period of time, he was ordered to take peaches.","That day the streets were virtually jammed with wandering people. At the head of the court of justice were four officials, each dressed in red, sitting across from each other, two on the east and two on the west. Back then I was still very young and hence wasn’t aware who the officials were. All I could hear was the buzz of people speaking and the clamor of the musicians in my ears. Suddenly a man appeared, with a long-haired boy following him to convey his possessions on a carrying pole, and stepped up onto the stage, apparently having something to say. There were myriad uproarious sounds in that place, so I couldn’t hear what he was saying. Yet I could see people at the head of the court smiling and laughing. At once, a dark-robed person with a loud voice ordered them to give a performance. As the man prepared to deal with this mandate, he inquired, “What shall I perform?” Those at the head of the court conferred with each other. A clerk came down and announced that they wished to see his best. He answered, “I can transpose living things.” The clerk then related this to the officials. Almost immediately, the clerk came down again and directed him to obtain some peaches.","I went with a friend to watch the fun. There was a huge crowd milling about, and ahead of us, facing each other to the right and left of the raised hall, sat four mandarins in their crimson robes. I was too young at the time to know who they were. All I was aware of was the hum of voices and the crashing noise of the drums and other instruments. In the middle of it all, a man led a boy with long unplaited hair into the space in front of the dais and knelt on the ground. The man had two baskets suspended from a carrying pole on his shoulders and seemed to be saying something, which I could not distinguish for the din of the crowd. I only saw the mandarins smile, and immediately afterwards an attendant came down and in a loud voice ordered the man to give his performance. ‘What shall I perform?’ said the man, rising to his feet. The mandarins on the dais consulted among themselves, and then the attendant inquired of the man what he could do best. ‘I can make the seasons go backwards, and turn the order of nature upside down.’ The attendant reported back to the mandarins, and after a moment returned and ordered the man to produce a peach."
日暮母畏懼之，辭使歸寢，不爲設床褥。女窺知母意，即竟去。過齋欲入，卻退，徘徊戶外，似有所懼。生呼之。女曰：“室有劍氣畏人。向道途中不奉見者，良以此故。”寧悟爲革囊，取懸他室。女乃入，就燭下坐；移時，殊不一語。久之，問：“夜讀否？妾少誦《楞嚴經》，今強半遺忘。浼求一卷，夜暇就兄正之。”寧諾。又坐，默然，二更向盡，不言去。寧促之。愀然曰：“異域孤魂，殊怯荒墓。”寧曰：“齋中别無床寢，且兄妹亦宜遠嫌。”女起，顰蹙欲啼，足儴而懶步，從容出門，涉階而沒。寧竊憐之，欲留宿别榻，又懼母嗔。女朝旦朝母，捧匜沃盥，下堂操作，無不曲承母志。黄昏告退，輒過齋頭，就燭誦經。覺寧將寢，始慘然出。,"At sunset, the mother was afraid of it, so she resigned and returned to bed, instead of setting up a mattress. The female peeps to know the mother's meaning, that is, actually goes. After fasting, he wanted to enter, but he retreated and wandered outdoors, as if he was afraid. Live call it. The woman said: ""The sword has a sword in the room that is afraid of people. Those who do not respect people on the way to the road are good for this."" Ning Wu took the leather bag and hung it in his room. When the woman entered, she sat under the candle; when she moved, she said nothing. After a long time, he asked: ""Do you read it at night? My concubine seldom recites the Shurangama Sutra, but now I have almost forgotten it. I ask for a volume, and my brother will correct it at night."" Ning Nuo. Sitting again, silently, two more to the end, without saying a word. Ning urges it. Suo Ran said: ""A lonely soul in a foreign land is especially afraid of a deserted tomb."" Ning said: ""There is no bed in the fasting, and brothers and sisters should be far away from it."" , but not related to the order. Ning secretly pitied him and wanted to stay in a different bed, but was also afraid of his mother's anger. The female courtesan and the mother, holding the fertile toilet, and going down the hall to operate, all complimenting the mother's aspirations. Retiring at dusk, after passing Zhaitou, he recited sutras with candles. When Jue Ning was about to go to bed, he came out miserably.","At the end of the day, Ning’s mother, still fearful of Xiaoqian, said goodnight and sent her home to sleep rather than setting up a bed for her. Xiaoqian understood what Ning’s mother was feeling, so she finally left. Passing Ning’s study, she wanted to enter, but instead backed away and began pacing back and forth outside his door, as though scared of something. Ning called out to her. She answered, “There’s a sword presence in your room that frightens me. It’s in the way, so that’s why I can’t come in and see you.” Ning realized that the leather bag was the problem, so he grabbed it and hung it up in a different room. Xiaoqian then came in and sat down near his candle. For some time, she was utterly silent. After a long while, she asked him, “Do you read at night or not? When I was little, I used to recite the Surangama sutra, but now I’ve forgotten more than half of it. If you’d let me borrow a copy, at your leisure in the evenings, you could help me to get it right again.” Ning agreed to do so. Once again, they sat in silence until the second watch had passed, not speaking of her leaving. Finally, Ning urged her to go. Turning pale, she exclaimed, “It’s a strange land that a lonely spirit inhabits—a desolate grave is awfully frightening.” Ning remarked, “There’s no other bed in my study for you to sleep on, and besides, even brothers and sisters should keep their distance, to avoid suspicion.” Xiaoqian stood up, her brows furrowing into a sorrowful look, as though she were about to start crying; dragging her feet and moving sluggishly as she slowly walked out the gate, she made her way to the steps and disappeared. Ning privately pitied her and wished he could let her stay the night on another bed, but he feared this would anger his mother. Each dawn, Xiaoqian appeared to Ning’s mother, bringing a basin for her to wash in, then turned to managing other activities in the household, never failing to carry out the mother’s will. At dusk, she’d announce her intention to retire, then walk over to Ning’s study, where by candlelight she’d recite from the sutra. Once she could tell that Ning was ready to go to bed, she would leave, miserable once again.","At nightfall, Ning's mother began to feel afraid and sent Little Beauty off to sleep ‘somewhere else’, pointedly not preparing a bed for her. Little Beauty understood her meaning and went outside, making her way to the threshold of Ning's studio, where she stepped back and seemed to hesitate, as if afraid of something. Ning called out to her from inside, and she replied, ‘There is something frightening in your room. I sense the aura of a sword. You were carrying it on your journey here. That's why I could not accompany you.’ Ning knew it must be the leather bag, and he took it down and hung it in another room. Now Little Beauty was able to enter the studio and sit down with him in the lamplight. For a while she said nothing, then at last she asked him, ‘Do you ever study at night? When I was younger I used to be able to recite the Surangama Sutra, though I’ve forgotten a lot of it by now. If you could find a copy for me, I could recite it in the evenings and you could correct me.’ Ning was pleased with this idea. They sat silently together for some time, until the second watch of the night was almost ended. Still Little Beauty made no mention of leaving, and when Ning finally urged her to go, she spoke to him sadly: ‘A lonely soul in a strange land dreads the desolation of the grave.’ ‘I have no second bed here,’ said Ning. ‘And we should observe decorum, as brother and sister.’ She rose, a slight frown on her face as if she might weep at any moment, and, moving slowly and fearfully, glided out of the door and on to the terrace, where she vanished from sight. In his heart Ning felt sorry for her, and would have let her stay and sleep in a separate bed, but was afraid of incurring his mother's displeasure. Little Beauty waited on his mother morning and evening, bringing water for her to wash with, busying herself with household chores, trying to please her in every way she could. When dusk fell, she always took her leave and made her way to the studio, where she would sit in the lamplight chanting the sutra until she could sense that Ning wanted to go to sleep, when she would leave him, always with the same sad expression on her face. Now, Ning's wife had been ill of a consumption for a long while and his mother had, as a consequence, been weighed down with household work."

予姊丈之祖宋公，諱燾，邑廪生。一日病臥，見吏人持牒，牽白顛馬來，雲：“請赴試。”公言：“文宗未臨，何遽得考？”吏不言，但敦促之。公力病乘馬從去，路甚生疏，至一城郭，如王者都。移時入府廨，宮室壯麗。上坐十餘官，都不知何人，惟關壯繆可識。檐下設幾、墩各二，先有一秀才坐其末，公便與連肩。幾上各有筆劄。俄題紙飛下，視之有八字，雲：“一人二人，有心無心。”二公文成，呈殿上。公文中有雲：“有心爲善，雖善不賞。無心爲惡，雖惡不罰。”諸神傳讚不已。召公上，諭曰：“河南缺一城隍，君稱其職。”公方悟，頓首泣曰：“辱膺寵命，何敢多辭？但老母七旬，奉養無人，請得終其天年，惟聽錄用。”上一帝王像者，即命稽母壽籍。有長須吏捧冊翻閱一過，白：“有陽算九年。”共躊躇間，關帝曰：“不妨令張生攝篆九年，瓜代可也。”乃謂公：“應即赴任，今推仁孝之心，給假九年。及期當複相召。”又勉勵秀才數語。二公稽首並下。秀才握手，送諸郊野，自言長山張某。以詩贈别，都忘其詞，中有“有花有酒春常在，無燭無燈夜自明”之句。,"The ancestor of my sister-in-law, Duke Song, was a taboo and was born in Yilin. One day, when he was sick and lying down, he saw the official holding an ultimatum, leading him to the test, saying, ""Please go to the test."" Gong Yan: ""Wenzong has not come, why should he pass the test?"" The official did not say anything, but urged him. Gongli was ill and rode a horse, and the road was very unfamiliar, and he reached a city like the capital of a king. When moving into the palace, the palace is magnificent. There were more than ten officials sitting on the top, and none of them knew who they were, but Guan Zhuangmiao knew them. There are two piers and two piers under the eaves, and there is a scholar sitting at the end, and the public will be shoulder-to-shoulder. There are pens on each. The Russian inscription paper flew down, looking at it with eight characters, saying: ""One person and two people, intentional or not."" Ergong Wencheng, presented to the hall. There is a saying in the official document: ""If you have a heart to do good, even if you are good, you will not reward it. If you have no intention to do evil, even if you are evil, you will not be punished."" The gods praised them. He summoned the Duke, and said, ""Henan lacks a city god, and the monarch deserves his position."" The Duke realized that he burst into tears and said, ""You have been humiliated and favored, why do you dare to say more? But my mother is seventy years old and has no one to support her, so please let her end her. In the year of the sky, only listening to and accepting."" The person who had the image of the last emperor was ordered to revise his mother's birthday. A long-bearded official held the book and read it, and said, ""Yang is counted as nine years."" After hesitating, Emperor Guan said: ""Maybe Zhang Sheng should take the seal for nine years, and melons can be replaced."" When I take office, I will now push the heart of benevolence and filial piety, and give it a leave of nine years. When the time comes, I will be called again."" He also encouraged the scholars to speak a few words. The two gongs head down together. The scholar shook hands and sent them to the countryside, saying to himself Zhang Shan. The poem is a farewell, and the words are forgotten. There is a sentence like ""there are flowers and wine in spring, and there are no candles and no lights in the night.""","The grandfather of my elder sister’s husband was named Song Tao, a scholarship student in his county. One day, while he was ill and lying in bed, an official leading a white-blazed horse brought him a formal document and told him, “You are requested to attend an examination.” Song replied, “The civil examiner hasn’t arrived yet, so why has an examination been set so hastily?” The officer didn’t answer him, but just urged him to go. Though weakened by his illness, Song rode out after him on his horse. The route was very unfamiliar. Finally they reached a city which looked like a king’s capital. After a while they entered a palatial building. Seated there were over ten officials, all unknown to him except for Guandi, patron god of war. Town God: Each town has a “guardian deity who appoints local deities for each area,” and many of these town deities are “former officials who ruled a city or area well” (Palmer 205). Guandi, patron god of war: Guan Yu (d. 219 C.E.), one of the three peach garden oath brothers from the epic Sanguo yanyi (Romance of the Three Kingdoms), a valiant warlord for the Shu kingdom’s attempts to restore the Han dynasty to power. Variously deified as the God of War (particularly to Daoists), Guandi (an imperial aspect associated with Cai Shen, God of Cash) and as the Qie Lan bodhisattva (Sangharama) to Buddhists. Underneath the eaves of the house, two tables had been set up with a seat at each, and a xiucai had already been seated at the one on the right, so Song sat by him at the other. On each table was a pen and a writing tablet. Suddenly the topic, on a piece of paper, fluttered down from above. Upon looking at it, they found eight words: “One man, two men; intentionally or unintentionally.” When the two men finished their compositions they submitted them to the examiner. Song’s essay included the words, “He who does good deeds intentionally should not be rewarded for it; he who does evil, but without malicious intent, should not be punished.” The deities passed it around, and gasped with praise for it. They called Song forward and told him, “Henan is in need of a Town God, and you would suit the position.” The significance of this dawned just then on Song, and bowing his head, sobbing, he said, “It’s a great honor to me, so I shouldn’t have any excuses, should I? Yet my old mother is in her seventies and since there’s no one else to wait upon her, please let me stay with her until she finishes her natural span of years. Then I will obey your bidding.” One of the deities, resembling an emperor, at once commanded that the mother’s longevity record be examined. An official with a long beard held a volume and leafed through it, then stated, “She has nine years of life left in the mortal world.” When all of the deities hesitated about what should be done, Guandi replied, “Why not just let scholar Zhang take the seal and hold the position for nine years—then, later on, Song can take his place once he’s ready.” Guandi told Song, “You ought to attend to your appointment at once; but for now, due to the benevolence and filial piety in your heart, we’ll grant you a leave of absence for nine years. When that period is through, we’ll summon you again.” He also gave some words of encouragement to Zhang. The two scholars kowtowed and left together. Xiucai Zhang took hold of Song’s hand, accompanied him to the outskirts of the city, and introduced himself as Zhang from Changshan. He offered a poem as a parting gift and though Song subsequently forgot most of the words, part of it went, “ When there’s wine and flowers, Spring is always here; / Even without candle or lantern, the night itself is bright.”","Song Tao was the grandfather of my elder sister's husband. He was a first-degree graduate and holder of an annual government stipend. One day, he was lying ill in bed when he saw a messenger arrive at his door, bearing an official-looking document and leading a horse with white markings on its forehead. ‘You are hereby summoned to the examination for the second degree.’ ‘But the Examiner has not arrived in town yet. They cannot be holding an examination!’ The messenger made no reply, but urged him to be on his way. So Song struggled out of bed, climbed on to the horse and was carried away down an unfamiliar road, which soon led to the outskirts of a city grand enough to be a royal capital. Presently they passed through the imposing buildings of a prefect's yamen and into a large hall, where, sitting up ahead, Song beheld a group of high-ranking mandarins, none of whom he could identify – with the exception of the God of War, Guan Yu. At the near end of the hall, beneath the eaves, stood a pair of low tables and round stools, and at one of these sat another man, evidently a first-degree graduate like himself. Song sat down at the other table, where brush and paper had been laid ready, and presently a strip of paper with the title of a formal essay topic came fluttering down from the blue and alighted in front of him. Song read the wording of the question: ‘One man, two men; with intent, without intent.’ The two ‘candidates’ proceeded to write their essays and, when they were completed, handed them in at the dais. Song's essay read in part: ‘Virtue pursued with intent deserves no reward; evil committed without intent merits no punishment.’ The Pantheon of Examiners passed his script along, and all of them praised it highly. Presently they called Song up to the dais and delivered the following judgement: ‘There is a City God vacancy in Henan Province. You are the preferred candidate for the position.’ The truth suddenly dawned on Song. He kowtowed to the examiners, weeping and saying, ‘How could I ever presume to decline such a great honour! But my aged mother is in her seventies and will have no one left to look after her. I beg to be allowed to nurse her until the end of her allotted span of life, when I will gladly take up the post.’ One of the examiners, who appeared to be the presiding deity, gave orders to check the mother's longevity file, and an attendant with a long beard brought out the registers and began leafing through them. ‘The lady in question has nine years left on the Yang plane,’ he reported. The committee of deities was still debating the issue when the God of War made a proposal. ‘Why do we not appoint the other candidate, Mr Zhang, to the post in an acting capacity for a period of nine years, after which time Candidate Song can take up his plenary appointment.’ This being agreed upon, he informed Song of the committee's decision in the following terms: ‘In the normal course of events, you should proceed straight to this post. In view, however, of your laudable feelings of Benevolence and Filial Piety, we are approving a sabbatical leave of nine years. When that time has expired, you will be summoned again before this board.’ He ended by giving the other candidate a few well-chosen words of advice, whereupon both men bowed and withdrew from the hall. Zhang took Song companionably by the hand and accompanied him to the outskirts of the town, where he explained that he was from the town of Changshan and presented Song with a poem of farewell, the words of which have been lost, save for a couplet: With wine and flowers, the spring is ever present; With neither candle nor lamp, the night is still bright."
明日使弟二郎奔告道士。道士怒曰：“我固憐之，鬼子乃敢爾！”即從生弟來。女子已失所在。既而仰首四望，曰：“幸遁未遠。”問：“南院誰家？”二郎曰：“小生所舍也。”道士曰：“現在君所。”二郎愕然，以爲未有。道士問曰：“曾否有不識者一人來？”答曰：“僕早赴青帝廟，良不知，當歸問之。”去少頃而返，曰：“果有之，晨間一嫗來，欲傭爲僕家操作，室人止之，尚在也。”道士曰：“即是物矣。”遂與俱往。仗木劍立庭心，呼曰：“孽鬼！償我拂子來！”嫗在室，惶遽無色，出門欲遁，道士逐擊之。嫗僕，人皮劃然而脱，化爲厲鬼，臥嗥如豬。道士以木劍梟其首。身變作濃煙，匝地作堆。道士出一葫蘆，拔其塞，置煙中，飀飀然如口吸氣，瞬息煙盡。道士塞口入囊。共視人皮，眉目手足，無不備具。道士卷之，如卷畫軸聲，亦囊之，乃别欲去。,"Tomorrow, the younger brother Erlang will be sent to preach to the Taoist priest. The Taoist priest said angrily, ""I am pity for him, but the devil is daring!"" He came from his younger brother. The woman has been lost. Then he looked up and looked around, and said, ""Fortunately, it's not too far away."" He asked, ""Whose family is in the Nanyuan?"" Erlang said, ""Xiaosheng's house."" The Taoist priest asked, ""Has anyone who doesn't know come here alone?"" He replied, ""My servant went to the Qingdi Temple early, and I don't know, so I should ask him."" If you want to work for the servant’s family, the servants will stop it, and it’s still there.” The Taoist said, “It’s a thing.” Then he went with him. Relying on the wooden sword, he stood in the court's heart and shouted, ""Evil ghost! Compensate my whisk!"" The woman was in the room, panicked and colorless, and wanted to escape when she went out. The widow, the human skin is scratched off and turned into a ghost, lying down and howling like a pig. The Taoist priest is headed by a wooden sword owl. The body turned into thick smoke, and the ground was piled up. The Taoist priest took out a gourd, unplugged it, and put it in the smoke. The Taoist stuffed his mouth into the bag. Looking at the human skin, the eyes and the eyes, all of them are equipped. When the Taoist priests roll it, it is like the sound of scrolling a scroll, and it is also encapsulated, but don't want to go.","The next day, she sent her husband’s younger brother to inform the Daoist. The priest, furious, fumed, “I originally took pity on this demon, then it dares to do this.” He left immediately, following Wang’s brother home. The young woman was already gone, but the priest raised his head to look in all four directions, and said, “We’re lucky—she hasn’t gotten very far!” Then he asked, “Whose home is that in the southern courtyard?” The young brother replied, “That’s my place.” “That’s where she is right now,” said the Daoist. Wang’s brother was dumbfounded, and didn’t think it even possible. The Daoist then asked, “Haven’t you recently had a stranger show up there?” The brother answered, “Early this morning I left for Qingdi Temple, so I don’t know. Let me go and find out.” He went out and shortly returned, reporting, “Someone’s there, alright. This morning an old woman showed up, hoping to be hired as a household servant, and my wife hired her, so she’s still there.” The Daoist said, “That’s the monster.” Consequently, he went there with the younger brother. Brandishing a wooden sword, he stood in the middle of the courtyard, shouting, “Accursed demon! You owe me for my swatter!” The old woman froze in the house, pale with fright, then ran out the gate, hoping to escape. The priest thereupon struck her. The old woman fell, her human skin peeling up and flaking off, changing her back into a horrible demon that lay on the ground, squealing like a pig. With his wooden sword, the Daoist beheaded the abomination; its body turned into a dense smoke, spread over the ground, and then collected into a single pile. When the priest took out a bottle gourd, pulled out the stopper, and placed it in the smoke, there was a sucking sound, like someone drawing in a breath, until in the blink of an eye, the smoke was sucked into the gourd. The Daoist replaced the stopper and put the gourd back in his bag. Together they looked at the human skin with eyebrows, eyes, hands, and feet painted on, all ready to be worn. The Daoist rolled it up, with the sound someone would make rolling up a scroll painting, also put it in his bag, then took his leave of the others and went on his way.","The next morning, they sent Wang's younger brother off at once to find the Taoist. ‘To think that I took pity on her!’ cried the priest angrily. ‘Clearly that fiend will stop at nothing!’ He followed Wang's brother back to the house. By now, of course, there was no trace of the ‘girl’. The Taoist gazed around him. ‘ Fortunately she is still close at hand.’ He went on to ask, ‘Who lives in the house to the south?’ ‘That is my family compound,’ replied Wang's brother. ‘That is where she is now,’ said the priest. Wang's brother was appalled at the idea and could not bring himself to believe it. ‘Has a stranger come to your house today?’ asked the priest. ‘How would I know?’ replied the brother. ‘I went out first thing to the Temple of the Green Emperor to fetch you. I shall have to go home and ask.’ Presently he returned to report that there had indeed been an old lady. ‘ She called first thing this morning, saying she wanted to work for us. My wife kept her on, and she is still there.’ ‘That's the very person we’re looking for!’ cried the Taoist. He strode next door immediately with the brother, and took up a stance in the middle of the courtyard, brandishing his wooden sword. ‘Come out, evil one!’ he cried. ‘Give me back my fly-whisk!’ The old woman came hurtling out of the building, her face deathly pale, and made a frantic attempt to escape, but the Taoist pursued her and struck her down. As she fell to the ground the human pelt slipped from her, to reveal her as the vile fiend she really was, grovelling on the ground and grunting like a pig. The Taoist swung his wooden sword again and chopped off the monster's head, whereupon its body was transformed into a thick cloud of smoke hovering above the ground. The Taoist now took out a bottle-gourd, removed the stopper and placed it in the midst of the smoke. With a whooshing sound the smoke was sucked into the gourd, leaving no trace in the courtyard. He replaced the stopper and slipped the gourd back into his bag. When they examined the pelt, it was complete in every human detail – the eyes, the hands and feet. The Taoist proceeded to roll it up like a scroll (it even made the same sound), placed it in his bag and set off."
異史氏曰：“翁其夙有畸行與？泉路茫茫，去來由爾，奇矣！且白頭者欲其去，則呼令去，抑何其暇也！人當屬纊之時，所最不忍訣者，床頭之昵人耳。苟廣其術，則賣履分香，可以不事矣。”,"The Shi Shi said: ""Weng Qisu has an abnormal behavior? The spring road is vast, and it comes and goes from here, which is amazing! And the white-headed person wants to go, so he calls for him to go, what a time! The most unbearable person is the human ear at the head of the bed. If Gou widens his skills, he will sell his shoes and share the incense, and it will be fine.""","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “Maybe old man Zhu had always behaved strangely. The road to the underworld is vast, so how rare it is for him to leave, and then to come back like that! Though that white-haired head wanted the two of them to leave, even shouting and finally demanding that they leave, what unhurried restraint he showed! When a person is going to die, the hardest thing to endure is saying goodbye to one’s dearest companion. If we can spread old man Zhu’s magic, when it comes time for us to die, we won’t need to make arrangements for our family in advance.”","During the twenty-first year of the reign of Kangxi, I was given a detailed account of this event by the wife of old man Zhu's younger brother. She worked in the household of Judge Bi. 64 THE ALLIGATOR'S REVENGE"

At the beginning of the evening, the lights are on, and they are lying on the couch. Suddenly I saw the little man three inches long and entered from outside. A little circling, that is, go back. After a short while, He Er came and set up a small stool in the hall, like a child made by Liang Jixin. After a while, the two little people entered a coffin, about four inches long, and parked on a bench. Before the house was over, a woman led a number of servants and servants, and the rate was as small as before. The women are in poor clothes, girdling their waists with hemp, and wrapping their heads in cloth. Covering his mouth with his sleeves, he wept with a sound like a giant fly. After staring at him for a long time, the hair is so thick that it is like a box quilt on the body. Because of the loud shout, he ran away, jumped off the bed, and was unable to get up. The people in the hall heard the different voices, and in the assembly hall, the characters disappeared.","In the seventeenth year of Kangxi’s reign, a young man named Wang Junsheng lived and worked in a household as tutor for the family’s children. Late one day, when the lamps had just been lit, Wang was still wearing his shoes as he lay down on his bed. Suddenly he saw a tiny person, maybe ten centimeters tall, enter from the outside, walk around a bit, then at once turn and leave. In less than an instant, the tiny person carried in two small benches, looking like the kind made from plant stalks by children, and put in them in the middle of the room. Again in just an instant, two tiny people entered, carrying a coffin perhaps four inches long, then stopped and set it upon the benches. They hadn’t had time to get everything secured when a woman arrived, following some male and female servants, all as small as the first little fellow. The woman wore mourning clothes, with hemp threads around her waist and a cloth wrapped around her head; she used her sleeve to cover her mouth, wheezing and weeping, making a buzzing sound like a giant fly. Wang watched her for a very long time, so frightened that his hair was standing on end and he felt as though he was frozen in place. He burst out with a loud cry and tried to run away, suddenly tripping over the bed, shaking and shuddering so much that he was unable to get up. Hearing these sounds, his family members huddled together while the tiny people in the hall all disappeared.","In the seventeenth year of the reign of the Emperor Kangxi, a scholar named Wang Junsheng took up residence in Mr Li's house – the very same house – as a family tutor. One evening, just when the lamps were lit, Wang was lying down on his couch with his shoes still on when suddenly he caught sight of a tiny man, some three inches tall, who entered the room, wandered around and then left again. A little while later, he returned carrying two small stools, which he placed in the room. They were tiny, like the miniature toys children make out of millet stalks. After another short interval two more little men came in, bearing a coffin about four inches long, which they placed on top of the two stools. As they were doing this, a lady entered the room with a bevy of maidservants. She was of the same minuscule proportions as the others, and was dressed in mourning, with a hempen cord tied around her waist　and a length of white cotton wrapped round her head. She held her sleeve to her mouth and sobbed most piteously, making a sound a little like that of a giant fly. Tutor Wang lay there quite some time watching all of this through narrowed eyes. As he watched, his hair stood on end and he felt himself enveloped in a layer of cold, like a coverlet of frost. Finally he gave out a great cry and leaped from his bed in an attempt to flee from the room, but as he went he tripped and landed with a crash on the floor, where he lay a gibbering wreck, quite incapable of rising to his feet. The household heard the noise and came running, but saw no sign of anyone or anything out of the ordinary."
〈瞳人語〉,<Tiktok language>,The People in the Pupils Communicate,5 TALKING PUPILS
一日大雪崩騰，寂無行旅。偶過其門，一少年出，豐采甚都。見生，趨與爲禮，略致慰問，即屈降臨。生愛悦之，慨然從入。屋宇都不甚廣，處處悉懸錦幕，壁上多古人書畫。案頭書一冊，簽曰《琅嬛瑣記》。翻閱一過，皆目所未睹。生以居單第，以爲第主，即亦不審官閥。少年細詰行蹤，意憐之，勸設帳授徒。生歎曰：“羈旅之人，誰作曹丘者？”少年曰：“倘不以駑駘見斥，願拜門牆。”生喜，不敢當師，請爲友。便問：“宅何久錮？”答曰：“此爲單府，曩以公子鄉居，是以久曠。僕，皇甫氏，祖居陝。以家宅焚於野火，暫借安頓。”生始知非單。當晚談笑甚歡，即留共榻。,"One day there was a huge avalanche, and there was no travel. Occasionally passed its door, came out in a young man, and it was full of abundance. Seeing the life, tend to be polite, offer a little condolence, and then bow down. Born to love and rejoice, reluctantly to enter. The houses are not very wide, there are curtains hanging everywhere, and there are many ancient paintings and calligraphy on the walls. A desk book, signed ""Lang Huan Suo Ji"". If you read it, you will never see it. Born to be the single first, thinking that the first is the first, that is, not to judge officials and clansmen. The young man carefully examined his whereabouts, took pity on him, and persuaded him to set up an account and grant apprentices. Sheng sighed and said, ""Who is Cao Qiu, who is in custody?"" The young man said, ""If you don't rebuke you with a slap in the face, I would like to worship the gate wall."" Then he asked: ""Why is the house in Jiujing?"" The answer: ""This is the Shanfu, where the son lives in the village, so it is Jiukuang. The servant, Huangfu's family, lived in Shaanxi. The family house was burned in the wildfire, and it was temporarily settled."" Know not single. That night, we chatted and laughed happily, and we stayed together.","One day, a heavy snow fell and no one was out traveling. Coincidentally, Kong was passing the house’s gate as a young man came out, attractive and quite elegant. Noticing Kong, he hurried over and greeted him politely, and after briefly making courteous acquaintance with him, humbly requested the privilege of receiving him as a visitor. Kong immediately liked his pleasant manner and happily followed him inside. The rooms were lovely though not very large, with brocade curtains hanging everywhere, while many of the ancient masters’ calligraphy and paintings were displayed on the walls. On the table lay a volume with the title, Trivial Records from Langxuan. As he glanced through its pages, he found the volume filled with things he’d never read before. Because the young man was living in the Shan residence, Kong believed him to be its owner and hence didn’t inquire into his family background. The young man skillfully examined Kong in depth about his own background, feeling a genuine sympathy for him and advising him to set himself up as a teacher. Kong sighed and said, “A wanderer like me? Who’d even agree to recommend me?” The young man replied, “If you won’t reject a worthless person like myself, I hope you’ll allow me to be your student.” Kong was very pleased by this, but didn’t dare presume to act as the young man’s instructor, requesting instead that they be friends. Then he asked the young man, “Why has your house been closed up for so long?” “This mansion belongs to Master Shan,” he responded, “who used to live here before he moved to the country and hence it has been empty a long time. My family name is Huangfu and our home used to be in Shaanxi. Because our family home was burned down in a wildfire, we’ve arranged to take refuge here temporarily.” It wasn’t until this point that Kong realized the young man was not Master Shan. That same night, they laughed and chatted very merrily till finally Kong was invited to stay and share the young man’s bed.","One day Kong was out in a driving blizzard, the sort of weather in which everyone else decides to stay indoors, and happened to pass by the Shan mansion, where he saw an elegantly attired and handsome-looking young man emerge from the main entrance. The man also caught sight of Kong and, hurrying over to him, greeted him courteously and invited him to step inside out of the snow. Kong took an instant liking to the stranger and gladly followed him inside, looking around him with curiosity as he went. The various rooms of the mansion, though not particularly large, were hung with numerous fine embroidered hangings, antique calligraphic scrolls and paintings. Kong spotted a slim volume lying on a table entitled Jottings from a Distant Realm and, leafing through it, was a trifle puzzled to find that it was a work completely unknown to him. He assumed that the young man must be a member of the Shan family, since he was living in the Shan residence, and did not bother to inquire into his family background and connections. The young man, for his part, asked Kong in some detail about his own predicament and seemed most sympathetic to his plight. He encouraged him to set himself up as a tutor and start a little school. ‘Alas,’ sighed Kong, ‘I am stranded far from home and can think of no one to act as my patron in such an enterprise.’ ‘If you would not consider it beneath you,’ said the young man, ‘I myself would be glad to be your first pupil and sit at your feet.’ Kong was touched by this gesture of friendship but modestly declined to assume the role of the young man's teacher, insisting instead that they should remain simply friends. ‘Tell me,’ he asked, ‘why has this splendid house been closed for so long?’ ‘It used to belong to the Shan family,’ replied the young man, ‘but the young master went to live in the country, and ever since then it has been allowed to go to ruin. My own name is Huangfu. My ancestors hail from Shaanxi Province, far to the west. Our own home was burned down in a big fire, so we are lodging here temporarily at present.’ Kong now knew at least that the young man was not a member of the Shan family. The two continued to spend a most convivial evening together and ended up sharing the same bed that night."

Censor Xingtai press interview. Ding died and went to Anqiu to meet the rain. Avoid the reverse journey. It doesn't stop in rainy days. There are teenagers coming, and Tate Valley is prosperous. Then it was dusk, and he stayed at his home, where he fed the animals with lentils, and gave him a good meal. When asked about his surname, the young man said: ""The surname of the master is Yang, and my nephew is also my nephew. The master is good at making friends, and it is suitable for him to go out, but the wife is the only one at home. The poor can't give generously to guests, but I am fortunate to be able to forgive me."" Asked: ""What is the business of the master? ""Then the family has no assets, but daily expositions are set up to seek promotion. The rain did not stop the next day, and the supply was inexhaustible. In the evening, the cud is filed, and the cud is wet, which is quite uneven. Ding Weizhi. The young man said, ""Tell me the truth, the family is poor and has no means of raising livestock, so it is suitable for the lady to withdraw from the house."" At dawn, the money will not be paid, but the juvenile will be forced to hold it. The Russian still responded to the guest, saying: ""The lady said: I am not a hunter. The owner is away, and I don't bring a money for a few days. The guest came to my house, why did you claim compensation?"" Ding praised and said goodbye. Instructed: ""My Zhucheng Ding, the master returns, it is appropriate to inform him. I am fortunate to see Gu.""","He was wealthy, both in terms of cash and of grain. A champion of justice, he was an admirer of Guo Xie, a truly upright man. A particular corrupt government official began searching for ways to censure him. Ding, consequently, was forced to live as a fugitive. When he arrived in Anqiu, it had begun to rain, so to stay dry he had to give up traveling any further. By noon, the rain still hadn’t let up. A boy came, offering him comfortable lodging and ample food. Since it was already dark, Ding stopped to lodge with the boy’s family; the boy fed some hay and beans to his horse, then considerately served Ding his meal. Ding asked his name, and the boy replied, “The host here is named Yang, and I’m his nephew. The master, who loves to travel, is out now, and of the other family members, only my aunt stayed behind. We’re poor, so we can’t offer a visitor everything he might wish, and we hope you’ll forgive us for that.” Ding asked the boy what his uncle did for a living, and discovered that the family had neither money nor possessions, so during the day they set the place up for gambling, and in that way paid for their food. The following day, it rained as before, without stopping, and the boy was never idle in keeping Ding supplied. When night arrived, he gave the horse more hay; but Ding could tell that the sheaf of hay was soaked; it was also cut to many different lengths. He thought this odd. The boy declared, “To tell you the truth, my family’s so poor that we have no livestock to feed, so my aunt took down some thatch from our home’s roof for your horse.” Ding found this stranger yet, figuring the boy was just hinting to him for some extra pay. At first light, Ding offered him some money, but the boy wouldn’t accept it; then when he offered it more insistently, the boy took it inside. When the boy came back out, he returned it as before, reporting, “My aunt said that we don’t make our living by serving customers. When the master goes out, even for several days, he doesn’t take along any cash; so when someone comes to stay with our family, how can we demand compensation?” Ding expressed his admiration and commendation of the master, then prepared to take his leave. He instructed the boy, “I’m known as Ding, from Zhucheng—please inform Master Yang that I should like to have him visit me. When he has the leisure to do so, it would be my good fortune to welcome him.”","Ding Qianxi of the town of Zhucheng was a wealthy gentleman of a chivalrous disposition, a staunch upholder of honour and a great admirer of the legendary brigand and knight errant Guo Xie. When a local censor began an investigation into Ding's affairs, he simply disappeared to the nearby town of Anqiu and, since it was raining, took shelter at an inn. By midday, when the rain had still not stopped, a young man came and provided him with an excellent meal. That evening Ding decided to stay the night, and his horse was fed with beans and fresh fodder, while he himself was served a hearty supper. He asked the young man his name. ‘The innkeeper is Mr Yang,’ he replied. ‘I am his nephew. My father is Mrs Yang's brother. My master normally makes a point of treating his guests well, but unfortunately he is away at present and my aunt is coping on her own. I’m afraid we are too poor to offer you proper service. I hope you will make allowances.’ Ding asked him how his uncle made ends meet, and the young man informed him that he was a man with neither land nor wealth of his own, who supplemented his meagre earnings from the inn by running a small gambling establishment on the premises. The following day, the rain continued and once again Ding was well looked after. That evening he was puzzled to observe that the hay brought for his horse was in wet bundles of irregular lengths. ‘To tell the truth,’ explained the youth, ‘we are too poor to store any proper hay. My aunt had to take some thatch off the roof.’ ‘My aunt had to take some thatch off the roof.’ Ding was more perplexed than ever. Were these folk expecting to be handsomely paid for the great pains they were taking? The following morning, before leaving, he offered the youth money, but he refused to accept it, only reluctantly agreeing (when Ding insisted) to take it in and offer it to his aunt. He reappeared shortly afterwards and handed it back. ‘My aunt asks me to say that we are not in this business to rob people of their money. My uncle has been away from home and on the road for several days, penniless and relying on the generosity of others. How could we demand money from a traveller arriving at our inn?’ Ding let fall a sigh of admiration for this altruistic spirit of theirs. ‘When your uncle returns,’ he said, as he was leaving, ‘please let him know that Mr Ding of Zhucheng stayed here, and ask him to call on me when he can. I should be honoured.’"
又一月，苦不可忍，而道士並不傳教一本。心不能待，辭曰：“弟子數百里受業仙師，縱不能得長生術，或小有傳習，亦可慰求教之心。今閱兩三月，不過早樵而暮歸。弟子在家，未諳此苦。”道士笑曰：“吾固謂不能作苦，今果然。明早當遣汝行。”王曰：“弟子操作多日，師略授小技，此來爲不負也。”道士問：“何術之求？”王曰：“每見師行處，牆壁所不能隔，但得此法足矣。”道士笑而允之。乃傳一訣，令自咒畢，呼曰：“入之！”王面牆不敢入。又曰：“試入之。”王果從容入，及牆而阻。道士曰：“俯首輒入，勿逡巡！”王果去牆數步奔而入，及牆，虛若無物，回視，果在牆外矣。大喜，入謝。道士曰：“歸宜潔持，否則不驗。”遂助資斧遣歸。抵家，自詡遇仙，堅壁所不能阻，妻不信。王效其作爲，去牆數尺，奔而入；頭觸硬壁，驀然而踣。妻扶視之，額上墳起如巨卵焉。妻揶揄之。王漸忿，罵老道士之無良而已。,"Another month, the suffering was unbearable, and the Taoist priest did not preach a single book. His heart could not wait, and he said: ""This disciple has been taught by an immortal teacher for hundreds of miles. Even if he can't obtain the longevity art, or he has a small teaching experience, he can still comfort his heart to ask for advice. I read it for two or three months now, but it's not long before the woodcutter returns in the evening. The disciple is at home. I don’t know how to suffer.” The Taoist smiled and said, “I firmly believe that I can’t do hardship, but now I am sure. I will send you out tomorrow morning.” The king said, “This disciple has been operating for many days, and the teacher has taught me a little skill. The Taoist priest asked, ""What kind of technique do you want?"" The king said, ""Every time I see the teacher's practice, the wall cannot separate it, but this method is enough."" The Taoist priest smiled and agreed. He then passed on a tactic, ordered himself to finish the curse, and shouted, ""Enter it!"" Wang Mianqiang did not dare to enter. He also said, ""Try to enter it."" Wang Guo entered calmly, and stopped by the wall. The Taoist priest said, ""Bow your head and enter, don't hesitate to patrol!"" Wang Guo went to the wall a few steps and ran in, and when he reached the wall, it was empty and empty. Great joy, thanks. The Taoist priest said: ""Return should be clean, otherwise it will not be tested."" When he arrives home, he claims to have met an immortal, and he cannot be stopped by a strong wall, but his wife does not believe it. Wang followed his deeds, went to the wall a few feet, and rushed in; his head touched the hard wall, and he stumbled abruptly. His wife looked at him, and the grave rose like a giant egg on his forehead. His wife teased him. Wang Jian was angry and scolded the old Taoist for being unscrupulous.","But a month later, the suffering was once again more than he could bear, and the Daoist priest hadn’t passed a single magical technique on to him. Feeling he could wait no longer, he resigned his duties and said, “As a pupil, I journeyed a hundred li to study with you, an immortal teacher, so even if I can’t obtain the skill of being immortal myself, perhaps there’s some small technique you could pass on to me. This would also ease my mind of its desire for instruction. Looking over these last two or three months, it’s no exaggeration that the only thing I’ve done as a pupil in your school is to collect firewood from dawn till dusk, the kind of hardship I never knew at home.” The Daoist smiled, saying, “I originally said you wouldn’t be able to handle the suffering, and now it seems I was right. Tomorrow morning I think I will release you to go.” “I’ve toiled as your pupil for many days,” Wang replied. “Master, if you teach me a bit about one little trick, it won’t all have been a waste.” The Daoist asked, “What skill do you seek?” “I’ve seen that when you walk, walls cannot stop you,” Wang said. “Merely to obtain the method for this would be enough.” The Daoist smiled his permission. He provided a rhyming chant for Wang to use, commanded him to repeat the incantation, and then shouted: “Enter the wall!” Wang faced the wall, but didn’t dare attempt to enter it. Again the priest exclaimed, “Try it now.” Wang, though determined and unhurried, came up to the wall and then stopped. The Daoist said, “Put your head down and plow into it, don’t shrink from it!” Wang resolutely moved back from the wall several steps, then ran right at it; when he reached the wall, it was as if nothing were there. He turned back to inspect it, and consequently found himself on the other side of the wall. Greatly pleased, he went back through the wall to the other side and thanked his teacher. “When you return home,” the Daoist said, “maintain an appropriate purity of action, or the incantation won’t prove effective.” Thereupon he provided Wang with some money to pay for his return journey and sent him on his way. Arriving home, Wang bragged that he’d met an immortal, and solid walls were no longer able to stop him. His wife didn’t believe him. Wang made ready to perform, backing away from the wall several steps, then sprinted, his head striking the wall—bouncing off, however, and causing him to fall. His wife pulled him up and looked him over, found a bump swelling on his forehead, and informed him of the large, egg-sized lump there. She ridiculed him. Wang was ashamed and angry, and cursed the old Daoist priest for being so mean to him.","Another month went by, and again the hardship seemed more than he could bear. And still the Master had taught him no magical secret. He could wait no longer, and went to take his leave. ‘I came here from a great distance to sit at your feet, Master. Even if I could not learn the Art of Immortality, I thought at least to acquire some minor accomplishment with which to nourish my spiritual aspirations. But alas, for these three months, I have done nothing but chop wood all day and return exhausted in the evening to sleep. Hardship such as this I have never known at home.’ The priest smiled. ‘Did I not say it would be hard? See, you have proved me right. Tomorrow morning I will send you on your way.’ ‘Please, Master,’ pleaded Wang, ‘for all the days I have laboured, give me some trifling skill to take away with me, so that I will not go home empty-handed.’ ‘What skill do you desire?’ asked the priest. ‘I have noticed that wherever you go, walls are no obstruction to you. Teach me to walk through walls, Master. That will be enough.’ The priest smiled. ‘Very well.’ He taught Wang a mantra, bade him recite it, then cried, ‘Now go!’ Wang looked at the wall in front of him, but could not bring himself to walk into it. ‘Try! Go!’ Wang started slowly, but when he reached the wall, there it was, as solid as ever in front of him. ‘What are you waiting for? Head down and charge!’ cried the priest. ‘Don’t procrastinate!’ This time, Wang took a few steps back from the wall, rushed at it full pelt and passed through it as if there were nothing there. Looking round him, he saw that he was indeed now on the other side of the wall. It had worked! He was delighted and returned at once to give thanks. ‘When you are back at home,’ said the monk, ‘be sure to lead a pure life. If not, it will not work.’ The monk gave him something towards his travelling expenses and sent him on his way. On his return, Wang boasted of his encounter with an Immortal, and claimed that he could walk through solid walls. His wife did not believe his tales, so he carried out the monk's instructions, took up a stance several feet away from a wall and rushed at it. This time his head made contact with some all too solid masonry and he crashed to the ground with a thud. His wife helped him up, looked at the egg-sized bump that was starting to emerge on his forehead and burst out laughing. Wang was bitterly angry, and cursed the old monk for a scoundrel."

The Alligator Alligators used to live in the west bank of the Yangzi River’s lower reaches. Their appearance was like a dragon’s, though shorter, and they were able to move about quite speedily; they often went out to submerge themselves along the shore of the river, waiting to spring up and feed on the geese and ducks. Sometimes they were hunted, their flesh sought as a commodity by the Chen and Ke clans. Both of these families were descendants of Chen Youliang, and had a tradition of eating alligator meat, though other clans didn’t have the courage to eat this kind of thing. A visitor from Jiangyou came, caught one, and bound it up in his boat. One day, he anchored his craft in the Qiantang River, but had tied the alligator up rather carelessly—suddenly it leapt into the river. In an instant, enormous waves were stirred up, causing the boat to capsize and sink. 65.","The alligator has its origins in the region to the west of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. It is dragonlike in appearance, but shorter than a true dragon, and only able to fly sideways. From time to time, it emerges from the river and scours the banks for food – usually geese and ducks. Sometimes alligators are caught and these are sold to members of the Chen and Ke families (descendants of the Red Turban leader Chen Youliang), who have traditionally been eaters of alligator meat. People from other families never venture to eat it. A traveller coming from west of the river captured one and kept it tied up with a rope in his boat. One day, he had moored in the Qiantang River when the rope worked its way loose and the creature suddenly leaped into the water. The next instant, great waves rose up and overturned the boat, which capsized and sank into the river."

Children are ignorant and suffer from it. There are also people who turn people into animals, and they are called ""creating animals"". This technique is rare in the north of the river, and it is often found in the south of the river. In the hotel in Yangzhou, a man led five donkeys, stopped for a while, and said, ""I'll be back soon."" He also instructed: ""Don't let me drink."" Then he went. In the stormy day of the donkey, the hoofs are particularly noisy. The owner leads the cool place. When the donkey saw the water running towards it, he drank it. A roll of dust turned into a woman. Strangely, when questioned about the reason, the tongue is too strong to answer. It is hidden in the rooms. Then the donkey owner arrived, tied the five sheep in the courtyard, and asked where the donkey was. The host dragged the guest to sit down, then went to eat and drink, and said: ""Guest aunt's meal, the donkey will arrive."" Yin Bao County, demobilized to capture, then kill him with weapons.","There are plenty of ways to bedevil people magically, like tossing out some kind of tempting bait for people to follow when they’re sleepwalking, which is popularly known as “attacking with a fistful of fluff,” and is called “bluffing with fluff” south of the Yangzi River. Children don’t know about such things, so they’re constantly vulnerable to such harm. There’s also another enchantment one can cast that changes people into beasts, called “creating livestock.” The spell is little practiced north of the Yangzi, though it’s quite common in the south. At an inn in Yangzhou, a man leading a five-headed donkey came in and tied it up at the inn’s stable, declaring to the innkeeper, “I’ll be right back.” He quickly added, “Don’t let it eat or drink.” Then he went away. The donkey was out in the sun and became agitated, raising a ruckus with its kicking and biting. The innkeeper led it away from the stable to cool off. When the donkey spotted some water, it rushed towards it and indulged itself in guzzling. A moment later, it changed into a woman. The innkeeper was astonished and asked her what had happened, but she was tongue-tied and couldn’t speak. Then he hid her inside the inn. Not long afterwards, when the donkey’s master returned with five sheep and entered the courtyard, he nervously asked where his donkey had gone. The innkeeper dragged him over to a seat and offered him food, earnestly saying, “For now, sir, enjoy your meal—your donkey will show up quite soon.” The innkeeper then stepped out, fed the five sheep with water, and in seconds they turned into five children. The innkeeper secretly sent a message to prefectural headquarters, from whence servants were dispatched to arrest the man, who was subsequently shackled and executed. 61.","Many and various are the ways of bewitching folk.

This is commonly known as ‘hitting the wad’; south of the Yangtze it is known as ‘dragging the wad’. It is young children who are most frequently bewitched and harmed in this way. Then there is the art of turning men into animals, known for short as ‘making animals’. This is less frequently encountered in the north, but is more common south of the Yellow River. One day, a man came to an inn in Yangzhou, leading with him five donkeys. He tied them up near the stable, telling the landlord he would be gone a few minutes and giving him strict instructions to give them neither food nor water during his absence. He had not been gone long before the donkeys, which had been left to stand out in the glare of the sun, began to kick and bray and make a terrible racket. The landlord untied them and was about to tether them in the shade when suddenly they spotted water and made a rush to get at it. The landlord let them drink, and no sooner had the water touched their lips than they began rolling on the ground and were transformed into five women. The astonished landlord asked them what was going on, but they seemed incapable of speech, so he took them and hid them in one of his private apartments. Presently their owner returned to the courtyard of the inn, bringing with him five sheep. He asked the landlord at once what had become of his donkeys, and the landlord replied by showing him politely to a seat and offering him food and wine. ‘Enjoy your meal, sir. Your donkeys will be brought to you in a moment.’ The landlord meanwhile went out into the yard and gave the sheep some water, on drinking which they were transformed into five young boys. He secretly reported the matter to the local yamen, and constables were sent to arrest the sorcerer, who died under torture."
〈野狗〉,<wild dog>,25. The Feral Dog,"One among them, his head still dangling from his shoulders, gasped, ‘The wild dog is coming!"
於是移坐窗下，目注隙中。久之，聞窗外如牛喘，有物推窗欞，房壁震搖，其勢欲傾。公懼覆壓，計不如出而鬥，遂劃然脱肩，奔而出。見一巨鬼，高與檐齊；昏月中見其面黑如煤，眼閃爍有黄光；上無衣，下無履，手弓而腰矢。公方駭，鬼則彎矣。公以劍撥矢，矢堕。欲擊之，則又彎矣。公急躍避，矢貫於壁，戰戰有聲。鬼怒甚，拔佩刀，揮如風，望公力劈。公猱進，刀中庭石，石立斷。公出其股間，削鬼中踝，鏗然有聲。鬼益怒，吼如雷，轉身複剁。公又伏身入，刀落，斷公裙。公已及脅下，猛斫之，亦鏗然有聲，鬼僕而僵。公亂擊之，聲硬如柝。燭之則一木偶，高大如人。弓矢尚纏腰際，刻畫猙獰；劍擊處，皆有血出。公因秉燭待旦。方語鬼物皆蔔人遣之，欲致人於死，以神其術也,"So he moved to sit under the window and stared in the gap. After a long time, I smelled like a cow panting outside the window, something pushed the window lattice, the walls of the room shook, and its momentum was about to collapse. The public was afraid of being overwhelmed, and he didn't think it would be better to fight. I saw a giant ghost whose height was as high as the eaves; in the dusky moon, its face was black as coal, and its eyes flickered with yellow light; there was no clothes on the top, no shoes on the bottom, and the hands were bowed and the waist was pointed. The public is frightened, and the ghost is bent. The public plucked the arrow with the sword, and the arrow fell. If you want to hit it, you will bend again. The public hurried to avoid, the arrow pierced the wall, and the battle was loud. The ghost was so angry that he drew his saber, waved it like the wind, and looked at the public to split it. Gong You came in, knifed the stone in the atrium, and the stone made a decisive decision. The public came out of his crotch, cut the ghost's middle ankle, and made a loud sound. Gui Yi was furious, roared like thunder, turned around and chopped again. The duke stooped in again, the knife fell, and the duke's skirt was cut off. The duke was already under the threat, and he slammed him down, and there was a loud noise, and the ghosts froze. The public chaos hit it, the sound was as hard as a watch. Zhuzhi is a puppet, as tall as a human being. The bow and arrow are still wrapped around the waist, depicting hideousness; there is blood coming out of the sword strike. Gong Yin waits for the day. In the dialect, ghosts and objects are all sent by people, and if they want to cause people to die, they use their magic skills.","Master Yu moved to sit next to the window, his eyes concentrating on the crack there. Quite a bit of time elapsed, then outside the window he heard something like an ox breathing heavily and something began pushing against the window lattice, making the entire wall of the room shake so powerfully that it threatened to collapse. Master Yu feared he might be crushed, and calculated that he’d have a better chance by fighting outside, so he slammed open the bolt on his door and rushed out. There he saw a giant of a demon, as tall as the eaves of the house; in the dim moonlight he could tell that its face was black as coal, its eyes flashing with a bright yellow light; it wore neither clothing nor shoes, but held a bow, while carrying arrows at its waist. As Master Yu stood there astonished, the demon drew its bow and shot at him. Master Yu deflected the arrow with his sword and it fell to the ground; just as he was about to strike back, it shot another arrow. Master Yu deftly dove out of its way, the arrow hitting a wall with a reverberating sound. The demon, infuriated, pulled out a knife it wore at its waist, whirled it like the wind, and with its force aimed a blow that was meant to gut Master Yu. Yu jumped out of the way like a monkey and the blade came down on a stone in the yard, splitting it. Master Yu then scrambled between the demon’s legs and slashed at its ankle, which made a metallic clanging noise. The demon became even angrier, roaring like thunder and twisting its body around to attack again. Master Yu crouched and again ducked through its legs; the knife came down and sheared off some of his gown. Master Yu came up under its armpit, delivering a violent thrust that also made a clanging sound, and the demon fell to the ground, motionless. Master Yu struck wildly at it, the sound echoing like a watchman’s woodblock. By the light of a lamp, he found it to be a wooden idol, the size of a man. The bow and arrows were still tied at its waist and its features had been carved and painted to appear hideous; blood seeped out from those places where his sword had struck. Consequently, Master Yu kept the light in hand and waited for daybreak, now aware that the monsters had all been sent by the fortuneteller who wanted Yu dead to prove his magic was real.","He now moved his seat to beneath the window and kept his gaze fixed on the crack in the casement. After a while, he heard what sounded like an ox snorting outside, then the sound of something heaving against the window frame. The next thing he knew the whole wall of the room was shaking and seemed about to collapse. Afraid of being buried alive, Yu resolved to go out and fight. He threw open the door with a great swish and rushed out into the night. By the dim light of the moon he made out the figure of a huge ghoul, high as the eaves of the house, its face pitch-black and its eyes glowing with a sinister yellow light. It was naked to the midriff and barefoot, held a bow in its hand and had a clutch of arrows attached to its waist. Yu was still reeling from the shock of seeing this apparition when the ghoul let fly a shower of arrows. Yu fended them off with his sword and they fell to the ground, but when he tried to strike the creature directly, it counter-attacked by letting loose another arrow. Yu jumped to one side, and the arrow drove itself quivering into the wall – much to the fury of the ghoul, which now produced a sword and whirled it around, aiming at Yu's head. Yu ducked with monkey-like agility and the blade struck a stone, splitting it clean in two. Yu now darted between the ghoul's legs and slashed his own sword against its shins with a mighty whack. This enraged the ghoul more than ever, and it emitted a mighty thundering roar and began spinning round and chopping wildly at Yu, who ducked once more between its legs, so that when the monster's blade struck, it did no more than slice off a part of his robe. Yu now moved close up against the monster's ribs and dealt them a hefty thwack. The creature slumped to the ground and lay there. Yu continued to strike blow after blow at it, each one ringing into the night like a watchman's wooden clapper. Eventually he held high his lamp and beheld before him a man-sized wooden puppet, decorated in the most terrifying fashion, the arrows still tied at its waist. Blood was flowing from every place where his sword had struck. Yu sat there until dawn, lamp in hand, knowing that each one of the three monsters had been sent against him by the fortune-teller, who was determined to prove his clairvoyant powers, even if it meant killing him in order to do so."
萬村石氏之婦崇於狐，患之而不能遣。扉後有瓶，每聞婦翁來，狐輒遁匿其中。婦窺之熟，暗計而不言。一日竄入，婦急以絮塞瓶口，置釜中，燂湯而沸之。瓶熱，狐呼曰：“熱甚！勿惡作劇。”婦不語，號益急，久之無聲。拔塞而驗之，毛一堆，血數點而已。,"The wife of the Shi clan in Wancun respected the fox, and could not send her because of it. There is a bottle behind the door, and every time I hear a woman coming, a fox hides in it. Peeping the familiarity of the woman, she secretly plans without saying anything. One day, when they entered, the woman hurriedly plugged the mouth of the bottle, placed it in a kettle, and simmered the soup. The bottle was hot, and the fox shouted, ""It's very hot! Don't play tricks."" After unplugging it, there was a pile of hair and only a few points of blood.","In Wan village, a man named Shi’s wife was haunted by a fox, which caused her considerable suffering, because she hadn’t been able to drive it away. They kept a jug behind a door, and whenever the fox heard the husband arrive, it would escape by hiding itself inside it. The wife maintained surveillance of the fox doing this, and secretly hatched a scheme without saying a word about it. One day, it fled once again and entered the jug. The wife then quickly stuffed a stopper in its mouth, popped it into a cauldron, and heated the water in it until it was boiling. The jug’s temperature soared and the fox cried out, “It’s too hot! Don’t be so mean.” The wife, meanwhile, said nothing. Its howls became increasingly urgent, but after a long while there was finally no more sound. She pulled out the stopper and looked inside, finding a pile of fur and several spots of blood.","A woman of the Shi family in Wan Village was possessed by a fox-spirit. She suffered greatly, but was unable to get rid of it. Behind the house was a bottle, and whenever the fox heard the woman's husband coming home, it would disappear and hide in this bottle. The woman made a note of this and formed a secret plan, which she mentioned to no one. One day when the fox was hiding in the bottle, she plugged the mouth of the bottle with cotton wadding, then placed it in a big pot, poured in some water and brought it to the boil, fox and all. ‘It's dreadfully hot in here!’ cried the fox, as the temperature mounted. ‘Stop this nonsense at once!’ The woman said nothing. The screams from within the bottle grew louder and louder, and then suddenly there was silence. She removed the stopper and looked inside the bottle. All she could see was a mess of fur and a few drops of blood."
昔王心逸嚐言：“在都偶過市廛，聞弦歌聲，觀者如堵。近窺之，則見一少年曼聲度曲。並無樂器，惟以一指捺頰際，且捺且謳，聽之鏗鏗，與弦索無異。”亦口技之苗裔也。,"In the past, King Xinyi tasted and said: ""I once passed through the market in Dudu, and when I heard the singing of the strings, the audience was like a block. When I looked closely, I saw a young man's voice and music. There was no musical instrument. Acura, when you listen to it, it is no different from a string."" It is also the Miao descendant of ventriloquism.","Wang Xinyi once reported that when he was in the capital, passing through the market district, he heard the sound of a stringed instrument accompanying a singer, and people watching, blocking the way like a wall. As he got close enough to catch a peek, he saw a young man with a lovely voice singing a song. But there was no instrument accompanying him—only his finger pressed against his cheek while he sang, sometimes pressing it in, sometimes pulling it out; it sounded no different than the vibrations of a bow string. He was also a descendant of practitioners of ventriloquism.","Years ago, Wáng Xinyi told me that once, when he was in the capital and walking through the market, he heard the sound of a stringed instrument and a voice singing. The performance had attracted a large crowd. He went closer and observed a young man singing a song in long, drawn-out phrases. There was no musical instrument to be seen. He was simply rubbing his cheek with his finger as he sang, producing a sound just like that of a stringed instrument. This was another variation of vocal virtuosity."

Due to the great lawsuit, the family was few, and he moved to the village. The house was empty.","Jiaona Kong Xueli, a descendant of Confucius, was a refined and cultivated man, accomplished in poetry. A close friend of his who was a magistrate in Tiantai sent him an invitation to visit—but while Kong was traveling to stay with him, the magistrate happened to die. This left Kong without the financial means to return, so he went to live at the Putuo Monastery, where he was employed as a scribe for the monks. To the west of the monastery, just over a hundred paces away, there was a residence belonging to a Master Shan. Although originally the son of a rich family, Master Shan had found himself in financial straits because of an extensive litigation, so he took the few members of his remaining household and moved to the country, leaving the house near Putuo untenanted.","Kong Xueli, a descendant of the great sage Confucius, was a man of generous spirit and great refinement of character, and an accomplished poet.

When he looked around himself, seeing his body lying in the lush grass, it became clear he really was living as a snake. Thereupon he made the determined vow not to harm any living thing and to eat only vegetarian foods. As the years went by, he was always brooding over the fact that he couldn’t commit suicide, nor could he harm other people so they’d kill him; he longed for an acceptable strategy for dying, but was unable to come up with one.

After Zhu's death, there was a slight vigour in his heart. Negative entry, Su Su at the end of the night. Drink the soup and ask them, and the guests and utensils are matched with the shape. The morning clock has run out, the dawn is misty, and the Taoist is horrified when he sees a stiff girl on the tree. Report to the slaughter of the city, and the slaughter's relatives go to the quality inspection. Judging the truth, the left and right four fingers are rolled together like hooks, and there is no armor when they enter the wood. And a few people can pull it down. Depending on the finger points, it is like digging holes. When they were dispatched to visit Weng's house, they were killed with dead bodies, and they were shouting. As a result of the service report, Weng was always there and returned with his corpse. The guest cried and told the slaughter: ""Four people have left, and now one person will return. Why do you believe in the village?""","The monks listened for a good long time, and upon hearing no further sound, ventured out to see the man lying on the ground. They saw he was near death, like a candle burning out, but his heart was still beating slightly. They carried him in and it wasn’t until the night had passed that he revived. They got him to drink some broth and asked him about himself, giving the visitor time to compose his answers. By that time the morning bell had finished ringing, and as the dawn’s colors spread everywhere, the monks were able to sneak a peek at the tree outside—and as a result saw the stiffened corpse of the woman. Greatly astonished, they reported it to the county magistrate. The magistrate personally paid a visit to determine the facts. He sent his men to pry off the woman’s arms, but they were so rigid they couldn’t be moved. Examining the corpse carefully, he noticed that four fingers of each hand were curled like hooks and sunk up to the nails into the tree. They tried again with all their strength to pull them loose. Upon succeeding, they found finger holes that looked like they’d been dug in. The magistrate dispatched some servants to the old man’s household which was in an uproar since the corpse had disappeared and guests had been killed. The servants reported what had happened. The old man then followed them to retrieve his daughter-in-law’s corpse. The guest wept as he wondered aloud to the magistrate, “We four men went out together, and now only I return—what will the people in our home village believe about this?” The magistrate gave the man an official document and bestowed on him sufficient means to pay for his return home. 4.","The monks had been following all of this from the safety of the temple precincts, and when the sound of the struggle died away, they came creeping out to find the man lying on the ground. They shone a lamp on him, and though at first he seemed dead, when they felt his heart they detected the faintest trace of a pulse. They carried him inside, and late that night when he finally regained consciousness they gave him some broth to drink and he told them the whole story. When the matin bell rang, they went out into the misty light to examine the tree, and found the girl's corpse still tightly clamped to it. In great consternation, they reported this strange event to the County Magistrate, who came in person to investigate and conduct an inquest. He ordered his men to pull the girl's hands away from the tree, but this proved almost impossible and on closer inspection they could see that her fingers, which were curled like hooks, had penetrated into the trunk of the tree, burying her nails deep in the wood. It took the concerted efforts of several men to prise her away. The finger holes were long and narrow as if they had been bored by a carpenter's awl. A messenger was sent to inform the old landlord, whose inn was in a great state of commotion, both at the disappearance of the corpse and at the discovery of the three travellers dead in their beds. The old man followed the messenger back, and gave instructions for the dead body of his daughter-in-law to be transported back to the inn on a stretcher. The surviving traveller tearfully confided to the Magistrate the difficulty of his situation. ‘The four of us left home together. When I return to my village on my own, no one is going to believe my story!’ The Magistrate provided him with a written certificate of the facts, and an allowance for his journey home."

Hearing the house in the north, it looks like a family. When I got up, I peeked under the stone window on the north wall, and saw a small courtyard outside the short wall. There were more than forty women; The woman said, ""Why hasn't Xiaoqian been here for a long time?"" The old woman said, ""It's almost good."" The woman said, ""Do you have any complaints about Grandma General Wuxiang?"" She said, ""I don't hear it; : ""It is not advisable to get acquainted with your maid."" Before the words were finished, seventeen or eighteen women came, as if she was absolutely gorgeous. The old woman smiled and said, ""I don't say anything behind my back. The two of us are talking, and the little demon maid came quietly without a trace. Fortunately, there is no shortcoming."" The man was also taken away."" The woman said, ""My grandmother is not good at each other, and who is the better one?"" The woman and the woman didn't know what to say. I would rather my neighbors care about their mouths, and I can't listen to them again in bed;","Since Ning was in an unfamiliar place, for a long time he couldn’t fall asleep. He began to hear the sound of low voices north of where he was staying, like there was a family there. He got up and hid himself just below a stone-lined window on the north side of his room, spying out from his place of concealment. He saw a courtyard outside a short wall, where there was a woman in her forties; with her was an old woman, hunchbacked and frail, wearing a gown that had once been dark red, but was now quite worn and faded, the two conversing together by the light of the moon. The woman asked, “What’s taking Xiaoqian so long to arrive?” The old woman answered, “She must be almost here.” “She hasn’t been complaining to you, has she, granny?” the first woman asked. “Not that I’ve heard,” the other replied, “though she looked like she was upset.” The younger woman remarked, “That girl doesn’t appreciate what she has now.” The words were hardly out of her mouth before a seventeen- or eighteen-yearold girl showed up, a peerless beauty. The old woman laughed and noted, “One shouldn’t talk about a person behind her back—we two were doing just that when you, you little goblin, quietly sneaked up on us without making a sound. Fortunately, we weren’t saying anything mean about you.” She added, “Young lady, you’re so lovely, you’re like a beauty from a painting, and if I were a young man, you’d have attracted and stolen my very soul.” The girl replied, “Granny, if you don’t praise me, who else is going to?” The woman and the girl then exchanged words that Ning couldn’t make out. Thinking that they must be members of his neighbor’s family, he decided to go to sleep without turning back to listen further.","It was Ning's first night in the temple, and he found it hard to fall asleep. He thought he could hear low voices outside, as if the members of a family were talking among themselves. Rising from his bed, he crouched against the northern wall of his cell, beneath the stone window-frame, and, peeping out, saw a small courtyard surrounded by a low wall, in which two women – one in her forties, the other an old lady in a faded red dress, with a long silver comb in her hair, humpbacked and unsteady on her feet – were talking in the moonlight. ‘What has kept Little Beauty so long?’ asked the younger of the two. ‘She should be here any minute,’ said the older. ‘Has she been complaining to you, Granny?’ ‘No. But she does seem rather miserable.’ ‘Perhaps we are being too soft with her.’ Even as they were talking, a young girl of seventeen or eighteen, of an extraordinary personal beauty, entered the courtyard and the old lady laughed. ‘One should never speak of people behind their backs! There we were talking about you, dear, when you come stealing in, silent as a little fairy. It's a good thing we weren’t discussing your shortcomings.’ After a brief pause she continued, ‘Why, you’re looking pretty as a picture today! If I were a young man, I’d be head over heels in love with you!’ ‘And if I didn’t have you to flatter me, Granny,’ said the girl, ‘I’m sure I’d starve for compliments…’ She and the middle-aged woman then exchanged a few words. Ning concluded to himself that they must be a family living next door, and went back to bed."
公既騎，乃别而去，及抵里，豁若夢寤。時卒已三日，母聞棺中呻吟，扶出，半日始能語。問之長山，果有張生於是日死矣。後九年，母果卒，營葬既畢，浣濯入室而沒。其嶽家居城中西門里，忽見公鏤膺朱幩，輿馬甚眾。登其堂，一拜而行。相共驚疑，不知其爲神，奔詢鄉中，則已殁矣。公有自記小傳，惜亂後無存，此其略耳。,"Since the duke was riding, he walked away, and when he arrived, it was like a dream. Three days after the death, the mother heard the groaning in the coffin, helped it out, and was able to speak in half a day. If you ask Changshan, if there is Zhang Sheng, he will die today. In the latter nine years, the mother fruit died, and the burial was completed, and Huan Zhuo entered the room and disappeared. Qiyue lived in the west gate of the city, and suddenly saw the public figure with a red crotch, and there were a lot of horses. Climb into the hall, and walk away. They were both startled and suspicious, not knowing that he was a god, so they rushed to the village and died. The public has a self-reported biography, but after the chaos there is no existence, this is a little ear.","Song then rode away, leaving his fellow behind. When he returned to his own neighborhood it was as if he’d just awakened from a dream. In reality, he’d been dead for three days. His mother heard a groan from inside his coffin, helped him out, and after half a day had elapsed he was finally able to speak. He inquired about Changshan and found that there really was a Zhang there—who’d died the very day he had. After nine years, his mother did, indeed, die. Once her funeral service had been concluded, he washed himself, went into his room, and quietly died. The family of his father-in-law, who lived in the city by the western gate, suddenly saw Song—among a multitude of carriages and horses with engraved belts and red trappings—enter their main hall, make an obeisance, and then leave. In their mutual surprise and bewilderment, they didn’t realize that he had become a god. They hurried to his neighborhood for news about him and discovered that he had died. Song had recorded a brief autobiography, but, regrettably, in the chaos that followed his death, it did not survive, and this is merely a summary of it. In the chaos that followed his death: An allusion to the privations associated with the violent treachery of the Manchu overthrow of the Ming dynasty in 1644.","Song mounted his horse and went on his way. When he reached his village he awoke as if from a dream, to discover that he had been lying dead three whole days. His mother heard a groan emanating from within the coffin and immediately gave orders for her son's body to be lifted out of it. Half a day later, he had recovered sufficiently to be able to speak, and when he made inquiries in nearby Changshan, he learned that a Mr Zhang of the town had indeed breathed his last on the very same day as himself. Nine years later, Song's mother passed away, as had been foretold. When her funeral rites were concluded, her son performed his ablutions, retired to his chamber, lay down and died. His wife's parents lived within the West Gate of the town, and at the moment of his death they saw him approaching their house, escorted by a large retinue and riding a richly caparisoned horse. He came walking into their main hall, made them a formal bow of farewell and went on his way. Not realizing that he was a departed spirit, they rushed out in great perplexity to inquire what it could mean, only to be informed that their son-in-law had just died. Song wrote a short account of his experience, but alas, after the Troubles it was lost."
萊陽宋玉叔先生爲部曹時，所僦第甚荒落。一夜二婢奉太夫人宿廳上，聞院内撲撲有聲，如縫工之噴水者。太夫人促婢起，穴窗窺視，見一老嫗，短身駝背，白發如帚，冠一髻長二尺許；周院環走，竦急作鵷行，且噴水出不窮。婢愕返白，太夫人亦驚起，兩婢扶窗下聚觀之。嫗忽逼窗，直噴欞内，窗紙破裂，三人俱僕，而家人不之知也。,"When Mr. Song Yushu of Laiyang was under Cao Cao, his place was very desolate. One night two maids were in the living room of Mrs. Feng, and heard the sound of thumping in the courtyard, like a seamstress spraying water. Mrs. Tai urged her maid to get up, peeped through the window, and saw an old woman with a short body and a hunchback, white hair like a broom, a crown and a bun about two feet long; The maid was stunned and turned white, and Mrs. Tai was also startled, and the two maids gathered under the window to watch him. The widow suddenly forced the window and sprayed directly into the lattice, the window paper was broken, the three of them were all served, and the family did not know.","When Mr. Song Wan, whose hometown was Laiyang, worked as a ministry official, the house he rented was very desolate and isolated. One evening, while two maids were looking after his mother as she went to sleep in the main hall, they heard a squirting sound in the courtyard, just like when a tailor sprays water from his mouth onto a cloth before ironing it. The mother urged the maids to get up, and when they poked a hole in the window paper they saw an old woman, short and hunchbacked, with broom-bristlely, snow-white hair coiled up on top of her head, about two chi in length, walking around the courtyard in a circle, taking long, quick steps like a crane, spouting water endlessly as she walked. Stunned, the servant girls returned and described it all. Song’s mother was also startled and got up, the two maidservants helping her to the window where they watched together. The old woman suddenly rushed close to the window, spraying directly inside through the frame, splitting the window paper, and the three women fell down as though dead, though the family members knew nothing of this.","Song Wan of Laiyang was appointed Secretary to one of the Boards, and rented a very dilapidated house in the capital. One night, his mother, who was sleeping in the main hall, waited on by two maidservants, heard a strange sound coming from her courtyard outside, like the sound made by a tailor spitting on his cloth. She told her maids to poke a hole in the paper lattice and see what they could see. They beheld an old lady, short and hunchbacked, her white hair done up in a two-inch topknot, prancing around the courtyard like a crane. And as she pranced, an endless stream of water came spurting from her mouth. The maids, frightened by this strange sight, reported back at once to their lady, who was horrified. They helped her up to the window to see for herself, and at that very moment the old prancing crone came closer and spat a mouthful of water straight at them, splitting the paper and causing all three women to fall flat on the ground. It was the middle of the night, and not a soul in the family was aware of what was happening."
又一年及期而去，久不複返，疑之。一日忽至，因問其故。答曰：“我幾不複見子矣！曩欲遠避，心頗怠，視陰溝甚隱，遂潛伏卷甕下。不意靈官糞除至此，瞥爲所睹，憤欲加鞭，餘懼而逃。靈官追逐甚急。至黄河上，瀕將及矣。大窘無計，竄伏溷中。神惡其穢，始返身去。既出，臭惡沾染，不可複游人世。乃投水自濯訖，又蟄隱穴中凡百日，垢濁始淨。今來相别，兼以致囑，君亦宜隱身他去，大劫將來，此非福地也。”言已辭去，道士依言别徙。未幾而有甲申之變。,"Another year has gone by on time, and it will not return for a long time, so I doubt it. One day suddenly came, because I asked the reason. The answer said: ""I almost never see my son! I wanted to avoid it, my heart was quite lazy, and I saw the gutter as a hidden place, so I hid under the urn. Feared and fled. Lingguan chased very urgently. On the Yellow River, it was on the verge of reaching. I was embarrassed and ran into the middle. He threw himself into the water to wash himself, and then squatted in the hidden cave for a hundred days, and the filth and turbidity began to be clean. Now come to see each other, and at the same time, you should also hide away from him, and the great calamity will come, this is not a blessed land."" Go, Taoist priests do not move according to their words. Soon there was a change in Jiashen.","I have no place to stay then, so I run somewhere and hide myself.” After another year, the memorial day arrived again and he went out, but after a long time he didn’t return. The priest became concerned. One day, the old man suddenly returned. The priest asked him what had happened. By way of answer, he explained, “I almost didn’t make it back to see you! I’d been wanting to keep my distance from them but was quite careless about it, so when I spotted a covering over a cavity that was very well concealed, and was satisfied that it was out of sight, I hid in a small jug underneath it. “I didn’t expect the magistrate of the heavenly and mortal worlds to come here to take part in the cleaning. When he looked in my direction and caught sight of me, he became so angry that he wanted to thrash me. I was so scared that I tried to run away. The magistrate came after me then, with great speed. “I arrived at the head of the Yellow River and he was just about to catch me. Under enormous pressure, on the spur of the moment, I decided to dive into the shit in a toilet. The magistrate’s spirit couldn’t stand to get itself dirty, so he immediately returned to his body and left. “Once he was gone, I was soaked in the toilet’s smelly foulness and couldn’t return to the mortal world again, so I just went on. I jumped into the water and washed repeatedly, then went into seclusion and hid in a cave for many, many days, filthy and greasy, only eventually able to get clean. “Now that I’ve arrived to say farewell to you before departing, you’d also better become a hermit somewhere else: a calamity’s about to arrive here and this is not a blessed place.” His speech finished, he took his leave and moved on. The Daoist priest complied with his words and went elsewhere. Soon afterwards, Jia Shen’s unexpected turn of events occurred.","So I have to go somewhere else.’ The following year, he left as he always did, but this time there was a longer interval than usual before he returned. His Taoist friend thought it strange and questioned him again. ‘This time you nearly saw the last of me!’ replied the old man. ‘I meant to get well away, but somehow I was feeling too lazy, so I thought I’d be safe sneaking under that big vat at the back, the one they use to cover the drain outlet. It seemed a good enough hiding place. But I was unlucky. One of the Spirit Guardians came to that very spot to cleanse it, and when he saw me he attacked me angrily with his whip. I fled in terror, but he chased me all the way to the Yellow River. He was just about to catch up with me, and in sheer desperation I threw myself into a cesspit. That was too disgusting for the Guardian, and he turned back. When I pulled myself out of the cesspit, I absolutely stank, I was much too foul to return to humanity. First I jumped in some water to clean myself up, then I stayed underground for months, waiting for the filth and the stench to wear off. Today I have come to say goodbye, and to give you a warning. Leave this place. Take refuge somewhere else. A great disaster is on its way. This is not a good place to be.’ And with these words he left. The Taoist took his advice and went elsewhere. Sure enough, before long the troubles of the last days of the Ming dynasty began."
會上元，有舅氏子吳生邀同眺矚，方至村外，舅家僕來招吳去。生見游女如雲，乘興獨游。有女郎擕婢，拈梅花一枝，容華絕代，笑容可掬。生注目不移，竟忘顧忌。女過去數武，顧婢子笑曰：“個兒郎目灼灼似贼！”遺花地上，笑語自去。生拾花悵然，神魂喪失，怏怏遂返。至家，藏花枕底，垂頭而睡，不語亦不食。母憂之，醮禳益劇，肌革銳減。醫師診視，投劑發表，忽忽若迷。母撫問所由，默然不答。適吳生來，囑祕詰之。吳至榻前，生見之淚下，吳就榻慰解，漸致研詰，生具吐其實，且求謀畫。吳笑曰：“君意亦癡！此願有何難遂？當代訪之。徒步於野，必非世家，如其未字，事固諧矣，不然，拚以重賂，計必允遂。但得痊瘳，成事在我。”生聞之不覺解頤。吳出告母，物色女子居里。而探訪既窮，並無蹤蹟。母大憂，無所爲計。然自吳去後，顏頓開，食亦略進。數日吳複來，生問所謀。吳绐之曰：“已得之矣。我以爲誰何人，乃我姑之女，即君姨妹，今尚待聘。雖内戚有婚姻之嫌，實告之無不諧者。”生喜溢眉宇，問：“居何里？”吳詭曰：“西南山中，去此可三十餘里。”生又囑再四，吳銳身自任而去。,"At the Yuan meeting, Wu Sheng, the uncle's son, invited him to look out, and went outside the village, and his uncle's servant came to recruit Wu. When I saw a travel girl like a cloud, I traveled alone. There is a girl with a maid, holding a branch of plum blossoms, Ronghua is peerless and smiling. Sheng's attention was fixed, and he forgot his scruples. The girl went over to count the martial arts, and the maid Gu smiled and said, ""He's as bright as a thief!"" On the floor of the dead flower, the laughter went away. Sheng Hua was disappointed, lost his spirit, and returned unhappy. When he arrives at home, he hides the flowers at the bottom of his pillow, sleeps with his head down, and does not speak or eat. The mother is worried about it. Physician diagnosis, administration and publication, all of a sudden. The mother asked why, but silently did not answer. When Wu was born, he asked the secret to interrogate him. When Wu arrived in front of the couch, he was in tears when he saw it. Wu went to the couch to comfort him. Wu smiled and said: ""Your intentions are also crazy! Why is it difficult to fulfill this wish? I will visit today. Walking in the wild, it must not be an aristocratic family. If it is not written, things will be harmonious. But it's up to me to be cured."" Sheng Xieyi heard it without realizing it. Wu went out to sue his mother, looking for a woman, Curie. And the visit is poor and there is no trace. The mother is so worried, there is nothing to do. However, after Wu left, Yan Dun opened and the food came in a little. A few days later, Wu came back and asked him what he was planning. Wu Lingzhi said: ""I have already obtained it. I thought who and who was my aunt's daughter, namely Jun Auntie, who is still waiting for employment. Although there is a suspicion of marriage among relatives, the truth is that there are no discordant people."" Meiyu asked, ""Where do you live?"" Wu Wei said, ""In the mountains in the southwest, you can go here for more than thirty miles.""","When the Lantern Festival arrived, his cousin, Wu, invited him to do some sightseeing. When they’d just reached the village outskirts, a servant from Wu’s family ran up, summoning Wu to return home. Wang saw that there were groups of girls out wandering around, so he decided to continue strolling by himself. Accompanied by a maid, there was a young woman holding a branch of plum blossoms, a matchlessly gorgeous beauty, whose smiling face captivated him. Wang glued his eyes on her, without a second thought concerning proper behavior. The girl walked past him several paces, then turned to her maid and said, “That young man has eyes that blaze like a thief’s!” Leaving the plum blossom branch behind on the ground, laughing and chattering, she walked away. Leaving the plum blossom branch behind: Pu is playing with semantic ambiguity here—yí, to leave behind, can also be read as wei, to send or present as a gift, suggesting that perhaps Yingning (despite her later comments to the contrary) is entirely aware of the “token” she has left for Wang to find. Wang picked up the branch, disappointed, feeling as if he’d lost his very soul, and then sadly returned home. Once in the house, he slipped the blossoms under his pillow, laid down and went to sleep, refusing thereafter to speak to anyone or to eat anything. His mother became very worried about him. Priests were summoned to put a stop to his decline, but only made things worse. His flesh toughened like hide, and he dropped an alarming amount of weight. Doctors examined him, prescribing medicines that only worked to bring the internal causes of his condition to surface on his skin, and he lay there as if in a trance. His mother caressed him and asked what was causing his condition, but he remained silent, offering no answer. Right at that time, Wu arrived, so Wang’s mother urged him secretly to find out what was going on. Wu went to his cousin’s bedside, and Wang’s tears fell when he saw him. From the edge of the bed, Wu sought to put him at ease, little by little working toward the source of the problem. Wang revealed the matter and begged Wu to help him plan what to do. Wu laughed and said, “Your overreaction is ridiculous! What’s so tough about fulfilling your desire? I’ll go locate her. Since she was out and about on foot in the countryside, she must not be from an influential family. If she’s not already betrothed, surely we can come to an agreement; and even if she is, we’ll go all out with a heavy bribe and surely that’ll settle the matter. But you have to take care of yourself, while I take care of everything else.” When Wang heard this, his face relaxed into a smile. Wu went and informed Wang’s mother that the issue was a girl who lived in the vicinity, and though he subsequently searched and inquired thoroughly, he could find no trace of her. The mother was terribly worried, but there was simply nothing else to try to do. However, just after Wu had left to search, Wang’s outlook brightened, and he began to eat and move around. Several days later, Wu came again. Wang asked him how his plan was working. Wu fibbed, “I found her. I was curious who she was, and it turns out she’s my aunt’s daughter— so she’s also your cousin, and she’s still waiting to be married. Even though you’re closely related and there is resistance to allowing cousins to marry, when we tell her how you feel, surely anything is possible between the two of you.” Wang’s happiness spread over his face as he asked, “Where does she live?” Wu made something up: “In the hills to the southwest, about thirty li or so.” Wang repeatedly begged him to settle the matter, so Wu vigorously swore he would take care of it and left.","Our tale begins one Lantern Festival, on the first full moon of the year, when Wang's maternal cousin, a young man by the name of Wu, invited him out for a stroll. No sooner had they reached the outskirts of the village than a family servant came hurrying up to summon Wu home. Wang continued on his own. He had seen how many good-looking girls there were out taking the air, and felt in the mood for a promenade. One young lady was out walking with her maid and had just picked a spray of plum-blossom. She had the prettiest face imaginable, with a great beaming smile. Wang stared at her utterly captivated, mindless of the usual rules of modesty and propriety. She walked a few steps past him and then turned to her maid: ‘Who is that young man staring at me, with those burning burglar's eyes?’ She dropped the plum-blossom on the ground and walked on, talking and laughing animatedly as she went. Wang retrieved the blossom from the ground with a melancholy air and stood there a while musing abstractedly, before returning home in a mood of profound dejection. When he reached home, he hid the plum-blossom beneath his pillow, lay disconsolately down to sleep, and from that moment on would neither talk nor eat. As the days went by, his mother became very anxious about him. She had elaborate rituals of exorcism performed, but despite all her efforts her son grew thinner and thinner. Doctors examined him and prescribed herbal concoctions to bring out the disease, but his mind seemed to wander all the more feverishly. He was like a man possessed. When his mother tried asking, with great tenderness and concern, how it had all started, he refused to say anything. One day, his cousin Wu came to the house, and Wang's mother secretly begged him to try to extract the truth from her son. Wu approached his bedside, and the minute he saw him, Wang burst into tears. Wu began by speaking words of comfort, and then gradually brought the conversation round to the subject of his cousin's illness and its origin. Wang confided in him, telling him the whole story of his hopeless infatuation with the smiling girl and begging him for his advice. ‘Oh, you foolish fellow!’ said Wu, laughing, but pleasantly. ‘Your desire can easily be fulfilled. Let me seek the young lady out on your behalf. Since she was allowed to go out walking like that on her own, it is highly unlikely that she is from some grand family. So long as she is not yet betrothed, you can consider the match as good as settled! And even if she is betrothed, I am sure a generous gift in the right quarter will clear the way for you. You just concentrate on making a full recovery and leave the rest to me.’ Wang smiled wanly when he heard this, and Wu went out and informed his aunt, before himself setting off in search of the girl. Although, to the growing despair of Wang's mother, his exhaustive inquiries brought no results, Wang himself had been greatly cheered by his cousin's visit, and gradually recovered his appetite. When Wu called round again several days later and Wang asked him how the matter was progressing, Wu felt obliged to invent a story. ‘It's all settled! It turns out (would you believe it!) that the girl you saw that day is my own cousin – which makes her yours too, on your mother's side. She is still waiting to be betrothed. The two of you are a little more closely related than is usually thought proper, but that won’t stop you from getting married. I’m sure I can explain everything to them, and the wedding can go ahead.’ Wang's joy knew no bounds. ‘Where does she live?’ he asked. Wu improvised. ‘In the hills south-west of here, ten miles or so away.’ Wang begged him again and again to be sure to take care of everything, and Wu went striding off, giving him every assurance that he would do so."
東郡某甲，以弄蛇爲業。嚐蓄馴蛇二，皆青色，其大者呼之大青，小曰二青。二青額有赤點，尤靈馴，盤鏇無不如意。蛇人愛之異於他蛇。期年大青死，思補其缺，未暇遑也。一夜寄宿山寺。既明啟笥，二青亦渺，蛇人悵恨欲死。冥蒐亟呼，迄無影兆。然每至豐林茂草，輒縱之去，俾得自適，尋複返；以此故冀其自至。坐伺之，日既高，亦已絕望，怏怏遂行。出門數武，聞叢薪錯楚中窸窣作響，停趾愕顧，則二青來也。大喜，如穫拱璧。息肩路隅，蛇亦頓止。視其後，小蛇從焉。撫之曰：“我以汝爲逝矣。小侶而所薦耶？”出餌飼之，兼飼小蛇。小蛇雖不去，然瑟縮不敢食。二青含哺之，宛似主人之讓客者。蛇人又飼之，乃食。食已，隨二青俱入笥中。荷去教之鏇摺，輒中規矩，與二青無少異，因名之小青。炫技四方，穫利無算。,"A certain Jia in Dongjun made his business by catching snakes. Taste the two taming snakes, all of which are blue, the larger ones are called Daqing, and the smaller ones are called Erqing. Er Qing has red spots on his forehead, You Lingtun, circling is not unsatisfactory. Snake people love differently than other snakes. Daqing died at a young age, thinking about making up for his lack, not even having time to spare. Overnight stay at Mountain Temple. Since Ming Qi is bright, and Er Qing is also small, the snake man is stunned and wants to die. The deep search is urgently called, so far there is no shadow sign. However, every time I reach the abundant forests and lush grasses, I will go straight to it, so that I can get comfortable and find it again. Sitting and waiting, the sun is high, but also despair, and proceed in despair. Going out for a few martial arts, hearing Cong Xin's mistake in Chu Chu's rustling sound, stop toes and stare, then Erqing comes. Overjoyed, such as getting a crown. At the corner of the road, the snake stopped. After looking at it, the little snake followed. Fu Zhi said: ""I think you have passed away. Is it recommended by my little companion?"" Although the little snake didn't go, it shrank back and didn't dare to eat. Erqing feeds him, just like a host giving in to guests. The snake-man feeds it and eats it. After eating, enter the hut with the two greens. The twists and turns of Hego to teach are very well-behaved, no different from Erqing, hence the name Xiaoqing. Show off your skills in all directions, and make no profit.","In East Prefecture, there was a certain fellow who trained snakes to perform for a living. He once raised and trained two snakes together, both entirely green: he called the larger one Big Green, the smaller one, Green the Second. Green the Second had a red-spotted forehead and was especially clever and cooperative, invariably winding and swaying just as he wished it to do. The snake man took a special fancy to it, favoring it over his other snakes. After a year passed, Big Green died, and though the trainer thought about trying to fill its vacancy, he could never find the time to do so. One night, he stayed at a monastery in the mountains. At daybreak, he opened his bamboo basket and Green the Second was nowhere to be seen. The snake man was so bitterly disappointed, he wanted to die. He searched high and low, calling out for Green the Second, but there was no sign of the snake. Previously, whenever they would pass through a grove with abundant grass, he always let it out so it could enjoy itself, and it would return again when he went to look for it; on this occasion, he hoped, of course, for the same result. He sat and waited until the sun was high in the sky and he was worn out from watching, then, dispirited, he finally left. He’d only gone a few steps out the monastery’s door when he distinctly heard something inside a pile of kindling, making the sound of a snake’s hissing. He froze in his tracks, startled, and looked back at it: there was Green the Second. He was overjoyed—it was like he’d found a huge piece of jade. He stopped to set his load down at the side of the road and Green the Second also stopped suddenly. The snake man noticed that a little snake was also following behind them. Petting Green the Second, he said, “I was afraid you’d gone for good. Is this your little buddy?” The snake man took out some treats for it and for the little snake as well. The little snake, however, wouldn’t move towards them, being so timid and frightened that it wouldn’t venture near the food. Green the Second took some in its mouth to feed it, in the same way that a host might offer some to a guest. The snake man also offered it some more, and it ate that, too. Once it had been fed, it followed Green the Second into the basket. He carried it back with him and taught it to gyrate and sway, and always to be well-behaved. Soon it was no less trained than Green the Second, and for that reason he named it Little Green. Showing off their talents everywhere he went, he raked in more money than he could count.","A certain man of Dongjun district made a living as a snake-charmer. He raised and trained two green snakes, the larger of which he called Big Green, and the smaller, Little Green. Little Green was his favourite. He had a red dot on the front of his head and was very quick to learn, writhing and coiling exactly in tune with his master's wishes. After a year Big Green died, and the snake-charmer, although he meant to find a replacement, somehow never got round to doing so. Once, after spending the night in a temple in the hills, he awoke at dawn and opened his basket to find that Little Green had disappeared. He was utterly distraught, and went calling and searching everywhere in the half-light, without finding any trace of the snake. Previously on his travels, whenever he came to a bosk or a stretch of dense undergrowth, he used to set Little Green free to roam as he pleased and the snake invariably returned of his own accord. So this time the snake-charmer hoped that he would do the same, and sat down to wait. But when the sun had climbed high in the sky and there was still no sign of the snake, he gave up hope and went disconsolately on his way. He had walked only a little way from the temple when he heard a low rustling sound coming from a nearby thicket. He stood stock-still, gazing intently into the thicket, and out came Little Green. The snake-charmer was as overjoyed to see him as a man stumbling by chance upon some priceless gem. He continued on his way, and a little while later, when he put down his carrying pole and stopped to rest at a turn in the road, the snake stopped with him. When the snake-charmer looked back, he saw an even smaller snake following Little Green. ‘I thought I’d lost you!’ he said, stroking Little Green. ‘ So this is your little companion?’ He took out some food for them both. The smaller one made no attempt to escape, but coiled himself up and refused the food. Little Green fed him from his own mouth, with great solicitude. The second time the snake-charmer offered him something to eat, he took it, and when the meal was over, he followed Little Green into his basket. The snake-charmer trained the newcomer, who mastered the tricks as perfectly as Little Green had done. He called him Baby Green, and went all round the country with his new act, making a great deal of money."
值歲大饑，楊困甚，無所爲計，妻漫勸詣丁，從之。至諸城，通姓名於門者，丁茫不憶，申言始憶之。踩履而出，揖客入，見其衣敝踵決，居之溫室，設筵相款，寵禮異常。明日爲制冠服，表里溫暖。楊義之，而内顧增憂，褊心不能無少望，居數日殊不言贈别。楊意甚急，告丁曰：“顧不敢隱，僕來時米不滿升。今過蒙推解固樂，妻子如何矣！”丁曰：“是無煩慮，已代經紀矣。幸舒意少留，當助資斧。”走伻招諸博徒，使楊坐而抽頭，終夜得百金，乃送之還。歸見室人，衣履鮮整，小婢侍焉。驚問之，妻言：“自君去後，次日即有車徒齎送布帛米粟，堆積滿屋，雲是丁客所贈。又給一婢，爲妾驅使。”楊感不自已。由此小康，不屑舊業矣。,"At the age of starvation, Yang was very sleepy and had nothing to do, so his wife persuaded Ding to follow him. When he arrived at the various cities, Ding Mang did not remember the person whose name was passed on to the door, but Shen Yan began to remember it. Stepping out, welcoming guests in, seeing that their clothes are smashed, living in a greenhouse, setting up a banquet with pictures, and giving unusual gifts. Tomorrow is the uniform of the crown, warm inside and outside. Yang Yizhi, but his inner concerns increased, and his heart could not be hopeless, and he did not say goodbye for a few days. Yang Yi was very anxious, and told Ding: ""Gu dare not hide, when the servant came, the rice was dissatisfied. Now I have passed Mengjie to solve Gule, how is my wife!"" Ding said: ""I have no worries, I have already acted as an agent. Fortunately Shu Yi stays for a while, and you should use it as an axe for funding."" The walker recruited the disciples, and made Yang sit and tap his head. He got a hundred gold all night, and he gave it back. Returning to see the housekeeper, the clothes are fresh and the shoes are neat, and the little maid is serving. When asked in surprise, his wife said: ""After the monarch left, the next day, there will be chariots delivering cloth, silk, rice and millet, which piled up the house. The cloud was given by Ding Ke. I also gave it to a maid to be driven by my concubine."" . From this, we are well-off, and we disdain the old business.","Years passed, and he heard no news of his former host. Then it happened one year that there was a great famine, and the Yang family became desperate in their poverty. Yang’s wife persuaded him to pay a visit to Ding, so he went. Once he arrived, he gave his name at Ding’s gate, but Ding didn’t remember him; once Yang repeatedly explained, however, Ding remembered everything. He slipped on some sandals and ran outside, bowing to his visitor and ushering him inside. When he noticed Yang’s raggedy clothing and worn-out shoes, he brought him to a warm room, laid out a feast, and entertained him with extraordinarily lavish generosity. The next day, Ding had a cap and a set of clothes made for Yang, to keep him warm. Yang was grateful; but he worried about his family more and more, anxious that he couldn’t know how they were doing, since he was so far away. After Yang been staying there for several days, Ding still hadn’t said anything particular about offering him assistance once he decided to leave. Yang’s thoughts remained extremely troubled, so he told his host, “When I first saw you, I didn’t dare reveal the facts: when I came here to prostrate myself before you, we didn’t even have a sheng of rice left. Now, due to your kind treatment, I’m fine. But what about my family!” Ding reassured him, “Don’t let it prey on your mind, for I’ve already taken care of the details. I hope you’ll allow yourself the leisure of staying a little longer, so I can help provide you with some traveling expenses.” Then he sent his servants out to summon various gamblers, so Yang could sit there and ask them for a share of their profits, till by the end of the evening he had collected a hundred taels, and Ding saw him off for his return trip. Once he was back home, Yang spotted his wife dressed in brand new clothing and shoes, with a young maidservant waiting on her. Startled, he asked what had happened. His wife explained, “The day after you left, servants with carts came to offer us cloth, silk, and grain, piling it all up until they filled a room, saying it was a present from Ding, who was once a guest here. Even this maid was sent to serve me.” Yang couldn’t express how moved he was by all this. Hence his family became moderately wealthy, and Yang never had to resort to his old way of making ends meet.","Several years passed, and Ding had no news of the Yang family. Then came a year of terrible famine, during which the Yangs suffered greatly and were reduced to dire straits. Mrs Yang urged her husband to call on Ding, and he took her advice, making his way to Zhucheng and giving his name to Ding's gate-man. At first Ding hardly remembered who he was. But a few inquiries jogged his memory and he hurried out in his slippers to greet his guest and invite him in, bowing politely with hands clasped. Yang was wearing rags and worn-out shoes, and Ding at once showed him to a warm room, served him a veritable banquet and treated him with great respect and affection. The following day he had a thick, lined robe made for his guest. Yang was touched by Ding's generous hospitality, but his own family's survival was still in the forefront of his mind, and he could not help but hope for some more material aid. Several days went by without any mention of his being sent home with a parting gift, and finally Yang felt obliged to speak out. ‘I cannot conceal this from you any longer, sir! When I came here to see you, we had less than a bushel of rice left at home. You have made me very comfortable here, and I thank you for your great generosity. But what of my wife and family?’ ‘Please do not concern yourself on their behalf,’ replied Ding. ‘I have already seen to their needs. Set your mind at ease, and stay here with us for a little longer. Naturally when you do leave I also wish to provide you with your travelling expenses.’ He invited gamblers from all over town to his house, put Yang in charge of the game in such a way that he would make a healthy profit, and by the end of the night Yang had earned himself the considerable sum of one hundred taels of silver. Now Ding accompanied him home. He arrived to find his wife decked out in fine new clothes, and a young maidservant waiting on her. Yang asked her in astonishment what had occurred. ‘After you left,’ she replied, ‘the very next day, a carriage came laden with cloth and silk and grain, enough to fill a whole room. The man said it was a gift from a former lodger of ours, Mr Ding. And he presented me with this maidservant, to wait upon me.’ Yang was overwhelmed by this act of generosity."

Chu Yu Qiao Niang said: ""Lang has a lot of work to send books, and will keep recruiting San Niang to come to hand over to sister Dian. Let's close it again, so that people won't get bored."" Then he went out. It is boring to turn around, and when it is close to the door, it is like a bird peeping into a cage. Seeing Qiao Niang, she wanted to say hello to her, but she stopped ashamed. Extending to the night, the woman began to bring her daughter back. Fa Fei said, ""You are bored, sir! Sanniang can come to thank you."" On the way, people patrolled in and tried to restrain themselves. The woman ordered each other to call her brothers and sisters, and Qiao Niang smiled and said, ""Sisters are also acceptable."" They also went out of the hall and sat in groups to drink. After drinking the second time, Qiao Niang asked, ""Are the temple people also attracted to beauties?"" Sheng said: ""The lame do not forget to walk, and the blind do not forget to see."" Xiang and Charan Ran. Qiao Niang was exhausted by San Niang and was forced to be resettled. The woman takes care of Sanniang, to be born with her. Sanniang can't be ashamed. The woman said, ""Why should you be afraid of this husband who is a wife?"" She urged him to go with him. He privately told Sheng, ""Yin is my son-in-law, and Yang is my son, that's fine."" Sheng was delighted, grabbed his arms and got on the bed, and started a new test. He knew how fast he was, and he asked his daughter on the pillow, ""Who is Qiao-niang?"" and said: ""It's a ghost. The talent has no color, but the fate of the time is falling. It is suitable for the young man of the Mao family. He is sick and castrated. At the age of eighteen, he can't be a person. Because the town is not smooth, he hates it like a ghost."" ghost. The girl said, ""I tell you the truth, my concubine is not a ghost, a fox's ear. Qiao Niang lives alone without a couple, and my mother and son have no home, so I will live in a hut."" She was stunned. The woman said: ""No fear, although it is a ghost and a fox, it is not a calamity."" Although she knows that Qiao Niang is not a human being, she loves Qijuan well, and only hates self-giving without gaps. Born Yunruo, good at flattery, quite pity. One day, Fahrenheit's mother and son took him to the closed room. Feeling sullen, she called Qiao Niang around the door of the room; Qiao Niang ordered her maid to try and count the keys, but she was able to open it. When Sheng Fu Er invited her, Qiao Niang sent her maid to go, and Sheng pulled her to the couch, snuggled up to him, and the female opera pressed her navel under her navel and said, ""It's a pity that Ke Er is absent here."" Before she could finish her words, her tentacles were full of grips. Jing said: ""Why was it so vague before, and suddenly tired!"" Sheng laughed and said: ""I was ashamed to see guests before, so I shrunk, and now I am embarrassed by slander, and talk about it like a frog's angry ears."" He just said: ""Now I know there is a reason for closing the household. In the past, my mother and son were wandering and living in a fake cottage. Sanniang studied embroidery, and her concubine had a lot of secrets. It's just jealous!"" Sheng comforted him, and With love, Qiao Niang finally titled it. Sheng said: ""Secret! Gu Hua told me to be strict."" Before he could speak, Gu Hua hid in, and the two emperors abruptly got up. Gu Hua looked up and asked, ""Who opened the door?"" Qiao Niang smiled and admitted to herself. Hua Yi was furious and chattered endlessly. Therefore, Qiao Niang said: ""Grandma is also laughing at people! What can a woman who is a husband and a woman do?"" Seeing that her mother and Qiao Niang were struggling, San Niang felt uneasy, and used a single body to mediate the two rooms, and then each became angry. for joy. Although Qiao Niang was angry, she naturally gave in to San Niang. But Hua Gu was on guard day and night, and she couldn't show her feelings for herself.","As daylight spilled over the windowsills, Auntie Hua entered, carrying steamed cakes into the room for him, warning him to sit still, and upon leaving, shut the door behind her. She went and told Qiaoniang, “Since the young man performed a worthy deed by delivering the letter, we need to detain him until Sanniang arrives, so they can get to know each other, like elder and younger sisters. For the time being, keep him shut up in there so we can avoid upsetting or annoying anyone.” Then she walked out the door and departed. Lian was pacing in boredom, every so often opening the door a crack, like a bird peeking out of its cage. He spotted Qiaoniang, and felt the urge to summon her so he could display himself to her, but was too bashful and stopped himself. He was involved thus till about midnight, when Auntie Hua brought her daughter home. She opened his door and remarked, “The gentleman must be very bored! Sanniang, come here and formally thank him.” The girl from his road encounter shyly entered, then turned to face Lian, and greeted him respectfully. Auntie Hua directed them to call each other elder brother and younger sister. Qiaoniang giggled and said, “They can also call each other elder sister and younger sister.” They all went together into the main room, where the group sat together while wine was served. As they were drinking, Qiaoniang teasingly asked Lian, “Are eunuchs also aroused by beautiful women?” “The lame never forget what it’s like to have walked,” Lian replied, “and the blind never forget what it’s like to have seen.” They all smiled broadly at his words. Qiaoniang noticed that Sanniang was fatigued from traveling, so she forced her to go to bed. Auntie Hua then gave Sanniang a glance to indicate that she should go and sleep with Lian. Sanniang, embarrassed and nervous, wouldn’t move. Auntie Hua encouraged her, “This socalled man is actually a woman, so what’s there to be afraid of?” She urged the two to leave together. Privately she advised Lian, “In secret, you’re my son-in-law; publicly, you’re my son— that’s the deal.” Delighted, Lian took Sanniang’s arm, and led her onto his bed, where it was like he was using a grindstone to test a new blade, and his pleasure was obvious. Once they were finished and resting on pillows, he asked her, “What kind of person is Qiaoniang?” “She’s a ghost,” Sanniang answered. “Her talent and looks are unequalled, but it’s her fate to suffer misfortune. She married a young gentleman of the Mao family, but he was impotent, and by the age of eighteen he still couldn’t function, so she became depressed and moribund, till the regret she harbored sent her to her grave.” Lian was shocked and began to suspect that Sanniang, too, was a ghost. “To tell you the truth,” she said, “I’m not a ghost, but a fox. Qiaoniang was living alone without a mate, while I and my mother had no home, so we took advantage of the situation to settle here.” Lian was quite stunned. Sanniang told him, “Don’t worry, we may be ghosts and foxes, but we won’t cause you any misfortune.” Henceforth, they chatted and ate together every day. Though Lian knew Qiaoniang wasn’t human, yet he loved her for her beauty and goodness, and his sole regret was that he hadn’t had an opportunity to expose himself to her. Lian was cultured and restrained, yet good at pleasing people by telling them jokes, so Qiaoniang began to feel affection for him. One day, as Auntie Hua and Sanniang were about to go out, they shut Lian up again in his room. Lian sulked, pacing the room in circles, and calling through the door to Qiaoniang. Qiaoniang ordered a maidservant to try out several keys, then finally got the door open. Lian leaned close to her ear and asked her to come in with him. Qiaoniang sent the maidservant away. Lian then pulled her close to him on the bed, snuggling face to face with her. Qiaoniang mockingly reached down below his navel with both hands, and said, “It’s a pity that this part of my boyfriend is lost.” She hadn’t even finished these words before she found her hands absolutely full. Astonished, she exclaimed, “What was so tiny last time, is suddenly huge!” Lian laughed as he told her, “Last time it was too shy to come out for a visitor, so it remained shrunken; now with all the embarrassing ridicule and slander, it grew bigger, just like a frog when it gets angry.” Then they made love together. When they were finished, Qiaoniang angrily exclaimed, “Now I know why they’ve kept your door shut. Before, when mother and daughter were drifting without a place to stay, they availed themselves of my home. Sanniang learned to embroider from me, and I never kept even the smallest secret from her. For her to act like this now out of jealousy—!” Lian calmed her down, and explained what had happened. Qiaoniang finally relented. “It’s a secret,” Lian said, “and Auntie Hua urged me to keep it that way.” He’d just finished speaking, when Auntie Hua suddenly entered. The two, surprised, leapt out of bed. The woman cast an angry eye, and demanded, “Who opened his door?” With a smile, Qiaoniang admitted she was responsible. This made Auntie Hua even more furious, prompting a stream of curses from her. Qiaoniang just laughed, and exclaimed, “Granny, what a big laugh! This is a man who’s really a woman, so what use can he possibly be?” Sanniang, upset from observing the acerbic exchange between her mother and Qiaoniang, tried to intervene between the two, and finally managed to turn their stubborn anger into amity. While Qiaoniang’s words still seemed resentful and resistant, subsequently she recognized Sanniang’s intention and cooperated with her. But Auntie Hua remained vigilant day and night, so the two lovers had no chance to act on their desires for each other, and could only express their emotions through significant glances.","When dawn broke, Auntie Hua came in with some freshly baked cakes for him, telling him to be patient and wait there. She closed the door and went out again, taking Clever aside. ‘ That young man has done us a service. In return I want Tertia to adopt him as her brother. I’ve put him in the guest room and locked the door, so you won’t have to see him and upset yourself again.’ And with these words, Auntie Hua went on her way. Lian, meanwhile, was growing bored and starting to fret. From time to time he went to a crack in the door and pressed himself up against it like a caged bird. Whenever he saw Clever passing by he wanted to call out to her and tell her his good news, but was always too coy to do so. That evening Auntie Hua came back with her daughter Tertia and pushed open the door. ‘I fear we have cooped you up all day!’ she exclaimed. ‘Come, Tertia, say thank you to this kind gentleman.’ Her daughter came sidling into the room, brought her sleeves together and curtseyed to Lian. Auntie Hua told them to address each other thenceforth as brother and sister. ‘Why doesn’t she call him sister too…’ sniggered Clever in the background. Now they all went together to the main room, where they sat and drank a while. After a few cups of wine Clever began teasing him: ‘Tell me, do eunuchs get excited too, when they see a beautiful woman?’ ‘The cripple,’ replied Lian, ‘can never forget the joy of walkiing. Nor the blind man forget the joy of sight.’ This brought a round of laughter. Clever could see that Tertia was tired, and urged her to go and rest , whereupon Auntie Hua gave her daughter a knowing look, clearly indicating that she was to go with Lian. The girl seemed a little bashful. ‘Come,’ urged her mother, a little untruthfully, ‘he may seem a man, but really he's more of a woman. There's really nothing to fear!’ She chivvied them along, whispering conspiratorially to Lian as he went, ‘Between ourselves, you are already as good as my son-in-law, even if to the outside world you are only her adopted brother.’ Lian was delighted and, taking Tertia by the arm, hurried with her to bed. There he set to in earnest, and since his was a newly honed blade, his joy in his newfound accomplishment can be readily imagined. Afterwards the two of them conversed intimately. ‘Tell me something about Clever,’ he asked her. ‘ What sort of a person is she?’ ‘She is a ghost,’ replied Tertia, with a matter-of-fact air. ‘ Such a beautiful girl, but so unlucky! In her lifetime she was married to a Mr Mao, who turned out not to be a real man at all, and even when he was eighteen he was still incapable of – you know what… So the poor girl had a sad time of it. She carried her bitterness with her to the grave.’ Lian was astonished by this tale and wondered to himself if Tertia might not be a ghost too. She divined his thoughts. ‘No, the truth is, I am a fox. Clever was living here in this tomb on her own and my mother and I had nowhere to go, so she let us move in with her.’ Now Lian was well and truly terrified. ‘Don’t be afraid,’ said Tertia. ‘We may be ghost and fox, but we will do you no harm.’ From that day forth, Lian spent his time with them both. They took their meals together and whiled away the days pleasantly in idle conversation. Although he now knew Clever to be a ghost, he was nonetheless greatly attracted to her. But somehow he never had an opportunity to show his feelings. Clever, for her part, found him a gentle, refined person and a witty conversationalist, and was herself drawn to him. One day, Auntie Hua and her daughter Tertia went out, and as usual they locked Lian up in his room. He felt very much at a loose end and prowled restlessly round and round the room, occasionally calling Clever's name through the door. Clever told one of the maids to try out several keys, and in the end they succeeded in opening the door. Lian whispered something in Clever's ear, and she told the maid to leave them alone in the room, whereupon Lian took her in his arms, carried her over to the bed and embraced her passionately. She began to fondle his crutch, murmuring, ‘ My poor darling… To have nothing there at all…’ Even as she was speaking, she became aware that her hand had encountered something rather substantial. ‘What's this!’ she cried in surprise. ‘The other day he was a midget – and now he's a giant!’ ‘The other day,’ laughed Lian, ‘when you first met him, he was just a bit shy. Today he's hurt by the horrid things you’ve been saying about him… He's angry and puffed up like a frog…’ They lost no time and were soon making love. Afterwards Clever said angrily, ‘No wonder Auntie Hua kept you locked away! To think that when those foxes had nowhere to go, I took them in and gave them a home! I even taught Tertia to sew – I shared everything I had with them. And in return they wanted to keep you all to themselves!’ Lian comforted her, telling her exactly what had happened to him, but Clever was still resentful. ‘You must keep this a secret,’ urged Lian. ‘Auntie Hua made me promise I would tell no one.’ They were still talking when in came Auntie Hua, and the two of them jumped up in a great fluster. Auntie Hua stood there glowering at them. ‘Who opened the door?’ ‘I did,’ confessed Clever, with an awkward smile. Auntie Hua grew angrier and more voluble than ever. ‘But Auntie,’ retorted Clever smartly, ‘if what you said is true and he's not really a man, then what's all the fuss about!’ Tertia was most distressed to see the two of them at each other's throats and tried her utmost to mediate, eventually succeeding in bringing them round and restoring the peace. Clever had spoken some harsh words, but from now on she did her best to humour Tertia, while Auntie Hua for her part continued to keep a close eye on young Lian, depriving him of any chance to be alone with Clever. All they could do when they encountered each other was to exchange soulful glances. One day Auntie Hua said to Lian, ‘Now that both Tertia and Clever are your wives, it seems to me that you cannot go on living here for ever."

Gongye was sitting at night, and there were women coming and going under the lamp. At first, they said they were family wives, but before they even looked up and raised their eyes, they didn't know each other, and their faces were brilliant. She knew the fox in her heart, and she liked it, and when she called out to her, the woman stopped laughing and said, ""Jiansheng Jiaren, who is your maid?"" Zhu smiled and sat down to thank him. Then, with the money secret, for a long time as a good husband and wife. Suddenly, he said, ""The ruler's rank should be moved, and there will be another day."" He asked: When? ""Answered: ""At present. But the congratulators are at the door, and the hangers are at Lu, and they cannot be officials. Three days later, the retribution will arrive, and the next day, Mrs. Tai's obituary will be announced. The public is dismissed, and he wants to accompany him.

On the tenth day, they left.","The Fenzhou Fox Master Zhu was a Fenzhou magistrate, whose government office was overrun by foxes. As he sat there at night, a woman was going and coming beneath his lantern light. At first he thought she was his wife’s servant, so he didn’t look up at her; and when he did raise his eyes, he realized that he didn’t recognize her, though she looked quite beautiful. He knew in his heart that she was a fox, but he lusted for her nonetheless, and hastily called for her to come. She stopped with a smile, and said, “That stern sound’s meant for me, but who are you calling your maidservant?” Zhu laughed and stood up, dragging her over to sit with him, where he could apologize for his mistake. Then he made love to her, and for a long while they lived together happily as husband and wife. Suddenly one day, she said to him, “You’re going to have to give up your appointment—there isn’t much time.” “When must I do it?” he asked. “Right away,” she smiled. “There may be congratulations at your gates now, but there will be mourning in your village soon, so you can’t remain an official.” Three days later, he received an announcement that he should relinquish his appointment. The next day, he was given news of his mother’s death. Zhu resigned his post, desiring that the fox accompany him to his hometown. But his fox wife couldn’t agree to do so. She accompanied him to the river’s edge. There he tried to force her aboard the ferry with him. The girl told him, “You wouldn’t know this, but foxes can’t cross rivers.” Zhu couldn’t bear to be apart from her, and expressed his love for her there at the river bank. The girl suddenly rushed off, saying she had to visit an old friend. After a bit she returned, and now she had a man with her, returning the visit she’d just made. The girl uttered something to her guest. Once he’d left, the fox came back to Zhu, saying, “Please climb aboard the ferry at your convenience—I’ll be joining you for the crossing.” Zhu replied, “According to your own words, you can’t make the crossing, so why are you saying this now?” “The one who just paid us a visit is the river god,” explained the fox wife. “I used you as the rationale for making a special request of him. He gave me permission to cross the river within the next ten days, so I can accompany you and stay with you for that long.” Then they crossed the river together. On the tenth day, consequently, she said farewell and left. 75.","There were a large number of fox-spirits in the residence of Judge Zhu, the Assistant Magistrate of Fenzhou. One night, when he was sitting alone, he saw a young lady pacing to and fro in the lamplight. At first he took her to be the wife of one of his servants and did not pay her much attention. But when he finally looked up at her, he saw that she was a woman unknown to him, and of the rarest beauty. He knew instinctively that she must be a fox-spirit and, finding himself greatly attracted to her, he ordered her to come over to him. She ceased her pacing. ‘You speak to me so harshly, sir,’ she said with a smile. ‘I am not your servant!’ Zhu rose smiling to his feet, drew her down gently to sit by his side and apologized for his brusqueness. They soon became lovers, and with time grew to be as devoted to one another as husband and wife. One day, she said to the Judge out of the blue, ‘You will soon be promoted to a new post. The day of our parting is at hand.’ ‘When will that be?’ asked Zhu. ‘Any day now. But even as men come to your door to congratulate you, others will arrive in the alley to offer their condolences, and you will be prevented from taking up the new post.’ Three days later, he indeed received notification of his promotion; and the day after, this was followed by news of his mother's death. He was obliged to resign his post in order to observe the three-year mourning period, and planned to return to his family home in the company of the fox. But she refused to go. ‘We can board the boat now.’ She saw him off as far as the river, where he begged her to board the boat with him. ‘Surely you know that a fox cannot cross the river,’ she said. Zhu could not bear to part with her and lingered there on the riverbank, loth to see her go. Then somewhat abruptly she took her leave, saying that she needed to call on an old friend. She returned shortly afterwards, and presently a stranger appeared who said he wished to speak with her, and she took him aside into a little building. When the man had left, she came to Zhu and said, ‘We can board the boat now. I shall accompany you across the river.’ ‘But only a moment ago you said you could not cross the water. What has happened to change things?’ ‘The man I went to call on just now is none other than the River God. I pleaded with him especially for your sake, and he has given me a dispensation for ten days. I must be back within that time. So I can stay with you a little longer.’ And so they crossed the river together. Ten days later, she made her final farewell and departed."
異史氏曰：“鄉有士人，偕二友於途，遙見少婦控驢出其前，戲而吟曰：‘有美人兮！’顧二友曰：‘驅之！’相與笑騁，俄追及，乃其子婦，心赧氣喪，默不複語。友偽爲不知也者，評騭殊褻。士人忸怩，吃吃而言曰：‘此長男婦也。’各隱笑而罷。輕薄者往往自侮，良可笑也。至於眯目失明，又鬼神之慘報矣。芙蓉城主不知何神，豈菩薩現身耶？然小郎君生辟門戶，鬼神雖惡，亦何嚐不許人自新哉！”,"Mr. Yi Shi said: ""There are scholars in the town who are on the road with two friends. In the distance, when they see a young woman controlling a donkey to get out of the way, they play and chant: 'There is a beautiful woman!' Gu Eryou said: 'Drive her away!' Russia chased him and was his son and wife. He was so frustrated that he kept silent. Friends and fakes were those who didn’t know what to do, and criticized them as blasphemous. Scholars were embarrassed, and they said: 'This is a man and a woman.' Forget it. The frivolous people often insult themselves, which is good and ridiculous. As for the blindness of the eyes, the ghosts and gods will pay tragically. The Lord of Furong City does not know who the gods are, how can the Bodhisattva appear? People are new!""","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “In a rural area there was a scholar who, along with two friends, was out on the road when in the distance he saw a young woman riding a donkey in front of them, so he jokingly taunted, ‘That’s a beauty there!’ “He turned back and said to his two friends, ‘Let’s catch up with her!’ “They laughed with each other and rode on, soon catching up with the lady. When they did, the scholar saw that she was his own daughter-in-law. Feeling himself blushing and ashamed, he fell silent and had no more to say. The scholar’s friends pretended not to know her and commented on the woman in very vulgar terms. “The seemingly bashful scholar stammered as he spoke these words: ‘She’s my eldest son’s wife.’ Each of the other men concealed a snicker and dropped the matter. “Being flippant usually turns into an act of self-insult that’s really self-ridicule. In terms of the dirt that got into Fang’s eyes and caused him to lose his sight, that’s just the vindictiveness of ghosts and supernatural beings. We don’t know which god the Lord of the Hibiscus may be. Is it another physical appearance of a bodhisattva? Yet even if ghosts and supernatural beings are sometimes wicked, they still give people a chance to correct their errors and to make a fresh start.” 6.","From that day forth, he was a great deal more circumspect in his behaviour, and acquired an impeccable reputation in the district. 6 THE PAINTED WALL Meng Longtan, a gentleman of Jiangxi Province, was staying in Peking with his friend the Provincial Graduate Zhu. One day, they went to visit a monastery together – not a particularly spacious establishment, with a modest hall of worship and a number of cells for Zen meditation. There was a single elderly monk in residence, who, seeing the visitors arrive, smartened himself up, went out to greet them and took them on a tour of the precincts.

Those who hear it doubt it, I believe it deeply. A beautiful girl with one heart is the soul on the pillow; a good friend from a thousand miles still knows the road in a dream. The heart and the liver; the flowing water and the mountains, the one who leads the life of my Cao! Oh, what a coincidence! In the adversity of the time, the encounter is not coincidental. The whereabouts are falling, and the shadow is always sad; If you live frequently in Kang, your beard and hair will be ugly; if you fall outside Sun Shan, the article will be flawed everywhere. People who cry bitterly in ancient and modern times are Bian and Wei Er; Huai, who has been out of character for three years, looks sideways, and has no home in the world. In life, one only needs to close his eyes and walk around to listen to the lowness of creation. There are many people in the world who have fallen like leaves, Gu Ander ordered When the power comes back, life and death follow it? Hey!""","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “Is it possible that a man could follow his closest friend even after he’s already died, and not realize the fact of his death? Although someone hearing Ye’s story might doubt this, I am firmly convinced of it. At heart, it’s the same as the story of Qian Niang, whose soul left her body behind, resting on a pillow, to following her lover; though 1,000 li separated the good friends, it seems that they could stay connected through the roads in their dreams. “Naturally, for scholars, their compositions and hand-written drafts are their most cherished treasures. Whether these are truly excellent or not, they constitute the heart and life of a scholar! That’s just the way it is! “It’s hard to know when you’ll meet someone who’ll appreciate you or when you’ll experience good fortune on the way to achieving official fame. Often a scholar faces his own shadow with a sigh, alone with the fact of his lack of success. He wants to stand straight and proud despite his skinny figure, for only he knows what emotions he has felt. He sighs about his shabby appearance when snobbish officials and wicked persons come to tease him. If he fails in his examinations time after time, others will regard every white hair on his head to be ugly. If he fails to become the top examinee, his compositions will be criticized unceasingly. “Among the people past and present who have had ample reason to weep, Ye was just like Bian He. When the white is mixed with the black, who then can serve as the Bole? Nowadays no one cherishes intelligent people, so there’s no use expecting your mind to amount to anything. Look around yourself, there’s no place to settle down. In this life, there’s no need for a man to be serious and clear-minded all the time. You just close your eyes and walk your own way. Let heaven dispose of everything. “There are a lot of people in the world like Scholar Ye. But how can they find a friend like Ding, who’ll follow them regardless of life and death? Alas!” 32.","32 KARMIC DEBTS A prominent mandarin named Wang Xianqian, of Xincheng, had a steward who was very comfortably off.

Dark and no lights, only the smell of fat and wine, filling the four blocks. As the east is white, it is easy to come out. While probing his sleeves, Jin Jue is still there. When they reach the door, the students will be waiting first, and those who are suspected of going out at night and entering early. The Duke showed it. The public asked, and sued. Think together that this thing is not owned by Han Shi, but believes in it.","After some time, all was quiet inside and out, so Yin stood up. It was dark since there weren’t any lamps lit, but the smell of cosmetics, perfumes, and wine still filled every portion of the room. He looked to see that in the east it was just getting light, then calmly took off, checking in his sleeve to be sure the gold cup was still there. When he reached the entrance, his friends were already present. The students had arrived early to wait, suspicious that he might have left the house at night in order to reenter it in the morning. Yin took out the golden cup to show them. The group, astonished, interrogated him, so he gave them an account of what had happened. They all agreed that this cup was something no impoverished scholar could afford, so they believed him.","After a while, when all was still within and without, Yin rose from the table. The lamps had all been extinguished and it was dark, but the aroma of the food and the fumes of wine still lingered in the hall. As he made his way slowly out of the building, and felt inside his sleeve for the golden goblet, which was still safely hidden, the first light of dawn glimmered in the eastern sky. He reached the entrance of the estate to find his friends still waiting outside. They had stayed there all night, in case he should try to trick them by coming out and going back in again early in the morning. He took the goblet from his sleeve and showed it to them. In utter amazement they asked him how he had come by it, whereupon he told them the whole story. They knew how poor he was, and that he was most unlikely to have owned such a valuable object himself, and so were obliged to believe him."

清明前一日，偶步郊郭。見一小車，朱茀繡幰，青衣數輩款段以從。内一婢乘小駟，容光絕美。稍稍近覘之，見車幔洞開，内坐二八女郎，紅妝豔麗，尤生平所未睹。目炫神奪，瞻戀弗舍，或先或後，從馳數里。忽聞女郎呼婢近車側，曰：“爲我垂簾下。何處風狂兒郎，頻來窺瞻！”婢乃下簾，怒顧生曰：“此芙蓉城七郎子新婦歸寧，非同田舍娘子，放教秀才胡覷！”言已，掬轍土颺生。,"The day before the Qingming Festival, I walked to the suburban Guo. When I saw a small car, Zhu Fu embroidered the embroidery, and Tsing Yi was fashioned for several generations. A maid rides on a small sister, and her face is beautiful. When I approached him a little, I saw that the car curtain was open, and there were twenty-eight girls sitting inside, with bright red makeup, which I had never seen in my life. Dazzling and dazzling, looking in love with Fosher, either first or later, galloping for miles. Suddenly I heard that the maid called the maid to the side of the car and said, ""Drape the curtain for me. Where is the wind and the mad boy, come to peep frequently!"" Madam, let the teaching and the talented people look foolishly!"" Having said that, the rut was raised.","On the day before the Qingming festival, he was walking outside the city by chance when he spotted a small carriage with bright red curtains and an embroidered canopy; a number of servant girls followed at a fairly slow pace. Among them, one servant girl, riding a small horse, was radiantly beautiful. Approaching slightly for a better look, Fang found the carriage curtains open, and inside sat a sixteen-year-old lady in stunning red attire, more exquisite than anyone he had ever seen. His eyes were dazzled, his heart ravished, and he was unable to look away from her—so sometimes from in front and sometimes from behind , he followed at a gallop for quite a number of li. Suddenly he heard the lady ask a servant girl to come near the carriage, saying, “Let down the curtain for me. Where does this crazy young man who keeps peeping at me come from?” So the servant girl drew down the curtain and looked at him angrily, saying, “This is the recent bride of the Seventh Lord of the Hibiscus, making a visit to her parents, not some female country bumpkin that a xiucai can outrageously stare at!” With these words, she grabbed some loose dirt from a wheel rut and threw it at him.","The day before the Qing Ming Festival, he happened to be out strolling in the countryside when he saw a small carriage pass by, with red curtains and embroidered blinds. It was followed by a train of servants and horses, including one particular maid on a pony, who struck Fang as being very good-looking. He went closer to get a better view of the girl on the pony and, as he did so, noticed through the slightly parted curtains of the carriage a young lady, about sixteen years old, gorgeously attired and of a beauty such as he had never witnessed in his life. He gazed at her dumbfounded, rooted to the spot, and then proceeded to keep up with the carriage for several miles, now walking slightly ahead, now trailing behind. Finally he heard the young lady command her maid to come to the side of her carriage. ‘Let down the blinds, girl! Who does that wild young man think he is, the one who keeps ogling me in that insolent fashion!’ The maid let down the blinds and spoke angrily to Fang. ‘My lady is the bride of the seventh young lord of Hibiscus Town, and she is on her way to visit her parents. She is no village lass for the likes of you to gawp at!’ So saying, she took a pinch of dust from the ground by the carriage wheel and threw it in his face."

After living there for several years, every time he came to the suburbs for festivals, he left every ten days before the suburbs, and returned after the suburbs. The priest questioned. Weng said, ""I can't go against the two of you. I can tell you the truth. I'm a fox. When the suburban season arrives, the gods will be pure and filthy.","The Magistrate of the Heavenly and Mortal Worlds At a Daoist temple named Chaotian, there was a Daoist priest who was fond of practicing the traditional method of breathing. There was also an old man who lived temporarily in the temple till he found that he had the same hobby as the priest, so they became good friends. The old man ended up living there for several years, and on each memorial day honoring people’s ancestors, he would leave ten days early, and then come back once the memorial activities were concluded. The Daoist priest became curious and asked him about his reason for doing so. The old man replied, “We two have no secrets from each other, so I can tell you honestly: I’m really a fox. When memorial day arrives, all sorts of gods come out to clean away evil things.","A certain Taoist priest who lived in the Chaotian Temple was an adept of the old breathing-yoga known as tu-na, ‘breathing in the new, and breathing out the old’. An old gentleman also lodged in the same temple, and since the two of them shared the same interest in self-cultivation, they had become firm friends. The old man, who had lived there for several years, always went away ten days before the seasonal ceremonies to Heaven and Earth were due to be performed, and never returned until they were over. His regular absences puzzled the Taoist, and one day he asked him for an explanation. ‘There should be no secrets between friends such as ourselves,’ said the old man, ‘so I will tell you the truth. I am a fox-spirit. When they hold those big ceremonies, unclean spirits like foxes are all exorcized."

Bu Ren sees the man from a distance, but he can't see it at a glance. Or he said: ""It's all shading, and the blood of a dog can be broken."" As he said, he went on alert. Bu people are hidden as before. In a hurry, the dog's blood was fertile, but when he saw the head and face of the people, the dog's blood was blurred, and his eyes were shining like a ghost. It is to pay you and kill him.","The next day, he told everyone he knew to join him in paying a visit to the fortune-teller’s place of business. From a distance the fortune-teller saw Master Yu, who was looking his way—but saw nothing there. “That’s his magic to fool the eye,” somebody said, “but dog’s blood ruins it.” Master Yu followed this advice, working covertly to prepare it, and then he came back. The fortune-teller disappeared like before. Yu quickly poured the dog’s blood on the place where he’d been standing, revealing the fortune-teller’s head and face, dripping with blood, his eyes burning there like a ghost’s. Then he was handed over to the authorities and executed.","The next day, he told the story to all his friends, and some of them went with him to the fortune-teller's house. But the man had seen them coming, and had vanished into thin air. ‘He is using a spell of invisibility,’ said one of Yu's friends. ‘But we can break it with dog's blood.’ Yu went again, armed this time with the blood of a dog, and when the fortune-teller vanished just as before, Yu acted quickly, smearing the dog's blood on the ground where the man had been standing. He saw him now, standing there, his head and face smeared with the dog's blood, his eyes blazing like those of some fearsome monster. They seized him and hauled him before the Magistrate, who had him put to death."

Looking at the bottom of the pillow, although the flowers are withered, it is not easy to carve off. Blame Wu for not coming, and folded the card to recruit him, but Wu Zhituo refused to recruit. Students are angry, and they are not happy. Concerned about his return to illness, the mother was anxious to discuss the marriage, and she had a little discussion with him. Wu Zhi has no consumption, and Yi resents it. If you think about it for thirty miles, why should you rely on others? In Huaimei's sleeves, she is full of anger, but her family doesn't know it. Walking alone, I have no way to ask, but I look forward to the Nanshan Mountain. About thirty li, the chaotic mountains close together, the sky is green and the muscles are clear, no one walks, and there are only bird trails. Looking at the bottom of the valley, among the flowers and trees, there is a faint drop. When I went down the mountain and entered the village, I saw that there were not many houses, all of which were thatched huts, and the meaning was very refined. To the north, there are silk willows in front of the door, peaches and apricots are particularly numerous in the walls, bamboos are built in between, and wild birds are placed in them. It is the garden pavilion that I do not dare to enter. Looking back at the opposite household, there are boulders that are slippery and clean, and have less rest because of sitting. Russia heard a woman inside the wall shouting, ""Xiao Rong!"" Her voice was delicate. While listening to the party, a girl moved from east to west, holding an apricot flower and bowing her head to the hairpin. Examining it, that is, what happened on the way to Shangyuan. The heart is suddenly happy, but there is no way to progress. If you want to call my aunt, Gu never goes back, afraid of corruption. There is no one to ask in the door, sitting and lying lingering, from the morning to the sun, full of hope, and forgetting hunger and thirst. When I saw a woman showing half of her face to peep, she seemed surprised that she would not go. Suddenly an old woman came out with her stick, and Gu Sheng said, ""Where is your majesty, I heard that you have been here since the dawn of time, until now. What is your intention? Don't you get hungry?"" Visiting relatives."" She was deaf and could not hear. Again. Nai asked, ""What's your family's surname?"" Sheng couldn't answer. The old woman smiled and said: ""It's amazing! I don't know the name, how can I visit my relatives? I think that the prince is also a bookworm. It's better to come from me, have a rough look, and have a short couch at home. When the Ming Dynasty returns, ask If you know the surname, come visit again."" Sheng Fang was devastated and pondered, and since then he has gradually approached the beauty and was overjoyed. Entering from the old woman, you can see the white stone road inside the door, and the red flowers fall on the steps, twisting and turning to the west, and opening another pass, the bean shed is full of flower stands in the courtyard. When the guests entered the house, the pink wall was as bright as a mirror, and the branches of the begonia outside the window reached into the room and borrowed a few couch, which was unclean. As soon as they sat down, someone peeked out of the window. The woman called out, ""Xiao Rong! You can quickly make millet."" A maid groaned and responded. Seating times, with Zhanzong valve. The old woman said, ""The grandfather of Langjun, don't you have the surname Wu?"" She said, ""Of course."" The old woman was shocked and said, ""It's my nephew! Then I went to Yin and asked about Infarction. My nephew has grown up like this, and I don’t know each other yet.” Sheng said: “This is my aunt, and I forgot my surname in a hurry.” I said, “I am old and have a surname of Qin. For the concubine. The mother changed the ritual, and left me to be raised. It is not dull, but the lessons are less, and I do not know the sorrow. After a while, the envoy will come to pay acquaintances."" After the concubine persuaded the meal, the maid came to collect the utensils. The old woman said, ""Call Ning Gu."" The maid should go. For a long time, I heard laughter outside. The old woman called again, ""Yingning, your auntie is here."" Outside, he sneered. The maid pushed him in and kept her mouth shut, smiling uncontrollably. The old woman raised her eyes and said, ""There is a guest here, what's the scene like?"" The female forbearance stood up with a smile, and she grinned at him. The old woman said: ""This prince, your sister-in-law. The family doesn't know each other, so it's ridiculous."" Sheng asked, ""How old is the sister?"" The old woman couldn't understand; The woman smiled again, not looking up. The old woman said to Sheng: ""I said little teaching, this can be seen. I am already sixteen years old, and I am as stupid as a baby."" Sheng said: ""I am less than one year old."" Are you a horse?"" The life head responded. He asked again, ""Who is your nephew?"" The answer was: ""No."" He said, ""If your nephew is talented and handsome, why is she still not hired at seventeen? Suspicious."" Sheng was speechless, staring at Yingning, not to mention his moment. The maid whispered to the little girl: ""The eyes are burning and the thief's voice has not changed!"" The girl laughed again, and the maid said, ""Is the peach blossoming?"" She abruptly stood up, covered her mouth with her sleeves, and stepped out. Outside the door, laughter begins. The widow also got up, called the maid to be quilted, and settled for a living. He said, ""My nephew is not easy to come by, so it's better to stay for three or five days and send you back. If you find it depressing, there is a small garden behind the house for recreation and books to read."" Mu, fine grass covered with felt, Yanghua grits path. There are three sycamores in the grass house, and the flowers and trees are all in one place. Chuanhua took a small step, heard the sound of Susu at the top of the tree, and looked up, Yingning was above, and when she saw the birth, she laughed wildly. Sheng said: ""Don't you, you're falling!"" The woman went down and laughed, unable to stop herself. Fang will reach the ground, miss and fall, the laughter stops. Health supports it, Yin squeezes its wrists. The girl laughed again and again, leaning against the tree could not do it, it took a long time to stop. As soon as he laughed and stopped, he showed it with flowers in his sleeves. The woman picked it up and said, ""It's dry! Why keep it?"" She said, ""This is what the upper sister of Yuan left, so I keep it."" She asked, ""What's the benefit of keeping it?"" She said, ""It shows that you love each other and don't forget. When Yuan met, he became ill after contemplating, and he differentiated himself into a foreign body; he did not want to see the color, and I was fortunate to have pity."" The woman said, ""This is such a big and small matter, why should I cherish it? When the husband goes, the flowers in the garden should be called. The old slave is here, and I will fold a huge bundle and give it to me."" Sheng said, ""Is your sister crazy?"" The girl said, ""Why are you crazy?"" She said: ""Jiaji's love, what is there to say about love?"" Sheng said: ""What I do is love, not the love of relationship, but the love of husband and wife."" The daughter said, ""Is there any difference?"" She said, ""I sleep together at night. ""The woman bowed her head and thought for a long time, and said, ""I'm not used to sleeping with strangers."" Before she finished speaking, the maid sneaked up and fled away in fear. When I was young, I met my mother's place, and my mother asked, ""Where are you going?"" The old woman said: ""The rice has been cooked for a long time, so what is the long talk, Zhou Zhenaier."" The woman said: ""Big brother wants me to sleep together."" The woman stopped smiling. Fortunately, I didn't hear it, and I still scrutinized it. Sheng was anxious to cover it up with his words, and blamed the girl for small words. The girl said, ""Isn't it appropriate to say this?"" Sheng said, ""This is a rebuke to other people's language."" The girl said, ""How can you betray your mother when you carry others? It's a common thing to do in bed, why is it taboo?"" Sheng hated her stupidity. , incomprehensible.","Hence Wang began drinking and eating again, getting better gradually, each day bringing him closer to recovery. When he looked under his pillow, he found the plum blossoms had dried up, though the petals hadn’t dropped off. He took pleasure from concentrating while holding them, imagining he could almost see her. He thought it strange that Wu hadn’t come back, so he sent a note inviting him to visit. Wu put him off by claiming that he had a prior invitation to honor. Wang was indignant, and became depressed. His mother was afraid that his illness would return, so she anxiously discussed the possibility of another marriage; this strategy was unproductive as Wang simply shook his head, unwilling to talk about it, and spent his days waiting for Wu. All the while, Wu sent no report of his efforts, merely increasing Wang’s anger. He began thinking about those thirty li— that wasn’t so far, was it? Why wait for news from someone else? Stowing the plum blossoms inside his sleeve, he went off in a huff by himself, without his family knowing anything about it. Traveling alone, with no one around to give him directions, Wang nevertheless made a beeline for the southern hills. After covering about thirty li, he found himself disoriented, with mountains on all sides, but awed and energized by the landscape’s lush greenery, till finally he came across a precipitous path. Looking into the distance, at the bottom of a valley he saw a thicket of flowers and trees, and he could just barely make out a small village nestled there. Coming down from the mountain, he entered the village, noticing that while there weren’t very many huts, each had a thatched roof that was, in Wang’s opinion, of sophisticated construction. One hut faced north, with willow trees in front of its gate, while inside its wall, peach and apricot trees were in full blossom, alternating with pruned bamboo; he heard wild birds singing there. Figuring this for a family garden, he didn’t dare just barge in. When he turned to go, opposite the entrance he found a gigantic stone, smooth and clean, so he decided to sit down and take a little rest. Instantly from the other side of the wall he heard a girl calling, “Xiaorong,” her voice lovely and delicate. As he sat there listening, he noticed a girl walking back and forth, holding an apricot blossom, who lowered her head to fix it in her hair. When she raised her head and saw Wang, she didn’t fasten it with her hairpin, but instead picked up the blossom and ran laughing with it into the garden. Carefully scrutinizing her, Wang realized it was the girl he’d encountered in the road during the Lantern Festival. His heart was filled with joy. But he couldn’t think of a rationale for entering; he longed to cry out his aunt’s name, but they’d never been introduced and he feared he might be misconstrued as some swindler. There was no one nearby he could question, either. Restlessly sitting, reclining, and pacing back and forth, he watched until late in the day, waiting expectantly, forgetting both hunger and thirst. From time to time, he spotted the girl’s profile when she’d sneak a glance at him, as though surprised that he hadn’t left. Suddenly, an old woman who walked out supporting herself with a stick, turned to look at Wang and asked, “Where is it you live, since I hear that you got here this morning and you’re still here now? What is it you’re after? Aren’t you feeling hungry?” Wang nervously stood up and bowed respectfully, replying, “I’m here to look for my relatives.” The old woman, who was rather deaf, didn’t hear him. He repeated his words more loudly. Then she asked, “What’s their family name?” Wang was stuck for an answer. The old woman laughed, “That’s pretty strange! If you don’t know their family name, how can you hope to find these relatives? By looking at you, I’d guess you’re a bookworm, too. Come on, follow me in—you can eat a little something and there’s a modest bed you can sleep in. Tomorrow you can head home, find out the family name, and then come back here.” Wang’s stomach rumbled at the thought of eating, and besides, accepting would bring him closer to the beauty, so he gladly agreed. Following the old woman inside the gate, he saw a walkway paved with white stones and lined by red flowers whose petals had fallen across the path’s steps; winding to the west, they came to another entryway, where bean trellises and flower frames filled a courtyard. Wang respectfully entered the hut, with its flour-white walls as bright as mirrors; outside the window, a great many wild plum branches were in flower, some of them extending into the room; the mats, stools, and bed were all clean and fresh. As soon as Wang sat down, he felt that there was someone outside the window spying on him. The old woman called out, “Xiaorong! Go fix some millet quickly.” From outside, the maid answered in a high voice. As he sat there, Wang laid out the details of his family tree. The old woman asked him, “Was your mother’s grandfather by any chance named Wu?” He replied, “He was, indeed.” Amazed, the old woman declared, “You’re my nephew! Your mother is my younger sister. For years now, our family has been poor, and since we also have no son, we lost all contact with your family. Nephew, you’re all grown up, yet we’ve never met for me to get to know you.” “I came here to find my aunt,” said Wang. “In all my anxiety, I forgot your name.” The old woman explained, “My family name is Qin, but I never gave birth to a child; my adopted daughter, Yingning, was the daughter of a concubine. When her mother remarried, she was left behind for me to raise. While she’s certainly no simpleton, she’s received little proper teaching, so she’s always having fun and never worrying about anything. In just a bit, I’ll send for her to come and meet you.” Not much later, the maid served a meal of tender chicken, with plenty to accompany it. The old woman encouraged Wang to eat his fill, and afterwards the maid cleared away the dishes. The old woman instructed her, “Tell your mistress, Ning, to come here.” The maid answered affirmatively and left to do so. After a good long while, they heard the sound of muffled laughter outside the door. The old woman called out, “Yingning, your cousin’s here.” The giggling and laughter outside the door didn’t stop. The maid pushed her into the room, Yingning still covering her mouth since she couldn’t stop her laughter. The old woman gave her a stern look and said, “We have a guest here; is this any way to behave, with derisive snickering?” The girl restrained her laughter and stood still while Wang bowed respectfully to her. The old woman explained, “This is Master Wang, your aunt’s son. We’re part of the same family, yet we’ve never met each other—now that’s enough to make a person laugh.” Wang asked, “How old is my cousin?” The old woman didn’t catch his question. Wang voiced it a second time. The girl started laughing again so hard that she couldn’t even raise her head up. The old woman said to Wang, “I told you she’s had little by way of teachings and admonitions, as you can readily see. She’s sixteen years old and as foolish in judgment as a baby.” Wang noted, “One year younger than I am.” She replied, “If you’re seventeen, weren’t you born in the Year of the Horse?” Wang nodded in response. She asked again, “Who is your wife?” “There isn’t one,” he answered. “Someone with your talent and looks,” she said, “how can you be seventeen and still unmarried? Yingning isn’t betrothed yet either, and the two of you would be well matched; it’s a pity that your being close relatives makes it unlikely.” Wang was speechless, not taking his eyes off Yingning even to blink. The maid turned to the girl and whispered, “His eyes are still blazing—the thief hasn’t changed his tune!” Yingning burst into laughter again, turned to the maid and said, “Shouldn’t we check to see if the peach blossoms have opened?” She quickly got up, covering her mouth with her sleeve, and with tiny, quick steps, hurried away. Once she was outside the gate, she let loose her laughter. The old woman also got up and called for the maid to prepare a bed so Wang could spend the night. She told him, “It wasn’t easy for you to get here, so it’s only right you should stay for a few days and relax, then we’ll send you home. If you grow tired or bored with the quiet, there’s a garden behind the hut, with various ways there for you to pass the time; or there are books you can read.” The next day, Wang went out behind the hut and found a garden there about half a mu in size, along with a ground cover of grass as soft as felt, plus tree blossoms and catkins; there were three thatched huts in a row, with flowers and trees on all sides of each. As he walked through the flowers, he heard a rustling sound from a treetop, and glancing up, he saw Yingning there. When she saw Wang appear, she laughed so hard she almost fell down. Wang cried, “Don’t do that, you’ll fall!” The girl climbed down, laughing all the way, unable to stop herself. Just as she was about to reach the ground, she almost lost hold and fell down, her laughter finally coming to a halt. Wang helped her up, taking advantage of the moment to fondle her wrist. This started Yingning laughing again until she had to lean against a tree for support, unable to go on, and it was a good long while before she could stop. Wang waited for her to finish laughing, then took the plum blossoms from his sleeve to show her. Yingning accepted them from him and exclaimed, “They’re all dried up. Why keep them?” He answered, “During the Lantern Festival, cousin, you left them behind—that’s why I’ve kept them.” “If they’re not fresh, what’s the point?” she asked. Wang explained, “To show my love, and that I’d never forget you. Since we first met, I’ve thought about you so much that I became ill, and it caused so much turmoil inside me that I almost died, faced with the possibility of never seeing your face again; I hope you’ll take pity on me.” “It’s no big deal,” Yingning said. “For a relative, what price is too great to pay? When the time comes for you to go, I’ll call on an old servant to pick a big bunch of flowers from the garden so you can take them with you.” “Are you crazy?” Wang demanded. She asked, “What’s crazy about that?” Wang explained, “It’s not the flowers I care about, but the person who was holding them.” “Naturally, since relatives love each other,” said Yingning. Wang said, “I’m not talking about the love between relatives, but between a husband and wife.” “There’s a difference?” Yingning wondered. “At night, they sleep together,” he explained. Yingning bowed her head and thought about this for a very long time before remarking, “I’m not accustomed to sleeping with strangers.” Before her words were finished, the maid quietly appeared and Wang fled in embarrassment. A little later, they met back at the old woman’s place. She asked them, “Where’d you go?” Yingning replied that they’d been in the garden, talking together. The old woman said, “The meal’s been ready for a long time—you spoke to each other for so long, there must have been plenty to cover.” Yingning said, “Elder brother wants to sleep with me.” She’d barely spoken the words when Wang, horribly embarrassed, anxiously gave her a silencing glance. Yingning giggled and said no more. Fortunately, the old woman hadn’t heard, so she kept on chattering, pursuing her questions. Wang swiftly spoke up to gloss over the comment, then whispered a rebuke to Yingning. She asked, “Isn’t it proper I should mention it?” Wang told her, “It’s the kind of thing you only say behind a person’s back.” “Behind someone else’s back, maybe,” said Yingning, “but surely not behind my aged mother’s back. Everybody has to sleep somewhere , that’s always the case— so what’s there to avoid?” Wang was frustrated with her naïveté, since he was unable with his attempts to make her understand. Just as they finished eating, a member of Wang ’s","Wang now began to eat and drink quite normally, and within a matter of days was quite restored to health. Frequently he reached beneath his pillow for the plum-blossom, which was withered but otherwise unchanged, held it in his hand and gazed at it in rapture, as if the blossom itself was his beloved. Days went by, and when Wu still did not return, Wang began to wonder what was going on. He wrote to his cousin several times, pleading with him to come. Each time Wu procrastinated, giving one pretext or another, which filled Wang with resentment, then provoked him to bouts of anger and depression. His mother was afraid that he might suffer a relapse, but when she suggested to him that perhaps he should consider marrying someone else, he shook his head, rejecting the idea out of hand and continuing to wait day after day for his cousin to return. Then, one day, he finally said to himself that ten miles was really not such a very great distance after all, that he needed no one's help to go that far, and placing the plum-blossom in his sleeve, he set off impulsively, without even informing his own family. He walked alone, encountering no one on the road from whom he could ask the way. All he knew was that he should head for the hills to the south-west. After walking for ten miles or so, he found himself climbing into an enchanted landscape, range upon range of green hills stretching as far as the eye could see, with not a soul in sight and nothing but a tiny, steep mountain trail to follow. As he continued on his way, far away down in the valley below, hidden in an overgrown tangle of flowers and trees, he caught sight of a little hamlet. He clambered down the hillside towards it and found a few simple buildings, nothing more than a cluster of rustic thatched cottages, but nonetheless a place with a certain refinement and charm. Before one of the cottages, situated towards the northern end of the hamlet, was a stand of weeping willows, while inside the cottage's garden walls could be seen a flourishing orchard of peach and apricot, interspersed with delicate fronds of bamboo. Birds sang in the branches. As this was clearly a private garden, Wang did not venture in but sat down for a moment's rest on a smooth boulder outside the house opposite. Presently he heard a girl's voice from within the garden calling out, ‘Petal! Are you coming or not?’ It was a delicate voice, tender and vibrant with feeling. As he sat there listening, a young girl walked out of the gate in the wall opposite and began strolling along the road, with a sprig of apricot-blossom in her hand. She lowered her head to fasten it in her hair, but, chancing to look up and catch sight of him sitting there, she ceased what she was doing, smiled and went back inside with the blossom still in her hand. Wang recognized her at once as the girl he had seen at the Lantern Festival, and his heart leaped with joy. But what pretext could he find for entering her home? And how should he address her? As his cousin? They had never met before, and he was afraid of offending her in some way. There was no one at the door that he could speak to, so he remained where he was, waiting restlessly, now sitting on the stone, now lying down beside it, until the sun had sunk low in the western sky. He quite forgot to think whether he was hungry or thirsty, so desperate was he for another glimpse of the girl. Every now and then she peeped out through the door and seemed greatly surprised to find him still there. Then finally an old woman emerged, leaning on a stick, and addressed him. ‘Where are you from, sir? I understand you have been here ever since morning. I wonder what you want. You must be hungry.’ He rose promptly to his feet and bowed. ‘I was hoping to call on my relations.’ The old woman was extremely deaf, and he had to repeat himself much more loudly before she understood him. ‘And what are they called, these relations of yours?’ she asked. He was unable to reply to this question. ‘Strange!’ replied the old woman with a smile. ‘ You say you were hoping to call on them, but you don’t even know their names! I’d say by the look of you that you must be a bit absent-minded, a bookworm, a dreamer… Come on in with me. Eat some of our poor fare. We’ve a little spare bed you can sleep in. Tomorrow you can go home and find out what these relations of yours are called. Then you can come back another time and do things properly.’ Wang was just becoming aware of the pangs of hunger, and besides, this invitation to dinner was his perfect entrée into the precincts of the fair one! Without further delay he followed the old woman, and found himself walking through the gate and down a little white cobbled path, lined with trees, whose deep pink blossoms lay scattered on the stones. He was in a transport of delight. The path then wound its way to the left and through another gateway, into a courtyard embellished with flower-covered trellises and exquisite potted plants on stands. Wang was invited inside, into a room whose brilliantly painted white walls shone with the dazzling brightness of a mirror. A branch of flowering crab-apple reached through a window from the courtyard outside. Cushions, tables, couch – everything in the room was spotlessly clean. As he sat down, he became aware that someone was stealing a glance at him through the window. ‘Petal!’ called the old woman. ‘ Put some millet on to cook at once!’ A maid's voice answered from outside. Wang told the old woman a bit about his family. ‘So your mother's father was a Wu, then?’ said the old woman. ‘Indeed he was.’ ‘Why then, you must be my nephew!’ she exclaimed in amazement. ‘Your mother must be my younger sister! Over the years, our branch of the family has come down in the world, I’m afraid, and besides I never had a son of my own, so as a result we’ve quite lost touch with the rest of the family. Here you are, a fully grown man, my own nephew, and I didn’t even recognize you!’ ‘It must have been you I came to see, Auntie,’ said Wang, ‘but in my confusion I forgot your name.’ ‘I married into the Qin family,’ replied the old lady. ‘I’ve no children at all of my own. There's just a girl who was born to my late husband's concubine. When my husband, Mr Qin, died, the girl's mother, the concubine, remarried and left the girl here for me to bring up. She’s a bright cheerful child, but hasn’t had much schooling , I’m afraid. She's forever playing! I’ll call her in shortly, to come and pay you her respects.’ Presently the maid served dinner, the principal dish being a plump little home-grown fowl. The old woman kept helping him to more, and when he had finished eating, the maid came back to clear away the dishes. ‘Call in Miss Ning,’ said the old woman, and the maid hurried off to do her bidding. Shortly afterwards there was the sound of muffled laughter outside. ‘Yingning,’ called out the old woman, ‘a cousin of yours is here.’ More laughter and spluttering could be heard outside. Then the maid ushered in the young lady of the beaming smile, who was hiding her face with her hand and seemed quite incapable of staunching her ever-flowing stream of laughter. The old woman looked at her angrily. ‘We have a guest! What do you mean by all this silly noise?’ The girl managed a straight face for a moment, and Wang made her a bow. ‘This is young Mr Wang,’ said the old lady. ‘ He's your cousin, but we’ve never met before – isn’t that strange?’ ‘And how old is the young lady my cousin?’ asked Wang. The woman could not hear him, and Wang had to repeat the question, whereupon the girl started laughing again and looked down at the ground. ‘I told you she lacked breeding,’ commented the old woman. ‘Now you can see for yourself. She is sixteen years old but silly as a child.’ ‘So she is one year younger than I am,’ said Wang. ‘If you are seventeen,’ returned the old lady, ‘then you must have been born in the Year of the Horse.’ ‘I was.’ ‘And who is your wife?’ ‘I am single.’ ‘I’m surprised that a good-looking young man of seventeen like yourself, with all your accomplishments, should still be single. Our Yingning is single too. Why, the two of you would make an excellent couple! It's a pity that you are cousins.’ Wang said nothing but kept staring at Yingning: he had eyes for nothing else. The maid muttered to her young mistress, ‘It's those burning burglar's eyes again!’ At this Yingning burst out laughing loudly. ‘Come, let's go and look at the peach-blossom!’ she said. She rose at once and, hiding her mouth with her sleeve, made her way out with her maid, taking tiny little steps. Once outside the door, she immediately let out another of her loud laughs. The old lady now arose as well and gave orders for a second maid to prepare bedding and make sure the visitor was properly taken care of. ‘This is such a rare honour for us,’ she said. ‘You must stay here for a few days and then we’ll send you on your way home. If you are bored, there is a little garden at the back where you can take a walk, and there are books to read.’ The next day, he discovered the little garden – it was no more than a tenth of an acre, with a neat lawn, paths strewn with catkins and a three-roomed rustic summer-house, surrounded on all four sides with shrubs and flowers. He had walked a few paces through the flowers when he heard a whispering sound coming from up in one of the trees, looked up, and there was Yingning. When she saw him, she burst out laughing and it looked for a moment as if she might come tumbling down from the tree. ‘Take care!’ cried Wang. ‘You might fall!’ She clambered down from the tree, laughing uncontrollably all the while, and was almost on the ground when her hand slipped and she fell, which finally put a stop to her laughing. Wang helped her up, gently squeezing her wrist as he did so, whereupon she started laughing again at once and had to lean against the tree, incapable of further movement. Wang waited for her laughter to come to an end (which took quite some time), and then he produced the withered plum-blossom from his sleeve and showed it to her. She took it in her hands. ‘It's dead. Why have you kept it?’ ‘It is the blossom you dropped at the Lantern Festival,’ he replied. ‘That is why I kept it.’ ‘But what for?’ ‘As a keepsake. To show that I have always loved you, that I have never forgotten you. Since I saw you that day of the Lanterns, my longing for you has made me ill. It has reduced me to a shadow of my former self. I never thought I should have this chance to see you again. Take pity on me. Be kind.’ ‘Of course I’ll be kind, silly! Cousins are supposed to be kind, aren’t they? When you go, I shall tell one of the women to pick you a whole bundle of flowers from the garden.’ ‘Are you out of your mind?’ ‘What do you mean, out of my mind?’ ‘It's not the blossom I love. It's the person who held it in her hand.’ ‘We’re not even that closely related. How can you talk about loving me?’ ‘I don’t love you as a relation. I love you as a man loves a woman, as a husband loves a wife…’ ‘What difference is there?’ ‘Husband and wife share the same pillow and mat at night. They sleep together.’ Yingning lowered her head in thought for a while. ‘ I am certainly not used to sleeping with strange men.’ Imperceptibly, as she was speaking, her maid arrived, and Wang made a somewhat confused departure. A little later, they all met again in the old lady's presence. ‘And where have you been?’ she inquired. ‘Talking together in the garden,’ replied Yingning. ‘The meal's been ready a long while,’ said the old woman. ‘What can you have been so busy talking about that kept you so long?’ ‘Cousin Wang says he wants to sleep with me,’ she blurted out. Wang was acutely embarrassed by this and cast her a disapproving glance. She smiled back at him and said no more. Luckily the old lady had not caught her words, and as she persisted with her questions, Wang hastily diverted her attention and changed the subject, at the same time whispering to Yingning that she had been indiscreet. ‘Shouldn’t I have said what I just said?’ she protested. ‘Not in front of others. It's a secret.’ ‘I don’t have any secrets from Mother. And besides, where one chooses to sleep is not so special. There's no secret about that, surely?’"

濟陽祝村有祝翁者，年五十餘病卒，家人入室理缞绖，忽聞翁呼甚急。群奔集靈寢，則見翁已複活，群喜慰問。翁但謂媼曰：“我適去，拚不複還。行數里，轉思抛汝一副老皮骨在兒輩手，寒熱仰人，亦無複生趣，不如從我去。故複歸，欲偕爾同行也。”鹹以其新蘇妄語，殊未深信。翁又言之。媼雲：“如此亦善。但方生，如何使死？”翁揮之曰：“是不難。家中俗務，可速料理。”媼笑不去，翁又促之。乃出戶外，延數刻而入，绐之曰：“處置安妥矣。”翁命速妝，媼不去，翁催益急。媼不忍拂其意，遂裙妝以出，媳女皆匿笑。翁移首於枕，手拍令臥。媼曰：“子女皆在，雙雙挺臥，是何景象？”翁捶床曰：“並死有何可笑！”子女見翁躁急，共勸媼姑從其言。媼如言，並枕僵臥，家人又共笑之。俄時媼笑容忽斂，又漸而兩眸俱合，久之無聲，儼如睡去。眾始近視，則膚已冰而鼻無息矣。視翁亦然，始共驚怛。康熙二十一年，翁弟婦傭於畢刺史之家，言之甚悉。,"There was a man named Zhu Weng in Zhu Village, Jiyang, who died of illness in his 50s. His family came into the house to take care of things, and suddenly heard Weng's cry. The group rushed to gather the spiritual bed, and saw that Weng had been resurrected, and the group was happy to offer condolences. Weng Dan said to his wife, ""I'm going to go, but I can't get it back. After walking for a few miles, I turned to leave your old skin and bones in the hands of my younger generation, and I look up to people with cold and heat, and there is no interest in resurrection. It's better to go with me. Returning, I want to go with you."" Xian was not convinced by his Xinsu lie. Ong said again. The old woman said: ""It is also good. But how to make death?"" Weng Huizhi said: ""It is not difficult. The mundane tasks at home can be cooked quickly."" After going out, he entered after a few minutes, and said to him, ""It's safe to do so."" Weng ordered to make up quickly, but when the old woman did not go, Weng urged Yi to be in a hurry. The old woman couldn't bear to brush her thoughts, so she put on her dress and makeup, and her daughter-in-law all smiled. Weng moved his head to the pillow and clapped his hands to lie down. The old woman said: ""The children are all there, both of them are lying upright, what is the scene?"" Weng beat the bed and said, ""How ridiculous is it to die together!"" As she said, she slept on a stiff pillow, and her family laughed together. The Russian woman's smile faded suddenly, and her eyes gradually closed, and she was silent for a long time, as if she had fallen asleep. When people are short-sighted, their skin is frozen and their nose is breathless. Seeing Weng is also the same, and the total is startled. In the 21st year of Emperor Kangxi's reign, Weng Di's maid was in the house of Bi Shishi, and the words were very familiar.","In the Jiyang village of Zhu, there was an old man, also named Zhu, well over fifty years old, who became ill and died. His family members had just gone into the house to put on their mourning hats and robes when suddenly they heard the old man abruptly cry out. The bunch of them ran out and gathered around his body, where they saw that Zhu had returned to life. All of them, happy and relieved, asked him what had happened. Zhu, however, spoke only to his wife: “When I recently left, I determined not to return again. But once I’d traveled several li from here, I turned to the thought of having left you behind, elderly skin and bones placed in the hands of young relatives, forced to rely upon others and no longer able to lead a meaningful life, a poor alternative to following me and departing. For that reason, I’ve come to take you along on my journey.” Everyone attributed his words’ strangeness to the fact that he’d just revived, and hence didn’t take them seriously. Zhu repeated his words to her. His wife replied, “Such sentiments are very nice. But you’ve just come back to life, so how can you think about dying?” Zhu waved his hands and insisted, “It’s not difficult. Please finish arranging your affairs quickly, and come with me.” His wife laughed and made no move to leave. Zhu pressed her again. She didn’t want to go against his wishes, so she walked out the door and reentered about fifteen minutes later, trying to fool him by remarking, “I’ve taken care of settling everything.” Zhu ordered her to hurry up and put on her make-up. His wife didn’t react, so he urged her even more anxiously. She couldn’t bear to deny him what he wished, so she put on a skirt and some make-up, and then came out. The younger members of the family tried to conceal their giggling. Zhu laid his head on his pillow and clapped his hands for his wife to join him. “That’s completely weird,” his wife said, “having us lay together like a pair of corpses—is that what you want our young relatives to see?” Zhu beat the bed with his fists and cried, “How can you find death something to laugh about!” The younger family members saw that Zhu was quite impatient, so together they encouraged their auntie to go along with what he wanted. Zhu’s wife did as she was told, and laid stiffly next to him. The family members once again began snickering among themselves. Shortly afterward, they observed that the wife was no longer grinning, and gradually had closed both of her eyes, and for a long time there was no sound, just as though she’d fallen asleep. When the others drew close to take a look, they found her skin cold as ice, and determined she wasn’t breathing. They also examined Zhu, who was in the same condition, and then realized the horrible truth. This happened in the twenty-first year of the reign of Kangxi, and the wife of Zhu’s younger brother, who was working in the household of an official named Bi, told me all she knew about it. An official named Bi: Possibly Bi Jiyou (see Zhu 206n11), friend and employer of Pu Songling (Zeitlin 132).","In a village near Jiyang, there was a man by the name of Zhu who at the age of fifty or so fell ill and died. His family had come into the dead man's room and were busy adjusting their mourning clothes when suddenly they heard him call out, loud and clear, and hurried over to the bed. Discovering to their delighted astonishment that he was indeed alive, they asked him to tell them something about his experience, but the only person he wanted to speak to was his wife. ‘When I went, it never occurred to me to try and come back. But then, after a few miles, I kept thinking to myself: I’m leaving my wife behind! There’d be no joy left in life for an old body like you, having to depend on the children for everything, winter and summer, year in, year out. So I decided to come back and take you with me.’ At first they ignored this as the delirious raving of a man newly revived from the dead. But then he proceeded to repeat the exact same words. ‘That's all very well and fine,’ said his wife, ‘but you’ve only this minute come back to life. How will you manage to die a second time?’ He waved aside this objection. ‘That is not a problem. Just you go and see to any last-minute chores that need doing.’ At first she stood there motionless, smiling. Then she went out of the room, and returned a few minutes later. ‘I’ve seen to everything,’ she lied. ‘Now dress yourself properly,’ he said. At first she refused to do this, but when he grew impatient and urged her to hurry, she agreed to put on her best going-out gown, to humour him. All this time the ladies of the family were sniggering behind their hands. Zhu now lay down with his head on the pillow and commanded his wife to do likewise, tapping on the bed beside him with his hand. ‘Our children are all around us,’ she protested. ‘They will laugh at us if we lie down on the bed together like that in front of them.’ He thumped the bed. ‘Dying together is no laughing matter!’ he cried. Seeing that he was in earnest and growing angrier by the minute, the family urged the lady to gratify this whim of his. She rested her head on the pillow and lay there next to him, stiff as a corpse. The members of the family were just beginning to snigger again, when they saw the smile fade from her face and her eyes close. A long silence ensued, and they thought she must have fallen asleep. But when they went up closer, to their horror they discovered that her skin was stone-cold and that she was no longer breathing. Her husband was dead too. During the twenty-first year of the reign of Kangxi, I was given a detailed account of this event by the wife of old man Zhu's younger brother."

詰旦有蘭溪生擕一僕來候試，寓於東廂，至夜暴亡。足心有小孔，如錐刺者，細細有血出，俱莫知故。經宿一僕死，症亦如之。向晚燕生歸，寧質之，燕以爲魅。寧素抗直，頗不在意。宵分女子複至，謂寧曰：“妾閱人多矣，未有剛腸如君者。君誠聖賢，妾不敢欺。小倩，姓聶氏，十八夭殂，葬於寺側，被妖物威脅，曆役賤務，腆顏向人，實非所樂。今寺中無可殺者，恐當以夜叉來。”寧駭求計。女曰：“與燕生同室可免。”問：“何不惑燕生？”曰：“彼奇人也，固不敢近。”又問：“迷人若何？”曰：“狎昵我者，隱以錐刺其足，彼即茫若迷，因攝血以供妖飲。又惑以金，非金也，乃羅刹鬼骨，留之能截取人心肝。二者，凡以投時好耳。”寧感謝，問戒備之期，答以明宵。臨别泣曰：“妾堕玄海，求岸不得。郎君義氣幹雲，必能拔生救苦。倘肯囊妾朽骨，歸葬安宅，不啻再造。”寧毅然諾之。因問葬處，曰：“但記白楊之上，有烏巢者是也。”言已出門，紛然而滅。,"Jie Dan, Lan Xisheng brought a servant to wait for the test, and lived in the east wing, and died violently at night. There is a small hole in the center of the foot, such as a thorn, and there is blood coming out, all of which are incomprehensible. After the lodging and the death of a servant, the disease is the same. Xiang Wanyan was born and returned, rather than quality, Yan regarded it as a charm. Ning Su resisted and didn't care. When the woman returned at Xiaofen, she said to Ning, ""There are so many concubines, and there is no one who is as strong as a king. The king is sincere and sage, and the concubine dare not deceive him. Xiaoqian, surnamed Nie, died at the age of eighteen, and was buried at the side of the temple. , being threatened by monsters, doing low-ranking services in the past, and being shy to people, is really unpleasant. There is no one to kill in the temple today, and I am afraid that they should come with a yaksha."" Ning Hai asked for a plan. The woman said, ""You can avoid being in the same room with Yansheng."" She asked, ""Why don't you confuse Yansheng?"" She said, ""I'm a strange person, so I wouldn't dare to approach."" Then she asked, ""How charming is it?"" She said, ""Anyone who loves me is hidden. If you stab his feet with a cone, he will be lost and confused, because he sucks blood for the demon drink. And he uses gold, not gold, but Rakshasa ghost bones, which can intercept people's livers. Both of them are good ears when they are cast. ."" Ning thanked him, asked about the period of alertness, and answered tomorrow night. When he parted, he wept and said, ""My concubine fell into the mysterious sea, but I can't ask for the shore. Your lord is righteous, and he will definitely be able to save his life and save his suffering. If he is willing to bury his concubine's rotten bones and bury it in a house, it will be like rebuilding."" Ning resolutely promised it. Because he asked about the place of burial, he said, ""But remember that above the poplars, there are black nests."" Yan had already gone out, and they were all destroyed.","At daybreak, a scholar from Lanxi arrived with his servant to wait to take the examination, setting up quarters in the temple’s east side, and that same night he died suddenly. On the sole of his foot there was a small hole, as if it had been pierced by an awl, a tiny bit of blood seeping from it. No one there knew what to make of it. The next night, the servant also died, his symptoms the same as the scholar’s. Later that night, when Yan returned, Ning asked him about it, and Yan thought that evil spirits were responsible. Ning had always stood for the right, so this didn’t faze him. At midnight, the girl came back to see him, saying, “I’ve encountered many men, but none of them as uncompromising as you. You’re truly a sage, so I don’t dare deceive you. I’m Xiaoqian , my family name is Nie—I died when I was only eighteen, and was buried beside this monastery, where I’m constantly coerced by demons to carry out their foul demands. It’s actually not my own will to turn to people and seduce them. Now that there’s no one left in the monastery to be killed, I’m afraid the evil spirits will come to destroy you.” Horrified, Ning begged her to help him find a solution. The girl declared, “If you stay in Yan’s room, you can escape them.” He asked, “Why can’t they attack Yan?” “He’s one of those rare people,” she explained, “whom they don’t dare approach.” Then Ning inquired, “What do you do to the men who become infatuated with you?” “While he makes love to me,” Xiaoqian replied, “I secretly drill a hole in the sole of his foot, and then when he loses consciousness, I extract his blood for the demons to drink; sometimes I use gold—which isn’t really gold, but the bones of a luosha demon—and anyone who kept it would have his heart and liver cut out: these two tactics ordinarily work on everyone.” Ning was grateful for the information. He asked when he should prepare himself for their coming, and she told him they would come the following night. As she was about to leave, Xiaoqian began weeping and exclaimed, “I’m sinking into a bottomless sea, grasping for land where there isn’t any. Your righteous spirit towers above the clouds, so surely you can find a way to rescue me from my torments. If you’re willing to do this, collect my bones and then bury them in a quiet place—you’d be giving me more than a second life.” Ning pledged to do so for her. When he asked where she was buried, she replied, “Just remember that you’ll find me at the base of a white willow where there’s a crow’s nest.” With these words, she walked out the door and mysteriously vanished.","The next day, a man from the nearby town of Lanxi, who was up in Jinhua for the examinations, came to lodge in the east wing of the temple. In the middle of the night, his servant found him dead, with blood dribbling from a small wound in the sole of his foot. The wound resembled a hole made by an awl. There seemed no obvious explanation for his sudden death. And then the very next night, his servant died in exactly the same manner. The following evening, when his fellow-lodger Yan returned to the temple, Ning mentioned the two deaths and Yan commented that they seemed to him to be the work of evil spirits. Ning had always been a man of firm convictions and was not unduly disturbed by such strange goings-on. That night, the girl came to visit him again. ‘I’ve seen many men in my time,’ she said, ‘but never one as strong and unshakeable as you. You seem a saintly sort of person, and I can’t bring myself to lie to you any longer – I must tell you the truth about myself. My family name is Nie, and I have always been known as Little Beauty. I died when I was eighteen years old, and they buried my body just outside this temple. Then an evil spirit took control of me, and ever since he has been forcing me against my will to cast spells on men, to seduce them and do all sorts of shameful things with them. Now there is no one left in the temple to kill apart from you, and I am afraid that the spirit will come looking for you. He will take the form of a yaksha-demon.’ Brave though he was, Ning found this prospect somewhat daunting. He asked her what precautions he should take. ‘You must sleep in Mr Yan's room,’ she replied. ‘You will be safe there.’ ‘Why is he so special?’ ‘He is a strange one. Spirits don’t dare go near him.’ ‘Tell me something,’ he said. ‘Tell me how you set about bewitching men.’ ‘I do it in one of two ways,’ she replied. ‘Either a man agrees to make love to me, in which case I secretly prick him in the foot with an awl so that he falls unconscious and his blood can be drawn off for the evil spirit to drink. Or else I tempt him with a piece of gold, which is really not gold at all but the spirit-bone of a raksha-demon. Once he has taken the gold, I can use it to cut out his heart and liver. I use whichever method seems most likely to work at the time.’ Ning thanked her for confiding in him like this, and asked her at which times he should be specially on his guard, to which she replied that the following night would be a dangerous one for him. As she left him she wept. ‘I am sinking into a dark sea and cannot reach the further shore! But you are so strong! You are so bright and good , I know you can put an end to my pain. Take my bones back home with you, I beg you, and give them a decent burial. Set them at peace and bring me back to life!’ Ning gallantly agreed to her request and asked where he was to find her grave. ‘At the foot of the white poplar tree, in which a crow has made its nest.’ With these words she went out through the door and vanished into the night."
未幾賈人歸，就榻問訊。婦謾罵，視若仇。兒以狀對，翁驚，延醫藥之，婦瀉藥詬罵。潛以藥入湯水雜飲之，數日漸安。父子俱喜，一夜睡醒，失婦所在，父子又覓得於别室。由是複顛，不欲與夫同室處，向夕竟奔他室。挽之，罵益甚。翁無策，盡扃他扉。婦奔去，則門自辟，翁患之，驅禳備至，殊無少驗。,"Soon after the Jia people returned, they went to bed for questioning. Women abused, as if hatred. The son responded to him by his appearance, Weng was startled, he extended the medicine, and the woman was scolded by laxatives. Dive into the soup and drink with the medicine, and it will become more and more safe for a few days. The father and son were happy, and woke up one night, where the lost wife was, and the father and son were found in another room. Because of this, he didn't want to be in the same room with her husband, so Xiang Xi went to his room. To save it, to scold it. Weng was helpless, so he kept his door open. When the woman rushed to the door, the door opened by itself, and Weng was troubled by it.","Not long afterwards, the merchant returned home, rushed to his wife’s bed, and asked what had happened. The wife began insulting him, treating him like an enemy. The son then gave his account. The old man, horrified, sent for medicine for her. The wife, however, poured out the medicine, while berating and swearing at them. Secretly, they put the medicine into her soup and assorted beverages, so over the course of several days, she gradually settled down. The father and son were extremely pleased. One night they were sleeping when the old man woke up to find his wife missing; father and son went looking for her, and discovered her in another room. Henceforward. she was continually agitated, and the old man found her unwilling to be in the same room with him. As the evenings arrived, she inevitably fled from her room. When he tried to hold her back, she heaped even more abuse on him. The old man had no plan to offer, and hence he locked her in the room. But whenever his wife rushed to make her escape, the door opened all by itself.","Shortly after this, her husband the merchant returned. Concerned at the terrible state his wife was in, he sat by her bedside asking questions, but she merely reviled him and treated him like some mortal enemy. The boy told his father everything that had happened during his absence, and the merchant, greatly alarmed, sent at once for a doctor to treat his wife. But she only threw the medicines prescribed by the doctor on the ground, and continued to assail her husband with abuse. He secretly included some of the prescribed herbs in her daily soups and tisanes, and at last she began to show signs of recovery, much to the relief of father and son. Then one night they woke up in the middle of the night to find her gone. They looked for her everywhere, and finally found her again in another room of the house. As the days went by she became more and more deranged, absolutely refusing to be in the same room as her husband, and in the evenings going off on her own to her separate room. If they tried to prevent her, she became abusive. Her husband tried locking the room, but she made her way there nonetheless and the door opened for her of its own accord. The merchant was deeply disturbed by all of this, and arranged for more than one rite of exorcism to be performed, to no avail."
孫翁者，餘姻家清服之伯父也，素有膽。一日晝臥，仿佛有物登床，遂覺身搖搖如駕雲霧。竊意無乃魘狐耶？微窺之，物大如貓，黄毛而碧嘴，自足邊來。蠕蠕伏行，如恐翁寤。逡巡附體，着足足痿，着股股軟。甫及腹，翁驟起，按而捉之，握其項。物鳴急莫能脱。翁亟呼夫人以帶系其腰，乃執帶之兩端笑曰：“聞汝善化，今注目在此，看作如何化法。”言次，物忽縮其腹細如管，幾脱去。翁乃大愕，急力縛之，則又鼓其腹粗於碗，堅不可下！力稍懈，又縮之。翁恐其脱，命夫人急殺之。夫人張皇四顧，不知刀之所在，翁左顧示以處。比回首則帶在手如環然，物已渺矣。,"Sun Weng, the uncle of Qingfu of Yu's family, is known for his courage. One day lying down, as if something was on the bed, then I felt my body swaying like driving a cloud. Stealing intent is nothing but Nightmare Fox? At a glance, the thing is as big as a cat, with yellow hair and a blue mouth, coming from the edge of his feet. Creeping and walking, like a terrifying phoenix. Feeling possessed by the body, with a foot full of atrophy, the stock is soft. As soon as he reached his belly, Weng suddenly got up, pressed and caught it, holding it by the neck. Things can't take off in a hurry. Weng Ji called his wife to wear a belt around his waist, and he held the two ends of the belt with a smile and said, ""I heard that you are good at transforming, and now I pay attention to this, and see how to transform."" take off. Weng Nai was stunned, and hurriedly bound him, and his belly was thicker than a bowl, and he couldn't get down! Slightly slack off, then shrink again. Weng feared that he would escape, and ordered his wife to kill him. Madam Zhang Huang looked around, not knowing where the knife was, Weng Zuo showed it. Compared with looking back, it is like a ring in the hand, and the thing is already insignificant.","Old man Sun was an uncle on my wife’s side. It was widely known that Sun was a brave man. One day when he was taking a nap in the daytime, it seemed to him like something had climbed up on his bed, and he began to feel a sensation of his body rising as if it was sailing on a cloud. Is this some fox spirit teasing me? he wondered. He spied something as big as a cat, with yellow fur and a blue-green mouth, crawling towards him from near his feet. It crept slowly, being afraid of waking Sun. It wavered close to his body: one touch paralyzed his foot and leg, while the next made his thigh and hip go flaccid. Just as it reached for his stomach, Sun suddenly rose up, put his hands on it and caught it, grasping it by the nape of the neck. The thing made nervous yelps since it was unable to escape. Sun urgently shouted for his wife to strap her belt around its waist. Then as he held the belt by its two ends, Sun laughed, “I’ve heard about your skills at transformation. Now I’ll keep my eyes on you to see how your changes work.” Within seconds of his speaking, the fox suddenly drew in its stomach till it was as thin as a tube and almost managed to slip away. Sun was greatly stunned and with anxious strength bound it tighter till the fox puffed up its stomach round as a bowl, so firm that the belt couldn’t be tightened any further; as soon as Sun relaxed his force a bit, the fox drew in its stomach again. Sun, still worried about it escaping, quickly ordered his wife to kill it. His wife panicked, looking high and low, not knowing where his knife was. Sun jerked his head to indicate its location. When he looked back, the belt in his hands was just an empty loop and the fox had disappeared. 10.","There was an elderly gentleman named Sun, who was the paternal uncle of a relation of mine by marriage, Sun Qingfu. This old man was an individual of great natural courage. One day, he was taking a nap when he thought he saw something climb up on to his bed, and he began to experience a floating sensation in his body as if he were being carried aloft upon the clouds. Wondering secretly to himself if this was a case of fox-possession, he opened his eyes a slit and saw a creature the size of a cat, with yellow fur and a green mouth, working its way up from the end of the bed, wriggling along as if it was trying not to awaken him. Slowly it began clambering on to his body. It reached his feet, and they became numb; it reached his limbs, and they became limp. It was about to crawl on to his stomach when the old man managed to heave himself up and seize it tightly by the neck. The creature yelped frantically but was unable to free itself from his grip. Sun called out urgently to his wife to tie a sash around its middle. Then he pulled both ends of the sash. ‘I have heard how clever you foxes are at changing shape!’ he cried. ‘Now show me what you can do!’ No sooner had he spoken than the creature retracted its stomach, shrinking to the size of a bamboo tube and almost succeeding in getting free. In terror the old man tightened the sash with all his might, whereupon the creature puffed out its stomach again until it was bloated and rigid and the size of a large bowl. Sun loosened his grip slightly, and it shrank again. The old man feared that it would escape, and he told his wife to kill it at once. She looked around her in great consternation　for a knife, and the old man turned to the left to indicate where one was to be found. By the time he turned back, all that remained in his hand was the sash, hanging in an empty loop."
李聽雞鳴，彷徨别去。蓮以新瘥，尚須調攝，就食非計，因將戶外反關，偽示生歸，以絕交往，日夜守護之。李亦每夕必至，給奉殷勤，事蓮猶姊，蓮亦深憐愛之。居三月生健如初，李遂數夕不至；偶至，一望即去。相對時亦悒悒不樂。蓮常留與共寢，必不肯。生追出，提抱以歸，身輕若芻靈。女不得遁，遂着衣偃臥，踡其體不盈二尺。蓮益憐之，陰使生狎抱之，而撼搖亦不得醒。生睡去，覺而索之已杳。後十餘日更不複至。生懷思殊切，恒出履共弄。蓮曰：“窈娜如此，妾見猶憐，何況男子！”生曰：“昔日弄履則至，心固疑之，然終不料其鬼。今對履思容，實所愴惻。”因而泣下。,"Li listened to the cock crowing, hesitating and don't go. Lian has a new condition and still needs to be photographed, so she does not count on food, because she shuts down the outdoors, pretends to be alive, and protects her day and night by cutting off contacts. Li Yi will come every evening, and he will be attentive and serve Lian's sister, and Lian also loves her deeply. Living in March, he was as healthy as ever, but Li Sui did not arrive for several nights; It is also unhappy when it is relative. Lian often stayed and slept together, but never refused. The students chased them out, carried them back to return, and their body was as light as a mug. The woman could not escape, so she lay down in her clothes, and her body was not more than two feet tall. The lotus benefits and pitys him, the yin envoys hug him, and he can't wake up even when shaken. Health and sleep, sleep and cable has been lost. More than ten days later, it will not return. Sheng Huai thinks very carefully, and always goes out and performs a total of work. Lian said: ""My concubine is so pitiful when she sees it, let alone a man!"" Sheng said: ""In the past, when I got a shoe, I would come, and I was skeptical about it, but I didn't know its ghost. Now I feel really embarrassed about Lu Sirong."" So weep.","Li heard the rooster crowing, looked around anxiously, then disappeared. Lian stayed with the newly-revived Sang, to build up his health again, since he couldn’t yet feed himself; hence she kept the outside door bolted shut, to pretend that Sang had returned to his hometown, thus breaking off contact with others, and watched over him day and night. Li also came without fail every night, offering her own earnest care to him, and treating Lian like her elder sister. Lian reciprocated with sincere sympathy and fondness. Three months later, Sang was as good as new. Then, for several nights, Li didn’t come around, and even when she did come, she just took a quick look at them and left right away. Whenever the three faced each other, Li seemed quite unhappy, so Lian often asked her to stay with them and rest, but she never agreed to do so. Once Sang chased after her, and carried her back home in his arms, her body as light as one of the paper effigies burned to mourn the dead. She made no attempt to resist, laid down with her clothes on, and curled herself up tightly into a length less than two chi. Lian, filled with pity for her, discreetly asked Sang to make love to her, but though he nudged her, Li wouldn’t wake up. Finally Sang also fell asleep; when he awoke, she was gone from sight. After more than ten days, she still hadn’t returned. Sang was feeling particularly unsettled, constantly taking out her slipper and caressing it. Lian remarked, “Even I’ve taken a fancy to her—let alone how you, a man, must feel.” “In the past,” Sang replied, “when I toyed with this slipper, she’d come, and though I suspected it quite often, I still didn’t expect that she’d really be a ghost. Now, thinking about her as I hold her slipper, I feel terribly sad.” Then he commenced to weep.","cried Lotus Fragrance. Li heard the cock crow and, with some hesitation, departed, leaving Lotus Fragrance to stay and take care of Sang. He remained at home, still too weak to go to his neighbour's for meals, and Lotus Fragrance locked the door from the outside, thereby creating the impression that he had gone home, and deterring any would-be callers. Meanwhile she continued to wait on him day and night, assisted in this by Li, who came every evening and looked up to her now like an elder sister. Lotus Fragrance for her part grew more and more fond of Li. This ménage continued for three months, at the end of which time Sang was fully recovered. Then, for several evenings, there was no sign of Li. When she did finally appear, she stayed only a very short while, and from her face they could see that she was extremely downcast. Lotus Fragrance had often invited her to stay and share their bed, but she had always refused, and this evening was no exception. Later, when she took her leave, Sang went after her and carried her back in his arms, finding her as light as a straw burial-doll. She felt obliged to stay, and curled up on the bed as she was, fully clothed, occupying a space barely two feet long. Lotus Fragrance felt more affectionate towards her than ever, and secretly she urged Sang to embrace her. He tried to wake her, but in vain. Then he himself fell asleep. When he awoke, he reached for her but she had vanished. More than ten days passed by and still there was no sign of her. Sang missed her greatly, and often took out the slipper. Once he and Lotus Fragrance held it together. ‘What a delightful creature she is!’ said Lotus Fragrance. ‘I’ve grown strangely fond of her myself! It's little wonder that you came to love her so!’ ‘In the past,’ replied Sang, ‘she came to me whenever I touched the slipper. I used to wonder what it meant, but I could never imagine that she was a ghost. Now whenever I see the slipper I see her face. It makes me feel so dreadfully sad.’ He wept as he spoke."
家人持火奔集，則門閉如故，排窗入，見公狀，大駭。扶曳登床，始言其故。其驗之，則衾夾於寢門之隙。啟扉檢照，見有爪痕如箕，五指着處皆穿。,"When the family rushed to the gathering with fire, the door was closed as before, and the window was lined up to enter. Fuyu climbed into bed, and began to talk about the reason. After checking it, the quilt was sandwiched between the sleeping door. When I opened the door and checked the photo, I saw that there were claw marks like a dustpan, and the five fingers were all worn.","His family’s servants arrived with torches and found his door closed as it had been originally, so they pushed through his window and entered—for upon seeing the ravaged state of the room, they’d been utterly terrified. They helped Sun’s grandfather up onto the bed and he began to talk about what had happened. Together they checked around, finding the end of the large quilt squeezed into the crevice where the door closed. Opening the door and holding some lights up to examine it, they found that the quilt had been pockmarked like a sieve, and wherever the spirits’ five fingers had touched it, they’d slashed holes into it.","His servant came running with a lantern, and, finding the door locked, as it usually was during the night, he broke open the window and climbed in. Appalled at the state his master was in, he helped him back to bed and heard his tale. Afterwards they examined the room together and saw that the bedcover was still caught tight between the door and the door frame. As soon as they opened the door and the cover fell free, they saw great holes in the fabric, where the beast's claws had torn at it."
長清僧道行高潔，年七十餘猶健。一日顛僕不起，寺僧奔救，已圓寂矣。僧不自知死，魂飄去至河南界。河南有故紳子，率十餘騎按鷹獵兔。馬逸，墜斃。僧魂適值，翕然而合，遂漸蘇。廝僕環問之，張目曰：“胡至此！”眾扶歸。入門，則粉白黛綠者，紛集顧問。大駭曰：“我僧也，胡至此！”家人以爲妄，共提耳悟之。僧亦不自申解，但閉目不複有言。餉以脱粟則食，酒肉則拒。夜獨宿，不受妻妾奉。數日後，忽思少步。眾皆喜。既出少定，即有諸僕紛來，錢簿穀籍，雜請會計。公子托以病倦，悉謝絕之。惟問：“山東長清縣知之否？”共答：“知之。”曰：“我鬱無聊賴，欲往游矚，宜即治任。”眾謂：“新瘳，未應遠涉。”不聽，翼日遂發。,"The monks of Changqing were noble and pure, and they were still healthy at the age of seventy. One day he could not afford to serve, and the monks of the temple rushed to the rescue, and he passed away. The monk did not know he was dead, and his soul drifted to Henan. There was an old gentleman in Henan, who led more than ten horses to hunt eagles and rabbits. Ma Yi, fell to his death. The monk's soul was at the right value, but it was close to each other, and then gradually recovered. The servant asked him, and Zhang Mu said, ""Hu to this point!"" The crowd returned. At the beginning, those who are pink, white and dark green gather together for consultants. Dahe said, ""I'm a monk, so I'm here!"" The family thought it was a lie, and they all raised their ears to realize it. The monk also did not explain himself, but he closed his eyes and no longer spoke. If the pay is to cut off the millet, then the food will be eaten, and the wine and meat will be rejected. Sleep alone at night, not served by wives and concubines. After a few days, he thought and took a few steps. Everyone is happy. As soon as the Shaoding comes out, there are servants coming, all the money, the grain, and the accountants. The son asked him to be sick and tired, but he declined. However, he asked, ""Does Changqing County, Shandong know about it?"" They answered, ""I know it."" They said, ""I am bored and want to travel, so I should take care of it immediately."" The crowd said, ""I should not travel far. ""If you don't listen, Yi Ri then sends.","Though more than seventy years old, he was still quite healthy. One day he fell down and couldn’t get back up. The monastery’s other monks rushed over to help him, but he had already passed away. The old monk, however, didn’t realize he was dead, and so his soul began floating away until it finally reached Henan. It happened that the son of certain Henan gentry was riding at the head of more than ten mounted servants, who were carrying hawks for rabbit hunting. His horse suddenly broke away and threw him, killing the man. The monk’s soul passed by just about that time, and merged with the young man, who thereupon began to revive. The servants anxiously asked him how he felt. He opened his eyes wide, wondering, “How did this happen?” The group then helped him get home. Once he was inside the door, a frenzied crowd of powdered and painted ladies surrounded him, examining and asking about him. Greatly startled, he cried, “I’m a Buddhist monk! How did this happen?” His family members thought he’d gone crazy and together tried to bring him to his senses. The monk didn’t try to explain himself, simply shutting his eyes without answering them. If they brought him millet he would eat, but if it was wine or meat, he’d refuse. At night he slept alone, not accepting the favors of wives or concubines. Several days later, he suddenly decided to take a little walk. Everyone was cheered by this. As soon as he stepped out, however, a group of servants with financial account books immediately crowded around him, prevailing upon him to look them over. Using the excuse of being sick and tired, he managed to avoid dealing with them. He then asked the servants, “Do you know if there’s a Changqing county in Shandong?” “Certainly,” they all replied. “I’m depressed here with nothing to do,” he said, “so I’d like to take a trip. Assemble everything I’ll need at once.” They tried to tell him that since his condition had only recently improved, he shouldn’t try to deal with traveling to such a distant place. He wouldn’t hear of it, so they set out the next day.","He was over eighty years old but still hale and hearty. Then, one day, he fell to the ground and was unable to rise: the other monks came hurrying to his aid, but found him already lifeless. He had entered the state of nirvana. His soul meanwhile, unaware of his death, had gone drifting off to the south, to a place somewhere in the region of Henan Province. The son of a noble Henan family was out that very same day with ten or so of his retainers, hunting hares with falcons, when his horse bolted and the young man was thrown to the ground and instantly killed. The wandering soul of the old monk from Changqing happened to be passing close by and in that very instant entered into his body. The young man gradually began to show signs of recovering consciousness. His retainers gathered round him and inquired how he was. ‘What am I doing here?’ he asked, opening his eyes wide. They lifted him up and helped him home, where his womenfolk in their many-coloured silks greeted him and inquired after his well-being. ‘But I am a monk,’ he exclaimed in amazement. ‘What am I doing here?’ His family thought he must have taken leave of his senses and tried tweaking his ears to bring him round. The monk himself was quite unable to understand his own predicament, but resolved to close his eyes and say nothing further. At mealtimes he would eat nothing but coarse rice, and refused to touch meat and wine. At night he slept alone, rejecting the attentions of his wife and concubines. After a few days, he felt a sudden urge to go out for a stroll, to the delight of his family. The moment he stepped out of his room, his stewards thronged around him, with ledgers and accounts to be checked, but he told them he was still not feeling well and sent them all away. ‘Do you know the village of Changqing, in Shandong Province?’ he asked one of the household, who replied that he did. ‘I feel so cooped up and bored here,’ he said. ‘I should like to go to Changqing and take a look around. Have my things made ready at once.’ They all protested that he was only just on the mend and that such a long journey seemed inadvisable."

異史氏曰：“人死則魂散，其千里而不散者，性定故耳。餘於僧，不異之乎其再生，而異之乎其入紛華靡麗之鄉，而能絕人以逃世也。若眼睛一閃，而蘭麝熏心，有求死而不得者矣，況僧乎哉！”,"Shi Shi said: ""When a person dies, the soul is scattered, and those who do not disperse after a thousand miles have their nature fixed. The rest of the monks are not different from their rebirth, but the difference is that they enter the gorgeous and luxurious villages, and they can be destroyed. People can escape from the world. If the eyes flash, and Lan Mux's heart is haunted, there are people who want to die but can't, what a monk!""","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “When a person dies, the soul scatters, and though a thousand li apart from the body, it doesn’t just disperse if its owner was an individual of devout character. Concerning the monk, I’m not at all surprised that he returned to life again, though what is surprising to me is that he entered into a life of splendor and luxury and was unable to refuse or to escape from it. A single glance can bring about a seduction, or one can find a seduction impossible to achieve despite one’s most vigorous efforts—think where this leaves the monk!” 17.","They found a man of quiet dignity and sincerity, barely thirty years old but with the wisdom of a man fifty years his senior. 17 THE SNAKE-CHARMER"

兒自是日游廛肆間。一日見長鬣雜在人中。兒審之確，陰綴系之。漸與語，詰其里居，答言：“北村。”亦詢兒，兒偽雲：“山洞。”長鬣怪其洞居。兒笑曰：“我世居洞府，君固否耶？”其人益驚，便詰姓氏。兒曰：“我胡氏子。曾在何處，見君從兩郎，顧忘之耶？”其人熟審之，若信若疑。兒微啟下裳，少少露其假尾，曰：“我輩混蹟人中，但此物猶在，爲可恨耳。”其人問：“在市欲何爲？”兒曰：“父遣我沽。”其人亦以沽告。兒問：“沽未？”曰：“吾儕多貧，故常竊時多。”兒曰：“此役亦良苦，耽驚憂。”其人曰：“受主人遣，不得不爾。”因問：“主人伊誰？”曰：“即曩所見兩郎兄弟也。一私北郭王氏婦，一宿東村某翁家。翁家兒大惡，被斷尾，十日始瘥，今複往矣。”言已欲别，曰：“勿誤我事。”兒曰：“竊之難，不若沽之易。我先沽寄廊下，敬以相贈。我囊中尚有餘錢，不愁沽也。”其人愧無以報。兒曰：“我本同類，何靳些須？暇時，尚當與君痛飲耳。”遂與俱去，取酒授之，乃歸。,"The child is a day trip to the shop. One day see long mane mixed in people. The children's trial is true, and the yin is tied to it. Gradually speaking, he questioned his residence, and replied: ""Beicun."" He also asked the child, and the child falsely said: ""The cave."" The long mane blamed the cave. The son laughed and said, ""I live in the cave, is your lord solid?"" The son said: ""I am the son of the Hu family. Where have I been, and I saw that you were consecrated by Liang Lang, and I have forgotten about it?"" The son slightly lifted his clothes and showed his false tail, and said, ""My generation is among the people, but this thing is still there, which is hateful."" The man asked, ""What do you want to do in the city?"" I'm selling."" He also told him to sell. The son asked, ""Gu Wei?"" He said, ""My wife is very poor, so I often steal a lot of time."" The son said, ""This battle is also good and hard, and I am worried."" Because of the question: ""Who is the master Yi?"" Said: ""That is the two brothers and brothers I saw. One was the wife of the Wang family of Beiguo, and the other stayed at a Weng family in Dong Village. I'm going back now."" After saying goodbye, he said, ""Don't get me wrong."" My son said, ""It's harder to steal than it is to sell it. I'll sell it under the corridor first, and I'll give it to you. I still have more in my pocket. Money, don't worry about selling it."" The man was ashamed and had nothing in return. The son said, ""I'm of the same kind, why do you want to have some beards? In your spare time, you should still have a hard drink with your lord.""","For days, the son repeated this habit of wandering between shops. One day, he spotted the long-bearded man mingling in the crowd. The son scrupulously verified it was the same man, then covertly stayed close to him. Eventually, he actually spoke to him, asking him where he lived. The man answered, “North of the village.” He inquired the same of the boy, who lied, “In a burrow.” The long-bearded fellow allowed as how it was strange that he lived in a hole for his home. The son, laughing, exclaimed, “That burrow’s been our home for generations—and yours as well, right?” The man was alarmed by this, and flatly demanded to know his name. The boy replied, “I’m a son of the Hu family. Some time ago, I stopped at the He family’s garden, and there I saw you serving two gentlemen, so how could I forget you?” The man then carefully examined him, half believing and half doubting him. The boy proceeded to open his robe ever so minutely, little by little, until he revealed his purchased tail, and said, “We folk can pass ourselves off as humans except for our tails, which bring us unlimited resentment.” The man asked him, “So why’d you want to come to the marketplace?” “Father sent me to buy wine,” the son explained. The man told him that he, too, had come to buy wine. “So have you bought any or not?” asked the boy. “We folk are quite poor,” the man answered, “hence I usually steal it when I get the opportunity.” The son noted, “That kind of venture’s very hazardous, a risky exercise.” “I received my masters’ orders,” the man declared, “so I can’t disobey them.” “Just who are your masters?” the son asked him. The man explained, “What you saw were two brothers. The one’s been having intimate relations north of the village with a lady named Wang, the other’s been lodging east of the village with a certain old man’s family. The old man’s son is very cruel, and actually cut off enough of his tail that it took ten days to heal, but now he’s back at it like before.” When he finished speaking, he wanted to leave, explaining, “I don’t want to expose my intentions.” The son declared, “Stealing it’s hard, but buying it’s easy. I bought some earlier that I stored in the wine shop, and I’d respectfully like to offer it to you as a present. My bag still has some money in it, so it’s no problem for me to buy more.” The long-bearded man was so embarrassed, he didn’t know how he could repay the boy. The son reassured him, “We’re the same kind of folk, so why be stingy about such a little thing? When I get some time, I’ll come accept a hearty drink from you.”","From then on, he made a point of frequenting the market daily, until one day he spotted the long-bearded servant in the crowd. Marking him closely, he trailed him and eventually struck up a conversation with him, asking him where he was from. ‘North Village,’ was the man's reply. ‘ And yourself?’ ‘Oh, I’m from a cave in the hills,’ said the boy. Long Beard found his answer strange. ‘We’ve lived in a cave for generations,’ the boy continued. ‘Haven’t you too?’ Long Beard found this stranger still. He asked the boy his name. ‘Hu,’ he replied, which meant ‘Fox’. ‘Actually I was at the Ho garden the other day, and saw you with the other two. Don’t you remember?’ Long Beard studied him a moment. He was almost ready to believe him, but not quite. Then the boy half-unbuttoned the lower part of his gown, enough to reveal a portion of his false tail. ‘After all these years of living with men, I still can’t do anything about this!’ ‘What are you doing here in the market?’ ‘My father sent me here to buy some liquor.’ Long Beard replied that he had come for the same purpose. ‘And have you bought yours yet?’ asked the boy. ‘We are poor folk,’ he replied. ‘Usually I have to steal rather than buy.’ ‘That must be tricky,’ said the boy. ‘I’d be scared to steal.’ ‘My master sent me on this errand, so I have to go through with it,’ said Long Beard. ‘And who is your master?’ ‘I serve those two gentlemen you saw the other day. They are brothers. One of them is having an affair with the wife of a Mr Wang in North Village; the other is carrying on with the wife of an older man, a merchant from East Village. The merchant's son is a real villain! He chopped off part of my master's tail and it's taken all of ten days to heal. Today my master has plans to pay his lady friend another visit.’ With this, Long Beard took his leave. ‘I must go and see to my business.’ ‘Stealing must be so much trouble,’ objected the boy. ‘It's much easier to buy. I’ve already bought some liquor, as a matter of fact; I’ve got it laid by in the shop. Why don’t I make you a present of it? I still have some money left; I can easily buy myself some more.’ Long Beard protested that he would be unable to pay him back. ‘Come, we belong to the same kind. Think nothing of it. Sometime when you are free we must get together for a drink.’ They set off together. When they reached the shop, he gave Long Beard the liquor, and then went home."

The time is winding, fortunately the moon is dim and the door is recognizable. Mosuo counted in and arrived at the back building. On the moon platform, it was clean and lovely, and it stopped. Looking at the moon in the west, but the mountain is a line of ears. Sitting for a long time, it is no less different, snickering at the false rumors. Pillow the stone on the floor, lie down and watch the cow girl. One more to the end, in a trance. Downstairs there is a sound of walking up. When he pretended to look at him, he saw a man in Tsing Yi holding a lotus lantern, and suddenly he saw the man, and he retreated in shock. The descendants said, ""There is a living person here."" The next question asked, ""Who is it?"" The answer said, ""I don't know."" An old man from Russia came up, looked at him carefully, and said, ""This Yin Shangshu is already sound asleep. But when I do my business, Xianggong is suave, or I don't blame him."" Then Xiang led into the building, and the door of the building was completely opened. Time-shifting people benefit from the crowd. The lights upstairs are bright as day. The male turned slightly to the side to cough and sneeze. When Weng heard the Duke woke up, he got out of his knees and said, ""The villain has a broom girl, and I will return tonight. I don't mean to touch the nobles, so I hope you don't take any serious offense."" Congratulations."" Weng said, ""It is fortunate that the nobles have come to suppress the evil spirits. If you are bothered to sit with them, it will be more beneficial to your favor."" Gongxi, agreed. Entering the building, it is beautifully furnished. Then a woman went out to worship, and the year was over forty. Weng said: ""This is clumsy."" The Duke bowed to him. When Russia heard the roar of sheng music, someone rushed up and said, ""It's here!"" There is a bunch of gauze in the little room, and the groom is guided in. The year can be seventeen or eighteen, and the harvest is full of Shaoxiu. Weng Ming first greeted the distinguished guests as a courtesy. Juvenile Head. If the duke is a bridesmaid, he will perform half officiating ceremony. The son-in-law of the second Weng pays homage, already, it is an impromptu. Shaojian Fendai Yuncong, wine and mist, jade bowls and gold casseroles, shining a few cases. After a few drinks, Weng called the slave girl to invite the lady. The female slave promised to enter, but did not leave for a long time. Weng started, and Han urged him. The generation of Russian maids brought new people out, wearing the ring and wearing the blue, and the musk orchid. Weng Ming bowed to him. Get up, that is, sit on the female side. In the eyes, Cuifeng Mingjian, Ronghua is peerless. Then according to the Golden Jue, a large capacity and a few buckets. Gong Si thinks that this thing can be held to test fellow people, in the inner sleeve of the yin. Pseudo-drunk a few times, slumped to bed. They all said, ""Your Excellency is drunk."" Ju Wuhe, hearing the news of the bridegroom's departure, filled with riotous music and went downstairs one after another. But the master has collected wine utensils, and the little one can't find it. Or gossip about sleepers. Weng was anxious not to speak, lest the public hear it.","Upon entering, he noticed tall weeds obscuring the paths and dense growths of wormwood and mugwort. It was the time of the first quarter of the moon, which fortunately projected a dim yellow light, enabling him to distinguish the locations of doors. Feeling his way with his hands, he proceeded past several doors until he arrived at the furthest building. He stepped up to the moon-viewing platform, which was so bright and clean that he decided to stop right there. To the west he saw the moon shining, though it graced the hill with only a single thread of light. He sat there a long time, noticing nothing strange, laughing in secret at the ridiculous rumors that had been circulated. Putting his mat down on the platform and resting his head on a stone, he lay down to gaze at the Cowherd and the Weaving Maid. At nearly ten o’clock, as he was feeling drowsy and about to fall asleep, he heard the sound of someone walking around noisily in the building below, then coming upstairs. He surreptitiously peeked while pretending to be asleep, seeing a person in dark clothing carrying a lotus lantern, who suddenly noticed Yin with fright and quickly withdrew. This person said to someone standing behind him, “There’s a stranger here.” From below came the question, “Who is it?” “I don’t know,” he replied. Presently an old man came up, proceeded to take a good look at him, and said, “This is Master Yin, a governmental secretary, who’s fallen fast asleep. We can go about our business and since he’s an easy-going, unpretentious gentleman, he won’t make any trouble for us.” So they came in together and opened up all of the doors. In a little while, increasing crowds of people were bustling about. The buildings were illuminated by so many lamps that it looked like daytime. Yin rolled over on his side briefly, sneezed and coughed. The old man heard him wake up, came over to him and knelt, saying, “I have a daughter who’s getting married this very evening. Since I didn’t mean to offend you, your honor, I hope you won’t look too harshly on my disturbing you.” Yin stood up, helped the old man up, and replied, “I had no idea that such a joyous ceremony would be held tonight, and I’m ashamed I have no gift to offer in congratulations.” The old man said, “It’s our good fortune that your honor’s very presence here will drive away any evil spirits. If I could trouble you to come and participate with us, I’d feel doubly favored by your generosity.” Yin happily agreed to do so. Upon entering the building, he saw that it was exquisitely decorated. Then a woman, about forty years old or so, came out to pay her respects to him. The old man explained, “This is my wife.” Yin bowed respectfully to her, clasping his hands together. Instantly, they heard the sound of a sheng’s boisterous music, and someone rushed in, crying, “He’s here!” The old man hastened out to meet the arrival while Yin also stood up to wait for him. In a few minutes, a cluster of people carrying gauze-covered lanterns led in the bridegroom. He was seventeen or eighteen years old, graceful and handsome. The old man directed him first to pay respects to their wedding’s honorable guest. In deference, the young man looked over at Yin, who responded graciously with the manner of an attendant representing the host. Next the old man and the son-in-law exchanged bows, and once they were finished they took their seats. Soon some beautiful maidservants came to serve them with wine and steam-covered meat dishes, presented in jade bowls and golden cups, till the entire table was glowing. Once the wine had made several rounds, the old man sent one of the maids to usher in the bride. The girl then went into an inner room, but a long time passed while no one came out. The old man himself got up, drew back a curtain, and made a plea. Presently a number of maidservants and older women came out accompanying the bride, whose ornaments and jewelry tinkled, and whose perfumes gave off the fragrances of musk and orchid. The old man directed his daughter to face her elders and pay her respects to them, then he had her go over and sit beside her mother. Even a quick glance at her wearing her brilliant jade phoenix headdress revealed her to be a paragon of beauty. Not long afterwards, wine was poured into golden cups large enough to hold what seemed like several dou. Yin figured that something like this would provide effective proof to his fellows, so he secretly slipped one up inside his sleeve. Pretending to be drunk, he slumped over on the table, relaxed, and seemed to fall asleep. Everyone said, “Look, Master Yin’s drunk.” Soon the bridegroom wanted to take his leave, so the music suddenly struck up again, and one after another they all went downstairs and left. Once they were gone and the servants began collecting the wine cups, they found they were short one and carefully hunted for it without success. One privately suggested that perhaps the sleeping guest had taken it; the old man, however, anxiously warned them not to say so, for fear that Yin might hear.","And in he went. The paths were overgrown with long grass and tangled weeds. It was the first quarter of the month, and the crescent moon gave off just enough light for him to make out the gateways and doors. He groped his way forwards until he found himself standing before the building that stood at the rear of the main compound. He climbed on to the terrace and thought it seemed a delightful place to take a little nap. The slender arc of the moon shining in the western sky seemed to hold the hills in its mouth. He sat there a long while without observing anything unusual, and began to smile to himself at the foolish rumours about the place being haunted. Spreading his mat, and choosing a stone for a pillow, he lay there gazing up at the constellations of the Cowherd and the Spinning Maid in the night sky. By the end of the first watch, he was just beginning to doze off when he heard the patter of footsteps from below, and a servant-girl appeared, carrying a lotus-shaped lantern. The sight of Yin seemed to startle her and she made as if to flee, calling out to someone behind her, ‘There's a strange-looking man here!’ ‘Who is it?’ replied a voice. ‘I don’t know.’ Presently an old gentleman appeared and, approaching Yin, scrutinized him. ‘Why, that is the future President Yin! He is fast asleep. We can carry on as planned. He is a broad-minded fellow and will not take offence.’ The old man led the maid on into the building, where they threw open all the doors. After a while a great many guests started arriving, and the upper rooms were as brightly lit as if it had been broad daylight. Yin tossed and turned on the terrace where he lay. Then he sneezed. The old man, hearing that he was awake, came out and knelt down by his side. ‘My daughter, sir, is being given in marriage tonight. I had no idea that Your Excellency would be here, and crave your indulgence.’ Yin rose to his feet and made the old man do likewise. ‘I was not aware that a wedding was taking place tonight. I regret I have brought no gift with me.’ ‘Your very presence is gift enough,’ replied the old man graciously, ‘and will help to ward off noxious influences. Would you be so kind as to honour us further with your company now?’ Yin assented. Entering the building, he looked around him at the splendid feast that had been prepared. A woman of about forty, whom the old gentleman introduced as his wife, came out to welcome him, and Yin made her a bow. Then the sound of festive pipes was heard, and someone came rushing in, crying, ‘He has arrived!’ The old man hurried out to receive his future son-in-law, and Yin remained standing where he was in expectation. After a little while, a bevy of servants bearing gauze lanterns ushered in the groom, a handsome young man of seventeen or eighteen, of a most distinguished appearance and prepossessing bearing. The old gentleman bade him pay his respects to the guest of honour, and the young man turned to Yin, whom he took to be some sort of Master of Ceremonies, and bowed to him in the appropriate fashion. Then the old man and the groom exchanged formal courtesies, and when these were completed, they took their seats. Presently a throng of finely attired serving-maids came forward, with choice wines and steaming dishes of meat. Jade bowls and golden goblets glistened on the tables. When the wine had been round several times, the old gentleman dispatched one of the maids to summon the bride. The maid departed on her errand, but when she had been gone a long while and still there was no sign of his daughter, the old man himself eventually rose from his seat and, lifting the portière, went into the inner apartments to chivvy her along. At last several maids and serving-women ushered in the bride, to the sound of tinkling jade pendants, and the scent of musk and orchid wafted through the room. Obedient to her father's instructions, she curtseyed to the senior guests and then took her seat by her mother's side. Yin could see from a glance that beneath the kingfisher-feather ornaments she was a young woman of extraordinary beauty. They were drinking from large goblets of solid gold, each of which held well over a pint, and Yin thought to himself that one of these would be an ideal proof of his adventure that night. So he hid one in his sleeve, to show his friends on his return, then slumped across the table, pretending to have been overpowered by the wine. ‘His Excellency is drunk,’ they remarked. A little later, Yin heard the groom take his leave, and as the pipes started up again, all the guests began trooping downstairs. The old gentleman came to gather up his golden goblets, and noticed that one of them was missing. He searched for it to no avail. Someone suggested their sleeping guest as the culprit, but the old gentleman promptly bid him be silent, for fear that Yin might hear."
忽聞吉莫靴鏗鏗甚厲，縲鎖鏘然，鏇有紛囂騰辨之聲。女驚起，與朱竊窺，則見一金甲使者，黑面如漆，綰鎖挈槌，眾女環繞之。使者曰：“全未？”答言：“已全。”使者曰：“如有藏匿下界人即共出首，勿貽伊戚。”又同聲言：“無。”使者反身鶚顧，似將蒐匿。女大懼，面如死灰，張皇謂朱曰：“可急匿榻下。”乃啟壁上小扉，猝遁去。朱伏不敢少息。俄聞靴聲至房内，複出。未幾煩喧漸遠，心稍安；然戶外輒有往來語論者。朱局蹐既久，覺耳際蟬鳴，目中火出，景狀殆不可忍，惟靜聽以待女歸，竟不複憶身之何自來也。,"Suddenly, I heard Jimo's boots clattering loudly, the locks clattering, and there was a clamor of voices. The woman was startled, and Zhu stole a peek, and saw a golden-armored messenger with a black face like lacquer, with a lock and a mallet, surrounded by all the women. The messenger said, ""Not yet?"" The messenger replied, ""It is complete."" The messenger said, ""If there are people hiding in the lower realms, they will come out together, don't bother Yiqi."" They also said in the same voice, ""No."" will be searched. The woman was terrified and her face was ashen. Zhang Huang said to Zhu, ""You can hurry and hide on the bed."" He opened the small door on the wall and fled away suddenly. Zhu Fu did not dare to take a short rest. Hearing the sound of boots, Russia entered the room and made a comeback. Soon, the troubles and noises drifted away, and the heart was a little at ease; however, there were often talkers outside. Zhu Ju had been walking for a long time, and he felt cicadas ringing in his ears and fire in his eyes. The scene was unbearable, but he listened quietly and waited for the girl to return, but he no longer remembered the origin of his body.","Suddenly they heard the heavy clomping of boots and something like the clanging of chains; soon there was the vague clamor of arguing. Alarmed, the girl got up and they secretly peered out. They saw an emissary in soldier’s golden armor, his face black as lacquer, holding up chains in one hand and a hammer in the other, with the girls surrounding him. He demanded of them, “Is that everyone yet?” “That’s everyone,” they replied. Then the emissary said, “If you’re hiding someone from the world of mortals, you’d better make it known or you’ll be sorry about the consequences.” Again their voices insisted, “We’re not.” The emissary turned his mighty body around and scanned like a hawk hunting for something hidden. It seemed that he intended to conduct a search. The girl was terrified, her face pale as ashes, and in her fright she said to Zhu, “Hurry, you must hide under the bed.” Then she opened a tiny door in the wall and abruptly escaped through it. Zhu lay hidden, hardly daring to breathe. Presently he heard the sound of boots entering the room, then turning to walk back out. Not much later the noise receded into the distance and he began to feel more secure; however, there were still voices speaking as somebody came and went outside the door. After Zhu had been trapped like this for quite a while, his ears began to feel like a cicada was chirping in them, while his eyes felt inflamed. Though the situation was in danger of becoming unendurable, he tried to calm himself while listening and waiting for the girl to return; besides, in addition, he could no longer recollect how he’d come to be there.","Their raptures were, however, rudely interrupted by the clomping of boots, the clanking of chains, and a confused and raucous shouting outside. The fairy girl leaped up, and she and Zhu hurried to the door. Peeping through, they saw a guard standing there in full armour, with a face black as pitch, carrying chains and cudgels, and surrounded by a throng of maidens. ‘Are you all present?’ he barked. ‘All present!’ came the reply. ‘Are you quite sure one of you is not harbouring a man from the world below in here?’ cried the guard. ‘If so, bring him out this instant! Don’t go causing trouble for yourselves.’ ‘There's no one here!’ they all protested. The guard cast a piercing gaze around him, implying that he was about to search the place. Zhu's fairy went ashen pale. ‘Hurry!’ she whispered, turning breathlessly to her lover and trembling with fear. ‘ Hide under the bed!’ She herself opened a little side-door in the wall, through which she escaped, while Zhu took refuge beneath the bed, hardly daring to breath. The heavy boots came marching into the room, then left again, and as they stomped away into the distance, he heaved a sigh of relief. But he could still hear a great deal of coming and going and talking outside the door, and remained in a state of unbearable suspense, his eyes burning and his ears buzzing like crickets. He resigned himself to waiting quietly for his lady friend to return, barely remembering any more who he himself was or where he had come from in the first place."
術人受而纏諸腰，乃扣笥而呼曰：“八八兒，不出謝賞將何待？”忽一蓬頭童首抵笥蓋而出，望北稽首，則其子也。以其術奇，故至今猶記之。後聞白蓮教能爲此術，意此其苗裔耶？,"The artisan took it and wrapped his waist around him, then buckled his hood and shouted, ""Eighty-eight children, what will you do if you don't give thanks?"" Suddenly a bun-tou boy's head touched the hood and came out, looking at the head of Beiji, his son. Because of its magic, I still remember it to this day. Later, I heard that the White Lotus Sect can do this technique, do you mean it is the descendant?","The shocked officials sat there, stunned, and each one bestowed some gold on him. The conjurer received their gifts, wrapped them up and bound them around his waist, then rapped on his bamboo basket and shouted, “Beloved son, you should come out and give thanks for these gifts. What’re you waiting for?” Suddenly a boy with disheveled hair pushed up the lid of the basket with his head and bowed it in the direction of the officials—thus revealing himself to be the conjurer’s son. Such was that strange feat of magic, it still comes back to me in my memory. Afterwards I heard that the White Lotus Cult had the ability to practice such skills. Is it possible that the conjurer was one of their practicing descendants? 14.","When the father had received the money and put it in his belt, he rapped on the basket. ‘Babar!’ he called out. ‘Out you come now and thank the gentlemen! What are you waiting for?’ He had no sooner said this than there was a knock from within and a tousled head emerged from the basket. Out jumped the boy, and bowed to the dais. It was his son. To this very day I have never forgotten this extraordinary performance. I later learned that this ‘rope trick’ was a speciality of the White Lotus sect. Surely this man must have learned it from them."
異史氏曰：“夫人擁妻子，閉門科頭，何處得殺？即殺，亦何由族哉？狐之謀亦巧矣。而壤無其種者，雖溉不生；彼其殺狐之殘，方寸已有盜根，故狐得長其萌而施之報。今試執途人而告之曰：‘汝爲天子！’未有不駭而走者。明明導以族滅之爲，而猶樂聽之，妻子爲戮，又何足雲？然人聽匪言也，始聞之而怒，繼而疑，又既而信，迨至身名俱殞，而始悟其誤也，大率類此矣。,"The Yi Shi said: ""The madam holds his wife, and the head of the family is closed. Where can you kill it? Even if it is killed, why does it belong to the clan? The fox's remnant has already stolen its roots in Fangcun, so the fox has to grow its cuteness and give it as a reward. Now I try to pass the pass and tell people: 'You are the emperor!' Why, but I still like to hear it, my wife is killed, what is the point? However, when people hear what the bandits say, they get angry at first, then doubt it, then believe it, and then die until their body and name are all dead, and then they realize their mistake. , the rate is similar.","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “If husbands would just live with their wives and children happily, with the doors of their households closed, how could they ever kill anyone? And even if they could kill, why would they ever destroy an entire clan? The fox’s plan was quite ingenious. However, if there had been no evil thoughts in Li’s own mind, the plot wouldn’t have germinated, even with the old man trying to cultivate it; the man who killed the foxes was savage, and that shows that his heart already possessed evil roots, so the fox encouraged those roots to sprout and then conducted his plan of revenge. Now we can directly test passersby by saying to them, ‘You’re really an emperor!’ Henceforth, everybody will be shaken up, and run away. “Obviously, Li was guided towards the sacrifice of his entire family, but he was still happy to listen to the advice. Hence he can’t blame anyone else for his family being destroyed, can he? A man listens to insane comments and initially is angered by them, but if he becomes intrigued, he’ll continue to give credence to those suspicions until his life and reputation are both destroyed, and then he realizes that his own faults have led to the disaster ; this is the general rule of this kind of thing.”","Only then did Li understand that the Marshal was the old fox, taking his revenge for the destruction of his own fox-family."
廉從師讀。師偶他出，適門外有猴戲者，廉視之，廢學焉。度師將至而懼，遂亡去。離家數里，見一素衣女郎偕小婢出其前。女一回首，妖麗無比，蓮步蹇緩，廉趨過之。女回顧婢曰：“試問郎君，得無欲如瓊乎？”婢果呼問，廉詰其何爲，女曰：“倘之瓊也，有尺書一函，煩便道寄里門。老母在家，亦可爲東道主。”廉出本無定向，念浮海亦得，因諾之。女出書付婢，婢轉付生。問其姓名居里，雲：“華姓，居秦女村，去北郭三四里。”生附舟便去。至瓊州北郭，日已曛暮，問秦女村，迄無知者。望北行四五里，星月已燦，芳草迷目，曠無逆旅，窘甚。見道側墓，思欲傍墳棲止，大懼虎狼，因攀樹猱升，蹲踞其上。聽松聲謖謖，宵蟲哀奏，中心忐忑，悔至如燒。,"Lian reads from the teacher. When the teacher came out, there was a monkey opera outside the door, and he looked down on him honestly, and gave up his studies. When the master was approaching, he was afraid and died. A few miles away from home, I saw a girl in plain clothes and a little maid come out in front of her. As soon as the girl looked back, she was extremely beautiful, and the lotus walked slowly, and Lian hurried past her. The female looked back at the maid and said, ""Ask Langjun, is it like a beautiful woman who has no desires?"" The maid Guo asked, and Lian asked him what it was. At home, you can also be the host."" Lian Chu was originally undirected, and he was also able to read the floating sea, so he promised it. The female publishes the book and pays the maid, and the maid transfers the life. When asked about his name, Curie, he said, ""Hua surnamed, lives in Qinnv Village, and goes to Beiguo for three or four li."" Sheng Fuzhou went. When we arrived at the northern state of Qiongzhou, the sun was already twilight, and when I asked Qinnv Village, there were still ignorant people. Looking northward for four or five miles, the stars and the moon are already shining, the grass is fascinated, and there is no reverse travel, and I am very embarrassed. Seeing the tomb on the side of the Dao, I want to perch by the tomb, and I am afraid of tigers and wolves. Listening to the sound of pine suds and the mournful play of night insects, the center is uneasy, and the regret is like burning.","Lian meanwhile was studying with a teacher. When the teacher unexpectedly had to step out one day, it happened that a monkey show was playing just beyond their gate, and Lian went outside to watch, abandoning his studies. Upon reflecting that the teacher must be about to return, he became afraid of being punished, and ran off. Once he was several li from home, he saw a girl dressed in white, walking ahead of him, with a maidservant. The girl turned her head towards him, revealing that she was bewitchingly beautiful, beyond compare. She was walking slowly with her tiny feet, so Lian hurriedly walked past her. The girl turned to look at her maidservant, and said, “Why don’t you try to ask the gentleman whether he’ll be traveling to Hainan?” The maid servant then called out the question. Lian asked why she was wondering. “If you’re going to Hainan,” the girl replied, “there’s a letter I’d like to send home with you. My mother would be a grateful hostess.” When Lian originally ran off, he did so without a particular direction in mind, so he decided that crossing the sea might be the thing to do, and gave the girl his consent. She took out the letter and gave it to her maidservant, who in turn gave it to Lian. When he asked the girl for her name and home town, she replied, “My family name is Hua, and we live outside Qinnü village, three or four li from the northern part of Qiongzhou.” Lian then went aboard a boat and departed. The sun was already setting as he arrived in northern Qiongzhou. He asked about Qinnü village, but no one seemed to know of the place. Heading to the north, he walked four or five li, and though the moon and stars were shining brilliantly, the road was so overgrown with grass, and the place was so wild, that he couldn’t find an inn where he might rest. He felt completely bewildered. He noticed a tomb by the side of the road, so he thought he’d stop there to rest a bit, even though he was afraid that there might be tigers and wolves about. Consequently, he clambered up into a tree as nimbly as a monkey and settled onto a branch. He listened to the sounds of rustling in the tall pine trees, and to the chirping of insects in the night, which made him feel uneasy, so he regretted having impetuously agreed to come.","This, he would reflect wretchedly to himself, was his bitter but ineluctable fate. Lian studied at home with a tutor, who one day happened to go out and leave the schoolroom unattended. During his absence, a man passed by the door with a performing monkey and Lian hurried out to watch, quite forgetting his studies. When he thought of what he might have to face on his tutor's return, he grew scared and ran away. A few miles from home Lian caught sight of a young lady in a white dress ahead of him, accompanied by a maidservant. The lady turned to look at him and he saw at once that she was bewitchingly beautiful. She was hobbling along on her tiny bound feet, and he was soon able to catch up with her. ‘I should like to ask that young man,’ she said to her maid, ‘if by any chance he is on his way to Hainan Island, to the port of Qiongzhou.’ The maid hailed Lian, and he asked her what she wanted. ‘If you are going to Hainan Island,’ replied the young lady, her mistress, ‘to the port of Qiongzhou, I have a letter I would very much like you to take home for me. My mother will look after you when you get there.’ Young Lian had no particular destination in mind and was only too happy to take a trip out to sea, so he accepted the commission. The lady took out the letter and gave it to her maid, who handed it to Lian. He asked for the family name and address of her mistress. ‘The family name is Hua, and they live in Qin-nü Village, a mile or so to the north of Qiongzhou.’ So the young man took a boat for Hainan and, reaching the northern outskirts of Qiongzhou when it was already dusk, asked the way to Qin-nü Village. But no one seemed to know where the place was. He continued to walk on northwards another couple of miles into the night, the moon and the stars shining brightly overhead. All around him lay open country and lush fields bathed in the luminous moonlight. There was no sign of anything resembling an inn, and he was wondering with some concern how he was going to pass the night, when he spied a tomb by the roadside and resolved to take shelter beside it and rest a while. To put himself out of reach of prowling tigers and wolves (the very thought of these creatures filled him with terror), he climbed up into a tree like a monkey and crouched there, clinging to one of the branches. He could hear the wind soughing in the pines, and the plaintive chirping of nocturnal insects, and was beginning to feel thoroughly miserable and to regret that he had ever undertaken this foolhardy errand, when suddenly he heard a voice beneath the tree and, looking down, beheld, not a tomb, but a courtyard house complete in every detail."
時其兄居興福寺，因往探之。入門便聞其號痛聲。入室，見瘡生股間，膿血崩潰，掛足壁上，宛然冥司倒懸狀。駭問其故。曰：“掛之稍可，不則痛徹心腑。”張因告以所見。僧大駭，乃戒葷酒，虔誦經咒。半月尋愈。遂爲戒僧。,"When his brother lived in Xingfu Temple, he went to visit him. Hearing the sound of pain upon entry. When he entered the room, he saw sores in his thighs, pus and blood collapsed, hanging on the wall of his feet, as if he were hanging upside down. Horrified to ask why. Said: ""It's okay to hang it a little, otherwise the pain will penetrate the heart."" Zhang Yin told what he saw. The monk was greatly appalled, so he abstained from meat and alcohol, and recited the mantra. Healing in half a month. So he became a monk.","He left for his brother’s residence at Xingfu Monastery to find out what had happened. Upon entering the doorway, he could hear the sound of his brother howling in pain. Coming into his room, he could see a sore spot on his thigh which was oozing pus and blood— his leg, elevated, was hanging from the wall, reminiscent of its suspension in that place in the underworld. Astonished, Zhang asked him what was going on. He explained, “Suspending it helps; otherwise, the pain’s overwhelming.” Zhang informed his brother about what he’d seen in the underworld. The monk was so profoundly startled, he consequently gave up meat and alcohol and began piously chanting sutras. In half a month he began healing. Thereupon he became a completely sincere monk.","When Zhang regained consciousness, fearing that his brother must already be dead, he hurried off to the Xingfu Monastery, where he had been in residence. As he went in at the door, he heard a loud shrieking and, on proceeding to his brother's cell, found him upside down, just as he had seen him in Hell, with his legs tied up above him to the wall, and an abscess oozing blood and pus between his thighs. Appalled, he asked him for an explanation, and his brother told him that he was in terrible pain and that this was the only position in which the pain was at all bearable. Zhang now described what he had seen in Hell, and the monk was so terrified that he at once gave up drinking liquor and eating meat, and devoted himself humbly to the recitation of the sutras and mantras of his religion. In a fortnight he was well again, and became known ever afterwards as a most exemplary monk."
生眯目不可開。才一拭視，而車馬已渺。驚疑而返，覺目終不快，倩人啟瞼撥視，則睛上生小翳，經宿益劇，淚簌簌不得止；翳漸大，數日厚如錢；右睛起鏇螺。百藥無效，懊悶欲絕，頗思自懺悔。聞《光明經》能解厄，持一卷浼人教誦。初猶煩躁，久漸自安。旦晚無事，惟趺坐撚珠。持之一年，萬緣俱淨。,"Unable to open his eyes. Just a glance, and the horses and horses have disappeared. When I turned back in surprise, I felt unhappy at the end of my eyes, and when Qianren opened his eyelids and looked away, a small nebula appeared on his eyes. After the drama, the tears could not stop; the nebula grew bigger and thicker for a few days; The hundred medicines were ineffective, and he felt devastated and repented. Hearing the ""Guangming Sutra"" can relieve misfortune, and holding a scroll to teach and recite it. I was irritable at first, but gradually calmed down. There is nothing to do in the evening, just sit and twist beads. Hold it for one year, and everything will be clean.","It got in his eyes, so he couldn’t open them. Fang rubbed them in order to take another look, but found the carriage and horses nowhere to be seen. Surprised and bewildered, he returned home. He became aware that his eyes weren’t getting any better. He sent for someone who opened his eyelids, poking and examining them, and found a small, cloudy spot growing over each eyeball; through the night it became more severe, causing his eyes to water continually. The spot gradually built up and in a few days had become as thick as a coin. A kind of spiral pattern developed on the right eyeball, and no medicine proved effective for it. Annoyed and depressed, he wanted to put an end to himself until he began thinking about repenting his misdeeds. He’d heard that the “guangming sutra” would be able to resolve his distress. He got hold of a copy and asked a man to teach him to recite it. At first Fang had trouble because he was too impatient, but in time he became more calm. From dawn to dusk he did nothing but work at it, sitting cross-legged while fingering his beads. After having done this for a year, he achieved a state of absolute clarity.","Fang was momentarily blinded and could not even open his eyes. He rubbed them, and when finally he did succeed in opening them, carriage and horses, young lady and maid, had all vanished into thin air! He returned home in great perplexity of spirit, all the time aware of a continuing discomfort in his eyes. He asked a friend to lift up his eyelids and take a look inside, and the friend told him that there was a clearly visible film over each of his eyeballs. The next morning, the condition was still more pronounced and there was an unstoppable flow of tears from each eye. The film continued to thicken, and after a few days it was as thick as a copper coin. In addition, a spiral-shaped protuberance began growing from the right eye, which resisted any treatment. Fang was now totally blind, and his condition filled him with despair and remorse. Hearing that a Buddhist scripture, known as The Sutra of Light, had the power to cure ailments such as his, he acquired a copy and found a person to teach it to him so that he could recite it by heart. For a certain period of time, his physical discomfort and mental perplexity continued unabated, but after a while he began to find a certain peace of mind. Morning and evening, he sat cross-legged chanting the sutra and counting the beads of his rosary, and after a year of this he eventually succeeded in attaining a state of genuine detachment and serenity. Then one day, out of the blue, he heard a voice, quiet as a fly, coming from within his left eye."
〈祝翁〉,"""Zhu Weng""",Old Man Zhu,63  DYING TOGETHER
生躍起走謝，沉痼若失。而懸想容輝，苦不自已。自是廢卷癡坐，無複聊賴。公子已窺之，曰：“弟爲兄物色得一佳耦。”問：“何人？”曰：“亦弟眷屬。”生凝思良久，但雲：“勿須也！”面壁吟曰：“曾經滄海難爲水，除卻巫山不是雲。”公子會其旨，曰：“家君仰慕鴻才，常欲附爲婚姻。但止一少妹，齒太稚。有姨女阿松，年十八矣，頗不粗陋。如不見信，松姊日涉園亭，伺前廂可望見之。”生如其教，果見嬌娜偕麗人來，畫黛彎蛾，蓮鉤蹴鳳，與嬌娜相伯仲也。生大悦，求公子作伐。公子異日自内出，賀曰：“諧矣。”乃除别院，爲生成禮。是夕鼓吹闐咽，塵落漫飛，以望中仙人，忽同衾幄，遂疑廣寒宮殿，未必在雲霄矣。合卺之後，甚愜心懷,"Sheng jumped up and walked away, thanking him, and Shen was ashamed. And Xuan thinks of Rong Hui, and suffers for himself. It is a waste of time to sit in a daze, no more chatting. The son had already seen it, and said, ""My brother is looking for a good couple for my brother."" He asked, ""Who?"" Once the sea is difficult to become water, except Wushan is not a cloud."" The son met his decree and said: ""The lord admires Hongcai and often wants to marry. If you don’t see the letter, Sister Song will go to the garden pavilion, and you can see it in the front compartment.” Sheng is like her teaching, and when she sees Jiao Na come with a beautiful woman, she paints a curly moth, a lotus hook, a phoenix, and Jiao Na. Xiang Bozhong also. Give birth to great joy, and ask the son to attack. The young master came out from the inside the next day, and he said: ""Harmony."" It was on the eve of the day that he preached to swallow, and the dust fell and flew, so that the immortals in the eyes suddenly went to bed together, and then suspected that the Guanghan Palace might not be in the sky. After being married, I feel very comfortable","Kong jumped up and ran to thank her; it was as if his illness had vanished. But whenever he thought about her shining beauty, he couldn’t stop his pangs of longing. From then on, he ignored his books and sat around in a daze, as though he had nothing to live for. The young master, who’d already observed this behavior, encouraged him, “Elder brother, I’ve scouted out a beautiful mate for you.” “Who?” Kong asked. He replied, “She’s also a member of my family.” Kong thought hard about this for a good long time, and then replied, “No need.” With his face to the wall, he recited, “To one who’s already passed through the great seas, other waters are nothing difficult; / Except for those surrounding Wushan, there are no other clouds.” The young master recognized his meaning and responded, “My father admires and respects your significant talents, and has often wished for you to marry into the family. But I only have one little sister and she’s just too young. There’s my cousin, Song, who’s eighteen and far from coarse or crude. If you won’t believe unless you can see for yourself, Song’s daily routine takes her to a pavilion in the garden—you can be waiting there in a side-room to take a look at her.” Kong did as he was instructed and as a result saw Jiaona arrive in the company of a real beauty, her painted black eyebrows curved like moth antennae, her tiny feet adorned in phoenix slippers, in appearance Jiaona’s equal. Kong was greatly pleased, and invited the young master to serve as his go-between in the marriage plans. The next day, the young master came outside and congratulated him: “It’s a match.” Then he cleared another courtyard for Kong’s wedding ceremony. At sunset, court music filled the air, shaking the dust loose everywhere, and as he looked at the fairy maid snuggled beside him under a large quilt and canopy, he began to wonder whether the goddess’ palace wasn’t necessarily located in the heavens. They were very happy indeed.","she said, and hurried out. Kong leaped up to thank her, as if he had never been ill at all. But his sufferings were not at an end. Now he found himself yearning more and more for her beauty, abandoning his books and sitting for hours musing on nothing, listless and dead to the world. ‘I think I may have found the right person for you, Brother Kong,’ said Huangfu, perceiving his condition. ‘And who is that, pray?’ mumbled Kong. ‘A cousin of mine.’ Kong brooded for a while, before replying, ‘Do not trouble yourself for nothing.’ He stared at the wall, and heaved a deep sigh: ‘Speak not of lakes and streams to one Who knows the splendour of the sea; The clouds around the magic peaks of Wu Are the only clouds for me.’ Huangfu grasped his meaning at once (the cloud-wrapped peaks of Wu having once been the scene of a famous love encounter). ‘My father admires your great accomplishments, and has long wanted to see you marry into our family. But Grace is my only sister, and she is still much too young to marry. My cousin Pine, on the other hand, is eighteen years old and a good-looking girl. If you don’t believe me, see for yourself. She takes a walk every day in the garden; you can observe her from the front chamber.’ Kong did as his friend suggested, and watched Grace walking in the garden in the company of another young lady of great beauty, with dark, arched eyebrows and tiny feet encased in phoenix-patterned slippers. Kong observed to his great joy that she was every bit as beautiful as Grace, and he asked his friend to arrange the match at once. The very next day, Huangfu emerged from the women's quarters and hailed his friend. ‘Congratulations! Everything is settled!’ A separate courtyard was set apart for the wedding, and without further ado, that very night, the merry music of drums and pipes sounded in the house. Throughout the wedding ceremony Kong gazed blissfully at his bride, wondering if he was still on earth or had been transported to the Palace of the Moon. Once the ritual had been completed, their love was joyfully consummated."
抵長清，視風物如昨。無煩問途，竟至蘭若。弟子數人見貴客至，伏謁甚恭。乃問：“老僧焉往？”答雲：“吾師曩已物化。”問墓所，群導以往，則三尺孤墳，荒草猶未合也。眾僧不知何意。既而戒馬欲歸，囑曰：“汝師戒行之僧，所遺手澤宜恪守，勿俾損壞。眾唯唯。乃行。,"Arrived in Changqing, depending on the scenery as yesterday. No worries to ask the way, actually went to Lan Ruo. When several disciples saw the distinguished guests, they bowed and respectfully greeted him. He asked: ""Where is the old monk going?"" The answer said: ""My teacher's house has been materialized."" When I asked about the tomb, and the group led the way, there was a three-foot solitary tomb, and the weeds were still not closed. The monks did not know what to do. Then Jiema wanted to return, and he said: ""Your teacher, the monk of Jiexing, should strictly abide by the hand you left behind, so as not to damage it.","Arriving at Changqing, the monk found things to be as they previously had been. He hadn’t even been bothered by having to inquire how to find his way there, en route to the monastery. A number of his former disciples noticed this was an honored guest and bowed to him most respectfully. He then asked them, “What happened to the old monk who used to be here?” “Our Master’s shell has returned to nature,” they told him. He inquired about the grave. The group led him to a grave there that was mounded about three feet high, where the wild grass had not yet grown over it. The monks had no idea what his intentions were. Soon he called for his horse so he could return home, instructing his former disciples, “ Your Master lived piously as a monk. The personal items he left behind should be guarded faithfully. You must not allow anything to harm them.” The monks assured him they would do so, and he left.","But he refused to heed their advice and set off the very next day, arriving at Changqing to find everything exactly as he remembered it. He made his way straight to the monastery, without needing to ask the way. When the junior monks (his erstwhile disciples) saw this young nobleman arrive, they greeted him respectfully. ‘Where is your Master?’ he asked them. ‘He was transformed some time ago,’ they replied. He asked to see where they had buried him, and they took him to an isolated grave-site, the tomb itself some three feet high, the soil around it still bare, the grass having not yet had time to grow back. The monks were still trying to fathom the purpose of the ‘young nobleman's visit, when he sent for his horse and set off home again, instructing them as he left, ‘Your Master was a monk of virtue. Guard with care whatever relics you have of his, let no harm come to them.’ They promised to do as he said, and he went on his way."
冥王訝其速至，因蒲伏自剖。冥王以無罪見殺原之，准其滿限複爲人，是爲劉公。公生而能言，文章書史，過輒成誦。辛酉擧孝廉。每勸人：乘馬必厚其障泥；股夾之刑，勝於鞭楚也。,"Pluto was surprised at its speed, because Pu Fu cut himself apart. Pluto saw that he was innocent of killing Yuanzhi, and he allowed him to become a human again when he had reached the limit, which was Duke Liu. He was born to be able to speak, wrote and written history, and recited it in passing. Xin You is filial piety. Every person persuades: riding a horse will thicken the mud;","The Hell King was surprised by his speedy return, so Liu prostrated himself and revealed what had happened. The Hell King ruled that he could see no crimes associated with his death, so he pardoned him, declaring that he had fulfilled the terms of his punishment and could return as a man—which is how he became Master Liu. Master Liu was born with the ability to speak, and could recite compositions, letters and books after having read them only once. In the first year of the reign of Tianqi, he qualified as a juren. His advice to others was always the same: when riding a horse, be sure to give him a nice thick saddle blanket; and digging one’s heels into the sides of a horse inflicts a punishment more painful even than flogging.","The King of Hell was astonished to see him back again so soon. But this time when he told his story, grovelling humbly on the ground, the King pardoned him, as an innocent creature that had lost its life by mischance, and permitted him to be reincarnated as a human being. And so he was born into the Liu family, and graduated in the same year as my father's cousin. He was able to speak perfectly formed words the moment he came into the world, and as a child he was a prodigy, able to repeat anything by heart at a single reading – an essay, or an extract from one of the histories. He took his degree in the year xinyou. He was forever urging people to put proper saddlecloths on their horses, and telling them how excruciatingly painful it was for a horse to have the rider dig in his knees, more painful by far than being whipped."
吳請往覘其異，就便執柯。尋至村所，廬舍全無，山花零落而已。吳憶葬處仿佛不遠，然墳垅湮沒，莫可辨識，詫歎而返。母疑其爲鬼，入告吳言，女略無駭意。又弔其無家，亦殊無悲意，孜孜憨笑而已。眾莫之測，母令與少女同寢止，昧爽即來省問，操女紅糖巧絕倫。但善笑，禁之亦不可止。然笑處嫣然，狂而不損其媚，人皆樂之。鄰女少婦，爭承迎之。母擇吉爲之合卺，而終恐爲鬼物，竊於日中窺之，形影殊無少異。,"Wu invited him to meet Qi Yi, so he took up Ke. When I went to the village, there were no houses, only the mountains and flowers were scattered. Wu Yi's burial place seemed to be not far away, but the tomb ridge was obliterated and could not be identified, so he returned with a sigh. The mother suspected that he was a ghost, and sued Wu Yan, but the daughter was not surprised. And hanging him homeless, there is no sadness, just a smile. Unpredictable, the mother ordered to sleep with the girl, and Mo Shuang came to ask questions. But good laughter can't be stopped. However, the smile is sweet, mad without harming its charm, and everyone is happy. The young woman next door, scramble to welcome him. The mother chose auspiciousness for it, and in the end, she feared that it would be a ghost, stealing it in the sun and peeking at it.","Wu suggested that he go and discreetly investigate the mystery surrounding Yingning, in order to make arrangements for the marriage. By the time he arrived at the village, the huts and everything else had disappeared, with only the fallen petals of the mountain flowers remaining. Wu remembered that the place where his aunt had been buried was not far away. However, the grave had become entirely overgrown, making it impossible to determine precisely where it was located, so with a sigh of frustration, he went back. Wang’s mother was convinced that Yingning was a ghost. She went in and informed her of Wu’s report, but Yingning wasn’t the least bit startled; Wang’s mother sympathized with her for having no family, but not only did Yingning show no sign of sorrow, she kept on laughing naively. No one there could make sense of it. Wang’s mother arranged for Yingning to share sleeping quarters with her youngest daughter. Each morning at daybreak, Yingning dutifully paid her respects to Wang’s mother, and the exquisite precision of her needlework was unsurpassed. But even when it was forbidden, her friendly laughter couldn’t be stopped; and there was a charming quality to it, so even when it was wildly uninhibited, her laughter didn’t damage her attractiveness, and it made everyone else feel good. Both the girls and the women in the neighborhood competed for opportunities to welcome her. Wang’s mother chose an auspicious day for the wedding, but she still fretted that Yingning might be some kind of evil spirit. She covertly spied on her in the daylight, but she didn’t see anything unusual in the shape of her shadow.","Wu offered to go to the cottage and investigate, and at the same time to make inquiries about a possible marriage between the two young people. But when he reached the hamlet, all trace of the cottage had gone. There was nothing to be seen but a few blossoms strewn on a desolate hillside. He remembered that his Aunt Wu had been buried somewhere not far away, and found what he thought must be the place. But it was overgrown and the grave itself was no longer identifiable. He heaved a perplexed sigh and returned to the Wang family. Wang's mother began to wonder if Yingning might herself be a ghost. She went in and repeated Wu's story about his dead uncle and aunt, Mr and Mrs Qin, but the girl exhibited no surprise whatsoever. When Mrs Wang condoled with her for being an orphan, she did not seem to take it at all tragically and instead kept on giggling in her silly way. The others did not know what to make of it at all. Mrs Wang put Yingning to sleep in a room with one of the maids, and every morning she went in to see how the girl was getting on. Her needlework was certainly impeccable. It was only her incorrigible habit of laughing that detracted from her suitability as a future daughter-in-law. And yet somehow even that did not spoil her charm. However hysterically she laughed, people seemed to find pleasure in it, and the young women of the neighbourhood competed with each other for her company. So Wang's mother (even though she was still unable to dismiss her fears of some ghostly influence at work) decided to go ahead and choose an auspicious day for the wedding."

His heart was very clear, but he could not speak. Feeling very discouraged, I had no choice but to ask for milk from a mare. Over the past four or five years, the body has been cultivated. Very afraid of tart Chu, when seeing a whip, he is afraid and escapes. When the master rides, he must cover the mud and the bridle slowly, but it is not very painful; but the slaves and servants gouge the people without putting on the armor, and the two ankles are pinched, and the pain is deep in the heart. He was so angry that he did not eat for three days and died.","Shortly afterward, the Hell King turned to an account of the evils associated with Liu’s life; furious at what he found, he ordered a group of demons to hold him down and punish him by sending him back as a horse. Grim demons bound him and took him away at once. They traveled and arrived at a particular home, the entrance to which was up so high that Liu was unable to go any further. Just as he faltered there, the demons vigorously flogged him, causing him so much pain that he unconsciously raised his leg. When he looked around, he found himself on the ground in a stable. Then he heard someone say, “The black horse’s given birth to a pony, a colt.” In his heart he understood this all too well, but was unable to speak. He felt starved, but couldn’t find anything to stop his hunger, so he followed a mare around, begging for milk. After four or five years, Liu grew quite powerful. Nevertheless, he was terrified of the pain of the whip, and upon even seeing it would flee in dread. When his master rode him, he always added some padding to ease the load and would gradually slacken the reins as they went, so it wasn’t all unpleasant; but when it was the servants or groom, they’d go without outfitting him with any extra saddle cloth, digging their heels into his sides until the pain penetrated to his very bowels. Eventually, in a fit of anger, he went without eating for three days and succeeded in dying.","The next moment, the King, who had been perusing the record of the various misdeeds committed during Liu's life on earth, flew into a great rage and ordered his assembled demons to take Liu away, sentencing him to reincarnation as a horse. Liu was immediately seized and bound, and the demons carried him off to a building, the door-sill of which was so high that he was unable to step over it. He hesitated at the sill, and the demons behind him lashed him with all their might, causing him such pain that he stumbled forward and collapsed unconscious on the ground. When he came to, he saw that he was lying in a stable and heard a voice crying, ‘The black mare has foaled!’ Everything was clear to him, but he could say nothing. The next he knew he was dreadfully hungry, and for lack of any other source ofra began sucking at the mare's teats. Four or five years went by, and he grew into a fine strong horse but always remained at heart a fearful animal, terrified of the whip, the very sight of which sent him running away. His considerate master, when he rode him, always used a saddle-cloth, kept the reins loose and went at a leisurely pace, which he found more or less bearable. But the servants and grooms rode him bareback, squeezing his flanks and digging their heels into him, which caused him a searing pain in his insides. At length he could stand it no longer, refused all food, and three days later he was dead."
明日恐燕他出，早詣邀致。辰後具酒饌，留意察燕。既約同宿，辭以性癖耽寂。寧不聽，強擕臥具來，燕不得已，移榻從之，囑曰：“僕知足下丈夫，傾風良切。要有微衷，難以遽白。幸勿翻窺篋襆，違之兩俱不利。”寧謹受教。既各寢，燕以箱篋置窗上，就枕移時，齁如雷吼。寧不能寐。近一更許，窗外隱隱有人影。俄而近窗來窺，目光睒閃。寧懼，方欲呼燕，忽有物裂篋而出，耀若疋練，觸摺窗上石欞，飆然一射，即遽斂入，宛如電滅。燕覺而起，寧偽睡以覘之。燕捧篋檢征，取一物，對月嗅視，白光晶瑩，長可二寸，徑韭葉許。已而數重包固，仍置破篋中。自語曰：“何物老魅，直爾大膽，致壞篋子。”遂複臥。寧大奇之，因起問之，且告以所見。燕曰：“既相知愛，何敢深隱。我劍客也。若非石欞，妖當立斃；雖然，亦傷。”問：“所緘何物？”曰：“劍也。適嗅之有妖氣。”寧欲觀之。慨出相示，熒熒然一小劍也。於是益厚重燕。,"Tomorrow, I was afraid that Yan would come out, so I invited him early. Chen Hou with wine and food, pay attention to Cha Yan. Having made an appointment to live in the same house, he resigned to being obsessed with sex. Rather not listen, he forced his bedding to come, but Yan had no choice but to move the couch and follow him, exhorting: ""My servant knows that I have my husband, and I will be careful with the wind. It is difficult to be indifferent. It is fortunate that I do not look at the room, and I will violate the two. Both are disadvantageous."" Ning Jin was taught. Now that they were sleeping, Yan put the box on the window, and when the pillow was moved, it roared like thunder. Ning can't sleep. Nearly a while later, there was a shadow outside the window. He came closer to the window to peek, his eyes flashing. Ning fear, Fang wanted to call Yan, and suddenly something cracked and came out, shining like a training, touching the stone lattice on the window, and a shot, which suddenly converged, like an electric extinction. Yan woke up, and Ning Puppet fell asleep to meet him. Yan holds the crate for inspection, takes an object, smells the moon and looks at it, the white light is crystal clear, it can be two inches long, and the diameter is about the size of a leek. It's been packed several times, and it's still in a broken box. He said to himself: ""What is old and charming, straight and daring, and ruined the crate."" Then he went back to bed. Ning Da was curious, because he asked him, and told him what he saw. Yan said: ""Since we know each other and love each other, why would we dare to hide it? I am a swordsman. If it were not for the stone lattice, the demon would have been killed. Although, it would be injured."" Demonic."" Ning wanted to watch it. The appearance showed, Yingyingran a small sword. So benefit thick and heavy swallow.","The next day, fearing that Yan might go somewhere, first thing in the morning Ning paid a visit to invite him over. By just after 9:00, he’d prepared them wine and food, and he carefully scrutinized Yan as they ate. Afterwards, he suggested that he stay in Yan’s room that night, but Yan declined, explaining that he was unfit for company and was used to being alone. Ning wouldn’t hear of it and peremptorily carried his bedding over to Yan’s quarters. Since Yan couldn’t get him to stop, he moved his bed over to make room, advising him, “ I know you are a moral man, and I respect your innate goodness. I have some important things on my mind, and I’m not in a position to divulge them just now. Please don’t poke around and peek into my chest or clothing, for we’ll both suffer if you disobey my request.” Ning sincerely swore to honor Yan’s words. Then they both went to bed, Yan placing his chest on the window sill, and the moment he laid his head to rest, he began to snore like rolling thunder. Ning, however, was unable to get to sleep. Near midnight, he saw the shadow of some indistinct figure outside the window. Immediately it came near the window and peered inside, its eyes flashing with light. Ning was terrified, but just as he was about to cry out for Yan, suddenly something dazzlingly bright like white silk split open the chest and burst out, broke through the stone surrounding the window, and shot out, then quickly reentered the chest like a bolt of lightning. Yan sensed this and got up, while Ning pretended to be asleep, in order to observe him secretly: Yan picked up his chest to examine it, drew something out, then in the moonlight sniffed and inspected it as it gave off a lustrously bright white light, a thing two inches long and about as narrow as a chive leaf. When he was finished, he wrapped it thoroughly in several layers, and put it back inside the now-damaged chest. He said to himself, “What a thing that old demon is—coming here like that took some nerve, and now it’s ruined my chest.” Then he lay back down to sleep. Ning was astonished, so he got up to ask Yan about it, telling him everything he’d seen occur. Yan stated, “Since we’ve come to know each other pretty well, I can risk sharing the secret with you. I am a swordsman. If not for the stone around the window, the evil spirit would have been killed instantly; though it was certainly wounded.” Ning asked, “What is that thing you keep sealed up?” “My sword,” Yan replied. “When I sniffed it, there was the scent of demon on it.” Ning wanted to have a look at it. Yan generously took it out to show him, revealing a tiny, luminous sword. From that time forward, Ning’s respect for Yan was considerably increased.","Early the following day, afraid that Yan might decide to leave the temple, Ning invited him over, and later that morning set food and drink before him, anxious not to let him out of his sight. He broached the subject of spending the night with him in his cell, and at first Yan refused, saying that he was a creature of habit and much too accustomed to sleeping alone. In the end, Ning was so persistent (going so far as to carry his own bedding over to Yan's room) that Yan felt obliged to comply with his request, and made room for him. ‘You are a true gentleman,’ he said, with some vehemence. ‘ And I admire your courage greatly. But I have a secret that I cannot for the present divulge even to you. My secret is contained within this box of mine. I beg you not to pry. If you do, both of us will suffer the consequences.’ Ning gave his word. Yan placed the box to which he had been referring on the window-sill, and the minute his head touched his pillow he fell fast asleep and began snoring like thunder. Ning, by contrast, was unable to get to sleep at all. Around midnight he caught sight of a dim form outside, stealing up to the window, then a pair of blazing eyes peering into the room. Terrified, he was about to waken his room-mate, when a small bright object burst out of Yan's box and flew up into the air, cutting through the darkness like a strip of dazzling white silk, splitting in two the stone lintel above the window before flashing back into the box, swift as a bolt of lightning. By now, Yan was awake and on his feet, and Ning, pretending to be asleep, watched as he picked up the box and inspected it, then took something from it and held it up in the moonlight, smelling it and examining it with great care. The object was about two inches long and the width of a spring onion leaf. It shone with a crystalline white light. Yan wrapped it carefully in several layers of cloth and replaced it in the box, which was now broken. ‘The brazen demon!’ he muttered to himself, as he returned to his bed. ‘ To ruin my box like that!’ Ning, marvelling at the extraordinary event he had just witnessed, now rose from his bed and described to Yan all that he had seen. ‘Since we have become close friends,’ said Yan, ‘I cannot keep the truth from you any longer. I am a swordsman with certain unusual powers. If it had not been for that stone lintel, the evil spirit would be dead by now. As it is, he is certainly wounded.’ ‘What was it that you were wrapping up just now?’ ‘A sword. I could smell the monster's evil aura on it.’ Ning expressed a wish to see this magic weapon, and Yan generously agreed to show it to him. Ning gazed in wonder at the dazzling little miniature sword, and from that moment on held his fellow-lodger in great awe."
灘邑李氏有别第，忽一翁來税居，歲出直金五十，諾之。既去無耗，李囑家人别租。翌日翁至，曰：“租宅已有關說，何欲更僦他人？”李白所疑。翁曰：“我將久居是，所以遲遲者，以涓吉在十日之後耳。”因先納一歲之直，曰：“終歲空之，勿問也。”李送出，問期，翁告之。,"The Li family in Tanyi had a different rank, and suddenly a Weng came to the tax residence, and he paid fifty straight gold every year, and promised him. Since there is no cost to go, Li told his family not to rent. The next day, Weng arrived and said, ""It's already been said that renting a house, why do you want to be more embarrassing to others?"" Li Bai was suspicious. Weng said: ""I will stay here for a long time, so if I am late, I will use Juan Ji to be in the ear after ten days."" Because he accepted the one-year-old Zhi first, he said: ""It will be empty at the end of the year, so don't ask."" Li sent it out and asked the date , Weng told it.","The Li family owned a second home in Wei county. Unexpectedly, an old man came to them to lease the residence, guaranteeing faithfully to pay them fifty taels a year for it. Li agreed to rent it to him. After he’d left, however, there was no more news of him, so Mr. Li advised his servants to rent the place to someone else. The next day after they did so, the old man showed up and said to him, “You agreed to lease the residence to me, so why are you about to switch and rent it to someone else?” Li then explained his doubts. The old man replied, “I intend to be in the house for a long time; I was delayed, then, because I had to choose an auspicious time to move in, which will arrive after ten more days.” Proceeding to pay a year’s rent up front, he remarked, “Even if in the end it seems unoccupied for the year, don’t become concerned.” Li accompanied him out, inquiring about the date, and the old man told it to him.","A certain Mr Li possessed a secondary residence in Wei County. One day, an old man appeared and offered to rent it, proposing an annual rental of fifty taels, to which Li agreed. The man left and nothing more was heard of him for some time, whereupon Li gave instructions to his servants to let the place to someone else. The very next day, the old man arrived and said to Li, ‘I thought we already had an agreement that I would lease your house. Why have you let it to somebody else?’ Li explained the doubts occasioned by the old man's long absence. ‘I was proposing a lengthy stay,’ explained the old man, ‘so I was obliged to consult the almanac for a propitious day on which to commence it, and this delayed me for ten days.’ He then handed over a full year's rent. ‘Even if the house stays empty for a whole year, do not ask me any questions about it.’ As he was leaving, Li asked him when he would be returning and the old man named the day."

A woman who lives alone, dreams of being with someone, wakes up and touches it, her husband is also small. Observing that his feelings are different from other people, he knew that he was a fox. He just got out of bed and passed away before the door was opened. At twilight, I invite her to accompany her. There is a ten-year-old son, and he does not sleep on a couch, but also recruits all. It was late at night, and the old woman and her son fell asleep. The fox came back, and the woman murmured like a dream. The old man called him, and the fox went away. Of course, the body suddenly suddenly if there is death. At night, I dare not put out the candle, and the ring shall not be ripe. At night, my son and wife leaned against the wall and had little sleep. After I woke up, I lost my wife. I am afraid to look for it. The child held a fire to illuminate it all over the place, and when he reached his room, the mother lay naked in it. Close to help him, but also not ashamed. Naturally, he is crazy, singing and crying, and every day is in a million ways. Tired of living with people at night, I sleep in another bed, and my son and wife are also sent away. Every time the child hears his mother's laughter, he catches fire. The mother was angry with the child, and the child did not care, because they were both courageous. However, there is no festival to play, and the daily effect is to stack the windows with bricks and stones, and they will not listen. Or if you remove a stone, it will roll on the ground and make a coquettish cry, and no one dares to touch it. After a few days, the two windows were completely blocked and there was no light, but they were covered with mud and covered with holes. After painting, there is nothing to do, so I sharpen the kitchen knife. Anyone who sees him hates his stubbornness and doesn't take human teeth. Er Xiao hid the knife in her arms, covered the lamp with a scoop, waited for her mother and babbled, hurriedly turned on the lamp, and shouted at the door. After a long time, it was no different, and he left the door and threatened to make a fraudulent search. There is something like a raccoon, rushing to the door. When he hit it urgently, only its tail was cut off, about two inches, and the blood was still dripping. At the beginning, when the lamp was lit, the mother scolded him, and the son Ruofu heard it. If you miss it, go to bed with regret. Although self-thought is not immediately killed, it is fortunate that it will not come. In the Ming Dynasty, he saw the bloodstains go over the wall. Trace it and enter He's Garden. At night, the fruit is dead, and the child is delighted; but the mother is lying like a dead man.","In Chu, there was a certain old man who was off engaged in foreign trade. His wife, who’d been left alone in the house, dreamed that someone was there with her; when she woke up and reached out her hand, she found a little man there. Scrutinizing him, she thought him an odd creature, before she realized that it was a fox. A moment later it ran under the bed and vanished, though the door to the room hadn’t been opened. When the next night came, she asked the old woman who was her cook to sleep there and keep her company. The wife had a ten-year-old son who ordinarily slept in his own bed, and he was also invited to join them. Late that night, as the old woman and the son slept, the fox returned. The wife began murmuring, like she was speaking in her dreams. This woke the cook, who cried out to her, and the fox ran away. From then on, the wife felt agitated, as though she needed to escape from something. When the evening arrived, she didn’t dare blow out the candle, and warned her son not to sleep too deeply. As the night progressed, the son and the old woman leaned against the wall to catch a few winks of sleep. Then when they woke up, the wife was gone, so they figured she must have stepped out to relieve herself; they waited a long time, but she didn’t return, so they began to worry. The old woman was frightened, and didn’t dare go out to look for her. The son grabbed a burning candle and looked everywhere in the house, till in one room he found his mother lying naked; he drew near to offer her assistance, and she didn’t seem to feel at all bashful or self-conscious. She became progressively more aberrant, singing, sobbing, shouting and cursing each day, in many different ways. At night, she’d become disgusted at the idea of other people being in the room, so the son slept in a separate bed and the old woman was also kept out. The son always listened till he heard his mother’s caustic voice, then he’d get up with a light to investigate. The mother would angrily scold her son, but he didn’t let it get to him, and everyone admired his courage. However, he also indulged himself in playing, pretending each day he was a block layer, piling up tiles and blocks against a window, ignoring calls for him to stop. When someone removed one of the blocks, he rolled around on the ground in a crying tantrum, so no one ventured to provoke him further by touching them. After several days, two windows had been completely covered up, so no light could shine through. When this was done, he smeared on mud to close up any gaps in the wall, applying it all day long without complaining about the labor. Once he was finished spreading it on, he had nothing to do, so he grabbed a kitchen knife and quickly began sharpening it. Observing this, everyone became disgusted with his foolishness and refused to pay any further attention to him. That night, the son concealed the knife in his clothing, and with a large dipper covered his lamp. He waited until his mother began to rave in her sleep, then swiftly uncovered the lamp, shut the door, and began shouting. Time passed without anything odd happening, so he feigned moving away from the door, pretending that he wanted to leave the room and relieve himself outside. Suddenly, something like a fox appeared, abruptly seizing the opportunity to run for the door. The son struck quickly, neatly cutting off two inches of its tail though it got away. Blood dripped from the segment like water. Subsequently, when he carried his lamp over and lifted it up, his mother as usual began cursing him, but the son just acted as though he hadn’t heard her. He hadn’t hit the thing where it mattered, and, profoundly disappointed about it, he went to rest. Thinking it over to himself, he realized that even if he hadn’t killed it, at least he’d been able to stop it from getting back in. At daybreak, he noticed that there were traces of blood beyond his wall, so he followed them. The blood led him into a garden belonging to the He family. When night arrived and it became clear that the thing hadn’t come back, the son was privately overjoyed. Nevertheless, his mother inexplicably remained still, lying there like she was dead.","In the southern region of China known anciently as Chu, there lived a merchant who was often away from home on business, leaving his wife much on her own. During one of his absences she awoke from a dream of a sexual encounter, and feeling around her sure enough discovered a little man in her bed. There was something strange about him that betrayed him at once as a fox-spirit. After a little while, he climbed down from the bed and disappeared from sight, without even needing to open the door. The next evening, when she went to bed, she asked her old cook to keep her company. She also asked her ten-year-old son, who usually slept in a separate bed, to come and sleep next to her. Late that night, when both cook and boy were fast asleep, the fox came again, and the merchant's wife mumbled something, as if she were talking in her sleep. This woke the cook, who called out to her mistress, whereupon the fox went away. All the following day, the wife seemed somehow distracted, not her normal self at all. When night fell, she left her lamp alight and told her son to try not to sleep too soundly. Nonetheless, in the small hours, both cook and boy dozed off for a spell with their faces turned to the wall, and when they awoke the lady was nowhere to be seen. They imagined she must have gone out to relieve herself, but when they had waited a long while and there was still no sign of her , they began to have misgivings. The cook was too scared to go out and look, so the boy took the lamp and went searching everywhere for his mother. Eventually he found her lying stark naked on the floor in one of the other rooms of the house. When he went to help her up, she seemed not in the least ashamed of her nakedness. From that day on, she became quite unhinged in her mind and took to singing, wailing, cursing and howling at all hours of the day and night. She now refused to have anyone with her at night. She insisted on sleeping apart from her son and sent the cook away as well. If her son heard laughter or voices coming from his mother's room, he would rise from his bed immediately and go in with a light. All he ever received for this was an angry scolding, which he accepted without a murmur. The members of the household thought him a plucky boy. Then he started playing at being a builder, constructing piles of bricks and stones on the window-sills of his mother's room, which everyone thought was exceedingly naughty and strange. His elders tried to stop him, but he paid them no heed, and if anyone tried to take away one of his stones, he would hurl himself on the ground and scream like a baby – so they were reluctant to cross him. After a few days of this, both his mother's windows were completely bricked up, and not a ray of sunlight could find its way into her bedroom. Next he plastered over the slightest chink in the walls with mud, working at it flat out all day. And when that job was finished, he busied himself sharpening the kitchen choppers, rubbing the blades noisily backwards and forwards, exasperating everyone in the process. One night, the boy hid one of the choppers in his shirt and shaded his bedroom lamp with a gourd. He lay awake waiting for his mother's strange nocturnal mutterings to begin, and when they did, rushed in with his lamp uncovered, blocking the doorway and yelling at the top of his voice. A few minutes went by and nothing happened. Then just as he stepped away from the door and loudly announced his intention of searching the room, suddenly out rushed a creature resembling a fox and made straight for the open door. The boy struck it smartly with the chopper, and removed about two inches of its tail. He could see the blood dripping on to the floor. When he lifted his lamp to look around him more closely, his mother began abusing him, but he took no notice. He finally went back to his bed and fell asleep, his only regret being that he had not been able to hit the creature fair and square. But he reflected that, although he had failed to kill it, he had probably deterred it from coming again in a hurry. The next morning, he followed the trail of blood, which led over the wall and into the garden of the neighbouring Ho family. That night, although to his great joy the fox did not reappear in his mother's room, his mother herself lay there prostrate, delirious and seemingly at death's door."

The minister or Guandong Taoist priest Jiao Mo lived in the inner city and always practiced the technique of edict, which was quite effective. The public builds a hut and invites it. The Taoist priest Zhu Shufu made Guigui stick to the wall. The fox is not afraid, and throwing it is a plus. Announcement to priests. The Taoist priest was angry, he went to the public house and built an altar. Russia saw a giant fox lying under the altar, and the family members had been abused for a long time, and they hated Qi so much that a maid approached him, and the maid suddenly suffocated. The Taoist priest said: ""This thing is rampant, I still can't get over it, how can a woman make a mistake."" Then he said: ""You can also use the word of the fox."" The Taoist criticized his residence. The maid Zuo said to the fox: ""I am from the Western Regions, and there are eighteen generations of people who have entered the capital."" The Taoist priest said: ""Under the chariot, the He Rong generation has lived for a long time? You can go quickly!"" The fox did not answer. The Taoist priest attacked the case and said angrily, ""Do you want to interfere with my order? If it is further extended, the law will not be yours!"" The priest is quick. The maid and the servants are absolutely gone, and it has been a long time since Su. Russia saw four or five groups of white blocks, rolling like a ball with the eaves, chasing them one after another, and they all disappeared in an instant. It is Suian.","One day, while waiting for an imperial meeting to begin, Dong began chatting with the other officers about the strange events. A great courtier told him that there was a Daoist priest named Jiaoming, from Guangdong, who now lived in the capital. He possessed the magical skill to control evil spirits. Master Dong traveled to the Daoist’s cottage and requested his assistance. Jiaoming created a red amulet for him and sent him back home to paste it up on one of his walls. The fox, however, didn’t fear the amulet and subsequently began to throw down even more things. Master Dong went back again to inform the Daoist. Jiaoming was furious, so he personally paid a visit to Dong’s household, piling up earthenware jars and exercising his magic on them. Instantly they were able to see an enormous fox lying prostrate next to the jar. The family members had endured its ceaseless cruelties for a long time, harboring an extremely deep grudge, so one of the maid servants drew close to strike it. The maid servant suddenly fell to the ground, unable to breathe. Jiaoming declared, “This thing is on a rampage—even I haven’t been able to frighten it, and the woman shouldn’t have attacked it recklessly.” Then he added, “We might use her body to hear what the fox has to confess.” Making a hand gesture over his halberd, he directed an incantation to the fox through the maid, and the maidservant suddenly rose till she was kneeling upright. The Daoist then grilled the fox about where he lived. The maid servant, speaking as the fox, declared, “I was born in the western regions, then entered the capital where I have already lived for eighteen lifetimes.” The Daoist exclaimed, “How dare you live in the imperial capital for so long? We need you to leave now!” The fox made no reply. Jiaoming struck a table in anger, demanding, “Are you trying to resist my command? If so, you’d better think twice—my magic won’t forgive you!” Terrified, the fox then crouched and changed his facial expression, honestly and sincerely expressing his respect for the priest’s warnings. Jiaoming again told him to go away ickly. The maid servant fell forward again, breathless, and after a long time began to regain consciousness. Immediately, they saw a group of four or five round white lumps, rolling like balls, come near the edge of the roof’s eaves before moving away, one following after another, and in an instant they were all gone. As a result, the place was peaceful thereafter. 31.","One day when he was on duty at court and described this strange phenomenon to his colleagues, a senior minister mentioned a certain Taoist master from the north-east by the name of Jiao Ming – Scorched Moth – who lived in the Inner Manchu City and issued exorcist spells and talismans reputed for their efficacy. Dong paid the man a personal call and requested his aid, whereupon the Master wrote out some charms in cinnabarred ink and told Dong to paste them on his wall. The foxes were unperturbed by these measures, however, and continued to hurl things around with greater vigour than ever. Dong reported back to the Taoist, who was angered by this apparent failure of his charms and came in person to Dong's house, where he set up an altar and performed a full rite of exorcism. Suddenly they beheld a huge fox crouching on the ground before the altar. Dong's household had suffered long from this creature's antics, and the servants felt a deep-seated sense of grievance towards it. One of the maids went up to it to deal it a blow, only to fall dead to the ground. ‘This is a vicious beast!’ exclaimed the Taoist. ‘Even I could not subdue it! This girl was very foolish to provoke it.’ He continued, ‘Nonetheless, we can now use her to question the fox.’ Pointing his index finger and middle finger at the maid, he pronounced certain spells, and suddenly she rose from the ground and knelt before him. The Taoist asked her where she hailed from. ’I come from the Western Regions,’ replied the maid, in a voice that was clearly not her own but that of the fox. ‘We have been here in the capital for eighteen generations.’ ‘How dare creatures such as you dwell in the proximity of His Imperial Majesty? Off with you at once!’ The fox-voice was silent, and the Taoist thumped the altar-table angrily. ‘How dare you disobey my orders? Delay a moment longer, and my magic powers will work on you harshly!’ The fox shrank back fearfully, indicating his submission, and the Taoist urged him once more to be gone. Meanwhile the maid had fallen to the ground again, dead to the world. It was a long while before she regained consciousness. All of a sudden they saw four or five white lumps of some strange substance go bouncing like balls one after the other along the eaves of the building, until they were all gone. Then peace finally reigned in the Dong household."

Public hi, welcome to ask. Sheng said: ""Because of dog and horse disease, Master Lao has been waiting for a long time, and he is uneasy. I am fortunate to be able to walk on a stick."" Arrived in the li, ordered the son and the teacher to serve the students, and the Suye night accompanied them. The son's name was Zaichang, he was sixteen years old, and he was still unable to write. However, she is extremely intelligent, and where literature and art have gone through two or three times, they will never be forgotten. At the age of residence, you will be able to write down a pen. Benefiting from the public power, then entered the city itching. All the careers planned for life are recorded and taught, and there are seven questions in the middle, and there are no omissions. One day, the public said to Sheng: ""You have left the rest of the thread, and you have made Ruzi famous. However, Huang Zhongchang abandoned it!"" Sheng said: ""It's a risk of life! Use Fu Ze to exhale for the article, let the world know that half a lifetime is lost, and it is not a crime of war. , the wish is enough. And there is no regret for the scholar to have one confidant, why should he abandon the white scorpion, it is called a profitable city!"" The public has been a long visitor, fearing that he will miss the annual test, and persuaded him to return to the province. The life was miserable and unhappy, and the prince could not bear to be strong, and asked the prince to accept the grain for it. The son also took up the Nangong Palace, and he was appointed to be in charge of the ministry. When he was over the age of two, he was born in Beiqi, and was recommended by the township. Hui Gongzi sent Nanhe to do official duties, so he said to Sheng: ""This is not far from your hometown. Sir, you are going to the sky, and the brocade will be faster."" Sheng was also happy. He chose auspicious path, arrived in Huaiyang Realm, and ordered his servants and horses to send them back home.","When a number of days had passed, the man at the gate suddenly made way for Scholar Ye, who had just arrived. Elated, Ding welcomed him and inquired about his condition. Ye replied, “Since I was taken ill, I’ve troubled you into waiting for me a long time and I’ve been extremely concerned that I’ve caused you worry. Now it’s my good fortune to be able to accompany you, sir.” Ding accordingly packed his clothes to be ready to depart early at daybreak. When they arrived at Ding’s hometown, he ordered his son, Zaichang, to work as Ye’s student, so from morning till night Ye was always accompanied by the boy, who was sixteen years old but still unable to compose a literary essay. Yet he was peerlessly bright, and whenever he’d read over a piece of literature just two or three times, he could always recall it, without forgetting a thing. Once Ye had been living with them for a year, Zaichang proved able to begin writing accomplished literary essays. With this improvement and his father’s influence, he was able to become a xiucai. Ye intended to teach the boy as much as he could, writing down everything he knew for Zaichang to review. In the examination hall, Zaichang wrote on seven topics without missing any of them, and finished second from the top. Ding said to Ye one day, “You only used the leftovers of your wisdom, and they were enough to help my boy succeed in the examination. Yet your outstanding talents continue to be ignored—there must be something we can do!” Ye replied, “I’m afraid it’s fated. But because you’ve lent me some of your good fortune, my writings will finally receive an audience and make everyone understand that while half of my life has been profitless, it’s not because I lacked the talent to succeed—that will be enough to wish for. What’s more, if a scholar obtains even one person who knows and appreciates him thoroughly, there should be no trace of regret at all. There’s no point in bothering to take off the white clothes of the xiucai only to chase after degrading fame and profit.” Since Ye had been staying with them for such a long time, Ding, fearing he might miss the yearly examination, strongly advised him to return to his home province. Ye, saddened by this, felt miserable. Ding couldn’t bear to force Ye to leave, so he asked his son to buy an official title for Ye when Zaichang went to the capital for the examination there. Zaichang was successful once again in the examination at the southern palace and was conferred the administrative head of a department there. He brought Ye along to his imperial office, where they were together from morning till night. The following year, Ye took part in the civil service examination in the capital and surprisingly won the title of juren. Just at that time, Zaichang was assigned to take charge of the Southern Yellow River District’s affairs, and said to him, “This posting will take me to a place not far from your home town. Master, you’ve been promoted to an esteemed position, so your glorious return will be a happy event.” Ye was equally joyful and chose an auspicious date for them to journey on their way. When they reached the borders of Huaiyang, Zaichang ordered an attendant to take a horse and accompany Scholar Ye home.","Several days later, his gate-man announced the arrival of Mr Ye, and Ding hurried out joyfully to greet him, asking anxiously after his health. ‘Alas, this wretched ailment of mine has delayed you far too long, sir,’ said Ye apologetically. ‘But now at last I can accompany you.’ So Ding packed his bags and set off with Ye at first light the next morning. When they reached Ding's native village, he instructed his own son to treat Ye with the greatest respect and to regard him as his teacher, waiting upon him and constantly keeping him company. The son's name was Zaichang, and he was at the time sixteen years old. He had not yet acquired a proficiency in the prevalent rhetorical techniques of the Eight-Legged Essay, although he was a youth of exceptional promise, and had only to read through a piece of prose a couple of times to memorize it perfectly. A year later, under Ye's expert tutelage, he was writing fluent compositions of his own and, thanks to his father's influence, was accepted into the District Academy. Ye copied out all his own best essays for young Ding to study, and the youth was able as a result to answer all of the seven questions in his examination papers and was listed second overall. Ding the elder spoke to Ye. ‘You have imparted to my son sufficient knowledge for him to succeed in his examinations. But you yourself, the fount of this knowledge, are still denied the success you deserve. This is indeed a sorry state of affairs!’ ‘It is simply the work of fate,’ replied Ye. ‘ Thanks to our friendship and the good fortune it has brought me, I have at least been able to put my humble accomplishments to some good purpose. That is a consolation. And your son's success will at least show the world that my own dismal failure in life has not been due to a complete lack of talent. I am content with that. To have one true friend is enough for me. Why should I strive for worldly success?’ Ding was anxious that by keeping Ye too long a guest in his house he would prevent him from attending the next examination in his own home district, and urged him to return home for this purpose. Ye seemed most unhappy at the idea of leaving, and Ding did not insist but instead instructed his son to purchase for Ye the rank of membership in the Imperial College once he was in the capital, since this would entitle Ye to sit directly for the second degree. Ding junior duly succeeded in the metropolitan examinations, and immediately upon receiving the post of Secretary in one of the Boards, he arranged for Ye to be admitted to the Imperial College, and kept him company there day and night. A year later, Ye himself finally sat the examinations in the capital and was awarded the full status of second-degree graduate. At the same time young Ding was ordered to go on a tour of duty to Henan Province. ‘I shall be not far from your home town,’ he said to Ye. ‘This would surely be an excellent chance for you to return home and celebrate your own recent success.’ Ye was delighted at this idea, and together they selected a propitious day for the journey. On reaching the area of Huaiyang, young Ding sent servants and horses to escort Ye home."
新城王大司馬有主計僕，家稱素封。忽夢一人奔入，曰：“汝欠四十千，今宜還矣。”問之不答，徑入内去。既醒，妻產男。知爲夙孽，遂以四十千捆置一室，凡兒衣食病藥皆取給焉。過三四歲，視室中錢僅存七百。適乳姥抱兒至，調笑於側，僕呼之曰：“四十千將盡，汝宜行矣！”言已，兒忽顏色蹙變，項摺目張；再撫之，氣已絕矣。乃以餘資置葬具而瘞之。此可爲負欠者戒也。,"The new city king, Da Sima, has a master and servant, and his family is called Sufeng. Suddenly a man rushed in and said, ""You owe 40,000 yuan, and it's time to pay it back."" He didn't answer the question, and went inside. When he wakes up, his wife gives birth to a son. Knowing that he was a sinner, he put 40,000 bundles in one room, and all the children were given medicine for clothing, food, and illness. After three or four years old, the money in the visual room is only seven hundred. Nurse Shi came to hold the child, teased him, and the servant called him: ""Forty thousand will be exhausted, you should do it!"" Absolutely. He used the rest of the funds to buy burial utensils and slaughter them. This is also the precept for those who are in debt.","In Xincheng, there was a steward who served in the wealthy household of the primary army minister there. While he was asleep and dreaming, a man unexpectedly rushed in and said to him, “You’re 40,000 short, and now you have to pay up.” He asked what this was about, but there was no reply from the man, who went directly into the household’s inner rooms. Immediately, the steward woke up and found that his wife had given birth to a son. He recognized that this boy must be the consequence of some misdeed from a previous life, so he proceeded to bundle together 40,000 copper coins and set them aside in one of the rooms of the house, put the boy in the same room, and provided him with clothing, food, and medicine for illnesses. Three or four years passed by, and when he checked on the money remaining from what he’d set aside in the room, there were only 700 coppers left. Just then the boy’s old wet-nurse arrived and hugged the boy, trying to make him laugh as she stood beside him. Then the steward cried, “The 40,000 is just about used up, so it’s time for you to go.” Once these words had been spoken, the color suddenly drained from the boy, his neck contorted and his eyes bugged out. As the steward tried to check on him, the boy just stopped breathing. So they took the last of the surplus cash to cover the cost of his funeral preparations and then buried him. This was a good warning for those men who owe others money.","One day, this steward dreamed that a man rushed into the house and said to him, ‘Today you must pay me back those forty strings of cash you owe me.’ The steward asked him who he was, but the man made no answer and hurried past him into the inner apartments. The steward awoke, to learn that his wife had given birth to a son, and he knew at once that this child was a karmic retribution, his ‘payment’ of a debt contracted in a previous life. He duly set aside forty strings of cash, the sum specified in his dream, and used it to buy whatever food, clothes and medicines the baby might need. By the time the boy was three or four years old, the steward found that of the forty strings (forty thousand coins all told), there remained no more than seven hundred coins. One day, when the wet-nurse came by and played with the child before his eyes, the steward merely looked at him and exclaimed, ‘The forty strings are nearly spent. It is time you were on your way.’ The words were no sooner spoken than the child pulled a strange face, his head fell back and his eyes opened in a glassy stare. They tried to revive him, but without success. The father used the balance of the forty strings to pay for a coffin, and buried him. This should be a warning to people with unpaid debts."

It is a certain person who cannot bear the pain of female guarding. Female beast; Jieqing entered the sinus, so he was the lover of the quilt. In front of the cloud and rain terrace, the tail of the sable was swaying wildly; in the gentle village, the waist of the elephant was frequently dragged. The arrowhead took root as soon as he drank feathers. Suddenly, he thought about the friendship between different species, and he directly belonged to the idea of absurdity. The dragon barked a traitor and became a traitor, jealous and murdered, and the law was intractable to Xiao Cao; man is not a beast but a real beast. Flesh will not be eaten by a jackal. Woohoo! If a person rapes and kills a woman, the woman intends to cut it; as for a dog who rapes and kills Yang Shi, there is no punishment. If a person is bad, he will be punished as a dog. , please escort to ask Yama.""","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “Those who engage in illicit sexuality in a notorious place must expect to be censured for it; but even a rendezvous in such a place is to be scorned. This was a woman who couldn’t bear to live without sex and thought about intercourse all the time. At night the one lying on her turned out to be an animal from her own household. She made the dog her lover, and it mounted her under the covers. “At the place of their lovemaking, the dog’s tail wags back and forth. With the beast inside her warmth and softness, the woman moves her waist sweetly. The truth eventually comes out when she opens her thighs and uncovers its tool—then gives in as it returns the shaft to its target, which swallows its length to the root. To take to the idea of bestiality suddenly is really warped. “The dog, which should guard against adulterers, turned out to be an adulterer itself. Then it became a murderer because of its jealousy. It’s difficult to apply the laws of the government to punish its guilt. The woman, who was not an animal, turned out to have a truly bestial mind and engaged in filthy, stinking copulation with it. Even the jackals and the tigers would refuse to eat her flesh. Truth eventually comes out: Pu delicately adapts the proverb that the awl will eventually pierce through the leather bag holding it, which is conventionally construed as meaning that one’s true qualities will eventually come to light. The ying, or “tool” in this translation, is literally the “sharp point of the awl,” to extend Pu’s euphemistic proverbial analogy. The shaft . . . to the root: More of Pu’s euphemistic references to the male and female genitalia and the sex act. The penis is referred to here in the original as an awl, an arrow/javelin, and a feather. “Alas! As the human being involved in this adultery, the woman should be cut an inch at a time; but when it comes time for the adulterous dog to be punished, there’s no way to sentence it with the laws of the mortal world. Since a human being transgressed, the law should ideally punish that person by turning her into a dog; but when the dog transgressed, even the underworld couldn’t find a way to punish it. It would be better to dismember the dog and leave its spirit unable to rest—then its spirit could be arrested and brought before the Hell King for sentencing.” 20.",This woman is certainly not the only creature with a human visage to have coupled with an animal.

The servants were dressed and bearded and beards were unusual, and the former messengers also served on their side. The young man whispered to the celestial master, and the celestial master said to the duke, ""This gentleman is from the same village, but you don't know him?"" The duke asked him. Said: ""This is the legendary hail god Li Zuoche."" Gong was stunned and changed his face. The Master of Heaven said, ""It is suitable to say that it is raining and hail, so I will say goodbye."" The Duke asked, ""Where?"" He said, ""Zhangqiu."" The master of heaven said, ""This god's imperial edict, the hail has a fortune, how can we meet each other?"" The Celestial Master thought about it for a long time, and then he asked: ""It's a lot to fall into the valley, don't hurt the crops."" He also instructed: ""The distinguished guest is sitting, and the text is not martial."" , the hustle and bustle of the ground. Russia extended for more than a moment, and tried his best to rise up, so he was higher than the garden tree; he rose again, higher than the pavilion. With a thunderbolt, it flew northward, the house shook and the banquet wobbled. Gong Hai said: ""Going is a thunderbolt!"" The master said: ""It is appropriate to take precautions, so be late, or else you will be gone with a single sound."" It was a day of heavy rain and hail, the ditches were full, and there were only a few in the fields.","The Daoist master treated everyone with equal respect. His servants, who all had broad faces and long beards, weren’t dressed like common people. The servant who had been dispatched to meet Wang also served there and stood at the master’s side. He paused, faced the Daoist, and spoke to him in a low, confidential, tone. Referring to the servant, the Daoist then said to Wang, “This gentleman is your fellow countryman—don’t you recognize him?” The official asked who he was and the Daoist replied, “He’s the one your world calls the Hail God, Li Zuoche.” The official was so stunned he couldn’t control the change in his facial expression. “Just now,” the Daoist master commented, “he received an edict from heaven to make it rain and hail, so he’ll have to say goodbye to you right away.” “Where’s it going to fall?” Wang asked. “At Zhangqiu,” was the reply. Concerned about the safety of Zibo, which was near Zhangqiu, Wang left his place at the table and begged for his hometown to be excused from the Hail God’s mission. The Daoist master explained, “This is an edict from the Jade Emperor above. The amount of hail is fixed in quantity—who has the authority to reduce it?” Wang was beside himself with worry. The Daoist master pondered this for a very long time, then turned to his servant and advised him, “You could channel the rain and hail into the gorge without hurting the corn in the fields.” He further noted, “The guest of honor is already seated; when you leave, try not to be so disruptive.” The god then went out into the courtyard, where mist suddenly materialized around his feet, spreading magically over the ground. Soon he flew up into the sky to the height of the trees in the courtyard; continuing, he soared up past the rooftops of its buildings. Then a thunderclap sounded as the god flew swiftly to the north, shaking the court so violently that bamboo mats and other items waved liked fans. “His departure’s making it thunder!” cried out the startled Wang. The Daoist master replied, “This was a mild departure, since I warned him; otherwise, he’d disappear just as the wind was making an enormous sound.” Resigned, the official left to return home, recording the date and sending someone to Zhangqiu to inquire about the hail there. It turned out to be true that there was a huge rain and hail storm on that date that filled every irrigation canal and ditch—while in the farm fields, barely any accumulated at all. 21.","‘My Master has learned of your imminent arrival and has sent me ahead to welcome you.’ Wang was astonished at their foreknowledge of his proposed visit, which only increased his sense of reverence towards the Taoist Patriarch and fortified his determination to wait upon him. He finally arrived at his destination, to find the Heavenly Patriarch surrounded by his retinue of strangely robed attendants, their hair and beards dressed in an antique manner. The Patriarch received him most cordially and treated him to a fine banquet. The man from the skiff also waited on him and, after a little while, Wang inquired who he was. ‘He is a fellow countryman of yours,’ replied the Heavenly Patriarch. ‘Do you not know him?’ Wang begged to be enlightened. ‘This is Li Zuoche, he whom men call the God of Hail.’ Wang's face fell in sheer astonishment. ‘He has just informed me,’ continued the Heavenly Patriarch, ‘of a new rain-and-hail commission. He will soon have to take his leave of us.’ ‘Where is he going?’ asked Wang. ‘To Zhangqiu.’ Now Zhangqiu was right next to his own native town in Shandong, and Wang immediately got down from his seat and put in a plea for his neighbours, that they might be spared a violent hail-storm. ‘Unfortunately this decree emanates from the Supreme Deity,’ said the Patriarch. ‘The quantity of hail to be dropped has been exactly predetermined and cannot be altered for personal reasons.’ The Patriarch could see, however, that Wang was deeply distressed, and after pondering the matter for a long while, he turned and instructed the God of Hail to discharge most of his hailstones on the hills and valleys, so as to spare the crops. ‘And as you can see,’ he went on, ‘I have a guest, so would you mind making your departure a little more civilized than normal?’ The God left the hall and went out into the courtyard, where seconds later a cloud of mist could be seen billowing out from beneath his feet. He hovered above the ground for a moment, then lifted off with massive force, reaching first tree-top, then roof-top level. Finally there was an almighty crash of thunder, and as he soared up into the sky and northwards, plates rattled on the tables and the whole building quaked. ‘You mean to say that every time he goes, it thunders like that!’ gasped the awestruck Wang. ‘Just now I asked him to tone it down,’ said the Heavenly Patriarch, ‘so he made it a leisurely take-off. Otherwise he would have zoomed straight up into the air – bang!’ When Wang eventually took his leave, he made a note of the date. Later he sent a man to Zhangqiu to make inquiries, and it transpired that on that exact day there had been a particularly heavy storm, with rain and hail filling the watercourses to overflowing. But strangely, only a few lumps of hail had landed on the fields."
異史氏曰：“鄉人憒憒，憨狀可掬，其見笑於市人有以哉。每見鄉中稱素豐者，良朋乞米，則怫然，且計曰：‘是數日之資也。’或勸濟一危難，飯一煢獨，則又忿然，又計曰：‘此十人五人之食也。’甚而父子兄弟，較盡錙銖。及至淫博迷心，則頃囊不吝；刀鋸臨頸，則贖命不遑。諸如此類，正不勝道，蠢爾鄉人，又何足怪。”,"Mr. Yi Shi said: ""The villagers are sullen and embarrassed, and they laugh at the people in the city. Every time I see people in the township called Sufeng, good friends begging for rice, they are stunned, and they say: 'It's a number. It is also the capital of the day.' Or when he persuades to help a crisis, and when he eats a meal alone, he is angry, and he says: 'This is the food for ten people and five people.' Even father, son and brother are more expensive. Then the money is not stingy; the knife and saw are on the neck, and the redemption is not to mention. Such things are incomparable, and stupid people from the township are so strange.""","The collector of these strange tales remarks, “The villager was so incredibly stupid, his foolishness was almost something you could consider endearing. No surprise, then, that he saw the marketplace people grinning at him. One often sees that when villagers who have no official titles, and are considered rich locally, are asked by a good friend for some rice, they won’t do what’s right—indeed, calculating before replying, ‘That’s several days’ earnings there.’ Or if they’re encouraged to help those threatened by disaster, or to prepare a meal for a lone, solitary person, again resenting what is right, calculatedly say, ‘That’s enough food for five or ten people.’ “At the worst, fathers and sons, elder brothers and younger brothers, all exhaust themselves in the settling of trifling money matters. When their hearts are driven mad with gambling lust or sexual desire, however, in an instant they’re no longer stingy; or when the sword is about to come down on their necks, they’ll pay to buy their own lives back without hesitation. But individuals in such categories are too numerous to list separately, so the example of such a foolish villager is anything but a surprise.” 15.","As for the monk himself, he had vanished without trace, to the great amazement of the crowd. 15 THE TAOIST PRIEST OF MOUNT LAO"

The woman said to herself: ""I have passed judgment on the female soul. I am grateful to Sanglang for his attention, and the scoop is still there. I am really a ghost, what's the benefit of restraining me?"" The woman looked back, bewildered. Or if there is someone who says Sang is sick and returns, the woman will judge the false accusation. The family is suspicious. The eastern neighbor heard about it, went over the wall to peep, and saw Sheng Fang talking to the beautiful woman. Hidden and forced, Zhang Huangjian has lost his place. Neighbors were horrified. Sheng laughed and said, ""Xiang Gu speaks to the king, and the female will listen to him."" The neighbor said Yan'er's words. Life is the beginning of the gate, and I will go to the detective. There is no reason to suffer. Mother Zhang heard that the fruit had not returned, so she was surprised. Therefore, the maid was asked to take her shoes, and she was given out to grant her. Yan'er is happy. Try it, the shoes are smaller than the foot, which is a big shock. Holding the mirror and taking a self-portrait, it suddenly dawned on me that it was because of Chen’s reason that he had borrowed his body to make a living. The mother believed it. The female mirror cried and said: ""The appearance of the day was quite self-confident, and every time I saw Sister Lian, I felt more ashamed. Now if this is the case, people are not as good as ghosts!"" When the quilt is stiff and lying down, if you eat it, you will not eat it, and your body and skin will be completely swollen; if you do not eat for seven days, you will not die, and the swelling will gradually disappear; if you feel hungry, you will eat again. For a few days, itching all over the body, the skin is completely off. When you wake up in the morning, the sleeping scoop is left behind, and if you grab it, you will be huge and have no friends. Because of the test before walking, fat and thin match, is happy. If you look back in the mirror, you will be happy with your eyes and cheeks, just like your life. Washing comb sees her mother, and everyone who sees it is all Yi.","Prior to this, in the wealthy Zhang family, there had been a fifteen-year-old daughter named Yan’er, who suddenly died without any warning signs. In the course of the night, she returned to life, got up, looked around, and wanted to rush off. The Zhangs bolted the door so she couldn’t get out. Yan’er told them, “I am the spirit of an assistant magistrate’s daughter; feeling obliged to a gentleman named Sang, who thinks of me tenderly, I have left my slipper at his house. I’m really a ghost, so what’s the point of holding me here?” Since her words seemed reasonable enough, they asked her why she had come there. The girl lowered her head, pacing nervously and glancing about, unable to explain herself. When someone mentioned that Sang had been sick and had returned to his hometown, the girl insisted it couldn’t be. This quite puzzled her family members. Sang’s neighbor to the east heard about all this, and when he climbed over the wall to sneak a peek, he saw Sang and a lovely woman speaking together; as he quietly entered and pressed onward, Sang’s visitor suddenly vanished from where she’d been. The neighbor, astonished, asked Sang what was going on. Sang laughed, and said, “It’s like I told you: if any women come to visit, I’ll let them in.” His neighbor then repeated Yan’er’s words to him. Sang consequently unbolted his door, and was about to go out and have a look for himself, but had no pretext to do so. Yan’er’s mother heard that he truly had not returned to his hometown, and was most amazed. When she sent an old servant woman to retrieve the slipper, Sang took it right out and gave it to her. Yan’er was delighted. When she tried to put it on, however, the slipper proved too small for her foot by at least an inch, which really shook her up. She grabbed a mirror and looked at her reflection, suddenly realizing that she had come to life in someone else’s body, and then she explained the whole thing to the mother. From then on, the mother began to believe her. The girl faced the mirror and cried, “There was a time when my appearance was nice, and I was quite self-confident, but even so, every time I saw elder sister Lian, I became more and more ashamed. Now my face has changed to this—I’d be better off as a ghost!” She held the slipper and wailed her sorrow inconsolably. Covering herself with a large quilt, she laid down, absolutely stiff. She ate nothing, so her body’s skin became swollen; for seven days she refused food, but still she didn’t die, and the swelling gradually receded; she felt so famished she couldn’t stand it, so she began to eat again. For several days her body itched all over, then all of her skin peeled off. When she got up in the morning, she found that her slippers had fallen off in her sleep, and as she tried to put them on, she discovered they were so large that they no longer fit her. Hence she tried on her former slipper and found its size to be a perfect fit, delighting her. As she looked in the mirror, seeing her own eyebrows, eyes, and cheeks, just as they had always been, her joy increased. She washed and combed her hair before going to see her mother, and those who saw her couldn’t help but stare.","* Now, just before this, in the Zhang family (a local household of some considerable means), a fifteen-year-old girl called Swallow had suddenly fallen ill, and when her illness was aggravated by an inability to perspire, she died. But the very next morning she appeared to come back to life, sat up in bed and wanted to be running around. Her father bolted the door to prevent her from going out. She began talking as if to herself: ‘I am the spirit of the Judge's daughter. A young gentleman named Sang has been very good to me, and is always present in my thoughts. I left one of my slippers with him. I am a ghost, so you will achieve nothing by locking me up.’ Dan Minglun: When she was a ghost, the slipper gave her such pleasure. In her new life, she is still unable to forget it. It is only after her rebirth that she can admit to being a ghost. Her story seemed to make some sort of strange sense, but afterwards, when the Zhang family asked her how she had come to be where she was, and if she was truly who she said she was, she looked around her in a dazed fashion and was quite unable to provide an explanation. One of them told her that Sang was ill, and that he had left town and gone home. But she insisted that this was not true, which greatly perplexed them. Sang's neighbour came to hear of this strange event in the Zhang family and of the various claims made by the girl, and he decided to climb his wall and investigate for himself whether his friend was still at home. He soon saw with his own eyes that Sang, so far from having gone away, was sitting in his studio talking to a beautiful lady. He was creeping in on them when, in the confusion of the moment, the beautiful lady vanished. In utter amazement, he asked Sang what was going on. ‘Didn’t I once say,’ laughed Sang, ‘that if a woman knocked, I would open the door and let her in!’ Dan Minglun: He prevaricates by alluding to a true event in the past. And at the same time our author is able to remind us of the very beginning of his story. The neighbour proceeded to tell him about the miraculous revival of Swallow Zhang and the strange things she had been saying. Sang unlocked his outer door at once, wanting to call on the Zhang family in order to learn more. But he could think of no acceptable pretext for doing so. The girl's mother, Mrs Zhang, had herself meanwhile ascertained to her own great astonishment that the young gentleman named Sang had indeed (as Swallow insisted) never returned home, and she sent one of her serving-women to retrieve the slipper mentioned by Swallow in her deluded ramblings. Sang promptly handed it over, and Swallow was at first overjoyed to have it. But then, when she tried it on, she discovered to her dismay that it was a good inch too small for her. She looked at herself in the mirror, and suddenly to her horror the truth dawned on her: she had come back to life, but in a completely different body. Now she told her new family her entire story, and her mother believed that she was telling the truth. ‘To think that I used to be so vain!’ sobbed Swallow, continuing to look into the mirror. ‘And even then I felt inferior beside Lotus Fragrance! Look at me now! I was prettier by far when I was a ghost!’ She held the slipper in her hand and wept inconsolably, lying there stiff and motionless under her covers from that day forth, and refusing all food. At first her body began to swell. For seven days, she continued to eat nothing and still she did not die. Gradually the swelling subsided, and she began to feel unbearably hungry and started to eat again. After a few days, her body began to itch and her skin fell away, and when she rose one morning, her bedsocks fell off her feet and on to the floor. Picking them up, she saw that they were much too large for her feet; so she tried one of the slippers on again and discovered to her delight that it was now a perfect fit. Looking once more in the mirror, she was overjoyed to see that her features had also been restored to their former beauty. She washed herself, combed her hair and went in to see her mother, everyone staring at her in amazement as she passed by."
一夕，對生零涕。異之。女哽咽曰：“曩以相從日淺，言之恐致駭怪。今日察姑及郎，皆過愛無有異心，直告或無妨乎？妾本狐產。母臨去，以妾托鬼母，相依十餘年，始有今日。妾又無兄弟，所恃者惟君。老母岑寂山阿，無人憐而合厝之，九泉輒爲悼恨。君倘不惜煩費，使地下人消此怨恫，庶養女者不忍溺棄。”生諾之，然慮墳塚迷於荒草。女言無慮。刻日夫婦輿櫬而往。女於荒煙錯楚中，指示墓處，果得媼屍，膚革猶存。女撫哭哀痛。舁歸，尋秦氏墓合葬焉。是夜生夢媼來稱謝，寤而述之。女曰：“妾夜見之，囑勿驚郎君耳。”生恨不邀留。女曰：“彼鬼也。生人多，陽氣勝，何能久居？”生問小榮，曰：“是亦狐，最黠。狐母留以視妾，每攝餌相哺，故德之常不去心；昨問母，雲已嫁之。”由是歲值寒食，夫婦登秦墓，拜掃無缺。女逾年生一子，在懷抱中，不畏生人，見人輒笑，亦大有母風雲。,"Overnight, I was stunned. different. The girl choked up and said, ""I'm afraid that I'm going to be surprised if I say it. Today, I've checked my aunt and my husband, and there is no difference in their love. Is it okay to tell me directly? The concubine is born of a fox. Ghost mother, we have been together for more than ten years, and we are today. The concubine has no brothers, and the only one who relies on is the monarch. The old mother, Cen Jingshan, has no one to pity her, and Jiuquan is full of grief and hatred. With this resentment, the daughter-in-law can't bear to drown and abandon it."" Sheng promises it, but then thinks that the grave is fascinated by the weeds. Women are carefree. The couple went to see each other every day. The woman was in the middle of the deserted smoke, and pointed to the tomb. The female caressed and mourned. After returning home, I searched for Qin's tomb to be buried together. It was Ye Shengmeng who came to thank her, and she said it. The girl said, ""When the concubine sees him at night, I ask her not to startle her husband's ears."" The woman said: ""That ghost is also. There are many people, and the yang qi prevails, so how can I live for a long time?"" Sheng asked Xiaorong, and said: ""It is also a fox, the most embarrassed. Virtue often does not mind; I asked my mother yesterday, and Yun has already married her.” Since it was a cold season, the couple went to Qin’s tomb and worshipped him without any defect. The girl gave birth to a son over a year old. In her arms, she was not afraid of strangers. She smiled when she saw others.","One night, Yingning’s face was streaked with tears. Wang found this very strange. “In the past,” she said, choking back sobs, “because we’d only been together a short while, I was afraid you’d be shocked if I told you something. Now that I see how much you and your mother have gone through for me without resentment or suspicion, being frank with you can’t possibly harm our relationship, can it? The concubine who gave birth to me was a fox. When my mother was about to go away, she left me to be raised by the ghost of my father’s wife, and we’ve depended upon each other for more than ten years, which is why I’ve come to you now. I have no brothers, so I can depend upon no one but you. “My old mother lies alone in the mountains, with no one to pity her or to bury her properly, so she wanders the underworld in grief and sorrow. If the trouble and expense wouldn’t be too great for you, you could take away the pain of someone’s suffering down below and also make the point that adopted daughters are not useless, and shouldn’t be drowned or abandoned.” Wang promised he would take care of it, but he was concerned that the grave might be so obscured by undergrowth that they couldn’t find it. Yingning assured him he didn’t need to worry. On the designated day, they set out with a cart and a coffin. Yingning directed them to a desolate spot in the mists and tangled growth, pointed to show them the gravesite, and indeed they found the old woman’s corpse, her leathery skin still intact. Yingning caressed the body, weeping piteously from the pain of her grieving. They carried the body away, sought for and located the family graves, and buried her there. That night, Wang dreamt that the old woman came to thank him, and when he woke up, he told Yingning. She informed him, “I saw her last night, but she insisted that I not bother you.” Wang was sorry that she hadn’t been invited to stay. Yingning replied, “She’s a ghost. There are so many mortals here that the yang force is overwhelming, so how could she stay here for long?” Wang asked her about Xiaorong, and she explained, “She’s also a fox, and exceedingly crafty. My fox mother asked her to look after me, and she always gave me cakes and other treats, so I owe her a lot and always think about her. Yesterday I asked mother about her, and she said Xiaorong is already married.” Every year on the day of the Cold Food Festival, husband and wife would visit the Qin family graves, paying their respects and sweeping them clean. When a year had passed, Yingning gave birth to a son. Even while he was still a baby in his mother’s arms, he was never afraid of strangers, and laughed at every person he saw, much like his unpredictable mother.","One night, she was sitting with her husband when suddenly she began to weep. He was greatly puzzled. ‘There's something I have never told you,’ she sobbed. ‘I haven’t told you about it before, because we hadn’t known each other very long and I didn’t want to frighten you. But now that I know you better, and I know how much you and your mother love me, I must tell you the truth. ‘I am the daughter of a fox. When my fox-mother went away, she entrusted me to a ghost-mother, who looked after me for ten years. I have no brothers. You are all I have in the world. Now my ghost-mother is lying out there all alone up in the hills, with no one to care for her and to bury her properly by her husband's side. Her soul is wandering unhappily beneath the Nine Springs. ‘I beg you to do one thing for me, if you do not begrudge me the trouble or the expense: bury my ghost-mother properly, set her poor spirit at peace. Then she will cease to grieve, and will know that the child she reared bears her some gratitude, that daughters can be of some value. Perhaps my example may discourage parents from drowning their daughters.’ Wang agreed to do this for her. His only concern was that the old lady's temporary resting place would be too overgrown to find, but Yingning told him not to worry on that score. Shortly afterwards, they both set out, pulling a decent coffin behind them in a cart. Deep in the midst of an overgrown thicket of brambles, Yingning pointed to the makeshift grave, and sure enough there they found the dead body of the old lady of the cottage, her skin still firm on its bones. Yingning took the body in her arms and wept bitterly as together they lifted it into the coffin and on to the cart and transported it to the grave of Mr Qin. And there they buried her next to her former husband. That night, Wang dreamed that the old lady came to thank him. He awoke and told Yingning his dream. ‘I also saw her tonight,’ she said. ‘She told me not to disturbyou.’ Wang regretted that she had not detained the old lady. ‘She is a ghost,’ explained Yingning. ‘There are too many living humans here, the aura surrounding us is too Yang. She could never have stayed long with us.’ Wang asked after the maid from the hamlet, the one called Petal. ‘She is a fox too,’ answered Yingning. ‘ And a very clever one. My fox-mother left her to keep an eye on me. She often brought me things to eat. I shall always be grateful to her for her goodness to me. My ghost-mother told me she is married now.’ Every year, at the Cold Food Festival, without fail, they went to the Qin grave, swept it, and paid their respects to the dead. After a year had passed, Yingning gave birth to a son. Even when he was a babe in arms, he was never afraid of strangers, but always laughed in their presence – just like his mother."

And the island was uninhabited in ancient times, and people rarely visited it. Zhang Sheng from Dengzhou is curious and loves hunting. Hearing his victory, he prepared food and wine, and left the boat. At that point, the flowers are flourishing, and the fragrance can be smelled for several miles; the trees are as large as a dozen or so. Repeatedly lingering, very happy. Open the respect for one's own discretion, hate no travel together. Suddenly a beautiful woman in the flower came, the red dress was dazzling, slightly incomparable. Seeing Zhang, he smiled and said, ""The concubine claims to be very interesting, and she doesn't want to have a coherence first."" Zhang Jing asked who it was. He said, ""I'm a prostitute. It's suitable to come from Hai Gongzi. He is looking for victory soaring, and his concubine is difficult to walk, so I keep this ear."" The woman's words are gentle and dazzling, and Zhang loves it. I am afraid that Young Master Hai will not be able to enjoy it all, because it will cause chaos and chaos. Female Xin follows it. Before the sympathy was over, he suddenly heard the wind being solemn, and there was a sound from the grass and trees. The woman pushed Zhang Qi in a hurry and said, ""Young Master Hai has arrived.""","The Lord of the Sea In the East Sea, on Guji Island, there’s a five-colored flower called Winter’s Survivor, that lives through all four seasons without withering. Since ancient times, no one’s lived on the island, and people rarely visit there. In Dengzhou, there was a scholar named Zhang, who loved encountering the unexpected, enjoying both traveling and hunting. When he heard that Guji Island was a place of natural beauty, he packed some wine and food, found himself a boat, and set off. When he arrived, he noted the multitudes of flowers, their fragrance carrying for several li; and there were trees so large that more than ten people could be fitted around their perimeters. Returning to the sights again and again, reluctant to leave any of them, he felt very contented, enjoying the place tremendously. He opened up his wine, sorry that there wasn’t anyone traveling with him. Suddenly, a beautiful woman appeared among the flowers, dressed in a red skirt that dazzled the eyes, and to put it briefly, she was simply beyond compare. She saw Zhang, smiled, and said, “I figured my interest in this place was unusual, so I didn’t expect there would be someone who shared my enthusiasm.” Zhang, surprised, asked, “Who are you?” She replied, “I’m a courtesan from Jiao prefecture. I traveled here with the Lord of the Sea. He took off to view the scenery, but I was too exhausted to walk any further, so I decided to stay here.” Zhang, who’d been feeling rather lonely, was very pleased to be joined by this beauty, so he invited her to sit and share his wine. The woman spoke with words that were warm and enticing, that could turn a man’s thoughts to licentiousness. Zhang consequently was attracted to her. Worried that the Lord of the Sea might return and that they wouldn’t be able to indulge in their mutual pleasure, he suggested they seize the moment and make love. The woman cheerfully agreed. Their coupled bodies were showing no signs of slowing down, when suddenly they heard an awe-inspiringly powerful wind, accompanied by the sound of trees cracking and falling. The woman, worried, forced Zhang to get up and cried, “The Lord of the Sea has come.” Zhang threw on his clothes and turned back around, stunned to see that the woman was already gone.","On Guji Island – the Island of Antiquities – in the Eastern Sea, jasmine-flowers of every colour bloom throughout the four seasons of the year. But no one has ever lived on the island, and very few visitors make the crossing. A gentleman named Zhang of Dengzhou, who was fond of hunting and adventure, heard tell of this island as an especially beautiful place, and, taking with him provisions and wine, he rowed out to it in a little boat. When he arrived, he saw the jasmine-flowers in full bloom. Their scent wafted several miles. Many of the trees he saw around him were huge, several arm-lengths in circumference. Zhang ambled here and there on the island, enjoying himself enormously, and eventually he sat down and poured himself a cup from his pitcher of wine. His one regret was that he had no companion with whom to share this pleasant moment. Even as this thought entered his mind, a woman of a beauty beyond compare, wearing a dazzling crimson gown, appeared amid the flowers. She smiled when she saw Zhang. ‘Here I was having such a lovely time all on my own. I had no idea that there was another flower-lover here on the island!’ ‘Who are you?’ asked Zhang, greatly taken aback. ‘I am a sing-song girl from Jiaozhou,’ was her reply. ‘I’ve come here with the Sea Prince, and he has gone off on a ramble, to visit some of the sites on the island. I stayed behind, because my little feet give me such trouble walking.’ Zhang, who had just been lamenting his lack of a companion, was overjoyed to find himself with this beautiful young lady and invited her to sit with him and share his wine. She spoke in a soft, entrancing voice, and soon had Zhang completely under her spell. Anxious that the Sea Prince might return at any moment and rob them of their pleasure, he threw his arms around her and began to make love to her. She seemed only too pleased to yield to his advances. Their passion had still not been fully consummated, however, when a sound was heard as of a rushing wind, bending the trees and plants to the ground. The young lady frantically pushed Zhang away from her and rose to her feet, crying, ‘The Prince is coming!’ Zhang did up his clothes and looked around him in alarm. The young lady had already vanished."

The articles and poems were the best at that time, but they were not coincidentally encountered, and they were trapped in the famous field. Meeting Guandong Ding came to order the city by crane, read the text, wondered, called and spoken, and was very happy. Even if the official office receives the light, he will always give money and grain to his family. On the subject test, he was promoted to the school envoy on public tour, and he won the championship. The public expected Qiqie to be cut, and after Qixiao Suowen read it, he sighed in admiration. Unexpectedly, the number of people is limited, the article hates life, and when the list is released, it is still bad. Life and death and return, ashamed of the confidant, the shape is broken and the bones stand, and the madness is like a puppet. When the public heard it, he summoned him to comfort him; he was in tears. Gong Lianzhi, Xiangqi completed the entrance examination and entered the capital, and brought it with him to the north. Life is very admirable. After leaving, Du Men did not leave. No sleep problems. The public bequeathed incessantly asked questions, and taking hundreds of medicines was ineffective.","In Huaiyang, there was a scholar named Ye—I’ve lost track of his first name. He was gifted in the writing of compositions and poetry, which were always first-rate by the time he’d finish them; but he didn’t have good fortune and always failed in the official examinations. Then he became associated with Ding Chenghe, who’d arrived from Guandong to take charge of their political district, and who’d looked at Ye’s writing and been quite impressed by it; Ye was invited to speak with him, and the resulting exchange absolutely delighted Ding. He immediately provided Ye with an office in the government building and lights to study by; at times, he even gave him money and food to provide for his family. On the occasion of the preliminary examination that preceded the triennial imperial examinations, Magistrate Ding roundly praised Ye’s learning to the imperial examiner and consequently he was considered the best of a group of examinees. The magistrate expected he would surely produce an excellent examination. After Ye had taken the county examination, Ding asked to see what he’d written and read it aloud, beating out the cadences and praising them. But expectations are often frustrated, and his compositions were fated to be rejected, so when the list of successful candidates was released, as usual he had failed again. Ye was demoralized and returned home, ashamed that his dear friend had trusted him to succeed, so his appearance began to deteriorate until he was reduced almost to bones and looked as senseless as a wooden figure. Magistrate Ding received news of this, summoned him, and upon his arrival attempted to console him. Ye’s tears fell like rain that would not cease. Ding, pitying him, suggested that when the time came for him to go to the capital to give a full account of his own work, he could bring Ye along to take part in everything there. Ye was very moved and grateful. Taking his leave and returning home, he closed his doors and refused to venture out. In no time he was confined to bed by illness. Magistrate Ding continually sent inquiries and help; Ye took over a hundred doses of Chinese traditional medicines, but they had no effect at all.","There was a gentleman of Huaiyang by the name of Ye. (His other names I cannot recall.) He was acknowledged by his contemporaries to be a master of prose and verse composition, but had been unlucky and had never yet succeeded in his first-degree examination. Now a certain Ding Chenghe – Crane Rider – who hailed from the north-east was appointed Magistrate in Ye's district and, happening to read one of his essays, was most struck by the beauty of his prose. He summoned him and in the course of conversation found himself taking an immediate liking to him. He invited him to come and continue his studies in the official yamen, and provided him with a regular stipend and occasional gifts of money and grain to support his family. When it came to the time for the preliminary examination, Ding spoke highly of Ye to the Examiner, and as a result he was ranked among the most promising candidates. After the first-degree examination proper, Magistrate Ding, who had entertained the highest hopes for Ye, obtained his draft essay and was ecstatic in its praise. But for some reason fate was against Ye yet again, however fine his essay may have been. When the results were posted, his name was nowhere to be seen on the list, and he made his way home a hugely disappointed man, full of remorse at having failed his friend and patron in this manner. He began to waste away and became as listless and dead to the world as a wooden puppet. Magistrate Ding heard of this and summoned him to the yamen, where he did his best to console the young man, who wept without ceasing. Ding felt sorry for him and by way of consolation offered to take him along with him when he next went up to the capital for his own triennial review. Ye was most grateful to him for his solicitude, but bade him farewell and returned home, where he shut himself away, refused to go out and in a short while fell seriously ill. Ding sent a string of messengers to inquire about his health, and prevailed upon Ye to take countless sorts of medicine, but all to no effect."

Suddenly I saw a small person returning to the dormitory, carrying a felt bag as big as a fist, and actually built it under the bed. Bai Yan: ""The owner of the house has the manners of not being shy, and he will present it to the Grand Historian."" The words have been spoken, and they are opposed, that is, they do not state their things. Shaojian laughed to himself again and said, ""It's useless to think about Taishi, so it's better to give it to the villain."" Taishi nodded. Happy to take it with you. See you later. It is a pity that Tai Shi Zhong was discouraged, and he never questioned him.","There once was a certain court historian, whose name I’ve forgotten. While he was laying down for a daytime nap in his study, there suddenly appeared a miniature honor guard, emerging from a corner of his room. The horses were only as large as frogs, and the people no bigger than fingers. The little troop included some ten squads; an official in a black silk cap, wearing a ceremonial gown, was riding in a sedan chair as droves of figures passed into the room and went out through the doorway. The historian found this pretty strange, but figured since he’d been sleeping, it was all just his imagination. Suddenly he saw a little man reenter the room, carrying a stuffed cloth bag, the size of a fist. Eventually he made his way to the historian’s bed and set it down. Then he announced, “My master respectfully wishes to offer this modest gift to you, sir.” When he finished speaking, he stood facing the historian, but without delivering whatever was in the bag. After a bit, the little man laughed and said, “I imagine a historian wouldn’t have any use for such a tiny, tiny thing, so it’d probably be better to give it to me.” The historian nodded his approval. Joyfully, the little man picked up the bag and departed. It’s a pity that in his shock, the historian didn’t think to ask where the little man was from. 63.","A certain Hanlin Academician, whose name I can no longer remember, was dozing in his study during the daytime, when suddenly he saw a little procession filing through the room. There were horses the size of frogs, men less than finger-high, a retinue of several dozen insignia-bearers, and then a mandarin in a palanquin, wearing a black gauze cap and a ceremonial gown with an embroidered border, who was carried out through the doorway with great pomp. The Academician marvelled greatly to himself at this extraordinary sight, and wondered if perhaps his sleepy eyes were playing a trick on him. Then one of the little men turned back into the room and came towards his bed, carrying a small fist-sized bundle, wrapped in felt. ‘My master,’ he declared, ‘apologizes for seeming impolite, sir, and wishes to make you a present of this.’ The little man stood there but showed no sign of presenting either the bundle or anything else. A little later he chuckled to himself. ‘Such a trifle – I didn’t think you would have much use for it, sir! You might as well give it to me…’ The Academician nodded, and the little man set off happily once more, carrying the bundle on his back, and was soon lost to view. And the shame of it was that the Academician had been too timid to ask him who they all were."
