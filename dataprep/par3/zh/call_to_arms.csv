这村庄的习惯有点特别，女人生下孩子，多喜欢用秤称了轻重，便用斤数当作小名。九斤老太自从庆祝了五十大寿以后，便渐渐的变了不平家，常说伊年青的时候，天气没有现在这般热，豆子也没有现在这般硬：总之现在的时世是不对了。何况六斤比伊的曾祖，少了三斤，比伊父亲七斤，又少了一斤，这真是一条颠扑不破的实例。所以伊又用劲说，“这真是一代不如一代！”,"The habit of this village is a bit special. When a woman gives birth to a child, she likes to use a scale to weigh the weight, so she uses the catty as a nickname. Since the old lady Jiujin celebrated her 50th birthday, her family has gradually changed. It is often said that when Yi was young, the weather was not as hot as it is now, and the beans were not as hard as they are now: In short, the current world is wrong. . What's more, 6 jin is less than Yi's great-grandfather, 3 jin less than Yi's father, and 1 jin less than Yi's father. This is really an unbreakable example. So Yi said vigorously again, ""This is really a generation that is not as good as a generation!""","‘It wasn’t like this in my day…’ A footnote about the idiosyncrasies of this particular village: when a woman had a baby, the custom was to nickname it by birthweight. Since she had celebrated the great milestone of her fiftieth birthday, Mrs Nine-Pounds’s general sense of grievance against the world had been steadily growing: the weather was much hotter than it had been when she’d been young, she became fond of saying; the beans much harder. Everything, in sum, was wrong with the here and now. And Six-Pounds – three pounds lighter at birth than her esteemed great-grandmother, and a pound lighter than her father, Seven-Pounds – offered living proof of this irrefutable process of decline. ‘The youth of today…’","Each generation is worse than the last.” It was the somewhat unusual custom in this village for mothers to weigh their children at birth and to call them the number of pounds they happened to weigh. Since Old Mrs. Ninepounder's celebration of her fiftieth birthday she had gradually become a fault-finder, for ever complaining that in her young days the summer had not been so hot nor the beans so tough as now. In a word, there was something wrong with the present-day world. Why else had Sixpounder weighed three pounds less than her greatgrandfather and one pound less than her father, Sevenpounder? Surely this was irrefutable evidence. So she reiterated emphatically, “Yes, indeed. Each generation is worse than the last.”"
他虽然也缺钱，但从没有加入教员的团体内，大家议决罢课，可是不去上课了。政府说“上了课才给钱”，他才略恨他们的类乎用果子耍猴子；一个大教育家[4]说道“教员一手挟书包一手要钱不高尚”，他才对于他的太太正式的发牢骚了。,"Although he was also short of money, he never joined the group of teachers. Everyone decided to strike, but he stopped going to class. The government said that ""they will only give money after class"", and he hated them a little bit like playing monkeys with fruits; a great educator[4] said that ""it's not noble for a teacher to ask for money with a schoolbag in one hand"", and only then did he formally treat his wife. groaned.","Although he was as short of money as any of his university colleagues, he’d never joined the teachers’ union. When everyone decided to go on strike, however, he cancelled his classes with the rest of them. And he didn’t like it more than anyone else when the government said that lecturers would get paid only when they started teaching again – as if they were monkeys that needed bringing to heel with the promise of bananas. It was on the day that one of the country’s great educationalists attacked Fang’s esteemed profession for their mercenary absence of dignity, for ‘holding their lecture notes in one hand, and asking for money with the other’, that he was at last roused to make a formal complaint to his wife. ‘Hey!’ he observed, surveying the dinner table.","Although he, too, was hard up, he never joined the teachers' union; but when the others decided to go on strike he stayed away from class. The government ultimatum, “No pay till classes are resumed,” annoyed him, because this seemed like tempting a monkey with fruit. However, not until an outstanding educationist said, “It is in poor taste for teachers, a briefcase in one hand, to hold out the other for money,” did he make any formal complaint to his wife."
“他只说没有没有，我说你自己当面说去，他还要说，我说……”邹七嫂气喘吁吁的走着说。,"""He only said no, no, I said you can say it to your face, and he has to say it, I say..."" Sister-in-law Zou Qi said panting as she walked.","‘He keeps on saying he hasn’t anything left,’ Mrs Zou reported, rather out of breath. ‘ I said he should tell you in person, but he still kept on, so I said…’","“He keeps saying he has nothing left,” panted Mrs. Zou as she came in. “When I told him to come and tell you so himself he kept talking back."
真的，一直到现在，我实在再没有吃到那夜似的好豆，——也不再看到那夜似的好戏了。,"Really, until now, I really haven't eaten the good beans like that night, and I don't see the good show like that night anymore.","Truly, I’ve never since eaten beans as delicious – or enjoyed an opera so much.","It is a fact, right up till now, I have really never eaten such good beans or seen such a good opera as I did that night."
“革命也好罢，”阿Q想，“革这伙妈妈的的命，太可恶！太可恨！……便是我，也要投降革命党了。”,"""Revolution is fine,"" Ah Q thought. ""It's too hateful to kill these mothers! It's too hateful! .",‘Hurrah for revolution!’ Ah-Q thought. ‘It’ll do for the whole rotten lot of them! …,"“Revolution is not a bad thing,” thought Ah Q. “Finish off the whole lot of them... curse them!... I'd like to go over to the revolutionaries myself. ”"
我又点一点头，说道，“很好。”,"I nodded again and said, ""Fine.""","‘Oh, yes,’ I nodded again. ‘Ha!",I nodded again.
孔乙己是这样的使人快活，可是没有他，别人也便这么过。,"Kong Yiji makes people happy like this, but without him, others would live in the same way.","And so it was that Kong Yiji spread joy wherever he went; though when he wasn’t around, we barely missed him.","That was how Kong Yiji contributed to our enjoyment, but we got along all right without him too."
“我……”,"""I……""",Mr Foreigner at last located the source of the interruption. ‘I – ’,“I...”
“我最佩服北京双十节的情形。早晨，警察到门，吩咐道‘挂旗！’‘是，挂旗！’各家大半懒洋洋的踱出一个国民来，撅起一块斑驳陆离的洋布[2]。这样一直到夜，——收了旗关门；几家偶然忘却的，便挂到第二天的上午。,"""I admire the situation of the Double Tenth Festival in Beijing the most. In the morning, the police came to the door and ordered, 'Hold up the flag!' 'Yes, hang up the flag!' Most of the families walked lazily out of a citizen, holding up a mottled foreign cloth. 2]. This continued until the night, when the flag was closed and the doors were closed; for those who accidentally forgot, they hung up until the next morning.","‘Oh, they know how to celebrate Double Tenth in Beijing. First thing, a policeman turns up and orders you to Fly the Flag! Yes, yes, officer, mumbles your model citizen, sleepwalking out to stick a faded old rag up. Then comes back out when it gets dark, takes it down and shuts up shop. Unless he forgets, of course, and leaves it up overnight. What does the Revolution mean to him? What does he mean to the Revolution?","“The Double Tenth Festival in Beijing strikes me as admirable,” he observed. “In the morning a policeman comes to your gate to order, ‘Put up a flag.’ ‘A flag, right!’ Most families lackadaisically bring out a national flag, and that cloth of many colours is hung up till the evening, when they take it down and shut the gate. A few may forget and leave it up till the next morning."
万分沉重，动弹不得；他的意思是要我死。我晓得他的沉重是假的，便挣扎出来，出了一身汗。可是偏要说，,"Too heavy to move; he meant to kill me. Knowing that his heaviness was fake, I struggled out, sweating. But I would say,","They pinned me to the ground; they meant me to die beneath them. But I struggled through my illusion, drenching myself in sweat.","The weight was so great, I couldn't move. They meant that I should die. However, knowing that the weight was false I struggled out, dripping with sweat. But I had to warn them:"
我于是又很盼望下雪。,So I was looking forward to snow again.,Now all I wanted was for it to snow.,Accordingly I looked forward very eagerly to snow.
我怕得有理。,I'm justifiably afraid.,I have reason to be afraid.,I have reason for my fear.
阿Q这才站住，歪着头问道，“什么？”,"Ah Q then stopped, tilted his head and asked, ""What?""","‘What?’ Ah-Q asked, finally drawing to a halt and turning to face them.",Only then did Ah Q come to a stop.
这时候，我又懂得一件他们的巧妙了。他们岂但不肯改，而且早已布置；预备下一个疯子名目罩上我。将来吃了，不但太平无事，怕还会有人见情。佃户说的大家吃了一个恶人，正是这方法。这是他们的老谱！,"At this time, I learned another trick of theirs. Not only are they unwilling to change, but they have already made arrangements; they are preparing to cover me with the name of the next lunatic. If you eat it in the future, not only will it be peaceful, but I am afraid that some people will see you in love. The tenants said that everyone ate a villain, which is exactly the method. This is their old track!","Another of their ingenious devices: to discredit me as insane. The plot was too well laid; they would never change. And when the moment arrived for me to be eaten, there would be not a murmur of opposition, only sympathy for my butchers. Death by character assassination – a method tried and tested by the farmers of Wolf Cub Village.","Then I realized part of their cunning. They would never be willing to change their stand, and their plans were all laid: they had labelled me a madman. In future when I was eaten, not only would there be no trouble but people would probably be grateful to them. When our tenant spoke of the villagers eating a bad character, it was exactly the same device. This is their old trick."
“你到外面来，……不要躲在自己房里想……”,"""Come outside...don't hide in your room thinking...""",‘Come on out.’,“Come outside... don't stay brooding in your own room.”
我不知道有多少中国人只因为这不痛不痒的头发而吃苦，受难，灭亡。”,"I don't know how many Chinese people suffer, suffer and perish just because of this innocuous hair. ""","But how many Chinese have suffered, or even died because of it?’","“Hair is insignificant, yet I've no idea how many Chinese suffered or died just on account of it.”"
中秋过后，秋风是一天凉比一天，看看将近初冬；我整天的靠着火，也须穿上棉袄了。一天的下半天，没有一个顾客，我正合了眼坐着。忽然间听得一个声音，“烫一碗酒。”这声音虽然极低，却很耳熟。看时又全没有人。站起来向外一望，那孔乙己便在柜台下对了门槛坐着。他脸上黑而且瘦，已经不成样子；穿一件破夹袄，盘着两腿，下面垫一个蒲包，用草绳在肩上挂住；见了我，又说道，“烫一碗酒。”掌柜也伸出头去，一面说，“孔乙己么？你还欠十九个钱呢！”孔乙己很颓唐的仰面答道，“这……下回还清罢。这一回是现钱，酒要好。”掌柜仍然同平常一样，笑着对他说，“孔乙己，你又偷了东西了！”但他这回却不十分分辩，单说了一句“不要取笑！”“取笑？要是不偷，怎么会打断腿？”孔乙己低声说道，“跌断，跌，跌……”他的眼色，很像恳求掌柜，不要再提。此时已经聚集了几个人，便和掌柜都笑了。我热了酒，端出去，放在门槛上。他从破衣袋里摸出四文大钱，放在我手里，见他满手是泥，原来他便用这手走来的。不一会，他喝完酒，便又在旁人的说笑声中，坐着用这手慢慢走去了。,"After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the autumn wind is getting cooler every day, and it is almost early winter; I have to wear a padded jacket all day by relying on the fire. For the second half of the day, without a single customer, I was sitting with my eyes closed. Suddenly I heard a voice, ""Hot a bowl of wine."" Although the voice was extremely low, it was very familiar. There was no one at all when I saw it. Standing up and looking out, Kong Yiji was sitting under the counter facing the threshold. His face was black and thin, and he was out of shape; he wore a ragged jacket, with his legs crossed, a pouf under it, and a straw rope hanging over his shoulders; when he saw me, he said, ""Hot a bowl of wine. The shopkeeper also stuck his head out and said, ""Kong Yiji? You still owe nineteen dollars!"" Kong Yiji replied with a sullen face, ""This... let's pay it off next time. This time it's cash, The wine is better."" The shopkeeper was still the same as usual, smiling and saying to him, ""Kong Yiji, you stole something again!"" But this time he didn't make a very clear distinction, just said ""Don't make fun of it!"" ""To make fun of? If If you don't steal, how can you break your leg?"" Kong Yiji whispered, ""Fall, fall, fall..."" His wink was like begging the shopkeeper not to mention it again. At this time, a few people had gathered, and both the shopkeeper and the shopkeeper laughed. I warmed the wine, took it out, and placed it on the threshold. He took out a large sum of four coins from the ragged pocket and put it in my hand. Seeing that his hand was covered in mud, it turned out that he used this hand to come here. After a while, he finished drinking, and then sat down and walked slowly with this hand amid the chatter and laughter of others.","Mid-Autumn Festival went by, and the wind grew colder with every day that passed; winter, it seemed, was not far off. Every day I spent huddled up next to the fire, wrapped in my padded jacket. And there I was one afternoon, with no other customers about, all ready to doze off, when a muffled but familiar voice interrupted: ‘ Warm me a bowl of wine.’ I looked up: no one in sight. But when I hauled myself to my feet, I spotted Kong Yiji sitting at the foot of the bar, facing the door. He looked terrible: his face grey, gaunt, a thin, ragged cotton jacket over his shoulders, his legs crossed beneath him, sitting on a rush sack that he kept in place with a straw rope. ‘Warm me a bowl of wine,’ he repeated when he caught sight of me. ‘ Is that Kong Yiji?’ the manager craned forward. ‘You still owe me nineteen coppers!’ Kong Yiji looked despondently up at him. ‘I… I’ll bring it next time. I can pay cash today, so make it a drop of the good stuff.’ ‘Stealing again, Kong Yiji?’ the manager grinned, going through the usual motions. This time, however, Kong was capable of nothing but weak protest: ‘Don’t make fun of me!’ ‘It was your stealing that got your legs broken in the first place!’ ‘I had a bad fall… just a fall…’ Kong Yiji muttered, his eyes beseeching the manager to close the subject. But by this point, he had already acquired an audience. I warmed the wine, carried it out and placed it on the doorsill. Drawing four coppers out of a pocket in his tattered jacket, he placed them in my hand. His own hand, I saw, was filthy from dragging himself along the ground. Soon enough, he finished his wine and then, amid further laughter from the assembled company, dragged himself off again.","My boss asked no further questions but went on slowly making up his accounts. After the Mid-Autumn Festival the wind grew daily colder as winter approached, and even though I spent all my time by the stove I had to wear a padded jacket. One afternoon, when the tavern was deserted, as I sat with my eyes closed I heard the words: “Warm a bowl of wine.” It was said in a low but familiar voice. I opened my eyes. There was no one to be seen. I stood up to look out. There below the bar, facing the door, sat Kong Yiji. His face was thin and grimy—he looked a wreck. He had on a ragged lined jacket and was squatting cross-legged on a mat which was attached to his shoulders by a straw rope. When he saw me he repeated: “Warm a bowl of wine.” At this point my boss leaned over the bar to ask, “ Is that Kong Yiji? You still owe nineteen coppers.” “That... I'll settle next time.” He looked up dejectedly. “Here's cash. Give me some good wine.” My boss, just as in the past, chuckled and said: “Kong Yiji, you've been stealing again!” But instead of stout denial, the answer simply was: “Don't joke with me.” “Joke? How did your legs get broken if you hadn't been stealing?” “I fell,” whispered Kong Yiji. “ Broke them in a fall.” His eyes pleaded with the boss to let the matter drop. By now several people had gathered round, and they all laughed with the boss. I warmed the wine, carried it over, and set it on the threshold. He produced four coppers from his ragged coat pocket, and as he placed them in my hand I saw that his own hands were covered with mud—he must have crawled there on them. Presently he finished the wine and, to the accompaniment of taunts and laughter, slowly pushed himself off with his hands."

老兄，你可知道头发是我们中国人的宝贝和冤家，古今来多少人在这上头吃些毫无价值的苦呵！,"Dude, do you know that hair is the treasure and enemy of our Chinese people, how many people from ancient and modern times have suffered worthless suffering on it!","‘Remember that for us Chinese, our hair is our pride and fall.

这时候，单四嫂子正抱着他的宝儿，坐在床沿上，纺车静静的立在地上。黑沉沉的灯光，照着宝儿的脸，绯红里带一点青。单四嫂子心里计算：神签也求过了，愿心也许过了，单方也吃过了，要是还不见效，怎么好？——那只有去诊何小仙了。但宝儿也许是日轻夜重，到了明天，太阳一出，热也会退，气喘也会平的：这实在是病人常有的事。,"At this time, the fourth sister-in-law was holding his treasure, sitting on the edge of the bed, with the spinning wheel standing quietly on the ground. The dark light shone on Bo'er's face, with a hint of blue in the crimson. Shan Si's sister-in-law calculated in her heart: I have asked for the divine lottery, maybe I have passed my wish, and I have taken it unilaterally. If it still doesn't work, how good? ——Then only go to see He Xiaoxian. But Baoer may be light and heavy at night. Tomorrow, as soon as the sun comes out, the heat will subside and the asthma will be relieved: this is really a common thing for patients.","At this moment, Mrs Shan next door was sitting on the edge of the bed, cradling her son, Bao’er, as the spinning wheel stood silently by. The dingy lamplight illuminated the pallor beneath his crimson flush. She had drawn lots, she had beseeched the gods, she was thinking to herself; she had even given him medicine. What else was there left for her to do? The only person she hadn’t yet tried was Dr Ho Xiaoxian. But maybe Bao’er was always worse at night; once the sun came up, his fever would subside, his breathing get easier – it was often like that with illnesses.","Meanwhile Fourth Shan's Wife was sitting on the edge of her bed, Pao-erh—her treasure—in her arms, while her loom stood silent on the floor. The murky lamplight fell on Paoerh's face, which showed livid beneath a feverish flush. ""I've drawn lots before the shrine,"" she was thinking. ""I've made a vow to the gods, he's taken the guaranteed cure. If he still doesn't get better, what can I do? I shall have to take him to Dr. Ho Hsiao-hsien. But maybe Pao-erh's only bad at night; when the sun comes out tomorrow his fever may go and he may breathe more easily again. A lot of illnesses are like that."""
阿Q第三次抓出栅栏门的时候，便是举人老爷睡不着的那一夜的明天的上午了。他到了大堂，上面还坐着照例的光头老头子，阿Q也照例的下了跪。,"The third time Ah Q grabbed out of the fence gate, it was the morning of tomorrow that night when Master Juren couldn't sleep. When he arrived at the lobby, the usual bald old man was sitting there, and Ah Q knelt down as usual.","It was the morning after this spat that Ah-Q was yanked out from behind the wooden bars for the third time. When he entered the hall, the bald old man was sitting, as before, at the back of the room. As before, Ah-Q knelt.","The third time that Ah Q was dragged out of the grille-door was the morning following the night on which the successful provincial candidate had been unable to sleep.

他们的眼睛都已老花多年了，但望这红白的花，却还能明白看见。花也不很多，圆圆的排成一个圈，不很精神，倒也整齐。华大妈忙看他儿子和别人的坟，却只有不怕冷的几点青白小花，零星开着；便觉得心里忽然感到一种不足和空虚，不愿意根究。那老女人又走近几步，细看了一遍，自言自语的说，“这没有根，不像自己开的。——这地方有谁来呢？孩子不会来玩；——亲戚本家早不来了。——这是怎么一回事呢？”他想了又想，忽又流下泪来，大声说道：——,"Their eyes have been old for many years, but they can still clearly see the red and white flowers. There are not many flowers, they are arranged in a circle, not very spiritual, but neat. Aunt Hua was busy looking at the graves of his son and others, but there were only a few small green and white flowers that were not afraid of the cold, and they were blooming sporadically. The old woman took a few steps closer, took a closer look, and said to herself, ""This has no roots, it's not like I drove it by myself. - Who is going to this place? Children won't come to play; - Relatives The family is long gone.—What is going on here?” He thought and thought, and suddenly burst into tears, and said loudly:—","But when she looked a little closer, she shivered with surprise: across the grave’s rounded peak lay a wreath of red and white flowers, clearly visible even to eyes long cloudy with old age. Though not the most extravagant or the freshest of wreaths, it was tidily woven. Hua Dama glanced across at her son’s grave, at other graves, scattered only with hardy little bluish-white flowers undaunted by the cold. She was unaccountably troubled by a sense of dissatisfaction, or inadequacy. Taking a few steps closer, the second old woman studied the wreath more closely. ‘Cut flowers,’ she observed, as if talking to herself. ‘They couldn’t have grown round here… Who might have left them? Children never play round here… my relatives haven’t visited for ages… What are they doing here?’ She sank deep into thought. ‘Yu’er,’ she suddenly cried out, her face streaming with tears.","Both of them suffered from failing eyesight, yet they could see these red and white flowers clearly. There were not many, but they were placed in a circle; and although not very fresh, were neatly set out. Little Shuan's mother looked round and found her own son's grave, like most of the rest, dotted with only a few little, pale flowers shivering in the cold. Suddenly she had a sense of futility and stopped feeling curious about the wreath. Meantime the old woman had gone up to the grave to look more closely. “They have no roots,” she said to herself. “They can't have grown here. Who could have been here? Children don't come here to play, and none of our relatives have ever been. What could have happened?” She puzzled over it, until suddenly her tears began to fall, and she cried aloud:"
下午，他拣好了几件东西：两条长桌，四个椅子，一副香炉和烛台，一杆抬秤。他又要所有的草灰（我们这里煮饭是烧稻草的，那灰，可以做沙地的肥料），待我们启程的时候，他用船来载去。,"In the afternoon, he picked out a few things: two long tables, four chairs, a pair of incense burners and candlesticks, and a scale. He also asked for all the ashes (we use straw for cooking here, and the ashes can be used as fertilizer for the sandy land), and when we set off, he would carry them by boat.","That afternoon, he chose two rectangular tables, four chairs, an incense-burner and candlesticks and a large steelyard. He also said he’d take our straw ash (the stove in our kitchen burned rice straw, and its ashes were good for sandy soil).","That afternoon he picked out a number of things: two long tables, four chairs, an incense-burner and candlesticks, and one balance.

华大妈见这样子，生怕他伤心到快要发狂了；便忍不住立起身，跨过小路，低声对他说，“你这位老奶奶不要伤心了，——我们还是回去罢。”,"Seeing this, Aunt Hua was afraid that he would be so sad that he was about to go mad; she couldn't help standing up, crossed the path, and whispered to him, ""Don't be sad, you old lady, we'll just go back.""","Fearing that the woman was almost maddened by grief, Hua Dama rose to her feet and crossed over. ‘ Try not to upset yourself,’ she murmured.","Fearing sorrow might send her out of her mind, Old Shuan's wife got up and stepped across the path, to say quietly, “Don't grieve, let's go home.”"
然而谣言很旺盛，说举人老爷虽然似乎没有亲到，却有一封长信，和赵家排了“转折亲”。赵太爷肚里一轮，觉得于他总不会有坏处，便将箱子留下了，现就塞在太太的床底下。至于革命党，有的说是便在这一夜进了城，个个白盔白甲：穿着崇正皇帝的素[41]。,"However, the rumors are very strong, saying that although Master Juren did not seem to be there, he has a long letter and arranged a ""turning relationship"" with the Zhao family. Mr. Zhao felt a round in his stomach, feeling that there would be no harm in him, so he left the box and stuffed it under his wife's bed now. As for the revolutionary party, some say that they entered the city that night, all in white helmets and white armor: wearing the clothes of Emperor Chongzheng[41].","But still the rumours flourished: although the great man of learning had not come in person, it was reported, he had sent in his place a long letter tracing out a distant family connection with the Zhaos. After careful consideration, Mr Zhao decided it wouldn’t do him any harm to hold on to the trunks, and stowed them under his wife’s bed. The revolutionaries, others said, had entered the town that very night, dressed in white armour and helmets, in mourning for the last emperor of the Ming, whose suicide three and a half centuries earlier had left the imperial throne open to the invading Manchus.","Then a rumour spread to the effect that although the scholar had not come in person, he had sent a long letter tracing some distant relationship with the Zhao family; and since Mr. Zhao after thinking it over had decided it could after all do him no harm to keep the cases, they were now stowed under his wife's bed. As for the revolutionaries, some people said they had entered the town that night in white helmets and white armour—in-mourning for Emperor Chong Zhen."
忽然来了一个人；年纪不过二十左右，相貌是不很看得清楚，满面笑容，对了我点头，他的笑也不像真笑。我便问他，“吃人的事，对么？”他仍然笑着说，“不是荒年，怎么会吃人。”我立刻就晓得，他也是一伙，喜欢吃人的；便自勇气百倍，偏要问他。,"Suddenly, a man appeared; he was only about twenty years old, his appearance was not very clear, and he was smiling. He nodded to me, but his smile was not like a real smile. I asked him, ""It's about cannibalism, right?"" He still smiled and said, ""It's not a famine year, how can you eat people."" I knew immediately that he was also a group and liked to eat people; Hundred times, I want to ask him.","Suddenly, another visitor. A young man, barely in his twenties, his features a blur – except for his broad grin. He greeted me with a nod; I found no sincerity in his smile. ‘Is it right to eat people?’ I asked him. ‘What are you talking about?’ – his smile did not flicker. ‘ No one’s eating anyone; it’s not a famine year.’ I knew then that he, too, was of their number: that he too feasted on human flesh. Screwing my courage, I determined to press him further.","Suddenly someone came in. He was only about twenty years old and I did not see his features very clearly. His face was wreathed in smiles, but when he nodded to me his smile didn't seem genuine. I asked him, “Is it right to eat human beings?” Still smiling, he replied, “When there is no famine how can one eat human beings?” I realized at once he was one of them; but still I summoned up courage to repeat my question:"

他们走不上二三十步远，忽听得背后“哑——”的一声大叫；两个人都竦然的回过头，只见那乌鸦张开两翅，一挫身，直向着远处的天空，箭也似的飞去了。,"They couldn't walk more than twenty or thirty paces, when suddenly they heard a loud cry of ""dumb--"" behind them; both of them turned their heads, only to see the crow spread its wings, slumped, and headed straight into the distance. In the sky, the arrow flew away.","After a couple of dozen paces, a loud caw broke the silence behind them.

Startled, they looked round and saw the crow stretch its wings, brace itself to take off, then fly like an arrow towards the far horizon."
七斤嫂呆了一刻，忽而恍然大悟的道，“这可好了，这不是又要皇恩大赦了么！”,"Sister-in-law Qijin was stunned for a moment, and then suddenly realized, ""That's great, isn't this an amnesty from the emperor again!""","‘Well, that’s all for the good,’ his wife broke the brief, stunned silence. ‘There’ll be an amnesty, won’t there?’","Mrs. Sevenpounder looked blank for a moment. Suddenly taking in the news she cried, “Good! That means another general amnesty, doesn't it?”"
“唔，……这个……”阿Q候他略停，终于用十二分的勇气开口了，但不知道因为什么，又并不叫他洋先生。,"""Well,...this..."" Ah Q waited for him to pause for a moment, and finally spoke with twelve points of courage, but for some unknown reason, he didn't call him Mr. Yang.","‘Errrr… Is… this…’ Ah-Q plucked up courage to croak, during a brief détente. For some reason, at the last moment he decided against Mr Foreigner.","“Er—well—” Ah Q waited for him to pause, then screwed up his courage to speak. But for some reason or other he still did not call him Mr. Foreigner."
大家都怃然，没有话。赵太爷父子回家，晚上商量到点灯。赵白眼回家，便从腰间扯下搭连来，交给他女人藏在箱底里。,"Everyone was stunned and speechless. Mr. Zhao and his son went home and discussed the lighting at night. When Zhao Baiyan went home, he ripped it off from his waist and handed it to the woman to hide in the bottom of the box.","A despondent silence fell over the group. Father and son went back inside, and the two of them talked the whole business over until it was time to light the evening lamps. Zhao Baiyan went home and gave his wife the purse from his belt to hide at the bottom of a chest.",This left them in speechless dismay. Back home that evening Mr. Zhao and his son discussed the question until it was time to light the lamps. And Zhao Baiyan once home took the purse from his waist and gave it to his wife to hide for him at the bottom of a chest.
“走到那里去了呢？说出来便放你了。”老头子更和气了。,"""Where did you go? I'll let you go."" The old man became even more kind.","‘Where did they go?’ the old man pressed, even more benignly.","“Where are they now? When you have told me I will let you go,” repeated the old man even more gently."
七斤慢慢地抬起头来，叹一口气说，“皇帝坐了龙庭了。”,"Qijin slowly raised his head, sighed and said, ""The emperor is sitting in the Dragon Court.""","The emperor’s back,’ he sighed.",Sevenpounder slowly raised his head and sighed. “There's an emperor again on the Dragon Throne.”
一九二二年十月,October 1922,October 1922,October 1922
他既已表同情于教员的索薪，自然也赞成同寮的索俸，然而他仍然安坐在衙门中，照例的并不一同去讨债。至于有人疑心他孤高，那可也不过是一种误解罢了。他自己说，他是自从出世以来，只有人向他来要债，他从没有向人去讨过债，所以这一端是“非其所长”。而且他最不敢见手握经济之权的人物，这种人待到失了权势之后，捧着一本《大乘起信论》[7]讲佛学的时候，固然也很是“蔼然可亲”的了，但还在宝座上时，却总是一副阎王脸，将别人都当奴才看，自以为手操着你们这些穷小子们的生杀之权。他因此不敢见，也不愿见他们。这种脾气，虽然有时连自己也觉得是孤高，但往往同时也疑心这其实是没本领。,"Since he had expressed his sympathy for the teacher's demand for salary, he naturally agreed with the salary demand of the co-lior, but he still sat in the yamen, and as usual did not go to collect debts together. As for some people's suspicion that he is arrogant, that's just a misunderstanding. He himself said that since he was born, only people have come to him for debts, and he has never asked anyone to collect debts, so this end is ""not his strength."" Moreover, he is the most afraid of seeing people who hold economic power. After such people lose their power, when they hold a copy of ""The Awakening of Faith in the Mahayana""[7], they are of course very ""amiable and amiable."" ""Yes, but when he was still on the throne, he always had the face of the king of hell, treating others as slaves, thinking that he was in control of the life and death of you poor boys. He did not dare to see them, nor did he want to see them. This kind of temper, although sometimes even I feel lonely, but often at the same time I suspect that it is actually incompetent.","Given, then, that he had already expressed sympathy for the plight of his fellow academics, he very naturally approved the demands of his government colleagues. Yet still he sat in his bureau, docilely bureaucratizing, letting others go and call in the debt on his behalf. Not because he felt it was below his dignity to go in person; do not jump to such a rashly mistaken conclusion. Instead, he pleaded inexperience. He had never, he said, collected a debt in his life – he had always been the target of debt-collectors. Menacing defaulters, therefore, was not one of his areas of specialism. Encounters with financial authorities turned him weak at the knees at the best of times. Take their powers over purse strings away, and they became meek as Buddhist mice. But while they were still comfortably in charge, they would always scorn supplicants at their feet. He had neither the nerve nor the wish to see them himself. He could never quite decide whether this was a sign of arrogance or of a lack of backbone.","As he had already expressed sympathy for the teachers demanding payment, he naturally approved of his colleagues doing the same; but he went on sitting in his yamen, still not accompanying the other duns. As for those who suspected him of holding aloof, that was just a misunderstanding. According to him, all his life, people had asked him to pay his debts but he had never dunned anyone else, so this was not something “he excelled in.” Besides, he steered clear of those who wielded economic power. Certainly such people, once they lost their power and preached Buddhist scriptures, were also most “lovable”; but while still enthroned they behaved like the King of Hell, regarding the rest of mankind as their slaves, thinking they had the power of life and death over those paupers. This was why he steered clear of them. Although sometimes even he felt this showed a tendency to hold aloof, at the same time he often suspected it of actually being an incapacity."
大清早，去寻我大哥；他立在堂门外看天，我便走到他背后，拦住门，格外沉静，格外和气的对他说，,"Early in the morning, I went to find my eldest brother; he stood outside the hall to watch the sky, so I walked behind him, blocked the door, and said to him very calmly, very kindly,","Early this morning I went looking for my brother. I found him standing by the door to the hall, staring up at the sky. Approaching from behind, I placed myself between him and the doorway. ‘I have something to tell you,’ I said, taking care to keep my voice soft, meek.","Early this morning I went to find my elder brother. He was standing outside the hall door looking at the sky when I walked up behind him, standing between him and the door, and addressed him with exceptional poise and politeness:"
小路上又来了一个女人，也是半白头发，褴褛的衣裙；提一个破旧的朱漆圆篮，外挂一串纸锭，三步一歇的走。忽然见华大妈坐在地上看他，便有些踌躇，惨白的脸上，现出些羞愧的颜色；但终于硬着头皮，走到左边的一坐坟前，放下了篮子。,"There was another woman on the path, also with half-white hair and a ragged dress; she carried a shabby red lacquer round basket with a string of paper ingots attached, and walked every three steps. Suddenly seeing Aunt Hua sitting on the ground looking at him, she hesitated, her pale face showed some shame; but she finally bit her head and walked to the grave on the left, and put down the basket.","Another woman – her hair also grey, her clothes ragged, carrying an old, round basket lacquered in vermilion, from which a chain of paper money hung – approached slowly along the narrow track, pausing every few steps. Suddenly noticing Hua Dama’s gaze, she hesitated, a flush tingeing her pale face, then forced herself to walk on: to a grave to the left of the boundary, in front of which she set down her basket.","Another woman came down the path, grey-haired and in rags. She was carrying an old, round, red-lacquered basket, with a string of paper money hanging from it; and she walked haltingly. When she saw Old Shuan's wife sitting on the ground watching her, she hesitated, and a flush of shame spread over her pale face. However, she summoned up courage to cross over to a grave in the left section, where she set down her basket."
阿Q没有家，住在未庄的土谷祠[16]里；也没有固定的职业，只给人家做短工，割麦便割麦，舂米便舂米，撑船便撑船。工作略长久时，他也或住在临时主人的家里，但一完就走了。所以，人们忙碌的时候，也还记起阿Q来，然而记起的是做工，并不是“行状”；一闲空，连阿Q都早忘却，更不必说“行状”了。只是有一回，有一个老头子颂扬说：“阿Q真能做！”这时阿Q赤着膊，懒洋洋的瘦伶仃的正在他面前，别人也摸不着这话是真心还是讥笑，然而阿Q很喜欢。,"Ah Q had no home, and lived in the Tugu Temple[16] in Weizhuang; he also had no fixed occupation, so he only worked part-time for others. When the work is a little longer, he may also live in the temporary owner's house, but he will leave as soon as he is finished. Therefore, when people are busy, they still remember Ah Q, but what they remember is about work, not ""walking""; when they are free, even Ah Q has long forgotten, let alone ""walking"". Only once, an old man praised and said, ""Ah Q can really do it!"" At this time, Ah Q was shirtless, and a languid and lanky man was standing in front of him. like.","Ah-Q had no home of his own: in Weizhuang, he lodged in the Temple of the God of the Earth and the God of the Five Grains. Neither, as the village odd-job man, did he have a fixed profession. If someone was needed to harvest wheat, he harvested wheat; if called upon to husk rice, he husked rice; if a boat wanted poling, that’s what he did. If a job was likely to take a while, he lodged with his employer; but once it was over, he left. When people were in a hurry to get something done, therefore, they remembered Ah-Q – but only the odd jobs he could do for them, and not his life history. And as soon as they were no longer in such a hurry, Ah-Q – and his elusive biographical details – were quickly forgotten. ‘ He puts his back into it, that Ah-Q!’ an old man once admiringly remarked, considering our hero’s bare, torpidly scrawny torso – that was the closest anyone ever got to constructing a personality profile of him. Those who overheard him couldn’t make out whether his eulogizer was being genuine or sarcastic; but Ah-Q, at least, was delighted.","Ah Q had no family but lived in the Tutelary God's Temple at Weizhuang. He had no regular work either, being simply an odd-job man for others: when there was wheat to be cut he would cut it, when there was rice to be hulled he would hull it, when there was a boat to be punted he would punt it. If the work lasted for any length of time he might stay in the house of his temporary employer, but as soon as it was finished he would leave. Thus whenever people had work to be done they would remember Ah Q, but what they remembered was his service and not his “background.” By the time the job was done even Ah Q himself was forgotten, to say nothing of his “background.” Once indeed an old man remarked, “What a worker Ah Q is!” Ah Q, bare-backed, scrawny sluggard, was standing before him at the time, and others could not tell whether the remark was serious or derisive, but Ah Q was overjoyed. Ah Q, again, had a very high opinion of himself."
“你看，还说教书的要薪水是卑鄙哩。这种东西似乎连人要吃饭，饭要米做，米要钱买这一点粗浅事情都不知道……”,"""Look, they also say that it is despicable for a teacher to ask for a salary. It seems that this kind of thing even requires people to eat, rice to cook, and rice to buy money. I don't even know the simple things...""","‘Yesterday, they almost refused to sell me rice on credit.’ ‘They’ve started saying it’s undignified for teachers to ask to be paid. They don’t seem to understand people need to eat rice, and rice costs money. It’s not exactly a complicated idea.’","“See here, they say teachers cheapen themselves by demanding payment. Apparently those creatures don't know the elementary fact that people need to eat, to eat you need rice, and to buy rice you need money.”"
我们便都挤在船头上看打仗，但那铁头老生却又并不翻筋斗，只有几个赤膊的人翻，翻了一阵，都进去了，接着走出一个小旦来，咿咿呀呀的唱。双喜说，“晚上看客少，铁头老生也懈了，谁肯显本领给白地看呢？”我相信这话对，因为其时台下已经不很有人，乡下人为了明天的工作，熬不得夜，早都睡觉去了，疏疏朗朗的站着的不过是几十个本村和邻村的闲汉。乌篷船里的那些土财主的家眷固然在，然而他们也不在乎看戏，多半是专到戏台下来吃糕饼水果和瓜子的。所以简直可以算白地。,"We all huddled on the bow to watch the battle, but the iron-headed old man didn't do some somersaults, only a few shirtless people turned over. Sing. Shuangxi said, ""There are few spectators at night, and the old iron-headed student has also given up. Who will show his skills to Baidi?"" I believe this is true, because there were not many people in the audience at that time, and the country people couldn't stand up for tomorrow's work. At night, I had already gone to bed, and there were only dozens of idle men from the village and neighboring villages standing sparsely. The family members of the rich people in the Wu Peng boat are there, but they don't care about watching the show, and most of them come down to the stage to eat cakes, fruits and melon seeds. So it's pretty straightforward.","We crowded the stern of the boat, watching the action, but the man with the black beard had no more somersaults in him; a handful of the bare-chested men turned a few, then trooped off, succeeded by a woman who began shrilling an aria. ‘The audiences are always smaller in the evenings,’ Shuangxi went on, ‘so Iron-Head isn’t putting much into it. What’s the point in showing off to an empty house?’ What he said made a lot of sense – the audience was already looking sparse. Because they’d be up at dawn the next day, the villagers couldn’t stay up all night. Most of them had gone to bed, leaving only a scattering of loafers from Zhaozhuang and other villages roundabout. Although the boats with black awnings filled with big local families remained, none of them cared much about the opera – they were just loitering near the stage, socializing over fruit, sweets and melon seeds. Shuangxi was right: it was almost an empty house.","We all crowded to the bow to watch the fighting, but the acrobat did not turn any somersaults. Only a few of the bare-armed men turned over heels a few times, then trooped off. Then a girl came out and sang in a shrill falsetto. “There aren't many watching in the evening,” said Shuangxi, “and the acrobat's taking it easy. Who wants to show off to an empty house?” That made sense to me, because by then there were not many spectators. The country folk, having work to do the next day, could not stay up all night and had gone home to bed. Standing there still were just a scattering of a few dozen idlers from Zhaozhuang and the villages around. The families of the local rich remained in the boats with black awnings, but they were not really interested in the opera. Most of them had come to the opera to eat cakes, fruit or melon-seeds. So it could really be reckoned an empty house."
七斤虽然住在农村，却早有些飞黄腾达的意思。从他的祖父到他，三代不捏锄头柄了；他也照例的帮人撑着航船，每日一回，早晨从鲁镇进城，傍晚又回到鲁镇，因此很知道些时事：例如什么地方，雷公劈死了蜈蚣精；什么地方，闺女生了一个夜叉之类。他在村人里面，的确已经是一名出场人物了。但夏天吃饭不点灯，却还守着农家习惯，所以回家太迟，是该骂的。,"Although Qijin lives in the countryside, he has long been in the mood for prosperity. From his grandfather to him, the three generations did not hold the handle of the hoe. He also helped people to support the boat as usual. Once a day, he entered the city from Lu Town in the morning and returned to Lu Town in the evening, so he knew some current affairs very well: for example Somewhere, Lei Gong killed a centipede spirit; someplace, a girl gave birth to a Yaksha and the like. Among the villagers, he was indeed already a character. But in summer, they don't light the lamp for dinner, but they still follow the habit of the farmhouse, so they should be scolded for going home too late.","Although Seven-Pounds still lived in the old family village, he was a man going places. For three generations, from his grandfather downwards, no male in the family had touched a hoe. Like his forebears, Seven-Pounds poled a daily boat-service between the local town of Luzhen and the city – setting out in the morning, returning in the evening. All this coming and going left him frightfully up on current affairs. No one knew better than he did where the god of thunder had struck a magic centipede dead, or where a virgin had given birth to a demon – etcetera, etcetera. Quite the celebrity, he was, among his fellow villagers. Even so, village custom held that in summer, lamps were not to be lit for dinner, and a late return home was grounds for a scolding.","Although a villager, Sevenpounder had always wanted to better himself. For three generations—grandfather, father and son—not a man in his family had handled a hoe. Like his father before him he worked on a boat which left Luzhen every morning for the town, returning to Luzhen in the evening. As a result he knew pretty well all that was going on; where, for instance, the thunder god had blasted a centipede spirit, or where a virgin had given birth to a demon. In the village he was quite a personage. Still he stuck to the country custom of not lighting a lamp for supper in the summer, so if he came home late he rated a scolding."
“可是，水生约我到他家玩去咧……”他睁着大的黑眼睛，痴痴的想。,"""But, Shuisheng asked me to play at his house..."" He thought with wide black eyes.","‘But Shuisheng invited me to his house…’ His dark eyes widened, fixated on the prospect.","“Well, Shuisheng has invited me to his home....” He opened wide his black eyes in anxious thought."
“小栓——你坐着，不要到这里来。”一面整顿了灶火，老栓便把一个碧绿的包，一个红红白白的破灯笼，一同塞在灶里；一阵红黑的火焰过去时，店屋里散满了一种奇怪的香味。,"""Little Shuan—you sit, don't come here."" After tidying up the fire, Lao Shuan put a green bag and a broken lantern in red, red and white in the stove together; , the shophouse was filled with a strange scent.","‘Don’t come over here.’ After firing up the stove, Shuan stuffed the jade green parcel and the torn red-and-white lantern paper inside. A reddish-black flame flared up, filling the room with a curious fragrance.","“Sit still, Little Shuan! Don't come over here.” Mending the fire in the stove, Old Shuan put the green package and the red and white lantern paper into the stove together. A red-black flame flared up, and a strange odour permeated the shop."
阿Q本来也是正人，我们虽然不知道他曾蒙什么明师指授过，但他对于“男女之大防”[30]却历来非常严；也很有排斥异端——如小尼姑及假洋鬼子之类——的正气。他的学说是：凡尼姑，一定与和尚私通；一个女人在外面走，一定想引诱野男人；一男一女在那里讲话，一定要有勾当了。为惩治他们起见，所以他往往怒目而视，或者大声说几句“诛心”[31]话，或者在冷僻处，便从后面掷一块小石头。,"Ah Q was originally a righteous man. Although we do not know what masters he was instructed by, he has always been very strict about the ""great defense between men and women""[30]; Something like that—righteousness. His theory is: every nun must have an affair with a monk; a woman must be tempted to lure a wild man when she walks outside; a man and a woman are talking there, and there must be an act. In order to punish them, he often glared at them, or said a few words of ""punishing the heart""[31] loudly, or in a remote place, he threw a small stone from behind.","Until this point in his career, Ah-Q had been blessed with a character that was rigid in its uprightness. Although we have no way of knowing whether he had ever received personal moral guidance from any celebrated spiritual authority, he had always strictly upheld classically ordained prohibitions concerning the segregation of the sexes, and rejected – with righteous bile – the conduct of heretics such as the young nun or the Fake Foreign Devil. All nuns, as he saw it, were having affairs with monks; any woman walking the streets had designs on strange men; any man or woman in conversation, wherever they were, must be up to no good. He was always disciplining them with his Angry Glare, or with a few sentences of penetrating criticism; if there was nobody else about, he would cast a pebble at them from behind.","Ah Q, too, was a man of strict morals to begin with. Although we do not know whether he was guided by some good teacher, he had always shown himself most scrupulous in observing “strict segregation of the sexes,” and was righteous enough to denounce such heretics as the little nun and the Bogus Foreign Devil. His view was, “All nuns must carry on in secret with monks. If a woman walks alone on the street, she must want to seduce bad men. When a man and a woman talk together, it must be to arrange to meet.” In order to correct such people, he would glare furiously, pass loud, cutting remarks, or, if the place were deserted, throw a small stone from behind."
“疯了。”驼背五少爷点着头说。,"""Crazy."" The Hunchback Fifth Young Master nodded and said.","‘Crazy,’ the hunchback nodded his head.","“Crazy!” agreed the hunchback, nodding his head."
“价钱决不会比别家出得少！”秀才说。秀才娘子忙一瞥阿Q的脸，看他感动了没有。,"""The price will never be less than other homes!"" Xiucai said. The lady scholar hurriedly glanced at Ah Q's face to see if he was moved.","‘We’ll pay better than anyone else!’ said the village genius. His wife glanced across at Ah-Q, to see if this had any impact on him.",“We certainly won't pay less than other people!” said the successful county candidate. His wife shot a hasty glance at Ah Q to see his reaction.
他出去了；母亲和我都叹息他的景况：多子，饥荒，苛税，兵，匪，官，绅，都苦得他像一个木偶人了。母亲对我说，凡是不必搬走的东西，尽可以送他，可以听他自己去拣择。,"He went out; my mother and I both sighed at his condition: many sons, famine, severe taxes, soldiers, bandits, officials, and gentry, all made him feel like a puppet. My mother told me that anything that doesn't need to be moved can be given to him, and he can choose by himself.","Once he had gone out, Mother and I sighed over his situation together: too many children, famine, taxes, soldiers, bandits, officials, corrupt local potentates – they’d all taken their pound of flesh. Anything we didn’t need to take with us, Mother said, we should give him; he could take whatever he wanted.","After he had gone out, Mother and I both shook our heads over his hard life: many children, famines, taxes, soldiers, bandits, officials and landed gentry, all had squeezed him as dry as a mummy. Mother said that we should offer him all the things we were not going to take away, letting him choose for himself."
我的母亲很高兴，但也藏着许多凄凉的神情，教我坐下，歇息，喝茶，且不谈搬家的事。宏儿没有见过我，远远的对面站着只是看。,"My mother was very happy, but also with a lot of sadness, teaching me to sit down, rest, drink tea, and not talk about moving. Hong'er had never seen me, and was just watching from afar.","Beneath her pleasure at seeing me lurked an unmistakable sorrow. But she had me sit down: rest, drink some tea. She would say nothing of the imminent move. Hong’er, who had never met me before, stood some distance away, looking on.","Though Mother was delighted, she was also trying to hide a certain feeling of sadness. She told me to sit down and rest and have some tea, letting the removal wait for the time being. Hong'er, who had never seen me before, stood watching me at a distance."
我诅咒吃人的人，先从他起头；要劝转吃人的人，也先从他下手。,"When I curse the cannibal, start with him first; if I want to persuade the cannibal, I also start with him.","A curse on all cannibals – beginning with my brother. And if I am to turn them, I must begin with him, too.","In cursing man-eaters, I shall start with my brother. In dissuading maneaters, I shall start with him too."
我们的船向前走，两岸的青山在黄昏中，都装成了深黛颜色，连着退向船后梢去。,"As our boat moved forward, the green hills on both sides of the strait, in the twilight, all pretended to be dark daisies and retreated to the stern of the boat.","Our boat edged forward: deep blue in the descending dusk, the green mountains to either side slipped away behind us.","As we set off, the green mountains on either side of the river became deep blue in the dusk, receding towards the stern of the boat."
前几天，狼子村的佃户来告荒，对我大哥说，他们村里的一个大恶人，给大家打死了；几个人便挖出他的心肝来，用油煎炒了吃，可以壮壮胆子。我插了一句嘴，佃户和大哥便都看我几眼。今天才晓得他们的眼光，全同外面的那伙人一模一样。,"A few days ago, the tenants of Langzi Village came to complain about the famine and told my eldest brother that a big villain in their village had been beaten to death by everyone; a few people dug out his heart and liver, fried it with oil, and it would be strong. Be brave. I interjected, and the tenant and eldest brother all looked at me. I only realized today that their eyes are exactly the same as those of the group outside.","A few days ago, one of our tenants – a farmer from Wolf Cub Village – came to report a famine. The most hated man in the village had been beaten to death, he told my brother, and some of the villagers had dug out his heart and liver, then fried and eaten them, for courage. When I interrupted, the farmer and my brother glanced at me – repeatedly. Now – now I recognize the look in their eyes: exactly that of the people I passed yesterday.","A few days ago a tenant of ours from Wolf Cub Village came to report the failure of the crops and told my elder brother that a notorious character in their village had been beaten to death; then some people had taken out his heart and liver, fried them in oil, and eaten them as a means of increasing their courage. When I interrupted, the tenant and my brother both stared at me. Only today have I realized that they had exactly the same look in their eyes as those people outside."
阿Q以如是等等妙法克服怨敌之后，便愉快的跑到酒店里喝几碗酒，又和别人调笑一通，口角一通，又得了胜，愉快的回到土谷祠，放倒头睡着了。假使有钱，他便去押牌宝[19]，一堆人蹲在地面上，阿Q即汗流满面的夹在这中间，声音他最响：,"After Ah Q overcame his enemies with such a wonderful method, he happily went to the hotel to drink a few bowls of wine, teased with others and quarreled, and won again. He happily returned to the Tugu Temple and fell asleep. If he had money, he would go to bet on cards[19]. A group of people were squatting on the ground, and Ah Q was in the middle, sweating on his face. His voice was the loudest:","Once Ah-Q’s enemies had been trounced by such ingenious means, he would trot happily off to the tavern, down a few bowls of wine, crack a few jokes, start a few arguments and, victorious again, return happily to the Temple of Earth and Grain, where he would lay his head down and go straight to sleep. If he had money in his pocket, he would go off to gamble, sweatily squeezing his way in among a crowd of other chancers squatted down on the ground. ‘Four hundred on the Green Dragon!’","After employing such cunning devices to get even with his enemies, Ah Q would make his way cheerfully to the tavern to drink a few bowls of wine, joke with the others again, quarrel with them again, come off victorious again, and return cheerfully to the Tutelary God's Temple, there to fall asleep as soon as his head touched the pillow. If he had money he would gamble. A group of men would squat on the ground, Ah Q sandwiched in their midst, his face streaming with sweat; and his voice would shout the loudest: “Four hundred on the Green Dragon!”"
吴妈，是赵太爷家里唯一的女仆，洗完了碗碟，也就在长凳上坐下了，而且和阿Q谈闲天：,"Wu Ma, the only maid in Mrs. Zhao's family, sat down on the bench after washing the dishes, and chatted with Ah Q:","Once the dishes were done, Mrs Wu, the Zhaos’ only maid, sat down on the bench to chat to Ah-Q.","When Amah Wu, the only maidservant in the Zhao household, had finished washing the dishes, she sat down on the long bench too and started chatting to Ah Q:"

Liu Jin also took advantage of the situation and slipped out, sitting next to him and calling him Daddy. Seven pounds did not respond.","Head bowed, Seven-Pounds made his way slowly over to a stool and sat down, still holding his six-foot speckled bamboo pipe with its ivory mouth and pewter bowl. ‘Daddy,’ Six-Pounds called out, slipping out from her hiding place to sit next to him.

Did you say I belonged to the same clan as you?”"
这是未庄赛神[21]的晚上。这晚上照例有一台戏，戏台左近，也照例有许多的赌摊。做戏的锣鼓，在阿Q耳朵里仿佛在十里之外。他只听得桩家的歌唱了。他赢而又赢，铜钱变成角洋，角洋变成大洋，大洋又成了叠。他兴高采烈得非常：,"This is the evening of the Weichuang Saishen [21]. This evening there was a play as usual, and there were as usual many gambling booths near the stage. The gongs and drums of the play seemed to be ten miles away in Ah Q's ears. He could only hear the singing of the Zhuang family. He wins and wins, copper coins become horns, horns become oceans, and oceans become stacks. He was very elated:","It was the evening of Weizhuang’s Festival of the Gods. There was opera, as usual, with gambling stalls set up near the stage. The drums and gongs buzzed only faintly in Ah-Q’s ears, as if the musicians were miles away. All he could hear was the banker’s singsong. He won, and he won again, his coppers turning silver, his silver turning into dollars – a great pile of shiny dollars. He was dizzy with euphoria.","This was the evening of the Festival of the Gods in Weizhuang. According to custom there was an opera; and close to the stage, also according to custom, were numerous gambling tables, the drums and gongs of the stakeholder's chant. He staked successfully again and again, his coppers turning into silver coins, his silver coins into dollars, and his dollars mounting up. In his excitement he cried out, “Two dollars on Heavenly Gate!”"
微风早经停息了；枯草支支直立，有如铜丝。一丝发抖的声音，在空气中愈颤愈细，细到没有，周围便都是死一般静。两人站在枯草丛里，仰面看那乌鸦；那乌鸦也在笔直的树枝间，缩着头，铁铸一般站着。,"The breeze had long since ceased; withered grass stood upright like copper wire. A trembling voice trembled in the air more and more thinly, so thin that there was nothing, and the surroundings were dead silent. The two stood in the dead grass, looking up at the crow; the crow was also standing among the straight branches, with its head huddled and cast iron.","With the ebbing of the breeze, the stems of withered grass now stood erect, rigid as copper wire. Her thin, tremulous voice faded away, leaving only the silence of the grave. The two women stood among the clumps of grass, staring up at the crow perched, as if cast in iron, amid the rod-like branches, its head drawn in.","The breeze had long since dropped, and the dry grass stood stiff and straight as copper wires. A faint, tremulous sound vibrated in the air, then faded and died away. All around was deathly still. They stood in the dry grass, looking up at the crow; and the crow, on the rigid bough of the tree, its head drawn in, stood immobile as iron."
第三，我又不知道阿Q的名字是怎么写的。他活着的时候，人都叫他阿Quei，死了以后，便没有一个人再叫阿Quei了，那里还会有“著之竹帛”[10]的事。若论“著之竹帛”，这篇文章要算第一次，所以先遇着了这第一个难关。我曾经仔细想：阿Quei，阿桂还是阿贵呢？倘使他号叫月亭，或者在八月间做过生日，那一定是阿桂了；而他既没有号——也许有号，只是没有人知道他，——又未尝散过生日征文的帖子：写作阿桂，是武断的。又倘若他有一位老兄或令弟叫阿富，那一定是阿贵了；而他又只是一个人：写作阿贵，也没有佐证的。其余音Quei的偏僻字样，更加凑不上了。先前，我也曾问过赵太爷的儿子茂才[11]先生，谁料博雅如此公，竟也茫然，但据结论说，是因为陈独秀办了《新青年》提倡洋字[12]，所以国粹沦亡，无可查考了。我的最后的手段，只有托一个同乡去查阿Q犯事的案卷，八个月之后才有回信，说案卷里并无与阿Quei的声音相近的人，我虽不知道是真没有，还是没有查，然而也再没有别的方法了。生怕注音字母还未通行，只好用了“洋字”，照英国流的拚法写他为阿Quei，略作阿Q。这近于盲从《新青年》，自己也很抱歉，但茂才公尚且不知，我还有什么好办法呢。,"Third, I don't know how Ah Q's name is written. When he was alive, people called him Ah Quei, and after he died, no one called him Ah Quei anymore, and there would still be things like ""Zhizhi Bamboo and Silk""[10]. If we talk about ""Bamboo and Silk"", this article is the first time, so we encounter this first difficulty. I once thought carefully: Ah Quei, Ah Kuei or Ah Gui? If he called Yueting, or had a birthday in August, it must have been Agui; and he neither had a number—maybe, but no one knew him—and he had never posted a birthday essay: writing Agui, is arbitrary. And if he has an old brother or a younger brother named Ah Fu, it must be Ah Gui; and he is just one person: writing Ah Gui has no supporting evidence. The remote words of the other sounds Quei are even more difficult to get together. Earlier, I also asked Mr. Maocai[11], the son of Mr. Zhao, who would have expected Boya to be so fair, but he was at a loss. The quintessence of the nation has perished and is beyond investigation. My last resort was to entrust a fellow villager to investigate the case file of Ah Q's crime. Eight months later, I would reply to a letter saying that there was no one in the file with a voice similar to Ah Quei's. Although I don't know if it was true or not Check, but there is no other way. Afraid that the phonetic alphabet has not yet been used, he had to use ""foreign characters"", and wrote him as Ah Quei according to the English spelling, abbreviated as Ah Q. This is close to blindly following ""New Youth"", and I am sorry, but Mr. Mao Cai still doesn't know, what else can I do.","A third dilemma: I don’t even know how to write Ah-Q’s name. In his lifetime, he was generally referred to as ‘Ah-Quei’ (or that was what it sounded like, at least). After his death, when he was firmly consigned to the dustbin of history, no one called him Ah-Quei, or indeed anything at all. Since the present essay is the first attempt ever made to preserve the details of his life for posterity, the question of his name becomes a substantial and primary difficulty. After careful inquiry, I have discovered no Chinese character that corresponds exactly to the sound ‘Quei’. This Quei, then – I have induced – was it in fact gui? And, if so, was it the gui meaning ‘osmanthus flower’ or ‘noble’ ? Now, if his parents had had the foresight to give him a nom de plume, and that name had been ‘Moon Pavilion’, or if he had been born in the eighth lunar month, the gui of ‘osmanthus’ would have made abundant sense – for the Moon Festival falls on the eighth month, when the osmanthus blooms. But as, being illiterate and all, he had no nom de plume – or maybe he did, but no one knew what it was – and neither did he ever hint at the month of his birth by distributing party invitations, to settle upon osmanthus gui would again constitute irresponsible licence on the part of his biographer. Or again, if he had had a brother called Fu, ‘Prosperous’, then the gui of ‘noble’ would have had a strong parallel logic. But since no such sibling has ever been traced, such a spelling is unjustifiable. To be sure, there are other, more recherché characters pronounced gui – ‘boudoir’, ‘tortoise’, ‘salmon’, ‘juniper’, etcetera; but they all strike me as even less likely. I have consulted our local scholar and county examination laureate, the learned younger Zhao, on this question, but to my great surprise even this oracle had no light to shed on the matter, although he laid the blame for the confusion on the shoulders of westernizing intellectuals such as Chen Duxiu and his benighted journal New Youth.1 It was their advocacy of the Roman alphabet, he convincingly argued, that had brought the national essence into such terminal decline that no one could fix even on the spelling of Ah-Quei. My last, desperate course was to ask a fellow provincial of mine to trace Ah-Q through his criminal record. After eight long months I finally got a reply: no such individual – by the name of Ah-Quei, Ah-Gui, or anything like it – existed. Though I had no way of finding out whether this was indeed the case, or whether my acquaintance had even looked, neither did I have any other hope of verifying matters. All of which leaves me no choice but to transcribe the mysterious Quei into the English alphabet, abbreviating it for convenience’s sake, to Q: Ah-Q.2 Which compromise reduces me to the level of those reprobates in charge of New Youth. For this I am heartily ashamed of myself, but as the problem defeated even the younger Zhao, I fear I have no better option.","The third difficulty I encountered in writing this work was that I don't know how Ah Q's personal name should be written either. During his lifetime everybody called him Ah Gui, but after his death not a soul mentioned Ah Gui again; for he was obviously not one of those whose name is “preserved on bamboo tablets and silk.” If there is any question of preserving his name, this essay must be the first attempt at doing so. Hence I am confronted with this difficulty at the outset. I have given the question careful thought. Ah Gui—would that be the “Gui” meaning fragrant osmanthus or the “Gui” meaning nobility? If his other name had been Moon Pavilion, or if he had celebrated his birthday in the month of the Moon Festival, then it would certainly be the “Gui” for fragrant osmanthus. But since he had no other name—or if he had, no one knew it—and since he never sent out invitations on his birthday to secure complimentary verses, it would be arbitrary to write Ah Gui (fragrant osmanthus). Again, if he had had an elder or younger brother called Ah Fu (prosperity), then he would certainly be called Ah Gui (nobility). But he was all on his own; thus there is no justification for writing Ah Gui(nobility). All the other, unusual characters with the sound Gui are even less suitable. I once put this question to Mr. Zhao's son, the successful county candidate, but even such a learned man as he was baffled by it. According to him, however, the reason why this name could not be traced was that Chen Duxiu had brought out the magazine New Youth advocating the use of the Western alphabet, hence the national culture was going to the dogs. As a last resort, I asked someone from my district to go and look up the legal documents recording Ah Q's case, but after eight months he sent me a letter saying that there was no name anything like Ah Gui in those records. Although uncertain whether this was the truth or whether my friend had simply done nothing, after failing to trace the name this way I could think of no other means of finding it. Since I am afraid the new system of phonetics has not yet come into common use, there is nothing for it but to use the Western alphabet, writing the name according to the English spelling as Ah Gui and abbreviating it to Ah Q. This approximates to blindly following New Youth, and I am thoroughly ashamed of myself; but since even such a learned man as Mr. Zhao's son could not solve my problem, what else can I do?"
然而政府竟又付钱，学校也就开课了。但在前几天，却有学生总会上了一个呈文给政府，说“教员倘若不上课，便不要付欠薪。”这虽然并无效，而方玄绰却忽而记起前回政府所说的“上了课才给钱”的话来，“差不多”这一个影子在他眼前又一幌，而且并不消灭，于是他便在讲堂上公表了。,"However, the government paid the money again, and the school opened. But a few days ago, there was a student union that submitted a letter to the government, saying, ""If the teachers don't attend classes, they should not pay back wages."" Although this was not ineffective, Fang Xuanchuo suddenly remembered what he said when he returned to the government. When he said ""money is only paid after class"", the shadow of ""almost"" appeared in front of his eyes again, and it did not disappear, so he made a public statement in the lecture hall.","Eventually, another payment was forthcoming, and classes restarted. A few days earlier, however, the Students’ Association had presented the government with a petition: ‘If teachers don’t teach,’ the complaint had gone, ‘they shouldn’t get paid.’ Although no one took any notice of them, Fang Xuanchuo couldn’t help see the similarity with the view the government had taken earlier. Once more dancing determinedly before him, his new philosophy of more-or-lessism now made its second public appearance in the lecture hall.","Then, finally, the government resumed payment, and the schools started classes again. But a few days before this, the student union had petitioned the government, “If teachers still won't give classes, don't pay their arrears.” Although this proved ineffectual, it suddenly reminded Fang Xuanchuo of the earlier government ultimatum, “No pay till classes are resumed.” The reflection “much of a muchness” flashed before him, and did not fade away. Hence he had expounded it publicly in the classroom."

I heard that it is still distributed by the accounting department. But the bank has closed today, and it will take a three-day rest until the morning of the eighth day."" He sat down and looked at the ground. After drinking a sip of tea, he slowly opened his mouth and said, ""Fortunately, there are no problems in the yamen, and you will have money around the eighth day of the first month... Borrowing money from unrelated relatives and friends is really a trouble. I went to find Jin Yongsheng in the afternoon and talked for a while.

Now they’re saying Payroll’s going to send them out as usual. But the banks are shut for three days over the holiday, so we’ll have to wait till the morning of the eighth.’ He sat down and studied the floor, taking a sip of tea. ‘There shouldn’t be any problem,’ he eventually went on. ‘I expect they’ll get us the money in the end… Though I can’t say it’s been much fun trying to borrow money off friends and relatives. I forced myself to call on Jin Yongsheng this afternoon. First we chatted a while, and he told me how well he thought I’d behaved through the whole business, not asking for my salary, refusing to pick the cheque up myself, and so on and so forth. Then I asked him if I could borrow fifty dollars off him, just for the next few days. He made this face, as if I’d just stuffed a handful of salt in his mouth. Then he started going on about how everyone’d been late with the rent, about how bad business was. Why don’t I go and ask for the money I’m owed, he said, no shame in that.","“That's no longer necessary, they say it will still be sent over by the accountants' office. But today the banks have already closed, for three days. Have to wait till the morning of the eighth.” He sat down, his eyes on the floor.

说也奇怪，从此之后，果然大家也仿佛格外尊敬他。这在阿Q，或者以为因为他是赵太爷的父亲，而其实也不然。未庄通例，倘如阿七打阿八，或者李四打张三，向来本不算一件事，必须与一位名人如赵太爷者相关，这才载上他们的口碑。一上口碑，则打的既有名，被打的也就托庇有了名，至于错在阿Q，那自然是不必说；所以者何？就因为赵太爷是不会错的。但他既然错，为什么大家又仿佛格外尊敬他呢？这可难解，穿凿起来说，或者因为阿Q说是赵太爷的本家，虽然挨了打，大家也还怕有些真，总不如尊敬一些稳当，否则也如孔庙里的太牢[23]一般，虽然与猪羊一样，同是畜生，但既经圣人下箸，先儒们便不敢妄动了。,"Strange to say, since then, everyone seems to respect him very much. This is in Ah Q, perhaps because he is Zhao Taiye's father, but in fact it is not. As usual in Weizhuang, if Ah Qi beats Ah Ba, or Li Si beats Zhang San, it has never been a matter. It has to be related to a famous person such as Mr. Zhao, and then it will be uploaded to their word of mouth. As soon as word of mouth is used, the one who is beaten will become famous, and the one who is beaten will also become famous. As for Ah Q's fault, there is no need to say; so why? Just because Mr. Zhao can't be wrong. But since he was wrong, why did everyone seem to respect him so much? This is difficult to understand. It is difficult to explain it, or because Ah Q said that he is the family of Mr. Zhao, even though he was beaten, everyone is still afraid of some truth. It is better to respect and be safe, otherwise it will be like a prison in a Confucian temple.[23] Although they are both animals like pigs and sheep, but after being sent by the saints, the Confucians did not dare to act rashly.","The funny thing was that his fellow villagers did begin to treat him with a new respect. Ah-Q may have deluded himself into thinking it was because he actually was Mr Zhao’s father; the real reason was very different. In Weizhuang, public opinion went something like this: no one took any notice if any Li, Wang or Zhang began slapping each other about. It was only when a man of reputation like Mr Zhao got involved that such an imbroglio was singled out for public approbation, with the hittee sharing in the hitter’s glory. Ah-Q, it was of course universally accepted, had been in the wrong, because Mr Zhao was never wrong. How, then, to explain the new awe with which he was regarded? Perhaps – to hazard an unreliable guess at the matter – it all went back to Ah-Q’s claim of blood relation to Mr Zhao. Even though he had been soundly beaten for it, maybe everyone feared there might be some grain of truth to the allegation, and the safest thing would be to mind themselves around him a bit more. Or maybe Ah-Q became as untouchable as the sacrificial beef in Confucius’s ancestral temple – because the sage had once touched it with his sacred chopsticks, it acquired an aura of sanctity for his disciples.","After this incident, strange to relate, it was true that everybody seemed to pay him unusual respect. He probably attributed this to the fact that he was Mr. Zhao's father, but actually such was not the case. In Weizhuang, as a rule, if the seventh child hit the eighth child or Li So-and-so hit Zhang Soand-so, it was not taken seriously. A beating had to be connected with some important personage like Mr. Zhao before the villagers thought it worth talking about. But once they thought it worth talking about, since the beater was famous the one beaten enjoyed some of his reflected fame. As for the fault being Ah Q's, that was naturally taken for granted, the reason being that Mr. Zhao could do no wrong. But if Ah Q were wrong, why did everybody seem to treat him with unusual respect? This is difficult to explain. We may put forward the hypothesis that it was because Ah Q had said he belonged to the same family as Mr. Zhao; thus, although he had been beaten, people were still afraid there might be some truth in his assertion and therefore thought it safer to treat him more respectfully. Or, alternatively, it may have been like the case of the sacrificial beef in the Confucian temple: although the beef was in the same category as the pork and mutton, being of animal origin just as they were, later Confucians did not dare touch it since the sage had enjoyed it."

第四，是阿Q的籍贯了。倘他姓赵，则据现在好称郡望的老例，可以照《郡名百家姓》[13]上的注解，说是“陇西天水人也”，但可惜这姓是不甚可靠的，因此籍贯也就有些决不定。他虽然多住未庄，然而也常常宿在别处，不能说是未庄人，即使说是“未庄人也”，也仍然有乖史法的。,"Fourth, it is Ah Q's native place. If his surname is Zhao, then according to the old practice of calling him a county king, he can be said to be ""a native of Tianshui, Longxi"" according to the annotations in ""Country Names and Hundred Family Surnames""[13], but unfortunately this surname is not very reliable. , so the place of origin is somewhat uncertain. Although he lived in Weizhuang most of the time, he often lived in other places. He could not be said to be from Weizhuang.","The question of specifying Ah-Q’s place of birth is my fourth difficulty. If we could be sure his surname was Zhao, we could trace him back to the province from which the clan originated. A quick glance through our old school copy of the Hundred Surnames3 would leave him ‘A Native of Tianshui, Gansu Province’. But as we have no reliable information about his surname, neither can we fix on his birthplace. Although he spent most of his life in the village of Weizhuang, he was often to be found in other places, too, so to term him a native of Weizhuang would hardly be historically rigorous.","My fourth difficulty was with Ah Q's place of origin. If his surname were Zhao, then according to the old custom which still prevails of classifying people by their district, one might look up the commentary in The Hundred Surnames and find “Native of Tianshui in Gansu.” But unfortunately this surname is open to question, with the result that Ah Q's place of origin must also remain uncertain. Although he lived for the most part in Weizhuang, he often stayed in other places, so that it would be wrong to call him a native of Weizhuang."
华大妈听到“痨病”这两个字，变了一点脸色，似乎有些不高兴；但又立刻堆上笑，搭赸着走开了。这康大叔却没有觉察，仍然提高了喉咙只是嚷，嚷得里面睡着的小栓也合伙咳嗽起来。,"When Aunt Hua heard the word ""tuberculosis"", her expression changed a little, and she seemed a little unhappy; but she immediately laughed and walked away. This Uncle Kang didn't notice, he still raised his throat and shouted, causing Xiao Shuan, who was sleeping inside, to cough together.","Paling at the word ‘consumption’, Hua Dama smiled all the more valiantly, before walking off, mumbling some excuse, to conceal her discomfort. Oblivious, Mr Kang raised the volume of his voice a notch, squeezing a further coughing fit from the Shuan boy asleep in the back room.","The old woman seemed a little disconcerted by the word “consumption,” and turned a shade paler; however, she forced a smile again at once and found some pretext to leave. Meanwhile the man in brown was indiscreet enough to go on talking at the top of his voice until the child in the inner room was woken and started coughing."
这一夜没有月，未庄在黑暗里很寂静，寂静到像羲皇[51]时候一般太平。阿Q站着看到自己发烦，也似乎还是先前一样，在那里来来往往的搬，箱子抬出了，器具抬出了，秀才娘子的宁式床也抬出了，……抬得他自己有些不信他的眼睛了。但他决计不再上前，却回到自己的祠里去了。,"There was no moon that night, and Weichuang was very quiet in the dark, so quiet that it was as peaceful as the time of Emperor Xi[51]. Ah Q stood there and saw that he was annoyed, and it seemed to be the same as before. He was moving back and forth, carrying out the boxes, carrying out the utensils, and carrying out the Ning-style bed of the talented lady,... I can't believe his eyes anymore. But he decided not to go forward, but went back to his temple.","A perfect peace seemed to reign over Weizhuang that moonless night – as perfect as in the time of the ancient sage emperors. Ah-Q watched until he was bored with the business: on it went, endless toing and froing, and moving of cases, objects, the Ningbo bed… Incredulous, and yet resolved to go no closer, he returned to the temple.","There was no moon that night, and Weizhuang was very still in the pitch darkness, as quiet as in the peaceful days of Emperor Fu Xi. Ah Q stood there until his patience ran out, yet there seemed no end to the business, distant figures kept moving to and fro, carrying off cases, carrying off furniture, carrying off the Ningbo bed of the successful county candidate's wife... carrying until he could hardly believe his own eyes. But he decided not to go any closer, and went back to the temple."
但我们终于谈到搬家的事。我说外间的寓所已经租定了，又买了几件家具，此外须将家里所有的木器卖去，再去增添。母亲也说好，而且行李也略已齐集，木器不便搬运的，也小半卖去了，只是收不起钱来。,"But we finally talked about moving. I said that the apartment in the outside world has been rented, and I have bought a few pieces of furniture. Besides, I have to sell all the wooden utensils at home and add more. The mother also said yes, and the luggage has been collected a little, and the wooden utensils are inconvenient to carry, so I have sold half of them, but I can't collect the money.","Eventually, our talk turned to what had brought me here. I had rented lodgings in the other place, I told her, and bought a few items of furniture; but everything from this house would want selling, to get what we needed for the new place. My mother agreed, and said she had just about finished her packing and sold almost half of the things she couldn’t take with her – it was just that her buyers were being slow in paying up.","But finally we had to talk about the removal. I said that rooms had already been rented elsewhere, and I had bought a little furniture; in addition it would be necessary to sell all the furniture in the house in order to buy more things. Mother agreed, saying that the luggage was nearly all packed, and about half the furniture that could not be easily moved had already been sold. Only it was difficult to get people to pay up."
他省悟了，这是绕到法场去的路，这一定是“嚓”的去杀头。他惘惘的向左右看，全跟着马蚁似的人，而在无意中，却在路旁的人丛中发见了一个吴妈。很久违，伊原来在城里做工了。阿Q忽然很羞愧自己没志气：竟没有唱几句戏。他的思想仿佛旋风似的在脑里一回旋：《小孤孀上坟》欠堂皇，《龙虎斗》里的“悔不该……”也太乏，还是“手执钢鞭将你打”罢。他同时想将手一扬，才记得这两手原来都捆着，于是“手执钢鞭”也不唱了。,"He realized that this was the way to go around the Dharma field, and it must have been ""cha"" to beheaded. He looked left and right in confusion, all following the people like horse ants, but inadvertently, he saw a Wu Ma among the people on the roadside. It has been a long time since Yi Yuan was working in the city. Ah Q was suddenly ashamed of his lack of ambition: he didn't sing a few plays. His thoughts swirled in his head like a whirlwind: ""Little Lone Widow Going to the Grave"" is not grand, and ""Should I regret..."" in ""Dragon Tiger Fight"" is too lacking, or ""I will beat you with a steel whip"" stop. He wanted to raise his hands at the same time, only to remember that the two hands were tied, so he stopped singing ""Holding a Steel Whip"".","In time, it occurred to him that this was the slow road to the execution ground; that his head was definitely going to come off. He looked despondently about him – to one side, then another – at the ant-like audience following his progress. In among the crowds, he happened to spot Mrs Wu. That’s why he hadn’t seen her for ages, he thought; she must have left Weizhuang to work in town. Ah-Q was suddenly ashamed of his absence of spirit: of his failure even to croak out a few lines of opera. His head whirled through the possibilities: The Young Widow lacked grandeur, while the ‘Alas!’ from The Battle of the Dragon and the Tiger was too plaintive. ‘I will thrash you with my mace’ was assuredly his best option. He tried to brandish his fist in the air but remembered that both hands were tied; ‘I will thrash you’ was discarded also.","Then he realized that they were making a detour to the execution ground, so after all he must be going to have his head cut off. He looked round him regretfully at the people swarming after him like ants, and unexpectedly in the crowd by the roadside he caught sight of Amah Wu. So that was why he had not seen her for so long: she was working in town. Ah Q suddenly became ashamed of his lack of spirit, because he had not sung any lines from an opera. His thoughts revolved like a whirlwind: The Young Widow at Her Husband's Grave was not heroic enough. The passage “Alas, in my cups” in The Battle of the Dragon and The Tiger was too feeble. “Steel mace in hand I shall trounce you” was still the best. But when he wanted to raise his hands, he remembered that they were bound together; so he did not sing “Steel mace in hand” either."
“哈哈哈！”阿Q十分得意的笑。,"""Hahaha!"" Ah Q smiled very proudly.",‘Hahaha!’ Ah-Q laughed merrily.,Ah Q roared with delighted laughter.
但是“差不多”的事实又发生了，政府当初虽只不理那些招人头痛的教员，后来却不理到无关痛痒的官吏，欠而又欠，终于逼得先前鄙薄教员要钱的好官，也很有几员化为索薪大会里的骁将了。惟有几种日报上却很发了些鄙薄讥笑他们的文字。方玄绰也毫不为奇，毫不介意，因为他根据了他的“差不多说”，知道这是新闻记者还未缺少润笔[6]的缘故，万一政府或是阔人停了津贴，他们多半也要开大会的。,"But the ""almost"" fact happened again. Although the government only ignored the teachers who caused headaches at first, it later ignored the officials who were irrelevant, and owed it again and again. Finally, it forced the good officials who despised the teachers and asked for money, and also Quite a few members have turned into generals in the Salary Claim Conference. There are only a few kinds of daily newspapers that have made some contemptuous words mocking them. Fang Xuanchuo is also not surprised and doesn't mind, because based on his ""almost said"", he knows that this is because journalists have not yet been short of writing brushes[6]. In case the government or rich people stop subsidies, Most of them also have a meeting.","Another illustration of the principle soon presented itself. Fully occupied for a time ignoring those pesky lecturers, the government in due course got round to paying the same compliment to its civil service drones. Month upon month of unpaid salaries stacked up, until eventually a sizeable portion of those fine upstanding government employees who, in previous existences, had despised those importunately money-grubbing teachers, were pressed by circumstance into intemperate radicalism at mass protest meetings. For which they were ridiculed by a number of broadsheets. Neither surprised nor offended by the coverage, Fang Xuanchuo knew the reporters took their view only because they were still drawing their salaries. The moment the government or their backers withdrew their subsidies, they’d be on their soapboxes, too.","But something “much of a muchness” happened again. The government, although at first it simply ignored those teachers who were such a headache, later ignored the innocuous officials, withholding their pay until finally quite a few of those good officials, who had despised the teachers for asking for money, boldly took the lead in a rally to demand payment. Only a few newspapers published articles deriding them. Fang Xuanchuo, no whit surprised, paid no attention, for according to his theory “much of a muchness,” he knew this was because the journalists had not yet had their pay docked. If the government or the rich were by any chance to stop their subsidies, most of them would hold a rally too."

阿Q虽然答应着，却懒洋洋的出去了，也不知道他是否放在心上。这使赵太爷很失望，气愤而且担心，至于停止了打呵欠。秀才对于阿Q的态度也很不平，于是说，这忘八蛋要提防，或者竟不如吩咐地保，不许他住在未庄。但赵太爷以为不然，说这也怕要结怨，况且做这路生意的大概是“老鹰不吃窠下食”，本村倒不必担心的；只要自己夜里警醒点就是了。秀才听了这“庭训”[38]，非常之以为然，便即刻撤消了驱逐阿Q的提议，而且叮嘱邹七嫂，请伊万不要向人提起这一段话。,"Although Ah Q agreed, he went out lazily, not knowing whether he cared about it or not. This made Mr. Zhao very disappointed, angry and worried, and stopped yawning. The scholar's attitude towards Ah Q was also very unhappy, so he said that he should be wary of this idiot, or he might as well have ordered the local security guard not to allow him to live in Weizhuang. But Mrs. Zhao thought otherwise, and said that he was afraid of making a grudge. Besides, the person doing this business was probably ""eagles don't eat food,"" so this village didn't have to worry about it; as long as he was alert at night. When Xiucai heard this ""court training""[38], he took it for granted, and immediately withdrew his proposal to expel Ah Q, and told Mrs. Zou Qi to ask Ivan not to mention this to anyone.","After signalling his assent, Ah-Q slouched out so indifferently that no one could tell whether he really meant it. The whole disappointing encounter vexed Mr Zhao so much that he quite stopped yawning. His son was equally agitated by Ah-Q’s attitude : We should watch ourselves around this bastard, he warned. Maybe we should tell the constable to throw him out of Weizhuang. Mr Zhao resisted the idea, wary of making an enemy of Ah-Q. As likely as not, someone in his line of business wouldn’t shit on his own doorstep. The villagers had nothing to worry about; they just needed to take a bit more care at night. The learned son immediately submitted to the wisdom of the father, retracted his previous advocacy and exhorted Mrs Zou to say nothing, under any circumstances, of it to anyone else.","Although Ah Q agreed, he slouched out so carelessly that they did not know whether he had taken their instructions to heart or not. This so disappointed, annoyed and worried Mr. Zhao that he even stopped yawning. The successful candidate was also far from satisfied with Ah Q's attitude. “People should be on their guard against such a turtle's egg,” he said. “It might be best to order the bailiff to forbid him to live in Weizhuang.” Mr. Zhao did not agree, saying that then Ah Q might bear a grudge, and that in a business like this it was probably a case of “the eagle does not prey on its own nest”: his own village need not worry so long as they were a little more watchful at night. The successful candidate, much impressed by this parental instruction, immediately withdrew his proposal for banishing Ah Q but cautioned Mrs. Zou on no account to repeat what had been said."
阿Q很出意外，不由的一错愕；老尼姑见他失了锐气，便飞速的关了门，阿Q再推时，牢不可开，再打时，没有回答了。,"Ah Q was surprised, and couldn't help but stunned; the old nun saw that he had lost his strength, so she quickly closed the door, and when Ah Q pushed it again, it couldn't be opened.","Ah-Q froze, stupefied by the unexpectedness of it all. Seeing the wind had been taken out of his sails, the elderly nun shut the gate as quick as she could. When Ah-Q recovered himself enough to give it a shove, it refused to budge; when he tried knocking again, there was no answer.","This completely took the wind out of Ah Q's sails. When the old nun saw there was no fight left in him she promptly shut the gate, so that when Ah Q pushed it again he could not budge it, and when he knocked again there was no answer."

我于是日日盼望新年，新年到，闰土也就到了。好容易到了年末，有一日，母亲告诉我，闰土来了，我便飞跑的去看，他正在厨房里，紫色的圆脸，头戴一顶小毡帽，颈上套一个明晃晃的银项圈，这可见他的父亲十分爱他，怕他死去，所以在神佛面前许下愿心，用圈子将他套住了。他见人很怕羞，只是不怕我，没有旁人的时候，便和我说话，于是不到半日，我们便熟识了。,"So I look forward to the new year every day, and when the new year arrives, Runtu also arrives. At the end of the year, my mother told me one day that Runtu was coming, and I ran to see him. He was in the kitchen, with a round purple face, a small felt hat on his head, and a bright silver ring around his neck. The collar, which shows that his father loved him very much and was afraid of his death, so he made a wish in front of the gods and Buddha, and wrapped him with a circle. He was very shy when he saw people, but he was not afraid of me. When there was no one around, he would talk to me, so we became acquainted within half a day.","I now burned with impatience for New Year, because it would bring Runtu. One day, when at last the old year had reached its end, Mother told me he had come. Rushing off in search, I found him in the kitchen, his round, sun-burnt face crowned by a small felt hat, a gleaming silver necklace at his throat – token of his father’s love for him, of the endless offerings he had made on his son’s behalf to the Buddha. The necklace was to trap him in this world, to protect him from death. Though he was usually shy around company, it was different with me. As long as no one else was about, he would burble happily away, and within a few hours we were fast friends.","I looked forward every day to New Year, for New Year would bring Runtu. At last the end of the year came, and one day Mother told me that Runtu had come, and I flew to see him. He was standing in the kitchen. He had a round, crimson face and wore a small felt cap on his head and a gleaming silver necklet on his neck, showing that his father doted on him and, fearing he might die, had made a pledge with the gods and Buddhas, using the necklet as a talisman. He was very shy, and I was the only person he was not afraid of. When there was no one else there, he would talk with me, so in a few hours we were fast friends."

然而竟又全不见了那小的和大的。这时是连日的阴天，三太太又虑到遭了那大黑猫的毒手的事去。我说不然，那是天气冷，当然都躲着，太阳一出，一定出来的。,"However, the small and the big were all gone. At this time, it was a cloudy day for several days, and the third wife was thinking about being poisoned by the big black cat. I said otherwise, it was cold weather, of course they were hiding, and when the sun came out, it would definitely come out.","Then the entire family of rabbits disappeared. For days, the weather remained overcast, with my sister-in-law fretting about the black cat again. They were just hiding from the cold weather, I argued.","But then the rabbits, both small and big, disappeared. We were having a spell of dull weather.

我躺着，听船底潺潺的水声，知道我在走我的路。我想：我竟与闰土隔绝到这地步了，但我们的后辈还是一气，宏儿不是正在想念水生么。我希望他们不再像我，又大家隔膜起来……然而我又不愿意他们因为要一气，都如我的辛苦展转的生活，也不愿意他们都如闰土的辛苦麻木而生活，也不愿意都如别人的辛苦恣睢而生活。他们应该有新的生活，为我们所未经生活过的。,"I lay and listened to the murmur of the water at the bottom of the boat and knew I was going my way. I thought: I have been isolated from Runtu to this extent, but our younger generation is still together, isn't Hong'er missing Shuisheng? I hope that they will no longer be like me, and everyone will be separated... However, I don't want them to live like my hard work because they want to be together, and I don't want them to live like Runtu's hard work and numbness, and I don't want them. All live like others' hard work. They should have a new life, something we have never lived.","I lay awake, listening to the water lapping against the side of the boat. I knew I was taking my own course in life. And even though Runtu and I were now completely estranged, Hong’er and Shuisheng were just like we used to be. I prayed they would turn out differently to us: I didn’t want them to drift like me, or to suffer numbly like Runtu – nor to anaesthetize themselves with self-indulgence, as others did… I wanted new, different lives for them, lives that we had not lived.","I lay down, listening to the water rippling beneath the boat, and knew that I was going my way. I thought: although there is such a barrier between Runtu and myself, our children still have much in common, for wasn't Hong'er thinking of Shuisheng just now? I hope they will not be like us, that they will not allow a barrier to grow up between them. But again I would not like them, because they want to be one, to have a treadmill existence like mine, nor to suffer like Runtu until they become stupefied, nor yet, like others, to devote all their energies to dissipation. They should have a new life, a life we have never experienced."

不料这秃儿却拿着一支黄漆的棍子——就是阿Q所谓哭丧棒[25]——大踏步走了过来。阿Q在这刹那，便知道大约要打了，赶紧抽紧筋骨，耸了肩膀等候着，果然，拍的一声，似乎确凿打在自己头上了。,"Unexpectedly, the bald boy walked over with a yellow-lacquered stick—what Ah Q called a mourning stick[25].

Sure enough, the slap sounded, and it seemed that he had definitely hit himself on the head.","The bald villain stormed over, a varnished walking stick in his hand.

那还是上午的事。赵秀才消息灵，一知道革命党已在夜间进城，便将辫子盘在顶上，一早去拜访那历来也不相能的钱洋鬼子。这是“咸与维新”[43]的时候了，所以他们便谈得很投机，立刻成了情投意合的同志，也相约去革命。他们想而又想，才想出静修庵里有一块“皇帝万岁万万岁”的龙牌，是应该赶紧革掉的，于是又立刻同到庵里去革命。因为老尼姑来阻挡，说了三句话，他们便将伊当作满政府，在头上很给了不少的棍子和栗凿。尼姑待他们走后，定了神来检点，龙牌固然已经碎在地上了，而且又不见了观音娘娘座前的一个宣德炉[44]。,"It was still in the morning. Zhao Xiucai was well informed. As soon as he knew that the revolutionary party had entered the city at night, he put his braids on the top and went to visit the Qianyang devil who had never been able to get along in the morning. This was the time for ""Xian and Restoration""[43], so they talked very speculatively and immediately became like-minded comrades, and they also agreed to go to the revolution. They thought and thought, and then they came to the conclusion that there was a dragon plaque in the retreat nunnery that read ""Long Live the Emperor"", which should be quickly removed, so they immediately went to the nunnery to make a revolution. Because the old nun came to block and said three words, they regarded Iraq as the Manchu government and gave a lot of sticks and chisels on their heads. After the nun waited for them to leave, she made up her mind to check. Although the dragon tablet had already been broken on the ground, the Xuande furnace in front of the Guanyin empress was also missing.[44]","It had all happened that morning. The moment the village genius heard, through his own channels of communication, that the Revolutionary Party had taken the town during the night, he coiled his queue on to his head and, at first light, called on the Qian family’s Fake Foreign Devil. Although he’d never had anything to do with him in the past, this was a time for pooling talents and energies in the cause of Progress and Reform. A full and frank discussion ended in them declaring themselves comrades unto death and pledging to join the Revolution. After giving the matter some further thought, they remembered there was a tablet in the Convent of Quiet Cultivation wishing the emperor ‘Ten thousand thousand thousand thousand thousand years of life.’ Deciding, quite naturally, that this should be the first thing to go, off they rushed to revolutionize the convent. Because the old nun had tried to stop them, again quite naturally they identified her as representative of the discredited and deposed Manchu dynasty and gave her a reasonably substantial beating around the head with sticks and knuckles. After they’d gone, the nun came to, to discover the tablet in pieces on the ground, and a valuable Ming incense-burner, originally set in front of the statue of the goddess Guanyin, vanished.","It had happened that morning. The successful county candidate in the Zhao family was quick to learn the news. As soon as he heard that the revolutionaries had entered the town that night, he wound his queue up on his head and went out first thing to call on the Bogus Foreign Devil in the Qian family, with whom he had never been on very good terms. Because this was a time for all to work for reforms, they had a most satisfactory talk and on the spot became comrades who saw eye to eye and pledged themselves to make revolution. After racking their brains for some time, they remembered that in the Convent of Quiet Self-improvement there was an imperial tablet inscribed “Long Live the Emperor” which ought to be done away with immediately. Thereupon they lost no time in going to the convent to carry out their revolutionary activities. Because the old nun tried to stop them and passed a few remarks, they considered her as the Qing government and gave her quite a few knocks on the head with a stick and with their knuckles. The nun, pulling herself together after they had been smashed into fragments on the ground and the valuable Xuan De censer before the shrine of Guanyin, the goddess of mercy, had also disappeared."
据阿Q说，他的回来，似乎也由于不满意城里人，这就在他们将长凳称为条凳，而且煎鱼用葱丝，加以最近观察所得的缺点，是女人的走路也扭得不很好。然而也偶有大可佩服的地方，即如未庄的乡下人不过打三十二张的竹牌[36]，只有假洋鬼子能够叉“麻酱”，城里却连小乌龟子都叉得精熟的。什么假洋鬼子，只要放在城里的十几岁的小乌龟子的手里，也就立刻是“小鬼见阎王”。这一节，听的人都赧然了。,"According to Ah Q, his return seems to be due to his dissatisfaction with the people in the city, which is because they call the bench a bench, and use shredded spring onion for frying fish. In addition, the shortcomings of recent observations are that women's walking is also twisted. not very well. However, there are also occasions that can be admired. For example, the villagers in Weichuang can only play 32 bamboo cards [36]. Only the fake foreign devils can fork ""sesame sauce"", but even the little turtles in the city are very good at forking. Cooked. What kind of fake foreign devils, as long as they are placed in the hands of the teenage tortoises in the city, they will immediately become ""little devils see the king of hell"". In this section, everyone who listened to it was amazed.","As Ah-Q told it, he had come back because the people in town got on his nerves: with their ‘narrow benches’, and their shredded onions, and – a new failing Ah-Q had had opportunity to observe – the women’s failure to wiggle their hips properly when they walked. But the town had its points, too. The peasants of Weizhuang, for example, gambled with bits of bamboo – only the Fake Foreign Devil knew anything about ‘moh-jang’ [sic]. In town, though, even the lowest lowlife were experts at the game. Pit the Fake Foreign Devil against a ten-year-old beggar from town, and he’d be mincemeat. (At which disrespect, every listener blushed.)","According to Ah Q, his return was also due to his dissatisfaction with the townspeople because they called a long bench a straight bench, used shredded shallots to fry fish, and—a defect he had recently discovered—the women did not sway in a very satisfactory manner as they walked. However, the town had its good points too; for instance, in Weizhuang everyone played with thirty-two bamboo counters and only the Bogus Foreign Devil could play mahjong, but in town even the street urchins excelled at mahjong. You had only to place the Bogus Foreign Devil in the hands of these young rascals in their teens for him straightway to become like “a small devil before the King of Hell.” This part of the story made all who heard it blush."

He peeked into the room, the lights were so brilliant, the jawbone was so mocking, and he was unusually afraid of people, so he didn't dare to look there again. Hiding in the shadows under the eaves in the distance, he felt more peaceful; but in this peace, he heard a whispering whisper in his ear:","A chill ran down him. Releasing the bone back into its hole, he fled out into the courtyard. He glanced nervously back at the room: the lamp burning as brilliantly as ever, the jawbone still mocking him. Averting his eyes, terrified, he took refuge as far away as he could, struggling to calm himself in the shadows beneath the eaves.","An icy shudder went through him. He let it go.

He looked at the Wang Hu, but there were one after another, two and three, only the sound of peeling and peeling in his mouth.","Ah-Q also took off his tattered jacket, turned it inside out and began checking it over for lice of his own. Perhaps because he had washed it too recently, or because he didn’t look hard enough, after expending much time and effort he succeeded in locating only three or four. He glanced across at Wang, catching one after another and popping them between his teeth.","Ah Q took off his tattered lined jacket and turned it inside out; but either because he had washed it recently or because he was too clumsy, a long search yielded only three or four lice.

他于是教书去了；大家也走散。不一会，仲密夫人拿冷饭来喂他们时，在远处已听得泼水的声响，跑到一看，原来那四个小鸭都在荷池里洗澡了，而且还翻筋斗，吃东西呢。等到拦他们上了岸，全池已经是浑水，过了半天，澄清了，只见泥里露出几条细藕来；而且再也寻不出一个已经生了脚的科斗了。,"So he went to teach; they all got separated. After a while, when Mrs. Zhongmi brought cold rice to feed them, she could hear the sound of water splashing in the distance. She ran to see that the four ducklings were bathing in the lotus pond, and they were doing somersaults and eating. something. By the time they stopped them from landing, the whole pond was already muddy water. After a long time, it was clarified, only to see a few fine lotus roots emerging from the mud;","Off he then went to teach, with everyone else dispersing to their various tasks. When my sister-in-law returned in a little while to feed them some leftover rice, she heard the sound of splashing. Running over to investigate, she discovered the four ducklings having a bath in the pond: turning upside down, probably looking for food. By the time she had got them back on to dry land, the pond water was murky with silt. When at last it cleared again, only a few tendrils of lotus emerged into view.","Then he went off to a class, and the others dispersed. When presently Mrs. Zhong Mi took out some left-over rice for the ducklings, she heard a distant splashing and, running over to look, saw the four of them having a bath in the lotus pool. They were turning somersaults too and eating something. By the time she shooed them ashore, the water in the pool was muddy. When eventually the mud settled, all that could be seen were a few thin lotus roots. Not a single tadpole that had grown legs was left."
赵七爷是邻村茂源酒店的主人，又是这三十里方圆以内的唯一的出色人物兼学问家；因为有学问，所以又有些遗老的臭味。他有十多本金圣叹批评的《三国志》[2]，时常坐着一个字一个字的读；他不但能说出五虎将姓名，甚而至于还知道黄忠表字汉升和马超表字孟起。革命以后，他便将辫子盘在顶上，像道士一般；常常叹息说，倘若赵子龙在世，天下便不会乱到这地步了。七斤嫂眼睛好，早望见今天的赵七爷已经不是道士，却变成光滑头皮，乌黑发顶；伊便知道这一定是皇帝坐了龙庭，而且一定须有辫子，而且七斤一定是非常危险。因为赵七爷的这件竹布长衫，轻易是不常穿的，三年以来，只穿过两次；一次是和他呕气的麻子阿四病了的时候，一次是曾经砸烂他酒店的鲁大爷死了的时候；现在是第三次了，这一定又是于他有庆，于他的仇家有殃了。,"Zhao Qiye is the owner of the Maoyuan Hotel in the neighboring village, and he is the only outstanding person and scholar within the 30-mile radius. Because of his learning, he smells of old age. He has more than ten books of the Three Kingdoms[2] criticized by Jin Shengtan, and he often sits and reads it word by word. After the revolution, he would put his braids on the top like a Taoist priest; he often sighed and said, if Zhao Zilong were alive, the world would not be so chaotic. Qijin's sister-in-law has good eyes. I saw that today's Zhao Qiye is no longer a Taoist priest, but has a smooth scalp and black hair; Yi knew that this must be the emperor sitting in the Dragon Court, and he must have braids, and Qijin must be is very dangerous. Because Zhao Qiye's bamboo cloth gown is not often worn very often. In the past three years, he has only worn it twice; once when he was sick with his disgusting pock-marked Asi, and once when he smashed his hotel When the uncle Lu died; now is the third time, this must be a blessing for him, and a disaster for his enemy.","Proprietor of the Splendid, the tavern in the neighbouring village, Mr Zhao was the only man of any distinction or education within ten miles. A celebrated fogey, he was often to be found poring over his multivolume set of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, annotated by the great seventeenth-century scholar Jin Shengtan. Give him the chance, and he would reel off not only the names of the five Tiger Generals of Shu1 but also at least two of their honorifics. After the 1911 Revolution, he had coiled his queue up on to his head, like a Daoist priest. If there was just a bit more of The Romance of the Three Kingdoms spirit about today, he would often sigh to himself, things would not be in the pickle they were. Mrs Seven-Pounds had a pair of eyes in her head: even from that distance, she could see the gleam of his clean-shaven forehead, and the black jet of his liberated queue. She now knew for sure that the emperor was back on the throne, that queues were an essential requirement once more, and that Seven-Pounds was in mortal danger. This cotton gown was not everyday attire for Mr Zhao. Only twice had he worn it in the past three years: once when his sworn enemy, the pock-marked Ah-si, took ill; and once on the death of one Mr Lu, who had vandalized his tavern at some point in the past. And here it was again: joy for him, sorrow for his enemies.","Seventh Master Zhao was the owner of Abundance Tavern in the next village, the only notable within a radius of thirty li who also had some learning. And because of this learning there was about him a whiff of the musty odour of a departed age. He owned a dozen volumes of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms annotated by Jin Shengtan, which he would sit poring over character by character. Not only could he tell you the names of the Five Tiger Generals, he even knew that Huang Zhong was also known as Hansheng, and Ma Chao as Mengqi. After the Revolution he had coiled his queue on the top of his head like a Taoist priest, and he often remarked with a sigh that if only Zhao Yun were still alive the empire would not be in such a bad way. Mrs. Sevenpounder's eyesight was good. She had noticed at once that Seventh Master Zhao no longer looked like a Taoist. He had shaved the front of his head and let his queue down. From this she knew beyond a doubt that an emperor had ascended the throne, that queues were required again, and that Sevenpounder must be in great danger. For Seventh Master Zhao did not wear his long glazed cotton gown for nothing. During the last three years he had only worn it twice: once when his enemy Pock-marked Asi fell ill, once when First Master Lu who had wrecked his wineshop died. This was the third time, and it undoubtedly meant that something had happened to rejoice his heart and bode ill for his enemies."
“伊罗希珂先，没有了，虾蟆的儿子。”傍晚时候，孩子们一见他回来，最小的一个便赶紧说。,"""Iroshike first, there is no more, son of Shrimp."" In the evening, when the children saw him coming back, the youngest said quickly.","The tadpoles, and their new legs, were nowhere to be seen. ‘Mr Airyshego,’ the smallest of the children rushed over to tell him, as soon as he returned that evening, ‘the frog babies are all gone.’","“They've gone, Mr. Eroshenko, the baby frogs.” The smallest child made haste to announce this as soon as he came back that evening."

他还认得路，于是有些诧异了：怎么不向着法场走呢？他不知道这是在游街，在示众。但即使知道也一样，他不过便以为人生天地间，大约本来有时也未免要游街要示众罢了。,"He still knew the way, so he was a little surprised: Why didn't he walk toward the Dharma field? He didn't know that this was a parade and a public display. But even if he knew it was the same, he just thought that in the world of life, he would have to parade in the streets to show the public at times.","He recognized the road they were on. Why weren’t they taking him to the execution ground? he wondered. He wasn’t to know they were making a tour of the streets, to make a public example of him. Even if he had known, though, it wouldn’t have made any difference to him. In the rich tapestry that is life, he would have concluded, a man is destined sometimes to be made a public example of.","He still recognized the road and felt rather surprised: Why were they not going to the execution ground? He did not know that he was being paraded round the streets as a public example. But if he had known, it would have been the same: he would only have thought that in this world probably it was the fate of everybody at some time to be made a public example of."

阿Q近来虽然比较的受人尊敬，自己也更高傲些，但和那些打惯的闲人们见面还胆怯，独有这回却非常武勇了。这样满脸胡子的东西，也敢出言无状么？,"Although Ah Q has been more respected recently, and he has become more arrogant, he is still timid when meeting idlers who are used to fighting, but this time he is very brave. How dare someone with such a full beard dare to speak out?","Even though Ah-Q had become more imperious of late, thanks to the greater portion of public respect he had grown accustomed to accepting as his due, his courage usually sank to his boots whenever he encountered his regular tormentors among Weizhuang’s idling population. This time, however, he rose heroically to the occasion – was he to stand by and let someone with facial hair like that insult him?","Although the relative respect accorded him in recent years had increased Ah Q's pride, he was still rather timid when confronted by those loafers accustomed to fighting. But today he was feeling exceptionally pugnacious. How dare a hairy-cheeked creature like this insult him?"
但单四嫂子待他的宝儿，实在已经尽了心，再没有什么缺陷。昨天烧过一串纸钱，上午又烧了四十九卷《大悲咒》[4]；收敛的时候，给他穿上顶新的衣裳，平日喜欢的玩意儿，——一个泥人，两个小木碗，两个玻璃瓶，——都放在枕头旁边。后来王九妈掐着指头仔细推敲，也终于想不出一些什么缺陷。,"But Shan Si's sister-in-law has really done her best to treat his Bao'er, and there is no more defect. Yesterday, I burned a bunch of paper money, and in the morning I burned forty-nine volumes of the Great Compassion Mantra[4]; when I was calming down, I put on the newest clothes for him, the things I liked on weekdays—a clay figurine, two small wooden figurines. The bowl, the two glass jars, -- all next to the pillow. Later, Wang Jiu Ma pinched her fingers and scrutinized it carefully, and finally she could not think of any flaws.","Mrs Shan did everything properly. On the day of the death itself, she had burnt a chain of paper money; the following morning, forty-nine scrolls of Buddhist incantations were consigned to the flames. Bao’er had been placed in the coffin wearing his newest clothes, with his favourite toys laid on the pillow next to him – a clay figurine, two small wooden bowls and two glass bottles. One by one, Mrs Wang ticked everything off on her fingers.","Fourth Shan's Wife had really done all she could for her Pao-erh— nothing had been forgotten. The previous day she had burned a string of paper coins, this morning she had burned the forty-nine books of the Incantation of Great Mercy,2 and before putting him in the coffin she had dressed him in his newest clothes and set by his pillow all the toys he liked best—a little clay figure, two small wooden bowls, two glass bottles. Though Ninth Aunt Wang reckoned carefully on her fingers, even then she could not think of anything they had forgotten."
星期日的早晨，我揭去一张隔夜的日历，向着新的那一张上看了又看的说：,"On Sunday morning, I took off one of the overnight calendars, looked at the new one, and said:","Early one Sunday morning, I tore the previous day’s page off the calendar.","On Sunday morning, I turned over a page of my calendar and looked at the next one."

We’re not sons beating our father – we’re men beating an animal. Repeat after us: men beating an animal!’",A man beating a beast!”
这一日里，蓝皮阿五简直整天没有到；咸亨掌柜便替单四嫂子雇了两名脚夫，每名二百另十个大钱，抬棺木到义冢地上安放。王九妈又帮他煮了饭，凡是动过手开过口的人都吃了饭。太阳渐渐显出要落山的颜色；吃过饭的人也不觉都显出要回家的颜色，——于是他们终于都回了家。,"During this day, Lanpi Awu did not arrive all day long; the shopkeeper of Xianheng hired two porters for Shansi's sister-in-law, each with two hundred and ten big money, and carried the coffin to the cemetery for placement. Wang Jiu Ma helped him cook again, and everyone who opened their mouths with their hands ate it. The sun gradually showed the color of going to set; the people who had eaten didn't even realize it was going to go home - so they all went home at last.","Since Ah-wu failed to show up, the manager of the Universal Prosperity hired two bearers – at a cost of two hundred and ten coppers each – on Mrs Shan’s behalf, to carry the coffin to its final resting place in a pauper’s grave. Mrs Wang then helped her prepare food for anyone who had moved a muscle or said a word in contribution. Slowly, the sun turned the colour it turned when it was about to slip behind the western hills, the diners all turned the colour they turned when bedtime approached, and went home to bed.","Since Blue-skinned Ah-wu did not turn up all day, the landlord of Prosperity Tavern hired two porters for Fourth Shan's Wife at 210 large coppers each, who carried the coffin to the public graveyard and dug a grave. Ninth Aunt Wang helped her prepare a meal to which everyone who had lifted a finger or opened his mouth was invited. Soon the sun made it clear that it was about to set, and the guests unwittingly made it clear that they were about to leave—home they all went."
“喂，怎么只有两盘？”听了“不高尚说”这一日的晚餐时候，他看着菜蔬说。,"""Hey, why are there only two plates?"" He looked at the vegetables and said during the dinner that day after listening to the ""not noble talk"".","‘How come there’s only two dishes?’ As neither of them had been blessed by a modern education, his wife had not been privileged to receive a serviceably dignified given name for public or private use.","“Hey, why are there only two dishes?” he asked, eyeing the supper table, the evening after hearing this stricture on “poor taste.”"
未庄人都用了惊惧的眼光对他看。这一种可怜的眼光，是阿Q从来没有见过的，一见之下，又使他舒服得如六月里喝了雪水。他更加高兴的走而且喊道：,"The people of Weichuang looked at him with frightened eyes. This kind of pitiful gaze was something Ah Q had never seen before, and upon seeing it, it made him feel as comfortable as drinking snow water in June. He went away even more cheerful and shouted:","he began shouting jubilantly. The residents of Weizhuang looked fearfully at him, their newly abject terror as refreshing to Ah-Q as a mouthful of snow on a high-summer’s day. ‘Hurrah!’ he yelled again, his spirits soaring higher.","All the villagers stared at him in consternation. Ah Q had never seen such pitiful looks before; they refreshed him as much as a drink of iced water in summer. So he walked on even more happily, shouting:"

这一对白兔，似乎离娘并不久，虽然是异类，也可以看出他们的天真烂熳来，但也竖直了小小的通红的长耳朵，动着鼻子，眼睛里颇现些惊疑的神色，大约究竟觉得人地生疏，没有在老家时候的安心了。这种东西，倘到庙会[1]日期自己出去买，每个至多不过两吊钱，而三太太却花了一元，因为是叫小使上店买来的。,"This pair of white rabbits seems to have not been away from their mother very long. Although they are aliens, it can be seen that their innocence is rotten, but they also erect their small red long ears, move their noses, and have a look of surprise in their eyes. , I probably feel that people are unfamiliar, and I don't have the peace of mind when I was in my hometown. This kind of thing, if you go out to buy it on the day of the temple fair[1], it will only cost two bucks at most, but the third wife spends one yuan, because it is bought by the little envoy.","They seemed barely weaned – both had this look of vulnerable, animal innocence about them. All the same, the moment they arrived, they pricked up their long, delicate, pink ears, noses twitching, eyes apprehensively alert. They could probably sense they were in a strange place, with strange people; that they were away from the comforting security of home. You’d have got them for no more than twenty coppers each at a temple bazaar, but as she’d sent her servant out to a shop for them, they’d cost my sister-in-law two whole dollars.","Apparently these two white rabbits had not left their mother long. Although a different species, their carefree innocence was evident. But they also raised their long, small crimson ears and wrinkled their noses, a very apprehensive look in their eyes. Probably, after all, they felt this place and the people here strange, and were less at ease here than in their old home. If you went to a temple fair yourself to buy creatures like these, they cost no more than two strings of cash apiece; but Third Mistress had spent a dollar, because she sent a servant to a shop to buy them."

未庄本不是大村镇，不多时便走尽了，村外多是水田，满眼是新秧的嫩绿，夹着几个圆形的活动的黑点，便是耕田的农夫。阿Q并不赏鉴这田家乐，却只是走，因为他直觉的知道这与他的“求食”之道是很辽远的。但他终于走到静修庵的墙外了。,"Weichuang is not a big village and town, and it will be gone in a short time. Outside the village are mostly paddy fields, the eyes are full of fresh greenery, and there are a few round black spots that are moving. Ah Q didn't appreciate Tian Jiale, but just walked away, because he intuitively knew that it was very far from his way of ""seeking food"". But he finally made it to the walls of the retreat monastery.","Weizhuang was not a big place, and soon enough he reached the end of it. The village was fringed by paddy fields busy with pale green shoots. The occasional black dot wove among them: farmers working their land. Without stopping to appreciate this pastoral idyll, Ah-Q went on; he still had some way to go, he intuited, on his quest for food. Eventually, he neared the Convent of Quiet Cultivation.","Since Weizhuang was not a big place, he soon left it behind. Most of the country outside the village consisted of paddy fields, green as far as the eye could see with the tender shoots of young rice, dotted here and there with round, black, moving objects—peasants cultivating their fields. But blind to the delights of country life, Ah Q simply went on his way, for he knew instinctively that this was far removed from his “search for food.” Finally, however, he came to the walls of the Convent of Quiet Self-improvement."
几天之后，他竟在钱府的照壁前遇见了小D，“仇人相见分外眼明”，阿Q便迎上去，小D也站住了。,"A few days later, he actually met Xiao D in front of the screen wall of the Qian Mansion. ""The enemy is very discerning when they meet each other."" Ah Q went up to meet him, and Xiao D also stopped.","A few days later, he at last encountered D opposite the main gate to the Qians’. Eyes gleaming with antagonistic recognition, Ah-Q advanced, with D holding his ground.","A few days later he did indeed meet Young D in front of Mr. Qian's house. “When two foes meet, there is no mistaking each other.” As Ah Q advanced upon him, Young D stood his ground."
我知道无话可说了，便闭了口，默默的站着。,"Knowing that I had nothing to say, I closed my mouth and stood silently.","I held my ground, keeping my mouth resignedly shut.","Knowing there was nothing I could say, I remained silent."

赵七爷一路走来，坐着吃饭的人都站起身，拿筷子点着自己的饭碗说，“七爷，请在我们这里用饭！”七爷也一路点头，说道“请请”，却一径走到七斤家的桌旁。七斤们连忙招呼，七爷也微笑着说“请请”，一面细细的研究他们的饭菜。,"Zhao Qiye walked all the way, and everyone who was sitting to eat stood up, lit their rice bowls with chopsticks and said, ""Seventh Master, please eat here with us!"" He walked directly to the table of Qijin's house. Qijin hurriedly greeted them, and Qiye also smiled and said ""please, please"", while studying their meals carefully.","Every diner stood up as Mr Zhao rippled past, touching their chopsticks to their rice bowls, inviting him to sit down and share their meal. ‘ Carry on, carry on,’ he nodded as he glided swiftly on to Seven-Pounds’s establishment, which wasted no time in offering him fulsome greeting. ‘Carry on, carry on,’ their visitor smiled, taking careful note of that evening’s menu.","As Seventh Master Zhao passed them, all those sitting eating stood up and, pointing their chopsticks at their rice bowls, invited him to join them.

阿Q要画圆圈了，那手捏着笔却只是抖，于是那人替他将纸铺在地上，阿Q伏下去，使尽了平生的力画圆圈。他生怕被人笑话，立志要画得圆，但这可恶的笔不但很沉重，并且不听话，刚刚一抖一抖的几乎要合缝，却又向外一耸，画成瓜子模样了。,"Ah Q was about to draw a circle, but his hand was shaking while holding the pen, so the man spread the paper on the ground for him, and Ah Q fell down and tried his best to draw a circle.

It was almost stitched together with just a flick, but it swung outwards and drew like a melon seed.","Although Ah-Q wanted to draw a perfect circle, his hand shook uncontrollably. So the man then spread the paper over the floor for him. Bending over, Ah-Q focused all his energies on the drawing of this circle. Afraid of looking ridiculous, he was determined to make it round, and yet that wretched brush weighed heavy in his hands, veering disobediently to one side as he struggled to make the two ends meet. Though Ah-Q felt this melon seed of a circle had covered him in shame, the man seemed unbothered, confiscating both paper and brush.","Ah Q tried to draw a circle, but the hand with which he grasped the brush trembled, so the man spread the paper on the ground for him.

我从此便整天的站在柜台里，专管我的职务。虽然没有什么失职，但总觉得有些单调，有些无聊。掌柜是一副凶脸孔，主顾也没有好声气，教人活泼不得；只有孔乙己到店，才可以笑几声，所以至今还记得。,"I have been standing at the counter all day since then, taking care of my duties. Although there is no dereliction of duty, I always feel a little monotonous and a little boring. The shopkeeper has a fierce face, and the customers are not good-natured, so he can't teach people to be lively; only when Kong Yiji came to the store could he laugh a few times, so I still remember it to this day.","All day, every day I spent behind the bar, devoting myself to this task – bored senseless, even though I never made any mistakes.

He went to the book very early, and as soon as he saw the list, he first looked for the words on it. There are also a lot of words Chen, and it seems that they all jumped into his eyes, but what followed was not the word ""Shicheng"" at all. He then searched again in the circle chart[1] of the twelve lists, and all the people who saw it were gone, but Chen Shicheng finally didn't see it on the list, and stood in front of the screen wall of the test house.","It was well past noon by the time Chen Shicheng was back from seeing the results for the county-level civil service examinations. He had set out early and begun searching for the surname Chen the instant he saw the list. Though there was no lack of Chens clamouring for his attention, none was followed by the all-important words shi and cheng. Carefully, methodically, vainly he made a second search through the twelve-page roster. By the time he had finished, he stood alone before the wall opposite the college of examinations, the crowds of other interested onlookers long dispersed.","It was afternoon before Chen Shicheng came back from seeing the results of the county examinations. He had gone very early, and the first thing he looked for on the list was the name Chen. Quite a few Chens leapt to meet his eye, but none followed by the characters Shicheng, thereupon, starting again, he made a careful search through all twelve lists. Even after everyone else had left, the name Chen Shicheng had not appeared on the list but the man was still standing there, a solitary figure before the front wall of the examination school."
我捏起筷子，便想起我大哥；晓得妹子死掉的缘故，也全在他。那时我妹子才五岁，可爱可怜的样子，还在眼前。母亲哭个不住，他却劝母亲不要哭；大约因为自己吃了，哭起来不免有点过意不去。如果还能过意不去，……,"I picked up my chopsticks and thought of my eldest brother; he knew that the reason for the girl's death was also due to him. At that time, my sister was only five years old, and her lovely and pitiful appearance was still in front of her eyes. His mother couldn't stop crying, but he advised her not to cry; probably because he ate it, he couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed when he cried. If you can still feel bad about it,...","As I held my chopsticks, I thought again of my brother. Now I know what happened to my sister. I can see her now, in all her heartbreaking vulnerability; only four years old when she left us. I remember my mother’s uncontrollable sobs, my brother’s efforts to stop her. He’d probably eaten her himself, and all the crying was making him uncomfortable. If he had any conscience left…","Picking up my chopsticks, I thought of my elder brother. I know now how my little sister died: it was all through him. My sister was only five at the time. I can still remember how sweet she looked, poor thing. Mother wept as if she would never stop, but he begged her not to cry, probably because he had eaten our sister himself and so this weeping made him rather ashamed. If he had any sense of shame...."

A few days ago, I heard of a serious illness; when I was returning to my hometown, I visited only one person, and said that the person who was ill was his younger brother. Lao Jun came to see him from afar, but he had already recovered early, and he went to a certain place to wait [1]. Because of the laughter, I showed two volumes of the diary, which means that I can see the symptoms of the day, so I might as well present it to my old friends. After reviewing it, you will know what you are suffering from, and it will be ""persecution madness"" and the like. The language is quite incoherent, and there are many absurd words; it does not match the moon and the day, but the ink color and font are different, and it is not written at a time. There are also people who have a little contact between them, and this is an excerpt for medical research. It is not easy to remember a single word in Chinese, but even though the names of the people are all from the village, they are not known to the world, and they have nothing to do with the general situation, but they are easy to go. As for the title of the book, I will not change it again. Known on April 2, seven years.","At school I had been close friends with two brothers whose names I will omit to mention here. As the years went by after we graduated, however, we gradually lost touch. Not long ago, I happened to hear that one of them had been seriously ill and, while on a visit home, I broke my journey to call on them. I found only one of them at home, who told me it was his younger brother who had been afflicted. Thanking me for my concern, he informed me that his brother had long since made a full recovery and had left home to wait for an appropriate official post to fall vacant. Smiling broadly, he showed me two volumes of a diary his brother had written at the time, explaining that they would give me an idea of the sickness that had taken hold of him and that he saw no harm in showing them to an old friend. Reading them back home, I discovered his brother had suffered from what is known as a ‘persecution complex’. The text was fantastically confused, and entirely undated; it was only differences in ink and styles of handwriting that enabled me to surmise parts of the text were written at different times. Below, I have extracted occasional flashes of coherence, in the hope they may be of use to medical research. While I have not altered a single one of the author’s errors, I have changed all the local names used in the original, despite the personal obscurity of the individuals involved. Finally, I have made use of the title chosen by the invalid himself following his full recovery. 2 April 1918","Two brothers, whose names I need not mention here, were both good friends of mine in high school; but after a separation of many years we gradually lost touch. Some time ago I happened to hear that one of them was seriously ill, and since I was going back to my old home I broke my journey to call on them. I saw only one, however, who told me that the invalid was his younger brother. “I appreciate your coming such a long way to see us,” he said, “but my brother recovered some time ago and has gone elsewhere to take up an official post.” Then, laughing, he produced two volumes of his brother's diary, saying that from these the nature of his past illness could be seen and there was no harm in showing them to an old friend. I took the diary away, read it through, and found that he had suffered from a form of persecution complex. The writing was most confused and incoherent, and he had made many wild statements; moreover he had omitted to give any dates, so that only by the colour of the ink and the differences in the writing could one tell that it was not all written at one time. Certain sections, however, were not altogether disconnected, and I have copied out a part to serve as a subject for medical research. I have not altered a single illogicality in the diary and have changed only the names, even though the people referred to are all country folk, unknown to the world and of no consequence. As for the title, it was chosen by the diarist himself after his recovery, and I did not change it."
大家左索右索，总算一节一节的挨过去了，但比起先前来，方玄绰究竟是万分的拮据，所以使用的小厮和交易的店家不消说，便是方太太对于他也渐渐的缺了敬意，只要看伊近来不很附和，而且常常提出独创的意见，有些唐突的举动，也就可以了然了。到了阴历五月初四的午前，他一回来，伊便将一叠账单塞在他的鼻子跟前，这也是往常所没有的。,"Everyone strove from left to right, and finally got through it one by one, but compared to before, Fang Xuanchuo was extremely poor, so it goes without saying that the servant he used and the store who traded, even Mrs. Fang was also very concerned about him. Gradually lack of respect, as long as Yi is not very agreeable recently, and often puts forward original opinions, some abrupt actions, it can be understood. Before noon on the fourth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, when he came back, Yi stuffed a stack of bills in front of his nose, which was also not usual.","Everyone scraped by, from week to week, borrowing here and borrowing there. But life for Fang Xuanchuo was infinitely harder than it had once been. In time, everyone he had day-today dealings with – his servant, the local shopkeepers, even Mrs Fang – became increasingly lacking in deference. His wife had been finding less and less to agree with him about of late; often enough, she even expressed her own opinions, and was decidedly off-hand in manner. Just before noon, on the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival in early May, she took the unprecedented course of thrusting a pile of receipts in his face as soon as he arrived home.","With all these demands for payment right and left, they managed to get by somehow. But compared with the past he was in such desperate straits that, quite apart from his servant and the tradesmen with whom he dealt, even Mrs. Fang gradually lost her respect for him. You could tell this just from her recent lack of compliance, the way she often put forward her own views, and her rather brash behaviour. When he arrived home before noon on the fourth of the fifth lunar month, she thrust a pile of bills under his nose—something quite unprecedented."

然而养成池沼的音乐家却只是爱罗先珂君的一件事。他是向来主张自食其力的，常说女人可以畜牧，男人就应该种田。所以遇到很熟的友人，他便要劝诱他就在院子里种白菜；也屡次对仲密夫人劝告，劝伊养蜂，养鸡，养猪，养牛，养骆驼。后来仲密家里果然有了许多小鸡，满院飞跑，啄完了铺地锦的嫩叶，大约也许就是这劝告的结果了。,"However, the cultivation of musicians in the pond is only one thing that loves Rassenko-kun. He has always advocated self-reliance, often saying that women can raise livestock, and men should farm. So when he met a friend he knew very well, he tried to persuade him to grow cabbage in the yard. He also advised Mrs. Zhongmi many times, persuading Yi to keep bees, chickens, pigs, cattle, and camels. Later, Zhong Mi's house really had a lot of chickens, running around the courtyard and pecking the young leaves of the floor brocade, which may have been the result of this advice.","But tending to his amphibians was only one of Eroshenko’s projects. Practising self-sufficiency had always been another of his notions: women, he was often saying, could concentrate on the livestock, while their men worked the land. He was always trying to inveigle friends to grow cabbages in their courtyards, or advising my sister-in-law to keep bees, hens, pigs, cows and camels. In time, and probably in capitulation to Eroshenko, Zuoren’s courtyard became a run-around for chicks – skittering everywhere (on and above ground), pecking at the tender young leaves that carpeted the yard.","But raising a poolful of musicians was only one of Eroshenko's projects. A great advocate of self-sufficiency, he was all in favour of women keeping livestock and of men tilling the land. So whenever he met a good friend, he would advise him to go plant cabbages in his yard; and many a time he urged Mrs. Zhong Mi to keep bees, poultry, pigs, cows and camels. Subsequently, sure enough, many chicks appeared in the Zhong Mi household and flapped all over the yard, pecking it bare of the tender leaves on the ground. This was probably the outcome of his advice."

那船便将大不安载给了未庄，不到正午，全村的人心就很动摇。船的使命，赵家本来是很秘密的，但茶坊酒肆里却都说，革命党要进城，举人老爷到我们乡下来逃难了。惟有邹七嫂不以为然，说那不过是几口破衣箱，举人老爷想来寄存的，却已被赵太爷回复转去。其实举人老爷和赵秀才素不相能，在理本不能有“共患难”的情谊，况且邹七嫂又和赵家是邻居，见闻较为切近，所以大概该是伊对的。,"The boat carried the great anxiety to Weizhuang, and before noon, the hearts of the whole village were shaken. The mission of the boat, the Zhao family was originally a very secret, but the teahouses and wineries all said that the revolutionary party was going to enter the city, and the master of Juren came to our country to escape. Only Mrs. Zou Qi disagreed, saying that it was just a few ragged suitcases, which Master Juren wanted to store, but Mr. Zhao replied and transferred it. In fact, Master Juren and Zhao Xiucai are not compatible at all, and in principle they cannot have a friendship of ""sharing weal and woe"". Besides, Zou Qisao and Zhao's family are neighbors, and they have seen and heard closely, so probably Yi is right.","The boat brought with it great disquiet to Weizhuang; by midday, the village was in the grip of a full-scale panic. Although the Zhaos were keeping very quiet about the reason behind the boat’s arrival, the gossips in the teahouse and tavern were saying that the city was about to fall to the Revolutionary Party, and Mr Provincial Examination had taken refuge in the village. Only Mrs Zou stoutly refuted this version of events, countering that the boat had contained nothing more than a few old trunks that the great scholar had wanted to store in Weizhuang, and that Mr Zhao had already sent back. Mr Provincial Examination and the younger Zhao – the proud possessor, you will recall, of a county-level degree – were not, in truth, on any kind of terms; they were unlikely to become foul-weather friends. And since Mrs Zou lived next door to the Zhaos, she probably had her ear closer to the ground on the question than most of Weizhuang.","This incident caused great uneasiness in Weizhuang, and before midday the hearts of all the villagers were beating faster. The Zhao family kept very quiet about the errand of the boat, but according to gossip in the teahouse and tavern, the revolutionaries were going to enter the town and the successful provincial candidate had come to the country to take refuge. Mrs. Zou alone thought otherwise, maintaining that the successful candidate merely wanted to deposit a few battered cases in Weizhuang, but that Mrs. Zhao had sent them back. Actually the successful provincial candidate and the successful county candidate in the Zhao family were not on good terms, to that it was scarcely logical to expect them to prove friends in adversity; moreover, since Mrs. Zou was a neighbour of the Zhao family and had a better idea of what was going on, she ought to have known."

我不喝水，支撑着仍然看，也说不出见了些什么，只觉得戏子的脸都渐渐的有些稀奇了，那五官渐不明显，似乎融成一片的再没有什么高低。年纪小的几个多打呵欠了，大的也各管自己谈话。忽而一个红衫的小丑被绑在台柱子上，给一个花白胡子的用马鞭打起来了，大家才又振作精神的笑着看。在这一夜里，我以为这实在要算是最好的一折。,"I didn't drink water, but I kept watching, and I couldn't tell what I saw. I just felt that the actor's face was gradually becoming a little strange, and the facial features were becoming less obvious, and it seemed that there was no higher or lower level of fusion. The younger ones yawned more, and the older ones kept their conversations on their own. Suddenly, a red-shirted clown was tied to a pillar and whipped a gray-bearded man with a horsewhip, and everyone cheered up and watched with a smile. For the night, I thought it was the best deal.","Propping myself up, I watched on, without bothering with the water. I couldn’t have described what I was seeing: the performers’ faces began to blur curiously – until I was unable to distinguish one from the other. While the older members of our party chatted away, the younger ones started to yawn. Only when a clown in a scarlet shirt was tied to one of the pillars on the stage and whipped by an actor with a grey beard did everyone start to pay proper attention again – watching and laughing. It was definitely the best thing I saw all night.","Instead of drinking the water, I stuck it out as best I could. I cannot say what I saw, but by degrees something strange seemed to happen to the faces of the players, whose features blurred as if melting into one flattened surface. Most of the younger boys yawned, while the older ones chatted among themselves. It was only when clown in a red shirt was fastened to a pillar on the stage, and a greybeard started horsewhipping him, that we roused ourselves to watch again and laughed. I really think that was the best scene of the evening."
三太太从此不但深恨黑猫，而且颇不以大兔为然了。据说当初那两个被害之先，死掉的该还有，因为他们生一回，决不至于只两个，但为了哺乳不匀，不能争食的就先死了。这大概也不错的，现在七个之中，有两个很瘦弱。所以三太太一有闲空，便捉住母兔，将小兔一个一个轮流的摆在肚子上来喝奶，不准有多少。,"From then on, the third wife not only hated black cats, but also disliked big rabbits. It is said that before the two were killed, the ones who died should have died, because once they were born, there would never be only two, but because of uneven breastfeeding, the ones who couldn't compete for food died first. This is probably not bad, now out of the seven, two are very thin. Therefore, when the third wife has free time, she catches the mother rabbit and puts the little rabbits on her stomach one by one to drink milk, not much.","Henceforth, my sister-in-law not only conceived of a violent animosity towards the black cat, but also revised downwards her opinion of the mother rabbit. The first litter, she deduced, must have contained more than the two that were killed; the others must have died because they didn’t get a fair share of the milk. There was probably a good deal of truth in this, for two out of the present litter of seven were very thin and weak. Whenever she had a moment, she would hold the mother rabbit down, and give the babies equal turns against her stomach, to make sure they all got the same.","From that day on Third Mistress not only hated the black cat, but took a very dim view of the mother rabbit. She said, before the first two babies were killed, others must have died, because each litter was certainly more than two; but because of unequal suckling, those deprived of milk had starved. This sounded plausible, for two of the present litter of seven were very puny. So whenever Third Mistress had time, she would catch the mother rabbit and put the babies one by one on her belly to drink milk, no matter how long this took her. My mother remarked to me that, in all her life, she had never so much as heard to so much trouble taken over raising rabbits."
王胡惊得一跳，同时电光石火似的赶快缩了头，而听的人又都悚然而且欣然了。从此王胡瘟头瘟脑的许多日，并且再不敢走近阿Q的身边；别的人也一样。,"Wang Hu jumped in shock, and at the same time, he quickly shrank his head like lightning, and everyone who heard it was horrified and pleased. Since then, Wang Huwen has been in a state of turmoil for many days, and has never dared to approach Ah Q's side again; so do other people.","The terrified Wang pulled in his neck as quick as he could, while everyone else enjoyed a pleasurable frisson of horror. For days afterwards, Wang was far from his usual self.","Whiskers Wang gave a start, and jerked back his head as fast as lightning or a spark struck from a flint, while the bystanders shivered with pleasurable apprehension. After his, Whiskers Wang went about in a daze for many days and dared not go near Ah Q, nor did the others."

然而阿Q没有说，他早就两眼发黑，耳朵里嗡的一声，觉得全身仿佛微尘似的迸散了。,"However, Ah Q didn't say anything. His eyes had already turned black, and there was a buzzing sound in his ears. He felt that his whole body was scattered like dust.","But Ah-Q said nothing. His eyes were blind, his ears were buzzing, as if his body was scattered into so much dust.","But Ah Q never uttered these words.

他还在房外的院子里徘徊，眼里颇清净了，四近也寂静。但这寂静忽又无端的纷扰起来，他耳边又确凿听到急促的低声说：,"He was still wandering in the yard outside the house, his eyes were quite clear, and the surroundings were silent. But the silence suddenly and unprovoked disturbances, and he definitely heard a hurried whisper in his ear:","Calmer again, he paced up and down the courtyard beyond his rooms; around him, all was quiet. But turmoil suddenly returned.","He paced up and down the yard outside his room, his vision clear now, all around him still. But this stillness was abruptly and rudely shattered as in his ear he distinctly heard the urgent whisper:"
未庄的人心日见其安静了。据传来的消息，知道革命党虽然进了城，倒还没有什么大异样。知县大老爷还是原官，不过改称了什么，而且举人老爷也做了什么——这些名目，未庄人都说不明白——官，带兵的也还是先前的老把总[45]。只有一件可怕的事是另有几个不好的革命党夹在里面捣乱，第二天便动手剪辫子，听说那邻村的航船七斤便着了道儿，弄得不像人样子了。但这却还不算大恐怖，因为未庄人本来少上城，即使偶有想进城的，也就立刻变了计，碰不着这危险。阿Q本也想进城去寻他的老朋友，一得这消息，也只得作罢了。,"The hearts of Weichuang are increasingly quiet. According to the news, even though the revolutionary party has entered the city, there is no big difference. The magistrate magistrate was still the original official, but what was the name changed, and what did the Juren master do—the people of Weizhuang couldn’t explain these names—the officer, and the leader of the army was the old general[45]. The only terrible thing is that there are several bad revolutionary parties trapped in it and making troubles. The next day, they cut their braids. I heard that the boat from the neighboring village was 7 jins, and it looked like a human being. . But this is not too scary, because Weichuang people rarely go to the city, even if they want to enter the city occasionally, they will immediately change their plans and will not encounter this danger. Ah Q also wanted to go into the city to find his old friend, but as soon as he got the news, he had no choice but to give up.","With each passing day, the people of Weizhuang grew easier in their hearts. Although the rumours flying about told them that the Revolutionary Party had taken the town, nothing else much had changed. The county magistrate hadn’t changed, even though his official title had. Mr Provincial Examination had hung on to an official post, too – though no one in Weizhuang knew exactly what it was – and the captain of militia was, well, still the captain of militia. The only source of disquiet in Weizhuang’s smooth, untroubled waters was the habit of certain, bad elements among the revolutionaries of cutting queues off – a troubling development that had begun the day after the Revolution came to town. They’d got their hands on Seven-Pounds, the boatman from a neighbouring village, who’d come out of it looking a perfect sight. Yet calm was, for the most part, preserved, because the residents of Weizhuang rarely, if ever, ventured into town; and even if they had been planning a trip, they swiftly changed their minds. Ah-Q had had an idea of going in, to look for an old friend of his, but abandoned it as soon as this piece of news reached him.","The people of Weizhuang felt easier in their minds with each passing day. From the news brought they knew that although the revolutionaries had entered the town their coming had not made a great deal of difference, the magistrate was still the highest official, it was only his title that had changed; and the successful provincial candidate also had some post—the Weizhuang villagers could not remember these clearly—some kind of official post; while the head of the military was still the same old captain. The only cause for alarm was that, the day after their arrival, some bad revolutionaries made trouble by cutting off people's queues. It was said that the boatman Sevenpounder from the next village had fallen into their clutches, and that he no longer looked presentable. Still, the danger of this was not great, because the Weizhuang villagers seldom went to town to begin with, and those who had been considering a trip there at once changed their minds in order to avoid this risk. Ah Q had been thinking of going to town to look up his old friends, but as soon as he heard the news he gave up the idea."
扑的一声，六斤手里的空碗落在地上了，恰巧又碰着一块砖角，立刻破成一个很大的缺口。七斤直跳起来，检起破碗，合上了检查一回，也喝道，“入娘的！”一巴掌打倒了六斤。六斤躺着哭，九斤老太拉了伊的手，连说着“一代不如一代”，一同走了。,"With a thud, the empty bowl in Liu Jin's hand fell to the ground, and it happened to touch the corner of a brick, which immediately broke into a big gap. Qijin jumped up, picked up the broken bowl, closed it for inspection, and shouted, ""You're a mother!"" He knocked down Liujin with a slap. Liu Jin was lying down and crying, and the old lady Jiu Jin took Yi's hand, and even said ""a generation is not as good as a generation"" and left together.","The empty bowl in Six-Pounds’s hand fell to the ground. By bad luck, it struck against a brick, cracking a great hole in it. Springing to his feet, Seven-Pounds gathered up the pieces and fitted them together. Swearing as he inspected the damage, he dealt his daughter a slap that knocked her to the ground. And there she lay bawling, until her great-grandmother pulled her up by the hand. ‘The youth of today,’ she could still be heard muttering, as they went off together.","The empty bowl in Sixpounder's hand thudded to the ground striking the corner of a brick so that a big piece broke off. Sevenpounder jumped to his feet and picked up the broken bowl. Having fitted the pieces together he examined it, swearing, “Mother's!” He gave Sixpounder a slap that knocked her over. Sixpounder lay there crying until Old Mrs. Ninepounder took her hand and led her away repeating, “Each generation is worse than the last.”"
小鸭也诚然是可爱，遍身松花黄，放在地上，便蹒跚的走，互相招呼，总是在一处。大家都说好，明天去买泥鳅来喂他们罢。爱罗先珂君说，这钱也可以归我出的。,"The ducklings are indeed cute. They are covered in pine flowers and yellow, and they are placed on the ground. They stagger away, greet each other, and are always in one place. Everyone said yes, go buy loach tomorrow to feed them. Erosenke-kun said, I can also pay for the money.","The ducklings were, in truth, irresistible: tottering along in a golden-yellow phalanx, chirping away to each other. The following day, everyone agreed, someone would go out and buy loaches for them to eat. ‘I’ll pay,’ Eroshenko said.","And those ducklings were really lovable, covered with golden down. Set on the ground they waddled about, calling to each other and always keeping together. Everybody praised them and said they must buy some loaches the next day to feed them. Eroshenko said, “You must let me pay for it.”"

阿Q自然都答应了，可惜没有钱，幸而已经春天，棉被可以无用，便质了二千大钱，履行条约，赤膊磕头之后，居然还剩几文，他也不再赎毡帽，统统喝了酒了。但赵家也并不烧香点烛，因为太太拜佛的时候可以用，留着了。那破布衫是大半做了少奶奶八月间生下来的孩子的衬尿布，那小半破烂的便都做了吴妈的鞋底。,"Ah Q naturally agreed, but unfortunately he had no money. Fortunately, it was spring and the quilt was useless, so he pledged 2,000 yuan, fulfilled the contract, and kowtowed bare-chested, but he still had a few cents left. He also stopped redeeming the felt hat and drank all out of wine. However, the Zhao family did not burn incense and light candles, because the wife could use it when she prayed to Buddha, so she kept it. The rags were mostly used as diapers for the children born by the young grandma in August, and the rags were used as soles for Wu Ma's shoes.","Regrettably, Ah-Q lacked the funds to make good his indemnity. But as, by happy coincidence, it was spring, he was able to do without his cotton quilt, which he pawned for two thousand coppers, enabling him to fulfil the demands of the peace treaty. After kowtowing, bare-chested, he found himself with a few coppers left over, which he chose to blow on wine rather than redeem his felt hat. The Zhaos didn’t burn the candles and incense right away, preferring to keep them for when the mistress of the house next paid her respects to the Buddha. Most of his tattered old shirt was recycled into nappies for the baby that was born to the younger mistress in the eighth month; any off-cuts were used by Mrs Wu for the soles of her shoes.","Ah Q naturally agreed to everything, but unfortunately he had no ready money. Luckily it was already spring, so it was possible to do without his padded quilt which he pawned for two thousand cash to comply with the terms stipulated. After kowtowing with bare back he still had a few cash left, but instead of using these to redeem his felt hat from the bailiff, he spent them all on drink. Actually, the Zhao family burned neither the incense nor the candles, because these could be used when the mistress worshipped Buddha and were put aside for that purpose. Most of the ragged shirt was made into diapers for the baby which was born to the young mistress in the eighth moon, while the tattered remainder was used by Amah Wu to made shoe-soles."
散坐在讲堂里的二十多个听讲者，有的怅然了，或者是以为这话对；有的勃然了，大约是以为侮辱了神圣的青年；有几个却对他微笑了，大约以为这是他替自己的辩解：因为方玄绰就是兼做官僚的。,"Some twenty listeners who were scattered in the lecture hall were disappointed, or thought it was right; some were agitated, probably thinking that they had insulted the holy youth; some smiled at him, probably thinking that This is his defense for himself: because Fang Xuanchuo is also a bureaucrat.","Of his twenty-strong audience dotted about the lecture hall, some seemed depressed by what he said, perhaps because they felt there was some truth in it. Others again grew agitated: probably because they suspected him of showing disrespect to the sacred principle of Youth. A few, however, smiled, guessing that the philosophy he was expounding was one of self-defence – for Fang Xuanchuo was himself now a civil servant.","Of his twenty-odd auditors seated here and there in the classroom, some showed dismay, perhaps believing him right; some were angry, doubtless thinking this an insult to sacred youth; a few smiled at him, doubtless thinking this a self-justification—because Fang Xuanchuo also held an official post."

如是云云的教训了一通，阿Q自然没有话。临末，因为在晚上，应该送地保加倍酒钱四百文，阿Q正没有现钱，便用一顶毡帽做抵押，并且订定了五条件：,"If so, after all the lessons learned, Ah Q naturally had nothing to say. At the end of the day, because in the evening, the land insurance should be given double the price of the wine, four hundred wen, Ah Q had no cash, so he used a felt hat as collateral, and set five conditions:","On he went for a while, lecturing Ah-Q on his various misdeeds, to which the latter very naturally had nothing to say. As their meeting drew to its conclusion, Ah-Q had to tip the constable four hundred coppers – double the usual rate – because he’d been called out at night. Since Ah-Q had no cash on him, he mortgaged his felt hat, then was obliged to sign up to the following five conditions.","Under this torrent of abuse Ah Q naturally had nothing to say. Finally, since it was night-time, he had to pay the bailiff double: four hundred cash. Because he happened to have no ready money by him, he gave his felt hat as security, and agreed to the following five terms:"
最惹眼的是屹立在庄外临河的空地上的一座戏台，模胡在远处的月夜中，和空间几乎分不出界限，我疑心画上见过的仙境，就在这里出现了。这时船走得更快，不多时，在台上显出人物来，红红绿绿的动，近台的河里一望乌黑的是看戏的人家的船篷。,"The most eye-catching thing is a stage standing on the open space outside the village and facing the river. Mo Hu is in the moonlit night in the distance, and it is almost indistinguishable from the space. I suspect that the fairyland I have seen in the painting has appeared here. At this time, the boat went faster, and after a while, characters appeared on the stage, red, green and green moving. In the river near the stage, the black ones were the boat awnings of the people watching the show.","My eyes were drawn first to the stage, looming up out of an empty common just beyond the village proper – its outline only dimly visible from afar in the moonlit night, reminding me of fantastical sketches of fairytale landscapes I had seen. The boat picked up speed, and soon we could make out the gaudy movements of figures on the stage and, on the river near by, the dark awnings of boats of opera-watchers.","Our eyes were drawn to stage standing in a plot of empty ground by the river outside the village, hazy in the distant moonlight, barely distinguishable from its surroundings. It seemed that the fairyland I had seen in pictures had come alive here. The boat was moving faster now, and presently we could make out figures on the stage and a blaze of gaudy colours. The river close to the stage was black with the boat awnings of the spectators."
时候既然是深冬；渐近故乡时，天气又阴晦了，冷风吹进船舱中，呜呜的响，从篷隙向外一望，苍黄的天底下，远近横着几个萧索的荒村，没有一些活气。我的心禁不住悲凉起来了。,"Since it was late winter; when we approached our hometown, the weather turned gloomy again, and the cold wind blew into the cabin, making a whistling sound, and looking out from the gap in the tent, under the pale yellow sky, there were several desolate and deserted villages in the distance. Lively. My heart couldn't help but feel sad.","As I neared my destination the weather grew overcast, the midwinter wind whistling through my cabin. Through a crack in the awning, I could see a bleak scattering of villages beneath a dull yellow sky.","It was late winter. As we drew near my former home the day became overcast and a cold wind blew into the cabin of our boat, while all one could see through the chinks in our bamboo awning were a few desolate villages, void of any sign of life, scattered far and near under the sombre yellow sky. I could not help feeling depressed."
我没有思索的从外套袋里抓出一大把铜元，交给巡警，说，“请你给他……”,"Without thinking, I grabbed a large amount of copper coins from my coat pocket, handed it to the patrolman, and said, ""Please give it to him...""","This one’s out of commission.’ As if without thinking, I pulled a great handful of coins out of my coat pocket. ‘Make sure the driver gets these, will you?’ I asked, thrusting them at the policeman.","On the spur of the moment I pulled a handful of coppers from my coat pocket and handed them to the policeman. “Please give him this,” I said."

很白很亮的一堆洋钱！而且是他的……现在不见了！说是算被儿子拿去了罢，总还是忽忽不乐；说自己是虫豸罢，也还是忽忽不乐：他这回才有些感到失败的苦痛了。,"A very white and bright pile of foreign money! And it's his... now gone! Saying that it was taken by his son, he was still unhappy; saying that he was a worm, but he was still unhappy: this time he felt a little bit of the pain of failure.","That shiny pile of silver dollars!

他又就了坐，眼光格外的闪烁；他目睹着许多东西，然而很模胡，——是倒塌了的糖塔一般的前程躺在他面前，这前程又只是广大起来，阻住了他的一切路。,"He sat down again, his eyes gleaming especially; he saw many things, but it was very vague--a future like a collapsed sugar tower lay before him, and this prospect was only widened and blocked his way. all the way.","He sat down, the same curious glitter to his eyes.

我的一位前辈先生N，正走到我的寓里来谈闲天，一听这话，便很不高兴的对我说：,"One of my seniors, Mr. N, was walking to my apartment to chat, and when he heard this, he said to me very unhappy:","And promptly succeeded in irritating one Mr N, an acquaintance a generation older than me, who happened to have stopped by for a chat.","Mr. N, one of my seniors, had just dropped in for a chat."
“瑜儿，他们都冤枉了你，你还是忘不了，伤心不过，今天特意显点灵，要我知道么？”他四面一看，只见一只乌鸦，站在一株没有叶的树上，便接着说，“我知道了。——瑜儿，可怜他们坑了你，他们将来总有报应，天都知道；你闭了眼睛就是了。——你如果真在这里，听到我的话，——便教这乌鸦飞上你的坟顶，给我看罢。”,"""Yu'er, they have wronged you.

凡事总须研究，才会明白。古来时常吃人，我也还记得，可是不甚清楚。我翻开历史一查，这历史没有年代，歪歪斜斜的每叶上都写着“仁道义德”几个字。我横竖睡不着，仔细看了半夜，才从字缝里看出字来，满本都写着两个字是“吃人”！,"Everything has to be studied before it can be understood. I used to eat people in ancient times, I still remember it, but I don't know it very well. I opened up the history and checked it. This history has no chronology, and the words ""benevolence, morality, righteousness and morality"" are written on each crooked leaf. I couldn't sleep horizontally and vertically. After reading it carefully in the middle of the night, I could see the words from the cracks. The whole book was written with two words ""eat people""!","Only thorough investigation will bring clarity. I seem to remember, though only vaguely, that people have been eating each other since ancient times. When I flick through the history books, I find no dates, only those fine Confucian principles ‘benevolence, righteousness, morality’ snaking their way across each page. As I studied them again, through one of my more implacably sleepless nights, I finally glimpsed what lay between every line, of every book: ‘Eat people!’ All these words – written in books, spoken by the farmer – stare strangely, smirkingly at me.","Everything requires careful consideration if one is to understand it. In ancient times, as I recollect, people often ate human beings, but I am rather hazy about it. I tried to look this up, but my history has no chronology and scrawled all over each page are the words: “Confucian Virtue and Morality.” Since I could not sleep anyway, I read intently half the night until I began to see words between the lines. The whole book was filled with the two words—“Eat people.”"
对于这谜语，陈士成便在平时，本也常常暗地里加以揣测的，可惜大抵刚以为可以通，却又立刻觉得不合了。有一回，他确有把握，知道这是在租给唐家的房底下的了，然而总没有前去发掘的勇气，过了几时，可又觉得太不相像了。至于他自己房子里的几个掘过的旧痕迹，那却全是先前几回下第以后的发了怔忡的举动，后来自己一看到，也还感到惭愧而且羞人。,"Regarding this riddle, Chen Shicheng often speculates secretly in his usual times, but it is a pity that he thought it was possible, but he immediately felt that it was not suitable. Once, he was sure that it was under the house rented to the Tang family, but he didn't have the courage to explore it. After a while, he felt that it was too dissimilar. As for the old traces he had dug up in his own house, they were all hesitant behaviors after several previous times, and when he saw it later, he felt ashamed and embarrassed.","In calmer moments, Chen Shicheng had often secretly pondered its meaning, but whenever he thought he had finally solved it, doubts would begin to gnaw at him. Once, he’d convinced himself that it lay beneath the rooms rented out to the Tangs, but he hadn’t dared ask them to let him dig it up. And soon enough, his sense of certainty had begun to fail. A few scars over the floors of his own rooms recalled earlier attempts to uncover the hoard, shameful testimony to the delirious aftermath of other examination defeats.","Chen Shicheng often quietly cudgelled his brains to guess this riddle. Unfortunately he no sooner hit on a solution than he realized that it was wide of the mark. Once he was sure the treasure was under the room rented to the Tang family, but he lacked the courage to dig there and a little later it struck him as most unlikely. As for the vestiges of earlier excavations in his own room, these were signs of his depression over previous failures in the examination, and the sight of them later shamed and embarrassed him."

这刹那中，他的思想又仿佛旋风似的在脑里一回旋了。四年之前，他曾在山脚下遇见一只饿狼，永是不近不远的跟定他，要吃他的肉。他那时吓得几乎要死，幸而手里有一柄斫柴刀，才得仗这壮了胆，支持到未庄，可是永远记得那狼眼睛，又凶又怯：闪闪的像两颗鬼火，似乎远远的来穿透了他的皮肉。而这回他又看见从来没有见过的更可怕的眼睛了，又钝又锋利，不但已经咀嚼了他的话，并且还要咀嚼他皮肉以外的东西，永是不近不远的跟他走。,"At this moment, his thoughts swirled in his mind like a whirlwind. Four years ago, he had met a hungry wolf at the foot of the mountain, and he would always follow him near and far to eat his meat. He was scared to death at that time, but fortunately he had a hatchet in his hand, so he was brave enough to support Weizhuang, but he will always remember the wolf's eyes, fierce and timid: twinkling like two ghost fires, it seemed It penetrated his flesh from a distance. And this time he saw more terrifying eyes that he had never seen before, blunt and sharp, not only had chewed his words, but also chewed things other than his flesh, and never walked near or far.","His mind swirled again. Four years ago, at the foot of a mountain, he had encountered a hungry wolf that had followed him, at the same dogged distance, all the way back to Weizhuang. Half dead with fear, only the axe he had with him had given him the courage to get back to the village. He had never forgotten the wolf’s eyes, fierce and cowardly, flashing fiendishly, burning into his flesh. But the glazed eyes he was now staring into were more terrifying still: slicing into him, gulping down his words, ravenous for something more than his flesh, following him along at the same distance.","At that instant his thoughts revolved again like a whirlwind. Four years before, at the foot of the mountain, he had met a hungry wolf which had followed him at a set distance, wanting to eat him. He had nearly died of fright, but luckily he happened to have a knife in his hand which gave him the courage to get back to Weizhuang. He had never forgotten that wolf's eyes, fierce yet cowardly, gleaming like two will-o'-the-wisps, as if boring into him from a distance. Now he saw eyes more terrible even than the wolf's: dull yet penetrating eyes that having devoured his words still seemed eager to devour something of him at a set distance."
可惜正月过去了，闰土须回家里去，我急得大哭，他也躲到厨房里，哭着不肯出门，但终于被他父亲带走了。他后来还托他的父亲带给我一包贝壳和几枝很好看的鸟毛，我也曾送他一两次东西，但从此没有再见面。,"It's a pity that the first month has passed, and Run Tuxu went home. I was so anxious that I cried a lot. He also hid in the kitchen, crying and refused to go out, but was finally taken away by his father.

I also gave him something once or twice, but we haven't seen each other since.","All too soon, the first lunar month was at an end, and Runtu had to return home.

“这样的夜间，”他说，“在缅甸是遍地是音乐。房里，草间，树上，都有昆虫吟叫，各种声音，成为合奏，很神奇。其间时时夹着蛇鸣：‘嘶嘶！’可是也与虫声相和协……”他沉思了，似乎想要追想起那时的情景来。,"""In such a night,"" he said, ""in Myanmar, there is music everywhere. In the house, in the grass, and on the trees, there are insects chanting, and various sounds form an ensemble, which is very magical. There are snakes singing:' Hiss!' But also in harmony with the sound of insects..."" He pondered, as if trying to recall the scene at that time.","‘There was music everywhere. In the houses, in the grass, in the trees, a magical symphony of insects. Then there was the hissing of the snakes, harmonizing away…’ He slipped deep into thought, as if trying to lose himself in the memory of it all.","“On a night like this,” he said, “there is music all over Burma. Buildings, grass and trees, all have insects shrilling there. Those different sounds merge into a most extraordinary harmony.

阿Q想：“哼，有趣，这小孤孀不知道闹着什么玩意儿了？”他想打听，走近赵司晨的身边。这时他猛然间看见赵大爷向他奔来，而且手里捏着一支大竹杠。他看见这一支大竹杠，便猛然间悟到自己曾经被打，和这一场热闹似乎有点相关。他翻身便走，想逃回舂米场，不图这支竹杠阻了他的去路，于是他又翻身便走，自然而然的走出后门，不多工夫，已在土谷祠内了。,"Ah Q thought, ""Hmph, it's interesting, this little widow doesn't know what's going on?"" He wanted to inquire, and approached Zhao Sichen. At this moment, he suddenly saw Uncle Zhao running towards him with a big bamboo stick in his hand. When he saw this big bamboo pole, he suddenly realized that he had been beaten, which seemed to be related to this lively scene. He turned over and walked away, wanting to escape back to the rice pounding field. He didn't want this bamboo pole to block his way, so he turned over and walked away, and naturally walked out the back door, without much effort, he was already in the Tugu Temple.","‘Rum,’ Ah-Q thought to himself. ‘ What’s up with her?’ As he sidled over to Zhao Sichen, in the hope of learning more, he became swiftly aware of a rapid approach from Mr Zhao, who was holding a thick bamboo stick of his own. Reminded of the thrashing he had not long ago received from Zhao junior, he deduced that the present lively situation might have something to do with him. Turning to exit back to the husking floor, he found his path blocked by this new stick. Logically enough, he decided to leave by the back door, and soon found himself back inside the Temple of Earth and Grain.","“This is interesting,” thought Ah Q. “What mischief can this little widow be up to?” Wanting to find out, he was approaching Zhao Sichen when suddenly he caught sight of Mr. Zhao's eldest son rushing towards him with, what was worse, the big bamboo pole in his hand. The sight of this big bamboo pole reminded him that he had been beaten by it, and he realized that apparently he was connected in some way all this excitement. He turned and ran, hoping to escape to the hulling-floor, not foreseeing that the bamboo pole would cut off his retreat. When it did, he turned and ran in the other direction, leaving without further ado by the back gate. Soon he was back in the Tutelary God's Temple."

这事阿Q后来才知道。他颇悔自己睡着，但也深怪他们不来招呼他。他又退一步想道：,"Ah Q found out about this later. He regretted falling asleep, but also blamed them for not coming to greet him.

The day before yesterday, the dog of the Zhao family looked at me a few times, and it could be seen that he was also an accomplice and had already approached me. The old man looked at the ground, how could he hide it from me.","Though my corpse would have less fat on it, it would still be a corpse. They can eat only carrion.

I shiver just to think of it. This hyena is cousin to the wolf, the wolf cousin to the dog. The way the Zhaos’ dog looked at me the day before yesterday, he’s in on it, too; and that old man who couldn’t look me in the eye – but he couldn’t fool me either.","They only eat dead flesh! I remember reading somewhere of a hideous beast with an ugly look in its eye called “hyena,” which often eats dead flesh.

宣统三年九月十四日[40]——即阿Q将搭连卖给赵白眼的这一天——三更四点，有一只大乌篷船到了赵府上的河埠头。这船从黑魆魆中荡来，乡下人睡得熟，都没有知道；出去时将近黎明，却很有几个看见的了。据探头探脑的调查来的结果，知道那竟是举人老爷的船！,"On the 14th day of the 14th day of the third month of Xuantong's reign[40]—that is, the day when Ah Q sold the company to Zhao Baiyan—at three and four o'clock, a large awning boat arrived at the quay of the river on Zhao's house. The boat was swung from the darkness, and the countrymen were fast asleep, but they didn't know it; it was almost dawn when they went out, but there were quite a few people who saw it. According to the results of the probe's investigation, we know that it is actually the ship of Master Juren!","On the fourth stroke of the third watch of the night of the fourteenth day of the ninth month of the third year of Emperor Xuantong’s reign* 7 – the day on which Ah-Q sold his purse to Zhao Baiyan – a large boat with a black awning docked at the Zhaos’. It arrived under cover of darkness, unnoticed by the sleeping villagers, though its departure around dawn was widely noted. Persistent inquiry eventually traced its ownership back to none other than Mr Provincial Examination.","On the fourteenth day of the ninth moon of the third year in the reign of Emperor Xuan Tong—the day on which Ah Q sold his purse to Zhao Baiyan—at midnight, after the fourth stroke of the third watch, a large boat with a big black awning arrived at the Zhao family's landing-place. This boat floated up in the darkness while the villagers were sound asleep, so that they knew nothing about it; but it left again about dawn, when quite a number of people saw it. Investigation revealed that this boat actually belonged to the successful provincial candidate!"
和我一同玩的是许多小朋友，因为有了远客，他们也都从父母那里得了减少工作的许可，伴我来游戏。在小村里，一家的客，几乎也就是公共的。我们年纪都相仿，但论起行辈来，却至少是叔子，有几个还是太公，因为他们合村都同姓，是本家。然而我们是朋友，即使偶而吵闹起来，打了太公，一村的老老小小，也决没有一个会想出“犯上”这两个字来，而他们也百分之九十九不识字。,"I played with many children. Because of the distant visitors, they also got permission from their parents to reduce their work, and they came to play with me. In a small village, the guests of a family are almost public. We are all about the same age, but in terms of generations, we are at least uncles, and some are Taigongs, because they share the same surname in the village and belong to the family. However, we are friends. Even if we get into a row every now and then and beat the grandfather, no one in the village will come up with the word ""criminal"", and 99% of them are illiterate.","I had crowds of friends: because I was an exotic visitor from town, the village children were given special leave by their parents from their regular chores to entertain me. When one family had a guest, the entire village took responsibility for him. Though we were all of an age, most of them were born one or even two generations above me, and since everyone in the village shared the same surname, we were all of the same, loose clan. But for the most part, we got on famously: even if, in our occasional arguments, I ended up taking a swipe at a distant great-great-uncle, no one accused me of disrespect for my elders. Most of the children – ninety-nine per cent of them, I would estimate – were illiterate.","There were many children for me to play with. For with the arrival of a visitor from such a distance they got leave from their parents to do less work in order to play with me. In a small village, the guest of one family is virtually the guest of the whole community. We were all about the same age, but when it came to determining seniority many were at least my uncles or granduncles, since everybody in the village had the same family name and belonged to one clan. But we were all good friends, and if by some chance we fell out and I hit one of my granduncles, it never occurred to any child or grown-up in the village to call me “insubordinate.” Ninety-nine out of a hundred of them could neither read nor write."

他在路上走着要“求食”，看见熟识的酒店，看见熟识的馒头，但他都走过了，不但没有暂停，而且并不想要。他所求的不是这类东西了；他求的是什么东西，他自己不知道。,"He was walking on the road to ""beg for food"". He saw a familiar hotel and a familiar steamed bun, but he passed them all. Not only did he not pause, but he didn't want it. He was not asking for such things; what he was asking for, he did not know.","He decided to go out in search of sustenance. He walked past familiar sights – the tavern, trays of steamed rolls – without pausing, without registering a twinge of desire for either. He was searching for something else; though what that something was, he couldn’t say.","Then he made up his mind to go out in search of food. As he walked along the road “in search of food” he saw the familiar tavern and the familiar steamed bread, but he passed them by without pausing for a second, without even hankering after them. It was not these he was looking for, although what exactly he was looking for he did not know himself."
车子不住的前行，阿Q在喝采声中，轮转眼睛去看吴妈，似乎伊一向并没有见他，却只是出神的看着兵们背上的洋炮。,"The car kept moving forward. Ah Q, amid the applause, turned his eyes to look at Wu Ma. It seemed that Yi had never seen him, but just stared at the foreign cannons on the backs of the soldiers.","The cart rumbled on. Amid the cheers, Ah-Q turned his eyes in the direction of Mrs Wu, but she seemed too transfixed by the guns on the soldiers’ shoulders to notice him.","The car moved steadily forward. During the shouting Ah Q's eyes turned in search of Amah Wu, but she did not seem to have seen him for she was looking intently at the foreign rifles carried by the soldiers."
我想：我同赵贵翁有什么仇，同路上的人又有什么仇；只有廿年以前，把古久先生的陈年流水簿子[2]，踹了一脚，古久先生很不高兴。赵贵翁虽然不认识他，一定也听到风声，代抱不平；约定路上的人，同我作冤对。但是小孩子呢？那时候，他们还没有出世，何以今天也睁着怪眼睛，似乎怕我，似乎想害我。这真教我怕，教我纳罕而且伤心。,"I thought: What kind of hatred do I have with Zhao Guiweng, and what kind of hatred do I have with the people on the road? Only twenty years ago, Mr. Gu Jiu's old water book[2] was kicked, and Mr. Gu Jiu was very unhappy. Although Zhao Guiweng didn't know him, he must have heard the rumors and held the injustice on his behalf; he promised that the people on the road would be wrong with me. But what about children? At that time, they had not yet been born, so why are they opening their strange eyes today, as if they were afraid of me, as if they wanted to harm me. It really taught me to be afraid, it taught me to be worried and sad.","Mr Zhao, all the others I saw that morning – what was the source of their hatred? All I could think of was that twenty years ago, I stamped on the Records of the Past, and it has been my enemy since. Though he has no personal acquaintance with this Past, Mr Zhao must have somehow got wind of the business, and resolved to take up the grudge himself. He must have rallied everyone else I saw against me. But what about the children? They weren’t even born twenty years ago – so why do they stare so strangely at me, as if they fear me, or wish me harm? I am hurt, bewildered, afraid.","I wonder what grudge Mr. Zhao has against me, what grudge the people on the road have against me. I can think of nothing except that twenty years ago I trod on Mr. Gu Jiu's old ledgers, and Mr. Gu was most displeased. Although Mr. Zhao does not know him, he must have heard talk of this and decided to avenge him, thus he is conspiring against me with the people on the road. But then what of the children? At that time they were not yet born, so why should they eye me so strangely today, as if they were afraid of me, as if they wanted to murder me? This really frightens me; it is so bewildering and upsetting."
阿Q仿佛文童落第似的觉得很冤屈，他慢慢走近园门去，忽而非常惊喜了，这分明是一畦老萝卜。他于是蹲下便拔，而门口突然伸出一个很圆的头来，又即缩回去了，这分明是小尼姑。小尼姑之流是阿Q本来视若草芥的，但世事须“退一步想”，所以他便赶紧拔起四个萝卜，拧下青叶，兜在大襟里。然而老尼姑已经出来了。,"Ah Q felt very wronged as if a child of Wen had fallen to the ground. He slowly approached the gate of the garden, and was suddenly very pleasantly surprised. This was clearly an old carrot. He then squatted down and pulled it out, and suddenly a very round head protruded from the door, and then retracted again, which was clearly a little nun. Ah Q originally regarded the little nuns and his like as a matter of course, but the world had to ""take a step back and think about it"", so he quickly pulled up four radishes, unscrewed the green leaves, and tucked them in his big placket. But the old nun has come out.","Ah-Q prowled up to the garden gate, feeling a keen sense of the injustice of it all. There, however, a joyful surprise awaited him: a bed of elderly turnips. He squatted down and tugged at them. A round head suddenly popped up at the gate, then shrank back again: Ah-Q’s old enemy, the young nun. Even though Ah-Q had always been scrupulous never to have the slightest respect for people such as young nuns, discretion sometimes turns out to be the better part of valour and so, after uprooting four turnips as fast as he could, he twisted off their green outer leaves, and tucked them into his jacket, just in time to greet an old nun. ‘By the Buddha!","Resentful as a scholar who has failed the examinations Ah Q walked slowly towards the gate of the garden. Suddenly, however, he gave a start of joy, for what did he see there but a patch of turnips! He knelt down and had just begun pulling when a round head appeared from behind the gate, only to be promptly withdrawn. This was no other than the little nun. Now though Ah Q had always had the greatest contempt for such people as little nuns, there are times when “Discretion is the better part of valour.” He hastily pulled up four turnips, tore off the leaves, and stuffed them under his jacket. By this time an old nun had already come out."
掌柜回来的时候，帮忙的人早吃过饭；因为鲁镇还有些古风，所以不上一更，便都回家睡觉了。只有阿五还靠着咸亨的柜台喝酒，老拱也呜呜的唱。,"When the shopkeeper came back, the people who helped had already eaten; because Luzhen was still a little old-fashioned, so they all went home and went to sleep before the last update. Only Ah Wu still leaned against Xianheng's counter to drink, and Lao Gong also sang.","By seven o’clock, the hired help had finished their dinner and – Luzhen being an old-fashioned kind of a place – taken themselves off to bed, leaving only the usual hardcore of Ah-wu drinking at the bar, with Gong wailing his songs.","By the time the landlord came back the other helpers had finished their meal. And Luchen being rather old-fashioned, they all went home to sleep before the first watch. Only Ah-wu leaned on the bar of Prosperity Tavern drinking, while Old Kong croaked a song."
我这时很兴奋，但不知道怎么说才好，只是说：,"I was so excited, but didn't know what to say, just said:","Though I was delighted to see him, I could think of nothing to say.","Delighted as I was, I did not know how to express myself, and could only say:"

但真所谓“塞翁失马安知非福”[20]罢，阿Q不幸而赢了一回，他倒几乎失败了。,"But it is true that the so-called ""Weng loses the horse and knows it is not a blessing.""[20] Ah Q was unfortunate and won once, but he almost lost.","But every silver lining has its cloud, to paraphrase the proverb, and the one time that Ah-Q was unfortunate enough to win, he lost almost everything.","However, the truth of the proverb “Misfortune may prove a blessing in disguise” was shown when Ah Q was unfortunate enough to win and almost suffered defeat in the end."
“赵……赵家遭抢了！”小D气喘吁吁的说。,"""Zhao... Zhao's family was robbed!"" Little D said panting.",‘There’s… there’s been a robbery at the Zhaos’!’ D panted out.,"“The Zhao... Zhao family has been robbed,” panted Young D."

现在的七斤，是七斤嫂和村人又都早给他相当的尊敬，相当的待遇了。到夏天，他们仍旧在自家门口的土场上吃饭；大家见了，都笑嘻嘻的招呼。九斤老太早已做过八十大寿，仍然不平而且康健。六斤的双丫角，已经变成一支大辫子了；伊虽然新近裹脚，却还能帮同七斤嫂做事，捧着十八个铜钉[4]的饭碗，在土场上一瘸一拐的往来。,"Now Qijin, sister-in-law Qijin and the villagers have given him considerable respect and treatment. In the summer, they still eat on the dirt field in front of their house; when everyone sees it, they greet each other with a smile. The nine-jin old lady has already had her 80th birthday, and she is still uneven and healthy. The 6-jin double horns have become a big braid; although Yi has recently bound his feet, he can still help the same seven-jin sister-in-law, holding a rice bowl with 18 copper nails[4], and lame on the soil field A crooked relationship.","And so Seven-Pounds again enjoys the deferential regard of his wife and fellow villagers. Every summer, they dine out on the mudflat outside their door, graciously acknowledging their neighbours’ smiles and greetings. Now well past her eightieth birthday, old Mrs Nine-Pounds enjoys the same healthy ill-temper as always, while Six-Pounds’s two wiry little braids have merged into a larger, single plait. And even though her feet have now been bound, she still helps Mrs Seven-Pounds with the chores, hobbling back and forth across the mudbank, carrying her rice bowl with its sixteen copper nails.","Today Sevenpounder is once more respected and well treated by his wife and the villagers. In the summer his family still have their meals on the mud flat outside their door, and everyone greets them with smiles. Old Mrs. Ninepounder celebrated her eightieth birthday some time ago and is as full of complaints, as hale and hearty as ever. Sixpounder's twin tufts of hair have changed into a thick braid. Although recently they started binding her feet, she can still help Mrs. Sevenpounder with odd jobs. She hobbles to and fro on the mud flat carrying the rice bowl with sixteen copper rivets."
我可不怕，仍旧走我的路。前面一伙小孩子，也在那里议论我；眼色也同赵贵翁一样，脸色也都铁青。我想我同小孩子有什么仇，他也这样。忍不住大声说，“你告诉我！”他们可就跑了。,"I'm not afraid, I still go my way. The group of children in front were also talking about me there; their eyes were the same as Zhao Guiweng's, and their faces were blue. I don't think I have any grudge against the child, and so does he. Can't help but shout, ""You tell me!"" and they run away.","Refusing to be intimidated, I carried on my way. A gang of children blocked my path ahead – they, too, were discussing me, their eyes as strange as Mr Zhao’s, their faces a ghastly white. What quarrel could these children have with me, I wondered. ‘Tell me!’ I shouted, unable to stop myself. But they just ran away.","I was not afraid, however, but continued on my way. A group of children in front were also discussing me, and the look in their eyes was just like that in Mr. Zhao's while their faces too were ghastly pale. I wondered what grudge these children could have against me to make them behave like this. I could not help calling out, “Tell me!” But then they ran away."
那火接近了，果然是渔火；我才记得先前望见的也不是赵庄。那是正对船头的一丛松柏林，我去年也曾经去游玩过，还看见破的石马倒在地下，一个石羊蹲在草里呢。过了那林，船便弯进了叉港，于是赵庄便真在眼前了。,"The fire approached, and it was indeed a fishing fire; I remembered that it was not Zhao Zhuang that I saw earlier. It was a clump of pine trees facing the bow of the boat. I also went to play last year. I also saw a broken stone horse lying on the ground and a stone sheep squatting in the grass. After passing the forest, the boat bent into the fork port, so Zhao Zhuang was really in front of him.","The torches, we discovered as they drew closer, belonged to fishing boats. And now I realized that what lay before me was not yet Zhaozhuang – directly opposite the stern was a copse of pines I’d visited last year, a broken stone horse collapsed on the ground, a stone sheep crouching in the grass. Past this wood, the boat drew into an inlet and Zhaozhuang truly lay before us.","As we approached the lights, they proved to be fishermen's lights and I realized it was not Zhaozhuang that I had been looking at. Directly ahead of us was a pine-wood where I had played the year before and seen a broken stone horse, fallen on its side, as well as a stone sheep couched in the grass. Once past the wood, our boat rounded a bend into a cove, and Zhaozhuang was really before us."
自此以后，又长久没有看见孔乙己。到了年关，掌柜取下粉板说，“孔乙己还欠十九个钱呢！”到第二年的端午，又说“孔乙己还欠十九个钱呢！”到中秋可是没有说，再到年关也没有看见他。,"Since then, Kong Yiji has not been seen for a long time. At the end of the year, the shopkeeper took off the powder board and said, ""Kong Yiji still owes nineteen dollars!"" On the Dragon Boat Festival of the second year, he said, ""Kong Yiji still owes nineteen dollars!"" I didn't see him until the end of the year.","After this, we were again bereft of Kong Yiji for an extended period of time. ‘ Kong Yiji still owes me those nineteen coppers!’ the manager said, as the year neared its end, taking the slate down again. ‘Kong Yiji still owes me nineteen coppers!’ he repeated at the Dragon Boat Festival, in early summer the following year. At the Mid-Autumn Festival, he said nothing more about it; nor at the end of the year.","A long time went by after that without our seeing Kong Yiji again. At the end of the year, when the boss took down the tally-board he said, “Kong Yiji still owes nineteen coppers.” At the Dragon-Boat Festival the next year he said the same thing again. But when the Mid-Autumn Festival arrived he was silent on the subject, and another New Year came round without our seeing any more of Kong Yiji."
阿Q听到了很羡慕。他虽然早知道秀才盘辫的大新闻，但总没有想到自己可以照样做，现在看见赵司晨也如此，才有了学样的意思，定下实行的决心。他用一支竹筷将辫子盘在头顶上，迟疑多时，这才放胆的走去。,"Ah Q was very envious when he heard this. Although he knew about the big news of the Xiu Cai braid, he never thought that he could do the same. Now that he sees Zhao Sichen doing the same, he has the intention to follow the example and is determined to implement it. He used a bamboo chopstick to put the braid on top of his head, hesitated for a long time, and then walked boldly.","exclaimed everyone who saw Zhao Sichen approach, the nape of his neck naked as the day he was born. Ah-Q raged with envy. Although the village genius’s decision to wind his queue round the top of his head was old news, it hadn’t occurred to him that he could copy him. Now, seeing Zhao Sichen doing the same, he realized that he, too, could follow suit, and resolved to do so. After tucking it up and securing it with a bamboo chopstick, and a further period of hesitation, he boldly set forth into the public domain.","When Ah Q heard this he was greatly impressed. Although he had long since heard how the successful county candidate had coiled his queue on his head, it had never occurred to him to do the same. Only now when he saw that Zhao Sichen had followed suit was he struck with the idea of doing the same himself. He made up his mind to copy them. He used a bamboo chopstick to twist his queue up on his head, and after some hesitation eventually summoned up the courage to go out."
太阳收尽了他最末的光线了，水面暗暗地回复过凉气来；土场上一片碗筷声响，人人的脊梁上又都吐出汗粒。七斤嫂吃完三碗饭，偶然抬起头，心坎里便禁不住突突地发跳。伊透过乌桕叶，看见又矮又胖的赵七爷正从独木桥上走来，而且穿着宝蓝色竹布的长衫。,"The sun had exhausted his last rays, and the water surface secretly returned to the cool air; the sound of tableware and chopsticks on the soil field, and everyone spit out sweat on their spines. Sister Qijin finished eating three bowls of rice, and occasionally raised her head, her heart could not help beating suddenly. Through the tallow leaves, Yi saw the short and fat Zhao Qiye walking from the single-plank bridge, and wearing a long gown of sapphire blue bamboo cloth.","The sun gathered up the last of its rays, the surface of the river stealthily greeting their departure with fresh, cool air. All along the mudbank, spines beaded with sweat as chopsticks clattered on bowls. Looking up after her third bowl of rice, Mrs Seven-Pounds’s heart began to pound violently. Through a screen of tallow leaves, she spotted the squat form of Mr Zhao, draped in a long gown of sapphire-blue glazed cotton, picking his way across a single-log bridge and towards them.","The sun had withdrawn its last rays, the darkling water was cooling off again. From the mud flat rose a clatter of bowls and chopsticks, and the backs of all the diners were beaded with sweat. Mrs. Sevenpounder had finished three bowls of rice when she happened to look up.

这件事很使我悲哀，至今还时时记得哩。我在留学的时候，曾经看见日报上登载一个游历南洋和中国的本多博士[8]的事；这位博士是不懂中国和马来语的，人问他，你不懂话，怎么走路呢？他拿起手杖来说，这便是他们的话，他们都懂！我因此气愤了好几天，谁知道我竟不知不觉的自己也做了，而且那些人都懂了。……,"This incident made me sad, and I still remember it from time to time. When I was studying abroad, I once saw an article in the daily newspaper about a Dr. Ponto[8] who traveled to Nanyang and China. The doctor did not understand Chinese and Malay. People asked him, how do you walk if you don’t know how to speak? Woolen cloth? He picked up his cane and said, these are their words, they all understand! I was angry for several days because of this, who knew that I did it myself without knowing it, and those people understood. ...","‘But the whole thing made me miserable – still does, when I think back over it.

The whole thing put me in a fury for days – and then, years later, here I was speaking the same Esperanto. And being understood.","“To this day, I keep remembering how wretched this made me. While studying in Japan, I read in some Japanese paper an account of Dr. Honda's travels in the South Seas and China.

What is it?""","‘What a stroke of luck. Soon he’ll be right as rain; no wonder old Shuan can’t keep the smile off his face,’ the grey-beard echoed, approaching Mr Kang. ‘I heard it was the Xia boy – is that right?’ he lowered his voice deferentially.","“So you've had such a stroke of luck for your Little Shuan! Of course his sickness will be cured completely. No wonder Old Shuan keeps smiling.” As he spoke, the greybeard walked up to the man in brown, and lowered his voice to ask: “Mr. Kang, I heard the criminal executed today came from the Xia family. Who was it?"

鲁镇的酒店的格局，是和别处不同的：都是当街一个曲尺形的大柜台，柜里面预备着热水，可以随时烫酒。做工的人，傍午傍晚散了工，每每花四文铜钱，买一碗酒，——这是二十多年前的事，现在每碗要涨到十文，——靠柜外站着，热热的喝了休息；倘肯多花一文，便可以买一碟盐煮笋，或者茴香豆，做下酒物了，如果出到十几文，那就能买一样荤菜，但这些顾客，多是短衣帮，大抵没有这样阔绰。只有穿长衫的，才踱进店面隔壁的房子里，要酒要菜，慢慢地坐喝。,"The layout of the hotels in Lu Town is different from other places: they are all on the street with a large curved counter, and hot water is prepared in the cabinet, which can be used to scald wine at any time. Workers, who leave work in the afternoon and evening, usually spend four cents of copper to buy a bowl of wine—this happened more than 20 years ago, and now each bowl has risen to ten cents—standing outside the cabinet , drink hot and rest; if you are willing to spend an extra penny, you can buy a plate of boiled bamboo shoots with salt, or fennel beans, as a drink, and if you spend more than a dozen penny, you can buy a meat dish, but these customers , mostly short-clothed gang, probably not so rich. Only those in long gowns walked into the house next to the store, asked for wine and food, and sat and drank slowly.","The taverns in Luzhen were rather particular in their layout. Facing out to the street was a substantial bar, squared off at the corners, behind which hot water was always at the ready for warming up wine. Lunchtime or evening, when they got off work, the town’s labourers would drift in, each with their four coppers ready to buy a bowl of warmed wine (this was twenty years ago, remember; now it would cost them ten), then drink it at the bar, taking their ease. An extra copper would buy them a bowl of salted bamboo shoots, or of aniseed beans, to go with it. If their budgets stretched to ten coppers or more, a meat dish would be within their reach. But such extravagance was generally beyond the means of short-jacketed manual labourers. Only those dressed in the long scholar’s gowns that distinguished those who worked with their heads from those who worked with their hands made for a more sedate, inner room, to enjoy their wine and food sitting down.","The layout of Luzhen's taverns is unique. In each, facing you as you enter, is a bar in the shape of a carpenter's square where hot water is kept ready for warming rice wine. When men come off work at midday and in the evening they spend four coppers on a bowl of wine—or so they did twenty years ago; now it costs ten—and drink this warm, standing by the bar, taking it easy. Another copper will buy a plate of salted bamboo shoots or peas flavoured with aniseed to go with the wine, while a dozen will buy a meat dish; but most of the customers here belong to the short-coated class, few of whom can afford this. As for those in long gowns, they go into the inner room to order wine and dishes and sit drinking at their leisure."
又过了九日，是我们启程的日期。闰土早晨便到了，水生没有同来，却只带着一个五岁的女儿管船只。我们终日很忙碌，再没有谈天的工夫。来客也不少，有送行的，有拿东西的，有送行兼拿东西的。待到傍晚我们上船的时候，这老屋里的所有破旧大小粗细东西，已经一扫而空了。,"After another nine days, it was our departure date. Runtu arrived in the morning, and Shuisheng did not come with him, but only took a five-year-old daughter to manage the boat. We are very busy all day long and have no time to talk. There are also many visitors, some who see off, some who take things, and some who see off and take things. By the time we got on the boat in the evening, all the dilapidated things in the old house had been swept away.","We set off nine days later. Runtu arrived early that morning, without Shuisheng but bringing with him this time a five-year-old daughter to keep an eye on the boat. There was no time to talk, what with the business of moving and a constant crowd of visitors – some come to say goodbye, some to take things away, some to do both. By the time we stepped on board that evening, the old house had been swept clean of its contents. Everything – regardless of its age, size, state of repair or desirability – was gone.","After another nine days it was time for us to leave. Runtu came in the morning. Shuisheng had not come with him—he had just brought a little girl of five to watch the boat. We were very busy all day, and had no time to talk. We also had quite a number of visitors, some to see us off, some to fetch things, and some to do both. It was nearly evening when we got on the boat, and by that time everything in the house, however old or shabby, large or small, fine or coarse, had been cleared away."

阿Q飘飘然的飞了一通，回到土谷祠，酒已经醒透了。这晚上，管祠的老头子也意外的和气，请他喝茶；阿Q便向他要了两个饼，吃完之后，又要了一支点过的四两烛和一个树烛台，点起来，独自躺在自己的小屋里。他说不出的新鲜而且高兴，烛火像元夜似的闪闪的跳，他的思想也迸跳起来了：——,"Ah Q took a flight and returned to the Tugu Temple, fully sobered up from the wine. That night, the old man in Guanci was also surprisingly kind and invited him to drink tea; Ah Q asked him for two cakes. Lying alone in his hut. He was indescribably fresh and happy, and the candles flickered like the Yuan Ye, and his thoughts jumped:--","By the time Ah-Q had floated complacently back to the Temple of Earth and Grain, the effect of the wine had worn off. The temple’s old caretaker was abnormally polite to him that evening, inviting him in for a cup of tea. Taking the opportunity to cadge two pancakes off him, Ah-Q ate them and asked for a candlestick and a four-ounce candle, which he lit, then lay down alone in his own small room. As he wallowed in the joyous novelty of it all, the flame flashing and leaping as euphorically as the lights at New Year, his thoughts took flight.","For a while Ah Q walked up on air, but by the time he reached the Tutelary God's Temple he had come down to earth again. That evening the old man in charge of the temple was also unexpectedly friendly and offered him tea. Then Ah Q asked him for two flat cakes, and after eating these damanded a four-ounce candle that had been lighted once and a candlestick. He lit the candle and lay down alone in his little room feeling inexpressibly refreshed and happy, while the candlelight leaped and flickered as if this were the Lantern Festival and his imagination soared with it."
阿Q轻轻的走近了，站在赵白眼的背后，心里想招呼，却不知道怎样说才好：叫他假洋鬼子固然是不行的了，洋人也不妥，革命党也不妥，或者就应该叫洋先生了罢。,"Ah Q approached gently, standing behind Zhao Baiyan, wanting to say hello, but he didn't know how to say it: Of course, calling him a fake foreign devil is not acceptable, neither is it appropriate for foreigners, nor is it appropriate for the revolutionary party, or It should be called Mr. Yang.","Fake Foreign Devil didn’t quite sound right any more; but neither did he think Foreigner or Revolutionary would do. Mr Foreigner, perhaps?","Ah Q tiptoed inside and stood behind Zhao Baiyan, eager to pronounce some greeting, but not knowing what to say. Obviously he could not call the man “Bogus Foreign Devil, ” and neither “Foreigner” nor “Revolutionary” seemed quite the thing."
“革命了……你知道？……”阿Q说得很含胡。,"""It's a revolution...you know?..."" Ah Q said in a nonsense way.","‘Have you heard? There’s a revolution…’ Ah-Q observed, rather vaguely.",“There's a revolution... didn't you know?” said Ah Q vaguely.
我从乡下跑到京城里，一转眼已经六年了。其间耳闻目睹的所谓国家大事，算起来也很不少；但在我心里，都不留什么痕迹，倘要我寻出这些事的影响来说，便只是增长了我的坏脾气，——老实说，便是教我一天比一天的看不起人。,"It has been six years since I ran from the countryside to the capital. The so-called national events that I have heard and witnessed during this period are quite a lot; but they do not leave any traces in my heart, and if I were to find out the influence of these events, it would only increase my bad temper, - honestly Said, is to teach me to look down on people day by day.","Six years of my life have slipped by since I arrived in Beijing from the countryside. In that time, I’ve come to see and hear a good deal of what might be termed matters of national importance, yet none has made much impact on me. If you were to force me to declare their influence, I would suggest they succeeded only in further blackening my already black mood – in increasing my contempt for the people around me.","Six years have slipped by since I came from the country to the capital. During that time the number of so-called affairs of state I have witnessed or heard about is far from small, but none of them made much impression. If asked to define their influence on me, I can only say they taught me to take a poorer view of people every day."
“皇恩大赦？——大赦是慢慢的总要大赦罢。”七爷说到这里，声色忽然严厉起来，“但是你家七斤的辫子呢，辫子？这倒是要紧的事。你们知道，长毛时候，留发不留头，留头不留发，……”,"""Amnesty from the emperor? - The amnesty is a gradual amnesty."" When the seventh master said this, his expression suddenly became severe, ""But what about your seven jins of braids, braids? This is the most important thing. You know, When you have long hair, keep your hair but not your head, keep your head but not your hair,…”","So when will we hear about the amnesty?’ ‘All in due course, all in due course.’ A new note of severity entered Mr Zhao’s voice. ‘But where, might I ask, is your queue, Mr Seven-Pounds? This is no laughing matter. Remember the Taiping Rebellion! If you kept your hair, you lost your head; lose your hair, and the head stayed on…’2","“Now that there's an emperor on the throne, when will there be a general amnesty?” She asked. “A general amnesty?... All in good time.” Suddenly Seventh Master spoke more sternly, “ But what about Sevenpounder's queue, eh? That's the important thing.

“你说就是，”他赶紧回过脸来，点点头。,"""You said so,"" he quickly turned around and nodded.","He spun round to face me, nodding.","He turned quickly towards me, nodding."
我似乎打了一个寒噤；我就知道，我们之间已经隔了一层可悲的厚障壁了。我也说不出话。,I seemed to shudder; I knew there was a sadly thick barrier between us.

他现在知道他的宝儿确乎死了；不愿意见这屋子，吹熄了灯，躺着。他一面哭，一面想：想那时候，自己纺着棉纱，宝儿坐在身边吃茴香豆，瞪着一双小黑眼睛想了一刻，便说，“妈！爹卖馄饨，我大了也卖馄饨，卖许多许多钱，——我都给你。”那时候，真是连纺出的棉纱，也仿佛寸寸都有意思，寸寸都活着。但现在怎么了？现在的事，单四嫂子却实在没有想到什么。——我早经说过：他是粗笨女人。他能想出什么呢，他单觉得这屋子太静，太大，太空罢了。,"He knew now that his baby was indeed dead; not wanting to see the house, he blew out the light and lay down. As he cried, he thought: back then, when he was spinning cotton yarn, Bo'er sat beside him eating fennel beans, stared at a pair of small black eyes and thought for a moment, then said, ""Mom! Dad sells wontons, and I also sell them when I'm older. Wontons are sold for a lot of money—I will give them to you.” At that time, even the spun cotton yarn seemed to be interesting and alive. But what happened now? What happened now, sister-in-law Shan Si really didn't think of anything. —I have said it before: he is a clumsy woman. What could he come up with, he just thought the room was too quiet, too big, too empty.","Bao’er, she now realized, was dead. She blew out the lamp and lay down; she no longer wanted this room before her. She thought, as she wept: she thought about how Bao’er had sat next to her while she spun, eating aniseed beans, his eyes wide open, thinking things through. ‘ Daddy used to sell dumplings, didn’t he?’ he had said. ‘So when I get bigger I’ll sell dumplings too. I’ll make lots of money and give it all to you.’ At that moment, every inch of cotton she was spinning had seemed almost alive with meaning. But now? Mrs Shan hadn’t even begun to think about what would happen now. She was a simple, uneducated sort of a woman – as I may have already mentioned. What could she think about? Only that this room of hers was too quiet, too big, too empty.","She knew now her Pao-erh was really dead; and, nor wanting to see this room, she blew out the light and lay down to cry and think. She remembered how Pao-erh had sat by her side when she spun, eating peas flavoured with aniseed. He had watched her intently with his small black eyes and thought. ""Ma!"" he suddenly said. ""Dad sold hun tun.3 When I'm big I'll sell hun tun too, and make lots and lots of money—and I'll give it all to you."" At such times even every inch of yarn she spun seemed worthwhile and alive. But what now? Fourth Shan's Wife had not considered the present at all—as I have said, she was only a simple woman. What solution could she think of? All she knew was that this room was too silent, too large, too empty."
他第二次进了栅栏，倒也并不十分懊恼。他以为人生天地之间，大约本来有时要抓进抓出，有时要在纸上画圆圈的，惟有圈而不圆，却是他“行状”上的一个污点。但不多时也就释然了，他想：孙子才画得很圆的圆圈呢。于是他睡着了。,"The second time he entered the fence, he was not terribly upset. He thought that between the heavens and the earth in life, sometimes he had to grab in and out, and sometimes he had to draw circles on paper, but the circles were not circles, but it was a stain on his ""line"". But after a while, he was relieved, he thought: grandson only draws very round circles. So he fell asleep.","He did not, in truth, feel too badly about things, this second time. In the rich tapestry that is life, he considered, a man is destined sometimes to be hauled out of places, at others to be shoved in, at others again to draw circles on paper. The only blot on his copybook was his failure to make his circle round. Soon enough, however, his heart was easy once more: only idiots can draw perfect circles, he thought. At which he fell asleep.","By now he felt not too upset. He supposed that in this world it was fate of everybody at some time to be dragged in and out of prison and to have to draw circles on paper; it was only his circle not being round that he felt a blot on his escutcheon. Presently. However, he regained composure by thinking, “Only idiots can make perfect circles.” And with his thought he fell asleep."

大竹杠又向他劈下来了。阿Q两手去抱头，拍的正打在指节上，这可很有一些痛。他冲出厨房门，仿佛背上又着了一下似的。,"The big bamboo pole slashed at him again. Ah Q put his hands on his head and hit his knuckles with both hands, which was very painful. He rushed out of the kitchen door as if he had been slapped again on his back.","Down came the bamboo again.

Just go to a place where you haven't beaten or scold.","When I couldn’t stand it any longer, I added a walking stick to the ensemble.

一切都明白了，三太太先前的预料果不错。伊为预防危险起见，便将七个小的都装在木箱中，搬进自己的房里，又将大的也捺进箱里面，勒令伊去哺乳。,"Everything is understood, the third wife's previous expectations turned out well. In order to prevent danger, Yi packed the seven little ones in a wooden box, moved them into his own room, and put the big ones into the box, and ordered Yi to breastfeed.","The mystery had been cleared up, and my sister-in-law’s original hypothesis proved correct. This time, to guard against further fatalities, she placed the seven tiny rabbits in the wooden hutch, moved it into her own room, then put the mother rabbit in, too, so she’d have no choice but to feed them.","All became clear.

但文豪的话有些不合事实，就因为他们没有听到九斤老太的话。这时候，九斤老太正在大怒，拿破芭蕉扇敲着凳脚说：,"But Wenhao's words were a little untrue, because they didn't hear the old lady Jiujin's words. At this time, the old lady Jiujin was furious, knocked on the foot of the stool with a broken banana fan and said:",What a pastoral idyll!’ gushed a pleasure-boatful of amateur poets and professional drinkers as it sailed past.,"they exclaimed. “How idyllic!” However, these literati were wide of the mark, not having heard what Old Mrs. Ninepounder was saying.

待到四处蛙鸣的时候，小鸭也已经长成，两个白的，两个花的，而且不复咻咻的叫，都是“鸭鸭”的叫了。荷花池也早已容不下他们盘桓了，幸而仲密的住家的地势是很低的，夏雨一降，院子里满积了水，他们便欣欣然，游水，钻水，拍翅子，“鸭鸭”的叫。,"By the time the frogs croaked everywhere, the ducklings had grown into two white ones and two flowered ones, and they no longer croaked, they were all ""duck-duck"" calls. The lotus pond has long been unable to accommodate them. Fortunately, the terrain of Zhongmi's house is very low. When the summer rain falls, the yard is full of water, and they are happy to swim, drill, and flap their wings. ""Duck Duck"" cry.","By the time the frogs began their summer chorus, the ducklings were fully grown up – two white, two piebald – and their chirps had deepened into quacks.

And there they spent the summer – splashing, bobbing, flapping, quacking – as happy as could be.","By the time frogs were croaking all around, the ducklings had grown into ducks, two white, two speckled, and they no longer cheeped but had started quacking.

中国的男人，本来大半都可以做圣贤，可惜全被女人毁掉了。商是妲己[29]闹亡的；周是褒姒弄坏的；秦……虽然史无明文，我们也假定他因为女人，大约未必十分错，而董卓可是的确给貂蝉害死了。,"Most of the men in China could have been saints, but unfortunately they were all ruined by women. Shang was killed by Daji[29]; Zhou was destroyed by Bao Si; Qin...Although there is no clear history, we can assume that he may not be very wrong because of a woman, and Dong Zhuo did kill Diaochan.","The great majority of Chinese men in history would have become saints and sages had they not been ruined by women first. Just look at the Shang dynasty – destroyed by the licentious concubine Da Ji; while Bao Si performed the same service for the Zhou. The Qin dynasty, now… well, the sources aren’t entirely unequivocal on this, but were we to surmise there was a woman involved somewhere, we probably wouldn’t be wandering too far from the truth. Moving swiftly on to attested fact and the Later Han,6 it was of course yet another concubine, Diao Chan, who led Dong Zhuo to his death.","The majority of Chinese men could become saints and sages, were it not for the unfortunate fact that they are ruined by women.

And it is a fact that Dong Zhuo's death was caused by Diao Chan."
许多长衫和短衫人物，忽然给他穿上一件洋布的白背心，上面有些黑字。阿Q很气苦：因为这很像是带孝，而带孝是晦气的。然而同时他的两手反缚了，同时又被一直抓出衙门外去了。,"Many figures in long shirts and short shirts suddenly put on a white vest of foreign cloth with some black characters on it. Ah Q is very angry: because it is very similar to filial piety, and filial piety is unlucky. However, at the same time his hands were tied back, and at the same time he was always caught out of the yamen.","A crowd of men variously clad in long and short gowns now dressed him in a waistcoat of white calico, inscribed with a number of black characters. This, Ah-Q found sorely troubling: because white was the colour of mourning, and mourning was a deeply inauspicious activity to find yourself engaged upon. At the same time, both his hands were tied behind his back and he was hauled outside the yamen.","A number of men in long coats and short jackets put on him a white vest of foreign cloth with some black characters on it.

How will we manage without him…’","muttered Mrs. Sevenpounder, standing up. “Such a big family, old and young, and all dependent on him....”"
他只是摇头；脸上虽然刻着许多皱纹，却全然不动，仿佛石像一般。他大约只是觉得苦，却又形容不出，沉默了片时，便拿起烟管来默默的吸烟了。,"He just shook his head; although his face was wrinkled with many wrinkles, he was completely motionless, like a stone statue. He probably just felt bitter, but he couldn't describe it. After being silent for a while, he picked up the pipe and smoked silently.","He went on shaking his head. None of his wrinkles ever moved – as if they were written on stone. He picked up his pipe and fell silently to smoking, perhaps overwhelmed by thoughts of his troubles.","He kept shaking his head; yet, although his face was lined with wrinkles, not one of them moved, just as if he were a stone statue.

阿Q“先前阔”，见识高，而且“真能做”，本来几乎是一个“完人”了，但可惜他体质上还有一些缺点。最恼人的是在他头皮上，颇有几处不知起于何时的癞疮疤，这虽然也在他身上，而看阿Q的意思，倒也似乎以为不足贵的，因为他讳说“癞”，以及一切近于“赖”的音，后来推而广之，“光”也讳，“亮”也讳，再后来，连“灯”“烛”都讳了。一犯讳，不问有心与无心，阿Q便全疤通红的发起怒来，估量了对手，口讷的他便骂，气力小的他便打；然而不知怎么一回事，总还是阿Q吃亏的时候多。于是他渐渐的变换了方针，大抵改为怒目而视了。,"Ah Q is ""previously broad"", has high knowledge, and ""really can do"". He was almost a ""perfect man"", but unfortunately he still has some shortcomings in his physique. The most annoying thing is that on his scalp, there are quite a few leprosy scars that don't appear from time to time. Although this is also on him, and looking at Ah Q's meaning, it seems that it is not expensive, because he avoids saying ""leprosy"". "", and all the sounds close to ""Lai"". Later, it was generalized, ""light"" was also taboo, ""bright"" was also taboo, and later, even ""lamp"" and ""candle"" were taboo. As soon as he made a taboo, regardless of whether he was intentional or unintentional, Ah Q would get angry with scars all over his face. He measured his opponent. There are many times when you suffer. So he gradually changed his approach, and probably turned to glaring at him.","Though the people of Weizhuang, of course, were still village idiots: think of it – they didn’t even know how people fried fish in town! This Ah-Q of ours – with his wealthy forebears, his urban sophistication, his laudable application to his chosen career – would have been the embodiment of perfection, had it not been for his regrettable possession of a few constitutional defects. The most annoying of which was the perfidious emergence on his scalp of a number of gleaming ringworm scars. Although they were of his own revered body’s making, Ah-Q felt them unworthy of him and for this reason came to view as taboo the word ‘ringworm’, or anything that sounded like it. In time, the scope of this linguistic prohibition steadily broadened: first to ‘shiny’, then ‘bright’, extending a little later on to ‘lamp’ or ‘candle’. Any flaunting of the taboo – whether deliberate or accidental – provoked first the controversial scars to glow a furious red. Ah-Q would then size up his adversary: the dull-witted he would subject to a tongue-lashing; the weak he would punch in the nose. The curious thing, though, was how often – in fact, almost always – Ah-Q came off worse. In time, then, he pared his strategy down to an Angry Glare.","Ah Q who “used to be much better off,” who was a man of the world and a “worker,” would have been almost the perfect man had it not been for a few unfortunate physical blemishes. The most annoying were some patches on his scalp where at some uncertain date shiny ringworm scars had appeared. Although these were on his own head, apparently Ah Q did not consider them as altogether honourable, for he refrained from using the word “ringworm” or any words that sounded anything like it. Later he improved on this, making “bright” and “light” forbidden words, while later still even “lamp” and “candle” were taboo. Whenever this taboo was disregarded, whether intentionally or not, Ah Q would fly into a rage, his ringworm scars turning scarlet. He would look over the offender, and if it were someone weak in repartee he would curse him while if it were a poor fighter he would hit him. Yet, curiously enough, it was usually Ah Q who was worsted in these encounters, until finally he adopted new tactics, contenting himself in general with a furious glare."

单四嫂子是一个粗笨女人，不明白这“但”字的可怕：许多坏事固然幸亏有了他才变好，许多好事却也因为有了他都弄糟。夏天夜短，老拱们呜呜的唱完了不多时，东方已经发白；不一会，窗缝里透进了银白色的曙光。,"Shansi's sister-in-law is a clumsy woman, and she doesn't understand the horror of the word ""but"": although many bad things are made better thanks to him, many good things are also ruined because of him. The summer night is short, and not long after the old arches finished singing, the east was already white; after a while, the silver-white dawn penetrated through the cracks of the windows.","Mrs Shan was a simple, uneducated sort of a woman, the sort who didn’t understand the terrifying powers of the word ‘but’: its marvellous ability to transform the bad into good, and to perform the same trick in reverse. Not long after the sentimental cadences from next door died away, the darkness began to pale over to the east, and the first, hopeful silver light of dawn crept in through a crack in the window, drawing the short summer night to a close.","Fourth Shan's Wife was a simple woman, who did not know what a fearful word ""but"" is. Thanks to this ""but,"" many bad things turn out well, many good things turn out badly. A summer night is short.

有一年的春天，他醉醺醺的在街上走，在墙根的日光下，看见王胡在那里赤着膊捉虱子，他忽然觉得身上也痒起来了。这王胡，又癞又胡，别人都叫他王癞胡，阿Q却删去了一个癞字，然而非常渺视他。阿Q的意思，以为癞是不足为奇的，只有这一部络腮胡子，实在太新奇，令人看不上眼。他于是并排坐下去了，倘是别的闲人们，阿Q本不敢大意坐下去，但这王胡旁边，他有什么怕呢，老实说，他肯坐下去，简直还是抬举他。,"One spring, he was walking down the street drunkenly, and in the sunlight at the base of the wall, he saw Wang Hu catching lice with his bare arms, and suddenly he felt itchy too. This Wang Hu was both lepery and husky. Others called him Wang Leihu, but Ah Q deleted the word lei, but he was very contemptuous of him. Ah Q's meaning was that he thought leprosy was not surprising. Only this beard was so novel that it made people look down on him. He then sat down side by side. If it were other idlers, Ah Q would not have dared to sit down carelessly, but next to Wang Hu, what was he afraid of? To be honest, he was willing to sit down, and he was just flattering him.","Ambling drunkenly along one spring day, he came upon an individual by the name of Wang sitting in the sunlight at the foot of a wall, stripped to the waist, busily delousing. Ah-Q’s skin suddenly prickled all over. In tribute to his abundance of both facial hair and ringworm, the people of Weizhuang generally acclaimed this Wang as Hairy Ringwormed Wang. Now although – for his own delicate reasons – Ah-Q preferred not to bring up the subject of ringworm, this Wang still enjoyed his utter contempt. Ringworm, for Ah-Q, was nothing to be particularly ashamed of; it was the man’s excessively hairy chops that offered grounds for true scorn. He sat down alongside him. Ah-Q would not have dared sit so carelessly next to any other of Weizhuang’s idlers, but what did he have to fear from this scurvy hair-ball? That he was willing even to sit down next to him was, quite simply, an exalted honour for the wretch.","One spring, when he was walking along in state of happy intoxication, he saw Whiskers Wang sitting stripped to the waist in the sunlight at the foot of a wall, catching lice; and at this sight his own body began to itch. Since Whiskers Wang was scabby and bewhiskered, everybody called him “Ringworm Whiskers Wang.” Although Ah Q omitted the word “Ringworm,” he had the greatest contempt for the man. To Ah Q, while scabs were nothing to take exception to, such hairy cheeks were really too outlandish and could excite nothing but scorn. So Ah Q sat down by his side. Had it been any other idler, Ah Q would never have dared sit down so casually; but what had he to fear by the side of Whiskers Wang? In fact, his willingness to sit down was doing the fellow an honour."
“什么法呢？我‘文不像誊录生武不像救火兵’，别的做什么？”,"""What's the law? I'm not like transcribes and martial arts are not like firefighters, what else should I do?""","‘What else am I fit for?

我的活力这时大约有些凝滞了，坐着没有动，也没有想，直到看见分驻所里走出一个巡警，才下了车。,"My energy was stagnant at this point, I sat without moving or thinking, until I saw a patrolman walking out of the sub-station, and I got out of the car.","There I sat, as if physically and mentally paralysed, until a policeman emerged from the station. I now stepped out of the carriage.","Almost paralysed at that juncture I sat there motionless, my mind a blank, until a policeman came out. Then I got down from the rickshaw."
村人看见赵七爷到村，都赶紧吃完饭，聚在七斤家饭桌的周围。七斤自己知道是出场人物，被女人当大众这样辱骂，很不雅观，便只得抬起头，慢慢地说道：,"When the villagers saw Zhao Qiye arrive in the village, they hurriedly finished their meal and gathered around the dining table of Qijin's family. Qijin himself knew that he was a character, and it was very unsightly to be insulted by a woman as a public, so he had to raise his head and said slowly:","Having witnessed Mr Zhao’s grand entrance, everyone else in the village hastily finished their meals, then gathered around the Seven-Pounds’s table. Conscious that he had a reputation to maintain around the village – a reputation that was somewhat tarnished by submitting to such a public dressing down – Seven-Pounds forced himself to look up.",Seventh Master Zhao's arrival in the village made all the villagers finish their supper quickly and gather round Sevenpounder's table. Sevenpounder knew how unseemly it was for a prominent citizen to be cursed in public like this by his wife. So he raised his head to retort slowly:
“你今天说现成话，那时你……”,"""You said ready-made words today, when you...""",‘With hindsight – ’ he ponderously began.,"“You've plenty to say today, but at the time....”"
“秃儿。驴……”阿Q历来本只在肚子里骂，没有出过声，这回因为正气忿，因为要报仇，便不由的轻轻的说出来了。,"""Bald. Donkey..."" Ah Q had always scolded in his stomach without saying a word, but this time, because he was angry and wanted revenge, he couldn't help but say it softly.","‘Bald… ass…’ On previous occasions, Ah-Q had kept his insults safely confined to his own head. This time, however, in his furious desire for revenge against a harsh, cruel world, they crept softly out into the open.","“Baldhead! Ass...” In the past Ah Q had just cursed under his breath, inaudibly; but today, because he was in a rage and itching for revenge, the words slipped out involuntarily."
第二天，我向午才起来，并没有听到什么关系八公公盐柴事件的纠葛，下午仍然去钓虾。,"The next day, I didn't get up until Xiang Wu, and I didn't hear any entanglements related to Hachikong's Yanchai incident, so I still went fishing for shrimps in the afternoon.","It was almost noon before I got up the next day. As Shuangxi’s uncle didn’t seem to have challenged our appropriation of his firewood or salt, in the afternoon I went fishing for prawns as usual.","I did not get up till noon the next day, and there was no word of any trouble with Eighth Granduncle over the salt or firewood. That afternoon we went to catch prawns as usual."
“谁不知道你正经，……短见是万万寻不得的。”邹七嫂也从旁说。,"""Who doesn't know you're serious, ... short-sightedness is impossible to find."" Sister-in-law Zou also said from the side.","Mr Zhao’s daughter-in-law was trying to coax Mrs Wu out of the servants’ quarters. ‘Don’t let it upset you.’ ‘No one thinks the worse of you,’ Mrs Zou interpolated, ‘you mustn’t think of killing yourself.’","“Come outside... don't stay brooding in your own room.” “Everybody knows you are a good woman,” put in Mrs. Zou from the side. “You mustn't think of committing suicide.”"
现在不是已经有剪掉头发的女人，因此考不进学校去，或者被学校除了名么？,"Isn't there a woman who has cut her hair now, so she can't get into the school, or has her name expelled from the school?","No school will take a girl who’s cut her hair; or if she’s already in school, she’s expelled for it.","Aren't there already girls who can't take the school entrance examinations, or who are expelled because they've bobbed their hair?"

他付过地保二百文酒钱，愤愤的躺下了，后来想：“现在的世界太不成话，儿子打老子……”于是忽而想到赵太爷的威风，而现在是他的儿子了，便自己也渐渐的得意起来，爬起身，唱着《小孤孀上坟》[22]到酒店去。这时候，他又觉得赵太爷高人一等了。,"He paid 200 wen for the ground insurance, and lay down angrily. Later, he thought: ""The world is too ridiculous now, my son beats Laozi..."" So he suddenly thought of Mr. Zhao's prestige, and now he is his son, so he Gradually, he became complacent, got up, and went to the hotel singing ""Little Lonely Widow Going to the Grave""[22]. At this time, he felt that Mr. Zhao was superior.","he fulminated to himself in bed, after paying off the constable. ‘ Sons hitting their fathers…’ Now, if someone as rich and powerful as Mr Zhao was his son… Soon enough, feeling extremely pleased with himself again, he wandered off to the tavern, humming a few lines of opera to himself – The Young Widow at Her Husband’s Grave. Mr Zhao, Ah-Q was prepared to allow, was a cut above the rest of Weizhuang’s scum.","After paying the bailiff two hundred cash he lay down angrily. Then he said to himself, “What is the word coming to nowadays, with sons beating their fathers!” And then the thought of the prestige of Mr. Zhao, who was now his son, gradually raised his spirits. He scrambled up and made his way to the tavern singing The Young Widow at Her Husband's Grave. At that time he did feel that Mr. Zhao was a cut above most people."
太阳早出了。单四嫂子抱了孩子，带着药包，越走觉得越重；孩子又不住的挣扎，路也觉得越长。没奈何坐在路旁一家公馆的门槛上，休息了一会，衣服渐渐的冰着肌肤，才知道自己出了一身汗；宝儿却仿佛睡着了。他再起来慢慢地走，仍然支撑不得，耳朵边忽然听得人说：——,"The sun is out early. Shan Si's sister-in-law hugged the child and carried the medicine bag. The more she walked, the heavier she felt; the child kept struggling, and the road felt longer. He had no choice but to sit on the threshold of a mansion next to the road, resting for a while, his clothes gradually freezing to his skin, only then did he realize that he was sweating all over, but Baoer seemed to be asleep. He got up again and walked slowly, still unable to hold on, and suddenly heard someone say:—","She was stupid with terror. The sun was now high in the sky. Walking along with the medicine and a fidgeting child in her arms, Mrs Shan began to feel the weight of them; home began to seem ever more distant. Eventually, she sat down to rest at the threshold of one of the village’s better establishments, her clothes clinging clammily to her – she suddenly realized she was covered in sweat. Bao’er seemed to have fallen asleep. Up she got, and went slowly on her way.","He had never done this before, and his mother was terrified. The sun was fairly high now. With the child in her arms and the package of medicine to carry, the further she walked the heavier she found her load. The child kept struggling too, which made the way seem even longer. She had to sit down on the door-step of a big house by the roadside to rest for a while; and presently her clothes lay so clammy against her skin that she realized she had been swearing. But Pao-erh seemed fast asleep. When she stood up again to walk slowly on, she still found him too heavy. A voice beside her said:"
“你还不配……”这时候，又仿佛在他头上的是一种高尚的光荣的癞头疮，并非平常的癞头疮了；但上文说过，阿Q是有见识的，他立刻知道和“犯忌”有点抵触，便不再往底下说。,"""You're not worthy..."" At this time, it seemed that he had a noble and glorious leprosy on his head, not an ordinary leprosy; but as mentioned above, Ah Q was knowledgeable, he Immediately know that there is a bit of conflict with ""taboo"", so I don't talk about it anymore.","‘You’re not worth a…’ At moments such as these, Ah-Q’s ringworm suddenly struck him as a badge of honour for which no sacrifice was too great; far superior to your average, run-ofthe-mill dermatological defect. As has been amply demonstrated, however, Ah-Q was a man of exceptional prescience: sensing an imminent breaking of his cherished taboo, he said no more.","“You don't even deserve...” At this juncture it seemed as if the bald patches on his scalp were noble and honourable, not just ordinary ringworm scars. However, as we said above, Ah Q was a man of the world: he knew at once that he had nearly broken the “taboo” and refrained from saying any more."
六一公公看见我，便停了楫，笑道，“请客？——这是应该的。”于是对我说，“迅哥儿，昨天的戏可好么？”,"When Father Liuyi saw me, he stopped and said with a smile, ""A treat?—This is what it should be."" So he said to me, ""Brother Xun, how was yesterday's show?""","‘A guest?’ he said, smiling. ‘ Ah, excellent – excellent. Enjoy the opera, Master Xun?’","So you should.” Then he asked me, “Was yesterday's opera good, Brother Xun?”"
这几天，确凿没有纺纱的声音了。但夜深没有睡的既然只有两家，这单四嫂子家有声音，便自然只有老拱们听到，没有声音，也只有老拱们听到。,"These days, there is definitely no sound of spinning. But since there were only two families who didn't sleep in the middle of the night, the fourth sister-in-law's house had a sound, so naturally only the old arches heard it, and there was no sound, only the old arches heard it.","But for the last few days, no spinning had been heard. Since only two adjoining establishments stayed awake into the night, only Gong and his fellow drinkers would hear any noise that was to be heard from Mrs Shan’s; or fail to hear it, in its absence.","It was a fact that for several days now there had been no sound of spinning. But since only two households were awake at midnight, Old Kung and the others were naturally the only ones who would notice if there were any sound from Fourth Shan's Wife's house, and the only ones to notice if there were no sound."
凉风虽然拂拂的吹动他斑白的短发，初冬的太阳却还是很温和的来晒他。但他似乎被太阳晒得头晕了，脸色越加变成灰白，从劳乏的红肿的两眼里，发出古怪的闪光。这时他其实早已不看到什么墙上的榜文了，只见有许多乌黑的圆圈，在眼前泛泛的游走。,"Although the cool wind was blowing his gray short hair, the early winter sun was still very gentle to tan him. But he seemed to be dizzy from the sun, and his face became more and more gray, and from his tired red and swollen eyes, there was a strange flash of light. At this time, he actually didn't see any posters on the wall for a long time, and only saw many black circles wandering in front of his eyes.","A cold wind was ruffling his short, greying hair, as he soaked up the warmth of the early winter sun. Dazzled by its brightness, his exhausted, puffy eyes glinted strangely within his ashen face. The list now swam before him, a shoal of black circles.","A cool wind was ruffling his short greying hair and the early winter sun shone warmly on him, yet he felt dizzy as if from a touch of the sun. His pale face grew even paler; his tired eyes, puffy and red, glittering strangely. In fact, he had long stopped seeing the results on the wall, for countless black circles were swimming past his eyes."
书上写着这许多字，佃户说了这许多话，却都笑吟吟的睁着怪眼睛看我。,"There are so many words written on the book, and the tenants said so many words, but they all looked at me with a smile and strange eyes.","All these words – written in books, spoken by the farmer – stare strangely, smirkingly at me.","All these words written in the book, all the words spoken by our tenant, eye me quizzically with an enigmatic smile."
大家都高兴，说又有小兔可看了；三太太便对孩子们下了戒严令，从此不许再去捉。我的母亲也很喜欢他们家族的繁荣，还说待生下来的离了乳，也要去讨两匹来养在自己的窗外面。,"Everyone was happy and said that there was another rabbit to watch; the third wife placed martial law on the children, and they were not allowed to catch them again. My mother also likes the prosperity of their family very much, and she also said that when the baby is weaned, she will ask for two horses to raise outside her window.","The discovery was general cause for rejoicing, for now there would be even more little rabbits to entertain us. For the time being, my sister-in-law prohibited the children from picking them up. Even my mother was delighted at their fecundity. Once the babies were weaned, she decided she’d ask for a couple for herself, to keep in her own courtyard.","Everybody was delighted, looking forward to another batch of small rabbits. Third Mistress strictly forbade the children to pick them up any more. My mother, too, was delighted by their family's flourishing and said, once the litter was weaned, she would ask for a couple to keep outside her own window."
七斤嫂还没有答话，忽然看见七斤从小巷口转出，便移了方向，对他嚷道，“你这死尸怎么这时候才回来，死到那里去了！不管人家等着你开饭！”,"Sister-in-law Qijin didn't answer when she suddenly saw Qijin turn out of the alley, she turned her direction and shouted to him, ""Why did you come back at this time, you dead body, where did you die! No matter what people are waiting for you to cook! ""","Before she had time for a second riposte, Mrs Seven-Pounds spotted her husband emerge from a bend in the lane. ‘ What kind of time d’you call this?’ she yelled, spinning round to face him. ‘Where the hell’ve you been? We’ve none of us had dinner!’","Before Mrs. Sevenpounder could answer, she saw her husband emerge from the top of the lane and rounded on him instead. “Why so late back, you zombie? I thought you must be dead, keeping us waiting all this time for supper!”"
过了几天，我的话居然证实了，因为爱罗先珂君已经买到了十几个科斗子。他买来便放在他窗外的院子中央的小池里。那池的长有三尺，宽有二尺，是仲密所掘，以种荷花的荷池。从这荷池里，虽然从没有见过养出半朵荷花来，然而养虾蟆却实在是一个极合式的处所。,"A few days later, my words were actually confirmed, because Lord Ara Xianke had already bought more than a dozen Kedouzi. He bought it and put it in the small pool in the middle of the yard outside his window. The pond was three feet long and two feet wide. It was a lotus pond dug by Zhongmi and planted with lotus flowers. From this lotus pond, although I have never seen half a lotus flower raised, it is really a very suitable place to raise shrimp toads.","And within a few days, we were indeed visited by frogs: a dozen tadpoles introduced into the house by Eroshenko, and placed in the small pond in the centre of the courtyard outside his window. Around three feet long by two feet wide, the pond had been dug by my brother and intended for growing lotus. Although the lotus had never taken, the pond looked a perfect home for the tadpoles.","A few days later, sure enough, I was proved right, as Eroshenko bought a dozen or so tadpoles. He put them into a miniature pool in the middle of the yard outside his window. Three feet long and two feet wide, it had been dug by Zhong Mi to serve as a lotus pool. Although no one had ever seen even half a lotus growing there, it was a most appropriate place to raise frogs."
“阿弥陀佛，阿Q，你怎么跳进园里来偷萝卜。……阿呀，罪过呵，阿唷，阿弥陀佛！……”,"""Amitabha, Ah Q, why did you jump into the garden to steal radishes. . . . ah, sin, ah, Amitabha!  …""","What are you doing in our garden, Ah-Q, stealing our turnips! … Stop thief!’ ‘Me?","“May Buddha preserve us, Ah Q! How dare you climb into our garden to steal turnips!... Mercy on us, what a wicked thing to do! Aiya, Buddha preserve us!”"
阿Q的耳朵里，本来早听到过革命党这一句话，今年又亲眼见过杀掉革命党。但他有一种不知从那里来的意见，以为革命党便是造反，造反便是与他为难，所以一向是“深恶而痛绝之”的。殊不料这却使百里闻名的举人老爷有这样怕，于是他未免也有些“神往”了，况且未庄的一群鸟男女的慌张的神情，也使阿Q更快意。,"In Ah Q's ears, he had heard the words of the revolutionary party long ago, but this year he witnessed the killing of the revolutionary party with his own eyes. But he had an opinion that came from nowhere, thinking that the revolutionary party was rebelling, and that rebelling was embarrassing him, so he had always been ""deeply hated and hated"". Unexpectedly, this made the famous Juren Master Baili feel so afraid, so he was somewhat ""fascinated"", and the panicked expressions of the flock of birds and men and women in Weizhuang also made Ah Q more happy.","Revolutionaries were old news to Ah-Q: why, earlier that year, he had watched them being executed. Back then, he had had an intuition – why, he couldn’t say – that these revolutionaries were rebelling against the established order of things, and that rebellion would make his life difficult; and so he had conceived a violent hatred for them. But here they were, putting the wind up even Mr Provincial Examination – a man famous for a whole thirty miles around and about. This – taken in combination with the state of dread into which the villagers, now twittering like frightened birds, had been thrown – struck Ah-Q as all rather delicious.","Ah Q had long since known of revolutionaries and this year with his own eyes had seen revolutionaries decapitated. But since it had occurred to him that the revolutionaries were rebels and that a rebellion would make things difficult for him, he had always detested and kept away from them. Who could have guessed that they could strike such fear into a successful provincial candidate renowned for a hundred li around? In consequence, Ah Q could not help feeling rather fascinated, the terror of all the villagers only adding to his delight."
他这一战，早忘却了王胡，也忘却了假洋鬼子，似乎对于今天的一切“晦气”都报了仇；而且奇怪，又仿佛全身比拍拍的响了之后更轻松，飘飘然的似乎要飞去了。,"In this battle, he had long forgotten Wang Hu and the fake foreign devils. He seemed to have avenged all the ""bad luck"" today; and it was strange, and it seemed that his whole body was more relaxed than after the sound of the pat, and he seemed to be sluggish. flew away.","This great struggle and ultimate victory banished all memory of the hairy Wang, and the Fake Foreign Devil; fitting revenge, it seemed, had been taken on the day’s misfortunes. The curious thing was that he now felt even lighter of heart than he had done after his second beating – so light that he was in danger of floating off into the ether.","This encounter had made him forget Whiskers Wang and the Bogus Foreign Devil, as if all the day's bad luck had been avenged. And strange to relate, even more completely relaxed than after the thwacking, he felt as if he were walking on air."
方玄绰近来爱说“差不多”这一句话，几乎成了“口头禅”似的；而且不但说，的确也盘据在他脑里了。他最初说的是“都一样”，后来大约觉得欠稳当了，便改为“差不多”，一直使用到现在。,"Fang Xuanchuo likes to say the phrase ""almost"" recently, it almost becomes a ""mantra""; not only did he say it, but it was indeed entrenched in his mind. He originally said ""all the same"", but later he felt that it was not safe, so he changed it to ""similarly"", which has been used until now.","Fang Xuanchuo has lately taken up with a new pet phrase – more a way of life than a trite little idiom. In times past, ‘it’s all the same’ was a great favourite, but – maybe because he felt it was of insufficiently universal application – ‘more or less the same’","Recently the phrase “much of a muchness” had virtually become Fang Xuanchuo's watchword. Not only on his lips, it was indeed entrenched in his mind. At first he had said “all the same.” Later, probably thinking this unreliable, he had switched to “much of a muchness” and used it right up till now."
“忘了？这真是贵人眼高……”,"""Forgot? This is really noble...""","‘Forgotten? Me?’ she said, a sarcastic smile on her face.",“You had forgotten? But naturally I must be beneath your notice....”
离平桥村还有一里模样，船行却慢了，摇船的都说很疲乏，因为太用力，而且许久没有东西吃。这回想出来的是桂生，说是罗汉豆[6]正旺相，柴火又现成，我们可以偷一点来煮吃的。大家都赞成，立刻近岸停了船；岸上的田里，乌油油的便都是结实的罗汉豆。,"It was still a mile away from Pingqiao Village, but the boat was slow, and everyone who rocked the boat said that they were tired because they were working too hard, and there was no food for a long time. This time I came up with Gui Sheng, who said that it was Luo Han Dou [6] that was flourishing and firewood was readily available, so we could steal some to cook and eat. Everyone agreed, and immediately stopped the boat near the shore; the fields on the shore were full of sturdy mangosteens.","Around half a mile from Pingqiao, the boat slowed, our rowers complaining of hunger and fatigue; it was hours since they had last eaten. Now it was Guisheng’s turn to have a bright idea: the broad beans were ready right now, he said, and there was plenty of firewood on board. Why shouldn’t we grab a few handfuls for a midnight snack? Everyone agreed, and the boat pulled up next to a dark field bristling with healthy bean plants. ‘Hey, Ah-fa,’ Shuangxi called out, jumping on to the bank and pointing at the fields.","We were still about one li from Pingqiao when our boat slowed down, the oarsmen saying that they were tired after rowing so hard, with nothing to eat for hours. It was Guisheng who had a bright idea this time. He said the broad beans were just ripe, and there was fuel on the boat—we could filch some beans and cook them. Everybody approving, we promptly drew alongside the bank and stopped. The pitch-black fields were filled with plump broad beans."
N显出非常得意模样，忽而又沉下脸来：,"N looked very proud, and suddenly lowered his face:","For a brief moment, he actually looked pleased with himself.",N had been looking very smug. Now suddenly his face fell.

远远的走来了一个人，他的对头又到了。这也是阿Q最厌恶的一个人，就是钱太爷的大儿子。他先前跑上城里去进洋学堂，不知怎么又跑到东洋去了，半年之后他回到家里来，腿也直了，辫子也不见了，他的母亲大哭了十几场，他的老婆跳了三回井。后来，他的母亲到处说，“这辫子是被坏人灌醉了酒剪去的。本来可以做大官，现在只好等留长再说了。”然而阿Q不肯信，偏称他“假洋鬼子”，也叫作“里通外国的人”，一见他，一定在肚子里暗暗的咒骂。,"A man came from a distance, and his adversary arrived again. This is also the person Ah Q hates the most, the eldest son of Mr. Qian. He had run to the city to go to the foreign school, but somehow he went to Dongyang again. After half a year, he returned home, his legs were straight, his braids were gone, his mother cried a dozen times, and his The wife jumped back to the well three times. Later, his mother said everywhere, ""This braid was cut off by a bad guy who got drunk and drunk. He could have been a high-ranking official, but now he has to wait until it is long."" However, Ah Q refused to believe it, calling him a ""fake foreign devil."" "", also known as ""a person who has access to foreign countries"", when he sees him, he must curse secretly in his stomach.","In the distance, yet another of Ah-Q’s bêtes noires was now approaching, yet another individual for whom Ah-Q felt the greatest disgust: Mr Qian’s eldest son. Some time past, he had gone off to town to enrol in one of the newfangled Academies of Western Learning, then somehow gone off again to Japan. Six months later, he was back, goose-stepping like a foreigner and his queue gone with the fairies. His mother had wept inconsolably, while his wife had tried to commit suicide three times by jumping into the well. Eventually, his mother took to putting it about that ‘wicked people had got him drunk and cut off his queue. Otherwise, he’d have had a top posting by now, but as it is he’ll have to wait till it’s grown back.’ Ah-Q was having none of this, and knew him only as the ‘Fake Foreign Devil’, or ‘Traitor’. Whenever he saw him, his stomach silently churned with invective.","From the distance approached another of Ah Q's enemies. This was Mr. Qian's eldest son whom Ah Q thoroughly despised. After studying in a foreign-style school in the city, it seemed he had gone to Japan. When he came home half a year later his legs were straight and his queue had disappeared. His mother wept bitterly a dozen times, and his wife tried three times to jump into the well. Later his mother told everyone, “His queue was cut off by some scoundrel when he was drunk. By rights he ought to be a big official, but now he'll have to wait till it's grown again.” Ah Q, however, did not believe this, and insisted on calling him a “Bogus Foreign Devil” or “Traitor in Foreign Pay.” At sight of him he would start cursing under his breath."

“老栓只是忙。要是他的儿子……”驼背五少爷话还未完，突然闯进了一个满脸横肉的人，披一件玄色布衫，散着纽扣，用很宽的玄色腰带，胡乱捆在腰间。刚进门，便对老栓嚷道：——,"""Old Shuan is just busy. If his son..."" The hunchbacked fifth young master had not finished his words, and suddenly broke into a man with a face full of flesh, wearing a black cloth shirt with loose buttons and a very wide black belt , tied around his waist indiscriminately.

至于我家大哥，也毫不冤枉他。他对我讲书的时候，亲口说过可以“易子而食”[4]；又一回偶然议论起一个不好的人，他便说不但该杀，还当“食肉寝皮”[5]。我那时年纪还小，心跳了好半天。前天狼子村佃户来说吃心肝的事，他也毫不奇怪，不住的点头。可见心思是同从前一样狠。既然可以“易子而食”，便什么都易得，什么人都吃得。我从前单听他讲道理，也胡涂过去；现在晓得他讲道理的时候，不但唇边还抹着人油，而且心里满装着吃人的意思。,"As for my eldest brother, he is not wronged either. When he taught me a book, he personally said that he could ""change sons and eat""[4]; once again, when he accidentally talked about a bad person, he said that not only should he be killed, but he should also be ""eat flesh and sleep skin""[5] ]. I was still young and my heart was beating for a long time. When the tenant of Tianlangzi Village said something about his heart and soul, he was not surprised, and couldn't stop nodding his head. It can be seen that the mind is as ruthless as before. Since it is possible to ""change children and eat"", everything is easy to get, and everyone can eat. In the past, I just listened to his reasoning, and I was fooling myself; now I know that when he was reasoning, not only did I have human oil on my lips, but my heart was full of the intention of eating people.","Neither were my suspicions of my own brother unfounded. When he was teaching me history as a boy, he once told me people could ‘exchange sons to eat’ in times of scarcity; or then again, while discussing a notorious villain, he told me death alone was too good for him; that ‘his flesh should be devoured, his skin flayed into a rug’.2 For hours afterwards, my heart pounded with fear. A few days ago, when the farmer from Wolf Cub Village told him about the business with the heart and liver, he merely nodded; nothing surprises him. At heart, he is ruthless; still perfectly ruthless. If sons are fodder for the dinner table, then anyone could be. I used to just let him preach at me – to let his sermons pass me by. Now, I know his lips were smeared with human grease, his thoughts only of eating people.","As for my elder brother, I have also good reason to suspect him. When he was teaching me, he told me himself, “People exchange their sons to eat.” And once in discussing a bad man he said that not only did the fellow deserve to be killed, he should “have his flesh eaten and his hide slept on.” I was still young at the time, and for quite a while my heart beat faster. That story our tenant from Wolf Cub Village told the other day about eating a man's heart and liver didn't surprise him at all—he kept nodding his head. He is evidently just as cruel as before. Since it is possible to “exchange sons to eat,” then anything can be exchanged, anyone can be eaten. In the past I simply listened to his explanations and let it go at that; now I know that when he gave me these explanations, not only was there human fat at the corner of his lips, but his whole heart was set on eating men."

但虽然是虫豸，闲人也并不放，仍旧在就近什么地方给他碰了五六个响头，这才心满意足的得胜的走了，他以为阿Q这回可遭了瘟。然而不到十秒钟，阿Q也心满意足的得胜的走了，他觉得他是第一个能够自轻自贱的人，除了“自轻自贱”不算外，余下的就是“第一个”。状元[18]不也是“第一个”么？“你算是什么东西”呢？！,"But even though it was a worm, the idler didn't let it go, and still gave him five or six hits somewhere nearby, and then he walked away contented and victorious.

哦，我记得了。我孩子时候，在斜对门的豆腐店里确乎终日坐着一个杨二嫂，人都叫伊“豆腐西施”[5]。但是擦着白粉，颧骨没有这么高，嘴唇也没有这么薄，而且终日坐着，我也从没有见过这圆规式的姿势。那时人说：因为伊，这豆腐店的买卖非常好。但这大约因为年龄的关系，我却并未蒙着一毫感化，所以竟完全忘却了。然而圆规很不平，显出鄙夷的神色，仿佛嗤笑法国人不知道拿破仑[6]，美国人不知道华盛顿[7]似的，冷笑说：,"Oh, I remember. When I was a child, there was indeed a second sister-in-law Yang sitting in the tofu shop diagonally opposite the door. But with white powder, the cheekbones are not so high, the lips are not so thin, and sitting all day, I have never seen such a compass pose. At that time, people said: Because of Yi, the business of this tofu shop is very good. But this was probably because of my age, but I was not affected in the slightest, so I completely forgot about it. However, the compass was very uneven, showing a look of contempt, as if sneering that the French did not know Napoleon[6] and the Americans did not know Washington[7], and sneered:","I began to remember. When I was a child, this Mrs Yang – celebrated locally as ‘the Bean-Curd Beauty’ – had presided over the bean-curd shop opposite us. With a dusting of powder over her face, her cheekbones hadn’t stuck out so much, and her lips hadn’t looked so thin; and as she was always sitting down, I’d never got to see how spindly her legs really were. Everyone used to say back then that it was thanks to her the bean-curd shop turned over such a tidy profit. But I’d never given her much thought – probably because I was still so young – and in time had forgotten her entirely. She gazed on me with aggrieved contempt – as if I were a Frenchman who had never heard of Napoleon, or an American who knew nothing of Washington.","Then, to be sure, I remembered. When I was a child there was a Mrs. Yang who used to sit nearly all day long in the beancurd shop across the road, and everybody used to call her Beancurd Beauty. But she used to powder herself, and her cheekbones were not so prominent then nor her lips so thin; moreover she remained seated all the time, so that I had never noticed this resemblance to a compass. In those days people said that, thanks to her, that beancurd shop did very good business. But, probably on account of my age, she had made no impression on me, so that later I forgot her entirely. However, the Compass was extremely indignant and looked at me most contemptuously, just as one might look at a Frenchman who had never heard of Napoleon or an American who had never heard of Washington, and smiling sarcastically she said:"

然而老旦终于出台了。老旦本来是我所最怕的东西，尤其是怕他坐下了唱。这时候，看见大家也都很扫兴，才知道他们的意见是和我一致的。那老旦当初还只是踱来踱去的唱，后来竟在中间的一把交椅上坐下了。我很担心；双喜他们却就破口喃喃的骂。我忍耐的等着，许多工夫，只见那老旦将手一抬，我以为就要站起来了，不料他却又慢慢的放下在原地方，仍旧唱。全船里几个人不住的吁气，其余的也打起呵欠来。双喜终于熬不住了，说道，怕他会唱到明天还不完，还是我们走的好罢。大家立刻都赞成，和开船时候一样踊跃，三四人径奔船尾，拔了篙，点退几丈，回转船头，架起橹，骂着老旦，又向那松柏林前进了。,"However, Lao Dan finally came out. Lao Dan was what I was most afraid of, especially when he sat down and sang. At this time, I saw that everyone was also disappointed, and I realized that their opinions were the same as mine. That Lao Dan was just pacing and singing at first, but he actually sat down on the top seat in the middle. I was very worried; Shuangxi and the others murmured their curses. I waited patiently, for a long time, I saw that Lao Dan raised his hand, I thought he was about to stand up, but he slowly put it down and continued to sing. A few people in the boat couldn't help gasping for breath, and the rest yawned. Shuangxi finally couldn't stand it anymore, and said, I'm afraid that he will sing until tomorrow, so it's better for us to go. Everyone immediately agreed, and they were as enthusiastic as when the boat was sailing. Three or four people ran to the stern of the boat, pulled the pole, backed a few feet, turned the bow, set up the scull, scolded Lao Dan, and advanced to the Songbailin again.","But then an actor dressed up as an old woman emerged – my least favourite of all the turns, particularly when they launched into one of those static, seated arias. I glanced around at the rest of our party: they were obviously as disappointed as I was. After an introit in which the singer kept moving up and down the stage, he sat down on a folding chair in the centre. As my sense of foreboding grew, Shuangxi and the others began muttering mutinously. And yet still I patiently waited, for what seemed like an eternity. At one point, when the singer raised his hands, I was convinced he was about to get up – but back down he went, and the aria continued as before. The boat was now a mass of yawning sighs, until Shuangxi – unable to bear any more – spoke out: ‘He might go on past dawn,’ he said. ‘Might as well go back now.’ Immediately agreeing, everyone became as animated as they’d been on the outward journey. Three or four boys made for the stern to pull up the pole, pushing back against the bank to turn about. With the sculls at the ready, we set off, cursing that agonizing old woman.","But then the old woman came out. This was the character I dreaded most, especially when she sat down to sing. Now I saw by everybody's disappointment that they felt just as I did. To start with, the old woman simply walked to and fro singing, then she sat on a chair in the middle of the stage. I felt most dismayed, and Shuangxi and the rest started swearing. I waited patiently till, after a long time, the old woman raised her hand. I thought she was going to stand up. But dashing my hopes she lowered her hand slowly again just as before, and went on singing. Some of the boys in the boat could not help groaning; the rest began to yawn again. Finally Shuangxi, when he could stand it no longer, said he was afraid she might go on singing till dawn and we had better leave. We all promptly agreed, becoming as eager as when we had set out. Three or four boys ran to the stern, seized the poles to punt back several yards, then headed the boat around. Cursing the old woman, they set up the oars and started back for the pine-wood."

But he finally let it go, and spit out a mouthful of anger, ""Bah!""","This D had not only coiled his queue on the top of his head, he had also – believe it if you will – had the nerve to secure it with a bamboo chopstick.

He felt a desperate urge to grab hold of it, snap the chopstick, let the queue hang back down and give him a few good slaps around the face. That would teach him to forget his place in the cosmic order of things, to call himself a revolutionary. In the end, however, he decided to let him off with an Angry Glare and a gob of spit.","Young D, had also coiled his queue up on his head and, what was more, had actually used a bamboo chopstick to do so too.

Then came a brittle clink, jarring his wrist, as the hoe struck a hard object. He flung down his hoe and scrabbled around in the hole, finding at its base another large, square slab. His heart thumping, he concentrated his thoughts and energies on dislodging it; underneath he found the same black earth as before. On he dug through the inexhaustible ground until, at last, he struck against another hard object: round this time, a rusty copper coin perhaps, alongside a few indeterminate fragments of china.","The pit was over two feet deep yet still no crock had appeared and Chen Shicheng was beginning to lose heart when—clang!—he wrenched his wrist as the hoe struck something hard.

惟有三太太是常在那里喂他们波菜的，所以常想到。伊有一回走进窗后的小院子去，忽然在墙角上发见了一个别的洞，再看旧洞口，却依稀的还见有许多的爪痕。这爪痕倘说是大兔的，爪该不会有这样大，伊又疑心到那常在墙上的大黑猫去了，伊于是也就不能不定下发掘的决心了。伊终于出来取了锄子，一路掘下去，虽然疑心，却也希望着意外的见了小白兔的，但是待到底，却只见一堆烂草夹些兔毛，怕还是临蓐时候所铺的罢，此外是冷清清的，全没有那雪白的小兔的踪迹，以及他那只一探头未出洞外的弟弟了。,"Only the third wife is often there to feed them cabbage, so I often think about it. Yi once walked into the small courtyard behind the window, and suddenly found another hole in the corner of the wall. Looking at the old hole, there were still many claw marks. If the claw marks belonged to a big rabbit, the claw should not be so big. Yi was suspicious of the big black cat that often lived on the wall, so Yi had to make up his mind to dig it out. Yi finally came out to pick up the hoe and dug all the way. Although he was suspicious, he also hoped to meet the little white rabbit by accident, but after the end, he saw only a pile of rotten grass with some rabbit hair, I was afraid that it was the same as when he was born. After all, it was deserted, and there was no trace of the snow-white little rabbit or his little brother, who hadn't come out of the cave.","Except for my sister-in-law, that is, who had still been in the habit of leaving spinach out for them. One day, she discovered in one of the corners of the courtyard another burrow. On re-examining the original burrow, she could just about make out a cluster of claw marks – too big to have been made even by the parent rabbits. Her suspicions about the black cat growing, she decided to investigate further. Returning to the courtyard with a hoe, she dug down, still hoping beyond hope to find the little white rabbits. All she discovered was a pile of rotten straw mixed with rabbit fur, laid out – she imagined – during the period of confinement. But not a trace of the two babies.","Only Third Mistress often thought of them, as she had been in the habit of feeding them spinach. Once, going into the small yard by the back window, she suddenly spotted another hole by the corner of the wall, and when she looked again at the old hole she saw a good many faint paw-prints round the entrance. Not even the big rabbits could have made such big prints. Once again her suspicion fell on the big black cat who was so often on the wall. Thereupon she felt impelled to dig up the burrow. She finally got out a hoe and dug down. Although fearing the worst, she hoped against hope to discover the small white rabbits; but a heap of mouldy grass and rabbit-fur, probably spread there for the doe's confinement. Apart from that the place was bare, with not a trace of the snow-white little rabbit, or of his baby brother who had peeped out but not emerged from the burrow."
然而老头子使了一个眼色，阿Q便又被抓进栅栏门里了。他第二次抓出栅栏门，是第二天的上午。,"However, the old man winked, and Ah Q was caught in the gate again.

他站起身，点上灯火，屋子越显得静。他昏昏的走去关上门，回来坐在床沿上，纺车静静的立在地上。他定一定神，四面一看，更觉得坐立不得，屋子不但太静，而且也太大了，东西也太空了。太大的屋子四面包围着他，太空的东西四面压着他，叫他喘气不得。,"He stood up and lit the lights, and the room became quieter. He dazedly walked to close the door, came back and sat on the edge of the bed, the spinning wheel stood quietly on the ground. He was very calm, and when he looked around, he felt that he couldn't sit still. Not only was the room too quiet, but it was also too big, and things were too empty. The huge room surrounded him on all sides, and the things in space were pressing him on all sides, making him breathless.","Getting up, she turned on the lamp. Now the room seemed even quieter. She closed the door and returned to the edge of the bed, as if in a trance, the spinning wheel standing silently by. She looked around her, unwilling either to sit or stand: the room was too quiet, too big, too empty – an enormous void enveloping her, bearing down on her, stifling the breath out of her.","After she stood up and lit the lamp, the room seemed even more silent. She groped her way over to close the door, came back and sat on the bed, while the loom stood silent on the floor. She pulled herself together and looked around, feeling unable either to sit or stand. The room was not only too silent, it was far too big as well, and the things in it were far too empty. This overlarge room hemmed her in, and the emptiness all around bore hard on her, till she could hardly breathe."
孩子们时时捉他们来玩耍；他们很和气，竖起耳朵，动着鼻子，驯良的站在小手的圈子里，但一有空，却也就溜开去了。他们夜里的卧榻是一个小木箱，里面铺些稻草，就在后窗的房檐下。,"From time to time the children caught them to play; they were very kind, pricked up their ears, moved their noses, and stood tame in the circle of little hands, but when they were free, they slipped away. Their couch at night was a small wooden box with some straw in it, just under the eaves of the rear window.","The children were always playing with them. Confined in small, cupped hands, the rabbits would sit docilely enough, pricking up their ears and twitching their noses. But the moment an escape route opened up, they’d be off. At night, they slept in a small wooden hutch, carpeted with straw, set beneath the eaves overhanging the back window.","Fortunately, S and the cat were enemies, so perhaps there would be no trouble after all. The children often caught the rabbits to play with. They were very affable. Ears erect, their noses twitching, they stood meekly in the small hands encircling them; but as soon as they had a chance, they lolloped away. Their bed at night was a box, strewn with straw, under the eaves jutting over the back window."

但今天铁的光罩住了陈士成，又软软的来劝他了，他或者偶一迟疑，便给他正经的证明，又加上阴森的摧逼，使他不得不又向自己的房里转过眼光去。,"But today the iron mask covered Chen Shicheng, and he came to persuade him softly. If he hesitated, he would give him a serious proof and add a sinister force, so that he had to go to his room again. Look away.","This evening, however, the moon’s cold light enveloped and persuaded him, countering his doubts with proof – compelling his gaze back inside. A white fan of light flickered through his rooms.","But this iron light enfolding him today was gently persuasive. And when Chen Shicheng hesitated, the serious proofs it brought forward, backed up by some covert pressure, compelled him to cast his eyes towards his own room again. A white light, like a round white fan, was flickering in his room."
“谁知道头发的苦轮到我了。,"""Who knew it was my turn to suffer from hair.","‘And I’m one of them,’ he went on.","“Then, just fancy, it was my turn. Hair landed me in trouble."
自己想吃人，又怕被别人吃了，都用着疑心极深的眼光，面面相觑。……,"They wanted to eat people, but they were afraid of being eaten by others, so they all looked at each other with extremely suspicious eyes. ...","Craving flesh, dreading the teeth of others, eyeing each other with fear…","Wanting to eat men, at the same time afraid of being eaten themselves, they all eye each other with the deepest suspicion."
阿Q没有法，只得另外想出报复的话来：,Ah Q had no choice but to come up with other words for revenge:,they would shamelessly continue. Ah-Q struggled to find an appropriate riposte.,Ah Q could do nothing but rack his brains for some retort.

You need to count the words one by one when buying manuscripts, and the blanks don't count.

No news, 'far water cannot save near fire', who is patient.""","‘That publisher? The one in Shanghai? They pay by the word and don’t count the spaces.

于是一个长衫人物拿了一张纸，并一支笔送到阿Q的面前，要将笔塞在他手里。阿Q这时很吃惊，几乎“魂飞魄散”了：因为他的手和笔相关，这回是初次。他正不知怎样拿；那人却又指着一处地方教他画花押。,"So a figure in a long gown took a piece of paper and brought a pen to Ah Q, putting the pen in his hand. Ah Q was so surprised at this moment that he almost lost his mind: because his hand was related to the pen, this was the first time. He didn't know how to take it; the man pointed to a place to teach him how to draw monograms.","One of the long-gowns then took up a piece of paper and brought it over to Ah-Q, together with a brush, which he attempted to stuff into our hero’s hand. Ah-Q was scared almost witless: this was the first time in his life his hand had come into contact with a writing brush. As he tried to work out how to hold it, the man pointed at a place on the paper and commanded him to sign.","Then a man in a long coat brought a sheet of paper and held a brush in front of Ah Q, which he wanted to thrust into his hand. Ah Q was now nearly frightened out of his wits, because this was the first time in his life that his hand had ever come into contact with a writing-brush. He was just wondering how to hold it when the man pointed out a place on the paper and told him to sign his name."

“什么？……”阿Q诧异了。,"""What?..."" Ah Q was surprised.",‘Now what d’you want?’ ‘What?’,"“What more do you want to do to us?” “What?” demanded Ah Q, dumbfounded."
我向来没有这样忍耐的等候过什么事物，而况这身边的胖绅士的吁吁的喘气，这台上的冬冬喤喤的敲打，红红绿绿的晃荡，加之以十二点，忽而使我省悟到在这里不适于生存了。我同时便机械的拧转身子，用力往外只一挤，觉得背后便已满满的，大约那弹性的胖绅士早在我的空处胖开了他的右半身了，我后无回路，自然挤而又挤，终于出了大门。街上除了专等看客的车辆之外，几乎没有什么行人了，大门口却还有十几个人昂着头看戏目，别有一堆人站着并不看什么，我想：他们大概是看散戏之后出来的女人们的，而叫天却还没有来……,"I have never waited for anything so patiently, and the panting of the fat gentleman by my side, the beating of Dongdong on this stage, the swaying of red, green and green, plus twelve o'clock, suddenly made me realize It is not suitable to survive here. At the same time, I twisted my body mechanically and squeezed out with force. I felt that my back was full. Probably the elastic fat gentleman had already fattened his right half in my space. There was no loop behind me. Naturally Squeeze and squeeze, and finally out the door. There were hardly any pedestrians on the street except for vehicles waiting for spectators, but there were more than a dozen people at the gate watching the show with their heads held up. The women who came out after the show, but the gods haven't come yet...","I’ve never waited for anything so patiently in my life; much less in such adverse circumstances – with my overweight neighbour panting to my left, the gongs and drums clanging away on stage, the gaudy banners whirling back and forth, all the way up to midnight. Suddenly, reason reasserted itself: evolution , I realized again, had not equipped me to survive in such an environment. I spun round and began shoving my way out of the crowd. The moment I retreated, I felt a fleshy presence pressing in behind me; my corpulent neighbour, I guessed, had quickly expanded to fill the new space available. Given that a return to my place was now impossible, there was nothing for it but to push on, until eventually the main exit was mine. There was little coming and going on the street outside, apart from a column of rickshaws waiting for fares from the audience and a handful of people outside the main entrance, craning their heads up to study the programme notice, or gazing blankly around them. They must be watching for the women to spill out at the end of the performance, I thought to myself.","Never in my life have I waited so patiently for anything. But the wheezes of the fat gentleman next to me, the dingdong skirling, gonging and drumming on the stage, the whirling of gaudy colours, combined with the lateness of the hour, suddenly made me realize that this was no place for me. Mechanically turning round, I tried with might and main to shove my way out and felt the place behind me fill up at once—no doubt the elastic fat gentleman had expanded his right side into the space I vacated. With my retreat cut off, naturally there was nothing to do but push and push till at last I was out of the door. Apart from the rickshaws waiting for playgoers, there were practically no pedestrians in the street; but there were still a dozen or so people by the gate looking up at the programme, and another group not looking at anything who must, I thought, be waiting to watch the women come out after the show ended. And still no sign of Tan Xinpei...."

这时未庄的一伙鸟男女才好笑哩，跪下叫道，‘阿Q，饶命！’谁听他！第一个该死的是小D和赵太爷，还有秀才，还有假洋鬼子，……留几条么？王胡本来还可留，——但也不要了。……,"At this time, a group of birds and boys from Weichuang was amusing, knelt down and shouted, 'Ah Q, spare your life! ' Who listens to him! The first one to be damned is Xiao D and Mrs. Zhao, as well as Xiucai, and fake foreign devils. How many are left? Wang Hu could have stayed, but he didn't. ...","“Have mercy, Ah-Q, have mercy!” No mercy for them, ha! D and Mr Zhao’ll get it first, then his son, then the Fake Foreign Devil… Should I spare any of them? I used to think hairy Wang was all right, but not any more…","“Then the fun would start. All the villagers, the whole lousy lot, would kneel down and plead, ‘ Ah Q! Spare us!’But who would listen to them! The first to die would be Young D and Mr. Zhao, then the successful county candidate and the Bogus Foreign Devil.... But perhaps I would spare a few. I would once have spared Whiskers Wang, but now I don't even want him...."
陈士成心里仿佛觉得空虚了，浑身流汗，急躁的只爬搔；这其间，心在空中一抖动，又触着一种古怪的小东西了，这似乎约略有些马掌形的，但触手很松脆。他又聚精会神的挖起那东西来，谨慎的撮着，就灯光下仔细的看时，那东西斑斑剥剥的像是烂骨头，上面还带着一排零落不全的牙齿。他已经悟到这许是下巴骨了，而那下巴骨也便在他手里索索的动弹起来，而且笑吟吟的显出笑影，终于听得他开口道：,"Chen Shicheng seemed to feel empty in his heart, sweating all over his body, just crawling and scratching impatiently; during this time, his heart trembled in the air, and he touched a strange little thing, which seemed to be somewhat horseshoe-shaped, but the tentacles were very crunchy . He concentrated on digging up the thing again, and pinched it cautiously. When he looked carefully under the light, the thing was peeling like a rotten bone, with a row of missing teeth on it. He had already realized that this might be the chin bone, and the chin bone also moved in his hand, and he smiled and showed a smile, and finally heard him say:","He worked on frenetically, unthinkingly, his body covered in sweat, his heart pounding massively – as if suspended within a void. He encountered another strange object, shaped like a horseshoe, but brittle, flaking to the touch. Carefully, he unearthed it and picked it up. The lamplight exposed an ancient-looking bone, mottled with rot and crowned with an incomplete row of teeth. The jawbone, as he now recognized it to be, began to twitch into a ghoulish smile.","Faint and soaked in sweat, Chen Shicheng burrowed desperately. His heart nearly turned over when he struck another strange object shaped somewhat like a horseshoe, but light and brittle in his hands. Having extracted it with infinite care, he picked it up cautiously and studied it intently by the lamp. Blotched and discoloured like a mouldering bone, it bore an incomplete row of teeth on the upper side. He realized that it must be a jawbone twitched disconcertingly in his hands and gaped as if with laughter. Finally he heard it mutter:"
我们不能知道这晚上阿Q在什么时候才打鼾，但大约他从此总觉得指头有些滑腻，所以他从此总有些飘飘然；“女……”，他想。,"We don't know when Ah Q started snoring this night, but probably since then he has always felt a little slippery on his fingers, so he has always been a little bit more airy; ""Wo..."", he thought.","‘Sauce for the goose…’ he thought some more, ‘… must… find… woman!’ As to when, exactly, Ah-Q began snoring that evening, we have no reliable information. The only point on which we can be certain is that he fell asleep with that light-headed feeling of satiny smoothness still on his fingertips. ‘Woman…’","We shall never know when Ah Q finally fell asleep that evening. After this, however, he probably always found his fingers rather soft and smooth, and always remained a little light-headed. “Woman...” he kept thinking."

Off we went, chattering and laughing.","Grandmother and Mother, convinced, raised no further objections. Both smiled. We immediately rushed out."
然而这剪辫病传染了；第三天，师范学堂的学生忽然也剪下了六条辫子，晚上便开除了六个学生。这六个人，留校不能，回家不得，一直挨到第一个双十节之后又一个多月，才消去了犯罪的火烙印。,"However, the pigtail-cutting disease was contagious; on the third day, the students of the Normal School suddenly cut six pigtails, and six students were expelled at night. These six people were not allowed to stay in school or go home. It took more than a month after the first Double Tenth Festival before the stigma of crime was eliminated.","But soon it began spreading like the plague: three days later, six students in the local teacher-training college cut theirs off, too, and were expelled that same evening. They had nowhere to go – couldn’t stay at school, couldn’t go home. Somehow, they got by until a month or so after the Revolution, when everyone finally stopped treating them like criminals.","“But this queue-cutting proved contagious. Three days later, six students in the normal school suddenly cut off their queues too, and that evening they were expelled. They could neither remain in the school nor go home. Not till a month or more after the first Double Tenth did they stop being branded as criminals."

但自此之后，我总觉得凄凉。夜半在灯下坐着想，那两条小性命，竟是人不知鬼不觉的早在不知什么时候丧失了，生物史上不着一些痕迹，并S也不叫一声。我于是记起旧事来，先前我住在会馆里，清早起身，只见大槐树下一片散乱的鸽子毛，这明明是膏于鹰吻的了，上午长班[3]来一打扫，便什么都不见，谁知道曾有一个生命断送在这里呢？我又曾路过西四牌楼，看见一匹小狗被马车轧得快死，待回来时，什么也不见了，搬掉了罢，过往行人憧憧的走着，谁知道曾有一个生命断送在这里呢？夏夜，窗外面，常听到苍蝇的悠长的吱吱的叫声，这一定是给蝇虎咬住了，然而我向来无所容心于其间，而别人并且不听到……,"But since then, I've always felt bleak. Sitting under the lamp in the middle of the night, I thought that those two little lives were lost without anyone knowing it, and there was no trace in the history of biology, and S didn't even scream. So I remembered the old things. I lived in the guild hall before. When I got up early in the morning, I saw a scattered patch of pigeon feathers under the big locust tree. It was obviously anointed on the eagle's kiss. Nothing was seen, who knew that a life had been lost here? I once passed by the West Fourth Archway and saw a puppy that was run over by a carriage and was about to die. When I came back, nothing was missing. It was removed. Woolen cloth? On summer nights, outside the window, I often hear the long squeaking of flies, which must have been bitten by the flies and tigers, but I have never been in it, and others don't hear...","Somehow, though, I couldn’t quite shake off a sense of melancholy at the whole business. I would sit under the lamp, deep into the night, thinking about those two tiny creatures, their lives extinguished so anonymously, without even a warning bark from S. Years ago, I remembered, when I was living in a guesthouse in Beijing, I’d got up one morning to discover, beneath a large locust tree, a scattered heap of pigeon feathers – the leftovers of a hawk’s feast. By noon, the servant had swept the yard clean again, removing all traces of the massacre. Another time, passing by Xisi Arch, I saw a small dog close to death after being run over by a cart. But when I came back that way later, its body had been tidied away, with pedestrians passing unknowingly over the spot where a life had been ended. On summer nights, I would sometimes listen to the long whines of flies – bitten by spiders, I expect. But I soon forgot about them; and no one else ever even heard them.","But after that I kept feeling disconsolate. In the middle of the night, sitting under the lamp, I would think of those two little lives which had been lost none knows when, unnoticed by men or spirits, leaving no trace in the history of living creatures. Not even S had barked. This brought back old memories of when I was staying in our provincial hostel. Getting up early one day I saw beneath the big locust tree some scattered pigeon feathers, obviously let fall by a hawk. In the morning the attendant came to sweep up, and nothing was left of them. Who would have known that a life had been cut off here? Another time, passing the Xisi Archway, I saw a puppy dying, run over by a horsecart. On my return it had gone, someone had removed it, and which of the passers-by would have known that a life had been cut off here? On summer nights, outside the window, I often heard the long drawnout drone of flies which must have been caught by a spider, but I never paid any attention, and other people did not even hear...."
拍！拍拍！,shoot! Pat!,"Whack! Whack, whack!",Thwack! Thwack! Thwack!
这时候，他忽而又记起被金永生支使出来以后的事了。那时他惘惘的走过稻香村，看见店门口竖着许多斗大的字的广告道“头彩几万元”，仿佛记得心里也一动，或者也许放慢了脚步的罢，但似乎因为舍不得皮夹里仅存的六角钱，所以竟也毅然决然的走远了。他脸色一变，方太太料想他是在恼着伊的无教育，便赶紧退开，没有说完话。方玄绰也没有说完话，将腰一伸，咿咿呜呜的就念《尝试集》。,"At this time, he suddenly remembered what happened after he was sent out by Jin Yongsheng. At that time, he was wandering through Daoxiang Village, and saw a lot of advertisements with big characters on the door of the store saying ""The jackpot is tens of thousands of yuan"". There was only six cents left in the wallet, so he resolutely walked away. His expression changed, and Mrs. Fang thought that he was annoyed by Yi's lack of education, so she quickly backed away without finishing speaking. Fang Xuanchuo didn't finish his sentence, stretched his waist, and recited ""Trial Collection"".","He suddenly recalled something that had happened after his ejection by Jin Yongsheng. Walking dejectedly past a shopping arcade, his heart had leapt at a busy large-print advertisement for a TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR PRIZE. But even as he slowed down, a reluctance to part with the last sixty cents in his wallet hurried him resolutely on. Reading vexation on his face at her vulgar superstition, Mrs Fang quickly retreated, leaving her sentence hanging in mid-air. Stretching out, Fang Xuanchuo decided to leave his response equally unfinished, and went back to mumbling his experimental poetry.","This suddenly reminded him of what had happened after Jin Yongsheng had sent him packing. Dejectedly passing Dao Xiang Cun he noticed an advertisement in big characters on the shop door: “First Prize Tens of Thousands of Yuan.” He had been tempted, he seemed to recall, and may have slowed down; but as if unwilling to part with the last sixty cents in his wallet, he had in the end gone resolutely on his way. His face changed colour. Mrs. Fang, supposing him annoyed by her lack of education, made haste to withdraw without having had her say out. Fang Xuanchuo, not having had his say out either, stretched and started intoning the poems in An Experimental Collection."

这一夜，就是我对于中国戏告了别的一夜，此后再没有想到他，即使偶而经过戏园，我们也漠不相关，精神上早已一在天之南一在地之北了。,"This night was the night when I said goodbye to Chinese opera, and I never thought about him again. Even if we passed by the theater occasionally, we were indifferent, and spiritually, we were already in the south of the sky and the north of the earth.","That night, I bade farewell for ever to Chinese opera. And for years, I never gave it so much as a thought, striding obliviously past the capital’s theatres as if they existed in a parallel dimension.","I said goodbye to Chinese opera that night, never thinking about it again, and if by any chance I passed a theatre it meant nothing to me for in spirit we were long since poles apart."

但他立刻转败为胜了。他擎起右手，用力的在自己脸上连打了两个嘴巴，热剌剌的有些痛，打完之后，便心平气和起来，似乎打的是自己，被打的是别一个自己，不久也就仿佛是自己打了别人一般，——虽然还有些热剌剌，——心满意足的得胜的躺下了。,"But he immediately turned defeat into victory. He raised his right hand and slapped his face hard twice in a row. It hurt a little, but after the beating, he calmed down, as if he was the one who was beaten, and the one who was beaten was another one. As if he had beaten someone else, - although it was still a little hot, - he lay down triumphantly contentedly.","And yet victory, as ever, was close at hand. His right hand soared upwards, to deliver one – two forceful slaps to the face. He then got up, his cheeks burning with pain, his good humour fully restored. Soon enough, he was perfectly convinced that he had hit someone else entirely – even though his cheeks continued to sting rather. He lay down, his heart easy with victory.","But presently he changed defeat into victory. Raising his right hand he slapped his own face hard, twice, so that it tingled with pain. After this slapping his heart felt lighter, for it seemed as if the one who had given the slap was himself, the one slapped some other self, and soon it was just as if he had beaten someone else—in spite of the fact that his face was still tingling. He lay down satisfied that he had gained the victory."

你看那女人“咬你几口”的话，和一伙青面獠牙人的笑，和前天佃户的话，明明是暗号。我看出他话中全是毒，笑中全是刀。他们的牙齿，全是白厉厉的排着，这就是吃人的家伙。,"Look at the woman's ""bite you a few bites"", the smiles of a group of green-faced fangs, and the tenant's words the day before yesterday. I could see that his words were full of poison and his smile was full of knives. Their teeth are all white and lined up, this is a man-eating guy.","That woman scolding her son – ‘I could eat you!’ – those bleached faces and bared fangs, their roars of laughter; the farmer’s story; the signs are all there.

If he hadn't informed, even his family would have been executed, and their property confiscated. But instead? Silver! That young rogue was a real scoundrel! He even tried to incite the jailer to revolt!”"
老头子很和气的问道，“你还有什么话么？”,"The old man asked kindly, ""Do you have anything else to say?""","‘Do you have anything else to say?’ the old man repeated his question, just as politely.","Very gently the old man questioned him, “Have you anything more to say?”"
“这是你的？你能叫得他答应么？你……”,"""This is yours? Can you get him to agree? You...""","‘Reckon they’re yours, do you? Do they answer if you call them? You…’",“Are these yours? Will they come when you call? You...”
“谁认便骂谁！”他站起来，两手叉在腰间说。,"""Whoever recognizes it will scold whoever!"" he said, standing up, with his hands on his waist.","‘Takes one to know one!’ He stood up, hands on hips.","“If the cap fits wear it,” he retorted, standing up and putting his hands on his hips."
那小的也检些草叶吃，然而大的似乎不许他，往往夹口的抢去了，而自己并不吃。孩子们笑得响，那小的终于吃惊了，便跳着钻进洞里去；大的也跟到洞门口，用前脚推着他的孩子的脊梁，推进之后，又爬开泥土来封了洞。,"The little one also checked some grass and leaves to eat, but the big one seemed to forbid him, and often snatched it up, but he didn't eat it himself. The children laughed loudly, and the little one was surprised at last, so he jumped into the hole; the older one followed to the door of the cave, and pushed his child's spine with his front feet. Hole.","Whenever the baby rabbit found some grass to eat, its parents would hustle over to snatch the food out of its mouth – even though they didn’t then eat it themselves. When the children laughed too loudly, the little rabbit would dart nervously back underground, its parents following on behind, pushing the baby’s rear in with their front paws, then sealing the mouth of the hole with mud.","The little rabbit also nibbled at grass and leaves, but apparently this was not allowed by his parents, who kept snatching them out of his mouth, yet didn't eat them themselves. The children laughed so uproariously that finally the little rabbit took fright and hopped back to the burrow. The bigger ones followed him to the mouth of the burrow. With their fore-paws they pushed him inside, then scraped up earth to seal up the hole."
第二，立传的通例，开首大抵该是“某，字某，某地人也”，而我并不知道阿Q姓什么。有一回，他似乎是姓赵，但第二日便模糊了。那是赵太爷的儿子进了秀才的时候，锣声镗镗的报到村里来，阿Q正喝了两碗黄酒，便手舞足蹈的说，这于他也很光采，因为他和赵太爷原来是本家，细细的排起来他还比秀才长三辈呢。其时几个旁听人倒也肃然的有些起敬了。那知道第二天，地保便叫阿Q到赵太爷家里去；太爷一见，满脸溅朱，喝道：,"Second, the general practice of Li Zhuan should probably start with ""a, the character is, a person from a certain place"", and I don't know what Ah Q's surname is. At one point, he appeared to be the last name Zhao, but the next day it was blurred. That was when Mr. Zhao's son was admitted as a scholar, and he reported to the village with the sound of gongs. Ah Q was drinking two bowls of yellow wine, and he danced and said that this was also very glorious for him, because he and Mr. Zhao were originally In this family, he is three generations older than Xiucai. At that time, several bystanders were also a little respectful. Knowing that the next day, the ground guard asked Ah Q to go to Master Zhao's house; when the master saw it, his face was covered in red, and he shouted:","Any similarity between the present work and the unforgettable Real Story of Calligraphy, by Mr Feng Wu of the Qing dynasty, is entirely unintentional. My second difficulty lies in how to start. Your average biography generally begins something like this: ‘So-and-so – whose full name was such-and-such – was born in such-and-so.’ But I have no idea what Ah-Q’s surname was. True enough, at one point it was alleged to be Zhao; but the next day, the question became fraught with uncertainty once more. The whole business reared its head, as I recall, around the time that Mr Zhao’s son had romped through the lowest, county-level stage of the civil service examination. His stomach warmed by two bowls of rice wine, his ears buzzing with the triumphant beating of gongs through the village, Ah-Q jubilantly declared to a modest audience, who smartly began to eye him with new, cautious respect, that he was a direct relation of the great Mr Zhao, and senior to the local genius by a clear three generations. The following day, the local constable summoned Ah-Q to the Zhaos’.","The second difficulty confronting me was that a biography of this type should start off something like this: “So-and-so , whose other name was so-and-so, was a native of such-and-such a place”; but I don't really know what Ah Q's surname was. Once, he seemed to be named Zhao, but the next day there was some confusion about the matter again. This was after Mr. Zhao's son had passed the county examination and, to the sound of gongs, his success was announced in the village. Ah Q, who had just drunk two bowls of yellow wine, began to prance about declaring that this reflected credit on him too, since he belonged to the same clan as Mr. Zhao and by an exact reckoning was three generations senior to the successful candidate. At the time several bystanders even began to stand slightly in awe of Ah Q. But the next day the bailiff summoned him to Mr. Zhao's house. When the old gentleman set eyes on his face turned crimson with fury and he roared:"
“有什么不相信。他们可以问去，全衙门里什么人也没有领到，都得初八！”他戟着第二个指头在帐子里的空中画了一个半圆，方太太跟着指头也看了一个半圆，只见这手便去翻开了《尝试集》。,"""Why don't you believe it? They can ask. No one in the yamen got it, so it's the eighth day!"" He drew a semi-circle in the air with his second finger, and Mrs. Fang followed her finger to look at it. After making a semicircle, I saw this hand and went to open the ""Attempt Collection"".","‘Why not? Tell them to check at the ministry – they’ll find out no one’s getting paid till the eighth.’ His finger, pursued by Mrs Fang’s eyes, described a semicircle in the air beneath the mosquito net, then returned to the experimental poetry.","“Why shouldn't they believe you? They can ask around. Nobody in the yamen will be paid until the eighth.” Under the mosquito net he sketched a semi-circle with his forefinger. Mrs. Fang saw the semi-circle, saw his hand continue leafing through the book."
他癞疮疤块块通红了，将衣服摔在地上，吐一口唾沫说：,"His leprosy scars turned red, he threw his clothes on the ground, spat out and said:",‘Hairy slug!’,All Ah Q's ringworm patches turned scarlet.
“完了？”赵太爷不觉失声的说，“那里会完得这样快呢？”,"""It's over?"" Mrs. Zhao said involuntarily, ""Will it end so quickly?""",‘Nothing?’ Mr Zhao faltered.,“Nothing left?” Mr. Zhao could not help sounding disappointed. “How could they go so quickly?”
阿Q两只手都捏住了自己的辫根，歪着头，说道：,"Ah Q grasped the roots of his braid with both hands, tilted his head, and said:","‘Or how about,’ Ah-Q would twist his head back round, trying to protect the base of his queue, ‘a slug?","Then Ah Q, clutching at the root of his queue, his head on one side, would say, “Beating an insect—how about that?"
村人们呆呆站着，心里计算，都觉得自己确乎抵不住张翼德，因此也决定七斤便要没有性命。七斤既然犯了皇法，想起他往常对人谈论城中的新闻的时候，就不该含着长烟管显出那般骄傲模样，所以对于七斤的犯法，也觉得有些畅快。他们也仿佛想发些议论，却又觉得没有什么议论可发。嗡嗡的一阵乱嚷，蚊子都撞过赤膊身子，闯到乌桕树下去做市；他们也就慢慢地走散回家，关上门去睡觉。七斤嫂咕哝着，也收了家伙和桌子矮凳回家，关上门睡觉了。,"The villagers stood there dumbfounded, calculating in their hearts, they felt that they really couldn't stand Zhang Yide, so they also decided that seven jin would kill him. Since Qijin violated the imperial law, he remembered that when he used to talk to people about the news in the city, he should not be so proud with a long cigarette pipe in his mouth, so he felt a little happy about Qijin's violation of the law. They also seem to want to make some comments, but feel that there is nothing to discuss. There was a buzzing noise, and the mosquitoes smashed through their shirtless bodies and rushed under the tallow tree to go to the market; they also slowly scattered home, closed the door and went to sleep. Sister-in-law Qijin muttered, and also took the guy and the low stool home, closed the door and went to sleep.","The villagers stood there, in stunned realization that none of them – and least of all the miserable Seven-Pounds – would stand a chance against Zhang Fei. But there was also a certain pleasure in contemplating that the village bigwig was now a fugitive from the law, as they thought back to all those times he’d smugly lectured them, pipe in mouth, on doings in the city. A village council, they felt, was in order; and yet they could think of nothing to say. After a swarm of mosquitoes whined past bare arms and chests to reconvene beneath the tallow trees, the assembled company dispersed back to their respective dwellings, shut their doors and went to sleep. Still muttering to herself, Mrs Seven-Pounds tidied away the dinner things, the table and stools, then did the same.","strode on to the one-plank bridge and swaggered off. The villagers stood there blankly, turning things over in their minds. All felt they were indeed no match for Zhang Fei, hence Sevenpounder's life was as good as lost. And since Sevenpounder had broken the imperial law he should not, they felt, have adopted that lordly air, smoking that long pipe of his, when he told them the news from town. So the thought that he had broken the law gave them a certain pleasure. They would have liked to air their views, but did not know what to say. Buzzing mosquitoes, brushing past their bare arms, zoomed back to swarm beneath the tallow trees; and the villagers too slowly scattered to their homes, shut their doors and went to bed. Grumbling to herself, Mrs. Sevenpounder also cleared away the dishes and took in the table and stools, then closed the door and went to bed."
车夫毫不理会，——或者并没有听到，——却放下车子，扶那老女人慢慢起来，搀着臂膊立定，问伊说：,"The driver paid no attention to it--or didn't hear it--but put down the car, helped the old woman to get up slowly, stood on his arms, and asked Yi:","Taking no notice – or perhaps he didn’t even hear me – the man laid down his rickshaw and helped the old woman slowly up, holding her arm as she found her feet.","He paid no attention—he may not have heard—but set down the shafts, took the old woman's arm and gently helped her up."
他便变了脸，铁一般青。睁着眼说，“有许有的，这是从来如此……”,"He changed his face, as iron as blue. He opened his eyes and said, ""There are many, this has never been the case...""","His face went a ghastly white. ‘ Maybe,’ his eyes bulged, ‘maybe that’s how things have always been…’","His expression changed. He grew ghastly pale. “It may be so,” he said staring at me."
然而我的意思却也并不在乎看翻筋斗。我最愿意看的是一个人蒙了白布，两手在头上捧着一支棒似的蛇头的蛇精，其次是套了黄布衣跳老虎。但是等了许多时都不见，小旦虽然进去了，立刻又出来了一个很老的小生。我有些疲倦了，托桂生买豆浆去。他去了一刻，回来说，“没有。卖豆浆的聋子也回去了。日里倒有，我还喝了两碗呢。现在去舀一瓢水来给你喝罢。”,"I don't mean to watch somersaults, though. What I most like to see is a snake spirit covered with a white cloth, holding a stick-like snake head on his head in both hands, followed by jumping tigers in a yellow cloth. But after waiting for a long time, he disappeared. Although Xiaodan entered, a very old Xiaosheng came out immediately. I'm a little tired, so I asked Guisheng to buy soy milk. He went for a moment, then came back and said, ""No. The deaf man who sells soy milk has also gone back. I still have two bowls of it during the day. Now go and scoop up a ladle of water for you to drink.""","But I didn’t mind about the somersaults. I was waiting for a snake demon, swathed in white cloth, brandishing a staff with a snake’s head. After that, I was looking out for a pouncing tiger, all in yellow. But my patience was not rewarded: the female lead was followed by an elderly singer impersonating a young man. Beginning to feel tired, I asked Guisheng to buy me some soybean milk. ‘There’s none left,’ he soon returned to tell me. ‘I bought two bowlfuls earlier – from a deaf pedlar. But he’s gone home now. I’ll get you a ladle of water.’","As a matter of fact, I was not too keen on somersaults either. What I wanted most to see was a snake spirit swathed in white, its two hands clasping above it a wand-like snake's head, and next a leaping tiger dressed in yellow. But I waited a long time in vain. As soon as the girl left, out came a very old man acting the part of a young one. Feeling tired, I asked Guisheng to buy me some soyabean milk. He came back presently to say, “There isn't any. The deaf man who sells it has gone. There was some in the daytime, I drank two bowls then. I'll get you a dipperful of water to drink.”"
这事到了现在，还是时时记起。我因此也时时熬了苦痛，努力的要想到我自己。几年来的文治武力，在我早如幼小时候所读过的“子曰诗云[1]”一般，背不上半句了。独有这一件小事，却总是浮在我眼前，有时反更分明，教我惭愧，催我自新，并且增长我的勇气和希望。,"Even now, I still remember it from time to time. Because of this, I also endured pain from time to time, trying to think of myself. In the past few years, the civil and military force is like the ""Zi Yue Shi Yun [1]"" I read when I was a child, and I can't recite half a sentence. This little thing is unique, but it always floats in front of my eyes, and sometimes it is more obvious, teaching me shame, urging me to reform, and increasing my courage and hope.","Even now, I often think back to that morning. It fills me with discomfort – it forces me to look hard at myself. None of our country’s recent political or military achievements has any more meaning for me than the Confucian primers that tormented my boyhood. The only thing that has stayed with me is this minor incident, clearer in my memory than it was even in reality, shaming me, urging me to change, bolstering my sense of courage and hope.","Even now, this incident keeps coming back to me. It keeps distressing me and makes me try to think about myself. The politics and the fighting of those years have slipped my mind as completely as the classics I read as a child. Yet this small incident keeps coming back to me, often more vivid than in actual life, teaching me shame, spurring me on to reform, and imbuing me with fresh courage and fresh hope."

Since the gentlemen have tried their best to climb relatives, people are in awe as if they have seen gods, deeply regret the previous frivolity, fainted, and drove away the rented house. The miscellaneous surnames in the door of my broken house—that’s because I didn’t work hard, I moved myself—the house is brand new, and the door is a flagpole and a flat forehead. If you want to be a high-ranking official, you can be a Beijing official, otherwise, it is better to seek an expatriate. ... He usually arranged a stable future, but at this time, like a damp sugar tower, it collapsed in an instant, leaving only a pile of debris. He unconsciously turned his body, which he felt disorganized, and walked towards the road home in confusion.","With the county competition behind him, he could have tried his luck at the provincial level, soaring through the ranks of government… All the best people would try to marry their daughters off to him, worshipping him like a god, regretting their earlier, short-sighted lack of respect… He would get rid of the tenants who had rented rooms in the derelict old family house – though likely as not, they would all have deferentially moved out of their own accord, to make way for him. The whole house would be made good as new, its gate embellished with a flagpole and plaque… If he preferred to work behind the scenes, away from the cut-and-thrust of local politics, a cosseted job in the capital would be his; otherwise, he could settle for a lucrative post in the provinces… Like a tower of barley sugar attacked by rain, his glorious future crumbled about him, leaving only fragments at his feet. He turned dejectedly towards home, numb with disappointment.","He had won his first degree in the county examination and taken his second in the provincial capital, success following success.... The local gentry were trying by every means to ally with him by marriage; people were treating him like a god, cursing themselves for their former contempt and blindness. The other families renting his tumble-down house had been driven away—no need for that, they would move of their own accord—and the whole place was completely renovated with flagpoles and a placard at the gate.... If he wanted to keep his hands clean he could be an official in the capital, otherwise some post in the provinces would prove more lucrative. Once more the future mapped out so carefully had crashed in ruins like a wet sugar-candy pagoda, leaving nothing but debris behind. Not knowing what he did, he turned with a strange sensation of disintegration, and shambled disconsolately home."
何小仙说了半句话，便闭上眼睛；单四嫂子也不好意思再问。在何小仙对面坐着的一个三十多岁的人，此时已经开好一张药方，指着纸角上的几个字说道：——,"He Xiaoxian closed his eyes after speaking for a while; sister-in-law Shansi was too embarrassed to ask again. A man in his thirties sitting opposite He Xiaoxian, who had already prescribed a prescription at this time, pointed to the words on the corner of the paper and said:—","His verdict delivered, Ho closed his eyes; Mrs Shan felt it would be rude to press him further. A man in his thirties, seated opposite the doctor, had already scribbled out a prescription.","Leaving this sentence unfinished, Dr. Ho closed his eyes; and Fourth Shan's Wife did not like to say any more. Opposire the doctor sat a man in his thirties, who had now finished making out the prescription.

天气还早，何家已经坐着四个病人了。他摸出四角银元，买了号签，第五个便轮到宝儿。何小仙伸开两个指头按脉，指甲足有四寸多长，单四嫂子暗地纳罕，心里计算：宝儿该有活命了。但总免不了着急，忍不住要问，便局局促促的说：——,"It was still early, and the He family had already sat with four patients. He took out four silver dollars, bought a lottery ticket, and the fifth one was Bao'er's turn. He Xiaoxian stretched out two fingers to press the pulse. The fingernails were more than four inches long. Sister-in-law Shansi secretly wondered, and calculated in her heart: Baoer should survive. But I couldn't help being anxious, I couldn't help but ask, so I said crampedly:--","Even though it was still early, the doctor already had four patients waiting for him. Four silver dollars bought Bao’er fifth place in the queue. Ho Xiaoxian uncurled two fingers – both nails a generous four inches long – and felt his pulse. Surely this man can save Bao’er, marvelled Mrs Shan to herself. ‘What’s wrong with Bao’er, doctor?’ she asked nervously.","Early as it was, there were already four patients sitting there. She produced forty silver cents for a registration slip, and Pao-erh was the fifth to be seen. Dr. Ho stretched out two fingers to feel the child's pulses.

我呢？也一样，只是元年冬天到北京，还被人骂过几次，后来骂我的人也被警察剪去了辫子，我就不再被人辱骂了；但我没有到乡间去。”,"And me? The same is true. I only went to Beijing in the winter of the first year, and I was scolded several times. Later, the people who scolded me also had their braids cut off by the police, so I was no longer scolded; but I did not go to the countryside. ""","‘And my problems weren’t over either. Even in Beijing, in the first year of the Republic, I still got heckled. Until the police cut the queues off of the people who’d given me grief.

我这时突然感到一种异样的感觉，觉得他满身灰尘的后影，刹时高大了，而且愈走愈大，须仰视才见。而且他对于我，渐渐的又几乎变成一种威压，甚而至于要榨出皮袍下面藏着的“小”来。,"At this time, I suddenly felt a strange feeling. I felt that his dusty shadow suddenly became taller and bigger, and I had to look up to see it. Moreover, he gradually became almost a kind of coercion towards me, and even wanted to squeeze out the ""little"" hidden under the leather robe.","In that brief moment, a curious sensation overtook me: his back, filthy with dust, suddenly seemed to loom taller, broader with every step he took, until I had to crick my neck back to view him in his entirety. It seemed to bear down on me, pressing out the petty selfishness concealed beneath my fur coat.","Suddenly I had the strange sensation that his dusty retreating figure had in that instant grown larger. Indeed, the further he walked the larger he loomed, until I had to look up to him.

我们也都跳上岸。阿发一面跳，一面说道，“且慢，让我来看一看罢，”他于是往来的摸了一回，直起身来说道，“偷我们的罢，我们的大得多呢。”一声答应，大家便散开在阿发家的豆田里，各摘了一大捧，抛入船舱中。双喜以为再多偷，倘给阿发的娘知道是要哭骂的，于是各人便到六一公公的田里又各偷了一大捧。,"We all jumped ashore too. As he danced, Ah Fa said, ""Wait a minute, let me take a look."" He then touched back and forth, stood up and said, ""Steal ours, ours is much bigger."" , everyone scattered in the bean field of Ah Fa's family, picked a large handful of each, and threw them into the cabin. Shuangxi thought that no matter how much they stole more, if Ah Fa's mother knew that she would cry and scold them, they each went to Father Liuyi's field and stole another big handful.","Which should we take?’ We followed him on to the bank. ‘ Hold on,’ Ah-fa replied. ‘Let me go and have a look… Take ours,’ he said, straightening up after a couple of minutes’ fieldwork. ‘They’re the biggest.’ With a shout of agreement, everyone scattered over Ah-fa’s field, tossing armfuls of pods into the boat. Ah-fa’s mother would throw a fit, Shuangxi reckoned, if we took any more. So everyone took another armful from old Mr Liu Yi’s field.","As we all jumped ashore too Afa said, “Wait a bit and I'll have a look.” He walked up and down feeling the beans, then straightened up to say, “Take ours, they're much bigger.” With a shout we scattered through his family's bean field, each picking a big handful of beans and throwing them into the boat. Shuangxi thought that if we took any more and Afa's mother found out, she would make a scene, so we all went to Old Liu Yi's field to pick another handful each."
而其实却是都错误。这不过是他的一种新不平；虽说不平，又只是他的一种安分的空论。他自己虽然不知道是因为懒，还是因为无用，总之觉得是一个不肯运动，十分安分守己的人。总长冤他有神经病，只要地位还不至于动摇，他决不开一开口；教员的薪水欠到大半年了，只要别有官俸支持，他也决不开一开口。不但不开口，当教员联合索薪的时候，他还暗地里以为欠斟酌，太嚷嚷；直到听得同寮过分的奚落他们了，这才略有些小感慨，后来一转念，这或者因为自己正缺钱，而别的官并不兼做教员的缘故罢，于是也就释然了。,"But it's actually all wrong. This is just a new kind of injustice for him; even if it is injustice, it is only a kind of quiet empty theory of his. Although he himself does not know whether it is because of laziness or because he is useless, in short, he feels that he is a person who refuses to exercise and is very self-disciplined. The chief blamed him for being insane, and as long as his status was not shaken, he would never open his mouth; the teachers were owed more than half a year's salary, and as long as there was no official salary to support him, he would never open his mouth. Not only did he not open his mouth, but when the teachers jointly demanded salary, he secretly thought that he was not careful and shouted too much. He was a little emotional until he heard Tongliao ridicule them too much. Later, he thought about it, maybe because he was short of money. , and the other officials did not also serve as teachers, so I was relieved.","They were mistaken. Fang’s ‘more-or-lessism’ was nothing more than an expression of a new sense of grievance against the world – though not one that he had the least intention of acting on. Whether it was because he was lazy, or just utterly inert – even he didn’t know – Fang Xuanchuo had always considered himself a stoically law-abiding sort of person, the kind that refuses to take part in any kind of public protest. While his own position in the bureaucratic cosmology was not under threat, his minister could accuse him of every neurosis under the sun and still the system wouldn’t hear a whisper of dissent from him. The university could owe him more than six months’ salary, but as long as his income from his government job kept coming, he would keep his head resolutely down. And when his university colleagues banded together to demand payment of their salaries, he would – keeping his views strictly to himself, of course – think them stridently importunate. He would come to their defence (and weakly at that) only when he heard colleagues in government sniping at them. Or perhaps because he was experiencing cash-flow problems at the time, and he was the only one among them who moonlighted between academic and government service – yes, he concluded, that sounded reasonable enough, and thought no more about it.","In fact, all of them were wrong. This was simply a new sense of injustice he had. Even so, it was just empty, law-abiding talk. Although not knowing himself whether owing to indolence, or because it was useless, at all events he refused to take part in movements and regarded himself as thoroughly law-abiding. Accused by his superiors of being psychopathic, as long as this did not affect his position, he never protested. When his school salary was more than half a year in arrears, so long as he had his official pay to live on, he never protested either. He not only kept his mouth shut, when the teachers banded together to demand payment, he privately considered this imprudent and too vociferous; only when his colleagues ran them down too harshly did he feel slightly disturbed; but then it occurred to him that this might be because he himself was hard up and the other officials did not hold teaching posts, and so he overlooked it."
七斤和他的女人没有读过书，不很懂得这古典的奥妙，但觉得有学问的七爷这么说，事情自然非常重大，无可挽回，便仿佛受了死刑宣告似的，耳朵里嗡的一声，再也说不出一句话。,"Qi Jin and his wife had never read books, so they didn't understand the mystery of this classic very well, but they felt that the learned Qi Ye said this, the matter was naturally very important and irreversible, and it was as if they had been sentenced to death, and their ears buzzed. , without saying a word.","As neither Seven-Pounds nor his wife had been to school, the profundity of this historical allusion floated some way over their heads. But they could see that if a man of Mr Zhao’s wisdom was talking like this, then the situation was serious indeed; beyond salvation, in fact. They fell silent, listening to their death knells clanging in their ears.","Sevenpounder and his wife had never read any books, so this classical lore was lost on them; but this statement from a learned man like Seventh Master convinced them that the situation must be desperate, past saving. It was as if they had received their death sentence. Their ears buzzed, and they were unable to utter another word."
阿Q将手向头上一遮，不自觉的逃出门外；洋先生倒也没有追。他快跑了六十多步，这才慢慢的走，于是心里便涌起了忧愁：洋先生不准他革命，他再没有别的路。从此决不能望有白盔白甲的人来叫他，他所有的抱负，志向，希望，前程，全被一笔勾销了。至于闲人们传扬开去，给小D王胡等辈笑话，倒是还在其次的事。,"Ah Q covered his head with his hands and ran out of the door unconsciously; Mr. Yang did not chase.

From now on, he must never be called by someone with a white helmet and white armor. All his ambitions, aspirations, hopes, and future prospects have all been wiped out.

After sprinting sixty paces, he slowed to a walk. A sense of the tragedy of it all welled up in him: if Mr Foreigner was set on keeping him out of the Revolution, he had no other path open to him. The men in white would never come for him; all his ambitions, aspirations, hopes for the future written off at a single stroke. Then there was the fear that those loafers at the Qians’ might tell everyone else in the village, making him a laughing stock in front of the pathetic D and hairy Wang; though that was of secondary concern.","Ah Q put up his hands to protect his head, and without knowing what he was doing fled through the gate; but this time Mr. Foreigner did not give chase. After running more than sixty steps Ah Q slowed down, and now his heart filled with dismay, because if Mr. Foreigner would not allow him to be a revolutionary, there was no other way open to him. In future he could never hope to have men in white helmets and white armour come to call him. All his ambitions, aims, hope and future had been blasted at one fell swoop. The fact that gossips might spread the news and make him a laughing-stock for the likes of Young D and Whiskers Wang was only a secondary consideration."
第八章,chapter eight,CHAPTER 8,Chapter 8
有一天，大约是中秋前的两三天，掌柜正在慢慢的结账，取下粉板，忽然说，“孔乙己长久没有来了。还欠十九个钱呢！”我才也觉得他的确长久没有来了。一个喝酒的人说道，“他怎么会来？……他打折了腿了。”掌柜说，“哦！”“他总仍旧是偷。这一回，是自己发昏，竟偷到丁举人家里去了。他家的东西，偷得的么？”“后来怎么样？”“怎么样？先写服辩[6]，后来是打，打了大半夜，再打折了腿。”“后来呢？”“后来打折了腿了。”“打折了怎样呢？”“怎样？……谁晓得？许是死了。”掌柜也不再问，仍然慢慢的算他的账。,"One day, about two or three days before the Mid-Autumn Festival, the shopkeeper was slowly checking out, took off the powder board, and suddenly said, ""Kong Yiji hasn't come for a long time. I still owe nineteen dollars!"" I also felt that he really did Haven't come for a long time. A drinker said, ""How could he come?...He broke his leg."" The shopkeeper said, ""Oh!"" ""He still steals. This time, he was unconscious and stole to Ding Juren's house. Did you steal anything from his house?"" ""What happened after that?"" ""How about it? First, I wrote a defense[6], and then I beat him. I beat him in the middle of the night, and then I lost my leg."" ""And then? ""Later, the leg was discounted."" ""What about the discount?"" ""What? ... Who knows? Maybe he's dead.""","‘I haven’t seen Kong Yiji for ages,’ the manager pronounced one day, probably a little before the Mid-Autumn Festival, as he took down the slate to work slowly through the accounts. ‘He still owes me nineteen coppers!’ It now dawned on me, too, that we had long been deprived of the pleasure of Kong Yiji’s company. ‘How d’you expect him to drag himself over here?’ one customer said. ‘He’s had his legs broken.’ ‘Oh?’ ‘He was stealing, as usual. But he must have been out of his mind to try it on with Mr Ding, the magistrate. Just asking for trouble.’ ‘So what happened?’ ‘First they got a confession out of him, then they beat the hell out of him and broke his legs. Past midnight it went on.’ ‘Then what happened?’ ‘Well, his legs were broken.’ ‘I mean after that.’ ‘Oh… Who knows? Maybe he’s dead.’ No further questions; the manager went slowly back to his accounts.","One day, shortly before the Mid-Autumn Festival I think it was, my boss who was slowly making out his accounts took down the tally-board. “Kong Yiji hasn't shown up for a long time,” he remarked suddenly. “He still owes nineteen coppers.” That made me realize how long it was since we had seen him. “How could he?” rejoined one of the customers. “His legs were broken in that last beating up.” “Ah!” said my boss. “He'd been stealing again. This time he was fool enough to steal from Mr. Ding, the provincial-grade scholar. As if anybody could get away with that!” “So what happened?” “What happened? First he wrote a confession, then he was beaten. The beating lasted nearly all night, and they broke both his legs.” “And then?” “Well, his legs were broken.” “Yes, but after?” “After?... Who knows? He may be dead.”"
况且黑猫害了小兔，我更是“师出有名”的了。我觉得母亲实在太修善，于是不由的就说出模棱的近乎不以为然的答话来。,"Besides, the black cat killed the little rabbit, and I am even more famous for being a teacher. I felt that my mother was too good-natured, so I couldn't help but give vague and almost disapproving answers.","After the black cat killed the little rabbits, I felt more justified than ever in my hatred. Mother, I felt, was far too soft on them – which is why I allowed an edge of impatience into my reply.","Besides, since the black cat had killed the little rabbits, I had a more righteous cause for which to fight. Mother, I felt, was really too soft-hearted. That was why I made such an evasive, almost disapproving, answer."
老栓听得儿子不再说话，料他安心睡了；便出了门，走到街上。街上黑沉沉的一无所有，只有一条灰白的路，看得分明。灯光照着他的两脚，一前一后的走。有时也遇到几只狗，可是一只也没有叫。天气比屋子里冷得多了；老栓倒觉爽快，仿佛一旦变了少年，得了神通，有给人生命的本领似的，跨步格外高远。而且路也愈走愈分明，天也愈走愈亮了。,"When Lao Shuan heard that his son stopped talking, he expected him to sleep peacefully; he went out and walked into the street. The street was dark and nothing but a grey and white road, clearly visible. The lights shone on his feet, walking in tandem. Sometimes I met several dogs, but none of them barked. The weather was much colder than in the house; Lao Shuan felt refreshed, as if he had acquired supernatural powers and the ability to give life once he had changed into a teenager, his strides were extraordinarily high. And the road is getting clearer and clearer, and the sky is getting brighter and brighter.","Guessing from his son’s silence that he had fallen back into a deep sleep, Shuan opened the door. Outside, the street was sunk in a heavy darkness that obscured everything except the ashen road before him. The lantern cast its light over his feet, illuminating their progress – one step after another. The occasional dog silently crossed his path. The air was much colder outside, but Shuan found the change in temperature refreshing: he felt like a young man again, striding further and faster, as if invigorated by a new life-force. The outlines of the road grew clearer as he walked, the sky brighter.","Receiving no answer, Old Shuan assumed his son must be sound asleep again; so he went out into the street. In the darkness nothing could be seen but the grey roadway. The lantern light fell on his pacing feet. Here and there he came across dogs, but none of them barked. It was much colder than indoors, yet Old Shuan's spirits rose, as if he had grown suddenly younger and possessed some miraculous life-giving power. He had lengthened his stride. And the road became increasingly clear, the sky increasingly bright."

母亲对我说，那样麻烦的养兔法，伊历来连听也未曾听到过，恐怕是可以收入《无双谱》[2]的。,"My mother told me that Yi has never heard of such a troublesome method of raising rabbits, and I am afraid that it can be included in the ""Wu Shuang Pu""[2].","She’d never heard of anyone going to such extraordinary lengths to raise rabbits, Mother remarked; they’d broken the mould when they made her daughter-in-law, truly they had.",It deserved to be included in the Register of Eccentrics.
阿Q想在心里，后来每每说出口来，所以凡有和阿Q玩笑的人们，几乎全知道他有这一种精神上的胜利法，此后每逢揪住他黄辫子的时候，人就先一着对他说：,"Ah Q thought about it in his heart, and after that, he often said it out, so everyone who joked with Ah Q almost knew that he had this kind of spiritual victory method. and said to him:","In time, whenever something like this happened, Ah-Q began to say out loud what at first he had only thought. In this way, Ah-Q’s tormentors learnt of his habit of declaring moral victory over the ashes of defeat, and added their own revisions while yanking on his queue.","Whatever Ah Q thought he was sure to tell people later; thus almost all who made fun of Ah Q knew that he had this means of winning a psychological victory. So after this anyone who pulled or twisted his brown queue would forestall him by saying, “Ah Q, this is not a son beating his father, it is a man beating a beast. Let's hear you say it:"
他戴上帽子说：,He put on his hat and said:,"‘Goodbye!’ he said, as he put his hat on.","As he put on his hat he said, “So long!"

他两颊都鼓起来了，仿佛气恼这答案正和他的议论“差不多”，近乎随声附和模样；接着便将头转向别一面去了，依据习惯法，这是宣告讨论中止的表示。,"His cheeks were puffed up, as if annoyed that the answer was ""similarly"" to his argument, almost in agreement; then he turned his head away, which, according to customary law, was a sign of an end to the discussion.","His cheeks bulged sullenly: was she regurgitating his ‘more-or-lessism’ back at him? He turned away, indicating – according to long-established marital code – the discussion was at an end.","He puffed out his cheeks, as if angry because this answer was “much of a muchness” with what he had said, practically echoing it. Then he turned his head aside, this being his customary way to terminate a discussion."
大堂的情形都照旧，上面仍然坐着光头的老头子，阿Q也仍然下了跪。,"The situation in the lobby remained the same, with the bald old man still sitting on it, and Ah Q still knelt down.","Everything was as it had been the previous day: the bald old man at the back, Ah-Q on his knees.","Everything was unchanged in the big hall. The old man with the cleanshaven head was still sitting there, and Ah Q knelt down again as before."
从此小院子里更热闹，窗口也时时有人窥探了。,"Since then, the small yard has become more lively, and the window has been spied on from time to time.","There were always people around the courtyard, or stationed at the back window, observing the comings and goings.","After that the little yard was livelier, there were often people at the window watching."

从此卖小鸡的乡下人也时常来，来一回便买几只，因为小鸡是容易积食，发痧，很难得长寿的；而且有一匹还成了爱罗先珂君在北京所作唯一的小说《小鸡的悲剧》[3]里的主人公。有一天的上午，那乡下人竟意外的带了小鸭来了，咻咻的叫着；但是仲密夫人说不要。爱罗先珂君也跑出来，他们就放一个在他两手里，而小鸭便在他两手里咻咻的叫。他以为这也很可爱，于是又不能不买了，一共买了四个，每个八十文。,"From then on, countrymen who sold chickens often came here and bought a few chickens, because chickens are easy to accumulate food, develop sha, and rarely live a long life; and one of them became the only novel written by Ai Luo Xianke in Beijing. The protagonist in The Tragedy of the Chicken [3]. One morning, the countryman unexpectedly brought the duckling, wailing; but Mrs. Zhongmi said no. Lord Erosenke also ran out, and they put one in his hands, and the duckling croaked in both his hands. He thought it was cute too, so he had to buy it again. He bought four in total, each for eighty cents.","The household would often get visits from a farmer selling chicks, and would usually buy a few. Because chicks have delicate stomachs and easily fall ill, very few reached maturity; one of them, indeed, became the hero of the only story that Eroshenko wrote in Beijing – ‘The Chick’s Tragedy’. One morning, the farmer brought along a gaggle of noisy ducklings. Just as Zuoren’s wife was sending him away, Eroshenko rushed out to investigate. Captivated by the cheeping creature the farmer released into his hands, he immediately bought four of them, for eighty coppers apiece.","After that, the countryman selling chicks often called, and each time they bought a few, because chicks are prone to forage for themselves and fall ill—they are seldom very long-lived. One of them, moreover, became the central figure in The Tragedy of the Chicks, the only story Eroshenko wrote in Beijing. One morning, unexpectedly, the countryman brought along some cheeping ducklings, but Mrs. Zhong Mi said she did not want them. Eroshenko hurried out too. They put a duckling in his hands, and it cheeped as he held it. He thought the little creature so lovable, he felt he had to buy it. He bought four in all, for eighty cash apiece."
阿Q一想，没有话，便回答说，“没有。”,"After thinking about it, Ah Q had nothing to say, so he replied, ""No.""",Ah-Q gave the question some thought: ‘No.’,"Ah Q thought, and decided there was nothing to say, so he answered, “Nothing.”"

但第二日，邹七嫂便将那蓝裙去染了皂，又将阿Q可疑之点传扬出去了，可是确没有提起秀才要驱逐他这一节。然而这已经于阿Q很不利。最先，地保寻上门了，取了他的门幕去，阿Q说是赵太太要看的，而地保也不还，并且要议定每月的孝敬钱。其次，是村人对于他的敬畏忽而变相了，虽然还不敢来放肆，却很有远避的神情，而这神情和先前的防他来“嚓”的时候又不同，颇混着“敬而远之”的分子了。,"But on the second day, Sister Zou Qi dyed the blue dress with soap, and spread the suspicious point of Ah Q, but did not mention the fact that Xiu Cai wanted to expel him. However, this was already very unfavorable for Ah Q. First of all, the local security guard came to the door and took his curtain. Ah Q said that Mrs. Zhao wanted to see it, but the local security guard did not pay it back, and he had to negotiate a monthly payment for filial piety. Secondly, the villagers' reverence for him has suddenly changed in disguise. Although they still don't dare to be arrogant, they have a look of avoiding them. This look is different from the previous ""cha"" when preventing him from coming. It is quite mixed with ""respect and stay away"". molecules.","But when she took her skirt to be dyed black the following day, Mrs Zou spread the word concerning the suspicions about Ah-Q’s character. Even though she made no direct mention of the village genius’s idea, the damage to Ah-Q’s reputation was done. First of all, the constable called on him to confiscate his door curtain, refusing to return it even when Ah-Q told him Mrs Zhao wanted to look at it, then demanding a monthly offering from him to demonstrate his respect for the agent of the law. Second, the villagers’ attitude towards him underwent an abrupt change: although they still did not dare provoke him as they once had, although the dread generated by his execution monologue had faded, they gave him a wide berth – kept a respectful distance, you might say.","The next day, however, when Mrs. Zou took her blue skirt to be dyed black she repeated these insinuations about Ah Q, although not actually mentioning what the successful candidate had said about driving him away. Even so, it was most damaging to Ah Q. In the first place, the bailiff appeared at his door and took away the door curtain. Although Ah Q protested that Mrs. Zhao wanted to see it, the bailiff would not give it back and even demanded monthly hush money. In the second place, the villagers' respect for Ah Q suddenly changed. Although they still dared not take liberties, from their previous fear of his “Off with his head!” it closely resembled the attitude of the ancients to spirits: they kept a respectful distance. Some idlers who wanted to get to the bottom of the business went to question Ah Q carefully."
少奶奶正拖着吴妈走出下房来，一面说：,The young mistress was dragging Wu Ma out of the room and said:,"Although dusk had fallen, he could still make out many of the assembled company – all the resident members of the Zhao clan, including the hunger-striking lady of the house, Mrs Zou from next door, and a couple of slightly more distant relatives, Zhao Baiyan and Zhao Sichen.","The young mistress was leadinng Amah Wu out of the servants'quarters, saying as she did so:"
他在街上走，人也看他，然而不说什么话，阿Q当初很不快，后来便很不平。他近来很容易闹脾气了；其实他的生活，倒也并不比造反之前反艰难，人见他也客气，店铺也不说要现钱，而阿Q总觉得自己太失意：既然革了命，不应该只是这样的。况且有一回看见小D，愈使他气破肚皮了。,"As he walked on the street, people looked at him, but he didn't say anything. Ah Q was very upset at first, but later became very upset. He has been prone to getting angry recently; in fact, his life is not as difficult as it was before the rebellion. People are polite when they see him, and the shop doesn't ask for cash, and Ah Q always feels that he is too frustrated: since the revolution is complete, no It should just be like this. Besides, seeing Xiao D once made him even more angry.","As he walked along, he attracted a few looks, but no comment. Soon, a feeling of niggling displeasure had evolved into a sense of serious grievance against the world at large. Lately, he had been suffering more and more from dyspepsia of the brain. His life at present was no more difficult than it had been before the Revolution: people were still tolerably civil to him, and shopkeepers never asked him to pay in cash. But Ah-Q was nagged by a sense of frustration: that things should be different, now there had been a revolution. It was his sighting, one day, of the ignoble D that brought his bad mood to boiling point.","As he walked along the street people looked at him, but without any comment. Ah Q, disgruntled at first, soon waxed indignant. Recently he had been losing his temper, very easily. As a matter of fact he was no worse off than before the revolution, people treated him politely, and the shops no longer demanded payment in cash, yet Ah Q still felt dissatisfied. A revolution, he thought, should mean more than this. When he saw Young D, his anger boiled over."

“我本来要……来投……”阿Q胡里胡涂的想了一通，这才断断续续的说。,"""I was going to... come to vote..."" Ah Q thought for a while and then said intermittently.","‘All I wanted to do was… to… surrender…’ Ah-Q mumbled haltingly, after a pause for confused thought.",“The fact is I wanted... to join...” muttered Ah Q disjointedly after a moment's confused thinking.
母亲想也知道；不过哭的时候，却并没有说明，大约也以为应当的了。记得我四五岁时，坐在堂前乘凉，大哥说爷娘生病，做儿子的须割下一片肉来，煮熟了请他吃，[9]才算好人；母亲也没有说不行。一片吃得，整个的自然也吃得。但是那天的哭法，现在想起来，实在还教人伤心，这真是奇极的事！,"The mother thought and knew; but when she cried, she didn't explain it, and she probably thought it was right. I remember when I was four or five years old, when I was sitting in front of the hall enjoying the shade, my elder brother said that my father and mother were sick, so the son had to cut off a piece of meat, cook it and invite him to eat. You can eat a piece, and you can eat the whole. But the way of crying that day, when I think about it now, it really makes people sad. This is really a strange thing!","I think she must have known, even though she didn’t say a word about it as she wept – maybe she just accepted it. When I was three or four, I remember my brother telling me, as I sat in the courtyard enjoying the cool of a summer evening, that a filial son should cook a piece of his flesh for a sick parent. Mother said nothing to contradict him. If it’s all right to eat a piece of flesh, then why not a whole person? But the way she wept that day; the memory of it, even now, is painful. How inconsistent people are!","I think Mother must have known, but when she wept she didn't say so outright, probably because she also thought it proper. I remember when I was four or five, sitting in the cool of the hall, my brother told me that if a man's parents were ill he should cut off a piece of his flesh and boil it for them, if he wanted to be considered a good son; and Mother didn't contradict him. If one piece could be eaten, obviously so could the whole. And yet just to think of the weeping then still makes my heart bleed; that is the extraordinary thing about it!"

没有多久，又见几个兵，在那边走动；衣服前后的一个大白圆圈，远地里也看得清楚，走过面前的，并且看出号衣[2]上暗红的镶边。——一阵脚步声响，一眨眼，已经拥过了一大簇人。那三三两两的人，也忽然合作一堆，潮一般向前赶；将到丁字街口，便突然立住，簇成一个半圆。,"After a while, several soldiers were seen walking there; a large white circle on the front and back of the clothes could be seen clearly from a distance, and when they walked past, they could see the dark red trim on the livery [2]. ——There was a sound of footsteps, and in the blink of an eye, a large group of people had already been embraced. The people in twos and threes suddenly cooperated in a group, rushing forward like a tide; when they were about to reach the intersection of the T-shaped street, they suddenly stood up and clustered into a semicircle.","Shortly after, he saw a few soldiers march towards and then past him, the large white circle on their chests and backs clearly visible even from a distance. As they passed him, he noted the dark red border on their uniforms. Then a rush of footsteps: the crowd surged forward, its units of twos and threes suddenly coalescing into a tremendous mass that pulled up and fanned out into a semicircle just before the junction.","Presently he saw some soldiers strolling around. The large white circles on their uniforms, both in front and behind, were clear even at a distance; and as they drew nearer, the dark red border could be seen too. The next second, with a trampling of feet, a crowd rushed past. Thereupon the small groups which had arrived earlier suddenly converged and surged forward. Just before the crossroad, they came to a sudden stop and grouped themselves in a semi-circle."
这谦逊反使阿Q更加愤怒起来，但他手里没有钢鞭，于是只得扑上去，伸手去拔小D的辫子，小D一手护住了自己的辫根，一手也来拔阿Q的辫子，阿Q便也将空着的一只手护住了自己的辫根。从先前的阿Q看来，小D本来是不足齿数的，但他近来挨了饿，又瘦又乏已经不下于小D，所以便成了势均力敌的现象，四只手拔着两颗头，都弯了腰，在钱家粉墙上映出一个蓝色的虹形，至于半点钟之久了。,"This humility made Ah Q even more angry, but he didn't have a steel whip in his hand, so he had to pounce on it and stretched out Xiao D's braid. Xiao D protected the root of his braid with one hand and pulled Ah Q's braid with the other. , Ah Q also covered the root of his braid with his free hand. From the previous Ah Q's point of view, Xiao D was originally short of teeth, but he has been starving recently, and he is no less thin and lackluster than Xiao D, so he has become an evenly matched phenomenon, with four hands pulling two heads, They all bent down, and a blue rainbow shape was projected on the pink wall of Qian's house. As for half an hour.","Forced to improvise in the absence of a mace, he rushed forward to grab hold of D’s queue. His opponent left one hand protecting the base of the pigtail, while attacking Ah-Q’s own queue with his other. Although the old Ah-Q would not have been given an instant’s pause by the pathetic D, the recent hard times on which he had fallen had reduced him to a comparable physical state. Now pretty much a match for each other, for a good half-hour they remained locked in struggle, one hand on their own, the other assaulting the other’s queue , backs curved into a blue arch against the whitewashed front wall of the Qian household. ‘All right!","Such modesty only enraged Ah Q even more, but since he had no steel mace in his hand all he could do was to rush forward to grab at Young D's queue. Young D, protecting his own queue with one hand, grabbed at Ah Q's with the other, whereupon Ah Q also used his free hand to protect his own queue. In the past Ah Q had never considered Young D worth taking seriously, but owing to his recent privations he was now as thin and weak as his opponent, so that they presented a spectacle of evenly matched antagonists, four hands clutching at two heads, both men bending at the waist, casting a blue, rainbow-shaped shadow on the Qian family's white wall for over half an hour. “All right!"

他不知道谁和谁为什么打起架来了。骂声打声脚步声，昏头昏脑的一大阵，他才爬起来，赌摊不见了，人们也不见了，身上有几处很似乎有些痛，似乎也挨了几拳几脚似的，几个人诧异的对他看。他如有所失的走进土谷祠，定一定神，知道他的一堆洋钱不见了。赶赛会的赌摊多不是本村人，还到那里去寻根柢呢？,"He didn't know who and who got into a fight. The sound of scolding and footsteps made him feel dizzy for a long time before he got up. The gambling booth was gone, and so were the people. There seemed to be pain in several places on his body, and it seemed that he had been punched and kicked a few times. Looking at him in surprise. If he walked into the Tugu Temple with a loss, he was sure that he knew that his pile of foreign money was gone. Most of the gambling booths in the game are not from the village, so why go there to find their roots?","He didn’t know who started the fighting, or why. The sounds of cursing, of blows, of footsteps blurred into a single confused roar; and when finally he clambered to his feet, stalls and gamblers had disappeared. His body seemed to hurt in various places, as if it had been hit or kicked, and people were looking curiously at him. After taking himself back, rather nonplussed, to the Temple of Earth and Grain, he recovered his wits sufficiently to discover his pile of money was gone. How was he to get to the bottom of it? Most of the gamblers that night had come from outside the village.","He never knew who started the fight, nor for what reason. Curses, blows and footsteps formed a confused medley of sound in his head, and by the time he clambered to his feet the gambling tables had vanished and so had the gamblers. Several parts of his body seemed to be aching as if he had been kicked and knocked about, while a number of people were looking at him in astonishment. Feeling as if something were amiss he walked back to the Tutelary God's Temple, and by the time he had calmed down again he realized that his pile of dollars had gone. Since most of the people who ran gambling tables at the Festival were not natives of Weizhuang, where could he look for the culprits?"

陈士成似乎记得白天在街上也曾听得有人说这种话，他不待再听完，已经恍然大悟了。他突然仰面向天，月亮已向西高峰这方面隐去，远想离城三十五里的西高峰正在眼前，朝笏[3]一般黑魆魆的挺立着，周围便放出浩大闪烁的白光来。,"Chen Shicheng seemed to remember that he had heard someone say this kind of thing on the street during the day. He suddenly turned his head to the sky, the moon had already disappeared towards the west peak, and he thought that the west peak thirty-five miles away from the city was in front of him.","Had he heard something like this once before? He did not need to be told again; the path forward was clear. Looking up, he saw the moon was now slanting towards the west. The western hill, some dozen miles from the town, now loomed darkly before his eyes, bathed in a glittering white light.","Chen Shicheng had a faint recollection of hearing this remark in the street that day, and at once light dawned on him. He threw back his head to look up at the sky. The moon was hiding itself behind West Peak, so that the peak a dozen miles from the town seemed immediately before him, upright, black, and awesome as the tablet carried by ministers to court, while from it pulsed great flickering beams of white light."
去了这心思，放心做事走路吃饭睡觉，何等舒服。这只是一条门槛，一个关头。他们可是父子兄弟夫妇朋友师生仇敌和各不相识的人，都结成一伙，互相劝勉，互相牵掣，死也不肯跨过这一步。,"Go to this mind, rest assured to do things, walk, eat, sleep, how comfortable. This is just a threshold, a juncture. They are fathers, sons, brothers, couples, friends, teachers, students, enemies, and strangers. They all form a group, exhorting each other and holding each other down.","If only they could leave it all behind them, how easy, how comfortable their lives would become. Such a tiny thing. But they are all part of it – fathers, sons, brothers, husbands, wives, friends, teachers, pupils, enemies, perfect strangers, pulling each other back.","How comfortable life would be for them if they could rid themselves of such obsessions and go to work, walk, eat and sleep at ease.

Shuangxi said that that is the famous old iron-headed student, who can turn eighty-four somersaults in a row, and he has personally counted it in the past few days.","As we hurriedly moored, we saw a spear-wielding man with a long black beard, and four banners stuck to his back, fighting with a troupe of bare-chested men. This, Shuangxi told me, was the celebrated acrobat Iron-Head. He could turn eighty-four somersaults in a row – Shuangxi had counted them for himself earlier in the day.","While we hastily moored, there appeared on the stage a man with a long black beard and four pennons fixed to his back. With a spear he fought a whole group of bare-armed men. Shuangxi told us this was a famous acrobat who could turn eighty-four somersaults one after the other. He had counted for himself earlier in the day."
我想到希望，忽然害怕起来了。闰土要香炉和烛台的时候，我暗地里笑他，以为他总是崇拜偶像，什么时候都不忘却。现在我所谓希望，不也是我自己手制的偶像么？只是他的愿望切近，我的愿望茫远罢了。,"I thought of hope and suddenly became afraid. When Runtu asked for a censer and a candlestick, I secretly laughed at him, thinking that he always worshipped idols and would never forget them. Now my so-called hope, isn't it also an idol made by myself? It's just that his wish is close, and mine is far away.","The instant my thoughts turned to hope , I grew fearful. When I saw Runtu take the incense-burner and candlesticks, I had secretly smiled at his worship of idols. But wasn’t my own weakness for hope an idol of my own making? His wishes were immediately material, while mine were distantly vague; that was the only difference between us.","The access of hope made me suddenly afraid. When Runtu had asked for the incense-burner and candlesticks I had laughed up my sleeve at him, to think that he was still worshipping idols and would never put them out of his mind. Yet what I now called hope was no more than an idol I had created myself. The only difference was that what he desired was close at hand, while what I desired was less easily realized."
“这给谁治病的呀？”老栓也似乎听得有人问他，但他并不答应；他的精神，现在只在一个包上，仿佛抱着一个十世单传的婴儿，别的事情，都已置之度外了。他现在要将这包里的新的生命，移植到他家里，收获许多幸福。太阳也出来了；在他面前，显出一条大道，直到他家中，后面也照见丁字街头破匾上“古□亭口”这四个黯淡的金字。,"""Who is this for?"" Lao Shuan also seemed to hear someone ask him, but he didn't agree; his spirit is now only on a bag, as if he was holding a ten-generation single-handed baby, and other things , have been set aside. He is now going to transplant the new life in this bag into his home and reap a lot of happiness. The sun also came out; in front of him, there appeared an avenue that led to his house, and behind him also saw the four dim gold characters ""Gu □ Ting Kou"" on the broken plaque on the T-shaped street.","‘Who’s that for – who’s ill?’ Shuan vaguely heard someone ask. Whoever it was, he ignored them. His mind was now focused on one object alone, as if he held in his hands the single heir to an ancient house; all else was shut out. His only thought was to place this elixir inside his son, and enjoy its blessings. The sun was now fully risen, painting in light the road home, and the faded gold characters of a battered old plaque at the junction behind: ‘Crossing of the Ancient — Pavilion’.","“Whose sickness is this for?” Old Shuan seemed to hear someone ask; but he made no reply. His whole mind was on the package, which he carried as carefully as if it were the sole heir to an ancient house. Nothing else mattered now. He was about to transplant this new life to his own home, and reap much happiness. The sun too had risen; lighting up the broad highway before him, which led straight home, and the worn tablet behind him at the crossroad with its faded gold inscription: “Ancient Pavilion.”"
