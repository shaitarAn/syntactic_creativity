"他的笔立刻停滞了；他仰了头，两眼瞪着房顶，正在安排那安置这""幸福的家庭""的地方。他想：""北京？不行，死气沉沉，连空气也是死的。假如在这家庭的周围筑一道高墙，难道空气也就隔断了么？简直不行！江苏浙江天天防要开仗；福建更无须说。四川，广东？都正在打。山东河南之类？——阿阿，要绑票的，倘使绑去一个，那就成为不幸的家庭了。上海天津的租界上房租贵；……假如在外国，笑话。云南贵州不知道怎样，但交通也太不便……。""他想来想去，想不出好地方，便要假定为A了，但又想，""现有不少的人是反对用西洋字母来代人地名的，说是要减少读者的兴味。我这回的投稿，似乎也不如不用，安全些。那么，在那里好呢？——湖南也打仗；大连仍然房租贵；察哈尔，吉林，黑龙江罢，——听说有马贼，也不行！……""他又想来想去，又想不出好地方，于是终于决心，假定这""幸福的家庭""所在的地方叫作A。","Immediately his pen stopped; he looked up and stared at the roof, making arrangements for the place where the ""happy family"" would be placed. He thought: ""Beijing? No, it's dead, and even the air is dead. If you build a high wall around this family, wouldn't the air be cut off? It's impossible! Jiangsu and Zhejiang are going to fight every day; not to mention Fujian. Sichuan, Guangdong? They are all fighting. Shandong, Henan, etc.?——Aah, if one is kidnapped, it will become an unfortunate family. The rent in the concession of Shanghai and Tianjin is expensive;...If it is in a foreign country, it is a joke I don't know what to do in Yunnan and Guizhou, but the traffic is too inconvenient..."" He thought about it and couldn't think of a good place, so he had to assume it was A, but he thought, ""There are many people who are against the use of Western alphabets. The name of the place to be replaced is said to reduce the interest of readers. It seems that my contribution this time is not as safe as it is. So, where is better? - Hunan is also fighting; Dalian is still expensive; Chahar, Jilin, Heilongjiang, -- I heard that there are horse thieves, but it's not good!..."" He thought about it again and again, but couldn't think of a good place, so he finally decided to assume that the place where this ""happy family"" was located was called A.","He immediately stalled and stared up at the ceiling, considering where to place this happy family of his. ‘Beijing?’ he wondered. ‘No. It’s a morgue of a city – even the air smells dead. I suppose I could put them in a high-walled compound… but the air might still get in over the top. No… Jiangsu and Zhejiang are too unstable; Fujian’s even worse. There’s already fighting in Sichuan and Guangdong. Shandong, then, or Henan? Too many bandits. Someone’s bound to get kidnapped – and there goes my happy family. The foreign concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin are too expensive… I can’t have them live abroad, ridiculous idea. All I know about Yunnan and Guizhou is there’s no decent transport there…’ And on he went, unable to think of a suitable setting. He contemplated inventing somewhere and calling it A—: ‘Too risky. They say readers don’t like you using Roman letters to stand in for names any more. Best not chance it. But where am I going to put them? There’s fighting in Hunan, too, rents are too high in Dalian, yet more bandits in the north-east…’ On he went, frustrated by the search for a place, until he settled, eventually, back on ‘A—’. ‘Fine, A— it is. Now, back to the family itself: a husband and wife – a love match, naturally.","His pen immediately came to a standstill. He raised his head, fixed his two eyes on the ceiling, and tried to decide on an environment for this Happy Family. ""Peking?"" he thought. ""That won't do; it's too dead, even the atmosphere is dead. Even if a high wall were built round this family, still the air could scarcely be kept separate. No, that would never do! Kiangsu and Chekiang may start fighting any day, and Fukien is even more out of the question. Szechuan? Kwangtung? They are in the midst of fighting.2 What about Shantung or Honan? . . . No, one of them might be kidnapped, and if that happened the happy family would become an unhappy one. The rents in the foreign concessions in Shanghai and Tientsin are too high. . . . Somewhere abroad? Ridiculous. I don't know what Yunnan and Kweichow are like, but communications are too poor. . . ."" He racked his brains but, unable to think of a good place, decided tentatively to fix on A——. Then, however, he thought: ""Nowadays many people object to the use of the Western alphabet to represent the names of people and places, saying it lessens the readers' interest. Probably, to be on the safe side, I had better not use it in my story this time. In that case what would be a good place? There is fighting in Hunan too; the rents in Dairen have gone up again. In Chahar, Kirin and Heilungkiang I have heard there are brigands, so they won't do either! . . ."" Again he racked his brains to think of a good place, but in vain; so finally he made up his mind tentatively to fix A—— as the name of the place where his Happy Family should be."

Taking two packages of the well-known Wenhsi cakes, I threaded my way through several damp streets, stepping cautiously past many sleeping dogs, until I reached his door. It seemed very bright inside. I thought even his rooms were better lit since he had become an adviser, and smiled to myself. However, when I looked up, I saw a strip of white paper3 stuck on the door. It occurred to me, as I stepped inside, that the children's grandmother might be dead; but I went straight in."

Needless to say, in the villages and towns, even in the sky, there is a new year.

I am returning to my hometown Lu Town this night. Although he is his hometown, he has no home, so he has to temporarily live in the mansion of the fourth master of Lu. He is my family, a generation older than me, and should be called ""Fourth Uncle"". He is an old supervisor who teaches science. He hasn't changed much from before. He's just a little older, but he still doesn't have a beard. When they meet each other, they greet each other. After that, they say I'm ""fat"", and after saying I'm ""fat"", they scold the new party. But I know that this is not to scold me: because what he scolds is still Kang Youwei. However, conversations are never speculative, so I was left alone in the study after a while.","It’s the end of the lunar year – the end told by the old and not the Western calendar – that brings a year to its proper close, as villages, towns, even heaven itself mark its approach. Flashes of lightning through heavy, grey evening clouds are answered by the dull explosions of firecrackers, bidding farewell to the Kitchen God as he departs for heaven to make his annual report on mankind. Close by, the blasts have an ear-splitting ferocity, the faint smell of gunpowder hanging in the air before the noise has died away. It was on one such night that I returned to the old place, to my home town: Luzhen. Since there was no real home left for me any more, I took up temporary lodging in the house of an old gentleman by the name of Mr Lu. As he was a distant relative of mine, the generation above me, I addressed him as Uncle. A diehard Neo-Confucian of the old Imperial College,1 he seemed barely changed: a touch older, that was all, and still beardless. After a little polite chit-chat and the observation that I had put on weight, he launched into a great tirade against reformist politics. Though I knew his ire was directed more at old liberals like Kang Youwei2 than at me specifically, as our conversation was not taking a particularly amicable direction, soon enough I found myself alone in the study.","New Year's Eve of the old calendar seems after all more like the real New Year's Eve; for, to say nothing of the villages and towns, even in the air there is a feeling that New Year is coming. From the pale, lowering evening clouds issue frequent flashes of lightning, followed by a rumbling sound of firecrackers celebrating the departure of the Hearth God; while, nearer by, the firecrackers explode even more violently, and before the deafening report dies away the air is filled with a faint smell of powder. It was on such a night that I returned to Luchen, my native place. Although I call it my native place, I had had no home there for some time, so I had to put up temporarily with a certain Mr. Lu, the fourth son of his family. He is a member of our clan, and belongs to the generation before mine, so I ought to call him ""Fourth Uncle. "" An old student of the imperial college2 who went in for Neo-Confucianism , I found him very little changed in any way, simply slightly older, but without any moustache as yet. When we met, after exchanging a few polite remarks he said I was fatter, and after saying that immediately started a violent attack on the revolutionaries. I knew this was not meant personally, because the object of the attack was still Kang Yu-wei.3 Nevertheless, conversation proved difficult, so that in a short time I found myself alone in the study."

The principal obstacle to be anticipated was this chief mourner of hers: everyone was convinced he would insist on ‘modernizing’ the funeral in some way. By the end of the conference, everyone had fixed upon three conditions. One, that he should wear white, the conventional colour of mourning; two, that he should kneel; and three, that Daoist and Buddhist monks should be called in to perform the proper ceremonies.

After a conference, they decided on three terms which he must accept.

There was a water chestnut-shaped round basket on the table, with a small bed under the eaves. She still has a white headband tied on her head, a black skirt, a blue jacket, and a moon-white vest. Her face is blue and yellow, but the blood has disappeared from her cheeks, and there are some tears on the corners of her eyes. And it was still led by Mrs. Wei, showing compassion, and said to the fourth aunt softly:","But one autumn – probably a couple of years after the news of her change in fortune had been put about – Xianglin’s wife stood again in Uncle’s hall.

Her face still had a greenish-yellow tinge to it; but the pink had left her cheeks. Tears hung at the corners of eyes cast dully down at the floor. As before, she was in the company of Mrs Wei, who – her features arranged into an expression of charitable indulgence – verbosely explained matters to Aunt.","But one autumn, two New Years after they heard how lucky Hsiang Lin's Wife had been, she actually reappeared on the threshold of my uncle's house.

But she hadn’t said anything – she hadn’t wanted him to worry. One night, her uncle, Chang Geng, had come by again, wanting to borrow money as usual. When she wouldn’t give him any he smirked and told her not to act so superior. Her father had arranged for her to marry a complete good-for-nothing – not even half the man he was. She was never the same after this: always sad, always bursting into tears – too shy to ask anything directly. As soon as Chang Fu found out, he told her what a fine fellow her fiancé was; but the damage had been done. She didn’t believe him. Just as well I haven’t long left, she said.","""Then she told me the whole story, saying, 'It was probably last spring that Ah Shun began to look pale and thin. Later she would often start crying suddenly, and if you asked her why, she wouldn't say. Sometimes she even cried all night, until Chang Fu lost his temper and scolded her, saying she had waited too long to marry and had gone mad. When autumn came, first she had a slight cold and then she took to her bed, and after that she never got up again. Only a few days before she died, she told Chang Fu that she had long ago become like her mother, often spitting blood and perspiring at night. She had hidden it, afraid that he would worry about her. One evening her uncle Chang Keng came to demand money—he was always doing that—and when she would not give him any he smiled coldly and said, ""Don't be so proud; your man is not even up to me!"" That upset her, but she was too shy to ask, and could only cry. As soon as Chang Fu knew this, he told her what a decent fellow her future husband was; but it was too late. Besides, she didn't believe him. ""It's a good thing I'm already like this,"" she said. ""Now nothing matters any more.""'"

堂棺懒懒的说着，放下杯，筷，酒壶和碗碟，酒到了。我转脸向了板桌，排好器具，斟出酒来。觉得北方固不是我的旧乡，但南来又只能算一个客子，无论那边的干雪怎样纷飞，这里的柔雪又怎样的依恋，于我都没有什么关系了。我略带些哀愁，然而很舒服的呷一口酒。酒味很纯正；油豆腐也煮得十分好；可惜辣酱太淡薄，本来S城人是不懂得吃辣的。,"Tang Coffin said lazily, put down the cup, chopsticks, jug and dishes, the wine arrived. I turned to the board table, arranged the utensils, and poured out the wine. I feel that the north is definitely not my old hometown, but the south can only be regarded as a guest. No matter how the dry snow is flying over there, and how attached the soft snow is here, it has nothing to do with me. I feel a little sad, but take a sip of wine comfortably. The taste of the wine is very pure; the oil tofu is also cooked very well; unfortunately, the spicy sauce is too weak, and the people of S City do not know how to eat spicy food.","‘Your wine, sir,’ the waiter drawled, setting down a cup, chopsticks, a flask of wine, a bowl and a saucer. I turned back to the table, arranged everything to my liking, and poured the wine. Though I was no northerner, I now felt a stranger in the south also – as if the dry snow of the north, and the soft, clinging snow of the south were both foreign to me. I medicated my melancholy with a sip of wine. Both wine and bean curd were excellent – my only complaint was that the chilli sauce was too weak. The people round here had never had much of a stomach for spicy food.","""Your wine, sir,"" said the waiter carelessly, and put down the cup, chopsticks, wine pot and dish. The wine had come.

The dry snow up there, which flew like powder, and the soft snow here, which clung lingeringly, seemed equally alien to me. In a slightly melancholy mood, I took a leisurely sip of wine. The wine was quite pure, and the fried beancurd was excellently cooked. The only pity was that the pepper sauce was too thin, but then the people of S—— had never understood pungent flavours ."

They haven't changed much, they're just getting older, but they're always busy at home, and they're all preparing for ""blessings"". This is the year-end ceremony in Luzhen, to pay tribute, to welcome the God of Fortune, and to pray for good luck in the coming year. Killing chickens, slaughtering geese, buying pork, and washing them carefully, the women's arms were all red from the water, and some even wore silver bracelets with twisted silk. After cooking, stick some chopsticks on top of this kind of thing, which is called ""Fu Li"". It is displayed at the fifth watch, and incense candles are lit, and the gods of good fortune are invited to enjoy it, but the worship is only limited to men. After all, firecrackers are still set off naturally. This is the case every year, every family, - as long as you can afford gifts and firecrackers and the like - this year is naturally the same. The sky became darker and darker, and it snowed in the afternoon. The snowflakes were as big as plum blossoms, flying all over the sky. With the haze and the busy complexion, Lu Zhen became a mess. When I returned to my fourth uncle's study, the corrugations were already white, and the room was also brighter, which clearly showed Zhu Tuo's big ""shou"" hanging on the wall, written by the ancestor Chen Tuan. The couplet has fallen off, and it is loosely rolled up and placed on the long table, while the one on the other side is still there. I was bored and went to the desk under the window to look it up, and I saw a pile of ""Kangxi Dictionary"", a ""Jin Silu Collection"" and a ""Four Books Lining"" that did not seem to be complete. Anyway, I decided to leave tomorrow.","After a late start the following morning, I called on a number of friends and relatives after lunch; the next day followed the same pattern. Again, they seemed unchanged: a few years older, that was all. Every household was frantically preparing for the New Year’s Sacrifice – the elaborately reverent end-of-year ritual to welcome in the God of Fortune and to plead for good luck over the coming year. Geese and hens are slaughtered, pork bought – everything scrubbed and scoured until the women’s arms, some still enclosed in bracelets of twisted silver, are soaked red. When all the cooking is done, chopsticks are stuck into the offerings and, at dawn, the bowls of food are set out, the incense and candles lit, and the God of Fortune invited to come and enjoy the feast. Once the devotions – from which women are banned – have been made, the firecrackers are lit. So it is in every family, every year, as long as they can afford to buy food for the offerings and firecrackers; and so it was this year. That New Year’s Eve, an overcast sky began disintegrating into snowflakes as big as plum-blossom petals that mingled with the smoke and prevailing bustle, adding a kind of frenzied confusion to the town. By the time I took refuge again in my uncle’s study, the roof tiles were carpeted in white, brightening the interior of the room and the enormous vermilion rubbing on the wall – of the character for ‘Longevity’, written by the celebrated Daoist hermit Chen Tuan.3 A pair of couplets had once hung either side. One had fallen off and now lay, slackly rolled up, on a rectangular table; the other – an inscription by the great Neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Xi – remained in place: ‘When principles are grasped, the mind is at peace.’ Bored, under-occupied, I glanced through the piles of volumes on the table beneath the window, but found only a set – probably incomplete – of an early eighteenth-century dictionary, a collection of Neo-Confucian writings and a Qing exegesis of the four Confucian classics. I determined to leave the next day.","The next day I got up very late, and after lunch went out to see some relatives and friends. The day after I did the same. None of them was greatly changed, simply slightly older; but every family was busy preparing for ""the sacrifice. "" This is the great end-of-year ceremony in Luchen, when people reverently welcome the God of Fortune and solicit good fortune for the coming year. They kill chickens and geese and buy pork, scouring and scrubbing until all the women's arms turn red in the water. Some of them still wear twisted silver bracelets. After the meat is cooked some chopsticks are thrust into it at random, and this is called the ""offering. "" It is set out at dawn when incense and candles are lit, and they reverently invite the God of Fortune to come and partake of the offering. Only men can be worshippers, and after the sacrifice they naturally continue to let off firecrackers as before. This happens every year, in every family, provided they can afford to buy the offering and firecrackers; and this year they naturally followed the old custom. The day grew overcast. In the afternoon it actually started to snow, the biggest snow-flakes as large as plum blossom petals fluttered about the sky; and this, combined with the smoke and air of activity, made Luchen appear in a ferment. When I returned to my uncle's study the roof of the house was already white with snow. The room also appeared brighter, the great red rubbing hanging on the wall showing up very clearly the character for Longevity written by the Taoist saint Chen Tuan.4 One of a pair of scrolls had fallen down and was lying loosely rolled up on the long table, but the other was still hanging there, bearing the words: ""By understanding reason we achieve tranquillity of mind."" Idly, I went to turn over the books on the table beneath the window, but all I could find was a pile of what looked like an incomplete set of Kang Hsi's Dictionary,5a volume of Chiang Yung's Notes to Chu Hsi's Philosophical Writings. and a volume of Commentaries on the Four Books.6 At all events, I made up my mind to leave the next day."

He frowned, turned to the window, narrowed his eyes, and recited the line pointed out by Xuecheng:","When he’d taken the book from his son, Siming realized it was a dictionary with tiny, horizontal print. Frowning, he held it up to the light and read out the line, squinting, that Xuecheng had indicated.","Ssu-min took it and looked at it.

不知怎地虽然因此记起，但他的面貌却总是逐渐模胡；然而又似乎和我日加密切起来，往往无端感到一种连自己也莫明其妙的不安和极轻微的震颤。幸而到了秋季，这《学理七日报》就不寄来了；山阳的《学理周刊》上却又按期登起一篇长论文：《流言即事实论》。里面还说，关于某君们的流言，已在公正士绅间盛传了。这是专指几个人的，有我在内；我只好极小心，照例连吸烟卷的烟也谨防飞散。小心是一种忙的苦痛，因此会百事俱废，自然也无暇记得连殳。总之：我其实已经将他忘却了。,"For some reason, although I remembered it, his face was always gradually blurred; but it seemed to be getting closer to me, and I often felt a kind of uneasiness and a very slight tremor that even I didn't understand. Fortunately, in the autumn, the ""Xueli Seventh Daily"" was not sent; Shanyang's ""Xueli Weekly"" published a long paper on schedule: ""The Rumor is the Fact Theory"". It also said that rumors about certain gentlemen had already spread among the fair gentry. This was for a few people, including me; I had to be very careful, as usual, even the cigarettes I smoked were not scattered. Being careful is a kind of busy pain, so everything will be lost, and naturally there will be no time to remember even the sadness. In short: I had actually forgotten about him.","The curious thing was that, despite all these reminders of him, and of my affection for him, his features blurred in my memory. But he haunted my thoughts, leaving me with a kind of mysterious, shuddering apprehension. Luckily, by autumn Study Weekly had stopped coming. At which point, Shanyang’s Principles of Study carried a long piece entitled ‘Gossip – Fact’. Rumours about certain gentlemen, it revealed, were enjoying a wide currency among law-abiding local notables. Several names were mentioned, of which mine was one. Now, extra precautions in my daily life became necessary – permitting my cigarette smoke to escape through the window once more became unacceptably risky. Worn out by it all, I soon let Lianshu slip to the back, and then out, of my mind.",""" Only an exceptional man, it was implied, could have done such unusual things. Although this recalled him to me, my impression of him grew fainter. Yet all the time he seemed to gain a closer hold on me, which often filled me with an inexplicable sense of uneasiness and a shadowy apprehension. However, by autumn the newspaper stopped coming, while the Shanyang magazine began to publish the first instalment of a long essay called ""The element of truth in rumours,"" which asserted that rumours about certain gentlemen had reached the ears of the mighty. My name was among those attacked. I had to be very careful then. I had to take care that my cigarette smoke did not get in other people's way. All these precautions took so much time I could attend to nothing else, and naturally had no leisure to think of Wei. I actually forgot him."

I was deeply unsettled. Had I made things worse for her, I wondered, by replying in the way I did?

Had she had a premonition of some kind? If she had meant something else, and something happened because of what I’d said to her, then I would be responsible – to a degree – for whatever it was… But then I laughed at myself: it was just a random encounter, nothing more than that. And here I was, obsessively going back over it – no wonder certain educationalists have diagnosed me a neurotic. Anyway, I was perfectly insured with that last ‘I don’t really know.’ Even if something did now happen, it could have nothing to do with me.","In order to avoid further importunate questions, I walked off, and beat a hasty retreat to my uncle's house, feeling exceedingly uncomfortable.

Could she have had some premonition? If there is another reason, and as a result something happens, then, through my answer, I shall be held responsible to a certain extent."" Finally, however, I ended by laughing at myself, thinking that such a chance meeting could have no great significance, and yet I was taking it so to heart ; no wonder certain educationalists called me a neurotic. Moreover I had distinctly said, ""I am not sure,"" contradicting my previous answer; so that even if anything did happen, it would have nothing at all to do with me."

这也不足为奇，中国的兴学虽说已经二十年了，寒石山却连小学也没有。全山村中，只有连殳是出外游学的学生，所以从村人看来，他确是一个异类；但也很妒羡，说他挣得许多钱。,"This is not surprising. Although China has been promoting learning for twenty years, Hanshishan does not even have an elementary school. In the whole mountain village, only Lian Chen was a student who went abroad to study, so from the villagers' point of view, he was indeed an outlier; but he was also envious, saying that he earned a lot of money.","And no wonder. Twenty years after China had launched a national programme of educational reform, Hanshi Mountain still found itself without so much as a primary school. Lianshu was the only villager who had left to get an education. He was also the object of no little envy: everyone insisted he’d made a fortune in town.","they said. This was not strange, for although China had had modern schools for some twenty years, there was not even a primary school in Hanshihshan. He was the only one who had left that mountain village to study; hence in the villagers' eyes he was an undoubted freak. They also envied him, though, saying he had made much money."
看见的人报告说，河里面上午就泊了一只白篷船，篷是全盖起来的，不知道什么人在里面，但事前也没有人去理会他。待到祥林嫂出来掏米，刚刚要跪下去，那船里便突然跳出两个男人来，像是山里人，一个抱住她，一个帮着，拖进船去了。样林嫂还哭喊了几声，此后便再没有什么声息，大约给用什么堵住了罢。接着就走上两个女人来，一个不认识，一个就是卫婆于。窥探舱里，不很分明，她像是捆了躺在船板上。,"People who saw it reported that a white-canopy boat was moored in the river in the morning. When Mrs. Xianglin came out to dig the rice and was about to kneel down, two men suddenly jumped out of the boat, like people from the mountains, one hugged her and the other helped and dragged her into the boat. Sister-in-law Lin also cried a few times, but after that, there was no sound anymore, so it was probably blocked by something. Then came two women, one did not know, and the other was Wei Poyu. In the spying cabin, it was not very clear, she seemed to be lying on the board of the ship tied up.","That morning, he was told, while he was out, a boat – its white awning pulled fully across – had been spotted moored on the river. No one knew whose it was, though neither was the question given much thought. Just as Xianglin’s wife knelt down to wash the rice, two men – both peasants from the mountains, by the looks of them – rushed out of the boat. One had grabbed her, then, helped by the other, dragged her down into the boat. After screaming a while, she fell silent – probably because she had been gagged. Then a couple of women stepped on to the bank: Mrs Wei, with someone they didn’t recognize. No one got a proper look at what was going on in the boat, though Xianglin’s wife seemed to be lying on the deck, tied up.","Some people there told him that a boat with a white awning had moored there in the morning, but since the awning covered the boat completely they did not know who was inside, and before this incident no one had paid any attention to it. But when Hsiang Lin's Wife came to wash rice, two men looking like country people jumped off the boat just as she was kneeling down and seizing hold of her carried her on board. After several shouts and cries, Hsiang Lin's Wife became silent: they had probably stopped her mouth. Then two women walked up, one of them a stranger and the other Old Mrs. Wei. When the people who told this story tried to peep into the boat they could not see very clearly, but Hsiang Lin's Wife seemed to be lying bound on the floor of the boat."

People say that the fourth master of Lu employs a female worker, who is actually more diligent than a diligent man. By the end of the year, sweeping the dust, washing the floor, killing chickens, slaughtering geese, and cooking all night, are all performed by one person, with no part-time workers. However, she was rather satisfied, and there was a smile on the corner of the mouth, and her face became pale.","As the days flew by, her prodigious capacity for work continued. On she went, not minding what she was given to eat, never sparing herself. Everyone said the Lus’ maid worked better than a man.

In my memory, his face no longer appears often. But less than ten days after receiving the letter, the Xueli Seventh Daily Office in City S suddenly sent their ""Xueli Seventh Daily"" by post. I don't really read these things, but since they were sent, I just looked through them. This reminds me of Lian Shu, because there are often poems about him in it, such as ""Mr. Lian Shu Ye Ye in Xue Ye"", ""Lian Shu Consultant Gao Zhai Elegant Collection"" and so on; once, ""Xue Li Xian Tan"" Li also remarked on the things he had previously been rumored to be the laughing stock of, which he called ""anecdotes"".","I did begin to forget him, just as he had instructed. But less than ten days after his letter arrived, Study Weekly – a local S— paper – suddenly went back into print. Though I’d never been a great reader of such publications, I glanced idly through it, since it had dropped on to my doorstep. It was full of reminders of Lianshu, of poems and essays mentioning him – ‘A Snowy Audience with Mr Lianshu’, ‘An Elegant Gathering in the Studio of our Esteemed Aide-de-camp Lianshu’, and so on. In the section entitled ‘Gossip’, stories in which Lianshu had previously been the target of ridicule were now relished as amusing anecdotes, designed to prove that exceptional men behave in exceptional ways.","In fact, I gradually forgot him. His face no longer sprang so often to my mind's eye. However, less than ten days after hearing from him, the office of the S—— Weekly started sending me its paper. I did not read such papers as a rule, but since it was sent to me I glanced at some of the contents. This reminded me of Wei, for the paper frequently carried poems and essays about him, such as ""Calling on scholar Wei at night during a snowstorm,"" ""A poetic gathering at the scholarly abode of Adviser Wei,"" and so forth. Once, indeed, under the heading ""Table Talk,"" they retailed with gusto certain stories which had previously been considered material for ridicule, but which had now become ""Tales of an Eccentric Genius."

下了一天雪，到夜还没有止，屋外一切静极，静到要听出静的声音来。我在小小的灯火光中，闭目枯坐，如见雪花片片飘坠，来增补这一望无际的雪堆；故乡也准备过年了，人们忙得很；我自己还是一个儿童，在后园的平坦处和一伙小朋友塑雪罗汉。雪罗汉的眼睛是用两块小炭嵌出来的，颜色很黑，这一闪动，便变了连殳的眼睛。,"It snowed all day, and it didn't stop until the night. Everything outside the house was extremely quiet, so quiet that you could hear the sound of stillness.

Xue Luohan's eyes were inlaid with two small pieces of charcoal, and the color was very black. This flickering changed his eyes.","Snow had fallen all day and deep into the night. Outside, the quiet was so absolute you could almost hear it.

I thought of the place I’d grown up, of frantic New Year preparations there, of childhood, of sculpting a Buddhist saint out of snow in our back courtyard. Its black eyes – fashioned out of two fragments of coal – suddenly flashed, like Lianshu’s.","It had been snowing all day, and the snow had not stopped by evening.

Now they were past Wangjia Quay, he knew, the next stop would be Pangzhuang – the Pavilion of the Literary Spirit on the edge of the village was already in sight. Pangzhuang, which he had been to more times than he cared to remember, was a complete backwater, and Mr Wei a perfect nobody. He still remembered how his daughter had wept as she returned home, how disgracefully his in-laws had behaved, how badly they had treated him and his daughter. As he went back over the past, he didn’t give his usual bleak smile on recalling how he had taken his revenge on their stove. This time, everything else was obscured by the expansive form of Mr Qi, hustling his thoughts into nervous confusion.","Chuang Mu-san had come to the end of his tobacco, and the oil in the pipe was sputtering, but still he went on puffing. He knew that after Wang Jetty came Pang Village. Already, in fact, you could see Literary Star Pavilion at the entrance to the village. He had been here so often it was not worth talking about, any more than Mr. Wei. He remembered how his daughter had come home crying, how badly her husband and father-in-law had behaved, and how he had worsted them. The past unfolded again before his eyes. Usually when he recalled how he had punished evil-doers, he gave a bleak smile—but nor this time. The fat form of Seventh Master had somehow intervened, and was squeezing his thoughts out of any semblance of order."

我想，这回定是酒客了，因为听得那脚步声比堂倌的要缓得多。约略料他走完了楼梯的时候，我便害怕似的抬头去看这无干的同伴，同时也就吃惊的站起来。我竟不料在这里意外的遇见朋友了，——假如他现在还许我称他为朋友。那上来的分明是我的旧同窗，也是做教员时代的旧同事，面貌虽然颇有些改变，但一见也就认识，独有行动却变得格外迂缓，很不像当年敏捷精悍的吕纬甫了。,"I think it must be a drinker this time, because the footsteps are much slower than those of the clerk.

Though his face was a little changed, I recognized him instantly. He moved differently as well – more slowly; there seemed to be little of the speed and energy of the old Lü Weifu.","""This time it must be a customer,"" I thought, for the footsteps sounded much slower than those of the waiter. When I judged that he must be at the top of the stairs, I raised my head rather apprehensively to look at this unwelcome company. I gave a start and stood up. I never guessed that here of all places I should unexpectedly meet a friend—if such he would still let me call him. The newcomer was an old classmate who had been my colleague when I was a teacher, and although he had changed a great deal I knew him as soon as I saw him.

她看见他嘴里这么说，眼光却射在她的脖子上，便觉得颧骨以下的脸上似乎有些热。她有时自己偶然摸到脖子上，尤其是耳朵后，指面上总感着些粗糙，本来早就知道是积年的老泥，但向来倒也并不很介意。现在在他的注视之下，对着这葵绿异香的洋肥皂，可不禁脸上有些发热了，而且这热又不绝的蔓延开去，即刻一径到耳根。她于是就决定晚饭后要用这肥皂来拚命的洗一洗。,"She saw him say this, but his eyes were on her neck, and she felt a little hot on her face below her cheekbones.

The sky was brighter than the room, so Xuecheng practiced Bagua Boxing on the corner of the wall: this is his ""court training"", an economic method that uses the time between day and night, and Xuecheng has been practicing it for nearly half a year. He nodded approvingly, then paced back and forth in the empty yard with his hands behind his back. Before long, the broad leaves of the only bonsai evergreen had disappeared into the darkness again, and stars flashed from the broken white clouds, and the night began. At this moment, Siming couldn't help but get excited, as if he was going to do something big and declare war with the bad students and the bad society around him.

After granting his son a slight nod of approval, Siming took to pacing up and down the empty courtyard, his hands behind his back. Soon, the fat leaves of the yard’s one evergreen bonsai merged into the dusk, the stars glimmered out from among the white clouds – like broken tufts of wadding scattered over the sky – and darkness began. At this point in the day, Siming found himself filled with inspiring presentiments: of the great things that he would accomplish, of the war that he was about to declare on the evils of society – most notably, rotten students. His strides lengthened as his mood grew hawkish, the tramp of his cloth soles waking the hen and her chicks in their coop into frightened cheeps.","Ssu-min stood up too, and walked into the courtyard. It was lighter out than in. Hsueh-cheng was practising Hexagram Boxing in a corner by the wall. This constituted his ""home education,"" and he used the economical method of employing the hour between day and night for this purpose. Hsueh-cheng had been boxing now for about half a year. Ssu-min nodded very slightly, as if in approval, then began to pace the courtyard with his hands behind his back. Before long, the broad leaves of the evergreen which was the only potted plant they had were swallowed up in the darkness, and stars twinkled between white clouds which looked like torn cotton. Night had fallen. Ssu-min could not repress his growing indignation. He felt called on to do great deeds, to declare war on all bad students about and on this wicked society. By degrees he grew bolder and bolder, his steps became longer and longer, and the thud of his cloth soles grew louder and louder, waking the hen and her chicks in the coop so that they cheeped in alarm."
