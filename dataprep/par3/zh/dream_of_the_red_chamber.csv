襲人道：「再不可毀僧謗道，調脂弄粉。還有更要緊的一件，再不許喫人嘴上擦的胭脂了，與那愛紅的毛病兒。」寶玉道：「都改，都改。再有什麼，快說。」襲人笑道：「再也沒有了。衹是百事檢點些，不任意任情的就是了。你若果都依了，便拿八人轎也抬不出我去了。」寶玉笑道：「你在這裏長遠了，不怕沒八人轎你坐。」襲人冷笑道：「這我可不希罕的。有那個福氣，沒有那個道理。縱坐了，也沒甚趣。」,"Xiren said: ""Don't slander the monks anymore, adjust fat and make powder. There is a more important thing, don't eat the rouge on people's mouth, and those who love red."" Baoyu said: ""It's all changed. If you have anything else, just say it.” Xiren smiled and said, “There is no more. Just be careful, and don’t be arrogant. If you agree to everything, you will take the eight-person sedan chair. You can’t carry me.” Baoyu smiled and said, “You’ve been here for a long time, so you’re not afraid that you won’t be able to sit in a sedan chair with eight people.” Xiren sneered, “I don’t like that. There is such a blessing, but there is no reason for it. Well, it's no fun.""","“It isn’t right that you should sneer at the bonzes and vilify the Taoist priests, nor mix cosmetics or prepare rouge,” Hsi Jen continued; “but there’s still another thing more important , you shouldn’t again indulge the bad habits of licking the cosmetic, applied by people on their lips, nor be fond of (girls dressed) in red!” “I’ll change in all this,” Pao-yue added by way of rejoinder; “I’ll change in all this; and if there’s anything more be quick and tell me.” “There’s nothing more,” Hsi Jen observed; “but you must in everything exercise a little more diligence, and not indulge your caprices and allow your wishes to run riot, and you’ll be all right. And should you comply to all these things in real earnest, you couldn’t carry me out, even in a chair with eight bearers.” “Well, if you do stay in here long enough,” Pao-yue remarked with a smile, “there’s no fear as to your not having an eight-bearer-chair to sit in!” Hsi Jen gave a sardonic grin. “I don’t care much about it,” she replied; “and were I even to have such good fortune, I couldn’t enjoy such a right. But allowing I could sit in one, there would be no pleasure in it!”","‘You must leave off forever going on about people’s appearance and interfering with their make-up – and you must give up that filthy habit of stealing people’s lipstick and eating it on the sly. That’s most important!’ ‘I’ll reform! I’ll reform I Is there anything else, now?’ ‘Nothing else, really. Just to be a bit more careful about things in general and not always letting yourself get carried away by your whims and fancies. But if you will really keep your promise about these three things I’ve mentioned, I will promise never to leave you – even if they send a bridal chair and eight strong bearers to carry me away!’ ‘Oh, come now! Isn’t that stretching it a bit?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘For eight bearers and a handsome husband I bet you’d go!’ ‘It wouldn’t interest me in the least,’ said Aroma haughtily. ‘ “Kind sir, for such blessing I am not willing.” Even if I did go, I should take no pleasure in it.’"
寶玉此時與寶釵就近，只聞一陣陣涼森森甜絲絲的幽香，竟不知從何處來的，遂問：「姐姐熏的是什麼香？我竟從未聞見過這味兒。」寶釵笑道：「我最怕熏香，好好的衣服，熏的煙燎火氣的。」寶玉道：「既如此，這是什麼香？」寶釵想了一想，笑道：「是了，是我早起喫了丸藥的香氣未散呢。」寶玉笑道：「什麼藥這麼香得好聞？姐姐，給我一丸嘗嘗。」寶釵笑道：「又混鬧了，一個藥也是混喫的？」,"Baoyu was close to Baochai at this time, and only smelled a cool and sweet fragrance, but she didn't know where it came from, so she asked, ""What kind of incense did my sister smoke? I have never smelled this smell before."" Baoyu Chai smiled and said, ""I'm most afraid of incense, good clothes, and smoke that ignites fire."" Bao Yu said, ""If that's the case, what kind of incense is this?"" Bao Chai thought for a while, then smiled: ""Yes, It's because I woke up early and took the pills and the aroma hasn't dissipated."" Baoyu laughed: ""What kind of medicine smells so good? Sister, give me a pill to try."" Baochai smiled and said, ""It's a mess again, and one medicine is also mixed. of?""","“Where he had come from?” Pao-yue had, by this time, drawn quite close to Pao Ch’ai, and perceived whiff after whiff of some perfume or other, of what kind he could not tell. “What perfume have you used, my cousin,” he forthwith asked, “to fumigate your dresses with? I really don’t remember smelling any perfumery of the kind before.” “I’m very averse,” replied Pao Ch’ai blandly, “to the odour of fumigation; good clothes become impregnated with the smell of smoke.” “In that case,” observed Pao-yue, “what scent is it?” “Yes, I remember,” Pao Ch’ai answered, after some reflection; “it’s the scent of the ‘cold fragrance’ pills which I took this morning.” “What are these cold fragrance pills,” remarked Pao-yue smiling, “that they have such a fine smell? Give me, cousin, a pill to try.” “Here you are with your nonsense again,” Pao Ch’ai rejoined laughingly; “is a pill a thing to be taken recklessly?” She had scarcely finished speaking, when she heard suddenly some one outside say, “Miss Lin is come;” and shortly Lin Tai-yue walked in in a jaunty manner. “Oh, I come at a wrong moment!”","Bao-yu was now sitting almost shoulder to shoulder with her and as he did so became aware of a penetrating fragrance that seemed to emanate from her person. ‘What incense do you use to scent your clothes with, cousin?’ he asked. ‘I have never smelt such a delicious perfume.’ ‘I can’t stand incense perfumes,’ said Bao-chai. ‘I could never see the point of smoking perfectly good, clean clothes over an incense-pot.’ ‘In that case, what is this perfume I can smell ?’ Bao-chai thought for a moment. ‘I know! It must be the Cold Fragrance Pill I took this morning.’ ‘What’s a Cold Fragrance Pill?’ said Bao-yu with a laugh. ‘Won’t you give me one to try?’ ‘Now you’re being silly again. Medicine isn’t something to be taken for amusement.’ Just at that moment the servants outside announced ‘Miss Lin’ and"
眾人見寶玉牛心，都怪他呆癡不改。今見問「天然」二字，眾人忙道：「別的都明白，為何連『天然』不知？『天然』者，天之自然而有，非人力之所成也。」寶玉道：「卻又來！此處置一田莊，分明見得人力穿鑿扭捏而成。遠無鄰村，近不負郭，背山山無脈，臨水水無源，高無隱寺之塔，下無通市之橋，峭然孤出，似非大觀。爭似先處有自然之理，得自然之氣，雖種竹引泉，亦不傷於穿鑿。古人云『天然圖畫』四字，正畏非其地而強為地，非其山而強為山，雖百般精巧而終不相宜……」未及說完，賈政氣的喝命：「叉出去！」剛出去，又喝命：「回來！」命再題一聯：「若不通，一併打嘴！」寶玉只得唸道：「新漲綠添浣葛處，好雲香護採芹人。」,"When everyone saw Baoyu Niu Xin, they all blamed him for being stupid. Seeing the question about the word ""natural"" today, the crowd hurriedly said, ""Everything else is understood, why don't you even know about ""natural""? ""Natural"" is something that exists naturally in the sky, and is not created by human beings."" Baoyu said, ""However, Come! This disposal of a farm is clearly made by manpower. It is far from neighboring villages, close to Guo, backed by mountains and without veins, facing water and water without sources, high without the towers of hidden temples, and without bridges leading to the city. Qiao Ran is isolated, and it seems not to be a grand view. It seems that there is a natural principle in the first place, and the natural gas is obtained. Although the bamboo springs are planted, it will not hurt the piercing. For the sake of the earth, it is not a mountain but a mountain, although it is ingenious in every way, it is not suitable for the end..."" Before he could finish speaking, Jia Zheng shouted angrily: ""Go out!"" Another couplet: ""If it doesn't work, let's fight together!"" Baoyu could only recite: ""The new green leaves will be added to the place where the geranium is added.","“You ignorant stupid thing!” exclaimed Chia Cheng at these words; “what you simply fancy as exquisite, with that despicable reliance of yours upon luxury and display, are two-storied buildings and painted pillars! But how can you know anything about this aspect so pure and unobtrusive, and this is all because of that failing of not studying your books!” “Sir,” hastily answered Pao-yue, “your injunctions are certainly correct; but men of old have often made allusion to ‘natural;’ and what is, I wonder, the import of these two characters?” The company had perceived what a perverse mind Pao yue possessed, and they one and all were much surprised that he should be so silly beyond the possibility of any change; and when now they heard the question he asked, about the two characters representing “natural,” they, with one accord, speedily remarked, “Everything else you understand, and how is it that on the contrary you don’t know what ‘natural’ implies? The word ‘natural’ means effected by heaven itself and not made by human labour.” “Well, just so,” rejoined Pao-yue; “but the farm, which is laid out in this locality, is distinctly the handiwork of human labour; in the distance, there are no neighbouring hamlets; near it, adjoin no wastes; though it bears a hill, the hill is destitute of streaks; though it be close to water, this water has no spring; above, there is no pagoda nestling in a temple; below, there is no bridge leading to a market; it rises abrupt and solitary, and presents no grand sight! The palm would seem to be carried by the former spot, which is imbued with the natural principle, and possesses the charms of nature; for, though bamboos have been planted in it, and streams introduced, they nevertheless do no violence to the works executed. ‘A natural landscape,’ says, an ancient author in four words; and why? Simply because he apprehended that what was not land, would, by forcible ways, be converted into land; and that what was no hill would, by unnatural means, be raised into a hill. And ingenious though these works might be in a hundred and one ways, they cannot, after all, be in harmony.”... But he had no time to conclude, as Chia Cheng flew into a rage. “Drive him off,” he shouted; (but as Pao-yue) was on the point of going out, he again cried out: “Come back! make up,” he added, “another couplet, and if it isn’t clear, I’ll for all this give you a slap on your mouth.” Pao-yue had no alternative but to recite as follows: A spot in which the “Ko” fibre to bleach, as the fresh tide doth swell the waters green! A beauteous halo and a fragrant smell the man encompass who the cress did pluck!","The literary gentlemen, who had observed a vein of mulish-ness in Bao-yu which boded trouble, were surprised by the seeming naivete’ of this reply. ‘Why, fancy not knowing what “natural” means – you who have such a good understanding of so much else! “Natural” is that which is of nature , that is to say, that which is produced by nature as opposed to that which is produced by human artifice.’ ‘There you are, you see!’ said Bao-yu. ‘ A farm set down in the middle of a place like this is obviously the product of human artifice. There are no neighbouring villages, no distant prospects of city walls; the mountain at the back doesn’t belong to any system; there is no pagoda rising from some tree-hid monastery in the hills above; there is no bridge below leading to a near-by market town. It sticks up out of nowhere, in total isolation from everything else. It isn’t even a particularly remarkable view – not nearly so “natural” in either form or spirit as those other places we have seen. The bam boos in those other places may have been planted by human hand and the streams diverted out of their natural courses, but there was no appearance of artifice. That’s why, when the ancients use the term “natural” I have my doubts about what they really meant. For example, when they speak of a “natural painting”, I can’t help wondering if they are not referring to precisely that forcible interference with the landscape to which I object: putting hills where they are not meant to be, and that sort of thing. However great the skill with which this is done, the results are never quite…’ His discourse was cut short by an outburst of rage from Jia Zheng. ‘Take that boy out of here!’ Bao-yu fled. ‘Come back!’ He returned. ‘You still have to make a couplet on this place. If it isn’t satisfactory, you will find yourself reciting it to the tune of a slapped face!’ Bao-yu stood quivering with fright and for some moments was unable to say anything. At last he recited the following couplet: ‘Emergent buds swell where the washerwoman soaks her cloth. A fresh tang rises where the cress-gatherer fills his pannier.’"
到了第四日早晨，賈母等正圍著寶玉哭時，只見寶玉睜開眼說道：「從今以後，我可不在你家了！快收拾了，打發我走罷。」賈母聽了這話，如同摘心去肝一般。,"On the morning of the fourth day, when Mother Jia was crying around Baoyu, she saw Baoyu open her eyes and said, ""From now on, I'm not at your house! I'm about to pack up, send me away."" Mother Jia heard this. Words are like picking the heart and removing the liver.","The fourth day arrived. At an early hour Pao-yue suddenly opened his eyes and addressed himself to his grandmother Chia. “From this day forward,” he said, “I may no longer abide in your house, so you had better send me off at once!” These words made dowager lady Chia feel as if her very heart had been wrenched out of her.","Early on the fourth day Bao-yu suddenly opened his eyes wide and spoke to Grandmother Jia: ‘From now on I can no longer stay in this family. You must get my things ready and let me go.’ To the old lady the words were a tearing of heart from body; but Aunt Zhao, who also heard them, had the temerity to urge their acceptance:"
一夜中燈明火彩，客送官迎，那百般熱鬧，自不用說的。,"In the night, the lights were bright, and the guests were greeted by the officials. It was all lively, needless to say.","The whole night, the lanterns emitted a bright light and the fires brilliant rays; while guests were escorted on their way out and officials greeted on their way in; but of this hundredfold bustle and stir nothing need, of course, be said.",Throughout the whole of that night the Ning-guo mansion was ablaze with lights. There was a constant bustle of guests being welcomed or seen off the premises and all the liveliness and excitement that is customary on occasions of this sort.

花自芳忙去雇了一頂小轎來，眾人也不敢相留，只得送寶玉出去。襲人又抓菓子與茗煙，又把些錢與他買花炮放，教他「不可告訴人，連你也有不是。」一直送寶玉至門前，看著上轎，放下轎簾。花、茗二人牽馬跟隨。來至寧府街，茗煙命住轎，向花自芳道：「須等我同二爺還到東府裏混一混，纔好過去的，不然人家就疑惑了。」花自芳聽說有理，忙將寶玉抱出轎來，送上馬去。寶玉笑說：「倒難為你了。」於是仍進後門來。俱不在話下。,"Hua Zifang hurriedly hired a small sedan chair, and everyone did not dare to stay with each other, so they had to send Baoyu out. Xiren grabbed the fruit and cigarettes, gave him some money to buy fireworks, and taught him, ""Don't tell anyone, not even you."" Hua and Ming led a horse to follow. Arriving at Ningfu Street, Mingyan ordered her to live in a sedan chair, and said to Hua Zifang, ""I have to wait until the second master and I go to the Dongfu to hang out, and then we will pass by, otherwise people will be confused."" Hua Zifang listened. It made sense, so he hurriedly carried Baoyu out of the sedan chair and put him on the horse. Baoyu smiled and said, ""It's too hard for you."" So he still entered the back door. It's all right.","Hua Tzu-fang promptly went and bespoke a small chair; and when it came to the door, the whole party could not very well detain him, and they of course had to see Pao-yue out of the house; while Hsi Jen, on the other hand, snatched a few fruits and gave them to Ming Yen; and as she at the same time pressed in his hand several cash to buy crackers with to let off, she enjoined him not to tell any one as he himself would likewise incur blame. As she uttered these words, she straightway escorted Pao-yue as far as outside the door, from whence having seen him mount into the sedan chair, she dropped the curtain; whereupon Ming Yen and her brother, the two of them, led the horses and followed behind in his wake. Upon reaching the street where the Ning mansion was situated, Ming Yen told the chair to halt, and said to Hua Tzu-fang, “It’s advisable that I should again go, with Mr. Secundus, into the Eastern mansion, to show ourselves before we can safely betake ourselves home; for if we don’t, people will suspect!” Hua Tzu-fang, upon hearing that there was good reason in what he said, promptly clasped Pao-yue out of the chair and put him on the horse, whereupon after Pao-yue smilingly remarked: “Excuse me for the trouble I’ve surely put you to,” they forthwith entered again by the back gate; but putting aside all details, we will now confine ourselves to Pao-yue. After he had walked out of the door, the several waiting-maids in his apartments played and laughed with greater zest and with less restraint.","Hua Zi-fang hurried out to hire a cab. The rest of the company, realizing that Bao-yu had no real business to be there, made no effort to detain him and rose to see him off. Aroma snatched up a handful of sweetmeats for Tealeaf. She also gave him a few coppers to buy fireworks with. ‘Mind you don’t tell anyone about this visit!’ she said. ‘You’ll be in trouble yourself if they find out about it.’ She escorted Bao-yu to the gate and saw him into the cab, pulling the blind down on him as soon as he was inside. Tealeaf and her brother followed behind it with the horse. When they arrived outside the Ning-guo mansion, Tealeaf told the cabbie to stop. ‘We’d better go in here for a bit before going home,’ he explained to Aroma’s brother. ‘Otherwise they might get suspicious.’ Hua Zi-fang acknowledged the sense of this precaution, and lifting Bao-yu from the cab, helped him up on to his horse. ‘Thank you for your trouble,’ said Bao-yu with a winning smile as he rode into the rear gate of the Ning-guo mansion. And there, for the time being, we shall leave him. ∗"
說著，果然出去帶進一個小後生來，較寶玉略瘦巧些，清眉秀目，粉面朱唇，身材俊俏，舉止風流，似在寶玉之上，只怯怯羞羞，有女兒之態，腼腆含糊，向鳳姐作揖問好。鳳姐喜的先推寶玉，笑道：「比下去了！」便欠身一把攜了這孩子的手，就命他身旁坐了，慢慢的問他年紀、讀書等事，方知學名喚秦鍾。早有鳳姐的丫鬟媳婦們見鳳姐初會秦鍾，並未備得表禮來，遂忙過那邊去告訴平兒。平兒知道鳳姐與秦氏厚密，雖是小後生家，亦不可太儉，遂自作主意，拿了一匹尺頭、兩個「狀元及第」的小金錁子，交付與來人送過去。鳳姐猶笑說「太簡薄」等語。秦氏等謝過，一時喫畢飯，尤氏、鳳姐、秦氏等抹骨牌，不在話下。,"Saying that, he went out and brought in a young born, slightly thinner than Baoyu, with clear eyebrows, pink face and red lips, a handsome figure, and a romantic demeanor. , shy and vague, and greeted Sister Feng with a bow. Sister Feng happily pushed Baoyu first and smiled, ""Let's go on!"" She bowed and took the boy's hand, and ordered him to sit beside him, slowly asking him about his age, reading, etc., before he knew the name of the school Qin Zhong. Sister Feng's maids and daughters-in-law saw that Sister Feng was meeting Qin Zhong for the first time, but they didn't prepare the courtesy, so they hurried over there and told Ping'er. Ping'er knew that Sister Feng and the Qin family were very close, and even though they were young, they should not be too frugal, so she made up her own mind and took a chi head and two ""Zhuang Yuan and Di"" small gold coins and handed them over to someone who came to send them over. . Sister Feng still laughed and said ""too simple and thin"". Qin Shi and others thanked them, and when they finished their meal, You Shi, Sister Feng, Qin Shi and others played dominoes, no problem.","In a short while she did in fact lead in a young lad, who, compared with Pao-yue, was somewhat more slight but, from all appearances, superior to Pao-yue in eyes and eyebrows, (good looks), which were so clear and well-defined, in white complexion and in ruddy lips, as well as graceful appearance and pleasing manners. He was however bashful and timid, like a girl. In a shy and demure way, he made a bow to lady Feng and asked after her health. Lady Feng was simply delighted with him. “You take a low seat next to him!” she ventured laughingly as she first pushed Pao-yue back. Then readily stooping forward, she took this lad by the hand and asked him to take a seat next to her. Presently she inquired about his age, his studies and such matters, when she found that at school he went under the name of Ch’in Chung. The matrons and maids in attendance on lady Feng, perceiving that this was the first time their mistress met Ch’in Chung, (and knowing) that she had not at hand the usual presents, forthwith ran over to the other side and told P’ing Erh about it. P’ing Erh, aware of the close intimacy that existed between lady Feng and Mrs. Ch’in, speedily took upon herself to decide, and selecting a piece of silk, and two small gold medals, (bearing the wish that he should attain) the highest degree, the senior wranglership, she handed them to the servants who had come over, to take away. Lady Feng, however, explained that her presents were too mean by far, but Mrs. Ch’in and the others expressed their appreciation of them; and in a short time the repast was over, and Mrs. Yu, lady Feng and Mrs. Ch’in played at dominoes, but of this no details need be given; while both Pao-yue and Ch’in Chung sat down, got up and talked, as they pleased.","They both laughed, and Jia Rong disappeared for a while and presently came back leading a youth who, though somewhat thinner than Bao-yu, was more than his equal in freshness and liveliness of feature, in delicacy of complexion, handsomeness of figure, and grace of deportment, but whose painful bashfulness created a somewhat girlish impression. He approached Xi-feng and made his bow with a shy confusion which delighted her. ‘You’ve met your match!’ she said to Bao-yu with a laugh, nudging him playfully. Then, leaning forward and gripping the boy’s hand in her own, she drew him down beside her and proceeded in a very deliberate manner to ask him how old he was, what books he was reading, and various other matters -among them his name, which was Qin Zhong. When the maids and womenfolk in attendance on Xi-feng realized that she was about to meet Qin Zhong and that they had come without the requisite material for a First Meeting present, they had sent some of their number back to consult Patience in the other house. Patience had, at her own discretion, selected a suitable length of material and two little ‘Top of the List’ solid gold medallions to give the messengers. These gifts now arrived for Xi-feng (who thought them somewhat on the meagre side) to give to Qin Zhong. When he and his sister had formally thanked her, the company sat down to lunch, after which You-shi, Xi-feng and Qin-shi settled down to a game of cards, while Bao-yu and Qin Zhong left the table to converse elsewhere."

衹是薛蟠起初之心，原不欲在賈宅居住者，但恐姨父管約拘禁，料必不自在的；無奈母親執意在此，且宅中又十分殷勤苦留，只得暫且住下，一面使人打掃出自己的房屋，再移居過去的。誰知自從在此住了不上一月的光景，賈宅族中凡有的子侄，俱已認熟了一半，凡是那些紈袴氣習者，莫不喜與他來往，今日會酒，明日觀花，甚至聚賭嫖娼，漸漸無所不至，引誘的薛蟠比當日更壞了十倍。雖然賈政訓子有方，治家有法，一則族大人多，照管不到這些；二則現任族長乃是賈珍，彼乃寧府長孫，又現襲職，凡族中事，自有他掌管；三則公私冗雜，且素性瀟灑，不以俗務為要，每公暇之時，不過看書著棋而已，餘事多不介意。況且這梨香院相隔兩層房舍，又有街門另開，任意可以出入，所以這些子弟們竟可以放意暢懷的，因此遂將移居之念漸漸打滅了。,"It's just that Xue Pan didn't want to live in Jia's house at first, but he was afraid that his uncle would be detained, and he would not be comfortable. On the one hand, people clean out their houses and move to the past. Who knows that since they lived here for less than a month, all the sons and nephews of the Jia family have already known half of them. Those who are sloppy and habitual, do not like to associate with him. They can drink today and watch tomorrow. Flowers, even gambling and whoring, gradually became omnipresent, and the seduced Xue Pan was ten times worse than that day. Although Jia Zhengxun is well-mannered and has laws in running the family, one is that there are many adults in the clan, and they cannot take care of them; the other is that the current patriarch is Jia Zhen, who is the eldest grandson of the Ningfu, and is currently holding the post. In charge; third, the public and private are redundant, and the element is unrestrained, and does not focus on common affairs. Every time in public spare time, it is just reading books and playing chess, and I don’t mind the rest. Moreover, this Lixiangyuan is separated by two floors of buildings, and the street door is opened separately, so they can come and go at will, so these children can relax, so the idea of migrating is gradually extinguished.","Hsueeh P’an however had all along from the first instance, been loth to live in the Chia mansion, as he dreaded that with the discipline enforced by his uncle, he would not be able to be his own master; but his mother had made up her mind so positively to remain there, and what was more, every one in the Chia mansion was most pressing in their efforts to keep them, that there was no alternative for him but to take up his quarters temporarily there, while he at the same time directed servants to go and sweep the apartments of their own house, with a view that they should move into them when they were ready. But, contrary to expectation, after they had been in their quarters for not over a month, Hsueeh P’an came to be on intimate relations with all the young men among the kindred of the Chia mansion, the half of whom were extravagant in their habits, so that great was, of course, his delight to frequent them. To-day, they would come together to drink wine; the next day to look at flowers. They even assembled to gamble, to dissipate and to go everywhere and anywhere; leading, with all their enticements, Hsueeh P’an so far astray, that he became far worse, by a hundred times, than he was hitherto. Although it must be conceded that Chia Cheng was in the education of his children quite correct, and in the control of his family quite systematic, yet in the first place, the clan was so large and the members so numerous, that he was unable to attend to the entire supervision; and, in the second place, the head of the family, at this period, was Chia Chen, who, as the eldest grandchild of the Ning mansion, had likewise now come into the inheritance of the official status, with the result that all matters connected with the clan devolved upon his sole and exclusive control. In the third place, public as well as private concerns were manifold and complex, and being a man of negligent disposition, he estimated ordinary affairs of so little consequence that any respite from his official duties he devoted to no more than the study of books and the playing of chess. Furthermore, this Pear Fragrance Court was separated by two rows of buildings from his quarters and was also provided with a separate door opening into the street, so that, being able at their own heart’s desire to go out and to come in, these several young fellows could well indulge their caprices, and gratify the bent of their minds. Hence it was that Hsueeh P’an, in course of time gradually extinguished from his memory every idea of shifting their quarters. But what transpired, on subsequent days, the following chapter will explain.","The only dissatisfied member of the party – to begin with, at any rate – was Xue Pan. He had not wanted to stay in the Jia household, fearing that his uncle’s control would prevent him from enjoying himself, but what with his mother’s obstinacy and the insistence of the Jias themselves, he was obliged to acquiesce in settling there for the time being, contenting himself with sending some of his people to clean up one of their houses outside so that he would be able to move there later on. But, to his pleasant surprise, he discovered that the young males of the Jia establishment, half of whom he was already on familiar terms with before he had been there a month, were of the same idle, extravagant persuasion as himself and thought him a capital fellow and boon companion. And so he found himself meeting them for a drinking-party one day, for theatre-going the next, on a third day perhaps gambling with them or visiting brothels. For there were no limits to the depravity of their pleasures, and Xue Pan, who was bad enough to start with, soon became ten times worse under their expert guidance. It was not that Jia Zheng was a slack disciplinarian, incapable of keeping his house in order; but the clan was so numerous that he simply could not keep an eye on everyone at once. And in any case the nominal head of the family was not Jia Zheng but Cousin Zhen who, as eldest grandson of the senior, Ning-guo branch, had inherited the founder’s office and emoluments and was therefore officially in charge of all the clan’s affairs. Besides, Jia Zheng was kept busy with public and private business of his own and, being by nature a quiet, retiring man who attached little importance to mundane affairs, tended to use whatever leisure time he had for reading and playing Go. Then again, the Pear Tree Court was two courtyards away from Jia Zheng’s compound and had its own private door onto the street by which Xue Pan could come and go as he pleased, so that he and his young cronies could enjoy themselves to their heart’s content with no one being any the wiser. Under these agreeable ‘circumstances Xue Pan gradually abandoned all thought of moving out. But as to the outcome of these capers: that will be told in a later chapter."
尤氏聽了，心中甚喜，因說道：「後日是太爺的壽日，到底怎麼辦？」賈珍說道：「我方纔到了太爺那裏去請安，兼請太爺來家來受一受一家子的禮。太爺因說道：『我是清淨慣了的，我不願意往你們那是非場中去鬧去。你們必定說是我的生日，要叫我去受眾人些頭，莫過你把我從前注的《陰騭文》給我令人好好的寫出來刻了，比叫我無故受眾人的頭還強百倍呢。倘或後日這兩日一家子要來，你就在家裏好好的款待他們就是了。也不必給我送什麼東西來，連你後日也不必來；你要心中不安，你今日就給我磕了頭去。倘或後日你要來，又跟隨多少人來鬧我，我必和你不依。』如此說了又說，後日我是再不敢去的了。且叫來昇來，吩咐他預備兩日的筵席。」尤氏因叫人叫了賈蓉來：「吩咐來昇照舊例預備兩日的筵席，要豐豐富富的。你再親自到西府裏去請老太太、大太太、二太太和你璉二嬸子來逛逛。你父親今日又聽見一個好大夫，業已打發人請去了，想必明日必來。你可將他這些日子的病症細細的告訴他。」,"When You heard this, she was very happy, because she said, ""The day after tomorrow is the grandfather's birthday, what should I do?"" Jia Zhen said, ""I just went to the grandfather's place to say goodbye, and I also invited the grandfather to come to the house to receive the care of the whole family. The grandfather said, ""I'm used to being clean, and I don't want to make trouble in your right and wrong field. You must say it's my birthday, and you want me to go to the audience to talk to people. The Annotated ""Yin Shi Wen"" has been well written and engraved for me, and it is a hundred times better than the head of the audience without a reason. If the family is coming in the next two days, you can treat them well at home. You don't have to bring me anything, and you don't even have to come the day after. If you feel uneasy, you kowtow to me today. If you want to come the day after, and how many people follow me to trouble me, I will be with you. No.” After saying this, I will not dare to go in the day after tomorrow. I also called Laisheng and ordered him to prepare a feast for two days.” You Shiyin asked Jia Rong to come, “Order Laisheng as usual. Prepare a feast for two days. It must be rich. You go to the West Mansion and invite the old lady, the eldest lady, the second lady and your second aunt to go shopping. Your father heard another good doctor today, and he has already sent someone to invite him. He has gone, and he must come tomorrow. You can tell him the details of his symptoms these days.”","Mrs. Yu was very much cheered when she heard what was said. “The day after to-morrow,” she felt obliged to add, “is again our senior’s, Mr. Chia Ching’s birthday, and how are we to celebrate it after all?” “I’ve just been over to our Senior’s and paid my respects,” replied Chia Chen, “and further invited the old gentleman to come home, and receive the congratulations of the whole family. “‘I’m accustomed,’ our Senior explained, ‘to peace and quiet, and have no wish to go over to that worldly place of yours; for you people are certain to have published that it’s my birthday, and to entertain the design to ask me to go round to receive the bows of the whole lot of you. But won’t it be better if you were to give the “Record of Meritorious Acts,” which I annotated some time ago, to some one to copy out clean for me, and have it printed? Compared with asking me to come, and uselessly receive the obeisances of you all, this will be yea even a hundred times more profitable! In the event of the whole family wishing to pay me a visit on any of the two days, tomorrow or the day after to-morrow, if you were to stay at home and entertain them in proper style, that will be all that is wanted; nor will there be any need to send me anything! Even you needn’t come two days from this; and should you not feel contented at heart, well, you had better bow your head before me to-day before you go. But if you do come again the day after to-morrow, with a lot of people to disturb me, I shall certainly be angry with you.’ After what he said, I will not venture to go and see him two days hence; but you had better send for Lai Sheng, and bid him get ready a banquet to continue for a couple of days.” Mrs. Yu, having asked Chia Jung to come round, told him to direct Lai Sheng to make the usual necessary preparations for a banquet to last for a couple of days, with due regard to a profuse and sumptuous style. “You go by-and-by,” (she advised him), “in person to the Western Mansion and invite dowager lady Chia, mesdames Hsing and Wang, and your sister-in-law Secunda lady Lien to come over for a stroll. Your father has also heard of a good doctor, and having already sent some one to ask him round, I think that by tomorrow he’s sure to come; and you had better tell him, in a minute manner, the serious symptoms of her ailment during these few days.”","You-shi was delighted with this news. ‘And what are we going to do about Father’s birthday?’ she asked. ‘It’s the day after tomorrow.’ ‘I’ve just been out to see him,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘and I took the opportunity while I was there of asking him if he would come over on his birthday to receive everyone’s kotows, but he refused. He said, “I’ve got used to the peace and quiet of the monastery and I’m not willing to go back into your quarrelsome world again. If you insist on celebrating my birthday it would be a hundred times better to have my tract on Divine Rewards written out by a good calligrapher and cut on blocks for printing than to drag me back to your house for a lot of senseless head-knocking.” He said, “If the family turn up tomorrow and the day after for my birthday, you can give them a party yourself. But don’t go sending me any presents,” he said, “and don’t come yourself! If it will set your mind at rest you can give me a kotow now and get it over with. But if you come round here the day after tomorrow with a lot of other people to pester me, I shall refuse to see you.” Well, after that I obviously can’t go again on his birthday. We’d better have Lai Sheng in and make arrangements for two days’ entertainment.’ You-shi called in Jia Rong. ‘Tell Lai Sheng to prepare the usual two-day party for Grandfather,’ she said. ‘Say we want a really good spread. We shall be asking Lady Jia and Sir Zheng and Lady Wang and your Auntie Lian from the other house: you can go round yourself to invite them. ‘And by the way: today your father heard of a good doctor and has already sent someone to ask him round. He should be coming tomorrow. When he does, you had better tell him exactly what your wife’s symptoms have been during the past few days.’"
卜世仁道：「我的兒，舅舅要有，還不是該的。我天天和你舅母說，只愁你沒算計兒。你但凡立的起來，到你大房裏，就是他們爺兒們見不著，便下個氣，和他們的管家或者管事的人們嬉和嬉和，也弄個事兒管管。前日我出城去，撞見了你們三房裏的老四，騎著大叫驢，帶著五輛車，有四五十和尚道士，往家廟去了。他那不虧能幹，這事就到他了！」,"Bu Shiren said: ""My son, it's not right for my uncle to have it. I tell your aunt every day, I'm just worried that you don't have a plan. Whenever you stand up and go to your big room, the fathers and sons won't be able to see them. , then get angry, play and have fun with their housekeepers or the people in charge, and also manage things. I went out of the city the day before yesterday, and ran into the fourth child in your third room, riding a screaming donkey, with five In the car, there are forty or fifty monks and Taoist priests, going to the temple. He is not bad at what he can do, and this matter is up to him!""","“My dear child,” Pu Shih-jen exclaimed, “had I anything that I could call my own, your uncle as I am, wouldn’t I feel bound to do something for you? I’ve day after day mentioned to your aunt that the misfortune was that you had no resources. But should you ever succeed in making up your mind, you should go into that mighty household of yours, and when the gentlemen aren’t looking, forthwith pocket your pride and hobnob with those managers, or possibly with the butlers, as you may, even through them, be able to get some charge or other! The other day, when I was out of town, I came across that old Quartus of the third branch of the family, astride of a tall donkey, at the head of four or five carriages, in which were about forty to fifty bonzes and Taoist priests on their way to the family fane, and that man can’t lack brains, for such a charge to have fallen to his share!” Chia Yuen, upon hearing these words, indulged in a long and revolting rigmarole, and then got up to take his leave. “What are you in such a hurry for?”","‘My dear boy,’ said Bu Shi-ren, ‘if I had it to give, you should have it and welcome! Your trouble is, though, as I’m always telling your Aunt, you won’t think ahead. If only you’d pull yourself together and go and have a word with your Father’s folk at the big house – or if you can’t get to see them, put your pride in your pocket and make yourself agreeable to some of the stewards there – get yourself a job of some kind! When I was on my way out of the city the other day, I ran into that cousin of yours from North Street riding on a donkey with four or five carriages behind him and fifty or sixty nuns on his way to your family temple out in the country. Now that’s a shrewd young fellow! You can’t tell me he got that job by doing nothing!’"
那寶玉剛合上眼，便惚惚的睡去，猶似秦氏在前，遂悠悠蕩蕩，隨了秦氏，至一所在。但見朱欄白石，綠樹清溪，真是人跡希逢，飛塵不到，寶玉在夢中歡喜，想道：「這個去處有趣，我就在這裏過一生，縱然失了家也願意，強如天天被父母師傅打呢。」正胡思之間，忽聽山後有人作歌曰：「春夢隨雲散，飛花逐水流；寄言眾兒女，何必覓閑愁。」,"As soon as that Baoyu closed his eyes, he fell asleep in a trance, as if the Qin family was in front of him. But seeing Zhulan Baishi, green trees and clear streams, it is really a rare encounter with people, and there is no flying dust. Baoyu rejoiced in the dream and thought: ""This place is interesting, I will live here all my life, even if I lose my home, I am willing to be strong. It’s like being beaten by your parents and masters every day.” While thinking about it, someone from the back of the mountain suddenly heard a song saying: “Spring dreams follow the clouds, and flying flowers follow the water; I send a message to all my children, why should I look for leisure and sorrow.”","Pao-yue then closed his eyes, and, little by little, became drowsy, and fell asleep. It seemed to him just as if Mrs. Ch’in was walking ahead of him. Forthwith, with listless and unsettled step, he followed Mrs. Ch’in to some spot or other, where he saw carnation-like railings, jade-like steps, verdant trees and limpid pools--a spot where actually no trace of any human being could be met with, where of the shifting mundane dust little had penetrated. Pao-yue felt, in his dream, quite delighted. “This place,” he mused, “is pleasant, and I may as well spend my whole lifetime in here! though I may have to lose my home, I’m quite ready for the sacrifice, for it’s far better being here than being flogged, day after day, by father, mother, and teacher.” While he pondered in this erratic strain, he suddenly heard the voice of some human being at the back of the rocks, giving vent to this song: Like scattering clouds doth fleet a vernal dream; The transient flowers pass like a running stream; Maidens and youths bear this, ye all, in mind; In useless grief what profit will ye find?","As soon as Bao-yu closed his eyes he sank into a confused sleep in -which Qin-shi was still there yet at the same time seemed to be drifting along weightlessly in front of him. He followed her until they came to a place of marble terraces and vermilion balustrades where there were green trees and crystal streams. Everything in this place was so clean and so pure that it seemed as if no human foot could ever have trodden there or floating speck of dust ever blown into it. Bao-yu’s dreaming self rejoiced. ‘What a delightful place!’ he thought. ‘If only I could spend all my life here! How much nicer it would be than living under the daily restraint of my parents and teachers!’ These idle reflections were interrupted by someone singing a song on the other side of a hill: ‘Spring’s dream-time will like drifting clouds disperse, Its flowers snatched by a flood none can reverse. Then tell each nymph and swain ‘Tis folly to invite love’s pain!’"
那道人又是怎生模樣：一足高來一足低，渾身帶水又拖泥。相逢若問家何處，卻在蓬萊弱水西。,"How did the Taoist look like: one foot high and one foot low, covered in water and mud. When we meet, if you ask where your home is, it is in Ruoshuixi, Penglai.","And the Taoist priest, what was he like? With one leg perched high he comes, with one leg low; His whole frame drenching wet, bespattered all with mud. If you perchance meet him, and ask him where’s his home, “In fairyland, west of the ‘Weak Water,’ he’ll say.”","Up, down he hopped on his unequal legs, From mud and puddle not a stitch left dry. Yet, if you asked him where his dwelling"
自此以後，他二人同來同往，同坐同起，愈加親密。又兼賈母愛惜，也時常的留下秦鍾，住上三天五日，與自己的重孫一般疼愛。因見秦鍾不甚寬裕，更又助他些衣履等物，不上一月工夫，秦鍾在榮府便熟了。,"Since then, the two of them have come and gone together, sat together, and have become more intimate. He was also cherished by Jia's mother, and often left Qin Zhong to live for three days and five days, loving him as much as his great-grandson. Seeing that Qin Zhong was not very well-off, he even helped him with clothes and shoes. In less than a month, Qin Zhong became acquainted in the Rong Mansion.","Ever since this time, these two were wont to come together, go together, get up together, and sit together, till they became more intimate and close. Besides, dowager lady Chia got very fond of Ch’in Chung, and would again and again keep him to stay with them for three and five days at a time, treating him as if he were one of her own great-grandsons. Perceiving that in Ch’in Chung’s home there was not much in the way of sufficiency, she also helped him in clothes and other necessaries; and scarcely had one or two months elapsed before Ch’in Chung got on friendly terms with every one in the Jung mansion.","From now on the two friends were inseparable, arriving at school and leaving school together and sitting beside each other in class. Grandmother Jia herself became very fond of Qin Zhong. She was always having him to stay for three or four nights at a time and treated him exactly as if he were one of her own great-grandchildren. And because she realized that his family was not very well off, she frequently helped out with clothes and the like. Within a month or two he was a familiar and accepted member of the Rong household."
道人道：「既如此，便隨你去來。」,"The Taoist said, ""If that's the case, then come as you go.""","“Such being the case,” the Taoist acquiesced, “I am ready to follow you, whenever you please to go.”","‘Very good, I will go with you then,’ said the Taoist."
卻說嬌杏這丫鬟，便是那年回顧雨村者。因偶然一顧，便弄出這段事來，亦是自己意料不到之奇緣。誰想他命運兩濟，不承望自到雨村身邊，只一年便生了一子；又半載，雨村嫡妻忽染疾下世，雨村便將他扶側作正室夫人了。正是：偶因一着巧，便為人上人。,"But she said that Jiao Xing, the maid, was the one who looked back at Yu Village that year. It is also a strange coincidence that I did not expect this incident because of accidental glances. Who would have thought that his fate would be better, and he did not expect to come to Yucun's side, and he gave birth to a son in just one year; after half a year, Yucun's first-in-class wife suddenly died of an illness, and Yucun put him on his side as the main wife. Exactly: Occasionally, because of a coincidence, he is a superior person.","It must be explained, however, that the maid Chi’ao Hsing was the very person, who, a few years ago, had looked round at Yue-ts’un and who, by one simple, unpremeditated glance, evolved, in fact, this extraordinary destiny which was indeed an event beyond conception. Who would ever have foreseen that fate and fortune would both have so favoured her that she should, contrary to all anticipation, give birth to a son, after living with Yue-ts’un barely a year, that in addition to this, after the lapse of another half year, Yue-ts’un’s wife should have contracted a sudden illness and departed this life, and that Yue-ts’un should have at once raised her to the rank of first wife. Her destiny is adequately expressed by the lines: Through but one single, casual look Soon an exalted place she took.","Lucky was, of course, the maid who had once turned back to look at Yu-cun when they were living at the house in Soochow. She could scarcely have foreseen at the time what singular good fortune that one glance would procure for her. But she was destined to be doubly fortunate. She had not been with Yu-cun more than a year when she gave birth to a son; and a mere six months later Yu-cun’s first wife died, whereupon Lucky was promoted to fill her place and became Her Ladyship. As the proverb says, Sometimes by chance A look or a glance May one’s fortune advance."
歌畢，還要歌副曲。警幻見寶玉甚無趣味，因嘆：「癡兒竟尚未悟！」那寶玉忙止歌姬不必再唱，自覺朦朧恍惚，告醉求臥。警幻便命撤去殘席，送寶玉至一香閨繡閣之中，其間鋪陳之盛，乃素所未見之物。更可駭者，早有一位女子在內，其鮮艷嫵媚，有似乎寶釵，風流裊娜，則又如黛玉。正不知何意，忽警幻道：「塵世中多少富貴之家，那些綠窗風月，繡閣煙霞，皆被婬污紈袴與那些流蕩女子悉皆玷辱。更可恨者，自古來多少輕薄浪子，皆以『好色不婬』為飾，又以『情而不婬』作案，此皆飾非掩醜之語也。好色．即婬，知情更婬。是以巫山之會，雲雨之歡，皆由既悅其色、復戀其情所致也，吾所愛汝者，乃天下古今第一婬人也。」,"After the song is over, there is also a sub-song. The police fancied that Baoyu was not very interesting, because he sighed: ""I don't know yet!"" The Baoyu hurriedly stopped the singer and did not need to sing any more. Jing Huan ordered to remove the rest of the seats, and sent Baoyu to a fragrant boudoir embroidery pavilion, where it was laid out in abundance, something that had never been seen before. Even more frightening, there was already a woman in it. She was bright and charming, she looked like a treasured hairpin, and she was like Daiyu. I didn't know what it meant when I suddenly warned and said: ""How many rich and noble houses in the world, those green windows, wind and moon, embroidered pavilions and haze, have all been humiliated by lewd scumbags and those wandering women. What's more hateful, how many frivolous prodigal sons from ancient times, They are all dressed up with ""lust but not lewd"" and commit crimes with ""love but not lewdness"". These are all disguised words that do not hide their ugliness. Lust is lewdness, and knowledge is even more lewd. Therefore, the meeting of Wushan and the joy of cloud and rain are all It is because of the fact that I am pleased with her sex, and I love her again, and the person I love you is the number one prostitute in the world.”","When the maidens had finished the ballads, they went on to sing the “Supplementary Record;” but the Monitory Vision Fairy, perceiving the total absence of any interest in Pao-yue, heaved a sigh. “You silly brat!” she exclaimed. “What! haven’t you, even now, attained perception!” “There’s no need for you to go on singing,” speedily observed Pao-yue, as he interrupted the singing maidens; and feeling drowsy and dull, he pleaded being under the effects of wine, and begged to be allowed to lie down. The Fairy then gave orders to clear away the remains of the feast, and escorted Pao-yue to a suite of female apartments, where the splendour of such objects as were laid out was a thing which he had not hitherto seen. But what evoked in him wonder still more intense, was the sight, at an early period, of a girl seated in the room, who, in the freshness of her beauty and winsomeness of her charms, bore some resemblance to Pao-ch’ai, while, in elegance and comeliness, on the other hand, to Tai-yu. While he was plunged in a state of perplexity, the Fairy suddenly remarked: “All those female apartments and ladies’ chambers in so many wealthy and honourable families in the world are, without exception, polluted by voluptuous opulent puppets and by all that bevy of profligate girls. But still more despicable are those from old till now numberless dissolute roues, one and all of whom maintain that libidinous affections do not constitute lewdness; and who try, further, to prove that licentious love is not tantamount to lewdness. But all these arguments are mere apologies for their shortcomings, and a screen for their pollutions; for if libidinous affection be lewdness, still more does the perception of licentious love constitute lewdness. Hence it is that the indulgence of sensuality and the gratification of licentious affection originate entirely from a relish of lust, as well as from a hankering after licentious love. Lo you, who are the object of my love, are the most lewd being under the heavens from remote ages to the present time!”","Having reached the end of this suite, the singers showed signs of embarking on another one. Disenchantment observed with a sigh that Bao-yu was dreadfully bored. ‘Silly boy! You still don’t understand, do you?’ Bao-yu hurriedly stopped the girls and told them that they need not sing any more. He felt dizzy and his head was spinning. He explained to Disenchantment that he had drunk too much and would like to lie down. At once she ordered the remains of the feast to be removed and conducted Bao-yu to a dainty bedroom. The furnishings and hangings of the bed were more sumptuous and beautiful than anything he had ever seen. To his intense surprise there was a fairy girl sitting in the middle of it. Her rose-fresh beauty reminded him strongly of Bao-chai, but there was also something about her of Dai-yu’s delicate charm. As he was pondering the meaning of this apparition, he suddenly became aware that Disenchantment was addressing him. ‘In the rich and noble households of your mortal world, too many of those bowers and boudoirs where innocent tenderness and sweet girlish fantasy should reign are injuriously defiled by coarse young voluptuaries and loose, wanton girls. And what is even more detestable, there are always any number of worthless philanderers to protest that it is woman’s beauty alone that inspires them, or loving feelings alone, unsullied by any taint of lust. They lie in their teeth! To be moved by woman’s beauty is itself a kind of lust. To experience loving feelings is, even more assuredly, a kind of lust. Every act of love, every carnal congress of the sexes is brought about precisely because sensual delight in beauty has kindled the feeling of love. ‘The reason I like you so much is because you are full of lust. You are the most lustful person I have ever known in the whole world!’"

You have to decide what to do, otherwise the money will come to our house by yourself?"" Gou'er sneered: ""I have a way to wait until now. Relatives who don’t collect taxes, friends who are officials, what can they think of? If there are, I’m afraid they may not come to us!”","“Who tells you to become a robber?” asked goody Liu. “But it would be well, after all, that we should put our heads together and devise some means; for otherwise, is the money, pray, able of itself to run into our house?” “Had there been a way,” observed Kou Erh, smiling sarcastically, “would I have waited up to this moment? I have besides no revenue collectors as relatives, or friends in official positions; and what way could we devise? ‘But even had I any , they wouldn’t be likely, I fear, to pay any heed to such as ourselves!”","‘No one’s asking you to rob,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘But can’t we all sit down peaceably and think of a way ? Because if we don’t, the money isn’t going to come walking in the door of its own accord.’ Gou-er snorted sarcastically. ‘If there were a way, do you suppose I should have waited till now before trying it out ? There are no tax-collectors in my family and no mandarins among my friends. What way could there be of laying my hands on some money ? Even if I did have rich friends or relations, I’m not so sure they would want to be bothered with the likes of us.’"
第四回中既將薛家母子在榮府內寄居等事略已表明，此回則暫不能寫矣。,"In the fourth chapter, since the Xue family's mother and son's sojourn in the Rong Mansion and other matters have been briefly stated, this time cannot be written for the time being.","Having in the fourth Chapter explained, to some degree, the circumstances attending the settlement of the mother and children of the Hsueeh family in the Jung mansion, and other incidental matters, we will now revert to Lin Tai-yue.",And the fairy Disenchantment performs the

Then he also recited a guess with Jia Mu, and recited: ""The body is square, and the body is hard. Even if you can't speak, you will answer if you say it. - Hit an object.""","Chia Cheng was already aware that it was a lichee, but he designedly made a few guesses at random, and was fined several things; but he subsequently gave, at length, the right answer, and also obtained a present from her ladyship. In due course he too set forth this conundrum for old lady Chia to guess: Correct its body is in appearance, Both firm and solid is it in substance; To words, it is true, it cannot give vent, But spoken to, it always does assent.","Jia Zheng knew that the answer to this hoary old chestnut was ‘a longan’ (long ‘un), but pretended not to, and made all kinds of absurd guesses, each time incurring the obligation to pay his mother a forfeit, before finally giving the right answer and receiving the old lady’s prize. Then he propounded a riddle of his own for her: ‘My body’s square, Iron-hard am I. I speak no word, But words supply. - It’s a useful object.’"

原來這李氏即賈珠之妻。雖然亡夫，幸存一子，取名賈蘭，今方五歲，已入學攻書。這李氏亦係金陵名宦之女，父名李守中，曾為國子監祭酒，族中男女無有不誦詩讀書者。至李守中承繼以來，便說「女子無才便有德」，故生了李氏時，便不十分令其讀書，只不過將些《女四書》、《列女傳》《賢媛集》等三四種書，使他認得幾個字，記得前朝這幾個賢女便罷了，卻只以紡績井臼為要，因取名為李紈，字宮裁。因此這李紈雖青春喪偶，居家處膏粱錦繡之中，竟如槁木死灰一般，一概無見無聞，惟知侍親養子，外則陪侍小姑等針黹誦讀而已。今黛玉雖客寄於斯，日有這般姐妹相伴，除老父外，餘者也都無庸慮及了。,"It turns out that this Li family is Jia Zhu's wife. Although her husband was deceased, a son survived, named Jia Lan, who is now five years old and has already entered the school to study. This Li family is also the daughter of a famous eunuch in Jinling. Her father's name is Li Shouzhong. She once served as a sacrificial wine for Guozijian. Since Li Shouzhong's succession, he said, ""Women are virtuous without talents."" Therefore, when Li was born, he did not make him read very much. He waited for three or four books to make him recognize a few words, and it was enough to remember these virtuous women from the previous dynasty, but he only focused on spinning wells, because he was named Li Wan, and the word was Gongcai. Therefore, although Li Wan was young and widowed, and at home in the midst of splendid splendor, he was like a dead tree, and he had nothing to see or hear. He only knew how to take care of his relatives and adopted children. Today, although Daiyu is a guest in Sri Lanka, with such sisters accompanying her every day, apart from her old father, there is no need to think about the rest.","This Mrs. Li had originally been the spouse of Chia Chu. Although Chu had died at an early age, he had the good fortune of leaving behind him a son, to whom the name of Chia Lan was given. He was, at this period, just in his fifth year, and had already entered school, and applied himself to books. This Mrs. Li was also the daughter of an official of note in Chin Ling. Her father’s name was Li Shou-chung, who had, at one time, been Imperial Libationer. Among his kindred, men as well as women had all devoted themselves to poetry and letters; but ever since Li Shou-chung continued the line of succession, he readily asserted that the absence of literary attainments in his daughter was indeed a virtue, so that it soon came about that she did not apply herself in real earnest to learning; with the result that all she studied were some parts of the “Four Books for women,” and the “Memoirs of excellent women,” that all she read did not extend beyond a limited number of characters, and that all she committed to memory were the examples of these few worthy female characters of dynasties of yore; while she attached special importance to spinning and female handiwork. To this reason is to be assigned the name selected for her, of Li Wan (Li, the weaver), and the style of Kung Ts’ai (Palace Sempstress). Hence it was that, though this Li Wan still continued, after the loss of her mate, while she was as yet in the spring of her life, to live amidst affluence and luxury, she nevertheless resembled in every respect a block of rotten wood or dead ashes. She had no inclination whatsoever to inquire after anything or to listen to anything; while her sole and exclusive thought was to wait upon her relatives and educate her son; and, in addition to this, to teach her young sisters-in-law to do needlework and to read aloud. Tai-yue was, it is true, at this period living as a guest in the Chia mansion, where she certainly had the several young ladies to associate with her, but, outside her aged father, (she thought) there was really no need for her to extend affection to any of the rest.","Li Wan’s husband Jia Zhu had died young, but fortunately not without issue. He left her a son called Jia Lan who was now just five years old and had already begun his schooling. Like most of the Jia women, Li Wan was the daughter of a distinguished Nanking official. Her father, Li Shou-zhong, had been a Director of Education. Up to Li Shou-zhong’s time, all members of the clan, including the women, had been given a first-class education; but when Li Shou-zhong became head of the family, he founded his educational policy for girls on the good old maxim ‘a stupid woman is a virtuous one’ and, when he had a daughter of his own, refused to let her engage in serious study. She was permitted to work her way through The Four Books for Girls and Lives of Noble Women, so that she might be able to recognize a few characters and be familiar with some of the models of female virtue of former ages; but overriding importance was to be attached to spinning and sewing, and even her name ‘Wan’, which means a kind of silk, was intended to symbolize her dedication to the needle. Thanks to her upbringing, this young widow living in the midst of luxury and self-indulgence was able to keep herself like the ‘withered tree and dead ashes’ of the philosopher, shutting out everything that did not concern her and attending only to the duties of serving her husband’s parents and bringing up her child. Whatever leisure this left her was devoted to her little sister-in-law and cousins, accompanying them at their embroidery or hearing them recite their lessons. With such gentle companions to console her, Dai-yu, though a stranger and far from home, soon had nothing apart from her old father that she need worry about."

那周瑞家的又和智能兒勞叨了一會，便往鳳姐兒處來。穿夾道從李紈後窗下過，隔著玻璃窗戶，見李紈在炕上歪著睡覺呢，遂越西花牆，出西角門進入鳳姐院中。走至堂屋，只見小丫頭豐兒坐在鳳姐的房門檻上，見周瑞家的來了，連忙擺手兒往東屋裏去。周瑞家的會意，慌的躡手躡足往東邊房裏，只見奶子正拍著大姐兒睡覺呢。周瑞家的悄問奶子道：「姐兒睡中覺呢？也該清醒了。」奶子搖頭兒。正問著，只聽那邊一陣笑聲，卻有賈璉的聲音。接著房門響處，平兒拿著大銅盆出來，叫豐兒舀水進去。平兒便到這邊來，一見了周瑞家的便問：「你老人家又跑了來作什麼？」周瑞家的忙起身，拿匣子與他，說送花兒一事。平兒聽了，便打開匣子，拿了四枝，轉身去了。半刻工夫，手裏又拿出兩枝來，先叫彩明來吩咐他：「送到那邊府裏給小蓉大奶奶戴去。」次後方命周瑞家的回去道謝。,"Then Zhou Rui's family chatted with Zhizhi'er for a while, and then came to Fengjie'er. Passing through Li Wan's back window through the passage, and across the glass window, seeing Li Wan sleeping on the kang crookedly, he then crossed the west flower wall, went out the west corner gate and entered Fengjie's courtyard. Walking to the main room, I saw the little girl Feng'er sitting on the threshold of Sister Feng's room. Seeing Zhou Rui's family coming, she quickly waved her hand and went to the east room. Zhou Rui's family knew it, and in a panic, he tiptoed to the east room, only to see that the tit was patting the eldest sister to sleep. Zhou Rui's family whispered to the aunt: ""Where is my sister sleeping? It's time to wake up."" The aunt shook her head. Just as he was asking, there was only a burst of laughter over there, but there was Jia Lian's voice. Then, at the sound of the door, Ping'er came out with a big copper basin and asked Feng'er to scoop water in. Ping'er came here, and when he saw Zhou Rui's family, he asked, ""What are you doing here again?"" Zhou Rui's family hurriedly got up, took the box and told him about sending flowers. When Ping'er heard this, he opened the box, took four sticks, and turned away. After half an hour, he took out two more sticks in his hand, and first called Cai Ming to instruct him: ""Send it to the manor over there for Grandma Xiao Rong to wear."" The second rear ordered Zhou Rui's family to go back and thank him.","Mrs. Chou then went on to bandy a few words with Chih Neng, after which she came over to lady Feng’s apartments. Proceeding by a narrow passage, she passed under Li Wan’s back windows, and went along the wall ornamented with creepers on the west. Going out of the western side gate, she entered lady Feng’s court, and walked over into the Entrance Hall, where she only found the waiting-girl Feng Erh, sitting on the doorsteps of lady Feng’s apartments. When she caught sight of Mrs. Chou approaching, she at once waved her hand, bidding her go to the eastern room. Chou Jui’s wife understood her meaning, and hastily came on tiptoe to the chamber on the east, where she saw a nurse patting lady Feng’s daughter to sleep. Mrs. Chou promptly asked the nurse in a low tone of voice: “Is the young lady asleep at this early hour? But if even she is I must wake her up.” The nurse nodded her head in assent, but as these inquiries were being made, a sound of laughter came from over the other side, in which lady Feng’s voice could be detected; followed, shortly after, by the sound of a door opening, and out came P’ing Erh, with a large brass basin in her hands, which she told Feng Erh to fill with water and take inside. P’ing Erh forthwith entered the room on this side, and upon perceiving Chou Jui’s wife: “ What have you come here again for, my old lady?” she readily inquired. Chou Jui’s wife rose without any delay, and handed her the box. “I’ve come,” said she, “to bring you a present of flowers.” Upon hearing this, P’ing Erh opened the box, and took out four sprigs, and, turning round, walked out of the room. In a short while she came from the inner room with two sprigs in her hand, and calling first of all Ts’ai Ming, she bade her take the flowers over to the mansion on the other side and present them to “madame” Jung, after which she asked Mrs. Chou to express her thanks on her return.","After gossiping a bit longer with Sapientia, Zhou Rui’s wife made her way to Xi-feng’s quarters. To get there she had to go down a passage-way between two walls, under the windows at the back of Li Wan’s apartments, along the foot of an ornamental wall, and through a gateway in the western corner of the compound. When she entered Xi-feng’s reception room, a maid sitting on the threshold of the inner room hurriedly waved her away and told her to go across to the other side of the house. Taking the hint, Zhou Rui’s wife tiptoed quietly into the room opposite, where she found the baby’s nurse patting her rhythmically to make her sleep. ‘Is the mistress taking her afternoon nap?’ she asked the nurse in a low whisper. ‘I think you’ll have to wake her, even if she is.’ The nurse smiled, grimaced, and shook her head. Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask her what she meant when she heard a low laugh in what was unmistakably Jia Lian’s voice from the room opposite. It was followed almost immediately by the sound of the door opening, and Patience came out carrying a large copper basin which she asked one of the maids to fetch water in. ‘Ah, Mrs Zhou!’ she said, catching sight of Zhou Rui’s wife and crossing into the room opposite. ‘What brings you back again ?’ Zhou Rui’s wife hastily rose to her feet and picking up the box, proferred it to Patience and explained her mission. Patience opened the lid, selected four of the flowers, and slipped away again for several minutes. She came back with two still in her hand, which she gave to a little page called Sunshine. ‘Take these to Master Rong’s wife over in the Ning mansion and tell her they are for her to wear,’ she said. Then turning to Zhou Rui’s wife she asked her to convey Xi-feng ’s thanks to the donor. Zhou Rui’s wife now made her way towards Grandmother Jia’s apartments."
鳳姐道：「噯！往蘇杭走了一趟回來，也該見些世面了，還是這麼眼饞肚飽的。你要愛他，不值什麼，我去拿平兒換了他來如何？那薛老大也是『喫著碗裏看著鍋裏』的，這一年來的光景，他為要香菱不能到手，和姨媽打了多少饑荒。也因姨媽看著香菱模樣兒好還是末則，其為人行事，卻又比別的女孩子不同，溫柔安靜，差不多的主子姑娘也跟他不上呢，故此擺酒請客的費事，明堂正道的與他作了妾。過了沒半月，也看的馬棚風一般了，我倒心裏可惜了的。」一語未了，二門上小廝傳報：「老爺在大書房等二爺呢。」賈璉聽了，忙忙整衣出去。,"Sister Feng said: ""Hey! After a trip to Suzhou and Hangzhou, it's time to see the world, but I'm still so hungry. If you love him, it's not worth anything. How about I go to Naping Ping'er and replace him? Then Boss Xue is also ""eating from the bowl and looking at the pot"". In the past year, he fought a lot of famine with his aunt to prevent Xiangling from being able to get it. It is also because the aunt looked good at Xiangling or the last thing. He acts as a man, but he is different from other girls. He is gentle and quiet, and the girls who are similar to the host can't match him. Therefore, it takes a lot of trouble to entertain guests. He is a concubine with him. It's a pity for me to see the stable wind."" Before he could say a word, the servant at the second door reported, ""Master is waiting for the second master in the big study.""","“Ai!” exclaimed lady Feng, “here you are back from a trip to Suchow and Hang Chow, where you should have seen something of the world! and have you still an eye as envious and a heart so covetous? Well, if you wish to bestow your love on her, there’s no difficulty worth speaking of. I’ll take P’ing Erh over and exchange her for her; what do you say to that? that old brother Hsueeh is also one of those men, who, while eating what there is in the bowl, keeps an eye on what there is in the pan! For the last year or so, as he couldn’t get Hsiang Ling to be his, he made ever so many distressing appeals to Mrs. Hsueeh; and Mrs. Hsueeh while esteeming Hsiang Ling’s looks, though fine, as after all a small matter, (thought) her deportment and conduct so far unlike those of other girls, so gentle and so demure that almost the very daughters of masters and mistresses couldn’t attain her standard, that she therefore went to the trouble of spreading a banquet, and of inviting guests, and in open court, and in the legitimate course, she gave her to him for a secondary wife. But half a month had scarcely elapsed before he looked upon her also as a good-for-nothing person as he did upon a large number of them! I can’t however help feeling pity for her in my heart.” Scarcely had she time to conclude what she had to say when a youth, on duty at the second gate, transmitted the announcement that Mr. Chia Cheng was in the Library waiting for Mr. Secundus.","Xi-feng made a little moue. ‘I should have thought that having just got back from Hangchow arid Soochow and seen something of the world, you would have settled down a bit; but I see you are still the same greedy-guts as ever. Well, if you want her, there’s nothing simpler : I’ll exchange our Patience for her. You know what Cousin Xue is like: always “one eye on the dish and the other on the saucepan”. Throughout the whole of this last year there have been I don’t know how many alarms and excursions between him and poor Aunt Xue because she wouldn’t let him get his hands on Caltrop. It wasn’t just her looks that made her concerned for the girl. Everything about her is so unusual. She is so gentle and so quiet. Even among our own young ladies there is scarcely her equal. In the end Aunt Xue decided that if she couldn’t stop him having her, at least she could make sure that the thing was done properly, with a party and invitations and all the rest of it. So that’s what she did, and made her his chamber wife. But would you believe it, before a fortnight had gone by he had completely lost interest…!’ She was interrupted by an announcement from one of the pages on the inner gate: ‘Mr Zhen wants you, sir. He’s waiting for you in the larger study.’ At once Jia Lian did up his gown and hurried out."
倏又臘盡春回，這病更又沉重。代儒也著了忙，各處請醫療治，皆不見效。因後來喫「獨參湯」，代儒如何有這力量，只得往榮府來尋。王夫人命鳳姐秤二兩給他，鳳姐回說：「前兒新近都替老太太配了藥，那整的太太又說留著送楊提督的太太配藥，偏生昨兒我已送了去了。」王夫人道：「就是咱們這邊沒了，你打發個人往你婆婆那邊問問，或是你珍大哥哥那府裏再尋些來，湊著給人家。喫好了，救人一命，也是你的好處。」鳳姐聽了，也不遣人去尋，只得將些渣末泡須湊了幾錢，命人送去，只說：「太太送來的，再也沒了。」然後回王夫人，只說：「都尋了來，共湊了有二兩送去。,"Soon after the wax was over, the spring returned, and the disease was even more serious. Dai Confucianism was also busy, and he sought medical treatment everywhere, but to no avail. Because he later ate ""Dou Shen Tang"", how did Dai Confucianism have this power, so he had to go to Rong Fu to find it. Mrs. Wang ordered Sister Feng to weigh two taels for him, and Ms. Feng replied, ""My former son has been dispensing medicine for the old lady recently, and the whole lady said that she kept the wife who sent it to Admiral Yang to dispense the medicine, but I had already delivered it yesterday. Mrs. Wang said, ""It's just that we're gone here. You can send someone to ask your mother-in-law, or find some more from your elder brother Zhen's house and give it to others. Eat it, save the life."" Your life is also your benefit."" Sister Feng heard this, and did not send anyone to look for it, so she collected some money and ordered someone to send it away, only to say, ""The one sent by my wife is no more. ."" Then back to Madam Wang, she only said, ""I've found them all, and I've collected a couple of taels to send.",", he took several tens of catties, he nevertheless experienced no change for the better; so that by the time the twelfth moon drew once again to an end, and spring returned, this illness had become still more serious. Tai-ju was very much concerned, and invited doctors from all parts to attend to him, but none of them could do him any good. And as later on, he had to take nothing else but decoctions of pure ginseng, Tai-ju could not of course afford it. Having no other help but to come over to the Jung mansion, and make requisition for some, Madame Wang asked lady Feng to weigh two taels of it and give it to him. “The other day,” rejoined lady Feng, “not long ago, when we concocted some medicine for our dowager lady, you told us, madame, to keep the pieces that were whole, to present to the spouse of General Yang to make physic with, and as it happens it was only yesterday that I sent some one round with them.” “If there’s none over here in our place,” suggested madame Wang, “just send a servant to your mother-in-law’s, on the other side, to inquire whether they have any. Or it may possibly be that your elder brother-in-law Chen, over there, might have a little. If so, put all you get together, and give it to them; and when he shall have taken it, and got well and you shall have saved the life of a human being, it will really be to the benefit of you all.” Lady Feng acquiesced; but without directing a single person to institute any search, she simply took some refuse twigs, and making up a few mace, she despatched them with the meagre message that they had been sent by madame Wang, and that there was, in fact, no more; subsequently reporting to madame Wang that she had asked for and obtained all there was and that she had collected as much as two taels, and forwarded it to them.","Winter went and spring came and Jia Rui’s sickness grew even worse. His grandfather Dai-ru was in despair. Medical advice from every quarter had been taken and none of it had proved effective. The most recent advice was that the patient should be given a pure decoction of ginseng without admixture of other ingredients. So costly a remedy was far beyond Dai-ru’s resources and he was obliged to go to the Rong-guo mansion to beg. Lady Wang ordered Wang Xi-feng to weigh out two ounces for him from their own supplies. ‘The other day when we were making up a new lot of pills for Grandmother,’ said Xi-feng, ‘you told me to keep any of the remaining whole roots for a medicine you were sending to General Yang’s wife. I sent her the medicine yesterday, so I am afraid we haven’t any left.’ ‘Well, even if we haven’t got any,’ said Lady Wang, ‘you can send to your mother-in-law’s for some; and probably they will have some at your Cousin Zhen’s. Between you you ought somehow or other to be able to raise enough to give him. If you can save a man’s life by doing so, you will have performed a work of merit.’ But though Xi-feng pretended to do as Lady Wang suggested, in fact she made no such inquiries. She merely scraped a few drams of broken bits together and sent them to Dai-ru with a message that’ Lady Wang had instructed her to send this, and it was all they had.’ To Lady Wang, however, she reported that she had asked the others and altogether obtained more than two ounces of ginseng which she had sent to Dai-ru."
自此滿心想鳳姐，只不敢往榮府去了。賈蓉兩個又常常的來索銀子，他又怕祖父知道，正是相思尚且難禁，更又添了債務；日間工課又緊，他二十來歲人，尚未娶親，邇來想著鳳姐，未免有那「指頭告了消乏」等事；更兼兩回凍惱奔波，因此三五下裏夾攻，不覺就得了一病：心內發膨脹，口中無滋味，腳下如綿，眼中似醉，黑夜作燒，白晝常倦，下溺連精，嗽痰帶血。諸如此症，不上一年都添全了。於是不能支持，一頭睡倒，合上眼還只夢魂顛倒，滿口亂說胡話，驚怖異常。百般請醫療治，諸如肉桂、附子、鱉甲、麥冬、玉竹等藥，喫了有幾十斤下去，也不見個動靜。,"Since then, I have been thinking about Sister Feng, but I dare not go to the Rong Mansion. Jia Rong often came to ask for money, and he was afraid that his grandfather would find out. It was lovesickness that he couldn't help but added to the debt; the day work class was tight, he was in his twenties, and he had not married yet, and he was thinking about Sister Feng recently. , there are some things like ""the finger is suffocating""; moreover, it has two times of freezing and anger, so three or five times, I am attacked, and I have a disease: my heart is swollen, my mouth is tasteless, my feet are like cotton, my eyes are like cotton. Seemingly drunk, burning at night, tired during the day, drowning with sperm, coughing up phlegm with blood. Diseases such as this have been filled in less than a year. So I couldn't support it, I fell asleep on one end, closed my eyes and only dreamed in a daze, full of nonsense, and terrified. I have sought medical treatment in every possible way, such as cinnamon, aconite, turtle shell, Ophiopogon japonicus, and Yuzhu, etc. I have eaten several dozen catties, but there is no movement.","From this time forward his mind was, it is true, still with lady Feng, but he did not have the courage to put his foot into the Jung mansion; and with Chia Jung and Chia Se both coming time and again to dun him for the money, he was likewise full of fears lest his grandfather should come to know everything. His passion for lady Feng was, in fact, already a burden hard to bear, and when, moreover, the troubles of debts were superadded to his tasks, which were also during the whole day arduous, he, a young man of about twenty, as yet unmarried, and a prey to constant cravings for lady Feng, which were difficult to gratify, could not avoid giving way, to a great extent, to such evil habits as exhausted his energies. His lot had, what is more, been on two occasions to be frozen, angered and to endure much hardship, so that with the attacks received time and again from all sides, he unconsciously soon contracted an organic disease. In his heart inflammation set in; his mouth lost the sense of taste; his feet got as soft as cotton from weakness; his eyes stung, as if there were vinegar in them. At night, he burnt with fever. During the day, he was repeatedly under the effects of lassitude. Perspiration was profuse, while with his expectorations of phlegm, he brought up blood. The whole number of these several ailments came upon him, before the expiry of a year, (with the result that) in course of time, he had not the strength to bear himself up. Of a sudden, he would fall down, and with his eyes, albeit closed, his spirit would be still plunged in confused dreams, while his mouth would be full of nonsense and he would be subject to strange starts. Every kind of doctor was asked to come in, and every treatment had recourse to; and, though of such medicines as cinnamon, aconitum seeds, turtle shell, ophiopogon, Yue-chue herb, and the like , he took several tens of catties, he nevertheless experienced no change for the better; so that by the time the twelfth moon drew once again to an end, and spring returned, this illness had become still more serious.","From that time on, though he longed for Xi-feng with unabated passion, he never dared to visit the Rong-guo mansion again. Jia Rong and Jia Qiang, on the other hand, came frequently to his house to ask for their money, so that he was in constant dread of his grandfather finding out about the IOUs. Unable, even now, to overcome his longing for Xi-feng, saddled with a heavy burden of debt, harassed during the daytime by the schoolwork set him by his exacting grandfather, worn-out during the nights by the excessive hand-pumping inevitable in an unmarried man of twenty whose mistress was both unattainable and constantly in his thoughts, twice frozen, tormented and forced to flee – what constitution could withstand so many shocks and strains without succumbing in the end to illness ? The symptoms of Jia Rui’s illness – a palpitation in the heart, a loss of taste in the mouth, a weakness in the hams, a smarting in the eyes, feverishness by night and lassitude by day, albumen in the urine and blood-flecks in the phlegm – had all manifested themselves within less than a year. By that time they had produced a complete breakdown and driven him to his bed, where he lay, with eyes tight shut, babbling deliriously and inspiring terror in all who saw him. Physicians were called in to treat him and some bushels of cinnamon bark, autumn root, turtle-shell, black leek and Solomon ’s seal must at one time and another have been infused and taken without the least observable effect."
這日乃五七正五日上，那應佛僧正開方破獄，傳燈照亡，參閻君、都鬼，筵請地藏王，開金橋，引幢幡；那道士們正伏章申表，朝三清，叩玉帝；神僧們行香，放焰口，拜水懺；又有十三眾尼僧，搭繡衣，靸紅鞋，在靈前默誦接引諸咒，十分熱鬧。,"This day is on the fifth day of the fifth day, and the Buddhist monks are opening the door to break the prison, pass the lamp to illuminate the dead, attend the Lord of Yan, the ghost of the capital, invite the King of Tibet, open the golden bridge, and lead the banners; During the three Qing Dynasty, they kowtowed to the Jade Emperor; the gods and monks performed incense, set off flames, and worshipped water for repentance; there were also thirteen nuns, wearing embroidered clothes and red shoes, silently reciting various mantras in front of the spirit, and it was very lively.","Indeed, even when relatives or visitors came or went, she did not go to receive them, or see them off. This day was the thirty-fifth day, the very day of the fifth seven, and the whole company of bonzes had just (commenced the services) for unclosing the earth, and breaking Hell open; for sending a light to show the way to the departed spirit; for its being admitted to an audience by the king of Hell; for arresting all the malicious devils, as well as for soliciting the soul-saving Buddha to open the golden bridge and to lead the way with streamers. The Taoist priests were engaged in reverently reading the prayers; in worshipping the Three Pure Ones and in prostrating themselves before the Gemmy Lord. The disciples of abstraction were burning incense, in order to release the hungered spirits, and were reading the water regrets manual. There was also a company of twelve nuns of tender years, got up in embroidered dresses, and wearing red shoes, who stood before the coffin, silently reading all the incantations for the reception of the spirit (from the lower regions,) with the result that the utmost bustle and stir prevailed.","The Thirty-fifth had now arrived – an important day in the penitential cycle of seven times seven days preceding the funeral – and the monks in the main hall had reached a particularly dramatic part of their ceremonies. Having opened up a way for the imprisoned souls, the chief celebrant had succeeded by means of spells and incantations in breaking open the gates of hell. He had shone his light (a little hand-mirror) for the souls in darkness. He had confronted Yama, the Judge of the Dead. He had seized the demon torturers who resisted his progress. He had invoked Ksitigarbha, the Saviour King, to aid him. He had raised up a golden bridge, and now, by means of a little flag which he held aloft in one hand, was conducting over it those souls from the very deepest pit of hell who still remained undelivered. Meanwhile the ninety-nine Taoists in the Celestial Fragrance Pavilion were on their knees offering up a written petition to the Three Pure Ones and calling on the Jade Emperor himself in his heavenly palace. Outside, on their high staging, with swinging of censers and scattering of little cakes for the hungry ghosts to feed on, Zen monks were performing the great Water Penitential. And in the shrine where the coffin stood, six young monks and six young nuns, magnificently attired in scarlet slippers and embroidered copes, sat before the spirit tablet quietly murmuring the dharani that would assist the soul of the dead woman on the most difficult part of its journey into the underworld. Everywhere there was a hum of activity."
鳳姐兒說：「我回太太，我先瞧瞧蓉哥兒媳婦，我再過去。」王夫人道：「很是。我們都要去瞧瞧他，倒怕他嫌鬧的慌，說我們問他好罷。」尤氏道：「好妹妹，媳婦聽你的話，你去開導開導他，我也放心。你就快些過園子裏來。」寶玉也要跟了鳳姐兒去瞧秦氏去，王夫人道：「你看看就過去罷，那是侄兒媳婦。」於是尤氏請了邢夫人、王夫人並他母親都過會芳園去了。,"Sister Feng said, ""I'll go back to my wife. I'll see Brother Rong's daughter-in-law first, and then I'll go over there."" Madam Wang said, ""Exactly. We should all go to see him, but I'm afraid he'll panic and say we ask. He's fine."" You said, ""Good sister, my daughter-in-law listens to your words, and I'm relieved if you go to enlighten him. You should hurry up and come across the garden."" Baoyu also went with Sister Feng to see Qin. Mrs. Wang said, ""Just look at it and go there. That's the daughter-in-law of your nephew."" So Mrs. You invited Mrs. Xing, Mrs. Wang and his mother to go to Huifang Garden.","“I wish to tell you, madame,” interposed lady Feng, “that I shall go first and see brother Jung’s wife and then come and join you.” “All right,” replied madame Wang; “we should all have been fain to have paid her a visit, did we not fear lest she should look upon our disturbing her with displeasure, but just tell her that we would like to know how she is getting on!” “My dear sister,” remarked Mrs. Yu, “as our son’s wife has a ready ear for all you say, do go and cheer her up, (and if you do so,) it will besides set my own mind at ease; but be quick and come as soon as you can into the garden.” Pao-yue being likewise desirous to go along with lady Feng to see lady Ch’in, madame Wang remarked, “Go and see her just for a while, and then come over at once into the garden; (for remember) she is your nephew’s wife, (and you couldn’t sit in there long).”","‘Aunt Wang,’ said Xi-feng, ‘may I go and see Rong’s wife first ? I can go on to the garden from there.’ ‘Certainly. You ought to go,’ said Lady Wang. ‘In fact, we should all like to go with you, but I am afraid it would be too much excitement for her. Please give her our love.’ ‘My dear,’ said You-shi, ‘I know she will always do anything you ask her to. See if you can talk her into a more cheerful frame of mind. It would be such a relief to me if you could. But join us in the garden as soon as you can!’ Bao-yu asked if he could go with Xi-feng to see Qin-shi. ‘Yes,’ said Lady Wang. ‘She is your nephew’s wife. I think you should. Just look in for a moment, though, and then join the rest of us.’"
這裏鳳姐忽又想起一事來，便向窗外叫：「蓉哥回來。」外面幾個人接聲說：「蓉大爺快回來。」賈蓉忙復身轉來，垂手侍立，聽何指示。那鳳姐只管慢慢的喫茶，出了半日的神，又笑道：「罷了，你且去罷。晚飯後你來再說罷。這會子有人，我也沒精神了。」賈蓉應了一聲，方慢慢的退去。,"Here, Sister Feng suddenly remembered something, and called out the window, ""Brother Rong, come back."" Several people outside said, ""Uncle Rong, come back soon."" Jia Rong hurriedly turned around, stood with her hands down, and listened to He's instructions. That Feng sister just ate tea slowly, and after a long time, she smiled and said, ""Forget it, let's go. You can talk about it after dinner. There are people here, and I'm out of energy."" Jia Rong responded. , Fang slowly retreated.","Lady Feng suddenly bethought herself of something, and turning towards the window, she called out, “Jung Erh, come back.” Several servants who stood outside caught up her words: “ Mr. Jung,” they cried, “you’re requested to go back;” whereupon Chia Jung turned round and retraced his steps; and with hands drooping respectfully against his sides, he stood ready to listen to his aunt’s wishes. Lady Feng was however intent upon gently sipping her tea, and after a good long while of abstraction, she at last smiled: “Never mind,” she remarked; “you can go. But come after you’ve had your evening meal, and I’ll then tell you about it. Just now there are visitors here; and besides, I don’t feel in the humour.” Chia Jung thereupon retired with gentle step. Old goody Liu, by this time, felt more composed in body and heart.","Xi-feng suddenly seemed to remember something, and called to him through the window, ‘Rong, come back!’ Servants in the yard outside dutifully took up the cry, ‘Master Rong, you’re wanted back again!’ Jia Rong came hurrying back, wreathed in smiles, and looked at Xi-feng with eyebrows arched inquiringly. Xi-feng, however, sipped very intently from her teacup and mused for a while, saying nothing. Suddenly her face flushed and she gave a little laugh: ‘It doesn’t matter. Come back again after supper. I’ve got company now, and besides, I don’t feel in the mood to tell you.’ ‘Yes, Aunt,’ said Jia Rong, and pursing his lips up in a complacent smile he sauntered slowly out of the room. Having all this while had time to collect herself, Grannie Liu began her speech again:"
次早賈璉起來，見過賈赦賈政，便往寧府中來，合同老管事的人等，並幾位世交門下清客相公，審察兩府地方，繕畫省親殿宇，一面參度辦理人丁。,"The next morning, Jia Lian got up and saw Jia She and Jia Zheng, so he went to Ning Mansion, the old man in charge of the contract, etc., together with several nobles from the family, inspected the places of the two houses, painted the palace of the relatives, and participated in the handling. People Ding.","The next morning, at an early hour, Chia Lien got up and called on Chia She and Chia Cheng; after which, he came over to the Ning Kuo mansion; when, in company with the old major-domos and other servants, as well as with several old family friends and companions, he inspected the grounds of the two mansions, and drew plans of the palatial buildings (for the accommodation of the Imperial consort and her escort) on her visit to her parents; deliberating at the same time, on the subject of the works and workmen. From this day the masons and workmen of every trade were collected to the full number; and the articles of gold, silver, copper, and pewter, as well as the earth, timber, tiles, and bricks, were brought over, and carried in, in incessant supplies.","Rising early next morning, Jia Lian first called on his father and uncles and then went to the Ning-guo mansion, where, with Cousin Zhen, he joined a group consisting of the older stewards and domestics and a few friends and clients of the family in making a complete survey of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties with a view to deciding where the various buildings of the Separate Residence should be sited. He also helped them interview the craftsmen who would undertake the work."
寶玉見問，一時解不來，因問：「什麼『暖』？」黛玉點頭嘆笑道：「蠢才，蠢才！你有玉，人家就有金來配你；人家有『冷香』，你就沒有『暖香』去配？」寶玉方聽出來。寶玉笑道：「方纔求饒，如今更說狠了。」說著，又去伸手。黛玉忙笑道：「好哥哥，我可不敢了。」寶玉笑道：「饒便饒你，只把袖子我聞一聞。」說著，便拉了袖子籠在面上，聞個不住。黛玉奪了手道：「這可該去了。」寶玉笑道：「去，不能。咱們斯斯文文的躺著說話兒。」說著，復又倒下。黛玉也倒下，用手帕子蓋上臉。寶玉有一搭沒一搭的說些鬼話，黛玉只不理。寶玉問他幾歲上京，路上見何景緻古跡，揚州有何遺跡故事，土俗民風。黛玉只不答。,"Baoyu couldn't answer the question for a while, because he asked, ""What's 'warm'?"" Daiyu nodded and sighed with a smile, ""Idiot, stupid! If you have jade, people will have gold to match you; ', you don't have a 'warm fragrance' to match?"" Baoyu Fang heard it. Baoyu smiled and said, ""Just now I begged for mercy, but now I'm even more ruthless."" After speaking, he stretched out his hand again. Daiyu hurriedly smiled and said, ""Good brother, I don't dare."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""I will spare you, but I can smell your sleeve."" After speaking, she pulled her sleeve and wrapped it around her face, unable to smell it. . Daiyu grabbed her hand and said, ""It's time to go."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Go, no. Let's lie down and talk in a gentle manner."" After speaking, he fell down again. Daiyu also fell and covered her face with a handkerchief. Baoyu said some nonsense, but Daiyu just ignored it. Baoyu asked him how old he was when he went to Beijing, what sights and historical sites he saw on the way, what historical sites and stories in Yangzhou, and local customs. Daiyu just didn't answer.","Pao-yue at this question, could not for a time unfold its meaning: “What ‘warm’ scent?” he therefore asked. Tai-yue nodded her head and smiled deridingly. “How stupid! what a fool!” she sighed; “you have jade, and another person has gold to match with you, and if some one has ‘cold’ scent, haven’t you any ‘warm’ scent as a set-off ?” Pao-yue at this stage alone understood the import of her remark. “A short while back you craved for mercy,” Pao-yue observed smilingly, “and here you are now going on talking worse than ever;” and as he spoke he again put out his hands. “Dear cousin,” Tai-yue speedily implored with a smirk, “I won’t venture to do it again.” “As for letting you off,” Pao-yue remarked laughing, “I’ll readily let you off, but do allow me to take your sleeve and smell it!” and while uttering these words, he hastily pulled the sleeve, and pressing it against his face, kept on smelling it incessantly, whereupon Tai-yue drew her hand away and urged: “You must be going now!” “Though you may wish me to go, I can’t,” Pao-yue smiled, “so let us now lie down with all propriety and have a chat,” laying himself down again, as he spoke, while Tai-yue likewise reclined, and covered her face with her handkerchief. Pao-yue in a rambling way gave vent to a lot of nonsense, which Tai-yue did not heed, and Pao-yue went on to inquire: “How old she was when she came to the capital? what sights and antiquities she saw on the journey? what relics and curiosities there were at Yang Chou? what were the local customs and the habits of the people?” Tai-yue made no reply; and Pao-yue fearing lest she should go to sleep, and get ill, readily set to work to beguile her to keep awake.","For the moment Bao-yu was puzzled: ‘Warm fragrance ?’ Dai-yu shook her head pityingly. ‘Don’t be so dense! You have your jade. Somebody has a gold thing to match. Somebody has Cold Fragrance, ergo you must have Warm Fragrance to go with it!’ ‘I’ve only just let you off,’ said Bao-yu, ‘and here you go again, worse than ever!’ Once more he stretched out the threatening fingers and Dai-yu again began to shriek. ‘No! Bao-yu! Please! I promise!’ ‘All right, I forgive you. But you must let me smell your sleeve.’ He wrapped the free end of that garment over his face and abandoned himself to long and prodigious sniffs. Dai-yu jerked away her arm. ‘I really think you ought to go.’ ‘Couldn’t go if I wanted to. Let’s lie down very quietly and genteelly and have a conversation.’ And he stretched himself out again. Dai-yu lay down too, and covered her face with a handkerchief. He tried to arouse hex interest with desultory chat – talking for the sake of talking. Dai-yu took no notice. He tried asking questions. How old was she when she first came to the Capital ? What had the scenery been like on the journey ? What places of historical interest were there in Yangchow ? What were its inhabitants like ? What were its local customs ? Dai-yu made no reply."
那女學生黛玉，身體方癒，原不忍棄父而往；無奈他外祖母致意務去，且兼如海說：「汝父年將半百，再無續室之意；且汝多病，年又極小，上無親母教養，下無姊妹兄弟扶持，今依傍外祖母及舅氏姊妹去，正好減我顧盼之憂，何反云不往？」黛玉聽了，方灑淚拜別，隨了奶娘及榮府幾個老婦人登舟而去。雨村另有一隻船，帶兩個小童，依附黛玉而行。,"The female student, Daiyu, was recovering, and she couldn't bear to abandon her father; but her grandmother sent her a message to go, and said like a sea, ""Your father will be half a hundred years old, and there is no intention of continuing his marriage; He is very young, he has no mother to raise him, and he has no sisters and brothers to support him. Now he is going to rely on his grandmother and uncles and sisters, which is just to relieve my worries, so why not go?"" Daiyu listened, and she said goodbye with tears and followed. The nurse and some old ladies from the Rong residence boarded the boat and left. There is another boat in Yucun, with two children, and it is attached to Daiyu.","His pupil could not, at first, brook the idea, of a separation from her father, but the pressing wishes of her grandmother left her no course (but to comply). “Your father,” Ju-hai furthermore argued with her, “is already fifty; and I entertain no wish to marry again; and then you are always ailing; besides, with your extreme youth, you have, above, no mother of your own to take care of you, and below, no sisters to attend to you. If you now go and have your maternal grandmother, as well as your mother’s brothers and your cousins to depend upon, you will be doing the best thing to reduce the anxiety which I feel in my heart on your behalf. Why then should you not go?” Tai-yue, after listening to what her father had to say, parted from him in a flood of tears and followed her nurse and several old matrons from the Jung mansion on board her boat, and set out on her journey. Yue-ts’un had a boat to himself, and with two youths to wait on him, he prosecuted his voyage in the wake of Tai-yue.","Everything, he thought to himself, was turning out very satisfactorily. Ru-hai for his part set about preparing presents for his wife’s family and parting gifts for Yu-cun, all of which Yu-cun in due course took charge of. At first his little pupil could not be persuaded to part from her father; but her grandmother was insistent that she should go, and Ru-hai added his own reasons. ‘I’m half a century old now, my dear, and I have no intention of taking a second wife; so there will be no one here to act as a mother to you. It isn’t, either, as if you had sisters who could help to take care of you. You know how often you are poorly. And you are still very young. It would be a great weight off my mind to know that you had your Grandmother Jia and your uncles’ girls to fall back on. I really think you ought to go.’ After this Dai-yu could only take a tearful leave of her father and go down to the boat with her nurse and the old women from the Rong mansion who had been sent to fetch her. There was a separate boat for Yu-cun and a couple of servant-boys to wait on him, and he too now embarked in the capacity of Dai-yu’s escort."
賈母笑道：「你不認得他，他是我們這裏有名的一個潑皮破落戶兒，南省俗謂作『辣子』，你只叫他『鳳辣子』就是了。」黛玉正不知以何稱呼，只見眾姊妹都忙告訴他道：「這是璉嫂子。」黛玉雖不識，也曾聽見母親說過，大舅賈赦之子賈璉，娶的就是二舅母王氏之內侄女，自幼假充男兒教養的，學名王熙鳳。黛玉忙陪笑見禮，以「嫂」呼之。,"Mother Jia said with a smile, ""You don't recognize him. He is a well-known scumbag here in our country. He is commonly known as a 'spicy child' in the southern province. You can just call him 'Phoenix spicy child'."" , I saw all the sisters hurriedly told him, ""This is sister-in-law Lian."" Although Daiyu didn't know it, she had heard her mother say that Jia Lian, the son of the eldest uncle Jia She, married the niece of the second aunt, Wang's, and had been married since childhood. The man who pretended to be a boy was brought up, and his scientific name was Wang Xifeng. Daiyu hurriedly greeted her with a smile, calling her ""sister-in-law"".","Old lady Chia then smiled. “You don’t know her,” she observed. “This is a cunning vixen, who has made quite a name in this establishment! In Nanking, she went by the appellation of vixen, and if you simply call her Feng Vixen, it will do.” Tai-yue was just at a loss how to address her, when all her cousins informed Tai-yue, that this was her sister-in-law Lien. Tai-yue had not, it is true, made her acquaintance before, but she had heard her mother mention that her eldest maternal uncle Chia She’s son, Chia Lien, had married the niece of Madame Wang, her second brother’s wife, a girl who had, from her infancy, purposely been nurtured to supply the place of a son, and to whom the school name of Wang Hsi-feng had been given. Tai-yue lost no time in returning her smile and saluting her with all propriety, addressing her as my sister-in-law.","‘You don’t know her,’ said Grandmother Jia merrily.’ She’s a holy terror this one. What we used to call in Nanking a “peppercorn” . You just call her “Peppercorn Feng”. She’ll know who you mean!’ Dai-yu was at a loss to know how she was to address this Peppercorn Feng until one of the cousins whispered that it was ‘Cousin Lian’s wife’, and she remembered having heard her mother say that her elder uncle, Uncle She, had a son called Jia Lian who was married to the niece of her Uncle Zheng’s wife, Lady Wang. She had been brought up from earliest childhood just like a boy, and had acquired in the schoolroom the somewhat boyish-sounding name of Wang Xi-feng. Dai-yu accordingly smiled and curtseyed, greeting her by her correct name as she did so."
寶玉看見襲人兩眼微紅，粉光融滑，因悄問襲人：「好好的哭什麼？」襲人笑道：「何嘗哭，纔迷了眼揉的。」因此便遮掩過了。當下寶玉穿著大紅金蟒狐腋箭袖，外罩石青貂裘排穗褂。襲人道：「你特為往這裏來又換新服，他們就不問你那去的？」寶玉笑道：「原是珍大爺請過去看戲換的。」襲人點頭。又道：「坐一坐就回去罷，這個地方不是你來的。」寶玉笑道：「你就家去纔好呢，我還替你留著好東西呢。」襲人悄笑道：「悄悄的，叫他們聽著什麼意思。」一面又伸手從寶玉項上將通靈玉摘了下來，向他姊妹們笑道：「你們見識見識。時常說起來都當希罕，恨不能一見，今兒可盡力瞧了再瞧。什麼希罕物兒，也不過是這麼個東西。」說畢，遞與他們傳看了一遍，仍與寶玉掛好。又命他哥哥去或雇一乘小轎，或雇一輛小車，送寶玉回去。花自芳道：「有我送去，騎馬也不妨了。」襲人道：「不為不妨，為的是碰見人。」,"Baoyu saw that Xiren's eyes were reddish, pink and smooth, so she quietly asked Xiren, ""Why are you crying?"" Xiren smiled and said, ""Why are you crying, that's why you rubbed your eyes."" So she covered it up. At the moment, Baoyu was wearing a big red gold python fox armpit arrow sleeves, and an outer jacket of stone green mink fur. Xiren said, ""You came here especially to change your clothes, so they didn't ask you where you were going?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""So it was Mr. Zhen who asked me to go to the show to change."" Xiren nodded. Then he said, ""Just sit down and go back. You didn't come here."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""It's better if you just go home, and I'll keep some good things for you."" Xiren whispered, "" Quietly, ask them to listen to what it means."" He stretched out his hand and took off the psychic jade from the jade neck, and smiled at his sisters: ""You have seen and seen. It is often said that it is rare, and I wish I could see it. Erke will try his best to look at it again. What a rare thing, it's just such a thing."" After saying that, he passed it to them and read it again, and still hung it with Baoyu. He ordered his brother to either hire a sedan or a car to take Baoyu back. Hua Zifang said: ""If I send it, it's okay to ride a horse."" Xiren said: ""It's okay if you don't, just to meet people.""","But Pao-yue, espying that Hsi Jen’s two eyes were slightly red, and that the powder was shiny and moist, quietly therefore inquired of Hsi Jen, “Why do you cry for no rhyme or reason?” “Why should I cry?” Hsi Jen laughed; “something just got into my eyes and I rubbed them.” By these means she readily managed to evade detection; but seeing that Pao-yue wore a deep red archery-sleeved pelisse, ornamented with gold dragons, and lined with fur from foxes’ ribs and a grey sable fur surtout with a fringe round the border. “What! have you,” she asked, “put on again your new clothes for? specially to come here? and didn’t they inquire of you where you were going?” “I had changed,” Pao-yue explained with a grin, “as Mr. Chen had invited me to go over and look at the play.” “Well, sit a while and then go back;” Hsi Jen continued as she nodded her head; “for this isn’t the place for you to come to!” “You’d better be going home now,” Pao-yue suggested smirkingly; “where I’ve again kept something good for you.” “Gently,” smiled Hsi Jen, “for were you to let them hear, what figure would we cut?” And with these, words, she put out her hand and unclasping from Pao-yue ’s neck the jade of Spiritual Perception , she faced her cousins and remarked exultingly. “Here! see for yourselves; look at this and learn! When I repeatedly talked about it, you all thought it extraordinary, and were anxious to have a glance at it; to-day, you may gaze on it with all your might, for whatever precious thing you may by and by come to see will really never excel such an object as this!” When she had finished speaking, she handed it over to them, and after they had passed it round for inspection, she again fastened it properly on Pao-yue’s neck, and also bade her brother go and hire a small carriage, or engage a small chair, and escort Pao-yue back home. “If I see him back,” Hua Tzu-fang remarked, “there would be no harm, were he even to ride his horse!” “It isn’t because of harm,” Hsi Jen replied; “but because he may come across some one from the house.”","Bao-yu noticed that Aroma’s eyes were slightly red and that there were recent tear-stains on her powdered cheeks. ‘Why have you been crying?’ He spoke the words in an undertone as she handed him the pine nuts. ‘Who’s been crying?’ said Aroma with a feigned laugh. ‘I’ve just been rubbing my eyes.’ Her little fiction was successful, for he made no further comment. Bao-yu was wearing his dark-red gown with the pattern of golden dragons and white fox-fur lining, and a sable-lined slate-blue jacket with fringed edges. ‘Fancy!’ said Aroma, ‘you got yourself all dressed up just to come and see us. Didn’t anyone ask you where you were going?’ ‘No,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Actually I changed because I was going to Cousin Zhen’s. He invited me over to watch the players.’ Aroma nodded. ‘You’d better go back after you’ve sat a bit longer,’ she said. ‘This is really no place for you here.’ ‘You shouldn’t be too long, either,’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘I’ve got something nice waiting for you when you get back.’ ‘Sh!’ said Aroma. ‘Do you want them all to hear you?’ As she said this, she reached out and took the Magic Jade from his neck. ‘Here’s something that will interest you all,’ she said, holding it out to the others. ‘You know how often you’ve spoken about that wonderful jade of Master Bao’s and said how much you’d give for a look at it ? Well, here it is! Now you can look to your heart’s content. There you are, that’s all it is! Not so wonderful, really, is it?’ They passed it from hand to hand, and when it had gone full circle and all had examined it , she hung it once more round his neck. Aroma told her elder brother to go out and hire the cleanest, smartest-looking cab he could find to take Bao-yu home in. ‘I can see him safely back,’ said Hua Zi-fang. ‘He won’t come to any harm on horseback.’ ‘It’s not a question of whether he’ll come to any harm or not,’ said Aroma. ‘I’m afraid someone might see him.’"

正鬧著，賈母遣人來叫他喫飯，方往前邊來，胡亂喫了半碗，仍回自己房中。只見襲人睡在外頭炕上，麝月在旁邊抹骨牌。寶玉素知麝月與襲人親厚，一併連麝月也不理，揭起軟簾自往裏間來。麝月只得跟進來。寶玉便推他出去，說：「不敢驚動你們。」麝月只得笑著出來，喚了兩個小丫頭進來。寶玉拿一本書，歪著看了半天，因要茶，抬頭只見兩個小丫頭在地下站著。一個大些兒的生得十分水秀，寶玉便問：「你叫什麼名字？」那丫頭便說：「叫蕙香。」寶玉便問：「是誰起的？」蕙香道：「我原叫蕓香的，是花大姐姐改了蕙香。」寶玉道：「正經該叫『晦氣』罷了，什麼蕙香呢！」又問：「你姊妹幾個？」蕙香道：「四個。」寶玉道：「你第幾？」蕙香道：「第四。」寶玉道：「明兒就叫『四兒』，不必什麼『蕙香』『蘭氣』的。那一個配比這些花，沒的玷辱了好名好姓。」一面說，一面命他倒了茶來喫。襲人和麝月在外間聽了抿嘴而笑。,"While it was making a fuss, Mother Jia sent someone to ask him to eat, Fang came forward, ate half a bowl indiscriminately, and went back to his room. I saw Xiren sleeping on the kang outside, and Musk Yue was playing dominoes beside him. Baoyu knew that Sheyue was close to Xiren, and she didn't even care about her, so she pulled up the soft curtain and walked in. Musk Moon had to follow up. Baoyu pushed him out and said, ""I don't dare to disturb you."" She Yue had to laugh and call two little girls to come in. Baoyu took a book and read it tilted for a long time, looking up for tea, he saw two little girls standing on the ground. The older one was very beautiful, and Baoyu asked, ""What's your name?"" The girl said, ""It's called Huixiang."" Baoyu asked, ""Who made it?"" Huixiang said, ""My name was originally called Huixiang. For Yunxiang, it was Big Sister Hua who changed her scent."" Baoyu said, ""It should be called 'bad luck', what is Huixiang?"" He asked, ""How many sisters do you have?"" Huixiang said, ""Four."" Baoyu Said: ""What is your number?"" Huixiang said, ""Fourth."" Baoyu said, ""Tomorrow will be called 'Fourth', there is no need for ""Huixiang"" or ""Orchid"". Which one matches these flowers, no Disgraced a good name and a good surname."" As he said that, he ordered him to pour tea to eat. Xi and Sheyue pursed their lips and smiled when they heard it outside.","While they were disputing, dowager lady Chia sent a servant to call him to his repast, and he thereupon crossed over to the front; but after he had hurriedly swallowed a few bowls of rice, he returned to his own apartment, where he discovered Hsi Jen reclining on the outer stove-couch, while She Yueeh was playing with the dominoes by her side. Pao-yue had been ever aware of the intimacy which existed between She Yueeh and Hsi Jen, so that paying not the slightest notice to even She Yueeh, he raised the soft portiere and straightway walked all alone into the inner apartment. She Yueeh felt constrained to follow him in, but Pao-yue at once pushed her out, saying: “I don’t venture to disturb you two;” so that She Yueeh had no alternative but to leave the room with a smiling countenance, and to bid two young waiting-maids go in. Pao-yue took hold of a book and read for a considerable time in a reclining position; but upon raising his head to ask for some tea, he caught sight of a couple of waiting-maids, standing below; the one of whom, slightly older than the other, was exceedingly winsome. “What’s your name?” Pao-yue eagerly inquired. “I’m called Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance),” that waiting-maid rejoined simperingly. “Who gave you this name?” Pao-yue went on to ask. “I went originally under the name of Yuen Hsiang (Gum Sandarac),” added Hui Hsiang, “but Miss Hua it was who changed it.” “You should really be called Hui Ch’i, (latent fragrance), that would be proper; and why such stuff as Hui Hsiang, (orchid fragrance)?” “How many sisters have you got?” he further went on to ask of her. “Four,” replied Hui Hsiang. “Which of them are you?” Pao-yue asked. “The fourth,” answered Hui Hsiang. “By and by you must be called Ssu Erh, (fourth child),” Pao-yue suggested, “for there’s no need for any such nonsense as Hui Hsiang (orchid fragrance) or Lan Ch’i (epidendrum perfume.) Which single girl deserves to be compared to all these flowers, without profaning pretty names and fine surnames!” As he uttered these words, he bade her give him some tea, which he drank; while Hsi Jen and She Yueeh, who were in the outer apartment, had been listening for a long time and laughing with compressed lips.","They were still arguing when Grandmother Jia sent a servant round to summon him to lunch. He went off to the front apartment, but returned almost immediately after bolting a single bowlful of rice. He found Aroma asleep on the kang and Musk sitting beside her playing Patience with some dominoes. He had long known that Musk was a close ally of Aroma’s, so ignoring them both, he marched past them into the inner room, raising the door-curtain for himself as he passed through. Musk followed him automatically, but he pushed her out: ‘No, no, I wouldn’t presume to trouble you!’ She laughed and went back to her Patience, having first ordered a couple of the younger maids to wait on him in her stead. In the inner room Bao-yu took up a book and reclined on the kang to read. For a considerable while he remained engrossed in his reading. When eventually he did look up, intending to ask someone for some tea, he saw two little maids waiting there in silence, one of whom – evidently the older by a year or two – was an attractive, intelligent-looking girl. He addressed himself to her: ‘Isn’t your name “Nella” something or other?’ ‘Citronella.’ ‘Citronella? Who on earth gave you that name?’ ‘Aroma, sir. My real name is “Soldandla” , but Miss Aroma altered it to “Citronella” .’ ‘I don’t know why she didn’t call you “Citric Acid” and have done with it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Citronella! – How many girls are there in your family, Citronella?’ ‘Four,’ said Citronella. ‘And which of the four are you?’ ‘I’m the youngest.’ ‘Right!’ said Bao-yu. ‘In future you will be called “Number Four”. We’re not going to have any more of these floral fragrances around here. It’s an insult to decent scents and flowers to give their names to you lot!’ Then he asked her to pour him some tea. Listening attentively in the outer room, ‘Flowers’ Aroma and her Musky ally – for whose ears this gibe was intended -were nearly bursting themselves in their efforts not to laugh."
二人正鬧著，原來賈環聽的見，素日原恨寶玉，如今又見他和彩霞鬧，心中越發按不下這口毒氣。雖不敢明言，卻每每暗中算計，衹是不得下手，今見相離甚近，便要用熱油燙瞎他的眼睛。因而故意裝作失手，把那一盞油汪汪的蠟燈向寶玉臉上只一推。只聽寶玉「噯喲」了一聲，滿屋裏眾人都唬了一跳。連忙將地下的戳燈挪過來，又將裏外間屋的燈拿了三四盞看時，只見寶玉滿臉滿頭都是油，王夫人只急又氣，一面命人來替寶玉擦洗，一面又罵賈環。鳳姐三步兩步的上炕去替寶玉收拾著，一面笑道：「老三還是這麼慌腳雞似的，我說你上不得高臺盤。趙姨娘時常也該教導教導他。」一句話提醒了王夫人，那王夫人不罵賈環，便叫過趙姨娘來罵道：「養出這樣黑心不知道理下流種子來，也不管管！幾番幾次我都不理論，你們得了意了，越發上來了！」,"The two were arguing. It turned out that when Jia Huan heard it, Su Ri hated Baoyu, but now that he was arguing with Caixia again, he couldn't hold back the poisonous gas in his heart. Although he didn't dare to say it outright, he often calculated secretly, but he couldn't make a move. Now that he saw that they were so close, he would use hot oil to burn his eyes out. Therefore, he deliberately pretended to miss and pushed the oily wax lamp into Baoyu's face. Hearing Baoyu's ""Aiyo"" sound, everyone in the room jumped. He hurriedly moved the poke lamp from the ground over, and took three or four lamps in the inner and outer rooms to see that Baoyu's face was covered in oil. Madam Wang was anxious and angry. He scolded Jia Huan again. Sister Feng went to the kang in three steps to clean up for Baoyu. She smiled and said, ""The third child is still so flustered. I said you can't get on the high platform. Concubine Zhao should also teach him from time to time."" I reminded Mrs. Wang, that Mrs. Wang didn't scold Jia Huan, so she called Aunt Zhao to scold: ""You don't care if you raise such a black-hearted and unreasonable seed! I don't care about it after several times, you are proud of it. , it's coming up more and more!""","These two were in the act of wrangling, when verily Chia Huan overheard what was going on. He had, in fact, all along hated Pao-yue; so when on this occasion, he espied him up to his larks with Ts’ai Hsia, he could much less than ever stifle feelings of resentment in his heart. After some reflection, therefore, an idea suggested itself to his mind, and pretending that it was by a slip of the hand, he shoved the candle, overflowing with tallow, into Pao-yue’s face. “Ai ya!” Pao-yue was heard to exclaim. Every one in the whole room was plunged in consternation. With precipitate haste, the lanterns, standing on the floor, were moved over; and, with the first ray of light, they discovered that Pao-yue’s face was one mass of tallow. Madame Wang gave way to anger as well as anxiety. At one time, she issued directions to the servants to rub and wash Pao-yue clean. At another, she heaped abuse upon Chia Huan. Lady Feng jumped on to the stone-couch by leaps and bounds. But while intent upon removing the stuff from Pao-yue’s face, she simultaneously ejaculated: “ Master Tertius, are you still such a trickster! I’ll tell you what, you’ll never turn to any good account! Yet dame Chao should ever correct and admonish him.” This single remark suggested the idea to Madame Wang, and she lost no time in sending for Mrs. Chao to come round. “You bring up,” she berated her, “such a black-hearted offspring like this, and don’t you, after all, advise and reprove him? Time and again I paid no notice whatever to what happened, and you and he have become more audacious, and have gone from worse to worse!”","Jia Huan heard every word of this exchange. He had always hated Bao-yu, and this flirting with Sunset – his Sunset – was the last straw. He must be revenged or burst. A moment’s reflection suggested the means. He had only to feign a slight clumsiness of the hand and it was done. The candle, brimming with molten wax, toppled straight on to Bao-yu’s face. There was a piercing cry, which made everyone else in the room jump. Quickly they brought standard lamps up from the floor below. By their light Bao-yu’s face was seen to be covered all over in wax. Torn between anguish for him and anger with Jia Huan, Lady Wang urged the servants to remove it as quickly as possible, while alternately berating the other boy for his carelessness. Xi-feng scrambled up on to the kang to help the servants, grumbling at Jia Huan as she did so: ‘Huan, you are the most cack-handed creature I have ever met! You are simply not fit for decent company. I don’t know why Aunt Zhao hasn’t taught you better.’ Her words reminded Lady Wang that she had been abusing a Master in front of the servants. She ceased rebuking Jia Huan at once and, summoning Aunt Zhao, directed all her wrath upon that luckless concubine: ‘This is a fine son you bore us, I must say! He is a blackhearted little monster! You might at least try to teach him better. But no."
少時襲人倒了茶來，見身邊佩物一件無存，因笑道：「帶的東西又是那起沒臉的東西們解了去了。」林黛玉聽說，走來瞧瞧，果然一件無存，因向寶玉道：「我給的那個荷包也給他們了？你明兒再想我的東西，可不能夠了！」說畢，賭氣回房，將前日寶玉所煩他作的那個香袋兒——纔做了一半——賭氣拿過來就鉸。寶玉見他生氣，便知不妥，忙趕過來，早剪破了。寶玉已見過這香囊：雖尚未完，卻十分精巧，費了許多工夫。今見無故剪了，卻也可氣。因忙把衣領解了，從裏面紅襖襟上將黛玉所給的那荷包解了下來，遞與黛玉瞧道：「你瞧瞧，這是什麼！我那一回把你的東西給人了？」林黛玉見他如此珍重，帶在裏面，可知是怕人拿去之意，因此又自悔莽撞，未見皂白，就剪了香袋。因此又愧又氣，低頭一言不發。,"When he was young, he poured tea and saw that there was nothing left of his belongings, Yin said with a smile: ""The things I brought with them are the shameless things that they have taken away."" Lin Daiyu heard that, and came to take a look. There was nothing left, and Yin said to Baoyu, ""I also gave them the purse I gave them? You can't think about my things again tomorrow!"" After speaking, he returned to the room in a fit of rage, saying what Baoyu had bothered him the day before. That sachet - only halfway through - took it in a fit of anger and hinged it. Seeing that he was angry, Baoyu knew something was wrong, hurried over, and cut it early. Baoyu had already seen this sachet: although it was not finished, it was very delicate and took a lot of work. Now I saw it was cut for no reason, but I was also angry. Because he was busy taking off his collar, he took off the purse that Daiyu had given him from the inside of the red jacket, and handed it over to Daiyu and said, ""Look, what is this! That time I gave your things to you. Someone?"" Lin Daiyu saw that he was so precious and brought it inside, knowing that she was afraid that someone would take it away, so she felt remorse and reckless, and cut the sachet without seeing the waste. So ashamed and angry, he bowed his head and said nothing.","But not a long interval elapsed before Hsi Jen came to serve the tea; and when she perceived that on his person not one of the ornaments remained, she consequently smiled and inquired: “Have all the things that you had on you been again taken away by these barefaced rascals?” As soon as Lin Tai-yue heard this remark, she crossed over to him and saw at a glance that not one single trinket was, in fact, left. “Have you also given them,” she felt constrained to ask, “the purse that I gave you? Well, by and by, when you again covet anything of mine, I shan’t let you have it.” After uttering these words, she returned into her apartment in high dudgeon, and taking the scented bag, which Pao-yue had asked her to make for him, and which she had not as yet finished, she picked up a pair of scissors, and instantly cut it to pieces. Pao-yue noticing that she had lost her temper, came after her with hurried step, but the bag had already been cut with the scissors; and as Pao-yue observed how extremely fine and artistic this scented bag was, in spite of its unfinished state, he verily deplored that it should have been rent to pieces for no rhyme or reason. Promptly therefore unbuttoning his coat, he produced from inside the lapel the purse, which had been fastened there. “Look at this!” he remarked as he handed it to Tai-yue; “what kind of thing is this! have I given away to any one what was yours?” Lin Tai-yue, upon seeing how much he prized it as to wear it within his clothes, became alive to the fact that it was done with intent, as he feared lest any one should take it away; and as this conviction made her sorry that she had been so impetuous as to have cut the scented bag, she lowered her head and uttered not a word.","Soon after, when he was back in his own room, Aroma came in to pour him some tea and noticed that all the little objects he usually carried about his waist had disappeared. ‘Where have the things from your belt gone?’ she said. ‘I suppose those worthless pages have taken them again.’ Dai-yu overheard her and came up to inspect. Sure enough, not one of the things was there. ‘So you’ve given away that little purse I gave you? Very well, then. You needn’t expect me to give you anything in future, however much you want it!’ With these words she went off to her own room in a temper, and taking up a still unfinished perfume sachet which she was making for him at his own request, she began to cut it up with her embroidery scissors. Bao-yu, observing that she was angry, had hurried after her – but it was too late. The sachet was already cut to pieces. Although it had not been finished, Bao-yu could see that the embroidery was very fine, and it made him angry to think of the hours and hours of work so wantonly destroyed. Tearing open his collar he took out the little embroidered purse which had all along been hanging round his neck and held it out for her to see. ‘Look! What’s that? When have I ever given anything of yours to someone else?’ Dai-yu knew that he must have treasured her gift to have worn it inside his clothing where there was no risk of its being taken from him. She regretted her over-hasty destruction of the sachet and hung her head in silence."
原來這梨香院即當日榮公暮年養靜之所，小小巧巧，約有十餘間房屋，前廳後舍俱全。另有一門通街，薛蟠家人就走此門出入。西南有一角門，通一夾道，出夾道便是王夫人正房的東邊了。每日或飯後，或晚間，薛姨媽便過來，或與賈母閑談，或與王夫人相敘。寶釵日與黛玉迎春姊妹等一處，或看書下棋，或作針黹，倒也十分樂業。,"It turned out that this Lixiangyuan was the place where Duke Rong was in his twilight years. There is another door leading to the street, and Xue Pan's family used this door to go in and out. There is a corner door in the southwest, through a narrow passage, the passage is the east of Mrs. Wang's main room. Every day, after meals, or at night, Aunt Xue would come over, chat with Mother Jia, or chat with Madam Wang. Baochai Ri and Sister Daiyu Yingchun, etc., were reading books and playing chess, or playing acupuncture, and they were very happy.","This Court of Pear Fragrance had, we must explain, been at one time used as a place for the quiet retirement of the Duke Jung in his advanced years. It was on a small scale, but ingeniously laid out. There were, at least, over ten structures. The front halls and the back houses were all in perfect style. There was a separate door giving on to the street, and the people of the household of Hsueeh P’an used this door to go in and out. At the south-west quarter, there was also a side door, which communicated with a narrow roadway. Beyond this narrow road, was the eastern court of madame Wang’s principal apartment; so that every day, either after her repast, or in the evening, Mrs. Hsueeh would readily come over and converse, on one thing and another, with dowager lady Chia, or have a chat with madame Wang; while Pao-ch’ai came together, day after day, with Tai yue, Ying-ch’un, her sisters and the other girls, either to read, to play chess, or to do needlework, and the pleasure which they derived was indeed perfect.","This Pear Tree Court had been the Duke of Rong-guo’s retreat during the last years of his life. Its buildings totalled not much more than ten frames; but though small and charming, it was complete in every respect, with a little reception room in the front and all the usual rooms and offices behind. It had its own outer door on to the street, through which Xue Pan and the menservants could come and go, and another gate in the south-west corner giving on to a passage-way which led into the courtyard east of Lady Wang’s compound. Through this passage-way Aunt Xue would now daily repair, either after dinner or in the evening, to gossip with Grandmother Jia or reminisce with her sister, Lady Wang. Bao-chai for her part spent her time each day in great contentment, reading or playing Go or sewing with Dai-yu and the three girls."
寶玉恍恍惚惚，不覺棄了卷冊，又隨了警幻來至後面。但見珠簾繡幕，畫棟雕檐，說不盡那光搖朱戶金鋪地，雪照瓊窗玉作宮。更見僊花馥郁，異草芬芳，真好個所在。又聽警幻笑道：「你們快出來迎接貴客！」一語未了，只見房中又走出幾個僊子來，皆是荷袂蹁躚，羽衣飄舞，姣若春花，媚如秋月。一見了寶玉，都怨謗警幻道：「我們不知係何『貴客』，忙的接了出來！姐姐曾說今日今時必有絳珠妹子的生魂前來遊玩，故我等久待。何故反引這濁物來污染這清淨女兒之境？」,"Baoyu was in a trance, unknowingly abandoned the volume, and followed the alarm and came to the back. But seeing beaded curtains and embroidered curtains, painted buildings and carved eaves, I can't say enough about the light that shakes Zhuhu's gold pavement, and the snow shines on Qiong windows and jade to make palaces. It is also a good place to see the fragrant flowers and fragrant herbs. Hearing the policeman laughed again, ""Come out to greet the distinguished guests!"" Before he could say a word, he saw a few more fairies coming out of the room. As soon as they saw Baoyu, they all complained about the police and said, ""We don't know what ""guests"" we are, but we hurriedly picked them up! My sister once said that the soul of the Jiangzhu girl must come to play today, so I waited for a long time. Inducing this filth to contaminate this pure daughter's realm?""","In a dazed state, Pao-yue listlessly discarded the record, and again followed in the footsteps of the Fairy. On their arrival at the back, he saw carnation portieres, and embroidered curtains, ornamented pillars, and carved eaves. But no words can adequately give an idea of the vermilion apartments glistening with splendour, of the floors garnished with gold, of the snow reflecting lustrous windows, of the palatial mansions made of gems. He also saw fairyland flowers, beautiful and fragrant, and extraordinary vegetation, full of perfume. The spot was indeed elysian. He again heard the Fairy observe with a smiling face: “Come out all of you at once and greet the honoured guest!” These words were scarcely completed, when he espied fairies walk out of the mansion, all of whom were, with their dangling lotus sleeves, and their fluttering feather habiliments, as comely as spring flowers, and as winsome as the autumn moon. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yue, they all, with one voice, resentfully reproached the Monitory Vision Fairy. “Ignorant as to who the honoured guest could be,” they argued, “we hastened to come out to offer our greetings simply because you, elder sister, had told us that, on this day, and at this very time, there would be sure to come on a visit, the spirit of the younger sister of Chiang Chu. That’s the reason why we’ve been waiting for ever so long; and now why do you, in lieu of her, introduce this vile object to contaminate the confines of pure and spotless maidens?”","Next moment, without quite knowing how it happened, Bao-yu found that he had left the place of registers behind him and was following Disenchantment through the rear parts of the palace. Everywhere there were buildings with ornately carved and painted eaves and rafters, their doorways curtained with strings of pearls and their interiors draped with embroidered hangings. The courtyards outside them were full of deliciously fragrant fairy blooms and rare aromatic herbs. Gleam of gold pavement flashed on scarlet doors, And in jade walls jewelled casements snow white shone. ‘Hurry, hurry! Come out and welcome the honoured guest!’ he heard Disenchantment calling to someone inside, and almost at once a bevy of fairy maidens came running from the palace, lotus-sleeves fluttering and feather-skirts billowing, each as enchantingly beautiful as the flowers of spring or the autumn moon. Seeing Bao-yu, they began to reproach Disenchantment angrily. ‘So this is your “honoured guest”! What do you mean by making us hurry out to meet him ? You told us that today at this very hour the dream-soul of our darling Crimson Pearl was coming to play with us, and we have been waiting I don’t know how long for her arrival. And now, instead, you have brought this disgusting creature to pollute our pure, maidenly precincts. What’s the idea?’"

子興道：「便是賈府中，現有的三個也不錯。政老爹的長女，名元春，現因賢孝才德，選入宮中作女史去了。二小姐乃赦老爹之妾所出，名迎春；三小姐乃政老爹之庶出，名探春；四小姐乃寧府珍爺之胞妹，名喚惜春。因史老夫人極愛孫女，都跟在祖母這邊一處讀書。聽得個個不錯。」,"Zixing said: ""Even in Jia's house, the three existing ones are not bad. Father Zheng's eldest daughter, named Yuanchun, is now selected as a female historian in the palace because of her virtuousness, filial piety and virtue. The second lady is the concubine of Father Pardon. She was named Yingchun; the third young lady was the descendant of Zheng’s father, and she was named Tanchun; the fourth young lady was the younger sister of Ningfu Zhenye, and her name was Xichun. Because Mrs. Shi loved her granddaughter very much, she studied with her grandmother. . Sounds good.""","“Quite so!” remarked Tzu-hsing; “there are now three young ladies in the Chia family who are simply perfection itself. The eldest is a daughter of Mr. Cheng, Yuan Ch’un by name, who, on account of her excellence, filial piety, talents, and virtue, has been selected as a governess in the palace. The second is the daughter of Mr. She’s handmaid, and is called Ying Ch’un; the third is T’an Ch’un, the child of Mr. Cheng’s handmaid; while the fourth is the uterine sister of Mr. Chen of the Ning Mansion. Her name is Hsi Ch’un. As dowager lady Shih is so fondly attached to her granddaughters, they come, for the most part, over to their grandmother’s place to prosecute their studies together, and each one of these girls is, I hear, without a fault.” “More admirable,” observed Yue-ts’un, “is the regime (adhered to) in the Chen family, where the names of the female children have all been selected from the list of male names, and are unlike all those out-of-the-way names, such as Spring Blossom, Scented Gem, and the like flowery terms in vogue in other families.","‘The three at present in the Jia household are also very fine girls,’ said Zi-xing. ‘ Sir Jia Zheng’s eldest girl, Yuan-chun, was chosen for her exceptional virtue and cleverness to be a Lady Secretary in the Imperial Palace. The next in age after her and eldest of the three still at home is called Ying-chun. She is the daughter of Sir Jia She by one of his secondary wives. After her comes another daughter of Sir Zheng’s, also a concubine’s child, called Tan-chun. The youngest, Xi-chun, is sister-german to Mr Jia Zhen of the Ning-guo mansion.

那賈瑞此時要命心甚切，無藥不喫，衹是白花錢，不見效。,"At this time, Jia Rui was desperate, he didn't take any medicine, he just spent money in vain, and it didn't work.","Chia Jui was, meanwhile, very anxious to recover his health, so that there was no medicine that he would not take, but the outlay of money was of no avail, for he derived no benefit.","Jia Rui now wanted desperately to live and eagerly swallowed every medicine that they offered him; but all was a waste of money, for nothing seemed to do him any good."
王夫人摸挲著寶玉的脖項說道．「前兒的丸藥都喫完了？」寶玉答道：「還有一丸。」王夫人道：「明兒再取十丸來，天天臨睡的時候，叫襲人伏侍你喫了再睡。」寶玉道：「只從太太吩咐了，襲人天天晚上想著，打發我喫。」賈政問道：「襲人是何人？」王夫人道：「是個丫頭。」賈政道：「丫頭不管叫個什麼罷了，是誰這樣刁鑽，起這樣的名字？」王夫大見賈政不自在了，便替寶玉掩飾道：「是老太太起的。」賈政道：「老太太如何知道這話，一定是寶玉。」寶玉見瞞不過，只得起身回道：「因素日讀詩，曾記古人有一句詩云：『花氣襲人知晝暖』。因這個丫頭姓花，便隨口起了這個名字。」王夫人忙又道：「寶玉，你回去改了罷。老爺也不用為這小事動氣。」賈政道：「究竟也無礙，又何用改。衹是可見寶玉不務正，專在這些濃詞艷賦上作工夫。」說畢，斷喝一聲：「作業的畜生，還不出去！」王夫人也忙道：「去罷，只怕老太太等你喫飯呢。」寶玉答應了，慢慢的退出去，向金釧兒笑著伸伸舌頭，帶著兩個嬤嬤一溜煙去了。,"Madam Wang stroked Baoyu's neck and said. ""Have you finished all the pills in the past?"" Baoyu replied, ""There is one more pill."" Mrs. Wang said, ""I will take another ten pills tomorrow. When I go to sleep every day, I will ask Xiren Fushi to eat and then sleep."" Baoyu said, ""Only from the wife's order, Xiren thinks about it every night, and sends me to eat."" Jia Zheng asked, ""Who is Xiren?"" Madam Wang said, ""It's a girl."" Jia Zheng said, ""You don't care what the girl is called. What is it, who is so tricky to call such a name?"" Wang Fuda saw that Jia Zheng was uncomfortable, so he covered up Baoyu, ""It's the old lady who started it."" Jia Zheng said, ""How did the old lady know this? It must be Baoyu."" Baoyu couldn't hide it, so he got up and replied: ""When I read poetry on the day, I remember an ancient poem that said: 'The scent of flowers is warm in the day'. Because this girl's surname is Hua, she casually chose this name. Mrs. Wang hurriedly said, ""Baoyu, go back and change it. Master don't need to get angry about this little thing."" Jia Zheng said, ""It's not a problem after all, so why change it? It just shows that Baoyu doesn't do justice and focuses on these things. It’s hard work.” After saying that, he stopped shouting, “The beasts of homework, don’t go out!” Madam Wang also hurriedly said, “Go, I’m afraid the old lady will be waiting for you to eat.” Baoyu agreed. Slowly withdrew, Xiang Jin Chuan'er smiled and stuck out his tongue, and walked away with the two maids.","madame Wang inquired, as she rubbed Pao-yue’s neck. “There’s still one pill remaining,” Pao-yue explained by way of reply. “You had better,” madame Wang added, “fetch ten more pills tomorrow morning; and every day about bedtime tell Hsi Jen to give them to you; and when you’ve had one you can go to sleep!” “Ever since you, mother, bade me take them,” Pao-yue rejoined, “Hsi Jen has daily sent me one, when I was about to turn in.” “Who’s this called Hsi Jen?” Chia Chen thereupon ascertained. “She’s a waiting-maid!” madame Wang answered. “A servant girl,” Chia Cheng remonstrated, “can be called by whatever name one chooses; anything is good enough; but who’s it who has started this kind of pretentious name!” Madame Wang noticed that Chia Cheng was not in a happy frame of mind, so that she forthwith tried to screen matters for Pao-yue, by saying: “It’s our old lady who has originated it!” “How can it possibly be,” Chia Cheng exclaimed, “that her ladyship knows anything about such kind of language? It must, for a certainty, be Pao-yue!” Pao-yue perceiving that he could not conceal the truth from him, was under the necessity of standing up and of explaining; “As I have all along read verses, I remembered the line written by an old poet: “What time the smell of flowers wafts itself into man, one knows the day is warm. “And as this waiting-maid’s surname was Hua (flower), I readily gave her the name, on the strength of this sentiment.” “When you get back,” madame Wang speedily suggested addressing Pao-yue, “change it and have done; and you, sir, needn’t lose your temper over such a trivial matter!” “It doesn’t really matter in the least,” Chia Cheng continued; “so that there’s no necessity of changing it; but it’s evident that Pao-yue doesn’t apply his mind to legitimate pursuits, but mainly devotes his energies to such voluptuous expressions and wanton verses!” And as he finished these words, he abruptly shouted out: “You brute-like child of retribution! Don’t you yet get out of this?” “Get away, off with you!” madame Wang in like manner hastened to urge; “our dowager lady is waiting, I fear, for you to have her repast!” Pao-yue assented, and, with gentle step, he withdrew out of the room, laughing at Chin Ch’uan-erh, as he put out his tongue; and leading off the two nurses, he went off on his way like a streak of smoke.","Lady Wang stroked Bao-yu’s neck affectionately: ‘Have you finished those pills I sent you the other day yet ?’ ‘There’s still one left,’ said Bao-yu. ‘You must come for some more tomorrow. I’ll give you another ten. You must get Aroma to give you one every night before you go to sleep.’ ‘Yes. You told Aroma, Mother. She’s been giving me one every night, as you said.’ ‘Who is this “Aroma” ?’ asked Jia Zheng sharply, ‘A maid,’ said Lady Wang. ‘I suppose there are no limits to what a maid may be called,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but who would have picked an outlandish name like that to give her ?’ Lady Wang could see that he was displeased and did her best to cover up for Bao-yu: ‘I think it was Lady Jia who gave her the name.’ ‘Mother would never think of a name like that,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It must have been Bao-yu.’ Bao-yu saw that a frank avowal was now unavoidable and rose to his feet: ‘This maid has a surname which means “Flowers” . There is a line in an old poem I happened to remember The flowers’ aroma breathes of hotter days and so I named her after that.’ ‘When you get back you must change the name at once,’ said Lady Wang hurriedly to Bao-yu. ‘Come, Sir Zheng’ -this to her husband – ‘you aren’t going to get angry about a little thing like that?’ ‘It doesn’t really matter,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘and there is no need for him to change the name; but it demonstrates what I have always said about the boy: he is fundamentally incapable of caring about serious matters and preoccupies himself with poetic frivolities and other such airy-fairy nonsense as a substitute for solid learning. Wretched fellow!’ he shouted at Bao-yu. ‘What are you waiting for?’ ‘Go now, go now!’ said Lady Wang in a flutter. ‘Grandma is probably waiting to begin her dinner.’ Bao-yu murmured a reply and retired, rather more slowly than was necessary. Emerging from the outer door, he grinned and stuck bis tongue out at Golden, then shot off like a puff of smoke, the two old nannies hurrying after him."
他母親胡氏聽見他咕咕嘟嘟的說，因問道：「你又要爭什麼閑氣？好容易我望你姑媽說了，你姑媽千方百計的纔向他們西府裏的璉二奶奶跟前說了，你纔得了這個念書的地方。若不是仗著人家，咱們家裏還有力量請的起先生？況且人家學裏，茶也是現成的，飯也是現成的。你這二年在那裏唸書，家裏也省好大的嚼用呢。省出來的，你又愛穿件鮮明衣服。再者，不是因你在那裏唸書，你就認得什麼薛大爺了？那薛大爺一年不給不給，這二年也幫了咱們有七八十兩銀子。你如今要鬧出了這個學房，再要找這麼個地方，我告訴你說罷，比登天還難呢！你給我老老實實的頑一會子睡你的覺去，好多著呢。」於是金榮忍氣吞聲，不多一時他自去睡了。次日仍舊上學去了。不在話下。,"His mother, Mrs. Hu, heard him grumbling, and because she asked, ""What are you arguing about? I hoped your aunt would say it, and your aunt did everything possible to tell the second grandma in their west mansion. , you got this place to study. If it wasn't for others, would our family still have the strength to hire Mr. Qi? Besides, in the school, tea and meals are also readily available. You have been studying there for the past two years, and your family It also saves a lot of chewing. If you save it, you like to wear bright clothes. Besides, you don’t know what Uncle Xue is because you are studying there? Then Uncle Xue will not give it for a year, In the past two years, it has also helped us to have seventy or eighty taels of silver. Now you are going to make trouble out of this school, and if you want to find such a place, let me tell you, it is harder than going to the sky! You can be honest with me You stubbornly go to sleep for a while, there's a lot of writing."" So Jin Rong swallowed his anger, and after a while he went to sleep on his own. I still went to school the next day. Not a problem.","His mother, nee Hu, hearing him mutter; “Why meddle again,” she explained, “in things that don’t concern you? I had endless trouble in getting to speak to your paternal aunt; and your aunt had, on the other hand, a thousand and one ways and means to devise, before she could appeal to lady Secunda, of the Western mansion; and then only it was that you got this place to study in. Had we not others to depend upon for your studies, would we have in our house the means sufficient to engage a teacher? Besides, in other people’s school, tea and eatables are all ready and found; and these two years that you’ve been there for your lessons, we’ve likewise effected at home a great saving in what would otherwise have been necessary for your eating and use. Something has been, it’s true, economised; but you have further a liking for spick and span clothes. Besides, it’s only through your being there to study, that you’ve come to know Mr. Hsueeh! that Mr. Hsueeh, who has even in one year given us so much pecuniary assistance as seventy and eighty taels! And now you would go and raise a row in this school-room! why, if we were bent upon finding such another place, I tell you plainly, and once for all, that we would find it more difficult than if we tried to scale the heavens! Now do quietly play for a while, and then go to sleep, and you’ll be ever so much better for it then.” Chin Jung thereupon stifled his anger and held his tongue; and, after a short while, he in fact went to sleep of his own accord. The next day he again went to school, and no further comment need be made about it; but we will go on to explain that a young lady related to her had at one time been given in marriage to a descendant (of the eldest branch) of the Chia family, (whose names were written) with the jade radical, Chia Huang by name; but how could the whole number of members of the clan equal in affluence and power the two mansions of Ning and Jung? This fact goes, as a matter of course, without saying.","His mother, Widow Jin, overheard his muttering. ‘What have you been getting up to this time?’ she asked. ‘Look at the job we had getting you into that school. All the talks I had with your aunt and the trouble she went to to see Mrs Lian about it. Suppose we hadn’t had their help in getting you in there, we could never have afforded a tutor. What’s more, you get free tea and free dinners there, don’t you? That has meant a big saving for us during the two years you have been going there. And you’re glad enough to have something decent to wear out of the money saved, aren’t you ? And another thing. If you hadn’t been going to that school, how would you ever have met that Mr Xue of yours? Between seventy and eighty taels of silver we’ve had out of him during this past year. I can tell you this, my boy. If you get yourself thrown out of there, you needn’t think you can get in anywhere else, because you could easier fly to the moon than find another place like that. Now you just play quietly for a bit and then go to bed like a good boy!’ Thus admonished, Jokey Jin swallowed his anger and fell silent. Before long he went to bed and to sleep, and next day was back at the school again as usual. Of him no more."
寶玉看了，又見後面畫著一簇鮮花，一床破席，也有幾句言詞，寫道是：「枉自溫柔和順，空云似桂如蘭，堪羨優伶有福，誰知公子無緣。」,"Baoyu looked at it, and saw a bunch of flowers painted on the back, a broken seat, and a few words, which read: ""In vain, I am gentle and docile, and the sky is like a gui Rulan. I can envy the actors and actresses. Who knows that the son is not lucky.""","A loving noble youth in vain for love will yearn. After reading these lines, Pao-yue looked below, where was pictured a bouquet of fresh flowers and a bed covered with tattered matting. There were also several distiches running as follows: Thy self-esteem for kindly gentleness is but a fancy vain! Thy charms that they can match the olea or orchid, but thoughts inane! While an actor will, envious lot! with fortune’s smiles be born, A youth of noble birth will, strange to say, be luckless and forlorn.","And in the end you were by slanders slain, Your gentle lord’s solicitude in vain. Bao-yu could not make much sense of this, and turned to the next page. It was another picture, this time of a bunch of fresh flowers and a worn-out mat, again followed by a few lines of verse. What price your kindness and compliance, Of sweetest flower the rich perfume? You chose the player fortune favoured, Unmindful of your master’s doom."
原來近日賈母說孫女兒們太多了，一處擠著倒不便宜，只留寶玉黛玉二人這邊解悶，卻將迎、探、惜三人移到王夫人這邊房後三間小抱廈內居住，令李紈陪伴照管。,"It turns out that Mother Jia recently said that there are too many granddaughters, and it is not cheap to crowd one place. Only Baoyu and Daiyu are left here to relieve their boredom, but they move Ying, Tan, and Xi to Mrs. Wang's side, three small rooms behind the room. She lives in the Baosha, and has Li Wan to accompany her to take care of her.","The fact is that dowager lady Chia had explained that as her granddaughters were too numerous, it would not be convenient to crowd them together in one place, that Pao-yue and Tai-yue should only remain with her in this part to break her loneliness, but that Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, and Hsi Ch’un, the three of them, should move on this side in the three rooms within the antechamber, at the back of madame lady Wang’s quarters; and that Li Wan should be told off to be their attendant and to keep an eye over them.","Grandmother Jia had recently decided that her granddaughters were becoming too numerous and declared that she would retain only Bao-yu and Dai-yu in her own apartments to keep her amused. Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun were to move out into the penthouse behind Lady Wang’s, with Li Wan to supervise them and keep them company."
賈蓉看了，說：「高明的很。還要請教先生，這病與性命終久有妨無妨？」先生笑道：「大爺是最高明的人。人病到這個地位，非一朝一夕的症候，喫了這藥也要看醫緣了。依小弟看來，今年一冬是不相干的。總是過了春分，就可望全癒了。」賈蓉也是個聰明人，也不往下細問了。,"Jia Rong looked at it and said, ""It's very clever. I have to ask the master, is there any harm in this disease and the end of life?"" Taking this medicine also depends on the medical fate. According to my younger brother, this winter is irrelevant. It is always after the spring equinox, and it is expected to be fully cured.” Jia Rong is also a smart person, and she will not go into details. asked.","Chia Jung, after perusing it, exclaimed. “But I would also ask you, Doctor, to be good enough to tell me whether this illness will, in the long run, endanger her life or not?” The Doctor smiled. “You, sir, who are endowed with most eminent intelligence (are certain to know) that when a human illness has reached this phase, it is not a derangement of a day or of a single night; but after these medicines have been taken, we shall also have to watch the effect of the treatment! My humble opinion is that, as far as the winter of this year goes, there is no fear; in fact, after the spring equinox, I entertain hopes of a complete cure.” Chia Jung was likewise a person with all his wits about him, so that he did not press any further minute questions. Chia Jung forthwith escorted the Doctor and saw him off, and taking the prescription and the diagnosis, he handed them both to Chia Chen for his perusal, and in like manner recounted to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu all that had been said on the subject.","said Jia Rong, glancing at the prescription. ‘Tell me, though, doctor: just how serious is this illness? Is her life in danger?’ The doctor smiled. ‘You are an intelligent young man, Mr Jia. When an illness has reached this stage, it is not going to be cured in an afternoon. We must see how she responds to medication. As I see it, there is no real danger this winter. I should say that if she can get past the spring equinox, you could look forward to a complete recovery.’ Jia Rong was intelligent enough to understand the real import of what the doctor was telling him and did not question him further. Having first seen him out, he went in to show the prescription and written summary of the diagnosis to Cousin Zhen and gave both his parents a full account of what the doctor had said."
正值寶玉走來，見了這般形況，問是怎麼了。賈環不敢則聲。寶釵素知他家規矩，凡作兄弟的，都怕哥哥。卻不知那寶玉是不要人怕他的。他想著：「弟兄們一併都有父母教訓，何必我多事，反生疏了。況且我是正出，他是庶出，饒這樣還有人背後談論，還禁得轄治他了。」更有個呆意思存在心裏。,"Just as Baoyu came over, seeing the situation, he asked what was wrong. Jia Huan did not dare to make a sound. Baochai knew the rules of his family, and everyone who was a brother was afraid of his brother. But he didn't know that Baoyu didn't want people to be afraid of him. He thought, ""Brothers have all been taught by their parents, why should I be troubled and become estranged. Besides, I am a straight out, he is a concubine, and there are people talking about it behind his back, and it is forbidden to rule him."" A silly meaning exists in my heart.","Perceiving him in this plight, “What is the matter?” he asked; but Chia Huan had not the courage to say anything. Pao-ch’ai was well aware of the custom, which prevailed in their family, that younger brothers lived in respect of the elder brothers, but she was not however cognisant of the fact that Pao-yue would not that any one should entertain any fear of him. His idea being that elder as well as younger brothers had, all alike, father and mother to admonish them, and that there was no need for any of that officiousness, which, instead of doing good gave, on the contrary, rise to estrangement. “Besides,” (he reasoned,) “I’m the offspring of the primary wife, while he’s the son of the secondary wife, and, if by treating him as leniently as I have done, there are still those to talk about me, behind my back, how could I exercise any control over him?”","Just at that moment Bao-yu walked in, and seeing the state that Jia Huan was in, asked him what was the matter. But Jia Huan dared not say anything. Bao-chai, familiar with the state of affairs, normal in other families, which places the younger brother in fearful subjection to the elder, assumed that Jia Huan was afraid of Bao-yu. She was unaware that Bao-yu positively disliked anyone being afraid of him. ‘We are both equally subject to our parents’ control,’ he would say of himself and Jia Huan. ‘Why should I create a greater distance between us by trying to control him myself – especially when I am the wife’s son and he is the concubine ’s ? People already talk behind our backs, even when I do nothing. It would be ten times worse if I were to start bossing him about.’ But there was another, zanier, notion which contributed to this attitude."
鳳姐聽了這話，便發了興頭，說道：「你是素日知道我的，從來不信什麼是陰司地獄報應的，憑是什麼事，我說要行就行。你叫他拿三千銀子來，我就替他出這口氣。」老尼聽說，喜不自禁，忙說：「有，有！這個不難。」鳳姐又道：「我比不得他們扯蓬拉牽的圖銀子。這三千銀子，不過是給打發說去的小廝做盤纏，使他賺幾個辛苦錢，我一個錢也不要他的。便是三萬兩，我此刻也拿的出來。」老尼連忙答應，又說道：「既如此，奶奶明日就開恩也罷了。」鳳姐道：「你瞧瞧我忙的，那一處少了我？既應了你，自然快快的了結。」老尼道：「這點子事，在別人的跟前就忙的不知怎麼樣，若是奶奶的跟前，再添上些也不夠奶奶一發揮的。衹是俗語說的，『能者多勞』，太太因大小事見奶奶妥貼，越性都推給奶奶了，奶奶也要保重金體纔是。」一路話奉承的鳳姐越發受用，也不顧勞乏，更攀談起來。,"When Sister Feng heard this, she became excited and said, ""You know me all the time, and you never believe in the retribution of the underworld. What is it? I said it would do it. You asked him to bring three thousand silver. , I'll take this breath for him."" When the old man heard this, he couldn't help but hurriedly said, ""Yes, yes! It's not difficult."" Sister Feng added, ""I can't compare to the money they slapped. The three thousand silver is just for the little servant who sent him to earn some hard money, and I don't want him at all. Even thirty thousand taels, I can take it out right now."" The old man hurriedly He agreed, and said, ""If that's the case, grandma will be kind to you tomorrow."" Sister Feng said, ""Look at how busy I am, where is I missing? Since I have complied with you, it will be settled quickly."" : ""I don't know how to be busy in front of other people. If grandma is in front of me, adding some more will not be enough for grandma. It's just as the saying goes, 'Those who can work harder', my wife will see you for big and small matters. Grandma is right, the more sex is pushed to grandma, and grandma has to take good care of her body.” Sister Feng, who was flattering all the way, became more and more useful, and even though she was tired, she started talking.","ear ; they scattered to the winds her vain hopes. After a minute or so she heaved a sigh. “What you say may be true enough,” she remarked; “but the Chang family are also aware that I mean to come and make my appeal to your mansion; and were you now not to manage this affair, the Chang family having no idea that the lack of time prevents any steps being taken and that no importance is attached to their presents, it will appear, on the contrary, as if there were not even this little particle of skill in your household.” At these words lady Feng felt at once inspirited. “You’ve known of old,” she added, “that I’ve never had any faith in anything concerning retribution in the Court of Judgment in the unseen or in hell; and that whatever I say that I shall do, that I do; tell them therefore to bring three thousand taels; and I shall then remedy this grievance of theirs.” The old nun upon hearing this remark was so exceedingly delighted, that she precipitately exclaimed, “They’ve got it, they’ve got it! there will be no difficulty about it.” “I’m not,” lady Feng went on to add, “like those people, who afford help and render assistance with an eye to money; these three thousand taels will be exclusively devoted for the travelling expenses of those youths, who will be sent to deliver messages and for them to make a few cash for their trouble; but as for me I don’t want even so much as a cash. In fact I’m able at this very moment to produce as much as thirty thousand taels.” The old nun assented with alacrity, and said by way of reply, “If that be so, my lady, do display your charitable bounty at once to-morrow and bring things to an end.” “Just see,” remarked lady Feng, “how hard pressed I am; which place can do without me? but since I’ve given you my word, I shall, needless to say, speedily bring the matter to a close.” “A small trifle like this,” hinted the old nun, “would, if placed in the hands of any one else, flurry her to such an extent that she would be quite at a loss what to do; but in your hands, my lady, even if much more were superadded, it wouldn’t require as much exertion as a wave of your hand. But the proverb well says: ‘that those who are able have much to do;’ for madame Wang, seeing that your ladyship manages all concerns, whether large or small, properly, has still more shoved the burden of everything on your shoulders, my lady; but you should, it’s but right, also take good care of your precious health.” This string of flattery pleased lady Feng more and more, so that heedless of fatigue she went on to chat with still greater zest.","This put Xi-feng on her mettle. ‘You’ve known me a long time,’ she said. ‘You know that I’ve never believed all that talk about hell and damnation. If I decide that I want to do something I do it, no matter what it is. Tell them that if they are prepared to pay out three thousand taels of silver, I will undertake to relieve them of their trouble.’ The prioress was delighted. ‘They will! They will! No doubt about it!’ ‘Mind you,’ said Xi-feng, ‘I’m not one of your money-grubbing run-of-the-mill go-betweens. I’m not doing this for the money. Every bit of this three thousand taels will go into the pockets of my boys or towards their expenses. l shan’t touch a penny of it. If it was money I wanted, I could lay my hands on thirty thousand taels at this very moment.’ ‘Well, that’s nicely settled!’ said the prioress. ‘So can we look forward to your kind help in this matter tomorrow ? We may as well get it over and done with.’ ‘You can see how busy I am and how impossible it is for me to get away,’ said Xi-feng. ‘ I’ve told you I’ll do it, and so I will – in my own time. Surely that is enough for you?’ ‘A little thing like this might seem a great deal of trouble to some people,’ said the old nun artfully, ‘but even if it involved more than it does, it would still be nothing to a capable person like you, Mrs Lian. You know what they say: “The able man gets little leisure ” – that’s why Her Ladyship leaves everything to you. She knows how capable you are. Of course, you have to be careful that you don’t overtax yourself. Your health is precious!’ Soothed by such flatteries, Xi-feng forgot her weariness, and the conversation continued with animation."
這裏林黛玉見寶玉去了，又聽見眾姊妹也不在房，自己悶悶的。正欲回房，剛走到梨香院牆角上，只聽牆內笛韻悠揚，歌聲婉轉。林黛玉便知是那十二個女孩子演習戲文呢。衹是林黛玉素習不大喜看戲文，便不留心，只管往前走。偶然兩句吹到耳內，明明白白，一字不落，唱道是：「原來奼紫嫣紅開遍，似這般都付與斷井頹垣。」林黛玉聽了，倒也十分感慨纏綿，便止住步側耳細聽，又聽唱道是：「良辰美景奈何天，賞心樂事誰家院。」聽了這兩句，不覺點頭自嘆，心下自思道：「原來戲上也有好文章。可惜世人只知看戲，未必能領略這其中的趣味。」想畢，又後悔不該胡想，耽誤了聽曲子。又側耳時，只聽唱道：「則為你如花美眷，似水流年……」林黛玉聽了這兩句，不覺心動神搖。又聽道：「你在幽閨自憐」等句，亦發如醉如癡，站立不住，便一蹲身坐在一塊山子石上，細嚼「如花美眷，似水流年」八個字的滋味。忽又想起前日見古人詩中有「水流花謝兩無情」之句，再又有詞中有「流水落花春去也，天上人間」之句，又兼方纔所見《西廂記》中「花落水流紅，閑愁萬種」之句，都一時想起來，湊聚在一處。仔細忖度，不覺心痛神癡，眼中落淚。正沒個開交，忽覺背上擊了一下，及回頭看時，原來是——且聽下回分解。正是：妝晨繡夜心無矣，對月臨風恨有之。,"Here, when Lin Daiyu saw Baoyu gone, and heard that the sisters were not in the room, she felt sullen. Just as I was about to go back to my room, I just walked to the corner of the Lixiang Courtyard, only to hear the melodious rhythm of the flute and the melodious singing in the wall. Lin Daiyu knew that it was the twelve girls who practiced drama. It's just that Lin Daiyu didn't like to read drama, so she didn't pay attention and just walked forward. Occasionally, two sentences blew into my ears, clearly and clearly, without falling out of a word, and sang: ""It turned out that the purple and red bloomed all over the place, and it seemed that they were all paid to the broken well and the ruins."" Bu turned his ears and listened carefully, and then heard the sing: ""The good times are beautiful and the sky is the sky, who's family is enjoying the pleasures."" After listening to these two sentences, he nodded and sighed, thinking to himself: ""So there are also good articles in the play. It's a pity that people in the world only know how to watch the play, and they may not be able to appreciate the fun of it."" After thinking about it, he regretted that he shouldn't have been thinking about it and delayed listening to the music. When she turned her ears again, she only heard the singing: ""Then you are like flowers and beautiful family, like water..."" Lin Daiyu heard these two sentences, and her heart was shaken. Hearing again: ""You are pitying yourself in a secluded boudoir,"" and so on, he was also intoxicated, unable to stand up, so he squatted down on a mountain rock and chewed on the words ""like flowers and beautiful family members, like water."" taste. I suddenly remembered the sentence that I saw in an ancient poem the day before yesterday, ""the water flows and the flowers are merciless"", and then there is a sentence in the poem, ""the water falls and the flowers go away in the spring, the heaven and earth"", and also I just saw in ""The Story of the West Chamber"" that ""the flowers fall and the water flows."" ""Red, there are ten thousand kinds of worries"", all of them suddenly remembered and gathered together. After thinking about it carefully, I didn't feel heartache, tears welling up in my eyes. Just as he was about to start a relationship, he suddenly felt a blow on his back, and when he looked back, it turned out to be—let’s listen to the next decomposition. Exactly: makeup morning embroidery night has no heart, hatred for Yue Linfeng.","But during this while, Lin Tai-yue was, after having seen Pao-yue walk away, and heard that all her cousins were likewise not in their rooms, wending her way back alone, in a dull and dejected mood, towards her apartment, when upon reaching the outside corner of the wall of the Pear Fragrance court, she caught, issuing from inside the walls, the harmonious strains of the fife and the melodious modulations of voices singing. Lin Tai-yue readily knew that it was the twelve singing-girls rehearsing a play; and though she did not give her mind to go and listen, yet a couple of lines were of a sudden blown into her ears, and with such clearness, that even one word did not escape. Their burden was this: These troth are beauteous purple and fine carmine flowers, which in this way all round do bloom, And all together lie ensconced along the broken well, and the dilapidated wall! But the moment Lin Tai-yue heard these lines, she was, in fact, so intensely affected and agitated that she at once halted and lending an ear listened attentively to what they went on to sing, which ran thus: A glorious day this is, and pretty scene, but sad I feel at heart! Contentment and pleasure are to be found in whose family courts? After overhearing these two lines, she unconsciously nodded her head, and sighed, and mused in her own mind. “Really,” she thought, “there is fine diction even in plays! but unfortunately what men in this world simply know is to see a play, and they don’t seem to be able to enjoy the beauties contained in them.” At the conclusion of this train of thought, she experienced again a sting of regret, (as she fancied) she should not have given way to such idle thoughts and missed attending to the ballads; but when she once more came to listen, the song, by some coincidence, went on thus: It’s all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely spring, That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream. When this couplet struck Tai-yu’s ear , her heart felt suddenly a prey to excitement and her soul to emotion; and upon further hearing the words: Alone you sit in the secluded inner rooms to self-compassion giving way. --and other such lines, she became still more as if inebriated, and like as if out of her head, and unable to stand on her feet, she speedily stooped her body, and, taking a seat on a block of stone, she minutely pondered over the rich beauty of the eight characters: It’s all because thy loveliness is like a flower and like the comely spring, That years roll swiftly by just like a running stream. Of a sudden, she likewise bethought herself of the line: Water flows away and flowers decay, for both no feelings have. --which she had read some days back in a poem of an ancient writer, and also of the passage: When on the running stream the flowers do fall, spring then is past and gone; --and of: Heaven (differs from) the human race, --which also appeared in that work; and besides these, the lines, which she had a short while back read in the Hsi Hiang Chi: The flowers, lo, fall, and on their course the waters red do flow! Petty misfortunes of ten thousand kinds (my heart assail!) both simultaneously flashed through her memory; and, collating them all together, she meditated on them minutely, until suddenly her heart was stricken with pain and her soul fleeted away, while from her eyes trickled down drops of tears. But while nothing could dispel her present state of mind, she unexpectedly realised that some one from behind gave her a tap; and, turning her head round to look, she found that it was a young girl; but who it was, the next chapter will make known. CHAPTER XXIV.","With Bao-yu gone and the girls evidently all out, Dai-yu began to feel lonely and depressed. She was on her way back to her own room and was just passing by the corner of Pear Tree Court when she heard the languorous meanderings of a flute and the sweet modulation of a girlish voice coming from the other side of the wall, and knew that the twelve little actresses were at their rehearsal inside. Although she was paying no particular attention to the singing, a snatch of it chanced suddenly to fall with very great clarity on her ear, so that she was able to make out quite distinctly the words of two whole lines of the aria being sung: ‘Here multiflorate splendour blooms forlorn Midst broken fountains, mouldering walls -’ They moved her strangely, and she stopped to listen. The voice went on: ‘And the bright air, the brilliant morn Feed my despair. Joy and gladness have withdrawn To other gardens, other halls -’ At this point the listener unconsciously nodded her head and sighed. ‘It’s true,’ she thought, ‘there is good poetry even in plays. What a pity most people think of them only as entertainment. A lot of the real beauty in them must go unappreciated.’ She suddenly became aware that her mind was wandering and regretted that her inattention had caused her to miss some of the singing. She listened again. This time it was another voice: ‘Because for you, my flowerlike fair, The swift years like the waters flow -’ The words moved her to the depth of her being. ‘I have sought you everywhere, And at last I find you here, In a dark room full of woe -’ It was like intoxication, a sort of delirium. Her legs would no longer support her. She collapsed on to a near-by rockery and crouched there, the words turning over and over in her mind: Because for you, my flowerlike fair, The swift years like the waters flow… Suddenly she thought of a line from an old poem she had read quite recently: Relentlessly the waters flow, the flowers fade. From that her mind turned to those famous lines written in his captivity by the tragic poet-emperor of Later Tang: The blossoms fall, the water flows, The glory of the spring is gone In nature’s world as in the human one - and to some lines from The Western Chamber which she had just been reading: As flowers fall and the flowing stream runs red, A thousand sickly fancies crowd the mind. All these different lines and verses combined into a single overpowering impression, riving her soul with a pang of such keen anguish that the tears started from her eyes. She might have remained’there indefinitely, weeping and comfortless , had not someone just at that moment come up behind her and tapped her on the shoulder. She turned to look and saw that it was - But if you wish to know who it was, you must read the next chapter !"
賈璉已經笑著去了，到了前面見了賈政，果然是小和尚一事。賈璉便依了鳳姐主意，說道：「如今看來，芹兒倒大大的出息了，這件事竟交與他去管辦。橫豎照在裏頭的規例，每月叫芹兒支領就是了。」賈政原不大理論這些事，聽賈璉如此說，便如此依了。賈璉回到房中告訴鳳姐兒，鳳姐即命人去告訴了周氏。賈芹便來見賈璉夫妻兩個，感謝不盡。鳳姐又作情央賈璉先支三個月的，叫他寫了領字，賈璉批票畫了押，登時發了對牌出去。銀庫上按數發出三個月的供給來，白花花二三百兩。賈芹隨手拈一塊，撂與掌平的人，叫他們喫茶罷。於是命小廝拿回家，與母親商議。登時雇了大腳驢，自己騎上；又雇了幾輛車，至榮國府角門，喚出二十四個人來，坐上車，一徑往城外鐵檻寺去了。當下無話。,"Jia Lian had already left with a smile, and when he got to the front, he met Jia Zheng, and it really was about the little monk. Jia Lian followed Sister Feng's suggestion and said, ""Now it seems that Qin'er is very promising, and this matter is actually handed over to him. The rules are laid out horizontally and vertically, and it's enough to call Qin'er to lead each month. ""Jia Zhengyuan didn't think much about these things, but after hearing what Jia Lian said, he followed it. Jia Lian returned to the room and told Sister Feng, who immediately ordered someone to tell the Zhou family. Jia Qin came to see Jia Lian and his wife, thanking them endlessly. Sister Feng also fell in love with Jia Lian for three months, and asked him to write the collar. The treasury issued a three-month supply according to the number, and the white flower spent two or three hundred taels. Jia Qin picked up a piece at random, and asked the people who were on the same level to have tea. So he ordered the little servant to take it home and discuss it with his mother. Immediately, he hired a big-footed donkey and rode it on his own; he hired a few carts to the corner gate of Rongguo Mansion, summoned twenty-four men, got on the carts, and went all the way to the Tiejian Temple outside the city. Speechless at the moment.","Lady Feng, upon hearing these words, burst out laughing with a sound of Ch’ih, and spurting disdainfully at Chia Lien, she lowered her head and went on at once with her meal; during which time Chia Lien speedily walked away laughing the while, and betook himself to the front, where he saw Chia Cheng. It was, indeed, about the young bonzes, and Chia Lien readily carried out lady Feng’s suggestion. “As from all appearances,” he continued, “Ch’in Erh has, actually, so vastly improved, this job should, after all, be entrusted to his care and management; and provided that in observance with the inside custom Ch’in Erh were each day told to receive the advances, things will go on all right.” And as Chia Cheng had never had much attention to give to such matters of detail, he, as soon as he heard what Chia Lien had to say, immediately signified his approval and assent. And Chia Lien, on his return to his quarters, communicated the issue to lady Feng; whereupon lady Feng at once sent some one to go and notify dame Chou. Chia Ch’in came, in due course, to pay a visit to Chia Lien and his wife, and was incessant in his expressions of gratitude; and lady Feng bestowed upon him a further favour by giving him, as a first instalment, an advance of the funds necessary for three months’ outlay, for which she bade him write a receipt; while Chia Lien filled up a cheque and signed it; and a counter-order was simultaneously issued, and he came out into the treasury where the sum specified for three months’ supplies, amounting to three hundred taels, was paid out in pure ingots. Chia Ch’in took the first piece of silver that came under his hand, and gave it to the men in charge of the scales, with which he told them to have a cup of tea, and bidding, shortly after, a boy-servant take the money to his home, he held consultation with his mother; after which, he hired a donkey for himself to ride on, and also bespoke several carriages, and came to the back gate of the Jung Kuo mansion; where having called out the twenty young priests, they got into the carriages, and sped straightway beyond the city walls, to the Temple of the Iron Fence, where nothing of any note transpired at the time. But we will now notice Chia Yuean-ch’un, within the precincts of the Palace.","On entering Jia Zheng’s presence he found that the subject was, as Xi-feng had anticipated, the arrangements for accommodating the little nuns, and he replied as Xi-feng had instructed him: ‘Jia Qin is a promising young fellow. I think he could be entrusted with the job. In any case, he would be drawing the allowance from Accounts each month when all the other payments are made, so we should be able to keep an eye on him.’ Jia Zheng never took much interest in these trivial domestic matters and agreed readily enough to Jia Lian’s suggestion. The latter returned to his apartment and reported to Xi-feng. Xi-feng sent someone to inform Zhou-shi; and soon Jia Qin himself had arrived and was pouring out his gratitude to the two benefactors. With a show of conferring further favours, Xi-feng ‘begged’ Jia Lian to allow Jia Qin three months’ payment in advance. A receipt was written for this amount and Jia Lian’s seal affixed to it, and there and then Jia Qin was issued with a tally and sent to the counting-house to collect the money. When the three hundred taels of shining silver had been weighed and counted and handed over, Jia Qin picked up a piece at random and tossed it to the cashiers to ‘buy themselves a cup of tea with’. He had a boy to carry the money back home for him, and after taking counsel with his mother he hired a stout little donkey for himself to ride on and four or five covered mule-carts for the nuns, and conducting the carts round to the side gate of the Rong-guo mansion, he called forth the twenty-four little nuns and packed them all inside. Then off they set, with Jia Qin on his donkey at the head of the procession, to the Temple of the Iron Threshold outside the city. And there we leave them."
續畢，擲筆就寢。頭剛著枕便安然睡去，一夜竟不知所之，直至天明方醒。翻身看時，只見襲人和衣睡在衾上。寶玉將昨日的事已付與度外，便推他說道：「起來好生睡，看凍著了。」,"Continued, throw a pen to bed. As soon as he put his head on the pillow, he fell asleep peacefully, and he didn't know what to do all night until he woke up in the morning. When I turned over to look, I saw Xi and Yi sleeping on the quilt. Baoyu had paid for what happened yesterday, pushed him and said, ""I woke up and fell asleep, I'm freezing.""","At the conclusion of this annex, he flung the pen away, and lay himself down to sleep. His head had barely reached the pillow before he at once fell fast asleep, remaining the whole night long perfectly unconscious of everything straight up to the break of day, when upon waking and turning himself round, he, at a glance, caught sight of no one else than Hsi Jen, sleeping in her clothes over the coverlet. Pao-yue had already banished from his mind every thought of what had transpired the previous day, so that forthwith giving Hsi Jen a push: “Get up!” he said, “and be careful where you sleep, as you may catch cold.”","Having written these lines, he threw down the brush and went straight to bed. He was asleep almost as soon as his head touched the pillow and remained dead to the world throughout the whole of that night. Waking with the first light next morning, he sat up in bed to find Aroma lying fully clothed beside him outside the covers. He roused her with a gentle shake, all yesterday’s unpleasantness now quite forgotten: ‘Go to bed properly! You’ll get cold, sleeping like that!’"
賈妃看畢，稱賞一番，又笑道：「終是薛林二妹之作與眾不同，非愚姊妹可同列者。」原來林黛玉安心今夜大展奇才，將眾人壓倒，不想賈妃只命一匾一詠，倒不好違諭多作，只胡亂作一首五言律應景罷了。,"After seeing it, Concubine Jia praised her and said with a smile: ""In the end, it is the work of the second sister Xue Lin that is different, and the sisters Feiyu can be on the same list."" It is not advisable to violate the order and write more than one scripture and one chant, and just randomly write a five-character rhythm to suit the occasion.","Lin Tao-yue had, in point of fact, made up her mind to display, on this evening, her extraordinary abilities to their best advantage, and to put down every one else, but contrary to her expectations the Chia consort had expressed her desire that no more than a single stanza should be written on each tablet, so that unable, after all, to disregard her directions by writing anything in excess , she had no help but to compose a pentameter stanza, in an offhand way, merely with the intent of complying with her wishes.","she and we this favour hope to gain: That oft-times she may pass this way again! As soon as she had finished reading the poems, Yuan-chun praised them all warmly. ‘ But Cousin Lin’s and Cousin Xue’s poems are specially good,’ she said. ‘Our Jia girls are no match for them!’ Dai-yu had confidently expected that this night would give her an opportunity of deploying her talents to the full and amazing everyone with her genius. It was very disappointing that no more had been required of her than a single little poem and an inscription; and though she was obliged to confine herself to what the Imperial Concubine had commanded, she had composed her octet without enthusiasm and in very perfunctory manner."
話說寶玉在林黛玉房中說「耗子精」，寶釵撞來，諷刺寶玉元宵不知「綠蠟」之典，三人正在房中互相譏刺取笑。那寶玉正恐黛玉飯後貪眠，一時存了食，或夜間走了困，皆非保養身體之法；幸而寶釵走來，大家談笑，那林黛玉方不欲睡，自己纔放了心。忽聽他房中嚷起來，大家側耳聽了一聽，林黛玉先笑道：「這是你媽媽和襲人叫嚷呢。那襲人也罷了，你媽媽再要認真排場他，可見老背晦了。」,"It is said that Baoyu said ""mouse essence"" in Lin Daiyu's room, Baochai bumped into it, satirizing Baoyu's ignorance of the ""green wax"" code of Lantern Festival, and the three were sneering and making fun of each other in the room. That Baoyu was afraid that Daiyu would be greedy for sleep after a meal, and that she would save food for a while, or to be sleepy at night, all of which were not ways to take care of her body; fortunately, Baochai came over and everyone was chatting and laughing. . Hearing the shouting in his room suddenly, everyone listened carefully, Lin Daiyu laughed first: ""This is your mother yelling at people. It's okay to attack people. If your mother plays him seriously, it can be seen that the old back is dark. .""","Pao-yue was in Tai yue’s apartments relating about the rat-elves, when Pao-ch’ai entered unannounced, and began to gibe Pao-yue, with trenchant irony: how that on the fifteenth of the first moon, he had shown ignorance of the allusion to the green wax; and the three of them then indulged in that room in mutual poignant satire, for the sake of fun. Pao-yue had been giving way to solicitude lest Tai-yue should, by being bent upon napping soon after her meal, be shortly getting an indigestion, or lest sleep should, at night, be completely dispelled, as neither of these things were conducive to the preservation of good health, when luckily Pao-ch’ai walked in, and they chatted and laughed together; and when Lin Tai-yue at length lost all inclination to dose, he himself then felt composed in his mind. But suddenly they heard clamouring begin in his room, and after they had all lent an ear and listened, Lin Tai-yue was the first to smile and make a remark. “It’s your nurse having a row with Hsi Jen!” she said. “Hsi Jen treats her well enough, but that nurse of yours would also like to keep her well under her thumb; she’s indeed an old dotard;” and Pao-yue was anxious to go over at once, but Pao-ch’ai laid hold of","impediment the subject of a jest We have shown how Bao-yu was in Dai-yu’s room telling her the story of the magic mice; how Bao-chai burst in on them and twitted Bao-yu with his failure to remember the ‘green wax’ allusion on the night of the Lantern Festival; and how the three of them sat teasing each other with good-humoured banter. Bao-yu had been afraid that by sleeping after her meal Dai-yu would give herself indigestion or suffer from insomnia through being insufficiently tired when she went to bed at night, but Bao-chai’s arrival and the lively conversation that followed it banished all Dai-yu’s desire to sleep and enabled him to lay aside his anxiety on her behalf. Just then a sudden commotion arose from the direction of Bao-yu’s room, and the three of them stopped talking and turned their heads to listen. Dai-yu was the first to speak: ‘That’s your Nannie quarrelling with Aroma,’ she said. ‘To think how that poor girl goes out of her way to be nice to the old woman, yet still she manages to find fault with her! She really must be getting senile.’"
後面便是一所古廟，裏面有一美人在內看經獨坐。其判云：「勘破三春景不長，緇衣頓改昔年妝。可憐繡戶侯門女，獨臥青燈古佛旁。」,"Behind is an ancient temple, where a beautiful woman sits alone reading scriptures. His judgment said: ""The three spring scenery is not long after the inspection, and the clothes have been changed from the old makeup. The poor embroidered family Houmen girl, lying alone next to the ancient Buddha with green lights.""","Below, was an old temple, in the interior of which was a beautiful person, just in the act of reading the religious manuals, as she sat all alone; with this inscription: In light esteem thou hold’st the charms of the three springs for their short-liv’d fate; Thine attire of past years to lay aside thou chang’st, a Taoist dress to don; How sad, alas! of a reputed house and noble kindred the scion, Alone, behold! she sleeps under a glimmering light, an old idol for mate.","After this was an old temple with a beautiful girl sitting all on her own inside it reading a Buddhist sutra. The words said: When you see through the spring scene’s transient state, A nun’s black habit shall replace your own. Alas, that daughter of so great a house By Buddha’s altar lamp should sleep alone!"
二人正計較，就有賈政遣人來回賈母說：「二月二十二日子好，哥兒姐兒們好搬進去的。這幾日內遣人進去分派收拾。」薛寶釵住了蘅蕪苑，林黛玉住了瀟湘館，賈迎春住了綴錦樓，探春住了秋爽齋，惜春住了蓼風軒，李氏住了稻香村，寶玉住了怡紅院。每一處添兩個老嬤嬤，四個丫頭，除各人奶娘親隨丫鬟不算外，另有專管收拾打掃的。至二十二日，一齊進去，登時園內花招繡帶，柳拂香風，不似前番那等寂寞了。,"The two were arguing when Jia Zheng sent someone back and forth to Jia's mother saying, ""It's a good day on the 22nd of the second lunar month. Brothers and sisters are welcome to move in. In the next few days, people will be dispatched to arrange cleaning."" Xue Baochai lived in Hengwu Garden, Lin Daiyu lived in Xiaoxiang Pavilion, Jia Yingchun lived in Zhuijinlou, Tanchun lived in Qiushuangzhai, Xichun lived in Liaofengxuan, Li lived in Daoxiang Village, and Baoyu lived in Yihong Courtyard. In each place, two old maids and four maids were added. Except for the nanny who personally followed the maids, there was another one who was in charge of cleaning up. On the 22nd, they went in together, and when the garden was embroidered with tricks, Liu Fuxiangfeng was not as lonely as the previous episode.","he remarked; “I too would like you to go and live in there; and as I am to stay in the I Hung Yuan, we two will be, in the first place, near each other; and next, both in quiet and secluded spots.” While the two of them were conversing, a servant came, sent over by Chia Cheng, to report to dowager lady Chia that: “The 22nd of the second moon was a propitious day for Pao-yue and the young ladies to shift their quarters into the garden; that during these few days, servants should be sent in to put things in their proper places and to clean; that Hsueh Pao-ch’ai should put up in the Heng Wu court; that Lin Tai-yue was to live in the Hsiao Hsiang lodge; that Chia Ying-ch’un should move into the Cho Chin two-storied building; that T’an Ch’un should put up in the Ch’iu Yen library; that Hsi Ch’un should take up her quarters in the Liao Feng house; that widow Li should live in the Tao Hsiang village, and that Pao-yue was to live in the I Hung court. That at every place two old nurses should be added and four servant-girls; that exclusive of the nurse and personal waiting-maid of each, there should, in addition, be servants, whose special duties should be to put things straight and to sweep the place; and that on the 22nd, they should all, in a body, move into the garden.” When this season drew near, the interior of the grounds, with the flowers waving like embroidered sashes, and the willows fanned by the fragrant breeze, was no more as desolate and silent as it had been in previous days; but without indulging in any further irrelevant details, we shall now go back to Pao-yue.","They were still discussing their plans when a servant arrived from Jia Zheng with a message for Grandmother Jia. It was to say that the twenty-second of the second month being a Lucky Day was the date on which Bao-yu and the girls were to move into the garden. Servants were to be allowed inside in the interim in order to make the rooms ready for them. It was finally settled that Bao-chai should have All-spice Court, Dai-yu the Naiad’s House, Ying-chun the building on Amaryllis Eyot, Tan-chun the Autumn Studio, Xi-chun the Lotus Pavilion, Li Wan Sweet-rice Village, and Bao-yu the House of Green Delights. Each set of rooms was allotted two old women and four maids in addition to the occupant’s existing maids and nannies, and there were other servants whose sole duty was sweeping and cleaning. On the twenty-second of the second month everyone moved in. The silent, deserted garden suddenly came to life - Live flowers on silk-embroidered flowers up-glanced, And unguent scents the scents of spring enhanced as the bevy of gaily-dressed, chattering girls spread themselves through its quiet walks."
賈蓉在身旁燈影下悄拉鳳姐的衣襟，鳳姐會意，因笑道：「你也太操心了，難道大爺比咱們還不會用人？偏你又怕他不在行了。誰都是在行的？孩子們已長的這麼大了，『沒喫過豬肉，也看見過豬跑』。大爺派他去，原不過是個坐纛旗兒，難道認真的叫他去講價錢會經紀去呢！依我說就很好。」賈璉道：「自然是這樣。並不是我駁回，少不得替他算計算計。」因問：「這一項銀子動那一處的？」賈薔道：「纔也議到這裏，賴爺爺說，不用從京裏帶下去，江南甄家還收著我們五萬銀子。明日寫一封書信會票我們帶去，先支三萬，下剩二萬存著，等置辦花燭彩燈並各色簾櫳帳幔的使費。」賈璉點頭道：「這個主意好。」,"Jia Rong quietly pulled Sister Feng's clothes under the shadow of the lamp beside her. Sister Feng understood and smiled, ""You are too worried, don't you think the uncle can't use people better than us? But you're afraid that he won't be able to do it anymore. Everyone is good at it. Yes? The children have grown so big, ""haven't eaten pork, and have seen pigs run"". The uncle sent him there, but he was just sitting on the flag, did he seriously ask him to negotiate the price and meet the broker! It's good if I say it."" Jia Lian said, ""Of course it's like this. It's not that I reject it, and I have to do some calculations for him."" Yin asked, ""Where does this item of money move?"" Jia Qiang said, ""That's right. When we got here, Grandpa Lai said that we don't need to take it from Beijing. The Zhen family in Jiangnan still has 50,000 silver from us. We will write a letter tomorrow and we will take it with us. We will pay 30,000 first, and keep the remaining 20,000. The cost of buying candles, lanterns and curtains of various colors."" Jia Lian nodded and said, ""That's a good idea.""","Chia Jung was standing next to lady Feng, out of the light of the lamp, and stealthily pulled the lapel of her dress. Lady Feng understood the hint, and putting on a smiling expression, “You are too full of fears!” she interposed. “Is it likely that our uncle Chen doesn’t, after all, know better than we do what men to employ, that you again give way to apprehensions that he isn’t up to the mark! but who are those who are, in every respect, up to the mark? These young fellows have grown up already to this age, and if they haven’t eaten any pork, they have nevertheless seen a pig run. If Mr. Chen has deputed him to go, he is simply meant to sit under the general’s standard; and do you imagine, forsooth, that he has, in real earnest, told him to go and bargain about the purchase money, and to interview the brokers himself ? My own idea is that (the choice) is a very good one.” “Of course it is!” observed Chia Lien; “but it isn’t that I entertain any wish to be factious; my only object is to devise some plan or other for him. Whence will,” he therefore went on to ask, “the money required for this purpose come from?” “A little while ago the deliberations reached this point,” rejoined Chia Se; “and Mr. Lai suggested that there was no necessity at all to take any funds from the capital, as the Chen family, in Chiang Nan, had still in their possession Tls. 50,000 of our money. That he would to-morrow write a letter of advice and a draft for us to take along, and that we should, first of all, obtain cash to the amount of Tls. 30,000, and let the balance of Tls. 20,000 remain over, for the purchase of painted lanterns, and coloured candles, as well as for the outlay for every kind of portieres, banners, curtains and streamers.” Chia Lien nodded his head. “This plan is first-rate!” he added.","Jia Rong, who was standing somewhat away from the light, availed himself of the shadow’s concealment to give Xi-feng’s dress a surreptitious tug. She understood perfectly well what his meaning was, but pretended not to, dismissing him with a curt wave of the hand and addressing herself instead to Jia Lian: ‘Don’t be so officious, Lian! Cousin Zhen is no less capable of choosing the right person for the job than we are. What do you mean by asking the boy if he’s qualified ? He’s as much qualified as any of the rest of us. He’s old enough to have seen a pig run, even if he’s not old enough to have eaten pork! In any case, I’m sure Cousin Zhen only chose him as a figurehead. You don’t seriously suppose that he’ll be the one to discuss prices and deal with the business side of the expedition ? -I think myself it’s a very good choice!’ ‘Of course it is,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I don’t dispute it. I merely thought we ought to do a few of his sums for him before he goes. Where is the money for this coming from?’ he asked Jia Qiang. ‘We were discussing that just now,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘ Gaffer Lai says that there’s no point in taking money with us from here. He says the Zhens of Kiangnan hold fifty thousand taels of ours on deposit and he can give us a letter of credit to take to them when we go. We’ll draw out thirty thousand first and leave the rest to buy lanterns, lamps, and curtains with later on.’ Jia Lian nodded appreciatively. ‘Good idea.’"
於是，賈蓉同了進去。到了賈蓉居室，見了秦氏，向賈蓉說道：「這就是尊夫人了？」賈蓉道：「正是。請先生坐下，讓我把賤內的病說一說再看脈如何？」那先生道：「依小弟的意思，竟先看過脈再說的為是。我是初造尊府的，本也不曉得什麼，但是我們馮大爺務必叫小弟過來看看，小弟所以不得不來。如今看了脈息，看小弟說的是不是，再將這些日子的病勢講一講，大家斟酌一個方兒，可用不可用，那時大爺再定奪。」賈蓉道：「先生實在高明，如今恨相見之晚。就請先生看一看脈息，可治不可治，以便使家父母放心。」於是家下媳婦們捧過大迎枕來，一面給秦氏拉著袖口，露出脈來。先生方伸手按在右手脈上，調息了至數，寧神細診了有半刻的工夫，方換過左手，亦復如是。診畢脈息，說道：「我們外邊坐罷。」,"So, Jia Rong went in with him. When I got to Jia Rong's room, I saw Mrs. Qin, and said to Jia Rong, ""This is Mrs. Zun?"" Jia Rong said, ""Exactly. Sir, please sit down and let me talk about the slum's illness and then check the pulse?"" That gentleman said: ""According to the meaning of my younger brother, I have to look at the pulse first and then say it is true. I am the first time to build the Zunfu, and I don't know anything, but our uncle Feng must ask my younger brother to come and have a look, so my younger brother has to come. Now I have read the pulse, see if the younger brother is saying, and then tell me about the condition of these days, everyone can decide whether to use it or not, then the uncle will decide."" Jia Rong said: ""Sir is really brilliant, and now I hate to see each other. In the evening, please ask the master to take a look at the pulse, it can be cured or not, so as to reassure the parents."" So the daughter-in-law of the family held the big welcome pillow, and pulled the cuff of Qin's cuff to reveal the pulse. Mr. Fang stretched out his hand and pressed the pulse on his right hand, adjusted his breath to a few counts, Ning Shen examined it carefully for half a moment, then Fang changed his left hand, and the same was true. After checking the pulse, he said, ""Let's sit outside.""","Chia Jung forthwith walked in with him. When they reached the inner apartment, and he caught sight of Mrs. Ch’in, he turned round and asked Chia Jung, “This is your honourable spouse, isn’t it?” “Yes, it is,” assented Chia Jung; “but please, Doctor, take a seat, and let me tell you the symptoms of my humble wife’s ailment, before her pulse be felt. Will this do?” “My mean idea is,” remarked the Doctor, “that it would, after all, be better that I should begin by feeling her pulse, before I ask you to inform me what the source of the ailment is. This is the first visit I pay to your honourable mansion; besides, I possess no knowledge of anything; but as our worthy Mr. Feng would insist upon my coming over to see you, I had in consequence no alternative but to come. After I have now made a diagnosis, you can judge whether what I say is right or not, before you explain to me the phases of the complaint during the last few days, and we can deliberate together upon some prescription; as to the suitableness or unsuitableness of which your honourable father will then have to decide, and what is necessary will have been done.” “Doctor,” rejoined Chia Jung, “you are indeed eminently clear sighted; all I regret at present is that we have met so late! But please, Doctor, diagnose the state of the pulse, so as to find out whether there be hope of a cure or not; if a cure can be effected, it will be the means of allaying the solicitude of my father and mother.” The married women attached to that menage forthwith presented a pillow; and as it was being put down for Mrs. Ch’in to rest her arm on, they raised the lower part of her sleeve so as to leave her wrist exposed. The Doctor thereupon put out his hand and pressed it on the pulse of the right hand. Regulating his breath (to the pulsation) so as to be able to count the beatings, he with due care and minuteness felt the action for a considerable time, when, substituting the left hand, he again went through the same operation. “Let us go and sit outside,” he suggested, after he had concluded feeling her pulses.","He left the doctor in the charge of Jia Rong, who conducted him through the inner part of the house to his own apartment, where Qin-shi was. ‘Is this the lady?’ asked the doctor. ‘Yes, this is my wife,’ Jia Rong replied. ‘Do sit down! I expect you would like me to describe her symptoms first, before you take the pulse?’ ‘If you will permit me, no,’ said the doctor. ‘I think it would be better if I took the pulse first and asked you about the development of the illness afterwards. This is the first time I have been to your house, and as I am not a skilled practitioner and have only come here at our friend Mr Feng ’s insistence , I think I should take the pulse and give you my diagnosis first. We can go on to talk about her symptoms and discuss a course of treatment if you are satisfied with the diagnosis. And of course, it will still be up to you to decide whether or not the treatment I prescribe is to be followed.’ ‘You speak with real authority, doctor,’ said Jia Rong. ‘I only wish we had got to hear of you earlier. Take her pulse now, then, and let us know whether what she has can be cured, so that my parents may be spared further anxiety.’ At this point Qin-shi ’s women carried in a large arm-rest of the kind used in consultations, propped her forward with her arms across it, and drew back her sleeves, exposing both arms at the wrist. The doctor stretched out his hand and laid it on her right wrist, then, having first regulated his own breathing in order to be able to count the rate, he felt the pulses with great concentration for the space of several minutes, after which he transferred to the left wrist and spent an equal amount of time on that. This done, he proposed that they should withdraw to the outside room to talk."
一時寬衣安歇的時節，鳳姐在裏間，秦鍾寶玉在外間，滿地下皆是家下婆子，打鋪坐更。鳳姐因怕通靈玉失落，便等寶玉睡下，命人拿來 在自己枕邊。寶玉不知與秦鍾算何帳目，未見真切，未曾記得，此係疑案，不敢纂創。,"When it was time to undress and rest for a while, Sister Feng was inside, Qin Zhongbaoyu was outside, and the whole ground was full of wives, sitting in the shop and sitting. Fearing that the psychic jade would be lost, Sister Feng waited for Baoyu to fall asleep and ordered someone to bring it beside her pillow. Baoyu didn't know what account he had with Qin Zhong, and he didn't see the truth or remember it.","Soon it was time to ease their clothes, and go to bed; and lady Feng occupied the inner room; Ch’in Chung and Pao-yue the outer; while the whole ground was covered with matrons of the household, who had spread their bedding, and sat watching. As lady Feng entertained fears that the jade of Spiritual Perception might be lost, she waited until Pao-yue fell asleep, when having directed a servant to bring it to her, she placed it under the side of her own pillow. What accounts Pao-yue settled with Ch’in Chung cannot be ascertained; and as in the absence of any positive proof what is known is based upon surmises, we shall not venture to place it on record.","Bedtime soon came and they partially undressed and settled down for the night, Xi-feng in an inner room and Bao-yu and Qin Zhong in an outer room adjoining it. As there were numerous old women on night duty lying about everywhere on the floor wrapped up in their bedding, Xi-feng was afraid that the ‘Magic Jade’ might disappear in the course of the night; so as soon as Bao-yu was in bed she sent someone to fetch it from him, and put it under her own pillow for safety. As for the ‘settling of accounts’ that Bao-yu had proposed to Qin Zhong, we have been unable to ascertain exactly what form this took; and as we would not for the world be guilty of a fabrication, we must allow the matter to remain a mystery."
賈珍因想著賈蓉不過是個黌門監生，靈幡經榜上寫時不好看，便是執事也不多，因此心下甚不自在。可巧這日正是首七第四日，早有大明宮掌宮內相戴權，先備了祭禮遣人來，次後坐了大轎，打傘鳴鑼，親來上祭。賈珍忙接著，讓至逗蜂軒獻茶。賈珍心中打算定了主意，因而趁便就說要與賈蓉捐個前程的話。戴權會意，因笑道：「想是為喪禮上風光些。」賈珍忙笑道：「老內相所見不差。」戴權道：「事倒湊巧，正有個美缺。如今三百員龍禁尉短了兩員，昨兒襄陽侯的兄弟老三來求我，現拿了一千五百兩銀子，送到我家裏。你知道，咱們都是老相與，不拘怎麼樣，看著他爺爺的分上，胡亂應了。還剩了一個缺，誰知永興節度使馮胖子來求，要與他孩子捐，我就沒工夫應他。既是咱們的孩子要捐，快寫個履歷來。」賈珍聽說，忙吩咐：「快命書房裏人恭敬寫了大爺的履歷來。」小廝不敢怠慢，去了一刻。便拿了一張紅紙來與賈珍。賈珍看了，忙送與戴權。看時，上面寫道：「江寧府江寧縣監生賈蓉，年二十歲。曾祖，原任京營節度使世襲一等神威將車賈代化；祖，乙卯科進士賈敬；父，世襲三品爵威烈將軍賈珍。」,"Jia Zhen felt very uncomfortable because she thought that Jia Rong was just a high school supervisor, that the list of Lingfan Sutras was not good-looking, and that there were not many deacons. Coincidentally, this day is the first seven and the fourth day. The prime minister in the palace of Daming Palace has long been in charge. First, he prepared the sacrificial ceremony and sent people to come. After that, he sat in the big sedan chair, played the umbrella and sounded the gong, and came to the sacrificial ceremony in person. Jia Zhen hurriedly followed, and asked Zhidou Fengxuan to offer tea. Jia Zhen made up her mind, so she said she wanted to donate a career to Jia Rong. Dai Quan understood, because he smiled and said, ""I think it's for the funeral."" Jia Zhen hurriedly smiled and said, ""What the old inner minister has seen is not bad."" Dai Quan said: ""It just happened to be a good thing. Long Jinwei of Baiyuan has been shorted by two members. Yesterday, the third brother of Xiangyang Hou’s brother came to beg me, and now he took 1,500 taels of silver and sent it to my house. You know, we are all old friends, no matter what , looking at his grandfather's points, he responded indiscriminately. There was one vacancy left. Who would have guessed that Feng Fatzi, the envoy of the Yongxing Jieddu, came to ask for donations with his children, and I had no time to answer him. Since our children want to donate, hurry up Write a resume."" When Jia Zhen heard that, she quickly ordered: ""Quickly order the people in the study to write down the resume of the uncle respectfully."" The servant did not dare to neglect, and went for a moment. He took a piece of red paper to talk to Jia Zhen. Jia Zhen saw it and hurriedly sent it off to Dai Quan. When looking at it, it reads: ""Jia Rong, a superintendent of Jiangning County, Jiangning Prefecture, is twenty years old. Great-grandfather, the former Jingying Jiedu envoy, inherited the first-class divine power to replace Che Jia; his ancestor, Jia Jing, a scholar of Yimao Branch; father, Jia Zhen, a hereditary third-ranking noble general.""","“Chia Jung,” pondered Chia Chen, “has no higher status than that of graduate by purchase, and were this designation written on the funeral streamer, it will not be imposing, and, in point of fact, the retinue will likewise be small.” He therefore was exceedingly unhappy, in his own mind, when, as luck would have it, on this day, which was the fourth day of the first seven, Tai Ch’uean, a eunuch of the Palace of High Renown, whose office was that of Palace Overseer, first prepared sacrificial presents, which he sent round by messengers, and next came himself in an official chair, preceded by criers beating the gong, to offer sacrificial oblations. Chia Chen promptly received him, and pressed him into a seat; and when they adjourned into the Hall of the Loitering Bees, tea was presented. Chia Chen had already arrived at a fixed purpose, so that he seized an opportunity to tell him of his wish to purchase an office for Chia Jung’s advancement. Tai Ch’uean understood the purport of his remark. “It is, I presume,” he added smilingly, “that the funeral rites should be a little more sumptuous.” “My worthy sir,” eagerly rejoined Chia Chen, “your surmise on that score is perfectly correct.” “The question,” explained Tai Ch’uean, “comes up at an opportune moment; for there is just at present a good vacancy. Of the three hundred officers who at present constitute the Imperial Body Guard, there are two wanting. Yesterday marquis Hsiang Yang’s third brother came to appeal to me with one thousand five hundred taels of ready money, which he brought over to my house. You know the friendship of old standing which exists between him and me, so that, placing other considerations aside, I without a second thought, assented for his father’s sake. But there still remains another vacancy, which, who would have thought it, fat general Feng, of Yung Hsing, asked to purchase for his son; but I have had no time to give him an answer. Besides, as our child wants to purchase it, you had better at once write a statement of his antecedents.” Chia Chen lost no time in bidding some one write the statement on red paper, which Tai Ch’uean found, on perusal, to record that Chia Jung was a graduate, by purchase, of the District of Chiang Ning, of the Ying T’ien Prefecture, in Chiang Nan; that Chia Tai-hua, his great grandfather, had been Commander-in-Chief of the Metropolitan Camp, and an hereditary general of the first class, with the prefix of Spiritual Majesty; that his grandfather Chia Ching was a metropolitan graduate of the tripos in the Ping Ch’en year; and that his father Chia Chen had inherited a rank of nobility of the third degree, and was a general, with the prefix of Majestic Intrepidity.","The family’s respect for tradition was, however, a source of great unease to Cousin Zhen when he reflected on jia rong’s status: for Jia Rong was only an Imperial College Student – an absurdly insignificant title to write on a funeral banner; and the insignia to which Qin-shi was entitled would make a very poor showing when borne in the funeral procession. By a stroke of luck the fourth day of the first seven-day period – the day on which official condolences were scheduled to begin – brought a visit from Dai Quan, the Eunuch Chamberlain of the Da-ming Palace. Having sent his representative along well in advance with offerings for the departed spirit, he presently arrived himself, seated in a great palanquin and preceded by criers and men with gongs clearing the streets before him, to present his offerings in person. Cousin Zhen at once made up his mind to take advantage of the visit. As soon as Dai Quan had made his offering, Cousin Zhen ushered him into the Honey Bee Gallery, invited him to be seated, and served him with tea. Then, entering into conversation with his guest, he quickly found occasion to mention the fact that he was thinking of purchasing a place for his son Jia Rong. The eunuch guessed what was in his mind, and laughingly inquired whether it was not with a view to adding a little pomp to the funeral that he had conceived this notion. ‘My dear Chamberlain,’ Cousin Zhen readily agreed, ‘you have hit the nail on the head!’ ‘Well, by a lucky coincidence,’ said Dai Quan, ‘there is rather a good place going at this very moment. The Corps of Officers of the Imperial Guard, which has an establishment of three hundred, has got two vacancies in it. Yesterday Lord Xiang-yang’s younger brother “Sannikins” begged me for one of them and sent fifteen hundred taels of silver round to my house to pay for it. He and I have always been good friends, as you know, and in any case I felt I had to do something, for his Grandpa’s sake; so I couldn’t very well refuse. “Piggy” Feng, the Military Governor of Yong-xing, has asked me if he can buy the remaining place for his son, but I haven’t yet had time to give him a reply. If our young friend here wants it, why not jot down his particulars and I’ll see what I can do.’ Cousin Zhen at once ordered someone to write out Jia Rong’s name, age and lineage on a sheet of red paper. The following description was hurriedly prepared and handed to Dai Quan for his inspection: Name: JIA RONG Place of Origin: (County) Kiangning; (Prefecture) Ying-tian-fu; (Province) Kiangnan. Status: Imperial College Student Age: 20 Great-grandfather: General Jia Dai-hua, C.-in-C. Metropolitan Barracks, hereditary noble of the first rank. Grandfather: Jia Jing, Palace Graduate of the year 17—. Father: Hon. Colonel Jia Zhen, third rank (hereditary)."
於是鳳姐兒方移步前來。將轉過了一重山坡，見兩三個婆子慌慌張張的走來，見了鳳姐兒，笑說道：「我們奶奶見二奶奶衹是不來，急的了不得，叫奴才們又來請奶奶來了。」鳳姐兒說道：「你們奶奶就是這麼急腳鬼似的。」鳳姐兒慢慢的走著，問：「戲唱了幾出了？」那婆子回道：「有八九出了。」,"So Sister Feng moved forward. After turning around a hillside, I saw two or three old women hurriedly approaching, and when I saw Sister Feng, she smiled and said, ""Our grandma just didn't come when she saw the second grandma, so she was in a hurry, and asked the servants to come and invite him again. Grandma is here."" Sister Feng said, ""Your grandmother is so anxious."" Sister Feng walked slowly and asked, ""How long have you been singing?"" The old woman replied, ""There are eight or nine. Out.""","Lady Feng, at this juncture moved onward, and after turning round a chain of hillocks, she caught sight of two or three matrons coming along with all speed. As soon as they espied lady Feng they put on a smile. “Our mistress,” they said, “perceiving that your ladyship was not forthcoming, has been in a great state of anxiety, and bade your servants come again to request you to come over. “Is your mistress,” observed lady Feng, “so like a quick-footed demon?” While lady Feng advanced leisurely, she inquired, “How many plays have been recited?” to which question one of the matrons replied, “They have gone through eight or nine.”","Xi-feng had resumed a normal pace and had just skirted the foot of a little hill, when she saw two or three old serving-women hurrying towards her in a state of great agitation. ‘Oh, Mrs Lian,’ said one of the old women with a smile, when they caught sight of her, ‘our mistress has been getting into such a state because you didn’t come! She’s sent us to fetch you.’ ‘Just like your mistress!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Always in a lather about something or other!’ and she sauntered on quite unconcernedly, talking to the old woman as she went. ‘How many pieces have they done so far?’ ‘Eight or nine,’ the old woman replied."
賈珍斷不肯坐，因勉強陪笑道：「侄兒進來有一件事要求二位嬸子並大妹妹。」邢夫人等忙問：「什麼事？」賈珍忙笑道：「嬸子自然知道，如今孫子媳婦沒了，侄兒媳婦偏又病倒，我看裏頭著實不成個體統。怎麼屈尊大妹妹一個月，在這裏料理料理，我就放心了。」邢夫人笑道：「原來為這個。你大妹妹現在你二嬸子家，只和你二嬸子說就是了。」王夫人忙道：「他一個小孩子家，何曾經過這樣事，倘或料理不清，反叫人笑話，倒是再煩別人好。」賈珍笑道：「嬸子的意思侄兒猜著了，是怕大妹妹勞苦了。若說料理不開，我包管必料理的開，便是錯一點兒，別人看著還是不錯的。從小兒大妹妹頑笑著就有殺伐決斷，如今出了閣，又在那府裏辦事，越發厲練老成了。我想了這幾日，除了大妹妹再無人了。嬸子不看侄兒、侄兒媳婦的分上，只看死了的分上罷！」說著滾下淚來。,"Jia Zhen refused to sit, because she reluctantly smiled and said, ""My nephew came in and asked the two aunts and the eldest sister."" Mrs. Xing and the others quickly asked, ""What's the matter?"" Jia Zhen hurriedly smiled and said, ""My aunt naturally knows. , Now that my grandson and daughter-in-law are gone, and my nephew and daughter-in-law have fallen ill again, I don’t think she’s a proper person. How can I condescend to my eldest sister for a month and cook here, I’m relieved.” Mrs. Xing smiled and said, “It’s because of this. ""Your eldest sister is now at your second aunt's house, so just talk to your second aunt."" Madam Wang hurriedly said, ""He is a child's family, how could such a thing ever happen to him? Others are good."" Jia Zhen smiled and said, ""My aunt and nephew have guessed what I mean, because I am afraid that the eldest sister will be working hard. If you say that the cooking can't be done, I guarantee that the cooking will be done, but it is a little wrong, and others look good. Yes. The eldest sister has made a decision to kill since she was a child. Now that she has left the cabinet and is doing business in the house, she has become more and more mature. I have been thinking about these days, there is no one but the eldest sister. The aunt does not look at the nephew Sons, nephews and daughters-in-law, only those who are dead!"" She rolled into tears as she spoke.","Chia Chen would not take a seat; but making an effort to return a smile, “Your nephew,” he urged, “has come over, as there’s a favour that I want to ask of my two aunts as well as of my eldest cousin.” “What is it?” promptly inquired madame Hsing and the rest. “My aunts,” Chia Chen replied with all haste, “you surely are aware that your grandson’s wife is now no more; your nephew’s wife is also laid up unwell, and, as I see that things in the inner apartments are really not what they should properly be, I would trouble my worthy eldest cousin to undertake in here the direction of affairs for a month; and if she does, my mind will be set at ease.” Madame Hsing smiled. “Is it really about this that you’ve come?” she asked; “your eldest cousin is at present staying with your aunt Secunda, and all you have to do is to speak to her and it will be all right.” “How ever could a mere child like her,” speedily remonstrated madame Wang, “carry out all these matters? and shouldn’t she manage things properly, she will, on the contrary, make people laugh, so it would therefore be better that you should trouble some one else.” “What your ideas are, aunt,” rejoined Chia Chen smiling, “your nephew has guessed; you’re afraid lest my eldest cousin should have to bear fatigue and annoyance; for as to what you say, that she cannot manage things, why my eldest cousin has, from her youth up, ever been in her romping and playing so firm and decided; and now that she has entered the married estate, and has the run of affairs in that mansion, she must have reaped so much the more experience, and have become quite an old hand! I’ve been thinking these last few days that outside my eldest cousin, there’s no one else who could come to my help; and, aunt , if you don’t do it for the face of your nephew and your nephew’s wife, do it, at least, for the affection you bore to her who is no more.” While he uttered these words tears trickled down his face.","But Cousin Zhen refused to be seated. ‘I have come to ask you three ladies a favour,’ he said, forcing his woebegone features into a smile. ‘What is it you want?’ Lady Xing asked him. ‘As you doubtless know,’ said Cousin Zhen, ‘my wife has been ill in bed ever since our daughter-in-law’s death, and with no one to run her side of the household it has been getting into a pretty deplorable state. I should like to ask Cousin Feng if she could possibly see her way to running things here for us during the coming month. It would be a great relief to me if she could.’ ‘So that’s what you want!’ said Lady Xing with a smile. ‘ Feng is now part of your Aunt Wang’s establishment. You’d better talk to her about it.’ ‘She’s only a child yet; you know,’ Lady Wang put in hastily.’ What experience has she ever had of this kind of thing ? Suppose she proved not quite up to the task. We should all be made to look ridiculous. I think you had better trouble someone else.’ ‘I can easily guess what is in your mind, Aunt,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘You are afraid we should overwork her. For I assure you there is no question of her not being a good enough manager. Even in her childhood games, Cousin Feng had the decisiveness of a little general, and since she’s married and had some experience of running things next door, she is a thoroughly seasoned campaigner. I’ve thought the matter over carefully these past few days and am quite convinced that apart from Cousin Feng there really isn’t anyone else I can ask. If you won’t let her do this for my sake or my wife’s sake, at least won’t you let her for the sake of the one who has just died?’ And at this point he burst into tears."
說話之間，已來到了天香樓的後門，見寶玉和一群丫頭們在那裏玩呢。鳳姐兒說道：「寶兄弟，別忒淘氣了。」有一個丫頭說道：「太太們都在樓上坐著呢，請奶奶就從這邊上去罷。」,"While talking, he came to the back door of Tianxiang Tower, and saw Baoyu and a group of girls playing there. Sister Feng said, ""Brother Bao, don't be so naughty."" One of the girls said, ""The ladies are all sitting upstairs, please go up from here.""","But while engaged in conversation, they had already reached the back door of the Tower of Celestial Fragrance, where she caught sight of Pao-yue playing with a company of waiting-maids and pages. “Brother Pao,” lady Feng exclaimed, “don’t be up to too much mischief !” “The ladies are all sitting upstairs,” interposed one of the maids. “Please, my lady, this is the way up.”","By this time they had arrived at the rear entrance of the two-storey Celestial Fragrance Pavilion, where they found Bao-yu playing with a group of maids. ‘Mind you don’t make a nuisance of yourself, Bao,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Lady Xing and Lady Wang are sitting upstairs watching,’ said one of the maids. ‘You can get up there from this side, madam.’"
鳳姐喫畢飯，就有寧國府中的一個媳婦來領牌，為支取香燈事。鳳姐笑道：「我算著你們今兒該來支取，總不見來，想是忘了。這會子到底來取，要忘了，自然是你們包出來，都便宜了我。」那媳婦笑道：「何嘗不是忘了，方纔想起來，再遲一步，也領不成了。」說罷，領牌而去。,"After Sister Feng had finished her meal, a daughter-in-law from Ningguo Mansion came to receive the license to collect the incense lanterns. Sister Feng said with a smile: ""I figured that you should come to pay today, but you never came. I think you forgot. Now you will come to pick it up. If you forget it, of course you paid for it, and it's cheaper for me."" The daughter-in-law said with a smile ""Why don't you forget, I just remembered, and if you are one step later, you won't be able to get it."" After that, he took the card and left.","Lady Feng had just finished her meal, when a married woman from the Ning mansion came to get an order to obtain an advance of money to purchase incense and lanterns with. “I calculated,” observed lady Feng, “that you would come to-day to make requisition, but I was under the impression that you had forgotten; had you really done so you would certainly have had to get them on your own account, and I would have been the one to benefit.” “Didn’t I forget? I did,” rejoined the married woman as she smiled; “and it’s only a few minutes back that it came to my mind ; had I been","Just then a woman came in asking for a tally with which to obtain a fresh supply of oil for the altar lamps. ‘I calculated that you would be needing some by now,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I thought you must have forgotten. If you had forgotten, you’d have had to pay for it yourself. That would have suited me down to the ground!’ ‘Oh no, madam! As you say, I just forgot. I only thought of it a moment ago, and I realized that if I didn’t hurry I should be too late to get a tally.’ So saying, she took her tally and went."
一語未了，只聽鳳姐聲音進來。賈璉聽見鬆了手，平兒剛起身，鳳姐已走進來，命平兒快開匣子，替太太找樣子。平兒忙答應了找時，鳳姐見了賈璉，忽然想起來，便問平兒：「拿出去的東西都收進來了麼？」平兒道：「收進來了。」鳳姐道：「可少什麼沒有？」平兒道：「我也怕丟下一兩件，細細的查了查，也不少。」鳳姐道：「不少就好，衹是別多出來罷？」平兒笑道：「不丟萬幸，誰還添出來呢？」鳳姐冷笑道：「這半個月難保乾淨，或者有相厚的丟下的東西，戒指、汗巾、香袋兒，再至於頭髮、指甲，都是東西。」一席話，說的賈璉臉都黃了。賈璉在鳳姐身後，只望著平兒殺雞抹脖使眼色兒。平兒只裝著看不見，因笑道：「怎麼我的心就和奶奶的心一樣！我就怕有這些個，留神搜了一搜，竟一點破綻也沒有，奶奶不信時，那些東西我還沒收呢，奶奶親自翻尋一遍去。」鳳姐笑道：「傻丫頭，他便有這些東西，那裏就叫咱們翻著了！」說著，尋了樣子又上去了。,"Before she said a word, she heard Sister Feng's voice come in. Jia Lian heard the release, and Pinger just got up when Sister Feng walked in and ordered Pinger to open the box quickly and look for his wife. When Pinger hurriedly agreed to look for it, when Sister Feng saw Jia Lian, she suddenly remembered and asked Pinger, ""Have you put all the things you took out?"" What's missing?"" Ping'er said, ""I'm also afraid of throwing away one or two pieces. I checked carefully, and there are quite a few."" Sister Feng said, ""A lot is fine, just don't come out with more?"" Ping'er She smiled and said, ""I'm lucky if you don't lose it, who will add it?"" Sister Feng sneered, ""It's hard to keep it clean in half a month, or there may be some thick things left behind, such as rings, sweat towels, sachets, and as for hair, Nails are all things."" After speaking, Jia Lian's face turned yellow. Jia Lian was behind Sister Feng, only looking at Ping'er killing chickens and wiping their necks and winking. Ping'er just pretended not to be able to see, because she smiled and said, ""Why is my heart the same as grandma's! I was afraid that there were these, but I searched carefully, but there was no flaw at all. When grandma didn't believe it, I would I haven't taken it yet, so grandma will look it up in person."" Sister Feng smiled and said, ""Silly girl, he already has these things, so let's look through it there!"" After speaking, she looked up and went up.","But hardly was this remark finished, when they heard the voice of lady Feng penetrate into the room. As soon as it reached the ear of Chia Lien, he was at a loss whether it was better to let her go or to snatch it away, and kept on shouting, “ My dear girl! don’t let her know.” P’ing Erh at once rose to her feet; but lady Feng had already entered the room; and she went on to bid P’ing Erh be quick and open a box and find a pattern for madame Wang. P’ing Erh expressed her obedience with alacrity; but while in search of it, lady Feng caught sight of Chia Lien; and suddenly remembering something, she hastened to ask P’ing Erh about it. “The other day,” she observed, “some things were taken out, and have you brought them all in or not?” “I have!” P’ing Erh assented. “Is there anything short or not?” lady Feng inquired. “I’ve carefully looked at them,” P’ing Erh added, “and haven’t found even one single thing short.” “Is there anything in excess?” lady Feng went on to ascertain. P’ing Erh laughed. “It’s enough,” she rejoined, “that there’s nothing short; and how could there really turn out to be anything over and above?” “That this half month,” lady Feng continued still smiling, “things have gone on immaculately it would be hard to vouch; for some intimate friend there may have been, who possibly has left something behind, in the shape of a ring, handkerchief or other such object, there’s no saying for certain!” While these words were being spoken, Chia Lien’s face turned perfectly sallow, and, as he stood behind lady Feng, he was intent upon gazing at P’ing Erh, making signs to her (that he was going) to cut her throat as a chicken is killed, (threatening her not to utter a sound) and entreating her to screen him; but P’ing Erh pretended not to notice him, and consequently observed smiling: “How is it that my ideas should coincide with those of yours, my lady; and as I suspected that there may have been something of the kind, I carefully searched all over, but I didn’t find even so much as the slightest thing wrong; and if you don’t believe me, my lady, you can search for your own self.” “You fool!” lady Feng laughed, “had he any things of the sort, would he be likely to let you and I discover them!” With these words still on her lips, she took the patterns and went her way; whereupon","‘Was there anything there that shouldn’t have been?’ Patience laughed. ‘Isn’t it enough that there was nothing missing? Why should there be anything extra?’ Xi-feng laughed, too. ‘He was nearly a fortnight outside. I wouldn’t bank on his having kept himself clean all that time. There might have been something left behind by one of his little friends: a ring or a sash or something.’ Jia Lian turned pale with fright. He grimaced piteously at Patience from behind Xi-feng’s back, and drawing a finger across his throat, silently entreated her to keep her discovery hidden. Patience affected not to notice him. ‘It’s funny you should say that, Mrs Lian. Exactly the same thought occurred to me; but though I went through his things very carefully, I didn’t find anything suspicious. If you don’t believe me, you can have a look yourself.’ ‘Silly girl!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Do you imagine that if there were really anything there he would let us look?’ And taking the pattern from her she went out again."
此開卷第一回也。,This is also the first time it's opened.,This is the opening section; this the first chapter.,
唸畢，又摩弄一回，說了些瘋話，遞與賈政道：「此物已靈，不可褻瀆，懸於臥室上檻，將他二人安在一室之內，除親身妻母外，不可使陰人沖犯。三十三日之後，包管身安病退，復舊如初。」說著回頭便走了。賈政趕著還說話，讓二人坐了喫茶，要送謝禮，他二人早已出去了。賈母等還只管著人去趕，那裏有個蹤影。少不得依言將他二人就安放在王夫人臥室之內，將玉懸在門上。王夫人親身守著，不許別個人進來。,"After reciting, he rubbed it again, said some crazy things, and handed it to Jia Zheng: ""This thing is spiritual and cannot be desecrated. It is hung on the upper threshold of the bedroom, and the two of them are placed in the same room, except for his wife and mother. Don't let the Yin people attack. After thirty-three days, you can guarantee that you will recover from illness and return to the old days."" After speaking, he turned his head and left. Jia Zheng was in a hurry to talk, let the two sit down for tea, and wanted to give a thank you gift, and the two of them had already gone out. Mother Jia and the others were just chasing people, and there was a trace there. It was necessary to place the two of them in Madam Wang's bedroom and hang the jade on the door. Mrs. Wang was guarding it herself, and no one was allowed to come in.","At the conclusion of this recital, he again rubbed the stone for a while, and gave vent to some nonsensical utterances, after which he surrendered it to Chia Cheng. “This object,” he said, “has already resumed its efficacy; but you shouldn’t do anything to desecrate it. Hang it on the post of the door in his bed-room, and with the exception of his own relatives, you must not let any outside female pollute it. After the expiry of thirty-three days, he will, I can guarantee, be all right.” Chia Cheng then gave orders to present tea; but the two priests had already walked away. He had, however, no alternative but to comply with their injunctions, and lady Feng and Pao-yue, in point of fact, got better from day to day.","When the monk had finished apostrophizing the stone, he rubbed it and polished it between his hands and muttered some strange-sounding words over it. ‘There! Its power has now been restored.’ He handed it back to Jia Zheng. ‘But you must be careful that it does not become contaminated again. Hang it above the threshold of the bedroom and let no women apart from the patient’s own mother and grandmother go inside. If you will do that, I can guarantee a complete recovery in thirty-three days.’ Jia Zheng would have liked to detain the monk for tea and offer him some remuneration, but he and the Taoist slipped quietly away and could not be traced. The monk’s directions were scrupulously followed. Lady Wang guarded the doorway in person and prevented any unauthorized person from getting into the bedroom."
襲人之母也早迎了出來。襲人拉了寶玉進去。寶玉見房中三五個女孩兒，見他進來，都低了頭，羞慚慚的。花自芳母子兩個百般怕寶玉冷，又讓他上炕，又忙另擺菓桌，又忙倒好茶。襲人笑道：「你們不用白忙，我自然知道。菓子也不用擺，也不敢亂給東西喫。」一面說，一面將自己的坐褥拿了鋪在一個炕上，寶玉坐了；用自己的腳爐墊了腳；向荷包內取出兩個梅花香餅兒來，又將自己的手爐掀開焚上，仍蓋好，放與寶玉懷內；然後將自己的茶杯斟了茶，送與寶玉。彼時他母兄已是忙另齊齊整整擺上一桌子菓品來。襲人見總無可喫之物，因笑道：「既來了，沒有空去之理，好歹嘗一點兒，也是來我家一趟。」說著，便拈了幾個松子穰，吹去細皮，用手帕托著送與寶玉。,"The mother of raiders also came out early. The raider pulled Baoyu inside. Baoyu saw the three or five girls in the room, and when he saw him come in, he bowed his head, ashamed. Hua Zifang's mother and son were afraid of Baoyu's cold in every possible way, so they put him on the kang, busy setting up another fruit table, and busy pouring tea. Xiren smiled and said, ""You don't have to be busy, I naturally know that. You don't need to put out the fruit, and you don't dare to give something to eat."" He used his own foot stove to pad his feet; he took out two plum blossom cakes from his purse, opened his hand stove and burned it, still covered it, and put it in Baoyu's arms; then he poured tea into his own teacup, Give it to Baoyu. At that time, his mother and brother were already busy putting together a table of fruits. Seeing that there is always nothing to eat, he smiled and said, ""Since you are here, there is no reason to go there. Anyway, if you try a little, you will come to my house."" After speaking, he picked up a few pine nuts and blew them away. Fine leather, hold it with a handkerchief and give it to Baoyu.","Hsi Jen’s mother also came out at an early period to receive him, and Hsi Jen pulled Pao-yue in. Once inside the room, Pao-yue perceived three or five girls, who, as soon as they caught sight of him approaching, all lowered their heads, and felt so bashful that their faces were suffused with blushes. But as both Hua Tzu-fang and his mother were afraid that Pao-yue would catch cold, they pressed him to take a seat on the stove-bed, and hastened to serve a fresh supply of refreshments, and to at once bring him a cup of good tea. “You needn’t be flurrying all for nothing,” Hsi Jen smilingly interposed; “I, naturally, should know; and there’s no use of even laying out any fruits, as I daren’t recklessly give him anything to eat.” Saying this, she simultaneously took her own cushion and laid it on a stool, and after Pao-yue took a seat on it, she placed the footstove she had been using, under his feet; and producing, from a satchet, two peach-blossom-scented small cakes, she opened her own hand-stove and threw them into the fire; which done, she covered it well again and placed it in Pao-yue’s lap. And eventually, she filled her own tea-cup with tea and presented it to Pao-yue, while, during this time, her mother and sister had been fussing about, laying out in fine array a tableful of every kind of eatables. Hsi Jen noticed that there were absolutely no things that he could eat, but she felt urged to say with a smile: “Since you’ve come, it isn’t right that you should go empty away; and you must, whether the things be good or bad, taste a little, so that it may look like a visit to my house!” As she said this, she forthwith took several seeds of the fir-cone, and cracking off the thin skin, she placed them in a handkerchief and presented them to Pao-yue.","By this time Aroma’s mother had joined them outside to welcome the visitors. Aroma took Bao-yu by the hand and led him in. He saw four or five girls sitting down inside who hung their heads and blushed when he entered. Despite their blushes, Hua Zi-fang and his mother insisted that Bao-yu should get up on the kang with them, as they were afraid that he would find their house cold. Having installed him on the kang, they bustled to and fro fetching things to eat and pouring tea. ‘Now don’t you two rush about, Mother,’ said Aroma. ‘I know how to look after him. There’s no point in your giving him a lot of things he won’t be able to eat.’ As she said this she took her own cushion that she had been sitting on, put it on top of a little short-legged kang table, and made Bao-yu sit on it with his feet on her metal foot-warmer. Then she took a couple of rose-shaped perfume lozenges from a little purse she was wearing, opened up her hand-warmer, popped the lozenges onto the burning charcoal, and closing it up again, stuffed it into the front of his gown. Having at last got him settled comfortably and to her own satisfaction, she served him with tea which she poured out for him into her own cup. Hua Zi-fang and his mother had by now finished laying an elaborate tea. The cakes, nuts and dried fruits were arranged on their plates, and the plates themselves on the table, with painstaking attention to symmetry and design. Aroma could tell at a glance that there was nothing there which Bao-yu could possibly be expected to eat. But her family must not be offended. ‘Since you’ve decided to come,’ she said to Bao-yu with a smile, ‘we can’t let you go without having tasted something of ours. You’ll have to try something, just to be able to say that you have been our guest!’ She took a handful of pine nuts from one of the dishes on the table, and blowing away the skins, handed them to him on her handkerchief."
正說著，只見一群人簇著鳳姐出來了。賈蕓深知鳳姐是喜奉承尚排場的，忙把手逼著，恭恭敬敬搶上來請安。鳳姐連正眼也不看，仍往前走著，只問他母親好，「怎麼不來我們這裏逛逛？」賈蕓道：「衹是身上不大好，倒時常記掛著嬸子，要來瞧瞧，又不能來。」鳳姐笑道：「可是你會撒謊，不是我提起他來，你就不說他想我了。」賈蕓笑道：「侄兒不怕雷打了，就敢在長輩前撒謊。昨兒晚上還提起嬸子來，說嬸子身子生的單弱，事情又多，虧嬸子好大精神，竟料理的周周全全；要是差一點兒的，早累的不知怎麼樣呢。」,"Just as he was talking, a group of people came out with Sister Feng. Jia Yun knew very well that Sister Feng liked to flatter and ostentatious, so she hurriedly forced her hand, and respectfully grabbed her and greeted her. Sister Feng didn't even look in the eyes, she still walked forward, and only asked his mother, ""Why don't you come to visit us?"" Jia Yun said, ""It's just that she's not in good health, and she often misses her aunt, so I want to come and see. , and can't come."" Sister Feng smiled and said, ""But you will lie. If I didn't mention him, you wouldn't say he missed me."" Jia Yun smiled and said, ""My nephew is not afraid of thunder, so he dares to stand in front of his elders. Lie. Last night, I even mentioned my aunt, saying that my aunt was weak and had a lot of things to do. Thanks to my aunt's great energy, she managed to cook thoroughly;","But while she yet spoke, they perceived a whole bevy of people, pressing round lady Feng, as she egressed from the apartment. Chia Yuen was perfectly aware that lady Feng took pleasure in flattery, and delighted in display, so that hastily dropping his arms, he with all reverence, thrust himself forward and paid his respects to her. But lady Feng did not even so much as turn to look at him with straight eyes; but continued, as hitherto , her way onwards, simply confining herself to ascertaining whether his mother was all right, and adding: “How is it that she doesn’t come to our house for a stroll?” “The thing is,” Chia Yuen replied, “that she’s not well: she, however, often thinks fondly of you, aunt, and longs to see you; but as for coming round, she’s quite unable to do so.” “You have, indeed, the knack of telling lies!” lady Feng laughed with irony; “for hadn’t I alluded to her, she would never have thought of me!” “Isn’t your nephew afraid,” Chia Yuen protested smilingly, “of being blasted by lightning to have the audacity of telling lies in the presence of an elder! Even so late as yesterday evening, she alluded to you, aunt! ‘ Though naturally,’ she said, ‘of a weak constitution, you had, however, plenty to attend to! that it’s thanks to your supremely eminent energies, aunt, that you’re, after all, able to manage everything in such a perfect manner; and that had you ever made the slightest slip, there would have long ago crept up , goodness knows, what troubles!’“","As she spoke, the subject of his inquiry emerged from the gateway, surrounded by a bevy of attendants. Jia Yun was well aware that she had a weakness for flattery and the showier forms of deference. Bringing his hands together in an exaggerated salute and stepping briskly forward, he made her a tremendous bow and wished her in good health. Xi-feng continued to walk on and, without actually looking at him or turning her head, inquired after his mother’s health and asked why she never came to visit. ‘She’s not been very well, Auntie. She’s always thinking about you and meaning to pay a call, but when it’s come to it, she just hasn’t been able to get out.’ ‘You’re a wonderful liar!’ said Xi-feng with a laugh. ‘I don’t suppose she’s ever thought about me until this moment!’ ‘I’m too much afraid of lightning to lie to my superiors,’ said Jia Yun. ‘Mother was talking about you only last night, as a matter of fact. She said, “Your Auntie Lian is only a single weak woman, yet she has all those responsibilities. It’s a good thing she has the will-power to keep everything running so smoothly, because if that should go, she’d be worn out in no time.’”"
秦氏笑道：「今兒巧，上回寶叔叔立刻要見見我那兄弟，他今兒也在這裏，想在書房裏呢，寶叔叔何不去瞧一瞧？」寶玉聽了，即便下炕要走。尤氏鳳姐都忙說：「好生著，忙什麼？」一面便吩咐好生小心跟著，別委曲他，倒比不得跟了老太太過來就罷了。鳳姐說道：「既這麼著，何不請進這秦小爺來，我也瞧一瞧，難道我見不得他不成？」尤氏笑道：「罷，罷！可以不必見他，比不得咱們家的孩子們，胡打海摔的慣了。人家的孩子都是斯斯文文的慣了，乍見了你這破落戶，還被人笑話死了呢。」鳳姐笑道：「普天下的人，我不笑話就罷了，竟叫這小孩子笑話不成？」賈蓉笑道：「不是這話，他生的腼腆，沒見過大陣仗兒，嬸子見了，沒的生氣。」鳳姐道：「他是哪吒，我也要見一見！別放你娘的屁了。再不帶去，給你一頓好嘴巴子。」賈蓉笑嘻嘻的說：「我不敢強，就帶他來。」,"Qin Shi smiled and said, ""It's a coincidence, last time Uncle Bao wanted to see my brother right away. He is here today, and he wants to be in the study. Why don't Uncle Bao go and have a look?"" Kang to go. Sister You Shifeng hurriedly said, ""Haosheng, what are you busy with?"" At the same time, she instructed Haosheng to follow carefully, don't make trouble with him, it's better than following the old lady. Sister Feng said: ""Since it's like this, why don't you invite this young master Qin, and I'll take a look. Can't I see him?"" You said with a smile: ""Well, stop! You don't have to see him, it's not as good as our family. My children, they are used to being slapped by Hu Dahai. The children of other people are used to being gentle and gentle. When they first saw you, they were laughed at and died.” Sister Feng smiled and said, “People in the world, I don’t want to laugh at it, why can’t I tell this kid to laugh?” Jia Rong laughed, “It’s not like that, he’s shy, he’s never seen a big battle, and when his aunt sees it, he’s not angry.” Sister Feng said: ""He's Nezha, I want to see him too! Don't let your mother's fart. If you don't bring it, I'll give you a good mouth."" Jia Rong said with a smile, ""I don't dare to be strong, so I'll bring him here. ""","“A strange coincidence has taken place to-day,” urged Mrs. Ch’in, with a smile; “some time back you, uncle Pao, expressed a wish to see my brother, and to-day he too happens to be here at home. I think he’s in the library; but why not go and see for yourself, uncle Pao?” Pao-yue descended at once from the stove-couch, and was about to go, when Mrs. Yu bade the servants to mind and go with him. “Don’t you let him get into trouble,” she enjoined. “It’s a far different thing when he comes over under the charge of his grandmother, when he’s all right.” “If that be so,” remarked lady Feng, “why not ask the young gentleman to come in, and then I too can see him. There isn’t, I hope, any objection to my seeing him?” “Never mind! never mind!” observed Mrs. Yu, smilingly; “it’s as well that you shouldn’t see him. This brother of mine is not, like the boys of our Chia family, accustomed to roughly banging and knocking about. Other people’s children are brought up politely and properly, and not in this vixenish style of yours. Why, you’d ridicule him to death!” “I won’t laugh at him then, that’s all,” smiled lady Feng; “tell them to bring him in at once.” “He’s shy,” proceeded Mrs. Ch’in, “and has seen nothing much of the world, so that you are sure to be put out when you see him, sister.” “What an idea!” exclaimed lady Feng. “Were he even No Cha himself , I’d like to see him; so don’t talk trash; if, after all, you don’t bring him round at once, I’ll give you a good slap on the mouth.” “I daren’t be obstinate,” answered Mrs. Ch’in smiling; “I’ll bring him round!”","‘You’ve chosen a good day to come, Uncle Bao,’ said little Qin-shi. ‘Last time you were here you wanted to see my brother. Well, today he’s here. He’s sitting in the study at this very moment. Why don’t you go in and see him?’ Bao-yu was for rushing off straight away. You-shi hurriedly ordered some servants to go after him in discreet attendance. ‘Well now, just a minute!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Why not ask him in here so that I can see him too ?’ ‘Oh dear, I don’t think that would do at all!’ said You-shi. ‘Some people’s children aren’t used to rackety ways like ours. Some people’s children are quiet and refined. If they were to meet a termagant like you, they might die of laughing.’ ‘He’ll be lucky if I don’t laugh at him,’ said Xi-feng cheerfully. ‘ He’d better not try laughing at me! ‘He’s very, very shy, Auntie,’ said Jia Rong. ‘We are afraid that if you saw him it might only irritate you.’ ‘Fiddlestick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I don’t care if he’s a three-faced wonder with eight arms, I still want to see him. Stop farting about and bring him in, or I’ll box your ears!’ Jia Rong cringed in mock alarm. ‘Yes, Auntie! No need to get so fierce! We’ll bring him in straight away.’"
林黛玉自覺忘情，不覺紅了臉，拿袖子遮了臉，翻身向裏裝睡著了。寶玉纔走上來要搬他的身子，只見黛玉的奶娘並兩個婆子卻跟了進來說：「妹妹睡覺呢，等醒了再請來。」剛說著，黛玉便翻身坐了起來，笑道：「誰睡覺呢。」那兩三個婆子見黛玉起來，便笑道：「我們只當姑娘睡著了。」說著，便叫紫鵑說：「姑娘醒了，進來伺候。」一面說，一面都去了。,"Lin Daiyu consciously forgot her feelings, her face blushed unconsciously, she covered her face with her sleeves, turned over and pretended to fall asleep. Baoyu just came up to move him, but Daiyu's nurse and two wives came in and said, ""My little sister is sleeping, please come back when you wake up."" As soon as she said that, Daiyu rolled over and sat up. , smiled and said, ""Who sleeps."" When the two or three women saw Daiyu getting up, they laughed and said, ""We just pretend that the girl is asleep."" After saying this, they called Zijuan and said, ""The girl is awake, come in. Serving."" One side said, and the other side went.","The consciousness that she had not been reticent about her feelings made Tai-yue unwittingly flush scarlet. Taking hold of her sleeve, she screened her face; and, turning her body round towards the inside, she pretended to be fast asleep. Pao-yue drew near her. He was about to pull her round when he saw Tai-yue’s nurse enter the apartment, followed by two matrons. “Is Miss asleep?” they said. “If so, we’ll ask her over, when she wakes up.” As these words were being spoken, Tai-yue eagerly twisted herself round and sat up. “Who’s asleep?” she laughed. “We thought you were fast asleep, Miss,” smiled the two or three matrons as soon as they perceived Tai-yue get up. This greeting over, they called Tzu Chuean. “Your young mistress,” they said, “has awoke; come in and wait on her!” While calling her, they quitted the room in a body. Tai-yue remained seated on the bed.","Dai-yu realized that she had been caught off her guard. She covered her burning face with her sleeve, and turning over towards the wall, pretended to be asleep. Bao-yu went over intending to turn her back again, but just at that moment Dai-yu’s old wet-nurse came hurrying in with two other old women at her heels: ‘Miss Lin’s asleep, sir. Would you mind coming back again after she’s woken up?’ Dai-yu at once turned over and sat up with a laugh: ‘Who’s asleep?’ The three old women laughed apologetically. ‘Sorry, miss. We thought you were asleep. Nightingale! Come inside now!"
第十回,tenth time,CHAPTER X.,Chapter 10
賈母又與李宮裁併眾姊妹說笑了一會，也覺有些睏倦起來。聽了聽已是漏下四鼓，命將食物撤去，賞散與眾人，隨起身道：「我們安歇罷。明日還是節下，該當早起。明日晚間再玩罷。」且聽下回分解。,"Mother Jia talked and laughed with Li Gongcai and the other sisters for a while, and felt a little sleepy. After listening to it, I had missed four drums. I ordered the food to be removed and scattered with everyone. I got up and said, ""Let's rest in peace. Tomorrow is still a festival, so we should get up early. Let's play tomorrow night.""","But old lady Chia went on for some time to bandy words with Li Kung-ts’ai, with the whole company of young ladies and the rest, so that she, in fact, felt considerably tired and worn out; and when she heard that the fourth watch had already drawn nigh, she consequently issued directions that the eatables should be cleared away and given to the crowd of servants, and suggested, as she readily rose to her feet, “Let us go and rest! for the next day is also a feast, and we must get up at an early hour; and to-morrow evening we can enjoy ourselves again!” whereupon the whole company dispersed. But now, reader, listen to the sequel given in the chapter which follows.","Xi-feng tried to ward him off, and the result was that the two of them became locked in a sort of playful wrestling-match. Grandmother Jia continued for a while to laugh and joke with Li Wan and the girls, but soon began to feel tired and sleepy. The night-drum was sounding, and when they stopped to listen they found it was already the beginning of the fourth watch. She ordered the food to be cleared away, telling the servants that they might have what was left over for themselves. ‘Time for bed, children!’ she said, rising to her feet. ‘We can do this again tomorrow, if you like; but now we must have some sleep.’ With that the party gradually broke up and they all dispersed to their rooms. What happened thereafter will be told in the following chapter."
士隱聽了，大叫：「妙哉！吾每謂兄必非久居人下者，今所吟之句，飛騰之兆已見，不日可接履於雲霓之上矣。可賀，可賀！」乃親斟一鬥為賀。雨村因幹過，嘆道：「非晚生酒後狂言，若論時尚之學，晚生也或可去充數沽名。衹是目今行囊路費一概無措，神京路遠，非賴賣字譔文即能到者。」士隱不待說完，便道：「兄何不早言。愚每有此心，但每遇兄時，兄並未談及，愚故未敢唐突。今既及此，愚雖不才，『義利』二字卻還識得。且喜明歲正當大比，兄宜作速入都，春闈一戰，方不負兄之所學也。其盤費餘事，弟自代為處置，亦不枉兄之謬識矣！」當下即命小童進去，速封五十兩白銀，並兩套冬衣。又云：「十九日乃黃道之期，兄可即買舟西上，待雄飛高舉，明冬再晤，豈非大快之事耶！」雨村收了銀衣，不過略謝一語，並不介意，仍是喫酒談笑。那天已交了三更，二人方散。,"When Shi Yin heard it, he shouted, ""Wonderful! Every time I say that my brother must not be someone who has lived under people for a long time, the words I am chanting today have seen the sign of soaring, and I will be able to ride on the cloud in the near future. Congratulations, Congrats!"" He personally poured a bucket of congratulations. Amamura sighed because he had done it before: ""It's not the late-born rant after drinking. If you talk about fashion, the late-born may also be able to make a name for yourself. It's just that I don't know what to do now, and the Shenjing road is far away. The text will arrive soon.” Shiyin didn’t wait to finish, then said, “Brother, why didn’t you say it earlier. You always have this heart, but every time you meet your brother, your brother doesn’t talk about it, so you don’t dare to be abrupt. Although idiot is not talented, he still knows the word ""righteousness and benefit"". I also like that the next year is a big competition, and my brother should be able to enter the capital quickly. In the spring battle, I will live up to my brother's learning. Doing it on your behalf will not be in vain for your brother's mistake!"" Immediately, he ordered the little boy to enter, and quickly sealed fifty taels of silver and two sets of winter clothes. He also said: ""The nineteenth day is the period of the zodiac. Brother, you can buy a boat and go to the west. Waiting for Xiongfei to hold it high, and meet again tomorrow winter, wouldn't it be a great event!"" Don't mind, still drinking and laughing. The third watch has been handed in that day, and the two of them have dispersed.","Her pure rays fill the court, the jadelike rails enrobe! Lo! in the heavens her disk to view doth now arise, And in the earth below to gaze men lift their eyes. “Excellent!” cried Shih-yin with a loud voice, after he had heard these lines; “I have repeatedly maintained that it was impossible for you to remain long inferior to any, and now the verses you have recited are a prognostic of your rapid advancement. Already it is evident that, before long, you will extend your footsteps far above the clouds! I must congratulate you! I must congratulate you! Let me, with my own hands, pour a glass of wine to pay you my compliments.” Yue-ts’un drained the cup. “What I am about to say,” he explained as he suddenly heaved a sigh, “is not the maudlin talk of a man under the effects of wine. As far as the subjects at present set in the examinations go, I could, perchance, also have well been able to enter the list, and to send in my name as a candidate; but I have, just now, no means whatever to make provision for luggage and for travelling expenses. The distance too to Shen Ching is a long one, and I could not depend upon the sale of papers or the composition of essays to find the means of getting there.” Shih-yin gave him no time to conclude. “Why did you not speak about this sooner?” he interposed with haste. “I have long entertained this suspicion; but as, whenever I met you, this conversation was never broached, I did not presume to make myself officious. But if such be the state of affairs just now, I lack, I admit, literary qualification, but on the two subjects of friendly spirit and pecuniary means, I have, nevertheless, some experience. Moreover, I rejoice that next year is just the season for the triennial examinations, and you should start for the capital with all despatch; and in the tripos next spring, you will, by carrying the prize, be able to do justice to the proficiency you can boast of. As regards the travelling expenses and the other items, the provision of everything necessary for you by my own self will again not render nugatory your mean acquaintance with me.” Forthwith, he directed a servant lad to go and pack up at once fifty taels of pure silver and two suits of winter clothes. “The nineteenth,” he continued, “is a propitious day, and you should lose no time in hiring a boat and starting on your journey westwards. And when, by your eminent talents, you shall have soared high to a lofty position, and we meet again next winter, will not the occasion be extremely felicitous?” Yue-ts’un accepted the money and clothes with but scanty expression of gratitude. In fact, he paid no thought whatever to the gifts, but went on, again drinking his wine, as he chattered and laughed. It was only when the third watch of that day had already struck that the two friends parted company; and Shih-yin, after seeing Yue-ts’un off, retired to his room and slept, with one sleep all through, never waking until the sun was well up in the skies.","‘Bravo!’ said Shi-yin loudly. ‘I have always insisted that you were a young fellow who would go up in the world, and now, in these verses you have just recited, I see an augury of your ascent. In no time at all we shall see you up among the clouds! This calls for a drink!’ And, saying this, he poured Yu-cun a large cup of wine. Yu-cun drained the cup, then, surprisingly, sighed: ‘Don’t imagine the drink is making me boastful, but I really do believe that if it were just a question of having the sort of qualifications now in demand, I should stand as good a chance as any of getting myself on to the list of candidates. The trouble is that I simply have no means of laying my hands on the money that would be needed for lodgings and travel expenses. The journey to the capital is a long one, and the sort of money I can earn from my copying is not enough—’ ‘Why ever didn’t you say this before?’ said Shi-yin interrupting him. ‘I have long wanted to do something about this, but on all the occasions I have met you previously, the conversation has never got round to this subject, and I haven’t liked to broach it for fear of offending you. Well, now we know where we are. I am not a very clever man, but at least I know the right thing to do when I see it. Luckily, the next Triennial is only a few months ahead. You must go to the capital without delay. A spring examination triumph will make you feel that all your studying has been worth while. I shall take care of all your expenses. It is the least return I can make for your friendship.’ And there and then he instructed his boy to go with all speed and make up a parcel of fifty taels of the best refined silver and two suits of winter clothes. ‘The almanac gives the nineteenth as a good day for travelling,’ he went on, addressing Yu-cun again. ‘You can set about hiring a boat for the journey straight away. How delightful it will be to meet again next winter when you have distinguished yourself by soaring to the top over all the other candidates!’ Yu-cun accepted the silver and the clothes with only the most perfunctory word of thanks and without, apparently, giving them a further moment’s thought, for he continued to drink and laugh and talk as if nothing had happened. It was well after midnight before they broke up."
完畢，見湘雲已梳完了頭，便走過來笑道：「好妹妹，替我梳上頭罷。」湘雲道：「這可不能了。」寶玉笑道：「好妹妹，你先時怎麼替我梳了呢？」湘雲道：「如今我忘了，怎麼梳呢？」寶玉道：「橫豎我不出門，又不帶冠子勒子，不過打幾根散辮子就完了。」說著，又千妹妹萬妹妹的央告。湘雲只得扶他的頭過來，一一梳篦。在家不戴冠，並不總角，只將四圍短髮編成小辮，往頂心發上歸了總，編一根大辮，紅條結住。自發頂至辮梢，一路四顆珍珠，下面有金墜腳。湘雲一面編著，一面說道：「這珠子只三顆了，這一顆不是一色的。我記得都是一樣的，怎麼少了一顆？」寶玉道：「丟了一顆。」湘雲道：「必定是外頭去弄丟了，被人揀了去，倒便宜他。」,"After finishing, seeing that Xiangyun had finished combing his hair, he walked over and said with a smile, ""Good sister, just comb my hair for me."" Xiangyun said, ""It's impossible."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Good sister, please go ahead. How did you comb it for me?"" Xiangyun said, ""I forgot now, how do I comb it?"" Baoyu said, ""I don't go out horizontally and vertically, and I don't wear a crown and braid, but a few loose braids are done."" Having said that, another thousand sisters and Wan sisters' appeal. Xiang Yun had no choice but to help his head over and comb the grates one by one. At home, I don't wear a crown, and I don't have a total angle. I only braid the short hair around it into small braids, and put it together on the top of the center, braid a big braid, and tie it with red strips. From the top to the end of the braid, there are four pearls all the way, and there are gold pendant feet below. While compiling the book, Xiangyun said, ""There are only three beads, and this one is not of the same color. I remember them all the same, why is one missing?"" Baoyu said, ""I lost one."" Xiangyun said. : ""It must have been lost outside and picked up by someone, so it's cheaper for him.""","When he had done, he perceived that Hsiang-yuen had already finished combing her hair, and speedily coming up to her, he put on a smile, and said: “My dear cousin, comb my hair for me!” “This can’t be done!” Hsiang-yuen objected. “My dear cousin,” Pao-yue continued smirkingly, “how is it that you combed it for me in former times?” “I’ve forgotten now how to comb it!” Hsiang-yuen replied. “I’m not, after all, going out of doors,” Pao-yue observed, “nor will I wear a hat or frontlet, so that all that need be done is to plait a few queues, that’s all!” Saying this, he went on to appeal to her in a thousand and one endearing terms, so that Hsiang-yuen had no alternative, but to draw his head nearer to her and to comb one queue after another, and as when he stayed at home he wore no hat, nor had, in fact, any tufted horns, she merely took the short surrounding hair from all four sides, and twisting it into small tufts, she collected it together over the hair on the crown of the head, and plaited a large queue, binding it fast with red ribbon; while from the root of the hair to the end of the queue, were four pearls in a row, below which, in the way of a tip, was suspended a golden pendant. “Of these pearls there are only three,” Hsiang-yuen remarked as she went on plaiting; “this isn’t one like them; I remember these were all of one kind, and how is it that there’s one short?” “I’ve lost one,” Pao-yue rejoined. “It must have dropped,” Hsiang-yuen added, “when you went out of doors, and been picked up by some one when you were off your guard; and he’s now, instead of you, the richer for it.”","That part of his toilet completed, he observed that Xiang-yun had just finished doing her hair and wandered over to where she was sitting. ‘Coz dear, do my hair for me, will you?’ ‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Xiang-yun. Bao-yu smiled coaxingly: ‘Go on, be a dear! You used to do it for me once.’ ‘Well, I can’t any longer,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘I’ve forgotten how to.’ ‘It doesn’t need very much doing to it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I’m not going out anywhere today. Just a few plaits.’ He continued to coax and wheedle until at last she gave in, and taking his head in her hands, sat him down in her place at the dressing-table and proceeded to comb and dress his hair. Bao-yu never wore any head-covering when he was at home. Instead he had his side-hair done up in a number of little plaits which were looped round over his ears and brought together by means of red silk thread into a single large queue at the back. It was fastened by a golden clasp at the end and by four pearl clips at regular intervals between the clasp and the crown of his head. As Xiang-yun plaited, she noticed that a pearl appeared to be missing. ‘What’s happened to this clip?’ she said. ‘I’m sure it used to be the same as the other three. Where has its pearl gone?’ ‘I lost it,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I expect it fell off somewhere outside and somebody picked it up,’ said Xiang-yun. ‘ Lucky old somebody!’"
鳳姐見昭兒回來，因當著人未及細問賈璉，心中自是記掛，待要回去，爭奈事情繁雜，一時去了，恐有延遲失誤，惹人笑話。少不得耐到晚上回來，復令昭兒進來，細問一路平安信息。連夜打點大毛衣服，和平兒親自檢點包裹，再細細追想所需何物，一並包藏交付昭兒。又細細吩咐昭兒：「在外好生小心伏侍，不要惹你二爺生氣：時時勸他少喫酒，別勾引他認得混帳老婆，——回來打折你的腿」等語。趕亂完了，天已四更將盡，睡下，又走了困，不覺天明雞唱，忙梳洗過寧府中來。,"When Sister Feng saw Zhao’er coming back, because she didn’t have time to ask Jia Lian in detail in front of others, she was naturally worried. When she was going back, she was arguing for the complicated affairs, so she went there for a while, fearing that there would be delays and mistakes, which would make people laugh. I couldn't wait to come back at night, and ordered Zhao'er to come in and inquire about the safety of the journey. After ordering the hairy clothes overnight, Hepinger checked the package in person, and then carefully thought about what she needed, and packed it up and delivered it to Zhaoer. He also instructed Zhao Er carefully: ""Be careful when you are outside, and don't make your second master angry: always advise him to drink less, don't seduce him to recognize his goddamn wife, come back and discount your legs"" and so on. After the chaos was over, it was almost the end of the day. After falling asleep, I was sleepy again. I didn't realize that the chicken was singing, and I rushed to wash the Ning Mansion.","Lady Feng saw Chao Erh on his return, but as she could not very well, in the presence of third persons, make minute inquiries after Chia Lien, she had to continue a prey to inward solicitude till it was time to go home, for, not having got through what she had to do, she was compelled to wait patiently until she went back in the evening, when she again sent word for Chao Erh to come in, and asked him with all minuteness whether the journey had been pleasant throughout, and for full particulars. That very night, she got in readiness the long pelisses, which she herself, with the assistance of P’ing Erh, packed up in a bundle; and after careful thought as to what things he would require, she put them in the same bundle and committed them to Chao Erh’s care. She went on to solicitously impress upon Chao Erh to be careful in his attendance abroad. “Don’t provoke your master to wrath,” she said, “and from time to time do advise him not to drink too much wine; and don’t entice him to make the acquaintance of any low people; for if you do, when you come back I will cut your leg off.” The preparations were hurriedly and confusedly completed; and it was already the fourth watch of the night when she went to sleep. But soon again the day dawned, and after hastily performing her toilette and ablutions, she came over to the Ning Mansion.","Now that Shiner was back, Xi-feng was all agog to question him about Jia Lian but could not do so in any detail in front of the others. She would have liked to follow him back home, but her duties were by no means over, and she was obliged to hold out until evening. Then, back in her own apartment, she summoned him to her and asked him for full particulars of the journey. She looked out all Jia Lian’s furs, and she and Patience sat up into the night getting them ready and packing them -together with anything else which careful thought suggested might be needed – for Shiner to take back with him to his Master. Xi-feng gave Shiner minute instructions concerning his conduct towards the latter: ‘Mind you look after your master properly away from home, now. Try not to make him angry. And do always be on at him not to drink too much. And don’t encourage him to get mixed up with bad women. If, when you get back, I find out that you have done, I’ll break your legs!’ Shiner laughingly agreed to abide by all her instructions. By the time they got to bed it was well past one in the morning. To Xi-feng it seemed as though she had barely lain down to sleep when it was dawn once more and time to get up again and wash and dress for another round of duties at Ning-guo House."
小丫頭忙捧過那一件斗笠來，寶玉便把頭略低一低，命他戴上。那丫頭便將着大紅猩氈斗笠一抖，纔往寶玉頭上一合，寶玉便說：「罷，罷！好蠢東西，你也輕些兒！難道沒見過別人戴過的？讓我自己戴罷。」黛玉站在炕沿上道：「羅唆什麼，過來，我瞧瞧罷。」寶玉忙就近前來。黛玉用手整理，輕輕籠住束髮冠，將笠沿拽在抹額之上，將那一顆核桃大的絳絨簪纓扶起，顫巍巍露於笠外。整理已畢，端相了端相，說道：「好了，披上斗篷罷。」寶玉聽了，方要了斗篷披上。薛姨媽忙道：「跟你們的媽媽還都沒來呢，且略等等不好麼？」寶玉道：「我們倒去等他們，有丫頭們跟著也夠了。」薛姨媽不放心，到底命兩個婦女跟隨他兄妹方罷。他二人道了擾，一徑回至賈母房中。,"The little girl was busy holding the hat, and Baoyu lowered her head slightly and ordered him to put it on. The girl shook the big red felt hat before closing it on Baoyu's head, and Baoyu said, ""Stop, stop! You are so stupid, you should be lighter! Haven't you seen anyone else wear one? Let me be myself. Wear it."" Daiyu stood on the edge of the kang and said, ""What is Luo Zuo, come here, I'll take a look."" Baoyu hurriedly approached. Daiyu tidyed up with her hands, gently wrapped the crown of her hair, dragged the edge of the brisket over her forehead, and lifted the walnut-sized velvet hairpin, which trembled to the outside of the bristle. After finishing the tidying up, looking at each other, he said, ""Okay, just put on the cloak."" Baoyu listened, and asked for the cloak to put on. Aunt Xue hurriedly said, ""I haven't come with your mother yet, so why don't you wait a bit?"" Baoyu said, ""Let's go back and wait for them. It's enough to have the girls to follow."" Aunt Xue was worried. Order two women to follow his brother and sister Fang. The two of them disturbed each other and went back to Jia's mother's room.","As she spoke the two of them bade good-bye, and the waiting-maids at once presented a hood to each of them. Pao-yue readily lowered his head slightly and told a waiting-maid to put it on. The girl promptly took the hood, made of deep red cloth, and shaking it out of its folds, she put it on Pao-yue’s head. “That will do,” hastily exclaimed Pao-yue. “You stupid thing! gently a bit; is it likely you’ve never seen any one put one on before? let me do it myself.” “Come over here, and I’ll put it on for you,” suggested Tai-yue, as she stood on the edge of the couch. Pao-yue eagerly approached her, and Tai-yue carefully kept the cap, to which his hair was bound, fast down, and taking the hood she rested its edge on the circlet round his forehead. She then raised the ball of crimson velvet, which was as large as a walnut, and put it in such a way that, as it waved tremulously, it should appear outside the hood. These arrangements completed she cast a look for a while at what she had done. “That’s right now,” she added, “throw your wrapper over you!” When Pao-yue caught these words, he eventually took the wrapper and threw it over his shoulders. “None of your nurses,” hurriedly interposed aunt Hsueeh, “are yet come, so you had better wait a while.” “Why should we wait for them?” observed Pao-yue. “We have the waiting-maids to escort us, and surely they should be enough.” Mrs. Hsueeh finding it difficult to set her mind at ease deputed two married women to accompany the two cousins; and after they had both expressed (to these women) their regret at having troubled them, they came straightway to dowager lady Chia’s suite of apartments.","A maid came forward with Bao-yu’s rain-hat and he lowered his head slightly for her to put it on. Holding the brim of the great saucer-shaped red felt top, she jerked it up and prepared to bring it down, aiming the inside part at his crown. ‘Stop!’ he cried impatiently.’ You have got to go easy with a great clumsy thing like that! Haven’t you ever seen anyone putting one of these things on before? You had better let me do it myself.’ ‘Come here!’ said Dai-yu standing on the edge of the kang. ‘I’ll put it on for you!’ Bao-yu went and stood in front of her. Putting her two hands round the inner cap, Dai-yu eased it gently down until its rim fitted over his golden headband, so that the walnut-sized red woollen pompom of the headband was left quivering outside the cap on its flexible golden stem. ‘There!’ she said, after a few further adjustments.’ Now you can put on your cape.’ Bao-yu took the cape from his maid and fastened it himself. ‘The nurses who came with you are still not back,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Perhaps you had better wait a bit.’ ‘We wait for them?’ said Bao-yu. ‘We have got the maids. We shall be all right.’ But Aunt Xue was not satisfied, and ordered two of her own women to see the cousins home. As soon as they were back they thanked the women for their trouble and went straight in to see Grandmother Jia, who had not yet had her supper."
說話時賈璉已進來，鳳姐便命擺上酒饌來，夫妻對坐。鳳姐雖善飲，卻不敢任興，只陪侍著賈璉。一時賈璉的乳母趙嬤嬤走來，賈璉鳳姐忙讓喫酒，令其上炕去。趙嬤嬤執意不肯。平兒等早於炕沿下設下一機，又有一小腳踏，趙嬤嬤在腳踏上坐了。賈璉向桌上揀兩盤餚饌與他放在機上自喫。鳳姐又道：「媽媽很嚼不動那個，倒沒的矼了他的牙。」因向平兒道：「早起我說那一碗火腿燉肘子很爛，正好給媽媽喫，你怎麼不拿了去趕著叫他們熱來？」又道：「媽媽，你嘗一嘗你兒子帶來的惠泉酒。」趙嬤嬤道：「我喝呢，奶奶也喝一盅，怕什麼？只不要過多了就是了。我這會子跑了來，倒也不為飲酒，倒有一件正經事，奶奶好歹記在心裏，疼顧我些罷。我們這爺，衹是嘴裏說的好，到了跟前就忘了我們。幸虧我從小兒奶了你這麼大。我也老了，有的是那兩個兒子，你就另眼照看他們些，別人也不敢呲牙兒的。我還再四的求了你幾遍，你答應的倒好，到如今還是燥屎。這如今又從天上跑出這一件大喜事來，那裏用不著人？所以倒是來和奶奶來說是正經，靠著我們爺，只怕我還餓死了呢。」,"Jia Lian had already come in when he was speaking, and Sister Feng ordered wine and food to come, and the husband and wife would sit opposite each other. Although Sister Feng is good at drinking, she does not dare to be Xing, and only serves Jia Lian. Jia Lian's wet nurse Zhao Nanny came over, and Jia Lianfeng hurriedly asked her to have a drink and put her on the kang. Zhao mama insisted not to. Ping'er set up a machine earlier than the edge of the kang, and there was a small footrest on which Mrs. Zhao sat. Jia Lian picked two plates of food from the table and put them on the plane to eat for himself. Sister Feng said again, ""Mom couldn't chew that, so it broke his teeth."" Yin Xiang Ping'er said, ""I got up early and said that the bowl of stewed elbows with ham was very bad. It was just for my mother to eat, so why didn't you take it? Hurry up to get them hot?"" Then he said, ""Mom, try the Huiquan wine that your son brought."" Mommy Zhao said, ""I drink it, and grandma also drinks a cup, what are you afraid of? Just don't overdo it. That's it. I'm running here now, and it's not for drinking, but there is a serious matter. Grandma keeps it in her heart and takes care of me. Our lord, it's just what we say in our mouth. Forget about us. Fortunately, I have nursed you so much since I was a child. I am also old. Some of them are those two sons. You should take care of them, and others will not dare to bark. I begged you four times. Several times, what you promised was good, but it's still dry shit. Now this big happy event has come out of the sky again, there's no need for people there? I'm afraid I'll starve to death.""","As she uttered this remark, Chia Lien walked in, and lady Feng issued orders to serve the wine and the eatables, and husband and wife took their seats opposite to each other; but notwithstanding that lady Feng was very partial to drink, she nevertheless did not have the courage to indulge her weakness, but merely partook of some to keep him company. Chia Lien’s nurse, dame Chao, entered the room, and Chia Lien and lady Feng promptly pressed her to have a glass of wine, and bade her sit on the stove-couch, but dame Chao was obstinate in her refusal. P’ing Erh and the other waiting-maids had at an early hour placed a square stool next to the edge of the couch , where was likewise a small footstool, and on this footstool dame Chao took a seat, whereupon Chia Lien chose two dishes of delicacies from the table, which he handed her to place on the square stool for her own use. “Dame Chao,” lady Feng remarked, “couldn’t very well bite through that, for mind it might make her teeth drop! This morning,” she therefore asked of P’ing Erh, “I suggested that that shoulder of pork stewed with ham was so tender as to be quite the thing to be given to dame Chao to eat; and how is it you haven’t taken it over to her? But go at once and tell them to warm it and bring it in! Dame Chao,” she went on, “just you taste this Hui Ch’uean wine brought by your foster-son.” “I’ll drink it,” replied dame Chao, “but you, my lady, must also have a cup: what’s there to fear? the one thing to guard against is any excess, that’s all! But I’ve now come over, not for any wine or eatables; on the contrary, there’s a serious matter, which I would ask your ladyship to impress on your mind, and to show me some regard, for this master of ours is only good to utter fine words, but when the time (to act) does come, he forgets all about us! As I have had the good fortune to nurse him in his infancy and to bring him up to this age, ‘I too have grown old in years,’ I said to him, ‘and all that belong to me are those two sons, and do look upon them with some particular favour!’ With any one else I shouldn’t have ventured to open my mouth, but him I anyway entreated time and again on several occasions. His assent was of course well and good, but up to this very moment he still withholds his help. Now besides from the heavens has dropped such a mighty piece of good luck; and in what place will there be no need of servants? that’s why I come to tell you, my lady, as is but right, for were I to depend upon our master , I fear I shall even die of starvation.”","At this point Jia Lian came in again and Xi-feng ordered her maids to serve the wine and various choice dishes to go with it. Husband and wife sat cross-legged at opposite sides of the low table on the kang and began their drinking – Xi-feng with some restraint, although she was normally a fairly hard drinker, in view of the occasion. They had not been drinking long when Jia Lian’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Zhao, walked in. The young couple at once invited her to drink with them and tried to make her join them on the kang. This last honour she would under no circumstances accept, and Patience and the girls laid a little table for her at the side of the kang and set a little stool beside it, on which she sat down very contentedly. Jia Lian made a selection with his chopsticks from the dishes on the table, and after heaping up two platefuls, set them down on Nannie Zhao’s own little table for her to eat there by herself. Xi-feng was critical: ‘Nannie can’t chew stuff like that. She’ll break her teeth on it!’ She turned to Patience. ‘ That piece of boiled gammon in the bowl I said this morning was so tender: that would be just the thing for Nannie. Why don’t you run round to the kitchen and ask them to heat it up for her? – Nannie,’ she said, addressing the old woman, ‘you must try some of the rice wine your Lian brought back with him from the South!’ ‘Ooh yes!’ said Nannie Zhao,’ I must try some of thatl And you must have some too, Mrs Lian. Never fear 1 As long as you don’t drink too much, ‘twill do you good. But I didn’t come all the way here for vittles and drink, bless you. I came on more serious business. And you heed my words, Mrs Lian, and stick up for me; because that Master Lian of yours he always says he’ll do something, but when you go to see him later, he’s clean forgot all about it! To think I reared you up on the milk of my own bosom, Master Lian! And a fine young man you’ve growed into, thanks be! Well, I’m old and of no account now. But there are these two sons of mine, d’ye see ? If only you would be more like a foster-brother to them and look after them a bit, no one would dare say a word agen them. But dearie me! I’ve asked you again and again to help them, and you always says yes; yet to this very day nothing has ever come of it. Well, what I thought was this, Mrs Lian. With this great blessing of Heaven that’s come on the family on account of your eldest young lady, surely, I thought to myself, there must be jobs in this for someone? I’ll talk to Mrs Lian about it, I said to myself; because if I rely on Master Lian to help us, we’ll starve to death for certain sure!’"
第四回,the fourth time,CHAPTER IV.,Chapter 4
賈瑞收了鏡子，想道：「這道士倒有意思，我何不照一照試試。」想畢，拿起「風月寶鑒」來，向反面一照，只見一個骷髏立在裏面，唬得賈瑞連忙掩了，罵：「道士混帳，如何嚇我！——我倒再照照正面是什麼。」想著，又將正面一照，只見鳳姐站在裏面招手叫他。賈瑞心中一喜，蕩悠悠的覺得進了鏡子，與鳳姐雲雨一番，鳳姐仍送他出來。到了床上，噯喲了一聲，一睜眼，鏡子從手裏掉過來，仍是反面立著一個骷髏。賈瑞自覺汗津津的底下已遺了一灘精。心中到底不足，又翻過正面來，只見鳳姐還招手叫他，他又進去。如此三四次。到了這次，剛要出鏡子來，只見兩個人走來，拿鐵鎖把他套住，拉了就走。賈瑞叫道：「讓我拿了鏡子再走。」——只說了這句，就再不能說話了。,"Jia Rui put away the mirror and thought, ""This Taoist priest is interesting, why don't I try it."" After thinking about it, he picked up the ""Fengyue Baojian"" and looked at the opposite side, only to see a skeleton standing inside, bluffing Jia Rui hurriedly covered it up and scolded, ""Fuck, how dare you scare me! - I'll take a picture of what's on the front."" Thinking about it, he took another picture of the front, only to see Sister Feng standing inside beckoning to him. Jia Rui's heart was overjoyed, and he felt that he had entered the mirror and had a chat with Sister Feng, but Sister Feng still sent him out. When he got to the bed, he let out a hoot, and when he opened his eyes, the mirror fell from his hand, and there was still a skeleton standing on the opposite side. Jia Rui felt that he had left a pool of sperm under his sweat. In the end, there was not enough in his heart, and he turned to the front again, only to see that Sister Feng was still beckoning him, and he went in again. So three or four times. This time, just as he was about to come out of the mirror, he saw two people walking towards him, grabbed him with a latte lock, pulled him and left. Jia Rui shouted: ""Let me take the mirror and go."" - Only after saying this, he can no longer speak.","Chia Jui received the mirror. “This Taoist,” he thought, “would seem to speak sensibly, and why should I not look at it and try its effect?” At the conclusion of these thoughts, he took up the Mirror of Voluptuousness, and cast his eyes on the obverse side; but upon perceiving nought else than a skeleton standing in it, Chia Jui sustained such a fright that he lost no time in covering it with his hands and in abusing the Taoist. “You good-for-nothing!” he exclaimed, “why should you frighten me so? but I’ll go further and look at the front and see what it’s like.” While he reflected in this manner, he readily looked into the face of the mirror, wherein he caught sight of lady Feng standing, nodding her head and beckoning to him. With one gush of joy, Chia Jui felt himself, in a vague and mysterious manner, transported into the mirror, where he held an affectionate tete-a-tete with lady Feng. Lady Feng escorted him out again. On his return to bed, he gave vent to an exclamation of “Ai yah!” and opening his eyes, he turned the glass over once more; but still, as hitherto, stood the skeleton in the back part. Chia Jui had, it is true, experienced all the pleasant sensations of a tete-a-tete, but his heart nevertheless did not feel gratified; so that he again turned the front round, and gazed at lady Feng, as she still waved her hand and beckoned to him to go. Once more entering the mirror, he went on in the same way for three or four times, until this occasion, when just as he was about to issue from the mirror, he espied two persons come up to him, who made him fast with chains round the neck, and hauled him away. Chia Jui shouted. “Let me take the mirror and I’ll come along.” But only this remark could he utter, for it was forthwith beyond his power to say one word more.","‘This is intriguing!’ Jia Rui thought to himself when the Taoist gave him the mirror. ‘ Let me try looking into it as he says,’ and holding it up to his face he looked into the back as instructed and saw a grinning skull, which he covered up hastily with a curse: ‘Silly old fool, to scare me like that! – But let me see what happens when I look into the other side!’ He turned the mirror round and looked, and there inside was Xi-feng beckoning to him to enter, and his ravished soul floated into the mirror after her. There they performed the act of love together, after which she saw him out again. But when he found himself once more back in his bed he stared and cried out in horror: for the mirror, of its own accord, had turned itself round in his hand and the same grinning skull faced him that he had seen before. He could feel the sweat trickling all over his body and lower down in the bed a little pool of semen that he had just ejaculated. Yet still he was not satisfied, and turned the face of the mirror once more towards him. Xi-feng was there beckoning to him again and calling, and again he went in after her. He did this three or four times. But the last time, just as he was going to return from the mirror, two figures approached him holding iron chains which they fastened round him and by which they proceeded to drag him away. He cried out as they dragged him: ‘Wait! Let me take the mirror with me…!’ Those were the last words he ever uttered."
看至此，意趣洋洋，趁著酒興，不禁提筆續曰：,"Seeing this, I was full of interest, and taking advantage of the wine, I couldn't help but mention the script:","By destroying and eliminating the hooks and lines, by discarding the compasses and squares, and by amputating Kung Chui’s fingers, the human race will ultimately succeed in constraining his ingenuity,”--his high spirits, on perusal of this passage, were so exultant that taking advantage of the exuberance caused by the wine, he picked up his pen, for he could not repress himself, and continued the text in this wise: “By burning the flower, (Hua-Hsi Jen) and dispersing the musk, (She Yueeh), the consequence will be that the inmates of the inner chambers will, eventually, keep advice to themselves.","The words wonderfully suited his present mood. He read no further. Impulsively picking up a writing-brush, and with the inspiration lent him by his tipsiness, he added the following lines in the margin:"
這日，那甄家大丫鬟在門前買線，忽聽街上喝道之聲，眾人都說新太爺到任。丫鬟於是隱在門內看時，只見軍牢快手，一對一對的過去，俄而大轎抬著一個烏帽猩袍的官府過去。丫鬟倒發了個怔，自思這官好面善，倒象在那裏見過的。於是進入房中，也就丟過不在心上。至晚間，正待歇息之時，忽聽一片聲打的門響，許多人亂嚷，說：「本府太爺差人來傳人問話。」封肅聽了，唬得目瞪口呆，不知有何禍事。,"On this day, the eldest maid of the Zhen family was buying wires in front of the door, and suddenly heard the shouts on the street, and everyone said that the new master had arrived. The maid then hid in the door to look, and saw that the army prison was fast-handed, passing pair by pair, and the Russian sedan chair carried a black hat and gorilla robe official. The maid froze for a moment, thinking to herself that this official was good-natured, as if she had seen him there. So when I entered the room, I lost my mind. In the evening, when he was about to rest, he heard a loud knock on the door, and many people shouted, saying, ""My grandfather has sent someone to ask someone to ask questions."" Feng Su was stunned when he heard this. He didn't know what was going on. .","On a certain day, the elder servant girl of the Chen family was at the door purchasing thread, and while there, she of a sudden heard in the street shouts of runners clearing the way, and every one explain that the new magistrate had come to take up his office. The girl, as she peeped out from inside the door, perceived the lictors and policemen go by two by two; and when unexpectedly in a state chair, was carried past an official, in black hat and red coat, she was indeed quite taken aback. “The face of this officer would seem familiar,” she argued within herself; “just as if I had seen him somewhere or other ere this.” Shortly she entered the house, and banishing at once the occurrence from her mind, she did not give it a second thought. At night, however, while she was waiting to go to bed, she suddenly heard a sound like a rap at the door. A band of men boisterously cried out: “We are messengers, deputed by the worthy magistrate of this district, and come to summon one of you to an enquiry.” Feng Su, upon hearing these words, fell into such a terrible consternation that his eyes stared wide and his mouth gaped. What calamity was impending is not as yet ascertained, but, reader, listen to the explanation contained in the next chapter.","One day the elder of the two maids was purchasing some silks at the door when she heard the criers clearing the street and all the people began to tell each other that the new mandarin had arrived. She hid in the doorway and watched the guards and runners marching past two by two. But when the mandarin in his black hat and scarlet robe of office was borne past in his great chair, she stared for some time as though puzzled. ‘Where have I seen that mandarin before?’ she wondered. ‘His face looks extraordinarily familiar.’ But presently she went into the house again and gave the matter no further thought. That night, just as they were getting ready for bed, there was suddenly a great commotion at the door and a confused hubbub of voices shouting that someone was wanted at the yamen for questioning, which so terrified Feng Su that he was momentarily struck dumb and could only stare. If you wish to know what further calamity this portended, you will have to read the following chapter."
閑言少敘，卻說寶玉因近日林黛玉回去，剩得自己孤恓，也不和人玩耍，每到晚間便索然睡了。如今從夢中聽見說秦氏死了，連忙翻身爬起來，只覺心中似戳了一刀的，忍不住哇的一聲，直奔出一口血來。襲人等慌了忙上來攙扶，問是怎麼樣，又要回賈母來請大夫。寶玉笑道：「不用忙，不相干，這是急火攻心，血不歸經。」說著便爬起來，要衣服換了，來見賈母，即時要過去。襲人見他如此，心中雖放不下，又不敢攔，衹是由他罷了。賈母見他要去，因說：「才嚈氣的人，那裏不乾淨；二則夜裏風大，等明早再去不遲。」寶玉那裏肯依。賈母命人備車，多派跟隨人役，擁護前來。,"Gossip was less, but Baoyu said that because Lin Daiyu had recently returned, he was left alone and did not play with anyone, so he fell asleep every night. Now that I heard from my dream that Qin Shi was dead, I hurriedly turned over and got up, only to feel like a knife was stabbed in my heart, and I couldn't help but let out a mouthful of blood with a wow. Xiren waited in a hurry to come up to help, and asked how it was, and then went back to Jia's mother to ask for a doctor. Baoyu smiled and said, ""Don't be busy, it's irrelevant, it's a rush to attack the heart, and the blood will not return to the scriptures."" After speaking, she got up, asked to change her clothes, and came to see Jia's mother, and she had to go immediately. When Xiren saw him like this, although he couldn't let it go, he didn't dare to stop him, it was just him. When Mother Jia saw that he was going, she said, ""Those who are angry are not clean. Second, it's windy at night, so it's not too late to go tomorrow morning."" Baoyu was willing to obey. Jia's mother ordered people to prepare the car, and many sent to follow the people to support them.","But these irrelevant details need not be dilated upon; suffice it to confine ourselves to Pao-yue. Consequent upon Lin Tai-yue’s return home, he was left to his own self and felt very lonely. Neither would he go and disport himself with others; but with the daily return of dusk, he was wont to retire quietly to sleep. On this day, while he was yet under the influence of a dream, he heard the announcement of Mrs. Ch’in’s death, and turning himself round quickly he crept out of bed, when he felt as if his heart had been stabbed with a sword. With a sudden retch, he straightway expectorated a mouthful of blood, which so frightened Hsi Jen and the rest that they rushed forward and supported him. “What is the matter?” they inquired, and they meant also to go and let dowager lady Chia know, so as to send for a doctor, but Pao-yue dissuaded them. “There’s no need of any flurry; it’s nothing at all,” he said, “it’s simply that the fire of grief has attacked the heart, and that the blood did not circulate through the arteries.” As he spoke, he speedily raised himself up, and, after asking for his clothes and changing, he came over to see dowager lady Chia. His wish was to go at once to the other side; and Hsi Jen, though feeling uneasy at heart, seeing the state of mind he was in, did not again hinder him, as she felt constrained to let him please himself. When old lady Chia saw that he was bent upon going: “The breath is just gone out of the body,” she consequently remonstrated, “and that side is still sullied. In the second place it’s now dark, and the wind is high; so you had better wait until tomorrow morning, when you will be in ample time.” Pao-yue would not agree to this, and dowager lady Chia gave orders to get the carriage ready, and to depute a few more attendants and followers to go with him.","But we digress. During the last few days, since Dai-yu’s return to her father had deprived him of her companionship, Bao-yu, far from seeking diversion in the company of the others, had kept to himself, going to bed early every night and sleeping disconsolately on his own. The news of Qin-shi’s death came to him in the midst of his dreams, causing him to start up in bed with a jerk. A sudden stabbing pain shot through his heart. He retched involuntarily and spat out a mouthful of blood. Aroma and the maids clung to him, terrified, and asked him what was the matter. They wanted to tell Grandmother Jia and ask her to send for a doctor; but Bao-yu would not hear of it. ‘Don’t worry, it’s of no consequence!’ he told them. ‘Something that happens when a sudden rush of fire to the heart prevents the blood from getting back into the right channels.’ He climbed out of bed as he spoke and told them to bring him some clean clothes, so that he could see his grandmother and then go straight on to the other house. Aroma was still concerned for him, but seeing him so determined, allowed him to have his way. Grandmother Jia did not want him to go, either. ‘It won’t be clean there,’ she said, ‘with her scarcely yet cold. And besides, there’s a nasty wind at this time of night. It will be soon enough if you go there first thing tomorrow.’ But Bao-yu would not be gainsaid, so she gave instructions for a carriage to be made ready for him and a numerous retinue of servants to attend him there."
至二十一日，就賈母內院中搭了家常小巧戲臺，定了一班新出小戲，昆弋兩腔皆有。就在賈母上房排了几席家宴酒席，並無一個外客，衹有薛姨媽、史湘雲、寶釵是客，餘者皆是自己人。這日早起，寶玉因不見林黛玉，便到他房中來尋，只見林黛玉歪在炕上。寶玉笑道：「起來喫飯去，就開戲了。你愛看那一出？我好點。」林黛玉冷笑道：「你既這樣說，你特叫一班戲來，揀我愛的唱給我看。這會子犯不上跐著入借光兒問我。」寶玉笑道：「這有什麼難的。明兒就這樣行，也叫他們借咱們的光兒。」一面說，一面拉起他來，攜手出去。,"On the 21st, a small home-made stage was set up in the inner courtyard of Jia's mother, and a new group of small operas was scheduled, and both Kun Yi voices were available. There were a few family banquets in the upper room of Jia's mother, and there was not a single foreign guest, only Aunt Xue, Shi Xiangyun, and Baochai were the guests, and the rest were all their own. When Baoyu got up early this morning, because she could not see Lin Daiyu, she went to his room to look for her, only to see Lin Daiyu crooked on the kang. Baoyu said with a smile, ""Get up to eat, and then the show will start. Which one do you like to watch? I'm better."" Lin Daiyu sneered, ""Since you said that, you called a special group to sing the one I love. I think. I can't afford to borrow Guang'er to ask me now."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""What's so difficult. I'll do it tomorrow, and ask them to borrow our light."" As he spoke, he pulled him up. , go out hand in hand.","When the 21st arrived, a stage of an ordinary kind, small but yet handy, was improvised in dowager lady Chia’s inner court, and a troupe of young actors, who had newly made their debut, was retained for the nonce, among whom were both those who could sing tunes, slow as well as fast. In the drawing rooms of the old lady were then laid out several tables for a family banquet and entertainment, at which there was not a single outside guest; and with the exception of Mrs. Hsueeh, Shih Hsiang-yuen, and Pao-ch’ai, who were visitors, the rest were all inmates of her household. On this day, Pao-yue failed, at any early hour, to see anything of Lin Tai-yue, and coming at once to her rooms in search of her, he discovered her reclining on the stove-couch. “Get up,” Pao-yue pressed her with a smile, “and come and have breakfast, for the plays will commence shortly; but whichever plays you would like to listen to, do tell me so that I may be able to choose them.” Tai-yue smiled sarcastically. “In that case,” she rejoined, “you had better specially engage a troupe and select those I like sung for my benefit; for on this occasion you can’t be so impertinent as to make use of their expense to ask me what I like!” “What’s there impossible about this?” Pao-yue answered smiling; “well, tomorrow I’ll readily do as you wish, and ask them too to make use of what is yours and mine.” As he passed this remark, he pulled her up, and taking her hand in his own, they walked out of the room and came and had breakfast.","At last the twenty-first arrived. A dear little stage had been erected in the courtyard outside Grandmother Jia’s apartment and a newly trained troupe of child actors able to perform both Kun-qu and the noisier Yi-qiang type of plays had been engaged. In the apartment’s main sitting-room a semicircle of little tables were arranged facing outwards towards the stage and laid in preparation for a feast. No outsiders were invited. The guests of honour were Aunt Xue, Shi Xiang-yun, “and Bao-chai herself. All the others invited were members of the family. Early that morning Bao-yu, not seeing Dai-yu around, went to look for her in her room and found her still reclining on the kang. ‘Get up and have something to eat!’ he said. ‘The players will be starting shortly. Tell me some play you like so that I shall know which one to choose!’ ‘If you’re so anxious to please me,’ said Dai-yu coldly, ‘you ought to hire a troupe specially and put on all my favourites. It’s a cheap sort of kindness to treat me at someone else’s expense!’ ‘Never mind!’ said Bao-yu. ‘When we hire a troupe for you, you’ll be able to return the compliment.’ He hauled her up from the kang, and the two of them went off hand in hand together."
夏夜即事　　倦繡佳人幽夢長，金籠鸚鵡喚茶湯。窗明麝月開宮鏡，室靄檀雲品御香。琥珀杯傾荷露滑，玻璃檻納柳風涼。水亭處處齊紈動，簾卷朱樓罷晚妝。,"A summer night is a matter of time. The tired embroidered beauty has a long dream, and the golden cage parrot calls for tea soup. The window is bright and the musk moon opens the palace mirror. The amber cup is slippery, and the glass sill is cool. The water pavilion is moving everywhere, and the curtain rolls up the Zhulou to stop the evening makeup.","This is the description of the aspect of nature on a summer night: The beauteous girl, weary of needlework, quiet is plunged in a long dream. The parrot in the golden cage doth shout that it is time the tea to brew. The lustrous windows with the musky moon like open palace-mirrors look; The room abounds with fumes of sandalwood and all kinds of imperial scents. From the cups made of amber is poured out the slippery dew from the lotus. The banisters of glass, the cool zephyr enjoy flapped by the willow trees. In the stream-spanning kiosk, the curtains everywhere all at one time do wave. In the vermilion tower the blinds the maidens roll, for they have made the night’s toilette.","II. Summer A tired maid sleeps at her embroidery. A parrot in its gilt cage calls for tea. Pale moonbeams on an opened mirror fall, And burning sandal makes a fragrant pall. From amber cups thirst-quenching nectar flows. A willow-breeze through crystal curtains blows. In pool-side kiosks light-clad maidens flit, Or, dressed for bed, by open casements sit."
且說寧府送殯，一路熱鬧非常。剛至城門前，又有賈赦、賈政、賈珍等諸同僚屬下各家祭棚接祭，一一的謝過，然後出城，竟奔鐵檻寺大路行來。彼時賈珍帶賈蓉來到諸長輩前，讓坐轎上馬，因而賈赦一輩的各自上了車轎，賈珍一輩的也將要上馬。鳳姐兒因記掛著寶玉，怕他在郊外縱性逞強，不服家人的話，賈政管不著這些小事，惟恐有個失慕，難見賈母，因此便命小廝來喚他。寶玉只得來到他車前。鳳姐笑道：「好兄弟，你是個尊貴人，女孩兒一樣的人品，別學他們猴在馬上。下來，咱們姐兒兩個坐車，豈不好？」寶玉聽說，忙下了馬，爬入鳳姐車上，二人說笑前來。,"Besides, the funeral procession in Ning Mansion was very lively. As soon as they arrived in front of the city gate, Jia She, Jia Zheng, Jia Zhen and other colleagues received sacrifices from their shacks. They thanked them one by one, and then went out of the city to the main road of Tiejian Temple. At that time, Jia Zhen brought Jia Rong to the front of the elders and asked the sedan chairs to get on the horse, so each of Jia She's generation got on the sedan, and Jia Zhen's generation was about to get on the horse. Because she remembered Baoyu, she was afraid that he would be stubborn in the suburbs and refused to obey his family. Jia Zheng couldn't control these trivial matters. Baoyu had to come to his car. Sister Feng said with a smile: ""My good brother, you are a noble person with the same character as a girl. Don't imitate them on horseback. Come down, let's take the two of our sisters in the car, wouldn't it be good?"" Climbing into Sister Feng's car, the two came to talk and laugh.","All along its course the road was plunged in unusual commotion. As soon as they reached the city gates Chia She, Chia Cheng, Chia Chen, and the others again received donations from all their fellow officers and subordinates, in sacrificial sheds erected by their respective families, and after they returned thanks to one after another, they eventually issued from the city walls, and proceeded eventually along the highway, in the direction of the Temple of the Iron Fence. Chia Chen, at this time, went, together with Chia Jung, up to all their seniors, and pressed them to get into their sedan chairs, and to ride their horses; and Chia She and all of the same age as himself were consequently induced to mount into their respective carriages or chairs. Chia Chen and those of the same generation were likewise about to ride their horses, when lady Feng, through her solicitude on Pao-yue’s account, gave way to fears lest now that they had reached the open country, he should do as he pleased, and not listen to the words of any of the household, and lest Chia Chen should not be able to keep him in check; and, as she dreaded that he might go astray, she felt compelled to bid a youth call him to her; and Pao-yue had no help but to appear before her curricle. “My dear brother,” lady Feng remarked smiling, “you are a respectable person, and like a girl in your ways, and shouldn’t imitate those monkeys on horseback! do get down and let both you and I sit together in this carriage; and won’t that be nice?” At these words, Pao-yue readily dismounted and climbed up into the carriage occupied by lady Feng; and they both talked and laughed, as they continued their way.","As soon as the hearse had gone over, the prince and his retinue crossed in the other direction, after which the rear part of the procession moved forward and caught up with the rest. The liveliness which attended the procession during the whole of its progress through the city reached a climax as it approached the city gate, for it was along this last stretch that the colleagues and office juniors of Jia She, Jia Zheng and Cousin Zhen had arranged their bowers, and it was necessary to stop and thank each one of them as they made their offerings to the passing hearse. They did at last succeed in getting out of the city gate, however, after which a clear road lay ahead all the way to the Temple of the Iron Threshold. Cousin Zhen went round with Jia Rong to the senior men among the mourners and invited them to proceed from there onwards by the transport provided. The upshot was that those of Jia She’s generation got into carriages and sedans, while Cousin Zhen and the younger men mounted on horseback. Xi-feng was worried about Bao-yu. Out in the country, she thought, he was liable to become wild and disobedient. She felt sure that he would get up to some kind of mischief now that he was removed from Jia Zheng’s restraint. Accordingly she sent one of her pages to summon him, and presently he rode up to her carriage. ‘Bao dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘a person of your refinement belongs here with us. You don’t want to go clomping around the countryside like apes on horseback with those horrid men! Why not get in with me? The two of us will keep each other company.’ Bao-yu at once dismounted and climbed up into the carriage, and the two of them drove on, laughing and chattering as they went."
第二回,Second time,CHAPTER II.,Chapter 2
原來襲人實未睡著，不過故意裝睡，引寶玉來慪他頑耍。先聞得說字問包子等事，也還可不必起來；後來摔了茶鐘，動了氣，遂連忙起來解釋勸阻。早有賈母遣人來問是怎麼了。襲人忙道：「我纔倒茶來，被雪滑倒了，失手砸了鐘子。」一面又安慰寶玉道：「你立意要攆他也好，我們也都願意出去，不如趁勢連我們一齊攆了，我們也好，你也不愁，再有好的來伏侍你。」寶玉聽了這話，方無了言語，被襲人等扶至炕上，脫換了衣服。不知寶玉口內還說些什麼，只覺口齒纏綿，眼眉愈加餳澀，忙伏侍他睡下。襲人伸手從他項上摘下那通靈玉來，用自己的手帕包好，塞在褥下，次日帶時便冰不著脖子。那寶玉就枕便睡著了。彼時李嬤嬤等已進來了，聽見醉了，不敢前來再加觸犯，只悄悄的打聽睡了，方放心散去。,"It turned out that Xiren was not asleep, but he pretended to be asleep on purpose, inviting Baoyu to play tricks on him. First heard the words and asked Baozi and other things, but also did not have to get up; then fell the tea bell, got angry, and hurriedly explained and discouraged. Mother Jia had already sent someone to ask what was wrong. Xiren hurriedly said, ""I just poured the tea, but I was slipped by the snow and smashed the bell."" On the other hand, he comforted Baoyu and said, ""It's fine if you want to drive him out, we are all willing to go out, it's better to take advantage of the situation to join us. If we are all expelled together, it’s okay for us, and you don’t have to worry, another good one will come and serve you.” After hearing this, Baoyu was speechless, and was helped by the attackers to the kang, where she took off her clothes. I don't know what else Baoyu said in his mouth, but his mouth was lingering, his brows became more astringent, and he hurriedly waited for him to fall asleep. Xiren reached out and took off the psychic jade from his neck, wrapped it in his handkerchief, and stuffed it under the mattress. That Baoyu fell asleep on the pillow. At that time, Mammy Li and others had already come in, and when they heard that they were drunk, they did not dare to come forward to further offend her. They only asked quietly that they were sleeping, and then left with confidence.","Hsi Jen was really not asleep, but simply feigning, with the idea, when Pao-yue came, to startle him in play. At first, when she heard him speak of writing, and inquire after the dumplings, she did not think it necessary to get up, but when he flung the tea-cup on the floor, and got into a temper, she promptly jumped up and tried to appease him, and to prevent him by coaxing from carrying out his threat. A waiting-maid sent by dowager lady Chia came in, meanwhile, to ask what was the matter. “I had just gone to pour tea,” replied Hsi Jen, without the least hesitation, “and I slipped on the snow and fell, while the cup dropped from my hand and broke. Your decision to send her away is good,” she went on to advise Pao-yue, “and we are all willing to go also; and why not avail yourself of this opportunity to dismiss us in a body? It will be for our good, and you too on the other hand, needn’t perplex yourself about not getting better people to come and wait on you!” When Pao-yue heard this taunt, he had at length not a word to say, and supported by Hsi Jen and the other attendants on to the couch, they divested him of his clothes. But they failed to understand the drift of what Pao-yue kept on still muttering, and all they could make out was an endless string of words; but his eyes grew heavier and drowsier, and they forthwith waited upon him until he went to sleep; when Hsi Jen unclasped the jade of spiritual perception, and rolling it up in a handkerchief, she lay it under the mattress, with the idea that when he put it on the next day it should not chill his neck. Pao-yue fell sound asleep the moment he lay his head on the pillow. By this time nurse Li and the others had come in, but when they heard that Pao-yue was tipsy, they too did not venture to approach, but gently made inquiries as to whether he was asleep or not. On hearing that he was, they took their departure with their minds more at ease.","All this time Aroma had been only pretending to sleep, hoping by this means to engage Bao-yu’s attention and provoke some coquetry between them. As long as the talk dwelt on calligraphy and Skybright’s dumplings there seemed no pressing need for her to get up; but when she heard him break a teacup and grow really angry she hurriedly rose to her feet and intervened to restrain him. By this time someone had arrived from Grandmother Jia’s room to inquire what all the noise was about. Aroma pretended that she had smashed the cup herself by slipping on some snow while fetching tea. Having disposed of the inquirer, she then proceeded to exhort Bao-yu. ‘Dismiss her by all means, if you really want to I But we should all like to leave with her; so while you are about it, why not make a clean sweep and dismiss the lot of us ? I am sure you will find plenty of other good servants to replace us with.’ Bao-yu had nothing to say to this, and Aroma and the rest helped him onto the kang and started undressing him. He kept trying to tell them something as they did so, but an object seemed to impede his tongue and his eyelids were growing increasingly hot and heavy. Soon the maids had him lying down between covers. Aroma took off the ‘Magic Jade’, wrapped it in a piece of silk, and slipped it under the quilt, so that it should not be cold on his neck the next morning. By this time Bao-yu was already asleep, having dropped off as soon as his head touched the pillow. While this was going on, Nannie Li and the other old women had arrived back at last. Learning that Bao-yu was drunk, they dared not approach him and soon went off again, having satisfied themselves by whispered exchanges that he was safely asleep."
說著，只見小丫頭回來說：「老太太屋裏已擺完了飯了，二奶奶在太太屋裏呢。」周瑞家的聽了，連忙起身，催著劉姥姥說：「快走，快走。這一下來他喫飯是個空子，咱們先趕著去，若遲一步，回事的人也多了，難說話。再歇了中覺，越發沒了時候了。」說著一齊下了炕，打掃打掃衣服，又教了板兒幾句話，隨著周瑞家的，逶迤往賈璉的住處來。,"After speaking, the little girl came back and said, ""The old lady's house has finished the meal, and the second grandmother is in the wife's room."" Zhou Rui's family heard this and got up quickly, urging Grandma Liu to say, ""Let's go, go. There is a chance for him to come down to eat. Let’s hurry up first. If we are one step later, there will be too many people and it will be difficult to talk. After taking a rest, it will become more and more time.” After saying that, they got off the kang and cleaned their clothes. , taught Ban'er a few more words, and following Zhou Rui's family, he walked to Jia Lian's residence.","While yet she spake, the young waiting-maid returned. “In her venerable lady’s apartment,” she reported, “repast has been spread, and already finished; lady Secunda is in madame Wang’s chamber.” As soon as Chou Jui’s wife heard this news, she speedily got up and pressed goody Liu to be off at once. “This is,” she urged, “just the hour for her meal, and as she is free we had better first go and wait for her; for were we to be even one step too late, a crowd of servants will come with their reports, and it will then be difficult to speak to her; and after her siesta, she’ll have still less time to herself.” As she passed these remarks, they all descended the couch together. Goody Liu adjusted their dresses, and, having impressed a few more words of advice on Pan Erh, they followed Chou Jui’s wife through winding passages to Chia Lien’s house.","As she was speaking, the little maid came back, her errand completed. ‘They’ve finished serving lunch at Her Old Ladyship’s. Mrs Lian is still there.’ Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to her feet and urged Grannie Liu to do likewise. ‘Quick! After she comes out from there she’ll be free for a few minutes while she has her meal. We must try and catch her then. If we delay a moment longer, people will start coming in with messages and we shan’t have a chance to speak to her. And once she goes off for her afternoon nap, we’ve really lost her!’ Grannie Liu got off the kang, adjusted her clothing, conducted Ban-er through a rapid revision of his little stock of phrases and followed Zhou Rui’s wife through various twists and turns to Jia Lian’s quarters."
飲酒間，又有十二個舞女上來，請問演何詞曲。警幻道：「就將新製《紅樓夢》十二支演上來。」舞女們答應了，便輕敲檀板，款按銀箏，聽他歌道是：「開闢鴻蒙……」方歌了一句，警幻便說道：「此曲不比塵世中所填傳奇之曲，必有生旦淨末之則，又有南北九宮之限。此或詠嘆一人，或感懷一事，偶成一曲，即可譜入管弦。若非個中人，不知其中之妙。料爾亦未必深明此調。若不先閱其稿，後聽其歌，反成嚼蠟矣。」說畢，回頭命小丫鬟取了《紅樓夢》原稿來，遞與寶玉。寶玉接來，一面目視其文，一面耳聆其歌曰：,"In the drinking room, another twelve dancers came up, and asked me what lyrics and music they would perform. Police Huan said: ""The twelve new pieces of ""Dream of Red Mansions"" will be performed."" The dancers agreed, and then tapped the sandalwood board, pressed the silver zither, and listened to his song: ""Opening up Hongmeng..."" Fang sang a sentence, the police Huan then said: ""This song is not comparable to the legendary songs filled in the world. It must have the rules of life and the end of life, and there are nine palaces in the north and south. This may be a chanting of a person, or a feeling of something, and occasionally a song can be composed into an orchestra. If you're not a good person, you don't know what's in it. I don't think you know this tune. If you don't read the manuscript first, then listen to the song, you'll be chewing wax."" After speaking, he turned around and ordered the little maid to take the ""Dream of Red Mansions"". ""The original manuscript came, and handed it to Baoyu. Baoyu picked it up, looked at the text, and listened to the song, saying:","Pao-yue sang its incessant praise, and, while he sipped his wine, twelve dancing girls came forward, and requested to be told what songs they were to sing. “Take,” suggested the Fairy, “the newly-composed Twelve Sections of the Dream of the Red Chamber, and sing them.” The singing girls signified their obedience, and forthwith they lightly clapped the castagnettes and gently thrummed the virginals. These were the words which they were heard to sing: At the time of the opening of the heavens and the laying out of the earth chaos prevailed. They had just sung this one line when the Fairy exclaimed: “This ballad is unlike the ballads written in the dusty world whose purport is to hand down remarkable events, in which the distinction of scholars, girls, old men and women, and fools is essential, and in which are furthermore introduced the lyrics of the Southern and Northern Palaces. These fairy songs consist either of elegaic effusions on some person or impressions of some occurrence or other, and are impromptu songs readily set to the music of wind or string instruments, so that any one who is not cognisant of their gist cannot appreciate the beauties contained in them. So you are not likely, I fear, to understand this lyric with any clearness; and unless you first peruse the text and then listen to the ballad, you will, instead of pleasure, feel as if you were chewing wax (devoid of any zest).” After these remarks, she turned her head round, and directed a young maidservant to fetch the text of the Dream of the Red Chamber, which she handed to Pao-yue, who took it over; and as he followed the words with his eyes, with his ears he listened to the strains of this song: Preface of the Bream of the Red Chamber.--When the Heavens were opened and earth was laid out chaos prevailed!","As they sat drinking wine, a troupe of twelve dancers entered and inquired what pieces they should perform for the company’s entertainment. ‘You can do the twelve songs of my new song-and-dance suite “A Dream of Golden Days”,’ said Disenchantment. At once the sandalwood clappers began, very softly, to beat out a rhythm, accompanied by the sedate twang of the zheng’s silver strings and by the voice of a singer. ‘When first the world from chaos rose…’ The singer had got no further than the first line of the first song when Disenchantment interrupted. ‘This suite,’ she told Bao-yu, ‘is not like the music-dramas of your earthly composers in which there are always the fixed parts of sheng, dan, jing, mo and so on, and set tunes in the various Northern and Southern modes. In my suite each song is an elegy on a single person or event and the tunes are original compositions which we have orchestrated ourselves. You need to know what the songs are about in order to appreciate them properly. I should not imagine you are very familiar with this sort of entertainment; so unless you read the libretto of the songs first before listening to them, I fear you may find them rather insipid.’ Turning to one of the maids, she ordered her to fetch the manuscript of her libretto of ‘A Dream of Golden Days’ and gave it to Bao-yu to read, so that he could listen to the songs with one eye on the text. These were the words in Dis-enchantment’s manuscript: Prelude: A Dream of Golden Days2"
沒兩盞茶的工夫，寶玉仍來了。林黛玉見了，越發抽抽噎噎的哭個不住。寶玉見了這樣，知難挽回，打疊起千百樣的款語溫言來勸慰。不料自己未張口，只見黛玉先說道：「你又來作什麼？橫豎如今有人和你頑，比我又會唸，又會作，又會寫，又會說笑，又怕你生氣拉了你去，你又作什麼來？死活憑我去罷了！」寶玉聽了，忙上來悄悄的說道：「你這麼個明白人，難道連『親不間疏，先不僭後』也不知道？我雖糊塗，卻明白這兩句話。頭一件，咱們是姑舅姊妹，寶姐姐是兩姨姊妹，論親戚，他比你疏。第二件，你先來，咱們兩個一桌喫，一床睡，長的這麼大了，他是纔來的，豈有個為他疏你的？」林黛玉啐道：「我難道叫你疏他？我成了個什麼人了呢！我是為我的心。」寶玉道：「我也是為的我的心。你的心！你就知你的心，不知我的心不成？」,"Before two cups of tea, Baoyu still came. When Lin Daiyu saw it, she couldn't stop crying. Seeing this, Baoyu felt that it was difficult to recover, and folded thousands of warm words to comfort him. Unexpectedly, before I opened my mouth, I saw Dai Yu first say, ""What are you doing here? There are people who are stubborn with you now, and you can read, write, write, and joke better than me, and I'm afraid that you will be angry and pull you. Go, what are you doing? It’s up to me!” Baoyu heard this, and hurriedly came up and said quietly, “You are such a sensible person, don’t you even know 'keep close to each other, do not be arrogant first’? Although I am confused, I understand these two sentences. First, we are aunts and sisters, and Sister Bao is two aunts and sisters. In terms of relatives, he is less familiar than you. Second, you come first. The bed is so big that he only came here, how could anyone shy away from you?"" Lin Daiyu spat, ""Did I tell you to shy away from him? What kind of person have I become! I did it for me My heart."" Baoyu said, ""I'm also for my heart. Your heart! You know your heart, but I don't know if my heart will work?""","But not time enough had transpired to allow two cups of tea to be drunk, before Pao-yue came back again. At the sight of him, Tai-yue sobbed still more fervently and incessantly, and Pao-yue realising the state she was in, and knowing well enough how arduous a task it would be to bring her round, began to join together a hundred, yea a thousand kinds of soft phrases and tender words to console her. But at an unforeseen moment, and before he could himself open his mouth, he heard Tai-yue anticipate him. “What have you come back again for?” she asked. “Let me die or live, as I please, and have done! You’ve really got at present some one to play with you, one who, compared with me, is able to read and able to compose, able to write, to speak, as well as to joke, one too who for fear lest you should have ruffled your temper dragged you away: and what do you return here for now?” Pao-yue, after listening to all she had to say, hastened to come up to her. “Is it likely,” he observed in a low tone of voice, “that an intelligent person like you isn’t so much as aware that near relatives can’t be separated by a distant relative, and a remote friend set aside an old friend! I’m stupid, there’s no gainsaying, but I do anyhow understand what these two sentiments imply. You and I are, in the first place, cousins on my father’s sister’s side; while sister Pao-ch’ai and I are two cousins on mother’s sides, so that, according to the degrees of relationship, she’s more distant than yourself. In the second place, you came here first, and we two have our meals at one table and sleep in one bed, having ever since our youth grown up together; while she has only recently come, and how could I ever distance you on her account?” “Ts’ui!” Tai-yue exclaimed. “Will I forsooth ever make you distance her! who and what kind of person have I become to do such a thing? What (I said) was prompted by my own motives.” “I too,” Pao-yue urged, “made those remarks prompted by my own heart’s motives, and do you mean to say that your heart can only read the feelings of your own heart, and has no idea whatsoever of my own?”","After about as long as it would take to drink two cups of tea, Bao-yu came back again. During his absence Dai-yu’s sobs seemed to have redoubled in intensity. Seeing the state she was in he realized that it would need careful handling and began turning over in his mind all kinds of soft and soothing things to coax her with. But before he could get his mouth open, she had anticipated him: ‘What have you come for this time? Why can’t you just leave me here to die in peace ? After all, you’ve got a new playmate now – one who can read and write and compose and laugh and talk to you much better than I can. Oh yes, and drag you off to be amused if there’s any danger of your getting upset! I really can’t imagine what you have come back here for!’ ‘“ Old friends are best friends and close kin are kindest,” ‘said Bao-yu, coming over to where she sat and speaking very quietly. ‘You’re too intelligent not to know that. Even a simpleton like me knows that much! Take kinship first: you are my cousin on Father’s side; Cousin Bao is only a mother-cousin. That makes you much the closer kin. And as for length of acquaintance: it was you who came here first. You and I have practically grown up together – eaten at the same table, even slept in the same bed. Compared with you she’s practi-ally a new arrival. Why should I ever be any less close to you because of her?’ ‘Whatever do you take me for? Do you think I want you to be any less close to her because of me? It’s the way I feel that makes me the way I am.’ ‘And it’s the way I feel,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that makes me the way I am! Do you mean to tell me that you know your own feelings about me but still don’t know what my feelings are about you ?’"
話說寶玉養過了三十三天之後，不但身體強壯，亦且連臉上瘡痕平眼，仍回大觀園內去。這也不在話下。,"It is said that after Baoyu had been raised for thirty-three days, not only was his body strong, but he even had the scars on his face and his eyes were flat, so he still returned to the Grand View Garden. That's not a problem either.","After thirty days’ careful nursing, Pao-yue, we will now notice, not only got strong and hale in body, but the scars even on his face completely healed up; so he was able to shift his quarters again into the garden of Broad Vista. But we will banish this topic as it does not deserve any additional explanations.","By the time the thirty-three days’ convalescence had ended, not only were Bao-yu’s health and strength completely restored, but even the burn-marks on his face had vanished, and he was allowed to move back into the Garden."
於是賈蓉送了先生去了，方將這藥方子並脈案都給賈珍看了，說的話也都回了賈珍並尤氏了。尤氏向賈珍說道：「從來大夫不像他說的這麼痛快，想必用的藥也不錯。」賈珍道：「人家原不是混飯喫久慣行醫的人。因為馮紫英我們好，他好容易求了他來了。既有這個人，媳婦的病或者就能好了。他那方子上有人參，就用前日買的那一斤好的罷。」賈蓉聽畢話，方出來叫人抓藥去煎給秦氏喫。不知秦氏服了此藥病勢如何，下回分解。,"So Jia Rong sent her husband, Fang showed Jia Zhen the prescription and pulse case, and all the words she said were returned to Jia Zhen and You Shi. You said to Jia Zhen, ""The doctor has never been as happy as he said, and the medicine must be good."" Jia Zhen said, ""I am not someone who is used to practicing medicine because of Feng Ziying. I begged him to come. With this person, my daughter-in-law's illness may be cured. If there is ginseng in his recipe, just use the pound of the one he bought the day before."" Jia Rong heard the words and called out. People grab the medicine and fry it for Qin Shi to eat. I don't know how Qin Shi's condition will be after taking this medicine, and it will be resolved next time.","Chia Jung forthwith escorted the Doctor and saw him off, and taking the prescription and the diagnosis, he handed them both to Chia Chen for his perusal, and in like manner recounted to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu all that had been said on the subject. “The other doctors have hitherto not expressed any opinions as positive as this one has done,” observed Mrs. Yu, addressing herself to Chia Chen, “so that the medicines to be used are, I think, surely the right ones!” “He really isn’t a man,” rejoined Chia Chen, “accustomed to give much of his time to the practice of medicine, in order to earn rice for his support: and it’s Feng Tzu-ying, who is so friendly with us, who is mainly to be thanked for succeeding, after ever so much trouble, in inducing him to come. But now that we have this man, the illness of our son’s wife may, there is no saying, stand a chance of being cured. But on that prescription of his there is ginseng mentioned, so you had better make use of that catty of good quality which was bought the other day.” Chia Jung listened until the conversation came to a close, after which he left the room, and bade a servant go and buy the medicines, in order that they should be prepared and administered to Mrs. Ch’in. What was the state of Mrs. Ch’in’s illness, after she partook of these medicines, we do not know; but, reader, listen to the explanation given in the chapter which follows.","‘No other doctor has ever spoken so convincingly,’ said You-shi, turning to Cousin Zhen. ‘I am sure his medicine will do her good.’ Cousin Zhen smiled complacently. ‘This man is no medical hack practising for a living,’ he said. ‘It’s only because Feng Zi-ying is such a good friend of mine that he could be persuaded to come and see us. Perhaps with a man like this treating her our daughter-in-law stands some chance of getting better. I see there is ginseng in that prescription, by the way. You can use some of that pound of high-grade ginseng we bought the other day.’ Seeing that they had no more to say, Jia Rong went out and ordered the drugs for Qin-shi’s medicine to be purchased and prepared. But you will have to read the next chapter if you want to know what effect the medicine had on her when she had taken it."
接著，便又聽喝道之聲，原來是忠靖侯史鼎的夫人來了。王夫人、邢夫人、鳳姐等剛迎入上房，又見錦鄉侯、川寧侯、壽山伯三家祭禮擺在靈前。少時，三人下轎，賈政等忙接上大廳。如此親朋你來我去，也不能勝數。只這四十九日，寧國府街上一條白漫漫人來人往，花簇簇宦去官來。,"Then, I heard the sound of shouting again, it turned out to be the wife of Zhongjing Hou Shi Ding. Mrs. Wang, Mrs. Xing, Sister Feng and others had just entered the upper room, and they saw the three families of Jinxianghou, Chuanninghou, and Shoushanbo in front of the spirit. When they were young, the three of them got off the sedan chair, and Jia Zheng and others were busy picking up the hall. Such relatives and friends, you come and I go, can't be counted. On the forty-ninth day alone, a white strip of people came and went on Ningguofu Street, and the eunuchs came to officials.","It was, in fact, the spouse of Shih Ting, the marquis of Chung Ching, who was just arriving. Shih Hsiang-yun, mesdames Wang, and Hsing, lady Feng and the rest came out at once, to greet her, and lead her into the Main Building; when they further saw the sacrificial presents of the three families, of the marquis of Chin Hsiang, the marquis of Ch’uan Ning, and the earl of Shou Shan, likewise spread out in front of the tablet. In a short while, these three noblemen descended from their chairs, and Chia Chen received them in the Large Hall. In like manner all the relatives and friends arrived in such quick succession, one coming, another going, that it is impossible to remember even so much as their number. One thing need be said that during these forty-nine days the street on which the Ning Kuo mansion stood, was covered with a sheet of white, formed by the people, coming and going; and thronged with clusters of flowers, as the officials came and went.","But no sooner had the eunuch gone than the sound of criers was once more heard in the street, this time heralding the arrival of the Marchioness of Zhong-jing, wife of Grandmother Jia’s nephew Shi Ding, with her little niece Shi Xiang-yun. Lady Wang, Lady Xing and Wang Xi-feng received them in Cousin Zhen’s drawing-room. Offerings from the Marquises of Jin-xiang and Chuan-ning and the Earl of Shou-shan were now on display, and those three gentlemen were shortly to be observed alighting from their palanquins outside. Cousin Zhen went out to meet them and conducted them up the steps into the main reception hall. From then on there was a continuous stream of arrivals, and throughout the whole forty-nine-day period the street in front of the Ning-guo mansion was thronged with family mourners in white and mandarins in their colourful robes of office, milling in and out and to and fro all day long."
不言卜家夫婦，且說賈蕓賭氣離了母舅家門，一徑回歸舊路。心下正自煩惱，一邊想，一邊低頭只管走，不想一頭就碰在一個醉漢身上。把賈蕓唬了一跳。聽那醉漢罵道：「臊你娘的！瞎了眼睛，碰起我來了。」賈蕓忙要躲身，早被那醉漢一把抓住，對面一看，不是別人，卻是緊鄰倪二。原來這倪二是個潑皮，專放重利債，在賭博場喫閑錢，專管打架喫酒。如今正從欠錢人家索了利錢，喫醉回來，不想被賈蕓碰了一頭，正沒好氣，掄拳就要打。只聽那人叫道：「老二住手！是我衝撞了你。」倪二聽見是熟人的語音，將醉眼睜開看時，見是賈蕓，忙把手鬆了，趔趄著笑道：「原來是賈二爺，我該死，我該死。這會子往那裏去？」賈蕓道：「告訴不得你，平白的又討了個沒趣兒。」倪二道：「不妨不妨，有什麼不平的事，告訴我，替你出氣。這三街六巷，憑他是誰，有人得罪了我醉金剛倪二的街坊，管叫他人離家散！」,"Not to mention the Bu family and his wife, but also to say that Jia Yun left her mother's uncle's house in a fit of anger and returned to the old way. I was feeling annoyed at the bottom of my heart, and while thinking, I lowered my head and just walked away, not wanting to bump into a drunk man. Jia Yun was stunned. Hearing the drunk man scolding: ""Sham your mother! Blind eyes, bumped into me."" Jia Yun was about to hide, but was grabbed by the drunk man, and when she looked across, it was not someone else, but Ni next to Ni. two. It turns out that this Ni Er is a scumbag, specializing in high-interest debts, spending free money in casinos, and specializing in fighting and drinking. Now that I'm claiming money from someone who owes money, I come back drunk, and I don't want to be bumped by Jia Yun. I just heard the man shout, ""Stop the second child! It was I who bumped into you."" Ni Er heard the voice of an acquaintance. When he opened his drunken eyes and saw that it was Jia Yun, he hurriedly released his hand and said with a staggering smile: ""It turned out to be the second master Jia, I should be damned, I should be damned. Where are we going now?"" Jia Yun said, ""I can't tell you, it's not fun to beg for nothing."" Ni Er said: ""It's okay, what's wrong? , tell me, vent your anger for you. These three streets and six alleys, depending on who he is, someone offends my Neighbors of Drunk King Ni Er, and calls others to leave home!""","But without passing any further remarks on the husband and wife of the Pu family, we will now confine ourselves to Chia Yuen. Having gone in high dudgeon out of the door of his uncle’s house, he started straight on his way back home; but while distressed in mind, and preoccupied with his thoughts, he paced on with drooping head, he unexpectedly came into collision with a drunken fellow, who gripped Chia Yuen, and began to abuse him, crying: “Are your eyes gone blind, that you come bang against me?” The tone of voice, when it reached Chia Yuen ears, sounded like that of some one with whom he was intimate; and, on careful scrutiny, he found, in fact, that it was his next-door neighbour, Ni Erh. This Ni Erh was a dissolute knave, whose only idea was to give out money at heavy rates of interest and to have his meals in the gambling dens. His sole delight was to drink and to fight. He was, at this very moment, coming back home from the house of a creditor, whom he had dunned, and was already far gone with drink, so that when, at an unforeseen moment, Chia Yuen ran against him, he meant there and then to start a scuffle with him. “Old Erh!” Chia Yuen shouted, “stay your hand; it’s I who have hustled against you.” As soon as Ni Erh heard the tone of his voice, he opened wide his drunken eyes and gave him a look; and realising that it was Chia Yuen, he hastened to loosen his grasp and to remark with a smile, as he staggered about, “Is it you indeed, master Chia Secundus? where were you off to now?” “I couldn’t tell you!” Chia Yuen rejoined; “I’ve again brought displeasure upon me, and all through no fault of mine.” “Never mind!” urged Ni Erh, “if you’re in any trouble you just tell me, and I’ll give vent to your spite for you; for in these three streets, and six lanes, no matter who may give offence to any neighbours of mine, of me, Ni Erh, the drunken Chin Kang, I’ll wager that I compel that man’s family to disperse, and his home to break up!”","Angrily leaving his uncle’s house behind him, he was on his way back home, eyes fixed on the ground as he brooded miserably on his affairs, when he walked head-on into a drunkard. The man seized hold of him with a curse: ‘You sodding blind, bumping into me like that?’ The voice was a familiar one. Looking closer he saw that it was his neighbour Ni Er, a racketeer who made most of his money from high-interest loans supplemented by what he took off other players in the gambling dens. He drank too much and was always getting into fights. At this particular moment he was on his way back from paying a little ‘call’ on one of his debtors – evidently a lucrative one, for he was already half-seas-over. He did not take kindly to being bumped into, and it would have gone badly with Jia Yun if he had not immediately identified himself: ‘Ni, old chap, don’t strike I It’s me! I wasn’t looking where I was going.’ Hearing the voice, Ni Er opened his bleary eyes a little wider, saw that it was Jia Yun, released him – lurching heavily as he did so – and gave a crapulous laugh: ‘Oh,’ he said, ‘young Mist’ Jia. Parm me. Wherra you jus’ come from?’ ‘Don’t ask me!’"
這士隱正癡想，忽見隔壁葫蘆廟內寄居的一個窮儒，姓賈名化、表字時飛、別號雨村者，走了出來。這賈雨村原係湖州人氏，原是詩書仕宦之族，因他生於末世，父母祖宗根基已盡，人口衰喪，祇剩得他一身一口，在家鄉無益，因進京求取功名，再整基業。自前歲來此，又淹蹇住了，暫寄廟中安身，每日賣字作文為生，故士隱常與他交接。當下雨村見了士隱，忙施禮陪笑道：「老先生倚門佇望，敢是街市上有甚新聞否？」士隱笑道：「非也。適因小女啼哭，引他出來作耍，正是無聊之甚，兄來得正妙，請入小齋一談，彼此皆可消此永晝。」說著，便令人送女兒進去，自與雨村攜手來至書房中，小童獻茶。方談得三五句話，忽家人飛報：「嚴老爺來拜。」士隱慌的忙起身謝罪道：「恕誑駕之罪，略坐，弟即來陪。」雨村忙起身，亦讓道：「老先生請便。晚生乃常造之客，稍候何妨。」說著，士隱已出前廳去了。,"This Shiyin was just thinking about it, when he suddenly saw a poor Confucian living in the Hulu Temple next door, with the surname of Jia and the name of Hua, the name of Shifei, and the alias of Yucun, walking out. This Jia Yucun was originally a native of Huzhou, and was originally a family of poets and officials. Because he was born in the last days, his parents and ancestral foundations have been exhausted, and the population has declined. Only he is left alone, which is useless in his hometown, because he went to Beijing to seek fame. Reorganize the foundation. Since he came here in the previous year, he lived in flooded Jian again. He temporarily settled in the temple and made a living selling calligraphy and writing every day. Therefore, Shi Yin often communicated with him. When Yucun met Shiyin, he hurriedly saluted Shiyin and said with a smile, ""Old gentleman leaning against the door and looking at it, is there any news in the street market?"" Shiyin laughed and said, ""No. It's because the little girl was crying and he was led out to play. , it’s just boring, my brother came just right, please enter the small room and talk, and we can both spend this eternal day.” Having said that, he sent his daughter in, and since he and Yucun came to the study together, the child offered tea. . Fang talked about three or five sentences, and suddenly his family reported: ""Master Yan is here to worship."" Shiyin hurriedly got up and apologized: ""Forgive the sin of driving, sit down for a while, and my brother will come to accompany you."" The resigner said, ""Old gentleman, please take care of yourself. Wansheng is a frequent guest, so why not wait."" With that, Shiyin left the front hall.","While Shih-yin gave way to these foolish reflections, he suddenly noticed the arrival of a penniless scholar, Chia by surname, Hua by name, Shih-fei by style and Yue-ts’un by nickname, who had taken up his quarters in the Gourd temple next door. This Chia Yue-ts’un was originally a denizen of Hu-Chow, and was also of literary and official parentage, but as he was born of the youngest stock, and the possessions of his paternal and maternal ancestors were completely exhausted, and his parents and relatives were dead, he remained the sole and only survivor; and, as he found his residence in his native place of no avail, he therefore entered the capital in search of that reputation, which would enable him to put the family estate on a proper standing. He had arrived at this place since the year before last, and had, what is more, lived all along in very straitened circumstances. He had made the temple his temporary quarters, and earned a living by daily occupying himself in composing documents and writing letters for customers. Thus it was that Shih-yin had been in constant relations with him. As soon as Yue-ts’un perceived Shih-yin, he lost no time in saluting him. “My worthy Sir,” he observed with a forced smile; “how is it you are leaning against the door and looking out? Is there perchance any news astir in the streets, or in the public places?” “None whatever,” replied Shih-yin, as he returned the smile. “Just a while back, my young daughter was in sobs, and I coaxed her out here to amuse her. I am just now without anything whatever to attend to, so that, dear brother Chia, you come just in the nick of time. Please walk into my mean abode, and let us endeavour, in each other’s company, to while away this long summer day.” After he had made this remark, he bade a servant take his daughter in, while he, hand-in-hand with Yue-ts’un, walked into the library, where a young page served tea. They had hardly exchanged a few sentences, when one of the household came in, in flying haste, to announce that Mr. Yen had come to pay a visit. Shih-yin at once stood up. “Pray excuse my rudeness,” he remarked apologetically, “but do sit down; I shall shortly rejoin you, and enjoy the pleasure of your society.” “My dear Sir,” answered Yue-ts’un, as he got up, also in a conceding way, “suit your own convenience. I’ve often had the honour of being your guest, and what will it matter if I wait a little?” While these apologies were yet being spoken, Shih-yin had already walked out into the front parlour.","He was still standing outside his door brooding when Jia Yu-cun, the poor student who lodged at the Bottle-gourd Temple next door, came up to him. Yu-cun was a native of Hu-zhou and came from a family of scholars and bureaucrats which had, however, fallen on bad times when Yu-cun was born. The family fortunes on both his father’s and mother’s side had all been spent, and the members of the family had themselves gradually died off until only Yu-cun was left. There were no prospects for him in his home town, so he had set off for the capital, in search of fame and fortune. Unfortunately he had got no further than Soochow when his funds ran out, and he had now been living there in poverty for a year, lodging in this temple and keeping himself alive by working as a copyist. For this reason Shi-yin saw a great deal of his company. As soon as he caught sight of Shi-yin, Yu-cun clasped his hands in greeting and smiled ingratiatingly. ‘I could see you standing there gazing, sir. Has anything been happening in the street?’ ‘No, no,’ said Shi-yin. ‘It just happened’that my little girl was crying, so I brought her out here to amuse her. Your coming is most opportune, dear boy. I was beginning to feel most dreadfully bored. Won’t you come into my little den, and we can help each other to while away this tedious hot day ?’ So saying, he called for a servant to take the child indoors, while he himself took Yu-cun by the hand and led him into his study, where his boy served them both with tea. But they had not exchanged half-a-dozen words before one of the servants rushed in to say that ‘Mr Yan had come to pay a call.’ Shi-yin hurriedly rose up and excused himself: ‘I seem to have brought you here under false pretences. I do hope you will forgive me. If you don’t mind sitting on your own here for a moment, I shall be with you directly.’ Yu-cun rose to his feet too. ‘Please do not distress yourself on my account, sir. I am a regular visitor here and can easily wait a bit.’ But by the time he had finished saying this, Shi-yin was already out of the study and on his way to the guestroom."
那寶玉亦在孩提之間，況自天性所稟來的一片愚拙偏僻，視姊妹弟兄皆出一意，並無親疏遠近之別。其中因與黛玉同隨賈母一處坐臥，故略比別個姊妹熟慣些。既熟慣，則更覺親密；既親密，則不免一時有求全之毀，不虞之隙。這日不知為何，他二人言語有些不合起來，黛玉又氣的獨在房中垂淚，寶玉又自悔言語冒撞，前去俯就，那黛玉方漸漸的回轉來。,"That Baoyu was also a child, and because of her natural inclination to be foolish and remote, she regarded her sisters and brothers as having the same idea, and there was no difference between closeness and distance. Among them, because she and Daiyu sit and lie down with Jia's mother, she is a little more familiar than other sisters. Once you are used to it, you will feel more intimate; if you are intimate, you will inevitably be destroyed by seeking perfection for a while, and there will be no gaps. That day, for some unknown reason, the two of them did not agree with each other. Daiyu was alone in the room weeping angrily. Baoyu regretted the rambling of her words, and went to bow down.","Pao-yue was, likewise, in the prime of his boyhood, and was, besides, as far as the bent of his natural disposition was concerned, in every respect absurd and perverse; regarding his cousins, whether male or female, one and all with one common sentiment, and without any distinction whatever between the degrees of distant or close relationship. Sitting and sleeping, as he now was under the same roof with Tai-yue in dowager lady Chia ’s suite of rooms, he naturally became comparatively more friendly with her than with his other cousins; and this friendliness led to greater intimacy and this intimacy once established, rendered unavoidable the occurrence of the blight of harmony from unforeseen slight pretexts. These two had had on this very day, for some unknown reason, words between them more or less unfriendly, and Tai-yue was again sitting all alone in her room, giving way to tears. Pao-yue was once more within himself quite conscience-smitten for his ungraceful remarks, and coming forward, he humbly made advances, until, at length, Tai-yue little by little came round.","As for Bao-yu, he was still only a child – a child, moreover, whom nature had endowed with the eccentric obtuseness of a simpleton. Brothers, sisters, cousins, were all one to him. In his relationships with people he made no distinction between one person and another. If his relationship with Dai-yu was exceptional, it was because greater proximity – since she was living with him in his grandmother’s quarters – made her more familiar to him than the rest; and greater familiarity bred greater intimacy. And of course, with greater intimacy came the occasional tiffs and misunderstandings that are usual with people who have a great deal to do with each other. One day the two of them had fallen out over something or other and the argument had ended with Dai-yu crying alone in her room and Bao-yu feeling remorsefully that perhaps he had spoken too roughly. Presently he went in to make his peace with her and gradually, very gradually, Dai-yu’s equanimity was restored."
寶玉回至園中，襲人正記掛著他去見賈政，不知是禍是福；只見寶玉醉醺醺的回來，問其原故，寶玉一一向他說了。襲人道：「人家牽腸掛肚的等著，你且高樂去，也到底打發人來給個信兒。」寶玉道：「我何嘗不要送信兒，只因馮世兄來了，就混忘了。」,"When Baoyu returned to the garden, Xiren was thinking about him going to see Jia Zheng. He didn't know whether it was a disaster or a blessing. When Baoyu came back drunk and asked why, Baoyu told him one by one. Xiren said: ""People are waiting with worry, you go happily, and in the end send someone to give a letter."" Baoyu said: ""Why don't I send a letter, just because Feng Shixiong came, I forgot about it.""","Pao-yue returned into the garden in time to find Hsi Jen thinking with solicitude that he had gone to see Chia Cheng and wondering whether it foreboded good or evil. As soon as she perceived Pao-yue come back in a drunken state, she felt urged to inquire the reason of it all. Pao-yue told her one by one the particulars of what happened. “People,” added Hsi Jen, “wait for you with lacerated heart and anxious mind, and there you go and make merry; yet you could very well, after all, have sent some one with a message.” “Didn’t I purpose sending a message?” exclaimed Pao-yue. “Of course, I did! But I failed to do so, as on the arrival of friend Feng, I got so mixed up that the intention vanished entirely from my mind.” While excusing himself, he saw Pao-ch’ai enter the apartment.","When the party finally broke up, Bao-yu returned to the Garden in a state of cheerful inebriation. Aroma, who had had no idea what the summons from Jia Zheng might portend and was still wondering anxiously what had become of him, at once demanded to know the cause of his condition. He gave her a full account of what had happened. ‘Well really!’ said Aroma. ‘Here were we practically beside ourselves with anxiety, and all the time you were there enjoying yourself! You might at least have sent word to let us know you were all right.’ ‘I was going to send word,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Of course I was. But then old Feng arrived and it put it out of my mind.’"
原來，雨村因那年士隱贈銀之後，他於十六日便起身入都，至大比之期，不料他十分得意，已中了進士，選入外班，今已昇了本府知府。雖才於優長，未免有些貪酷之弊；且又恃才侮上，那些官員皆側目而視。不上一年，便被上司尋了個空隙，作成一本，參他「情性狡猾，擅纂禮儀；外沽清正之名，而暗結虎狼之屬，致使地方多事，民命不堪」等語。龍顏大怒，即批革職。該部文書一到，本府官員無不喜悅。那雨村心中雖十分慚恨，卻面上全無一點怨色，仍是嘻笑自若；交代過公事，將歷年做官積的些資本並家小人屬送至原籍，安排妥協，卻是自己擔風袖月，遊覽天下勝跡。,"It turned out that after Yu Cun gave silver to Shi Yin that year, he got up and entered the capital on the 16th. At the time of the big competition, he was very proud. . Although he was talented and superior, it was a bit greedy and cruel; and because he was insulted by his talents, those officials all looked sideways. Less than a year ago, he was found by his superiors, and he made a book, referring to his ""cunning temperament, good at compiling etiquette; selling out the name of integrity, but secretly tying the genus of tigers and wolves, causing troubles in the place and unbearable life for the people"", etc. language. Longyan was furious and was dismissed. When the document arrived, the officials of the government were all delighted. Although Na Yucun was very embarrassed, there was no resentment on his face, and he was still smiling freely; he had explained his official business, and he had sent some of the capital and family members that he had accumulated over the years as an official to his hometown, and arranged a compromise, but it was himself. Bear the wind and the moon, and visit the world's scenic spots.","The fact is that after Yue-ts’un had been presented with the money by Shih-yin, he promptly started on the 16th day for the capital, and at the triennial great tripos, his wishes were gratified to the full. Having successfully carried off his degree of graduate of the third rank, his name was put by selection on the list for provincial appointments. By this time, he had been raised to the rank of Magistrate in this district; but, in spite of the excellence and sufficiency of his accomplishments and abilities, he could not escape being ambitious and overbearing. He failed besides, confident as he was in his own merits, in respect toward his superiors, with the result that these officials looked upon him scornfully with the corner of the eye. A year had hardly elapsed, when he was readily denounced in a memorial to the Throne by the High Provincial authorities, who represented that he was of a haughty disposition, that he had taken upon himself to introduce innovations in the rites and ceremonies, that overtly, while he endeavoured to enjoy the reputation of probity and uprightness, he, secretly, combined the nature of the tiger and wolf; with the consequence that he had been the cause of much trouble in the district, and that he had made life intolerable for the people, &c. &c. The Dragon countenance of the Emperor was considerably incensed. His Majesty lost no time in issuing commands, in reply to the Memorial, that he should be deprived of his official status. On the arrival of the despatch from the Board, great was the joy felt by every officer, without exception, of the prefecture in which he had held office. Yue-ts’un, though at heart intensely mortified and incensed, betrayed not the least outward symptom of annoyance, but still preserved, as of old, a smiling and cheerful countenance. He handed over charge of all official business and removed the savings which he had accumulated during the several years he had been in office, his family and all his chattels to his original home; where, after having put everything in proper order, he himself travelled (carried the winds and sleeved the moon) far and wide, visiting every relic of note in the whole Empire.","When Yu-cun received the gift of money from Zhen Shi-yin he had left for the capital on the day after the festival. He had done well in the Triennial examination, passing out as a Palace Graduate, and had been selected for external service. And now he had been promoted to the magistracy of this district. But although his intelligence and ability were outstanding, these qualities were unfortunately offset by a certain cupidity and harshness and a tendency to use his intelligence in order to outwit his superiors; all of which caused his fellow-officials to cast envious glances in his direction, with the result that in less than a year an unfavourable report was sent in by a senior official stating that his ‘seeming ability was no more han a mask for cunning and duplicity’ and citing one or two instances in which he had aided and abetted the peculations of his underlings or allied himself with powerful local interests in order to frustrate the course of justice. The imperial eye, lighting on this report, kindled with wrath. Yu-cun’s instant dismissal was commanded. The officials at the Prefecture, when notice that he was to be cashiered arrived from the Ministry, rejoiced to a man. But Yu-cun, in spite of all the shame and chagrin that he felt, allowed no glimmer of resentment to appear on his face. Indeed, he joked and smiled as before, and when the business of handing over was completed, he took his wife and family and the loot he had accumulated during his years of office and having settled them all safely in his native Hu-zhou, set off, free as the air, on an extended tour of some of the more celebrated places of scenic interest in our mighty empire."
寶玉見寶釵如此說，便拭汗道：「我這會子總想不起什麼典故出處來。」寶釵笑道：「你只把『綠玉』的『玉』字改作『蠟』字就是了。」寶玉道：「『綠蠟』可有出處？」寶釵見問，悄悄的咂嘴點頭笑道：「虧你今夜不過如此，將來金殿對策，你大約連『趙錢孫李』都忘了呢！唐錢珝詠芭蕉詩頭一句：『冷燭無煙綠蠟乾』，你都忘了不成？」寶玉聽了，不覺洞開心臆，笑道：「該死，該死！現成眼前之物偏倒想不起來了，真可謂『一字師』了。從此後我只叫你師父，再不叫姐姐了。」寶釵亦悄悄的笑道：「還不快作上去，只管姐姐妹妹的。誰是你姐姐？那上頭穿黃袍的纔是你姐姐，你又認我這姐姐來了。」一面說笑，因說笑又怕他耽延工夫，遂抽身走開了。寶玉只得續成，共有了三首。,"Seeing Baochai say this, Baoyu wiped his sweat and said, ""I can't remember any allusions for a while now."" Baochai smiled and said, ""You just change the word for ""jade"" in ""green jade"" to the word for ""wax"". Baoyu said, ""Is there a source for 'Green Wax'?"" Baochai smacked his lips and nodded with a smile, ""It's a shame that you didn't do this tonight. In the future, the Golden Temple's countermeasures will probably have you even 'Zhao Qiansun Li'. Forget it! The first sentence of Tang Qianjue's poem on bananas: 'Cold candle smokeless green wax dry', have you forgotten it?"" Baoyu heard this, and laughed, ""Damn it, damn it! I can't remember the thing, it's really a 'one-character teacher'. From now on, I'll only call you Master, no longer sister."" Baochai also smiled quietly: ""Don't hurry up, just take care of sister and sister. Who is your sister? The one wearing the yellow robe is your sister, and you recognize my sister here."" While joking, because he was joking and was afraid that he would delay his work, he pulled away and walked away. Baoyu had to continue, and there were three songs in total.","When Pao-yue heard the suggestion made by Pao-ch’ai, he speedily replied, as he wiped off the perspiration: “I can’t at all just at present call to mind any passage from the contents of some old book.” “Just simply take,” proposed Pao-ch’ai smilingly, “the character jade in jade-like green and change it into the character wax, that’s all.” “Does ‘green wax,’“ Pao-yue inquired, “come out from anywhere?” Pao-ch’ai gently smacked her lips and nodded her head as she laughed. “I fear,” she said, “that if, on an occasion like to-night, you show no more brains than this, by and by when you have to give any answers in the golden hall, to the questions (of the examiner), you will, really, forget (the very first four names) of Chao, Oh’ien, Sun and Li (out of the hundred)! What, have you so much as forgotten the first line of the poem by Han Yue, of the T’ang dynasty, on the Banana leaf: “Cold is the candle and without a flame, the green wax dry?” On hearing these words, Pao-yue’s mind suddenly became enlightened. “What a fool I am!” he added with a simper; “I couldn’t for the moment even remember the lines, ready-made though they were and staring at me in my very eyes! Sister, you really can be styled my teacher, little though you may have taught me, and I’ll henceforward address you by no other name than ‘teacher,’ and not call you ‘sister’ any more!” “Don’t you yet hurry to go on,” Pao-ch’ai again observed in a gentle tone of voice sneeringly, “but keep on calling me elder sister and younger sister? Who’s your sister? that one over there in a yellow coat is your sister!” But apprehending, as she bandied these jokes, lest she might be wasting his time, she felt constrained to promptly move away; whereupon Pao-yue continued the ode he had been working at, and brought it to a close, writing in all three stanzas.","‘It’s all very well for you to talk,’ said Bao-yu, mopping the perspiration from his brow, ‘but at this particular moment I can’t think of any allusion that would do.’ ‘Why don’t you put “in spring green waxen sheaths” in place of your “sheathed skirts of lucent green”?’ ‘Where do you get “green waxen” from?’ said Bao-yu. ‘Tut, tut, tut!’ Bao-chai shook her head pityingly. ‘If this is what you are like tonight, Heaven knows what you’ll be like in a few years’ time when you come to take the Palace Examination. Probably you’ll find you have forgotten even the Child’s First Primer of Rhyming Names. It’s from the Tang poet Qian Xu’s poem “Furled Plantains”: Green waxen candles from which no flames rise. Do you mean to say you’ve forgotten that?’ The scales fell from Bao-yu’s eyes. ‘Good gracious, how stupid of me! The words are there ready-made and I didn’t think of them! I shall have to call you my “One Word Teacher”, like the poet in the story! I shan’t be able to treat you like a sister any more, I shall have to say “sir” when I speak to you!’ ‘Sister!’ said Bao-chai with a little laugh. ‘Stop fooling about and get on with your poem! That’s your sister, sitting up there in the golden robe. I’m no sister of yours!’ Fearing that he would waste more time if she stayed, she slipped quietly away. The poem finished, Bao-yu had now completed three out of the four commanded."
劉姥姥聽了謝過，遂攜了板兒，繞到後門上。只見門前歇著些生意擔子，也有賣喫的，也有賣頑耍物件的，鬧吵吵三二十個小孩子在那裏廝鬧。劉姥姥便拉住一個道：「我問哥兒一聲，有個周大娘可在家麼？」孩子們道：「那個周大娘？我們這裏周大娘有三個呢，還有兩個周奶奶，不知是那一行當的？」劉姥姥道：「是太太的陪房周瑞。」孩子道：「這個容易，你跟我來。」說著，跳躥躥的引著劉姥姥進了後門，至一院牆邊，指與劉姥姥道：「這就是他家。」又叫道：「周大娘，有個老奶奶來找你呢，我帶了來了。」,"Grandma Liu heard her thanks, so she took the board and went around to the back door. I saw some business burdens resting in front of the door, some selling food, some selling naughty things, and thirty or twenty children were arguing there. Grandma Liu grabbed one and said, ""I'll ask my brother, is there any Aunt Zhou at home?"" The children said, ""That Aunt Zhou? We have three Aunt Zhou here, and two Grandma Zhou, I don't know. Which line is it?"" Grandma Liu said, ""It's the wife's escort Zhou Rui."" The child said, ""This is easy, come with me."" After saying that, she jumped and led Grandma Liu into the back door. Next to the wall of the courtyard, he pointed to Grandma Liu and said, ""This is his house."" Then he called out, ""Aunt Zhou, an old grandma is looking for you. I brought it here.""","Goody Liu, having expressed her thanks, forthwith went, leading Pan Erh by the hand, round to the back door, where she saw several pedlars resting their burdens. There were also those who sold things to eat, and those who sold playthings and toys; and besides these, twenty or thirty boys bawled and shouted, making quite a noise. Goody Liu readily caught hold of one of them. “I’d like to ask you just a word, my young friend,” she observed; “there’s a Mrs. Chou here; is she at home?” “Which Mrs. Chou?” inquired the boy; “we here have three Mrs. Chous; and there are also two young married ladies of the name of Chou. What are the duties of the one you want, I wonder ?” “She’s a waiting-woman of my lady,” replied goody Liu. “It’s easy to get at her,” added the boy; “just come along with me.” Leading the way for goody Liu into the backyard, they reached the wall of a court, when he pointed and said, “This is her house.--Mother Chou!” he went on to shout with alacrity; “there’s an old lady who wants to see you.” Chou Jui’s wife was at home, and with all haste she came out to greet her visitor.","Grannie Liu thanked him and trotted off with little Ban-er all the way round to the rear entrance. There she found a number of sweetmeat vendors and toy-sellers who had set their wares down outside the gate and were being beseiged by a crowd of some twenty or thirty noisy, yelling children. She grabbed a small urchin from their midst and drew him towards her. ‘Tell me, sonny, is there a Mrs Zhou living here?’ The urchin stared back at her impudently. ‘Which Mrs Zhou? There are several Mrs Zhous here. What’s her job?’ ‘She’s the Mrs Zhou that came here with Her Ladyship when she was married.’ ‘That’s easy,’ said the urchin. ‘Follow me!’ He led Grannie Liu into a rear courtyard. ‘ That’s where she lives,’ he said, pointing in the direction of a side wall."
後面又畫著一盆茂蘭，旁有一位鳳冠霞帔的美人。也有判云：「桃李春風結子完，到頭誰似一盆蘭。如冰水好空相妒，枉與他人作笑談。」,"At the back is another painting of a pot of Maolan, next to a beauty with a phoenix crown. There is also a judgment saying: ""When the peach and plum blossoms are finished in the spring, who is like a pot of orchids in the end. It's like ice water so empty and jealous, it's useless to joke with others.""","Following these verses, was drawn a pot of Orchids, by the side of which, was a beautiful maiden in a phoenix-crown and cloudy mantle (bridal dress); and to this picture was appended this device: What time spring wanes, then fades the bloom of peach as well as plum! Who ever can like a pot of the olea be winsome! With ice thy purity will vie, vain their envy will be! In vain a laughing-stock people will try to make of thee.","This was followed by a picture of a vigorously growing orchid in a pot, beside which stood a lady in full court dress. The words said: The plum-tree bore her fruit after the rest, Yet, when all’s done, her Orchid was the best. Against your ice-pure nature all in vain The tongues of envy wagged; you felt no pain."
寶玉送他二人到房，那天已二更多時，襲人來催了幾次，方回自己房中來睡。次日天明時，便披衣靸鞋往黛玉房中來，不見紫鵑、翠縷二人，只見他姊妹兩個尚臥在衾內。那林黛玉嚴嚴密密裹著一幅杏子紅綾被，安穩合目而睡。那史湘雲卻一把青絲拖於枕畔，被只齊胸，一彎雪白的膀子撂於被外，又帶著兩個金鐲子。寶玉見了，嘆道：「睡覺還是不老實！回來風吹了，又嚷肩窩疼了。」一面說，一面輕輕的替他蓋上。林黛玉早已醒了，覺得有人，就猜著定是寶玉，因翻身一看，果中其料。因說道：「這早晚就跑過來作什麼？」寶玉笑道：「這天還早呢！你起來瞧瞧。」黛玉道：「你先出去，讓我們起來。」寶玉聽了，轉身出至外邊。,"Baoyu sent the two of them to the room. It was more than two hours later that day, and after a few urges, he went back to his room to sleep. At dawn the next day, he went to Daiyu's room in his clothes and shoes, but Zijuan and Cuilui were not seen, only his two sisters were still lying in the quilt. That Lin Daiyu was tightly wrapped in an apricot red quilt, and she slept peacefully with her eyes closed. That Shi Xiangyun dragged a piece of blue silk on the pillow, the blanket was only chest-length, a snow-white arm was placed on the outside of the blanket, and he was wearing two gold bracelets. Seeing this, Baoyu sighed, ""It's still dishonest to sleep! When I came back, the wind was blowing, and I complained that my shoulders hurt again."" As he spoke, he gently covered him. Lin Daiyu had already woken up, and when she felt someone was there, she guessed it was Baoyu, because she turned around and saw it. Yin said, ""What are you doing here sooner or later?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""It's still early today! Get up and take a look."" Daiyu said, ""Go out first, let us get up."" to the outside.","Hsiang-yuen, as of old, betook herself to Tai-yue’s quarters to rest, and Pao-yue escorted them both into their apartment, and it was after the hour had already past the second watch, and Hsi Jen had come and pressed him several times, that he at length returned to his own bedroom and went to sleep. The next morning, as soon as it was daylight, he threw his clothes over him, put on his low shoes and came over into Tai-yue’s room, where he however saw nothing of the two girls Tzu Chuean and Ts’ui Lu, as there was no one else here in there besides his two cousins, still reclining under the coverlets. Tai-yue was closely wrapped in a quilt of almond-red silk, and lying quietly, with closed eyes fast asleep; while Shih Hsiang-yuen, with her handful of shiny hair draggling along the edge of the pillow, was covered only up to the chest, and outside the coverlet rested her curved snow-white arm, with the gold bracelets, which she had on. At the sight of her, Pao-yue heaved a sigh. “Even when asleep,” he soliloquised, “she can’t be quiet! but by and by, when the wind will have blown on her, she’ll again shout that her shoulder is sore!” With these words, he gently covered her, but Lin Tai-yue had already awoke out of her sleep, and becoming aware that there was some one about, she promptly concluded that it must, for a certainty, be Pao-yue, and turning herself accordingly round, and discovering at a glance that the truth was not beyond her conjectures, she observed: “What have you run over to do at this early hour?” to which question Pao-yue replied: “Do you call this early? but get up and see for yourself !” “First quit the room,” Tai-yue suggested, “and let us get up!”","Bao-yu saw the two of them back to their room and stayed there talking until well after ten, in spite of frequent summonses by Aroma. As soon as it was light next morning, Bao-yu was off again to the girls’ room, shuffling along in his slippers and with a gown thrown loosely round his shoulders. The maids Nightingale and Kingfisher were not yet about, and their two young mistresses still lay fast asleep under the covers. Dai-yu was tightly cocooned in a quilt of apricot-coloured damask, the picture of tranquil repose. Xiang-yun, by contrast, lay with her hank of jet-black hair tumbled untidily beside the pillow, a white arm with its two gold bracelets thrown carelessly outside the bedding and two white shoulders exposed above the peach-pink coverlet, which barely reached her armpits. ‘A tomboy, even in her sleep!’ Bao-yu muttered ruefully as he gently drew the bedding up to cover her. ‘ She’ll get a draught on those shoulders, and next thing she’ll be complaining of a stiff neck!’ Dai-yu had by now awakened. She sensed that there was someone else in the room, and guessing that it must be Bao-yu, lifted her head up to look. Sure enough, it was he. ‘What are you doing here at this early hour?’ ‘Early ? Get up and have a look and then tell me if you think it’s early !’ ‘You’d better go outside a minute if you want us to get up,’ said Dai-yu. Bao-yu went into the outer room."
茗煙在窗外道：「他是東胡同子裏璜大奶奶的侄兒。那是什麼硬正仗腰子的，也來唬我們。璜大奶奶是他姑娘。你那姑媽只會打旋磨子，給我們璉二奶奶跪著借當頭。我眼裏就看不起他那樣的主子奶奶！」李貴忙斷喝不止，說：「偏你這小狗肏的知道，有這些蛆嚼！」寶玉冷笑道：「我只當是誰的親戚，原來是璜嫂子的侄兒，我就去問問他來！」說著便要走，叫茗煙進來包書。茗煙包著書，又得意道：「爺也不用自己去見，等我到他家，就說老太太有話問他呢，雇上一輛車拉進去，當著老太太問他，豈不省事。」李貴忙喝道：「你要死！仔細回去我好不好先捶了你，然後再回老爺太太，就說寶玉全是你調唆的。我這裏好容易勸哄好了一半了，你又來生個新法子。你鬧了學堂，不說變法兒壓息了纔是，倒要往大裏鬧！」茗煙方不敢作聲兒了。,"Mingyan said from the window: ""He is the nephew of Grandma Huang in Donghutong Zili. What kind of stubborn person is that, and come to bluff us. Grandma Huang is his girl. Your aunt can only spin a mill. , give our grandma Lian on her knees and take the lead. In my eyes, I despise a master grandma like him!"" Li Gui hurriedly stopped drinking and said, ""You puppy know that there are maggots chewing!"" Baoyu sneered. ""I only think of someone's relative, it turns out to be Sister Huang's nephew, I'll go and ask him!"" As he spoke, he was about to leave, and asked Mingyan to come in and pack a book. Ming Yan wrote a book, and said proudly: ""I don't have to go to see him myself. When I get to his house, I say that the old lady has something to ask him, and hire a car to pull it in and ask him in front of the old lady, isn't it? Don't worry."" Li Gui hurriedly shouted, ""You're going to die! Go back carefully, I'll beat you first, and then go back to the old lady, saying that Baoyu was all instigated by you. I've managed to persuade half of it here, you Here comes a new method. You made a mess in the school, not to mention that the reforms have suppressed the interest, but you have to make trouble!"" Ming Yanfang did not dare to make a sound.","“He’s the nephew of Mrs. Huang, of the Eastern mansion,” interposed Ming Yen from outside the window. “What a determined and self-confident fellow he must be to even come and bully us; Mrs. Huang is his paternal aunt! That mother of yours is only good for tossing about like a millstone, for kneeling before our lady Lien, and begging for something to pawn. I’ve no eye for such a specimen of mistress.” “What!” speedily shouted Li Kuei, “does this son of a dog happen to know of the existence of all these gnawing maggots?” (these disparaging facts). Pao-yue gave a sardonic smile. “I was wondering whose relative he was,” he remarked; “is he really sister-in-law Huang’s nephew? well, I’ll go at once and speak to her.” As he uttered these words, his purpose was to start there and then, and he called Ming Yen in, to come and pack up his books. Ming Yen walked in and put the books away. “Master,” he went on to suggest, in an exultant manner, “there’s no need for you to go yourself to see her; I’ll go to her house and tell her that our old lady has something to ask of her. I can hire a carriage to bring her over, and then, in the presence of her venerable ladyship, she can be spoken to; and won’t this way save a lot of trouble?” “Do you want to die?” speedily shouted Li Kuei; “mind, when you go back, whether right or wrong, I’ll first give you a good bumping, and then go and report you to our master and mistress, and just tell them that it’s you, and only you, who instigated Mr. Pao-yue! I’ve succeeded, after ever so much trouble, in coaxing them, and mending matters to a certain extent, and now you come again to continue a new plan. It’s you who stirred up this row in the school-room; and not to speak of your finding, as would have been the proper course, some way of suppressing it, there you are instead still jumping into the fire.” Ming Yen, at this juncture, could not muster the courage to utter a sound.","Tealeaf’s voice piped up from outside the window: ‘He’s the nephew of Mrs Huang on the Ning-guo side. Trash like that trying to scare us! I know your Auntie Huang, Jokey Jin ! She’s an old scrounger. I’ve seen her down on her knees in front of our Mrs Lian, begging for stuff so that she could go out and pawn it. What an aunt! I’d be ashamed to own an aunt like that!’ Li Gui shouted at him furiously. ‘Detestable little varmint ! Trust you to know the answer and spread your poison!’ Bao-yu sniffed contemptuously. ‘So that’s who he is! The nephew of Cousin Huang’s wife. I’ll go and speak to her about this.’ He wanted to go straight away, and called to Tealeaf to come inside and pack up his books. ‘No need for you to go, Master Bao,’ said Tealeaf as he swaggered in triumphantly to do his bidding. ‘Let me go for you and save you the trouble. I’ll just say that Lady Jia wants a word with her, hire a carriage, and bring her along myself. Then you can question her in front of Lady Jia.’ Li Gui was furious. ‘Do you want to die? If you’re not careful, my lad, when we get home I’ll first thrash the living daylights out of you and then tell Sir Zheng and Lady Wang that Master Bao was put up to all this by your provocation. I’ve had trouble enough as it is trying to get these lads calmed down a bit without needing any fresh trouble from you. It was all of your making, this rumpus, in the first place. But instead of thinking about ways of damping it down, you have to go throwing more fat on the fire.’ After this outburst Tealeaf was at last silent."
正樓曰「大觀樓」，東面飛樓曰「綴錦閣」，西面斜樓曰「含芳閣」；更有「蓼風軒」、「藕香榭」、「紫菱洲」、「荇葉渚」等名；又有四字的匾額十數個，諸如「梨花春雨」、「桐剪秋風」、「獲蘆夜雪」等名，此時悉難全記。又命舊有匾聯俱不必摘去。於是先題一絕云：「銜山抱水建來精，多少工夫築始成。天上人間諸景備，芳園應錫大觀名。」,"The main building is called ""Daguan Building"", the flying building in the east is called ""Zuijin Pavilion"", and the inclined building in the west is called ""Hanfang Pavilion""; There are more than a dozen four-character plaques, such as ""Pear Flower Spring Rain"", ""Tongjian Qiufeng"", ""Huo Lu Ye Xue"" and other names, all of which are difficult to remember at this time. He also ordered that the old plaques should not be removed. So the first question is: ""Holding mountains and holding water to build fine, how much time does it take to build it. All the scenery in the sky and the world are prepared, and Fangyuan should be named after the Great View of Xi.""","The lofty tower facing the east, she designated “the variegated and flowery Hall;” bestowing on the line of buildings, facing the west, the appellation of “the Hall of Occult Fragrance;” and besides these figured such further names as: “the Hall of peppery wind,” “the Arbour of lotus fragrance,” “the Islet of purple caltrop,” “the Bank of golden lotus,” and the like. There were also tablets with four characters such as: “the peach blossom and the vernal rain;” “the autumnal wind prunes the Eloecocca,” “the artemisia leaves and the night snow,” and other similar names which could not all be placed on record. She furthermore directed that such tablets as were already put up, should not be dismounted, and she forthwith took the lead and composed an heptameter stanza, the burden of which was: Hills it enclasps, embraces streams, with skill it is laid out: What task the grounds to raise! the works to start and bring about! Of scenery in heaven and amongst men store has been made; The name Broad Vista o’er the fragrant park should be engraved.","She also composed inscriptions for some of its prospects, including ‘Pear-tree blossom in springtime rain’, ‘Paulownia leaves in autumn wind’, and ‘Rushes in the winter snow’. The couplets composed by Bao-yu were to remain unaltered. Having finished with the inscriptions, she proceeded to write out the following quatrain of her own composition: Embracing hills and streams, with skill they wrought: Their work at last is to perfection brought. Earth’s fairest prospects all are here installed, So ‘Prospect Garden’ let its name be called !"
如今且說寶玉打發了賈蕓去後，意思懶懶的歪在床上，似有朦朧之態。襲人便走上來，坐在床沿上推他，說道：「怎麼又要睡覺？悶的很，你出去逛逛不是？」寶玉見說，便拉他的手笑道：「我要去，衹是捨不得你。」襲人笑道：「快起來罷！」一面說，一面拉了寶玉起來。寶玉道：「可往那去呢？怪膩膩煩煩的。」襲人道：「你出去了就好了。只管這麼葳蕤，越發心裏煩膩。」,"Now, let's say that after Baoyu sent Jia Yun to go, she leaned on the bed lazily, as if hazy. Xiren walked up, sat on the edge of the bed, pushed him, and said, ""Why are you going to sleep again? It's very boring, aren't you going out for a walk?"" Baoyu took his hand and smiled and said, ""I'm going, only I miss you."" Xiren laughed and said, ""Get up quickly!"" As he said that, he pulled Baoyu up. Baoyu said, ""Where can we go? It's so boring and annoying."" Xiren said, ""You'll be fine when you go out. No matter how healthy you are, the more you feel tired.""","After dismissing Chia Yuen, he lay in such complete listlessness on the bed that he betrayed every sign of being half asleep. Hsi Jen walked up to him, and seated herself on the edge of the bed, and pushing him, “What are you about to go to sleep again,” she said. “Would it not do your languid spirits good if you went out for a bit of a stroll?” Upon hearing her voice, Pao-yue grasped her hand in his. “I would like to go out,” he smiled, “but I can’t reconcile myself to the separation from you!” “Get up at once!” laughed Hsi Jen. And as she uttered these words, she pulled Pao-yue up. “Where can I go?” exclaimed Pao-yue. “I’m quite surfeited with everything.” “Once out you’ll be all right,” Hsi Jen answered, “but if you simply give way to this languor, you’ll be more than ever sick of everything at heart.”","∗ Our narrative returns now to Bao-yu. After disposing of Jia Yun, Bao-yu continued to feel extremely lethargic and lay back on the bed with every appearance of being about to doze off to sleep. Aroma hurried over to him and, sitting on the edge of the bed, roused him with a shake: ‘Come on! Surely you are not going to sleep again? You need some fresh air. Why don’t you go outside and walk around for a bit?’ Bao-yu took her by the hand and smiled at her. ‘I’d like to go,’ he said, ‘but I don’t want to leave you.’ ‘Silly!’ said Aroma with a laugh. ‘Don’t say what you don’t mean!’ She hoicked him to his feet. ‘Well, where am I going to go then?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I just feel so bored.’ ‘Never mind where, just go out!’ said Aroma. ‘If you stay moping indoors like this, you’ll get even more bored.’"
第十五回,fifteenth time,CHAPTER XV.,Chapter 15
趙嬤嬤道：「噯喲喲，那可是千載希逢的！那時候我纔記事兒，咱們賈府正在姑蘇揚州一帶監造海舫，修理海塘，只預備接駕一次，把銀子都花的淌海水似的！說起來——」鳳姐忙接道：「我們王府也預備過一次。那時我爺爺單管各國進貢朝賀的事，凡有的外國人來，都是我們家養活。粵、閩、滇、浙所有的洋船貨物都是我們家的。」,"Mammy Zhao said: ""Yo yo, that's a once in a lifetime opportunity! At that time, I just remembered that our Jia mansion was supervising the construction of sea boats and repairing sea ponds in the area of Yangzhou, Suzhou, and we were only going to pick them up once and spend all the money. It's like a rush of water! Speaking of which—"" Sister Feng hurriedly replied, ""Our palace also prepared it once. At that time, my grandfather was solely in charge of paying tribute to various countries, and any foreigners who came would be supported by our family. , Fujian, Yunnan, and Zhejiang, all foreign ships and cargo belong to our family.”","“Ai ya, ya!” ejaculated dame Chao, “such a thing is rarely met with in a thousand years! I was old enough at that time to remember the occurrence! Our Chia family was then at Ku Su, Yangchow and all along that line, superintending the construction of ocean vessels, and the repairs to the seaboard. This was the only time in which preparations were made for the reception of the Emperor, and money was lavished in quantities as great as the billowing waters of the sea!” This subject once introduced, lady Feng took up the thread of the conversation with vehemence. “Our Wang family,” she said, “did also make preparations on one occasion. At that time my grandfather was in sole charge of all matters connected with tribute from various states, as well as with general levees, so that whenever any foreigners arrived, they all came to our house to be entertained, while the whole of the goods, brought by foreign vessels from the two Kuang provinces, from Fukien, Yunnan and Chekiang, were the property of our family.”","’s Southern Progress is better than listening to a story-teller. How I wish I’d been there to see it all!’ ‘Ah, now!’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘ That’s the sort of thing that scarce comes once in a thousand years! I was not so young then that I can’t still remember. The head of the Jia family in those days was Superintendant of Shipyards and Harbour Maint’nance in the Soochow-Yangchow area and was chosen to receive the Emperor on one of his visits. The way they spent silver on that visit, why, it was like pouring out salt sea water! I call to mind…’ Xi-feng in her eagerness cut her short: ‘We Wangs received the Emperor on one of his visits, too. At that time my grandfather was in charge of all the foreign tribute and the embassies going up to Court. Whenever any foreigners arrived, it was aiways my family that put them up. All the goods brought by the foreign ships to the seaports in Kwangtung, Fukien, Yunnan and Chekiang passed through our hands.’"
如今且說寶玉因被襲人找回房去，果見鴛鴦歪在床上看襲人的針線呢，見寶玉來了，便說道：「你往那裏去了？老太太等著你呢，叫你過那邊請大老爺的安去。還不快換了衣服走呢。」襲人便進房去取衣服。寶玉坐在床沿上，褪了鞋等靴子穿的工夫，回頭見鴛鴦穿著水紅綾子襖兒，青緞子背心，束著白縐綢汗巾兒，臉向那邊低著頭看針線，脖子上戴著紮花領子。寶玉便把臉湊在他脖項上，聞那香油氣，不住用手摩挲，其白膩不在襲人之下，便猴上身去涎皮笑道：「好姐姐，把你嘴上的胭脂賞我喫了罷。」一面說著，一面扭股糖似的粘在身上。鴛鴦便叫道：「襲人，你出來瞧瞧。你跟了他一輩子，也不勸勸，還是這麼著。」襲人抱了衣服出來，向寶玉道：「左勸也不改，右勸也不改，你到底是怎麼樣？你再這麼著，這個地方可就難住了。」一邊說，一邊催他穿了衣服，同鴛鴦往前面來見賈母。,"Now, let's talk about Baoyu's return to the room because he was attacked. He saw the mandarin duck lying on the bed looking at the needles and threads of the attack. When he saw Baoyu coming, he said, ""Where are you going? The old lady is waiting for you and told you to come over. Please go over there, Mr. An. Change your clothes and leave soon."" Xiren went into the room to get his clothes. Baoyu sat on the edge of the bed, took off his shoes and waited to put on his boots, and when he looked back, he saw that Yuanyang was wearing a red silk jacket, a green satin vest, and a white crepe sweater. Wearing a floral collar. Baoyu put her face on his neck, smelled the scented oil, and kept rubbing it with her hands. The white greasy was not underwhelming, so she lifted her body and smiled, ""Good sister, put the rouge on your mouth. Treat me to eat."" As he spoke, he stuck to his body like a twist of candy. Yuanyang called out, ""Xiren, come out and take a look. You've been with him all your life, and you won't persuade him. You still do."" Xiren came out with his clothes in his arms, and said to Baoyu, ""If you persuade him left, you won't change, but persuade you right. If you don't change, what are you doing? If you keep doing this, this place will be difficult."" As he said, he urged him to put on his clothes, and went forward with Yuanyang to see Jia's mother.","But we need not speak of either of them, but return now to Pao-yue. Having been found, and brought back home, by Hsi Jen, he discovered Yuan Yang reclining on the bed, in the act of examining Hsi Jen’s needlework; but when she perceived Pao-yue arrive, she forthwith remarked: “Where have you been? her venerable ladyship is waiting for you to tell you to go over and pay your obeisance to our Senior master, and don’t you still make haste to go and change your clothes and be off !” Hsi Jen at once walked into the room to fetch his clothes, and Pao-yue sat on the edge of the bed, and pushed his shoes off with his toes; and, while waiting for his boots to put them on, he turned round and perceiving that Yuean Yang, who was clad in a light red silk jacket and a green satin waistcoat, and girdled with a white crepe sash, had her face turned the other way, and her head lowered giving her attention to the criticism of the needlework, while round her neck she wore a collar with embroidery, Pao-yue readily pressed his face against the nape of her neck, and as he sniffed the perfume about it, he did not stay his hand from stroking her neck, which in whiteness and smoothness was not below that of Hsi Jen; and as he approached her, “My dear girl,” he said smiling and with a drivelling face, “do let me lick the cosmetic off your mouth!” clinging to her person, as he uttered these words, like twisted sweetmeat. “Hsi Jen!” cried Yuean Yang at once, “come out and see! You’ve been with him a whole lifetime, and don’t you give him any advice; but let him still behave in this fashion!” Whereupon, Hsi Jen walked out, clasping the clothes, and turning to Pao-yue, she observed, “I advise you in this way and it’s no good, I advise you in that way and you don’t mend; and what do you mean to do after all? But if you again behave like this, it will then, in fact, be impossible for me to live any longer in this place!” As she tendered these words of counsel, she urged him to put his clothes on, and, after he had changed, he betook himself, along with Yuan Yang, to the front part of the mansion, and bade good-bye to dowager lady Chia; after which he went outside, where the attendants and horses were all in readiness; but when he was about to mount his steed, he perceived Chia Lien back from his visit and in the act of dismounting; and as the two of them stood face to face, and mutually exchanged some inquiries, they saw some one come round from the side, and say: “My respects to you, uncle Pao-yue!”","Recalled to his own apartment by Aroma, Bao-yu arrived back to find his grandmother’s maid Faithful reclining on the couch examining Aroma’s needlework. ‘Where have you been?’ she said, as soon as she saw him enter. ‘ Her Old Ladyship is waiting for you. She wants you to go next door to see how your Uncle She is getting on. You’d better hurry up and get changed!’ Aroma went into the next room to get his clothes. Bao-yu sat on the edge of the couch and kicked his shoes off. While he was waiting for his boots to come, he turned and scrutinized Faithful. She was wearing a pale strawberry-coloured dress of silk damask, a sleeveless black satin jacket, stockings of eggshell blue, and dark-red embroidered slippers. Her neck, which was towards him as she bent down once more to inspect the needlework, was encircled at its base by a reddish-purple silk scarf. A fascinating neck. He bent down over it to sniff its perfume and stroked it softly with his hand. It was as smooth and white as Aroma’s. With an impish chuckle he threw himself upon her and clung like sticky toffee about her person: ‘Come on, Faithful darling, give us a taste of your lipstick I’ Faithful called out to Aroma in the next room: ‘Aroma, come in and look at this 1 All the years you’ve been with him now – haven’t you managed to cure him yet?’ Aroma came in with her arms full of clothes. ‘I don’t know what’s the matter with you,’ she said to Bao-yu. ‘Heaven knows, I’ve tried hard enough to cure you! If you go on much longer like this, you’re just going to make it impossible to go on living here any longer.’ She hurried him on with his dressing."
賈政答應，起身走至屏前，只見頭一個寫道是：「能使妖魔膽盡摧，身如束帛氣如雷。一聲震得人方恐，回首相看已化灰。」賈政道：「這是炮竹嗄。」寶玉答道：「是。」賈政又看道：「天運人功理不窮，有功無運也難逢。因何鎮日紛紛亂，只為陰陽數不同。」,"Jia Zheng agreed, got up and walked to the screen, only to see the first one wrote: ""It can destroy the courage of the demon, and the body is like a bundle of silk and qi. Zhengdao: ""It's a firecracker."" Baoyu replied, ""Yes."" Jia Zheng also read: ""Tianyun people have a lot of merits, and it's rare to have merits without luck. different.""","But one report rattles, and men are lo! in fear and dread; Transformed to ashes ‘tis what time to see you turn the head. “Is this a cracker?” Chia Cheng inquired. “It is,” Pao-yue assented. Chia Cheng then went on to peruse that of Ying-Ch’un’s, which referred to an article of use: Exhaustless is the principle of heavenly calculations and of human skill; Skill may exist, but without proper practice the result to find hard yet will be! Whence cometh all this mixed confusion on a day so still?","When, alarmed by the sound of my thunderous crash, You look round, I have already turned into ash. An object of amusement. ‘Would that be a firework?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu. Jia Zheng looked again, this time at Ying-chun’s: Man’s works and heaven’s laws I execute. Without heaven’s laws, my workings bear no fruit. Why am I agitated all day long? For fear my calculations may be wrong. A useful object."
原來襲人在家，聽見他母兄要贖他回去，他就說至死也不回去的。又說：「當日原是你們沒飯喫，就剩我還值幾兩銀子，若不叫你們賣，沒有個看著老子娘餓死的理。如今幸而賣到這個地方，喫穿和主子一樣，又不朝打暮罵。況且如今爹雖沒了，你們卻又整理的家成業就，復了元氣。若果然還艱難，把我贖出來，再多掏摸幾個錢，也還罷了，其實又不難了。這會子又贖我作什麼？權當我死了，再不必起贖我的念頭！」因此哭鬧了一陣。,"It turned out that Xiren was at home, and when he heard that his mother and brother wanted to redeem him and go back, he said that he would not go back until he died. He added, ""It was because you didn't have food that day, and I was left with a few taels worth of silver. If you didn't sell it, there would be no reason to watch my mother starve to death. Now I'm fortunate enough to sell it in this place, with the same food and clothing as my master. I don't scold me at night. Besides, now that my father is gone, you have managed to make a fortune and regain your vitality. If it's still difficult, you can redeem me and pay a little more money, that's all. It's not difficult anymore. What are you going to do to redeem me now? When I die, you don't have to think about redeeming me again!"" So she cried for a while.","The fact is that when Hsi Jen had been at home, and she heard her mother and brother express their intention of redeeming her back, she there and then observed that were she even at the point of death, she would not return home. “When in past days,” she had argued, “you had no rice to eat, there remained myself, who was still worth several taels; and hadn’t I urged you to sell me , wouldn’t I have seen both father and mother die of starvation under my very eyes? and you’ve now had the good fortune of selling me into this place, where I’m fed and clothed just like a mistress, and where I’m not beaten by day, nor abused by night! Besides, though now father be no more, you two have anyhow by putting things straight again, so adjusted the family estate that it has resumed its primitive condition. And were you, in fact, still in straitened circumstances, and you could by redeeming me back, make again some more money, that would be well and good; but the truth is that there’s no such need, and what would be the use for you to redeem me at such a time as this? You should temporarily treat me as dead and gone, and shouldn’t again recall any idea of redeeming me!” Having in consequence indulged in a loud fit of crying, her mother and brother resolved, when they perceived her in this determined frame of mind, that for a fact there was no need for her to come out of service.","Now Aroma’s mother and elder brother had spoken earlier that day about their intention of buying her out of service, but Aroma had at once stated that she would never go back home as long as she lived. ‘When you sold me in the first place,’ she said, ‘it was because you had nothing to eat and I was the only thing you had left in the house which was worth a bit of money. I couldn’t have refused to go and watched my own mother and father starve. But now, fortunately, I’ve got a good situation – one in which I’m not beaten and sworn at all day long and where I’m fed and clothed as well as the masters themselves -and the rest of you, in spite of losing Father, have managed to get in the clear again and are as well off now as you’ve ever been. If you were still hard up and wanted to buy me out so that you could raise a bit of money by reselling me, there would be some point in it. But you’re not. What do you want to buy me out for? Why don’t you just pretend that I’m dead, then you won’t need to think about buying me out any more?’ And after that she had had a little cry."
寶玉聽如此說，便嚇得欲退不能退，果覺自形污穢不堪。,"When Baoyu heard this, she was so frightened that she wanted to retreat, and she felt that her body was filthy.","As soon as Pao-yue heard these remarks, he was forthwith plunged in such a state of consternation that he would have retired, but he found it impossible to do so. In fact, he felt the consciousness of the foulness and corruption of his own nature quite intolerable.",At these words Bao-yu was suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of the uncleanness and impurity of his own body and sought in vain for somewhere to escape to; but Disenchantment held him by the hand and advanced towards the fairy maidens with a conciliatory smile.
一時鳳姐進入茅堂，因命寶玉等先出去頑頑。寶玉等會意，因同秦鍾出來，帶著小廝們各處遊頑。凡莊農動用之物，皆不曾見過。寶玉一見了鍬、镢、鋤、犁等物，皆以為奇，不知何項所使，其名為何。小廝在旁一一的告訴了名色，說明原委。寶玉聽了，因點頭嘆道：「怪道古人詩上說，『誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦』，正為此也。」一面說，一面又至一間房前，只見炕上有個紡車，寶玉又問小廝們：「這又是什麼？」小廝們又告訴他原委。寶玉聽說，便上來擰轉作耍，自為有趣。,"For a while, Sister Feng entered the thatched cottage, and ordered Baoyu and others to go out stubbornly first. Baoyu and the others understood, because he came out with Qin Zhong and led the servants around. I have never seen anything used by farmers. When Baoyu saw shovels, shovels, hoes, plows, etc., he was amazed. The little servant told the name and color one by one, explaining the whole story. When Baoyu heard this, he nodded and sighed, ""It's strange that the ancients said in a poem, 'Who knows how hard it is to eat a meal on a plate?' That's why."" Spinning the wheel, Baoyu asked the servants again, ""What is this?"" The servants told him the truth. When Baoyu heard this, he came up and played around, thinking it was fun.","Lady Feng entered a thatched house, and, in the first place, asked Pao-yue and the rest to go out and play. Pao-yue took the hint, and, along with Ch’in Chung, he led off the servant boys and went to romp all over the place. The various articles in use among the farmers they had not seen before, with the result that after Pao-yue had inspected them, he thought them all very strange; but he could neither make out their names nor their uses. But among the servant boys, there were those who knew, and they explained to them, one after another, what they were called, as well as what they were for. As Pao-yue, after this explanation, nodded his head; “It isn’t strange,” he said, “that an old writer has this line in his poetical works, ‘Who can realise that the food in a bowl is, grain by grain, all the fruit of labour.’ This is indeed so!” As he spoke, they had come into another house; and at the sight of a spinning wheel on a stove-bed, they thought it still more strange and wonderful, but the servant boys again told them that it was used for spinning the yarn to weave cloth with, and","As soon as they were inside the thatched central building, Xi-feng asked the boys to amuse themselves outside. Bao-yu realized that she needed to be alone, and conducted Qin Zhong and the pages on a tour of the farmyard. He had never in his life seen any of the farming implements before, and was very curious. One of his pages who had some experience of country matters was able to name each implement for him and explain its functions. Bao-yu was impressed. ‘Now I can understand the words of the old poet,’ he said: ‘Each grain of rice we ever ate Cost someone else a drop of sweat.’ At that moment they came to an outhouse in which was a kang with a spinning-wheel on it. Bao-yu was even more intrigued. ‘That’s for spinning yarn with to make cloth out of,’ said the pages. Bao-yu at once got up on the kang and had just started to turn it when a country lass of seventeen or eighteen summers came running up:"
金氏聽了這半日話，把方纔在他嫂子家的那一團要向秦氏理論的盛氣，早嚇的都丟在爪窪國去了。聽見尤氏問他有知道好大夫的話，連忙答道：「我們這麼聽著，實在也沒見人說有個好大夫。如今聽起大奶奶這個來，定不得還是喜呢。嫂子倒別教人混治。倘或認錯了，這可是了不得的。」尤氏道：「可不是呢。」正是說話間，賈珍從外進來，見了金氏，便向尤氏問道：「這不是璜大奶奶麼？」金氏向前給賈珍請了安。賈珍向尤氏說道：「讓這大妹妹喫了飯去。」賈珍說著話，就過那屋裏去了。金氏此來，原要向秦氏說說秦鍾欺負了他侄兒的事，聽見秦氏有病，不但不能說，亦且不敢提了。況且賈珍尤氏又待的很好，反轉怒為喜，又說了一會子話兒，方家去了。,"After listening to these words for half a day, Mr. Jin threw the group that was just at his sister-in-law's house and wanted to argue with Qin's theory, and left them in Zawa Country. Hearing You Shi asked him what he knew about a good doctor, he quickly replied, ""We've listened to this, but we haven't seen anyone say that there is a good doctor. Now that I hear this, I'm not sure I'm happy. Sister-in-law, don't teach me. People are mixed. If you admit that you are wrong, this is amazing."" You said, ""It's not."" It was during the conversation that Jia Zhen came in from outside, saw Jin, and asked You, ""This is Isn't that Grandma Huang?"" Mrs. Jin went forward and asked Jia Zhen to be safe. Jia Zhen said to You, ""Let this eldest sister go to dinner."" Jia Zhen said, and went to the room. When Mr. Jin came here, he wanted to tell Mrs. Qin that Qin Zhong had bullied his nephew. When he heard that Mrs. Qin was ill, he not only couldn't talk about it, but also didn't dare to mention it. Besides, Jia Zhen You's stay was very good. He turned his anger into joy, and after talking for a while, the Fang family went.","Mrs. Chin had, while listening to these words, been, at an early period, so filled with concern that she cast away to distant lands the reckless rage she had been in recently while at her sister-in-law’s house, when she had determined to go and discuss matters over with Mrs. Ch’in. Upon hearing Mrs. Yu inquire of her about a good doctor, she lost no time in saying by way of reply: “Neither have we heard of any one speak of a good doctor; but from the account I’ve just heard of Mrs. Ch’in’s illness , it may still, there’s no saying, be some felicitous ailment; so, sister-in-law, don’t let any one treat her recklessly, for were she to be treated for the wrong thing, the result may be dreadful!” “Quite so!” replied Mrs. Yu. But while they were talking, Chia Chen came in from out of doors, and upon catching sight of Mrs. Chin; “Isn’t this Mrs. Huang?” he inquired of Mrs. Yu; whereupon Mrs. Chin came forward and paid her respects to Chia Chen. “Invite this lady to have her repast here before she goes,” observed Chia Chen to Mrs. Yu; and as he uttered these words he forthwith walked into the room on the off side. The object of Mrs. Chin’s present visit had originally been to talk to Mrs. Ch’in about the insult which her brother had received from the hands of Ch’in Chung, but when she heard that Mrs. Ch’in was ill, she did not have the courage to even so much as make mention of the object of her errand. Besides, as Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu had given her a most cordial reception, her resentment was transformed into pleasure, so that after a while spent in a further chat about one thing and another, she at length returned to her home. It was only after the departure of Mrs. Chin that Chia Chen came over and took a seat. “What did she have to say for herself during this visit to-day?”","Mrs Huang’s determination to have things out with Qin-shi, of which she had boasted so valiantly at her sister-in-law’s , had, in the course of this outpouring, fled to the far kingdom of Java. She hastened to own that she knew of no good doctor. ‘But hearing what you have said about this illness,’ she added, ‘I can’t help wondering if it may not after all be pregnancy. You want to be careful they don’t give her the wrong treatment. If they give her the wrong treatment for that, there will be real trouble!’ ‘I know,’ said You-shi. ‘ That’s what I say.’ While they were still talking, Cousin Zhen came in from outside. ‘Isn’t this Cousin Huang’s wife?’ he asked You-shi, catching sight of the visitor. Mrs Huang dropped him a curtsey and a ‘how-do-you-do’. ‘You must ask our cousin to dinner,’ he said, going on into the room beyond. The original object of Mrs Huang’s visit had of course been to complain to Qin-shi about Qin Zhong’s treatment of her nephew. Hearing of Qin-shi’s illness she had abandoned all thought of even mentioning the subject; and now that Cousin Zhen and You-shi were being so nice to her, her anger gradually gave way to pleasure, and after gossiping a while longer she went off home."
襲人忙趁眾奶娘丫鬟不在旁時，另取出一件中衣來與寶玉換上。寶玉含羞央告道：「好姐姐，千萬別告訴人。」襲人亦含羞笑問道：「你夢見什麼故事了？是那裏流出來的那些髒東西？」寶玉道：「一言難盡。」說著便把夢中之事細說與襲人聽了。然後說至警幻所授雲雨之情，羞的襲人掩面伏身而笑。寶玉亦素喜襲人柔媚嬌俏，遂強襲人同領警幻所訓雲雨之事。襲人素知賈母已將自己與了寶玉的，今便如此，亦不為越禮，遂和寶玉偷試一番，幸得無人撞見。自此寶玉視襲人更比別個不同，襲人待寶玉更為盡心。暫且別無話說。,"Xiren was busy taking advantage of the absence of the nurses and maids, and took out another tunic to put on with Baoyu. Baoyu shyly said, ""Good sister, don't tell anyone."" Xiren also smiled shyly and asked, ""What story did you dream about? Are those dirty things that flowed out there?"" Then he told the story in detail and listened to him. Then, when talking about the love of cloud and rain given by the police and fantasy, he shyly covered his face and smiled. Baoyu also always likes to be soft and charming, so she attacked the things that Tongling Police Huan taught Yunyu. Xiren knew that Jia's mother had already put herself with Baoyu, and this is how it is now, and it is not out of courtesy, so he secretly tried it with Baoyu, but fortunately no one saw it. Since then, Baoyu's treatment of people has been more different than others, and he has been more dedicated to Baoyu. Don't say anything for now.",", she followed him over to old lady Chia’s apartments; and after a hurry-scurry meal, they came back to this side, and Hsi Jen availed herself of the absence of the nurses and waiting-maids to hand Pao-yue another garment to change. “Please, dear Hsi Jen, don’t tell any one,” entreated Pao-yue, with concealed shame. “What did you dream of ?” inquired Hsi Jen, smiling, as she tried to stifle her blushes, “and whence comes all this perspiration?” “It’s a long story,” said Pao-yue, “which only a few words will not suffice to explain.” He accordingly recounted minutely, for her benefit, the subject of his dream. When he came to where the Fairy had explained to him the mysteries of love, Hsi Jen was overpowered with modesty and covered her face with her hands; and as she bent down, she gave way to a fit of laughter. Pao-yue had always been fond of Hsi Jen, on account of her gentleness, pretty looks and graceful and elegant manner, and he forthwith expounded to her all the mysteries he had been taught by the Fairy. Hsi Jen was, of course, well aware that dowager lady Chia had given her over to Pao-yue, so that her present behaviour was likewise no transgression. And subsequently she secretly attempted with Pao-yue a violent flirtation, and lucky enough no one broke in upon them during their tete-a-tete. From this date, Pao-yue treated Hsi Jen with special regard, far more than he showed to the other girls, while Hsi Jen herself was still more demonstrative in her attentions to Pao-yue. But for a time we will make no further remark about them.","There they bolted a hurried supper and then slipped back to the other house, where Aroma profited from the absence of the nurses and the other maids to take out a clean undergarment for Bao-yu to change into. ‘Please, Aroma,’ Bao-yu shamefacedly entreated as she helped him change, ‘please don’t tell anyone!’ Equally ill at ease, Aroma giggled softly. ‘Why did you…?’ she began to ask. Then, after glancing cautiously around, began again. ‘Where did that stuff come from?’ Bao-yu blushed furiously and said nothing. Aroma stared at him curiously and continued to giggle. After much hesitation he proceeded to give her a detailed account of his dream. But when he came to the part of it in which he made love to Two-in-one, Aroma threw herself forward with a shriek of laughter and buried her face in her hands. Bao-yu had long been attracted by Aroma’s somewhat coquettish charms and tugged at her purposefully, anxious to share with her the lesson he had learned from Disenchantment. Aroma knew that when Grandmother Jia gave her to Bao-yu she had intended her to belong to him in the fullest possible sense, and so, having no good reason for refusing him, she allowed him, after a certain amount of coy resistance, to have his way with her. From then on Bao-yu treated Aroma with even greater consideration than before, whilst Aroma for her part redoubled the devotion with which she served him. But of this, for the time being, no more."
寶釵見問，乃笑道：「不用這方兒還好，若問起這方兒，真真把人瑣碎死了。東西藥料一概都有限，易得的，只難得『可巧』二字：要春天開的白牡丹花蕊十二兩，夏天開的白荷花蕊十二兩，秋天的白芙蓉蕊十二兩，冬天的白梅花蕊十二兩。將這四樣花蕊於次年春分這日曬乾，和在藥末子一處，一齊研好。又要雨水這日的雨水十二錢，——」周瑞家的忙道：「噯喲！這麼說來，這就得三年的工夫。倘或雨水這日竟不下雨，這卻怎處呢？」寶釵笑道：「所以了，那裏有這樣可巧的雨，便沒雨也只好再等罷了。還要白露這日的露水十二錢，霜降這日的霜十二錢，小雪這日的雪十二錢，把這四樣水調勻，和了藥，再加十二錢蜂蜜，十二錢白糖，丸了龍眼大的丸子，盛在舊磁壇內，埋在花根底下。若發了病時，拿出來喫一丸，用十二分黃柏煎湯送下。」,"When Baochai saw the question, he smiled and said, ""It's fine if you don't need this recipe. If you ask about this recipe, it's really trivial to death. All things and medicines are limited, and easy to get, only the word ""coincidence"" is rare. : Twelve taels of white peony stamens blooming in spring, twelve taels of white lotus stamens blooming in summer, twelve taels of white hibiscus stamens in autumn, and twelve taels of white plum stamens in winter. Put these four stamens on the vernal equinox of the following year. Dry it in the sun, and grind it together with the medicine at the end of the seed. You will also need 12 bucks of rainwater on this day—"" Zhou Rui's family hurriedly said, ""Ah! So, it will take three years. If or The rain doesn’t rain on this day, so what’s going on here?” Baochai smiled and said, “So, if there is such a lucky rain there, if it doesn’t rain, we have to wait. We also need to dew the dew on this day for twelve coins. For the 12 coins of Shuang on the day of the frost, and the 12 coins of the snow on the day of Xiaoxue, mix these four kinds of water thoroughly, mix the medicine, add 12 coins of honey, 12 coins of white sugar, and make the balls the size of longan. In the old magnetic altar, it is buried under the flower roots. If you are sick, take a pill out and send it with 12-cent phellodendron decoction.”","“You’d better not ask for the prescription,” rejoined Pao Ch’ai smiling. “Why, its enough to wear one out with perplexity! the necessaries and ingredients are few, and all easy to get, but it would be difficult to find the lucky moment! You want twelve ounces of the pollen of the white peone, which flowers in spring, twelve ounces of the pollen of the white summer lily, twelve ounces of the pollen of the autumn hibiscus flower, and twelve ounces of the white plum in bloom in the winter. You take the four kinds of pollen, and put them in the sun, on the very day of the vernal equinox of the succeeding year to get dry, and then you mix them with the powder and pound them well together. You again want twelve mace of water, fallen on ‘rain water’ day.....” “Good gracious!” exclaimed Mrs. Chou promptly, as she laughed. “From all you say, why you want three years’ time! and what if no rain falls on ‘rain water’ day! What would one then do?” “Quite so!” Pao Ch’ai remarked smilingly; “how can there be such an opportune rain on that very day! but to wait is also the best thing , there’s nothing else to be done. Besides, you want twelve mace of dew, collected on ‘White Dew’ day, and twelve mace of the hoar frost, gathered on ‘Frost Descent’ day, and twelve mace of snow, fallen on ‘Slight Snow’ day! You next take these four kinds of waters and mix them with the other ingredients, and make pills of the size of a lungngan. You keep them in an old porcelain jar, and bury them under the roots of some flowers; and when the ailment betrays itself, you produce it and take a pill, washing it down with two candareens of a yellow cedar decoction.”","‘You don’t know what you are asking,’ said Bao-chai. ‘It’s such a finicky prescription, it would drive anyone mad trying to make it up. It’s not so much the materials. There is, after all, a limit to the number of drugs from one part of the world or another that are available. It’s the timing involved that is so difficult. ‘You have to take twelve ounces of stamens of the spring-flowering white tree-peony, twelve ounces of stamens of the summer-flowering white water-lily, twelve ounces of stamens of the autumn-flowering white lotus, and twelve ounces of stamens of the winter-flowering white plum and dry them all in the sun on the day of the spring equinox of the year immediately following the year you picked them in. Then you have to mix them with the powder I told you about and pound them all up together in a mortar. Then you must take twelve drams of rain water that fell on the Rain Days in the second month…’ Zhou Rui’s wife laughed. ‘Why, that’s already three years it would take! And suppose it didn’t rain that year on the Rain Days ?’ ‘Exactly,’ said Bao-chai. ‘ Rain is seldom so obliging. You would just have to wait till the next year. Then you have to collect twelve drams of dew on the day White Dew in the ninth month, twelve drams of frost at Frost Fall in the tenth, and twelve drams of snow at Lesser Snow in the last month of the year, stir these four kinds of water into the mixture, make it up into pills about the size of a longan, and store the pills in an old porcelain jar. The jar is supposed to be buried in a flower bed and only dug up when you have an attack of the illness. Then one of the pills is taken out and swallowed in hot water into which one and a quarter drams of tincture of phellodendron has been stirred.’"
當下秦氏引了一簇人來至上房內間。寶玉抬頭看見一幅畫貼在上面，畫的人物固好，其故事乃是《燃藜圖》。也不看係何人所畫，心中便有些不快。又有一副對聯，寫的是：「世事洞明皆學問，人情練達即文章。」及看了這兩句，縱然室宇精美，鋪陳華麗，亦斷斷不肯在這裏了，忙說：「快出去！快出去！」秦氏聽了笑道：「這裏還不好，可往那裏去呢？不然往我屋裏去吧。」寶玉點頭微笑。有一個嬤嬤說道：「那裏有個叔叔往侄兒房裏睡覺的理？」秦氏笑道：「噯喲喲，不怕他惱。他能多大呢，就忌諱這些個！上月你沒看見我那個兄弟來了，雖然與寶叔同年，兩個人若站在一處，只怕那個還高些呢。」寶玉道：「我怎麼沒見過？你帶他來我瞧瞧。」眾人笑道：「隔著二三十里，往那裏帶去，見的日子有呢。」說著大家來至秦氏房中。剛至房門，便有一股細細的甜香襲人而來。寶玉覺得眼餳骨軟，連說「好香！」入房向壁上看時，有唐伯虎畫的《海棠春睡圖》，兩邊有宋學士秦太虛寫的一副對聯，其聯云：「嫩寒鎖夢因春冷，芳氣襲人是酒香。」,"At the moment, the Qin family led a group of people to the upper room. Baoyu looked up and saw a painting attached to it. The characters in the painting were solid, and the story was ""The Burning Quinoa Picture"". Regardless of who painted it, I felt a little unhappy in my heart. There is another couplet, which reads: ""Everything in the world is well-informed and knowledgeable, and a person who is skilled is an essay."" And after reading these two sentences, even though the room is beautiful and the layout is gorgeous, he will never be here, and he hastily said: ""Quickly. Get out! Quickly get out!"" Qin shi smiled and said, ""It's not good here, but where should we go? Otherwise, go to my room."" Baoyu nodded and smiled. A grandma said, ""There's a reason for an uncle to sleep in his nephew's room?"" Qin Shi smiled and said, ""Oh, I'm not afraid of him being annoyed. How old can he be, so taboo these people! You didn't see them last month. My brother is here, even though he was the same year as Uncle Bao, if the two of them were standing together, I'm afraid that one would be taller."" Baoyu said, ""Why haven't I seen him? You bring him to see me."" Everyone He smiled and said, ""Twenty or thirty miles away, take it there and see you there."" After speaking, everyone came to Qin's room. As soon as he arrived at the door, there was a thin sweet fragrance coming. Baoyu felt that her eyes were soft and her bones were soft, and she even said, ""It's so fragrant!"" When she entered the room and looked on the wall, there was a painting of ""Begonia Sleeping in Spring"" by Tang Bohu, and a couplet written by Song scholar Qin Taixu on both sides. The couplet said: ""Nenhansuomeng is due to the cold spring, and the fragrance is like the fragrance of wine.""","Mrs. Ch’in, there and then, led away a company of attendants, and came into the rooms inside the drawing room. Pao-yue, upon raising his head, and catching sight of a picture hung on the upper wall, representing a human figure, in perfect style, the subject of which was a portrait of Yen Li, speedily felt his heart sink within him. There was also a pair of scrolls, the text of which was: A thorough insight into worldly matters arises from knowledge; A clear perception of human nature emanates from literary lore. On perusal of these two sentences, albeit the room was sumptuous and beautifully laid out, he would on no account remain in it. “Let us go at once,” he hastened to observe, “let us go at once.” Mrs. Ch’in upon hearing his objections smiled. “If this,” she said, “is really not nice, where are you going? if you won’t remain here, well then come into my room.” Pao-yue nodded his head and gave a faint grin. “Where do you find the propriety,” a nurse thereupon interposed, “of an uncle going to sleep in the room of a nephew’s wife?” “Ai ya!” exclaimed Mrs. Ch’in laughing , “I don’t mind whether he gets angry or not (at what I say); but how old can he be as to reverentially shun all these things? Why my brother was with me here last month; didn’t you see him? he’s, true enough, of the same age as uncle Pao, but were the two of them to stand side by side, I suspect that he would be much higher in stature.” “How is it,” asked Pao-yue, “that I didn’t see him? Bring him along and let me have a look at him!” “He’s separated,” they all ventured as they laughed, “by a distance of twenty or thirty li, and how can he be brought along? but you’ll see him some day.” As they were talking, they reached the interior of Mrs. Ch’in’s apartments. As soon as they got in, a very faint puff of sweet fragrance was wafted into their nostrils. Pao-yue readily felt his eyes itch and his bones grow weak. “What a fine smell!” he exclaimed several consecutive times. Upon entering the apartments, and gazing at the partition wall, he saw a picture the handiwork of T’ang Po-hu, consisting of Begonias drooping in the spring time; on either side of which was one of a pair of scrolls, written by Ch’in Tai-hsue, a Literary Chancellor of the Sung era, running as follows: A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man, because the spring is cold. The fragrant whiff, which wafts itself into man’s nose, is the perfume of wine!","Qin-shi conducted Bao-yu and his little knot of attendants to an inner room in the main building. As they entered, Bao-yu glanced up and saw a painting hanging above them on the opposite wall. The figures in it were very finely executed. They represented Scholarly Diligence in the person of the Han philosopher Liu Xiang at his book, obligingly illuminated for him by a supernatural being holding a large flaming torch. Bao-yu found the painting – or rather its subject – distasteful. But the pair of mottoes which flanked it proved the last straw: True learning implies a clear insight into human activities. Genuine culture involves the skilful manipulation of human relationships. In vain the elegant beauty and splendid furnishings of the room I Qin-shi was given to understand in no uncertain terms that her uncle Bao-yu wished to be out of it at once. ‘If this is not good enough for you,’ said Qin-shi with a laugh, ‘where are we going to put you? – unless you would like to have your rest in my bedroom.’ A little smile played over Bao-yu’s face and he nodded. The nurses were shocked. ‘An uncle sleep in the bedroom of his nephew’s wife! Who ever heard of such a thing ’ Qin-shi laughed again. ‘He won’t misbehave. Good gracious, he’s only a little boyl We don’t have to worry about that sort of thing yet! You know my little brother who came last month: he’s the same age as Uncle Bao, but if you stood them side by side I shouldn’t be a bit surprised if he wasn’t the taller of the two.’ ‘Why haven’t I seen your brother yet?’ Bao-yu demanded. ‘Bring him in and let me have a look at him!’ The servants all laughed. ‘Bring him in? Why, he’s ten or twenty miles away! But I expect you’ll meet him one of these days.’ In the course of this exchange the party had made its way to Qin-shi’s bedroom. As Bao-yu entered, a subtle whiff of the most delicious perfume assailed his nostrils, making a sweet stickiness inside his drooping eyelids and causing all the joints in his body to dissolve. ‘What a lovely smell!’ He repeated the words several times over. Inside the room there was a painting by Tang Yin entitled ‘Spring Slumber’ depicting a beautiful woman asleep under a crab-apple tree, whose buds had not yet opened. The painting was flanked on either side by a pair of calligraphic scrolls inscribed with a couplet from the brush of the Song poet Qin Guan: (on one side) The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream; (on the other side) The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents."

轉過大廳，寶玉心裏還自狐疑，只聽牆角邊一陣呵呵大笑，回頭只見薛蟠拍著手笑了出來，笑道：「要不說姨夫叫你，你那裏出來的這麼快。」焙茗也笑道：「爺別怪我。」忙跪下了。寶玉怔了半天，方解過來了，是薛蟠哄他出來。薛蟠連忙打恭作揖陪不是，又求「不要難為了小子，都是我逼他去的。」寶玉也無法了，只好笑問道：「你哄我也罷了，怎麼說我父親呢？我告訴姨娘去，評評這個理，可使得麼？」薛蟠忙道：「好兄弟，我原為求你快些出來，就忘了忌諱這句話。改日你也哄我，說我的父親就完了。」寶玉道：「噯，噯，越發該死了。」又向焙茗道：「反叛肏的，還跪著作什麼！」焙茗連忙叩頭起來。,"Turning around the hall, Baoyu was still suspicious. He heard a burst of laughter from the corner. When he turned around, he saw Xue Pan clapping his hands and laughing. He said with a smile, ""If my uncle called you, you came out so fast."" He smiled and said, ""Don't blame me."" He hurriedly knelt down. Baoyu was stunned for a long time, then Fang Jie came over, and it was Xue Pan who coaxed him out. Xue Pan hurriedly greeted me with a bow, and begged, ""Don't be hard on the kid, I forced him to go."" Tell your concubine to go and comment on this principle, can you make it work?"" Xue Pan hurriedly said: ""My dear brother, I forgot to ask you to come out soon, so I forgot to say that you are taboo. Another day you will coax me and say mine. Father is finished."" Baoyu said, ""Ah, ah, it's getting worse."" Then he said to Beiming, ""What are you doing on your knees and writing!"" Beiming hurriedly kowtowed.","This said, he urged Pao-yue on, and together they turned past the large pavilion. Pao-yue was, however, still labouring under suspicion, when he heard, from the corner of the wall, a loud outburst of laughter. Upon turning his head round, he caught sight of Hsueeh P’an jump out, clapping his hands. “Hadn’t I said that my uncle wanted you?” he laughed. “Would you ever have rushed out with such alacrity?” Pei Ming also laughed, and fell on his knees. But Pao-yue remained for a long time under the spell of utter astonishment, before he, at length, realised that it was Hsueeh P’au who had inveigled him to come out. Hsueeh P’an hastily made a salutation and a curtsey, and confessed his fault. He next gave way to entreaties, saying: “Don’t punish the young servant, for it is simply I who begged him go.” Pao-yue too had then no other alternative but to smile. “I don’t mind your playing your larks on me; but why,” he inquired, “did you mention my father? Were I to go and tell my aunt, your mother, to see to the rights and the wrongs of the case, how would you like it?” “My dear cousin,” remarked Hsueeh P’an vehemently, “the primary idea I had in view was to ask you to come out a moment sooner and I forgot to respectfully shun the expression. But by and bye, when you wish to chaff me, just you likewise allude to my father, and we’ll thus be square.” “Ai-ya!” exclaimed Pao-yue. “You do more than ever deserve death!!” Then turning again towards Pei Ming, “You ruffian!” he said, “what are you still kneeling for?” Pei Ming began to bump his head on the ground with vehemence.","Bao-yu stood there looking puzzled. It was some moments before it dawned on him that he had been hoaxed. Xue Pan was by this time being apologetic – bowing repeatedly and pumping his hands to show how sorry he was: ‘Don’t blame the lad!’ he said. ‘It wasn’t his fault. I talked him into it.’ Bao-yu saw that he could do nothing, and might as well accept with a good grace. ‘I don’t mind being made a fool of,’ he said, ‘but I think it was going a bit far to bring my father into it. I think perhaps I’d better tell Aunt Xue and see what she thinks about it all.’ ‘Now look here, old chap,’ said Xue Pan, getting agitated, ‘it was only because I wanted to fetch you out a bit quicker. I admit it was very wrong of me to make free with your Parent, but after all, you’ve only got to mention my father next time you want to fool me and we’ll be quits!’ ‘Aiyo!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Worse and worse!’ He turned to Tealeaf: ‘Treacherous little beast! What are you still kneeling for?’ Tealeaf kotowed and rose to his feet."
過了一日，就有寶玉寄名的乾娘馬道婆進榮國府來請安。見了寶玉，唬一大跳，問起原由，說是燙的，便點頭嘆息一回，向寶玉臉上用指頭畫了一畫，口內嘟嘟嚷嚷的又持誦了一回，說道：「管保就好了，這不過是一時飛災。」又向賈母道：「祖宗老菩薩那裏知道，那經典佛法上說的利害，大凡那王公卿相人家的子弟，只一生長下來，暗裏便有許多促狹鬼跟著他，得空便擰他一下，或掐他一下，或喫飯時打下他的飯碗來，或走著推他一跤，所以往往的那些大家子孫多有長不大的。」,"A day later, the godmother Ma Daopo, who had been sent by Baoyu's name, entered the Rongguo Mansion to greet him. Seeing Baoyu, he jumped in shock, asked the reason, and said that it was hot, then nodded and sighed, drew a finger on Baoyu's face, and recited it again, muttering in his mouth, saying: ""Just take care of it, it's just a temporary disaster."" He said to Mother Jia, ""The ancestors, the old Bodhisattva, knew that the benefits and harms stated in the classic Buddhist teachings, the children of the princes, princes, and ministers, only grow up and secretly There were many stalkers who followed him, pinching him or pinching him when they were free, or laying down his job while eating, or pushing him while walking. ""","A day after, Ma, a Taoist matron, whose name was recorded as Pao-yue’s godmother, came on a visit to the mansion. Upon perceiving Pao-yue, she was very much taken aback, and asked all about the circumstances of the accident. When he explained that he had been scalded, she forthwith shook her head and heaved a sigh; then while making with her fingers a few passes over Pao-yue’s face, she went on to mutter incantations for several minutes. “I can guarantee that he’ll get all right,” she added, “for this is simply a sadden and fleeting accident!” Turning towards dowager lady Chia: “Venerable ancestor,” she observed, “Venerable Buddha! how could you ever be aware of the existence of the portentous passage in that Buddhistic classic, ‘to the effect that a son of every person, who holds the dignity of prince, duke or high functionary, has no sooner come into the world and reached a certain age than numerous evil spirits at once secretly haunt him, and pinch him, when they find an opportunity; or dig their nails into him; or knock his bowl of rice down, during, meal-time; or give him a shove and send him over, while he is quietly seated.’ So this is the reason why the majority of the sons and grandsons of those distinguished families do not grow up to attain manhood.”","‘Bless you, my lucky lady! Bless you dearie! You don’t know a half of the unseen harms and dangers the Scripture tells us of. All the sons of princes and great folks the moment they begin to grow up are followed round everywhere they go by troops of invisible little imps – spiteful little creatures who nip them and pinch them whenever they can. Sometimes they knock the ricebowl from their hands when they’re eating. Sometimes they push them over when they are walking. It’s on account of these creatures that so many young gentlemen of good family don’t live to make old bones.’ Grandmother Jia was anxious to know if the afflicted person could be freed from these unwelcome attentions."
趙姨娘問道：「前日我送了五百錢去，在藥王跟前上供，你可收了沒有？」馬道婆道：「早已替你上了供了。」趙姨娘嘆口氣道：「阿彌陀佛！我手裏但凡從容些，也時常的上個供，衹是心有餘力量不足。」馬道婆道：「你只管放心，將來熬的環哥兒大了，得個一官半職，那時你要作多大的功德不能？」趙姨娘聽說，鼻子裏笑了一聲，說道：「罷，罷，再別說起。如今就是個樣兒，我們娘兒們跟的上這屋裏那一個兒！也不是有了寶玉，竟是得了活龍。他還是小孩子家，長的得人意兒，大人偏疼他些也還罷了；我只不伏這個主兒。」一面說，一面伸出兩個指頭兒來。馬道婆會意，便問道：「可是璉二奶奶？」趙姨娘唬的忙搖手兒，走到門前，掀簾子向外看看無人，方進來向馬道婆悄悄說道：「了不得，了不得！提起這個主兒來，真正把人氣殺，叫人一言難盡。我白和你打個賭兒，這一分傢俬要不都叫他搬送到娘家去，我也不是個人。」,"Concubine Zhao asked, ""The day before yesterday, I sent 500 coins to the King of Medicine to make offerings. Did you accept them?"" Ma Daopo said, ""I already made offerings for you."" Concubine Zhao sighed and said, "" Amitabha! I always make offerings more calmly in my hands, but I have more than enough strength in my heart."" Ma Daopo said, ""Just don't worry, in the future, brother Huan will get older and get a half-official position, then How much merit do you have to do?"" When Concubine Zhao heard it, she smiled and said, ""No, no, don't talk about it anymore. It's like this now, our girls follow the one in this room. Son! It's not because of Baoyu, but a living dragon. He's still a child, and he's good-looking, but it's okay for adults to love him a little bit; I just don't want this master."" Come with two fingers. Daopo Ma understood, and asked, ""But second grandma Lian?"" Concubine Zhao waved her hands hurriedly, walked to the door, lifted the curtain and looked out at no one, and Fang came in and whispered to Daopo Ma, ""It's amazing, it's amazing! Speaking of this master, it really kills people's popularity, and it's hard to say. I'll make a bet with you, if I ask him to move to his mother's house, I'm not a person. ""","“The other day,” Mrs. Chao went on to inquire, “I sent a servant over with five hundred cash; have you presented any offerings before the god of medicine or not?” “I’ve offered them long ago for you,” the Taoist matron Ma rejoined. “O-mi-to-fu!” ejaculated Mrs. Chao with a sigh, “were I a little better off , I’d also come often and offer gifts; but though my will be boundless, my means are insufficient!” “Don’t trouble your mind on this score,” suggested Ma, the Taoist matron. “By and bye, when Mr. Huan has grown up into a man and obtained some official post or other, will there be then any fear of your not being able to afford such offerings as you might like to make?” At these words Mrs. Chao gave a smile. “Enough, enough!” she cried. “Don’t again refer to such contingencies! the present is a fair criterion. For up to whom in this house can my son and I come? Pao-yue is still a mere child; but he is such that he wins people’s love. Those big people may be partial to him, and love him a good deal, I’ve nothing to say to it; but I can’t eat humble pie to this sort of mistress!” While uttering this remark, she stretched out her two fingers. Ma, the Taoist matron, understood the meaning she desired to convey. “It’s your lady Secunda, Lien, eh?” she forthwith asked. Mrs. Chao was filled with trepidation. Hastily waving her hand, she got to her feet, raised the portiere, and peeped outside. Perceiving that there was no one about, she at length retraced her footsteps. “Dreadful!” she then said to the Taoist matron. “Dreadful! But speaking of this sort of mistress, I’m not so much as a human being, if she doesn’t manage to shift over into her mother’s home the whole of this family estate.”","‘I sent someone round to you the other day with five hundred cash to pay for an offering to the Medicine Buddha,’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘Have you managed to make it yet?’ ‘Oh yes. That was done days ago.’ ‘Holy Name!’ said Aunt Zhao. ‘I’d do it oftener if things were a bit easier; but you know the saying: “my heart is willing but my purse is lean”.’ ‘Don’t you worry about that!’ said Mother Ma. ‘You only have to hold out a few more years. When your Huan has grown up and got himself a job in the Service, you’ll be able to afford all the good works you want.’ Aunt Zhao made a scornful sound in her nose: ‘Hfn! Let’s not talk about it! It’ll be no different then from what it is now: Huan and I will never be able to compete with the Other One. It’s like the Heavenly Dragon appearing when he comes on the scene. Mind you, I don’t hold it against the child. He’s a good-looking boy, is Bao-yu, and you can understand the grown-ups being silly about him. No, this is the one I can’t stand.’ As she uttered the word ‘this’, she held up two fingers. Mother Ma guessed her meaning: ‘Number Two’ – the younger of the Rong mansion’s two daughters-in-law. ‘You mean Mrs Lian?’ she said. Aunt Zhao’s face assumed an expression of terror. Motioning agitatedly to the other to remain silent, she got up, went to the door, raised the door-blind, looked around, and having satisfied herself that there were no eavesdroppers, came back and sat down again, her face close to Mother Ma’s. ‘She’s a dreadful person – dreadfuf! If that woman doesn’t end up by carrying off every stick of property belonging to this family to line her own nest with, my name’s not Zhao!’"
那寶玉便和他說些沒要緊的散話。又說道誰家的戲子好，誰家的花園好，又告訴他誰家的丫頭標緻，誰家的酒席豐盛，又是誰家有奇貨，又是誰家有異物。那賈蕓口裏只得順著他說，說了一會，見寶玉有些懶懶的了，便起身告辭。寶玉也不甚留，只說：「你明兒閑了，只管來。」仍命小丫頭子墜兒送他出去。,"That Baoyu talked nonsense with him. He said who's actors are good, who's garden is good, and who's girl is beautiful, who's feast is rich, who has strange goods, and who has foreign objects. Then Jia Yun had to follow him, and after a while, seeing that Baoyu was a little lazy, he got up and said goodbye. Baoyu didn't stay too much, but said, ""You're free tomorrow, just come here."" He still ordered the little girl, Zizui'er, to send him out.","Pao-yue then talked to him about trivial and irrelevant matters; and afterwards went on to tell him in whose household the actresses were best, and whose gardens were pretty. He further mentioned to him in whose quarters the servant-girls were handsome, whose banquets were sumptuous, as well as in whose home were to be found strange things, and what family possessed remarkable objects. Chia Yuen was constrained to humour him in his conversation; but after a chat, which lasted for some time, he noticed that Pao-yue was somewhat listless, and he promptly stood up and took his leave. And Pao-yue too did not use much pressure to detain him. “To-morrow, if you have nothing to do, do come over!” he merely observed; after which, he again bade the young waiting-maid, Chui Erh, see him out.","He sat down, nevertheless, and sipped his tea while Bao-yu made conversation on a number of unimportant topics. He told him which household kept the best troupe of players, which had the finest gardens, whose maids were the prettiest, who gave the best parties, and who had the best collection of curiosities or the strangest pets. Jia Yun did his best to keep up with him. After a while Bao-yu showed signs of flagging, and when Jia Yun, observing what appeared to be fatigue, rose to take his leave, he did not very strongly press him to stay. ‘You must come again when you can spare the time,’ said Bao-yu, and ordered Trinket to see him out of the Garden."
當下，奶娘來請問黛玉之房舍。賈母說：「今將寶玉挪出來，同我在套間暖閣兒裏，把你林姑娘暫安置碧紗櫥裏。等過了殘冬，春天再與他們收拾房屋，另作一番安置罷。」寶玉道：「好祖宗，我就在碧紗廚外的床上很妥當，何必又出來鬧的老祖宗不得安靜。」賈母想了一想說：「也罷了。」每人一個奶娘並一個丫頭照管，餘者在外間上夜聽喚。一面早有熙鳳命人送了一頂藕合色花帳，並幾件錦被緞褥之類。,"At the moment, the nanny came to ask Daiyuzhi's house. Mother Jia said, ""Now move Baoyu out and stay with me in the suite's warm pavilion, and put your Lin girl in the Bisha closet for the time being. After the lingering winter, I'll clean up the house with them in the spring and make another arrangement. Baoyu said, ""Good ancestor, it's fine for me to stay on the bed outside Bisha's kitchen, why should the old ancestor who came out to make a fuss should not be quiet."" Mother Jia thought for a while and said, ""It's fine."" A girl takes care of it, and the rest listen to the call at night outside. On the one hand, Xifeng ordered someone to send a lotus flower tent and a few brocade quilts and the like.","A nurse came at the moment and inquired about Tai-yue’s quarters, and dowager lady Chia at once added, “Shift Pao-yue along with me, into the warm room of my suite of apartments, and put your mistress, Miss Lin, temporarily in the green gauze house; and when the rest of the winter is over, and repairs are taken in hand in spring in their rooms, an additional wing can be put up for her to take up her quarters in.” “My dear ancestor,” ventured Pao-yue; “the bed I occupy outside the green gauze house is very comfortable; and what need is there again for me to leave it and come and disturb your old ladyship’s peace and quiet?” “Well, all right,” observed dowager lady Chia, after some consideration; “but let each one of you have a nurse, as well as a waiting-maid to attend on you; the other servants can remain in the outside rooms and keep night watch and be ready to answer any call.” At an early hour, besides, Hsi-feng had sent a servant round with a grey flowered curtain, embroidered coverlets and satin quilts and other such articles.","At this point some of the older women came to inquire what room Dai-yu was to sleep in. ‘Move Bao-yu into the closet-bed with me,’ said Grandmother Jia, ‘and put Miss Lin for the time being in the green muslin summer-bed. We had better wait until spring when the last of the cold weather is over before seeing about the rooms for them and getting them settled permanently.’ ‘Dearest Grannie,’ said Bao-yu pleadingly, ‘I should be perfectly all right next to the summer-bed. There’s no need to move me into your room. I should only keep you awake.’ Grandmother Jia, after a moment’s reflection, gave her consent. She further gave instructions that Dai-yu and Bao-yu were each to have one nurse and one maid to sleep with them. The rest of their servants were to do night duty by rota in the adjoining room. Xi-feng had already sent across some lilac-coloured hangings, brocade quilts, satin coverlets and the like for Dai-yu’s bedding."
當日地陷東南，這東南一隅有處曰姑蘇，有城曰閶門者，最是紅塵中一二等富貴風流之地。這閶門外有個十里街，街內有個仁清巷，巷內有個古廟，因地方窄狹，人皆呼作葫蘆廟。廟旁住著一家鄉宦，姓甄，名費，字士隱。嫡妻封氏，情性賢淑，深明禮義。家中雖不甚富貴，然本地便也推他為望族了。因這甄士隱稟性恬淡，不以功名為念，每日只以觀花修竹、酌酒吟詩為樂，倒是神僊一流人品。衹是一件不足，如今年已半百，膝下無兒，衹有一女，乳名喚作英蓮，年方三歲。,"On that day, the land fell to the southeast. In this southeast corner, there was a place called Gusu and a city called Changmen. It was the most wealthy and romantic place in the world. There is Shili Street outside Changmen, and there is Renqing Lane in the street. There is an ancient temple in the alley. Because of the narrowness of the area, everyone calls it the Gourd Temple. Next to the temple lived a hometown official, surnamed Zhen, given name Fei, and styled Shiyin. His first wife, Feng Shi, has a virtuous and virtuous character, and understands propriety and righteousness. Although the family is not very rich, but the local also regarded him as a prominent family. Because of this Zhen Shiyin's indifferent nature, he does not think about his achievements, but only enjoys watching flowers, cultivating bamboos, drinking wine and reciting poetry every day. There is only one shortcoming. Now that he is half a hundred years old, he has no children and only one daughter. The baby name is Yinglian, and she is three years old.","In old days, the land in the South East lay low. In this South-East part of the world, was situated a walled town, Ku Su by name. Within the walls a locality, called the Ch’ang Men, was more than all others throughout the mortal world, the centre, which held the second, if not the first place for fashion and life. Beyond this Ch’ang Men was a street called Shih-li-chieh (Ten _Li_ street); in this street a lane, the Jen Ch’ing lane (Humanity and Purity); and in this lane stood an old temple, which on account of its diminutive dimensions, was called, by general consent, the Gourd temple. Next door to this temple lived the family of a district official, Chen by surname, Fei by name, and Shih-yin by style. His wife, nee Feng, possessed a worthy and virtuous disposition, and had a clear perception of moral propriety and good conduct. This family, though not in actual possession of excessive affluence and honours, was, nevertheless, in their district, conceded to be a clan of well-to-do standing. As this Chen Shih-yin was of a contented and unambitious frame of mind, and entertained no hankering after any official distinction, but day after day of his life took delight in gazing at flowers, planting bamboos, sipping his wine and conning poetical works, he was in fact, in the indulgence of these pursuits, as happy as a supernatural being. One thing alone marred his happiness. He had lived over half a century and had, as yet, no male offspring around his knees. He had one only child, a daughter, whose infant name was Ying Lien. She was just three years of age.","This is how the inscription began: Long, long ago the world was tilted downwards towards the south-east; and in that lower-lying south-easterly part of the earth there is a city called Soochow; and in Soochow the district around the Chang-men Gate is reckoned one of the two or three wealthiest and most fashionable quarters in the world of men. Outside the Chang-men Gate is a wide thorough fare called Worldly Way; and somewhere off Worldly Way is an area called Carnal Lane. There is an old temple in the Carnal Lane area which, because of the way it is bottled up inside a narrow cul-de-sac, is referred to locally as Bottle-gourd Temple. Next door to Bottle-gourd Temple lived a gentleman of private means called Zhen Shi-yin and his wife Feng-shi, a kind, good woman with a profound sense of-decency and decorum. The household was not a particularly wealthy one, but they were nevertheless looked up to by all and sundry as the leading family in the neighbourhood. Zhen Shi-yin himself was by nature a quiet and totally unambitious person. He devoted his time to his garden and to the pleasures of wine and poetry. Except for a single flaw, his existence could, indeed, have been described as an idyllic one. The flaw was that, although already past fifty, he had no son, only a little girl, just two years old, whose name was Ying-lian."
鳳姐兒故意的把腳步放遲了些兒，見他去遠了，心裏暗忖道：「這纔是知人知面不知心呢，那裏有這樣禽獸的人呢。他如果如此，幾時叫他死在我的手裏，他纔知道我的手段！」,"Sister Feng deliberately delayed her footsteps. Seeing that he was far away, she thought to herself, ""This is the one who knows people, knows faces, but doesn't know their hearts. There are such beasts out there. If he is like this, when will he be killed? In my hands, he knows my means!""","Lady Feng purposely slackened her pace; and when she perceived that he had gone a certain distance, she gave way to reflection. “This is indeed,” she thought, “knowing a person, as far as face goes, and not as heart! Can there be another such a beast as he! If he really continues to behave in this manner, I shall soon enough compass his death, with my own hands, and he’ll then know what stuff I’m made of.”","Xi-feng mischievously provoked him by deliberately slowing down the pace of her own progress through the garden. ‘What an odious creature!’ she thought to herself when there was some distance between them. ‘Appearances certainly are deceptive! Who would have guessed he was that sort of person? Well, if he is, he had better look out! One of these days I’ll settle his hash for him; then perhaps he will realize what sort of person he is up against!’"
且說賈璉自回家參見過眾人，回至房中。正值鳳姐近日多事之時，無片刻閑暇之工，見賈璉遠路歸來，少不得撥冗接待，房內無外人，便笑道：「國舅老爺大喜！國舅老爺一路風塵辛苦。小的聽見昨日的頭起報馬來報，說今日大駕歸府，略預備了一杯水酒撣塵，不知賜光謬領否？」賈璉笑道：「豈敢豈敢，多承多承。」一面平兒與眾丫鬟參拜畢，獻茶。賈璉遂問別後家中的諸事，又謝鳳姐的操持勞碌。,"Besides, Jia Lian had seen everyone since he returned home and returned to his room. When Sister Feng was busy recently, she had no spare time to work. Seeing Jia Lian returning from a long way, she had to take time to receive him. There was no one in the room. The head of the newspaper reported to the Malay newspaper, saying that I will be returning home today, and I have prepared a glass of water and wine to dust the dust. I don’t know if I will give you the light and lead it?” Jia Lian smiled, “How dare you not dare, I will bear more and more.” After the maids visit the shrine, they offer tea. Jia Lian then asked goodbye to the family affairs, and thanked Sister Feng for her hard work.","Having, after his arrival home, paid his salutations to all the inmates, he retired to his own quarters at the very moment that lady Feng had multifarious duties to attend to, and had not even a minute to spare; but, considering that Chia Lien had returned from a distant journey, she could not do otherwise than put by what she had to do, and to greet him and wait on him. “Imperial uncle,” she said, in a jocose manner, when she realised that there was no outsider present in the room, “I congratulate you! What fatigue and hardship you, Imperial uncle, have had to bear throughout the whole journey, your humble servant heard yesterday, when the courier sent ahead came and announced that Your Highness would this day reach this mansion. I have merely got ready a glass of mean wine for you to wipe down the dust with, but I wonder, whether Your Highness will deign to bestow upon it the lustre of your countenance, and accept it.” Chia Lien smiled. “How dare I presume to such an honour,” he added by way of rejoinder; “I’m unworthy of such attention! Many thanks, many thanks.” P’ing Erh and the whole company of waiting-maids simultaneously paid their obeisance to him, and this ceremony concluded, they presented tea. Chia Lien thereupon made inquiries about the various matters, which had transpired in their home after his departure, and went on to thank lady Feng for all the trouble she had taken in the management of them.","When he had finished seeing everyone in the family, Jia Lian returned at last to his own apartment. Xi-feng, though still so busy that she had not a moment’s leisure, had somehow contrived to find time to welcome back her wandering lord. ‘Congratulations, Imperial Kinsman!’ she said with a smile when, except for the servants, they were at last alone together. ‘You have had a tiring journey, Imperial Kinsman. Yesterday when the courier gave notice of your arrival, I prepared a humble entertainment to celebrate your homecoming. Will the Imperial Kinsman graciously condescend to take a cup of wine with his handmaid ?’ Jia Lian replied in the same vein: ‘Madam, you are too kind! I am your most oble-e-eged and humble servant, ma’am!’ As they joked together, Patience and the other maids came forward to welcome their Master back, after which they served them both with tea. Jia Lian asked Xi-feng about the events that had occurred during his absence and thanked her for looking after things so well while he was away."
旁邊伏侍賈瑞的眾人，只見他先還拿著鏡子照，落下來，仍睜開眼拾在手內，末後鏡子落下來便不動了。眾人上來看看，已沒了氣，身子底下冰涼稀濕一大灘精，這纔忙著穿衣抬床。,"The people who were waiting for Jia Rui next to him saw that he was still holding a mirror to take a look, and when he fell, he still opened his eyes and picked it up in his hand, and then the mirror fell and stopped moving. Everyone came up to take a look, they were out of breath, and there was a large pool of sperm under the body, so they were busy getting dressed and lifting the bed.","The servants, who stood by in attendance, saw him at first still holding the glass in his hand and looking in, and then, when it fell from his grasp, open his eyes again to pick it up, but when at length the mirror dropped, and he at once ceased to move, they in a body came forward to ascertain what had happened to him. He had already breathed his last. The lower part of his body was icy-cold; his clothes moist from profuse perspiration. With all promptitude they changed him there and then, and carried him to another bed.","To those who stood around the bed and watched him while this was happening he appeared first to be holding up the mirror and looking into it, then to let it drop; then to open his eyes in a ghastly stare and pick it up again; then, as it once more fell from his grasp, he finally ceased to move. When they examined him more closely they found that his breathing had already stopped and that underneath his body there was a large, wet, icy patch of recently ejaculated semen."
林黛玉聽了笑道：「你們聽聽，這是喫了他們家一點子茶葉，就來使喚人了。」鳳姐笑道：「倒求你，你倒說這些閑話，喫茶喫水的。你既喫了我們家的茶，怎麼還不給我們家作媳婦？」眾人聽了一齊都笑起來。林黛玉紅了臉，一聲兒不言語，便回過頭去了。李宮裁笑向寶釵道：「真真我們二嬸子的詼諧是好的。」林黛玉道：「什麼詼諧，不過是貧嘴賤舌討人厭惡罷了。」說著便啐了一口。鳳姐笑道：「你別作夢！你給我們家作了媳婦，少什麼？」指寶玉道：「你瞧瞧，人物兒、門第配不上，根基配不上，家私配不上？那一點還玷辱了誰呢？」林黛玉抬身就走。寶釵便叫：「顰兒急了，還不回來坐著。走了倒沒意思。」說著便站起來拉住。,"Lin Daiyu listened and said with a smile, ""Listen, everyone, they ate a little tea from their family, and then they came to call people."" Sister Feng smiled and said, ""I beg you, you talk about these gossips, and you eat tea and water. Why don't you make a daughter-in-law for our family?"" Everyone laughed when they heard this. Lin Daiyu blushed and turned around without saying a word. Li Gongcai smiled and said to Baochai, ""It's true that our second aunt's humor is good."" Lin Daiyu said, ""What a joke, it's just a sloppy tongue that is disgusting."" Then he spat. Sister Feng smiled and said, ""Don't dream! You have become a daughter-in-law to our family, so what is missing?"" Zhi Baoyu said, ""Look, people, family members are not worthy, the foundation is not worthy, and the furniture is not worthy. Who else has humiliated at that point?"" Lin Daiyu raised her body and left. Baochai called out, ""I'm in a hurry, and I haven't come back to sit yet. It's boring to leave."" Then he stood up and pulled him.","When Lin Tai-yue heard these words, she put on a smile. “You just mark this,” she observed. “I’ve had to-day a little tea from her place, and she at once begins making a tool of me!” “Since you’ve had some of our tea,” lady Feng laughed, “how is it that you have not yet become a wife in our household?” The whole party burst out laughing aloud. So much so, that they found it difficult to repress themselves. But Tai-yue’s face was suffused with blushes. She turned her head the other way, and uttered not a word. “Our sister-in-law Secunda’s jibes are first-rate!” Pao-ch’ai chimed in with a laugh. “What jibes!” exclaimed Tai-yue; “they’re purely and simply the prattle of a mean mouth and vile tongue! They’re enough to evoke people’s displeasure!” Saying this, she went on to sputter in disgust. “Were you,” insinuated lady Feng, “to become a wife in my family, what is there that you would lack?” Pointing then at Pao-yue, “Look here!” she cried--”Is not this human being worthy of you? Is not his station in life good enough for you? Are not our stock and estate sufficient for you? and in what slight degree can he make you lose caste?” Tai-yue rose to her feet, and retired immediately. But Pao-ch’ai shouted out: “Here’s P’in Erh in a huff ! Don’t you yet come back? when you’ve gone, there will really be no fun!” While calling out to her, she jumped up to pull her back.","Dai-yu laughed mockingly: ‘Do you hear that, everybody? Because she’s given me a bit of her old tea, I have to start doing odd jobs for her.’ ‘That’s fair enough,’ said Xi-feng. ‘You know the rule: “drink the family’s tea, the family’s bride-to-be”.’ Everyone laughed at this except Dai-yu, who turned her head away, blushing furiously, and said nothing. ‘Cousin Feng will have her little joke,’ Li Wan observed to Bao-chai with a smile. ‘Do you call that a joke?’ said Dai-yu. ‘It was a silly, idle remark, and very irritating.’ She gave a snort of disgust by way of reinforcement. Xi-feng laughed: ‘What’s so irritating about it? Look at him!’ – She pointed at Bao-yu – ‘Isn’t he good enough for you ? Good looks, good family, good income. There are no snags that I can see. It’s a perfect match!’ Dai-yu rose and fled. ‘Oh, Frowner’s in a rage! Come back Frowner!’ Bao-chai called out after her. ‘If you go, it will spoil all the fun.’ She got up and went after Dai-yu to bring her back."
且說他姑娘，原聘給的是賈家玉字輩的嫡派，名喚賈璜。但其族人那裏皆能象寧榮二府的富勢，原不用細說。這賈璜夫妻守著些小的產業，又時常到寧榮二府裏去請請安，又會奉承鳳姐兒並尤氏，所以鳳姐兒尤氏也時常資助資助他，方能如此度日。今日正遇天氣晴明，又值家中無事，遂帶了一個婆子，坐上車，來家裏走步，瞧瞧寡嫂並侄兒。,"Let's talk about his girl, who was originally hired to be a descendant of the Jia family's jade generation, and her name was Jia Huang. However, their clansmen can all be as prosperous as Ningrong's second residence, so I don't need to go into details. The Jia Huang couple guarded some small property, and they often went to Ning Rong's second house to say goodbye, and they would flatter Feng Jie'er and You's family, so Feng Jie'er and You's family often subsidized him, so that he could live like this. Today, the weather was fine and there was nothing to do at home, so I brought a woman, got into the car, and came to the house for a walk, to see the widowed sister-in-law and nephew.","The Chia Huang couple enjoyed some small income; but they also went, on frequent occasions, to the mansions of Ning and Jung to pay their respects; and they knew likewise so well how to adulate lady Feng and Mrs. Yu, that lady Feng and Mrs. Yu would often grant them that assistance and support which afforded them the means of meeting their daily expenses. It just occurred on this occasion that the weather was clear and fine, and that there happened, on the other hand, to be nothing to attend to at home, so forthwith taking along with her a matron, (Mrs. Chia Huang) got into a carriage and came over to see widow Chin and her nephew.","Jokey Jin’s aunt was married to one Jia Huang, a member of the Jia clan in the same generation as Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian. It goes without saying, of course, that not all members of the clan lived in the sort of style maintained by the Ning and Rong households. Jia Huang and his wife had only the income from a very small property to live on, and it was only by dint of frequent visits to the Ning and Rong mansions, where their flattering attentions on Wang Xi-feng and You-shi earned them an occasional subsidy, that they were able to make ends meet. Today the weather was fine and sunny and Mrs Huang had nothing particular to do at home, so taking an old serving-woman with her, she got into a cab and went off to pay a call on her sister-in-law and nephew."
一時間周瑞家的攜花至王夫人正房後頭來。,"For a while, Zhou Rui's family brought flowers to the back of Mrs. Wang's main room.",Wang’s principal apartment.,"Bearing her box of flowers, Zhou Rui’s wife presently came to the part of the house behind Lady Wang’s quarters."
那先生笑道：「大奶奶這個症候，可是那眾位耽擱了。要在初次行經的日期就用藥治起來，不但斷無今日之患，而且此時已全癒了。如今既是把病耽誤到這個地位，也是應有此災。依我看來，這病尚有三分治得。喫了我的藥看，若是夜裏睡的著覺，那時又添了二分拿手了。據我看這脈息：大奶奶是個心性高強聰明不過的人；聰明忒過，則不如意事常有；不如意事常有，則思慮太過。此病是憂慮傷脾，肝木忒旺，經血所以不能按時而至。大奶奶從前的行經的日子問一問，斷不是常縮，必是常長的。是不是？」這婆子答道：「可不是，從沒有縮過，或是長兩日三日，以至十日都長過。」先生聽了道：「妙啊！這就是病源了。從前若能夠以養心調經之藥服之，何至於此。這如今明顯出一個水虧木旺的症候來。待用藥看看。」於是寫了方子，遞與賈蓉，上寫的是：,"The gentleman said with a smile: ""Grandma's symptom, but everyone has delayed it. If you want to treat it with medicine on the date of the first menstruation, not only will the problem today be eliminated, but it will be completely cured at this time. Now, since the disease has been delayed until In this position, there should be this disaster. In my opinion, this disease can still be cured by three points. Taking my medicine, if you fall asleep at night, then it will add another two points. According to me, this pulse : Grandma is a person with a strong mind and a smart, but too smart. If you are too smart, you will often have unpleasant things; if you have unsatisfactory things often, you will think too much. This disease is that anxiety hurts the spleen, the liver is too strong, and the menstrual blood cannot arrive on time. When the great grandmother asked about the days of her menstruation in the past, it was definitely not always shrinking, but it must have always been long. Is it?"" The old woman replied, ""No, it has never been shortened, or it has been two or three days long. Even ten days have passed.” After listening to the master, the master said: “Wonderful! This is the source of the disease. If you could take the medicine for nourishing the heart and regulating the menstruation, why would it be like this? Now it is obviously a symptom of water deficiency and wood prosperity. Wait for the medicine to take a look."" So he wrote a recipe and handed it to Jia Rong, which read:","“This complaint of your lady’s,” observed the Doctor, “has certainly been neglected by the whole number of doctors; for had a treatment with certain medicines been initiated at the time of the first occurrence of her habitual sickness, I cannot but opine that, by this time, a perfect cure would have been effected. But seeing that the organic complaint has now been, through neglect, allowed to reach this phase, this calamity was, in truth, inevitable. My ideas are that this illness stands, as yet, a certain chance of recovery, (three chances out of ten); but we will see how she gets on, after she has had these medicines of mine. Should they prove productive of sleep at night, then there will be added furthermore two more chances in the grip of our hands. From my diagnosis, your lady is a person, gifted with a preeminently excellent, and intelligent disposition; but an excessive degree of intelligence is the cause of frequent contrarieties; and frequent contrarieties give origin to an excessive amount of anxious cares. This illness arises from the injury done, by worrying and fretting, to the spleen, and from the inordinate vigour of the liver; hence it is that the relief cannot come at the proper time and season. Has not your lady, may I ask, heretofore at the period of the catamenia, suffered, if indeed not from anaemia, then necessarily from plethora? Am I right in assuming this or not?” “To be sure she did,” replied the matron; “but she has never been subject to anaemia, but to a plethora, varying from either two to three days, and extending, with much irregularity, to even ten days.” “Quite so!” observed the Doctor, after hearing what she had to say, “and this is the source of this organic illness! Had it in past days been treated with such medicine as could strengthen the heart, and improve the respiration, would it have reached this stage? This has now overtly made itself manifest in an ailment originating from the paucity of water and the vigour of fire; but let me make use of some medicines, and we’ll see how she gets on!” There and then he set to work and wrote a prescription, which he handed to Chia Jung, the purpose of which was: Decoction for the improvement of respiration, the betterment of the blood, and the restoration of the spleen.","‘I am afraid my colleagues have allowed your mistress’s condition to deteriorate,’ said the doctor.’ If she had been given proper treatment at the very beginning, when she first started her courses, there is every reason to suppose that she would by now be completely cured. But the illness has been neglected for so long now, this breakdown was almost bound to happen. I would say that with proper treatment she has about a one in three chance of recovery. We shall just have to see how she responds to my medicine. If, after taking it, she can get a good night’s sleep, her chances will be distinctly better: say fifty-fifty. ‘From my reading of her pulse, I should expect your mistress to be a very highly strung, sensitive young woman. Sometimes, when people are over-sensitive, they find a good deal that is upsetting in what goes on around them; and of course, if things are upsetting them, they will tend to worry a lot. This illness has been caused by too much worry affecting the spleen and causing an excess of wood in the liver, with the result that the menstrual blood has been prevented from flowing at the proper times. If we were to ask your mistress about the dates of her courses, I am sure we should find that they tended to be on the late side, isn’t that so ?’ ‘Absolutely right,’ the old woman replied. ‘Her periods have never been early. Sometimes two or three days late, sometimes as much as ten days: but in any case, always late.’ ‘You see!’ said the doctor.’ There is the cause of the trouble. If she could have been treated in time with something to fortify the heart and stabilize the humours, she would never have got into this present state. What we have now , I am afraid, is an advanced case of dehydration. Well, we shall have to see what my medicine can do for her.’ He wrote out the following prescription and handed it to Jia Rong:"
寶玉往上房去後，誰知黛玉走來，見寶玉不在房中，因翻弄案上書看，可巧翻出昨兒的《莊子》來。看至所續之處，不覺又氣又笑，不禁也提筆續書一絕云：「無端弄筆是何人？作踐《南華》莊子文。不悔自己無見識，卻將醜語怪他人！」寫畢，也往上房來見賈母，後往王夫人處來。,"After Baoyu went up to the room, who knew that Daiyu came over and saw that Baoyu was not in the room, because she was rummaging through the case and reading the book, she happened to find yesterday's ""Zhuangzi"". When I saw the continuation, I felt angry and laughing, and I couldn't help but mention the pen continuation book: ""Who is the one who made the pen without a reason? I practice the ""Nan Hua"" Zhuang Ziwen. I don't regret my lack of knowledge, but I blame others for the ugly words. After writing, he also went to the upper room to see Mother Jia, and then to Madam Wang.","Noticing that Pao-yue was not in, she was fumbling with the books on the table and examining them, when, as luck would have it, she turned up the Chuang Tzu of the previous day. Upon perusing the passage tagged on by Pao-yue, she could not help feeling both incensed and amused. Nor could she restrain herself from taking up the pen and appending a stanza to this effect: Who is that man, who of his pen, without good rhyme, made use, A toilsome task to do into the Chuang-tzu text to steal , Who for the knowledge he doth lack no sense of shame doth feel, But language vile and foul employs third parties to abuse? At the conclusion of what she had to write, she too came into the drawing room; but after paying her respects to dowager lady Chia, she walked over to madame Wang’s quarters.","Later, after Bao-yu had gone off to the front apartment, Dai-yu looked in unexpectedly, and not finding Bao-yu in, began idly turning over the books that were lying on his desk. Chancing to light on the volume of Zhuang-zi that he had been reading the night before, her eye was drawn to the lines he had written in the margin. They both vexed and amused her, and she could not resist picking up a writing-brush and adding the following quatrain on the remaining blank space: What wretch would here, with scurrile pen, The text of Zhnang-zi plagiarize, And, heedless of his own great faults, Fright others with his wicked lies ? That done, she went to the front apartment to see Grand-mother Jia, and from there on to Lady Wang’s. ∗ She found everyone at Lady Wang’s in a great to-do."
鳳姐亦起身告辭，和寶玉攜手同行。尤氏等送至大廳，只見燈燭輝煌，眾小廝都在丹墀下侍立。那焦大又恃賈珍不在家，即在家亦不好怎樣，更可以恣意灑落灑落。因趁著酒興，先罵大總管賴二，說他不公道，欺軟怕硬，「有了好差事就派別人，象這樣黑更半夜送人的事，就派我。沒良心的王八羔子！瞎充管家！你也不想想，焦大太爺蹺起一隻腳來，比你頭還高呢。二十年頭裏的焦大太爺眼裏有誰？別說你們這一把子雜種王八羔子們！」,"Sister Feng also got up to leave and walked hand in hand with Baoyu. When You Shi and others sent them to the hall, they saw the lights and candles were shining brightly, and all the servants were standing under Dan Chi. That Jiao Da also relied on Jia Zhen not being at home, even if she was at home, it would not be good, and she could just scatter and scatter freely. Taking advantage of the wine boom, he first scolded the chief executive Lai Er, saying that he was unfair, bullying the weak and fearing the hard, ""If you have a good job, you will send someone else, and if you send someone in the middle of the night like this, you will send me. You bastard with no conscience! Blind! Acting as a housekeeper! Don't even think about it, Mr. Jiao has one foot crossed and is taller than your head. Who does Mr. Jiao see in his 20 years of age? Don't talk about you bastards! ""","Lady Feng also got up, said good-bye, and hand in hand with Pao-yue, they walked out of the room, escorted by Mrs. Yu and the party, as far as the entrance of the Main Hall, where they saw the lamps shedding a brilliant light and the attendants all waiting on the platforms. Chiao Ta, however, availing himself of Chia Chen’s absence from home, and elated by wine, began to abuse the head steward Lai Erh for his injustice. “You bully of the weak and coward with the strong,” he cried, “when there’s any pleasant charge, you send the other servants, but when it’s a question of seeing any one home in the dark, then you ask me, you disorderly clown! a nice way you act the steward, indeed! Do you forget that if Mr. Chiao Ta chose to raise one leg, it would be a good deal higher than your head! Remember please, that twenty years ago, Mr. Chiao Ta wouldn’t even so much as look at any one, no matter who it was; not to mention a pack of hybrid creatures like yourselves!”","The women replied that it was waiting, and she rose to take her leave and, taking Bao-yu by the hand, went out on to the steps, attended by You-shi and the rest. In the flickering light of many lanterns the pages stood stiffly to attention on the pavement below, while Big Jiao, encouraged by Cousin Zhen’s absence to indulge his talent for drunken abuse, was getting to work on the Chief Steward, Lai Sheng, accusing him of being unfair, of always dropping on the weakest, and so on and so forth. ‘If there’s a cushy job going you give it to someone else, but when it’s a question of seeing someone home in pitch bloody darkness, you pick on me. Mean, rotten bugger! Call yourself a steward ? Some steward! Don’t you know who Old Jiao is? I can lift my foot up higher than your head I Twenty years ago I didn’t give a damn for anybody , never mind a pack of little misbegotten abortions like you!’"
卻說秦氏正在房外囑咐小丫頭們好生看著貓兒狗兒打架，忽聽寶玉在夢中喚他的小名，因納悶道：「我的小名這裏從沒人知道的，他如何知道，在夢裏叫出來？」正是：一場幽夢同誰近，千古情人獨我癡。,"But he said that Mrs. Qin was telling the little girls to watch the cats and dogs fight outside the room, and suddenly heard Baoyu calling his nickname in a dream, because he wondered: ""My nickname is never known here, how does he know, Call it out in a dream?"" Exactly: who is close to a dream, and the lover of the ages is alone.","But we must observe that Mrs. Ch’in was just inside the apartment in the act of recommending the young waiting-maids to be mindful that the cats and dogs did not start a fight, when she unawares heard Pao-yue, in his dream, call her by her infant name. In a melancholy mood she therefore communed within herself, “As far as my infant name goes, there is, in this establishment, no one who has any idea what it is, and how is it that he has come to know it, and that he utters it in his dream?” And she was at this period unable to fathom the reason. But, reader, listen to the explanations given in the chapter which follows.","But Qin-shi, who was out in the courtyard telling the maids to be sure that the cats and dogs didn’t fight, marvelled to hear him call her name out in his sleep. ‘“Ke-qing” was the name they called me back at home when I was a little girl. Nobody here knows it. I wonder how he could have found it out ?’ If you have not yet fathomed the answer to her question, you must read the next chapter."
於是出亭過池，一山一石，一花一木，莫不著意觀覽。忽抬頭看見前面一帶粉垣，裏面數楹修捨，有千百竿翠竹遮映。眾人都道：「好個所在！」於是大家進入，只見入門便是曲折遊廊，階下石子漫成甬路。上面小小兩三間房舍，一明兩暗，裏面都是合著地步打就的床幾椅案。從裏間房內又得一小門，出去則是後院，有大株梨花兼著芭蕉。又有兩間小小退步。後院牆下忽開一隙，得泉一派，開溝僅尺許，灌入牆內，繞階緣屋至前院，盤旋竹下而出。,"So I went out of the pavilion and crossed the pond, one mountain, one stone, one flower and one tree, all of them watched carefully. Suddenly, he looked up and saw a pink wall in front of him. There were several shrines in it, and there were thousands of green bamboos covering the shadows. Everyone said, ""It's a good place!"" So everyone entered, only to see that the entrance was a winding veranda, and the stones under the steps formed a road. There are two or three small rooms above, one bright and two dark, and inside are all the beds and chairs that were built together. There is a small door from the inner room, and out is the backyard, where there are large pear blossoms and plantains. There are two more small retreats. A gap was suddenly opened under the wall of the backyard, and there was a school of springs. The ditch was only about a foot long, and it was poured into the wall.","But forthwith they issued from the pavilions, and crossed the pond, contemplating with close attention each elevation, each stone, each flower, or each tree. And as suddenly they raised their heads, they caught sight, in front of them, of a line of white wall, of numbers of columns, and beautiful cottages, where flourished hundreds and thousands of verdant bamboos, which screened off the rays of the sun. “What a lovely place!” they one and all exclaimed. Speedily the whole company penetrated inside, perceiving, as soon as they had entered the gate, a zigzag arcade, below the steps of which was a raised pathway, laid promiscuously with stones, and on the furthest part stood a diminutive cottage with three rooms, two with doors leading into them and one without. Everything in the interior, in the shape of beds, teapoys, chairs and tables, were made to harmonise with the space available. Leading out of the inner room of the cottage was a small door from which, as they egressed, they found a back-court with lofty pear trees in blossom and banana trees, as well as two very small retiring back-courts. At the foot of the wall, unexpectedly became visible an aperture where was a spring, for which a channel had been opened scarcely a foot or so wide, to enable it to run inside the wall. Winding round the steps, it skirted the buildings until it reached the front court, where it coiled and curved, flowing out under the bamboos.","They now left the pavilion and crossed to the other side of the pool. For a while they walked on, stopping from time to time to admire the various rocks and flowers and trees which they passed on their way, until suddenly they found themselves at the foot of a range of whitewashed walls enclosing a small retreat almost hidden among the hundreds and hundreds of green bamboos which grew in a dense thicket behind them. With cries of admiration they went inside. A cloister-like covered walk ran round the walls from the entrance to the back of the forecourt and a cobbled pathway led up to the steps of the terrace. The house was a tiny three-frame one, two parts latticed, the third part windowless. The tables, chairs and couches which furnished it seemed to have been specially made to fit the interior. A door in the rear wall opened onto a garden of broad-leaved plantains dominated by a large flowering pear-tree and overlooked on either side by two diminutive lodges built at right angles to the back of the house. A stream gushed through an opening at the foot of the garden wall into a channel barely a foot wide which ran to the foot of the rear terrace and thence round the side of the house to the front, where it meandered through the bamboos of the forecourt before finally disappearing through another opening in the surrounding wall."
這一日，寶玉也不大出房，也不和姊妹丫頭等廝鬧，自己悶悶的，只不過拿著書解悶，或弄筆墨；也不使喚眾人，只叫四兒答應，誰知四兒是個聰敏乖巧不過的丫頭，見寶玉用他，他變盡方法籠絡寶玉。至晚飯後，寶玉因喫了兩杯酒，眼餳耳熱之際，若往日則有襲人等大家喜笑有興，今日卻冷清清的一人對燈，好沒興趣。待要趕了他們去，又怕他們得了意，以後越發來勸；若拿出做上的規矩來鎮唬，似乎無情太甚。說不得橫心只當他們死了，橫豎自然也要過的。便權當他們死了，毫無牽掛，反能怡然自悅。因命四兒剪燈烹茶，自己看了一回《南華經》。正看至《外篇·胠篋》一則，其文曰：,"On this day, Baoyu didn't go out of the house very much, and he didn't fight with his sisters and girls. He was bored, but he just wrote a book to relieve his boredom, or made ink. The clever and well-behaved girl, seeing Baoyu using him, he tried his best to win over Baoyu. After dinner, when Baoyu ate two glasses of wine, his eyes were hot and his ears were hot. In the past, there were people waiting for everyone to laugh and laugh. Today, a person who is deserted is not interested in lamps. When I was about to drive them away, I was afraid that they would be satisfied, and I would come to persuade them more and more in the future; It's hard to say that Hengxin only thinks that they are dead, and Hengzhi will naturally have to live. When they died, Ben Quan would have nothing to worry about, but would be happy instead. Because of ordering Si'er to cut the lantern and cook tea, he read the ""South China Classic"" by himself. I was looking at the article ""Outer Chapters,"" and the article said:","Pao-yue did not, on this day, so much as put his foot outside the door of his room, but sat all alone sad and dejected, simply taking up his books, in order to dispel his melancholy fit, or diverting himself with his writing materials; while he did not even avail himself of the services of any of the family servants, but simply bade Ssu Erh answer his calls. This Ssu Erh was, who would have thought it, a girl gifted with matchless artfulness, and perceiving that Pao-yue had requisitioned her services, she speedily began to devise extreme ways and means to inveigle him. When evening came, and dinner was over, Pao-yue’s eyes were scorching hot and his ears burning from the effects of two cups of wine that he had taken. Had it been in past days, he would have now had Hsi Jen and her companions with him, and with all their good cheer and laughter, he would have been enjoying himself. But here was he, on this occasion, dull and forlorn, a solitary being, gazing at the lamp with an absolute lack of pleasure. By and by he felt a certain wish to go after them, but dreading that if they carried their point, they would, in the future, come and tender advice still more immoderate, and that, were he to put on the airs of a superior to intimidate them, he would appear to be too deeply devoid of all feeling, he therefore, needless to say, thwarted the wish of his heart, and treated them just as if they were dead. And as anyway he was constrained also to live, alone though he was, he readily looked upon them, for the time being as departed, and did not worry his mind in the least on their account. On the contrary, he was able to feel happy and contented with his own society.","All that day Bao-yu stayed in his own room, seeing no one. It was gloomy on his own, with nothing but reading and a little writing for amusement, but he refused to make use of any of his usual attendants and would have only “Number Four” to wait on him. Though he did not realize it, she was a designing little minx and endeavoured by every artifice at her command to get her hooks into him while she had the chance. After dinner Bao-yu came back flushed and slightly tipsy, having taken a few cups of wine with his meal. Normally this would have been the occasion for an evening of hilarity with Aroma and the rest, but today he would have to sit by his lamp alone in cheerless isolation. The prospect was a depressing one. Yet if he were to go running after her, it would seem too much like a capitulation, and her nagging would thenceforth become insufferable. On the other hand, to frighten her into some sort of compliance by asserting his mastery over her would be heartless. There was nothing else for it: he would just have to grin and bear it. ‘Suppose they were all dead,’ he said to himself. ‘I should have to make do on my own somehow or other!’ The thought was strangely comforting. He was able to stop worrying. He even began to feel quite cheerful. Having instructed Number Four to trim up the lamp and brew him a pot of tea, he settled down to a volume of Zbuang-zi. Presently he came to the following passage in the chapter called ‘Rifling Trunks’:"
第二十三回,twenty-third,CHAPTER XXIII.,Chapter 23
賈政剛至園門前，只見賈珍帶領許多執事人來，一旁侍立。賈政道：「你且把園門都關上，我們先瞧了外面再進去。」賈珍聽說，命人將門關了。賈政先秉正看門。只見正門五間，上面桶瓦泥鰍脊；那門欄窗槅，皆是細雕新鮮花樣，並無朱粉塗飾；一色水磨群牆，下面白石臺磯，鑿成西番草花樣。左右一望，皆雪白粉牆，下面虎皮石，隨勢砌去，果然不落富麗俗套，自是歡喜。遂命開門，只見迎面一帶翠嶂擋在前面。眾清客都道：「好山，好山！」賈政道：「非此一山，一進來園中所有之景悉入目中，則有何趣。」眾人道：「極是。非胸中大有邱壑，焉想及此。」說畢，往前一望，見白石崚嶒，或如鬼怪，或如猛獸，縱橫拱立，上面苔蘚成斑，藤蘿掩映，其中微露羊腸小徑。賈政道：「我們就從此小徑遊去，回來由那一邊出去，方可遍覽。」,"Just when Jia Zheng arrived at the gate of the garden, he saw Jia Zhen leading many deacons and standing by. Jia Zheng said: ""You close the gate of the garden, we will look outside before entering."" Jia Zhen heard that and ordered the door to be closed. Jia Zhengxian was watching the door. I saw the five main entrances, with bucket tiles and loach ridges above them; the doors, railings, and windows, all of which were carved with fresh patterns, without vermilion powder coating; the walls of one-color water mills, and the white stone terraces below, hewn into the pattern of cilantro. Looking left and right, there are snow-white powder walls, and the tiger skin stones below are built according to the trend. Then he ordered the door to open, only to see the green mountains standing in front of him. All the guests of the Qing Dynasty said: ""A good mountain, a good mountain!"" Jia Zheng said: ""It's not a mountain, and once you enter the garden and see all the scenery in your eyes, it's interesting."" Everyone said: ""Extremely. There are so many gorges and valleys, how can I think of this.” After speaking, I looked forward and saw the white rock ridges, either like ghosts or beasts, standing vertically and horizontally, with moss mottled on them, vines hidden by vines, and a small path of sheep intestines exposed. Jia Zhengdao: ""We will swim from this trail, and go out from that side when we come back, so that we can explore the whole thing.""","As soon as they reached the garden gate, and he caught sight of Chia Chen, standing on one side, along with several managers: “See that the garden gate is closed for a time,” Chia Cheng exclaimed, “for we’ll first see the outside and then go in.” Chia Chen directed a servant to close the gate, and Chia Cheng first looked straight ahead of him towards the gate and espied on the same side as the main entrance a suite of five apartments. Above, the cylindrical tiles resembled the backs of mud eels. The doors, railings, windows, and frames were all finely carved with designs of the new fashion, and were painted neither in vermilion nor in white colours. The whole extent of the walls was of polished bricks of uniform colour; while below, the white marble on the terrace and steps was engraved with western foreign designs; and when he came to look to the right and to the left, everything was white as snow. At the foot of the white-washed walls, tiger-skin pebbles were, without regard to pattern, promiscuously inserted in the earth in such a way as of their own selves to form streaks. Nothing fell in with the custom of gaudiness and display so much in vogue, so that he naturally felt full of delight; and, when he forthwith asked that the gate should be thrown open, all that met their eyes was a long stretch of verdant hills, which shut in the view in front of them. “What a fine hill, what a pretty hill!” exclaimed all the companions with one voice. “Were it not for this one hill,” Chia Cheng explained, “whatever scenery is contained in it would clearly strike the eye, as soon as one entered into the garden, and what pleasure would that have been?” “Quite so,” rejoined all of them. “But without large hills and ravines in one’s breast (liberal capacities), how could one attain such imagination!” After the conclusion of this remark, they cast a glance ahead of them, and perceived white rugged rocks looking, either like goblins, or resembling savage beasts, lying either crossways, or in horizontal or upright positions; on the surface of which grew moss and lichen with mottled hues, or parasitic plants, which screened off the light; while, slightly visible, wound, among the rocks, a narrow pathway like the intestines of a sheep. “If we were now to go and stroll along by this narrow path,” Chia Cheng suggested, “and to come out from over there on our return, we shall have been able to see the whole grounds.”","As soon as they reached the gate they found Cousin Zhen at the head of a group of overseers waiting to learn Jia Zheng’s wishes. ‘I want you to close the gate,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘so that we can see what it looks like from outside before we go in.’ Cousin Zhen ordered the gate to be closed, and Jia Zheng stood back and studied it gravely. It was a five-frame gate-building with a hump-backed roof of half-cylinder tiles. The wooden lattice-work of the doors and windows was finely carved and ingeniously patterned. The whole gatehouse was quite unadorned by colour or gilding, yet all was of the most exquisite workmanship. Its walls stood on a terrace of white marble carved with a pattern of passion-flowers in relief, and the garden’s whitewashed circumference wall to left and right of it had a footing made of black-and-white striped stone blocks arranged so that the stripes formed a simple pattern. Jia Zheng found the unostentatious simplicity of this entrance greatly to his liking, and after ordering the gates to be opened, passed on inside. A cry of admiration escaped them as they entered, for there, immediately in front of them, screening everything else from their view, rose a steep, verdure-clad hill. ‘Without this hill,’ Jia Zheng somewhat otiosely observed, ‘the whole garden would be visible as one entered, and all its mystery would be lost.’ The literary gentlemen concurred. ‘Only a master of the art of landscape could have conceived so bold a stroke,’ said one of them. As they gazed at this miniature mountain, they observed a great number of large white rocks in all kinds of grotesque and monstrous shapes, rising course above course up one of its sides, some recumbent, some upright or leaning at angles, their surfaces streaked and spotted with moss and lichen or half concealed by creepers, and with a narrow, zig-zag path only barely discernible to the eye winding up between them. ‘Let us begin our tour by following this path,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘If we work our way round towards the other side of the hill on our way back, we shall have made a complete circuit of the garden.’"
賈瑞聽了，魂不附體，只說：「好侄兒，只說沒有見我，明日我重重的謝你。」賈薔道：「你若謝我，放你不值什麼，只不知你謝我多少？況且口說無憑，寫一文契來。」賈瑞道：「這如何落紙呢？」賈薔道：「這也不妨，寫一個賭錢輸了外人帳目，借頭家銀若干兩便罷。」賈瑞道：「這也容易。衹是此時無紙筆。」賈薔道：「這也容易。」說罷，翻身出來，紙筆現成，拿來命賈瑞寫。他兩作好作歹，只寫了五十兩，然後畫了押，賈薔收起來。,"When Jia Rui heard this, he just said, ""Good nephew, I just said that I didn't see me. I will thank you very much tomorrow."" Jia Qiang said, ""If you thank me, it's not worth letting you go, I just don't know if you thank me. How much? Besides, there is no proof, so write a deed."" Jia Rui said, ""How do I get the paper?"" Jia Qiang said, ""It's okay, write an account of a foreigner who lost money in gambling, and borrow a few taels of silver from the first house. Jia Rui said: ""This is also easy. It's just that there is no pen and paper at this time."" Jia Qiang said, ""This is also easy."" After saying that, she turned over, the pen and paper were ready, and she ordered Jia Rui to write. He did both good and bad. He only wrote fifty taels, and then he drew and Jia Qiang put it away.","After Chia Jui had heard these words, his very soul could not be contained within his body. “My dear nephew,” he entreated, “do tell her that it wasn’t I; and I’ll show you my gratitude to-morrow in a substantial manner.” “Letting you off,” rejoined Chia Se, “is no difficult thing; but how much, I wonder, are you likely to give? Besides, what you now utter with your lips, there will be no proof to establish; so you had better write a promissory note.” “How could I put what happened in black and white on paper?” observed Chia Jui. “There’s no difficulty about that either!” replied Chia Se; “just write an account of a debt due, for losses in gambling, to some one outside; for payment of which you had to raise funds, by a loan of a stated number of taels, from the head of the house; and that will be all that is required.” “This is, in fact, easy enough!” Chia Jui having added by way of answer; Chia Se turned round and left the room; and returning with paper and pencils, which had been got ready beforehand for the purpose, he bade Chia Jui write. The two of them (Chia Jung and Chia Se) tried, the one to do a good turn, and the other to be perverse in his insistence; but (Chia Jui) put down no more than fifty taels, and appended his signature.","At these words Jia Rui’s soul almost left its seat in his body. ‘My dear nephew, just tell her that you didn’t find me here!’ he said. ‘Tomorrow I will reward you handsomely.’ ‘I suppose I could let you go easily enough,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘The question is, how big would this reward be? In any case, just saying that you will give me a reward is no good. I should want a written guarantee.’ ‘But I can’t put a thing like this down in writing!’ ‘No problem there,’ said Jia Qiang. ‘Just say that you’ve lost money gambling and have borrowed such and such an amount to cover your losses. That’s all you need do.’ ‘I could do that, certainly,’ said Jia Rui. Jia Qiang at once disappeared and reappeared only a moment later with paper and a writing-brush which had evidently been made ready in advance. Writing at his dictation Jia Rui was compelled, in spite of protests, to put down fifty taels of silver as the amount on the IOU. The document, having been duly signed, was at once pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong."
裏面鳳姐見日期有限，也預先逐細分派料理，一面又派榮府中車轎人從跟王夫人送殯，又顧自己送殯去佔下處。目今正值繕國公誥命亡故，王邢二夫人又去打祭送殯；西安郡王妃華誕，送壽禮；鎮國公誥命生了長男，預備賀禮；又有胞兄王仁連家眷回南，一面寫家信稟叩父母並帶往之物；又有迎春染病，每日請醫服藥，看醫生啟帖、症源、藥案等事，亦難盡述。又兼發引在邇。因此忙的鳳姐茶飯也沒工夫喫得，坐臥不能清淨。剛到了寧府，榮府的人又跟到寧府；既回到榮府，寧府的人又找到榮府。鳳姐見如此，心中倒十分歡喜，並不偷安推託，恐落人褒貶，因此日夜不暇，籌畫得十分的整肅。於是合族上下無不稱嘆者。,"Seeing that the date was limited, Sister Feng also dispatched the dishes one by one in advance. On the one hand, she sent the sedan car from the Rong Mansion to deliver the funeral to Mrs. Wang, and she also took care of herself to deliver the funeral to occupy the lower place. At present, it is the death of Duke Shanguo's death, and Mrs. Wang Xing goes to the funeral again; the princess of Xi'an County celebrates her birthday and presents birthday gifts; Duke Zhen has given birth to the eldest son and prepares a gift; and her elder brother Wang Renlian's family members returned to the south. I write a letter to my parents and tell me what I brought to my parents. I also get sick in the spring, and I ask the doctor to take medicine every day. And at the same time caused by. Therefore, Feng Jie, who is busy, has no time to eat tea and rice, and cannot sit and lie clean. When they just arrived at Ning Mansion, the people from Rong Mansion followed them to Ning Mansion; after returning to Rong Mansion, the people from Ning Mansion found Rong Mansion again. Seeing this, Sister Feng was very happy in her heart. Therefore, all the people in the clan are full of admiration.","Lady Feng, seeing that the day was not far distant, also apportioned duties and made provision for everything beforehand with circumspect care; while at the same time she chose in the Jung mansion, such carriages, sedan chairs and retinue as were to accompany the cortege, in attendance upon madame Wang, and gave her mind furthermore to finding a place where she herself could put up in at the time of the funeral. About this very time, it happened that the consort of the Duke Shan Kuo departed this life, and that mesdames Wang and Hsing had likewise to go and offer sacrifices, and to follow the burial procession; that the birthday occurred of the consort of Prince Hsi An; that presents had to be forwarded on the occasion of this anniversary; and that the consort of the Duke of Chen Kuo gave birth to a first child, a son, and congratulatory gifts had, in like manner, to be provided. Besides, her uterine brother Wang Jen was about to return south, with all his family, and she had too to write her home letters, to send her reverent compliments to her father and mother, as well as to get the things ready that were to be taken along. There was also Ying Ch’un, who had contracted some illness, and the doctor had every day to be sent for, and medicines to be administered, the notes of the doctor to be looked after, consisting of the bulletins of the diagnosis and the prescriptions, with the result that the various things that had to be attended to by lady Feng were so manifold that it would, indeed, be difficult to give an exhaustive idea of them. In addition to all this, the day for taking the coffin away was close at hand, so that lady Feng was so hard pressed for time that she had even no desire for any tea to drink or anything to eat, and that she could not sit or rest in peace. As soon as she put her foot into the Ning mansion, the inmates of the Jung mansion would follow close upon her heels; and the moment she got back into the Jung mansion, the servants again of the Ning mansion would follow her about. In spite however of this great pressure, lady Feng, whose natural disposition had ever been to try and excel, was urged to strain the least of her energies, as her sole dread was lest she should incur unfavourable criticism from any one; and so excellent were the plans she devised, that every one in the clan, whether high or low, readily conceded her unlimited praise.","They were instructed to work on the job throughout the night in order to make sure that it was finished in time. He also sent out a number of kitchen staff to cater for the funeral party on its arrival. Xi-feng, too, began to make her own careful preparations as the day of the funeral drew near. On the one hand she had to select coachmen and bearers from the Rong-guo staff for the carriages and sedans that Lady Wang and the other Rong-guo ladies would ride in in the procession. On the other hand, as she fully intended to take part in it herself, she had to find herself somewhere to stop at on the way as well as accommodation for the night after the funeral. The Dowager-duchess of Shan-guo happened to die just about this time and Xi-feng had to make the arrangements for Lady Xing and Lady Wang when they paid their visits of condolence and later when they attended the funeral. She had to see about birthday presents for the Princess of Xi-an. She had to write to her parents and get things ready to send to them when her elder brother Wang Ren returned with his wife and children to the South. And when on top of all this Jia Lian’s young sister Ying-chun fell ill and needed doctors’ visits and medicines every day, it was Xi-feng who had to puzzle over the diagnostic reports, discuss the patient’s symptoms with the learned physicians, and decide on the relative merits of rival prescriptions. Indeed, so multifarious had her activities become that it would be impossible to list them all. As a consequence she was far too busy to pay much attention to eating and drinking and could hardly sit or lie down for a moment in peace. When she went to the Ning-guo mansion she was followed around all the time by people from the Rong-guo mansion, and when she went back to Rong-guo House, members of the Ning-guo establishment would trail after her. Yet although she was so busy, a passion to succeed and a dread of being criticized enabled her to summon up reserves of energy, and she managed to plan everything with such exemplary thoroughness that every member of the clan was loud in her praises."
那鳳姐必知今日人客不少，在家中歇宿一夜，至寅正，平兒便請起來梳洗。及收拾完備，更衣盥手，喫了兩口奶子糖粳米粥，漱口已畢，已是卯正二刻了。來旺媳婦率領諸人伺候已久。鳳姐出至廳前，上了車，前面打了一對明角燈，大書「榮國府」三個大字，款款來至寧府。大門上門燈朗掛，兩邊一色戳燈，照如白晝，白汪汪穿孝僕從兩邊侍立。請車至正門上，小廝等退去，眾媳婦上來揭起車簾。鳳姐下了車，一手扶著豐兒，兩個媳婦執著手把燈罩，簇擁著鳳姐進來。寧府諸媳婦迎來請安接待。,"Sister Feng must know that there are a lot of people today, so she stayed at home for one night, and when Yinzheng arrived, Pinger invited him to get up and wash up. After cleaning up, changing clothes and washing hands, eating two mouthfuls of milk and sugar japonica rice porridge, and rinsing my mouth, it is already two quarters. Laiwang's daughter-in-law has led everyone to serve for a long time. Sister Feng went out to the front of the hall and got into the car. A pair of bright horn lamps were lit in front of them. The three characters ""Rongguo Fu"" were written in large letters, and they came to Ningfu. The lights on the door are hung brightly, and the lights are poked on both sides, and the light is like daytime. Please bring the car to the front door, the servant waits to retreat, and the daughters-in-law come up and lift the curtain of the car. Sister Feng got out of the car, holding Feng'er with one hand, while the two daughters-in-law held the lampshade in their hands, and surrounded Sister Feng and came in. The daughters-in-law of the Ning Mansion greeted them.","Lady Feng, well aware that not a few guests would call on this day, was quick to get out of bed at four sharp, to dress her hair and perform her ablutions. After having completed every arrangement for the day, she changed her costume, washed her hands, and swallowed a couple of mouthfuls of milk. By the time she had rinsed her mouth, it was exactly 6.30; and Lai Wang’s wife, at the head of a company of servants, had been waiting a good long while , when lady Feng appeared in front of the Entrance Hall, mounted her carriage and betook herself, preceded by a pair of transparent horn lanterns, on which were written, in large type, the three characters, Jung Kuo mansion, to the main entrance gate of the Ning Household. The door lanterns shed brilliant rays from where they were suspended; while on either side the lanterns, of uniform colours, propped upright, emitted a lustrous light as bright as day. The servants of the family, got up in their mourning clothes, covered the ground far and wide like a white sheet. They stood drawn in two rows, and requested that the carriage should drive up to the main entrance. The youths retired, and all the married women came forward, and raising the curtain of the carriage, lady Feng alighted; and as with one arm she supported herself on Feng Erh, two married women, with lanterns in their hands, lighted the way. Pressed round by the servants, lady Feng made her entry. The married women of the Ning mansion advanced to greet her, and to pay their respects; and this over, lady Feng, with graceful bearing, entered the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance.","Knowing that the day would be a busy one bringing a greater than usual number of visitors, Xi-feng had risen at four o’clock in the morning to begin her toilet. By the time she had completed it, paid her daily tribute to nature, washed her hands, drunk a few mouthfuls of milk, and rinsed out her mouth , it was already half past six and Brightie’s wife, at the head of the other female domestics, had been waiting for some considerable time in the courtyard outside. At last she emerged and stepped into the waiting carriage. Two horn lanterns inscribed in large characters with the words RONG-GUO HOUSE were borne before her as she went. The great gate of the Ning-guo mansion was hung with lanterns and there were rows of identical standard lanterns on each side of the gateway illuminating the entrance with the brightness of noonday and eerily emphasizing the whiteness of the mourning-clothes worn by the menservants lined up to receive the carriage. At their invitation it was drawn in through the centremost of the three gates. Then the men-servants retired and Xi-feng’s own women hurried forward and raised the curtain of the carriage for her to descend. She did so, leaning on the shoulder of her maid Felicity, and the two women with the lanterns led her in, lighting the way for her as they went, while her other women closed in behind her and the women of the Ning-guo household advanced to meet her, curtseyed, and chorused their morning greetings."
正鬧的天翻地覆，沒個開交，只聞得隱隱的木魚聲響，唸了一句：「南無解冤孽菩薩。有那人口不利，家宅顛傾，或逢凶險，或中邪祟者，我們善能醫治。」賈母、王夫人聽見這些話，那裏還耐得住，便命人去快請進來。賈政雖不自在，奈賈母之言如何違拗；想如此深宅，何得聽的這樣真切，心中亦希罕，命人請了進來，眾人舉目看時，原來是一個癩頭和尚與一個跛足道人。見那和尚是怎的模樣：鼻如懸膽兩眉長，目似明星蓄寶光，破衲芒鞋無住跡，腌臜更有滿頭瘡。,"The world was turning upside down, and there was no communication, only the faint sound of wooden fish was heard, and he read a sentence: ""Nanwu Jiejie Bodhisattva. There are people who are unfavorable, their homes are ruined, or they are in danger or evil, we can heal them. When Mu Jia and Madam Wang heard these words, they were still able to bear it, so they ordered someone to come in quickly. Although Jia Zheng was not at ease, the words of his mother Nai Jia’s words were so unreasonable; he wanted to be so deep in the house, how could he listen to it so earnestly, and he was uneasy in his heart, so he ordered someone to come in, and when everyone looked up, it turned out to be a leper-headed monk and a lame man. Foot man. See what the monk looks like: his nose is like a gallbladder, his eyebrows are long, his eyes are like a star with treasures, his shoes have no signs of living, and the pickled scorpion is even full of sores.","A stir ensued sufficient to convulse the heavens and to subvert the earth. But at an unforeseen moment resounded in the air the gentle rapping of a ‘wooden fish’ bell. A voice recited the sentence: “Ave! Buddha able to unravel retribution and dispel grievances! Should any human being lie in sickness, and his family be solicitous on his account; or should any one have met with evil spirits and come across any baleful evils, we have the means to effect a cure.” Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang at once directed servants to go out into the street and find out who it was. It turned out to be, in fact, a mangy-headed bonze and a hobbling Taoist priest. What was the appearance of the bonze? His nose like a suspended gall; his two eyebrows so long, His eyes, resembling radiant stars, possessed a precious glow, His coat in tatters and his shoes of straw, without a home; Rolling in filth, and, a worse fate, his head one mass of boils.","Suddenly, as she raged and stormed, the faint tock tock of a holy man’s wooden fish was heard upon the air and a high monotone chant that kept time with the beat: ‘Na-mah A-mi-ta-bha Bo-dhi-satt-va! Mer-ci-ful de-li-ve-rer ! All a-fflic-ted and tor-men-ted, All a-ttacked by e-vil spi-rits, All de-mo-ni-ac po-sse-ssion, I cure, I cure, I cure.’ Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang at once sent someone into the street to see who it was. The source of the chanting proved to be a disreputable-looking Buddhist monk. Stone describes him in the following quatrain: A bottle nose he had and shaggy brows, Through which peeped eyes that twinkled like bright stars. His robe was patched and torn, his feet straw-shod, His unclean pate blotched with unsightly scars. He was accompanied by a lame Taoist, for whom a similar quatrain has been supplied by our poetical Stone:"
鳳姐道：「常聽見我們太爺們也這樣說，豈有不信的。只納罕他家怎麼就這麼富貴呢？」趙嬤嬤道：「告訴奶奶一句話，也不過是拿著皇帝家的銀子往皇帝身上使罷了！誰家有那些錢買這個虛熱鬧去？」,"Sister Feng said: ""I often hear our grandfathers say the same thing, how can you not believe it. I just wonder why his family is so rich?"" Mama Zhao said, ""If you tell grandma a word, it's just to take the money from the emperor's family. It's just an ambassador for the emperor! Who has the money to buy this fake fun?""","“I’ve often heard,” continued lady Feng, “my eldest uncle say that things were in such a state, and how couldn’t I believe? but what surprises me is how it ever happened that this family attained such opulence and honour!” “I’ll tell your ladyship and all in one sentence,” replied nurse Chao. “Why they simply took the Emperor’s money and spent it for the Emperor’s person, that’s all! for what family has such a lot of money as to indulge in this useless extravagance?”","‘I believe you,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve heard my grandfather talk about it, and he said it was just like that. But it still amazes me that a single family could have so much wealth.’ ‘I’ll tell you something, Mrs Lian,’ said the knowledgeable Nannie. ‘Twere no more than paying for the Emperor’s entertainment with the Emperor’s own silver. No family that ever lived had money enough of its own to pay for such spectacles of vanity!’"
到了寧府，進了車門，到了東邊小角門前下了車，進去見了賈珍之妻尤氏。也未敢氣高，殷殷勤勤敘過寒溫，說了些閑話，方問道：「今日怎麼沒見蓉大奶奶？」尤氏說道：「他這些日子不知怎麼著，經期有兩個多月沒來。叫大夫瞧了，又說並不是喜。那兩日，到了下半天就懶待動，話也懶待說，眼神也發眩。我說他：『你且不必拘禮，早晚不必照例上來，你就好生養養罷。就是有親戚一家兒來，有我呢。就有長輩們怪你，等我替你告訴。』連蓉哥我都囑咐了，我說：『你不許累掯他，不許招他生氣，叫他靜靜的養養就好了。他要想什麼喫，只管到我這裏取來。倘或我這裏沒有，只管望你璉二嬸子那裏要去。倘或他有個好和歹，你再要娶這麼一個媳婦，這麼個模樣兒，這麼個性情的人兒，打著燈籠也沒地方找去。』他這為人行事，那個親戚，那個一家的長輩不喜歡他？所以我這兩日好不煩心，焦的我了不得。偏偏今日早晨他兄弟來瞧他，誰知那小孩子家不知好歹，看見他姐姐身上不大爽快，就有事也不當告訴他，別說是這麼一點子小事，就是你受了一萬分的委曲，也不該向他說纔是。誰知他們昨兒學房裏打架，不知是那裏附學來的一個人欺侮了他了。裏頭還有些不乾不淨的話，都告訴了他姐姐。嬸子，你是知道那媳婦的：雖則見了人有說有笑，會行事兒，他可心細，心又重，不拘聽見個什麼話兒，都要度量個三日五夜纔罷。這病就是打這個秉性上頭思慮出來的。今兒聽見有人欺負了他兄弟，又是惱，又是氣。惱的是那群混帳狐朋狗友的扯是搬非、調三惑四的那些人；氣的是他兄弟不學好，不上心唸書，以致如此學裏吵鬧。他聽了這事，今日索性連早飯也沒喫。我聽見了，我方到他那邊安慰了他一會子，又勸解了他兄弟一會子。我叫他兄弟到那邊府裏找寶玉去了，我纔看著他喫了半盞燕窩湯，我纔過來了。嬸子，你說我心焦不心焦？況且如今又沒個好大夫，我想到他這病上，我心裏倒象針紮似的。你們知道有什麼好大夫沒有？」,"Arrived at Ning Mansion, entered the car door, got out of the car in front of Xiaojiaomen in the east, and went in to meet Jia Zhen's wife You. He didn't dare to get angry. He diligently talked about the cold and warm, and after some gossip, Fang asked, ""Why didn't you see Grandma Rong today?"" You said, ""He doesn't know what's going on these days. Come on. I asked the doctor to take a look, and said that it was not a joy. In the second half of the day, I was too lazy to move, I was too lazy to talk, and my eyes were dizzy. I said to him: ""You don't have to be polite, you don't have to come up as usual sooner or later."" , you just have to give birth and support. Even if there are relatives and families coming, there is me. Some elders blame you, wait for me to tell you.” Even Brother Rong I instructed, I said: “You are not allowed to burden him. , don't make him angry, just ask him to raise him quietly. Whatever he wants to eat, just come and get it from me. If I don't have it here, I just want your second aunt to go there. If he has a good one He Ye, if you want to marry such a daughter-in-law, who looks like this, and has such a temperament, there is nowhere to find a person with a lantern.” He behaves like this, that relative, that elder of that family doesn’t like him? That's why I've been worried for the past two days. I've been very anxious. But this morning, his brother came to see him. Who knows that the child's house is not good or bad. Seeing that his sister is not very happy, he should not tell him anything, let alone say yes. Even if you suffer 10,000 points of humiliation, you shouldn't tell him about such a trivial matter. Who knew they had a fight in the school room yesterday, and I don't know if someone from the attached school bullied him. There are still some He told his sister all the dirty things. Auntie, you know that daughter-in-law: even though he talks, laughs and does things when he sees people, he is careful and heavy-hearted. He doesn't care what he hears. It takes three days and five nights to measure it. This disease is the result of thinking about this nature. Today, I hear someone bullying his brother, and I am angry and angry. I am annoyed by the bullshit of those bastard friends. Those people who are arrogant and confused; they are angry that his brother doesn't study well, and he doesn't study hard, so he makes a lot of noise in his studies. Hearing this, he didn't even eat breakfast today. I heard, our party I went to his place and comforted him for a while, and then persuaded his brother for a while. I told his brother to go to the house over there to find Baoyu, and I watched him eat half a cup of bird's nest soup, and I came here. Auntie, do you think I'm anxious? Besides, there is no good doctor right now. When I think about his illness, I feel like a needle sticks in my heart. Do you know any good doctors?""","On her arrival at the Ning Mansion, she entered by the eastern side gate, and dismounting from the carriage, she went in to call on Mrs. Yu, the spouse of Chia Chen, with whom she had not the courage to put on any high airs; but gently and quietly she made inquiries after her health, and after passing some irrelevant remarks, she ascertained: “How is it I don’t see lady Jung to-day?” “I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Yu, “what’s the matter with her these last few days; but she hasn’t been herself for two months and more; and the doctor who was asked to see her declares that it is nothing connected with any happy event. A couple of days back, she felt, as soon as the afternoon came, both to move, and both even to utter a word; while the brightness of her eyes was all dimmed; and I told her, ‘You needn’t stick to etiquette, for there’s no use for you to come in the forenoon and evening, as required by conventionalities; but what you must do is, to look after your own health. Should any relative come over, there’s also myself to receive them; and should any of the senior generation think your absence strange, I’ll explain things for you, if you’ll let me.’ “I also advised brother Jung on the subject: ‘You shouldn’t,’ I said, ‘allow any one to trouble her; nor let her be put out of temper, but let her quietly attend to her health, and she’ll get all right. Should she fancy anything to eat, just come over here and fetch it; for, in the event of anything happening to her, were you to try and find another such a wife to wed, with such a face and such a disposition, why, I fear, were you even to seek with a lantern in hand, there would really be no place where you could discover her. And with such a temperament and deportment as hers, which of our relatives and which of our elders don’t love her?’ That’s why my heart has been very distressed these two days! As luck would have it early this morning her brother turned up to see her, but who would have fancied him to be such a child, and so ignorant of what is proper and not proper to do? He saw well enough that his sister was not well; and what’s more all these matters shouldn’t have been recounted to her; for even supposing he had received the gravest offences imaginable, it behoved him anyhow not to have broached the subject to her! Yesterday, one would scarcely believe it, a fight occurred in the school-room, and some pupil or other who attends that class, somehow insulted him; besides, in this business, there were a good many indecent and improper utterances, but all these he went and told his sister! Now, sister-in-law, you are well aware that though (our son Jung’s) wife talks and laughs when she sees people, that she is nevertheless imaginative and withal too sensitive, so that no matter what she hears, she’s for the most part bound to brood over it for three days and five nights, before she loses sight of it, and it’s from this excessive sensitiveness that this complaint of hers arises. Today, when she heard that some one had insulted her brother, she felt both vexed and angry; vexed that those fox-like, cur-like friends of his had moved right and wrong, and intrigued with this one and deluded that one; angry that her brother had, by not learning anything profitable, and not having his mind set upon study, been the means of bringing about a row at school; and on account of this affair, she was so upset that she did not even have her early meal. I went over a short while back and consoled her for a time, and likewise gave her brother a few words of advice; and after having packed off that brother of hers to the mansion on the other side, in search of Pao-yue, and having stood by and seen her have half a bowl of birds’ nests soup, I at length came over. Now, sister-in-law, tell me, is my heart sore or not? Besides, as there’s nowadays no good doctor, the mere thought of her complaint makes my heart feel as if it were actually pricked with needles! But do you and yours, perchance, know of any good practitioner?”","Dismissing her sister-in-law’s entreaties, she sent the old servant-woman out for a cab, and getting inside, drove straight off to the Ning-guo mansion. But by the time she had reached it, driven in at the east end gate, dismounted from the carriage and gone in to see You-shi, the edge had already worn off her anger, and it was only after deferential inquiries about the health and comfort of her hostess and various other inconsequential matters that she got around to asking what had become of Qin-shi, who was usually in evidence during her visits. ‘I don’t know what’s the matter with her lately,’ said You-shi. ‘It’s been more than two months now since she had a period, yet the doctors say she isn’t pregnant. And during the last few days she’s been getting so tired and listless in the afternoons: doesn’t feel like doing anything; doesn’t even feel like talking; all the spirit seems to have gone out of her. I’ve said to her, “Never mind about wifely duties. Just forget about the morning and evening visits and concentrate on getting better. Even when relations call,” I said, “I can see to them myself. And never mind what the older members of the family might say: I’ll do all the explaining for you.” I’ve spoken to Rong, as well. “You’re not to tire her out,” I told him, “and you’re not to let her get upset I She must just rest quietly for a few days and look after herself. And if there’s anything she fancies to eat , just come to my apartment to get it. Because if anything should happen to her,” I said, “you wouldn’t find another wife like that, with her looks and her good nature, if you took a lantern to look for her.” She’s such a sweet person, there isn’t anyone among our relations or among the older members of the family who doesn’t love her. I’ve been so worried on her account these last few days. And just to make matters worse, first thing this morning her young brother comes along – Silly little boy! he ought to have realized that his sister wasn’t well and not in a condition to listen to such things, even if he’d suffered ten thousand times the injustice! -It seems that yesterday there was a fight at the school. One of the external students – I don’t know which one it was – had been bullying him; and there were a lot of other very nasty things as well. So he had to go and tell all this to his sister. Well, you know how sensitive she is, my dear, in spite of the fact that she always seems so lively and full of fun to talk to. The slightest little thing can upset her and set her brooding on it for whole days and nights together. In fact, this illness has been brought on by too much worrying, I’m sure of it. Well, this morning when she heard that someone had been bullying her brother, it both upset her and at the same time made her angry. She was upset to think that those horrible boys at the school should be able to twist things round and say such terrible things about him, but she was also angry with him, because she said he must have been getting into bad ways and not giving bis mind properly to his studies to have got into trouble of this sort in the first place. So of course, because of this upset she wouldn’t have any breakfast. I’ve just been round there trying to calm her. I gave her brother a talking-to and sent him round to see Bao-yu, and I stood over her while she ate half a bowlful of bird’s-nest soup. I’ve only just this minute got back. Oh, I’m so worried about her, my dear! We haven’t got a good doctor at the moment, either. It pierces me to the heart when I think about that child’s illness! I suppose you don’t happen to know of a good doctor, do you ?’"
元妃乃命傳筆硯侍候，親搦湘管，擇其幾處最喜者賜名。按其書云：,"Concubine Yuan was ordered to pass on a brush and inkstone to serve, and personally took care of the Xiangguan, and chose the most favorite people to give them names. According to its book cloud:","The Imperial consort Yuan subsequently directed that the pencils and inkslabs should be brought, and with her own hands she opened the silken paper. She chose the places she liked, and conferred upon them a name; and devising a general designation for the garden, she called it the Ta Kuan garden (Broad vista), while for the tablet of the main pavilion the device she composed ran as follows: “Be mindful of the grace and remember the equity (of His Majesty);” with this inscription on the antithetical scrolls: Mercy excessive Heaven and earth display, And it men young and old hail gratefully; From old till now they pour their bounties great Those rich gifts which Cathay and all states permeate.","While they were still drinking, Yuan-chun sent for writing materials, and taking up a brush, began in her own hand to write out some names for the parts of the garden she had liked the best.

一日，早又中秋佳節。士隱家宴已畢，乃又另具一席於書房，卻自己步月至廟中來邀雨村。原來雨村自那日見了甄家之婢曾回顧他兩次，自為是個知己，便時刻放在心上。今又正值中秋，不免對月有懷，因而口佔五言一律云：「未卜三生願，頻添一段愁。悶來時斂額，行去幾回頭。自顧風前影，誰堪月下儔？蟾光如有意，先上玉人樓。」雨村吟罷，因又思及平生抱負，苦未逢時，乃又搔首對天長嘆，復高吟一聯曰：「玉在櫝中求善價，釵於奩內待時飛。」恰值士隱走來聽見，笑道：「雨村兄真抱負不淺也！」雨村忙笑道：「不過偶吟前人之句，何敢狂誕至此。」因問：「老先生何興至此？」士隱笑道：「今夜中秋，俗謂『團圓之節』，想尊兄旅寄僧房，不無寂寥之感，故特具小酌，邀兄到敝齋一飲，不知可納芹意否？」雨村聽了，並不推辭，便笑道：「既蒙厚愛，何敢拂此盛情。」說著，便同士隱復過這邊書院中來。,"One day, early and mid-autumn festival. Shiyin's family banquet was over, so he had another seat in the study, but he walked to the temple to invite Yucun by himself. It turned out that Amamura had met the maid of the Zhen family and reviewed him twice since that day. Since he was a confidant, he always took it to heart. Today is Mid-Autumn Festival, and I can't help but have feelings for the moon, so my mouth is full of five words: ""Uncertain the three life wishes, often add a period of sorrow. When the boredom comes, hold your forehead, go back a few times. Take care of the wind in front of you, who can bear it. Yuexia? Ask for a good price, and the hairpins will fly when they stay in the hut.” When Shiyin came to hear it, he said with a smile, “Brother Yucun is really ambitious!” Yucun hurriedly laughed and said, “I just recite the words of my predecessors, why? Dare to be born here.” Because he asked, “Why did the old man come here?” Shiyin smiled and said, “Tonight’s Mid-Autumn Festival is commonly known as the ‘Festival of Reunion’. Let’s drink, invite my brother to our restaurant for a drink, I wonder if it’s acceptable?” After hearing this, Amamura did not refuse, and smiled, “Since you have received so much love, why would you dare to show this kindness.” After speaking, he went back with the scholar. Come from the academy here.","In time the mid-autumn festivities drew near; and Shih-yin, after the family banquet was over, had a separate table laid in the library, and crossed over, in the moonlight, as far as the temple and invited Yue-ts’un to come round. The fact is that Yue-ts’un, ever since the day on which he had seen the girl of the Chen family turn twice round to glance at him, flattered himself that she was friendly disposed towards him, and incessantly fostered fond thoughts of her in his heart. And on this day, which happened to be the mid-autumn feast, he could not, as he gazed at the moon, refrain from cherishing her remembrance. Hence it was that he gave vent to these pentameter verses: Alas! not yet divined my lifelong wish, And anguish ceaseless comes upon anguish I came, and sad at heart, my brow I frowned; She went, and oft her head to look turned round. Facing the breeze, her shadow she doth watch, Who’s meet this moonlight night with her to match? The lustrous rays if they my wish but read Would soon alight upon her beauteous head! Yue-ts’un having, after this recitation, recalled again to mind how that throughout his lifetime his literary attainments had had an adverse fate and not met with an opportunity (of reaping distinction), went on to rub his brow, and as he raised his eyes to the skies, he heaved a deep sigh and once more intoned a couplet aloud: The gem in the cask a high price it seeks, The pin in the case to take wing it waits. As luck would have it, Shih-yin was at the moment approaching, and upon hearing the lines, he said with a smile: “My dear Yue-ts’un, really your attainments are of no ordinary capacity.” Yue-ts’un lost no time in smiling and replying. “It would be presumption in my part to think so,” he observed. “I was simply at random humming a few verses composed by former writers, and what reason is there to laud me to such an excessive degree? To what, my dear Sir, do I owe the pleasure of your visit?” he went on to inquire. “Tonight,” replied Shih-yin, “is the mid-autumn feast, generally known as the full-moon festival; and as I could not help thinking that living, as you my worthy brother are, as a mere stranger in this Buddhist temple, you could not but experience the feeling of loneliness. I have, for the express purpose, prepared a small entertainment, and will be pleased if you will come to my mean abode to have a glass of wine. But I wonder whether you will entertain favourably my modest invitation?” Yue-ts’un, after listening to the proposal, put forward no refusal of any sort; but remarked complacently: “Being the recipient of such marked attention, how can I presume to repel your generous consideration?” As he gave expression to these words, he walked off there and then, in company with Shih-yin, and came over once again into the court in front of the library. In a few minutes, tea was over.","But then the Mid Autumn festival arrived and, after the family convivialities were over, Shi-yin had a little dinner for two laid out in his study and went in person to invite Yu-cun, walking to his temple lodgings in the moonlight. Ever since the day the Zhens’ maid had, by looking back twice over her shoulder, convinced him that she was a friend, Yu-cun had had the girl very much on his mind, and now that it was festival time, the full moon of Mid Autumn lent an inspiration to his romantic impulses which finally resulted in the following octet: ‘ Ere on ambition’s path my feet are set, Sorrow comes often this poor heart to fret. Yet, as my brow contracted with new care, Was there not one who, parting, turned to stare ? Dare I, that grasp at shadows in the wind, Hope, underneath the moon, a friend to find? Bright orb, if with my plight you sympathize, Shine first upon the chamber where she lies.’ Having delivered himself of this masterpiece, Yu-cun’s thoughts began to run on his unrealized ambitions and, after much head-scratching and many heavenward glances accompanied by heavy sighs, he produced the following couplet, reciting it in a loud, ringing voice which caught the ear of Shi-yin, who chanced at that moment to be arriving: ‘The jewel in the casket bides till one shall come to buy. The jade pin in the drawer hides, waiting its time to fly. ’2 Shi-yin smiled. ‘You are a man of no mean ambition, Yu-cun.’ ‘Oh no!’ Yu-cun smiled back deprecatingly. ‘You are too flattering. I was merely reciting at random from the lines of some old poet. But what brings you here, sir ?’ ‘Tonight is Mid Autumn night,’ said Shi-yin. ‘People call it the Festival of Reunion. It occurred to me that you might be feeling rather lonely here in your monkery, so I have arranged for the two of us to take a little wine together in my study. I hope you will not refuse to join me.’ Yu-cun made no polite pretence of declining. ‘Your kindness is nrore than I deserve,’ he said. ‘I accept gratefully.’ And he accompanied Shi-yin back to the study next door. Soon they had finished their tea."

It started on the third day, and was raised on the seventh day. At the moment, all the Jia family came to pay their respects. Jia She from the Rongguo government gave twenty taels of silver, Jia Zheng also had twenty taels, and Jia Zhen from the Ningguo government also had twenty taels. innumerable. In addition, each classmate's family shared the capital, and also made up twenty or thirty taels.

Chia She, of the Jung Mansion, presented twenty taels, and Chia Cheng also gave twenty taels. Of the Ning Mansion, Chia Chen likewise contributed twenty taels. The remainder of the members of the clan, of whom some were poor and some rich, and not equally well off, gave either one or two taels, or three or four, some more, some less.

The various members of the Jia family all came in due course to offer their condolences. From the Rong-guo side Jia She and Jia Zheng each gave twenty taels of silver and from the Ning-guo side Cousin Zhen also gave twenty taels.

〔紅樓夢引子〕　開闢鴻蒙，誰為情種？都只為風月情濃。趁著這奈何天，傷懷日，寂寥時，試遣愚衷。因此上，演出這悲金悼玉的《紅樓夢》。,"[Introduction to A Dream of Red Mansions] Open up Hongmeng, who is the seed of love? All just for the love of the wind and the moon. Taking advantage of this Naihe day, sadness, and loneliness, try to send foolishness. Therefore, the ""Dream of Red Mansions"", which is sad for gold and jade, is performed.","What was the germ of love? It arises entirely from the strength of licentious love. What day, by the will of heaven, I felt wounded at heart, and what time I was at leisure, I made an attempt to disburden my sad heart; and with this object in view I indited this Dream of the Bed Chamber, on the subject of a disconsolate gold trinket and an unfortunate piece of jade.","When first the world from chaos rose, Tell me, how did love begin ? The wind and moonlight first did love compose. Now woebegone And quite cast down In low estate I would my foolish heart expose, And so perform This Dream of Golden Days, And all my grief for my lost loves disclose."
說著，引人進入房內。只見這幾間房內收拾的與別處不同，竟分不出間隔來的。原來四面皆是雕空玲瓏木板，或「流雲百蝠」，或「歲寒三友」，或山水人物，或翎毛花卉，或集錦，或博古，或 各種花樣，皆是名手雕鏤，五彩銷金嵌寶的。一槅一槅，或有貯書處，或有設鼎處，或安置筆硯處，或供花設瓶、安放盆景處。其槅各式各樣，或天圓地方，或葵花蕉葉，或連環半璧。真是花團錦簇，剔透玲瓏。倏爾五色紗糊就，竟係小窗；倏爾彩綾輕覆，竟係幽戶。且滿牆滿壁，皆係隨依古董玩器之形摳成的槽子。諸如琴、劍、懸瓶、桌屏之類，雖懸於壁，卻都是與壁相平的。眾人都讚：「好精緻想頭！難為怎麼想來！」,"Saying that, he led people into the room. I saw that the cleaning in these rooms was different from that of other places, and there was no separation. It turns out that the four sides are all carved hollow and exquisite wooden boards, or ""Flowing Clouds and Hundred Bats"", or ""Three Friends of Suihan"", or landscape figures, or feathers and flowers, or collections, or Bogu, or various patterns, all of which are carved by famous hands and sold in colorful colors. Gold inlaid treasure. There is a place for storing books, a place for setting tripods, a place for placing pen and inkstone, or a place for flowers to set up vases and bonsai. There are various types of pillars, or the sky is round and the place is round, or sunflower and banana leaves, or a series of semi-circles. It's really colorful and exquisite. Suddenly the five-color gauze is pasted, and it is actually a small window; the colorful silk is lightly covered, and it is actually a secluded house. And it is full of walls, all of which are troughs cut out according to the shape of antique toys. Such as qin, sword, hanging bottle, table screen, etc., although hanging on the wall, but they are all level with the wall. Everyone praised: ""It's so exquisite! It's hard to think about it!""","it isn’t good!” Chia Cheng remonstrated as he shook his head; and while passing this remark, he conducted the party into the house, where they noticed that the internal arrangements effected differed from those in other places, as no partitions could, in fact, be discerned. Indeed, the four sides were all alike covered with boards carved hollow with fretwork, (in designs consisting) either of rolling clouds and hundreds of bats; or of the three friends of the cold season of the year, (fir, bamboo and almond); of scenery and human beings, or of birds or flowers; either of clusters of decoration, or of relics of olden times; either of ten thousand characters of happiness or of ten thousand characters of longevity. The various kinds of designs had been all carved by renowned hands, in variegated colours, inlaid with gold, and studded with precious gems; while on shelf upon shelf were either arranged collections of books, or tripods were laid out; either pens and inkslabs were distributed about, or vases with flowers set out, or figured pots were placed about; the designs of the shelves being either round or square; or similar to sunflowers or banana leaves; or like links, half overlapping each other. And in very truth they resembled bouquets of flowers or clusters of tapestry, with all their fretwork so transparent. Suddenly (the eye was struck) by variegated gauzes pasted (on the wood-work), actually forming small windows; and of a sudden by fine thin silks lightly overshadowing (the fretwork) just as if there were, after all, secret doors. The whole walls were in addition traced, with no regard to symmetry, with outlines of the shapes of curios and nick-nacks in imitation of lutes, double-edged swords, hanging bottles and the like, the whole number of which, though (apparently) suspended on the walls, were all however on a same level with the surface of the partition walls. “What fine ingenuity!” they all exclaimed extollingly; “what a labour they must have been to carry out!”","He led them inside the building. Its interior turned out to be all corridors and alcoves and galleries, so that properly speaking it could hardly have been said to have rooms at all. The partition walls which made these divisions were of wooden panelling exquisitely carved in a wide variety of motifs: bats in clouds, the ‘three friends of winter’ – pine, plum and bamboo, little figures in landscapes, birds and flowers, scrollwork, antique bronze shapes, ‘good luck’ and ‘long life’ characters, and many others. The carvings, all of them the work of master craftsmen, were beautified with inlays of gold, mother-o’-pearl and semi-precious stones. In addition to being panelled, the partitions were pierced by numerous apertures, some round, some square, some sunflower-shaped, some shaped like a fleur-de-lis , some cusped, some fan-shaped. Shelving was concealed in the double thickness of the partition at the base of these apertures, making it possible to use them for storing books and writing materials and for the display of antique bronzes, vases of flowers, miniature tray-gardens and the like. The overall effect was at once richly colourful and, because of the many apertures, airy and graceful. The trompe-l’ail effect of these ingenious partitions had been further enhanced by inserting false windows and doors in them, the former covered in various pastel shades of gauze, the latter hung with richly-patterned damask portières. The main walls were pierced with window-like perforations in the shape of zithers, swords, vases and other objects of virtù. The literary gentlemen were rapturous: ‘Exquisite!’ they cried. ‘What marvellous workmanship!’"
賈政因問：「跟寶玉的是誰？」只聽外面答應了兩聲，早進來三四個大漢，打千兒請安。賈政看時，認得是寶玉的奶母之子，名喚李貴。因向他道：「你們成日家跟他上學，他到底唸了些什麼書！倒唸了些流言混語在肚子裏，學了些精緻淘氣。等我閑一閑，先揭了你的皮，再和那不長進的算帳！」嚇的李貴忙雙膝跪下，摘了帽子，碰頭有聲，連連答應「是」，又回說：「哥兒已唸到第三本《詩經》，什麼『呦呦鹿鳴，荷葉浮萍』，小的不敢撒謊。」說的滿座哄然大笑起來。賈政也橕不住笑了。因說道：「那怕再唸三十本《詩經》，也都是掩耳盜鈴，哄人耳目。你去請學裏太爺的安，就說我說了：什麼《詩經》古文，一概不用虛應故事，衹是先把四書一氣講明背熟，是最要緊的。」李貴忙答應「是」。見賈政無話，方退出去。,"Jia Zhengyin asked, ""Who's with Baoyu?"" He only heard two words from the outside, and three or four big men came in early to greet Qian'er. When Jia Zheng looked at it, he recognized that it was the son of Baoyu's nanny, whose name was Li Gui. Yin said to him, ""You Chengri went to school with him, what books did he read! Instead, he read some gossip in his stomach, and learned some naughty things. When I have some free time, I will reveal yours first. Pi, let’s settle accounts with the poor one!” Li Gui hurriedly knelt down on his knees, took off his hat, met each other in a loud voice, repeatedly agreed “yes”, and replied, “Brother has already read the third book of the Book of Songs. "", ""Yo Yo Lu Ming, lotus leaf duckweed"", the little ones dare not lie."" The whole audience burst into laughter. Jia Zheng couldn't help but laugh. Yin said, ""Even if you recite thirty copies of the Book of Songs, you will still hide your ears and steal the bells and lull people's ears and eyes. You go and ask the master of the school to say that I have said: about the ancient texts of the ""Book of Songs"", there is no need to make false stories, only The most important thing is to explain the four books by heart."" Li Gui hurriedly agreed ""yes"". Seeing that Jia Zheng was speechless, Fang quit.","Chia Cheng having inquired, he heard a suitable reply, “We, Sir!” given from outside; and three or four sturdy fellows entered at an early period and fell on one knee, and bowed and paid their obeisance. When Chia Cheng came to scrutinise who they were, and he recognised Li Kuei, the son of Pao-yue’s nurse, he addressed himself to him. “You people,” he said, “remain waiting upon him the whole day long at school, but what books has he after all read? Books indeed! why, he has read and filled his brains with a lot of trashy words and nonsensical phrases, and learnt some ingenious way of waywardness. Wait till I have a little leisure, and I’ll set to work, first and foremost, and flay your skin off, and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing!” This threat so terrified Li Kuei that he hastily fell on both his knees, pulled off his hat, knocked his head on the ground, and gave vent to repeated assenting utterances: “Oh, quite so, Sir! Our elder brother Mr. Pao has,” he continued, “already read up to the third book of the Book of Odes, up to where there’s something or other like: ‘Yiu, Yiu, the deer bleat; the lotus leaves and duckweed.’ Your servant wouldn’t presume to tell a lie!” As he said this, the whole company burst out into a boisterous fit of laughter, and Chia Cheng himself could not also contain his countenance and had to laugh. “Were he even,” he observed, “to read thirty books of the Book of Odes, it would be as much an imposition upon people and no more, as (when the thief ) who, in order to steal the bell, stops up his own ears! You go and present my compliments to the gentleman in the schoolroom, and tell him, from my part, that the whole lot of Odes and old writings are of no use, as they are subjects for empty show; and that he should, above all things, take the Four Books, and explain them to him, from first to last, and make him know them all thoroughly by heart,--that this is the most important thing!” Li Kuei signified his obedience with all promptitude, and perceiving that Chia Cheng had nothing more to say, he retired out of the room.","To breakfast!’ Jia Zheng asked who was in attendance on Bao-yu. There was a ringing ‘Sir!’ from outside, and three or four strapping fellows entered the study and saluted Manchu fashion. Jia Zheng recognized the foremost one as Li Gui, the son of Bao-yu’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Li, and addressed himself to him. ‘You have attended Bao-yu during all his lessons in the past. What precisely has he been doing? Stuffing his head with worthless nonsense and acquiring a fine new stock of knavish tricks, I shouldn’t wonder! Wait until I have a little time to spare: I’ll have your hide off first and then settle accounts with that good-for-nothing son of mine!’ ‘Sir!’ Li Gui sank terrified to his knees, snatched off his cap, and knocked the ground several times with his forehead. ‘Master Bao has read the first three books of the Poetry Classic, sir, up to the part that goes Hear the happy bleeding deer Grousing in the vagrant meads… That’s the truth, sir. I wouldn’t tell a lie.’ This novel version of the well-known lines provoked a roar of laughter from the literary gentlemen. Even Jia Zheng could not restrain a smile. ‘If he read thirty books of the Poetry Classic’ said Jia Zheng, ‘it would still be tomfoolery. No doubt he hopes to deceive others with this sort of thing, but he does not deceive me. Give my compliments to the Headmaster and tell him from me that I want none of this trifling with the Poetry Classic or any other ancient literature. It is of the utmost importance that he should thoroughly understand and learn by heart the whole Four Books before he attempts anything else.’ ‘Sir!’ Seeing that Jia Zheng had nothing more to say, Li Gui and the other servants rose to their feet again and withdrew."
彼時寶玉尚未作完，只剛作了「瀟湘館」與「蘅蕪苑」二首，正作「怡紅院」一首，起草內有「綠玉春猶卷」一句。寶釵轉眼瞥見，便趁眾人不理論，急忙回身悄推他道：「他因不喜『紅香綠玉』四字，改了『怡紅快綠』；你這會子偏用『綠玉』二字，豈不是有意和他爭馳了？況且蕉葉之說也頗多，再想一個字改了罷。」,"At that time, Baoyu had not finished his work, and had only just composed two pieces, ""Xiaoxiang Pavilion"" and ""Hengwu Garden"". He was currently writing ""Yihong Courtyard"", and there was a sentence ""Green Jade Spring Still Scroll"" in the draft. Baochai saw it in a blink of an eye, and while the crowd was not arguing, he turned around and pushed him in a hurry, ""Because he didn't like the four characters 'red, fragrant and green jade', he changed it to 'yihong, fast green'; now you prefer 'green jade'. Two words, isn't it intentional to fight with him? Besides, there are many sayings about banana leaves, just think about one more word and change it.""","Pao-yue had by this time not completed his task. He had just finished two stanzas on the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge and the Heng Wu garden, and was just then engaged in composing a verse on the “Happy red Court.” In his draft figured a line: “The (leaves) of jade-like green in spring are yet rolled up,” which Pao-ch’ai stealthily observed as she turned her eyes from side to side; and availing herself of the very first moment, when none of the company could notice her, she gave him a nudge. “As her highness,” she remarked, “doesn’t relish the four characters, representing the red (flowers are) fragrant, and the green (banana leaves) like jade, she changed them, just a while back, for ‘the joyful red and gladsome green;’ and if you deliberately now again employ these two words ‘jade-like green,’ won’t it look as if you were bent upon being at variance with her? Besides, very many are the old books, in which the banana leaves form the theme, so you had better think of another line and substitute it and have done with it!”","Meanwhile Bao-yu was far from finished with his consignment. He had finished composing the poems for the Naiad’s House and All-spice Court and was still in the middle of a poem on the House of Green Delights. Bao-chai took a peep over his shoulder and noticed that his draft contained the line Some wear sheathed skirts of lucent green curled tight. When no one was looking she gave him a nudge: ‘You can tell Her Grace didn’t like “lucent green” because she only just now altered it to something else in your inscription. If you insist on using it in your poem, it will look as if you are deliberately flaunting your difference of opinion. There are so many allusions to plantain leaves you could use, you shouldn’t have much difficulty in substituting something else.’"

後面便是一片冰山，上面有一隻雌鳳。其判曰：「凡鳥偏從末世來，都知愛慕此生才。一從二令三人木，哭向金陵事更哀。」,"Behind it is an iceberg with a female phoenix on it. His verdict said: ""All birds come from the end of the world, and they all know that they love this life. One from the second to make the three trees tree, and weeping to Jinling is even more sad.""","Next in order came a hill of ice, on which stood a hen-phoenix, while under it was this motto: When time ends, sure coincidence, the phoenix doth alight; The talents of this human form all know and living see, For first to yield she kens, then to control, and third genial to be; But sad to say, things in Chin Ling are in more sorry plight. This was succeeded by a representation of a desolate village, and a dreary inn.","Next was an iceberg with a hen phoenix perched on the top of it, and these words: This phoenix in a bad time came; All praised her great ability. ‘Two’ makes my riddle with a man and tree: Returning south in tears she met calamity."
王夫人等日日忙亂，直到十月將盡，幸皆全備：各處監管都交清帳目；各處古董文玩，皆已陳設齊備；採辦鳥雀的，自僊鶴、孔雀以及鹿、兔、雞、鵝等類，悉已買全，交於園中各處飼養；賈薔那邊也演出二十出雜戲來；小尼姑、道姑也都學會了唸幾卷經咒。賈政方略心意寬暢，又請賈母等進園，色色斟酌，點綴妥當，再無一些遺漏不當之處了。於是賈政方擇日題本。本上之日，奉朱批准奏：次年正月十五上元之日，恩准賈妃省親。賈府領了此恩旨，益發晝夜不閑，年也不曾好生過的。,"Mrs. Wang was busy day by day until the end of October. Fortunately, everything was in place: all the supervisors had paid their accounts; all the antiques and toys were fully furnished; the birds were bought from cranes, peacocks, deer, Rabbits, chickens, geese, etc. have all been purchased and raised in various places in the garden; Jia Qiang also performed twenty miscellaneous plays; the little nuns and Taoist nuns also learned to recite a few scrolls of scriptures and mantras. Jia Zhengfang was slightly relaxed, and invited Jia's mother to wait in the garden. The color and color were considered, and the decoration was appropriate, and there were no omissions or inappropriateness. So Jia Zhengfang chose a date for the title book. On the day of this book, Feng Zhu approved it and wrote: On the fifteenth day of the first lunar month of the following year, on the first day of the Yuan Dynasty, concubine Jia was granted permission to visit relatives. Jia Fu received this decree, and he became more and more busy day and night, and the year was never easy.","A servant came, at this moment, to report that for the works in course of execution, they were waiting for gauze and damask silk to paste on various articles, and that they requested lady Feng to go and open the depot for them to take the gauze and silk, while another servant also came to ask lady Feng to open the treasury for them to receive the gold and silver ware. And as Madame Wang, the waiting-maids and the other domestics of the upper rooms had all no leisure, Pao-ch’ai suggested: “Don’t let us remain in here and be in the way of their doing what there is to be done, and of going where they have to go,” and saying this, she betook herself, escorted by Pao-yue and the rest, into Ying Ch’un’s rooms. Madame Wang continued day after day in a great state of flurry and confusion, straight up to within the tenth moon, by which time every arrangement had been completed, and the overseers had all handed in a clear statement of their accounts. The curios and writing materials, wherever needed, had all already been laid out and everything got ready, and the birds (and animals), from the stork, the deer and rabbits to the chickens, geese and the like, had all been purchased and handed over to be reared in the various localities in the garden; and over at Chia Se’s, had also been learnt twenty miscellaneous plays, while a company of young nuns and Taoist priestesses had likewise the whole number of them, mastered the intonation of Buddhist classics and incantations. Chia Cheng after this, at length, was slightly composed in mind, and cheerful at heart; and having further invited dowager lady Chia and other inmates to go into the garden, he deliberated with them on, and made arrangements for, every detail in such a befitting manner that not the least trifle remained for which suitable provision had not been made; and Chia Cheng eventually mustered courage to indite a memorial, and on the very day on which the memorial was presented, a decree was received fixing upon the fifteenth day of the first moon of the ensuing year, the very day of the Shang Yuan festival, for the honourable consorts to visit their homes. Upon the receipt of this decree, with which the Chia family was honoured, they had still less leisure, both by day as well as by night; so much so that they could not even properly observe the new year festivities.","Lady Wang’s busyness in fact continued unabated until well into the tenth month. By then the contractors had fulfilled their contracts and the. various buildings in the garden been stocked with appropriate ornaments and antiques; supplies of livestock – storks, deer, rabbits, chicken, geese, and so forth -had been purchased and distributed to the parts of the garden where they were to be reared; Jia Qiang’s young ladies had rehearsed and were word-perfect in twenty or thirty operatic pieces; and the little Buddhist and Taoist nuns had mastered the essential parts of their respective liturgies. Jia Zheng could now feel reasonably well satisfied that things were as they should be, and invited Grandmother Jia into the garden for a final inspection in which she was to suggest any last-minute alterations that might still be needed. When not the slightest shadow of an imperfection could any more be found, he at last sent in his written application for a Visitation. The Gracious Reply arrived on the very same day: Her Grace will make a Family Visitation next year on the fifteenth of the first month, being the Festival of Lanterns. The receipt of this reply seemed to throw the Jia family into an even greater frenzy of preparation than before, so that even its New Year celebrations that year were somewhat scamped."
原來這鐵檻寺原是寧榮二公當日修造，現今還是有香火地畝布施，以備京中老了人口，在此便宜寄放。其中陰陽兩宅俱已預備妥貼，好為送靈人口寄居。不想如今後輩人口繁盛，其中貧富不一，或性情參商：有那家業艱難安分的，便住在這裏了；有那尚排場有錢勢的，只說這裏不方便，一定另外或村莊或尼庵尋個下處，為事畢宴退之所。即今秦氏之喪，族中諸人皆權在鐵檻寺下榻，獨有鳳姐嫌不方便，因而早遣人來和饅頭庵的姑子淨虛說了，騰出兩間房子來作下處。,"It turns out that this Tiejian Temple was originally built by Ning Rong Ergong on the same day, and now there are still incense offerings on the ground, in order to prepare for the elderly population in Beijing, and store it here cheaply. Among them, the two houses of Yin and Yang have been prepared, so that the people who send spirits can live there. I don’t want the younger generation to have a prosperous population, among them rich and poor, or their temperament: if there are those who have a difficult and stable business, they will live here; The nunnery looked for a place to retreat after the banquet. Now that the Qin family was mourning, everyone in the clan had the right to stay at Tiejian Temple, but Sister Feng found it inconvenient, so she sent someone to talk to Jingxu, the sister-in-law of Mantou An, and vacated two rooms for the next place.","This Temple of the Iron Fence had, in fact, been erected in days gone by, at the expense of the two dukes Ning and Jung; and there still remained up to these days, acres of land, from which were derived the funds for incense and lights for such occasions, on which the coffins of any members, old or young, (who died) in the capital, had to be deposited in this temple; and the inner and outer houses, in this compound were all kept in readiness and good order, for the accommodation of those who formed part of the cortege. At this time, as it happened, the descendants mustered an immense crowd, and among them were poor and rich of various degrees, or with likes and dislikes diametrically opposed. There were those, who, being in straitened circumstances at home, and easily contented, readily took up their quarters in the temple. And there were those with money and position, and with extravagant ideas, who maintained that the accommodation in the temple was not suitable, and, of course, went in search of additional quarters, either in country houses, or in convents, where they could have their meals and retire, after the ceremonies were over. On the occasion of Mrs. Ch’in’s funeral, all the members of the clan put up temporarily in the Iron Fence Temple; lady Feng alone looked down upon it as inconvenient, and consequently despatched a servant to go and tell Ch’ing Hsue, a nun in the Bread Convent, to empty two rooms for her to go and live in.","The Temple of the Iron Threshold was a private foundation of the Dukes of Ning-guo and Rong-guo which still had some land of its own in which members of the clan who died in the capital could be given temporary burial. The thoughtful Dukes had provided accommodation not only for the dead but also for the living, in the form of guest-rooms in which mourners might temporarily reside until their funereal business was over. What the old gentlemen had not foreseen was that their multitudinous progeny would come in time to exhibit differences of wealth and temperament so extreme as often to render their possessors mutually intolerable and that, whereas the more hard-up members of the clan gladly occupied the accommodation provided, the more affluent or pretentious found it ‘inconvenient’ to stay there and preferred to seek alternative accommodation in the farmsteads and convents round about. Xi-feng was among those who found the Iron Threshold accommodation ‘inconvenient’."
王成新近亦因病故，衹有其子，小名狗兒。狗兒亦生一子，小名板兒，嫡妻劉氏，又生一女，名喚青兒。一家四口，仍以務農為業。因狗兒白日間又作些生計，劉氏又操井臼等事，青板姊妹兩個無人看管，狗兒遂將岳母劉姥姥接來一處過活。這劉姥姥乃是個積年的老寡婦，膝下又無兒女，只靠兩畝薄田度日。今者女婿接來養活，豈不願意，遂一心一計，幫趁著女兒女婿過活起來。,"Wang Cheng also recently passed away due to illness, only his son, nicknamed Gouer. Gou'er also gave birth to a son, nicknamed Ban'er, his first wife Liu Shi, and a daughter named Qing'er. The family of four is still engaged in farming. Because Gou'er was doing some living during the day, and Mrs. Liu was doing wells and other things, and the two Qingban sisters were left unattended, so Gou'er brought his mother-in-law, Grandma Liu, to live there. This grandmother Liu was an old widow with no children, and lived on two acres of thin fields. Now, if the son-in-law took over to support him, wouldn't he be unwilling, so he single-mindedly planned to help his daughter and son-in-law live.","Wang Ch’eng also died soon after his father, leaving a son, known in his infancy as Kou Erh, who married a Miss Liu, by whom he had a son called by the infant name of Pan Erh, as well as a daughter, Ch’ing Erh. His family consisted of four, and he earned a living from farming. As Kou Erh was always busy with something or other during the day and his wife, dame Liu, on the other hand, drew the water, pounded the rice and attended to all the other domestic concerns, the brother and sister, Ch’ing Erh and Pan Erh, the two of them, had no one to look after them. (Hence it was that) Kou Erh brought over his mother-in-law, old goody Liu, to live with them. This goody Liu was an old widow, with a good deal of experience. She had besides no son round her knees, so that she was dependent for her maintenance on a couple of acres of poor land, with the result that when her son-in-law received her in his home, she naturally was ever willing to exert heart and mind to help her daughter and her son-in-law to earn their living.","The grandfather had long since died, leaving an only son called Wang Cheng who, having fallen on hard times, had moved back into the countryside somewhere outside the capital. Wang Cheng in his turn had died leaving a son called Gou-er, who had married a girl from a family called Liu and now had two children, a son called Ban-er and a daughter called Qing-er. The four of them depended on agriculture for their living, and since, with Gou-er himself busy most of the day on the land and his wife busy about the farm drawing water, pounding grain, and the like , there was no one to look after Qing-er and her little brother, Gou-er invited his mother-in-law, old Grannie Liu, to come and live with them. This Grannie Liu was an ancient widow-woman, rich in experience of the world, who, having no son or daughter-in-law to cherish her, eked out her solitary existence by scratching a livelihood from a miserable half-acre of land. She therefore embraced her son-in-law’s invitation with alacrity and threw herself enthusiastically into the business of helping the young couple to make a living."
雨村看了，因想到：「這兩句話，文雖淺近，其意則深。我也曾遊過些名山大剎，倒不曾見過這話頭，其中想必有個翻過筋鬥來的亦未可知，何不進去試試。」想著走入，衹有一個龍鍾老僧在那裏煮粥。雨村見了，便不在意。及至問他兩句話，那老僧既聾且昏，齒落舌鈍，所答非所問。,"Amamura looked at it and thought, ""Though these two sentences are shallow and close, their meaning is profound. I have also traveled to some famous mountains and temples, but I have never seen these words before, and there must be someone who turned over somersaults. I don't know, why don't you go in and try it."" Thinking of entering, there was only an old monk Longzhong cooking porridge there. When Amamura saw it, he didn't care. When he asked him two words, the old monk was deaf and faint, his teeth fell and his tongue was dull, so the answer was not what he asked.","“These two sentences,” Yue-ts’un pondered after perusal, “although simple in language, are profound in signification. I have previous to this visited many a spacious temple, located on hills of note, but never have I beheld an inscription referring to anything of the kind. The meaning contained in these words must , I feel certain, owe their origin to the experiences of some person or other; but there’s no saying. But why should I not go in and inquire for myself ?” Upon walking in, he at a glance caught sight of no one else, but of a very aged bonze, of unkempt appearance, cooking his rice. When Yue-ts’un perceived that he paid no notice, he went up to him and asked him one or two questions, but as the old priest was dull of hearing and a dotard, and as he had lost his teeth, and his tongue was blunt, he made most irrelevant replies.","‘The wording is commonplace to a degree,’ Yu-cun reflected, ‘yet the sentiment is quite profound. In all the famous temples and monasteries I have visited, I cannot recollect having ever seen anything quite like it. I shouldn’t be surprised to find that some story of spectacular downfall and dramatic conversion lay behind this inscription. It might be worth going in and inquiring.’ But when he went inside and looked around, he saw only an ancient, wizened monk cooking some gruel who paid no attention whatsoever to his greetings and who proved, when Yu-cun went up to him and asked him a few questions, to be both deaf and partially blind. His toothless replies were all but unintelligible, and in any case bore no relation to the questions."

這日賈珍等來回賈政：「園內工程俱已告竣，大老爺已瞧過了，只等老爺瞧了，或有不妥之處，再行改造，好題匾額對聯。」賈政聽了，沉思一回，說道：「這匾額對聯倒是一件難事。論理該請貴妃賜題纔是，然貴妃若不親睹其景，大約亦必不肯妄擬；若直待貴妃遊幸過再請題，偌大景緻，若干亭榭，無字標題，也覺寥落無趣，任有花柳山水，也斷不能生色。」眾清客在旁笑答道：「老世翁所見極是。如今我們有個愚見：各處匾額對聯斷不可少，亦斷不可定名。如今且按其景緻，或兩字、三字、四字，虛合其意，擬了出來，暫且做燈匾聯懸了。待貴妃遊幸時，再請定名，豈不兩全？」賈政等聽了，都道：「所見不差。我們今日且看看去，只管題了，若妥當便用；不妥時，然後將雨村請來，令他再擬。」眾人笑道：「老爺今日一擬定佳，何必又待雨村。」賈政笑道：「你們不知，我自幼於花鳥山水題詠上就平平；如今上了年紀，且案牘勞煩，於這怡情悅性文章上更生疏了。縱擬了出來，不免迂腐古板，反不能使花柳園亭生色，倘不妥協，反沒意思。」眾清客笑道：「這也無妨。我們大家看了公擬，各舉其長，優則存之，劣則刪之，未為不可。」賈政道：「此論極是。且喜今日天氣和暖，大家去逛逛。」說著起身，引眾人前往。,"On this day, Jia Zhen waited and went back and forth with Jia Zheng: ""The project in the park has been completed, and the master has already seen it. Just wait until the master has seen it. If there is something wrong, we can renovate it and write a couplet on the plaque."" Jia Zheng listened. Now, after thinking for a while, he said, ""This couplet on the plaque is a difficult thing. Theorizing should ask the imperial concubine to give it the title. However, if the imperial concubine did not see the scene in person, she probably would not be willing to imitate it; The question is, the scenery is huge, there are several pavilions, and there are no titles, and I feel that it is sparse and uninteresting. Even if there are flowers, willows, and landscapes, it will definitely not be able to produce color."" The Qing guests laughed and replied: ""The old man saw it very well. Now we have I have a humble opinion: the couplets of the plaques everywhere are indispensable, and they cannot be named. Now, according to their scenery, or two, three, or four words, they have been drawn up, and they are temporarily hung as lamp plaques. When the imperial concubine travels fortunately, please ask for a name, won’t it be perfect?” Jia Zheng and others said, “What we have seen is not bad. Let’s take a look today. Then invite Yucun and ask him to make another plan."" The crowd laughed, ""Master, why do you have to wait for Yucun since he made a good plan today."" Jia Zheng smiled and said, ""You don't know, I have been flat since I was a child in the inscriptions on flowers, birds and landscapes; now As I get older, and I have trouble with documents, I am even more unfamiliar with this pleasant and pleasant article. If it is drawn up, it will inevitably be pedantic and old-fashioned. Said: ""It's okay. We all looked at the public drafts, and each of them has their own advantages. The good ones will be kept, and the bad ones will be deleted. It's not a must."" Jia Zhengdao: ""This argument is extremely true. Let's go shopping."" He got up and led everyone to go.","On this day, Chia Chen and the others came to tell Chia Cheng that the works in the garden had all been reported as completed, and that Mr. Chia She had already inspected them. “It only remains,” (they said), “for you, sir, to see them; and should there possibly be anything which is not proper, steps will be at once taken to effect the alterations, so that the tablets and scrolls may conveniently be written.” After Chia Cheng had listened to these words, he pondered for a while. “These tablets and scrolls,” he remarked, “present however a difficult task. According to the rites, we should, in order to obviate any shortcoming, request the imperial consort to deign and compose them; but if the honourable consort does not gaze upon the scenery with her own eyes, it will also be difficult for her to conceive its nature and indite upon it! And were we to wait until the arrival of her highness, to request her to honour the grounds with a visit, before she composes the inscriptions, such a wide landscape, with so many pavilions and arbours, will, without one character in the way of a motto, albeit it may abound with flowers, willows, rockeries, and streams, nevertheless in no way be able to show off its points of beauty to advantage.” The whole party of family companions, who stood by, smiled. “Your views, remarkable sir,” they ventured, “are excellent; but we have now a proposal to make. Tablets and scrolls for every locality cannot, on any account, be dispensed with, but they could not likewise, by any means, be determined upon for good! Were now, for the time being, two, three or four characters fixed upon, harmonising with the scenery, to carry out, for form’s sake, the idea, and were they provisionally utilised as mottoes for the lanterns, tablets and scrolls, and hung up, pending the arrival of her highness, and her visit through the grounds, when she could be requested to decide upon the devices, would not two exigencies be met with satisfactorily?” “Your views are perfectly correct,” observed Chia Cheng, after he had heard their suggestion; “and we should go to-day and have a look at the place so as then to set to work to write the inscriptions; which, if suitable, can readily be used; and, if unsuitable, Yue-ts’un can then be sent for, and asked to compose fresh ones.” The whole company smiled. “If you, sir, were to compose them to-day,” they ventured, “they are sure to be excellent; and what need will there be again to wait for Yue-ts’un!” “You people are not aware,” Chia Cheng added with a smiling countenance, “that I’ve been, even in my young days, very mediocre in the composition of stanzas on flowers, birds, rockeries and streams; and that now that I’m well up in years and have moreover the fatigue and trouble of my official duties, I’ve become in literary compositions like these, which require a light heart and gladsome mood, still more inapt. Were I even to succeed in composing any, they will unavoidably be so doltish and forced that they would contrariwise be instrumental in making the flowers, trees, garden and pavilions, through their demerits, lose in beauty, and present instead no pleasing feature.” “This wouldn’t anyhow matter,” remonstrated all the family companions, “for after perusing them we can all decide upon them together, each one of us recommending those he thinks best; which if excellent can be kept, and if faulty can be discarded; and there’s nothing unfeasible about this!” “This proposal is most apposite,” rejoined Chia Cheng. “What’s more, the weather is, I rejoice, fine to-day; so let’s all go in a company and have a look.” Saying this, he stood up and went forward, at the head of the whole party; while Chia Chen betook himself in advance into the garden to let every one know of their coming.","One day Cousin Zhen came to Jia Zheng with his team of helpers to report that work on the new garden had been completed. ‘Uncle She has already had a look,’ said Cousin Zhen. ‘Now we are only waiting for you to look round it to tell us if there is anything you think will need altering and also to decide what inscriptions ought to be used on the boards everywhere.’ Jia Zheng reflected a while in silence. ‘These inscriptions are going to be difficult,’ he said eventually. ‘By rights, of course, Her Grace should have the privilege of doing them herself; but she can scarcely be expected to make them up out of her head without having seen any of the views which they are to describe. On the other hand, if we wait until she has already visited the garden before asking her, half the pleasure of the visit will be lost. All those prospects and pavilions – even the rocks and trees and flowers will seem somehow incomplete without that touch of poetry which only the written word can lend a scene.’ ‘My dear patron, you are so right,’ said one of the literary gentlemen who sat with him. ‘But we have had an idea. The inscriptions for the various parts of the garden obviously cannot be dispensed with; nor, equally obviously, can they be decided in advance. Our suggestion is that we should compose provisional names and couplets to suit the places where inscriptions are required, and have them painted on rectangular paper lanterns which can be hung up temporarily – either horizontally or vertically as the case may be – when Her Grace comes to visit. We can ask her to decide on the permanent names after she has inspected the garden. Is not this a solution of the dilemma?’ ‘It is indeed,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘When we look round the garden presently, we must all try to think of words that can be used. If they seem suitable, we can keep them for the lanterns. If not, we can call for Yu-cun to come and help us out.’ ‘Your own suggestions are sure to be admirable, Sir Zheng,’ said the literary gentlemen ingratiatingly. “There will be no need to call in Yu-cun.’ Jia Zheng smiled deprecatingly. ‘I am afraid it is not as you imagine. In my youth I had at best only indifferent skill in the art of writing verses about natural objects – birds and flowers and scenery and the like; and now that I am older and have to devote all my energies to official documents and government papers, I am even more out of touch with this sort of thing than I was then; so that even if I were to try my hand at it, I fear that my efforts would be rather dull and pedantic ones. Instead of enhancing the interest and beauty of the garden, they would probably have a deadening effect upon both.’ ‘That doesn’t matter,’ the literary gentlemen replied. ‘We can all try our hands at composing. If each of us contributes what he is best at, and if we then select the better attempts and reject the ones that are not so good, we should be able to manage all right.’ ‘That seems to me a very good suggestion,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘As the weather today is so warm and pleasant, let us all go and take a turn round the garden now!’ So saying he rose to his feet and conducted his little retinue of literary luminaries towards the garden."

尤氏叫拿戲單來，讓鳳姐兒點戲，鳳姐兒說道：「親家太太和太太們在這裏，我如何敢點。」邢夫人王夫人說道：「我們和親家太太都點了好幾出了，你點兩出好的我們聽。」鳳姐兒立起身來答應了一聲，方接過戲單，從頭一看，點了一出《還魂》，一出《彈詞》，遞過戲單去說：「現在唱的這《雙官誥》，唱完了，再唱這兩出，也就是時候了。」,"You asked to bring the show list and asked Feng Jie'er to order the show. Feng Jie said, ""My in-laws and wives are here, how dare I order."" Mrs. Xing and Mrs. Wang said, ""We and my in-laws have ordered several. Come out, you can order two and let’s listen.” Sister Feng stood up and agreed, before she took the play list, looked at it from the beginning, ordered “Resurrection” and “Tan Ci”, and handed over the play Shan Quo said, ""This ""Shuangguan Gao"" is now being sung. After singing, it's time to sing these two more.""","Lady Feng speedily drew near mesdames Hsing and Wang, and begged permission to take a seat; while Mrs. Yu brought the programme, and pressed lady Feng to mark some plays. “The senior ladies occupy the seats of honour,” remonstrated lady Feng, “and how can I presume to choose?” “We, and our relative by marriage, have selected several plays,” explained mesdames Hsing and Wang, “and it’s for you now to choose some good ones for us to listen to.” Standing up, lady Feng signified her obedience; and taking over the programme, and perusing it from top to bottom, she marked off one entitled, the “Return of the Spirit,” and another called “Thrumming and Singing;” after which she handed back the programme, observing, “When they have done with the ‘Ennoblement of two Officers,’ which they are singing just at present, it will be time enough to sing these two.”","Xi-feng asked her two aunts for permission to sit. When she had done so You-shi held out the playbill and invited her to make a choice. ‘It’s not for me to choose when Mother and Aunt Wang are here,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Go ahead and choose!’ said Lady Xing. ‘ Mrs You and your aunt and I have already chosen a number of plays. Now you pick out one or two good ones for us!’ Xi-feng politely rose to thank her, and taking the playbill from You-shi, scanned it through and picked out two of the items listed: one a scene from The Return of the Soul and the other ‘Gui-nian Plays His Guitar’ from The Palace of Eternal Youth. ‘If they do these two after they have finished singing this scene from Faithful Bi-lian,’ she said, handing the playbill back to You-shi, ‘I think that will be just about enough for the day.’"
說畢，那馬道婆又坐了一回，便又往各院各房問安，閑逛了一回。一時來至趙姨娘房內，二人見過，趙姨娘命小丫頭倒了茶來與他喫。馬道婆因見炕上堆著些零碎綢緞灣角，趙姨娘正粘鞋呢。馬道婆道：「可是我正沒了鞋面子了。趙奶奶你有零碎緞子，不拘什麼顏色的，弄一雙鞋面給我。」趙姨娘聽說，便嘆口氣說道：「你瞧瞧那裏頭，還有那一塊是成樣的？成了樣的東西，也不能到我手裏來！有的沒的都在這裏，你不嫌，就挑兩塊子去。」馬道婆見說，果真便挑了兩塊袖將起來。,"After speaking, the Daoist Ma sat down again, then went to each hospital and each room to say hello, and strolled around for a while. Came to Concubine Zhao's room for a while, the two met, Concubine Zhao ordered the little girl to pour tea to eat with him. Because Ma Daopo saw some scraps of silk and satin piled up on the kang, Concubine Zhao was gluing her shoes. Ma Daopo said, ""But I'm losing the upper of my shoe. Grandma Zhao, you have some bits and pieces of satin, no matter what color, get me a pair of shoe uppers."" When Concubine Zhao heard that, she sighed and said, ""Look there. Head, which piece is the same? Even if it is like this, it can’t come into my hands! Some of the missing pieces are all here, if you don’t mind, just pick two pieces.” Ma Daobao said, Sure enough, he picked up two sleeves and stood up.","These directions concluded, the Taoist matron trudged into the various quarters, and paid her respects, and then strolled leisurely about. Presently, she entered Mrs. Chao’s apartments. After the two ladies had exchanged salutations, Mrs. Chao bade a young servant-girl hand her guest a cup of tea. While Mrs. Chao busied herself pasting shoes, Ma, the Taoist matron, espied, piled up in a heap on the stovecouch, sundry pieces of silks and satins. “It just happens,” she consequently remarked, “that I have no facings for shoes, so my lady do give me a few odd cuttings of silk and satin, of no matter what colour, to make myself a pair of shoes with.” Mrs. Chao heaved a sigh. “Look,” she said, “whether there be still among them any pieces good for anything. But anything that’s worth anything doesn’t find its way in here. If you don’t despise what’s worthless, you’re at liberty to select any two pieces and to take them away, and have done.” The Taoist matron, Ma, chose with alacrity several pieces and shoved them in her breast.","After seeing Grandmother Jia, Mother Ma drifted round the mansion calling at various other apartments. Presently she came to Aunt Zhao’s room. After they had exchanged greetings, Aunt Zhao told her little servant to pour the old woman a cup of tea. Aunt Zhao was pasting pieces of cloth together for soling shoes with, and Mother Ma observed that the kang around her was piled with miscellaneous remnants of material. ‘I’m looking for something to make a pair of uppers out of, dearie,’ said Mother Ma. ‘I suppose you haven’t got an old bit of silk or an old bit of satin that would do? It doesn’t matter about the colour.’ Aunt Zhao heaved a long-suffering sigh: ‘Take a look at this lot! You won’t find anything much worth having here. Nothing worth having in this family ever comes my way. But you’re welcome to pick out a couple of pieces if you don’t mind the poor quality.’ Mother Ma rummaged around in the heap, and having picked out several pieces, stuffed them into her sleeve."
寶玉看了仍不解。便又擲了，再去取「正冊」看，只見頭一頁上便畫著兩株枯木，木上懸著一圍玉帶；又有一堆雪，雪下一股金簪。也有四句言詞，道是：「可嘆停機德，堪憐詠絮才。玉帶林中掛，金簪雪裏埋。」,"Baoyu looked still puzzled. Then I threw it again, and went to get the ""main book"" to look at it, and I saw two dead trees on the first page, with a jade belt hanging on the wood; there was a pile of snow, and a golden hairpin under the snow. There are also four sentences, the saying is: ""It is a pity for Shunde, and it is pitiful for Yong Xucai. The jade belt hangs in the forest, and the golden hairpin is buried in the snow.""","Pao-yue read these lines, but failed to understand what they meant. He then went and fetched the “Principal Record,” and set to looking it over. He saw on the first page a picture of two rotten trees, while on these trees was suspended a jade girdle. There was also a heap of snow, and under this snow was a golden hair-pin. There were in addition these four lines in verse: Bitter thy cup will be, e’en were the virtue thine to stop the loom, Thine though the gift the willow fluff to sing, pity who will thy doom? High in the trees doth hang the girdle of white jade, And lo! among the snow the golden pin is laid!","Once more failing to make any sense of what he saw, Bao-yu picked up the Main Register to look at. In this album the picture on the first page represented two dead trees with a jade belt hanging in their branches and on the ground beneath them a pile of snow in which a golden hairpin lay half-buried. This was followed by a quatrain: One was a pattern of female virtue, One a wit who made other wits seem slow. The jade belt in the greenwood hangs, The gold pin is buried beneath the snow."

If he contains his persuasion, there is no fear of participating in business affairs; if he destroys his immortal appearance, he will not have the heart of love; if he loses his spiritual acuity, he will not have the feeling of talent and thinking. The hairpins, jades, flowers, and musk deer all open up and pierce their tunnels, so they are dazzled and entangled in the world.","By obliterating Pao-ch’ai’s supernatural beauty, by reducing to ashes Tai-yue’s spiritual perception, and by destroying and extinguishing my affectionate preferences, the beautiful in the inner chambers as well as the plain will then, at length, be put on the same footing. And as they will keep advice to themselves, there will be no fear of any disagreement. By obliterating her supernatural beauty, I shall then have no incentive for any violent affection; by dissolving her spiritual perception, I will have no feelings with which to foster the memory of her talents.

If the female tongue ceases from nagging there will be no further fear of quarrels and estrangements; if Bao-chai’s heavenly beauty is discarded there will be no further grounds for tender admiration; and if Dai-yu’s divine intelligence is destroyed there will be no further cause for romantic imaginings. These Bao-chais, Dai-yus, Aromas and Musks spread their nets and dig their pits, and all the world are bewitched and ensnared by them."
四人正難分解，有人來請喫飯，方往前邊來。那天早又掌燈時分，王夫人、李紈、鳳姐、迎、探、惜等都往賈母這邊來，大家閑話了一回，各自歸寢。湘雲仍往黛玉房中安歇。,"The four of them were having difficulty breaking down, and when someone came to invite them to dinner, they moved forward. That morning, when the lights were on again, Mrs. Wang, Li Wan, Sister Feng, Ying, Tan, Xi and others all came to Jia's mother's side. Everyone chatted for a while and went back to bed. Xiangyun still went to rest in Daiyu's room.","While this quartet were finding it an arduous task to understand one another, a servant came to invite them to have their repast, and they eventually crossed over to the front side, and as it was already time for the lamps to be lit, madame Wang, widow Li Wan, lady Feng, Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and the other cousins, adjourned in a body to dowager lady Chia’s apartments on this side, where the whole company spent a while in a chat on irrelevant topics, after which they each returned to their rooms and retired to bed. Hsiang-yuen, as of old, betook herself to Tai-yue’s quarters to rest, and","It is hard to say how long the four of them might have remained there in this impasse had not a servant arrived at that moment and summoned them to dinner in Grandmother Jia’s room. It was already lighting-up time and Lady Wang, Li Wan, Xi-feng, Ying-chun, Tan-chun and Xi-chun had also forgathered for the meal. When dinner was over, the company conversed for a while and then retired to their various rooms for the night – Xiang-yun to sleep with Dai-yu in what had once, in the days when she lived with Grandmother Jia, been her own bedroom."
卻說黛玉同姊妹們至王夫人處，見王夫人與兄嫂處的來人計議家務，又說姨母家遭人命官司等語。因見王夫人事情冗雜，姊妹們遂出來，至寡嫂李氏房中來了。,"But she said that Daiyu went to Madam Wang's place with her sisters, and saw the people coming from Madam Wang and her brother and sister-in-law to discuss the housework, and said that her aunt's family had been killed by a lawsuit, etc. Seeing that Mrs. Wang's affairs were complicated, the sisters came out to the widow's sister-in-law Li's room.","Tai-yue, for we shall now return to our story, having come, along with her cousin to madame Wang’s apartments, found madame Wang discussing certain domestic occurrences with the messengers, who had arrived from her elder brother’s wife’s home, and conversing also about the case of homicide, in which the family of her mother’s sister had become involved, and other such relevant topics. Perceiving how pressing and perplexing were the matters in which madame Wang was engaged, the young ladies promptly left her apartments, and came over to the rooms of their widow sister-in-law, Mrs. Li.","When Dai-yu and the girls went to call on Lady Wang, they found her in the midst of discussing family affairs with the messengers from her elder brother and his wife and heard talk of their aunt’s family in Nanking being involved in a case of manslaughter. Since Lady Wang was obviously preoccupied with this matter, the girls went off to call on Li Wan."
話說寧國府中都總管來昇聞得裏面委請了鳳姐，因傳齊同事人等說道：「如今請了西府裏璉二奶奶管理內事，倘或他來支取東西，或是說話，我們須要比往日小心些。每日大家早來晚散，寧可辛苦這一個月，過後再歇著，不要把老臉丟了。那是個有名的烈貨，臉酸心硬，一時惱了，不認人的。」眾人都道：「有理。」又有一個笑道：「論理，我們裏面也須得他來整治整治，都忒不像了。」正說著，只見來旺媳婦拿了對牌來領取呈文京榜紙札，票上批著數目。眾人連忙讓坐倒茶，一面命人按數取紙來抱著，同來旺媳婦一路來至儀門口，方交與來旺媳婦自己抱進去了。,"It was said that Laisheng, the head of the central government of Ningguo, had hired Sister Feng, because Chuanqi colleagues and others said: ""Now the second grandmother of Lilian in Xifu has been invited to manage the internal affairs. If he comes to ask for things or talk, we need to be better than before. Be careful. Every day, everyone comes early and leaves late. It’s better to work hard for a month, rest after that, and don’t lose your old face. He is a well-known strongman, his face is sour and hard-hearted. Everyone said, ""It's justified."" Another laughed and said, ""It's logical, we also have to have him to rectify and rectify it. It's too different."" List of paper stamps, with the number on the ticket. Everyone hurriedly sat down and poured the tea, while ordering people to take the paper according to the number to hold, and the daughter-in-law Laiwang came all the way to the door of the ceremony, and Fang Jiao and daughter-in-law Laiwang carried them in by themselves.","When Lai Sheng, be it noticed in continuing our story, the major-domo in the Ning Kuo mansion, came to hear that from inside an invitation had been extended to lady Feng to act as deputy, he summoned together his co-workers and other servants. “Lady Secunda, of the western mansion,” he harangued them, “has now been asked to take over the control of internal affairs; and should she come we must, when we apply for anything, or have anything to say, be circumspect in our service; we should all every day come early and leave late; and it’s better that we should exert ourselves during this one month and take rest after it’s over. We mustn’t throw away our old ‘face,’ for she’s well known to be an impetuous thing, with a soured face and a hard heart, who, when angry, knows no distinction of persons.” The whole company unanimously admitted that he was right; and one of their number too observed smilingly, “It’s but right that for the inner apartments, we should, in fact, get her to come and put things in proper order, as everything is very much what it should not be.” But while he uttered these words, they saw Lai Wang’s wife coming, with an indent in hand, to fetch paper for the supplications and prayers, the amount of which was mentioned on the order; and they one and all hastened to press her into a seat, and to help her to a cup of tea; while a servant was told to fetch the quantity of paper required. (When it was brought,) Lai Wang carried it in his arms and came, the whole way with his wife, as far as the ceremonial gate; when he, at length, delivered it over to her and she clasped it, and walked into the room all alone.","When Lai Sheng, the Chief Steward of the Ning-guo mansion, learned that Xi-feng had been invited to take on the management of the household, he called his cronies together and addressed them in the following terms: ‘Well lads, it seems that they’ve called in Mrs Lian from the other house to run things here for a bit; so if she should happen to come round asking for anything or have occasion to talk to you about anything, be sure to do what she says, won’t you ? During this coming month we shall all have to start work a bit earlier and knock off a bit later than usual. If you’ll put up with a little extra hardship just for this month, we can make up for it by taking things easy when it’s over. Anyway, I’m relying on you not to let me down. She’s well known for a sour-faced, hard-hearted bitch is this one, and once she’s got her back up, she’ll give no quarter, no matter who you are. So be careful!’ There was a chorus of agreement from the rest. One of them did observe, half-jokingly, that ‘by rights they could do with someone like her to straighten things up a bit, considering the state they had got into’. But just at that moment Brightie’s wife arrived on a mission from Xi-feng. She was to take receipt of some ledger-paper, buckram, and book-labels, and had a tally in her hand and a slip of paper specifying the quantities required. The men pressed round her offering her a place to sit and a cup of tea to drink while one of them hurried off with the list to fetch the needed items. Not only that, but, having fetched them, he carried them for her all the way to the inner gate of the mansion, only handing them to her then so that she could take them in to Xi-feng by herself."

Can be discussed with. Disrupt the six disciplines, cut off the rhetoric, plug the ears of the Kuang Kuang, and the first people in the world will contain their intelligence; destroy the articles, scatter the five kinds of ideas, glue them away from the eyes of Zhu, and the first people in the world will contain their wisdom; destroy the hooks. The rope and the rules are abandoned, the fingers of the workers are grasped, and the beginning of the world has its own cleverness.","Hence it was that bidding Ssu Erh trim the candles and brew the tea, he himself perused for a time the “Nan Hua Ching,” and upon reaching the precept: “On thieves,” given on some additional pages, the burden of which was: “Therefore by exterminating intuitive wisdom, and by discarding knowledge, highway robbers will cease to exist, and by taking off the jade and by putting away the pearls, pilferers will not spring to existence; by burning the slips and by breaking up the seals, by smashing the measures, and snapping the scales, the result will be that the people will not wrangle; by abrogating, to the utmost degree, wise rules under the heavens, the people will, at length, be able to take part in deliberation. By putting to confusion the musical scale, and destroying fifes and lutes, by deafening the ears of the blind Kuang, then, at last, will the human race in the world constrain his sense of hearing. By extinguishing literary compositions, by dispersing the five colours and by sticking the eyes of Li Chu, then, at length, mankind under the whole sky, will restrain the perception of his eyes. By destroying and eliminating the hooks and lines, by discarding the compasses and squares, and by amputating Kung Chui’s fingers, the human race will ultimately succeed in constraining his ingenuity,”--his high spirits, on perusal of this passage, were so exultant that taking advantage of the exuberance caused by the wine, he picked up his pen, for he could not repress himself, and continued the text in this wise: “By burning the flower, (Hua-Hsi Jen) and dispersing the musk, (She Yueeh), the consequence will be that the inmates of the inner chambers will, eventually, keep advice to themselves.","Away then with saints and wise men, and the big thieves will cease from despoiling. Discard your jades, destroy your pearls, and the little thieves will cease from pilfering. Burn your tallies, smash your seals, and the common people will revert to their natural integrity. Break all the bushels and snap all the steelyards, and they will have no further grounds for dispute. Obliterate those ‘sacred laws’ by which the world is governed, and you will find yourself at last able to reason with them. If you confuse the pitch-pipes, break up the organs, unstring the zithers and stop up Shi Kuang’s ears, people will begin to make proper use of their own hearing. If you abolish all intricacy of design and brilliancy of colouring and glue up Li Zhu’s eyes, people will begin to make proper use of their own eyesight.

These twenty are also divided into two groups. There are two shifts. They only take care of the family’s relatives’ tea and meals every day, and they don’t need to care about other things. The forty people are also divided into two shifts, and they only add incense and oil in front of the spirit, hang the curtain to keep the spirit, offer meals and tea, and raise mourning. , and other matters have nothing to do with them. These four people only take care of cups, saucers and tea utensils in the tea room. If there is one less, they will be asked to pay for four. These four people only manage wine and rice utensils. He pays four points. The eight single-pipe supervisors receive the sacrificial ceremony. The eight single-pipe lamps, candles, and paper slips, I will pay you all, and give you eight, and then go to each of them according to my fixed number. The 30 will take turns to spend the night in various places every day, taking care of the door, monitoring the candles, and cleaning the place. The rest are divided according to the house, someone guards a certain place, and all the tables and chairs in a certain place are antiqued, as for the phlegm. A box of duster brooms, if a grass or a seedling is lost or broken, will be settled with the person who guards the place. The daily general inspection of the Sheng's house may be lazy, gambling, drinking, or bickering. Go back and forth with me immediately. You have affection. After I found out, the old face of three or four lifetimes will not be taken care of. Now there are rules, and in the future, that line will be messed up, and only talk to that line. People with me in Su Ri will have their own with me. Watches and clocks, no matter how big or small, I have a certain time, and you also have a time clock in the room. I will order it at the second quarter, and I am having breakfast. If there is a licensing issue, it is only at the beginning of noon. At the beginning of Xu, I burned the paper at dusk. I went to check it out in person and handed over the keys when I came back for the night. The next day was still at the second hour of the day. I can’t say that we all worked hard for the past few days. Reward you.""","“These twenty,” she said “should be divided into two companies; ten in each company, whose sole daily duties should be to attend inside to the guests, coming and going, and to serve tea for them; while with any other matters, they needn’t have anything to do. These other twenty should also be divided into two companies, whose exclusive duties will be, day after day, to look after the tea and eatables of the relatives of our family; and these too will have no business to concern themselves with outside matters. These forty will again be divided into two companies, who will have nothing else to look to than to remain in front of the coffin and offer incense, renew the oil, hang up the streamers, watch the coffin, offer sacrifices of rice, and oblations of tea, and mourn with the mourners; and neither need they mind anything outside these duties. These four servants will be specially attached to the inner tea-rooms to look after cups, saucers and the tea articles generally; and in the event of the loss of any single thing, the four of them will have to make it good between them. These other four servants will have the sole charge of the articles required for eatables and wine; and should any get mislaid compensation will have likewise to be made by them. These eight servants will only have to attend to taking over the sacrificial offerings; while these eight will have nothing more to see to beyond keeping an eye over the lamps, oil, candles and paper wanted everywhere. I’ll have a whole supply served out and handed to you eight to by and by apportion to the various places, in quantities which I will determine. These thirty servants are each day, by rotation, to keep watch everywhere during the night, looking after the gates and windows, taking care of the fires and candles, and sweeping the grounds; while the servants, who remain, are to be divided for duty in the houses and rooms, each one having charge of a particular spot. And beginning from the tables, chairs and curios in each place, up to the very cuspidors and brooms, yea even to each blade of grass or sprout of herb, which may be there, the servants looking after this part will be called upon to make good anything that may be either mislaid or damaged. You, Lai Sheng’s wife, will every day have to exercise general supervision and inspection; and should there be those who be lazy, any who may gamble, drink, fight or wrangle, come at once and report the matter to me; and you mustn’t show any leniency, for if I come to find it out, I shall have no regard to the good old name of three or four generations, which you may enjoy. You now all have your fixed duties, so that whatever batch of you after this acts contrary to these orders, I shall simply have something to say to that batch and to no one else. The servants, who have all along been in my service, carry watches on their persons, and things, whether large or small, are invariably done at a fixed time. But, in any case, you also have clocks in your master’s rooms, so that at 6.30, I shall come and read the roll, and at ten you’ll have breakfast. Whenever there is any indent of any permits to be made or any report to be submitted, it should be done at 11.30 a.m. and no later. At 7 p.m., after the evening paper has been burnt, I shall come to each place in person to hold an inspection; and on my return, the servants on watch for the night will hand over the keys. The next day, I shall again come over at 6.30 in the morning; and needless to say we must all do the best we can for these few days; and when the work has been finished your master is sure to recompense you.” When she had done speaking, she went on to give orders that tea, oil, candles, feather dusters, brooms and other necessaries should be issued, according to the fixed quantities.","When she had looked at them all, Xi-feng proceeded to make her dispositions. ‘This twenty here. I want you to divide yourselves into two shifts of ten. Your job every day will be to look after lady visitors and serve them tea. That’s all you have to do. Nothing else. ‘This twenty here. I want you divided into two shifts like the others. Your job will be serving tea and meals to the family. Nothing else. ‘These forty. Again, two shifts. Your job is to look after the shrine: lighting fresh joss-sticks, keeping the lamps in oil, changing the drapes. You will also take turns by the spirit tablet, making offerings of rice and tea, kotowing when the visitors kotow, wailing when they wail. That is your job and nothing else besides. ‘You four are to look after the cups and plates and so forth in the ladies’ tea-room. If anything is missing, you share the responsibility between you and a quarter of the cost will be stopped out of each of your wages. ‘You four here are to look after the dinner-ware: bowls, wine-cups and the like. Anything missing will be stopped out of your wages. ‘This eight here. I want you to take charge of all funeral offerings sent in from outside. ‘This eight. I want you to look after oil, candles, and paper-offerings. I’m going to put the whole lot in your charge; then whenever any is needed somewhere, you must go to wherever it is and supply them with whatever amount I tell you to. ‘This twenty here. I want you doing night duty by rota. You are to see that all the gates are locked and keep a look-out for fires. You’ll also be responsible for keeping the outside properly swept. ‘The rest of you are to be divided up between the different apartments. Each of you will be responsible for the things in your own apartment, from furniture and antique ware down to spittoons and dusters. If the tiniest sliver gets lost or broken, you will be held responsible and will be expected to make it good. ‘Lai Sheng’s wife will make a general inspection every day, and if she catches anyone idling or gambling or drinking or fighting or being difficult, she will at once bring them to me for dealing with. And there will be no favouritism. If I find you’ve done something wrong, I shan’t care whether you’ve been in service here for three or four generations, it will make no difference to me. ‘Well, now you all know the rules. From now on whenever any trouble occurs I shall know exactly who to hold responsible. ‘Those who are used to working with me at the other place always have a watch handy, and everything they do, no matter how small a thing it is, is done at a fixed time. You may not have watches, but at least there is a clock in your master’s drawing-room you can look at. So here are the main times to remember. At half past six I shall come over to hear the roll-call. At ten o’clock I take my lunch. I shall see people with reports to make or tallies to collect up to, but not after, eleven o’clock. At seven in the evening, as soon as the paper-offerings have been burnt, I shall make a personal tour of inspection; and when I get back from it, I shall issue those on night duty with their keys. Then next day I shall be back here again at half past six. ‘I dare say we are all going to be a bit overworked during the days ahead, but I am sure your master will want to reward you all for your trouble when this is over.’"

原來這饅頭庵就是水月庵，因他廟裏做的饅頭好，就起了這個渾號，離鐵檻寺不遠。當下和尚工課已完，奠過晚茶，賈珍便命賈蓉請鳳姐歇息。鳳姐見還有幾個妯娌陪著女親，自己便辭了眾人，帶了寶玉、秦鍾往水月庵來。原來秦業年邁多病，不能在此，只命秦鍾等待安靈罷了。那秦鍾便只跟著鳳姐、寶玉，一時到了水月庵，淨虛帶領智善、智能兩個徒弟出來迎接，大家見過。鳳姐等來至淨室更衣淨手畢，因見智能兒越發長高了，模樣兒越發出息了，因說道：「你們師徒怎麼這些日子也不往我們那裏去？」淨虛道：「可是這幾天都沒工夫，因胡老爺府裏產了公子，太太送了十兩銀子來這裏，叫請幾位師父唸三日《血盆經》，忙的沒個空兒，就沒來請奶奶的安。」,"It turns out that this Mantou Nunnery is Shuiyue Nunnery. Because the steamed buns made in his temple are so good, it has this name. It is not far from Tiejian Temple. Now that the monk's class was over, and the evening tea was laid, Jia Zhen ordered Jia Rong to invite Sister Feng to rest. Seeing that there were still several sisters-in-law accompanying her daughter, Sister Feng resigned from everyone and brought Baoyu and Qin Zhong to Shuiyue Nunnery. It turned out that Qin Ye was old and sick, so he couldn't be here, so he only ordered Qin Zhong to wait for An Ling. Then Qin Zhong only followed Sister Feng and Baoyu to Shuiyue Nunnery, and Jing Xu led the two apprentices, Zhishan and Zhizhi, to greet them. Sister Feng waited when she came to the clean room to change her clothes and clean her hands. Seeing that Zhizhi had grown taller and looked more rested, she said, ""Why don't you master and disciple go to us these days?"" Jingxu said, ""But this I didn’t have time for a few days, because Mr. Hu gave birth to a son in his house, and his wife came here with 10 taels of silver to invite some masters to read the “Xuepenjing” for three days. Ann.""","This Bread Convent had at one time been styled the Shui Yueh nunnery (water moon); but as good bread was made in that temple, it gave rise to this nickname. This convent was not very distant from the Temple of the Iron Fence, so that as soon as the bonzes brought their functions to a close, and the sacrifice of evening was offered, Chia Chen asked Chia Jung to request lady Feng to retire to rest; and as lady Feng perceived that there still remained several sisters-in-law to keep company to the female relatives, she readily, of her own accord, took leave of the whole party, and, along with Pao-yue and Ch’in Chung, came to the Water Moon Convent. Ch’in Yeh, it must be noticed, was advanced in years and a victim to many ailments, so that he was unable to remain in the temple long, and he bade Ch’in Chung tarry until the coffin had been set in its resting place, with the result that Ch’in Chung came along, at the same time as lady Feng and Pao-yue, to the Water Moon Convent, where Ch’ing Hsue appeared, together with two neophytes, Chih Shan and Chih Neng, to receive them. After they had exchanged greetings, lady Feng and the others entered the “chaste” apartments to change their clothes and wash their hands; and when they had done, as she perceived how much taller in stature Chih Neng had grown and how much handsomer were her features, she felt prompted to inquire, “How is it that your prioress and yourselves haven’t been all these days as far as our place?” “It’s because during these days we haven’t had any time which we could call our own,” explained Ch’ing Hsue. “Owing to the birth of a son in Mr. Hu’s mansion, dame Hu sent over about ten taels and asked that we should invite several head-nuns to read during three days the service for the churching of women, with the result that we’ve been so very busy and had so little leisure, that we couldn’t come over to pay our respects to your ladyship.”","Some time previously she had sent someone to Wheatcake Priory to make arrangements on her behalf with the prioress Euergesia, and the old nun had turned out several rooms in readiness for her arrival. ‘Wheat-cake Priory’ (so-called because of the excellent steamed wheatbread made in its kitchens) was the popular name for Water-moon Priory, an offshoot of Water-moon Abbey situated at no great distance from the Temple of the Iron Threshold. Presently, when the monks had finished their service and the evening offering of tea had been made, Cousin Zhen sent Jia Rong in to Xi-feng with a message inviting her to retire. Having first glanced round to ascertain that a sufficient number of Jia ladies were present to look after the still remaining guests, Xi-feng bade the company good night and left for Wheatcake Priory with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong. Qin Zhong had attached himself to the other two when his father Qin Bang-ye, unable by reason of his age and frail state of health to risk a night away from home, had gone back to the city, leaving him to await the conclusion of the requiem services on his own. They soon arrived at the priory and were met by Euergesia, who had brought her two little disciples Benevolentia and Sapientia to welcome them. As soon as the first greetings were over, Xi-feng retired to her room to wash and change. Emerging refreshed, she observed how much taller Sapientia had grown and how radiantly good-looking, and inquired of Euergesia why she and her two charges had lately not been into town to see them. ‘It is on account of Mr Hu’s good lady,’ said the old nun. ‘She has lately been brought to bed of a boy, and sent us ten taels of silver for a three-day recital of the Lake of Blood sutra by some of the sisters to purge the stain of childbirth. We have been so busy with the arrangements that we haven’t had time to call.’"

Baoyu's quality of Daiyu in her heart became more and more ecstatic. Daiyu brought a lot of books, and was busy cleaning the bedroom, installing utensils, and distributing some pen and paper to Baochai, Yingchun, Baoyu and others. Baoyu also took out the wagtail incense string given by King Beijing and gave it to Daiyu. Daiyu said, ""What stinky man took it! I don't want him."" Baoyu had to take it back. No words for now.","But Pao-yue merely ascertained whether Tai-yue was all right, and did not even so much as trouble his mind with the rest of what he heard; and he remained on the tiptoe of expectation, till noon of the morrow; when, in point of fact, it was announced that Mr. Lien, together with Miss Lin, had made their entrance into the mansion. When they came face to face, grief and joy vied with each other; and they could not help having a good cry for a while; after which followed again expressions of sympathy and congratulations; while Pao-yue pondered within himself that Tai-yue had become still more surpassingly handsome. Tai-yue had also brought along with her a good number of books, and she promptly gave orders that the sleeping rooms should be swept, and that the various nicknacks should be put in their proper places. She further produced a certain quantity of paper, pencils and other such things, and distributed them among Pao Ch’ai, Ying Ch’un, Pao-yue and the rest; and Pao-yue also brought out, with extreme care, the string of Ling-ling scented beads, which had been given to him by the Prince of Pei Ching, and handed them, in his turn, to Tai-yue as a present. “What foul man has taken hold of them?” exclaimed Tai-yue. “I don’t want any such things;” and as she forthwith dashed them down, and would not accept them, Pao-yue was under the necessity of taking them back. But for the time being we will not allude to them, but devote our attention to Chia Lien.","Having waited with great impatience until the early afternoon of the following day, Bao-yu and the rest were rewarded with the announcement ‘Mr Lian and Miss Lin have just arrived!’ The joy of their reunion was, however, tempered with grief, because of the two deaths that had occurred since their parting, and for a while there was much loud weeping on either side. Then there were words of comfort and congratulation to exchange and Bao-yu had an opportunity of studying Dai-yu more carefully. He recognized the same ethereal quality he had always known in her, but it seemed to have deepened and intensified during her absence. She had brought a lot of books back with her and was soon busy superintending the sweeping out of her bedroom to accommodate them and arranging various objets d’art around it which had also formed part of her luggage. She had salvaged some paper, writing-brushes and other articles of stationery from her old home which she distributed as presents to Bao-chai, Ying-chun, Bao-yu and the rest. Bao-yu for his part hunted up the rosary of fragrant Indian beads given him by the Prince of Bei-jing and offered it as a gift to Dai-yu; but she flung it back at him disdainfully: ‘What, carry a thing that some coarse man has pawed over? I don’t want it!’ So Bao-yu was compelled to take it back again. But let us now turn to Jia Lian."
到晚間，眾人都在賈母前，定昏之餘，大家娘兒姊妹等說笑時，賈母因問寶釵愛聽何戲，愛喫何物等語。寶釵深知賈母年老人，喜熱鬧戲文，愛喫甜爛之食，便總依賈母往日素喜者說了出來。賈母更加歡悅。次日便先送過衣服玩物禮去，王夫人、鳳姐、黛玉等諸人皆有隨分不一，不須多記。,"In the evening, when everyone was in front of Jia's mother, and when she was about to faint, while the mothers and sisters were chatting and laughing, Jia's mother asked Baochai what drama he liked to listen to and what he liked to eat. Baochai knew that Jia's mother was an old man, she liked lively dramas, and she liked sweet and rotten food, so she always said it according to Jia's mother who was so happy in the past. Mother Jia was even more happy. The next day, I first sent clothes and toys, and Mrs. Wang, Sister Feng, Daiyu and others all had different scores, so there was no need to remember.","The old lady continued in the highest of spirits, and, when evening came, and they all appeared in her presence to pay their obeisance, her ladyship made it a point, while the whole company of ladies and young ladies were engaged in chatting, to ascertain of Pao-ch’ai what play she liked to hear, and what things she fancied to eat. Pao-ch’ai was well aware that dowager lady Chia, well up in years though she was, delighted in sensational performances, and was partial to sweet and tender viands, so that she readily deferred, in every respect, to those things, which were to the taste of her ladyship, and enumerated a whole number of them, which made the old lady become the more exuberant. And the next day, she was the first to send over clothes, nicknacks and such presents, while madame Wang and lady Feng, Tai-yue and the other girls, as well as the whole number of inmates had all presents for her, regulated by their degree of relationship, to which we need not allude in detail.","She loved to be teased, and Xi-feng’s bantering put her in great good humour. That night, when the young folk had finished paying their evening duty and were standing round her laughing and talking a while before retiring to their own apartments, Grandmother Jia asked Bao-chai what sort of plays she liked best and what her favourite dishes were. Bao-chai was well aware that her grandmother, like most old women, enjoyed the livelier, more rackety sort of plays and liked sweet and pappy things to eat, so she framed her answers entirely in terms of these preferences. The old lady was delighted. Next day presents of clothing and various other objects, to which Lady Wang, Xi-feng, Dai-yu and the rest had all contributed, were sent round to Bao-chai’s. Our narrative supplies no details."
這裏賈薔也悄問賈璉：「要什麼東西？順便帶來孝敬。」賈璉笑道：「你別興頭。纔學著辦事，倒先學會了這把戲。我短了什麼，少不得寫信來告訴你，且不要論到這裏。」說畢，打發他二人去了。,"Here Jia Qiang also quietly asked Jia Lian: ""What do you want? Bring filial piety by the way."" Jia Lian smiled and said, ""Don't be too excited. I learned to do things first, but I learned this trick first. What's wrong with me, I have to write a letter to tell me. Don't talk about it here."" After saying this, he sent the two of them away.","Chia Se, at this time, likewise, asked Chia Lien: “If you want anything (in the way of curtains), I can conveniently have them woven for you, along with the rest, and bring them as a present to you.” “Don’t be in such high glee!” Chia Lien urged with a grin, “you’ve but recently been learning how to do business, and have you come first and foremost to excel in tricks of this kind? If I require anything, I’ll of course write and tell you, but we needn’t talk about it.” Having finished speaking, he dismissed the two young men; and, in quick succession, servants came to make their business reports, not limited to three and five companies, but as Chia Lien felt exhausted, he forthwith sent word to those on duty at the second gate not to allow any one at all to communicate any reports, and that the whole crowd should wait till the next day, when he would give his mind to what had to be done.","Meanwhile Jia Qiang was making a somewhat similar proposal to Jia Lian. ‘If there’s anything I can get for you while I’m away, Uncle, I shall be glad to wangle it.’ ‘My, my!’ said Jia Lian. ‘Let’s not get carried away, then! I must say, for one who’s only just started, you certainly haven’t lost much time in picking up the tricks of the trade! Yes, I dare say I shall write and let you know if I find I’m short of anything.’ With these words he sent the two young men back to the other house."
黛玉又道：「這一節還恕得。再你為什麼又和雲兒使眼色？這個你是什麼心呢？莫不是他和我頑，他就自輕自賤了？他原是公侯的小姐，我原是貧民的丫頭，他和我頑，設若我回了口，豈不他自惹人輕賤呢。是這主意不是？這卻也是你的好心，衹是那一個偏又不領你這好情，一般也惱了。你又拿我作情，倒說我小性兒，行動肯惱。你又怕他得罪了我，我惱他。我惱他，與你何干？他得罪了我，又與你何干？」,"Daiyu said again: ""I can forgive this part. Then why do you wink with Yun'er again? What do you think about this? Could it be that he was stubborn with me, so he despised himself? He used to be the prince's young lady, I used to be a poor girl, and he was stubborn with me. If I answered back, wouldn't he be contemptuous of himself? Is that the idea? It's also your kindness, but it's good that the one doesn't lead you. I'm also annoyed in general. You make fun of me again, but you say I'm petty and willing to act. You're afraid that he will offend me, so I'm annoyed. I'm annoyed with him, what's the deal with you? He offended me , what does it have to do with you?""","Pao-yue could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had just heard, and Tai-yue went on to say. “This offence can, anyhow, be condoned; but, what is more, why did you also wink at Yuen Erh? What was this idea which you had resolved in your mind? wasn’t it perhaps that if she played with me, she would be demeaning herself, and making herself cheap? She’s the daughter of a duke or a marquis, and we forsooth the mean progeny of a poor plebeian family; so that, had she diverted herself with me, wouldn’t she have exposed herself to being depreciated, had I, perchance, said anything in retaliation? This was your idea wasn’t it? But though your purpose was, to be sure, honest enough, that girl wouldn’t, however, receive any favours from you, but got angry with you just as much as I did; and though she made me also a tool to do you a good turn, she, on the contrary, asserts that I’m mean by nature and take pleasure in irritating people in everything! and you again were afraid lest she should have hurt my feelings, but, had I had a row with her, what would that have been to you? and had she given me any offence, what concern would that too have been of yours?”","‘However,’ Dai-yu went on,’ that I could forgive. But what about that look you gave Yun ? Just what did you mean by that ? I think I know what you meant. You meant to warn her that she would cheapen herself by joking with me as an equal. Because she’s an Honourable and her uncle ’s a marquis and I’m only the daughter of a commoner, she mustn’t risk joking with me, because it would be so degrading for her if I were to answer back. That’s what you meant, isn’t it ? Oh yes, you had the kindest intentions. Only unfortunately she didn’t want your kind intentions and got angry with you in spite of them. So you tried to make it up with her at my expense, by telling her how touchy I am and how easily I get upset. You were afraid she might offend me, were you? As if it were any business of yours whether she offended me or not, or whether or not I got angry with her!’"
如今且說襲人自幼見寶玉性格異常，其淘氣憨頑自是出於眾小兒之外，更有幾件千奇百怪口不能言的毛病兒。近來仗著祖母溺愛，父母亦不能十分嚴緊拘管，更覺放蕩弛縱，任性恣情，最不喜務正。每欲勸時，料不能聽，今日可巧有贖身之論，故先用騙詞，以探其情，以壓其氣，然後好下箴規。今見他默默睡去了，知其情有不忍，氣已餒墮。自己原不想栗子喫的，只因怕為酥酪又生事故，亦如茜雪之茶等事，是以假以栗子為由，混過寶玉不提就完了。於是命小丫頭子們將栗子拿去喫了，自己來推寶玉。只見寶玉淚痕滿面，襲人便笑道：「這有什麼傷心的，你果然留我，我自然不出去了。」寶玉見這話有文章，便說道：「你倒說說，我還要怎麼留你，我自己也難說了。」襲人笑道：「咱們素日好處，再不用說。但今日你安心留我，不在這上頭。我另說出兩三件事來，你果然依了我，就是你真心留我了，刀擱在脖子上，我也是不出去的了。」,"Now, let's talk about Xiren seeing Baoyu's abnormal personality since childhood, his naughty and stubbornness is naturally out of many children, and there are also several strange and unspeakable problems. Recently, because of the doting of my grandmother, my parents can't be very strict. Whenever I want to persuade, I don’t expect to listen. Today, there is a theory of redemption. Therefore, I use deceitful words to test their feelings and suppress their anger, and then I will lay down the rules. Seeing him fall asleep silently now, knowing that he couldn't bear it, he was discouraged. I didn't want to eat chestnuts, because I was afraid of another accident because of the cheese, like the tea of Qianxue, so I used chestnuts as an excuse, and I didn't mention Baoyu. So he ordered the little girls to eat the chestnuts and push Baoyu by themselves. Seeing that Baoyu's face was covered in tears, Xiren laughed and said, ""What's so sad? You really keep me, so of course I won't go out."" Baoyu saw that there was an article in this sentence, and said, ""Tell me, what else should I do? It’s hard for me to tell you if I want to keep you.” Xiren smiled and said, “We have good things every day, no need to talk about it. But today you can leave me with peace of mind, not over here. I said two or three other things, and you really agree with me. Even if you leave me sincerely, with the knife on your neck, I won't go out.""","It must be noticed moreover that Hsi Jen had ever since her youth not been blind to the fact that Pao-yue had an extraordinary temperament, that he was self-willed and perverse, far even in excess of all young lads, and that he had, in addition, a good many peculiarities and many unspeakable defects. And as of late he had placed such reliance in the fond love of his grandmother that his father and mother even could not exercise any extreme control over him, he had become so much the more remiss, dissolute, selfish and unconcerned, not taking the least pleasure in what was proper, that she felt convinced, whenever she entertained the idea of tendering him advice, that he would not listen to her. On this day, by a strange coincidence, came about the discussion respecting her ransom, and she designedly made use, in the first instance, of deception with a view to ascertain his feelings, to suppress his temper, and to be able subsequently to extend to him some words of admonition; and when she perceived that Pao-yue had now silently gone to sleep, she knew that his feelings could not brook the idea of her return and that his temper had already subsided. She had never had, as far as she was concerned, any desire of eating chestnuts, but as she feared lest, on account of the cream, some trouble might arise, which might again lead to the same results as when Hsi Hsueeh drank the tea, she consequently made use of the pretence that she fancied chestnuts, in order to put off Pao-yue from alluding (to the cream) and to bring the matter speedily to an end. But telling forthwith the young waiting-maids to take the chestnuts away and eat them, she herself came and pushed Pao-yue; but at the sight of Pao-yue with the traces of tears on his face, she at once put on a smiling expression and said: “What’s there in this to wound your heart? If you positively do wish to keep me, I shall, of course, not go away!” Pao-yue noticed that these words contained some hidden purpose, and readily observed: “Do go on and tell me what else I can do to succeed in keeping you here, for of my own self I find it indeed difficult to say how!” “Of our friendliness all along,” Hsi Jen smilingly rejoined, “there’s naturally no need to speak; but, if you have this day made up your mind to retain me here, it isn’t through this friendship that you’ll succeed in doing so. But I’ll go on and mention three distinct conditions, and, if you really do accede to my wishes, you’ll then have shown an earnest desire to keep me here, and I won’t go, were even a sword to be laid on my neck!”","Since early youth Aroma had always been aware that Bao-yu’s character was peculiar. His naughtiness and intractability exceeded those of normal boys, and in addition he had a number of extraordinary eccentricities of his own which she could scarcely even have put a name to. Recently he had taken advantage of the comparative immunity from parental control, afforded him by the all-encompassing protection of his doting grandmother, to become even more wild and self-indulgent and even more confirmed in his aversion to serious pursuits than in previous years, and all her attempts to remonstrate with him met with the same obstinate unwillingness to hear. Today’s talk about buying her out of service turned out to be providential. By employing only a minimum of deceit, she could use it as a means of ascertaining his real feelings towards her and of humbling his spirit a little, so that he might be in a suitably chastened frame of mind for the lecture with which she was preparing to admonish him. She judged from his going off silently to bed that he was shaken and a little unsure of himself. Evidently she had succeeded in the first part of her plan. Aroma had not really wanted the chestnuts. She had pretended to do so because she was afraid that the matter of the koumiss might blow up into an incident like the earlier one involving Snowpink and the tea. By pretending to want chestnuts she had deflected him from pursuing it further. She now told the younger maids to take them away and eat them themselves, while she went over to rouse up Bao-yu. The face that he lifted from the pillow was wet with tears. ‘Now what do you want to go upsetting yourself like that for?’ she said with a smile. ‘If you really want me to stay, of course I won’t go.’ Bao-yu at once brightened up. ‘Tell me!’ he said. ‘Tell me what I must do to prove to you how much I want you to stay, since nothing I say myself seems any good !’ ‘I know we’re both fond of each other,’ said Aroma. ‘That doesn’t need any proving. But if you want to be sure of my staying here, it mustn’t only be because of that. There are three other things I want to talk to you about. If you will promise to obey me in all of them, I shall know that you really and truly want me to stay; then nothing – not even a knife at my throat – will ever make me leave you!’"
詩後便是此石墜落之鄉，投胎之處，親自經歷的一段陳跡故事。其中家庭閨閣瑣事，以及閑情詩詞倒還全備，或可適趣解悶；然朝代年紀，地輿邦國，卻反失落無考。,"After the poem is the town where the stone fell, the place where it was reincarnated, and a story that I personally experienced. Among them, the trivial matters of family boudoir, as well as the leisurely poems are still complete, which may be interesting to relieve boredom.","K’ung K’ung, the Taoist, having pondered over these lines for a while, became aware that this stone had a history of some kind. “Brother stone,” he forthwith said, addressing the stone, “the concerns of past days recorded on you possess, according to your own account, a considerable amount of interest, and have been for this reason inscribed, with the intent of soliciting generations to hand them down as remarkable occurrences.",From his reading of the inscription Vanitas realized that this was a stone of some consequence. Accordingly he addressed himself to it in the following manner:
鳳姐聽了滿臉是笑，不由的便止了步，問道：「怎麼好好的你娘兒們在背地裏嚼起我來？」賈蕓道：「有個原故，只因我有個朋友，家裏有幾個錢，現開香鋪。只因他身上捐著個通判，前兒選了雲南不知那一處，連家眷一齊去，他便收了香鋪不開了。把帳物攢了一攢，該給人的給人，該賤發的賤發了，象這細貴的貨，都分著送與親朋。他就一共送了我些冰片、麝香。我就和我母親商量，若要轉賣，不但賣不出原價來，而且誰家拿這些銀子買這個作什麼，便是很有錢的大家子，也不過使個幾分幾錢就挺折腰了；若說送人，也沒個人配使這些，倒叫他一文不值半文轉賣了。因此我就想起嬸子來。往年間我還見嬸子大包的銀子買這些東西呢，別說今年貴妃宮中，就是明兒這個端陽節，不用說這些香料自然是比往常加上十倍去的用呢。因此想來想去，衹有孝順嬸子一個人纔合式，方不算糟塌這東西。」一邊說，一邊將一個錦匣舉起來。,"When Sister Feng heard a smile on her face, she couldn't help but stop and asked, ""Why are your girls chewing me behind your back?"" Jia Yun said, ""There is a reason, it's just because I have a friend, a family member. There is a few money in it, and now the incense shop is opened. Just because he donated a general sentence, Qian Er chose Yunnan and did not know that place, and even his family went there, but he received the incense shop and could not open it. After a collection, the people who should be given to others, and the cheap ones who should be cheaply paid, like this delicate and expensive goods, they are all distributed to relatives and friends. He gave me some borneol and musk in total. I discussed with my mother. If you want to resell it, not only will you not be able to sell it at the original price, but whoever buys this for something with the money is a very wealthy family, and it will only be worth a few cents. If you say it is a gift, No one is worthy of these things, so he would sell them for nothing. That’s why I think of my aunt. In previous years, I saw my aunt buy these things with a lot of money, not to mention this year’s imperial concubine’s palace, this is tomorrow’s On the Duanyang Festival, it goes without saying that these spices are naturally used ten times more than usual. Therefore, after thinking about it, only the filial aunt is suitable, so it is not a bad thing."" As he said, he held up a brocade box. stand up.","As soon as lady Feng heard these words, her whole face beamed with smiles, and she unconsciously halted her steps, while she proceeded to ask: “How is it that, both your mother and yourself, tattle about me behind my back, without rhyme or reason?” “There’s a reason for it,” Chia Yuen observed, “which is simply this. I’ve an excellent friend with considerable money of his own at home, who recently kept a perfumery shop; but as he obtained, by purchase, the rank of deputy sub-prefect, he was, the other day, selected for a post in Yunnan, in some prefecture or other unknown to me; whither he has gone together with his family. He even closed this shop of his, and forthwith collecting all his wares, he gave away, what he could give away, and what he had to sell at a discount, was sold at a loss; while such valuable articles, as these, were all presented to relatives or friends; and that’s why it is that I came in for some baroos camphor and musk. But I at the time, deliberated with my mother that to sell them below their price would be a pity, and that if we wished to give them as a present to any one, there was no one good enough to use such perfumes. But remembering how you, aunt, had all along in years gone by, even to this day, to spend large bundles of silver, in purchasing such articles, and how, not to speak of this year with an imperial consort in the Palace, what’s even required for this dragon boat festival, will also necessitate the addition of hundred times as much as the quantity of previous years, I therefore present them to you, aunt, as a token of my esteem!” With these words still on his lips, he simultaneously produced an ornamented box, which he handed over to her. And as lady Feng was, at this time, making preparations for presents for the occasion of the dragon boat festival, for which perfumes were obligatory, she, with all promptitude, directed Feng Erh: “Receive Mr.","Xi-feng was now all smiles, and halted in spite of herself to hear more. ‘And why should you and your mother be chewing over my affairs behind my back, pray?’ ‘That’s a long story,’ said Jia Yun. ‘ A very good friend of mine who runs a perfumery and had quite a bit put by in savings decided to invest his money in a government post and bought himself the place of an Assistant Sub-Prefect. Well, a few days ago his posting came and it turns out to be for somewhere down in Yunnan. He’s taking his family with him, so of course he won’t be able to keep on the shop, and he’s been going over all his stock deciding what to give away and what to put in his clearance sale. He decided to give the more valuable stuff to friends and relations. My share was a whole quarter of a pound of Borneo camphor and another quarter of musk, and I was discussing with Mother last night what we ought to do with it. We don’t know anyone who could afford to buy it; and it seems a shame to sell it at less than the price; and even if we gave it away, we couldn’t think of anyone who would want so much. But then I suddenly thought of you and the packets of money you’ve spent on this kind of thing in years past, and I thought to myself that this year, what with Her Grace in the Palace and the Double Fifth already not far off, you’re sure to be using ten or twelve times the usual amount. So, to cut a long story short, we decided to make a present of it to you. There you are, Auntie -a little token of my esteem!’ As he spoke, he took out a small brocade-covered box and respectfully raised it in both hands to offer her. Now Xi-feng was just beginning to think about the problem of purchasing aromatics for the Double Fifth festival, and it pleased her very much to be relieved of the trouble of doing so – especially when it was in so agreeable a manner. She smiled at him graciously before turning to her maid: ‘Felicity, take my nephew’s present and give it to Patience to take care of!’"
原來這學中雖都是本族人丁與親戚的子弟，俗語說的好：「一龍生九種，種種各別。」未免人多了，就有龍蛇混雜，下流人物在內。自寶、秦二人來了，都生的花朵兒一般的模樣，又見秦鍾腼腆溫柔，未語面先紅，怯怯羞羞，有女兒之風；寶玉又是天生成慣能作小服低，賠身下氣，情性體貼，話語纏綿，因此二人更加親厚，也怨不得那起同窗人起了疑，背地裏你言我語，詬誶謠諑，佈滿書房。,"It turns out that although all of the students in this school are the children of their own clan and relatives, as the saying goes: ""One dragon gives birth to nine species, and each species is different."" When Zibao and Qin came, they both had the appearance of flowers, but Qin Zhong was shy and gentle, his face turned red before speaking, he was shy and shy, and had the style of a daughter; Baoyu was born and used to be able to make Xiaofu is low, humble, affectionate and considerate, and the words are lingering, so the two are more intimate, and they can't blame the classmate for being suspicious.","There were, it is true, a large number of pupils in this school, but these consisted of the sons and younger brothers of that same clan, and of several sons and nephews of family connections. The proverb appositely describes that there are nine species of dragons, and that each species differs; and it goes of course without saying that in a large number of human beings there were dragons and snakes, confusedly admixed, and that creatures of a low standing were included. Ever since the arrival of the two young fellows, Ch’in Chung and Pao-yue, both of whom were in appearance as handsome as budding flowers, and they, on the one hand, saw how modest and genial Ch’in Chung was, how he blushed before he uttered a word, how he was timid and demure like a girl, and on the other hand, how that Pao-yue was naturally proficient in abasing and demeaning himself, how he was so affable and good-natured, considerate in his temperament and so full of conversation, and how that these two were, in consequence, on such terms of intimate friendship, it was, in fact, no matter of surprise that the whole company of fellow-students began to foster envious thoughts, that they, behind their backs, passed on their account, this one one disparaging remark and that one another, and that they insinuated slanderous lies against them, which extended inside as well as outside the school-room.","All the pupils at the clan school were either members of the Jia clan or relations by marriage; but as the proverb rightly says, ‘there are nine kinds of dragon and no two kinds are alike’. Where many are gathered together the wheat is sure to contain a certain amount of chaff; and this school was no exception in numbering some very ill-bred persons among its pupils. The two new boys, Qin Zhong and Bao-yu, were both as beautiful as flowers; the other scholars observed how shrinking and gentle Qin Zhong was, blushing almost before you spoke to him and timid and bashful as a girl; they saw in Bao-yu one whom nature and habit had made humble and accommodating in spite of his social position, always willing to defer to others in the interest of harmony; they observed his affectionate disposition and familiar manner of speech; and they could see that the two friends were devoted to each other."
寶玉聽了此曲，散漫無稽，不見得好處；但其聲韻淒惋，竟能銷魂醉魄。因此也不察其原委，問其來歷，就暫以此釋悶而已。因又看下面道：,"When Baoyu heard this song, it was rambling and nonsense, not necessarily beneficial; but the rhythm and rhythm of its rhythm made him ecstatic. Therefore, I did not investigate its origins and asked its origins, so I temporarily used this to relieve my boredom. Because look at the following:","But to come to Pao-yue. After he had heard these ballads, so diffuse and vague, he failed to see any point of beauty in them; but the plaintive melody of the sound was nevertheless sufficient to drive away his spirit and exhilarate his soul. Hence it was that he did not make any inquiries about the arguments, and that he did not ask about the matter treated, but simply making these ballads the means for the time being of dispelling melancholy, he therefore went on with the perusal of what came below.",Which every season rained upon her woe ?

All the servants having tried to hush him and not succeeding, Chia Jung became exasperated; and forthwith blew him up for a time. “Let some one bind him up,” he cried, “and tomorrow, when he’s over the wine, I’ll call him to task, and we’ll see if he won’t seek death.” Chiao Ta showed no consideration for Chia Jung. On the contrary, he shouted with more vigour. Going up to Chia Jung: “ Brother Jung,” he said, “don’t put on the airs of a master with Chiao Ta. Not to speak of a man such as you, why even your father and grandfather wouldn’t presume to display such side with Chiao Ta. Were it not for Chiao Ta, and him alone, where would your office, honours, riches and dignity be? Your ancestor, whom I brought back from the jaws of death, heaped up all this estate, but up to this very day have I received no thanks for the services I rendered! on the contrary, you come here and play the master; don’t say a word more, and things may come right; but if you do, I’ll plunge the blade of a knife white in you and extract it red.” Lady Feng, from inside the carriage, remarked to Chia Jung: “Don’t you yet pack off this insolent fellow! Why, if you keep him in your house, won’t he be a source of mischief ? Besides, were relatives and friends to hear about these things, won’t they have a laugh at our expense, that a household like ours should be so devoid of all propriety?” Chia Jung assented.","He was just getting into his stride when Jia Rong came out to see Xi-feng off in her carriage. The servants shouted to Big Jiao to stop, but without success. Impatient of the old man’s insolence, Jia Rong cursed him angrily. ‘Tie him up,’ he said to the servants. ‘We shall see if he is still so eager for death tomorrow morning, when he has sobered up a bit.’ But Big Jiao was not to be intimidated by such as Jia Rong. On the contrary, he staggered up to him and bellowed even louder. ‘Oh ho! Little Rong, is it? Don’t you come the Big Master stuff with me, sonny boy! Never mind a little bit of a kid like you, even your daddy and your granddaddy don’t dare to try any funny stuff with Old Jiao. If it wasn’t for Old Jiao, where would you lot all be today, with your rank and your fancy titles and your money and all the other things you enjoy? It was your great-granddad, whose life I saved when he was given up for dead, that won all this for you, by the sweat of his brow. And what reward do I get for saving him ? Nothing. Instead you come to me and you put on your Big Master act. Well, I’ll tell you something. You’d better watch out. Because if you don’t, you’re going to get a shiny white knife inside you, and it’s going to come out red!’ ‘You’d better hurry up and send this unspeakable creature about his business,’ said Xi-feng to Jia Rong from her carriage. ‘It’s positively dangerous to keep a man like this on the premises. If any of our acquaintance get to know that a family like ours can’t keep even a semblance of discipline about the place, we shall become a laughing-stock.’ Jia Rong assented meekly."
林黛玉信步便往怡紅院中來，只見幾個丫頭舀水，都在迴廊上圍著看畫眉洗澡呢。聽見房內有笑聲，林黛玉便入房中看時，原來是李宮裁、鳳姐、寶釵都在這裏呢，一見他進來都笑道：「這不又來了一個。」林黛玉笑道：「今兒齊全，誰下帖子請來的？」鳳姐道：「前兒我打發了丫頭送了兩瓶茶葉去，你往那去了？」林黛玉笑道：「哦，可是倒忘了，多謝多謝。」鳳姐兒又道：「你嘗了可還好不好？」沒有說完，寶玉便說道：「論理可倒罷了，衹是我說不大甚好，也不知別人嘗著怎麼樣。」寶釵道：「味倒輕，衹是顏色不大好些。」鳳姐道：「那是暹羅進貢來的。我嘗著也沒什麼趣兒，還不如我每日喫的呢。」林黛玉道：「我喫著好，不知你們的脾胃是怎樣？」寶玉道：「你果然愛喫，把我這個也拿了去喫罷。」鳳姐笑道：「你要愛喫，我那裏還有呢。」林黛玉道：「果真的，我就打發丫頭取去了。」鳳姐道：「不用取去，我打發人送來就是了。我明兒還有一件事求你，一同打發人送來。」,"Lin Daiyu walked to the Yihong Courtyard, only to see a few girls scooping water, all around the corridor watching Thrush taking a bath. Hearing laughter in the room, Lin Daiyu entered the room to see that it turned out that Li Gongcai, Sister Feng, and Baochai were all here. When they saw him coming in, they all laughed and said, ""This is another one."" Lin Daiyu said with a smile: ""Today is complete, who invited you to post?"" Sister Feng said, ""I sent the girl to send two bottles of tea, where are you going?"" Lin Daiyu smiled and said, ""Oh, but I forgot, thank you Thank you very much."" Sister Feng said again, ""Is it okay if you tasted it?"" Before finishing speaking, Baoyu said, ""It's a logical reason, but I don't say it's very good, and I don't know how others have tasted it."" Baochai said: ""The taste is lighter, but the color is not so good."" Sister Feng said, ""It was a tribute from Siam. I don't have much fun in tasting it. It's not as good as what I eat every day."" Lin Daiyu said: "" I eat well, but what is your spleen and stomach?"" Baoyu said, ""You really like to eat, so take this one of mine and eat it."" Sister Feng smiled, ""If you like to eat, I still have it there."" Lin Daiyu said, ""If it's true, I'll send the girl to take it."" Sister Feng said, ""You don't need to take it, I'll send someone to bring it. I have one more thing to ask you tomorrow, so I'll send someone to bring it together.""","There they found several servant-girls baling out water; while a bevy of them stood under the verandah, watching the thrushes having their bath. They heard also the sound of laughter in the rooms. The fact is that Li Kung-ts’ai, lady Feng, and Pao-ch’ai were assembled inside. As soon as they saw them walk in, they with one voice shouted, smiling: “Now, are not these two more!” “We are a full company to-day,” laughed Tai-yue, “but who has issued the cards and invited us here?” “The other day,” interposed lady Feng, “I sent servants with a present of two caddies of tea for you, Miss Lin; was it, after all, good?” “I had just forgotten all about it,” Tai-yue rejoined, “many thanks for your kind attention! “I tasted it,” observed Pao-yue. “I did not think it anything good. But I don’t know how others, who’ve had any of it, find it.” “Its flavour,” said Tai-yue, “is good; the only thing is, it has no colour.” “It’s tribute tea from the Laos Kingdom,” continued lady Feng. “When I tried it, I didn’t either find it anything very fine. It’s not up to what we ordinarily drink.” “To my taste, it’s all right,” put in Tai-yue. “But what your palates are like, I can’t make out.” “As you say it’s good,” suggested Pao-yue, “you’re quite at liberty to take all I have for your use.” “I’ve got a great deal more of it over there,” lady Feng remarked. “I’ll tell a servant-girl to go and fetch it,” Tai-yue replied. “No need,” lady Feng went on. “I’ll send it over with some one. I also have a favour to ask of you to-morrow, so I may as well tell the servant to bring it along at the same time.”","Almost without thinking where she was going, she made her way to the House of Green Delights. A group of maids had fetched some water from the well and were watching the white-eyes in the gallery giving themselves a bath. A sound of laughter came from inside the house. Li Wan, Xi-feng and Bao-chai were there already. Their friendly laughter greeted Dai-yu as she entered: ‘Another one! Come in! Come in!’ ‘ What is this ?’ said Dai-yu, joining in the good humour. ‘A party?’ ‘I sent someone round to you the other day with two caddies-full of tea,’ said Xi-feng, ‘but you were out.’ ‘Yes,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’m sorry: I forgot to thank you.’ ‘Have you tried it?’ said Xi-feng. ‘What did you think of it?’ ‘I wouldn’t ask, if I were you,’ said Bao-yu, chipping in. ‘I thought it was rotten. I don’t know what the rest of you thought about it.’ ‘I thought the flavour was all right,’ said Bao-chai. ‘The colour wasn’t up to much.’ ‘That was tribute tea from Siam,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I didn’t like it at all. I thought it wasn’t as nice as the tea we drink every day. ‘Oh, I quite liked it,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Your palates must be more sensitive than mine.’ ‘If you really like it,’ said Bao-yu, ‘you’re welcome to have mine.’ ‘I’ve still got quite a bit left,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If you really like it, you can have it all.’ ‘Thank you very much,’ said Dai-yu. ‘I’ll send someone round to fetch it.’ ‘No, don’t do that,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ll send it round to you. There’s something I want you to do for me. The person I send round about it can bring the tea as well.’"
眾人道：「妙則妙矣，衹是『斜陽』二字不妥。」那人道：「古人詩云『蘼蕪滿手泣斜暉』。」眾人道：「頹喪，頹喪。」又一人道：「我也有一聯，諸公評閱評閱。」因唸道：「三徑香風飄玉蕙，一庭明月照金蘭。」,"The people said, ""Wonderful is wonderful, but the word 'setting sun' is not right."" The other person said, ""The ancients said, 'The millet is full of tears, and the hands are full of tears.'"" The people said, ""Depressed, depressed."" Another person said: ""I also have a couplet, and the princes will review and review."" Yin read: ""Three paths fragrant wind floats jade Hui, and a bright moon shines on Jin orchid.""","“As far as excellence is concerned, it’s excellent,” observed the whole party, “but the two words representing ‘with oblique beams’ are not felicitous.” And as some one quoted the line from an old poem: The angelica fills the court with tears, what time the sun doth slant. “Lugubrious, lugubrious!” expostulated the company with one voice. Another person then interposed. “I also have a couplet, whose merits you, gentlemen, can weigh; it runs as follows: “Along the three pathways doth float the Yue Hui scented breeze! The radiant moon in the whole hall shines on the gold orchid!”","‘Not bad,’ said the others. ‘But why “sunset courtyard”?’ ‘I was thinking of that line in the old poem,’ said the man: ‘The garden’s gillyflowers at sunset weep. After all, you have already got “dewy” in the name. I thought the “sunset weeping” would go with it rather well.’ ‘Feeble! Feeble!’ cried the rest. ‘I’ve thought of a couplet, too,’ said one of the others. ‘ Let me have your opinion of it: Down garden walks a fragrant breeze caresses beds of melilot. By courtyard walls a brilliant moon illumines golden orchises.’"
可巧王夫人見賈環下了學，便命他來抄個《金剛咒》唪誦唪誦。那賈環正在王夫人炕上坐著，命人點燈，拿腔作勢的抄寫。一時又叫彩雲倒杯茶來，一時又叫玉釧兒來剪剪蠟花，一時又說金釧兒擋了燈影。眾丫鬟們素日厭惡他，都不答理。衹有彩霞還和他合的來，倒了一鐘茶來遞與他。因見王夫人和人說話兒，他便悄悄的向賈環說道：「你安些分罷，何苦討這個厭那個厭的。」賈環道：「我也知道了，你別哄我。如今你和寶玉好，把我不答理，我也看出來了。」彩霞咬著嘴唇，向賈環頭上戳了一指頭，說道：「沒良心的！狗咬呂洞賓，不識好人心。」,"Coincidentally, when Mrs. Wang saw Jia Huan leaving school, she ordered him to copy the ""Vajra Mantra"" and recite it. That Jia Huan was sitting on Madam Wang's kang, ordering someone to light the lamp, and copying it in a pretentious manner. At one time, I asked Caiyun to pour a cup of tea, at another time I asked Yu Chuan'er to cut the wax flowers, and at another time, I said that Jin Chuan'er blocked the shadow of the lights. The maids always hated him and ignored him. Only Caixia was still with him, poured a bell of tea and handed it to him. Seeing Mrs. Wang talking to someone, he quietly said to Jia Huan, ""You're better off, why bother with this one and the other."" Jia Huan said, ""I know it too, don't coax me. Now You and Baoyu are on good terms, and I can see that if you ignore me."" Caixia bit her lip, poked her finger on Jia Huan's head, and said, ""You have no conscience! A dog who bites Lu Dongbin doesn't know a good person.""","Madame Wang was sitting in Mrs. Hsueeh’s apartments, whither she had just crossed, when she perceived Chia Huan come back from school, and she bade him transcribe incantations out of the Chin Kang Canon and intonate them. Chia Huan accordingly came and seated himself on the stove-couch, occupied by Madame Wang, and, directing a servant to light the candles, he started copying in an ostentatious and dashing manner. Now he called Ts’ai Hsia to pour a cup of tea for him. Now he asked Yu Ch’uan to take the scissors and cut the snuff of the wick. “Chin Ch’uan!” he next cried, “you’re in the way of the rays of the lamp.” The servant-girls had all along entertained an antipathy for him, and not one of them therefore worried her mind about what he said. Ts’ai Hsia was the only one who still got on well with him, so pouring a cup of tea, she handed it to him. But she felt prompted to whisper to him: “Keep quiet a bit! what’s the use of making people dislike you?” “I know myself how matters stand,” Chia Huan rejoined, as he cast a steady glance at her; “so don’t you try and befool me! Now that you are on intimate terms with Pao-yue, you don’t pay much heed to me. I’ve also seen through it myself.” Ts’ai Hsiao set her teeth together, and gave him a fillip on the head. “You heartless fellow!” she cried. “You’re like the dog, that bit Lue T’ung-pin. You have no idea of what’s right","Not long before they returned, Jia Huan got back from school and Lady Wang gave him the task of copying out the text of that prolonger of life and highly efficacious prophylactic against sickness and misfortune, the Dharani of the Immaculate Diamond. He seated himself on Lady Wang’s kang, called for a candle to be lit, and, with a great deal of self-important fuss, began his copying, one minute calling for Suncloud to pour him tea, the next requiring Silver to trim the wick of his candle, and shortly after that informing Golden that she was standing in his light. The maids all hated Jia Huan and took no notice – all, that is, except Sunset, who had always had a soft spot for him. She poured him a cup of tea and, observing that Lady Wang was engaged in conversation with someone elsewhere in the apartment, quietly counselled some restraint: ‘Try not to throw your weight about so!’ she said. ‘It’s silly to put people’s backs up.’ Jia Huan scowled angrily: ‘I know what I’m doing,’ he said. ‘Don’t talk to me like a child! You’re friends with Bao-yu nowadays, are’nt you? You don’t like me any more. I know. I’ve watched you both.’ Sunset clenched her teeth. She stabbed the air above his head with her finger: ‘You ungrateful thing! You’re like the dog that bit Lü Dong-bin : you don’t know a friend when you see one.’"
剛至穿堂門前，只見襲人倚門立在那裏，一見寶玉平安回來，堆下笑來問道：「叫你作什麼？」寶玉告訴他：「沒有什麼，不過怕我進園去淘氣，吩咐吩咐。」一面說，一面回至賈母跟前，回明原委。,"As soon as he arrived at the door of the hall, he saw Xiren leaning against the door and standing there. When he saw Baoyu returning safely, he smiled and asked, ""What do you want to do?"" Baoyu told him, ""It's nothing, but I was afraid that I would go into the garden to be naughty, so I ordered Order."" As he said that, he went back to Mother Jia and explained the whole story.","But no sooner had he reached the door of the corridor than he espied Hsi Jen standing leaning against the side; who perceiving Pao-yue come back safe and sound heaped smile upon smile, and asked: “What did he want you for?” “There was nothing much,” Pao-yue explained, “he simply feared that I would, when I get into the garden, be up to mischief, and he gave me all sorts of advice;” and, as while he explained matters, they came into the presence of lady Chia, he gave her a clear account, from first to last, of what had transpired.","Arriving at the entrance of the covered passage-way he came upon Aroma leaning in the doorway. Her face lit up when she saw him returning unscathed and she asked him what his father had wanted to see him about. ‘Oh, nothing much,’ said Bao-yu. ‘ He just wanted to say a few words about not getting up to mischief after we’ve moved into the garden.’ Having answered Aroma, he went in to see his grandmother and told her about the interview."
那時秦鍾正騎馬隨著他父親的轎，忽見寶玉的小廝跑來，請他去打尖。秦鍾看時，只見鳳姐兒的車往北而去，後面拉著寶玉的馬，搭著鞍籠，便知寶玉同鳳姐坐車，自己也便帶馬趕上來，同入一莊門內。早有家人將眾莊漢攆盡。那莊農人家無多房舍，婆娘們無處回避，只得由他們去了。那些村姑莊婦見了鳳姐、寶玉、秦鍾的人品衣服，禮數款段，豈有不愛看的？,"At that time, Qin Zhong was riding with his father's sedan chair when he saw Baoyu's servant running up and asked him to strike. When Qin Zhong looked at it, he saw that Sister Feng's car was heading north, with Baoyu's horse behind him with a saddle cage. Some family members have already driven all the villagers away. The farmer's family had few houses, and the mother-in-law had nowhere to hide, so they had to go. Those village women who saw Fengjie, Baoyu, and Qin Zhong's personal clothes and courtesies, wouldn't they like to see them?","Ch’in Chung was at this moment on horseback following in the track of his father’s carriage, when unexpectedly he caught sight of Pao-yue’s page, come at a running pace and invite him to have some refreshment. Ch’in Chung perceived from a distance that the horse, which Pao-yue had been riding, walked behind lady Feng’s vehicle, as it went towards the north, with its saddle and bridles all piled up, and readily concluding that Pao-yue must be in the same carriage with that lady, he too turned his horse and came over in haste and entered, in their company, the door of a farm-house. This dwelling of the farmer’s did not contain many rooms so that the women and girls had nowhere to get out of the way; and when the village lasses and country women perceived the bearing and costumes of lady Feng, Pao-yue, and Ch’in Chung, they were inclined to suspect that celestial beings had descended into the world.","As the page came hurrying up and asked him to stop with Bao-yu for a little refreshment, he turned round and saw Bao-yu ’s horse in the distance, jogging along in a northerly direction with an empty saddle on its back behind Xi-feng’s carriage, and he realized that Bao-yu must be inside the carriage with Xi-feng. Turning his horse’s head about, he hurried after, and followed them into the gateway of a farm. Apart from the barns and outhouses, the farmhouse consisted of little more than a single large room, so that there was nowhere the farmer ’s womenfolk could go to be out of the way of the visitors. The sudden appearance in their midst of Xi-feng, Bao-yu and Qin Zhong with their fashionable clothes and delicate city faces seemed to these simple countrywomen more like a celestial visitation than a human one."
鳳姐兒答應著出來，見過了王夫人，到了家中，平兒將烘的家常的衣服給鳳姐兒換了。鳳姐兒方坐下，問道：「家裏沒有什麼事麼？」平兒方端了茶來，遞了過去，說道：「沒有什麼事。就是那三百銀子的利銀，旺兒媳婦送進來，我收了。再有瑞大爺使人來打聽奶奶在家沒有，他要來請安說話。」,"Sister Feng agreed to come out, met Mrs. Wang, and when she arrived at home, Ping Er changed the home-made clothes that she had baked for Sister Feng. Sister Feng sat down and asked, ""Is there any business at home?"" Ping'erfang brought tea, handed it over, and said, ""It's nothing. It's the 300 silver coins, which Wang's daughter-in-law will send to you. Come in, I'll take it. If Uncle Rui sends someone to ask if Grandma is at home, he will come and ask An to speak.""","Erh helped lady Feng to put on the house costume, which she had warmed by the fire, and lady Feng eventually took a seat and asked “whether there was anything doing at home?” P’ing Erh then brought the tea, and after going over to hand the cup: “There’s nothing doing,” she replied; “as regards the interest on the three hundred taels, Wang Erh’s wife has brought it in, and I’ve put it away. Besides this, Mr. Jui sent round to inquire if your ladyship was at home or not, as he meant to come and pay his respects and to have a chat.”","Xi-feng said yes, she would, and after calling on Lady Wang, went back to her own apartment, where Patience had warmed her everyday clothes for her to change into. When she had changed, she sat down and asked Patience if anything had happened during her absence. ‘Nothing, really,’ said Patience, handing her some tea. ‘Brightie’s wife came with the interest on the three hundred taels of silver and I received it for you. Oh, and Mr Rui sent someone to ask if you were in. He wants to pay you a call and talk about something.’"
如今周瑞家的故順路先往這裏來，只見幾個小丫頭子都在抱廈內聽呼喚默坐。迎春的丫鬟司棋與探春的丫鬟侍書二人正掀簾子出來，手裏都捧著茶盤茶鐘，周瑞家的便知他們姊妹在一處坐著呢，遂進入內房，只見迎春探春二人正在窗下圍棋。周瑞家的將花送上，說明緣故。二人忙住了棋，都欠身道謝，命丫鬟們收了。,"Now that Zhou Rui's family came here first, I saw a few little girls sitting in silence listening to the call. Yingchun's maid, Siqi, and Tanchun's maid, Shishu, were lifting the curtain and coming out, both holding tea trays and tea clocks. Zhou Rui's family knew that their sisters were sitting together, so they entered the inner room and saw Yingchun Tanchun II. People are playing Go at the window. Zhou Rui's family sent flowers to explain the reason. The two were busy with chess, and they both thanked themselves and ordered the maids to accept them.","Chou Jui’s wife, therefore, on this occasion came first to these rooms as they were on her way, but she only found a few waiting-maids assembled in the antechamber, waiting silently to obey a call. Ying Ch’un’s waiting-maid, Ssu Chi, together with Shih Shu, T’an Ch’un’s waiting-maid, just at this moment raised the curtain, and made their egress, each holding in her hand a tea-cup and saucer; and Chou Jui’s wife readily concluding that the young ladies were sitting together also walked into the inner room, where she only saw Ying Ch’un and T’an Ch’un seated near the window, in the act of playing chess. Mrs. Chou presented the flowers and explained whence they came, and what they were. The girls forthwith interrupted their game, and both with a curtsey, expressed their thanks, and directed the waiting-maids to put the flowers away.","Thither, accordingly, Zhou Rui’s wife now directed her steps. A number of little maids were sitting under the eaves there waiting to be called, and just as she arrived, Ying-chun’s maid Chess and Tan-chun’s maid Scribe came through the portiere, each carrying a teacup on a tray, from which she deduced that the two cousins must be inside together. On entering the room, Zhou’s wife found Ying-chun and Tan-chun sitting by the window playing Go. She presented the flowers and explained who they were from, and the two girls stopped their game for a moment to bow their thanks, and gave orders to the maids to take charge of them."
後面又是一座荒村野店，有一美人在那裏紡績。其判云：「勢敗休云貴，家亡莫論親。偶因濟劉氏，巧得遇恩人。」,"In the back is a wild village shop, where a beautiful woman is spinning. His verdict said: ""If you are defeated, you will not be able to count your relatives. If you help Liu's family, you are lucky enough to meet a benefactor.""","A pretty girl sat in there, spinning thread. These were the sentiments affixed below: When riches will have flown will honours then avail? When ruin breaks your home, e’en relatives will fail! But sudden through the aid extended to Dame Liu, A friend in need fortune will make to rise for you.","Next was a cottage in a deserted village inside which a beautiful girl sat spinning, followed by these words: When power is lost, rank matters not a jot; When families fall, kinship must be forgot. Through a chance kindness to a country wife Deliverance came for your afflicted life."
一語未了，忽聽外面人說：「林姑娘來了。」說猶未了，林黛玉已搖搖的走了進來　一見了寶玉，便笑道：「噯喲，我來的不巧了！」寶玉等忙起身笑讓坐。寶釵因笑道：「這話怎麼說？」黛玉笑道：「早知他來，我就不來了。」寶釵道：「更不解這意。」黛玉笑道：「要來時一群都來，要不來一個也不來；今兒他來了，明兒我再來，如此間錯開了來著，豈不天天有人來了？也不至於太冷落，也不至於太熱鬧了。姐姐如何不解這意思？」,"Before she could say a word, she suddenly heard someone from outside say, ""Miss Lin is here."" Before she could say anything, Lin Daiyu walked in and saw Baoyu, and smiled, ""Ah, it's unfortunate that I'm here! "" Baoyu waited hurriedly and got up and smiled and let him sit. Baochai smiled and said, ""How do you say this?"" Daiyu said with a smile, ""If I had known he was coming, I wouldn't have come."" Baochai said, ""I don't understand the meaning."" When they come, a group will come, or not one will come; today he is here, tomorrow I will come again, so the time is staggered, don’t people come every day? It’s not too cold, and it’s not too It's lively. Why doesn't my sister understand this?""","she exclaimed forthwith, smirking significantly when she caught sight of Pao-yue. Pao-yue and the rest lost no time in rising and offering her a seat, whereupon Pao Ch’ai added with a smile, “How can you say such things?” “Had I known sooner,” continued Tai-yue, “that he was here, I would have kept away.” “I can’t fathom this meaning of yours,” protested Pao Ch’ai. “If one comes,” Tai-yue urged smiling, “then all come, and when one doesn’t come, then no one comes. Now were he to come to-day, and I to come to-morrow, wouldn’t there be, by a division of this kind, always some one with you every day? and in this way, you wouldn’t feel too lonely, nor too crowded. How is it, cousin, that you didn’t understand what I meant to imply?”","Just at that moment the servants outside announced ‘Miss Lin’ and almost simultaneously Dai-yu came flouncing into the room. Catching sight of Bao-yu she let out a wail of mock dismay. ‘Oh dear! I have chosen a bad time to come!’ The others rose and invited her to be seated. ‘Why did you say that?’ Bao-chai asked her. ‘If I had known he was coming, I shouldn’t have come myself.’ ‘What exactly do you mean by that?’ ‘What do I mean by that?’ said Dai-yu. ‘I mean that if I only come when he does, then when I don’t come you won’t have any visitors. Whereas if we space ourselves out so that he comes one day and I come the next , it will never get either too lonely or too noisy for you. I shouldn’t have thought that needed much explaining.’"

說著，順著腳一徑來至一個院門前，只見鳳尾森森，龍吟細細。舉目望門上一看，只見匾上寫著「瀟湘館」三字。寶玉信步走入，只見湘簾垂地，悄無人聲。走至窗前，覺得一縷幽香從碧紗窗中暗暗透出。寶玉便將臉貼在紗窗上，往裏看時，耳內忽聽得細細的長嘆了一聲道：「『每日家情思睡昏昏。』」寶玉聽了，不覺心內癢將起來，再看時，只見黛玉在床上伸懶腰。寶玉在窗外笑道：「為甚麼『每日家情思睡昏昏』？」一面說，一面掀簾子進來了。,"As he said that, he followed the path of his feet to the front of a courtyard, only to see the phoenix tails are dense, and the dragon's yin was thin. Looking up at the door, I saw the words ""Xiaoxiang Pavilion"" written on the plaque. Baoyu walked in, only to see the Hunan curtain hanging down, and there was no sound. When I walked to the window, I felt a faint fragrance leaking out from the blue screen. Baoyu put her face on the screen window, and when she looked in, she suddenly heard a long, thin sigh: ""'Daily family feelings are drowsy.'"" When she got up and looked again, she saw Daiyu stretching on the bed. Baoyu laughed outside the window and said, ""Why is it 'Daily Family Feelings and I'm drowsy'?""","Saying this, he continued his way and straightway reached the entrance of a court. Here the bamboo foliage was thick, and the breeze sighed gently. This was the Hsiao Hsiang lodge. Pao-yue listlessly rambled in. He saw a bamboo portiere hanging down to the ground. Stillness prevailed. Not a human voice fell on the ear. He advanced as far as the window. Noticing that a whiff of subtle scent stole softly through the green gauze casement, Pao-yue applied his face closely against the frame to peep in, but suddenly he caught the faint sound of a deep sigh and the words: “Day after day my feelings slumber drowsily!” Upon overhearing this exclamation, Pao-yue unconsciously began to feel a prey to inward longings; but casting a second glance, he saw Tai-yue stretching herself on the bed. “Why is it,” smiled Pao-yue, from outside the window, “that your feelings day after day slumber drowsily?” So saying, he raised the portiere and stepped in.","You’d better not waste time jawing, then,’ said Bao-yu, and left the young toxophilite to his pursuits. Moving on, without much thinking where he was going, he came presently to the gate of a courtyard. Denser than feathers on the phoenix’ tail The stirred leaves murmured with a pent dragon’s moan. The multitudinous bamboos and the board above the gate confirmed that his feet had, without conscious direction, carried him to the Naiad’s House. Of their own accord they now carried him through the gateway and into the courtyard. The House seemed silent and deserted, its bamboo door-blind hanging unrolled to the ground; but as he approached the window, he detected a faint sweetness in the air, traceable to a thin curl of incense smoke which drifted out through the green gauze of the casement. He pressed his face to the gauze; but before his eyes could distinguish anything, his ear became aware of a long, languorous sigh and the sound of a voice speaking: ‘Each day in a drowsy waking dream of love.’ Bao-yu felt a sudden yearning for the speaker. He could see her now. It was Dai-yu, of course, lying on her bed, stretching herself and yawning luxuriously. He laughed: ‘Why “each day in a drowsy waking dream of love”?’ he asked through the window (the words were from his beloved Western Chamber); then going to the doorway he lifted up the door-blind and walked into the room."
次日早起，鳳姐往上屋去後，平兒收拾賈璉在外的衣服鋪蓋，不承望枕套中抖出一綹青絲來。平兒會意，忙拽在袖內，便走至這邊房內來，拿出頭髮來，向賈璉笑道：「這是什麼？」賈璉看見著了忙，搶上來要奪。平兒便跑，被賈璉一把揪住，按在炕上，掰手要奪，口內笑道：「小蹄子，你不趁早拿出來，我把你膀子撅折了。」平兒笑道：「你就是沒良心的。我好意瞞著他來問，你只賭狠！你只賭狠，等他回來我告訴他，看你怎麼著。」賈璉聽說，忙陪笑央求道：「好親人兒，賞我罷，我再不賭狠了。」,"The next morning, when Sister Feng went up to the room, Ping'er packed Jia Lian's clothes and bedding, and did not expect a strand of blue silk to shake out of the pillowcase. Ping'er understood, and hurriedly tugged it in his sleeve, so he walked to this room, took out his hair, and smiled at Jia Lian, ""What is this?"" Ping'er ran, was grabbed by Jia Lian, pressed it on the kang, and was about to grab it. He smiled and said, ""Little hoof, if you don't take it out as soon as possible, I will break your arm."" Ping'er laughed. ""You have no conscience. I have the good intentions to ask him without telling the truth. You only bet hard! You only bet hard. When he comes back, I will tell him and see what happens to you."" My dear, reward me, I won't bet any more.""","The next day, at an early hour, after lady Feng had gone into the upper rooms, P’ing Erh set to work to put in order the clothes and bedding, which had been brought from outside, when, contrary to her expectation, a tress of hair fell out from inside the pillow-case, as she was intent upon shaking it. P’ing Erh understood its import, and taking at once the hair, she concealed it in her sleeve, and there and then came over into the room on this side, where she produced the hair, and smirkingly asked Chia Lien, “What’s this?” Chia Lien, at the sight of it, lost no time in making a snatch with the idea of depriving her of it; and when P’ing Erh speedily endeavoured to run away, she was clutched by Chia Lien, who put her down on the stove-couch, and came up to take it from her hand. “You heartless fellow!” P’ing Erh laughingly exclaimed, “I conceal this, with every good purpose, from her knowledge, and come to ask you about it, and you, on the contrary, fly into a rage! But wait till she comes back, and I’ll tell her, and we’ll see what will happen.” At these words, Chia Lien hastily forced a smile. “Dear girl!” he entreated, “give it to me, and I won’t venture again to fly into a passion.”","Early next morning, when Xi-feng had gone off to Grandmother Jia’s, Patience began putting away the clothes and bedding that had been brought in from the outer study. To her surprise she felt something strange in the cover of Jia Lian’s head-rest, and after groping inside it, fished out a black, silky tress of woman’s hair. Quick to understand its significance, she hid it in her sleeve and going across to the other room, showed it to Jia Lian and asked him what it was. As soon as he saw the hair, Jia Lian rushed forward to snatch it from her. She darted away, but he seized hold of her, and forcing her on to the kang, attempted to wrest it from her grasp. ‘Mean thing!’ said Patience. ‘After I’ve gone to the trouble of asking you about it behind her back, you have to start being rough!’ Just at that moment they heard Xi-feng coming. Jia Lian didn’t know whether to let go of Patience or make a final effort to obtain the hair. Finally, with a muttered entreaty, he released her: ‘Angel! Don’t let her know!’ Patience managed to get up just as Xi-feng was entering. ‘Quick!’ said Xi-feng. ‘Open up the chest and find that pattern for Her Ladyship!’ ‘Yes madam,’ said Patience. While Patience was looking for the pattern, Xi-feng caught sight of Jia Lian and suddenly thought of something else. ‘Have we got the things back from the outer study yet?’ ‘Yes,’ said Patience. ‘Was there anything missing?’ ‘No,’ said Patience. ‘I went through them very carefully, but there was nothing missing.’"
案上設著武則天當日鏡室中設的寶鏡，一邊擺著飛燕立著舞過的金盤，盤內盛著安祿山擲過傷了太真乳的木瓜。上面設著壽昌公主於含章殿下臥的榻，懸的是同昌公主製的聯珠帳。寶玉含笑連說：「這裏好！」秦氏笑道：「我這屋子大約神僊也可以住得了。」說著親自展開了西子浣過的紗衾，移了紅娘抱過的鴛枕。於是眾奶母伏侍寶玉臥好，款款散了，只留襲人、媚人、晴雯、麝月四個丫鬟為伴。秦氏便分咐小丫鬟們，好生在廊檐下看著貓兒狗兒打架。,"On the case is the precious mirror that Wu Zetian set up in the mirror room on that day, and on one side is a golden plate with flying swallows standing and dancing. On it is the couch on which Princess Shouchang sleeps under Her Royal Highness Hanzhang, and on it hangs the beaded tent made by Princess Tongchang. Baoyu said with a smile, ""It's good here!"" Qin said with a smile, ""I think my house can be lived in by even gods."" Then he unfolded the quilt that Xizi had washed, and moved the mandarin duck pillow that Hongniang had held. So all the nanny squatted and served Baoyu in bed, and the sections were scattered, leaving only four maids, Xiren, Meiren, Qingwen, and Sheyue, as their companions. Qin Shi then ordered the little maids to watch the cats and dogs fight under the porch.","On the table was a mirror, one which had been placed, in days of yore, in the Mirror Palace of the Emperor Wu Tse-t’ien. On one side stood a gold platter, in which Fei Yen, who lived in the Ch’ao state, used to stand and dance. In this platter, was laid a quince, which An Lu-shan had flung at the Empress T’ai Chen, inflicting a wound on her breast. In the upper part of the room, stood a divan ornamented with gems, on which the Emperor’s daughter, Shou Ch’ang, was wont to sleep, in the Han Chang Palace Hanging, were curtains embroidered with strings of pearls, by T’ung Ch’ang, the Imperial Princess. “It’s nice in here, it’s nice in here,” exclaimed Pao-yue with a chuckle. “This room of mine,” observed Mrs. Ch’in smilingly, “is I think, good enough for even spirits to live in!” and, as she uttered these words, she with her own hands, opened a gauze coverlet, which had been washed by Hsi Shih, and removed a bridal pillow, which had been held in the arms of Hung Niang. Instantly, the nurses attended to Pao-yue, until he had laid down comfortably; when they quietly dispersed, leaving only the four waiting maids: Hsi Jen, Ch’iu Wen, Ch’ing Wen and She Yueh to keep him company. “Mind be careful, as you sit under the eaves,” Mrs. Ch’in recommended the young waiting maids, “that the cats do not start a fight!”","On a table stood an antique mirror that had once graced the tiring-room of the lascivious empress Wu Ze-tian. Beside it stood the golden platter on which Flying Swallow once danced for her emperor’s delight. And on the platter was that very quince which the villainous An Lu-shan threw at beautiful Yang Gui-fei, bruising her plump white breast. At the far end of the room stood the priceless bed on which Princess Shou-yang was sleeping out of doors under the eaves of the Han-zhang Palace when the plum-flower lighted on her forehead and set a new fashion for coloured patches. Over it hung a canopy commissioned by Princess Tong-chang entirely fashioned out of ropes of pearls. ‘I like it here,’ said Bao-yu happily. ‘My room,’ said Qin-shi with a proud smile, ‘is fit for an immortal to sleep in.’ And she unfolded a quilted coverlet, whose silk had been laundered by the fabulous Xi Shi, and arranged the double head-rest that Hong-niang once carried for her amorous mistress. The nurses now helped Bao-yu into bed and then tiptoed out, leaving him attended only by his four young maids: Aroma, Skybright, Musk, and Ripple. Qin-shi told them to go outside and stop the cats from fighting on the eaves."
賈政因見兩邊俱是超手遊廊，便順著遊廊步入。只見上面五間清廈連著卷棚，四面出廊，綠窗油壁，更比前幾處清雅不同。賈政嘆道：「此軒中煮茶操琴，亦不必再焚名香矣。此造已出意外，諸公必有佳作新題以顏其額，方不負此。」眾人笑道：「再莫若『蘭風蕙露』貼切了。」賈政道：「也只好用這四字。其聯若何？」一人道：「我倒想了一對，大家批削改正。」唸道是：「麝蘭芳靄斜陽院，杜若香飄明月洲。」,"Jia Zhengyin saw that both sides were super mobile verandas, so he walked along the veranda. I saw that the five Qing mansions above were connected with rolling sheds, with corridors on all sides, and green windows and oil walls, which were more elegant and different than the previous ones. Jia Zheng sighed, ""There is no need to burn the name incense when making tea and playing the qin in this hall. This construction has been an accident, and the princes will surely have a good work and a new title to look at their foreheads, so that they can live up to this."" The crowd laughed: "" More like 'Lanfenghuilu' is more appropriate."" Jia Zheng said, ""I can only use these four characters. What is the connection?"" Shelan Fang is in the setting sun, and Du Ruoxiang floats over Mingyuezhou.”","Chia Cheng perceiving that on both sides alike were covered passages resembling outstretched arms, forthwith continued his steps and entered the covered way, when he caught sight, at the upper end, of a five-roomed building, without spot or blemish, with folding blinds extending in a connected line, and with corridors on all four sides; (a building) which with its windows so green, and its painted walls, excelled, in spotless elegance, the other buildings they had seen before, to which it presented such a contrast. Chia Cheng heaved a sigh. “If one were able,” he observed, “to boil his tea and thrum his lyre in here, there wouldn’t even be any need for him to burn any more incense. But the execution of this structure is so beyond conception that you must, gentlemen, compose something nice and original to embellish the tablet with, so as not to render such a place of no effect!” “There’s nothing so really pat,” suggested the company smiling; “as ‘the orchid-smell-laden breeze’ and ‘the dew-bedecked epidendrum!” “These are indeed the only four characters,” rejoined Chia Cheng, “that could be suitably used; but what’s to be said as far as the scroll goes?” “I’ve thought of a couplet,” interposed one of the party, “which you’ll all have to criticise, and put into ship-shape; its burden is this: “The musk-like epidendrum smell enshrouds the court, where shines the sun with oblique beams; The iris fragrance is wafted over the isle illumined by the moon’s clear rays.”","Observing that there were balustraded loggias on either side of the court, Jia Zheng led his party through one of them towards the building at the rear. It was a cool, five-frame gallery with a low, roofed verandah running round it on all sides. The window-lattices were green and the walls freshly painted. It was a building of quite another order of elegance from the ones they had so far visited. ‘Anyone who sat sipping tea and playing the qin to himself on this verandah would have no need to burn incense if he wanted sweet smells for his inspiration,’ said Jia Zheng dreamily.’ So unexpectedly beautiful a place calls for a specially beautiful name to adorn it.’ ‘What could be better than “Dewy Orchids”?’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Yes,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘That would do for the name. Now what about the couplet?’ ‘I have thought of a couplet,’ said one of the gentlemen. ‘ Tell me all of you what you think of it: A musky perfume of orchids hangs in the sunset courtyard. A sweet aroma of galingale floats over the moonlit island.’"
誰想賈母自見寶釵來了，喜他穩重和平，正值他纔過第一個生辰，便自己蠲資二十兩，喚了鳳姐來，交與他置酒戲。鳳姐湊趣笑道：「一個老祖宗給孩子們作生日，不拘怎樣，誰還敢爭，又辦什麼酒戲。既高興要熱鬧，就說不得自己花上幾兩。巴巴的找出這霉爛的二十兩銀子來作東道，這意思還叫我賠上。果然拿不出來也罷了，金的、銀的、圓的、扁的，壓塌了箱子底，衹是勒掯我們。舉眼看看，誰不是兒女？難道將來衹有寶兄弟頂了你老人家上五臺山不成？那些梯己只留於他，我們如今雖不配使，也別苦了我們。這個夠酒的？夠戲的？」說的滿屋裏都笑起來。賈母亦笑道：「你們聽聽這嘴！我也算會說的，怎麼說不過這猴兒。你婆婆也不敢強嘴，你和我 的。」鳳姐笑道：「我婆婆也是一樣的疼寶玉，我也沒處去訴冤，倒說我強嘴。」說著，又引著賈母笑了一回，賈母十分喜悅。,"Who would have thought that when Mother Jia saw Baochai coming, she liked that he was stable and peaceful. It was just when he had just passed his first birthday, so she made twenty taels of money, called Sister Feng, and gave him a wine scene. Sister Feng jokingly said: ""An old ancestor gave children birthdays, no matter what, who dares to fight, and what kind of wine show is held. If you are happy and want to be lively, you can't say how much money you spend on yourself. Baba find this moldy Twenty taels of silver came to be the host, which meant that I would pay for it. Sure enough, I couldn't get it out. The gold, silver, round, and flat ones crushed the bottom of the box, and only slapped us. Look up and see. Look, who is not a child? Could it be that in the future only Brother Bao will push your old man up to Mount Wutai? Those Tiji will only be left to him. Even though we are not worthy to serve now, don’t make us suffer. This is enough wine? Is it enough for drama?” said The whole room laughed. Mother Jia also smiled and said, ""Listen to this mouth! I can say it, but I can't say anything like this monkey. Your mother-in-law doesn't dare to force her mouth, you and me."" Sister Feng smiled and said, ""My mother-in-law is the same. It hurts Baoyu, and I have nowhere to complain, but I say that I am strong."" After speaking, she made Jia Mu smiled again, and Jia Mu was very happy.","Contrary to all expectations old lady Chia had, since the arrival of Pao-ch’ai, taken quite a fancy to her, for her sedateness and good nature, and as this happened to be the first birthday which she was about to celebrate (in the family) she herself readily contributed twenty taels which, after sending for lady Feng, she handed over to her, to make arrangements for a banquet and performance. “A venerable senior like yourself,” lady Feng thereupon smiled and ventured, with a view to enhancing her good cheer, “is at liberty to celebrate the birthday of a child in any way agreeable to you, without any one presuming to raise any objection; but what’s the use again of giving a banquet? But since it be your good pleasure and your purpose to have it celebrated with eclat, you could, needless to say, your own self have spent several taels from the private funds in that old treasury of yours! But you now produce those twenty taels, spoiled by damp and mould, to play the hostess with, with the view indeed of compelling us to supply what’s wanted! But hadn’t you really been able to contribute any more, no one would have a word to say; but the gold and silver, round as well as flat, have with their heavy weight pressed down the bottom of the box! and your sole object is to harass us and to extort from us. But raise your eyes and look about you; who isn’t your venerable ladyship’s son and daughter? and is it likely, pray, that in the future there will only be cousin Pao-yue to carry you, our old lady, on his head, up the Wu T’ai Shan? You may keep all these things for him alone! but though we mayn’t at present, deserve that anything should be spent upon us, you shouldn’t go so far as to place us in any perplexities (by compelling us to subscribe). And is this now enough for wines, and enough for the theatricals?” As she bandied these words, every one in the whole room burst out laughing, and even dowager lady Chia broke out in laughter while she observed: “Do you listen to that mouth? I myself am looked upon as having the gift of the gab, but why is it that I can’t talk in such a wise as to put down this monkey? Your mother-in-law herself doesn’t dare to be so overbearing in her speech; and here you are jabber, jabber with me!” “My mother-in-law,” explained lady Feng, “is also as fond of Pao-yue as you are, so much so that I haven’t anywhere I could go and give vent to my grievances; and instead of (showing me some regard) you say that I’m overbearing in my speech!” With these words, she again enticed dowager lady Chia to laugh for a while.","Ever since Bao-chai’s first arrival, Grandmother Jia had been pleasurably impressed by her placid and dependable disposition, and now that she was about to spend her first ‘big’ birthday in the Jia household, the old lady resolved to make it a memorable one. Taking twenty taels of silver from her private store, she summoned Xi-feng and directed her to spend it on providing wine and plays for a celebration. Xi-feng made this the occasion for a little raillery. ‘If the old lady says she wants her grandchild’s birthday celebrated,’ she said, ‘then celebrated it must be, and we must all jump to it without arguing! But if she’s going to start asking for plays as well, all I can say to that is that if she’s in the mood for a bit of fun, I’m afraid she’s going to have to pay for it. She’s going to have to cough up something out of those private savings of hers she’s been hoarding all these years -not wait until the last minute and then fish out a measly little twenty taels to pay for the party: that’s just another way of telling us we’ve got to pay for it ourselves. I mean, if you were really hard up, it would be another matter: but you’ve got boxes and boxes of boodle – the bottoms are dropping out of them, they’re so full! It’s pure meanness, that’s what it is! You forget, Grannie, when you go to heaven young Bao-yu won’t be the only one who’ll walk ahead of the hearse. You’ve got other grandchildren too, don’t forget! You don’t have to leave everything to him. The rest of us may not be much use, but you mustn’t be too hard on us. Twenty taels! Do you really think that ’s enough to pay for a party and plays?’ At this point the entire company burst into laughter, which Grandmother Jia joined in herself. ‘Just listen to her!’ she said. ‘I thought I had a fairly sharp tongue, but I’m no match for this one: “Clack-clack, clack-clack” – it’s worse than a pair of wooden clappers 1 Even your mother-in-law dare n’t argue with me, my dear! Don’t pick on me!’ ‘Mother-in-law is just as soppy about Bao-yu as you are,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I’ve got no one to tell my troubles to. And you say I’m sharp-tongued!’ Xi-feng’s mock-lugubriousness set the old lady off in another squall of laughter."
薛蟠笑道：「你提畫兒，我纔想起來。昨兒我看人家一張春宮，畫的著實好。上面還有許多的字，也沒細看，只看落的款，是『庚黃』畫的。真真的好的了不得！」寶玉聽說，心下猜疑道：「古今字畫也都見過些，那裏有個『庚黃』？」想了半天，不覺笑將起來，命人取過筆來，在手心裏寫了兩個字，又問薛蟠道：「你看真了是『庚黃』？」薛蟠道：「怎麼看不真！」寶玉將手一撒，與他看道：「別是這兩字罷？其實與『庚黃』相去不遠。」眾人都看時，原來是「唐寅」兩個字，都笑道：「想必是這兩字，大爺一時眼花了也未可知。」薛蟠只覺沒意思，笑道：「誰知他『糖銀』『菓銀』的。」,"Xue Pan said with a smile: ""You mentioned the painting, and I remembered it. Yesterday I saw someone's erotic palace, and the painting was really good. There are still many characters on it, and I didn't read it carefully. It was painted by Geng Huang. It's really, really good!"" Baoyu heard that, and she wondered, ""I have seen some ancient and modern calligraphy and painting, where is there a 'Geng Huang'?"" He got up, ordered someone to take a pen, wrote two words in the palm of his hand, and asked Xue Pan, ""Do you really think it's 'Geng Huang'?"" Xue Pan said, ""Why don't you think it's true!"" Yisa looked at him and said, ""Don't say these two words? Actually, it's not far from 'Genghuang'."" When everyone looked at it, it turned out to be the word ""Tang Yin"", and they all laughed and said, ""It must be these two. Words, the uncle was blinded for a while and didn’t know it.” Xue Pan only felt bored and smiled: “Who knew he was ‘sugar silver’ and ‘fruit silver’.”","“Your reference to pictures,” added Hsueeh P’an smiling, “reminds me of a book I saw yesterday, containing immodest drawings; they were, truly, beautifully done. On the front page there figured also a whole lot of characters. But I didn’t carefully look at them; I simply noticed the name of the person, who had executed them. It was, in fact, something or other like Keng Huang. The pictures were, actually, exceedingly good!” This allusion made Pao-yue exercise his mind with innumerable conjectures. “Of pictures drawn from past years to the present, I have,” he said, “seen a good many, but I’ve never come across any Keng Huang.” After considerable thought, he could not repress himself from bursting out laughing. Then asking a servant to fetch him a pencil, he wrote a couple of words on the palm of his hand. This done, he went on to inquire of Hsueeh. P’an: “Did you see correctly that it read Keng Huang?” “How could I not have seen correctly?” ejaculated Hsueeh P’an. Pao-yue thereupon unclenched his hand and allowed him to peruse, what was written in it. “Were they possibly these two characters?” he remarked. “These are, in point of fact, not very dissimilar from what Keng Huang look like?” On scrutinising them, the company noticed the two words T’ang Yin, and they all laughed. “They must, we fancy, have been these two characters!” they cried. “Your eyes, Sir, may, there’s no saying, have suddenly grown dim!”","oTalking of pictures,’ said Xue Pan genially, ‘that’s reminded me. I saw a set of dirty pictures in someone’s house the other day. They were real beauties. There was a lot of writing on top that I didn’t pay much attention to, but I did notice the signature. I think it was “Geng Huang”, the man who painted them. They were really good!’ Bao-yu was puzzled. His knowledge of the masters of painting and calligraphy both past and present was not inconsiderable, but he had never in all his experience come across a ‘Geng Huang’. After racking his brains for some moments he suddenly began to chuckle and called for a writing-brush. A writing-brush having been produced by one of the servants, he wrote two characters with it in the palm of his hand. ‘Are you quite sure the signature you saw was “Geng Huang”?’ he asked Xue Pan. ‘What do you mean?’ said Xue Pan. ‘Of course I’m sure.’ Bao-yu opened his hand and held it up for Xue Pan to see: ‘You sure it wasn’t these two characters? They are quite similar.’ The others crowded round to look. They all laughed when they saw what he had written: ‘Yes, it must have been “Tang Yin”. Mr Xue couldn’t have been seeing straight that day. Ha!"
薛蟠已拜見過賈政，賈璉又引著拜見了賈赦、賈珍等。賈政便使人上來對王夫人說：「姨太太已有了春秋，外甥年輕不知世路，在外住著恐有人生事。咱們東北角上梨香院一所十來間房，白空閑著，打掃了，請姨太太和姐兒哥兒住了甚好。」王夫人未及留，賈母也就遣人來說「請姨太太就在這裏住下，大家親密些」等語。薛姨媽正要同居一處，方可拘緊些兒子；若另住在外，又恐他縱性惹禍，遂忙道謝應允。又私與王夫人說明：「一應日費供給一概免卻，方是處常之法。」王夫人知他家不難於此，遂亦從其願。從此後薛家母子就在梨香院住了。,"Xue Pan had already met Jia Zheng, and Jia Lian led him to visit Jia She, Jia Zhen, etc. Jia Zheng sent someone up and said to Mrs. Wang, ""My concubine is already in the spring and autumn, and my nephew is young and doesn't know the way of life. I am afraid that there will be trouble in living outside. We have a dozen or so rooms in Shanglixiangyuan in the northeast corner. Now, it would be great to have my concubine and my sister and brother stay here."" Before Madam Wang could stay, Mother Jia sent someone to say, ""Please stay here with my concubine, and let's be more intimate."" Aunt Xue was about to live together, so she could restrain her sons; if she lived elsewhere, she was afraid that he would cause trouble, so she hurriedly thanked her and agreed. He also explained to Mrs. Wang privately, ""All the daily allowances are waived. This is the only way to live a long life."" Mrs. Wang knew that it was not difficult for his family, so she followed her wish. Since then, the mother and son of the Xue family have lived in Lixiangyuan.","Hsueeh P’an, having paid his respects to Chia Cheng and Chia Lien, was likewise taken to see Chia She, Chia Chen and the other members. Chia Cheng sent a messenger to tell madame Wang that “‘aunt’ Hsueeh had already seen many springs and autumns, while their nephew was of tender age, with no experience, so that there was every fear, were he to live outside, that something would again take place. In the South-east corner of our compound,” (he sent word,) “there are in the Pear Fragrance Court, over ten apartments, all of which are vacant and lying idle; and were we to tell the servants to sweep them, and invite ‘aunt’ Hsueeh and the young gentleman and lady to take up their quarters there, it would be an extremely wise thing.” Madame Wang had in fact been entertaining the wish to keep them to live with them, when dowager lady Chia also sent some one to say that, “Mrs. Hsueeh should be asked to put up in the mansion in order that a greater friendliness should exist between them all.” Mrs. Hsueeh herself had all along been desirous to live in one place with her relatives, so as to be able to keep a certain check over her son, fearing that, if they lived in a separate house outside, the natural bent of his habits would run riot, and that some calamity would be brought on; and she therefore, there and then, expressed her sense of appreciation, and accepted the invitation. She further privately told madame Wang in clear terms, that every kind of daily expense and general contribution would have to be entirely avoided and withdrawn as that would be the only thing to justify her to make any protracted stay. And madame Wang aware that she had, in her home, no difficulty in this line, promptly in fact complied with her wishes. From this date it was that “aunt” Hsueeh and her children took up their quarters in the Pear Fragrance Court.","Xue Pan, meanwhile, had paid his respects to Jia Zheng and Jia Lian and been taken to see Jia She and Cousin Zhen. Jia Zheng now sent a servant round to Lady Wang with the following message: ‘Your sister is getting on in years and our nephew is very young and seems rather inexperienced and, I fear, quite capable of getting into a scrape again if they are going to live outside. Pear Tree Court in the north-east corner of our property is lying completely unoccupied at the moment and has quite a sizeable amount of room in it. Why not invite your sister and her children to move in there?’ Lady Wang had wanted all along to ask her sister to stay. Grandmother Jia had sent someone round to tell her that she should ‘ask Mrs Xue to stay with us here, so that we can all be close to one another.’ And Aunt Xue for her own part had been wanting to stay so that some sort of check could be kept on her son. She was sure that if they were to be on their own somewhere else in the city his unbridled nature would precipitate some fresh calamity. She therefore accepted the invitation with alacrity, privately adding the proviso that she could only contemplate a long stay if it was on the understanding that they were themselves to be responsible for all their expenses. Lady Wang knew that money was no problem to them, so she readily consented, and Aunt Xue and her children proceeded there and then to move into Pear Tree Court."
黛玉因看見寶玉左邊腮上有鈕扣大小的一塊血漬，便欠身湊近前來，以手撫之細看，又道：「這又是誰的指甲刮破了？」寶玉側身，一面躲，一面笑道：「不是刮的，只怕是纔剛替他們淘漉胭脂膏子， 上了一點兒。」說著，便找手帕子要揩拭。黛玉便用自己的帕子替他揩拭了，口內說道：「你又幹這些事了。幹也罷了，必定還要帶出幌子來。便是舅舅看不見，別人看見了，又當奇事新鮮話兒去學舌討好兒，吹到舅舅耳朵裏，又該大家不乾淨惹氣。」,"Daiyu saw a button-sized piece of blood on Baoyu's left cheek, so she leaned forward, stroked her hand to take a closer look, and said, ""Whose fingernail is this scratched?"" Baoyu turned sideways, hiding, He smiled and said, ""It's not shaved, I'm afraid I just washed the rouge paste for them, and put a little on it."" After saying that, he found a handkerchief to wipe it off. Daiyu wiped his handkerchief for him, and said in her mouth, ""You have done these things again. No matter what you do, you must still bring out a pretense. Even if my uncle can't see it, others see it, and it's a miracle. If you learn new words to please your uncle and blow it into your uncle’s ears, everyone should be unclean and irritated.”","But Tai-yue, upon turning up her eyes and looking, espied on Pao-yue’s cheek on the left side of his face, a spot of blood about the size of a button, and speedily bending her body, she drew near to him, and rubbing it with her hand, she scrutinised it closely. “Whose nail,” she went on to inquire, “has scratched this open?” Pao-yue with his body still reclining withdrew from her reach, and as he did so, he answered with a smile: “It isn’t a scratch; it must, I presume, be simply a drop, which bespattered my cheek when I was just now mixing and clarifying the cosmetic paste for them.” Saying this, he tried to get at his handkerchief to wipe it off; but Tai-yue used her own and rubbed it clean for him, while she observed: “Do you still give your mind to such things? attend to them you may; but must you carry about you a placard (to make it public)? Though uncle mayn’t see it, were others to notice it, they would treat it as a strange occurrence and a novel bit of news, and go and tell him to curry favour, and when it has reached uncle’s ear , we shall all again not come out clean, and provoke him to anger.”","Glancing up from her recumbent position, Dai-yu noticed that there was a blood-spot about the size of a small button on Bao-yu’s left cheek. She bent over him to examine it more closely and touched it lightly with her finger. ‘Whose nails was it this time?’ Bao-yu lay back to avoid her scrutiny and laughed. ‘It isn’t a scratch. I’ve just been helping them make rouge. A little of it must have splashed on to my face.’ He rummaged for a handkerchief to wipe it off with. Dai-yu wiped it off with her own, clicking her tongue censoriously as she did so. ‘So you’re up to those tricks again? You might at least refrain from advertising the fact! Even if Uncle doesn’t see you himself, someone else might who thought it an amusing story to go around gossiping about. He could easily get to hear about it in that way, and that would make it unpleasant for all of us.’"
那丫頭聽說，方知是本家的爺們，便不似先前那等回避，下死眼把賈蕓釘了兩眼。聽那賈蕓說道：「什麼是廊上廊下的，你只說是蕓兒就是了。」半晌，那丫頭冷笑了一笑：「依我說，二爺竟請回家去，有什麼話明兒再來。今兒晚上得空兒我回了我們爺。」焙茗道：「這是怎麼說？」那丫頭道：「他今兒也沒睡中覺，自然喫的晚飯早。晚上他又不下來。難道衹是要的二爺在這裏等著挨餓不成！不如家去，明兒來是正經。就便是回來，有人帶信，那都是不中用的，他不過口裏答應著，他那麼大工夫給你帶信兒去呢！」賈蕓聽這丫頭說話簡便俏麗，待要問他的名字，因是寶玉房裏的，又不便問，只得說道：「這話倒是，我明兒再來。」說著便往外走。焙茗道：「我倒茶去，二爺喫了茶再去。」賈蕓一面走，一面回頭說：「不喫茶，我還有事呢。」口裏說話，眼睛瞧那丫頭還站在那裏呢。,"The girl heard that Fang Zhi was the man of the family, so instead of avoiding it like before, she nailed Jia Yun twice. Hearing that Jia Yun said, ""What is on the porch, you just say it's Yun'er."" After a while, the girl sneered: ""According to me, the second master actually invited you home, what do you have to say tomorrow? Come again. I’ll go back to my grandfather tonight when I’m free.” Bei Ming said, “How do you say that?” The girl said, “He didn’t fall asleep today, so he naturally ate dinner early. Come down. Don't you just want the second master to wait here and starve! Why don't you go home, come tomorrow is serious. Even if you come back, someone will bring a letter, it will be useless, he just promised, He took so much time to bring you a letter!"" Jia Yun heard the girl's simple and pretty words, and she was about to ask his name, because it was in Baoyu's room, and it was inconvenient to ask, so she said, ""That's true, I know what to say. Come again."" He said and walked out. Baiming said: ""I'll pour the tea, and the second master will go after the tea."" As Jia Yun walked away, she turned around and said, ""I don't have tea, I still have something to do."" As she spoke, she saw that the girl was still standing there.","Secundus, who lives under the portico, has come!” The servant-maid, upon hearing these words, knew at once that he was a young gentleman belonging to the family in which she served, and she did not skulk out of sight, as she had done in the first instance; but with a gaze sufficient to kill, she fixed her two eyes upon Chia Yuen, when she heard Chia Yuen interpose: “What about over the portico and under the portico; you just tell him that Yuen Erh is come, that’s all.” After a while this girl gave a sarcastic smile. “My idea is,” she ventured, “that you, master Secundus, should really, if it so please you, go back, and come again tomorrow; and to-night, if I find time, I’ll just put in a word with him!” “What’s this that you’re driving at?” Pei Ming then shouted. And the maid rejoined: “He’s not even had a siesta to-day, so that he’ll have his dinner at an early hour, and won’t come down again in the evening; and is it likely that you would have master Secundus wait here and suffer hunger? and isn’t it better than he should return home? The right thing is that he should come to-morrow; for were even by and by some one to turn up, who could take a message, that person would simply acquiesce with the lips, but would he be willing to deliver the message in for you?” Chia Yuen, upon finding how concise and yet how well expressed this girl’s remarks had been, was bent upon inquiring what her name was; but as she was a maid employed in Pao-yue’s apartments, he did not therefore feel justified in asking the question, and he had no other course but to add, “What you say is quite right, I’ll come to-morrow!” and as he spoke, he there and then was making his way outside, when Pei Ming remarked: “I’ll go and pour a cup of tea; and master Secundus, have your tea and then go.” Chia Yuen turned his head round, as he kept on his way, and said by way of rejoinder: “I won’t have any tea; for I’ve besides something more to attend to!” and while with his lips he uttered these words, he, with his eyes, stared at the servant-girl, who was still standing in there.","Tell him that Mr Jia from West Lane is here.’ On learning that the visitor was a member of the clan, the maid became less concerned about concealment and engaged the limpid eyes in bolder scrutiny of his features. The object of her scrutiny now addressed her: ‘Don’t bother about the “West Lane” stuff! Just say that “Yun” has called!’ The girl reflected for some moments, then, with a half-smile, she said: ‘If I were you, Mr Jia, I’d go home now and come again tomorrow. I’ll try to get a message through to him this evening if I get the chance.’ ‘What’s the idea?’ said Tealeaf. ‘He didn’t have his nap today,’ said the maid. ‘ That means he’ll be having dinner early. Then suppose he doesn’t go out after dinner: are you going to let Mr Jia wait here all day without eating? It would be much better if he went home now and came again tomorrow. Even if I succeed in getting word through to him as soon as I get back, he’ll probably only send an answer to the message. I don’t expect he’ll actually come over.’ Her words were sensible and to the point and were spoken in the same thrilling tone that had first attracted him. Jia Yun would have liked to ask her name, but etiquette forbade that he should do so now that he knew she was one of Bao-yu’s maids. He just said: ‘I’m sure you’re right. I’ll come again tomorrow, then.’ He turned to go. ‘I’ll get some tea for you, Mr Jia,’ said Tealeaf. ‘ Have a cup of tea before you go.’ ‘No thanks,’ said Jia Yun, looking back over his shoulder but continuing to go. ‘I’ve got other business.’ The words were for Tealeaf, but the look which accompanied them was directed at the soft-voiced maid, who was still standing there."
第十一回,eleventh time,CHAPTER XI.,Chapter 11
這日夜間，正和平兒燈下擁爐倦繡，早命濃薰繡被，二人睡下，屈指算行程該到何處，不知不覺已交三鼓。平兒已睡熟了。鳳姐方覺星眼微朦，恍惚只見秦氏從外走來，含笑說道：「嬸子好睡！我今日回去，你也不送我一程。因娘兒們素日相好，我捨不得嬸子，故來別你一別。還有一件心願未了，非告訴嬸子，別人未必中用。」,"On this night, Zheng Hepinger was tired of embroidering under the lamp, and he had a thick smoke embroidery quilt. Ping'er has fallen asleep. Sister Feng Fang Juexing's eyes were slightly hazy, and she saw Qin shi coming from outside, and said with a smile, ""Auntie sleeps well! I'm going back today, and you won't give me a ride. Because the girls are always good friends, I can't bear my auntie, so I come to say goodbye to you. No. There is one more wish I have yet to make. If I tell my aunt, it may not be useful to others.”","In the course of the night of this day, she had been sitting with P’ing Erh by lamp-light clasping the hand-stove; and weary of doing her work of embroidery, she had at an early hour, given orders to warm the embroidered quilt, and both had gone to bed; and as she was bending her fingers, counting the progress of the journey, and when they should be arriving, unexpectedly, the third watch struck. P’ing Erh had already fallen fast asleep; and lady Feng was feeling at length her sleepy eyes slightly dose, when she faintly discerned Mrs. Ch’in walk in from outside. “My dear sister-in-law,” she said as she smiled, “sleep in peace; I’m on my way back to-day, and won’t even you accompany me just one stage? But as you and I have been great friends all along, I cannot part from you, sister-in-law, and have therefore come to take my leave of you. There is, besides, a wish of mine, which isn’t yet accomplished; and if I don’t impart it to you, it isn’t likely that telling any one else will be of any use.”","On the occasion of which we write she had sat beside the lamp with Patience until late into the evening; then, the bedding having been well warmed, the two women had gone to bed, where they lay until after midnight discussing the stages of Jia Lian’s journey and attempting to calculate what point he was likely to have reached in it. By this time Patience was fast asleep and Xi-feng herself was on the point of dropping off when she became dimly aware that Qin-shi had just walked into the room from outside. ‘So fond of sleep, Auntie?’ said Qin-shi with a gentle smile. ‘I shall have to begin my journey today without you to see me off. But never mind! Since you cannot come to me, I have come to you instead. We two have always been so close, I could not have borne to leave you without saying good-bye. Besides, I have a last wish that you alone must hear, because I cannot trust anyone else with it.’"
寶玉見沒丫頭們，只得自己下來，拿了碗向茶壺去倒茶。只聽背後說道：「二爺仔細燙了手，讓我們來倒。」一面說，一面走上來，早接了碗過去。寶玉倒唬了一跳，問：「你在那裏的？忽然來了，唬我一跳。」那丫頭一面遞茶，一面回說：「我在後院子裏，纔從裏間的後門進來，難道二爺就沒聽見腳步響？」寶玉一面喫茶，一面仔細打量那丫頭：穿著幾件半新不舊的衣裳，倒是一頭黑鬒鬒的頭髮，挽著個 ，容長臉面，細巧身材，卻十分俏麗乾淨。,"Seeing that there were no girls, Baoyu had to get down by himself, took a bowl and poured tea into the teapot. He heard the words behind him: ""Second Master carefully burned his hands, let us pour it."" As he said that, he walked up and took the bowl early. Baoyu jumped in surprise and asked, ""Where are you? You came here suddenly and scare me."" The girl handed tea and replied, ""I was in the back yard, so I came in through the back door in the middle. Didn't the second master hear the footsteps?"" Baoyu looked at the girl carefully while eating tea: she was wearing a few half-new clothes, but had black hair that was pulled up, with a long face and a slender figure, but Very pretty and clean.","as Pao-yue perceived that there were no waiting-maids at hand, he had to come down and take a cup and go up to the teapot to pour the tea; when he heard some one from behind him observe: “Master Secundus, beware, you’ll scorch your hand; wait until I come to pour it!” And as she spoke, she walked up to him, and took the cup from his grasp, to the intense surprise, in fact, of Pao-yue, who inquired: “Where were you that you have suddenly come to give me a start?” The waiting-maid smiled as she handed him the tea. “I was in the back court,” she replied, “and just came in from the back door of the inner rooms; and is it likely that you didn’t, sir, hear the sound of my footsteps?” Pao-yue drank his tea, and as he simultaneously passed the servant-girl under a minute inspection, he found that though she wore several articles of clothing the worse for wear, she was, nevertheless, with that head of beautiful hair, as black as the plumage of a raven, done up in curls, her face so oblong,","Since there were no maids, Bao-yu saw that he would have to serve himself. He found himself a cup and was about to take up the pot to pour himself some tea when a voice started speaking right behind him: ‘Let me, Master Bao! You might scald yourself.’ Bao-yu jumped. The owner of the voice hurriedly relieved him of the cup. ‘Where have you been all this time?’ he said. ‘You gave me quite a start, coming up suddenly like that!’ She handed him his tea with a smile: ‘I was in the back courtyard. I came in through the courtyard door at the back. Didn’t you hear me coming?’ Bao-yu sipped his tea and observed her carefully. Her dress, though not shabby, was far from new. By contrast she had a magnificent head of raven-black hair which was done up in a simple bun. The face was rather long and thin; the build slender; the overall impression that of a tidy, clean, graceful person."
劉姥姥道：「這倒不然。謀事在人，成事在天。咱們謀到了，看菩薩的保佑，有些機會，也未可知。我倒替你們想出一個機會來。當日你們原是和金陵王家連過宗的，二十年前，他們看承你們還好；如今自然是你們拉硬屎，不肯去親近他，故疏遠起來。想當初我和女兒還去過一遭。他們家的二小姐着實響快，會待人，倒不拿大。如今現是榮國府賈二老爺的夫人。聽得說，如今上了年紀，越發憐貧恤老，最愛齋僧敬道，捨米捨錢的。如今王府雖昇了邊任，只怕這二姑太太還認得咱們。你何不去走動走動，或者他念舊，有些好處，也未可知。要是他發一點好心，拔一根寒毛比咱們的腰還粗呢。」劉氏一旁接口道：「你老雖說的是，但只你我這樣個嘴臉，怎麼好到他門上去的。先不先，他們那些門上的人也未必肯去通信。沒的去打嘴現世。」,"Grandma Liu said, ""That's not the case. It's up to people to make things happen, and it's up to God to make things happen. We've managed to get it, and depending on the blessing of the Bodhisattva, there are some opportunities that we don't know yet. I'll come up with an opportunity for you. You were with the King of Jinling. For those who have been with him, 20 years ago, they saw that you were okay; now, of course, you are the one who did the hard work and refused to get close to him, so they became estranged. I think my daughter and I have been there once. The young lady is really loud, and she treats people well, but she doesn't take it seriously. Now she is the wife of Mr. Jia Er of the Rongguo House. It can be said that now that I am getting older, I am more sympathetic to the poor and caring for the elderly. Now, although the palace has been promoted to the side, I am afraid that this second aunt still recognizes us. Why don't you go for a walk, or if he is nostalgic, there are some benefits, I don't know. If he is a little kind, plucking a cold hair will be more than our waist. It's still rough."" Liu shi said, ""Although what you are saying is true, how can you get to his door with a face like you and me. Before or after, those people at their door may not be willing to communicate. No need to talk about the world.”","“That, too, doesn’t follow,” remarked goody Liu; “the planning of affairs rests with man, but the accomplishment of them rests with Heaven. After we have laid our plans, we may, who can say, by relying on the sustenance of the gods, find some favourable occasion. Leave it to me, I’ll try and devise some lucky chance for you people! In years gone by, you joined ancestors with the Wang family of Chin Ling, and twenty years back, they treated you with consideration; but of late, you’ve been so high and mighty, and not condescended to go and bow to them, that an estrangement has arisen. I remember how in years gone by, I and my daughter paid them a visit. The second daughter of the family was really so pleasant and knew so well how to treat people with kindness, and without in fact any high airs! She’s at present the wife of Mr. Chia, the second son of the Jung Kuo mansion; and I hear people say that now that she’s advanced in years, she’s still more considerate to the poor, regardful of the old, and very fond of preparing vegetable food for the bonzes and performing charitable deeds. The head of the Wang mansion has, it is true, been raised to some office on the frontier, but I hope that this lady Secunda will anyhow notice us. How is it then that you don’t find your way as far as there; for she may possibly remember old times, and some good may, no one can say, come of it? I only wish that she would display some of her kind-heartedness, and pluck one hair from her person which would be, yea thicker than our waist.” “What you suggest, mother, is quite correct,” interposed Mrs. Liu, Kou Erh’s wife, who stood by and took up the conversation, “but with such mouth and phiz as yours and mine, how could we present ourselves before her door? Why I fear that the man at her gate won’t also like to go and announce us! and we’d better not go and have our mouths slapped in public!”","‘I wouldn’t say that,’ said Grannie Liu. ‘Man proposes, God disposes. It’s up to us to think of something. We must leave it to the good Lord to decide whether He’ll help us or not. Who knows, He might give us the opportunity we are looking for. ‘Now I can think of a chance you might try. Your family used to be connected with the Wang clan of Nanking. Twenty years ago the Nanking Wangs used to be very good to you folk. It’s only because of late years you have been too stiff-necked to approach them that they have become more distant with you. ‘I can remember going to their house once with my daughter. The elder Miss Wang was a very straightforward young lady, very easy to get on with, and not at all high and mighty. She’s now the wife of the younger of the two Sir Jias in the Rong mansion. They say that now she’s getting on in years she’s grown even more charitable and given to good works than she was as a girl. Her brother has been promoted; but I shouldn’t be surprised if she at least didn’t still remember us. Why don’t you try your luck with her? You never know, she might do something for you for the sake of old times. She only has to feel well disposed and a hair off her arm would be thicker than a man’s waist to poor folks like us!’ ‘That’s all very well, Mother,’ put in Gou-er’s wife, ‘but just take a look at us! What sort of state are we in to go calling on great folks like them ? I doubt the people at the door would bother to tell them we were there. Who’s going to all that trouble just to make a fool of themselves?’"
鳳姐即命彩明訂造簿冊。即時傳來昇媳婦，兼要家口花名冊來查看，又限於明日一早傳齊家人媳婦進來聽差等語。大概點了一點數目單冊，問了來昇媳婦幾句話，便坐車回家。一宿無話。,"Sister Feng ordered Cai Ming to make a book. Immediately came the news that the daughter-in-law was promoted, and also asked for the family roster to check, and it was limited to the morning of tomorrow morning that the family's daughter-in-law came in and listened to the messenger. I probably ordered a few books, asked Laisheng's wife a few words, and then drove home. A night without words.","Lady Feng issued prompt directions to Ts’ai Ming to prepare a register; and sending, there and then, for Lai Sheng’s wife, she asked her to submit, for her perusal, the roll with the servants’ names. She furthermore fixed upon an early hour of the following day to convene the domestics and their wives in the mansion, in order that they should receive their orders; but, after cursorily glancing over the number of entries in the list, and making a few inquiries of Lai Sheng’s wife, she soon got into her curricle, and went home. On the next day, at six and two quarters, she speedily came over.","Xi-feng at once ordered Sunshine to make them up into stout workbooks for use in the office. At the same time she sent for Lai Sheng’s wife and asked her for the register of the household staff. She also told her to get in touch with all the married females on the staff and arrange for them to assemble first thing next morning to be told their new duties. Then, after roughly checking through the numbers in the ‘establishment’ sheet and questioning Lai Sheng’s wife on a few points, she got into her carriage and drove back home. At half past six next morning she was back at the Ning-guo mansion."
這裏雨村且翻弄書籍解悶。忽聽得窗外有女子嗽聲，雨村遂起身往窗外一看，原來是一個丫鬟，在那裏擷花，生得儀容不俗，眉目清明，雖無十分姿色，卻亦有動人之處。雨村不覺看的呆了。那甄家丫鬟擷了花，方欲走時，猛抬頭見窗內有人，敝巾舊服，雖是貧窘，然生得腰圓背厚，面闊口方，更兼劍眉星眼，直鼻方腮。這丫鬟忙轉身回避，心下乃想：「這人生的這樣雄壯，卻又這樣雄壯，想他定是我家主人常說的什麼賈雨村了，每有意幫助周濟，衹是沒甚機會。我家並無這樣貧窘親友，想定是此人無疑了。怪道又說他必非久困之人。」如此想來，不免又回頭兩次。雨村見他回了頭，便自為這女子心中有意於他，更狂喜不盡，自為此女子必是個巨眼英雄，風塵中之知己也。一時小童進來，雨村打聽得前面留飯，不可久待，遂從夾道中自便出門去了。士隱待客既散，知雨村自便，也不去再邀。,"Here Amamura and rummaging through books to relieve boredom. Suddenly I heard a woman coughing outside the window, and Yucun got up and looked out the window. It turned out to be a maid who was picking flowers there. Amamura was stunned. The maid of the Zhen family picked up the flowers, and when she was about to leave, she suddenly raised her head to see someone in the window, wearing a towel and old clothes. Although she was poor, she was born with a round waist and a thick back, a broad face, a square mouth, and a straight nose. Square cheeks. The maid hurriedly turned and avoided, thinking in her heart, ""This life is so majestic, yet so majestic, I think he must be what my master often said about Jia Yucun. Every time he wants to help Zhou Ji, he just doesn't have much chance. Without such poor relatives and friends, I think it must be this person. Wei Dao also said that he must not be a person who has been in poverty for a long time."" Thinking of this, he couldn't help but turn around twice. When Amamura saw him turning his head, he thought that this woman was interested in him, and he was even more ecstatic. Because of this, the woman must be a giant-eyed hero and a confidant in the dust. When Xiaotong came in, Yucun inquired about leaving food in front of him and could not wait for a long time, so he went out on his own from the sidewalk. Since Shiyin’s hospitality was gone, Zhiyu Village did not go to invite him again.","During his absence, Yue-ts’un occupied himself in turning over the pages of some poetical work to dispel ennui, when suddenly he heard, outside the window, a woman’s cough. Yue-ts’un hurriedly got up and looked out. He saw at a glance that it was a servant girl engaged in picking flowers. Her deportment was out of the common; her eyes so bright, her eyebrows so well defined. Though not a perfect beauty, she possessed nevertheless charms sufficient to arouse the feelings. Yue-ts’un unwittingly gazed at her with fixed eye. This waiting-maid, belonging to the Chen family, had done picking flowers, and was on the point of going in, when she of a sudden raised her eyes and became aware of the presence of some person inside the window, whose head-gear consisted of a turban in tatters, while his clothes were the worse for wear. But in spite of his poverty, he was naturally endowed with a round waist, a broad back, a fat face, a square mouth; added to this, his eyebrows were swordlike, his eyes resembled stars, his nose was straight, his cheeks square. This servant girl turned away in a hurry and made her escape. “This man so burly and strong,” she communed within herself, “yet at the same time got up in such poor attire, must, I expect, be no one else than the man, whose name is Chia Yue-ts’un or such like, time after time referred to by my master, and to whom he has repeatedly wished to give a helping hand, but has failed to find a favourable opportunity. And as related to our family there is no connexion or friend in such straits , I feel certain it cannot be any other person than he. Strange to say, my master has further remarked that this man will, for a certainty, not always continue in such a state of destitution.” As she indulged in this train of thought, she could not restrain herself from turning her head round once or twice. When Yue-ts’un perceived that she had looked back, he readily interpreted it as a sign that in her heart her thoughts had been of him, and he was frantic with irrepressible joy. “This girl,” he mused, “is, no doubt, keen-eyed and eminently shrewd, and one in this world who has seen through me.” The servant youth, after a short time, came into the room; and when Yue-ts’un made inquiries and found out from him that the guests in the front parlour had been detained to dinner, he could not very well wait any longer, and promptly walked away down a side passage and out of a back door. When the guests had taken their leave, Shih-yin did not go back to rejoin Yue-ts’un, as he had come to know that he had already left.","Left to himself, Yu-cun was flicking through some of Shi-yin’s books of poetry in order to pass the time, when he heard a woman’s cough outside the window. Immediately he jumped up and peered out to see who it was. The cough appeared to have come from a maid who was picking flowers in the garden. She was an unusually good-looking girl with a rather refined face: not a great beauty, by any means, but with something striking about her. Yu-cun gazed at her spellbound. Having now finished picking her flowers, this anonymous member of the Zhen household was about to go in again when, on some sudden impulse, she raised her head and caught sight of a man standing in the window. His hat was frayed and his clothing threadbare; yet, though obviously poor, he had a fine, manly physique and handsome, well-proportioned features. The maid hastened to remove herself from this male presence; but as she went she thought to herself, ‘What a fine-looking man! But so shabby! The family hasn’t got any friends or relations as poor as that. It must be that Jia Yu-cun the master is always on about. No wonder he says that he won’t stay poor long. I remember hearing him say that he’s often wanted to help him but hasn’t yet found an opportunity.’ And thinking these thoughts she could not forbear to turn back for another peep or two. Yu-cun saw her turn back and, at once assuming that she had taken a fancy to him, was beside himself with delight. What a perceptive young woman she must be, he thought, to have seen the genius underneath the rags! A real friend in trouble! After a while the boy came in again and Yu-cun elicited from him that the visitor in the front room was now staying to dinner. It was obviously out of the question to wait much longer, so he slipped down the passage-way at the side of the house and let himself out by the back gate. Nor did Shi-yin invite him round again when, having at last seen off his visitor, he learned that Yu-cun had already left."
誰知狗兒利名心最重，聽如此一說，心下便有些活動起來，又聽他妻子這話，便笑接著：「姥姥既如此說，況且當年你又見過這姑太太一次，何不你老人家明日就走一趟，先試試風頭再說。」劉姥姥道：「噯喲喲！可是說的，『侯門深似海』，我是個什麼東西，他家人又不認得我，我去了也是白去的。」,"Who knows that Gouer is most concerned with fame and fortune. Hearing this, his heart became a little more active. Hearing his wife's words, he smiled and continued: ""Grandma said so, besides, you met this auntie once again. Why don't you visit the old man tomorrow, and try to get the limelight first."" Grandma Liu said, ""Ah yo! But you said, 'Houmen is as deep as the sea', what am I, his family doesn't recognize me, I It’s a waste of time to go.”","Kou Erh, who would have thought it, prized highly both affluence and fame, so that when he heard these remarks, he forthwith began to feel at heart a little more at ease. When he furthermore heard what his wife had to say, he at once caught up the word as he smiled. “Old mother,” he rejoined; “since that be your idea, and what’s more, you have in days gone by seen this lady on one occasion, why shouldn’t you, old lady, start tomorrow on a visit to her and first ascertain how the wind blows!” “Ai Ya!” exclaimed old Goody, “It may very well be said that the marquis’ door is like the wide ocean! what sort of thing am I? why the servants of that family wouldn’t even recognise me! even were I to go, it would be on a wild goose chase.”","Gou-er’s cupidity, however, had been aroused by the words of his mother-in-law, and his reaction to them was less discouraging than his wife’s. ‘Well, if it’s as you say, Grannie, and being as you’ve already seen this lady, why not go there yourself and spy out the land for us?’ ‘Bless us and save us!’ said Grannie Liu. ‘You know what they say: “A prince’s door is like the deep sea.” What sort of creature do you take me for ? The servants there don’t know me; it would be a journey wasted.’ ‘That’s no problem,’ said Gou-er. ‘I’ll tell you what to do."
接著回事的人來，不止三四次，賈璉害乏，便傳與二門上，一應不許傳報，俱等明日料理。鳳姐至三更時分方下來安歇。一宿無話。,"Then the people who happened next came, more than three or four times, and Jia Lian was tired, so he passed it on to the second door. Sister Feng came down to rest at the third watch. A night without words.","Having finished speaking, he dismissed the two young men; and, in quick succession, servants came to make their business reports, not limited to three and five companies, but as Chia Lien felt exhausted, he forthwith sent word to those on duty at the second gate not to allow any one at all to communicate any reports, and that the whole crowd should wait till the next day, when he would give his mind to what had to be done. Lady Feng did not come to retire to rest till the third watch; but nothing need be said about the whole night.","Their departure was followed by a succession of three or four visits by servants reporting on household matters, after which he felt so exhausted that he instructed the servants on the inner gate to refuse admittance to any others and to inform them that he would deal with their business next day. It was midnight by the time Xi-feng got back to bed. But the affairs of that night are no part of our story."
喫了飯點戲時，賈母一定先叫寶釵點。寶釵推讓一遍，無法，只得點了一折《西遊記》。賈母自是歡喜，然後便命鳳姐點。鳳姐亦知賈母喜熱鬧，更喜謔笑科諢，便點了一出《劉二當衣》。賈母果真更又喜歡，然後便命黛玉點。黛玉因讓薛姨媽王夫人等。賈母道：「今日原是我特帶著你們取笑，咱們只管咱們的，別理他們。我巴巴的唱戲擺酒，為他們不成？他們在這裏白聽白喫，已經便宜了，還讓他們點呢！」說著，大家都笑了。黛玉方點了一出。然後寶玉、史湘雲、迎、探、惜、李紈等俱各點了。按出扮演。,"When eating dinner, Mother Jia must call Baochai first. Baochai pushed him again, but couldn't, so he had to order ""Journey to the West"" at a discount. Mother Jia was very happy, and then ordered Sister Feng to order. Sister Feng also knew that Jia's mother likes to be lively, and she likes to laugh and joke, so she ordered ""Liu Er Dang Yi"". Jia Mu really liked it even more, and then ordered Daiyu to order it. Dai Yuyin asked Aunt Xue, Mrs. Wang, to wait. Mother Jia said: ""Today, I was the one who brought you here to make fun of you. Let's just take care of ours and ignore them. I'll sing and play and drink wine, can't I do it for them? It's time!"" After saying that, everyone laughed. Dai Yufang nodded. Then Baoyu, Shi Xiangyun, Ying, Tan, Xi, Li Wan and others all made their points. Press out to play.","When the time arrived to make a selection of the plays, dowager lady Chia of her own motion first asked Pao-ch’ai to mark off those she liked; and though for a time Pao-ch’ai declined, yielding the choice to others, she had no alternative but to decide, fixing upon a play called, “the Record of the Western Tour,” a play of which the old lady was herself very fond. Next in order, she bade lady Feng choose, and lady Feng, had, after all, in spite of madame Wang ranking before her in precedence, to consider old lady Chia’s request, and not to presume to show obstinacy by any disobedience. But as she knew well enough that her ladyship had a penchant for what was exciting, and that she was still more partial to jests, jokes, epigrams, and buffoonery , she therefore hastened to precede (madame Wang) and to choose a play, which was in fact no other than “Liu Erh pawns his clothes.” Dowager lady Chia was, of course, still more elated. And after this she speedily went on to ask Tai-yue to choose. Tai-yue likewise concedingly yielded her turn in favour of madame Wang and the other seniors, to make their selections before her, but the old lady expostulated. “To-day,” she said, “is primarily an occasion, on which I’ve brought all of you here for your special recreation; and we had better look after our own selves and not heed them! For have I, do you imagine, gone to the trouble of having a performance and laying a feast for their special benefit? they’re already reaping benefit enough by being in here, listening to the plays and partaking of the banquet, when they have no right to either; and are they to be pressed further to make a choice of plays?” At these words, the whole company had a hearty laugh; after which, Tai-yue, at length, marked off a play; next in order following Pao-yue, Shih Hsiang-yuen, Ying-ch’un, T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un, widow Li Wan, and the rest, each and all of whom made a choice of plays, which were sung in the costumes necessary for each. When the time came to take their places at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch’ai make another selection, and Pao-ch’ai cast her choice upon the play: “Lu Chih-shen, in a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T’ai mountain;” whereupon Pao-yue interposed, with the remark: “All you fancy is to choose plays of this kind;”","As soon as they had eaten, it was time to talk about choosing the plays and Grandmother Jia called on Bao-chai to begin. Bao-chai made a show of declining; but it was her birthday, and in the end she gave in and selected a piece about Monkey from The Journey to the West. Grandmother Jia was pleased. Aunt Xue was now invited to pick a play, but as her own daughter had just chosen, she refused. Grandmother Jia did not press her and passed on to Xi-feng. Xi-feng would normally have refused to take precedence over her aunt and mother-in-law, who were both present, but Grandmother had commanded and must be obeyed. As she happened to know that the old lady’s partiality for lively plays was particularly strong in the case of those which had lots of jokes and clowning in them, she selected a piece entitled Liu Er Pawns His Clothes in order to make sure that this element was not lacking from the programme. As she had anticipated, Grandmother Jia was even more delighted by this second choice. Next Dai-yu was asked to choose. She deferred to Aunt Xing and Aunt Wang; but Grandmother Jia was insistent: ‘I’ve brought you young people here today for some fun,’ she said. ‘I want you to enjoy yourselves. Never mind about them! I didn’t go to all this trouble just for their sakes 1 They are lucky to be here at all, having all this good food and entertainment for nothing: you surely don’t think that on top of that I’m going to let them choose the plays?’ The others all laughed, and Dai-yu chose a play. Then Bao-yu, Shi Xiang-yun, Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Li Wan each chose a play in turn, after which the little players proceeded to perform them in the order in which they had been selected. When the time came to bring in the wine and begin the feast, Grandmother Jia invited Bao-chai to choose again."
話說賈璉聽鳳姐兒說有話商量，因止步問是何話。鳳姐道：「二十一是薛妹妹的生日，你到底怎麼樣呢？」賈璉道：「我知道怎麼樣！你連多少大生日都料理過了，這會子倒沒了主意？」鳳姐道：「大生日料理，不過是有一定的則例在那裏。如今他這生日，大又不是，小又不是，所以和你商量。」賈璉聽了，低頭想了半日道：「你今兒糊塗了。現有比例在那裏，那林妹妹就是比樣。往年怎麼給林妹妹過的，如今也照依給薛妹妹過就是了。」鳳姐聽了，冷笑道：「我難道連這個也不知道？我原也這麼想定了。但昨兒聽見老太太說，問起大家的年紀生日來，聽見薛大妹妹今年十五歲，雖不是整生日，也算得將笄之年。老太太說要替他作生日。想來若果真替他作，自然比往年與林妹妹的不同了。」賈璉道：「既如此，比林妹妹的多增些。」鳳姐道：「我也這們想著，所以討你的口氣。我若私自添了東西，你又怪我不告訴明白你了。」賈璉笑道：「罷，罷，這空頭情我不領。你不盤察我就夠了，我還怪你！」說著，一徑去了，不在話下。,"It was said that Jia Lian heard what Sister Feng said that she had something to discuss, but stopped to ask what she was talking about. Sister Feng said, ""Twenty-first is Sister Xue's birthday. How are you?"" Jia Lian said, ""I know how! You've even cooked so many big birthdays, and now you've lost your mind?"" Sister Feng said: ""Big birthday cooking, but there are certain rules there. Now his birthday is not big or small, so I will discuss it with you."" Jia Lian listened, lowered her head and thought for a long time: ""You are confused today. The current ratio is there, so Sister Lin is just like that. How did you give it to Sister Lin in the past, and now it’s just for Sister Xue.” When Sister Feng heard this, she sneered, “Don’t I even know this? I I thought so too. But yesterday, I heard the old lady say that when I asked about everyone's age and birthday, I heard that Sister Xue is fifteen years old this year. Birthday. If you really want to do it for him, it will be different than the one with Sister Lin in previous years."" Jia Lian said, ""In this case, it is more than Sister Lin's."" Sister Feng said, ""I also think about this, so I beg you. If I add something privately, you will blame me for not telling you.” Jia Lian smiled: “Well, well, I won’t accept this empty love. It’s enough if you don’t check me, I also blame you! ""As he said that, he went all the way, no problem.","Chia Lien, for we must now prosecute our story, upon hearing lady Feng observe that she had something to consult about with him, felt constrained to halt and to inquire what it was about. “On the 21st,” lady Feng explained, “is cousin Hsueeh’s birthday, and what do you, after all, purpose doing?” “Do I know what to do?” exclaimed Chia Lien; “you have made, time and again, arrangements for ever so many birthdays of grown-up people, and do you, really, find yourself on this occasion without any resources?” “Birthdays of grown-up people are subject to prescribed rules,” lady Feng expostulated; “but her present birthday is neither one of an adult nor that of an infant, and that’s why I would like to deliberate with you!” Chia Lien upon hearing this remark, lowered his head and gave himself to protracted reflection. “You’re indeed grown dull!” he cried; “why you’ve a precedent ready at hand to suit your case! Cousin Lin’s birthday affords a precedent, and what you did in former years for cousin Lin, you can in this instance likewise do for cousin Hsueeh, and it will be all right.” At these words lady Feng gave a sarcastic smile. “Do you, pray, mean to insinuate,” she added, “that I’m not aware of even this! I too had previously come, after some thought, to this conclusion; but old lady Chia explained, in my hearing yesterday, that having made inquiries about all their ages and their birthdays, she learnt that cousin Hsueeh would this year be fifteen, and that though this was not the birthday, which made her of age, she could anyhow well be regarded as being on the dawn of the year, in which she would gather up her hair, so that our dowager lady enjoined that her anniversary should, as a matter of course, be celebrated, unlike that of cousin Lin.” “Well, in that case,” Chia Lien suggested, “you had better make a few additions to what was done for cousin Lin!” “That’s what I too am thinking of,” lady Feng replied, “and that’s why I’m asking your views; for were I, on my own hook, to add anything you would again feel hurt for my not have explained things to you.” “That will do, that will do!” Chia Lien rejoined laughing, “none of these sham attentions for me! So long as you don’t pry into my doings it will be enough; and will I go so far as to bear you a grudge?” With these words still in his mouth, he forthwith went off.","Hearing that Xi-feng wanted to consult him about something, Jia Lian halted and asked her what it was. ‘It’s Bao-chai ’s birthday on the twenty-first,’ said Xi-feng. ‘What do you think we ought to do about it?’ ‘How should I know?’ said Jia Lian. ‘You’ve managed plenty of big birthday celebrations before in your time. Why have you become so helpless all of a sudden?’ ‘There are fixed rules for everything when you are planning a big grown-up celebration,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but in Bao-chai’s case she’s neither exactly grown-up nor exactly a child any longer. That’s why I wanted your advice.’ Jia Lian lowered his head and thought for a moment. ‘Why, you’re being stupid!’ he said presently. ‘There’s a precedent right in front of you. What about Dai-yu ? All you’ve got to do is find what arrangements you made in the past for her and do exactly the same for Bao-chai now.’ ‘Do you suppose I didn’t think of that?’ said Xi-feng with scorn. ‘I’m not that stupid! The point is that yesterday, because of something Grandma said, I started asking them all their birthdays and ages, and it seems that on this birthday of hers on the twenty-first Bao-chai is going to be fifteen. Now that doesn’t qualify for a full-scale celebration, but it is a sort of coming-of-age, and when Grandma heard about it she said she wanted to sponsor something for it herself. So obviously, whatever we do, it can’t be quite the same as what we’ve done in the past for Dai-yu.’ ‘Well in that case,’ said Jia Lian, ‘take what you did for Dai-yu as a basis and just add on a bit.’ ‘That’s what I’d thought of doing,’ said Xi-feng; ‘but I wanted to see what you thought before doing anything definite, because I didn’t want to go adding extras on my own initiative and then have you complaining that you hadn’t been properly consulted.’ ‘You can cut that out!’ said Jia Lian – though not ill-humouredly. ‘You know you don’t really mean a word of it! Just stop snooping on me all the time, that’s all I ask. You won’t hear any complaints from me then about not being consulted!’ With that he walked off: but whither, or to whom, our narrative does not disclose."
王夫人因說：「你舅舅今日齋戒去了，再見罷。衹是有一句話囑咐你：你三個姊妹倒都極好，以後一處唸書認字學針線，或是偶一頑笑，都有儘讓的。但我不放心的最是一件：我有一個孽根禍胎，是家裏的『混世魔王』，今日因廟裏還願去了，尚未回來，晚間你看見便知了。你只以後不要睬他，你這些姊妹都不敢沾惹他的。」,"Madam Wang Yin said: ""Your uncle has gone to fast today, see you again. There is just one sentence to instruct you: Your three sisters are all very good. In the future, they will study, read and write, learn needle and thread, or even laugh. There is everything. But the most worrying thing about me is this: I have a misfortune, the ""Devil King"" of the family. Today, I went to the temple to make a promise, and I haven't come back. You will know when you see it at night. Don't pay attention to him in the future, you sisters don't dare to mess with him.""","“Your uncle,” madame Wang explained, “is gone to observe this day as a fast day, but you’ll see him by and bye. There’s, however, one thing I want to talk to you about. Your three female cousins are all, it is true, everything that is nice; and you will, when later on you come together for study, or to learn how to do needlework, or whenever, at any time, you romp and laugh together, find them all most obliging; but there’s one thing that causes me very much concern. I have here one, who is the very root of retribution, the incarnation of all mischief, one who is a ne’er-do-well, a prince of malignant spirits in this family. He is gone to-day to pay his vows in the temple, and is not back yet, but you will see him in the evening, when you will readily be able to judge for yourself. One thing you must do, and that is, from this time forth, not to pay any notice to him. All these cousins of yours don’t venture to bring any taint upon themselves by provoking him.”","‘Your uncle is in retreat today,’ said Lady Wang. ‘He will see you another time. There is, however, something I have got to talk to you about. The three girls are very well-behaved children, and in future, when you are studying or sewing together, even if once in a while they may grow a bit high-spirited, I can depend on them not to go too far. There is only one thing that worries me. I have a little monster of a son who tyrannizes over all the rest of this household. He has gone off to the temple today in fulfilment of a vow and is not yet back; but you will see what I mean this evening. The thing to do is never to take any notice of him. None of your cousins dare provoke him.’"
這賈菌亦係榮國府近派的重孫，其母亦少寡，獨守著賈菌。這賈菌與賈蘭最好，所以二人同桌而坐。誰知賈菌年紀雖小，志氣最大，極是淘氣不怕人的。他在座上冷眼看見金榮的朋友暗助金榮，飛硯來打茗煙，偏沒打著茗煙，便落在他桌上，正打在面前，將一個磁硯水壺打了個粉碎，濺了一書墨水。賈菌如何依得，便罵：「好囚攮的們，這不都動了手了麼！」罵著，也便抓起硯磚來要打回去。賈蘭是個省事的，忙按住硯，極口勸道：「好兄弟，不與咱們相干。」賈菌如何忍得住，便兩手抱起書匣子來，照那邊掄了去。終是身小力薄，卻掄不到那裏，剛到寶玉秦鍾桌案上就落了下來。只聽嘩啷啷一聲，砸在桌上，書本紙片等至於筆硯之物撒了一桌，又把寶玉的一碗茶也砸得碗碎茶流。賈菌便跳出來，要揪打那一個飛硯的。金榮此時隨手抓了一根毛竹大板在手，地狹人多，那裏經得舞動長板。茗煙早喫了一下，亂嚷：「你們還不來動手！」寶玉還有三個小廝：一名鋤藥，一名掃紅，一名墨雨。這三個豈有不淘氣的，一齊亂嚷：「小婦養的！動了兵器了！」墨雨遂掇起一根門閂，掃紅鋤藥手中都是馬鞭子，蜂擁而上。賈瑞急的攔一回這個，勸一回那個，誰聽他的話，肆行大鬧。眾頑童也有趁勢幫著打太平拳助樂的，也有膽小藏在一邊的，也有直立在桌上拍著手兒亂笑，喝著聲兒叫打的。登時間鼎沸起來。,"This giardia is also the great-grandson of the closest faction of the Rongguo government. This Jiajian and Jialan are the best, so they sit at the same table. Who would have thought that although Jia Jian was young, he had the greatest ambition, and was extremely naughty and not afraid of people. From his seat, he saw Jin Rong's friend secretly help Jin Rong, Fei Yan came to play the tea, but he didn't play the tea, and landed on his table, hitting him in front of him, smashing a magnetic ink-stone kettle, Splattered a book of ink. How Yi De, Jia Jian cursed: ""You good prisoners, didn't they all use their hands!"" After cursing, he also grabbed the inkstone and tried to fight it back. Jia Lan was an easy-going man, so he hurriedly held down the inkstone and persuaded, ""Good brother, it has nothing to do with us."" How could Jia Yan hold back, he picked up the bookcase with both hands and swung it there. He was small and weak all his life, but he couldn't get there, and he fell on Baoyu Qin Zhong's table as soon as he arrived. With a clatter, it smashed onto the table, books, paper, etc., as well as the pen and inkstone, were scattered on the table, and Baoyu's bowl of tea was also smashed into pieces. Jia Jian jumped out and wanted to grab the one Fei Yan. At this time, Jin Rong grabbed a large bamboo board in his hand. Mingyan ate a bit early, and shouted: ""You guys still don't come and do it!"" Baoyu also had three servants: one for hoeing medicine, one for sweeping red, and one for Moyu. How could these three not be naughty, they shouted in unison: ""Little woman's support! Weapons are used!"" Mo Yu then slammed a door latch, sweeping red hoes with horsewhips in their hands, and swarmed up. Jia Rui hurriedly stopped this once and persuaded that once, whoever listened to his words would make a scene. The urchins also took advantage of the situation to help play Taiping, some were timid and hid, and some stood upright on the table, clapping their hands and laughing, drinking and calling. Deng time is boiling.","These two, Chia Lan and Chia Chuen, were also the great-grandsons of a close branch of the Jung mansion. This Chia Chuen had been left fatherless at an early age, and his mother doated upon him in an unusual manner, and it was because at school he was on most friendly terms with Chia Lan, that these two sat together at the same desk. Who would have believed that Chia Chuen would, in spite of being young in years, have had an extremely strong mind, and that he would be mostly up to mischief without the least fear of any one. He watched with listless eye from his seat Chin Jung’s friends stealthily assist Chin Jung, as they flung an inkslab to strike Ming Yen, but when, as luck would have it, it hit the wrong mark, and fell just in front of him, smashing to atoms the porcelain inkslab and water bottle, and smudging his whole book with ink, Chia Chuen was, of course, much incensed, and hastily gave way to abuse. “You consummate pugnacious criminal rowdies! why, doesn’t this amount to all of you taking a share in the fight!” And as he uttered this abuse, he too forthwith seized an inkslab, which he was bent upon flinging. Chia Lan was one who always tried to avoid trouble, so that he lost no time in pressing down the inkslab, while with all the words his mouth could express, he tried to pacify him, adding “My dear brother, it’s no business of yours and mine.” Chia Chuen could not repress his resentment; and perceiving that the inkslab was held down, he at once laid hold of a box containing books, which he flung in this direction; but being, after all, short of stature, and weak of strength, he was unable to send it anywhere near the mark; so that it dropped instead when it got as far as the desk belonging to Pao-yue and Ch’in Chung, while a dreadful crash became audible as it fell smash on the table. The books, papers, pencils, inkslabs, and other writing materials were all scattered over the whole table; and Pao-yue’s cup besides containing tea was itself broken to pieces and the tea spilt. Chia Chuen forthwith jumped forward with the intent of assailing the person who had flung the inkslab at the very moment that Chin Jung took hold of a long bamboo pole which was near by; but as the space was limited, and the pupils many, how could he very well brandish a long stick? Ming Yen at an early period received a whack, and he shouted wildly, “Don’t you fellows yet come to start a fight.” Pao-yue had, besides, along with him several pages, one of whom was called Sao Hung, another Ch’u Yo, another Mo Yue. These three were naturally up to every mischief, so that with one voice, bawling boisterously, “You children of doubtful mothers, have you taken up arms?” Mo Yue promptly took up the bar of a door; while Sao Hung and Ch’u Yo both laid hold of horsewhips, and they all rushed forward like a hive of bees. Chia Jui was driven to a state of exasperation; now he kept this one in check, and the next moment he reasoned with another, but who would listen to his words? They followed the bent of their inclinations and stirred up a serious disturbance. Of the whole company of wayward young fellows, some there were who gave sly blows for fun ’s sake","Jia Jun had lost his father in infancy and was doted on by his widowed mother. Jia Lan was his best friend, which is why they always sat next to each other in school. Though Jia Jun was among the youngest in the class, his tiny body contained an heroic soul. He was extremely mischievous and completely fearless. With the impartial interest of an observer he had watched a friend of Jokey Jin’s slyly aim the inkstone at Tealeaf; but when it fell short and landed right in front of him on his own desk, smashing a porcelain water-bottle and showering his books with inky water, his blood was up. ‘Rotten swine!’ he shouted. ‘If this is a free-for-all, here goes!’ and he grabbed at the inkstone intending to send it sailing back. But Jia Lan was a man of peace and held it firmly down. ‘Leave it, old chap! It’s none of our business,’ he counselled. Jia Jun was not to be restrained, however. Deprived of the inkstone, he picked up a satchel full of books and raising it in both hands above his head, hurled it in the direction of the assailant. Unfortunately his body was too small and his strength too puny for so great a trajectory, and the satchel fell on the desk occupied by Bao-yu and Qin Zhong. It landed with a tremendous crash, scattering books, papers, writing-brushes and inkstones in all directions and smashing Bao-yu’s teabowl to smithereens so that tea flowed over everything round about. Nothing daunted, Jia Jun leaped out and rushed upon the thrower of inkstones to smite him. Meanwhile Jokey Jin had found a bamboo pole which he flailed around him: a terrible weapon in so confined and crowded a space. Soon Tealeaf had sustained a blow from it and was bawling for reinforcements from outside. There were three other pages in attendance on Bao-yu besides himself, all equally inclined to mischief. Their names were Sweeper, Ploughboy and Inky. With a great-shout of ‘To arms! To arms! Down with the bastards!’ these three now came rushing like angry hornets into the classroom, Inky wielding a doorbar which he had picked up and Sweeper and Ploughboy brandishing horsewhips. Jia Rui, in a frenzy of outraged authority, hopped from one to the other, alternately grabbing and cajoling, but none would take the slightest bit of notice. Disorder was now general. The more mischievous of the scholars mingled gleefully in the fray, safe, in the general scrimmage, to land punches at chosen foes without fear of discovery or reprisal. The more timid crawled into places of safety. Others stood on their desks, laughing and clapping their hands and cheering on the combatants. The classroom was like a cauldron of still water that had suddenly come to the boil."
卻說鳳姐等又過一日，次日方別了老尼，着他三日後往府裏去討信。那秦鍾與智能百般不忍分離，背地裏多少幽期密約，俱不用細述，只得含恨而別。鳳姐又到鐵檻寺中照望一番。然後眾人都回家。寶珠執意不肯回家，賈珍只得派婦女相伴。後回再見。,"But she said that Sister Feng waited for another day, and the next day, she said goodbye to the old man, and asked him to go to the mansion to ask for letters three days later. Then Qin Zhong and Zhizhi couldn't bear to be separated in every possible way, and there was no need to elaborate on how many secret covenants in the secret period, and they had to leave with hatred. Sister Feng went to Tiejian Temple to take care of her again. Then everyone went home. Baozhu insisted not to go home, Jia Zhen had to send women to accompany her. See you later.","Having spent another day, she on the morrow took leave of the old nun, whom she advised to come to the mansion after the expiry of three days to fetch a reply. Ch’in Chung and Chih Neng could not, by any means, brook the separation, and they secretly agreed to a clandestine assignation; but to these details we need not allude with any minuteness; sufficient to say that they had no alternative but to bear the anguish and to part. Lady Feng crossed over again to the temple of the Iron Fence and ascertained how things were progressing. But as Pao Chu was obstinate in her refusal to return home, Chia Chen found himself under the necessity of selecting a few servants to act as her companions. But the reader must listen to what is said in the next chapter by way of explanation.","When their second day at the priory was over, Xi-feng and the boys took leave of Euergesia, and as she said good-bye, Xi-feng told the prioress to call at the Rong-guo mansion in two days’ time to hear the news from Chang-an. This parting was an unbearably painful one for Sapientia and Qin Zhong, and all sorts of secret vows were exchanged and whispered contracts made before they could tear themselves apart. We omit all details of that harrowing scene. Xi-feng called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on the way back to see that everything was in order. Jewel, it seemed, refused absolutely to go back home, and Cousin Zhen was obliged to leave a woman or two at the temple to keep her company. Their return, and the events which followed it, will be dealt with in the following chapter."
這裏薛姨媽已擺了幾樣細巧茶菓來留他們喫茶。寶玉因誇前日在東府裏珍大嫂子的好鵝掌鴨信。薛姨媽聽了，忙也把自己糟的取了些來與他嘗。寶玉笑道：「這個須得就酒纔好。」薛姨媽便令人去灌了最上等的酒來。李嬤嬤便上來道：「姨太太，酒倒罷了。」寶玉笑央道：「媽媽，我只喝一鍾。」李嬤嬤道：「不中用！當著老太太、太太，那怕你喫一壇呢。想那日我眼錯不見一會子，不知是那一個沒調教的，圖討你的好兒，不管別人死活，給了你一口酒喫，葬送了我挨了兩日的罵。姨太太不知道，他性子又可惡，喫了酒更弄性。有一日老太太高興了，又儘著他喫，什麼日子又不許他喫，我是白賠在裏頭挨罵。」薛姨媽笑道：「老貨，你只放心，你們哥兒喫多了回去，老太太問時，有我呢。」一面令小丫鬟：「來，讓你奶奶們去，也喫杯搪搪雪氣。」那李嬤嬤聽如此說，只得和眾人且去喫些酒水。這裏寶玉又說：「不必溫熱了，我只愛喫冷的。」薛姨媽忙道：「這可使不得，喫了冷酒，寫字手要打顫兒。」寶釵笑道：「寶兄弟，虧你每日家雜學旁收的，難道就不知道酒性最熱，若熱喫下去，發散就快；若冷喫下去，便凝結在內，以五臟去暖他，豈不受害？從此快不要喫那冷酒了。」寶玉聽這話有情理，便放下冷酒，命暖來方飲。,"Here, Aunt Xue has placed a few kinds of delicate tea fruits to keep them for tea. Baoyu praised her sister-in-law's good goose-paw duck letter in Dongfu the day before yesterday. When Aunt Xue heard it, she hurriedly took some of her own to taste with him. Baoyu said with a smile, ""It's all about drinking."" Aunt Xue asked her to drink the best wine. Mammy Li came up and said, ""Auntie, just pour the wine."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Mom, I only drink a bell."" Mammy Li said, ""It's useless! In front of the old lady and madam, even if you are afraid of you Eat a jar. Thinking about that day, I couldn't see for a while. I don't know who was the one who didn't train, trying to please you, regardless of other people's life or death, gave you a mouthful of wine to eat, and ruined me for two days. Scolding. My aunt doesn't know, his temper is abominable, and he's even more sexual after drinking alcohol. One day the old lady was happy, and she ate it as much as she could, but she didn't allow him to eat it on any day. I was scolded in vain."" Aunt Xue He smiled and said, ""Old man, don't worry, you guys have eaten too much and go back. When the old lady asked, I was there."" On the other hand, he ordered the little maid: ""Come on, let your grandmothers go, and have a cup of glutinous snow. ."" Then Mammy Li heard this, so she had to go and have some drinks with the crowd. Here Baoyu said again, ""No need to be warm, I only like to eat cold."" Aunt Xue said hurriedly, ""This is not acceptable. If you eat cold wine, your writing hand will tremble."" Baochai smiled and said, ""Brother Bao. , thanks to your daily collection of miscellaneous school, don't you know that wine is the hottest, if you eat it hot, it will dissipate quickly; if you eat it cold, it will condense inside, and use the five internal organs to warm him, won't it hurt? From now on, don't eat that cold wine."" Baoyu listened to this and made sense, so she put down the cold wine and ordered a warm drink.","By this time Mrs. Hsueeh had prepared tea and several kinds of nice things and kept them all to partake of those delicacies. Pao-yue, having spoken highly of some goose feet and ducks’ tongues he had tasted some days before, at his eldest sister-in-law’s, Mrs. Yu’s, “aunt” Hsueeh promptly produced several dishes of the same kind, made by herself, and gave them to Pao-yue to try. “With a little wine,” added Pao-yue with a smile, “they would be first rate.” Mrs. Hsueeh thereupon bade the servants fetch some wine of the best quality; but dame Li came forward and remonstrated. “My lady,” she said, “never mind the wine.” Pao-yue smilingly pleaded: “My nurse, I’ll take just one cup and no more.” “It’s no use,” nurse Li replied, “were your grandmother and mother present, I wouldn’t care if you drank a whole jar. I remember the day when I turned my eyes away but for a moment, and some ignorant fool or other, merely with the view of pandering for your favour, gave you only a drop of wine to drink, and how this brought reproaches upon me for a couple of days. You don’t know, my lady, you have no idea of his disposition! it’s really dreadful; and when he has had a little wine he shows far more temper. On days when her venerable ladyship is in high spirits, she allows him to have his own way about drinking, but he’s not allowed to have wine on any and every day; and why should I have to suffer inside and all for nothing at all?” “You antiquated thing!” replied Mrs. Hsueeh laughing, “set your mind at ease, and go and drink your own wine! I won’t let him have too much, and should even the old lady say anything, let the fault be mine.” Saying this, she asked a waiting-maid to take nurse Li along with her and give her also a glass of wine so as to keep out the cold air. When nurse Li heard these words, she had no alternative but to go for a time with all the others and have some wine to drink. “The wine need not be warmed: I prefer it cold!” Pao-yue went on to suggest meanwhile. “That won’t do,” remonstrated Mrs. Hsueeh; “cold wine will make your hand tremble when you write.” “You have,” interposed Pao Ch’ai smiling, “the good fortune, cousin Pao-yue, of having daily opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of every kind of subject, and yet do n’t you know that the properties of wine are mostly heating? If you drink wine warm, its effects soon dispel, but if you drink it cold, it at once congeals in you; and as upon your intestines devolves the warming of it, how can you not derive any harm? and won’t you yet from this time change this habit of yours? leave off at once drinking that cold wine.” Pao-yue finding that the words he had heard contained a good deal of sense, speedily put down the cold wine, and having asked them to warm it, he at length drank it.","By now Aunt Xue had finished laying tea, which included a number of delicious-looking things to eat, and invited the cousins to partake. While they were doing so, Bao-yu happened to mention the excellent goose-foot preserve made by his Cousin Zhen’s wife that he had eaten at the Ning mansion only two days previously. Aunt Xue at once hurried out and fetched some of her own for him to try. ‘This really needs to be eaten with wine,’ said Bao-yu. Aunt Xue gave orders for some of the best wine to be decanted; but Nannie Li disapproved. ‘He shouldn’t have wine, Mrs Xue.’ ‘Oh go on, Nannie I’ Bao-yu pleaded good-humouredly. ‘I shall only drink one cup.’ ‘It’s no good!’ said Nannie Li. ‘I don’t mind if you drink a hogshead as long as your grandmother or your mother is there. But look at the trouble I got into the other day just because when I had my back turned for a moment some wretched person who ought to have known better gave you a sip or two to humour you! I didn’t hear the end of it for days after. ‘You don’t know how wild he can be, Mrs Xue,’ she continued. ‘And he gets even worse when he’s had something to drink. With Her Old Ladyship you can never tell. One day when she’s feeling high-spirited she’ll let him drink as much as he likes; other days she won’t let him touch a drop. But come what may, I’m always the one that gets into trouble.’ ‘Poor old thing!’ said Aunt Xue with a laugh. ‘Have a drink yourself and stop worrying I I’ll see that he doesn’t drink too much. And if Lady Jia does say anything, I shall take full responsibility.’ She turned to one of the maids: ‘Come on, now! Pour Nannie a nice warm cup of wine to keep the cold out!’ Nannie Li could scarcely sustain her objection after this and went off with the other servants to have her drink. ‘Don’t bother to heat the wine for me,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I prefer it cold.’ ‘Good gracious, that will never do!’ said Aunt Xue. ‘You mustn’t drink wine cold, or when you write your hand will shake!’ ‘I’m surprised at you, Cousin Bao!’ said Bao-chai with a smile. ‘With all your enthusiasm for out-of-the-way learning, fancy not knowing a thing like that! Wine has an exceptionally fiery nature, and therefore must be drunk warm in order to be quickly digested. If it is drunk cold, it congeals inside the body and harms it by absorbing heat from the internal organs. From this day on you must reform! No more cold wine!’"
雨村一面打恭，謝不釋口，一面又問：「不知令親大人現居何職？只怕晚生草率，不敢驟然入都幹瀆。」如海笑道：「若論舍親，與尊兄猶係同譜，乃榮公之孫：大內兄現襲一等將軍，名赦，字恩侯；二內兄名政，字存周，現任工部員外郎，其為人謙恭厚道，大有祖父遺風，非膏粱輕薄仕宦之流，故弟方致書煩託。否則不但有污尊兄之清操，即弟亦不屑為矣。」雨村聽了，心下方信了昨日子興之言，於是又謝了林如海。如海乃說：「已擇了出月初二日小女入都，尊兄即同路而往，豈不兩便？」雨村唯唯聽命，心中十分得意。如海遂打點禮物並餞行之事，雨村一一領了。,"Yu Cun greeted him with a compliment and thanked him, and then asked again, ""I don't know what position your relatives live in now? I'm just afraid that I would be late and careless, so I wouldn't dare to enter the capital suddenly."" Ru Hai smiled and said, ""If you want to give up your relatives, you will be with him. The respected brother is still in the same pedigree, and is the grandson of Duke Rong: the eldest brother-in-law is now a first-class general, whose name is She, and his courtesy name is Enhou; My grandfather's legacy is not like a frivolous official, so my brother sent me a letter to ask for it. Otherwise, not only will I disrespect my brother, but my younger brother will be disdainful."" After hearing this, Amamun believed what Zixing said yesterday, so he thanked him again. Lin Ruhai. As Hai Nai said, ""I have chosen to enter the capital on the second day of the first month of the first month of the first month, and Zunxiong will go along the same road. Wouldn't it be both convenient?"" As Haisui ordered some gifts and went along with them, Amamura took them one by one.","“Pray,” he asked, “where does your honoured brother-in-law reside? and what is his official capacity? But I fear I’m too coarse in my manner, and could not presume to obtrude myself in his presence.” Ju-hai smiled. “And yet,” he remarked, “this brother-in-law of mine is after all of one and the same family as your worthy self, for he is the grandson of the Duke Jung. My elder brother-in-law has now inherited the status of Captain-General of the first grade. His name is She, his style Ngen-hou. My second brother-in-law’s name is Cheng, his style is Tzu-chou. His present post is that of a Second class Secretary in the Board of Works. He is modest and kindhearted, and has much in him of the habits of his grandfather; not one of that purse-proud and haughty kind of men. That is why I have written to him and made the request on your behalf. Were he different to what he really is, not only would he cast a slur upon your honest purpose, honourable brother, but I myself likewise would not have been as prompt in taking action.” When Yue-ts’un heard these remarks, he at length credited what had been told him by Tzu-hsing the day before, and he lost no time in again expressing his sense of gratitude to Lin Ju-hai. Ju-hai resumed the conversation. “I have fixed,” (he explained,) “upon the second of next month, for my young daughter’s departure for the capital, and, if you, brother mine, were to travel along with her, would it not be an advantage to herself, as well as to yourself ?” Yue-ts’un signified his acquiescence as he listened to his proposal; feeling in his inner self extremely elated. Ju-hai availed himself of the earliest opportunity to get ready the presents (for the capital) and all the requirements for the journey, which (when completed,) Yue-ts’un took over one by one.","Yu-cun made an elaborate bow to his patron and thanked him profusely. He then ventured a question. ‘I am afraid I do not know what your relation’s position is at the capital. Might it not be a little embarrassing for a person in my situation to thrust himself upon him ?’ Ru-hai laughed. ‘ You need have no anxiety on that score. My brothers-in-law in the capital are your own kinsmen. They are grandsons of the former Duke of Rong-guo. The elder one, Jia She, is an hereditary official of the First Rank and an honorary colonel; the younger one, Jia Zheng, is an Under Secretary in the Ministry of Works. He takes very much after his late grandfather: a modest, generous man, quite without the arrogance of the pampered aristocrat. That is why I have addressed this letter to him. If I did not have complete confidence in his willingness to help you, I should not have put your honour at risk by soliciting him; nor, for that matter, should I have taken the trouble to write the letter.’ Yu-cun now knew that what Zi-xing had told him was the truth and he thanked Lin Ru-hai once again. ‘I have fixed the second day of next month for my little girl’s journey to the capital,’ said Ru-hai. ‘If you cared to travel with her, it would be convenient for both of us.’ Yu-cun accepted the suggestion with eager deference."
雨村聽了，笑道：「可知我前言不謬。你我方纔所說的這幾個人，都只怕是那正邪兩賦而來一路之人，未可知也。」子興道：「邪也罷，正也罷，只顧算別人家的帳，你也喫一杯酒纔好。」雨村道：「正是，只顧說話，竟多喫了幾杯。」子興笑道：「說著別人家的閑話，正好下酒，即多喫幾杯何妨。」雨村向窗外看道：「天也晚了，仔細關了城。我們慢慢的進城再談，未為不可。」於是，二人起身，算還酒帳。方欲走時，又聽得後面有人叫道：「雨村兄，恭喜了！特來報個喜信的。」雨村忙回頭看時——,"Amamura listened and smiled and said, ""I know that my preface is not wrong. The few people you and I have just mentioned are only those who have come all the way from the good and the evil. I don't know."" Zixing said: ""Evil or evil. It’s okay, just pay attention to other people’s accounts, and you should have a glass of wine.” Yucun said: “Exactly, just talking, but eating a few more glasses.” Zixing laughed, “Speaking of other people’s gossip. , it’s just time for a drink, so why don’t you eat a few more glasses.” Amamura looked out the window and said, “It’s getting late, and the city is carefully closed. Let’s go into the city slowly and talk again, it’s not impossible.” So the two got up, Pay off the wine bill. When Fang was about to leave, he heard someone shouting from behind: ""Brother Yumura, congratulations! I'm here to report a good news."" When Yumura hurriedly looked back——","withdrew 35 li). In looks, she is also so extremely beautiful, in speech so extremely quick and fluent, in ingenuity so deep and astute, that even a man could, in no way, come up to her mark.” After hearing these remarks Yue-ts’un smiled. “You now perceive,” he said, “that my argument is no fallacy, and that the several persons about whom you and I have just been talking are, we may presume, human beings, who, one and all, have been generated by the spirit of right, and the spirit of evil, and come to life by the same royal road; but of course there’s no saying.” “Enough,” cried Tzu-hsing, “of right and enough of evil; we’ve been doing nothing but settling other people’s accounts; come now, have another glass, and you’ll be the better for it!” “While bent upon talking,” Yue-ts’un explained, “I’ve had more glasses than is good for me.” “Speaking of irrelevant matters about other people,” Tzu-hsing rejoined complacently, “is quite the thing to help us swallow our wine; so come now; what harm will happen, if we do have a few glasses more.” Yue-ts’un thereupon looked out of the window. “The day is also far advanced,” he remarked, “and if we don’t take care, the gates will be closing; let us leisurely enter the city, and as we go along, there will be nothing to prevent us from continuing our chat.” Forthwith the two friends rose from their seats, settled and paid their wine bill, and were just going, when they unexpectedly heard some one from behind say with a loud voice: “Accept my congratulations, Brother Yue-ts’un; I’ve now come, with the express purpose of giving you the welcome news!” Yue-ts’un lost no time in turning his head round to look at the speaker. But reader, if you wish to learn who the man was, listen to the details given in the following chapter.","‘You see, I was not mistaken,’ said Yu-cun. ‘All these people you and I have been talking about are probably examples of that mixture of good and evil humours I was describing to you.’ ‘Well, I don’t know about that,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Instead of sitting here setting other people’s accounts to rights, let’s have another drink I’ ‘I am afraid I have drunk quite a lot while we were busy talking,’ said Yu-cun. Zi-xing laughed. ‘There’s nothing like a good gossip about other people’s affairs for making the wine go down! I’m sure an extra cup or two won’t do us any harm.’ Yu-cun glanced out of the window. ‘It’s getting late. We must be careful we don’t get shut out of the city. Why not continue the conversation on our way back? Then we can take our time.’ The two men accordingly rose from their seats, settled the bill for the wine, and were just about to start on their way, when a voice from behind called out, ‘Yu-cun, congratulations! I’ve got some good news for you.’ Yu-cun turned to look. But if you wish to know who it was, you will have to read the next chapter."

The deacon and other things offered in front of the spirit are all according to the five-rank occupation regulations. On the shards of the spirit tablets, it is written ""The Heavenly Dynasty has granted Jiamen the spiritual position of the Qin clan's Gongren"". The front door of Huifang Garden was opened, and there were drum halls on both sides. Two groups of Tsing Yi played music on time, and a pair of knives and axes were placed on the deacons. There are also two large vermilion and gold plaques erected outside the door, with a large inscription: ""Protecting the Imperial Guard of the Forbidden Road in the Inner Court, Long Jinwei"". On the opposite side is a high-hanging altar, and the monk and Taoist altar list the text, and the big book is on the list: ""Hereditary Ningguo Gongzhong's granddaughter, protects the funeral of Jiamen Qin's Gongren, the former guard of the inner court.

The main entrance of the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, adjoining the street, was opened wide; and on both sides were raised sheds for the musicians, and two companies of players, dressed in blue, discoursed music at the proper times; while one pair after another of the paraphernalia was drawn out so straight as if cut by a knife or slit by an axe. There were also two large carmine boards, carved with gilt inscriptions, erected outside the gate; the designations in bold characters on the upper sides being: Guard of the Imperial Antechamber, charged with the protection of the Inner Palace and Roads, in the Red Prohibited City. On the opposite side, facing each other, rose, high above the ground, two altars for the services of the Buddhist and Taoist priests, while a placard bore the inscription in bold type: Funeral Obsequies of lady Ch’in, (by marriage) of the Chia mansion, by patent a lady of the fifth rank, consort of the eldest grandson of the hereditary duke of Ning Kuo, and guard of the Imperial Antechamber, charged with the protection of the Inner Palace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City.

The furnishings and insignia in the shrine were all rearranged in a manner befitting a person of the fifth rank. The wording on the spirit tablet which stood on the table of offerings at the foot of the coffin now read: Spirit tablet of the Lady Qin-shi of the Jia family Gentlewoman of the Fifth Rank by Imperial Patent The gate of the All-scents Garden opening on to the street was thrown wide open and booths for musicians were erected on either side of it, in which black-coated funeral bands played at fixed times throughout the day. To either side of them were displayed the insignia of rank: glittering rows of axes and halberds arranged in wooden stands. At each side of the gateway vermilion-painted boards inscribed in large golden characters boldly announced the status of the bereaved: Honorary Captain of the Imperial Bodyguard Inner Palace, Northern Capital Division Inside the gateway, facing the street, a high staging was constructed on which Buddhist monks and Taoist priests sat on opposite sides of an altar intoning their sacred texts. In front of the staging was a notice on which was written in large characters: FUNERAL OBSEQUIES OF THE LADY QIN-SHI Senior great-great-granddaughter-in-law of Jia Yan, Hereditary Duke of Ning-guo, and wife of the Right Honourable Jia Rong, Captain in the Imperial Bodyguard, Inner Palace: WHEREAS in this favoured Country, situate in the centre-most part of the four continents of the earth, on which it has pleased Heaven to bestow the blessings of everlasting prosperity and peace, WE, The Very Reverend Wan-xu, Co-President of the Board of Commissioners having authority over all monks and clergy of the Incorporeal, Ever-tranquil Church of the Lord Buddba, and the Venerable Ye-sbeng, Co-President of the Board of Commissioners having authority over all priests and practitioners of the Primordial, All-unifying Church of the Heavenly Too, HAVE, with all due reverence and care, prepared offices for the salvation of all departed souls, supplicating Heaven and calling upon the Name of the Lord Buddha… NOW, earnestly praying and beseeching the Eighteen Guardians of the Sangha, the Warlike Guardians of the Law, and the Twelve Guardians of the Months mercifully to extend their holy compassion towards us, but terribly to blaze forth in divine majesty against the powers of evil, we do solemnly perform for nine and forty days the Great Mass for the purification, deliverance and salvation of all souls on land and on sea…"
賈政道：「是算盤。」迎春笑道：「是。」又往下看是：「階下兒童仰面時，清明妝點最堪宜。游絲一斷渾無力，莫向東風怨別離。」,"Jia Zheng said, ""It's an abacus."" Yingchun smiled and said, ""Yes."" Looking down, he said, ""When the children under the stairs are looking up, the most appropriate makeup is during the Qingming Festival. When the hairspring is broken, it's powerless. Don't complain to the east wind to leave.""","Simply it is because the figures Yin and Yang do not agree. “It’s an abacus,” Chia Cheng observed. “Quite so!” replied Ying Ch’un smiling; after which they also conned the one below, by T’an-ch’un, which ran thus and had something to do with an object: This is the time when ‘neath the stairs the pages their heads raise! The term of “pure brightness” is the meetest time this thing to make! The vagrant silk it snaps, and slack, without tension it strays! The East wind don’t begrudge because its farewell it did take!","‘An abacus?’ There was a laugh from Ying-chun: ‘Yes.’ The next riddle was Tan-chun’s: In spring the little boys look up and stare To see me ride so proudly in the air.

且說賈蕓進去見了賈璉，因打聽可有什麼事情。賈璉告訴他：「前兒倒有一件事情出來，偏生你嬸子再三求了我，給了賈芹了。他許了我，說明兒園裏還有幾處要栽花木的地方，等這個工程出來，一定給你就是了。」賈蕓聽了，半晌說道：「既是這樣，我就等著罷。叔叔也不必先在嬸子跟前提我今兒來打聽的話，到跟前再說也不遲。」賈璉道：「提他作什麼，我那裏有這些工夫說閑話兒呢。明兒一個五更，還要到興邑去走一趟，須得當日趕回來纔好。你先去等著，後日起更以後你來討信兒，來早了我不得閑。」說著便回後面換衣服去了。,"Let's say that Jia Yun went in and met Jia Lian because she was inquiring about what was going on. Jia Lian told him, ""Something happened to my former son, but your aunt begged me again and again, and gave it to Jia Qin. He promised me, indicating that there are still a few places to plant flowers and trees in the garden, and we will wait for the project to come out. I'll give it to you."" Jia Yun listened, and after a while said, ""If that's the case, I'll just wait. Uncle doesn't have to ask my aunt to ask me about it today, and it's not too late to talk about it when I get there."" Jia Lian Said: ""What do you do with him? I have time to gossip. I have to go to Xingyi at the fifth watch tomorrow, so I have to come back the same day. You go and wait, the day after tomorrow. After that, you come to ask for a letter, I have no time to spare."" After speaking, he went back to change his clothes.","As soon as he saw Chia Lien, he inquired what business it was that had turned up, and Chia Lien consequently explained: “The other day something did actually present itself, but as it happened that your aunt had again and again entreated me, I gave it to Chia Ch’in; as she promised me that there would be by and by in the garden several other spots where flowers and trees would be planted; and that when this job did occur, she would, for a certainty, give it to you and finish!” Chia Yuen, upon hearing these words, suggested after a short pause; “ If that be so, there’s nothing for me to do than to wait; but, uncle, you too mustn’t make any allusion beforehand in the presence of aunt to my having come to-day to make any inquiries; for there will really be ample time to speak to her when the job turns up!” “Why should I allude to it?” Chia Lien rejoined. “Have I forsooth got all this leisure to talk of irrelevant matters! But to-morrow, besides, I’ve got to go as far as Hsing Yi for a turn, and it’s absolutely necessary that I should hurriedly come back the very same day ; so off with you now and go and wait; and the day after to-morrow, after the watch has been set, come and ask for news; but mind at any earlier hour, I shan’t have any leisure!” With these words, he hastily went at the back to change his clothes.","Let us return to Jia Yun who, after his encounter with Bao-yu, had gone in to see Jia Lian and ask him if there was any prospect of a job. ‘A job turned up only the other day,’ said Jia Lian, ‘but unfortunately your Aunt Feng was very anxious that I should give it to Jia Qin and I’m afraid I let him have it. However, she did mention that there will soon be a lot of planting to do in the garden, and she promised that as soon as that work turns up we shall definitely hand it over to you.’ Jia Yun was silent for some moments, then he said: ‘All right. I’ll just have to go on waiting, then. But would you mind not mentioning this visit to Auntie? I can tell her about it myself, if need be, next time I see her.’ ‘I shan’t mention it,’ said Jia Lian. ‘I’ve got better things to do with my time than go running after her to talk about things like this! Tomorrow I have to go to Xing-yi, by the way. I have to get back on the same day – but perhaps you’d better wait until the day after tomorrow before coming round again. In fact, you’d better wait until the evening of the day after tomorrow – some time after the beginning of the first watch. Any time before that I shall be busy.’ He terminated the interview by going into the inner room to change his clothes."
如今且說雨村，因補授了應天府，一下馬就有一件人命官司詳至案下乃是兩家爭買一婢，各不相讓，以至毆傷人命。彼時雨村即傳原告之人來審。那原告道：「被毆死者乃小人之主人。因那日買了一個丫頭，不想是拐子拐來賣的。這拐子先已得了我家的銀子，我家小爺原說第三日方是好日子，再接入門。這拐子便又悄悄的賣與薛家，被我們知道了，去找拿賣主，奪取丫頭。無奈薛家原係金陵一霸，倚財仗勢，眾豪奴將我小主人竟打死了。兇身主僕已皆逃走，無影無蹤，只剩了幾個局外之人。小人告了一年的狀，竟無人作主。望大老爺拘拿兇犯，剪惡除兇，以救孤寡，死者感戴天恩不盡！」,"Now let's talk about Yucun, because of the supplementary grant of Yingtian Mansion, there is a life lawsuit in the case of a horse. At that time, it was rumored that the plaintiff's person would come to trial. The plaintiff said: ""The person who was beaten and killed is the master of the villain. Because I bought a girl that day, I don't want to be kidnapped to sell it. This kidnapper has already obtained my family's money. In the future, I will enter the door again. This kidnapper quietly sold to the Xue family again. We found out. We went to find the seller and seize the girl. Unfortunately, the Xue family was originally a tyrant in Jinling, relying on money and power, and the tyrants beat my little master unexpectedly. Dead. The murderous master and servant have all fled without a trace, only a few outsiders are left. The villain has been suing for a year, but no one is in charge. I hope the eldest master will arrest the murderer and eliminate the evil Fierce, in order to save the orphans and widows, the deceased are grateful for the grace of Heaven!""","But we will now speak of Chia Yue-ts’un. Having obtained the appointment of Prefect of Ying T’ien, he had no sooner arrived at his post than a charge of manslaughter was laid before his court. This had arisen from some rivalry between two parties in the purchase of a slave-girl, either of whom would not yield his right; with the result that a serious assault occurred, which ended in homicide. Yue-ts’un had, with all promptitude, the servants of the plaintiffs brought before him, and subjected them to an examination. “The victim of the assault,” the plaintiffs deposed, “was your servants’ master. Having on a certain day, purchased a servant-girl, she unexpectedly turned out to be a girl who had been carried away and sold by a kidnapper. This kidnapper had, first of all, got hold of our family’s money, and our master had given out that he would on the third day, which was a propitious day, take her over into the house, but this kidnapper stealthily sold her over again to the Hsueeh family. When we came to know of this, we went in search of the seller to lay hold of him, and bring back the girl by force. But the Hsueeh party has been all along _the_ bully of Chin Ling, full of confidence in his wealth, full of presumption on account of his prestige; and his arrogant menials in a body seized our master and beat him to death. The murderous master and his crew have all long ago made good their escape, leaving no trace behind them, while there only remain several parties not concerned in the affair. Your servants have for a whole year lodged complaints, but there has been no one to do our cause justice, and we therefore implore your Lordship to have the bloodstained criminals arrested, and thus conduce to the maintenance of humanity and benevolence; and the living, as well as the dead, will feel boundless gratitude for this heavenly bounty.”","Let us now turn to the affairs of Jia Yu-cun, newly installed in the yamen at Ying-tian-fu. No sooner had he arrived at his new post than a case involving manslaughter was referred to his tribunal. It concerned two parties in dispute over the purchase of a slave-girl. Neither had been willing to give way to the other, and in the ensuing affray one of the parties had been wounded and had subsequently died. After reading the papers in the case, Yu-cun summoned the plaintiff for questioning and received from him the following account of what had happened: ‘The murdered man was my master, Your Honour. Although he did not realize it at the time, the girl he purchased had been kidnapped by the man who was selling her. My master paid him in advance, and arranged to receive the girl into his house three days from the date of purchase, the third day being a lucky day. The kidnapper, having already pocketed my young master’s money, then quietly went off and sold her again to Xue. When we found this out, we went along to seize him and to collect the girl. ‘But unfortunately this Xue turned out to be a powerful Nanking boss, who evidently thought that by money and influence he could get away with anything. He set a crowd of his henchmen on to my young master and beat him up so badly that he died. ‘Xue and his henchmen have now disappeared without trace, leaving only a few retainers who were not involved in the crime. But though it is a year since I first brought this charge, no one has yet done anything to help me. I beseech Your Honour to arrest the criminals and to uphold the course of justice! Both the living and the dead will be everlastingly grateful to you if you do!’"
王夫人道：「前日聽見你大妹妹說，蓉哥兒媳婦兒身上有些不大好，到底是怎麼樣？」尤氏道：「他這個病得的也奇。上月中秋還跟著老太太、太太們頑了半夜，回家來好好的。到了二十後，一日比一日覺懶，又懶得喫東西，這將近有半個多月了。經期又有兩個月沒來。」邢夫人接著說道：「別是喜罷？」,"Madam Wang said, ""I heard your eldest sister say the other day that Brother Rong's daughter-in-law is not feeling well, what's the matter?"" You said, ""He's also very sick. Last month's Mid-Autumn Festival was with the old lady and wife. We were stubborn in the middle of the night, and it was fine when we came home. After reaching 20, I felt more and more lazy every day, and I was too lazy to eat. It has been more than half a month. The period has not come for another two months.” Mrs. Xing Then he said, ""Don't be happy?""","“The other day I heard your eldest sister explain,” interposed madame Wang, “that Chia Jung’s wife was anything but well; but what’s after all the matter with her?” “She has,” observed Mrs. Yu, “contracted this illness verily in a strange manner! Last moon at the time of the mid-autumn festival, she was still well enough to be able to enjoy herself, during half the night, in company with our dowager lady and madame Wang. On her return, she continued in good health, until after the twentieth, when she began to feel more and more languid every day, and loth, likewise, to eat anything; and this has been going on for well-nigh half a month and more; she hasn’t besides been anything like her old self for two months.” “May she not,” remarked madame Hsing, taking up the thread of the conversation, “be ailing for some happy event?” But while she was uttering these words, some one from outside announced:","Knowing how much Grandma enjoys a bit of fun, I thought it didn’t seem like her not to come today unless she had some good reason for not coming.’ ‘The other day Xi-chun was telling us that Rong’s wife is not very well,’ said Lady Wang. ‘What exactly is wrong with her?’ ‘It’s a very puzzling illness,’ You-shi replied. ‘At Mid-Autumn last month, when she got back from playing cards half the night with you and Lady Jia, she seemed perfectly all right. But from the twentieth onwards she seemed to get more and more tired and listless every day – too tired even to eat. She’s been like that for more than a fortnight now, and it is two months since she had a period.’ ‘Couldn’t she be expecting?’ said Lady Xing. They were interrupted by a servant from outside:"
此時眾婆娘媳婦見無事，都陸續散了，自去歇息，跟前不過幾個心腹常侍小婢，老尼便趁機說道：「我正有一事，要到府裏求太太，先請奶奶一個示下。」鳳姐因問何事。老尼道：「阿彌陀佛！只因當日我先在長安縣內善才庵內出家的時節，那時有個施主姓張，是大財主。他有個女兒小名金哥，那年都往我廟裏來進香，不想遇見了長安府府太爺的小舅子李衙內。那李衙內一心看上，要娶金哥，打發人來求親，不想金哥已受了原任長安守備的公子的聘定。張家若退親，又怕守備不依，因此說已有了人家。誰知李公子執意不依，定要娶他女兒，張家正無計策，兩處為難。不想守備家聽了此信，也不管青紅皂白，便來作踐辱罵，說一個女兒許幾家，偏不許退定禮，就打官司告狀起來。那張家急了，只得著人上京來尋門路，賭氣偏要退定禮。我想如今長安節度雲老爺與府上最契，可以求太太與老爺說聲，打發一封書去，求雲老爺和那守備說一聲，不怕那守備不依。若是肯行，張家連傾家孝順也都情願。」,"At this time, all the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law saw that there was nothing to do, and they all dispersed one after another, and went to rest. There were only a few confidants in front of him who often served the little maids, and the old man took the opportunity to say: ""I have something to do, and I want to go to the mansion to ask my wife, please ask my grandma first. Show me."" Sister Feng asked what was the matter. The old nun said: ""Amitabha! It's just because I first became a monk in the Shancai Nunnery in Chang'an County. At that time, there was a benefactor named Zhang, who was a rich man. He had a daughter named Jin Ge, who came to me that year. When I came to the temple, I didn't want to meet Li Yanei, the brother-in-law of the grandfather of the Chang'an mansion. Then Li Yanei wanted to marry Brother Jin and sent someone to ask for relatives. If the Zhang family withdraws from their relatives, they are afraid that the guards will not rely on them, so they say that they already have someone else. Who knows that Li Gongzi insists on not relying on him and will marry his daughter. Then he came to practice and insulted, saying that a daughter of several families was not allowed to withdraw the fixed ceremony, so they filed a lawsuit. The Zhang family was in a hurry, so they had to go to Beijing to find a way, and they wanted to withdraw from the fixed ceremony. Master Yun has the best relationship with the mansion, you can ask your wife to talk to the master, send a book, and ask Master Yun to talk to the guard, not afraid of the guard.","By this time, all the matrons and married women discovered that there was nothing else to be done, and they dispersed in succession, retiring each to rest. There only remained in attendance several young girls who enjoyed her confidence, and the old nun speedily availed herself of the opportunity to speak. “I’ve got something,” she said, “about which I mean to go to your mansion to beg of madame Wang; but I’ll first request you, my lady, to tell me how to set to work.” “What’s it?” ascertained lady Feng. “O-mi-to-fu!” exclaimed the old nun, “ It’s this; in days gone by, I first lived in the Ch’ang An district. When I became a nun and entered the monastery of Excellent Merit, there lived, at that time, a subscriber, Chang by surname, a very wealthy man. He had a daughter, whose infant name was Chin Ko; the whole family came in the course of that year to the convent I was in, to offer incense, and as luck would have it they met Li Ya-nei, a brother of a secondary wife of the Prefect of the Ch’ang An Prefecture. This Li Ya-nei fell in love at first sight with her, and would wed Chin Ko as his wife. He sent go-betweens to ask her in marriage, but, contrary to his expectations, Chin Ko had already received the engagement presents of the son of the ex-Major of the Ch’ang An Prefecture. The Chang family, on the other hand, were afraid that if they withdrew from the match, the Major would not give up his claim, and they therefore replied that she was already promised to another. But, who would have thought it, this Mr. Li was seriously bent upon marrying the young lady. But while the Chang family were at a loss what plan to devise, and both parties were in a dilemma, the family of the Major came unexpectedly to hear of the news; and without even looking thoroughly into the matter, they there and then had recourse to insult and abuse. ‘Is a girl,’ they insinuated, ‘to be promised to the sons of several families!’ And obstinately refusing to allow the restitution of the betrothal presents, they at once had recourse to litigation and brought an action (against the girl’s people.) That family was at their wits’ end, and had no alternative but to find some one to go to the capital to obtain means of assistance; and, losing all patience, they insisted upon the return of the presents. I believe that the present commander of the troops at Ch’ang An, Mr. Yuen, is on friendly terms with your honourable family, and could one solicit madame Wang to put in a word with Mr. Chia Cheng to send a letter and ask Mr. Yuen to speak to that Major, I have no fear that he will not agree. Should (your ladyship) be willing to take action, the Chang family are even ready to present all they have, though it may entail the ruin of their estate.”","By this time the older servants, seeing that there was nothing further for them to do, had one by one drifted off to bed, leaving only a few personal maids, all of whom were in Xi-feng’s confidence, in attendance. The old nun deemed it safe to broach a private matter in their hearing. ‘There is something I have been meaning to call at your house and ask Her Ladyship about, but I should like to have your opinion on it first before I see her.’ ‘What do you want to ask her?’ said Xi-feng. ‘Bless his Holy Name!’ the prioress began piously. ‘When I was a nun at the Treasures in Heaven Convent in Chang-an, one of the convent’s benefactors was a very wealthy man called Zhang, who had a daughter called Jin-ge. A certain young Mr Li, who is brother-in-law to the Governor of Chang-an, met her once when she was making an incense-offering in our temple and took a violent liking to her. He at once sent someone to the parents to ask for her hand in marriage, but unfortunately she was already betrothed to the son of a captain in the Chang-an garrison and the betrothal-presents had already been accepted. The Zhangs would have liked to cancel the betrothal but were afraid that the captain would object, so they told Li’s matchmaker that the girl was already engaged. But oh dear! young Mr Li wouldn’t take no for an answer, and the Zhangs were quite at their wit’s end, being now in trouble with both parties. You see, when the captain got to hear of these goings-on he was most unreasonable. He came rushing along in a great rage and made a most terrible scene. “Just how many young men is this girl betrothed to ? ” he said, and so on and so forth. He refused outright to take back the betrothal-gifts and straightway began an action for breach of promise. By now the Zhangs were really upset and sent to the capital for some moral support for they are now quite determined to break off their daughter’s engagement, seeing that the captain has been so unreasonable. ‘Well, it occurred to me that the Area Commander for Chang-an, “General Yun, is on very good terms with your husband’s family, and I thought I might try to find some way of persuading Her Ladyship to talk to Sir Zheng about this and get him to write a letter to General Yun and ask him to have a word with this captain. It is hardly likely that he would refuse to obey his commanding officer."
話說寶玉見收拾了外書房，約定與秦鍾讀夜書。偏那秦鍾秉賦最弱，因在郊外受了些風霜，又與智能兒偷期綣繾，未免失於調養，回來時便咳嗽傷風，懶進飲食，大有不勝之態，遂不敢出門，只在家中養息。寶玉便掃了興頭，只得付於無可奈何，且自靜候大癒時再約。,"It is said that Baoyu has packed the outer study and agreed to read Ye Shu with Qin Zhong. On the other hand, Qin Zhong had the weakest talent. Because he had suffered some wind and frost in the suburbs, and had a period of time with Zhizhi, he had not been able to recuperate. When he came back, he had a cough and cold, and he was too lazy to eat and drink. Rest at home only. Baoyu was disappointed, so he had no choice but to make an appointment when he waited for a big recovery.","But we must now return to the two lads, Ch’in Chung and Pao-yue. After they had passed, along with lady Feng from the Temple of the Iron Fence, whither she had gone to see how things were getting on, they entered the city in their carriages. On their arrival at home, they paid their obeisance to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and the other members of the family, whence they returned to their own quarters, where nothing worth mentioning transpired during the night. On the next day, Pao-yue perceiving that the repairs to the outer schoolroom had been completed, settled with Ch’in Chung that they should have evening classes. But as it happened that Ch’in Chung, who was naturally of an extremely delicate physique, caught somewhat of a chill in the country and clandestinely indulged, besides, in an intimacy with Chih Neng, which unavoidably made him fail to take good care of himself, he was, shortly after his return, troubled with a cough and a feverish cold, with nausea for drink and food, and fell into such an extremely poor state of health that he simply kept indoors and nursed himself, and was not in a fit condition to go to school. Pao-yue’s spirits were readily damped, but as there was likewise no remedy he had no other course than to wait until his complete recovery, before he could make any arrangements.","to the Imperial Bedchamber And Qin Zhong is summoned for premature departure on the Journey into Night Xi-feng, Qin Zhong and Bao-yu, as we have said, called in at the Temple of the Iron Threshold on their way home. After looking round for a while, the three of them got back into their carriage and continued their journey into the city. Home once more, they first called on Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then went off to their several rooms. But of the rest of that day and the night which followed, our story says nothing. Next morning Bao-yu found that his outer study had now been finished and was ready for use. He looked forward to beginning night-work in it with Qin Zhong, in accordance with a promise they had made each other. But unfortunately Qin Zhong’s always sickly constitution had been much neglected during their two-day excursion into the country, and the unwonted exposure to wind and cold and immoderate indulgence in secret frolic with Sapientia had resulted on his return in a cough and chill accompanied by total loss of appetite. Altogether he presented so sorry a spectacle that study was quite out of the question and they were obliged to send him back home to bed. Although Bao-yu was very disappointed, there was nothing at all he could do but wait for his friend to get better."
這裏尤氏向邢夫人、王夫人道：「太太們在這裏喫飯，還是在園子裏喫去好？小戲兒現預備在園子裏呢。」王夫人向邢夫人道：「我們索性喫了飯再過去罷，也省好些事。」邢夫人道：「很好。」於是尤氏就吩咐媳婦婆子們：「快送飯來。」門外一齊答應了一聲，都各人端各人的去了。不多一時，擺上了飯。尤氏讓邢夫人、王夫人並他母親都上了坐，他與鳳姐兒、寶玉側席坐了。邢夫人、王夫人道：「我們來原為給大老爺拜壽，這不竟是我們來過生日來了麼？」鳳姐兒說道：「大老爺原是好養靜的，已經修煉成了，也算得是神僊了。太太們這麼一說，這就叫作『心到神知』了。」一句話說的滿屋裏的人都笑起來了。,"Here, Mrs. You said to Mrs. Xing and Mrs. Wang, ""Was it better for the ladies to eat here, or in the garden? Xiaoxier is going to be in the garden now."" Mrs. Wang said to Mrs. Xing, ""We simply ate. Let’s go there again, it will save you a lot of trouble.” Madam Xing said, “Very good.” So Mrs. You ordered the daughter-in-law and the mother-in-law: “Quickly bring the meal.” Everyone outside the door agreed, and everyone brought their own food. went. After a while, the meal was served. Mrs. You asked Madam Xing, Madam Wang and his mother to sit, and he sat on the side seats with Sister Feng and Baoyu. Mrs. Xing and Mrs. Wang said, ""We came here to celebrate the birthday of the eldest master. Isn't this our birthday?"" Sister Feng said, ""The eldest master is good for rest, and he has already cultivated. It's a fairy. When the ladies say this, it's called 'heart to know'."" The whole room laughed when he said that.","During this interval, Mrs. Yu addressed herself to mesdames Hsing and Wang; “My ladies,” she asked, “will you have your repast in here, or will you go into the garden for it? There are now in the garden some young actors engaged in making their preparations?” “It’s better in here,” madame Wang remarked, as she turned towards madame Hsing. Mrs. Yu thereupon issued directions to the married women and matrons to be quick in serving the eatables. The servants, in waiting outside the door, with one voice signified their obedience; and each of them went off to fetch what fell to her share. In a short while, the courses were all laid out, and Mrs. Yu pressed mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well as her mother, into the upper seats; while she, together with lady Feng and Pao-yue, sat at a side table. “We’ve come,” observed mesdames Hsing and Wang, “with the original idea of paying our congratulations to our venerable senior on the occasion of his birthday; and isn’t this as if we had come for our own birthdays?” “The old gentleman,” answered lady Feng, “is a man fond of a quiet life; and as he has already consummated a process of purification, he may well be looked upon as a supernatural being, so that the purpose to which your ladyships have given expression may be considered as manifest to his spirit, upon the very advent of the intention.” As this sentence was uttered the whole company in the room burst out laughing.","‘Well, ladies!’ said You-shi. ‘Will you have dinner in here, or shall we eat in the garden? There are some actors in the garden preparing an entertainment.’ ‘In here would be all right, wouldn’t it?’ said Lady Wang with a glance in Lady Xing’s direction. You-shi at once gave orders to her women to serve. There was an answering cry from outside the door and a great flurry of domestics each bustling about her own contribution to the meal. In no time at all the table was laid and dinner ready. You-shi made Lady Xing and Lady Wang sit at the head with her mother, while she, Xi-feng and Bao-yu sat at the two sides. Lady Xing and Lady Wang politely protested that they had come to offer birthday felicitations, not to eat a birthday feast. ‘Yes,’ said Xi-feng. ‘After all these years of spiritual self-improvement, Uncle must by now be practically an Immortal. And with Immortals, as we all know, “it’s the thought that counts and not the ceremony”.’ The others all laughed."
周瑞家的因問智能兒：「你是什麼時候來的？你師父那禿歪剌往那裏去了？」智能兒道：「我們一早就來了。我師父見了太太，就往於老爺府內去了，叫我在這裏等他呢。」周瑞家的又道：「十五的月例香供銀子可曾得了沒有？」智能兒搖頭說：「我不知道。」惜春聽說，便問周瑞家的：「如今各廟裏月例銀子是誰管著？」周瑞家的道：「余信管著。」惜春聽了笑道：「這就是了。他師父一來，余信家的就趕上來，和他師父咕唧了半日，想是就為這一事了。」,"The Yin of Zhou Rui's family asked Zhizhi'er, ""When did you come? Where did your master go?"" Zhizhi'er said, ""We came early in the morning. When my master saw his wife, he went to the master's mansion. Go, tell me to wait for him here."" Zhou Rui's family said again, ""Have you ever received silver for the 15th monthly incense offering?"" Zhizhi shook his head and said, ""I don't know."" Xichun heard that and asked Zhou Rui's family. ""Who is in charge of the monthly money in each temple now?"" Zhou Rui's family said, ""Yu Xin is in charge."" Xichun listened with a smile and said, ""That's it. As soon as his master came, Yu Xin's family would catch up with him. Master muttered for a long time, thinking that it was all about this.""","“What time did you come over?” then inquired Mrs. Chou of Chih Neng. “Where is that bald-pated and crotchety superior of yours gone?” “We came,” explained Chih Neng, “as soon as it was day; after calling upon madame Wang, my superior went over to pay a visit in the mansion of Mr. Yue, and told me to wait for her here.” “Have you received,” further asked Mrs. Chou, “the monthly allowance for incense offering due on the fifteenth or not?” “I can’t say,” replied Chih Neng. “Who’s now in charge of the issue of the monthly allowances to the various temples?” interposed Hsi Ch’un, addressing Mrs. Chou, as soon as she heard what was said. “It’s Yue Hsin,” replied Chou Jui’s wife, “who’s intrusted with the charge.” “That’s how it is,” observed Hsi Ch’un with a chuckle; “soon after the arrival of the Superior, Yue Hsin’s wife came over and kept on whispering with her for some time; so I presume it must have been about this allowance.”","‘When did you arrive?’ Zhou Rui’s wife asked Sapientia. ‘ And where’s that precious Mother Superior of yours gone off to, bald-headed old mischief?’ ‘We arrived first thing this morning,’ said Sapientia. ‘ Mother Euergesia went off to visit the Yu mansion after she had seen Her Ladyship. She told me to wait for her here.’ ‘Have you had this month’s donation yet ?’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘It was due on the fifteenth.’ Sapientia said that she didn’t know. ‘Who looks after the monthly donations nowadays?’ asked Xi-chun. ‘Yu Xin,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘That explains it. As soon as Mother Euergesia arrived, Yu Xin’s wife was in here like a shot and they were chattering together for ages. I expect that’s what it was about.’"
雨村因問：「近日都中可有新聞沒有？」子興道：「倒沒有什麼新聞，倒是老先生你貴同宗家，出了一件小小的異事。」雨村笑道：「弟族中無人在都，何談及此？」子興笑道：「你們同姓，豈非同宗一族？」雨村問是誰家。子興道：「榮國府賈府中，可也玷辱了先生的門楣麼？」雨村笑道：「原來是他家。若論起來，寒族人丁卻不少，自東漢賈復以來，支派繁盛，各省皆有，誰逐細考查得來？若論榮國一支，卻是同譜。但他那等榮耀，我們不便去攀扯，至今故越發生疏難認了。」子興嘆道：「老先生休如此說。如今的這寧榮兩門，也都蕭疏了，不比先時的光景。」雨村道：「當日寧榮兩宅的人口也極多，如何就蕭疏了？」冷子興道：「正是，說來也話長。」雨村道：「去歲我到金陵地界，因欲遊覽六朝遺跡，那日進了石頭城，從他老宅門前經過。街東是寧國府，街西是榮國府，二宅相連，竟將大半條街佔了。大門前雖冷落無人，隔著圍牆一望，裏面廳殿樓閣，也還都崢嶸軒峻；就是後一帶花園子裏面樹木山石，也還都有蓊蔚洇潤之氣，那裏象個衰敗之家？」冷子興笑道：「虧你是進士出身，原來不通！古人有云：『百足之蟲，死而不僵。』如今雖說不及先年那樣興盛，較之平常仕宦之家，到底氣象不同。如今生齒日繁，事務日盛，主僕上下，安富尊榮者盡多，運籌謀畫者無一；其日用排場費用，又不能將就省儉，如今外面的架子雖未甚倒，內囊卻也盡上來了。這還是小事。更有一件大事：誰知這樣鍾鳴鼎食之家，翰墨詩書之族，如今的兒孫，竟一代不如一代了！」雨村聽說，也納罕道：「這樣詩禮之家，豈有不善教育之理？別門不知，只說這寧、榮二宅，是最教子有方的。」,"Yumura asked, ""Is there any news in the city recently?"" Zixing said, ""There isn't any news, but it's the old gentleman, you belong to the same clan, and a small strange thing happened."" There is no one in the capital, so why talk about this?"" Zixing laughed, ""You have the same surname, don't they belong to the same clan?"" Yucun asked who it was. Zixing asked, ""Did Jia's house in Rongguo's house also insulted the lintel of Mr. Yu?"" Yucun smiled and said, ""It turned out to be his house. If you think about it, there are quite a few Han people. Since Jia Fu of the Eastern Han Dynasty, the tribe has flourished. It is found in every province, who can find it through detailed examination? If we talk about the Rongguo branch, it is of the same pedigree. However, it is inconvenient for us to discuss his glory. So far, it has become more and more difficult to recognize.” Zixing sighed: “Old man Mr. Xiu said so. Today, the two houses of Ningrong and Rong are also sparsely sparse, not as good as in the past."" Yucun said, ""The population of the two houses of Ningrong was extremely large, so how could they be sparse?"" Leng Zixing said. ""That's right, it's a long story."" Yucun said, ""I went to Jinling Territory last year, because I wanted to visit the ruins of the Six Dynasties, I entered Stone City that day and passed by the gate of his old house. The east of the street is Ningguo Mansion, the west of the street is It is the Rongguo Mansion, and the two houses are connected, and it takes up most of the street. Although there is no one in front of the gate, across the wall, the halls, halls and pavilions are still very tall; You still have the air of radiance and prosperity, and it looks like a decaying family?"" Leng Zixing said with a smile: ""Thanks to your background as a jinshi, it turns out that it doesn't make sense! The ancients said: 'A hundred-footed worm is dead but not stiff.' Now Although it is not as prosperous as in previous years, it is different from the ordinary official's home. Nowadays, people are more and more busy, affairs are flourishing, masters and servants are up and down, there are many people who are prosperous and honorable, and there is no one who plans and draws; Expenses can't be saved and frugal. Although the outer shelf has not collapsed, the inner bag has also been filled up. This is still a small matter. There is a big thing: who would have known such a family of Zhongming Dingshi, a family of calligraphy, poetry and books, today's Children and grandchildren, the generation is not as good as the next generation!"" Yucun heard that, and he said, ""How can such a family of poetry and etiquette not be good at education? Don't know, just say that the two houses of Ning and Rong are the most educated children. .""","The conversation ran on what had occurred after the separation, and Yue-ts’un inquired, “Is there any news of any kind in the capital?” “There’s nothing new whatever,” answered Tzu-hsing. “There is one thing however: in the family of one of your worthy kinsmen, of the same name as yourself, a trifling, but yet remarkable, occurrence has taken place.” “None of my kindred reside in the capital,” rejoined Yue-ts’un with a smile. “To what can you be alluding?” “How can it be that you people who have the same surname do not belong to one clan?” remarked Tzu-hsing, sarcastically. “In whose family?” inquired Yue-ts’un. “The Chia family,” replied Tzu-hsing smiling, “whose quarters are in the Jung Kuo Mansion, does not after all reflect discredit upon the lintel of your door, my venerable friend.” “What!” exclaimed Yue-ts’un, “did this affair take place in that family? Were we to begin reckoning, we would find the members of my clan to be anything but limited in number. Since the time of our ancestor Chia Fu, who lived while the Eastern Han dynasty occupied the Throne, the branches of our family have been numerous and flourishing; they are now to be found in every single province, and who could, with any accuracy, ascertain their whereabouts? As regards the Jung-kuo branch in particular, their names are in fact inscribed on the same register as our own, but rich and exalted as they are, we have never presumed to claim them as our relatives, so that we have become more and more estranged.” “Don’t make any such assertions,” Tzu-hsing remarked with a sigh, “the present two mansions of Jung and Ning have both alike also suffered reverses, and they cannot come up to their state of days of yore.” “Up to this day, these two households of Ning and of Jung,” Yue-ts’un suggested, “still maintain a very large retinue of people, and how can it be that they have met with reverses?” “To explain this would be indeed a long story,” said Leng Tzu-hsing. “Last year,” continued Yue-ts’un , “I arrived at Chin Ling, as I entertained a wish to visit the remains of interest of the six dynasties, and as I on that day entered the walled town of Shih T’ou, I passed by the entrance of that old residence. On the east side of the street, stood the Ning Kuo mansion; on the west the Jung Kuo mansion; and these two, adjoining each other as they do, cover in fact well-nigh half of the whole length of the street. Outside the front gate everything was, it is true, lonely and deserted; but at a glance into the interior over the enclosing wall, I perceived that the halls, pavilions, two-storied structures and porches presented still a majestic and lofty appearance. Even the flower garden, which extends over the whole area of the back grounds, with its trees and rockeries, also possessed to that day an air of luxuriance and freshness, which betrayed no signs of a ruined or decrepid establishment.” “You have had the good fortune of starting in life as a graduate,” explained Tzu-tsing as he smiled, “and yet are not aware of the saying uttered by some one of old: that a centipede even when dead does not lie stiff. (These families) may, according to your version, not be up to the prosperity of former years, but, compared with the family of an ordinary official, their condition anyhow presents a difference. Of late the number of the inmates has, day by day, been on the increase; their affairs have become daily more numerous; of masters and servants, high and low, who live in ease and respectability very many there are; but of those who exercise any forethought, or make any provision, there is not even one. In their daily wants, their extravagances, and their expenditure, they are also unable to adapt themselves to circumstances and practise economy; (so that though) the present external framework may not have suffered any considerable collapse, their purses have anyhow begun to feel an exhausting process! But this is a mere trifle. There is another more serious matter. Would any one ever believe that in such families of official status, in a clan of education and culture, the sons and grandsons of the present age would after all be each (succeeding) generation below the standard of the former?” Yue-ts’un, having listened to these remarks, observed: “How ever can it be possible that families of such education and refinement can observe any system of training and nurture which is not excellent? Concerning the other branches, I am not in a position to say anything; but restricting myself to the two mansions of Jung and Ning, they are those in which, above all others, the education of their children is methodical.”","Presently Yu-cun asked Zi-xing if anything of interest had happened recently in the capital. ‘I can’t think of anything particularly deserving of mention,’ said Zi-xing. ‘Except, perhaps, for a very small but very unusual event that took place in your own clan there.’ ‘What makes you say that?’ said Yu-cun, ‘I have no family connections in the capital.’ ‘Well, it’s the same name,’ said Zi-xing. ‘They must be the same clan.’ Yu-cun asked him what family he could be referring to. ‘I fancy you wouldn’t disown the Jias of the Rong-guo mansion as unworthy of you.’ ‘Oh, you mean them,’ said Yu-cun. ‘There are so many members of my clan, it’s hard to keep up with them all. Since the time of Jia Fu of the Eastern Han dynasty there have been branches of the Jia clan in every province of the empire. The Rong-guo branch is, as a matter of fact, on the same clan register as my own; but since they are exalted so far above us socially, we don’t normally claim the connection, and nowadays we are completely out of touch with them.’ Zi-xing sighed. ‘You shouldn’t speak about them in that way, you know. Nowadays both the Rong and Ning mansions are in a greatly reduced state compared with what they used to be.’ ‘When I was last that way the Rong and Ning mansions both seemed to be fairly humming with life. Surely nothing could have happened to reduce their prosperity in so short a time?’ ‘Ah, you may well ask. But it’s a long story.’ ‘Last time I was in Jinling,’ went on Yu-cun, ‘I passed by their two houses one day on my way to Shi-tou-cheng to visit the ruins. The Ning-guo mansion along the eastern half of the road and the Rong-guo mansion along the western half must between them have occupied the greater part of the north side frontage of that street. It’s true that there wasn’t much activity outside the main entrances, but looking up over the outer walls I had a glimpse of the most magnificent and imposing halls and pavilions, and even the rocks and trees of the gardens beyond seemed to have a sleekness and luxuriance that were certainly not suggestive of a family whose fortunes were in a state of decline.’ ‘Well! For a Palace Graduate Second Class, you ought to know better than that! Haven’t you ever heard the old saying, “The beast with a hundred legs is a long time dying”? Although I say they are not as prosperous as they used to be in years past, of course I don’t mean to say that there is not still a world of difference between their circumstances and those you would expect to find in the household of your average government official. At the moment the numbers of their establishment and the activities they engage in are, if anything, on the increase. Both masters and servants all lead lives of luxury and magnificence. And they still have plenty of plans and projects under way. But they can’t bring themselves to economize or make any adjustment in their accustomed style of living. Consequently, though outwardly they still manage to keep up appearances, inwardly they are beginning to feel the pinch. But that’s a small matter. There’s something much more seriously wrong with them than that. They are not able to turn out good sons, those stately houses, for all their pomp and show. The males in the family get more degenerate from one generation to the next.’ ‘Surely,’ said Yu-cun with surprise, ‘it is inconceivable that such highly cultured households should not give their children the best education possible? I say nothing of other families, but the Jias of the Ning and Rong households used to be famous for the way in which they brought up their sons. How could they come to be as you describe ?’"
紅玉聽了冷笑了兩聲，方要說話，只見一個未留頭的小丫頭子走進來，手裏拿著些花樣子並兩張紙，說道：「這是兩個樣子，叫你描出來呢。」說著向紅玉擲下，回身就跑了。紅玉向外問道：「倒是誰的？也等不得說完就跑，誰蒸下饅頭等著你，怕冷了不成！」那小丫頭在窗外只說得一聲：「是綺大姐姐的。」抬起腳來咕咚咕咚又跑了。紅玉便睹氣把那樣子擲在一邊，向抽屜內找筆，找了半天都是禿了的，因說道：「前兒一枝新筆，放在那裏了？怎麼一時想不起來。」一面說著，一面出神，想了一會方笑道：「是了，前兒晚上鶯兒拿了去了。」便向佳蕙道：「你替我取了來。」佳蕙道：「花大姐姐還等著我替他抬箱子呢，你自己取去罷。」紅玉道：「他等著你，你還坐著閑打牙兒？我不叫你取去，他也不等著你了。壞透了的小蹄子！」說著，自己便出房來，出了怡紅院，一徑往寶釵院內來。,"Hongyu sneered twice before she wanted to speak, but a little girl with no head left came in, holding some flower patterns and two pieces of paper in her hand, and said, ""These are two patterns, I want you to draw them out. ."" He threw it at Ruby, turned around and ran away. Hongyu asked outside, ""Whose is it? You can't wait to finish talking and run away, who will wait for you with steamed buns, I'm afraid of the cold!"" The little girl just said out of the window, ""It's Big Sister Qi's. ."" He raised his foot and ran again. Hongyu threw it aside and looked for a pen in the drawer. After looking for a long time, she was bald. Because she said, ""I have a new pen in the past, where is it? Why can't I remember it for a while."" While thinking for a while, he smiled and said, ""Yes, Ying'er took it last night."" Then he said to Jiahui, ""You brought it for me."" Jiahui said, ""Hua Da My sister is still waiting for me to carry the box for him, so you can take it yourself."" Hong Yu said, ""He's waiting for you, and you're still sitting and grinding your teeth? I won't ask you to take it, and he won't be waiting for you anymore. The little hooves that are so bad!"" After saying that, he walked out of the room, out of Yihong Courtyard, and went straight to Baochai Courtyard.","Hsiao Hung, at these words, gave a couple of sardonic smiles. But when about to pass some remark, she perceived a youthful servant-girl, who had not as yet let her hair grow, walk in, holding in her hands several patterns and two sheets of paper. “You are asked,” she said, “to trace these two designs!” As she spoke, she threw them at Hsiao Hung, and twisting herself round, she immediately scampered away. “Whose are they, after all?” Hsiao Hung inquired, addressing herself outside. “Couldn’t you wait even so much as to conclude what you had to say, but flew off at once? Who is steaming bread and waiting for you? Or are you afraid, forsooth, lest it should get cold?” “They belong to sister Ch’i,” the young servant-girl merely returned for answer from outside the window; and raising her feet high, she ran tramp-tramp on her way back again. Hsiao Hung lost control over her temper, and snatching the designs, she flung them on one side. She then rummaged in a drawer for a pencil, but finding, after a prolonged search, that they were all blunt; “Where did I,” she thereupon ejaculated, “put that brand-new pencil the other day? How is it I can’t remember where it is?” While she soliloquised, she became wrapt in thought. After some reflection she, at length, gave a smile. “Of course!” she exclaimed, “the other evening Ying Erh took it away.” And turning towards Chia Hui, “Fetch it for me,” she shouted. “Sister Hua,” Chia Hui rejoined, “is waiting for me to get a box for her, so you had better go for it yourself !” “What!” remarked Hsiao Hung, “she’s waiting for you, and are you still squatting here chatting leisurely? Hadn’t it been that I asked you to go and fetch it , she too wouldn’t have been waiting for you; you most perverse vixen!” With these words on her lips, she herself walked out of the room, and leaving the I Hung court, she straightway proceeded in the direction of Pao-ch’ai’s court.","Crimson laughed scornfully, though whether at Melilot’s simplicity or at Bao-yu’s improvidence is unclear, since just as she was about to comment, a little maid came running in, so young that her hair was still done up in two little girl’s horns. She was carrying some patterns and sheets of paper. ‘You’re to copy out these two patterns.’ She threw them in Crimson’s direction and straightway darted out again. Crimson shouted after her: ‘Who are they for, then? You might at least finish your message before rushing off. What are you in such a tearing hurry about? Is someone steaming wheatcakes for you and you’re afraid they’ll get cold?’ ‘They’re for Mackerel.’ The little maid paused long enough to bawl an answer through the window, then picking up her heels, went pounding off, plim-plam, plim-plam, plim-plam, as fast as she had come. Crimson threw the patterns crossly to one side and went to hunt in her drawer for a brush to trace them with. After rummaging for several minutes she had only succeeded in finding a few worn-out ones, too moulted for use. ‘Funny!’ she said. ‘I could have sworn I put a new one in there the other day…’ She thought a bit, then laughed at herself as she remembered: ‘Of course. Oriole took it, the evening before last.’ She turned to Melilot. ‘Would you go and get it for me, then?’ ‘I’m afraid I can’t,’ said Melilot. ‘Miss Aroma’s waiting for me to fetch some boxes for her. You’ll have to get it yourself.’ ‘If Aroma’s waiting for you, why have you been sitting here gossiping all this time?’ said Crimson. ‘If I hadn’t asked you to go and get it, she wouldn’t have been waiting, would she? Lazy little beast!’ She left the room and walked out of the gate of Green Delights and in the direction of Bao-chai’s courtyard."

When she heard him being called, she rushed out of Weiwei, but Concubine Zhao didn't dare to say anything.","Chia Huan had ever been in greater fear and trembling of lady Feng, than of madame Wang, so that when her summons reached his ear, he hurriedly went out, while Mrs. Chao, on the other hand, did not venture to breathe a single word.","Jia Huan had always been afraid of Xi-feng – more even than he was of Lady Wang – and hearing her call him, came running out immediately. Aunt Zhao dared not say a word."
正說，只見寶釵走進來笑道：「偏了我們新鮮東西了。」寶玉笑道：「姐姐家的東西，自然先偏了我們了。」寶釵搖頭笑道：「昨兒哥哥倒特特的請我喫，我不喫，叫他留著請人送人罷。我知道我的命小福薄，不配喫那個。」說著，丫鬟倒了茶來，喫茶說閑話兒，不在話下。,"Just as he was talking, Baochai walked in and said with a smile, ""It's biased against our new stuff."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""The stuff from my sister's house naturally biased us first."" He specially invited me to eat it, but I didn’t want to eat it, and asked him to keep it for someone to give away. I know that my life is small and I don’t deserve to eat that.” After speaking, the maid poured the tea and wentssiped about it. .","“Have you tasted any of our new things?” she asked, a smile curling her lips. “Cousin,” laughed Pao-yue, “you must have certainly tasted what you’ve got in your house long before us.” Pao-ch’ai shook her head and smiled. “Yesterday,” she said, “my brother did actually make it a point to ask me to have some; but I had none; I told him to keep them and send them to others, so confident am I that with my mean lot and scanty blessings I little deserve to touch such dainties.” As she spoke, a servant-girl poured her a cup of tea and brought it to her.","At that moment Bao-chai walked in, all smiles. ‘I hear you’ve made a start on the famous present,’ she said. ‘But surely you and your family must have had some already?’ said Bao-yu. Bao-chai shook her head: ‘Pan was very pressing that I should have some, but I refused. I told him to save it for other people. I know I’m not really the right sort of person for such superior delicacies. If I were to eat any, I should be afraid of some frightful nemesis overtaking me.’ A maid poured tea for her as she spoke, and conversation of a desultory kind proceeded between sips."
原來賈瑞父母早亡，衹有他祖父代儒教養。那代儒素日教訓最嚴，不許賈瑞多走一步，生怕他在外喫酒賭錢，有誤學業。今忽見他一夜不歸，只料定他在外非飲即賭，嫖娼宿妓，那裏想到這段公案，因此氣了一夜。賈瑞也捻著一把汗，少不得回來撒謊，只說：「往舅舅家去了，天黑了，留我住了一夜。」代儒道：「自來出門，非稟我不敢擅出，如何昨日私自去了？據此亦該打，何況是撒謊。」因此，發狠到底打了三四十板，還不許喫早飯，令他跪在院內讀文章，定要補出十天的工課來方罷。賈瑞直凍了一夜，今又遭了苦打，且餓著肚子，跪著在風地裏讀文章，其苦萬狀。,"It turned out that Jia Rui's parents died early, and only his grandfather brought up Confucianism. That generation of Confucianism was the most strict, and Jia Rui was not allowed to take one more step, for fear that he would make a mistake in his studies by drinking and gambling outside. Today, I suddenly saw him not coming home overnight, and I only expected him to be out drinking or gambling, visiting prostitutes, and thinking about this koan case, so I was angry all night. Jia Rui was also sweating. He had to come back and lie. He only said, ""I went to my uncle's house. It was getting dark, so I stayed overnight."" , why did you go privately yesterday? According to this, you should fight, not to mention lying."" Therefore, Fa Ruhen hit thirty or forty boards in the end, and he was not allowed to eat breakfast, so he was made to kneel in the courtyard to read the article, and he must make up ten days of work. The class is coming. Jia Rui froze all night, and now he was beaten hard again. He was hungry, kneeling in the wind and reading the article.","Chia Jui’s parents had, it must be explained, departed life at an early period, and he had no one else, besides his grandfather Tai-ju, to take charge of his support and education. This Tai-ju had, all along, exercised a very strict control, and would not allow Chia Jui to even make one step too many, in the apprehension that he might gad about out of doors drinking and gambling, to the neglect of his studies. Seeing, on this unexpected occasion, that he had not come home the whole night, he simply felt positive, in his own mind, that he was certain to have run about, if not drinking, at least gambling, and dissipating in houses of the demi-monde up to the small hours; but he never even gave so much as a thought to the possibility of a public scandal, as that in which he was involved. The consequence was that during the whole length of the night he boiled with wrath. Chia Jui himself, on the other hand, was (in such a state of trepidation) that he could wipe the perspiration (off his face) by handfuls; and he felt constrained on his return home, to have recourse to deceitful excuses, simply explaining that he had been at his eldest maternal uncle’s house, and that when it got dark, they kept him to spend the night there. “Hitherto,” remonstrated Tai-ju, “when about to go out of doors, you never ventured to go, on your own hook, without first telling me about it, and how is it that yesterday you surreptitiously left the house? for this offence alone you deserve a beating, and how much more for the lie imposed upon me.” Into such a violent fit of anger did he consequently fly that laying hands on him, he pulled him over and administered to him thirty or forty blows with a cane. Nor would he allow him to have anything to eat, but bade him remain on his knees in the court conning essays; impressing on his mind that he would not let him off, before he had made up for the last ten days’ lessons. Chia Jui had in the first instance, frozen the whole night, and, in the next place, came in for a flogging. With a stomach, besides, gnawed by the pangs of hunger, he had to kneel in a place exposed to drafts reading the while literary compositions, so that the hardships he had to endure were of manifold kinds.","Jia Rui had lost both of his parents in infancy and had been brought up under the sole guardianship of his grandfather Jia Dai-ru. Obsessed by the fear that once outside the house his grandson might indulge in drinking and gambling to the detriment of his studies, Dai-ru had subjected him since early youth to an iron discipline from which not the slightest deviation was tolerated. Seeing him now suddenly absent himself a whole night from home, and being incapable, in his wildest imaginings, of guessing what had really happened, he took it as a foregone conclusion that he had been either drinking or gaming and had probably passed the night in some house of prostitution – a supposition which caused the old gentleman to spend the whole night in a state of extreme choler. The prospect of facing his grandfather on arrival made Jia Rui sweat. A lie of some sort was indispensable. ‘I went to see Uncle yesterday he managed to say, ‘and as it was getting dark, he asked me to stay the night.’ ‘I have always told you that you are not to go out of that gate without first informing me,’ said his grandfather. ‘Why then did you presume to go off on your own yesterday without saying a word to anybody ? That in itself would constitute sufficient grounds for chastisement. But in addition to that you are lying !’ Thereupon he forced him to the ground, and, with the utmost savagery, dealt him thirty or forty whacks with the bamboo, after which he forbade him to eat and made him kneel in the open courtyard with a book in his hand until he had prepared the equivalent of ten days’ homework. The exquisite torments suffered by Jia Rui, as he knelt with an empty stomach in the draughty courtyard reciting his homework after having already been fro2en all night long and then beaten, can be imagined. Yet even now his infatuation remained unaltered."

如今且說賈元春，因在宮中自編大觀園題詠之後，忽想起那大觀園中景緻，自己幸過之後，賈政必定敬謹封鎖，不敢使人進去騷擾，豈不寥落。況家中現有幾個能詩會賦的姊妹，何不命他們進去居住，也不使佳人落魄，花柳無顏。卻又想到寶玉自幼在姊妹叢中長大，不比別的兄弟，若不命他進去，只怕他冷清了，一時不大暢快，未免賈母王夫人愁慮，須得也命他進園居住方妙。想畢，遵命太監夏守忠到榮國府來下一道諭，命寶釵等只管在園中居住，不可禁約封錮，命寶玉仍隨進去讀書。,"Now let’s talk about Jia Yuanchun, because after composing the inscription in the Grand View Garden in the palace, he suddenly remembered the scenery in the Grand View Garden. After he was fortunate, Jia Zheng must be respectful and blocked, and he would not dare to let people go in to harass him, wouldn’t it be rare. There are a few sisters in the Kuang family who can compose poetry, so why not order them to live there, and not make the beautiful woman look down on her face. But he also thought that Baoyu had grown up among his sisters since he was a child, and he was no better than other brothers. If he was not allowed to enter, I would be afraid that he would be deserted and would not be happy for a while, which would be worrying for Madam Jia Muwang, so she had to order him to live in the garden. Fang Miao. After thinking about it, he ordered the eunuch Xia Shouzhong to go to the Rongguo Mansion to issue an edict, ordering Baochai and others to live in the garden and not forbid the contract and seal, and ordered Baoyu to go in and study.","When she had arranged the verses composed in the park of Broad Vista in their order of merit, she suddenly recollected that the sights in the garden were sure, ever since her visit through them, to be diligently and respectfully kept locked up by her father and mother; and that by not allowing any one to go in was not an injustice done to this garden? “Besides,” (she pondered), “in that household, there are at present several young ladies, capable of composing odes, and able to write poetry, and why should not permission be extended to them to go and take their quarters in it; in order too that those winsome persons might not be deprived of good cheer, and that the flowers and willows may not lack any one to admire them!” But remembering likewise that Pao-yue had from his infancy grown up among that crowd of female cousins, and was such a contrast to the rest of his male cousins that were he not allowed to move into it , he would, she also apprehended, be made to feel forlorn; and dreading lest his grandmother and his mother should be displeased at heart , she thought it imperative that he too should be permitted to take up his quarters inside, so that things should be put on a satisfactory footing; and directing the eunuch Hsia Chung to go to the Jung mansion and deliver her commands, she expressed the wish that Pao-ch’ai and the other girls should live in the garden and that it should not be kept closed, and urged that Pao-yue should also shift into it, at his own pleasure, for the prosecution of his studies. And Chia Cheng and madame Wang, upon receiving her commands, hastened, after the departure of Hsia Chung, to explain them to dowager lady Chia, and to despatch servants into the garden to tidy every place, to dust, to sweep, and to lay out the portieres and bed-curtains.","Yuan-chun’s editing of the Prospect Garden poems had given her a vivid recollection of the garden’s beauties. She was sure that her father, out of a zealous reverence for the Emperor and herself, would have kept it all locked and closed since her visit and would have allowed no one else to enter, and she felt this to be a waste and a shame – the more so when her family contained so many poetical young ladies who would have found inspiration in its scenery – not to mention the benefit their presence would have bestowed on the garden itself: for, as is well-known, When lovely woman smiles not, All Nature’s charms are dead. Assuredly, the girls must be allowed into the garden. It should become their home. And if the girls, why not Bao-yu ? He had grown up in their midst. He was different from other boys. If he were not allowed into the garden as well, he would consider himself left out in the cold, and his distress would cause Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia to feel unhappy too. Unquestionably she should ask for him to be admitted along with the girls. Having reached this decision, she summoned the eunuch Xia Bing-zhong and ordered him to convey the following Edict to Rong-guo House: Bao-chai and the other young ladies of the household are to reside in the Garden. The Garden is not to be kept closed. Bao-yu is to accompany the young ladies into the Garden and to continue his studies there."
須臾茶畢，早已設下杯盤，那美酒佳餚自不必說。二人歸坐，先是款斟漫飲，次漸談至興濃，不覺飛觥限斝起來。當時街坊上家家簫管，戶戶弦歌，當頭一輪明月，飛彩凝輝，二人愈添豪興，酒到杯乾。雨村此時已有七八分酒意，狂興不禁，乃對月寓懷，口號一絕云：「時逢三五便團圓，滿把晴光護玉欄。天上一輪纔捧出，人間萬姓仰頭看。」,"After the tea is over, the cups and plates have already been set, and there is no need to say about the delicious food and wine. The two returned to their seats, first pouring out a drink, and gradually talking about it until it became more and more prosperous. At that time, every family in the neighborhood played a flute pipe, and every household sang a song. When the first round of the bright moon was shining, the two became more and more arrogant, and the wine was dry. At this time, Yucun was already drinking seven or eight points, and he couldn't help but feel madly excited. He was embracing the moon. Look up.""","The cups and dishes had been laid from an early hour, and needless to say the wines were luscious; the fare sumptuous. The two friends took their seats. At first they leisurely replenished their glasses, and quietly sipped their wine; but as, little by little, they entered into conversation, their good cheer grew more genial, and unawares the glasses began to fly round, and the cups to be exchanged. At this very hour, in every house of the neighbourhood, sounded the fife and lute, while the inmates indulged in music and singing. Above head, the orb of the radiant moon shone with an all-pervading splendour, and with a steady lustrous light, while the two friends, as their exuberance increased, drained their cups dry so soon as they reached their lips. Yue-ts’un, at this stage of the collation, was considerably under the influence of wine, and the vehemence of his high spirits was irrepressible. As he gazed at the moon, he fostered thoughts, to which he gave vent by the recital of a double couplet. ‘Tis what time three meets five, Selene is a globe!","Wine and various choice dishes were brought in and placed on the table, already laid out with cups, plates, and so forth, and the two men took their places and began to drink. At first they were rather slow and ceremonious; but gradually, as the conversation grew more animated, their potations too became more reckless and uninhibited. The sounds of music and singing which could now be heard from every house in the neighbourhood and the full moon which shone with cold brilliance overhead seemed to increase their elation, so that the cups were emptied almost as soon as they touched their lips, and Yu-cun, who was already a sheet or so in the wind, was seized with an irrepressible excitement to which he presently gave expression in the form of a quatrain, ostensibly on the subject of the moon, but really about the ambition he had hitherto been at some pains to conceal: ‘In thrice five nights her perfect O is made, Whose cold light bathes each marble balustrade. As her bright wheel starts on its starry ways, On earth ten thousand heads look up and gaze.’"
寶玉一面收書，一面笑道：「正經快把花埋了罷，別提那個了。」二人便收拾落花，正纔掩埋妥協，只見襲人走來，說道：「那裏沒找到，摸在這裏來。那邊大老爺身上不好，姑娘們都過去請安，老太太叫打發你去呢。快回去換衣裳去罷。」寶玉聽了，忙拿了書，別了黛玉，同襲人回房換衣不提。,"As Baoyu collected the book, he smiled and said, ""Seriously, I'm about to bury the flowers, don't mention that."" The two of them packed up the fallen flowers, and just before they buried the compromise, they saw an attacker coming and said, ""I didn't find it there, I found it here. Come on. The eldest man over there is not well, the girls are all over to greet you, and the old lady told you to go. Go back and change your clothes."" Baoyu listened, hurriedly grabbed the book, said goodbye to Daiyu, and returned with Xiren. No room to change clothes.","Pao-yue smiled and put his book away, urging: “Let’s do what’s right and proper, and at once take the flowers and bury them; and don’t let us allude to these things!” Forthwith the two of them gathered the fallen blossoms; but no sooner had they interred them properly than they espied Hsi Jen coming, who went on to observe: “Where haven’t I looked for you? What! have you found your way as far as this! But our senior master, Mr. Chia She, over there isn’t well; and the young ladies have all gone over to pay their respects, and our old lady has asked that you should be sent over; so go back at once and change your clothes!” When Pao-yue heard what she said, he hastily picked up his books, and saying good bye to Tai-yue, he came along with Hsi Jen, back into his room, where we will leave him to effect the necessary change in his costume.","Bao-yu took back the book from her with a good-natured laugh: ‘Never mind about all that now! Let’s get on with this flower-burying!’ And the two of them set about sweeping together the fallen flower-petals and putting them into the bag. They had just finished burying it when Aroma came hurrying up to them: ‘So there you are! I’ve been looking for you everywhere. Your Uncle She isn’t well and the young ladies have all gone over to visit him. Her Old Ladyship says you are to go as well. You’d better come back straight away and get changed!’ Bao-yu picked up his book, took leave of Dai-yu, and accompanied Aroma back to his room. And there, for the moment, we shall leave him."

說畢，命賈珍在前引導，自己扶了寶玉，逶迤進入山口。抬頭忽見山上有鏡面白石一塊，正是迎面留題處。賈政回頭笑道：「諸公請看，此處題以何名方妙？」眾人聽說，也有說該題「疊翠」二字。也有說該題「錦嶂」的，又有說「賽香爐」的，又有說「小終南」的，種種名色，不止幾十個。原來眾客心中早知賈政要試寶玉的功業進益如何，只將些俗套來敷衍。寶玉亦料定此意。賈政聽了，便回頭命寶玉擬來。寶玉道：「嘗聞古人有云：『編新不如述舊，刻古終勝雕今。』況此處並非主山正景，原無可題之處，不過是探景一進步耳。莫若直書『曲徑通幽處』這句舊詩在上，倒還大方氣派。」眾人聽了，都讚道：「是極！二世兄天分高，纔情遠，不似我們讀腐了書的。」賈政笑道：「不可謬獎。他年小，不過以一知充十用，取笑罷了。再俟選擬。」,"After he finished speaking, he ordered Jia Zhen to lead the way, helped Baoyu himself, and entered the mountain pass. When I looked up, I saw a mirror-faced white stone on the mountain, which was the place where the question was left. Jia Zheng turned his head and said with a smile, ""Look, gentlemen, what is the name Fangmiao called here?"" Everyone heard that the word ""Piancui"" was also mentioned. There are also people who say that the title is ""Jinzhang"", some people who say ""race incense burner"", and some people who say ""Xiao Zhongnan"", there are more than dozens of various names and colors. It turned out that all the guests had long known how Jia Zheng wanted to try Baoyu's achievements, and they only perfunctory some clichés. Baoyu also expected this. When Jia Zheng heard this, he turned around and ordered Baoyu to come. Baoyu said: ""I heard a saying in the ancients: ""It is better to write the new than to describe the old, and to carve the old is worse than to carve the present."" This is not the main scene of the main mountain. The old poem ""A winding path leads to a secluded place"" is above, but it's quite generous."" When everyone heard it, they all praised: ""Extremely! The second brother is very talented and far-reaching, it's not like we read a rotten book. Yes."" Jia Zheng smiled and said, ""The award is unreasonable. He is young, but he uses his knowledge to make fun of it. We will choose it later.""","Having finished speaking, he asked Chia Chen to lead the way; and he himself, leaning on Pao-yue, walked into the gorge with leisurely step. Raising his head, he suddenly beheld on the hill a block of stone, as white as the surface of a looking-glass, in a site which was, in very deed, suitable to be left for an inscription, as it was bound to meet the eye. “Gentlemen,” Chia Cheng observed, as he turned his head round and smiled, “please look at this spot. What name will it be fit to give it?” When the company heard his remark, some maintained that the two words “Heaped verdure” should be written; and others upheld that the device should be “Embroidered Hill.” Others again suggested: “Vying with the Hsiang Lu;” and others recommended “the small Chung Nan.” And various kinds of names were proposed, which did not fall short of several tens. All the visitors had been, it must be explained, aware at an early period of the fact that Chia Cheng meant to put Pao-yue ’s ability to the test, and for this reason they merely proposed a few combinations in common use. But of this intention, Pao-yue himself was likewise cognizant. After listening to the suggestions, Chia Cheng forthwith turned his head round and bade Pao-yue think of some motto. “I’ve often heard,” Pao-yue replied, “that writers of old opine that it’s better to quote an old saying than to compose a new one; and that an old engraving excels in every respect an engraving of the present day. What’s more, this place doesn’t constitute the main hill or the chief feature of the scenery, and is really no site where any inscription should be put, as it no more than constitutes the first step in the inspection of the landscape. Won’t it be well to employ the exact text of an old writer consisting of ‘a tortuous path leading to a secluded (nook).’ This line of past days would, if inscribed, be, in fact, liberal to boot.” After listening to the proposed line, they all sang its praise. “First-rate! excellent!” they cried, “the natural talents of your second son, dear friend, are lofty; his mental capacity is astute; he is unlike ourselves, who have read books but are simple fools.” “You shouldn’t,” urged Chia Cheng smilingly , “heap upon him excessive praise; he’s young in years, and merely knows one thing which he turns to the use of ten purposes; you should laugh at him, that’s all; but we can by and by choose some device.”","He ordered Cousin Zhen to lead the way, and leaning on Bao-yu’s shoulder, began the winding ascent of the little mountain. Suddenly on the mountainside above his head, he noticed a white rock whose surface had been polished to mirror smoothness and realized that this must be one of the places which had been prepared for an inscription. ‘Aha, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng turning back to address the others who were climbing up behind him. ‘ What name are we going to choose for this mountain?’ ‘Emerald Heights,’ said one. ‘Embroidery Hill,’ said another. Another proposed that they should call it ‘Little Censer’ after the famous Censer Peak in Kiangsi. Another proposed ‘Little Zhong-nan’. Altogether some twenty or thirty names were suggested – none of them very seriously, since the literary gentlemen were aware that Jia Zheng intended to test Bao-yu and were anxious not to make the boy’s task too difficult. Bao-yu understood and was duly grateful. When no more names were forthcoming Jia Zheng turned to Bao-yu and asked him to propose something himself. ‘I remember reading in some old book,’ said Bao-yu, ‘that “to recall old things is better than to invent new ones; and to recut an ancient text is better than to engrave a modern”. We ought, then, to choose something old. But as this is not the garden’s principal “mountain ” or its chief vista, strictly speaking there is no justification for having an inscription here at all – unless it is to be something which implies that this is merely a first step towards more important things ahead. I suggest we should call it “Pathway to Mysteries” after the line in Chang Jian’s poem about the mountain temple: A path winds upwards to mysterious places. A name like that would be more distinguished.’ There was a chorus of praise from the literary gentlemen: ‘Exactly right! Wonderful! Our young friend with his natural talent and youthful imagination succeeds immediately where we old pedants fail!’ Jia Zheng gave a deprecatory laugh: ‘You mustn’t flatter the boy! People of his age are adept at making a little knowledge go a long way. I only asked him as a joke, to see what he would say. We shall have to think of a better name later on.’"
周瑞家的聽了，方出去引他兩個進入院來。上了正房臺磯，小丫頭打起猩紅氈簾，纔入堂屋，只聞一陣香撲了臉來，竟不辨是何氣味，身子如在雲端裏一般，滿屋中之物都耀眼爭光的，使人頭暈目眩。劉姥姥此時惟點頭咂嘴唸佛而已。於是來至東邊這間屋內，乃是賈璉的女兒大姐兒睡覺之所。平兒站在炕沿邊，打量了劉姥姥兩眼，只得問個好讓坐。劉姥姥見平兒徧身綾羅，插金帶銀，花容玉貌的，便當是鳳姐兒了。纔要稱姑奶奶，忽見周瑞家的稱他是平姑娘，又見平兒趕著周瑞家的稱周大娘，方知不過是個有些體面的丫頭。於是讓劉姥姥和板兒上了炕，平兒和周瑞家的對面坐在炕沿上，小丫頭子斟了茶來喫茶。,"When Zhou Rui's family heard it, Fang went out and led the two of them into the courtyard. Going to the main room in Taiji, the little girl opened the scarlet felt curtain before entering the main room. She only smelled a fragrance and rushed to her face, but she couldn't tell what the smell was. , dizzying. Grandma Liu just nodded and smacked her lips in chanting. So I came to this room to the east, where Jia Lian's daughter, the elder sister, slept. Ping'er stood on the edge of the kang, looked at Grandma Liu, and had to ask to be seated. Grandma Liu saw that Ping'er was covered in silk, gold and silver, and she was beautiful, so she was Fengjie's bento. Just want to call her auntie, and suddenly see Zhou Rui's family calling him Ping girl, and see Ping'er rushing Zhou Rui's family to call him Aunt Zhou, Fang Zhi is just a decent girl. So Grandma Liu and Ban'er got on the kang, Ping'er and Zhou Rui's house sat on the edge of the kang opposite, and the little girl poured tea and ate it.","lady Feng’s arrival), when all would be right. Chou Jui’s wife thereupon went out and led them in. When they ascended the steps of the main apartment, a young waiting-maid raised a red woollen portiere, and as soon as they entered the hall, they smelt a whiff of perfume as it came wafted into their faces: what the scent was they could not discriminate; but their persons felt as if they were among the clouds. The articles of furniture and ornaments in the whole room were all so brilliant to the sight, and so vying in splendour that they made the head to swim and the eyes to blink, and old goody Liu did nothing else the while than nod her head, smack her lips and invoke Buddha. Forthwith she was led to the eastern side into the suite of apartments, where was the bedroom of Chia Lien’s eldest daughter. P’ing Erh, who was standing by the edge of the stove-couch, cast a couple of glances at old goody Liu, and felt constrained to inquire how she was, and to press her to have a seat. Goody Liu, noticing that P’ing Erh was entirely robed in silks, that she had gold pins fixed in her hair, and silver ornaments in her coiffure, and that her countenance resembled a flower or the moon (in beauty), readily imagined her to be lady Feng, and was about to address her as my lady; but when she heard Mrs. Chou speak to her as Miss P’ing, and P’ing Erh promptly address Chou Jui ’s wife as Mrs. Chou, she eventually became aware that she could be no more than a waiting-maid of a certain respectability. She at once pressed old goody Liu and Pan Erh to take a seat on the stovecouch. P’ing Erh and Chou Jui ’s wife sat face to face, on the edges of the couch. The waiting-maids brought the tea.","Zhou Rui’s wife went off again to fetch her charges. As they ascended the steps to the main reception room, a little maid lifted up the red carpet which served as a portiere for them to enter. A strange, delicious fragrance seemed to reach forward and enfold them as they entered, producing in Grannie Liu the momentary sensation that she had been transported bodily to one of the celestial paradises. Their eyes, too, were dazzled by the bright and glittering things that filled the room. Temporarily speechless with wonder, Grannie Liu stood wagging her head, alternating clicks of admiration with pious ejaculations. From the glittering reception room they passed to a room on the east side of it in which Jia Lian’s baby daughter slept. Patience, who was standing by the edge of the kang, made a rapid assessment of Grannie Liu and judged it sufficient to greet her with a civil ‘how-do-you-do’ and an invitation to be seated. Grannie Liu looked at the silks and satins in which Patience was dressed, the gold and silver ornaments in her hair, her beauty of feature which in every respect corresponded with what she had been told of Wang Xi-feng, and taking the maid for the mistress, was on the point of greeting her as ‘Gou-er’s aunt’, when Zhou Rui’s wife introduced her as’ Miss Patience’. Then, when Patience shortly afterwards addressed Zhou Rui’s wife as ‘Mrs Zhou’, she knew that this was no mistress but a very high-class maid. So Grannie Liu and Ban-er got up on the kang at one side, while Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife sat near the edge of it on the other, and a little maid came in and poured them all some tea."
茗煙見他這樣，因想與他開心，左思右想，皆是寶玉頑煩了的，不能開心，惟有這件，寶玉不曾看見過。想畢，便走去到書坊內，把那古今小說並那飛燕、合德、武則天、楊貴妃的外傳與那傳奇角本買了許多來，引寶玉看。寶玉何曾見過這些書，一看見了便如得了珍寶。茗煙又囑咐他不可拿進園去，「若叫人知道了，我就喫不了兜著走呢」。寶玉那裏捨的不拿進去，踟躕再三，單把那文理細密的揀了幾套進去，放在床頭上，無人時自己密看。那粗俗過露的，都藏在外面書房裏。,"When Mingyan saw him like this, because he wanted to be happy with him, he thought about it, but Baoyu was stubborn and annoyed and couldn't be happy. Only this one, Baoyu had never seen it before. After thinking about it, he went to the bookstore and bought a lot of the ancient and modern novels, the rumors of Feiyan, Hede, Wu Zetian, Yang Guifei, and the legendary book, and cited Baoyu to read. Baoyu had never seen these books, and as soon as they saw them, they were like treasures. Mingyan also instructed him not to take it into the garden, ""If people know about it, I won't be able to eat and walk around."" Baoyu didn't take any of the ones he put away, but hesitantly, he just picked up a few sets of the ones that had been carefully and rationally, put them on the head of the bed, and watched them secretly when no one was there. Those who are vulgar and revealing are hidden in the study outside.","Ming Yen, upon seeing him go on in this way, felt prompted, with the idea of affording his mind some distraction, to think of this and to devise that expedient; but everything had been indulged in with surfeit by Pao-yue, and there was only this resource, (that suggested itself to him,) of which Pao-yue had not as yet had any experience. Bringing his reflections to a close, he forthwith came over to a bookshop, and selecting novels, both of old and of the present age, traditions intended for outside circulation on Fei Yen, Ho Te, Wu Tse-t’ien, and Yang Kuei-fei, as well as books of light literature consisting of strange legends, he purchased a good number of them with the express purpose of enticing Pao-yue to read them. As soon as Pao-yue caught sight of them, he felt as if he had obtained some gem or jewel. “But you mustn’t,” Ming Yen went on to enjoin him, “take them into the garden; for if any one were to come to know anything about them, I shall then suffer more than I can bear; and you should, when you go along, hide them in your clothes!” But would Pao-yue agree to not introducing them into the garden? So after much wavering, he picked out only several volumes of those whose style was more refined, and took them in, and threw them over the top of his bed for him to peruse when no one was present; while those coarse and very indecent ones, he concealed in a bundle in the outer library.","Tealeaf saw how it was with him and racked his brains for a remedy. Unfortunately all the things he could think of seemed to be things that Bao-yu had already tried and grown tired of. But no, there was something he had not yet tried. As soon as Tealeaf thought of it, he set off to the book-stalls and bought a pile of books – books of a kind Bao-yu had never heard about – to give as a present to his young master. His purchases included Old Inklubber’s Stories Old and New The Secret History of Flying Swallow Sister of Flying Swallow The Infamous Loves of Empress Wu The Jade Ring Concubine, or Peeps in the Inner Palace and a heap of playbooks – mostly romantic comedies and the like. Bao-yu took one look at this gift and was enraptured; but Tealeaf uttered a warning: ‘Don’t take these into the garden I If you do, and anyone finds out about them, I’ll be in real trouble – more than just a bellyful!’ The injunction was one with which Bao-yu was most unwilling to comply. After a good deal of hesitation he picked out a few of the chaster volumes to keep by his bed and read when no one was about, and left the cruder, more forthright ones behind, hidden somewhere in his outer study."
那日，偶又遊至維揚地面，因聞得今歲鹺政點的是林如海。這林如海姓林名海，表字如海，乃是前科的探花，今已昇至蘭臺寺大夫，本貫姑蘇人氏，今欽點出為巡鹽御史，到任方一月有餘。原來這林如海之祖，曾襲過列侯，今到如海，業經五世。起初時，只封襲三世，因當今隆恩盛德，遠邁前代，額外加恩，至如海之父，又襲了一代，至如海，便從科第出身。雖係鍾鼎之家，卻亦是書香之族。只可惜這林家支庶不盛，子孫有限，雖有幾門，卻與如海俱是堂族而已，沒甚親支嫡派的。今如海年已四十，衹有一個三歲之子，偏又於去歲死了。雖有幾房姬妾，奈他命中無子，亦無可如何之事。今只有嫡妻賈氏，生得一女，乳名黛玉，年方五歲。夫妻無子，故愛如珍寶，且又見他聰明清秀，便也欲使他讀書識得幾個字，不過假充養子之意，聊解膝下荒涼之嘆。,"On that day, I even swam to the ground of Weiyang, because I heard that Lin Ruhai was the one who ordered this year's administration. This Lin Ruhai's surname is Lin Minghai, and the word is like a sea. He is a former criminal. He has now been promoted to the doctor of Lantai Temple, and he is originally from Gusu. He has been appointed as the imperial censor of salt inspection. It turned out that the ancestor of Lin Ruhai, who once attacked Liehou, has now arrived in Ruhai, and has passed through five generations. At first, it was only sealed for the third generation. Because of the great virtues of the present, he has stepped farther from the previous generation, and has added grace to the father of Ruhai, and he has inherited another generation. As Ruhai, he was born in Kedi. Although it belongs to the family of Zhong Ding, it is also a family of scholars. It's a pity that the Lin family's support is not prosperous, and the descendants are limited. Although there are several families, they are only part of the family with Ruhai, and there is no direct lineage. Now that the sea year is forty, there is only one three-year-old son, and he died last year. Although there are several concubines, but he has no children, there is nothing to do. Today, there is only his first wife, Jia, who has a daughter named Daiyu, who is five years old. The husband and wife have no children, so their love is like a treasure, and seeing that he is smart and handsome, he also wants to make him read a few words, but he pretends to be an adopted son, and talks about the desolation under his knees.","As luck would have it, on a certain day while making a second journey through the Wei Yang district, he heard the news that the Salt Commissioner appointed this year was Lin Ju-hai. This Lin Ju-hai’s family name was Lin, his name Hai and his style Ju-hai. He had obtained the third place in the previous triennial examination, and had, by this time, already risen to the rank of Director of the Court of Censors. He was a native of Ku Su. He had been recently named by Imperial appointment a Censor attached to the Salt Inspectorate, and had arrived at his post only a short while back. In fact, the ancestors of Lin Ju-hai had, from years back, successively inherited the title of Marquis, which rank, by its present descent to Ju-hai, had already been enjoyed by five generations. When first conferred, the hereditary right to the title had been limited to three generations; but of late years, by an act of magnanimous favour and generous beneficence, extraordinary bounty had been superadded; and on the arrival of the succession to the father of Ju-hai, the right had been extended to another degree. It had now descended to Ju-hai, who had, besides this title of nobility, begun his career as a successful graduate. But though his family had been through uninterrupted ages the recipient of imperial bounties, his kindred had all been anyhow men of culture. The only misfortune had been that the several branches of the Lin family had not been prolific, so that the numbers of its members continued limited; and though there existed several households, they were all however to Ju-hai no closer relatives than first cousins. Neither were there any connections of the same lineage, or of the same parentage. Ju-hai was at this date past forty; and had only had a son, who had died the previous year, in the third year of his age. Though he had several handmaids, he had not had the good fortune of having another son; but this was too a matter that could not be remedied. By his wife, nee Chia, he had a daughter, to whom the infant name of Tai Yue was given. She was, at this time, in her fifth year. Upon her the parents doated as much as if she were a brilliant pearl in the palm of their hand.","One day Yu-cun chanced to be staying in the Yangchow area when he heard that the Salt Commissioner for that year was a certain Lin Ru-hai. This Lin Ru-hai had passed out Florilege, or third in the whole list of successful candidates, in a previous Triennial, and had lately been promoted to the Censorate. He was a Soochow man and had not long taken up his duties in Yangchow following his nomination by the emperor as Visiting Inspector in that area. Lin Ru-hai came of an aristocratic family and was himself fifth in line since his ancestor’s ennoblement. The original patent had been inheritable only up to the third generation, and it was only through the magnanimity of the reigning sovereign that an exceptional act of grace had extended it for a further generation in the case of Lin Ru-hai’s father. Lin Ru-hai himself had therefore been obliged to make his way up through the examination system. It was fortunate for him that, though the family had up to his time enjoyed hereditary emoluments, it had nevertheless enjoined a high standard of education on all of its members. Lin Ru-hai was less fortunate, however, in belonging to a family whose numbers were dwindling. He could still point to several related households, but they were all on the distaff side. There was not a single relation in the direct line who bore his name. Already he was fifty, and his only son had died the year before at the age of three. And although he kept several concubines, he seemed fated to have no son, and had all but resigned himself to this melancholy fact. His chief wife, who had been a Miss Jia, had given him a daughter called Dai-yu. Both parents doted on her, and because she showed exceptional intelligence, conceived the idea of giving her a rudimentary education as a substitute for bringing up a son, hoping in this way somewhat to alleviate the sense of desolation left by the death of their only heir."
寫畢，自雖解悟，又恐人看此不解，因此亦填一支《寄生草》，也寫在偈後。自己又念一遍，自覺無罣礙，中心自得，便上床睡了。,"After writing it, although I understood it, I was afraid that people would find it incomprehensible, so I also filled out a ""Parasitic Grass"", which was also written after the verse. I recited it again, I felt that there was no slack, and the center was content, so I went to bed.","After he had finished writing, he again gave way to fears that though he himself could unfold their meaning, others, who came to peruse these lines, would not be able to fathom them, and he also went on consequently to indite another stanza, in imitation of the “Parasitic Plant,” which he inscribed at the close of the enigma; and when he had read it over a second time, he felt his heart so free of all concern that forthwith he got into his bed, and went to sleep.","After writing it, he was still not satisfied. Though now enlightened himself, he feared that someone reading his gäthä might not be able to share his enlightenment. Accordingly, with the words of the ‘Clinging Vine’ aria still running in his head, he added another set of verses after it to explain his point. That done, he read the whole through to himself out loud, then, with a wonderful feeling of liberation, went to bed and fell fast asleep."
這茗煙乃是寶玉第一個得用的，且又年輕不諳世事，如今聽賈薔說金榮如此欺負秦鍾，連他爺寶玉都干連在內，不給他個利害，下次越發狂縱難制了。這茗煙無故就要欺壓人的，如今得了這個信，又有賈薔助著，便一頭進來找金榮，也不叫金相公了，只說「姓金的，你是什麼東西！」賈薔遂跺一跺靴子，故意整整衣服，看看日影兒說：「是時候了。」遂先向賈瑞說有事要早走一步。賈瑞不敢強他，只得隨他去了。這裏茗煙先一把揪住金榮，問道：「我們肏屁股不肏屁股，管你 相干，橫豎沒肏你爹去罷了！你是好小子，出來動一動你茗大爺！」唬的滿屋中子弟都怔怔的癡望。賈瑞忙吆喝：「茗煙不得撒野！」金榮氣黃了臉，說：「反了！奴才小子都敢如此，我只和你主子說。」便奪手要去抓打寶玉秦鍾。尚未去時，從腦後颼的一聲，早見一方硯瓦飛來，並不知係何人打來的，幸未打著，卻又打在旁人的座上，這座上乃是賈蘭賈菌。,"This tea was the first one that Baoyu could use, and she was young and ignorant of the world. Now, I heard Jia Qiang say that Jin Rong bullied Qin Zhong so much that even his grandfather Baoyu was involved. It's getting more and more frantic. This Mingyan is going to bully people for no reason. Now that he got this letter, and with Jia Qiang's help, he came in to look for Jin Rong. He was no longer called Jin Xianggong, and only said, ""The surname is Jin, what are you?"" Jia Qiang then stomped on her boots, deliberately adjusted her clothes, looked at Ri Ying'er and said, ""It's time."" Then she told Jia Rui that she had to go a step earlier. Jia Rui didn't dare to force him, so he had to go with him. Here, Mingyan grabbed Jin Rong first and asked, ""We don't fuck your ass, it doesn't matter if you have anything to do with it. You are a good boy, come out and touch your uncle Ming!"" The middle-aged disciples all stared blankly. Jia Rui hurriedly shouted, ""You can't go wild with Mingyan!"" Jin Rong's face turned yellow, and he said, ""It's the other way around! Even a servant boy dares to do this. I'll only tell your master."" He rushed to grab Baoyu Qin Zhong. Before I left, there was a whistling sound from the back of my head, and I saw a side of inkstone flying over. I didn’t know who it was. Fortunately, I didn’t hit it, but it hit someone else’s seat. This is the Jialanjia fungus. .","This Ming Yen was the smartest of Pao-yue’s attendants, but he was also young in years and lacked experience, so that he lent a patient ear to what Chia Se had to say about the way Chin Jung had insulted Ch’in Chung. “Even your own master, Pao-yue,” (Chia Se added), “is involved, and if you don’t let him know a bit of your mind, he will next time be still more arrogant.” This Ming Yen was always ready, even with no valid excuse, to be insolent and overbearing to people, so that after hearing the news and being furthermore instigated by Chia Se, he speedily rushed into the schoolroom and cried out “Chin Jung;” nor did he address him as Mr. Chin, but merely shouted “What kind of fellow is this called Chin?” Chia Se presently shuffled his feet, while he designedly adjusted his dress and looked at the rays of the sun. “It’s time,” he observed and walking forthwith, first up to Chia Jui, he explained to him that he had something to attend to and would like to get away a little early; and as Chia Jui did not venture to stop him, he had no alternative but to let him have his way and go. During this while, Ming Yen had entered the room and promptly seizing Chin Jung in a grip: “What we do, whether proper or improper,” he said, “doesn’t concern you! It’s enough anyway that we don’t defile your father! A fine brat you are indeed, to come out and meddle with your Mr. Ming!” These words plunged the scholars of the whole class in such consternation that they all wistfully and absently looked at him. “Ming Yen,” hastily shouted out Chia Jui, “you’re not to kick up a rumpus.” Chin Jung was so full of anger that his face was quite yellow. “What a subversion of propriety! a slave and a menial to venture to behave in this manner! I’ll just simply speak to your master,” he exclaimed as he readily pushed his hands off and was about to go and lay hold of Pao-yue to beat him. Ch’in Chung was on the point of turning round to leave the room, when with a sound of ‘whiff ’ which reached him from behind, he at once caught sight of a square inkslab come flying that way. Who had thrown it he could not say, but it struck the desk where Chia Lan and Chia Chuen were seated. These two, Chia Lan and Chia Chuen, were also the great-grandsons of a close branch of the Jung mansion.","Tealeaf was the most willing but also the youngest and least sensible of Bao-yu’s pages. Jia Qiang told him how Jokey Jin had been bullying Qin Zhong. ‘ And even Bao-yu came in for a share,’ he said. ’ If we don’t take this Jin fellow down a peg, next time he is going to be quite insufferable.’ Tealeaf never needed any encouragement to pick a fight, and now, inflamed by Jia Qiang’s message and open incitement to action, he marched straight into the classroom to look for Jokey Jin. And there was no ‘Master Jin’ when he saw him, either: it was ‘Jin! Who do you think you are?’ At this point Jia Qiang began to scrape his boots on the floor and make a great business of straightening his clothes and glancing out of the window at the sky, muttering to himself as he did so, ‘Ah, yes. Hmn. Must be about time.’ Going up to Jia Rui, he informed him that he had an engagement which necessitated his leaving early, and Jia Rui, not having the courage to stop him, allowed him to slip away. Tealeaf had by now singled out Jokey Jin and grabbed him by the front of his jacket. ‘Whether we fuck arseholes or not,’ he said, ‘what fucking business is it of yours ? You should be bloody grateful we haven’t fucked your dad. Come outside and fight it out with me, if you’ve got any spunk in you!’ ‘Tealeaf!’ Jia Rui shouted agitatedly. ‘You are not to use such language in here !’ Jokey Jin’s face turned pale with anger. ‘This is mutiny! I don’t have to take this sort of thing from a slave. I shall see your master about this’ – and he shook himself free of Tealeaf and made for Bao-yu, intending to seize and belabour him. As Qin Zhong turned to watch the onslaught, he heard a rushing noise behind his head and a square inkstone launched by an unseen hand sailed past it and landed on the desk occupied by Jia Lan and Jia Jun. Jia Lan and Jia Jun belonged to the Rong-guo half of the clan and were in the same generation as the other Jia Lan, the little son of Li Wan and nephew of Bao-yu."
鳳姐兒見自己威重令行，心中十分得意。因見尤氏犯病，賈珍又過於悲哀，不大進飲食，自己每日從那府中煎了各樣細粥，精緻小菜，命人送來勸食。賈珍也另外吩咐每日送上等菜到抱廈內，單與鳳姐。那鳳姐不畏勤勞，天天於卯正二刻就過來點卯理事，獨在抱廈內起坐，不與眾妯娌合群，便有堂客來往，也不迎會。,"Sister Feng was very proud of herself when she saw that she was commanding the line with authority. Seeing You Shi's illness, Jia Zhen was too sad and didn't eat much food. She made all kinds of fine porridge and delicate side dishes from the mansion every day, and ordered someone to send them to persuade them to eat. Jia Zhen also instructed to deliver first-class dishes to Baosha every day, Shan and Sister Feng. That sister Feng is not afraid of hard work, and every day at the second quarter of Maozheng, she comes over to call on the director of Mao, and sits up in the Baoxia alone.","Lady Feng, on her part, (perceiving) the weight her influence had in enjoining the observance of her directions, was in her heart exceedingly delighted. But as she saw, that Chia Chen was, in consequence of Mrs. Yu’s indisposition, even so much the more grieved as to take very little to drink or to eat, she daily, with her own hands, prepared, in the other mansion, every kind of fine congee and luscious small dishes, which she sent over, in order that he might be tempted to eat. And Chia Lien had likewise given additional directions that every day the finest delicacies should be taken into the ante-chamber, for the exclusive use of lady Feng. Lady Feng was not one to shirk exertion and fatigue, so that, day after day, she came over at the proper time, called the roll, and managed business, sitting all alone in the ante-chamber, and not congregating with the whole bevy of sisters-in-law.","Secure in her authority, respected and obeyed by all, Xi-feng might be forgiven for contemplating her achievement with a certain amount of satisfaction. Meanwhile You-shi was still unwell and Cousin Zhen too crushed by his somewhat disproportionate grief to think much about eating and drinking. Xi-feng accordingly had all sorts of invalid slops for You-shi and tempting little delicacies for Cousin Zhen prepared in the kitchens of the Rong-guo mansion and sent over each day to the prostrate couple. Cousin Zhen reciprocated by instructing his own cooks to prepare dishes of the very highest quality exclusively for Xi-feng and having them carried round to her in her little penthouse office. Xi-feng seemed quite tireless in the discharge of her extra duties. Every morning she would be over at the appointed hour to hear the roll-call and would sit there alone in her office, never once emerging to mix with the young Ning-guo women of her own generation. Even when lady visitors arrived she remained in the office and took no part in their reception."

Mammy Li, the partial nurse, came in on crutches to greet her, and looked at Baoyu. Seeing that Baoyu was not at home, the girls only cared about being stubborn, and they couldn't bear it. Yin sighed: ""I only went out from me, I didn't come in very much. The more you look like, the less other mothers dare to talk about you. That Baoyu is a lampstand of 80 feet—it can see others, but not its own. I only know that the house is dirty, this is his house, and it will be more disrespectful because of your collapse."" These girls knew that Baoyu didn't pay attention to these things, and secondly, Mammy Li had already told the old man and went out. They didn't care, so they just ignored him and ignored him. Then Mammy Li just asked ""how much meal Baoyu eats now"", ""what time do you go to bed"" and so on. The girls always agree indiscriminately. Some said, ""What a nasty old guy!""","Some there were who played at chess, others who threw the dice or had a game of cards; and they covered the whole floor with the shells of melon-seeds they were cracking, when dame Li, his nurse, happened to come in, propping herself on a staff, to pay her respects and to see Pao-yue, and perceiving that Pao-yue was not at home and that the servant-girls were only bent upon romping, she felt intensely disgusted. “Since I’ve left this place,” she therefore exclaimed with a sigh, “and don’t often come here, you’ve become more and more unmannerly; while the other nurse does still less than ever venture to expostulate with you; Pao-yue is like a candlestick eighty feet high, shedding light on others, and throwing none upon himself ! All he knows is to look down upon people as being filthy; and yet this is his room and he allows you to put it topsy-turvey, and to become more and more unmindful of decorum!” These servant-girls were well aware that Pao-yue was not particular in these respects, and that in the next place nurse Li, having pleaded old age, resigned her place and gone home, had nowadays no control over them, so that they simply gave their minds to romping and joking, and paid no heed whatever to her. Nurse Li however still kept on asking about Pao-yue, “How much rice he now ate at one meal? and at what time he went to sleep?” to which questions, the servant-girls replied quite at random; some there being too who observed: “What a dreadful despicable old thing she is!”","When Bao-yu left his room for the other mansion, his maids were free to do exactly as they liked and threw themselves into their amusements with great abandon. Some played at Racing Go, some at Dice and Dominoes. Everywhere a litter of the spat-out skins of melon-seeds bore silent testimony to their indulgence. It was unfortunate that Nannie Li should have chosen such a moment to come stomping in, stick in hand, to call on Bao-yu and to inquire how he was getting on. She could see that Bao-yu was out, and the uproar created in his absence by the maids was deeply offensive to her. ‘Now that I’ve left service and don’t come in very often,’ she said with a sigh, ‘you girls have got worse than ever. The other nannies can do nothing with you. And as for Bao-yu: he’s like a six-foot lampstand that lights up others but stays dark itself; for he’s always on about how dirty other people are, but look at the mess he allows you to make of his own room! It’s a disgrace!’ Now the maids all knew that Bao-yu did not care about such matters. They also knew that Nannie Li was pensioned off now and had no more power over them. They therefore continued with their fun and took no notice of her. But Nannie Li was not to be ignored. ‘How is Bao-yu eating nowadays?’ ‘What time does he go to bed?’ She plied the maids with questions which they answered either cheekily or not at all. One of them even said, quite audibly and in her hearing, ‘Old nuisance I’ ‘What’s in this covered bowl?’"
王夫人心中怕的是鳳姐兒未經過喪事，怕他料理不清，惹人恥笑。今見賈珍苦苦的說到這步田地，心中已應了幾分，卻又眼看著鳳姐出神。那鳳姐素日最喜攬事辦，好賣弄才幹，雖然當家妥當，也因未辦過婚喪大事，恐人還不伏，巴不得遇見這事。今見賈珍如此一來，他心中早已歡喜。先見王夫人不允，後見賈珍說的情真，王夫人有活動之意，便向王夫人道：「大哥哥說的這麼懇切，太太就依了罷。」王夫人悄悄的道：「你可能麼？」鳳姐道：「有什麼不能的。外面的大事已經大哥哥料理清了，不過是裏頭照管照管，便是我有不知道的，問問太太就是了。」王夫人見說的有理，便不作聲。賈珍見鳳姐允了，又陪笑道：「也管不得許多了，橫豎要求大妹妹辛苦辛苦。我這裏先與妹妹行禮，等事完了，我再到那邊府裏去謝。」說著，就作揖下去，鳳姐兒還禮不迭。,"What Madam Wang was afraid of was that Sister Feng had not gone through the funeral, and she was afraid that he would not be able to handle it properly and would be ridiculed. Seeing Jia Zhen speak bitterly about this step of the field, she has already agreed a little in her heart, but she sees Sister Feng in a trance. Sister Feng likes to take care of things most of the day, and she is very showy. Although she is in charge, she has never done a wedding or funeral. Seeing Jia Zhen like this now, he was already happy in his heart. Seeing that Madam Wang did not allow it, and then seeing what Jia Zhen said was sincere, Madam Wang had the intention to act, so she said to Madam Wang, ""My elder brother said it so earnestly, so my wife will obey."" Madam Wang said quietly, ""You Is it possible?"" Sister Feng said, ""What can't be done. Big brother has already taken care of the big things outside, but it's the inside to take care of it. If I have something I don't know, just ask my wife."" Madam Wang was right. , then silent. Seeing that Sister Feng agreed, Jia Zhen smiled and said, ""I can't control it anymore. I ask the eldest sister to work hard. I'll bow to my sister here first, and when it's over, I'll go to the mansion over there to thank you."" , I just bowed down, and Sister Feng still complied.","The fears that madame Wang inwardly entertained were that lady Feng had no experience in funeral matters, and she apprehended, that if she was not equal to managing them, she would incur the ridicule of others; but when she now heard Chia Chen make the appeal in such a disconsolate mood, she relented considerably in her resolution. But as she turned her eyes towards lady Feng (to ascertain her wishes), she saw that she was plunged in abstraction. Lady Feng had all along found the greatest zest in taking the initiative in everything, with the idea of making a display of her abilities, so that when she perceived how earnest Chia Chen was in his entreaties, she had, at an early period, made up her mind to give a favourable reply. Seeing besides madame Wang show signs of relenting, she readily turned round and said to her, “My elder cousin has made his appeal in such a solicitous way that your ladyship should give your consent and have done with it.” “Do you think you are equal to the task?” inquired madame Wang in a whisper. “What’s there that I couldn’t be equal to?” replied lady Feng; “for urgent matters outside, my cousin may be said to have already made full provision; and all there is to be done is to keep an eye over things inside. But should there occur anything that I don’t know , I can ask you, madame, and it will be right.” Madame Wang perceiving the reasonableness of what she heard her say, uttered not a word, and when Chia Chen saw that lady Feng had assented; “How much you do attend to I don’t mind,” he observed, forcing another smile, “but I must, in any case, entreat you, cousin, to assume the onerous charge. As a first step I’ll pay my obeisance to you in here, and when everything has been finished, I shall then come over into that mansion to express my thanks.” With these words still on his lips, he made a low bow, but lady Feng had scarcely had time to return the compliment, before Chia Chen had directed a servant to fetch the warrant of the Ning mansion, which he bade Pao-yue hand over to lady Feng.","Lady Wang’s only concern had been lest Xi-feng, who had had no experience of large-scale funerals, might find the task too big for her and perhaps end up by making a fool of herself. But Cousin Zhen’s moving plea caused her attitude to soften considerably and she eyed Xi-feng thoughtfully as though struggling to make up her mind. Xi-feng for her part had always loved managing things and enjoyed showing off her ability to do so. When Cousin Zhen first made his request, her mind had at once consented; and now, observing that Lady Wang appeared to be already half persuaded, she hastened to complete the process. ‘Cousin Zhen has spoken so eloquently. Oughtn’t we perhaps to agree, Aunt?’ ‘Do you think you can do it?’ Lady Wang asked her in a low aside. ‘I don’t see why not,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Cousin Zhen has already seen to all the outside arrangements himself. It’s only a question of looking after the domestic side for a bit. And even if there is anything I don’t know about, I can always ask you.’ This seemed reasonable enough to Lady Wang, so she said nothing. Seeing that Xi-feng herself appeared to be willing, Cousin Zhen turned to her with a smile. ‘Actually there isn’t so very much to do,’ he said. ‘You really must let us persuade you to take this on. Let me make you a reverence now, to show my gratitude. Then, when this is all over, I shall come round to your place to thank you properly.’ So saying, he clasped his hands before him and made her a formal bow."

鳳姐方欲說話時，見榮國府的四個執事人進來，都是要支取東西領牌來的。鳳姐命彩明要了帖唸過，聽了一共四件，指兩件說道：「這兩件開銷錯了，再算清了來取。」說著擲下帖子來，那二人掃興而去。,"When Sister Feng was about to speak, she saw that the four deacons of the Rongguo Mansion came in, all of them wanting to collect things and get licenses. Sister Feng ordered Caiming to ask for the post and read it. After listening to a total of four, she pointed to two and said, ""These two costs are wrong. I'll get it after I figure it out."" .","Lady Feng was on the very point of saying something, when she espied four managers of the Jung Kuo mansion walk in; all of whom wanted permits to indent for stores. Having asked them to read out the list of what they required, she ascertained that they wanted four kinds of articles in all. Drawing attention to two items: “These entries,” she remarked, “are wrong; and you had better go again and make out the account clearly, and then come and fetch a permit.” With these words, she flung down the requisitions, and the two men went their way in lower spirits than when they had come.","Xi-feng was about to address the latecomer when four more servants from the Rong-guo mansion came in asking for tallies. She told them to hand over the order-slips and made Sunshine read them out to her. Two of them contained errors, and Xi-feng flung them down and told the bearers to ‘go away and come back when they had got their figures right’. The two of them went off crestfallen."

水溶又將腕上一串念珠卸了下來，遞與寶玉道：「今日初會，倉促竟無敬賀之物，此係前日聖上親賜鹡鸰香念珠一串，權為賀敬之禮。」寶玉連忙接了，回身奉與賈政。賈政與寶玉一齊謝過。於是賈赦、賈珍等一齊上來請回輿，水溶道：「逝者已登僊界，非碌碌你我塵寰中之人也。小王雖上叨天恩，虛邀郡襲，豈可越僊輛而進也？」賈赦等見執意不從，只得告辭謝恩回來，命手下掩樂停音，滔滔然將殯過完，方讓水溶回輿去了。不在話下。,"Shui Rong took off a string of rosary beads from his wrist and handed it to Bao Yu: ""Today's first meeting, there is nothing to congratulate in a hurry, this is a string of rosary beads of wagtail incense given by the Holy Master the day before yesterday, and it is a gift for congratulations. Baoyu hurriedly connected, and turned around to meet Jia Zheng. Jia Zheng and Baoyu thanked them together. So Jia She, Jia Zhen and others came up together to ask for a reply, and Shui Rong said: ""The deceased has already ascended to the world of immortals, and they are not people in the world. Is the car coming in?"" Jia She waited and insisted that he refused to comply, so he had to leave Xie En and come back, ordered his subordinates to cover up the music and stop the music, and after the funeral was over, he let Shui Rong go back to Yu. Not a problem.","“This is the first time we meet,” he observed. “Our meeting was so unexpected that I have no suitable congratulatory present to offer you. This was conferred upon me by His Majesty, and is a string of chaplet-pearls, scented with Ling Ling, which will serve as a temporary token of respectful congratulations.” Pao-yue hastened to receive it from his hands, and turning round , he reverently presented it to Chia Chen. Chia Chen and Pao-yue jointly returned thanks; and forthwith Chia She, Chia Chen and the rest came forward in a body, and requested the Prince to turn his chair homewards. “The departed,” expostulated Shih Jung, “has already ascended the spiritual regions, and is no more a mortal being in this dusty world exposed to vicissitude like you and I. Although a mean prince like me has been the recipient of the favour of the Emperor, and has undeservedly been called to the princely inheritance, how could I presume to go before the spiritual hearse and return home?” Chia She and the others, perceiving how persistent he was in his refusal had no course but to take their leave, express their sense of gratitude and to rejoin the cortege. They issued orders to their servants to stop the band, and to hush the music, and making the procession go by, they at length left the way clear for Shih Jung to prosecute his way. But we will now leave him and resume our account of the funeral of the Ning mansion.","The Prince of Bei-jing removed a rosary from his wrist and handed it to Bao-yu. ‘Today is our first meeting, but as it was an unforeseen one, I have not come prepared with a suitable gift. All I can offer you is this rosary made of the aromatic seeds of some Indian plant. It was given me by His Imperial Majesty. I hope you will accept it as a little token of my esteem.’ Bao-yu took the rosary and turning back offered it respectfully to Jia Zheng, who made his son join him in formally thanking the prince for his gift. At this point Jia She and Cousin Zhen knelt before the prince and invited him to return. ‘The Departed is now in paradise,’ said the prince.’ Though I enjoy imperial favour and princely rank, I would not presume to go past her carriage, Heavenly honours take precedence over earthly ones!’ When they saw that the prince was adamant, Jia She and the rest bowed their thanks, then, having ordered the musicians to vail their instruments and march by in silence, they caused the front part of the procession and the hearse to pass over the junction. As soon as the hearse had gone over, the prince and his retinue crossed in the other direction, after which the rear part of the procession moved forward and caught up with the rest."
大觀園　園之名,Grand View Garden The name of the garden,"She chose the places she liked, and conferred upon them a name; and devising a general designation for the garden, she called it the Ta Kuan garden (Broad vista), while for the tablet of the main pavilion the device she composed ran as follows: “Be mindful of the grace and remember the equity (of His Majesty);” with this inscription on the antithetical scrolls: Mercy excessive Heaven and earth display, And it men young and old hail gratefully; From old till now they pour their bounties great Those rich gifts which Cathay and all states permeate.","She altered ‘The Phoenix Dance’ to ‘The Naiad’s House’, and she renamed ‘Fragrant Red and Lucent Green’ ‘Crimson Joys and Green Delights’ and named the building in its grounds ‘The House of Green Delights’.

A pile of grass is gone. Everyone in the world knows that gods are good, only gold and silver can't be forgotten; in the end, they only hate meeting not many, and when they are too long, their eyes are closed. Everyone in the world knows that gods are good, but only a beautiful wife can't forget it; when you say kindness on your birthday, you go with others when you die.

往常間衹有寶玉長談闊論，今日賈政在這裏，便惟有唯唯而已。餘者湘雲雖係閨閣弱女，卻素喜談論，今日賈政在席，也自緘口禁言。黛玉本性懶與人共，原不肯多語。寶釵原不妄言輕動，便此時亦是坦然自若。故此一席雖是家常取樂，反見拘束不樂。賈母亦知因賈政一人在此所致之故。酒過三巡，便攆賈政去歇息。賈政亦知賈母之意，攆了自己去後，好讓他們姊妹兄弟取樂的。賈政忙陪笑道：「今日原聽見老太太這裏大設春燈雅謎，故也備了彩禮酒席，特來入會，何疼孫子孫女之心，便不略賜以兒子半點？」賈母笑道：「你在這裏，他們都不敢說笑，沒的倒叫我悶。你要猜謎時，我便說一個你猜，猜不著是要罰的。」賈政忙笑道：「自然要罰。若猜著了，也是要領賞的。」賈母道：「這個自然。」說著便唸道：「猴子身輕站樹梢。——打一菓名。」,"In the past, only Baoyu talked at length, but today Jia Zheng is here, and it is only Yu Wei. Yu Zhe Xiangyun is a weak girl, but she likes to talk about it. Today, when Jia Zheng is present, he also keeps his mouth shut. Daiyu was lazy by nature and was reluctant to talk much. Baochai didn't say anything lightly, but at this time, he was calm and composed. Therefore, although a seat is often enjoyed at home, it is unpleasant to see restraint. Jia's mother also knew that it was because Jia Zheng was here alone. After three rounds of drinking, Jia Zheng was sent to rest. Jia Zheng also knew what Jia's mother meant, and drove himself away, so that their sisters and brothers could have fun. Jia Zheng hurriedly laughed and said, ""Today, I heard that the old lady was setting up a great mystery about spring lanterns here, so she also prepared a betrothal banquet, and I came to join the meeting. Why don't I give my son a little bit because of my grandchildren's heart?"" The mother smiled and said, ""You are here, they don't dare to joke, and they make me bored. When you want to guess a riddle, I will say one you guess. If you can't guess, you will be punished."" Jia Zheng hurriedly laughed: "" Naturally, you will be punished. If you guess, you will also receive a reward.” Mother Jia said, “This is natural.” After speaking, she recited, “The monkey stands lightly on the top of the tree. — Name a fruit.”","Pao-yue to say much or talk at any length, but on this day, with Chia Cheng present, his remarks were limited to assents. And as to the rest, Hsiang-yuen had, though a young girl, and of delicate physique, nevertheless ever been very fond of talking and discussing; but, on this instance, Chia Cheng was at the feast, so that she also held her tongue and restrained her words. As for Tai-yue she was naturally peevish and listless, and not very much inclined to indulge in conversation; while Pao-ch’ai, who had never been reckless in her words or frivolous in her deportment, likewise behaved on the present occasion in her usual dignified manner. Hence it was that this banquet, although a family party, given for the sake of relaxation, assumed contrariwise an appearance of restraint, and as old lady Chia was herself too well aware that it was to be ascribed to the presence of Chia Cheng alone, she therefore, after the wine had gone round three times, forthwith hurried off Chia Cheng to retire to rest. No less cognisant was Chia Cheng himself that the old lady’s motives in packing him off were to afford a favourable opportunity to the young ladies and young men to enjoy themselves, and that is why, forcing a smile, he observed: “ Having to-day heard that your venerable ladyship had got up in here a large assortment of excellent riddles, on the occasion of the spring festival of lanterns, I too consequently prepared prizes, as well as a banquet, and came with the express purpose of joining the company; and why don’t you in some way confer a fraction of the fond love, which you cherish for your grandsons and granddaughters, upon me also, your son?” “When you’re here,” old lady Chia replied smilingly, “they won’t venture to chat or laugh; and unless you go, you’ll really fill me with intense dejection! But if you feel inclined to guess conundrums, well, I’ll tell you one for you to solve; but if you don’t guess right, mind, you’ll be mulcted!” “Of course I’ll submit to the penalty,” Chia Cheng rejoined eagerly, as he laughed, “but if I do guess right, I must in like manner receive a reward!” “This goes without saying!” dowager lady Chia added; whereupon she went on to recite: The monkey’s body gently rests on the tree top! “This refers,” she said, “to the name of a fruit.”","But not for long. Bao-yu, who normally did most of the talking on occasions like this, was today reduced by his father’s presence to saying no more than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ to remarks made by other people. As for the rest: Xiang-yun, in spite of her sheltered upbringing, was normally an animated, not to say indefatigable talker, but this evening she too seemed to have been afflicted with dumbness by Jia Zheng’s presence; Dai-yu was at the best of times unwilling to say very much in company from a sort of aristocratic lethargy which was a part of her nature; and Bao-chai, whose punctilious correctness made her always sparing in the use of words, even though on this occasion she was probably the least uncomfortable of those present, said little to advance the conversation. As a consequence, what should have been a jolly, intimate family party was painfully unnatural and restrained. Grandmother Jia knew as well as everyone else that this state of affairs was entirely owing to Jia Zheng’s presence, and after the wine had gone round for the third time, she attempted to drive him off to bed. Jia Zheng, for his part, was perfectly well aware that he was being driven away so that the younger people could feel freer to enjoy themselves and, smiling forcedly, appealed against his banishment: ‘When they told me earlier today that you were planning to give a riddle party, I specially prepared a contribution to the feast so that I might come and join you. You have so much affection for your grandchildren, Mama. Can you not spare just a tiny bit for your son?’ Grandmother Jia laughed: ‘They can’t talk naturally while you are here. All you are doing is making it gloomy for me. I can’t abide it. Well, if you’ve come to answer riddles, I’ll give you a riddle. But if you can’t guess the answer, you will have to pay me a forfeit.’ ‘Yes, of course,’ said Jia Zheng eagerly. ‘And if I guess right, I shall expect to be given a prize.’ ‘Of course,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘The monkey’s tail reaches from tree-top to ground. It’s the name of a fruit.’"
因看房內，瑤琴、寶鼎、古畫、新詩，無所不有；更喜窗下亦有唾絨，奩間時漬粉污。壁上也見懸著一副對聯，書云：「幽微靈秀地，無可奈何天。」寶玉看畢，無不羨慕。因又請問眾僊姑姓名：一名癡夢僊姑，一名鍾情大士，一名引愁金女，一名度恨菩提，各各道號不一。,"Because in the inspection room, Yaoqin, Baoding, ancient paintings, and new poems were all available; I liked that there was also spit under the window, which was stained with powder when I was in bed. There was also a couplet hanging on the wall. The book said: ""The ghostly and beautiful land is helpless."" After Baoyu read it, he was all envious. Because I also asked the names of the immortals: an immortal immortal, a lover, a golden girl, and a hatred Bodhi, each with a different name.","Espying in the room lutes, with jasper mountings, and tripods, inlaid with gems, antique paintings, and new poetical works, which were to be seen everywhere, he felt more than ever in a high state of delight. Below the windows, were also shreds of velvet sputtered about and a toilet case stained with the traces of time and smudged with cosmetic; while on the partition wall was likewise suspended a pair of scrolls, with the inscription: A lonesome, small, ethereal, beauteous nook! What help is there, but Heaven’s will to brook? Pao-yue having completed his inspection felt full of admiration, and proceeded to ascertain the names and surnames of the Fairies. One was called the Fairy of Lustful Dreams; another “the High Ruler of Propagated Passion;” the name of one was “the Golden Maiden of Perpetuated Sorrow;” of another the “Intelligent Maiden of Transmitted Hatred.” (In fact,) the respective Taoist appellations were not of one and the same kind.","Looking around the room he noticed various musical instruments, antique bronzes, paintings by old masters, poems by new poets, and other hallmarks of gracious living. He was particularly delighted to observe some rouge-stained pieces of cotton-wool lying on the window-sill – evidently the aftermath of some fairy-woman’s toilet. A pair of calligraphic scrolls hung on the wall, making up the following couplet: Earth’s choicest spirits in the dark lie hid: Heaven ineluctably enforced their fate. After reading the scrolls, Bao-yu asked to be introduced to the fairy maidens. They had a strange assortment of names. One was called Dream-of-bliss, another was called Loving-heart, a third Ask-for-trouble, a fourth Past-regrets, and the rest all had names that were equally bizarre."
此時秦鍾已發過兩三次昏了，移床易簀多時矣。寶玉一見，便不禁失聲。李貴忙勸道：「不可不可，秦相公是弱症，未免炕上挺扛的骨頭不受用，所以暫且挪下來鬆散些。哥兒如此，豈不反添了他的病？」寶玉聽了，方忍住，近前看見秦鍾面如白蠟，合目呼吸於枕上。寶玉忙叫道：「鯨兄！寶玉來了。」連叫兩三聲，秦鍾不睬。寶玉又道：「寶玉來了。」,"At this time, Qin Zhong had passed out two or three times, and it was easy to move the bed for a long time. Baoyu lost his voice when he saw it. Li Gui quickly persuaded: ""No, no, Qin Xianggong is weak, and the bones on the kang will not be used, so let's move them down and loosen them up for the time being. Brother, doesn't this make him sick?"" Baoyu listened to this. , Fang held back, and saw Qin Zhong's face like white wax, closing his eyes and breathing on the pillow. Baoyu hurriedly shouted, ""Brother Whale! Baoyu is here."" Qin Zhong ignored him two or three times. Baoyu said again, ""Baoyu is here.""","Ch’in Chung had, by this time, had two or three fainting fits, and had already long ago been changed his mat. As soon as Pao-yue realised the situation, he felt unable to repress himself from bursting forth aloud. Li Kuei promptly reasoned with him. “You shouldn’t go on in this way,” he urged, “you shouldn’t. It’s because Mr. Ch’in is so weak that lying flat on the stove-couch naturally made his bones feel uncomfortable; and that’s why he has temporarily been removed down here to ease him a little. But if you, sir, go on in this way, will you not, instead of doing him any good, aggravate his illness?” At these words, Pao-yue accordingly restrained himself, and held his tongue; and drawing near, he gazed at Ch’in Chung’s face, which was as white as wax, while with closed eyes, he gasped for breath, rolling about on his pillow. “Brother Ching,” speedily exclaimed Pao-yue, “Pao-yue is here!” But though he shouted out two or three consecutive times, Ch’in Chung did not heed him. “Pao-yue has come!” Pao-yue went on again to cry.","At this stage Qin Zhong had already lost consciousness several times and, in accordance with the Northern custom which forbids a sick man to breathe his last on the kang, had some time since been lifted on to a trestle bed to die. Bao-yu gave an involuntary cry when he saw where he was lying and broke into noisy weeping. He was quickly restrained by Li Gui: ‘You know how delicate Master Qin is. I expect the kang was too hard for him and they have put him here so that he can lie a bit more easy. You mustn’t cry like that or you will make him worse!’ Bao-yu held back his sobs and drew close to his dying friend. Qin Zhong’s face was waxen. His eyes were closed tight and he seemed to breathe with difficulty, twisting his head from side to side on the pillow. ‘Jing-qing, old fellow! It’s me! It’s Bao-yu!’ – He called him several times, but Qin Zhong seemed unaware of his presence. Again he called: ‘It’s Bao-yu!’"
賈政在旁聽見這些話，心裏越發難過，便喝退趙姨娘，自己上來委婉解勸。一時又有人來回說：「兩口棺槨都做齊了，請老爺出去看。」賈母聽了，如火上澆油一般，便罵：「是誰做了棺槨？」一疊聲只叫把做棺材的拉來打死。,"When Jia Zheng heard these words by the side, he felt more and more sad. At one point, someone said back and forth: ""The two coffins are all finished, please go out and see."" When Jia Mu heard this, like adding fuel to the fire, she scolded, ""Who made the coffins?"" The coffin was pulled to death.","He then exerted himself for a time to console (his senior) by using kindly accents. But suddenly some one came to announce that the two coffins had been completed. This announcement pierced, like a dagger, dowager lady Chia to the heart; and while weeping with despair more intense, she broke forth in violent upbraidings. “Who is it,”--she inquired; “who gave orders to make the coffins? Bring at once the coffin-makers and beat them to death!”","Jia Zheng was close at hand while she was saying all this and was deeply distressed by it. Peremptorily dismissing the concubine, he tried to calm his mother and reasoned against the injustice of her charges. It was unfortunate that just at that moment a servant should have come in to announce that ‘the two coffins that had been ordered were now ready’. The words were as oil upon fire. The old lady blazed. ‘Who gave orders for those coffins to be made? Where is the man who made them? Go and get the man who made those coffins! Flog him to death!’"
代儒夫婦哭的死去活來，大罵道士，「是何妖鏡！若不早毀此物，遺害於世不小。」遂命架火來燒，只聽鏡內哭道：「誰叫你們瞧正面了！你們自己以假為真，何苦來燒我？」正哭著，只見那跛足道人從外面跑來，喊道：「誰敢毀『風月寶鑒』，吾來救也！」說著，直入中堂，搶入手內，飄然去了。,"Dai Confucian and his wife cried to death, scolding the Taoist priest, ""What is the Yaojing mirror! If you don't destroy this thing early, you will cause a lot of damage to the world."" Look at the front! You yourself take the false as the truth, why bother to burn me?"" While crying, I saw the lame Taoist running from outside, shouting, ""Who dares to destroy the 'Fengyue Baojian', I will come to save me!"" Said He went straight into the middle hall, grabbed his hand, and walked away.","Tai-ju and his wife wept bitterly for him, to the utter disregard of their own lives, while in violent terms they abused the Taoist priest. “What kind of magical mirror is it?” they asked. “If we don’t destroy this glass, it will do harm to not a few men in the world!” Having forthwith given directions to bring fire and burn it, a voice was heard in the air to say, “Who told you to look into the face of it? You yourselves have mistaken what is false for what is true, and why burn this glass of mine?” Suddenly the mirror was seen to fly away into the air; and when Tai-ju went out of doors to see, he found no one else than the limping Taoist, shouting, “Who is he who wishes to destroy the Mirror of Voluptuousness?” While uttering these words, he snatched the glass, and, as all eyes were fixed upon him, he moved away lissomely, as if swayed by the wind.","At once they lifted him from the bed and busied themselves with the laying-out, while old Dai-ru and his wife abandoned themselves to a paroxysm of grief. They cursed the Taoist for a necromancer and ordered the servants to heap up a fire and cast the mirror upon the flames. But just at that moment a voice was heard in the air saying, ‘Who told him to look in the front ? It is you who are to blame, for confusing the unreal with the real! Why then should you burn my mirror?’ Suddenly the mirror was seen to rise up and fly out of the room, and when Dai-ru went outside to look, there was the lame Taoist asking for it back. He snatched it as it flew towards him and disappeared before Dai-ru’s very eyes."
戴權看了，回手便遞與一個貼身的小廝收了，說道：「回來送與戶部堂官老趙，說我拜上他，起一張五品龍禁尉的票，再給個執照，就把這履歷填上，明兒我來兌銀子送去。」小廝答應了，戴權也就告辭了。賈珍十分款留不住，只得送出府門。臨上轎，賈珍因問：「銀子還是我到部兌，還是一併送上老內相府中？」戴權道：「若到部裏，你又喫虧了。不如平準一千二百銀子，送到我家就完了。」賈珍感謝不盡，只說：「待服滿後，親帶小犬到府叩謝。」於是作別。,"Dai Quan looked at it, handed it back and handed it to a close-fitting servant, saying, ""Come back and send it to Lao Zhao, the court official of the Ministry of Housing, saying that I will worship him, get a ticket for the fifth-rank Dragon Forbidden Commander, and give me a license. , fill in this resume, and I'll exchange the money tomorrow to send it."" The servant agreed, and Dai Quan also left. Jia Zhen couldn't keep the money, so she had to send it out of the house. Before getting on the sedan chair, Jia Zhenyin asked, ""Should I bring the silver to the ministry, or should I send it to the old prime minister's mansion?"" Dai Quan said, ""If you go to the ministry, you will suffer again. It's better to settle for 1,200 yuan. The money will be finished when it is delivered to my house."" Jia Zhen thanked him endlessly, and only said, ""When the service is full, bring the puppy to the house to thank you."" So she said goodbye.","Tai Ch’uean, after perusal, turned his hand behind him and passed (the statement) to a constant attendant of his, to put away: “Go back,” he enjoined him, “and give it to His Excellency Mr. Chao, at the head of the Board of Revenue, and tell him, that I present him my compliments, and would like him to draw up a warrant for subaltern of the Imperial Body Guard of the fifth grade, and to also issue a commission; that he should take the particulars from this statement and fill them up; and that to-morrow I’ll come and have the money weighed and sent over.” The young attendant signified his obedience, and Tai Ch’uean thereupon took his leave. Chia Chen did all he could to detain him, but with no success; so that he had no alternative but to escort him as far as the entrance of the Mansion. As he was about to mount into his chair, Chia Chen inquired, “As regards the money, shall I go and pay it into the Board, or am I to send it to the Board of Eunuchs?” “If you were to go and pay it at the Board,” observed Tai Ch’uean; “you are sure to suffer loss; so that it would be better if you just weighed exactly one thousand taels and sent them over to my place; for then an end will be put to all trouble.” Chia Chen was incessant in his expression of gratitude. “When the period of mourning has expired,” he consequently added, “I shall lead in person, my despicable eldest son to your mansion, to pay our obeisance, and express our thanks.” They then parted company, but close upon this, were heard again the voices of runners.","After glancing through it quickly, Dai Quan handed it into the keeping of a young eunuch secretary at his side. ‘When we get back,’ he said to the latter, ‘give this to old Zhao, the President of the Board of Revenue, with my compliments, and ask him if he would kindly make out a commission for a captain in the Imperial Guard, fifth rank, and also the papers to go with it with these particulars filled in. Tell him I’ll call round tomorrow to pay in the money.’ The young eunuch bowed, and Dai Quan rose to go. Seeing that he could no longer detain him, Cousin Zhen showed him out as far as the main gate. As the eunuch was getting into his palanquin, Cousin Zhen asked him whether he should take the money to the Ministry or bring it round to Dai Quan’s own house. ‘Better bring a thousand taels, standard weight, to my house. If you go to the Ministry, they’re sure to fleece you.’ Cousin Zhen thanked him warmly. ‘When the period of mourning is over,’ he said, ‘I shall bring the young fellow round to your house to kotow his thanks.’ With that they parted."
一時寶玉來了，寶釵方出去。寶玉便同襲人道：「怎麼寶姐姐和你說的這麼熱鬧，見我進來就跑了？」問一聲不答，再問時，襲人方道：「你問我麼？我那裏知道你們的原故。」寶玉聽了這話，見他臉上氣色非往日可比，便笑道：「怎麼動了真氣？」襲人冷笑道：「我那裏敢動氣！衹是從今以後別進這屋子了，橫豎有人伏侍你，再別來支使我。我仍舊還伏侍老太太去。」一面說，一面便在炕上合眼倒下。寶玉見了這般景況，深為駭異，禁不住趕來勸慰。那襲人只管合了眼不理。寶玉無了主意，因見麝月進來，便問道：「你姐姐怎麼了？」麝月道：「我知道麼？問你自己便明白了。」寶玉聽說，呆了一回，自覺無趣，便起身嘆道：「不理我罷，我也睡去。」說著，便起身下炕，到自己床上歪下。,"When Baoyu came, Baochai went out. Baoyu then asked, ""Why did Sister Bao tell you so lively that she ran away when she saw me coming in?"" She didn't answer the question, and when she asked again, she said, ""Are you asking me? I know you there. After hearing this, Baoyu saw that his complexion was not comparable to the past, so he smiled and said, ""Why are you so angry?"" Xiren sneered, ""I dare to be angry! Just don't enter this place from now on. The house is down, and there are people waiting for you, don't come to help me. I'm still waiting for the old lady."" As he said that, he closed his eyes on the kang and fell down. Seeing such a situation, Baoyu was deeply horrified, and couldn't help rushing to comfort him. The raider just closed his eyes and ignored it. Baoyu had no idea. Seeing Sheyue coming in, she asked, ""What's wrong with your sister?"" Sheyue said, ""Do I know? Ask yourself and you'll understand."" , then got up and sighed, ""Ignore me, I'm going to sleep too."" After speaking, he got up and got off the kang, and slumped on his bed.","But in a while Pao-yue arrived, and Pao-ch’ai at once quitted the apartment. “How is it,” Pao-yue at once inquired, “that cousin Pao-ch’ai was chatting along with you so lustily, and that as soon as she saw me enter, she promptly ran away?” Hsi Jen did not make any reply to his first question, and it was only when he had repeated it that Hsi Jen remarked: “Do you ask me? How can I know what goes on between you two?” When Pao-yue heard these words, and he noticed that the look on her face was so unlike that of former days, he lost no time in putting on a smile and asking: “Why is it that you too are angry in real earnest?” “How could I presume to get angry!” Hsi Jen rejoined smiling indifferently; “but you mustn’t, from this day forth, put your foot into this room! and as you have anyhow people to wait on you, you shouldn’t come again to make use of my services, for I mean to go and attend to our old mistress, as in days of old.” With this remark still on her lips, she lay herself down on the stove-couch and closed her eyes. When Pao-yue perceived the state of mind she was in, he felt deeply surprised and could not refrain from coming forward and trying to cheer her up. But Hsi Jen kept her eyes closed and paid no heed to him, so that Pao-yue was quite at a loss how to act. But espying She Yueeh enter the room, he said with alacrity: “What’s up with your sister?” “Do I know?” answered She Yueeh, “examine your own self and you’ll readily know!” After these words had been heard by Pao-yue, he gazed vacantly for some time, feeling the while very unhappy; but raising himself impetuously: “Well!” he exclaimed, “if you don’t notice me, all right, I too will go to sleep,” and as he spoke he got up, and, descending from the couch, he betook himself to his own bed and went to sleep.","Presently Bao-yu came in, whereupon Bao-chai got up and left. Bao-yu commented on her departure: ‘Cousin Bao-chai seemed to be very thick with you just now. Why should she suddenly rush off when I come into the room?’ There was no reply, so he repeated his question. ‘Are you asking me?’ said Aroma. ‘I don’t know what reasons you all have for your comings and goings.’ The expression on her face as she uttered these words was angrier than he had ever seen her look before. He laughed. ‘Oh dear! Are you in a rage again?’ Aroma laughed mirthlessly. ‘It’s not for the likes of me to get into rages. But I wish that from now on you would stop coming into this room. After all, you have got people to wait on you elsewhere. You don’t really need my services. I shall go back to serving Her Old Ladyship, like I used to before.’ With that she closed her eyes and lay back upon the kang. Bao-yu was alarmed to see her in such a state and impulsively rushed over to the kang to soothe her. But Aroma kept her eyes tightly shut and would take no notice. Bao-yu did not know what to do. Just then Musk chanced to enter and he turned to her for help: ‘What’s up with Aroma?’ ‘How should I know?’ said Musk. ‘You’d do better to ask yourself that question.’ Bao-yu was so taken aback that for a while he said nothing. Then, finding their combined hostility too much for him, he got up with a sigh from his suppliant position on the kang. ‘All right, ignore me then! I’m going off to sleep, too.’ And he slid from the kang and went off to his own bed to lie down."
至次日坐堂，拘取一應有名人犯，雨村詳加審問，果見馮家人口稀疏，不過賴此欲多得些燒埋之費；薛家仗勢倚情，偏不相讓，故致顛倒未決。雨村便徇情枉法，胡亂判斷了此案。馮家得了許多燒埋銀子，也就無甚話說了。雨村斷了此案，急忙作書信二封，與賈政並京營節度使王子騰，不過說「令甥之事已完，不必過慮」等語。,"After sitting in court the next day, he detained a supposedly famous prisoner, and Yucun conducted a detailed interrogation. He found that the Feng family was sparsely populated, but he wanted to get more money for burning and burying. . Amamura bent the law and judged the case indiscriminately. The Feng family got a lot of money for burning and burying, so they have nothing to say. Yucun ended the case and hurriedly wrote two letters, and together with Jia Zheng and Prince Teng, the imperial envoy of the Beijing-Yingying Festival, he said, ""The matter of your nephew is over, so you don't have to worry about it.""","These two closed their consultation by a fixed determination, and the next day, when he sat in judgment, he marked off a whole company of the plaintiffs as well as of the accused, as were mentioned by name, and had them brought before him. Yue-ts’un examined them with additional minuteness, and discovered in point of fact, that the inmates of the Feng family were extremely few, that they merely relied upon this charge with the idea of obtaining some compensation for joss-sticks and burials; and that the Hsueeh family, presuming on their prestige and confident of patronage, had been obstinate in the refusal to make any mutual concession, with the result that confusion had supervened, and that no decision had been arrived at. Following readily the bent of his feelings, Yue-ts’un disregarded the laws, and adjudicated this suit in a random way; and as the Feng family came in for a considerable sum, with which to meet the expense for incense and the funeral, they had, after all, not very much to say (in the way of objections.) With all despatch, Yue-ts’un wrote and forwarded two letters, one to Chia Cheng, and the other to Wang Tzu-t’eng, at that time commander-in-chief of a Metropolitan Division, simply informing them: that the case, in which their worthy nephew was concerned, had come to a close, and that there was no need for them to give way to any extreme solicitude.","At next day’s session a group of well-known associates of the wanted man were brought in and subjected by Yu-cun to careful questioning. It emerged, as the usher had said, that the Fengs were few in number and had brought this action solely in the hope of gaining some compensation, and that it was only because the Xues had, with the arrogance of the very rich and very powerful, refused to pay a penny, that the case had been brought to a standstill. By a judicious bending of the law to suit the circumstances, Yu-cun managed to arrive at some sort of judgment whereby the plaintiffs received substantial compensation and went off tolerably well satisfied. He then hurriedly drafted and sent off two letters, one to Jia Zheng and one to Wang Zi-teng, Commandant, Metropolitan Barracks, in which he merely stated that their ‘nephew’s affair had been settled and there was no further cause for concern’."
回來只見地下還有許多，寶玉正踟躕間，只聽背後有人說道：「你在這裏作什麼？」寶玉一回頭，卻是林黛玉來了，肩上擔著花鋤，鋤上掛著花囊，手內拿著花帚。寶玉笑道：「好，好，來把這個花掃起來，撂在那水裏。我纔撂了好些在那裏呢。」林黛玉道：「撂在水裏不好。你看這裏的水乾淨，只一流出去，有人家的地方髒的臭的混倒，仍舊把花遭塌了。那畸角上我有一個花冢，如今把他掃了，裝在這絹袋裏，拿土埋上，日久不過隨土化了，豈不乾淨。」,"When he came back, he saw that there were many more underground. Baoyu was lingering, and heard someone behind him say, ""What are you doing here?"" Holding a broom in his hand. Baoyu smiled and said, ""Okay, okay, let's sweep this flower up and put it in the water. I just put a lot of it in there."" Lin Daiyu said, ""It's not good to put it in the water. You can see that the water here is clean, The only way to get out is to go out, and some people's places are dirty and smelly, and the flowers are still collapsed. I have a flower mound on the corner, and now I have swept him, put it in this silk bag, and buried it with soil, After a long time, it will only melt with the soil, so it is not clean.”","But, on his return under the tree, he found the ground again one mass of petals, and Pao-yue was just hesitating what to do, when he heard some one behind his back inquire, “What are you up to here?” and as soon as Pao-yue turned his head round, he discovered that it was Lin Tai-yue, who had come over carrying on her shoulder a hoe for raking flowers, that on this hoe was suspended a gauze-bag, and that in her hand she held a broom. “That’s right, well done!” Pao-yue remarked smiling ; “come and sweep these flowers, and throw them into the water yonder. I’ve just thrown a lot in there myself !” “It isn’t right,” Lin Tai-yue rejoined, “to throw them into the water. The water, which you see, is clean enough here, but as soon as it finds its way out, where are situated other people’s grounds, what isn’t there in it? so that you would be misusing these flowers just as much as if you left them here! But in that corner, I have dug a hole for flowers, and I’ll now sweep these and put them into this gauze-bag and bury them in there; and, in course of many days, they will also become converted into earth, and won’t this be a clean way (of disposing of them)?”","When he got back he found that a lot more of them had fallen while he was away. As he hesitated, a voice behind him said, ‘What are you doing here?’ He looked round and saw that it was Dai-yu. She was carrying a garden hoe with a muslin bag hanging from the end of it on her shoulder and a garden broom in her hand. ‘You’ve come just at the right moment,’ said Bao-yu, smiling at her. ‘Here, sweep these petals up and tip them in the water for me! I’ve just tipped one lot in myself.’ ‘It isn’t a good idea to tip them in the water,’ said Dai-yu. “The water you see here is clean, but farther on beyond the weir, where it flows past people’s houses, there are all sorts of muck and impurity, and in the end they get spoiled just the same. In that corner over there I’ve got a grave for the flowers, and what I’m doing now is sweeping them up and putting them in this silk bag to bury them there, so that they can gradually turn back into earth. Isn’t that a cleaner way of disposing of them?’"
秋夜即事　　絳蕓軒裏絕喧嘩，桂魄流光浸茜紗。苔鎖石紋容睡鶴，井飄桐露濕棲鴉。抱衾婢至舒金鳳，倚檻人歸落翠花。靜夜不眠因酒渴，沉煙重拔索烹茶。,"Autumn night is an event. There is absolutely no noise in Jiangyun Xuan, and the streamer of osmanthus is soaked in the silk yarn.

Quiet night and sleepless due to thirst for wine, heavy smoke and heavy pulls to make tea.","The landscape of an autumnal evening is thus depicted: In the interior of the Chiang Yuen house are hushed all clamorous din and noise. The sheen, which from Selene flows, pervades the windows of carnation gauze. The moss-locked, streaked rocks shelter afford to the cranes, plunged in sleep. The dew, blown on the t’ung tree by the well, doth wet the roosting rooks. Wrapped in a quilt, the maid comes the gold phoenix coverlet to spread. The girl, who on the rails did lean, on her return drops the kingfisher flowers! This quiet night his eyes in sleep he cannot close, as he doth long for wine. The smoke is stifled, and the fire restirred, when tea is ordered to be brewed.","III. Autumn In Red Rue Study, far from worldly din, Through rosy gauze moonlight comes flooding in. Outside, a stork sleeps on moss-wrinkled rocks, And dew from well-side trees the crow’s wings soaks. A maid the great quilt’s golden bird has spread; Her languid master droops his raven head. Wine-parched and sleepless, in the still night he cries For tea, and soon thick smoke and steam arise."

And water caltrops, golden lotus, geese, as well as flows, And mulberry and elm trees which afford rest to swallows.

Generally, sixty-four people in blue robes are invited, and a big book is written on the front of the banner: ""Fengtian Hongjian Zhaonian is not easy to seal the first-class Ningguo Gongzhong grandson to protect the inner court. The coffin of the Gongren of the Qin family of Jiamen"". One should be the deacon's furnishings, all of which are newly made in a hurry, and they are all dazzling. Baozhu was the gift of her own unmarried daughter, and she fell and died, and she was very sad.","The whole night, the lanterns emitted a bright light and the fires brilliant rays; while guests were escorted on their way out and officials greeted on their way in; but of this hundredfold bustle and stir nothing need, of course, be said. The next morning at the dawn of day, and at a propitious moment, sixty-four persons, dressed all alike in blue, carried the coffin, preceded by a streamer with the record in large characters: Coffin of lady Ch’in, a lady of the fifth degree, (by marriage) of the Chia mansion, deceased at middle age, consort of the grandson of the Ning Kuo Duke with the first rank title of honour, (whose status is) a guard of the Imperial antechamber, charged with the protection of the Inner Palace and Roads in the Red Prohibited City. The various paraphernalia and ornaments were all brand-new, hurriedly made for the present occasion, and the uniform lustrous brilliancy they shed was sufficient to dazzle the eyes. Pao-chu, of course, observed the rites prescribed for unmarried daughters, and dashed the bowl and walked by the coffin, as she gave way to most bitter lamentations.","With the dawning of the day and the arrival of the hour deemed auspicious for its departure, sixty-four green-coated bearers arrived for the coffin, preceded by a great funeral banner bearing the following inscription: Mortal Remains of the Much Lamented LADY QIN-SHI of the House of Jia, Senior Great-great-granddaughter-in-law of the Duke of Ning-guo, Nobleman of the First Rank by Imperial Patent, and Wife of the Right Honourable Jia Rong, Honorary Captain in the Imperial Bodyguard, Inner Palace, Northern Capital Division. The costumes, insignia, and funeral trappings were all glitteringly new, having been specially made for the occasion. Jewel, acting in the capacity of unmarried daughter of the deceased, smashed a bowl on die floor at the foot of the coffin and as they bore it out walked in front with an impressive display of grief.

又見奶母正抱了英蓮步來。士隱見女兒越發生得粉妝玉琢，乖覺可喜，便伸手接來，抱在懷內，鬥他頑耍一回。又帶至街前，看那過會的熱鬧。方欲進來時，只見從那邊來了一僧一道：那僧則癩頭跣腳，那道則跛足蓬頭，瘋瘋癲癲，揮霍談笑而至。及至到了他門前，看見士隱抱著英蓮，那僧便大哭起來，又向士隱道：「施主，你把這有命無運、累及爹娘之物，抱在懷內作甚？」士隱聽了，知是瘋話，也不去睬他。那僧還說：「捨我罷，捨我罷！」士隱不耐煩，便抱女兒撤身要進去，那僧乃指著他大笑，口內唸了四句言詞道：「慣養嬌生笑你癡，菱花空對雪澌澌。好防佳節元宵後，便是煙消火滅時。」,"Seeing that the nanny was holding Ying Lian in her arms. Shiyin saw that her daughter was becoming more and more pink and jaded, and she felt happy, so she reached out and took it, hugged him in his arms, and fought him for a while. Take it to the front of the street again to see the liveliness of the party. When Fang Yu came in, he saw a monk coming from there: the monk had a leprosy head and a lame foot, and the Tao had a lame head and a shaggy head. When he arrived at his door and saw Shiyin holding Yinglian, the monk burst into tears and said to Shiyin, ""Donor, what are you doing in your arms with this fateful and unlucky thing that affects your parents? Shi Yin listened to it, and knew it was crazy, so he didn't pay any attention to him. The monk also said, ""Leave me, let me go!"" Shiyin was impatient, so he hugged his daughter and retreated to go in. The monk pointed at him and laughed loudly, and said four sentences in his mouth: ""I am a spoiled child. I laugh at you for being stupid, Linghuakong is chaotic to Xueqiangqiang. After the Lantern Festival, it is time for the smoke to extinguish the fire.""","He also noticed a nurse coming towards him with Ying Lien in her arms. To Shih-yin’s eyes his daughter appeared even more beautiful, such a bright gem, so precious, and so lovable. Forthwith stretching out his arms, he took her over, and, as he held her in his embrace, he coaxed her to play with him for a while; after which he brought her up to the street to see the great stir occasioned by the procession that was going past. He was about to come in, when he caught sight of two priests, one a Taoist, the other a Buddhist, coming hither from the opposite direction. The Buddhist had a head covered with mange, and went barefooted. The Taoist had a limping foot, and his hair was all dishevelled. Like maniacs, they jostled along, chattering and laughing as they drew near. As soon as they reached Shih-yin’s door, and they perceived him with Ying Lien in his arms, the Bonze began to weep aloud. Turning towards Shih-yin, he said to him: “My good Sir, why need you carry in your embrace this living but luckless thing, which will involve father and mother in trouble?” These words did not escape Shih-yin’s ear; but persuaded that they amounted to raving talk, he paid no heed whatever to the bonze. “Part with her and give her to me,” the Buddhist still went on to say. Shih-yin could not restrain his annoyance; and hastily pressing his daughter closer to him, he was intent upon going in, when the bonze pointed his hand at him, and burst out in a loud fit of laughter. He then gave utterance to the four lines that follow: You indulge your tender daughter and are laughed at as inane; Vain you face the snow, oh mirror! for it will evanescent wane, When the festival of lanterns is gone by, guard ‘gainst your doom, ‘Tis what time the flames will kindle, and the fire will consume.","Her delicate little pink-and-white face seemed dearer to him than ever at that moment, and he stretched out his arms to take her and hugged her to him. After playing with her for a while at his desk, he carried her out to the front of the house to watch the bustle in the street. He was about to go in again when he saw a monk and a Taoist approaching, the monk scabby-headed and barefoot, the Taoist tousle-haired and limping. They were behaving like madmen, shouting with laughter and gesticulating wildly as they walked along. When this strange pair reached Shi-yin’s door and saw him standing there holding Ying-lian, the monk burst into loud sobs. ‘Patron,’ he said, addressing Shi-yin, ‘what are you doing, holding in your arms that ill-fated creature who is destined to involve both her parents in her own misfortune?’ Shi-yin realized that he was listening to the words of a madman and took no notice. But the monk persisted: ‘Give her to me! Give her to me!’ Shi-yin was beginning to lose patience and, clasping his little girl more tightly to him, turned on his heel and was about to re-enter the house when the monk pointed his finger at him, roared with laughter, and then proceeded to intone the following verses: ‘Fond man, your pampered child to cherish so- That caltrop-glass which shines on melting snow ! Beware the high feast of the fifteenth day, When all in smoke and fire shall pass away!’1"
正等的不耐煩，忽一太監坐大馬而來，賈母忙接入，問其消息。太監道：「早多著呢！未初刻用過晚膳，未正二刻還到寶靈宮拜佛，酉初刻進大明宮領宴看燈方請旨，只怕戌初纔起身呢。」鳳姐聽了道：「既這麼著，老太太、太太且請回房，等是時候再來也不遲。」於是賈母等暫且自便，園中悉賴鳳姐照理。又命執事人帶領太監們去喫酒飯。,"While waiting impatiently, a eunuch came on a horse, and Mother Jia hurried in to ask for his news. The eunuch said: ""I've written it early! I had dinner at the beginning of the day, I went to the Baoling Palace to worship Buddha at the beginning of the second day, and I entered the Daming Palace for a banquet at the beginning of the day. I was afraid that I would only get up at the beginning of the month."" He said, ""Since this is the case, please go back to the room, old lady and madam. It's not too late to come again when it's time."" So Jia's mother and others took care of themselves for the time being, and the garden's sister Lai Feng took care of it. He also ordered the deacon to lead the eunuchs to dinner and wine.","They were unable to bear the fatigue of any further waiting when, at an unexpected moment, a eunuch arrived on horseback, and Chia Cheng went up to meet him, and ascertained what tidings he was the bearer of. “It’s as yet far too early,” rejoined the eunuch, “for at one o’clock (her highness) will have her evening repast, and at two she has to betake herself to the Palace of Precious Perception to worship Buddha. At five, she will enter the Palace of Great Splendour to partake of a banquet, and to see the lanterns, after which, she will request His Majesty’s permission; so that, I’m afraid , it won’t be earlier than seven before they set out.” Lady Feng’s ear caught what was said. “If such be the case,” she interposed, “may it please your venerable ladyship, and you, my lady, to return for a while to your apartments, and wait; and if you come when it’s time you’ll be here none too late.” Dowager lady Chia and the other ladies immediately left for a time and suited their own convenience, and as everything in the garden devolved upon lady Feng to supervise, she ordered the butlers to take the eunuchs and give them something to eat and drink; and at the same time, she sent word that candles should be brought in and that the lanterns in the various places should be lit.","Just as they were beginning to grow impatient, a eunuch trotted up on horseback and was stopped and questioned by Jia Zheng. ‘Oh, you’re much too early yet!’ said the eunuch. ‘Her Grace won’t be taking her lunch until one o’clock; then at two she goes to divine service in the Bao-ling chapel. Five o’clock, when she has an appointment to feast with the Emperor in the Da-ming Palace and look at the New Year lanterns, is the first opportunity she will have of asking permission to leave. I should be surprised if she got started much before seven o’clock this evening I’ ‘Well,’ said Xi-feng to Grandmother Jia when she heard this, ‘you and Aunt Wang may as well go back to your room. You will be able to come back later on nearer the time.’ Grandmother Jia and the other ladies took her advice and went off, leaving Xi-feng to attend to whatever still needed doing in the garden. Under her direction some of the stewards carried off the eunuchs and treated them to food and wine, while other servants fetched great bundles of wax candles to illuminate the garden’s many lanterns with."
剛至沁芳亭畔，只見寶玉的奶娘李嬤嬤從那邊走來。紅玉立住笑問道：「李奶奶，你老人家那去了？怎打這裏來？」李嬤嬤站住將手一拍道：「你說說，好好的又看上了那個種樹的什麼雲哥兒雨哥兒的，這會子逼著我叫了他來。明兒叫上房裏聽見，可又是不好。」紅玉笑道：「你老人家當真的就依了他去叫了？」李嬤嬤道：「可怎麼樣呢？」紅玉笑道：「那一個要是知道好歹，就回不進來纔是。」李嬤嬤道：「他又不癡，為什麼不進來？」紅玉道：「既是進來，你老人家該同他一齊來，回來叫他一個人亂碰，可是不好呢。」李嬤嬤道：「我有那樣工夫和他走？不過告訴了他，回來打發個小丫頭子或是老婆子，帶進他來就完了。」說著，拄著拐杖一徑去了。紅玉聽說，便站著出神，且不去取筆。,"As soon as they arrived at the Qinfang Pavilion, they saw Baoyu's nanny, Li Ma, coming from there. Hongyu stopped smiling and asked, ""Grandma Li, where did you go to the old man's house? How did you get here?"" Grandma Li stopped and clapped her hand, ""Tell me, it's good to see what cloud that planted a tree. Brother Yu, I forced me to call him now. I called him in the room tomorrow and heard it, but it's not good."" Hongyu smiled and said, ""Does your old man really ask him to call?"" Mammy Li said, ""How about that?"" Hongyu smiled and said, ""If that one knows what's good or bad, then he won't come back in."" Mammy Li said, ""He's not crazy, why didn't he come in?"" Hongyu said: ""Since he came in, the old man should come with him and come back and ask him to touch him alone, but it's not good."" Li Ma said: ""I have the time to go with him? But tell him, come back and send a little girl. Or the old lady, bring him in and it's over."" Saying this, he walked away on crutches. When Hongyu heard this, she stood in a trance and did not go to get the pen.","As soon, however, as she reached the Hsin Fang pavilion, she saw dame Li, Pao-yue’s nurse, appear in view from the opposite side; so Hsiao Hung halted and putting on a smile, “Nurse Li,” she asked, “where are you, old dame, bound for? How is it you’re coming this way?” Nurse Li stopped short, and clapped her hands. “Tell me,” she said, “has he deliberately again gone and fallen in love with that Mr. something or other like Yun (cloud), or Yue (rain)? They now insist upon my bringing him inside, but if they get wind of it by and bye in the upper rooms, it won’t again be a nice thing.” “Are you, old lady,” replied Hsiao Hung smiling, “taking things in such real earnest that you readily believe them and want to go and ask him in here?” “What can I do?” rejoined nurse Li. “Why, that fellow,” added Hsiao Hung laughingly, “will, if he has any idea of decency, do the right thing and not come.” “Besides, he’s not a fool!” pleaded nurse Li; “so why shouldn’t he come in?” “Well, if he is to come,” answered Hsiao Hung, “it will devolve upon you, worthy dame, to lead him along with you; for were you by and bye to let him penetrate inside all alone and knock recklessly about, why, it won’t do at all.” “Have I got all that leisure,” retorted nurse Li, “to trudge along with him? I’ll simply tell him to come; and later on I can despatch a young servant-girl or some old woman to bring him in, and have done.” Saying this, she continued her way, leaning on her staff. After listening to her rejoinder, Hsiao Hung stood still; and plunging in abstraction, she did not go and fetch the pencil.","She was just passing by Drenched Blossoms Pavilion when she caught sight of Bao-yu’s old wet-nurse, Nannie Li, coming from the opposite direction and stood respectfully aside to wait for her. ‘Where have you been, Mrs Li?’ she asked her. ‘ I didn’t expect to see you here.’ Nannie Li made a flapping gesture with her hand: ‘What do you think, my dear: His Nibs has taken a fancy to the young fellow who does the tree-planting – “Yin” or “Yun” or whatever his name is – so Nannie has to go and ask him in. Let’s hope Their Ladyships don’t find out about it. There’ll be trouble if they do.’ ‘Are you really going to ask him in?’ ‘Yes. Why?’ Crimson laughed: ‘If your Mr Yun knows what’s good for him, he won’t agree to come.’ ‘He’s no fool,’ said Nannie Li. ‘Why shouldn’t he?’ ‘Any way, if he does come in,’ said Crimson, ignoring her question, ‘you can’t just bring him in and then leave him, Mrs Li. You’ll have to take him back again yourself after-wards. You don’t want him wandering off on his own. There’s no knowing who he might bump into.’ (Crimson herself, was the secret hope.) ‘Gracious me! I haven’t got that much spare time,’ said Nannie Li. ‘All I’ve done is just to tell him that he’s got to come. I’ll send someone else to fetch him in when I get back presently – one of the girls, or one of the older women, maybe.’"
寶玉還欲看時，那僊姑知他天分高明，性情穎慧，恐把僊機泄漏，遂掩了卷冊，笑向寶玉道：「且隨我去遊玩奇景，何必在此打這悶葫蘆！」,"When Baoyu was still about to read it, the fairy girl knew that he was very talented and had a wise temperament, so she was afraid of revealing the mystery, so she covered the volume, smiled and said to Baoyu, ""Follow me to play the wonders, why do you have to fight this stuffy gourd here? !""","Pao-yue was still bent upon prosecuting his perusal, when the Fairy perceiving that his intellect was eminent and bright, and his natural talents quickwitted, and apprehending lest the decrees of heaven should be divulged, hastily closed the Book of Record, and addressed herself to Pao-yue. “Come along with me,” she said smiling, “and see some wonderful scenery. What’s the need of staying here and beating this gourd of ennui?”","Bao-yu would have liked to see some more, but the fairy woman, knowing how intelligent and sharp-witted he was, began to fear that she was in danger of becoming responsible for a leakage of celestial secrets, and so, snapping the album shut, she said with a laugh, ‘Come with me and we will do some more sight-seeing. Why stay here puzzling your head over these silly riddles?’"
這裏漸漸的就有人來了。先是賈璉、賈薔到來，先看了各處的座位，並問：「有什麼頑意兒沒有？」家人答道：「我們爺原算計請太爺今日來家來，所以並未敢預備頑意兒。前日聽見太爺又不來了，現叫奴才們找了一班小戲兒並一檔子打十番的，都在園子裏戲檯上預備著呢。」,"Gradually, people came here. Jia Lian and Jia Qiang arrived first. They looked at the seats and asked, ""Do you have any stubbornness?"" The family replied, ""Our grandfather planned to invite the grandfather to come home today, so we did not dare to prepare stubbornness. Son. The day before yesterday, I heard that the grandfather was not coming again, and now the minions have been asked to find a group of small operas and play ten times in one file, and they are all preparing on the stage in the garden.""","During this interval, one by one arrived the guests. First came Chia Lien and Chia Se, who went to see whether the seats in the various places (were sufficient). “Is there to be any entertainment or not?” they also inquired. “Our master,” replied the servants, “had, at one time, intended to invite the venerable Mr. Chia Ching to come and spend this day at home, and hadn’t for this reason presumed to get up any entertainment. But when the other day he came to hear that the old gentleman was not coming, he at once gave us orders to go in search of a troupe of young actors, as well as a band of musicians, and all these people are now engaged making their preparations on the stage in the garden.”","Back at home visitors gradually began to arrive. Jia Lian and Jia Qiang were the first. Having inspected the various seating arrangements, they inquired whether there was to be entertainment of some kind. ‘The Master had originally been reckoning on old Sir Jing coming here today,’ said one of the servants, ‘so he didn’t arrange for any entertainment. But the day before yesterday he learned that Sir Jing would not be coming, so he asked us to find a troupe of actors and a band. They are at present on the stage in the garden getting ready for the performance.’"

賈政笑道：「這一處還罷了。若能月夜坐此窗下讀書，不枉虛生一世。」說畢，看著寶玉，唬的寶玉忙垂了頭。眾客忙用話開釋，又說道：「此處的匾該題四個字。」賈政笑問：「那四字？」一個道是「淇水遺風」。賈政道：「俗。」又一個是「睢園雅跡」。賈政道：「也俗。」賈珍笑道：「還是寶兄弟擬一個來。」賈政道：「他未曾作，先要議論人家的好歹，可見就是個輕薄人。」眾客道：「議論的極是，其奈他何。」賈政忙道：「休如此縱了他。」因命他道：「今日任你狂為亂道，先設議論來，然後方許你作。方纔眾人說的，可有使得的？」寶玉見問，答道：「都似不妥。」賈政冷笑道：「怎麼不妥？」寶玉道：「這是第一行幸之處，必須頌聖方可。若用四字的匾，又有古人現成的，何必再作。」賈政道：「難道『淇水』『睢園』不是古人的？」寶玉道：「這太板腐了。莫若『有鳳來儀』四字。」眾人都哄然叫妙。賈政點頭道：「畜生，畜生，可謂『管窺蠡測』矣。」因命：「再題一聯來。」寶玉便唸道：「寶鼎茶閑煙尚綠，幽窗棋罷指猶涼。」賈政搖頭說道：「也未見長。」說畢，引眾人出來。,"Jia Zheng smiled and said, ""This place is fine. If you can sit under this window and read on the moonlit night, your life will not be in vain."" After speaking, Baoyu looked at Baoyu, and the bluffed Baoyu lowered her head. The guests hurriedly explained with words, and then said, ""The plaque here should be inscribed with four characters."" Jia Zheng asked with a smile, ""What are the four characters?"" Jia Zhengdao: ""vulgar."" Another one is ""Suiyuan Yaji"". Jia Zhengdao: ""It's also vulgar."" Jia Zhen smiled and said, ""Brother Bao should come up with one."" Jia Zhengdao: ""He hasn't done it before, so he has to talk about other people's good and bad first. It can be seen that he is a frivolous person."" The guests said: ""The discussion What's wrong with him."" Jia Zheng hurriedly said, ""Don't indulge him like this."" He ordered him to say, ""Today, let you be mad, let's talk about it first, and then let you do it. What did you say, can you make it?"" Baoyu asked, and replied, ""It seems wrong."" Jia Zheng sneered, ""Why is it wrong?"" Baoyu said: ""This is the first line of luck, and you must praise the holy party. Yes. If you use a four-character plaque, and the ancients already made it, why do you need to do it again?"" Jia Zheng said, ""Isn't 'Qishui' and 'Suiyuan' not from the ancients?"" Baoyu said, ""This is too rotten. There are four characters of Fenglaiyi'."" Everyone shouted Miao. Jia Zheng nodded and said, ""Beast, beast, it can be said to be 'gazing through the eyes and measuring'."" Because of his fate: ""Let's try another couplet."" Baoyu then recited: ""Baoding tea is still green, and the chess in the secluded window is still like a finger. Cool."" Jia Zheng shook his head and said, ""I haven't seen much."" After speaking, he led the crowd out.","“This spot,” observed Chia Cheng full of smiles, “is indeed pleasant! and could one, on a moonlight night, sit under the window and study, one would not spend a whole lifetime in vain!” As he said this, he quickly cast a glance at Pao-yue, and so terrified did Pao-yue feel that he hastily drooped his head. The whole company lost no time in choosing some irrelevant talk to turn the conversation, and two of the visitors prosecuted their remarks by adding that on the tablet, in this spot, four characters should be inscribed. “Which four characters?” Chia Cheng inquired, laughingly. “The bequeathed aspect of the river Ch’i!” suggested one of them. “It’s commonplace,” observed Chia Cheng. Another person recommended “the remaining vestiges of the Chue Garden.” “This too is commonplace!” replied Chia Cheng. “Let brother Pao-yue again propound one!” interposed Chia Chen, who stood by. “Before he composes any himself,” Chia Cheng continued, “his wont is to first discuss the pros and cons of those of others; so it’s evident that he’s an impudent fellow!” “He’s most reasonable in his arguments,” all the visitors protested, “and why should he be called to task?” “Don’t humour him so much!” Chia Cheng expostulated. “I’ll put up for today,” he however felt constrained to tell Pao-yue, “with your haughty manner, and your rubbishy speech, so that after you have, to begin with, given us your opinion, you may next compose a device. But tell me, are there any that will do among the mottoes suggested just now by all the gentlemen?” “They all seem to me unsuitable!” Pao-yue did not hesitate to say by way of reply to this question. Chia Cheng gave a sardonic smile. “How all unsuitable?” he exclaimed. “This,” continued Pao-yue, “is the first spot which her highness will honour on her way, and there should be inscribed, so that it should be appropriate, something commending her sacred majesty. But if a tablet with four characters has to be used, there are likewise devices ready at hand, written by poets of old; and what need is there to compose any more?” “Are forsooth the devices ‘the river Ch’i and the Chu Garden’ not those of old authors?” insinuated Chia Cheng. “They are too stiff,” replied Pao-yue. “Would not the four characters: ‘a phoenix comes with dignified air,’ be better?” With clamorous unanimity the whole party shouted: “Excellent:” and Chia Cheng nodding his head; “You beast, you beast!” he ejaculated, “it may well be said about you that you see through a thin tube and have no more judgment than an insect! Compose another stanza,” he consequently bade him; and Pao-yue recited: In the precious tripod kettle, tea is brewed, but green is still the smoke! O’er is the game of chess by the still window, but the fingers are yet cold. Chia Cheng shook his head. “Neither does this seem to me good!” he said; and having concluded this remark he was leading the company out, when just as he was about to proceed, he suddenly bethought himself of something.","‘This must be a pleasant enough place at any time,’ said Jia Zheng with a smile.’ But just imagine what it would be like to sit studying beside the window here on a moonlight night! It is pleasures like that which make a man feel he has not lived in vain!’ As he spoke, his glance happened to fall on Bao-yu, who instantly became so embarrassed that he hung his head in shame. He was rescued by the timely intervention of the literary gentlemen who changed the subject from that of study to a less dangerous topic. Two of them suggested that the name given to this retreat should be a four-word one. Jia Zheng asked them what four words they proposed. ‘“Where Bends the Qi” ‘said one of them, no doubt having in mind the song in the Poetry Classic which begins with the words See in that nook where bends the Qi, The green bamboos, how graceful grown! ‘No,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Too obvious!’ ‘“North of the Sui”,’ said the other, evidently thinking of the ancient Rabbit Garden of the Prince of Liang in Suiyang -also famous for its bamboos and running water. ‘No,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Still too obvious!’ ‘You’d better ask Cousin Bao again,’ said Cousin Zhen, who stood by listening. ‘He always insists on criticizing everyone else’s suggestions Sefore he will deign to make one of his own,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘He is a worthless creature.’ ‘That’s all right,’ said the others. ‘ His criticisms are very good ones. He is in no way to blame for making them.’ ‘You shouldn’t let him get away with it!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘All right!’ he went on, turning to Bao-yu. ‘Today we will indulge you up to the hilt. Let’s have your criticisms, and after that we’ll hear your own proposal. What about the two suggestions that have just been made ? Do you think either of them could be used ?’ ‘Neither of them seems quite right to me,’ said Bao-yu in answer to the question. ‘In what way “not quite right”?’ said Jia Zheng with a scornful smile. ‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘This is the first building our visitor will enter when she looks over the garden, so there ought to be some word of praise for the Emperor at this point. If we want a classical reference with imperial symbolism, I suggest “The Phoenix Dance”, alluding to that passage in the History Classic about the male and female phoenixes alighting “with measured gambollings” in the Emperor’s courtyard.’ ‘What about “Bend of the Qi” and “North of the Sui”?’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Aren’t they classical allusions ? If not, I should like to know what they are!’ ‘Yes,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but they are too contrived. “The Phoenix Dance” is more fitting.’ There was a loud murmur of assent from the literary gentlemen. Jia Zhong nodded and tried not to look pleased. ‘Young idiot! – A “small capacity but a great self-conceit”, gentlemen – All right!’ he ordered: ‘now the couplet!’ So Bao-yu recited the following couplet: ‘From the empty cauldron the steam still rises after the brewing of tea. By the darkening window the fingers are still cold after the game of Go.’ Jia Zheng shook his head: ‘Nothing very remarkable about that!’"
一時擺上茶菓，寶玉便說：「我兩個又不喫酒，把菓子擺在裏間小炕上，我們那裏坐去，省得鬧你們。」於是二人進裏間來喫茶。秦氏一面張羅與鳳姐擺酒菓，一面忙進來囑寶玉道：「寶叔，你侄兒倘或言語不防頭，你千萬看著我，不要理他。他雖腼腆，卻性子左強，不大隨和些是有的。」寶玉笑道：「你去罷，我知道了。」秦氏又囑了他兄弟一回，方去陪鳳姐。,"When tea and fruit were placed, Baoyu said, ""I don't drink alcohol either, so I put the fruit on the small kang in the inner room, and we sit there to save you trouble."" So the two of them went into the inner room to have tea. Qin Shi hurriedly came in and told Baoyu, ""Uncle Bao, if your nephew doesn't speak his mind, you must look at me and ignore him. Although he is shy, he has a strong temperament. , I’m not too easy-going.” Baoyu smiled and said, “You go, I know.” Qin Shi asked his brother again before going to accompany Sister Feng.","Tea and fruits were shortly served, and while they were having their tea, Pao-yue suggested, “We two don’t take any wine, and why shouldn’t we have our fruit served on the small couch inside, and go and sit there, and thus save you all the trouble?” The two of them thereupon came into the inner apartment to have their tea; and Mrs. Ch’in attended to the laying out of fruit and wines for lady Feng, and hurriedly entered the room and hinted to Pao-yue: “Dear uncle Pao, your nephew is young, and should he happen to say anything disrespectful, do please overlook it, for my sake, for though shy, he’s naturally of a perverse and wilful disposition, and is rather given to having his own way.” “Off with you!” cried Pao-yue laughing; “I know it all.” Mrs. Ch’in then went on to give a bit of advice to her brother, and at length came to keep lady Feng company.","‘We two shan’t be drinking any wine,’ Bao-yu said to the ladies. ‘May we have a plate or two of these things set out on the little kang in the other room ? We can talk in there without disturbing you,’ The two boys moved into the inner room for their tea. In between plying Xi-feng with wine and delicacies, Qin-shi slipped in for a word with Bao-yu. ‘My brother’s quite young, Uncle Bao. Please, for my sake, don’t mind him if he does anything to offend you! He may be shy, but he’s got quite a nasty temper. He’s not really easy to get on with at all. ‘You go along!’ said Bao-yu with a smile. ‘We shall be all right!’ After a few admonitory words to her brother, Qin-shi went back to look after Xi-feng."
這裏尤氏方說道：「從前大夫也有說是喜的。昨日馮紫英薦了他從學過的一個先生，醫道很好，瞧了說不是喜，竟是很大的一個症候。昨日開了方子，喫了一劑藥，今日頭眩的略好些，別的仍不見怎麼樣大見效。」,"Here You Shifang said: ""The doctor also said that he was happy in the past. Yesterday Feng Ziying recommended a gentleman he had learned from. He was very good in medicine. After seeing it, he said that he was not happy, but it was a big symptom. Yesterday, the prescription was prescribed. , I took a dose of medicine, and my dizziness is a little better today, but the others still don't see much effect.""","Whereupon Chia Chen and Chia Lien quitted the apartment with hurried step; and during this while, Mrs. Yu reiterated how that some time ago a doctor had also expressed the opinion that she was ailing for a happy event, but that the previous day, had come a doctor, recommended by Feng Tzu-ying-- a doctor, who had from his youth up made medicine his study, and was very proficient in the treatment of diseases,--who asserted, after he had seen her, that it was no felicitous ailment, but that it was some grave complaint. “It was only yesterday,” (she explained,) “that he wrote his prescription; and all she has had is but one dose, and already to-day the giddiness in the head is considerably better; as regards the other symptoms they have as yet shown no marked improvement.”","‘To begin with that’s what some of the doctors told us,’ said You-shi, resuming the conversation; ‘ but yesterday Feng Zi-ying introduced a doctor friend of his to us who is terribly good, someone he went to school with, and he said that she wasn’t expecting at all. He said she was suffering from a serious illness. He wrote a prescription for her yesterday and she has already had one dose of the medicine. Today her giddiness is a bit better, but everything else is still pretty much the same.’"
一日，正當嗟悼之際，俄見一僧一道遠遠而來，生得骨格不凡，豐神迥異，說說笑笑來至峰下，席地坐而長談。只見一塊鮮明瑩潔的美玉，且又縮成扇墜大小，可佩可拿。那僧托於掌上，笑道：「形體倒也是個寶物了！還只沒有實在的好處，須得再鐫上數字，使人一見便知是奇物方妙；然後攜你到那昌明隆盛之邦，詩禮簪纓之族，花柳繁華地，溫柔富貴鄉去安身樂業。」石頭聽了，喜不能禁，乃問：「不知賜了弟子那幾件奇處，又不知攜了弟子到何地方？望乞明示，使弟子不惑。」那僧笑道：「你且莫問，日後自然明白的。」說著，便袖了這石，同那道人飄然而去，竟不知投奔何方何捨。,"One day, at the time of mourning, Russia saw a monk coming from a distance, with extraordinary bones and different spirits, talking, laughing and laughing to the bottom of the peak, sitting on the ground and talking for a long time. I saw a bright and clean jade, and it was shrunk to the size of a fan pendant, which could be worn and held. The monk held it in his palm and said with a smile, ""The body is also a treasure! There is no real benefit, it must be engraved with numbers, so that people can see it is a wonderful thing at first sight; then I will take you to that prosperous and prosperous place. Bang, a family of li, ying and ying, a prosperous land of flowers and willows, a gentle and rich town to go to live and work in peace.” Shi Shi couldn’t help but be overjoyed when he heard this, so he asked, “I don’t know how many wonderful things I have given my disciples, and I don’t know how I brought my disciples here. Where is it? I want to make it clear so that the disciples will not be confused."" The monk smiled and said, ""Don't ask, you will understand in the future."" After speaking, he put the stone in his sleeve and floated away with the Taoist, not knowing where to go. Abandon.","One day, while it lamented its lot, it suddenly caught sight, at a great distance, of a Buddhist bonze and of a Taoist priest coming towards that direction. Their appearance was uncommon, their easy manner remarkable. When they drew near this Ch’ing Keng peak, they sat on the ground to rest, and began to converse. But on noticing the block newly-polished and brilliantly clear, which had moreover contracted in dimensions, and become no larger than the pendant of a fan, they were greatly filled with admiration. The Buddhist priest picked it up, and laid it in the palm of his hand. “Your appearance,” he said laughingly, “may well declare you to be a supernatural object, but as you lack any inherent quality it is necessary to inscribe a few characters on you, so that every one who shall see you may at once recognise you to be a remarkable thing. And subsequently, when you will be taken into a country where honour and affluence will reign, into a family cultured in mind and of official status, in a land where flowers and trees shall flourish with luxuriance, in a town of refinement, renown and glory; when you once will have been there...” The stone listened with intense delight. “What characters may I ask,” it consequently inquired, “will you inscribe? and what place will I be taken to? pray, pray explain to me in lucid terms.” “You mustn’t be inquisitive,” the bonze replied, with a smile, “in days to come you’ll certainly understand everything.” Having concluded these words, he forthwith put the stone in his sleeve, and proceeded leisurely on his journey, in company with the Taoist priest. Whither, however, he took the stone, is not divulged.","One day, in the midst of its lamentings, it saw a monk and a Taoist approaching from a great distance, each of them remarkable for certain eccentricities of manner and appearance. When they arrived at the foot of Greensickness Peak, they sat down on the ground and began to talk. The monk, catching sight of a lustrous, translucent stone – it was in fact the rejected building block which had now shrunk itself to the size of a fan-pendant and looked very attractive in its new shape – took it up on the palm of his hand and addressed it with a smile: ‘Ha, I see you have magical properties I But nothing to recommend you. I shall have to cut a few words on you so that anyone seeing you will know at once that you are something special. After that I shall take you to a certain brilliant successful poetical cultivated aristocratic elegant delectable luxurious opulent locality on a little trip’. The stone was delighted. ‘What words will you cut? Where is this place you will take me to ? I beg to be enlightened.’ ‘Do not ask,’ replied the monk with a laugh.’ You will know soon enough when the time comes.’ And with that he slipped the stone into his sleeve and set off at a great pace with the Taoist. But where they both went to I have no idea."
於是一路行來，或清堂茅舍，或堆石為垣，或編花為牖，或山下得幽尼佛寺，或林中藏女道丹房，或長廊曲洞，或方廈圓亭，賈政皆不及進去，因說半日腿酸，未嘗歇息，忽又見前面又露出一所院落來，賈政笑道：「到此可要進去歇息歇息了。」說著，一徑引入，繞著碧桃花，穿過一層竹籬花障編就的月洞門，俄見粉牆環護，綠柳周垂。賈政與眾人進去，一入門，兩邊都是遊廊相接。院中點襯幾塊山石，一邊種著數本芭蕉；那一邊乃是一顆西府海棠，其勢若傘，絲垂翠縷，葩吐丹砂。眾人讚道：「好花，好花！從來也見過許多海棠，那裏有這樣妙的。」賈政道：「這叫作『女兒棠』，乃是外國之種。俗傳係出『女兒國』中，云彼國此種最盛，亦荒唐不經之說罷了。」眾人笑道：「然雖不經，如何此名傳久了？」寶玉道：「大約騷人詠士，以此花之色紅暈若施脂，輕弱似扶病，大近乎閨閣風度，所以以『女兒』命名。想因被世間俗惡聽了，他便以野史纂入為證，以俗傳俗，以訛傳訛，都認真了。」眾人都搖身讚妙。,"So we walked all the way, or a clear hut, or piled stones into a wall, or weave flowers into a wooden wall, or a Buddhist temple at the foot of the mountain, or a alchemy room of Tibetan women in the forest, or a long corridor and a curved cave, or a square building and a round pavilion. Jia Zheng didn't have time to go in, because he said that his legs were sore for a long time, and he didn't take a rest. Suddenly, he saw another courtyard in front of him. Jia Zheng smiled and said, ""It's time to go in and rest."" Wearing peach blossoms, passing through the moon gate made by a layer of bamboo fence and flower barriers, you can see the pink wall surrounded by green willows. Jia Zheng and everyone went in, and as soon as they entered, there were verandas on both sides. The courtyard is lined with a few rocks, and on one side there are several bananas; on the other side is a Xifu Begonia, which is as powerful as an umbrella, with green threads hanging down from its silk and cinnabar. Everyone praised: ""Good flowers, good flowers! I have seen many begonias before, and there are such wonderful ones there."" Jia Zhengdao: ""This is called ""Daughter Tang"", it is a foreign seed. ”, the most prosperous in Yunbi country, and it’s just absurd.” The crowd laughed: “Even though it’s not classic, how come this name has been passed on for so long?” Baoyu said, “It’s probably a saucy person who praises a scholar, and uses it to look like a flower. The blush is like fat, the weakness is like helping the disease, and it is close to the demeanor of a boudoir, so it is named after ""daughter"". Because he was criticized by the world, he used the compilation of unofficial history as a proof. ."" Everyone shook their heads in praise.","And as they speedily advanced on their way, they either came across elegant halls, or thatched cottages; walls made of piled-up stone, or gates fashioned of twisted plants; either a secluded nunnery or Buddhist fane, at the foot of some hill; or some unsullied houses, hidden in a grove, tenanted by rationalistic priestesses; either extensive corridors and winding grottoes; or square buildings, and circular pavilions. But Chia Cheng had not the energy to enter any of these places, for as he had not had any rest for ever so long, his legs felt shaky and his feet weak. Suddenly they also discerned ahead of them a court disclose itself to view. “When we get there,” Chia Cheng suggested, “we must have a little rest.” Straightway as he uttered the remark, he led them in, and winding round the jade-green peach-trees, covered with blossom, they passed through the bamboo fence and flower-laden hedge, which were twisted in such a way as to form a circular, cavelike gateway, when unexpectedly appeared before their eyes an enclosure with whitewashed walls, in which verdant willows drooped in every direction. Chia Cheng entered the gateway in company with the whole party. Along the whole length of both sides extended covered passages, connected with each other; while in the court were laid out several rockeries. In one quarter were planted a number of banana trees; on the opposite stood a plant of begonia from Hsi Fu. Its appearance was like an open umbrella. The gossamer hanging (from its branches) resembled golden threads. The corollas (seemed) to spurt out cinnabar. “What a beautiful flower! what a beautiful flower!” ejaculated the whole party with one voice; “begonias are verily to be found; but never before have we seen anything the like of this in beauty.” “This is called the maiden begonia and is, in fact, a foreign species,” Chia Cheng observed. “There’s a homely tradition that it is because it emanates from the maiden kingdom that its flowers are most prolific; but this is likewise erratic talk and devoid of common sense.” “They are, after all,” rejoined the whole company, “so unlike others (we have seen), that what’s said about the maiden kingdom is, we are inclined to believe, possibly a fact.” “I presume,” interposed Pao-yue, “that some clever bard or poet, (perceiving) that this flower was red like cosmetic, delicate as if propped up in sickness, and that it closely resembled the nature of a young lady, gave it, consequently, the name of maiden! People in the world will propagate idle tales, all of which are unavoidably treated as gospel!” “We receive (with thanks) your instructions; what excellent explanation!”","a summer lodge a straw-thatched cot a dry-stone wall a flowering arch a tiny temple nestling beneath a hill a nun’s retreat hidden in a little wood a straight gallery a crooked cave a square pavilion and a round belvedere. But Jia Zheng hurried past every one of them without entering. However, he had now been walking for a very long time without a rest and was beginning to feel somewhat footsore; and so, when the next building appeared through the trees ahead, he proposed that they should go in and sit down, and led his party towards it by the quickest route possible. They had to walk round a stand of double-flowering ornamental peach-trees and through a circular opening in a flower-covered bamboo trellis. This brought them in sight of the building’s whitewashed enclosing wall and the contrasting green of the weeping willows which surrounded it. A roofed gallery ran from each side of the gate round the inner wall of the forecourt, in which a few rocks were scattered. On one side of it some green plantains were growing and on the other a weeping variety of Szechwan crab, whose pendant clusters of double-flowering carmine blossoms hung by stems as delicate as golden wires on the umbrella-shaped canopy of its boughs. ‘What magnificent blossom!’ exclaimed the literary gentlemen. ‘One has seen plenty of crab-apple blossom before, but never anything as beautiful as this.’ ‘This kind is called “maiden crab”,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘It comes from abroad. According to vulgar belief it originally came from the Land of Maidens, and that is supposed to be the reason why it blooms so profusely. Needless to say, it is only the ignorant sort of persons who hold this ridiculous belief.’ ‘It certainly has most unusual blossoms,’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Who knows, perhaps there is something in the popular belief.’ ‘Surely,’ said Bao-yu, ‘it is much more probable that poets and painters gave it the name of “maiden crab ” because of its rouge-like colour and delicate, drooping shape, and that the name was misunderstood by ignorant, literal-minded people, who made up this silly story to account for it.’ ‘That must be it!’ said the literary gentlemen. ‘Most grateful for the explanation!’"
那時王夫人已知薛蟠官司一事，虧賈雨村維持了結，纔放了心。又見哥哥昇了邊缺，正愁又少了娘家的親戚來往，略加寂寞。過了幾日，忽家人傳報：「姨太太帶了哥兒姐兒，合家進京，正在門外下車。」喜的王夫人忙帶了女媳人等，接出大廳，將薛姨媽等接了進去。姊妹們暮年相會，自不必說悲喜交集，泣笑敘闊一番。忙又引了拜見賈母，將人情土物各種酬獻了。合家俱廝見過，忙又治席接風。,"At that time, Mrs. Wang knew about Xue Pan's lawsuit, and she was relieved because Jia Yucun maintained the settlement. Seeing that my brother has been promoted to Bian Que again, I am worried that there is less contact with relatives in my parents' family, and I feel a little lonely. A few days later, suddenly the family reported: ""My aunt brought my brother and sister, and the family entered Beijing, and is getting off the bus outside the door."" Mrs. Wang, who was happy, hurriedly brought her daughter-in-law and waited, picked up the hall, and picked up Aunt Xue, etc. go in. When the sisters met in their twilight years, it was not necessary to say that there was a mixture of joys and sorrows, and they cried and laughed together. Busy invited her to see Jia's mother again, and offered all kinds of gifts. The furniture servants have seen each other, and they are busy and take care of the wind.","Madame Wang had by this time already come to know that in the lawsuit, in which Hsueeh P’an was concerned, Chia Yue-ts’un had fortunately intervened and lent his good offices, and was at length more composed in her mind. But when she again saw that her eldest brother had been advanced to a post on the frontier, she was just deploring that, deprived of the intercourse of the relatives of her mother’s family, how doubly lonely she would feel; when, after the lapse of a few days, some one of the household brought the unexpected announcement that “our lady, your sister, has, with the young gentleman, the young lady and her whole household, entered the capital and have dismounted from their vehicles outside the main entrance.” This news so delighted madame Wang that she rushed out, with a few attendants, to greet them in the large Entrance Hall, and brought Mrs. Hsueeh and the others into her house. The two sisters were now reunited, at an advanced period of their lives, so that mixed feelings of sorrow and joy thronged together, but on these it is, of course, needless to dilate. After conversing for a time on what had occurred, subsequent to their separation, madame Wang took them to pay their obeisance to dowager lady Chia. They then handed over the various kinds of presents and indigenous articles, and after the whole family had been introduced, a banquet was also spread to greet the guests.","Lady Wang had just breathed a sigh of relief on learning that the affair of Xue Pan’s manslaughter charge had been retrieved through the good offices of Jia Yu-cun, when the news that her elder brother had been promoted to a frontier post plunged her once more in gloom at the prospect of losing her main source of contact with the members of her own family. Several days passed in despondency, and then suddenly the servants announced that her sister, bringing her son and daughter and all her household with her, had arrived in the capital and was at that very moment outside the gate dismounting from her carriage. Delightedly she hurried with her women to the entrance of the main reception hall and conducted Aunt Xue and her party inside. The sudden reunion of the two sisters was, it goes without saying, an affecting one in which joy and sorrow mingled. After an exchange of information about the years of separation, and after they had been taken to see Grandmother Jia and made their reverence to her, and after the gifts of Nanking produce had been presented and everyone had been introduced to everyone else, there was a family party to welcome the new arrivals."
至上酒席時，賈母又命寶釵點。寶釵點了一出《魯智深醉鬧五臺山》。寶玉道：「只好點這些戲。」寶釵道：「你白聽了這幾年的戲，那裏知道這出戲的好處，排場又好，詞藻更妙。」寶玉道：「我從來怕這些熱鬧。」寶釵笑道：「要說這一出熱鬧，你還算不知戲呢。你過來，我告訴你，這一出熱鬧戲，是一套北《點絳唇》，鏗鏘頓挫，韻律不用說是好的了；只那詞藻中有一支《寄生草》填的極妙，你何曾知道。」寶玉見說的這般好，便湊近來央告：「好姐姐，唸與我聽聽。」寶釵便唸道：「漫揾英雄淚，相離處士家。謝慈悲，剃度在蓮臺下。沒緣法，轉眼分離乍。赤條條，來去無牽掛。那裏討，煙蓑雨笠卷單行？一任俺，芒鞋破缽隨緣化！」,"When it was time for the banquet, Mother Jia ordered Baochai to order. Baochai ordered ""Lu Zhishen Gets Drunk on Mount Wutai"". Baoyu said, ""I have to order these dramas."" Baochai said, ""You have listened to these dramas for nothing, and you know the benefits of this drama, the pomp is good, and the words are better."" Baoyu said, ""I have never been afraid of these. It's lively."" Baochai smiled and said, ""If you want to say that this is a lively show, you still don't know how to play. Come here, I will tell you that this lively play is a set of Bei's ""Little Red Lips"", which is clanging and rhythmic. Needless to say, it’s good; it’s just that one of the words “Parasitic Weed” is wonderfully filled in, how did you know that?” Seeing that Baoyu had said it so well, he approached and pleaded, “Good sister, please listen to me. Baochai then recited: ""Follow the hero's tears, stay away from the Shishi's family. Thank you for your compassion, and shave your life under the lotus pedestal. There is no fate, and we are separated in a blink of an eye. Naked, no worries about coming and going. Where to ask, smoke, rain, and hats roll alone? , the mans shoes and the broken bowls are haphazard!""","When the time came to take their places at the banquet, dowager lady Chia bade Pao-ch’ai make another selection, and Pao-ch’ai cast her choice upon the play: “Lu Chih-shen, in a fit of drunkenness stirs up a disturbance up the Wu T’ai mountain;” whereupon Pao-yue interposed, with the remark: “All you fancy is to choose plays of this kind;” to which Pao-ch’ai rejoined, “You’ve listened to plays all these years to no avail! How could you know the beauties of this play? the stage effect is grand, but what is still better are the apt and elegant passages in it.” “I’ve always had a dread of such sensational plays as these!” Pao-yue retorted. “If you call this play sensational,” Pao-ch’ai smilingly expostulated, “well then you may fitly be looked upon as being no connoisseur of plays. But come over and I’ll tell you. This play constitutes one of a set of books, entitled the ‘Pei Tien Peng Ch’un,’ which, as far as harmony, musical rests and closes, and tune go, is, it goes without saying, perfect; but there’s among the elegant compositions a ballad entitled: ‘the Parasitic Plant,’ written in a most excellent style; but how could you know anything about it?” Pao-yue, upon hearing her speak of such points of beauty, hastily drew near to her. “My dear cousin,” he entreated, “recite it and let me hear it!” Whereupon Pao-ch’ai went on as follows: My manly tears I will not wipe away, But from this place, the scholar’s home, I’ll stray. The bonze for mercy I shall thank; under the lotus altar shave my pate; With Yuean to be the luck I lack; soon in a twinkle we shall separate, And needy and forlorn I’ll come and go, with none to care about my fate. Thither shall I a suppliant be for a fog wrapper and rain hat; my warrant I shall roll, And listless with straw shoes and broken bowl, wherever to convert my fate may be, I’ll stroll.","This time she asked for Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate. ‘Why do you keep choosing plays like that?’ said Bao-yu. ‘To hear you talk, it doesn’t sound as if all your years of play-going have taught you much,’ said Bao-chai. ‘This is an excellent play, both from the point of view of the music and of the words.’ ‘I can’t stand noisy plays,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I never could.’ ‘If you call this a noisy play,’ said Bao-chai, ‘it proves that you don’t know what you’re talking about. Come over here and I’ll explain. This Zhi-shen at the Monastery Gate is a “Ruby Lips ” sequence in the Northern mode. That means, musically speaking, that it is in a vigorous, somewhat staccato style. In fact the musical excellence of this piece goes without saying. But apart from that, the libretto is good, too. The words of Zhi-shen’s “Clinging Vine” aria, which is the last but one in the sequence, are particularly fine.’ Bao-yu was interested, drew his chair closer, and begged her to let him hear them. Lowering her voice so as not to disturb the others, she half-sang, half-recited them for his benefit: ‘I dash aside the manly tear And take leave of my monkish home. A word of thanks to you, my Master dear, Who tonsured me before the Lotus Throne: ‘Twas not my luck to stay with you, And in a short while I must say adieu, Naked and friendless through the world to roam. I ask no goods, no gear to take away, Only straw sandals and a broken bowl, To beg from place to place as best I may.’"
那寶玉一心只記掛著裏邊，又不見賈政吩咐，少不得跟到書房。賈政忽想起他來，方喝道：「你還不去？難道還逛不足！也不想逛了這半日，老太太必懸掛著。還不快進去，疼你也白疼了。」寶玉聽說，方退了出來。再看下回分解。,"That Baoyu only remembered the inside, and he didn't see Jia Zheng's instructions, so he had to follow him to the study. Jia Zheng suddenly remembered him, and Fang shouted: ""You haven't gone yet? Don't you have enough shopping! I don't want to stroll around for half a day, the old lady will hang. If you don't go in quickly, it will hurt you in vain."" Baoyu heard that, Fang withdrew. See the next breakdown.","Forthwith the party egressed from the garden, and Pao-yue’s heart anxiously longed for the society of the young ladies in the inner quarters, but as he did not hear Chia Cheng bid him go, he had no help but to follow him into the library. But suddenly Chia Cheng bethought himself of him. “What,” he said, “you haven’t gone yet! the old lady will I fear be anxious on your account; and is it pray that you haven’t as yet had enough walking?” Pao-yue at length withdrew out of the library.","Bao-yu was now longing to get back to the girls, but as no dismissal was forthcoming from bis father, he followed him along with the others into his study. Fortunately Jia Zheng suddenly recollected that Bao-yu was still with him: ‘Well, run along then! Your grandmother will be worrying about you. I take it you’re not still waiting for more?’ At last Bao-yu could withdraw."
周瑞家的不敢驚動，遂進裏間來。只見薛寶釵穿著家常衣服，頭上只散挽著 兒，坐在炕裏邊，伏在小炕桌上同丫鬟鶯兒正描花樣子呢。見他進來，寶釵纔放下筆，轉過身來，滿面堆笑讓：「周姐姐坐。」周瑞家的也忙陪笑問：「姑娘好？」一面炕沿上坐了，因說：「這有兩三天也沒見姑娘到那邊逛逛去，只怕是你寶兄弟衝撞了你不成？」寶釵笑道：「那裏的話。只因我那種病又發了，所以且靜養兩日。」周瑞家的道：「正是呢，姑娘到底有什麼病根兒，也該趁早兒請個大夫來，好生開個方子，認真喫幾劑，一勢兒除了根纔是。小小年紀倒作下個病根兒，也不是頑的。」,"Zhou Rui's family didn't dare to be disturbed, so he entered the room. I saw Xue Baochai wearing home-made clothes, with only a loose arm on her head, sitting in the kang, lying on the small kang table and drawing flowers with her maid Ying'er. Seeing him come in, Baochai put down the pen, turned around, and said with a smile on his face, ""Sister Zhou, sit down."" I haven't seen a girl going there for two or three days, I'm afraid it's your brother who bumped into you?"" Baochai smiled and said, ""That's it. It's just because I have that kind of disease again, so let's rest in peace. Two days."" Zhou Rui's family said: ""Exactly, what is the root of the girl's illness, you should invite a doctor as early as possible, so that you can prepare a prescription, take a few doses carefully, and the root is the only thing. It's not stubborn to be the next root cause of illness.""","Mrs. Chou did not venture to disturb them, and accordingly came into the inner room, where she found Hsueeh Pao-ch’ai in a house dress, with her hair simply twisted into a knot round the top of the head, sitting on the inner edge of the stovecouch, leaning on a small divan table, in the act of copying a pattern for embroidery, with the waiting-maid Ying Erh. When she saw her enter, Pao Ch’ai hastily put down her pencil, and turning round with a face beaming with smiles, “Sister Chou,” she said, “take a seat.” Chou Jui’s wife likewise promptly returned the smile. “How is my young lady?” she inquired, as she sat down on the edge of the couch. “I haven’t seen you come over on the other side for two or three days! Has Mr. Pao-yue perhaps given you offence?” “What an idea!” exclaimed Pao Ch’ai, with a smile. “It’s simply that I’ve had for the last couple of days my old complaint again, and that I’ve in consequence kept quiet all this time, and looked after myself.” “Is that it?” asked Chou Jui’s wife; “but after all, what rooted kind of complaint are you subject to, miss? you should lose really no time in sending for a doctor to diagnose it, and give you something to make you all right. With your tender years, to have an organic ailment is indeed no trifle!”","She found the two sisters in the midst of a seemingly interminable discussion of some domestic odyssey. Not daring to interrupt it, she passed on into the inner room, where Xue Bao-chai, dressed in workaday clothes, her hair unadorned and twisted in a knot on top of her head, sat with her maid Oriole over a little table towards the back of the kang, tracing a pattern for her embroidery. Seeing Zhou Rui’s wife enter, she laid down her tracing brush, turned towards her with a smile, and invited her to sit with them. ‘How are you, Miss ?’ asked Zhou Rui ’s wife, returning her smile and sitting down on the edge of the kang. ‘I haven’t seen you over our side these last two or three days. Has Master Bao been upsetting you ?’ ‘Good gracious, no!’ said Bao-chai with a laugh. ‘I’ve had an attack of my old sickness again and thought I had better rest quietly at home for a day or two. That’s the only reason.’ ‘Very sensible!’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘But what is this sickness of yours, Miss ?"

賈薔忙張羅扮演起來。一個個歌欺裂石之音，舞有天魔之態。雖是妝演的形容，卻作盡悲歡情狀。剛演完了，一太監執一金盤糕點之屬進來，問：「誰是齡官？」賈薔便知是賜齡官之物，喜的忙接了，命齡官叩頭。太監又道：「貴妃有諭，說『齡官極好，再作兩出戲，不拘那兩出就是了』。」賈薔忙答應了，因命齡官作《遊園》、《驚夢》二出。齡官自為此二出原非本角之戲，執意不作，定要作《相約》《相罵》二出。賈薔扭他不過，只得依他作了。賈妃甚喜，命「不可難為了這女孩子，好生教習」，額外賞了兩匹宮緞、兩個荷包並金銀錁子、食物之類。然後撤筵，將未到之處復又遊頑。忽見山環佛寺，忙另盥手進去焚香拜佛，又題一匾云：「苦海慈航」。又額外加恩與一般幽尼女道。,"Jia Qiang hurriedly acted. One by one, the song deceives the sound of cracking the stone, and the dance has the state of a demon. Although it is a description of makeup, it is full of joys and sorrows. Just after the performance, a eunuch came in with a golden plate of cakes and asked, ""Who is the Lingguan?"" Jia Qiang knew that it was the gift of the Lingguan, so she happily took it, and the Ming Lingguan kowtowed. The eunuch said again, ""The imperial concubine has an edict, saying, 'Ling Guan is very good, let's make two more dramas, no matter which one comes out'."" Jia Qiang hurriedly agreed. Two out. Because of this, Lingguan made two plays that were originally not his original roles, and insisted not to do it. Jia Qiang twisted him but had no choice but to follow him. Concubine Jia was overjoyed and ordered, ""It's not difficult for this girl to teach her a good student"", and she gave an additional two pieces of palace satin, two purses, gold and silver coins, food and the like. Then he withdrew from the feast, and roamed again where he had not been. Suddenly, seeing the Buddhist temple around the mountain, he hurriedly washed his hands and went in to burn incense and worship the Buddha. Also added grace and general Yunni women.","2 Begging (the weaver goddess) for skill in needlework; No. 3 The spiritual match; and No. 4 the Parting spirit. Chia Se speedily lent a hand in the getting up, and the preparations for the performance, and each of the girls sang with a voice sufficient to split the stones and danced in the manner of heavenly spirits; and though their exterior was that of the characters in which they were dressed up for the play, their acting nevertheless represented, in a perfect manner, both sorrow as well as joy. As soon as the performance was brought to a close, a eunuch walked in holding a golden salver containing cakes, sweets, and the like, and inquired who was Ling Kuan; and Chia Se readily concluding that these articles were presents bestowed upon Ling Kuan, made haste to take them over, as he bade Ling Kuan prostrate herself. “The honourable consort,” the eunuch further added, “directs that Ling Kuan, who is the best actress of the lot, should sing two more songs; any two will do, she does not mind what they are.” Chia Se at once expressed his obedience, and felt constrained to urge Ling Kuan to sing the two ballads entitled: “The walk through the garden” and “Frightened out of a dream.” But Ling Kuan asserted that these two ballads had not originally been intended for her own role; and being firm in her refusal to accede and insisting upon rendering the two songs “The Mutual Promise” and “The Mutual Abuse,” Chia Se found it hard to bring her round, and had no help but to let her have her own way. The Chia consort was so extremely enchanted with her that she gave directions that she should not be treated harshly, and that this girl should receive a careful training, while besides the fixed number of presents, she gave her two rolls of palace silk, two purses, gold and silver ingots, and presents in the way of eatables. Subsequently, when the banquet had been cleared, and she once more prosecuted her visit through those places to which she had not been, she quite accidentally espied the Buddhist Temple encircled by hills, and promptly rinsing her hands, she walked in and burnt incense and worshipped Buddha. She also composed the device for a tablet, “a humane boat on the (world’s) bitter sea,” and went likewise so far as to show special acts of additional grace to a company of ascetic nuns and Taoist priestesses.","Jia Qiang hurriedly handed him a list of the pieces they had rehearsed, together with a brochure containing the stage names of each of the twelve players and some notes on the parts which each of them played. Four pieces were chosen: ‘Shi-fan Entertains’ from The Handful of Snow, ‘The Double Seventh’ from The Palace of Eternal Youth, ‘The Meeting of the Immortals’ from The Han-dan Road and Li-niang’s death-scene from The Return of the Soul. Jia Qiang supervised the preparations, and soon the rock-splitting little voices and spell-binding movements of the actresses had taken over, and the stage was full of passions which were no whit less overwhelming for being counterfeit. No sooner had they finished than a eunuch came round, bearing a variety of fancy cakes and sweetmeats on a gilded salver. ‘Which is “Charmante” ?’ he asked, referring to the stage name of the little soubrette who had played the part of Li-niang’s maid in The Return of the Soul and a dashing young huntsman in the ‘play within a play’ in The Handful of Snow. Jia Qiang realized that the confectionery was a present for the little actress, and taking the salver from the eunuch, made Mademoiselle Charmante come forward and kotow her thanks. ‘Her Grace says that she enjoyed Mademoiselle Charmante’s performance the most and would like to see her in two more pieces,’ said the eunuch. ‘She may choose any two she likes.’ Having replied to the eunuch, Jia Qiang told Charmante that she ought to play two more pieces from The Return of the Soul: ‘The Walk in the Garden’ and ‘The Dream’. But neither had a part suitable for a soubrette in it, and Charmante obdurately refused. She said she would do ‘The Assignation’ and ‘The Altercation’ from The Bracelet and the Comb, in which the part of the pert young maidservant would allow her comic talent a fuller scope. Jia Qiang failed to talk her out of this decision and had to let her do as she wished. Yuan-chun was delighted, and gave special instructions that Charmante was to be well treated and to have the best possible training. She also awarded her, over and above her share of the presents that the whole troupe would receive in commemoration of her visit, two dress-lengths of tribute satin, two embroidered purses, and some miniature gold and silver ingots. The feast was now cleared away and Yuan-chun recommenced her tourhe garden, visiting those places which she had not had time to look at before dinner. When they came to the little convent nestling under its hill, she washed her hands and entered the shrine-hall to offer incense and pray before the image of the Buddha. She also wrote an inscription for the board which hung above the image: THE SHIP OF MERCY ON THE SEA OF SUFFERING and gave instructions for various extra presents to be bestowed on the little nuns in addition to those which, along with all the other members of the household, they were already due to receive in commemoration of her visit."
於是寧榮兩處上下裏外，莫不欣然踴躍，個個面上皆有得意之狀，言笑鼎沸不絕。,"Therefore, Ning Rong both up and down, inside and outside, all jumped up and down with joy, and all of them had a look of pride on their faces, and they were full of laughter.","Indeed, of the two households of Ning and Jung, there was not one, whether high or low, woman or man, who was not in a high state of exultation, with the exception of Pao-yue, who behaved just as if the news had not reached his ears; and can you, reader, guess why?","There was one person who did not share the unbounded delight now general among the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households – who behaved, indeed, almost as if he had not heard the news at all."

Feng Suxi's bastard was full of shit, and he wanted to flatter him, so he slammed it in front of his daughter, and took Jiao Xing in a sedan car at night. Yucun was delighted. Needless to say, he gave Feng Su a hundred gold and thanked the wife of the Zhen family for many things, so that she could have a good life and support her, waiting to find out her daughter's whereabouts. Feng Su went home speechless.","The next day, at an early hour, Yue-ts’un sent some of his men to bring over to Chen’s wife presents, consisting of two packets of silver, and four pieces of brocaded silk, as a token of gratitude, and to Feng Su also a confidential letter, requesting him to ask of Mrs. Chen her maid Chiao Hsing to become his second wife. Feng Su was so intensely delighted that his eyebrows expanded, his eyes smiled, and he felt eager to toady to the Magistrate (by presenting the girl to him). He hastened to employ all his persuasive powers with his daughter (to further his purpose), and on the same evening he forthwith escorted Chiao Hsing in a small chair to the Yamen. The joy experienced by Yue-ts’un need not be dilated upon. He also presented Feng Su with a packet containing one hundred ounces of gold; and sent numerous valuable presents to Mrs. Chen, enjoining her “to live cheerfully in the anticipation of finding out the whereabouts of her daughter.”","Early next day a messenger arrived from Yu-cun bearing two packets of silver and four bolts of silk brocade for Mrs hen as a token of the sender’s gratitude. There was also a confidential letter for Feng Su commissioning him to ask Mrs Zhen for Lucky ’s hand as Yu-cun’s second wife. Enraptured at the prospect of doing a good turn for a mandarin, Feng Su hastened to urge upon his daughter the importance of complying with this request, and that very night Lucky was bundled into a small covered chair and carried off to the yamen. Yu-cun’s delight goes without saying. Another hundred taels of silver were despatched to Feng Su, together with a number of good things for Mrs Zhen, to cheer and sustain her until such time as her daughter’s whereabouts could be discovered."
話說秦業父子專候賈家的人來送上學擇日之信。原來寶玉急於要和秦鍾相遇，卻顧不得別的，遂擇了後日一定上學。「後日一早請秦相公到我這裏，會齊了，一同前去。」——打發了人送信去。,"It is said that Qin Ye and his son are waiting for someone from Jia's family to send a letter of choosing a school day. It turned out that Baoyu was eager to meet Qin Zhong, but he didn't care about anything else, so he decided to go to school the day after. ""In the morning of the day after tomorrow, please invite Qin Xianggong to come to my place, we will all be together, and we will go together."" - I sent someone to deliver the letter.","Li Kuei receives a reprimand. Chia Jui and Li Kuei rebuke the obstinate youths! Ming Yen causes trouble in the school-room. But to return to our story. Mr. Ch’in, the father, and Ch’in Chung, his son, only waited until the receipt, by the hands of a servant, of a letter from the Chia family about the date on which they were to go to school. Indeed, Pao-yue was only too impatient that he and Ch’in Chung should come together, and, without loss of time, he fixed upon two days later as the day upon which they were definitely to begin their studies, and he despatched a servant with a letter to this effect.","In the last chapter we left Qin Bang-ye and his son waiting for a message from the Jia household to tell them when Qin Zhong was to begin school. Bao-yu was impatient to see Qin Zhong again and sent word to say that it was to be the day after next. When the appointed day arrived, Bao-yu rose in the morning to find that Aroma had already got his books, brushes and other writing materials ready for him and was sitting disconsolately on the side of his bed."
次日，仍是眾族人等鬧了一日，不必細說。,"The next day, all the clansmen waited for a day of trouble, so there is no need to elaborate.","But in like manner, all the inmates of the clan and the guests spent on the morrow another festive day, but we need not advert to it with any minuteness.","Next day there was another day of feasting for the members of the clan, particulars of which, however, we omit from our record."
因這幾首詩，當時有一等勢利人，見是榮國府十二三歲的公子作的，抄錄出來各處稱頌；再有一等輕浮子弟，愛上那風騷妖艷之句，也寫在扇頭壁上，不時吟哦賞贊。因此竟有人來尋詩覓字，倩畫求題的。寶玉亦發得了意，鎮日家作這些外務。,"Because of these poems, there was a class of snobbery at the time, who saw that they were written by a 12- or 13-year-old son of Rongguo Mansion, and copied and praised everywhere; there was another class of frivolous children, who fell in love with that coquettish and coquettish sentence, which was also written on the fan head. On the wall, from time to time chanting and appreciating. Therefore, there are people who come to look for poems to find words, and Qianhua to ask for questions. Baoyu was also pleased, and the Zhenri family did these foreign affairs.","But putting aside Pao-yue, as he leisurely was occupied in scanning some verses, we will now allude to all these ballads. There lived, at that time, a class of people, whose wont was to servilely court the influential and wealthy, and who, upon perceiving that the verses were composed by a young lad of the Jung Kuo mansion, of only twelve or thirteen years of age, had copies made, and taking them outside sang their praise far and wide. There were besides another sort of light-headed young men, whose heart was so set upon licentious and seductive lines, that they even inscribed them on fans and screen-walls, and time and again kept on humming them and extolling them. And to the above reasons must therefore be ascribed the fact that persons came in search of stanzas and in quest of manuscripts, to apply for sketches and to beg for poetical compositions, to the increasing satisfaction of Pao-yue, who day after day, when at home, devoted his time and attention to these extraneous matters. But who would have anticipated that he could ever in his quiet seclusion have become a prey to a spirit of restlessness?","The indifferent quality of these poems did not prevent members of that class of worldlings who see merit in a name and excellence in a title from copying them out and proclaiming them everywhere as miracles of precocious talent when they discovered that their author was the thirteen-year-old heir apparent of Sir Jia of Rong-guo House. There were also a number of bright young things who professed an extravagant liking for the deliciousness of the poems, and who copied them on to fans and wall-spaces and recited them on the least provocation (or none at all) at social gatherings. Soon Bao-yu was being besieged with requests for more poems, for specimens of his calligraphy, for paintings, for inscriptions. He began to feel himself a lion and was kept constantly busy with these dilettantish ’duties’. Then, quite suddenly, in the midst of this placid, agreeable existence, he was discontented. He got up one day feeling out of sorts. Nothing he did brought any relief."
說話時，劉姥姥已喫畢了飯，拉了板兒過來，舚舌咂嘴的道謝。鳳姐笑道：「且請坐下，聽我告訴你老人家。方纔的意思，我已知道了。若論親戚之間，原該不等上門來就該有照應纔是。但如今家內雜事太煩，太太漸上了年紀，一時想不到也是有的。況是我近來接著管些事，都不知道這些親戚們。二則外頭看著雖是烈烈轟轟的，殊不知大有大的艱難去處，說與人也未必信罷。今兒你既老遠的來了，又是頭一次見我張口，怎好叫你空回去呢。可巧昨兒太太給我的丫頭們做衣裳的二十兩銀子，我還沒動呢，你若不嫌少，就暫且先拿了去罷。」,"When she was speaking, Grandma Liu had already finished her meal, and she pulled the board over and thanked her with her tongue and lips. Sister Feng said with a smile: ""Please sit down and listen to me tell you about the old man's house. I already know what I meant just now. If we were talking about relatives, we should have taken care of them without waiting for them to come. But now there are too many chores at home. It's annoying, my wife is getting older, and I can't think of it for a while. Besides, I've been taking care of things recently, and I don't know about these relatives. Second, although it looks like a bang from the outside, I don't know that there are big and difficult places to go. You may not believe it if you say it. Today, you have come all the way, and this is the first time you see me open your mouth. How can I tell you to go back empty. It happened that my wife made clothes for my girls for twenty taels of silver yesterday. , I haven't moved yet, if you don't think it's too small, just take it for now.""","While she was uttering these words, old goody Liu had had her repast and come over, dragging Pan Erh; and, licking her lips and smacking her mouth, she expressed her thanks. Lady Feng smiled. “Do pray sit down,” she said, “and listen to what I’m going to tell you. What you, old lady, meant a little while back to convey, I’m already as much as yourself well acquainted with! Relatives, as we are, we shouldn’t in fact have waited until you came to the threshold of our doors, but ought, as is but right, to have attended to your needs. But the thing is that, of late, the household affairs are exceedingly numerous, and our lady, advanced in years as she is, couldn’t at a moment, it may possibly be, bethink herself of you all! What’s more, when I took over charge of the management of the menage, I myself didn’t know of all these family connections! Besides, though to look at us from outside everything has a grand and splendid aspect, people aren’t aware that large establishments have such great hardships, which, were we to recount to others, they would hardly like to credit as true. But since you’ve now come from a great distance, and this is the first occasion that you open your mouth to address me, how can I very well allow you to return to your home with empty hands! By a lucky coincidence our lady gave, yesterday, to the waiting-maids, twenty taels to make clothes with, a sum which they haven’t as yet touched, and if you don’t despise it as too little, you may take it home as a first instalment, and employ it for your wants.”","While they were talking, Grannie Liu came back from the other room having already finished eating, smacking her lips and sucking her teeth appreciatively, and voicing her thanks for the repast. ‘Sit down,’ said Xi-feng with a smile. ‘I have something to say to you. I quite understand what you were trying to tell me just now. As we are relations, we ought by rights not to wait for you to come to our door before helping you when you are in trouble; but there are so many things to attend to in this family, and now that Her Ladyship is getting on a bit she doesn’t always remember them all. And since I took over the management of the household, I find there are quite a lot of relations that I don’t even know about. And then again, of course, though we may look thriving enough from the outside, people don’t realize that being a big establishment like ours carries its own difficulties. They won’t believe it if you tell them, but it’s true. However, since you have come such a long way, and since this is the first time you have ever said a word about needing help, we obviously can’t let you go back empty-handed. Fortunately it so happens that I still haven’t touched any of the twenty taels of silver that Her Ladyship gave me the other day to make clothes for the maids with. If you don’t mind it being so little, you are very welcome to take it.’"
至晚間他二人竟漸漸醒來，說腹中飢餓。賈母、王夫人如得了珍寶一般，旋熬了米湯來與他二人喫了，精神漸長，邪祟稍退，一家子纔把心放下來。李宮裁併賈府三艷、薛寶釵、林黛玉、平兒、襲人等在外間聽信息。聞得喫了米湯，省了人事，別人未開口，林黛玉先就唸了一聲「阿彌陀佛」。薛寶釵便回頭看了他半日，嗤的一聲笑。眾人都不會意，賈惜春道：「寶姐姐，好好的笑什麼？」寶釵笑道：「我笑如來佛比人還忙：又要講經說法，又要普渡眾生；這如今寶玉、鳳姐姐病了，又燒香還願，賜福消災；今纔好些，又管林姑娘的姻緣了。你說忙的可笑不可笑。」林黛玉不覺的紅了臉，啐了一口道：「你們這起人不是好人，不知怎麼死！再不跟著好人學，只跟著鳳姐貧嘴爛舌的學。」一面說，一面摔簾子出去了。不知端詳，且聽下回分解。,"In the evening, the two of them gradually woke up and said they were hungry. Mu Jia and Madam Wang were like treasures, so they boiled rice soup and ate it with them. Their spirits grew, and the evil spirits retreated a little, and the family finally let go of their hearts. Li Gongcai and Jia Fu Sanyan, Xue Baochai, Lin Daiyu, Pinger, Xiren and others listened to the information outside. Hearing that she ate rice soup, she saved her time. Before anyone else spoke, Lin Daiyu first recited ""Amitabha Buddha"". Xue Baochai looked back at him for a long time and laughed. Everyone was surprised, Jia Xichun said, ""Sister Bao, why are you laughing so well?"" Baochai smiled and said, ""I laugh at the Tathagata Buddha, who is busier than a human being: I have to teach the scriptures, and I have to save all beings; now Baoyu, Sister Feng was ill, and she burned incense to repay her vows, and she wished for blessings to dispel misfortunes; now she is better now, and she is now in charge of Miss Lin’s marriage. It’s ridiculous that you are busy.” Lin Daiyu blushed unconsciously, and spat, “You two. This person is not a good person, I don’t know how to die! If you don’t learn from good people, you will only learn from Sister Feng’s sloppy words.” As he said that, he threw the curtain and went out. I don't know what to look at, let's listen to the next decomposition.","Little by little they returned to their senses and experienced hunger. Dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang, at length, felt composed in their minds. All the cousins heard the news outside. Tai-yue, previous to anything else, muttered a prayer to Buddha; while Pao-ch’ai laughed and said not a word. “Sister Pao,” inquired Hsi Ch’un, “what are you laughing for?” “I laugh,” replied Pao-ch’ai, “because the ‘Thus-Come’ Joss has more to do than any human being. He’s got to see to the conversion of all mankind, and to take care of the ailments, to which all flesh is heir; for he restores every one of them at once to health; and he has as well to control people’s marriages so as to bring them about through his aid; and what do you say, has he ample to do or not? Now, isn’t this enough to make one laugh, eh?” Lin Tai-yue blushed. “Ts’ui!” she exclaimed; “none of you are good people. Instead of following the example of worthy persons, you try to rival the mean mouth of that hussey Feng.” As she uttered these words, she raised the portiere and made her exit. But, reader, do you want to know any further circumstances? If so, the next chapter will explain them to you.","By evening the sufferers had regained consciousness and said they were hungry. This news, so precious to the ears of Lady Jia and Lady Wang, who at once had rice gruel brought in to feed them with, was relayed to the girls in the outer room. ‘Bless His Holy Name!’ Dai-yu murmured fervently. Bao-chai laughed, but said nothing. The others were mystified. ‘Why do you laugh, Cousin Bao?’ Xi-chun asked her. ‘I was thinking how busy He of the Holy Name must be,’ Bao-chai said. ‘Apart from working for the salvation of all sentient beings, He has to protect the sick and hasten their recovery – not to mention watching over plighted couples to make sure that they marry and live happily ever after. What a lot He has to keep Him busy! Don’t you find the thought rather amusing ?’ Dai-yu affected scorn, but was blushing hotly. ‘You are all horrid. Instead of following good examples, you all imitate Feng and make nasty, cheap jokes all the time.’ She raised the portiere and went out. But if you wish to know more, you will have to wait for the next chapter."
可巧這日拄了拐杖掙挫到街前散散心時，忽見那邊來了一個跛足道人，瘋癲落脫，麻屣鶉衣，口內念著幾句言詞，道是：,"It just so happened that when I was struggling with a cane and went to the street to relax, I suddenly saw a lame Taoist man coming over there.","Strange coincidence, as he, on this day, came leaning on his staff and with considerable strain, as far as the street for a little relaxation, he suddenly caught sight, approaching from the off side, of a Taoist priest with a crippled foot; his maniac appearance so repulsive, his shoes of straw, his dress all in tatters, muttering several sentiments to this effect:","One day, wishing to take his mind off his troubles for a bit, he had dragged himself, stick in hand, to the main road, when it chanced that he suddenly caught sight of a Taoist with a limp – a crazy, erratic figure in hempen sandals and tattered clothes, who chanted the following words to himself as he advanced towards him:"

The grandson of Kui inherits the third-rank Weiyuan general Ma Shang, and the grandson of the Duke of Xiu, Hou Xiaoming, inherits the first-class son Hou Xiaokang. These six families and the two Ning Rong families were called ""Eight Dukes"" that day.

There are about ten large sedan chairs, thirty or forty small sedan chairs, and even the large and small sedan cars at home, no less than a hundred or ten. Even the various deacons, furnishings and tricks in front of them are mighty and mighty, and they are placed three or four miles away.","At that time, among the officials who escorted the funeral procession, were Niu Chi-tsung, the grandson of the Chen Kuo duke, who had now inherited the status of earl of the first degree; Liu Fang, the grandson of Liu Piao, duke of Li Kuo, who had recently inherited the rank of viscount of the first class; Ch’en Jui-wen, a grandson of Ch’en Yi, duke of Ch’i Kuo, who held the hereditary rank of general of the third degree, with the prefix of majestic authority; Ma Shang, the grandson of Ma K’uei, duke of Chih Kuo, by inheritance general of the third rank with the prefix of majesty afar; Hou Hsiao-keng, an hereditary viscount of the first degree, grandson of the duke of Hsiu Kuo, Hou Hsiao-ming by name; while the death of the consort of the duke of Shan Kuo had obliged his grandson Shih Kuang-chu to go into mourning so that he could not be present. These were the six families which had, along with the two households of Jung and Ning, been, at one time, designated the eight dukes. Among the rest, there were besides the grandson of the Prince of Nan An; the grandson of the Prince of Hsi An; Shih Ting, marquis of Chung Ching; Chiang Tzu-ning, an hereditary baron of the second grade, grandson of the earl of P’ing Yuan; Hsieh K’un, an hereditary baron of the second order and Captain of the Metropolitan camp, grandson of the marquis of Ting Ch’ang: Hsi Chien-hui, an hereditary baron of the second rank, a grandson of the marquis of Nang Yang; Ch’in Liang, in command of the Five Cities, grandson of the marquis of Ching T’ien. The remainder were Wei Chi, the son of the earl of Chin Hsiang; Feng Tzu-ying, the son of a general, whose prefix was supernatural martial spirit; Ch’en Yeh-chuen, Wei Jo-lan and others, grandsons and sons of princes who could not be enumerated. In the way of ladies, there were also in all about ten large official sedan chairs full of them, thirty or forty private chairs, and including the official and non-official chairs, and carriages containing inmates of the household, there must have been over a hundred and ten; so that with the various kinds of paraphernalia, articles of decoration and hundreds of nick-nacks, which preceded, the vast expanse of the cortege covered a continuous line extending over three or four li.","Niu Ji-zong (earl, hereditary first rank), grandson of Niu Qing, Duke of Zhen-guo, Liu Fang (viscount, hereditary first rank), grandson of Liu Biao, Duke of Li-guo, Chen Rui-wen (Maj.-General), grandson of Chen Yi, Duke of Qi-guo, Ma Shang-de (Maj.-General), grandson of Ma Kui, Duke of Zhi-guo, Hou Xiao-kang (viscount, hereditary first rank), grandson of Hou Xiao-ming, Duke of Xiu-guo. The grandfathers of the above, together with the Duke of Shan-guo, whose grandson Shi Guang-zhu was in mourning for the Dowager-duchess and unable to attend, and the Dukes of Rong-guo and Ning-guo, had formed the well-known group often referred to by their contemporaries as the ‘Eight Dukes’.

These, with the innumerable bearers of insignia and other funeral trappings up at the front, formed a procession altogether more than a mile long."
襲人道：「第二件，你真喜讀書也罷，假喜也罷，衹是在老爺跟前或在別人跟前，你別只管批駁誚謗，只作出個喜讀書的樣子來，也教老爺少生些氣，在人前也好說嘴。他心裏想著，我家代代讀書，只從有了你，不承望你不喜讀書，已經他心裏又氣又愧了。而且背前背後亂說那些混話，凡讀書上進的人，你就起個名字叫作『祿蠹』；又說只除『明明德』外無書，都是前人自己不能解聖人之書，便另出己意，混編纂出來的。這些話，怎麼怨得老爺不氣，不時時打你。叫別人怎麼想你？」寶玉笑道：「再不說了。那原是那小時不知天高地厚，信口胡說，如今再不敢說了。還有什麼？」,"Xiren said: ""The second thing, whether you really like reading, or fake it, just in front of the master or in front of others, don't just criticize and slander, just pretend to like reading, and teach the master to be less angry. , it's easy to talk in front of people. He thought to himself, my family reads books on behalf of others, it's only because of you, I don't expect you to not like to read, and he's already angry and ashamed. And he is talking nonsense behind his back and behind his back. , For those who are motivated by reading, you will name them ""Lu Zhi""; you also say that there is no book except ""Ming Ming De"", because the predecessors themselves could not understand the book of the sage, so they came up with their own ideas and mixed it up. It was compiled. These words, how can the master be angry and beat you from time to time. How will others think of you?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Don't say it again. Dare to say it. What else?""","“The second thing is this,” Hsi Jen explained; “whether you really like to study or whether you only pretend to like study is immaterial; but you should, when you are in the presence of master, or in the presence of any one else, not do nothing else than find fault with people and make fun of them, but behave just as if you were genuinely fond of study, so that you shouldn’t besides provoke your father so much to anger, and that he should before others have also a chance of saying something! ‘ In my family,’ he reflects within himself, ‘generation after generation has been fond of books, but ever since I’ve had you, you haven’t accomplished my expectations, and not only is it that you don’t care about reading books,’--and this has already filled his heart with anger and vexation,--’but both before my face and behind my back, you utter all that stuff and nonsense, and give those persons, who have, through their knowledge of letters, attained high offices, the nickname of the “the salaried worms.” You also uphold that there’s no work exclusive (of the book where appears) “fathom spotless virtue;” and that all other books consist of foolish compilations, which owe their origin to former authors, who, unable themselves to expound the writings of Confucius, readily struck a new line and invented original notions.’ Now with words like these, how can one wonder if master loses all patience, and if he does from time to time give you a thrashing! and what do you make other people think of you?” “I won’t say these things again,” Pao-yue laughingly protested, “these are the reckless and silly absurdities of a time when I was young and had no idea of the height of the heavens and the thickness of the earth; but I’ll now no more repeat them. What else is there besides?”","‘I don’t care whether you really like studying or not, but even if you don’t, I’d like you at least to pretend that you do when you’re with the Master or any other gentlemen, and not always be making sarcastic remarks about it. If you could only put on an appearance of liking it, he would have less cause to be angry with you, and could even take a bit of pride in you when he was talking to his friends. Look at it from his point of view. Every generation of your family up to now have been scholars. Then suddenly you come along. Not only do you hate studying -that ’s already enough to make him feel angry and upset – but on top of that you have to be forever making rude remarks about it – and not only behind his back but even when he’s there. According to you anyone who studies and tries to improve himself is a “ career worm ”. According to you the Illumination of Clear Virtue or whatever it’s called is the only genuine book ever written and all the rest are forgeries. No wonder the Master gets so angry with you. No wonder he’s every minute of the day wishing he could lay his hands on you and give you a thrashing.’ Bao-yu laughed. ‘All right. I won’t say such things any more. In any case, these are all things I used to say when I was younger and didn’t know any better. I don’t say things like that nowadays. What else?’"
李嬤嬤因吩咐小丫頭子們：「你們在這裏小心著，我家去換了衣服就來，悄悄的回姨太太，別由他的性，多給他喫。」說著便家去了。這裏雖還有三兩個婆子，都是不關痛癢的，見李嬤嬤走了，也都悄悄去尋方便去了。只剩下兩個小丫頭子，樂得討寶玉的歡喜。幸而薛姨媽千哄萬哄的，只容他喫了幾杯，就收過了。作了酸筍雞皮湯來，寶玉痛喝了兩碗，喫了半碗碧粳粥。一時薛林二人也喫完了飯，又釅釅的沏上茶來大家喫了，薛姨媽方放了心。雪雁等三四個丫頭已喫了飯，進來伺候。黛玉因問寶玉道：「你走不走？」寶玉乜斜倦眼道：「你要走，我和你一同走。」黛玉聽說，遂起身道：「咱們來了這一日，也該回去了。還不知那邊怎麼找咱們呢。」說著，二人便告辭。,"Mammy Li instructed the little girls: ""You guys be careful here, I'll come after I change clothes, go back to my concubine quietly, don't let his sex, give him more food."" Then she went home. Although there are three or two old women here, all of them are irrelevant. Seeing that Mammy Li is gone, they all quietly go to find convenience. There were only two little girls left, happy to please Baoyu. Fortunately, Aunt Xue coaxed him so much that she only allowed him to eat a few cups, and then she accepted it. After making sour bamboo shoots and chicken skin soup, Baoyu drank two bowls and ate half a bowl of green rice porridge. After a while, Xue Lin and the two also finished their meal, and then brewed tea for everyone to eat. Aunt Xue was relieved. Xue Yan and other three or four girls have already eaten and came in to serve. Daiyu asked Baoyu, ""Are you going?"" Baoyu squinted her eyes and said, ""If you want to go, I will go with you."" It's time to go back. I don't know how to find us over there."" After speaking, the two left.","It was only after these assurances that Pao-yue’s spirits began at length, once more to revive, and dame Li then directed the waiting-maids what to do. “You remain here,” she enjoined, “and mind, be diligent while I go home and change; when I’ll come back again. Don’t allow him,” she also whispered to “aunt” Hsueeh, “to have all his own way and drink too much.” Having said this, she betook herself back to her quarters; and during this while, though there were two or three nurses in attendance, they did not concern themselves with what was going on. As soon as they saw that nurse Li had left, they likewise all quietly slipped out, at the first opportunity they found, while there remained but two waiting-maids, who were only too glad to curry favour with Pao-yue. But fortunately “aunt” Hsueeh, by much coaxing and persuading, only let him have a few cups, and the wine being then promptly cleared away, pickled bamboo shoots and chicken-skin soup were prepared, of which Pao-yue drank with relish several bowls full, eating besides more than half a bowl of finest rice congee. By this time, Hsueeh Pao Ch’ai and Lin Tai-yue had also finished their repast; and when Pao-yue had drunk a few cups of strong tea, Mrs. Hsueeh felt more easy in her mind. Hsueeh Yen and the others, three or four of them in all, had also had their meal, and came in to wait upon them. “Are you now going or not?” inquired Tai-yue of Pao-yue. Pao-yue looked askance with his drowsy eyes. “If you want to go,” he observed, “I’ll go with you.” Tai-yue hearing this, speedily rose. “We’ve been here nearly the whole day,” she said, “and ought to be going back.”","‘Keep an eye on him,’ said Nannie Li to the maids. ‘I’m just going back for a few minutes to change my clothes.’ Then aside to Aunt Xue she said, ‘Don’t let him drink too much, Mrs Xue!’ and went off home. Although two or three old women still remained after her departure, none felt very much concern for Bao-yu, and as soon as Nannie Li was out of the way they quietly slipped off about their own concerns, leaving, of the attendants who had come with him, only two small maids, whose only anxiety was to please their young master by indulging him as much as possible. Fortunately Aunt Xue, by exercising great tact and finesse, managed to spirit the wine away when Bao-yu had drunk only a few more cups, and to replace it with a hot, sour soup of pickled bamboo-shoots and chicken-skin. He drank several bowls of this with great relish and then ate half a bowl of green-rice gruel. After that, when Bao-chai and Dai-yu had finished eating, he drank several cups of very strong tea. At this point Aunt Xue felt sure that he would be all right. As Snowgoose and the other maids had now finished supper too and were once more in attendance, Dai-yu asked Bao-yu if he was ready to go. He looked at her blearily through tired eyes. ‘If you want to go, I will go with you.’ Dai-yu rose to her feet. ‘We really ought to go. We’ve been here practically all day!’ The two of them began saying their good-byes."
原來這一個名喚賈薔，亦係寧府中之正派玄孫，父母早亡，從小兒跟著賈珍過活，如今長了十六歲，比賈蓉生的還風流俊俏。他弟兄二人最相親厚，常相共處。寧府人多口雜，那些不得志的奴僕們，專能造言誹謗主人，因此不知又有什麼小人詬誶謠諑之詞。賈珍想亦風聞得些口聲不大好，自己也要避些嫌疑，如今竟分與房舍，命賈薔搬出寧府，自去立門戶過活去了。這賈薔外相既美，內性又聰明，雖然應名來上學，亦不過虛掩眼目而已。仍是鬥雞走狗，賞花玩柳。總恃上有賈珍溺愛，下有賈蓉匡助，因此族人誰敢來觸逆於他。他既和賈蓉最好，今見有人欺負秦鍾，如何肯依？如今自己要挺身出來報不平，心中卻忖度一番，想道：「金榮賈瑞一干人，都是薛大叔的相知，向日我又與薛大叔相好，倘或我一出頭，他們告訴了老薛，我們豈不傷和氣？待要不管，如此謠言，說的大家沒趣。如今何不用計制伏，又止息口聲，又傷不了臉面。」想畢，也裝作出小恭，走至外面，悄悄的把跟寶玉的書童名喚茗煙者喚到身邊，如此這般，調撥他幾句。,"It turned out that this one, named Jia Qiang, was also a decent great-grandson in Ning's residence. His parents died early, and he lived with Jia Zhen since childhood. The two brothers are the closest to each other and often get along with each other. The Ning Mansion has many people, and those unwilling servants can only slander and slander their masters, so I don't know what villains are slandering rumors. Jia Zhen thought that Yifeng heard some bad words, and she wanted to avoid some suspicions. Now she actually divided the house and ordered Jia Qiang to move out of the Ning Mansion, and went to live on her own. This Jia Qiang is beautiful on the outside and smart on the inside. Although she came to school under the name, she was just hiding her eyes. Still a cockfighting lackey, watching flowers and playing with willows. He always relied on Jia Zhen to dote on him and Jia Rong to help him, so no one from the clan would dare to come against him. Since he is the best with Jia Rong, how can he agree to see someone bullying Qin Zhong now? Now that I want to stand up to report the injustice, I think about it in my heart and think: ""Jin Rong, Jia Rui and others are all acquaintances of Uncle Xue. Xiangri and I are friends with Uncle Xue. If I was in my early years, they would tell the old man. Xue, don't we hurt the peace? We don't care, such rumors are boring. Now why don't you use a plan to subdue, and stop talking, but it won't hurt your face."" After thinking about it, he also pretended to be a little respectful and walked outside, Quietly called Baoyu's book boy named Mingyan to his side, and so on and so forth.","This person was, in fact, one whose name was Chia Se; a grandson likewise of a main branch of the Ning mansion. His parents had died at an early period, and he had, ever since his youth, lived with Chia Chen. He had at this time grown to be sixteen years of age, and was, as compared with Chia Jung, still more handsome and good looking. These two cousins were united by ties of the closest intimacy, and were always together, whether they went out or stayed at home. The inmates of the Ning mansion were many in number, and their opinions of a mixed kind; and that whole bevy of servants, devoid as they were of all sense of right, solely excelled in the practice of inventing stories to backbite their masters; and this is how some mean person or other again, who it was is not known, insinuated slanderous and opprobrious reports (against Chia Se). Chia Chen had, presumably, also come to hear some unfavourable criticisms (on his account), and having, of course, to save himself from odium and suspicion, he had, at this juncture, after all, to apportion him separate quarters, and to bid Chia Se move outside the Ning mansion, where he went and established a home of his own to live in. This Chia Se was handsome as far as external appearances went, and intelligent withal in his inward natural gifts, but, though he nominally came to school, it was simply however as a mere blind; for he treated, as he had ever done, as legitimate occupations, such things as cock fighting, dog-racing and visiting places of easy virtue. And as, above, he had Chia Chen to spoil him by over-indulgence; and below, there was Chia Jung to stand by him, who of the clan could consequently presume to run counter to him? Seeing that he was on the closest terms of friendship with Chia Jung, how could he reconcile himself to the harsh treatment which he now saw Ch’in Chung receive from some persons? Being now bent upon pushing himself forward to revenge the injustice, he was, for the time, giving himself up to communing with his own heart. “Chin Jung, Chia Jui and the rest are,” he pondered, “friends of uncle Hsueeh, but I too am on friendly terms with him, and he with me, and if I do come forward and they tell old Hsueeh, won’t we impair the harmony which exists between us? and if I don’t concern myself, such idle tales make, when spoken, every one feel uncomfortable; and why shouldn’t I now devise some means to hold them in check, so as to stop their mouths, and prevent any loss of face!” Having concluded this train of thought, he also pretended that he had to go out, and, walking as far as the back, he, with low voice, called to his side Ming Yen, the page attending upon Pao-yue in his studies, and in one way and another, he made use of several remarks to egg him on.","But one heroic soul was moved to mighty anger by his wanton words. This was Jia Qiang, a member of the Ning-guo branch of the family of the same generation as Jia Rong. He had lost both his parents when a small child and been brought up by Cousin Zhen. At sixteen he was even more handsome and dashing than Jia Rong and the two youths were inseparable friends. Any establishment as large as the Ning household always contains a few disgruntled domestics who specialize in traducing their masters, and a number of disagreeable rumours concerning Jia Qiang did in fact begin to circulate among the servants which seem to have reached the ears of Cousin Zhen, for, partly in self-defence (since they involved him too), he moved Jia Qiang out of the house and set him up in a small establishment of his own somewhere in the city. Jia Qiang possessed a very shrewd brain under his daz-zlingly handsome exterior. His attendance at the school, however, was no more than a blind to his other activities, principal among which were cock-fighting, dog-racing, and botanizing excursions into the Garden of Pleasure; but with a doting Cousin Zhen to protect him on the one hand and Jia Rong to aid and comfort him on the other, there was no one in the clan who dared thwart him in anything he did. Since Qin Zhong was the brother-in-law of his best friend, Jia Qiang was naturally unwilling to stand by and see him abused in so despiteful a manner without doing anything to help. On the other hand he reflected that there would be certain disadvantages in coming forward as his champion. ‘Jokey Jin, Jia Rui, and that lot are all friends of Uncle Xue,’ he thought. ‘For that matter, I’m a friend of Uncle Xue myself. If I openly stick up for Qin Zhong and they go and tell old Xue, it’ll make things rather awkward between us. On the other hand, if I don’t interfere at all, Jokey Jin’s rumours are going to get quite out of hand. This calls for a stratagem of some kind which will shut the little beast up without causing too much embarrassment afterwards.’ Having thought of a plan, he pretended that he wanted to be excused, and slipping round to the back, quietly called over Bao-yu’s little page Tealeaf and whispered a few inflammatory words in his ear."
有鳳來儀　賜名曰瀟湘館,"A phoenix came to the ceremony, named Xiaoxiang Pavilion",Changing also the text: “A phoenix comes with dignified air for the Hsiao Hsiang Lodge.”,Those of ‘The Hopeful Sign’ she gave the name ‘Washbrook Farm’.
這裏鳳姐兒又勸解了秦氏一番，又低低的說了許多衷腸話兒。尤氏打發人請了兩三遍，鳳姐兒纔向秦氏說道：「你好生養著罷，我再來看你。合該你這病要好，所以前日就有人薦了這個好大夫來，再也是不怕的了。」秦氏笑道：「任憑是神僊也罷，治得病治不得命。嬸子，我知道我這病不過是挨日子。」鳳姐兒說道：「你只管這麼想著，病那裏能好呢？總要想開了纔是。況且聽得大夫說，若是不治，怕的是春天不好呢。如今纔九月半，還有四五個月的工夫，什麼病治不好呢？咱們若是不能喫人參的人家，這也難說了；你公公婆婆聽見治得好你，別說一日二錢人參，就是二斤也能夠喫的起。好生養著罷，我過園子裏去了。」秦氏又道：「嬸子，恕我不能跟過去了。閑了時候還求嬸子常過來瞧瞧我，咱們娘兒們坐坐，多說幾遭話兒。」鳳姐兒聽了，不覺得又眼圈兒一紅，遂說道：「我得了閑兒必常來看你。」,"Here, Sister Feng persuaded Qin Shi again, and said a lot of heartfelt words in a low voice. You sent someone to invite him two or three times, and then Sister Feng said to Qin, ""You are well, and I will come to see you again. It's time for your illness to be better, so someone recommended this good doctor the day before yesterday. Don't be afraid anymore."" Qin Shi smiled and said, ""No matter if you are an immortal, you can't cure a disease. Auntie, I know that my disease is just a matter of time."" Sister Feng said, ""Just think about it like this, the disease can be cured. All right? You have to think about it. Besides, I heard the doctor say that if you don't treat it, you are afraid that the spring will not be good. It's only half of September, and there are still four or five months to go. What kind of disease can't be cured? If we can't eat ginseng, it's hard to say; your parents-in-law heard that you were cured, let alone two dollars a day of ginseng, you can eat two pounds of ginseng. Just keep it alive, I'll go to the garden Qin Shi said again, ""Auntie, forgive me for not being able to follow me. When I'm free, I beg my auntie to come and see me often. Let's sit down and talk more."" Sister Feng heard this, but she didn't feel it again. With red eyes, he said, ""I will come to see you often when I get Xian'er.""","When Chia Jung heard this remark, he promptly crossed over with Pao-yue into the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, while lady Feng went on both to cheer her up for a time, and to impart to her, in an undertone, a good deal of confidential advice. Mrs. Yu had despatched servants, on two or three occasions, to hurry lady Feng, before she said to Mrs. Ch’in: “Do all you can to take good care of yourself, and I’ll come and see you again. You’re bound to get over this illness; and now, in fact, that you’ve come across that renowned doctor, you have really nothing more to fear.” “He might,” observed Mrs. Ch’in as she smiled, “even be a supernatural being and succeed in healing my disease, but he won’t be able to remedy my destiny; for, my dear aunt, I feel sure that with this complaint of mine, I can do no more than drag on from day to day.” “If you encourage such ideas,” remonstrated lady Feng, “how can this illness ever get all right? What you absolutely need is to cast away all these notions, and then you’ll improve. I hear moreover that the doctor asserts that if no cure be effected, the fear is of a change for the worse in spring, and not till then. Did you and I moreover belong to a family that hadn’t the means to afford any ginseng, it would be difficult to say how we could manage to get it; but were your father and mother-in-law to hear that it’s good for your recovery, why not to speak of two mace of ginseng a day, but even two catties will be also within their means! So mind you do take every care of your health! I’m now off on my way into the garden.” “Excuse me, my dear aunt,” added Mrs. Ch’in, “that I can’t go with you; but when you have nothing to do, I entreat you do come over and see me! and you and I can sit and have a long chat.” After lady Feng had heard these words, her eyes unwillingly got quite red again. “When I’m at leisure","she said. ‘I shall come again. I feel sure that you are meant to get better. It can’t have been an accident that they found that doctor the other day; and now that you’ve got him, there’s really nothing to worry about.’ Qin-shi smiled. ‘Even if he’s a miracle-man, Auntie, “death’s a sickness none can cure”, and I know that it’s just a question of time now.’ ‘If you will go on talking like that, how can you possibly get better?’ said Xi-feng. ‘If only you would try to look on the bright side. Remember what the doctor said. He said that if you weren’t being properly treated, next spring would be dangerous for you. If this were a household which couldn’t afford things like ginseng for your treatment, you might have something to worry about. But now they know that you can be cured, there’s nothing Rong’s parents wouldn’t do and nothing they couldn’t afford to do for you. Never mind two drams of ginseng a day; if you needed two pounds a day, they would get it for you gladly. So do try and get better! I must go over to the garden now.’ ‘Forgive me for not being able to see you out, Auntie,’ said Qin-shi. ‘Please come again when you are free. We’ll have a nice talk together, just the two of us.’ There were tears in Xi-feng’s eyes as she promised to come often, whenever she was free."
林黛玉並丫頭們都唬慌了，忙去報知王夫人、賈母等。此時王子騰的夫人也在這裏，都一齊來時，寶玉益發拿刀弄杖，尋死覓活的，鬧得天翻地覆。賈母、王夫人見了，唬的抖衣而顫，且「兒」一聲「肉」一聲放聲慟哭。於是驚動諸人，連賈赦、邢夫人、賈珍、賈政、賈璉、賈蓉、賈蕓、賈萍、薛姨媽、薛蟠並周瑞家的一干家中上上下下裏裏外外眾媳婦丫頭等，都來園內看視。,"Lin Daiyu and the girls panicked and rushed to report to Madam Wang, Mother Jia, etc. At this time, Wang Ziteng's wife was also here, and when they all came together, Baoyu increasingly took a knife and a stick, looking for life and death, causing the world to turn upside down. When Mother Jia and Madam Wang saw it, they shook their clothes and shivered, and cried loudly. So everyone was disturbed, including Jia She, Mrs. Xing, Jia Zhen, Jia Zheng, Jia Lian, Jia Rong, Jia Yun, Jia Ping, Aunt Xue, Xue Pan, and the whole family of Zhou Rui's family. , come to the park to see.","Tai-yue and the servant-girls were full of consternation, and, with all possible haste, they ran and apprised Madame Wang and dowager lady Chia. Wang Tzu-t’eng ’s wife was, at this time, also with them, so they all came in a body to see him. Pao-yue behaved more and more as if determined to clutch a sword or seize a spear to put an end to his existence. He raged in a manner sufficient to subvert the heavens and upset the earth. As soon as dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang caught sight of him, they were struck with terror. They trembled wildly like a piece of clothing that is being shaken. Uttering a shout of: “My son,” and another of: “My flesh,” they burst out into a loud fit of crying. Presently, all the inmates were seized with fright. Even Chia She, Madame Hsing, Chia Cheng, Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Chia Jung, Chia Yuen, Chia P’ing, Mrs. Hsueeh, Hsueeh P’an, Chou Jui’s wife, and the various members of the household, whether high or low, and the servant-girls and married women too, rushed into the garden to see what was up.","Dai-yu and the maids were terrified and ran to tell Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia. Wang Zi-teng’s lady was with them and hurried over with the rest to see him. By the time they arrived he had already tried several times to kill himself and was raving like a madman. His mother and grandmother were so stricken by the sight that for a few moments they stood mute and trembling. Then, breaking into loud weeping, they cried out to him piteously between their sobs: ‘my son!’ , ‘my child!’ , ‘my darling!’"
一句未了，鳳姐走進院來，因見平兒在窗外，就問道：「要說話兩個人不在屋裏說，怎麼跑出一個來，隔著窗子，是什麼意思？」賈璉在窗內接道：「你可問他，倒象屋裏有老虎喫他呢。」平兒道：「屋裏一個人沒有，我在他跟前作什麼？」鳳姐兒笑道：「正是沒人才好呢。」平兒聽說，便說道：「這話是說我呢？」鳳姐笑道：「不說你說誰？」平兒道：「別叫我說出好話來了。」說著，也不打簾子讓鳳姐，自己先摔簾子進來，往那邊去了。鳳姐自掀簾子進來，說道：「平兒瘋魔了。這蹄子認真要降伏我，仔細你的皮要緊！」賈璉聽了，已絕倒在炕上，拍手笑道：「我竟不知平兒這麼利害，從此倒服他了。」鳳姐道：「都是你慣的他，我只和你說！」賈璉聽說忙道：「你兩個不卯，又拿我來作人。我躲開你們。」鳳姐道：「我看你躲到那裏去。」賈璉道：「我就來。」鳳姐道：「我有話和你商量。」不知商量何事，且聽下回分解。正是：淑女從來多抱怨，嬌妻自古便含酸。,"Before the sentence was finished, Sister Feng walked into the courtyard. Seeing Ping'er outside the window, she asked, ""If you want to talk with two people who are not in the room, why do you run out of one? What does it mean by the window?"" Jia Lian was at the window. The inside said: ""You can ask him, it's like there are tigers in the house eating him."" Ping'er said: ""There is no one in the house, what am I doing in front of him?"" Feng Jie'er smiled and said, ""It's good that no one is there. What?"" When Ping'er heard it, she said, ""What do you mean by me?"" Sister Feng smiled and said, ""Who are you talking about?"" Ping'er said, ""Don't ask me to say something nice."" , and didn't slap the curtain to let Sister Feng, she threw the curtain first and went in there. Sister Feng lifted the curtain and came in and said, ""Ping'er is crazy. This hoof is serious about subduing me. It's important to be careful with your skin!"" Since then, I will obey him."" Sister Feng said, ""You are used to him, I will only tell you!"" Jia Lian heard that and said quickly, ""You two are not, so you use me as a person. I will avoid you. Sister Feng said, ""I see you hiding there."" Jia Lian said, ""I'll come."" Sister Feng said, ""I have something to discuss with you."" Exactly: ladies have always complained, and sweet wives have been sour since ancient times.","This sentence was scarcely at an end, when lady Feng walked into the court. “If you’re bent upon chatting,” she urgently inquired, upon seeing P’ing Erh outside the window, “why don’t you go into the room? and what do you mean, instead, by running out, and speaking with the window between?” Chia Lien from inside took up the string of the conversation. “You should ask her,” he said. “It would verily seem as if there were a tiger in the room to eat her up.” “There’s not a single person in the room,” P’ing Erh rejoined, “and what shall I stay and do with him?” “It’s just the proper thing that there should be no one else! Isn’t it?” lady Feng remarked grinning sarcastically. “Do these words allude to me?” P’ing Erh hastily asked, as soon as she had heard what she said. Lady Feng forthwith laughed. “If they don’t allude to you,” she continued, “to whom do they?” “Don’t press me to come out with some nice things!” P’ing Erh insinuated, and, as she spoke, she did not even raise the portiere (for lady Feng to enter), but straightway betook herself to the opposite side. Lady Feng lifted the portiere with her own hands, and walked into the room. “That girl P’ing Erh,” she exclaimed, “has gone mad, and if this hussey does in real earnest wish to try and get the upper hand of me, it would be well for you to mind your skin.” Chia Lien listened to her, as he kept reclining on the couch. “I never in the least knew,” he ventured, clapping his hands and laughing, “that P’ing Erh was so dreadful; and I must, after all, from henceforth look up to her with respect!” “It’s all through your humouring her,” lady Feng rejoined; “so I’ll simply settle scores with you and finish with it.” “Ts’ui!” ejaculated Chia Lien at these words, “because you two can’t agree, must you again make a scapegoat of me! Well then, I’ll get out of the way of both of you!” “I’ll see where you’ll go and hide,” lady Feng observed. “I’ve got somewhere to go!” Chia Lien added; and with these words, he was about to go, when lady Feng urged: “Don’t be off ! I have something to tell you.” What it is, is not yet known, but, reader, listen to the account given in the next chapter.","Just at that moment Xi-feng stepped into the courtyard and saw Patience standing outside the window. ‘If you want to talk,’ she said,’ why not talk inside the room ? What’s the idea of running outside and bawling through the window ?’ ‘Don’t ask her!’ said Jia Lian’s voice from inside. ‘ She thinks there’s a tiger in the room and she’s afraid of being eaten!’ ‘He’s in there on his own,’ said Patience. ‘What should I be doing in there with him ?’ ‘All the more reason for being in there, I should have thought, if he’s on his own,’ said Xi-feng, smiling rather spitefully. ‘Is that remark intended for me?’ said Patience. ‘Who else?’ said Xi-feng. ‘You’ll make me say something I shall feel sorry for in a minute,’ said Patience; and instead of standing aside and raising the door-blind for her mistress, she entered ahead of her, dropped it rudely in her face, and marched angrily through the sitting-room to one of the rooms at the back. ‘What’s the matter with Patience? The girl’s gone mad!’ said Xi-feng when she had raised the blind again and let herself in. ‘I really do believe she is trying to displace me. You’d better look out, my friend: I’ll have the hide off you!’ ‘Bravo! Good for Patience!’ said Jia Lian, who had retreated on to the kang and was applauding the comedy from that safer eminence. ‘I didn’t know she had it in her. In future I shall take that girl more seriously.’ ‘It’s you who’ve let her get above herself,’ said Xi-feng. ‘I hold you directly responsible for this!’ ‘Oh no!’ said Jia Lian. ‘If you two want to quarrel, I’m not going to stand between you and take all the knocks. I’m getting out of here!’ ‘I’m sure I don’t know where you think you’ll go to,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Don’t you worry, I’ve got somewhere to go to,’ said Jia Lian, and he began to go; but Xi-feng stopped him. ‘No, don’t go! There’s something else I want to talk to you about.’ But if you want to know what it was, you will have to wait for the next chapter."
說話時，寶玉已是三杯過去了。李嬤嬤又上來攔阻。寶玉正在高興之時，和寶黛姊妹說說笑笑的，那肯不喫。寶玉只得屈意央告：「好媽媽，我再喫兩鍾就不喫了。」李嬤嬤道：「你可仔細，老爺今兒在家呢，提防問你的書！」寶玉聽了此話，便心中大不自在，慢慢的放下酒杯，垂了頭。黛玉先忙說道：「別掃大家的興！舅舅若叫你，只說姨媽留著呢。這個媽媽，他喫了酒，又拿我們來醒脾了！」一面悄推寶玉，使他賭氣；一面悄悄的咕噥說「別理那老貨，咱們只管樂咱們的」。那李嬤嬤素知黛玉的，因說道：「林姐兒，你不要助著他了。你倒勸勸他，只怕他還聽些。」林黛玉冷笑道：「我為什麼助他？我也不犯著助他，我也不犯著勸他。你這媽媽太小心了，往常老太太又給他酒喫，如今在姨媽這裏多喫一口，料也不妨事。」又言：「姨太太這裏，況又不常在這裏的，你必要管著，想是怕姨太太這裏慣了他，也未可知？」李嬤嬤聽了，又是急，又是笑，說道：「真真這林姐兒，說出一句話來，比刀子還尖呢。你這算什麼。」寶釵也忍不住笑著，把黛玉腮上一擰，說道：「真真這個顰丫頭的一張嘴，叫人惱不是，喜歡又不是。」薛姨媽一面又說：「別怕，別怕，我的兒！來了這裏沒好的給你喫，別把這點子東西唬的存在心裏，倒叫我不安。只管放心喫，都有我呢。越發喫了晚飯去，便醉了，就跟著我睡罷。」因命：「再燙熱酒來！姨媽陪你喫兩杯，可就喫飯罷。」寶玉聽了，方又鼓起興來。,"When he spoke, Baoyu had already passed three cups. Mammy Li came up again to stop her. When Baoyu was happy, she was chatting and laughing with Sister Baodai, but she would not eat it. Baoyu had no choice but to plead, ""Good mother, I won't eat it for another two minutes."" Mammy Li said, ""Be careful, Master is at home today. Beware of asking about your book!"" Baoyu heard this and said, Feeling very uncomfortable, he slowly put down the wine glass and bowed his head. Daiyu hurriedly said, ""Don't spoil everyone's happiness! If your uncle calls you, just say that your aunt keeps it. This mother, he drank alcohol and used us to wake him up!"" Quietly muttered, ""Don't pay attention to that old guy, let's just make fun of us"". That Li Ma, who knew Daiyu well, said: ""Sister Lin, don't help him. You persuade him, I'm afraid he will listen."" Lin Daiyu sneered: ""Why should I help him? I Don't try to help him, and I don't try to persuade him. Your mother is too careful, the old lady used to give him wine again, but now he eats one more bite at my aunt's place, so I don't think it will be a problem."" He added, ""Here, my auntie, It's not often here, so you have to take care of it, I think it's because you're afraid that your concubine will get used to him here, and you don't know?"" When Li Ma heard this, she was anxious and laughed, and said, ""It's really, Sister Lin. , to say a word, it's sharper than a knife. What are you?"" Baochai couldn't help laughing, and twisted Daiyu's cheeks, saying, ""It's really the mouth of this frowning girl. I’m not angry, but I don’t like it.” Aunt Xue said again, “Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, my son! It’s not good for you to come here, don’t keep this idea in your heart, it makes me uneasy. As long as you can rest assured to eat, it’s all about me. The more you eat dinner, the more you get drunk, so just sleep with me.” As fate would have it: “Come on with hot wine! Auntie will accompany you to have two glasses, but just eat.” Baoyu Hearing this, Fang cheered up again.","While they were conversing, Pao-yue had taken so much as three cups of wine, and nurse Li came forward again to prevent him from having any more. Pao-yue was just then in a state of exultation and excitement, (a state) enhanced by the conversation and laughter of his cousins, so that was he ready to agree to having no more! But he was constrained in a humble spirit to entreat for permission. “My dear nurse,” he implored, “I’ll just take two more cups and then have no more.” “You’d better be careful,” added nurse Li, “your father is at home to-day, and see that you’re ready to be examined in your lessons.” When Pao-yue heard this mention, his spirits at once sank within him, and gently putting the wine aside, he dropped his head upon his breast. Tai-yue promptly remonstrated. “You’ve thrown cold water,” she said, “over the spirits of the whole company; why, if uncle should ask to see you, well, say that aunt Hsueeh detained you. This old nurse of yours has been drinking, and again makes us the means of clearing her muddled head!” While saying this, she gave Pao-yue a big nudge with the intent of stirring up his spirits, adding, as she addressed him in a low tone of voice: “Don’t let us heed that old thing, but mind our own enjoyment.” Dame Li also knew very well Tai-yue’s disposition, and therefore remarked: “Now, Miss Lin, don’t you urge him on; you should after all, give him good advice, as he may, I think, listen to a good deal of what you say to him.” “Why should I urge him on?” rejoined Lin Tai-yue, with a sarcastic smile, “nor will I trouble myself to give him advice. You, old lady, are far too scrupulous! Old lady Chia has also time after time given him wine, and if he now takes a cup or two more here, at his aunt’s, lady Hsueeh’s house , there’s no harm that I can see. Is it perhaps, who knows, that aunt is a stranger in this establishment, and that we have in fact no right to come over here to see her?” Nurse Li was both vexed and amused by the words she had just heard. “Really,” she observed, “every remark this girl Lin utters is sharper than a razor! I didn’t say anything much!” Pao Ch’ai too could not suppress a smile, and as she pinched Tai-yue’s cheek, she exclaimed, “Oh the tongue of this frowning girl! one can neither resent what it says, nor yet listen to it with any gratification!” “Don’t be afraid!” Mrs. Hsueeh went on to say, “don’t be afraid; my son, you’ve come to see me, and although I’ve nothing good to give you, you mustn’t, through fright, let the trifle you’ve taken lie heavy on your stomach, and thus make me uneasy; but just drink at your pleasure, and as much as you like, and let the blame fall on my shoulders. What’s more, you can stay to dinner with me, and then go home; or if you do get tipsy, you can sleep with me, that’s all.” She thereupon told the servants to heat some more wine. “I’ll come,” she continued, “and keep you company while you have two or three cups, after which we’ll have something to eat!” It was only after these assurances that Pao-yue’s spirits began at length, once more to revive, and dame Li then directed the waiting-maids what to do.","Bao-yu had soon finished his third cup of wine and Nannie Li once more came forward to restrain him. But Bao-yu, who was now warm and happy and in the midst of a hilarious conversation with his cousins, was naturally unwilling to stop, and pleaded humbly with the old lady for a reprieve. ‘Nannie darling, just two more cups and then I’ll stop !’ ‘You’d better look out,’ said Nannie Li. ‘ Your father’s at home today. He’ll be asking you about your lessons before you know where you are.’ At these words all Bao-yu’s happiness drained away. Slowly he set down his cup and bowed his head in dejection. ‘Don’t spoil everyone’s enjoyment,’ said Dai-yu. ‘Even if Uncle does call for you, you can always say that Aunt Xue is keeping you. I think that old Nannie of yours has had a cup too many and is looking for a bit of excitement at our expense.’ She gave him a gentle nudge to encourage a more valiant spirit in him, muttering, as she did so, ‘Take no notice of the old fool I Let’s go on enjoying ourselves and not mind about her!’ Nannie Li knew only too well what Dai-yu was capable of. ‘Now Miss Lin,’ she said, ‘don’t you go taking his part! If you encourage him he’s only too likely to do what you say!’ Dai-yu smiled dangerously. ‘Take his part? Why should I want to encourage him? You are over-cautious, my dear Nannie. After all, Lady Jia often lets him drink; why should it matter if Mrs Xue lets him have a cup or two ? I suppose you think he can’t be trusted to drink here because Mrs Xue is not one of us ?’ Nannie Li did not know whether to feel upset or amused. ‘Really, Miss Lin. Some of the things you say cut sharper than a knife !’ Bao-chai could not suppress a giggle. She pinched Dai-yu’s cheek playfully. ‘Really, Miss Frowner, the things you say! One doesn’t know whether to grind one’s teeth or laugh!’ Aunt Xue laughed too. ‘Don’t be afraid, my boy! Heaven knows I’ve got little enough to offer you when you come to see me. You mustn’t get upset over a small thing like this, or I shall feel quite uncomfortable. Drink as much as you like; I’ll look after you! You may as well stay to supper, in any case; and even if you do get drunk, you can always spend the night here.’ She told a maid to heat some more wine.’ There! Auntie will drink a cup or two with you, and then we shall have some supper.’ Bao-yu’s spirits began to revive a bit under his aunt’s encouragement."
因東邊寧府中花園內梅花盛開，賈珍之妻尤氏乃治酒，請賈母、邢夫人、王夫人等賞花。是日先攜了賈蓉之妻，二人來面請。賈母等於早飯後過來，就在會芳園遊頑，先茶後酒，不過皆是寧榮二府女眷家宴小集，並無別樣新文趣事可記。,"Because the plum blossoms are in full bloom in the garden of Ningfu in the east, Jia Zhen's wife You Shi is a winemaker and invites Jia Mu, Mrs. Xing, Mrs. Wang and others to enjoy the flowers. It was the first day that he brought Jia Rong's wife, and the two came to invite him. Mother Jia came over after breakfast, and was wandering in Huifang Garden, first tea and then wine, but it was a small collection of family banquets for the female family members of the Ningrong Second House, and there was nothing new and interesting to remember.","As the plum blossom, in the eastern part of the garden of the Ning mansion, was in full bloom, Chia Chen’s spouse, Mrs. Yu, made preparations for a collation, (purposing) to send invitations to dowager lady Chia, mesdames Hsing, and Wang, and the other members of the family, to come and admire the flowers; and when the day arrived the first thing she did was to take Chia Jung and his wife, the two of them, and come and ask them round in person. Dowager lady Chia and the other inmates crossed over after their early meal; and they at once promenaded the Hui Fang (Concentrated Fragrance) Garden. First tea was served, and next wine; but the entertainment was no more than a family banquet of the kindred of the two mansions of Ning and Jung, so that there was a total lack of any novel or original recreation that could be put on record.","The winter plum in the gardens of the Ning Mansion was now at its best, and this particular day Cousin Zhen’s wife, You-shi, had some wine taken into the gardens and came over in person, bringing her son Jia Rong and his young wife with her, to invite Grandmother Jia, Lady Xing and Lady Wang to a flower-viewing party. Grandmother Jia and the rest went round as soon as they had finished their breakfast. The party was in the All-scents Garden. It began with tea and continued with wine, and as it was a family gathering confined to the ladies of the Ning and Rong households, nothing particularly worth recording took place."
這裏寶玉拉著林黛玉的袖子，衹是嘻嘻的笑，心裏有話，衹是口裏說不出來。此時黛玉心裏也有幾分明白，衹是自己禁不住把臉紅漲起來，掙著要走。寶玉忽然「噯喲」了一聲，說：「好頭疼！」林黛玉道：「該，阿彌陀佛！」只見寶玉大叫一聲：「我要死！」將身一縱，離地跳有三四尺高，口內亂嚷亂叫，說起胡話來了。,"Here Baoyu was pulling Lin Daiyu's sleeve, just giggling, she had something in her heart, but she couldn't say it. At this time, Daiyu also had some understanding in her heart, but she couldn't help blushing, struggling to leave. Baoyu suddenly made an ""Aiyo"" and said, ""What a headache!"" Lin Daiyu said, ""Yes, Amitabha!"" I saw Baoyu shouting, ""I'm going to die!"" Gao, shouting and screaming in his mouth, talking nonsense.","During this time, Pao-yue clasped Tai-yue’s hand in his. He did nothing than smile. But not a word did he utter. Tai-yue naturally, therefore, got crimson in the face, and struggled to escape his importunities. “Ai-ya!” exclaimed Pao-yue. “How my head is sore!” “It should be!” rejoined Tai-yue. “O-mi-to-fu.” Pao-yue then gave vent to a loud shout. His body bounced three or four feet high from the ground. His mouth was full of confused shrieks. But all he said was rambling talk.","When they were alone together, Bao-yu took Dai-yu by the hand. He smiled and smiled, but said nothing. Dai-yu felt herself blushing, and tried to break away. ‘Aiyo!’ he said. ‘My head!’ ‘Good!’ said Dai-yu. ‘It serves you right!’ Then Bao-yu let out a dreadful cry, jumped two or three feet into the air, and began to shout and babble deliriously."
話說賈妃回宮，次日見駕謝恩，並回奏歸省之事，龍顏甚悅。又發內帑彩緞金銀等物，以賜賈政及各椒房等員，不必細說。,"It was said that Concubine Jia returned to the palace, and the next day she saw the driver to thank him and recounted the matter of returning to the province. Longyan was very happy. He also distributed inner purse, colored satin, gold and silver, etc., as gifts to Jia Zheng and other members of Jiaofang, so there is no need to go into details.","The Chia consort, we must now go on to explain, returned to the Palace, and the next day, on her appearance in the presence of His Majesty, she thanked him for his bounty and gave him furthermore an account of her experiences on her visit home. His Majesty’s dragon countenance was much elated, and he also issued from the privy store coloured satins, gold and silver and such like articles to be presented to Chia Cheng and the other officials in the various households of her relatives. But dispensing with minute details about them, we will now revert to the two mansions of Jung and Ning.","On the day following the Imperial Concubine’s return to the Palace, she called on the Emperor to offer thanks and gave him a full account of her Visitation. The Emperor was visibly pleased by her report and commanded that bounties of gold, silver and silks should be issued to Jia Zheng and the other fathers of visiting ladies by the Inner Treasury. But there is no need for us to pursue these matters in further detail."
正說著，只見秦業、秦鍾並尤氏的幾個眷屬尤氏姊妹也都來了。賈珍便命賈瓊、賈琛、賈璘、賈薔四個人去陪客，一面吩咐去請欽天監陰陽司來擇日。擇准停靈七七四十九日，三日後開喪送訃聞。這四十九日，單請一百單八眾禪僧在大廳上拜大悲懺，超度前亡後化諸魂，以免亡者之罪；另設一壇於天香樓上，是九十九位全真道士，打四十九日解冤洗業醮。然後停靈於會芳園中，靈前另外五十眾高僧、五十眾高道，對壇按七作好事。那賈敬聞得長孫媳死了，因自為早晚就要飛昇，如何肯又回家染了紅塵，將前功盡棄呢，因此並不在意，只憑賈珍料理。,"Just as he was talking, Qin Ye, Qin Zhong, and several of You's family members, You's sisters, all came. Jia Zhen ordered four people, Jia Qiong, Jia Chen, Jia Lin, and Jia Qiang, to accompany the guests, and ordered to invite the Yin and Yang Division of the Qintian Supervision to choose a day. Choose the right to stay for seven seven forty-nine days, and three days later, the funeral will be sent for the obituary. On these forty-nine days, one hundred and eight monks were invited to worship the Great Compassion and Repentance in the hall, to save the souls of the dead and to avoid the sins of the deceased. A true Taoist, fight for forty-nine days to resolve grievances and wash karma. After that, he stopped in the Huifang Garden. In front of the spirit, there were fifty other eminent monks and fifty high priests, doing good deeds to the altar. Then Jia Jing heard that his eldest grandson-in-law was dead, because he thought he was going to ascend sooner or later, how could he be willing to go home and get rid of the red dust, so he didn't care, and only depended on Jia Zhen to cook.","he exclaimed; “nothing is to be done, but what is within my means.” As they conversed, they perceived Ch’in Yeh and Ch’in Chung, as well as several relations of Mrs. Yu, arrive, together with Mrs. Yu’s sisters; and Chia Chen forthwith bade Chia Ch’ung, Chia Shen, Chia Lin and Chia Se, the four of them, to go and entertain the guests; while he, at the same time, issued directions to go and ask the Astrologer of the Imperial Observatory to come and choose the days for the ceremonies. (This Astrologer) decided that the coffin should remain in the house for seven times seven days, that is forty-nine days; that after the third day, the mourning rites should be begun and the formal cards should be distributed; that all that was to be done during these forty-nine days was to invite one hundred and eight Buddhist bonzes to perform, in the main Hall, the High Confession Mass, in order to ford the souls of departed relatives across the abyss of suffering, and afterwards to transmute the spirit (of Mrs. Ch’in); that, in addition, an altar should be erected in the Tower of Heavenly Fragrance, where nine times nine virtuous Taoist priests should, for nineteen days, offer up prayers for absolution from punishment, and purification from retribution. That after these services, the tablet should be moved into the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance, and that in the presence of the tablet, fifteen additional eminent bonzes and fifteen renowned Taoist Priests should confront the altar and perform meritorious deeds every seven days. The news of the death of the wife of his eldest grandson reached Chia Ching; but as he himself felt sure that, at no distant date, he would ascend to the regions above, he was loth to return again to his home, and so expose himself to the contamination of the world, as to completely waste the meritorious excellence","Cousin Zhen cried, somewhat theatrically. ‘Just take everything I have – everything!’ As he was speaking Qin Bang-ye and Qin Zhong arrived, and various members of You-shi’s family, including her two younger sisters. Cousin Zhen deputed Jia Qiong, Jia Chen, Jia Lin and Jia Qiang from among the younger men present to look after them and any other guests who might arrive. He also instructed someone to invite an expert from the Board of Astronomy to select dates for the funeral and the ceremonies preceding it. With the approval of this official it was decided that the lying in state should be for forty-nine days and that the notification of bereavement indicating the family’s readiness to receive official visits of condolence should be made in three days’ time. A hundred and eight Buddhist monks were engaged to perform a Grand Miseri-cordia for the salvation of all departed souls in the main reception hall of the mansion during these forty-nine days, while at the same time ninety-nine Taoist priests of the Quan-zhen sect were to perform ceremonies of purification and absolution at a separate altar in the Celestial Fragrance pavilion. These arrangements having been made, the body was moved to a temporary shrine in another pavilion of the All-scents Garden. Fifty high-ranking Buddhist monks and fifty high-ranking Taoist priests took turns in chanting and intoning before it on every seventh day. Nothing would induce old Jia Jing to return home when he learned of the death of his grandson’s wife. Immortality was within his grasp and he was not going to impair his hard-won sanctity with the taint of earthly pollution."
空空道人聽如此說，思忖半晌，將《石頭記》再檢閱一遍，因見上面雖有些指奸責佞、貶惡誅邪之語，亦非傷時罵世之旨；及至君仁臣良父慈子孝，凡倫常所關之處，皆是稱功頌德，眷眷無窮，實非別書之可比。雖其中大旨談情，亦不過實錄其事，又非假擬妄稱，一味婬邀艷約、私訂偷盟之可比。因毫不干涉時世，方從頭至尾抄錄回來，問世傳奇。因空見色，由色生情，傳情入色，自色悟空，空空道人遂易名為情僧，改《石頭記》為《情僧錄》。東魯孔梅溪則題曰《風月寶鑒》。後因曹雪芹於悼紅軒中披閱十載，增刪五次，纂成目錄，分出章回，則題曰《金陵十二釵》，並題一絕云：,"After hearing this, the Taoist Kong Kong thought for a while, and then reviewed the ""Stones"" again, because although there were some words of accusation, rebuke, and condemnation, they were not intended to hurt the times and curse the world. Kindness and filial piety, all the places where Fan Lun often closes are praised for merits and virtues, with endless family members, which is truly incomparable to other books. Although the main purpose of it is to talk about love, it is only a true record, and it is not a false claim, which is comparable to blindly lustful invitations and secret alliances. Because he did not interfere with the times, Fang copied it back from beginning to end, and the legend came out. Because of the emptiness to see the color, from the color to the love, the love to the color, from the color to Wukong, the Kongkong Taoist changed his name to the love monk, and changed the ""Stone Record"" to ""Love Monk Record"". East Lu Kong Meixi titled ""Fengyue Baojian"". Later, because Cao Xueqin read it in the Mourning Red Pavilion for ten years, he added and deleted five times, compiled it into a catalog, and divided chapters into chapters.","K’ung K’ung having pondered for a while over the words, to which he had listened intently, re-perused, throughout, this record of the stone; and finding that the general purport consisted of nought else than a treatise on love, and likewise of an accurate transcription of facts, without the least taint of profligacy injurious to the times, he thereupon copied the contents, from beginning to end, to the intent of charging the world to hand them down as a strange story. Hence it was that K’ung K’ung, the Taoist, in consequence of his perception, (in his state of ) abstraction, of passion, the generation, from this passion, of voluptuousness, the transmission of this voluptuousness into passion, and the apprehension, by means of passion, of its unreality, forthwith altered his name for that of “Ch’ing Tseng” (the Voluptuous Bonze), and changed the title of “the Memoir of a Stone” (Shih-t’ou-chi,) for that of “Ch’ing Tseng Lu,” The Record of the Voluptuous Bonze; while K’ung Mei-chi of Tung Lu gave it the name of “Feng Yueeh Pao Chien,” “The Precious Mirror of Voluptuousness.” In later years, owing to the devotion by Tsao Hsueeh-ch’in in the Tao Hung study, of ten years to the perusal and revision of the work, the additions and modifications effected by him five times, the affix of an index and the division into periods and chapters, the book was again entitled “Chin Ling Shih Erh Ch’ai,” “The Twelve Maidens of Chin Ling.” A stanza was furthermore composed for the purpose. This then, and no other, is the origin of the Record of the Stone. The poet says appositely:--","For a long time Vanitas stood lost in thought, pondering this speech. He then subjected the Story of the Stone to a careful second reading. He could see that its main theme was love; that it consisted quite simply of a true record of real events; and that it was entirely free from any tendency to deprave and corrupt. He therefore copied it all out from beginning to end and took it back with him to look for a publisher. As a consequence of all this, Vanitas, starting off in the Void (which is Truth) came to the contemplation of Form (which is Illusion); and from Form engendered Passion; and by communicating Passion, entered again into Form; and from Form awoke to the Void (which is Truth). He therefore changed his name from Vanitas to Brother Amor, or the Passionate Monk, (because he had approached Truth by way of Passion), and changed the title of the book from The Story of the Stone to The Tale of Brother Amor. Old Kong Mei-xi from the homeland of Confucius called the book A Mirror for the Romantic. Wu Yu-feng called it A Dream of Golden Days. Cao Xueqin in his Nostalgia Studio worked on it for ten years, in the course of which he rewrote it no less than five times, dividing it into chapters, composing chapter headings, renaming it The Twelve Beauties of Jinling, and adding an introductory quatrain. Red Inkstone restored the original title when he recopied the book and added his second set of annotations to it. This, then, is a true account of how The Story of the Stone came to be written."
那瘋跛道人聽了，拍掌笑道：「解得切，解得切！」士隱便說一聲「走罷！」將道人肩上褡褳搶了過來背著，竟不回家，同了瘋道人飄飄而去。當下烘動街坊，眾人當作一件新聞傳說。封氏聞得此信，哭個死去活來，只得與父親商議，遣人各處訪尋，那討音信？無奈何，少不得依靠著他父母度日。幸而身邊還有兩個舊日的丫鬟伏侍，主僕三人，日夜作些針線發賣，幫著父親用度。那封肅雖然日日抱怨，也無可奈何了。,"The mad lame Taoist heard it, clapped his hands and laughed, ""It's all right, it's all right!"" Shiyin said, ""Let's go!"" He snatched the shackles from the Taoist's shoulders and carried them on his back, but he didn't go home. The mad man fluttered away. At the moment, the neighborhood is stirred up, and everyone regards it as a news legend. When Feng Shi heard this letter, he cried so hard that he had to discuss with his father and send people to visit everywhere. What about the news? Helpless, he had to rely on his parents to get by. Fortunately, there are still two old maids and servants, three masters and servants, who sell some needles and thread day and night to help my father with expenses. Although Feng Su complained every day, he was helpless.","The crazy limping Taoist clapped his hands. “Your interpretation is explicit,” he remarked with a hearty laugh, “your interpretation is explicit!” Shih-yin promptly said nothing more than,--”Walk on;” and seizing the stole from the Taoist’s shoulder, he flung it over his own. He did not, however, return home, but leisurely walked away, in company with the eccentric priest. The report of his disappearance was at once bruited abroad, and plunged the whole neighbourhood in commotion; and converted into a piece of news, it was circulated from mouth to mouth. Dame Feng, Shih-yin’s wife, upon hearing the tidings, had such a fit of weeping that she hung between life and death; but her only alternative was to consult with her father, and to despatch servants on all sides to institute inquiries. No news was however received of him, and she had nothing else to do but to practise resignation, and to remain dependent upon the support of her parents for her subsistence. She had fortunately still by her side, to wait upon her, two servant girls, who had been with her in days gone by; and the three of them, mistress as well as servants, occupied themselves day and night with needlework, to assist her father in his daily expenses. This Feng Su had after all, in spite of his daily murmurings against his bad luck, no help but to submit to the inevitable.","‘A very accurate commentary !’ cried the mad, lame Taoist, clapping his hands delightedly. But Shi-yin merely snatched the satchel that hung from the other’s shoulder and slung it from his own, and with a shout of’ Let’s go!’ and without even waiting to call back home, he strode off into the wide world in the company of the madman. This event made a great uproar in the little town, and news of it was relayed from gossip to gossip until it reached the ears of Mrs Zhen, who cried herself into fits when she heard it. After consulting her father, she sent men out to inquire everywhere after her husband; but no news of him was to be had. It was now imperative that she should move in with her parents and look to them for support. Fortunately she still had the two maids who had stayed on with her from the Soochow days, and by sewing and embroidering morning, noon and night, she and her women were able to make some contribution to her father’s income. The latter still found daily occasion to complain, but there was very little he could do about it."
劉姥姥只聽見咯當咯當的響聲，大有似乎打籮櫃篩面的一般，不免東瞧西望的。忽見堂屋中柱子上掛著一個匣子，底下又墜著一個秤砣般一物，卻不住的亂幌。劉姥姥心中想著：「這是什麼愛物兒？有甚用呢？」正呆時，只聽得當的一聲，又若金鐘銅磬一般，不防倒唬的一展眼。接著又是一連八九下。方欲問時，只見小丫頭子們齊亂跑，說：「奶奶下來了。」周瑞家的與平兒忙起身，命劉姥姥「只管等著，是時候我們來請你」。說著，都迎出去了。,"Grandma Liu only heard the sound of rattling, which seemed to be sifting through the sieves of the cabinet, and she couldn't help but look around. Suddenly, I saw a box hanging from a pillar in the main room, and a weight-like object falling from the bottom, but it couldn't stop messing up. Grandma Liu thought to herself, ""What kind of love is this? What's the use?"" When she was in a daze, she only heard a proper sound, and it was like a golden bell and a bronze chime. Then it was eight or nine in a row. When Fang Yu asked, he saw the little girls running around and saying, ""Grandma is down."" He Ping'er from Zhou Rui's family hurriedly got up and ordered Grandma Liu to ""just wait, it's time for us to invite you."" Having said that, they all went out.","After they had partaken of it, old goody Liu could hear nothing but a “lo tang, lo tang” noise, resembling very much the sound of a bolting frame winnowing flour, and she could not resist looking now to the East, and now to the West. Suddenly in the great Hall, she espied, suspended on a pillar, a box at the bottom of which hung something like the weight of a balance, which incessantly wagged to and fro. “What can this thing be?” communed goody Liu in her heart , “What can be its use?” While she was aghast, she unexpectedly heard a sound of “tang” like the sound of a golden bell or copper cymbal, which gave her quite a start. In a twinkle of the eyes followed eight or nine consecutive strokes; and she was bent upon inquiring what it was, when she caught sight of several waiting-maids enter in a confused crowd. “Our lady has come down!” they announced. P’ing Erh, together with Chou Jui’s wife, rose with all haste. “Old goody Liu,” they urged, “do sit down and wait till it’s time, when we’ll come and ask you in.” Saying this, they went out to meet lady Feng.","Grannie Liu’s attention was distracted by a persistent tock tock tock tock not unlike the sound made by a flour-bolting machine, and she could not forbear glancing round her from time to time to see where it came from. Presently she caught sight of a sort of boxlike object fastened to one of the central pillars of the room, and a thing like the weight of a steelyard hanging down from it, which swung to and fro in ceaseless motion and appeared to be the source of the noise which had distracted her. ‘I wonder what that can be,’ she thought to herself, ‘and what it can be used for?’ As she studied the strange box, it suddenly gave forth a loud dongi like the sound of a bronze bell or a copper chime, which so startled the old lady that her eyes nearly popped out of her head. The dongl was followed in rapid succession by eight or nine others, and Grannie Liu was on the point of asking what it meant, when all the maids in the house began scurrying about shouting, ‘The mistress I The mistress! She’ll be coming out now!’ and Patience and Zhou Rui’s wife hurriedly rose to their feet. ‘Just stay here, Grannie,’ they said. ‘When it is time for you to see her, we shall come in and fetch you’; and they went off with the other servants to greet their mistress."
黛玉方進入房時，只見兩個人攙著一位鬢髮如銀的老母迎上來，黛玉便知是他外祖母。方欲拜見時，早被他外祖母一把摟入懷中，心肝兒肉叫著大哭起來。當下地下侍立之人，無不掩面涕泣，黛玉也哭個不住。一時眾人慢慢解勸住了，黛玉方拜見了外祖母。此即冷子興所云之史氏太君，賈赦賈政之母也。當下賈母一一指與黛玉：「這是你大舅母；這是你二舅母；這是你先珠大哥的媳婦珠大嫂子。」黛玉一一拜見過。賈母又說：「請姑娘們來。今日遠客纔來，可以不必上學去了。」眾人答應了一聲，便去了兩個。,"When Daiyufang entered the room, she saw two people coming up with an old mother with silver hair on the temples, and Daiyu knew it was his grandmother. When Fang Yu met, he was hugged by his grandmother long ago, and his heart was screaming and crying. The people who were standing in the underground at the moment all covered their faces and wept, and Daiyu couldn't stop crying. For a while, everyone slowly persuaded them to stop, and Dai Yufang visited her grandmother. This is the Taijun of the Shi clan, whom Leng Zixing talked about, and the mother of Jia She and Jia Zheng. Immediately, Mother Jia pointed to Daiyu one by one: ""This is your first aunt; this is your second aunt; this is your elder brother Xianzhu's daughter-in-law, sister-in-law Zhu."" Daiyu met them one by one. Mother Jia also said, ""Please come, the girls. The guests from afar are here today, so you don't have to go to school."" Everyone agreed and went to two.","my darling!) she began to sob aloud. The bystanders too, at once, without one exception, melted into tears; and Tai-yue herself found some difficulty in restraining her sobs. Little by little the whole party succeeded in consoling her, and Tai-yue at length paid her obeisance to her grandmother. Her ladyship thereupon pointed them out one by one to Tai-yue. “This,” she said, “is the wife of your uncle, your mother’s elder brother; this is the wife of your uncle, her second brother; and this is your eldest sister-in-law Chu, the wife of your senior cousin Chu.” Tai-yue bowed to each one of them (with folded arms). “Ask the young ladies in,” dowager lady Chia went on to say; “tell them a guest from afar has just arrived, one who comes for the first time; and that they may not go to their lessons.” The servants with one voice signified their obedience, and two of them speedily went to carry out her orders.","As Dai-yu entered the room she saw a silver-haired old lady advancing to meet her, supported on either side by a servant. She knew that this must be her Grandmother Jia and would have fallen on her knees and made her kotow, but before she could do so her grandmother had caught her in her arms and pressing her to her bosom with cries of ‘My pet!’ and ‘My poor lamb!’ burst into loud sobs, while all those present wept in sympathy, and Dai-yu felt herself crying as though she would never stop. It was some time before those present succeeded in calming them both down and Dai-yu was at last able to make her kotow. Grandmother Jia now introduced those present. ‘This is your elder uncle’s wife, Aunt Xing. This is your Uncle Zheng’s wife, Aunt Wang. This is Li Wan, the wife of your Cousin Zhu, who died.’ Dai-yu kotowed to each of them in turn. ‘Call the girls!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘Tell them that we have a very special visitor and that they need not do their lessons today.’ There was a cry of ‘Yes ma’am’ from the assembled maids, and two of them went off to do her bidding."
寶玉悵然無趣。只見鳳姐兒打發人來叫他兩個進去。鳳姐洗了手，換衣服抖灰，問他們換不換。寶玉不換，只得罷了。家下僕婦們將帶著行路的茶壺茶杯、十錦屜盒、各樣小食端來，鳳姐等喫過茶，待他們收拾完備，便起身上車。外面旺兒預備下賞封，賞了本村主人。莊婦等來叩賞。鳳姐並不在意，寶玉卻留心看時，內中並無二丫頭。一時上了車，出來走不多遠，只見迎頭二丫頭懷裏抱著他小兄弟，同著幾個小女孩子說笑而來。寶玉恨不得下車跟了他去，料是眾人不依的，少不得以目相送，爭奈車輕馬快，一時展眼無蹤。,"Baoyu was disappointed. I saw that Sister Feng sent someone to ask him to go in. Sister Feng washed her hands, changed her clothes and shook the dust, and asked them if they would change. Baoyu does not change, but only. The servants and maids brought teapots and cups, 10-brocade drawers, and various snacks for the journey. Sister Feng and others had eaten tea. Outside Wang'er prepared to give a reward to the owner of the village. Mrs. Zhuang waited for the reward. Sister Feng didn't care, but when Baoyu watched carefully, there were no two girls inside. He got into the car for a while, and didn't walk far, only to see the second girl in front of her holding his little brother in her arms, chatting and laughing with a few little girls. Baoyu could not wait to get out of the car and follow him, but it was expected that everyone would not follow him.","Pao-yue was the while feeling disappointed and unhappy, when he espied a servant, whom lady Feng had sent, come and call them both in. Lady Feng had washed her hands and changed her costume; and asked him whether he would change or not, and Pao-yue, having replied “No! it doesn’t matter after all if I don’t change,” the female attendants served tea, cakes and fruits and also poured the scented tea. Lady Feng and the others drank their tea, and waiting until they had put the various articles by, and made all the preparations, they promptly started to get into their carriages. Outside, Wang Erh had got ready tips and gave them to the people of the farm, and the farm women and all the inmates went up to them to express their gratitude; but when Pao-yue came to look carefully, he failed to see anything of the lass who had reeled the thread. But they had not gone far before they caught sight of this girl Secunda coming along with a small child in her arms, who, they concluded, was her young brother, laughing and chatting, in company with a few young girls. Pao-yue could not suppress the voice of love, but being seated in the carriage, he was compelled to satisfy himself by following her with his eyes.","Bao-yu’s spirits were quite dashed by her abrupt departure. But just then someone came from Xi-feng inviting the boys indoors. They found her washed and changed. She asked them if they wanted to ‘change’ too, but Bao-yu replied that they did not. Then a variety of cakes and sweets were brought in by the servants, and fragrant tea was poured for them to drink. When the three had taken their fill of these refreshments and everything had been cleared away and repacked by the servants, they rose up and got back into their carriage. Outside in the yard Brightie handed the farmer’s family their payment, which he had brought with him ready-wrapped in coloured paper, and the womenfolk hurried up to the carriage to express their thanks. Bao-yu scanned their faces carefully, but could not see his spinning-girl amongst them. They had not driven far, however, when he caught sight of her at the end of the village. She was standing watching for him beside the road, a baby brother in her arms and two little girls at her side. Bao-yu could not repress a strong emotion on seeing her, but sitting there in the carriage there was not much he could do but gaze back at her soulfully; and soon, as the carriage bowled along at a smarter pace, Ertie was lost to sight for ever."
鳳姐兒是個聰明人，見他這個光景，如何不猜透八九分呢，因向賈瑞假意含笑道：「怨不得你哥哥時常提你，說你很好。今日見了，聽你說這幾句話兒，就知道你是個聰明和氣的人了。這會子我要到太太們那裏去，不得和你說話兒，等閑了咱們再說話兒罷。」賈瑞道：「我要到嫂子家裏去請安，又恐怕嫂子年輕，不肯輕易見人。」鳳姐兒假意笑道：「一家子骨肉，說什麼年輕不年輕的話。」賈瑞聽了這話，再不想到今日得這個奇遇，那神情光景亦發不堪難看了。鳳姐兒說道：「你快入席去罷，仔細他們拿住罰你酒。」賈瑞聽了，身上已木了半邊，慢慢的一面走著，一面回過頭來看。,"Sister Feng is a smart person. Seeing his situation, how can you not guess all the points? Yin Xiang Jia Rui pretended to smile and said, ""I can't blame your brother for always mentioning you and saying that you are very good. See you today and listen to what you have to say. Just a few words, I know that you are a smart and kind person. I'm going to the wives at this time, and I can't talk to you. Let's talk when we have time."" Jia Rui said, ""I'm going to my sister-in-law's house to greet you. I'm afraid that my sister-in-law is young and won't easily meet people."" Sister Feng pretended to smile: ""The whole family is flesh and blood, so what are you saying about being young or not."" After hearing this, Jia Rui didn't want to think of this adventure today. Unsightly. Sister Feng said, ""Just go to the table, and they will punish you for drinking carefully."" Jia Rui heard this, half of his body was numb, and he walked slowly while looking back.","As he spoke, he kept his gaze fixed on lady Feng, who being an intelligent person, could not but arrive, at the sight of his manner, at the whole truth in her surmises. “It isn’t to be wondered at,” she consequently observed, as she smiled hypocritically, “that your eldest brother should make frequent allusion to your qualities! for after seeing you on this occasion, and hearing you utter these few remarks, I have readily discovered what an intelligent and genial person you are! I am just now on my way to join the ladies on the other side, and have no leisure to converse with you; but wait until I’ve nothing to attend to, when we can meet again.” “I meant to have gone over to your place and paid my respects to you, sister-in-law,” pleaded Chia Jui, “but I was afraid lest a person of tender years like yourself mightn’t lightly receive any visitors!” Lady Feng gave another sardonic smile. “Relatives,” she continued, “of one family, as we are, what need is there to say anything of tender years?” After Chia Jui had heard these words, he felt his heart swell within him with such secret joy that he was urged to reflect: “I have at length to-day, when least I expected it, obtained this remarkable encounter with her!” But as the display of his passion became still more repulsive, lady Feng urged him to go. “Be off at once,” she remarked, “and join the entertainment; for mind, if they find you out, they will mulct you in so many glasses of wine!” By the time this suggestion had reached Chia Jui’s ears, half of his body had become stiff like a log of wood; and as he betook himself away, with lothful step, he turned his head round to cast glances at her.","Xi-feng’s sharp intelligence enabled her to penetrate without much difficulty the little game he was playing, and feigning an interest she did not feel, she answered him with a smile. ‘I can see why Lian is always speaking so highly of you. From seeing you today and just hearing you speak those few words I can tell at once that you are an intelligent, good-natured sort of person. At the moment I’m on my way to join my aunts, and I’m afraid that I can’t stay and talk to you. Perhaps we could meet some other time when we are both free?’ ‘I should like to call on you when you are at home,’ said Jia Rui, ‘but I suppose a young person like your good self is not in a position to receive visitors of the other sex.’ Xi-feng feigned a laugh. ‘We’re all one family – all one flesh and blood. I don’t see that age comes into it.’ Jia Rui was secretly delighted by this encouragement. ‘I never dreamed today would bring a chance like this my way,’ he thought, and the goatish eagerness of his expression grew even more repellent. ‘You had better hurry back to the party,’ said Xi-feng. ‘If they catch you playing truant, you will find yourself being sconced!’ Jia Rui was by now scarcely in command of his own person. Slowly, very slowly he walked away, frequently turning back to gaze at Xi-feng as he did so."
遂又往後看時，只見畫著一張弓，弓上掛著香櫞。也有一首歌詞云：「二十年來辨是非，榴花開處照宮闈。三春爭及初春景，虎兕相逢大夢歸。」,"Then, when he looked back, he saw a drawing of a bow with a citron hanging from the bow. There is also a lyric saying: ""Ten years of distinguishing right from wrong, the pomegranate blossoms have bloomed in the palace. The three spring struggles and the early spring scene, the tiger and the tiger meet and return with a big dream.""","Forthwith, therefore, he prosecuted a further perusal of what came next, when he caught sight of a picture of a bow. On this bow hung a citron. There was also this ode: Full twenty years right and wrong to expound will be thy fate! What place pomegranate blossoms come in bloom will face the Palace Gate! The third portion of spring, of the first spring in beauty short will fall! When tiger meets with hare thou wilt return to sleep perennial.","The picture that followed was of a bow with a citron hanging from it, followed by what looked like the words of a song: You shall, when twenty years in life’s hard school are done, In pomegranate-time to palace halls ascend. Though three springs never could with your first spring compare, When hare meets tiger your great dream shall end."
不言老尼陪著鳳姐。且說秦鍾、寶玉二人正在殿上頑耍，因見智能過來，寶玉笑道：「能兒來了。」秦鍾道：「理那東西作什麼？」寶玉笑道：「你別弄鬼，那一日在老太太屋裏，一個人沒有，你摟著他作什麼？這會子還哄我。」秦鍾笑道：「這可是沒有的話。」寶玉笑道：「有沒有也不管你，你只叫住他倒碗茶來我喫，就丟開手。」秦鍾笑道：「這又奇了，你叫他倒去，還怕他不倒？何必要我說呢。」寶玉道：「我叫他倒的是無情意的，不及你叫他倒的是有情意的。」秦鍾只得說道：「能兒，倒碗茶來給我。」那智能兒自幼在榮府走動，無人不識，因常與寶玉秦鍾頑笑。他如今大了，漸知風月，便看上了秦鍾人物風流，那秦鍾也極愛他妍媚，二人雖未上手，卻已情投意合了。今智能見了秦鍾，心眼俱開，走去倒了茶來。秦鍾笑說：「給我。」寶玉叫：「給我！」智能兒抿嘴笑道：「一碗茶也爭，我難道手裏有蜜！」寶玉先搶得了，喫著，方要問話，只見智善來叫智能去擺茶碟子。一時，來請他兩個去喫茶菓點心。他兩個那裏喫這些東西，坐一坐仍出來頑耍。,"Bu Yan Lao Ni accompanied Sister Feng. Besides, Qin Zhong and Baoyu were playing in the hall. Seeing the wisdom coming, Baoyu smiled and said, ""Neng'er is here."" Qin Zhong said, ""What are you doing with that thing?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Don't be a ghost, that day. In the old lady's house, there is no one there. What are you doing with your arms around him? You are still coaxing me."" Qin Zhong smiled and said, ""That's not true."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""It doesn't matter if you have it or not, you just stop it. When he poured a bowl of tea for me to eat, he threw his hands away."" Qin Zhong smiled and said, ""This is strange, you told him to pour it, and you are afraid that he will not pour it? Why should I say it?"" Baoyu said: ""My name is What he poured was ruthless, not as affectionate as what you told him to pour."" Qin Zhong could only say, ""Neng'er, pour me a bowl of tea."" That Zhi'er walked around the Rong Mansion since childhood, and no one knew it. , because he often laughs stubbornly with Baoyu Qin Zhong. Now that he is older, and gradually getting to know Fengyue, he takes a fancy to Qin Zhong's character, and Qin Zhong also loves him very much. Although the two haven't gotten started yet, they are already in love. Jin Zhizhi saw Qin Zhong, his eyes widened, and he went to pour some tea. Qin Zhong smiled and said, ""Give it to me."" Baoyu called, ""Give it to me!"" Zhizhi'er pursed his lips and smiled and said, ""I can compete for a bowl of tea, do I have honey in my hand!"" When questioned, Zhishan came to ask Zhishan to set the tea saucer. For a while, I came and invited the two of them to have tea and fruit snacks. The two of them eat these things, and they still come out to play.","But leaving aside the old nun, who kept lady Feng company, we will now return to the two lads Pao-yue and Ch’in Chung. They were up to their pranks in the main building of the convent, when seeing Chih Neng come over: “Here’s Neng Erh,” Pao-yue exclaimed with a smile. “Why notice a creature like her?” remarked Ch’in Chung; to which Pao-yue rejoined laughingly: “Don’t be sly! why then did you the other day, when you were in the old lady’s rooms, and there was not a soul present, hold her in your arms? and do you want to fool me now ?” “There was nothing of the kind,” observed Ch’in Chung smiling. “Whether there was or not,” replied Pao-yue, “doesn’t concern me; but if you will stop her and tell her to pour a cup of tea and bring it to me to drink, I’ll then keep hands off.” “This is indeed very strange!” Ch’in Chung answered laughing; “do you fear that if you told her to pour you one, that she wouldn’t; and what need is there that I should tell her?” “If I ask her,” Pao-yue observed, “to pour it, she wouldn’t be as ready as she would were you to tell her about it.” Ch’in Chung had no help but to speak. “Neng Erh!” he said, “bring a cup of tea.” This Neng Erh had, since her youth, been in and out of the Jung mansion, so that there was no one that she did not know; and she had also, time after time, romped and laughed with Pao-yue and Ch’in Chung. Being now grown up she gradually came to know the import of love, and she readily took a fancy to Ch’in Chung, who was an amorous being. Ch’in Chung too returned her affection, on account of her good looks; and, although he and she had not had any very affectionate tete- a-tetes, they had, however, long ago come to understand each other’s feelings and wishes. Chih Neng walked away and returned after having poured the tea. “Give it to me,” Ch’in Chung cried out smirkingly; while Pao-yue likewise shouted: “Give it to me.” Chih Neng compressed her lips and sneeringly rejoined, “Are you going to have a fight even over a cup of tea? Is it forsooth likely that there’s honey in my hand?” Pao-yue was the first to grasp and take over the cup, but while drinking it, he was about to make some inquiry, when he caught sight of Chih Shan, who came and called Chih Neng away to go and lay the plates with fruit on the table. Not much time elapsed before she came round to request the two lads to go and have tea and refreshments; but would they eat such things as were laid before them? They simply sat for a while and came out again and resumed their play.","Let us leave Xi-feng in conversation with the prioress and turn to the other two. Qin Zhong and Bao-yu were amusing themselves in the main hall of the priory when Sapientia happened to pass through. ‘Here’s Sappy,’ said Bao-yu with a meaningful smile. ‘Well, what about it?’ said Qin Zhong. ‘Now, now, stop play-acting!’ said Bao-yu. ‘I saw you holding her that day at Grandma’s when you thought nobody else was about. You needn’t think you can fool me after that!’ ‘I don’t know what you’re talking about.’ ‘All right then. Never mind whether you know what I’m talking about or not. Just ask her to pour me out a cup of tea, will you, and then we’ll let the subject drop.’ ‘What sort of joke is this ? Why can’t you ask her yourself? She’d pour it out just the same for you. Why ask me to tell her?’ ‘I couldn’t do it with the same feeling as you. There’ll be much more feeling in it if you ask her.’ He finally prevailed upon Qin Zhong to make the request. ‘Oh, all right! – Sappy, pour us a cup of tea, will you?’ Sapientia had been a regular visitor at the Rong-guo mansion ever since she was a little girl and was familiar with all its inmates. The innocence of her childish rompings with Bao-yu and Qin Zhong had latterly, however – now that she had reached adolescence – given way to a more mature emotion. She had fallen in love with Qin Zhong, whose every feature and lineament now inspired her with romantic feelings; and Qin Zhong, captivated by her developing charms, had responded by loving her back. Although nothing serious had as yet passed between them, in their inclinations and affections they were already united. Sapientia hurried out and returned with a cup of tea. ‘Give it to me, Sappy!’ said Qin Zhong. ‘No, give it to me, Sappy!’ said Bao-yu. She stood between them, pouting prettily, and gave a little laugh: ‘Surely you’re not going to fight over a cup of tea? I must have honey on my hands I’ Bao-yu snatched the cup before Qin Zhong could do so and began drinking. He was about to say something when Benevo-lentia came in and fetched Sapientia away to help her lay the table. She was back again presently to invite the two boys to tea and cakes; but neither of them felt much enthusiasm for such feminine repasts, and after sitting a short while for the sake of politeness, were soon off to amuse themselves elsewhere."
此時寶玉獨站在院外屏氣靜候，待他們出來，便忙忙的走了。李貴等一面撣衣服，一面說道：「哥兒聽見了不曾？先要揭我們的皮呢！人家的奴才跟主子賺些好體面，我們這等奴才白陪著挨打受罵的。從此後也可憐見些纔好。」寶玉笑道：「好哥哥，你別委曲，我明兒請你。」李貴道：「小祖宗，誰敢望你請，只求聽一句半句話就有了。」,"At this time, Baoyu stood alone outside the courtyard holding her breath, and when they came out, she hurriedly left. Li Gui waited while dusting his clothes, and said, ""Did you hear me, brother? First of all, let's peel off our skins! Other people's servants and their masters make some decent money, and our servants have been beaten and scolded for nothing. It's better to be pitiful."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Good brother, don't give in, I'll invite you tomorrow."" Li Gui said, ""Little ancestor, who dares to ask you to invite me, just listen to a sentence or a half.""","During this while, Pao-yue had been standing all alone outside in the court, waiting quietly with suppressed voice, and when they came out he at once walked away in their company. Li Kuei and his companions observed as they shook their clothes, “Did you, worthy brother, hear what he said that he would first of all flay our skins off ! People’s servants acquire some respectability from the master whom they serve, but we poor fellows fruitlessly wait upon you, and are beaten and blown up in the bargain. It would be well if we were, from henceforward, to be treated with a certain amount of regard.” Pao-yue smiled, “Dear Brother,” he added, “don’t feel aggrieved; I’ll invite you to come round to-morrow!” “My young ancestor,” replied Li Kuei, “who presumes to look forward to an invitation? all I entreat you is to listen to one or two words I have to say, that’s all.”","All this time Bao-yu had been waiting for them in the courtyard outside, scarcely daring to breathe. As they came out, dusting their knees, Li Gui said, ‘Did you hear that, young master? “Have my hide off first” he said. Some people’s servants are respected for their masters’ sakes, but not us. All we get is beatings and hard words. So spare a thought for us in future, will you?’ ‘Don’t be upset, old chap!’ said Bao-yu. ‘Tomorrow I’ll treat you all.’ ‘Little ancestor,’ Li Gui replied, ‘nobody’s looking for treats. All we ask is that once in a while – just once in a while -you should do what you are told.’"
那天已是掌燈時候，賈蕓喫了飯收拾歇息，一宿無話。次日一早起來，洗了臉，便出南門，大香鋪裏買了冰麝，便往榮國府來。打聽賈璉出了門，賈蕓便往後面來。到賈璉院門前，只見幾個小廝拿著大高笤帚在那裏掃院子呢。忽見周瑞家的從門裏出來叫小廝們：「先別掃，奶奶出來了。」賈蕓忙上前笑問：「二嬸嬸那去？」周瑞家的道：「老太太叫，想必是裁什麼尺頭。」,"That day was when the lamp was in charge, Jia Yun had a meal, packed up and rested, and was speechless all night. The next morning, I got up early, washed my face, and went out to the south gate. I bought ice musk deer at the big incense shop and went to Rongguo Mansion. After inquiring about Jia Lian leaving the door, Jia Yun came back. In front of Jialian's courtyard, I saw a few servants sweeping the courtyard with big brooms. Suddenly, Zhou Rui's family came out of the door and called the servants: ""Don't sweep first, grandma is out."" Jia Yun hurriedly stepped forward and smiled and asked, ""Where is the second aunt?"" Zhou Rui's family said: ""The old lady is calling, it must be the chief What a ruler.""","But as it was already dark, when the lamps had to be lit, Chia Yuen, after partaking of his meal, got ready and turned in. Nothing of any notice transpired the whole night; but the next day, as soon it was dawn, he got up, washed his face, and came to the main street, outside the south gate, and purchasing some musk from a perfumery shop, he, with rapid stride, entered the Jung Kuo mansion; and having, as a result of his inquiries, found out that Chia Lien had gone out of doors, Chia Yuen readily betook himself to the back, in front of the door of Chia Lien’s court, where he saw several servant-lads, with immense brooms in their hands, engaged in that place in sweeping the court. But as he suddenly caught sight of Chou Jui’s wife appear outside the door, and call out to the young boys; “Don’t sweep now, our lady is coming out,” Chia Yuen eagerly walked up to her and inquired, with a face beaming with smiles: “Where’s aunt Secunda going to?” To this inquiry, Chou Jui’s wife explained: “Our old lady has sent for her, and I expect, it must be for her to cut some piece of cloth or other.”","Except for her work-lamp it was already dark indoors, so after finishing his supper he got himself ready for the night, unrolled his bedding, and settled down to sleep. Rising early next morning, he went off as soon as he had washed to the shops in Central Street outside the south gate of the Inner City and bought camphor and musk at a perfumer’s. From there he went to Rong-guo House, and having first ascertained at the gate that Jia Lian was out for the day, he made his way to the Lians’ apartment at the back. Outside the gateway leading to their courtyard a number of page boys were sweeping the ground with long-handled brooms. Suddenly Zhou Rui’s wife came out and addressed them: ‘Stop sweeping now! The Mistress is coming.’ Jia Yun hurried up to her with a smile of greeting: ‘Where is Aunt Lian off to, then?’ ‘Her Old Ladyship wants her,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘I think it’s to see about some tailoring.’"
寶玉聽了「出嫁」二字，不禁又嗐了兩聲。正是不自在，又聽襲人嘆道：「只從我來這幾年，姊妹們都不得在一處。如今我要回去了，他們又都去了。」寶玉聽這話內有文章，不禁喫一驚，忙丟下栗子，問道：「怎麼，你如今要回去了？」襲人道：「我今兒聽見我媽和哥哥商議，教我再耐煩一年，明年他們上來，就贖我出去的呢。」寶玉聽了這話，越發怔了，因問：「為什麼要贖你？」襲人道：」這話奇了！我又比不得是你這裏的家生子兒，一家子都在此處，獨我一個人在這裏，怎麼是個了局？」寶玉道：「我不放你去也難。」襲人道：「從來沒這道理。便是朝廷宮裏，也有個定例，或幾年一選，幾年一放，也沒有個長遠留下人的理，別說你了！」,"When Baoyu heard the word ""married"", she couldn't help but snorted twice. It was precisely because he was uncomfortable that he heard someone sigh, ""It's only been the past few years since I came here that the sisters were not allowed to be together. Now that I'm going back, they are all gone again."" Surprised, he hurriedly threw the chestnuts down and asked, ""Why, are you going back now?"" Xiren said, ""I heard my mother and brother discuss today, teach me to be patient for another year, and when they come up next year, they will redeem the money. I went out."" Hearing this, Baoyu became more and more startled, because he asked, ""Why should I redeem you?"" Xiren said, ""This is strange! I can't compare to your family having children here. The whole family is here, and I am here alone. How can it be a problem? Baoyu said, ""It would be difficult if I didn't let you go."" Xiren said, ""It's never been true. Even in the imperial court, there is a rule, or a choice every few years, and a release every few years, and there is no long-term stay."" Human reason, don't talk about you!""","Upon hearing the two words “get married,” he could not repress himself from again ejaculating: “Hai hai!” but while he was in an unhappy frame of mind, he once more heard Hsi Jen remark as she heaved a sigh: “Ever since I’ve come here, we cousins haven’t all these years been able to get to live together, and now that I’m about to return home, they, on the other hand, will all be gone!” Pao-yue, realising that there lurked in this remark some meaning or other, was suddenly so taken aback that dropping the chestnuts, he inquired: “How is it that you now want to go back?” “I was present to-day,” Hsi Jen explained, “when mother and brother held consultation together, and they bade me be patient for another year, and that next year they’ll come up and redeem me out of service!” Pao-yue, at these words, felt the more distressed. “Why do they want to redeem you?” he consequently asked. “This is a strange question!” Hsi Jen retorted, “for I can’t really be treated as if I were the issue born in this homestead of yours! All the members of my family are elsewhere, and there’s only myself in this place, so that how could I end my days here?” “If I don’t let you go, it will verily be difficult for you to get away!” Pao-yue replied. “There has never been such a principle of action!” urged Hsi Jen; “even in the imperial palace itself, there’s a fixed rule, by which possibly every certain number of years a selection (of those who have to go takes place), and every certain number of years a new batch enters; and there’s no such practice as that of keeping people for ever; not to speak of your own home.”","‘Hail’ An involuntary expression of regret broke from him when he heard that the girl in red was to be married. Already Aroma’s words had made him uneasy; but worse was to follow. ‘I haven’t been able to see much of my cousins during these last few years,’ she said with a sigh, ‘and now it looks as if they will all have left home when I do go back.’ There was obviously a good deal more that lay behind this remark. Startled, he threw down the chestnut he was peeling and asked her: ‘How do you mean, “when you do go back”?’ ‘Today I heard my mother discussing it with my elder brother. They want me to hold out this one year more, then next year they will see about buying me out of service.’ Bao-yu was becoming more and more alarmed. ‘Why should they want to buy you out of service?’ ‘Well upon my word, that’s a funny question to ask!’ said Aroma. ‘I’m not one of your house-born slaves, my family lives elsewhere. I’m the only member of my family away from home. There’s no future for me here. Naturally I want to rejoin them.’ ‘You can’t if I won’t let you,’ said Bao-yu. ‘I never heard of such a thing!’ said Aroma: ‘Even in palace hall Law is the lord of all. A bond is a bond. When their term of service has ended, you have to let people go. You can’t force them to stay in service for ever and ever – especially a household like yours.’"
鳳姐兒聽了，哼了一聲，說道：「這畜生合該作死，看他來了怎麼樣！」平兒因問道：「這瑞大爺是因什麼只管來？」鳳姐兒遂將九月裏寧府園子裏遇見他的光景，他說的話，都告訴了平兒。平兒說道：「癩蛤蟆想天鵝肉喫，沒人倫的混帳東西，起這個念頭，叫他不得好死！」鳳姐兒道：「等他來了，我自有道理。」不知賈瑞來時作何光景，且聽下回分解。,"Sister Feng listened, snorted, and said, ""This beast should be killed, let's see how he comes!"" Ping'eryin asked, ""Why does this uncle Rui only come here?"" When he met him in the garden of Ningfu in Yueli, he told Ping'er everything he said. Ping'er said, ""Toad wants to eat swan meat, an unethical bastard. When he comes up with this idea, he must die!"" Sister Feng said, ""When he comes, I will make sense."" I don't know what Jia Rui did when he came. The scene, and listen to the next decomposition.","“Heng!” exclaimed lady Feng at these words. “Why should this beast compass his own death? we’ll see when he comes what is to be done.” “Why is this Mr. Jui so bent upon coming?’ P’ing Erh having inquired, lady Feng readily gave her an account of how she had met him in the course of the ninth moon in the Ning mansion, and of what had been said by him. “What a mangy frog to be bent upon eating the flesh of a heavenly goose!” ejaculated P’ing Erh. “A stupid and disorderly fellow with no conception of relationship, to harbour such a thought! but we’ll make him find an unnatural death!” “Wait till he comes,” added lady Feng, “when I feel certain I shall find some way.” What happened, however, when Chia Jui came has not, as yet, been ascertained, but listen, reader, to the explanation given in the next chapter.","Xi-feng snorted. ‘Horrible creature! he seems to be looking for trouble. Just let him come, then!’ ‘What does Mr Rui want?’ asked Patience. ‘Why does he keep coming like this?’ In reply Xi-feng gave her a full account of her encounter with him in the garden of the Ning-guo mansion and of the things he had said to her on that occasion. ‘What a nasty, disgusting man!’ said Patience. ‘A case of “the toad on the ground wanting to eat the goose in the sky”. He’ll come to no good end, getting ideas like that!’ ‘Just wait till he comes!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I know how to deal with him.’ But if you wish to know the outcome of Jia Rui’s visit, you will have to read the next chapter."
賈政問道：「你道友二人在那廟焚修。」那僧笑道：「長官不須多話。因聞得府上人口不利，故特來醫治。」賈政道：「倒有兩個人中邪，不知你們有何符水？」那道人笑道：「你家現有希世奇珍，如何還問我們有符水？」賈政聽這話有意思，心中便動了，因說道：「小兒落草時雖帶了一塊寶玉下來，上面說能除邪祟，誰知竟不靈驗。」那僧道：「長官你那裏知道那物的妙用。只因他如今被聲色貨利所迷，故不靈驗了。你今且取他出來，待我們持頌持頌，只怕就好了。」,"Jia Zheng asked, ""You two fellow Daoists are burning in that temple."" The monk smiled and said, ""Sir, you don't need to talk much. I heard that the people in the government are unfavorable, so I came here for treatment."" Jia Zheng said, ""Yes The two of you are evil, I don’t know what talisman water you have?” The Taoist smiled and said, “You have rare treasures in your family, why do you still ask us to have talisman water?” He said, ""Although my child brought a piece of precious jade down when he fell weeds, it said that it can ward off evil spirits, but who knows it doesn't work."" The monk said, ""Sir, do you know the magic effect of that thing. It's just because he is now fascinated by sensuality and money. So it doesn't work. You take him out now, and wait for us to chant and chant, I'm afraid it will be fine.""","Chia Cheng ordered the servants to invite them to walk in. “On what hill,” he asked those two persons, “do you cultivate the principles of reason? “Worthy official!” the bonze smiled, “you must not ask too many questions! It’s because we’ve learnt that there are inmates of your honourable mansion in a poor state of health that we come with the express design of working a cure.” “There are,” explained Chia Cheng, “two of our members, who have been possessed of evil spirits. But, is there, I wonder, any remedy by means of which they could he healed?” “In your family,” laughingly observed the Taoist priest, “you have ready at hand a precious thing, the like of which is rare to find in the world. It possesses the virtue of alleviating the ailment, so why need you inquire about remedies?” Chia Cheng’s mind was forthwith aroused. “It’s true,” he consequently rejoined, “that my son brought along with him, at the time of his birth, a piece of jade, on the surface of which was inscribed that it had the virtue of dispelling evil influences, but we haven’t seen any efficacy in it.” “There is, worthy officer,” said the bonze, “something in it which you do not understand. That precious jade was, in its primitive state, efficacious, but consequent upon its having been polluted by music, lewdness, property and gain it has lost its spiritual properties. But produce now that valuable thing and wait till I have taken it into my hands and pronounced incantations over it, when it will become as full of efficacy as of old!”","was, ‘Westward of Paradise’ he would reply. Jia Zheng had them invited in and asked them what monastery they were from. The monk was genially dismissive: ‘There is no need for Your Worship to waste time on formalities. Suffice it to say that I heard you had sickness in this house and have come to cure it.’ ‘Two members of this family have, indeed, fallen victims to some kind of witchcraft,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Might one inquire what charm you intend to cure them with?’ ‘Charm ?’ The monk laughed.’ You already possess in your own house a precious object capable of curing them. What other charm is necessary ?’ Jia Zheng gave a start. ‘To be sure. My son was born with a piece of jade whose inscription makes some such claim – “Dispels the harms of witchcraft”. But as you see, it does not appear to possess the power it lays claim to.’ ‘That is because the world and its temptations have confused it,’ said the monk. ‘It certainly used to have the power. If you will have the goodness to fetch it for me and allow me to hold it in my hand and say a wee prayer over it, I think I can undertake to bring the power back again.’"
賈政看完，心內自忖道：「此物還倒有限。衹是小小之人作此詞句，更覺不祥，皆非永遠福壽之輩。」想到此處，愈覺煩悶，大有悲戚之狀，因而將適纔的精神減去十分之八九，只垂頭沉思。,"After Jia Zheng read it, he thought to himself, ""This thing is still limited. It's only a little person who makes this sentence, and it's even more ominous. They're not people who will live forever."" There is a state of grief, so I reduced the spirit of Shicai by eighty-nine-tenths, and only lowered his head and meditated.","When Chia Cheng finished scanning it, he gave way to reflection. “ This object,” he pondered, “must surely be limited in use!","A useful object. Jia Zheng knew that the answer must be ‘a bamboo wife’, as they call those wickerwork cylinders which are put between the bedclothes in summertime to make them cooler; but a growing awareness that all the girls’ verses contained images of grief and loss was by now so much affecting him that he felt quite unable to go on. ‘Enough is enough!’ he thought. ‘What can it be that makes these innocent young creatures all produce language that is so tragic and inauspicious ? It is almost as if they were all destined to be unfortunate and short-lived and were unconsciously foretelling their destiny.’ The gloom into which this reflection plunged him was evident in the melancholy expression on his face and in his bowed and dejected stance."
雨村道：「天地生人，除大仁大惡兩種，餘者皆無大異。若大仁者，則應運而生，大惡者，則應劫而生。運生世治，劫生世危。堯、舜、禹、湯、文、武、周、召、孔、孟、董、韓、周、程、張、朱，皆應運而生者。蚩龍、共工、桀、紂、始皇、王莽、曹操、桓溫、安祿山、秦檜等，皆應劫而生者。大仁者，修治天下；大惡者，撓亂天下。清明靈秀，天地之正氣，仁者之所秉也；殘忍乖僻，天地之邪氣，惡者之所秉也。今當運隆祚永之朝，太平無為之世，清明靈秀之氣所秉者，上至朝廷，下及草野，比比皆是。所餘之秀氣，漫無所歸，遂為甘露、為和風，洽然溉及四海。彼殘忍乖僻之邪氣，不能蕩溢於光天化日之中，遂凝結充塞於深溝大壑之內，偶因風蕩，或被雲摧，略有搖動感發之意，一絲半縷誤而泄出者，偶值靈秀之氣適過，正不容邪，邪復妒正，兩不相下，亦如風水雷電，地中既遇，既不能消，又不能讓，必至搏擊掀發後始盡。故其氣亦必賦人，發泄一盡始散。使男女偶秉此氣而生者，在上則不能成仁人君子，下亦不能為大兇大惡。置之於萬萬人中，其聰俊靈秀之氣，則在萬萬人之上；其乖僻邪謬不近人情之態，又在萬萬人之下。若生於公侯富貴之家，則為情癡情種；若生於詩書清貧之族，則為逸士高人；縱再偶生於薄祚寒門，斷不能為走卒健僕，甘遭庸人驅制駕馭，必為奇優名倡。如前代之許由、陶潛、阮籍、嵇康、劉伶、王謝二族、顧虎頭、陳後主、唐明皇、宋徽宗、劉庭芝、溫飛卿、米南宮、石曼卿、柳耆卿、秦少游，近日之倪雲林、唐伯虎、祝枝山，再如李龜年、黃幡綽、敬新磨、卓文君、紅拂、薛濤、崔鶯、朝雲之流，此皆易地則同之人也。」,"Yucun said: ""There are people born in heaven and earth, except for the great benevolence and the great evil, there is no great difference in the rest. If the great benevolence is born, it will be born at the right moment, and the great evil will be born in response to a calamity. Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, Wen, Wu, Zhou, Zhao, Confucius, Meng, Dong, Han, Zhou, Cheng, Zhang, and Zhu all came into being. Chilong, Gonggong, Jie, Zhou, Shi Huang , Wang Mang, Cao Cao, Huan Wen, An Lushan, Qin Hui, etc., all should be born. The benevolent, repair and rule the world; Cruel and perverse, the evil spirit of heaven and earth, and the evil of the evil. Today, in the prosperous and prosperous dynasty, the world of peace and inaction, and the spirit of Qingming and Lingxiu, up to the court, down to the grass and fields, everywhere. The beauty of his beauty has nowhere to go, so it becomes the nectar, the wind, and the four seas. His cruel and eccentric evil cannot overflow in broad daylight, so it condenses and fills the deep ravines and ravines. Occasionally due to the wind, Or being destroyed by clouds, with a slight sense of shaking, and a trace of it leaking out by mistake, even if the spirit of graceful beauty is suitable for passing, good is not evil, evil is jealous of good, and the two are incompatible, just like Fengshui, thunder and lightning, and earth. Once encountered in the middle, it can neither be eliminated nor let it go, and it will be exhausted after the fight is lifted. Therefore, its qi must also be given to people, and it will only be released once it is vented. If men and women are born with this qi, they cannot become a benevolent gentleman. If you put it among thousands of people, its smart, handsome, and handsome spirit is above thousands of people; its eccentricity, absurdity, and inhumanity will be lower than thousands of people. If you were born in a rich and noble family, you would be infatuated with love; if you were born in a poor family with poetry and literature, you would be a master of Yi Shi; even if you were born in a poor family, you would never be a soldier and a servant, willing to be driven by mediocrity. Control and control must be outstanding and famous. For example, Xu You, Tao Qian, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Liu Ling, Wang Xie, Gu Hutou, Chen Houzhu, Tang Minghuang, Song Huizong, Liu Tingzhi, Wen Feiqing, Minangong, Shi Manqing, Liu Qiqing, Qin Shaoyou, Ni Yunlin, Tang Bohu, Zhu Zhishan, Li Guinian, Huang Fanchuo, Jing Xinmo, Zhuo Wenjun, Hongfu, Xue Tao, Cui Ying, Chaoyun and others, these They are the same people when they change places.”","To which Yue-ts’un responded: “Of the human beings created by the operation of heaven and earth, if we exclude those who are gifted with extreme benevolence and extreme viciousness, the rest, for the most part, present no striking diversity. If they be extremely benevolent, they fall in, at the time of their birth, with an era of propitious fortune; while those extremely vicious correspond, at the time of their existence, with an era of calamity. When those who coexist with propitious fortune come into life, the world is in order; when those who coexist with unpropitious fortune come into life, the world is in danger. Yao, Shun, Yue, Ch’eng T’ang, Wen Wang, Wu Wang, Chou Kung, Chao Kung, Confucius, Mencius, T’ung Hu, Han Hsin, Chou Tzu, Ch’eng Tzu, Chu Tzu and Chang Tzu were ordained to see light in an auspicious era. Whereas Ch’i Yu, Kung Kung, Chieh Wang, Chou Wang, Shih Huang, Wang Mang, Tsao Ts’ao, Wen Wen, An Hu-shan, Ch’in Kuei and others were one and all destined to come into the world during a calamitous age. Those endowed with extreme benevolence set the world in order; those possessed of extreme maliciousness turn the world into disorder. Purity, intelligence, spirituality and subtlety constitute the vital spirit of right which pervades heaven and earth, and the persons gifted with benevolence are its natural fruit. Malignity and perversity constitute the spirit of evil, which permeates heaven and earth, and malicious persons are affected by its influence. The days of perpetual happiness and eminent good fortune, and the era of perfect peace and tranquility, which now prevail, are the offspring of the pure, intelligent, divine and subtle spirit which ascends above, to the very Emperor, and below reaches the rustic and uncultured classes. Every one is without exception under its influence. The superfluity of the subtle spirit expands far and wide, and finding nowhere to betake itself to, becomes, in due course, transformed into dew, or gentle breeze; and, by a process of diffusion, it pervades the whole world. “The spirit of malignity and perversity, unable to expand under the brilliant sky and transmuting sun, eventually coagulates, pervades and stops up the deep gutters and extensive caverns; and when of a sudden the wind agitates it or it be impelled by the clouds, and any slight disposition, on its part, supervenes to set itself in motion, or to break its bounds, and so little as even the minutest fraction does unexpectedly find an outlet, and happens to come across any spirit of perception and subtlety which may be at the time passing by, the spirit of right does not yield to the spirit of evil, and the spirit of evil is again envious of the spirit of right, so that the two do not harmonize. Just like wind, water, thunder and lightning, which, when they meet in the bowels of the earth, must necessarily, as they are both to dissolve and are likewise unable to yield, clash and explode to the end that they may at length exhaust themselves. Hence it is that these spirits have also forcibly to diffuse themselves into the human race to find an outlet, so that they may then completely disperse, with the result that men and women are suddenly imbued with these spirits and spring into existence. At best, (these human beings) cannot be generated into philanthropists or perfect men; at worst, they cannot also embody extreme perversity or extreme wickedness. Yet placed among one million beings, the spirit of intelligence, refinement, perception and subtlety will be above these one million beings; while, on the other hand, the perverse, depraved and inhuman embodiment will likewise be below the million of men. Born in a noble and wealthy family, these men will be a salacious, lustful lot; born of literary, virtuous or poor parentage, they will turn out retired scholars or men of mark; though they may by some accident be born in a destitute and poverty-stricken home, they cannot possibly, in fact, ever sink so low as to become runners or menials, or contentedly brook to be of the common herd or to be driven and curbed like a horse in harness. They will become, for a certainty, either actors of note or courtesans of notoriety; as instanced in former years by Hsue Yu, T’ao Ch’ien, Yuan Chi, Chi Kang, Liu Ling, the two families of Wang and Hsieh, Ku Hu-t’ou, Ch’en Hou-chu, T’ang Ming-huang, Sung Hui-tsung, Liu T’ing-chih, Wen Fei-ching, Mei Nan-kung, Shih Man-ch’ing, Lui C’hih-ch’ing and Chin Shao-yu, and exemplified now-a-days by Ni Yuen-lin, T’ang Po-hu, Chu Chih-shan, and also by Li Kuei-men, Huang P’an-cho, Ching Hsin-mo, Cho Wen-chuen; and the women Hung Fu, Hsieh T’ao, Ch’ue Ying, Ch’ao Yuen and others; all of whom were and are of the same stamp, though placed in different scenes of action.”","‘The generative processes operating in the universe provide the great majority of mankind with natures in which good and evil are commingled in more or less equal proportions. Instances of exceptional goodness and exceptional badness are produced by the operation of beneficent or noxious ethereal influences, of which the former are symptomatized by the equilibrium of society and the latter by its disequilibrium. ‘Thus, Yao, Shun, Yu, Tang, King Wen, King Wu, the Duke of Zhou, the Duke of Shao, Confucius, Mencius, Dong Zhong-shu, HanYu, Zhou Dun-yi, the Cheng brothers, Zhu Xi and Zhang Zai – all instances of exceptional goodness – were born under the influence of benign forces, and all sought to promote the well-being of the societies in which they lived; whilst Chi You, Gong Gong, Jie, Zhou, the First Qin Emperor, Wang Mang, Cao Cao, Huan Wen, An Lu-shan and Qin Kuai – all instances of exceptional badness – were bom under the influence of harmful forces, and all sought to disrupt the societies in which they lived. ‘Now, the good cosmic fluid with which the natures of the exceptionally good are compounded is a pure, quintessential humour; whilst die evil fluid which infuses the natures of the exceptionally bad is a cruel, perverse humour. ‘Therefore, our age being one in which beneficent ethereal influences are in the ascendant, in which the reigning dynasty is well-established and society both peaceful and prosperous, innumerable instances are to be found, from the palace down to the humblest cottage, of individuals endowed with the pure, quintessential humour. ‘Moreover, an unused surplus of this pure, quintessential humour, unable to find corporeal lodgement, circulates freely abroad until it manifests itself in the form of sweet dews and balmy winds, asperged and effused for the enrichment and refreshment of all terrestial life. ‘Consequently, the cruel and perverse humours, unable to circulate freely in the air and sunlight, subside, by a process of incrassation and coagulation, into the bottoms of ditches and ravines. ‘Now, should these incrassate humours chance to be stirred or provoked by wind or weather into a somewhat more volatile and active condition, it sometimes happens that a stray wisp or errant flocculus may escape from the fissure or concavity in which they are contained; and if some of the pure, quintessential humour should chance to be passing overhead at that same moment, the two will become locked in irreconcilable conflict, the good refusing to yield to the evil, the evil persisting in its hatred of the good. And just as wind, water, thunder and lightning meeting together over the earth can neither dissipate nor yield one to another but produce an explosive shock resulting in the downward emission of rain , so does this clash of humours result in the forcible downward expulsion of the evil humour, which, being thus forced downwards, will find its way into some human creature. ‘Such human recipients, whether they be male or female, since they are already amply endowed with the benign humour before the evil humour is injected, are incapable of becoming either greatly good or greatly bad; but place them in the company of ten thousand others and you will find that they are superior to all the rest in sharpness and intelligence and inferior to all the rest in perversity, wrongheadedness and eccentricity. Born into a rich or noble household they are likely to become great lovers or the occasion of great love in others; in a poor but well-educated household they will become literary rebels or eccentric aesthetes; even if they are born in the lowest stratum of society they are likely to become great actors or famous hetaerae. Under no circumstances will you find them in servile or menial positions, content to be at the beck and call of mediocrities. ‘For examples I might cite: Xu You, Tao Yuan-ming, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Liu Ling, the Wang and Xie clans of the Jin period, Gu Kai-zhi, the last ruler of Chen, the emperor Ming-huang of the Tang dynasty, the emperor Hui-zong of the Song dynasty, Liu Ting-zhi, Wen Ting-yun, Mi Fei, Shi Yan-nian, Liu Yong and Qin Guan; or, from more recent centuries: Ni Zan, Tang Yin and Zhu Yun-ming; or again, for examples of the last type: Li Gui-nian, Huang Fan-chuo, Jing Xin-mo, Zhuo Wen-jun, Little Red Duster, Xue Tao, Cui Ying-ying and Morning Cloud."
第二十回,the twentieth,CHAPTER XX.,Chapter 20
周瑞家的見他說的粗鄙，只管使眼色止他。鳳姐看見，笑而不睬，只命平兒把昨兒那包銀子拿來，再拿一吊錢來，都送到劉姥姥的跟前。鳳姐乃道：「這是二十兩銀子，暫且給這孩子做件冬衣罷。若不拿著，就真是怪我了。這錢雇車坐罷。改日無事，只管來逛逛，方是親戚們的意思。天也晚了，也不虛留你們了，到家裏該問好的問個好兒罷。」一面說，一面就站了起來。,"Seeing what he said was vulgar, Zhou Rui's family just winked at him. When Sister Feng saw it, she smiled but didn't pay attention, and only ordered Ping'er to bring the bag of silver from yesterday, and another sling of money, and send it to Grandma Liu. Sister Feng said: ""This is twenty taels of silver. Let's make a winter coat for this child for the time being. If you don't take it, it's really my fault. Hire a car for this money. I'll have nothing else to do another day, just go shopping, it's a relative. What do you mean. It's getting late, so it's not too late to leave you guys, it's time to say hello when you get home."" As he said that, he stood up.","Chou Jui’s wife stood by, and on hearing her make these coarse utterances, she did all she could to give her a hint by winking, and make her desist. Lady Feng laughed and paid no heed; but calling P’ing Erh, she bade her fetch the parcel of money, which had been given to them the previous day, and to also bring a string of cash; and when these had been placed before goody Liu’s eyes: “This is,” said lady Feng, “silver to the amount of twenty taels, which was for the time given to these young girls to make winter clothes with; but some other day, when you’ve nothing to do, come again on a stroll, in evidence of the good feeling which should exist between relatives. It’s besides already late, and I don’t wish to detain you longer and all for no purpose; but, on your return home, present my compliments to all those of yours to whom I should send them.” As she spake, she stood up.","Horrified by the crudity of these expressions, Zhou Rui’s wife, who was standing by, was meanwhile signalling frantically to the old lady to stop. But Xi-feng laughed quite unconcernedly and told Patience to wrap up the silver and also to fetch a string of cash to go with it. The money was set down in front of Grannie Liu. ‘Here is the twenty taels of silver,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Take this for the time being to make some winter clothes for the children with. Some time later on, when you have nothing better to do, look in on us for a day or two for kinship’s sake. It’s late now, so I won’t try to keep you. Give our regards to everybody who ought to be remembered when you get back!’ She rose to her feet, and Grannie Liu, with heartfelt expressions of gratitude, picked up the money and followed Zhou Rui’s wife out of the room."
賈母正面榻上獨坐，兩邊四張空椅，熙鳳忙拉了黛玉在左邊第一張椅上坐了，黛玉十分推讓。賈母笑道：「你舅母你嫂子們不在這裏喫飯。你是客，原應如此坐的。」黛玉方告了座，坐了。賈母命王夫人坐了。迎春姊妹三個告了座方上來。迎春便坐右第一，探春左第二，惜春右第二。旁邊丫鬟執著拂塵、漱盂、巾帕。李、鳳二人立於案旁布讓。外間伺候之媳婦丫鬟雖多，卻連一聲咳嗽不聞。,"Mother Jia sat alone on the couch in front of her, with four empty chairs on both sides, Xifeng hurriedly pulled Daiyu to sit on the first chair on the left, and Daiyu was very pushy. Mother Jia smiled and said, ""Your aunt and sister-in-law are not eating here. You are a guest, so you should be sitting like this."" Dai Yufang told her to sit down. Mother Jia ordered Madam Wang to sit down. The three sisters Yingchun told the seated party to come up. Yingchun sits first on the right, Tanchun is second from the left, and Xichun is the second from the right. The maid next to her was obsessed with whisks, gargles, and towels. Li and Feng stood beside the case and assigned him. Although there were many daughters-in-law and maids serving outside, they didn't even hear a cough.","Dowager lady Chia was seated all alone on the divan, in the main part of the apartment, on the two sides of which stood four vacant chairs. Hsi-feng at once drew Tai-yue, meaning to make her sit in the foremost chair on the left side, but Tai-yue steadily and concedingly declined. “Your aunts and sisters-in-law, standing on the right and left,” dowager lady Chia smilingly explained, “won’t have their repast in here, and as you’re a guest, it’s but proper that you should take that seat.” Then alone it was that Tai-yue asked for permission to sit down, seating herself on the chair. Madame Wang likewise took a seat at old lady Chia’s instance; and the three cousins, Ying Ch’un and the others, having craved for leave to sit down, at length came forward, and Ying Ch’un took the first chair on the right, T’an Ch’un the second, and Hsi Ch’un the second on the left. Waiting maids stood by holding in their hands, flips and finger-bowls and napkins, while Mrs. Li and lady Feng, the two of them, kept near the table advising them what to eat, and pressing them to help themselves. In the outer apartments, the married women and waiting-maids in attendance, were, it is true, very numerous; but not even so much as the sound of the cawing of a crow could be heard.","The table at which Grandmother Jia presided, seated alone on a couch, had two empty chairs on either side. Xi-feng tried to seat Dai-yu in the one on the left nearer to her grandmother – an honour which she strenuously resisted until her grandmother explained that her aunt and her elder cousins’ wives would not be eating with them, so that, since she was a guest, the place was properly hers. Only then did she ask permission to sit, as etiquette prescribed. Grandmother Jia then ordered Lady Wang to be seated. This was the cue for the three girls to ask permission to sit. Ying-chun sat in the first place on the right opposite Dai-yu, Tan-chun sat second on the left, and Xi-chun sat second on the right. While Li Wan and Xi-feng stood by the table helping to distribute food from the dishes, maids holding fly-whisks, spittoons, and napkins ranged themselves on either side. In addition to these, there were numerous other maids and serving-women in attendance in the outer room, yet not so much as a cough was heard throughout the whole of the meal."
鳳姐便問何事。秦氏道：「目今祖塋雖四時祭祀，只是無一定的錢糧；第二，家塾雖立，無一定的供給。依我想來，如今盛時固不缺祭祀供給，但將來敗落之時，此二項有何出處！莫若依我定見，趁今日富貴，將祖塋附近多置田莊房舍地畝，以備祭祀供給之費皆出自此處，將家塾亦設於此。合同族中長幼，大家定了則例，日後按房掌管這一年的地畝、錢糧、祭祀、供給之事。如此周流，又無爭競，亦不有典賣諸弊。便是有了罪，凡物可入官，這祭祀產業連官也不入的。便敗落下來，子孫回家讀書務農，也有個退步，祭祀又可永繼。若目今以為榮華不絕，不思後日，終非長策。眼見不日又有一件非常喜事，真是烈火烹油、鮮花著錦之盛。要知道，也不過是瞬息的繁華，一時的歡樂，萬不可忘了那『盛筵必散』的俗語。此時若不早為後慮，臨期只恐後悔無益了。」鳳姐忙問：「有何喜事？」秦氏道：「天機不可泄漏。衹是我與嬸子好了一場。臨別贈你兩句話，須要記著。」因唸道：「三春去後諸芳盡，各自須尋各自門。」鳳姐還欲問時，只聽二門上傳事雲板連叩四下，將鳳姐驚醒。人回：「東府蓉大奶奶沒了。」鳳姐聞聽，嚇了一身冷汗，出了一回神，只得忙忙的穿衣，往王夫人處來。,"Sister Feng asked what was going on. Qin Shi said: ""At present, although the ancestors offer sacrifices at four seasons, they just don't have a certain amount of money. Second, although the school is established, there is no certain supply. As far as I think, there is no shortage of sacrifices in the current prosperity, but in the future, when it falls, What is the source of these two items! Mo Ruo, according to my opinion, took advantage of today's wealth and wealth, and built more farmhouses and acres of land near the ancestors to prepare for the expenses of offering sacrifices from here, and also set up the school here. , Everyone has set a rule, and in the future, the house will be in charge of the land, money, sacrifice, and supply for the year. Such a flow, there is no competition, and there is no evil in the sale. But if you enter the officialdom, this sacrificial industry does not even enter the officialdom. Then you will be defeated, and your descendants will go home to study and farm. There is also a setback, and the sacrifice can be continued forever. There will be another very happy event in the near future. It is really a flourishing of fire cooking oil and flowers. You know, it is only a momentary prosperity and a moment of joy. Don't forget the saying ""The feast must be scattered"". If I don’t think about it sooner, I’m afraid I’ll regret it later.” Sister Feng hurriedly asked, “What’s the good news?” Qin Shi said, “The secret cannot be leaked. It’s just that my aunt and I had a good time. I will give you two when we say goodbye. You need to memorize this sentence.” Yin Nian said, “After Sanchun has gone, all the fragrances will be exhausted, and each of them must find their own door.” When Sister Feng was about to ask, she heard the cloud board knocking four times about the incident from the second door, which awakened Sister Feng. The person replied, ""Grandma Dongfu Rong is gone."" When Sister Feng heard this, she broke out in a cold sweat and lost her senses, so she hurriedly dressed and went to Mrs. Wang's place.","“What matters are these?” inquired lady Feng. “Though at the graves of our ancestors,” explained Mrs. Ch’in, “sacrifices and oblations be offered at the four seasons, there’s nevertheless no fixed source of income. In the second place, the family school is, it is true, in existence; but it has no definite grants-in-aid. According to my views, now that the times are prosperous, there’s, as a matter of course, no lack of offerings and contributions; but by and bye, when reverses set in, whence will these two outlays be met from? Would it not be as well, and my ideas are positive on this score, to avail ourselves of the present time, when riches and honours still reign, to establish in the immediate vicinity of our ancestral tombs, a large number of farms, cottages, and estates, in order to enable the expenditure for offerings and grants to entirely emanate from this source? And if the household school were also established on this principle, the old and young in the whole clan can, after they have, by common consent, determined upon rules, exercise in days to come control, in the order of the branches, over the affairs connected with the landed property, revenue, ancestral worship and school maintenance for the year (of their respective term.) Under this rotatory system, there will likewise be no animosities; neither will there be any mortgages, or sales, or any of these numerous malpractices; and should any one happen to incur blame, his personal effects can be confiscated by Government. But the properties, from which will be derived the funds for ancestral worship, even the officials should not be able to appropriate, so that when reverses do supervene, the sons and grandsons of the family may be able to return to their homes, and prosecute their studies, or go in for farming. Thus, while they will have something to fall back upon, the ancestral worship will, in like manner, be continued in perpetuity. But, if the present affluence and splendour be looked upon as bound to go on without intermission, and with no thought for the day to come, no enduring plan be after all devised, presently, in a little while, there will, once again, transpire a felicitous occurrence of exceptional kind, which, in point of fact, will resemble the splendour of oil scorched on a violent fire, or fresh flowers decorated with brocades. You should bear in mind that it will also be nothing more real than a transient pageant, nothing but a short-lived pleasure! Whatever you do, don’t forget the proverb, that ‘there’s no banquet, however sumptuous, from which the guests do not disperse;’ and unless you do, at an early date, take precautions against later evils, regret will , I apprehend, be of no avail.” “What felicitous occurrence will take place?” lady Feng inquired with alacrity. “The decrees of Heaven cannot be divulged; but as I have been very friendly with you, sister-in-law, for so long, I will present you, before I take my leave, with two lines, which it behoves you to keep in mind,” rejoined Mrs. Ch’in, as she consequently proceeded to recite what follows: The three springs, when over, all radiance will wane; The inmates to seek each a home will be fain. Lady Feng was bent upon making further inquiries, when she heard a messenger at the second gate strike the “cloudy board” four consecutive blows. It was indeed the announcement of a death; and it woke up lady Feng with a start. A servant reported that lady Jung of the eastern mansion was no more. Lady Feng was so taken aback that a cold perspiration broke out all over her person, and she fell for a while into vacant abstraction. But she had to change her costume, with all possible haste, and to come over to madame Wang’s apartments.","Xi-feng asked her. ‘Though the seasonal offerings at the ancestral burial-ground are at present regularly attended to,’ said Qin-shi, ‘no special income has been set aside to pay for them. That is the first matter. The second matter concerns the clan school. There again, there is no fixed source of income. Obviously there will be no lack of funds either for the seasonal offerings or for the school as long as we enjoy our present prosperity. But where is the money for them coming from in the future, when the family has fallen on hard times ? ‘I am convinced that the only way of dealing with these two matters is to invest now, while we are still rich and powerful, in as much property as possible – land, farms, and houses – in the area around the burial-ground, and to pay for the seasonal offerings and the running of the school entirely out of the income from this property. Moreover the school itself ought to be situated on it. The whole clan, old and young alike, should be convened and a set of regulations drawn up whereby each family is made to administer the estate and look after the financing of the seasonal offerings and the clan school for one year in turn. By making the responsibility rotate in a fixed order you will remove the possibility of quarrels about it and also lessen the danger of the property getting mortgaged or sold. ‘Then even if the clan gets into trouble and its possessions are confiscated, this part of its property, as charitable estate, will escape confiscation; and when the family’s fortunes are in decline, it will be a place where the young people can go to farm and study, as well as a means of maintaining the ancestral sacrifices in unbroken succession. To refuse to take thought for the morrow on the grounds that our present prosperity is going to last for ever would be extremely short-sighted. ‘Quite soon a happy event is going to take place in this family, bringing it an even greater glory than it has enjoyed up to now. But it will be a glory as excessive and as transitory as a posy of fresh flowers pinned to an embroidered dress or the flare-up of spilt cooking-oil on a blazing fire. In the midst of that brief moment of happiness never forget that “even the best party must have an end”. For if you do, and if you fail to take precautions in good time, you will live to regret it bitterly when it is already too late.’ ‘What is this happy event you speak of?’ Xi-feng asked her eagerly. ‘That is a secret which may not be revealed to mortal ears. However, for the sake of our brief friendship on this earth, I leave you these words as my parting gift. Be sure that you remember them well! When the Three Springs have gone, the flowering time will end, And each one for himself as best he may must fend.’ Xi-feng was about to ask her another question when she was interrupted by the sound of the iron chime-bar which hung in the inner gate. Four strokes. The signal of death! She woke with a start to hear a servant announcing, ‘Mrs Rong of the Ning-guo mansion is dead.’ A cold sweat broke out over her body and for a while she lay too stunned to move. Then forcing herself to get up she pulled on her clothes and went round to Lady Wang’s."
鳳姐便說道：「明兒他也睡迷了，後兒我也睡迷了，將來都沒了人了。本來要饒你，衹是我頭一次寬了，下次人就難管，不如現開發的好。」登時放下臉來，喝命：「帶出去，打二十板子！」一面又擲下寧國府對牌：「出去說與來昇，革他一月銀米！」眾人聽說，又見鳳姐眉立，知是惱了，不敢怠慢，拖人的出去拖人，執牌傳諭的忙去傳諭。那人身不由己，已拖出去挨了二十大板，還要進來叩謝。鳳姐道：「明日再有誤的，打四十，後日的六十，有要挨打的，只管誤！」說著，吩咐：「散了罷。」窗外眾人聽說，方各自執事去了。彼時寧國榮國兩處執事領牌交牌的，人來人往不絕，那抱愧被打之人含羞去了。這纔知道鳳姐利害。眾人不敢偷閑，自此兢兢業業，執事保全。不在話下。,"Sister Feng then said: ""Tomorrow he will be sleepy too, and I will be sleepy later, and there will be no one in the future. I wanted to forgive you, but it's the first time I'm lenient. The development is good."" Immediately put down his face and shouted: ""Take it out and play twenty boards!"" At the same time, he threw down the Ning Guofu countercard: ""Go out and talk to Laisheng, and get rid of him for a month of silver rice!"" Everyone listened Said, seeing Sister Feng raised her eyebrows again, she knew she was annoyed, she didn't dare to neglect her, she dragged the person out and dragged her, and the person in charge of the decree hurriedly went to preach the decree. The man couldn't help himself, and he had already been dragged out and suffered twenty big boards, and he had to come in to thank him. Sister Feng said, ""If there is a mistake tomorrow, you will be beaten forty, and the next day at sixty, if you are going to be beaten, just ignore it!"" After speaking, she ordered, ""Let's go."" When everyone outside the window heard that, Fang went to his own deacon. At that time, the two deacons of Ning Guorong and the country received and handed the cards, and people came and went, and those who were ashamed of being beaten were ashamed. Only then did she know the interests of Sister Feng. The people did not dare to take time off, and since then they have been conscientious, and the deacon has been kept safe. Not a problem.","“If to-morrow he were to come late,” lady Feng then remarked, “and if the day after, I were to come late; why by and by there’ll be no one here at all! I should have liked to have let you off, but if I be lenient with you on this first instance, it will be hard for me, on the occurrence of another offence, to exercise any control over the rest. It’s much better therefore that I should settle accounts with you.” The moment she uttered these words, she put on a serious look, and gave orders that he should be taken out and administered twenty blows with the bamboo. When the servants perceived that lady Feng was in an angry mood, they did not venture to dilly-dally, but dragged him out, and gave him the full number of blows; which done, they came in to report that the punishment had been inflicted. Lady Feng likewise threw down the Ning Mansion order and exclaimed, addressing herself to Lai Sheng: “Cut him a month’s wages and rice! and tell them all to disperse, and have done with it!” All the servants at length withdrew to attend to their respective duties, while the man too, who had been flogged, walked away, as he did all he could to conceal his shame and stifle his tears. About this time arrived and went, in an incessant stream, servants from both the Jung and Ning mansions, bent upon applying for permits and returning permits, and with one by one again did lady Feng settle accounts. And, as in due course, the inmates of the Ning mansion came to know how terrible lady Feng was, each and all were ever since so wary and dutiful that they did not venture to be lazy. But without going into further details on this subject, we shall now return to Pao-yue.","‘Tomorrow another one will be late and the day after that it will be someone else,’ said Xi-feng turning to the still waiting offender, ‘and before we know where we are we shall have no one turning up at all. I should have liked to let you off, but if I’m lenient with you the first time, it will be that much harder for me to deal with someone else the second time; so I am obliged to make an example of you.’ Her face hardened as she pronounced sentence : ‘Take her out and give her twenty strokes of the bamboo!’ Seeing that Xi-feng was really angry, the servants dared not show themselves slack in executing her command. The wretched woman was half-dragged from the room and the flogging administered in full view of the waiting throng, after which they came in again, the executioners to report that they had discharged their duty and their victim to thank Xi-feng for her punishment. Xi-feng threw down one of the Ning-guo tallies. ‘Take this to Lai Sheng and tell him to stop a month’s pay from her wages. If anyone is late tomorrow they will get forty strokes and the day after that it will be sixty. So if you enjoy being beaten you have only to come late for roll-call. Dismiss.’ The servants, including the shamefaced and silently weeping victim, trooped off to their various duties. Now began a steady stream of servants from both households collecting and returning tallies, each of whom Xi-feng attended to in a brisk and efficient manner. From that day onwards the staff of the Ning-guo mansion realized just how formidable Xi-feng could be and went about their duties in fear and trembling, not daring to idle or delay. But let us now turn to Bao-yu."
因忽又聽得秦氏之丫鬟名喚瑞珠者，見秦氏死了，他也觸柱而亡。此事可罕，合族人也都稱嘆。賈珍遂以孫女之禮殮殯，一併停靈於會芳園中之登僊閣。小丫鬟名寶珠者，因見秦氏身無所出，乃甘心願為義女，誓任摔喪駕靈之任。賈珍喜之不盡，即時傳下，從此皆呼寶珠為小姐。那寶珠按未嫁女之喪，在靈前哀哀欲絕。於是，合族人丁併家下諸人，都各遵舊制行事，自不得紊亂。,"Because suddenly he heard that Qin's maid named Ruizhu, and seeing Qin's death, he also touched the pillar and died. This is very rare, and the people of the clan also praised it. Jia Zhen was buried with the ceremony of her granddaughter, and she stayed at the Dengxian Pavilion in Huifang Garden. The little maid, named Baozhu, was willing to be the righteous daughter because she saw that the Qin family had nothing to do, and swore to take the responsibility of falling and dying. Jia Zhen was overjoyed and passed it on immediately, and from then on, they all called Baozhu Miss. According to the mourning of the unmarried daughter, the jewel was mourning before the spirit. As a result, all the members of the co-clan and all members of the family acted according to the old system, and they should not be disordered.","Suddenly he further heard that Mrs. Ch’in’s waiting-maid, Jui Chu by name, had, after she had become alive to the fact that her mistress had died, knocked her head against a post, and likewise succumbed to the blows. This unusual occurrence the whole clan extolled in high terms; and Chia Chen promptly directed that, with regard to ceremonies, she should be treated as a granddaughter, and that the body should, after it had been placed in the coffin, be also deposited in the Hall of Attained Immortality, in the Garden of Concentrated Fragrance. There was likewise a young waiting-maid, called Pao Chu, who, as Mrs. Ch’in left no issue, was willing to become an adopted child, and begged to be allowed to undertake the charge of dashing the mourning bowl, and accompanying the coffin; which pleased Chia Chen so much that he speedily transmitted orders that from that time forth Pao Chu should be addressed by all as ‘young miss.’ Pao Chu, after the rites of an unmarried daughter, mourned before the coffin to such an unwonted degree, as if bent upon snapping her own life; while the members of the entire clan, as well as the inmates of the Mansions, each and all, readily observed, in their conduct, the established mourning usages, without of course any transgression or confusion.","News was suddenly brought that Qin-shi’s little maid Gem, on hearing that her mistress was dead, had taken her own life by dashing her head against a pillar. Such rare devotion excited the wondering admiration of the entire clan. Cousin Zhen at once had her laid out and encoffined with the rites appropriate to a granddaughter and ordered her coffin to be placed in the Ascension Pavilion of the All-scents Garden side by side with Qin-shi’s. As Qin-shi had died without issue, another of her little maids called Jewel volunteered to stand in as her daughter and perform the chief mourner’s duties of smashing the bowl when the bearers came in to take up the coffin and walking in front of it in the funeral procession. Cousin Zhen was very pleased and gave orders that thenceforth everyone was to address her as ‘Miss Jewel’ just as if she were Qin-shi’s real daughter. In the meantime she installed herself by the coffin and, comporting herself in the manner prescribed for an unmarried daughter, wept and wailed until she had almost lost her voice. Following these preliminaries, the rest of the clan together with the family servants all proceeded to carry out their mourning duties according to long-established precedents and in a correct and orderly manner."
然後撕邏賈蓉。賈蓉先咬定牙不依，只說：「明日告訴族中的人評評理。」賈瑞急的至於叩頭。賈薔作好作歹的，也寫了一張五十兩欠契纔罷。,"Then tear off Jia Rong. Jia Rong first gritted her teeth and said, ""Tomorrow, I will tell the people in the clan to judge and judge."" Jia Rui was anxious to kowtow. Jia Qiang did good and bad, and also wrote a 50 taels debt.","The two of them (Chia Jung and Chia Se) tried, the one to do a good turn, and the other to be perverse in his insistence; but (Chia Jui) put down no more than fifty taels, and appended his signature. Chia Se pocketed the note, and endeavoured subsequently to induce Chia Jung to come away; but Chia Jung was, at the outset, obdurate and unwilling to give in, and kept on repeating; “To-morrow, I’ll tell the members of our clan to look into your nice conduct!” These words plunged Chia Jui in such a state of dismay, that he even went so far as to knock his head on the ground; but, as Chia Se was trying to get unfair advantage of him though he had at first done him a good turn, he had to write another promissory note for fifty taels, before the matter was dropped.","The document, having been duly signed, was at once pocketed by Jia Qiang, who then pretended to seek the connivance of Jia Rong. But Jia Rong feigned the most obdurate incorruptibility and insisted that he would lay the matter next day before a council of the whole clan and see that justice was done. Jia Rui became quite frantic and kotowed to him. Finally, under pressure from Jia Qiang and in return for another IOU for fifty taels of silver made out in his favour, he allowed his scruples to be overcome."
賈母等聽了方心神安定，不免又都洋洋喜氣盈腮。於是都按品大妝起來。賈母帶領邢夫人、王夫人、尤氏，一共四乘大轎入朝。賈赦、賈珍亦換了朝服，帶領賈蓉、賈薔奉侍賈母大轎前往。,"When Jia Mu and the others heard Fang's peace of mind, they couldn't help but be full of joy. So they all put on makeup. Mother Jia led Mrs. Xing, Mrs. Wang, and Mrs. You to the court in four large sedan chairs. Jia She and Jia Zhen also changed their court clothes and led Jia Rong and Jia Qiang to serve Jia's mother's sedan chair.","When old lady Chia and the other members of the family heard these tidings they were at length reassured in their minds, and so elated were they all in one moment that joy was visible in their very faces. Without loss of time, they commenced to don the gala dresses suitable to their rank; which done, old lady Chia led the way for the two ladies, mesdames Hsing and Wang, as well as for Mrs. Yu; and their official chairs, four of them in all, entered the palace like a trail of fish; while Chia She and Chia Chen, who had likewise changed their clothes for their court dress, took Chia Se and Chia Jung along and proceeded in attendance upon dowager lady Chia.","Lai’s Da information at once dispelled the anxiety that Grandmother Jia and the others had all this time been feeling, and the worried looks on their faces quickly gave way to smiles of pleasure. Now a great dressing-up began as each lady robed herself in the costume appropriate to her rank. Then off they went to the Palace in four sedans one behind the other: Grand-mother Jia’s at the head, then Lady Xing’s, then Lady Wang’s, and then You-shi ’s. Jia She and Cousin Zhen also changed into court dress, and taking Jia Rong and Jia Qiang with them, accompanied Grandmother Jia to the Palace as her male escort."
薛蟠眾人見他喫完了茶，都說道：「且入席，有話慢慢的說。」馮紫英聽說，便立起身來說道：「論理，我該陪飲幾杯纔是，衹是今兒有一件大大要緊的事，回去還要見家父面回，實不敢領。」薛蟠寶玉眾人那裏肯依，死拉著不放。馮紫英笑道：「這又奇了。你我這些年，那回兒有這個道理的？果然不能遵命。若必定叫我領，拿大杯來，我領兩杯就是了。」眾人聽說，只得罷了，薛蟠執壺，寶玉把盞，斟了兩大海。那馮紫英站著，一氣而盡。寶玉道：「你到底把這個『不幸之幸』說完了再走。」馮紫英笑道：「今兒說的也不盡興。我為這個，還要特治一東，請你們去細談一談；二則還有所懇之處。」說著撒手就走。薛蟠道：「越發說的人熱剌剌的丟不下。多早晚纔請我們，告訴了，也免的人猶疑。」馮紫英道：「多則十日，少則八天。」一面說，一面出門上馬去了。眾人回來，依席又飲了一回方散。,"When Xue Pan saw that he had finished his tea, they all said, ""Let's sit at the table, I have something to say slowly."" When Feng Ziying heard this, she stood up and said, ""Theoretically, I should have a few cups with me, it's just today. There is a very important matter, and I have to meet my father when I go back, but I dare not take it."" Xue Pan Baoyu was willing to accept it and held on to it. Feng Ziying smiled and said, ""This is strange again. You and I have been doing this all these years, back then? Sure enough, I can't obey the order. If you must ask me to bring the big cup, I will take two cups."" Everyone heard that, That's all, Xue Pan held the pot, Baoyu took the cup, and poured two seas. That Feng Ziying stood there, exhausted. Baoyu said, ""You have finished talking about this 'unfortunate fortune' before you leave."" Feng Ziying smiled and said, ""I am not happy with what I said today. For this, I have to make a special order. Please go and talk about it in detail. Second, there is still something to ask for."" He said and left. Xue Pan said: ""The more and more people who talk about it, they are too hot to let go. Sooner or later, we will be invited. If we tell it, it will avoid people's hesitation."" Feng Ziying said: ""It takes ten days at most, and eight days at least."" , went out and got on a horse. When everyone came back, Yixi drank again and scattered.","Hsueeh P’an and his companions noticed that he had finished his tea. “Come along,” they one and all proposed, “and join the banquet; you can then quietly recount to us all your experiences.” At this suggestion Feng Tzu-ying there and then rose to his feet. “According to etiquette,” he said. “I should join you in drinking a few cups; but to-day I have still a very urgent matter to see my father about on my return so that I truly cannot accept your invitation.” Hsueeh P’an, Pao-yue and the other young fellows would on no account listen to his excuses. They pulled him vigorously about and would not let him go. “This is, indeed, strange!” laughed Feng Tzu-ying. “When have you and I had, during all these years, to have recourse to such proceedings! I really am unable to comply with your wishes. But if you do insist upon making me have a drink, well, then bring a large cup and I’ll take two cups full and finish.” After this rejoinder, the party could not but give in. Hsueeh P’an took hold of the kettle, while Pao-yue grasped the cup, and they poured two large cups full. Feng Tzu-ying stood up and quaffed them with one draught. “But do, after all,” urged Pao-yue, “finish this thing about a piece of good fortune in the midst of misfortune before you go.” “To tell you this to-day,” smiled Feng Tzu-ying, “will be no great fun. But for this purpose I intend standing a special entertainment, and inviting you all to come and have a long chat; and, in the second place, I’ve also got a favour to ask of you.” Saying this, he pushed his way and was going off at once, when Hsueeh P’an interposed. “ What you’ve said,” he observed, “has put us more than ever on pins and needles. We cannot brook any delay. Who knows when you will ask us round; so better tell us, and thus avoid keeping people in suspense!” “The latest,” rejoined Feng Tzu-ying, “in ten days; the earliest in eight.” With this answer he went out of the door, mounted his horse, and took his departure. The party resumed their seats at table. They had another bout, and then eventually dispersed.","As he had now finished his tea, Xue Pan urged him to join them at table and tell them his story at leisure, but Feng Zi-ying rose to his feet again and declined. ‘I ought by rights to stay and drink a few cups with you,’ he said, ‘but there’s somethin’ very important I’ve got to see Fahver about now, so I’m afraid I really must refuse.’ But Xue Pan, Bao-yu and the rest were by no means content to let him get away with this excuse and propelled him insistently towards the table. ‘Now look here, this is too bad!’ Feng Zi-ying good-hum -ouredly protested. ‘ All the years we’ve been knockin’ around togevver we’ve never before insisted that a fellow should have to stay if he don’t want to. The fact is, I really can’t. Oh well, if I must have a drink, fetch some decent-sized cups and I’ll just put down a couple of quick ones!’ This was clearly the most he would concede and the others perforce acquiesced. Two sconce-cups were brought and ceremoniously filled, Bao-yu holding the cups and Xue Pan pouring from the wine-kettle. Feng Zi-ying drank them standing, one after the other, each in a single breath. ‘Now come on,’ said Bao-yu, ‘let’s hear about this “lucky accident” before you go!’ Feng Zi-ying laughed: ‘Couldn’t tell it properly just now,’ he said. ‘It’s somethin’ that needs a special party all to itself. I’ll invite you all round to my place another day and you shall have the details then. There’s a favour I want to ask too, by the bye, so we’ll be able to talk about that then as well.’ He made a determined movement towards the door. ‘Now you’ve got us all peeing ourselves with curiosity!’ said Xue Pan. ‘You might at least tell us when this party is going to be, to put us out of our suspense.’ ‘Not more than ten days’ time and not less than eight,’ said Feng Zi-ying; and going out into the courtyard, he jumped on his horse and clattered away. Having seen him off, the others went in again, reseated themselves at table, and resumed their potations."
蘅芷清芬　賜名曰蘅蕪苑,Hengzhi Qingfen named Hengwu Garden,"The spot where “the fragrance pure of the ligularia and iris,” was inscribed, she called “the ligularia and the ‘Wu’ weed court;” and where was “the sign in the apricot tree is visible,” she designated “the cottage in the hills where dolichos is bleached.”",Among the other names which she invented for various other parts of the garden were:
轉過牌坊，便是一座宮門，上面橫書四個大字，道是：「孽海情天」。又有一副對聯，大書云：「厚地高天，堪嘆古今情不盡；癡男怨女，可憐風月債難償。」,"Turning the archway, there is a palace gate with four large characters written across it, saying: ""Nie Hai Qing Tian"". There is another couplet, the big book says: ""The earth is thick and the sky is high, it can be sighed that the past and the present are inexhaustible; the foolish man resents the woman, the poor wind and moon debts are difficult to pay.""","Past the Portal stood the door of a Palace, and horizontally, above this door, were the four large characters: “The Sea of Retribution, the Heaven of Love.” There were also a pair of scrolls, with the inscription in large characters: Passion, alas! thick as the earth, and lofty as the skies, from ages past to the present hath held incessant sway; How pitiful your lot! ye lustful men and women envious, that your voluptuous debts should be so hard to pay!","Having negotiated the archway, they presently came to the gateway of a palace. The following words were inscribed horizontally above the lintel: SEAS OF PAIN AND SKIES OF PASSION whilst the following words were inscribed vertically on the two sides: Ancient earth and sky Marvel that love’s passion should outlast all time. Star-crossed men and maids Groan that love’s debts should be so hard to pay."
二人正說著，只見秋紋走進來。說：「快三更了，該睡了。方纔老太太打發嬤嬤來問，我答應睡了。」寶玉命取表來看時，果然針已指到亥正，方從新盥漱，寬衣安歇，不在話下。,"The two were talking when Qiu Wen walked in. He said, ""It's almost the third watch, so it's time to go to bed. The old lady sent my mammy to ask, and I promised to go to bed."" , not to mention.","While these two were chatting, they saw Ch’iu Wen walk in. “It’s the third watch of the night,” she observed, “and you should go to sleep. Just a few moments back your grandmother lady Chia and our lady sent a nurse to ask about you, and I replied that you were asleep.” Pao-yue bade her fetch a watch, and upon looking at the time, he found indeed that the hand was pointing at ten; whereupon rinsing his mouth again and loosening his clothes, he retired to rest, where we will leave him without any further comment.","Their dialogue was interrupted by Ripple, who just at that moment entered the room. ‘It’s nearly midnight, you two. You ought to be in bed. Her Old Ladyship just now sent one of the nannies round to ask about you and I told her you were asleep.’ Bao-yu asked for his watch and looked. The hand was pointing to half past eleven. He washed and cleaned his teeth all over again, and taking off his outer clothes, settled down once more to sleep."
是晚，寶玉李嬤嬤已睡了，他見裏面黛玉和鸚哥猶未安息，他自卸了妝，悄悄進來，笑問：「姑娘怎麼還不安息？」黛玉忙讓：「姐姐請坐。」襲人在床沿上坐了。鸚哥笑道：「林姑娘正在這裏傷心，自己淌眼抹淚的說：『今兒纔來，就惹出你家哥兒的狂病，倘或摔壞了那玉，豈不是因我之過！』因此便傷心，我好容易勸好了。」襲人道：「姑娘快休如此，將來只怕比這個更奇怪的笑話兒還有呢！若為他這種行止，你多心傷感，只怕你傷感不了呢。快別多心！」黛玉道：「姐姐們說的，我記著就是了。究竟那玉不知是怎麼個來歷？上面還有字跡？」襲人道：「連一家子也不知來歷，上頭還有現成的眼兒，聽得說，落草時是從他口裏掏出來的。等我拿來你看便知。」黛玉忙止道：「罷了，此刻夜深，明日再看也不遲。」大家又敘了一回，方纔安歇。,"It was late, Baoyu and Mammy Li had already slept. He saw that Daiyu and parrot were still resting inside. He took off his makeup, came in quietly, and asked with a smile, ""Why is the girl still resting?"" Daiyu hurriedly asked, ""Sister, please. Sit down."" Xiren sat down on the edge of the bed. Parrot said with a smile, ""Miss Lin is sad here, and she said with tears in her eyes, 'I came here today, and I caused your brother's madness. If I broke the jade, it was my fault! So I was sad, and I managed to persuade me.” Xiren said: “Young lady, let it go, I’m afraid there will be more strange jokes than this in the future! If you are so sad because of his behavior, I’m afraid You can't be sad. Don't worry about it!"" Dai Yu said, ""I just remember what the sisters said. What is the origin of that jade? There are writings on it?"" Xiren said: ""Even the family I don't know the origin, but there are ready-made eyes on it. I can hear that it was taken out of his mouth when the grass fell. You will know when I bring it."" It's not too late to watch."" Everyone recited it again before resting.","At night, after nurse Li had fallen asleep, seeing that in the inner chambers, Tai-yue, Ying Ko and the others had not as yet retired to rest, she disrobed herself, and with gentle step walked in. “How is it, miss,” she inquired smiling, “that you have not turned in as yet?” Tai-yue at once put on a smile. “Sit down, sister,” she rejoined, pressing her to take a seat. Hsi Jen sat on the edge of the bed. “Miss Lin,” interposed Ying Ko smirkingly, “has been here in an awful state of mind! She has cried so to herself, that her eyes were flooded, as soon as she dried her tears. ‘It’s only to-day that I’ve come,’ she said, ‘and I’ve already been the cause of the outbreak of your young master’s failing. Now had he broken that jade, as he hurled it on the ground, wouldn’t it have been my fault? Hence it was that she was so wounded at heart, that I had all the trouble in the world, before I could appease her.” “Desist at once, Miss! Don’t go on like this,” Hsi Jen advised her; “there will, I fear, in the future, happen things far more strange and ridiculous than this; and if you allow yourself to be wounded and affected to such a degree by a conduct such as his, you will, I apprehend, suffer endless wounds and anguish; so be quick and dispel this over-sensitive nature!” “What you sisters advise me,” replied Tai-yue, “I shall bear in mind, and it will be all right.” They had another chat, which lasted for some time, before they at length retired to rest for the night.","That night, when Bao-yu and Nannie Li were already asleep, Aroma could hear that Dai-yu and Nightingale on their side of the canopy had still not settled down, so, when she had finished taking down her hair and making herself ready for bed, she tiptoed through the muslin curtains and in a friendly way inquired what was the matter. Dai-yu invited her to sit down, and when she had seated herself on the edge of the bed, Nightingale proceeded to tell her what was troubling her new mistress. ‘Miss Lin is all upset. She has just been crying her eyes out because she says she only just arrived here today, and yet already she has started young hopeful off on one of his turns. She says if that jade had been really smashed, it would have been all her fault. That’s what she’s so upset about. I’ve had no end of a job trying to comfort her.’ ‘You mustn’t take on so, Miss,’ said Aroma. ‘You’ll see him do much stranger things than that before he’s finished. If you allow yourself to feel hurt every time he carries on like that, he will always be hurting you. Try not to be so sensitive, Miss!’ Dai-yu thanked her and promised to bear in mind what she had said, and after talking a little longer, they all settled down and went to sleep."
原來這賈瑞最是個圖便宜沒行止的人，每在學中以公報私，勒索子弟們請他；後又附助著薛蟠圖些銀錢酒肉，一任薛蟠橫行霸道，他不但不去管約，反助紂為虐討好兒。偏那薛蟠本是浮萍心性，今日愛東，明日愛西，近來又有了新朋友，把香、玉二人又丟開一邊。就連金榮亦是當日的好朋友，自有了香、玉二人，便棄了金榮。近日連香、玉亦已見棄。故賈瑞也無了提攜幫襯之人，不說薛蟠得新棄舊，只怨香、玉二人不在薛蟠前提攜幫補他，因此賈瑞金榮等一干人，也正在醋妒他兩個。今見秦、香二人來告金榮，賈瑞心中便更不自在起來，雖不好呵叱秦鍾，卻拿著香憐作法，反說他多事，著實搶白了幾句。香憐反討了沒趣，連秦鍾也訕訕的各歸坐位去了。金榮越發得了意，搖頭咂嘴的，口內還說許多閑話，玉愛偏又聽了不忿，兩個人隔座咕咕唧唧的角起口來。金榮只一口咬定說：「方纔明明的撞見他兩個在後院子裏親嘴摸屁股，一對一肏，撅草根兒抽長短，誰長誰先幹。」金榮只顧得意亂說，卻不防還有別人。誰知早又觸怒了一個。你道這個是誰？,"It turned out that Jia Rui was the most unrepentant person who wanted to be cheap. Every time he made a private report in school, he blackmailed his children to invite him. Later, he assisted Xue Pan to try to get some money, wine and meat. Once Xue Pan was domineering, he not only ignored the contract. , against helping Zhou to curry favor with children. However, Xue Pan was originally a duckweed, who loved the East today and the West tomorrow. Recently, he had a new friend, and he left Xiang and Yu aside. Even Jin Rong was a good friend of that day, and he abandoned Jin Rong when he had Xiang and Jade. Recently, even incense and jade have been abandoned. Therefore, Jia Rui also has no one to help him, not to mention that Xue Pan has abandoned the old and the new, but only complains that Xiang and Yu did not help Xue Pan in the premise, so Jia Rui Jinrong and others are also jealous of the two of them. . Now that Qin and Xiang came to sue Jin Rong, Jia Rui felt even more uncomfortable. Although he was not good at scolding Qin Zhong, he took Xianglian's way and said that he was busy, which really made a few words. Xiang Lian retorted that it was boring, and even Qin Zhong went back to his seat in embarrassment. Jin Rong became more and more complacent, shook his head and smacked his lips, and said a lot of gossip in his mouth. Jin Rong just insisted: ""I just saw the two of them kissing and touching their bottoms in the back yard, one-on-one, smashing the grass roots, and whoever grows will do it first."" Prevent others. Who would have thought that another one would be angered earlier. Do you know who this is?","The fact is that this Chia Jui was, in an extraordinary degree, a man with an eye to the main chance, and devoid of any sense of propriety. His wont was at school to take advantage of public matters to serve his private interest, and to bring pressure upon his pupils with the intent that they should regale him. While subsequently he also lent his countenance to Hsueeh P’an, scheming to get some money or eatables out of him, he left him entirely free to indulge in disorderly behaviour; and not only did he not go out of his way to hold him in check, but, on the contrary, he encouraged him, infamous though he was already, to become a bully, so as to curry favour with him. But this Hsueeh P’an was, by nature, gifted with a fickle disposition; to-day, he would incline to the east, and to-morrow to the west, so that having recently obtained new friends, he put Hsiang Lin and Yue Ai aside. Chin Jung too was at one time an intimate friend of his, but ever since he had acquired the friendship of the two lads, Hsiang Lin and Yue Ai, he forthwith deposed Chin Jung. Of late, he had already come to look down upon even Hsiang Lin and Yue Ai, with the result that Chia Jui as well was deprived of those who could lend him support, or stand by him; but he bore Hsueeh P’an no grudge, for wearying with old friends, as soon as he found new ones, but felt angry that Hsiang Lin and Yue Ai had not put in a word on his behalf with Hsueeh P’an. Chia Jui, Chin Jung and in fact the whole crowd of them were, for this reason, just harbouring a jealous grudge against these two, so that when he saw Ch’in Chung and Hsiang Lin come on this occasion and lodge a complaint against Chin Jung, Chia Jui readily felt displeasure creep into his heart; and, although he did not venture to call Ch’in Chung to account, he nevertheless made an example of Hsiang Lin. And instead (of taking his part), he called him a busybody and denounced him in much abusive language, with the result that Hsiang Lin did not, contrariwise, profit in any way, but brought displeasure upon himself. Even Ch’in Chung grumbled against the treatment, as each of them resumed their places. Chin Jung became still more haughty, and wagging his head and smacking his lips, he gave vent to many more abusive epithets; but as it happened that they also reached Yue Ai’s ears, the two of them, though seated apart, began an altercation in a loud tone of voice. Chin Jung, with obstinate pertinacity, clung to his version. “ Just a short while back,” he said, “I actually came upon them, as they were indulging in demonstrations of intimate friendship in the back court. These two had resolved to be one in close friendship, and were eloquent in their protestations, mindful only in persistently talking their trash, but they were not aware of the presence of another person.” But his language had, contrary to all expectations, given, from the very first, umbrage to another person, and who do you, (gentle reader,) imagine this person to have been?","This Jia Rui was a spineless, unprincipled character who, as a means of obliging lie boys to treat him, always displayed the most shameless favouritism in his settlement of classroom disputes. In return for money, drinks, and dinners, he had lately given Xue Pan a free hand in his nefarious activities – had, indeed, not only refrained from interfering with him, but even ‘aided the tyrant in his tyranny’. Now Xue Pan was very inconstant in his affections, always blowing east one day and west the next. He had recently abandoned Darling and Precious in favour of some newly discovered sweetheart, just as previously he had abandoned Jokey Jin in favour of Darling and Precious. It followed that in this present confrontation Jia Rui, to his chagrin, could not hope to gain any rewards by the exercise of his usual partiality. Instead of blaming this vexatious state of affairs on Xue Pan’s fickleness, however, he directed all his resentment against Darling and Precious, for whom he felt the same unreasonable jealousy as motivated Jokey Jin and the rest. Qin Zhong’s and Darling’s complaint at first put Jia Rui in somewhat of a quandary, for he dared not openly rebuke Qin Zhong. He could, however, give his resentment outlet by making an example of Darling; so instead of dealing with his complaint, he told him that he was a trouble-maker and followed this up with so savage a dressing-down that even Qin Zhong went back to his seat humiliated and crestfallen. Jokey Jin, now thoroughly cock-a-hoop, wagged his head and tutted in a most provoking manner and addressed wounding remarks to no one in particular, which greatly upset Darling and Precious for whose ears they were intended. A furious muttered altercation broke out between them across the intervening desks. Jokey Jin insisted that he had caught Qin Zhong and Darling in flagrante delicto. ‘I ran into them in the back courtyard, kissing each other and feeling arses as plain as anything. I tell you they had it all worked out. They were just measuring themselves for size before getting down to business.’ Reckless in his hour of triumph, he made these wild allegations, unmindful of who might hear them."
少時，寶玉回來，命人去接襲人。只見晴雯躺在床上不動，寶玉因問：「敢是病了？再不然輸了？」秋紋道：「他倒是贏的。誰知李老太太來了，混輸了，他氣的睡去了。」寶玉笑道：「你別和他一般見識，由他去就是了。」說著，襲人已來，彼此相見。襲人又問寶玉何處喫飯，多早晚回來，又代母妹問諸同伴姊妹好。一時換衣卸妝。寶玉命取酥酪來，丫鬟們回說：「李奶奶喫了。」寶玉纔要說話，襲人便忙笑道：「原來是留的這個，多謝費心。前兒我喫的時候好喫，喫過了好肚子疼，足鬧的吐了纔好。他喫了倒好，擱在這裏倒白遭塌了。我只想風乾栗子喫，你替我剝栗子，我去鋪床。」,"When he was young, Baoyu came back and ordered someone to pick him up. Seeing Qingwen lying still on the bed, Baoyu Yin asked, ""Dare you get sick? Or else lose?"" Qiu Wen said, ""He actually won. Who knew that Mrs. Li came and lost, and he slept in anger. Let's go."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Don't have the same knowledge as him, let him go."" After speaking, Xiren came and met each other. Xiren asked Baoyu where to eat, how sooner or later he would come back, and asked all the companions and sisters on behalf of his mother and sister. Temporarily change clothes and remove makeup. Baoyu ordered the cheese to be brought, and the maids replied, ""Grandma Li ate it."" Baoyu was about to speak, but Xiren hurriedly smiled and said, ""So this is the one I kept, thank you for your trouble. When I ate it, it was delicious. After eating it, my stomach hurts, and my feet vomit. It's good for him to eat, but it's just lying here and collapsed. I just want to dry the chestnuts to eat, you peel the chestnuts for me, and I'll make the bed. ""","ill ,” Pao-yue felt constrained to inquire, “or if she isn’t ill, she must have lost at cards.” “Not so!” observed Chiu Wen; “she had been a winner, but dame Li came in quite casually and muddled her so that she lost; and angry at this she rushed off to sleep.” “Don’t place yourselves,” Pao-yue smiled, “on the same footing as nurse Li, and if you were to let her alone, everything will be all right.” These words were still on his lips when Hsi Jen arrived. After the mutual salutations, Hsi Jen went on to ask of Pao-yue: “Where did you have your repast? and what time did you come back?” and to present likewise, on behalf of her mother and sister, her compliments to all the girls, who were her companions. In a short while, she changed her costume and divested herself of her fineries, and Pao-yue bade them fetch the cream. “Nurse Li has eaten it,” the servant-girls rejoined, and as Pao-yue was on the point of making some remark Hsi Jen hastened to interfere, laughing the while; “Is it really this that you had kept for me? many thanks for the trouble; the other day, when I had some, I found it very toothsome, but after I had partaken of it, I got a pain in the stomach, and was so much upset, that it was only after I had brought it all up that I felt all right. So it’s as well that she has had it, for, had it been kept here, it would have been wasted all for no use! What I fancy are dry chestnuts; and while you clean a few for me, I’ll go and lay the bed!”","Presently Bao-yu returned and sent someone off to fetch Aroma. He noticed Skybright lying motionless on the day-bed. ‘What’s the matter with her?’ he asked. ‘Is she ill? Or has she lost the game ?’ ‘She was winning,’ said Ripple. ‘Then Nannie Li came along and put her off her stroke and she started losing. She got so cross that she had to go and lie down.’ ‘You shouldn’t all take the old girl so seriously,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Just leave her to do as she likes and take no notice!’ Just at that moment Aroma arrived and said ‘hullo’ to everyone. She asked Bao-yu where he had eaten and what time he had got back. She also gave her mother’s regards to the other maids. When she had finished changing out of her holiday attire and taken the ‘going-out’ ornaments from her hair, Bao-yu asked someone to fetch the koumiss. There was a chorus of replies from the maids: ‘Nannie Li drank it!’ Bao-yu was about to say something when Aroma cut in with a smile: ‘So that’s what you were saving for me! It was a very kind thought; but last time I had some of that stuff I took too much, being so fond of it, and gave myself a terrible stomachache. It didn’t go away until I’d brought it all up again, and it’s put me off it ever since. It’s a good job really that she did drink it. It would only have got left around and gone bad. Now what I’d really fancy are some dried chestnuts, if you’d like to be peeling them for me while I make up your bed on the kang.’"
周瑞家的這纔往賈母這邊來。穿過穿堂，頂頭忽見他女兒打扮著纔從他婆家來。周瑞家的忙問：「你這會子跑來作什麼？」他女兒笑道：「媽一向身上好？我在家裏等了這半日，媽竟不出去，什麼事情忙的這樣不回家？我等煩了，自己到了老太太跟前請了安了，這會子請太太的安去。媽還有不了的什麼差事，手裏是什麼東西？」周瑞家的笑道：「噯！今兒偏偏的來了個劉姥姥，我自己多事，為他跑了半日；這會子又被姨太太看見了，叫送這個花兒與姑娘奶奶們。這會子還沒送清白呢。你這會子跑來，一定有什麼事情的。」他女兒笑道：「你老人家倒會猜。實對你老人家說，你女婿前兒因多喫了兩杯酒，和人分爭，不知怎的被人放了一把邪火，說他來歷不明，告到衙門裏，要解遞還鄉。所以我來和你老人家商議商議，這個情分，求那一個可了事。」周瑞家的聽了道：「我就知道的。這有什麼大不了的！且家去等，我送了林姑娘的花兒去就回家來。此時太太二奶奶都不得閑兒，你回去等我。這沒有什麼忙的。」他女兒聽如此說，便回去了，還說：「媽，好歹快來。」周瑞家的道：「是了。小人兒家沒經過什麼事，就急得你這樣了。」說著，便往黛玉房中去了。,"Only then did Zhou Rui's family come to Jia's mother's side. Passing through the hall, he saw his daughter dressed up and came from his in-law's house. Zhou Rui's family hurriedly asked, ""What are you doing here?"" His daughter smiled and said, ""Mom has always been well? I waited at home for a long time, but my mother didn't go out. Why don't you come home so busy? I'll wait. I'm tired, I went to the old lady and asked for Ann, and now I will invite the wife's Ann. What errands are there for Mom, what are you holding?"" Zhou Rui's family smiled: ""Ah! I'm here today. Grandma Liu, I was busy with myself and ran for him for a long time; I was seen by my concubine again and asked to send this flower and the girls and grandmothers. I haven't sent my innocence yet. You came here now, there must be something It's a matter of course."" His daughter smiled and said, ""You old man can guess. To tell you the truth, because your son-in-law ate two more glasses of wine, he fought with others, and somehow he was set on a wicked fire. , said that his origin was unknown, and he went to the yamen and wanted to be deported and returned to his hometown. So I came to discuss with your old man, this relationship, please ask that one."" Zhou Rui's family heard it and said, ""I know. What's the big deal! Let's go and wait at home, I'll go home after I've sent Miss Lin's flowers. At this time, both the wife and the second grandmother have no time to spare, so go back and wait for me. It's nothing to be busy."" His daughter listened to this. After saying that, he went back, and said, ""Mom, come soon."" Zhou Rui's family said, ""Yes. The little man's family has not experienced anything, so you are so anxious."" After speaking, he went to Daiyu's room. in.","Chou Jui’s wife thereupon came over to dowager lady Chia’s room on this side of the compound, and as she was going through the Entrance Hall, she casually came, face to face, with her daughter, got up in gala dress, just coming from the house of her mother-in-law. “What are you running over here for at this time?” promptly inquired Mrs. Chou. “Have you been well of late, mother?” asked her daughter. “I’ve been waiting for ever so long at home, but you never come out! What’s there so pressing that has prevented you from returning home? I waited till I was tired, and then went on all alone, and paid my respects to our venerable lady; I’m now, on my way to inquire about our lady Wang. What errand haven’t you delivered as yet, ma; and what is it you’re holding?” “Ai! as luck would have it,” rejoined Chou Jui’s wife smilingly, “old goody Liu came over to-day, so that besides my own hundred and one duties, I’ve had to run about here and there ever so long, and all for her! While attending to these, Mrs. Hsueh came across me, and asked me to take these flowers to the young ladies, and I’ve been at it up to this very moment, and haven’t done yet! But coming at this time, you must surely have something or other that you want me to do for you! what’s it?” “Really ma, you’re quick at guessing!” exclaimed her daughter with a smile; “I’ll tell you what it’s all about. The day before yesterday, your son-in-law had a glass of wine too many, and began altercating with some person or other; and some one, I don’t know why, spread some evil report, saying that his antecedents were not clear, and lodged a charge against him at the Yamen, pressing the authorities to deport him to his native place. That’s why I’ve come over to consult with you, as to whom we should appeal to, to do us this favour of helping us out of our dilemma!” “I knew at once,” Mrs. Chou remarked after listening, “that there was something wrong; but this is nothing hard to settle! Go home and wait for me and I’ll come straightway, as soon as I’ve taken these flowers to Miss Lin; our madame Wang and lady Secunda have both no leisure (to attend to you now,) so go back and wait for me! What’s the use of so much hurry!” Her daughter, upon hearing this, forthwith turned round to go back, when she added as she walked away, “Mind, mother, and make haste.” “All right,” replied Chou Jui’s wife, “of course I will; you are young yet, and without experience, and that’s why you are in this flurry.” As she spoke, she betook herself into Tai-yue’s apartments. Contrary to her expectation","Zhou Rui’s wife now made her way towards Grandmother Jia’s apartments. Just as she was coming out of the covered passage-way, she ran head-on into her daughter, all dressed up in her best clothes having just arrived on a visit from her mother-in-law’s. ‘What’s suddenly brought you here at a time like this?’ she asked her daughter. ‘How have you been keeping, Mother? I’ve been waiting at your place for hours for you to come back. What’s been keeping you all this time ? I got tired of waiting. I thought I’d go and say “hello” to Her Old Ladyship, and now I was just on my way to see Her Ladyship. Have you still not finished then ? What’s that you’ve got in your hand ?’ Zhou Rui’s wife laughed. ‘Today is not my lucky day! First of all someone called Grannie Liu turned up, so like a fool I spend half the day rushing around with her. Then, as if that wasn’t enough, Her Ladyship’s sister sees me and gets me delivering flowers to the young ladies. I haven’t finished yet. Now what have you come here today for ? Something’s gone wrong, I’ll be bound !’ ‘I don’t know how you always manage to guess, Mother, but you’re right : it has. I’ll be honest with you. My man had a cup too much to drink the other day and got into a fight with someone, and now, out of spite, they are trying to stir up trouble for him. They say his papers aren’t in order, and they’ve reported him to the yamen and want to get him deported back South to his old village. So I thought I’d come and ask your advice, Mother, and see if you couldn’t get someone here to put in a word for him. Do you think there’s anyone who would be able to help?’ ‘I knew it would be something like this,’ said Zhou Rui’s wife. ‘ Well, cheer up, it’s not so serious as all that! You just go back and wait while I take these flowers to Miss Lin. You can’t see Her Ladyship now. She and the young mistress are both busy.’ The daughter obediently turned back to her mother’s quarters. As she went, she said pleadingly, ‘Be as quick as you can, Mother, won’t you?’ ‘Yes, yes, yes. I’ll be as quick as I can! You young people take everything so tragically 1 Lack of experience, that’s what it is!’"
一時雜使的老婆子煎了二和藥來。寶玉見他纔有汗意，不肯叫他起來，自己便端著就枕與他喫了，即命小丫頭子們鋪炕。襲人道：「你喫飯不喫飯，到底老太太、太太跟前坐一會子，和姑娘們頑一會子再回來。我就靜靜的躺一躺也好。」寶玉聽說，只得替他去了簪環，看他躺下，自往上房來。同賈母喫畢飯，賈母猶欲同那幾個老管家嬤嬤鬥牌解悶，寶玉記著襲人，便回至房中，見襲人朦朦睡去。自己要睡，天氣尚早。彼時晴雯、綺霞、秋紋、碧痕都尋熱鬧，找鴛鴦琥珀等耍戲去了，獨見麝月一個人在外間房裏燈下抹骨牌。寶玉笑問道：「你怎不同他們頑去？」麝月道：「沒有錢。」寶玉道：「床底下堆著那麼些，還不夠你輸的？」麝月道：「都頑去了，這屋裏交給誰呢？那一個又病了。滿屋裏上頭是燈，地下是火。那些老媽媽子們，老天拔地，伏侍一天，也該叫他們歇歇；小丫頭子們也是伏侍了一天，這會子還不叫他們頑頑去。所以讓他們都去罷，我在這裏看著。」,"The old lady who was a messenger made Erhe medicine. Seeing him, Baoyu felt sweaty and refused to wake him up, so she took the pillow and ate with him, and ordered the little girls to spread the kang. Xiren said, ""If you don't eat, then the old lady and the lady will sit in front of you for a while, and then come back with the girls. I'll just lie down quietly."" Baoyu heard that and had to go for him. He took off the hairpin and watched him lie down and come up to the room. After dinner with Jia's mother, Jia's mother still wanted to fight with the old housekeepers and maids to relieve the boredom. Baoyu remembered the attack, so she went back to the room and saw the attack. Mengmeng fell asleep. I want to sleep, the weather is still early. At that time, Qingwen, Qixia, Qiuwen, and Bihen were all looking for fun, looking for Yuanyang Amber and others to play tricks. She was the only one who saw Sheyue playing dominoes under the lights in the outer room. Baoyu asked with a smile, ""Why don't you be stubborn with them?"" She Yue said, ""I don't have money."" Baoyu said, ""There are so many piles under the bed, isn't it enough for you to lose?"" , Who is this room to be given to? That one is sick again. The room is full of lights above and fire below. Those old mothers and sons, who are in the sky and wait for a day, should also be called to rest; little girl The sons have also been serving for a day, and they are not told to be stubborn at this time. So let them all go, I am here to watch.""","But in a short while, the old matrons employed for all sorts of duties, brought in some mixture of two drugs; and, as Pao-yue noticed that she was just on the point of perspiring, he did not allow her to get up, but readily taking it up to her, she immediately swallowed it, with her head still on her pillow; whereupon he gave speedy directions to the young servant-maids to lay her stove-couch in order. “Whether you mean to have anything to eat or not,” Hsi Jen advised, “you should after all sit for a time with our old mistress and our lady, and have a romp with the young ladies; after which you can come back again; while I, by quietly keeping lying down, will also feel the better.” When Pao-yue heard this suggestion, he had no help but to accede, and, after she had divested herself of her hair-pins and earrings, and he saw her lie down, he betook himself into the drawing-rooms, where he had his repast with old lady Chia. But the meal over, her ladyship felt still disposed to play at cards with the nurses, who had looked after the household for many years; and Pao-yue, bethinking himself of Hsi Jen, hastened to return to his apartments; where seeing that Hsi Jen was drowsily falling asleep, he himself would have wished to go to bed, but the hour was yet early. And as about this time Ch’ing Wen, I Hsia, Ch’in Wen, Pi Hen had all, in their desire of getting some excitement, started in search of Yuean Yang, Hu Po and their companions, to have a romp with them, and he espied She Yueeh alone in the outer room, having a game of dominoes by lamp-light, Pao-yue inquired full of smiles: “How is it you don’t go with them?” “I’ve no money,” She Yueeh replied. “Under the bed,” continued Pao-yue, “is heaped up all that money, and isn’t it enough yet for you to lose from?” “Had we all gone to play,” She Yueeh added, “to whom would the charge of this apartment have been handed over? That other one is sick again, and the whole room is above, one mass of lamps, and below, full of fire; and all those old matrons, ancient as the heavens, should, after all their exertions in waiting upon you from morning to night, be also allowed some rest; while the young servant girls, on the other hand, have likewise been on duty the whole day long, and shouldn’t they even at this hour be left to go and have some distraction? and that’s why I am in here on watch.”","Soon the odd-job woman came in with the second infusion of Aroma’s medicine. Bao-yu could see that she had started sweating again and told her not to get up, holding the medicine for her himself and supporting her while she drank it. Then he told one of the junior maids to make up a bed for her on the kang. ‘Whether you’re going to eat there or not,’ Aroma said to him, ‘you’d better go and sit with Her Old Ladyship and Her Ladyship for a bit and play a while with the young ladies before you come back here again. I shall be all right if I lie here quietly on my own.’ Bao-yu thought he had better do as she said, and after waiting until she had taken off her ornaments and was lying tucked up in bed, he went to the front apartment and took his dinner with Grandmother Jia. After dinner Grandmother Jia wanted to go on playing cards with some of the old stewardesses. Bao-yu, still worrying about Aroma, returned to his own room, where he found her sleeping fitfully. He thought of going to bed himself, but it was still too early. Skybright, Mackerel, Ripple and Emerald had gone off in quest of livelier entertainment, hoping to persuade Grandmother Jia’s maids, Faithful and Amber, to join them in a game. Only Musk was left in the outer room, playing Patience under the lamp with a set of dominoes. Bao-yu smiled at her. ‘Why don’t you go off to join the others ?’ ‘I haven’t got any money.’ ‘There’s a great pile of money under the bed. Isn’t that enough for you to lose?’ ‘If we all went off to play,’ said Musk, ‘who would look after this room ? There’s her sick inside. And lamps and stoves burning everywhere. The old women were practically dead on their feet after waiting on you all day; I had to let them go and rest. And the girls have been on duty all day, too. You could scarcely grudge them some time off now for amusement. -Which leaves only me to look after the place.’"
金氏去後，賈珍方過來坐下，問尤氏道：「今日他來，有什麼說的事情麼？」尤氏答道：「倒沒說什麼。一進來的時候，臉上倒象有些著了惱的氣色似的，及說了半天話，又提起媳婦這病，他倒漸漸的氣色平定了。你又叫讓他喫飯，他聽見媳婦這麼病，也不好意思只管坐著，又說了幾句閑話兒就去了，倒沒求什麼事。如今且說媳婦這病，你到那裏尋一個好大夫來與他瞧瞧要緊，可別耽誤了。現今咱們家走的這群大夫，那裏要得，一個個都是聽著人的口氣兒，人怎麼說，他也添幾句文話兒說一遍。可倒殷勤的很，三四個人一日輪流著倒有四五遍來看脈。他們大家商量著立個方子，喫了也不見效，倒弄得一日換四五遍衣裳，坐起來見大夫，其實於病人無益。」,"After Jin left, Jia Zhenfang came over and sat down and asked You, ""What did he say today when he came?"" You replied, ""I didn't say anything. When I came in, my face was like a He looked like he was annoyed, and after talking for a long time, he mentioned his daughter-in-law's illness again, but his expression gradually calmed down. You asked him to eat again, but he heard that his daughter-in-law was so sick, so he was embarrassed to just sit and talk again. After a few gossips, I went away without asking for anything. Now, let’s talk about the illness of my daughter-in-law. It’s important to find a good doctor there to have a look with him, so don’t delay. The doctors who are leaving our family now, If you want to get it there, everyone listens to the tone of the person. He also adds a few words to say what they say. But he is very attentive. Three or four people take turns to watch it four or five times a day. The pulse. They all discussed making a recipe, but it didn’t work after eating it, so they had to change clothes four or five times a day and sit up to see the doctor, which is actually of no benefit to the patient.”","he asked of Mrs. Yu. “She said nothing much,” replied Mrs. Yu. “When she first entered the room, her face bore somewhat of an angry look, but, after a lengthy chat and as soon as mention of our son’s wife’s illness was made, this angered look after all gradually abated. You also asked me to keep her for the repast, but, having heard that our son’s wife was so ill she could not very well stay, so that all she did was to sit down, and after making a few more irrelevant remarks, she took her departure. But she had no request to make. To return however now to the illness of Jung’s wife, it’s urgent that you should find somewhere a good doctor to diagnose it for her; and whatever you do, you should lose no time. The whole body of doctors who at present go in and out of our household, are they worth having? Each one of them listens to what the patient has to say of the ailment, and then, adding a string of flowery sentences, out he comes with a long rigmarole; but they are exceedingly diligent in paying us visits; and in one day, three or four of them are here at least four and five times in rotation! They come and feel her pulse, they hold consultation together, and write their prescriptions, but, though she has taken their medicines, she has seen no improvement; on the contrary, she’s compelled to change her clothes three and five times each day, and to sit up to see the doctor; a thing which, in fact, does the patient no good.”","When she had gone, Cousin Zhen came in again and sat down. ‘What did she come about today?’ he asked You-shi. ‘Oh,’ said You-shi, ‘nothing in particular. When she first came in she appeared to be upset about something or other, then after we’d been talking for some time and I mentioned that Rong’s wife was ill, she gradually calmed down. When you invited her to dinner she knew she couldn’t very well stay on with sickness in the house and left after chatting a few minutes longer. She didn’t ask for anything before she went. ‘But let’s talk about that child’s illness. The thing is, you really must find a good doctor to look at her, before it gets too late. This lot we have around the house at present are completely useless! Each one of them just listens to what you say and then gives it back to you with a few learned words thrown in. And they’re so terribly conscientious about it! We have three or four of them coming by turns every day, and sometimes they’ll take her pulse four or five times in the same day. Then they have long discussions while they decide on a prescription. None of the medicine does her any good, and the only consequence of all this is that she is having to change her clothes four or five times in a day and be constantly getting up and sitting down to see these doctors, which is no good at all for a person in her condition.’"

石頭笑答道：「我師何太癡耶！若雲無朝代可考，今我師竟假借漢唐等年紀添綴，又有何難？但我想，歷來野史，皆蹈一轍，莫如我這不借此套者，反倒新奇別致，不過只取其事體情理罷了，又何必拘拘於朝代年紀哉！再者，市井俗人喜看理治之書者甚少，愛適趣閑文者特多。歷來野史，或訕謗君相，或貶人妻女，姦淫兇惡，不可勝數。更有一種風月筆墨，壞人子弟，又不可勝數。至若佳人才子等書，則又千部共出一套，且其中終不能不涉於婬濫，以致滿紙潘安、子建、西子、文君，不過作者要寫出自己的那兩首情詩艷賦來，故假擬出男女二人名姓，又必旁出一小人其間撥亂，亦如劇中之小醜然。且鬟婢開口即「者也之乎」，非文即理。故逐一看去，悉皆自相矛盾、大不近情理之話，竟不如我半世親睹親聞的這幾個女子，雖不敢說強似前代書中所有之人，但事跡原委，亦可以消愁破悶；也有幾首歪詩熟話，可以噴飯供酒。至若離合悲歡，興衰際遇，則又追蹤躡跡，不敢稍加穿鑿，徒為供人之目而反失其真傳者。今之人，貧者日為衣食所累，富者又懷不足之心，縱然一時稍閑，又有貪婬戀色、好貨尋愁之事，那裏去有工夫看那理治之書？所以我這一段故事，也不願世人稱奇道妙，也不定要世人喜悅檢讀，只願他們當那醉婬飽臥之時，或避世去愁之際，把此一玩，豈不省了些壽命筋力？就比那謀虛逐妄，卻也省了口舌是非之害，腿腳奔忙之苦。再者，亦令世人換新眼目，不比那些胡牽亂扯，忽離忽遇，滿紙才子淑女、子建文君、紅娘小玉等通共熟套之舊稿。我師意為何如？」,"Shitou smiled and replied: ""My teacher is so stupid! If there is no dynasty to test, what is the difficulty for my teacher to use the age of the Han and Tang Dynasties? I don't take this set, but it is novel and unique, but I only take it as it is, and why should I be bound by the age of the dynasty! Furthermore, few people in the market like to read books on governance, and those who love casual and casual prose There are a lot of unofficial histories, slandering the ruler and the prime minister, degrading his wife and daughter, adultery and viciousness. To come up with a set, and in the end, it must be involved in prostitution, so that the paper is full of Pan An, Zijian, Xizi, and Wenjun, but the author wants to write his own two love poems, so he pretends to name two men and women. surname, and there will be a small person next to it to make trouble, just like the clown in the play. And the maid opens her mouth and says, ""It's what it is"", which is not literal. Therefore, when I look at them one by one, they are all self-contradictory and unreasonable. They are not as good as the women I have seen and heard about for half my life. Although I dare not say that they are as strong as all the people in the previous books, the truth of the story is also true. Dispel sorrow and boredom; there are also a few crooked poems and familiar words, which can be sprinkled with rice and wine. When it comes to the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion, and the ups and downs, you will follow the traces again, and you will not dare to dig a little bit. Today's people, the poor are increasingly burdened with food and clothing, and the rich are not satisfied. Even if they are a little idle for a while, they are greedy and lustful, looking for good things to worry about. Where do you have time to read the book on governance? Therefore, I don’t want the world to call this story wonderful, and I don’t necessarily want the world to read it with pleasure. I just hope that they can play it when they are drunk and lustful, or when they are escaping from the world and worrying about it. Some longevity muscles? It's like conspiring to be false, but it also saves the harm of right and wrong, and the pain of rushing around. In addition, it also makes the world have a new look, not compared to those old manuscripts that are rambling, fluttering and encountering, and are full of talented ladies and gentlemen, Zijianwenjun, Hongniang Xiaoyu, etc. What is my teacher's opinion? ""","“Sir Priest,” the stone replied with assurance, “why are you so excessively dull? The dynasties recorded in the rustic histories, which have been written from age to age, have, I am fain to think, invariably assumed, under false pretences, the mere nomenclature of the Han and T’ang dynasties. They differ from the events inscribed on my block, which do not borrow this customary practice, but, being based on my own experiences and natural feelings, present, on the contrary, a novel and unique character. Besides, in the pages of these rustic histories, either the aspersions upon sovereigns and statesmen, or the strictures upon individuals, their wives, and their daughters, or the deeds of licentiousness and violence are too numerous to be computed. Indeed, there is one more kind of loose literature, the wantonness and pollution in which work most easy havoc upon youth. “As regards the works, in which the characters of scholars and beauties is delineated their allusions are again repeatedly of Wen Chuen, their theme in every page of Tzu Chien; a thousand volumes present no diversity; and a thousand characters are but a counterpart of each other. What is more, these works, throughout all their pages, cannot help bordering on extreme licence. The authors, however, had no other object in view than to give utterance to a few sentimental odes and elegant ballads of their own, and for this reason they have fictitiously invented the names and surnames of both men and women, and necessarily introduced, in addition, some low characters, who should, like a buffoon in a play, create some excitement in the plot. “Still more loathsome is a kind of pedantic and profligate literature, perfectly devoid of all natural sentiment, full of self-contradictions; and, in fact, the contrast to those maidens in my work, whom I have, during half my lifetime, seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears. And though I will not presume to estimate them as superior to the heroes and heroines in the works of former ages, yet the perusal of the motives and issues of their experiences, may likewise afford matter sufficient to banish dulness, and to break the spell of melancholy. “As regards the several stanzas of doggerel verse, they may too evoke such laughter as to compel the reader to blurt out the rice, and to spurt out the wine. “In these pages, the scenes depicting the anguish of separation, the bliss of reunion, and the fortunes of prosperity and of adversity are all, in every detail, true to human nature, and I have not taken upon myself to make the slightest addition, or alteration, which might lead to the perversion of the truth. “My only object has been that men may, after a drinking bout, or after they wake from sleep or when in need of relaxation from the pressure of business, take up this light literature, and not only expunge the traces of antiquated books, and obtain a new kind of distraction, but that they may also lay by a long life as well as energy and strength; for it bears no point of similarity to those works, whose designs are false, whose course is immoral. Now, Sir Priest, what are your views on the subject?”","‘Come, your reverence,’ said the stone (for Vanitas had been correct in assuming that it could speak) ‘must you be so obtuse? All the romances ever written have an artificial period setting – Han or Tang for the most part. In refusing to make use of that stale old convention and telling my Story of the Stone exactly as it occurred, it seems to me that, far from depriving it of anything, I have given it a freshness these other books do not have. ‘Your so-called “historical romances”, consisting, as they do, of scandalous anecdotes about statesmen and emperors of bygone days and scabrous attacks on the reputations of long dead gentlewomen, contain more wickedness and immorality than I care to mention. Still worse is the “erotic novel”, by whose filthy obscenities our young folk are all too easily corrupted. And the “boudoir romances”, those dreary stereotypes with their volume after volume all pitched on the same note and their different characters undistinguishable except by name (all those ideally beautiful young ladies and ideally eligible young bachelors) – even they seem unable to avoid descending sooner or later into indecency. ‘The trouble with this last kind of romance is that it only gets written in the first place because the author requires a framework in which to show off his love-poems. He goes about constructing this framework quite mechanically, beginning with the names of his pair of young lovers and invariably adding a third character, a servant or the like, to make mischief between them, like the chou in a comedy. ‘What makes these romances even more detestable is the stilted, bombastic language – inanities dressed in pompous rhetoric, remote alike from nature and common sense and teeming with the grossest absurdities. ‘Surely my “number of females”, whom I spent half a lifetime studying with my own eyes and ears, are preferable to this kind of stuff? I do not claim that they are better people than the ones who appear in books written before my time; I am only saying that the contemplation of their actions and motives may prove a more effective antidote to boredom and melancholy. And even the inelegant verses with which my story is interlarded could serve to entertain and amuse on those convivial occasions when rhymes and riddles are in demand. ‘All that my story narrates, the meetings and partings, the joys and sorrows, the ups and downs of fortune, are recorded exactly as they happened. I have not dared to add the tiniest bit of touching-up, for fear of losing the true picture. ‘My only wish is that men in the world below may sometimes pick up this tale when they are recovering from sleep or drunkenness, or when they wish to escape from business worries or a fit of the dumps, and in doing so find not only mental refreshment but even perhaps, if they will heed its lesson and abandon their vain and frivolous pursuits, some small arrest in the deterioration of their vital forces. What does your reverence say to that?’"
第十二回,the twelfth,CHAPTER XII.,Chapter 12
但書中所記何事何人？自又云：「今風塵碌碌，一事無成，忽念及當日所有之女子，一一細考較去，覺其行止見識，皆出於我之上。何我堂堂鬚眉，誠不若彼裙釵哉？實愧則有餘、悔又無益之大無可如何之日也！當此，則自欲將已往所賴天恩祖德，錦衣紈袴之時，飫甘饜肥之日，背父兄教育之恩，負師友規談之德，以至今日一技無成、半生潦倒之罪，編述一集，以告天下人。我之罪固不免，然閨閣中本自歷歷有人，萬不可因我之不肖，自護己短，一併使其泯滅也。雖今日之茅椽蓬牖，瓦灶繩床，其晨夕風露，階柳庭花，亦未有妨我之襟懷筆墨者。雖我未學，下筆無文，又何妨用假語村言，敷演出一段故事來，亦可使閨閣昭傳，復可悅世之目，破人愁悶，不亦宜乎？」故曰「賈雨村」云云。,"But who is in the book? He also said: ""Today, I have been busy with dust, and nothing has been accomplished. I suddenly thought of all the women of that day. I examined and compared them one by one, and realized that their actions, deeds, and knowledge came from above me. Why am I so dignified and handsome? It is a day when there is excess of guilt, regret and no benefit! At this time, I want to pass on the grace of my ancestors, the time when I was dressed in brocade, the day when I was rich and sweet, and I would bear the education of my father and brother. The virtues of teachers and friends, and the crime of being unskilled and ruined for half a lifetime today, compiled an episode to tell the world. My sins are inevitable, but there are people in the boudoir, and I must not be unworthy of me because of my unworthiness. Protecting one's own shortcomings, and making them disappear at the same time. Although today's thatched rafters and roofs, tiled stoves and rope beds, the morning and evening wind and dew, and the steps of willows and gardens, it has not hindered my mind. Although I have not learned, I will not write. Wen, why not use false language and village language to act out a story, and it can also make the boudoir famous, so that it can be pleasing to the eyes of the world, and it is not appropriate to break people's depression?"" Therefore, it is called ""Jia Yucun"" and so on.","What are, however, the events recorded in this work? Who are the dramatis personae? Wearied with the drudgery experienced of late in the world, the author speaking for himself, goes on to explain, with the lack of success which attended every single concern, I suddenly bethought myself of the womankind of past ages. Passing one by one under a minute scrutiny, I felt that in action and in lore, one and all were far above me; that in spite of the majesty of my manliness, I could not, in point of fact, compare with these characters of the gentle sex. And my shame forsooth then knew no bounds; while regret, on the other hand, was of no avail, as there was not even a remote possibility of a day of remedy. On this very day it was that I became desirous to compile, in a connected form, for publication throughout the world, with a view to (universal) information, how that I bear inexorable and manifold retribution; inasmuch as what time, by the sustenance of the benevolence of Heaven, and the virtue of my ancestors, my apparel was rich and fine, and as what days my fare was savory and sumptuous, I disregarded the bounty of education and nurture of father and mother, and paid no heed to the virtue of precept and injunction of teachers and friends, with the result that I incurred the punishment, of failure recently in the least trifle, and the reckless waste of half my lifetime. There have been meanwhile, generation after generation, those in the inner chambers, the whole mass of whom could not, on any account, be, through my influence, allowed to fall into extinction, in order that I, unfilial as I have been, may have the means to screen my own shortcomings. Hence it is that the thatched shed, with bamboo mat windows, the bed of tow and the stove of brick, which are at present my share, are not sufficient to deter me from carrying out the fixed purpose of my mind. And could I, furthermore, confront the morning breeze, the evening moon, the willows by the steps and the flowers in the courtyard, methinks these would moisten to a greater degree my mortal pen with ink; but though I lack culture and erudition, what harm is there, however, in employing fiction and unrecondite language to give utterance to the merits of these characters? And were I also able to induce the inmates of the inner chamber to understand and diffuse them, could I besides break the weariness of even so much as a single moment, or could I open the eyes of my contemporaries, will it not forsooth prove a boon? This consideration has led to the usage of such names as Chia Yue-ts’un and other similar appellations.",Chapter 1 Zhen Shi-yin makes the Stone’s acquaintance in a dream And Jia Yu-cun finds that poverty is not incompatible with romantic feelings
自此後，各行匠役齊集，金銀銅錫以及土木磚瓦之物，搬運移送不歇。先令匠人拆寧府會芳園牆垣樓閣，直接入榮府東大院中。榮府東邊所有下人一帶群房盡已拆去。當日寧榮二宅，雖有一小巷界斷不通，然這小巷亦係私地，並非官道，故可以連屬。會芳園本是從北拐角牆下引來一股活水，今亦無煩再引。其山石樹木雖不敷用，賈赦住的乃是榮府舊園，其中竹樹山石以及亭榭欄杆等物，皆可挪就前來。如此兩處又甚近，湊來一處，省得許多財力，縱亦不敷，所添亦有限。全虧一個老明公號山子野者，一一籌畫起造。,"Since then, craftsmen from all walks of life have gathered together, and things such as gold, silver, copper, tin, and civil engineering, bricks and tiles have been transported and transported. Shilling craftsmen tore down the walls and pavilions of Huifang Garden of Ningfu and directly entered the east courtyard of Rongfu. To the east of the Rong Mansion, all the houses in the area of the servants have been demolished. On that day, Ningrong's second house, although there was an alley that was blocked, but this alley was also a private property, not an official road, so it could be connected. Huifang Garden originally drew a stream of living water from under the wall at the north corner, but now there is no need to draw it again. Although the mountains, rocks and trees are not enough, Jia She lives in the old garden of Rongfu, where bamboo trees, rocks, pavilions, railings and other items can be moved. These two places are very close, and if you gather one place, you will save a lot of financial resources, even if it is not enough, the addition is also limited. All thanks to an old man named Shanziye, who made plans one by one.","From this day the masons and workmen of every trade were collected to the full number; and the articles of gold, silver, copper, and pewter, as well as the earth, timber, tiles, and bricks, were brought over, and carried in, in incessant supplies. In the first place, orders were issued to the workmen to demolish the wall and towers of the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, and extend a passage to connect in a straight line with the large court in the East of the Jung mansion; for the whole extent of servants’ quarters on the Eastern side of the Jung mansion had previously been pulled down. The two residences of Ning and Jung were, in these days, it is true, divided by a small street, which served as a boundary line, and there was no communication between them, but this narrow passage was also private property, and not in any way a government street, so that they could easily be connected, and as in the garden of Concentrated Fragrance, there was already a stream of running water, which had been introduced through the corner of the Northern wall, there was no further need now of going to the trouble of bringing in another. Although the rockeries and trees were not sufficient, the place where Chia She lived, was an old garden of the Jung mansion, so that the bamboos, trees, and rockeries in that compound, as well as the arbours, railings and other such things could all be very well removed to the front; and by these means, these two grounds, situated as they were besides so very near to each other, could, by being thrown into one, conduce to the saving of considerable capital and labour; for, in spite of some deficiency, what had to be supplied did not amount to much. And it devolved entirely upon a certain old Hu, a man of note, styled Shan Tzu-yeh, to deliberate upon one thing after another, and to initiate its construction.","After the assembling of builders and artisans the assembling of materials began: a continuous flow of supplies converging on the site from every direction, from precious consignments of gold, silver, copper and tin, to huge, bulky loads of builder’s clay, timber, bricks and tiles. Various walls, including the surrounding walls of the All-scents Garden, and some of the garden’s pavilions were demolished so that the north-west part of the Ning-guo property and the large open court on the north-east side of Rong-guo House were thrown into a single site. A range of servants’ quarters on the east side of the Rong-guo grounds had already been demolished. The Ning-guo and Rong-guo properties had previous to this been divided by an alley-way running from north to south between them, but as it was not a public thoroughfare, no problem was involved in closing it and incorporating part of it in the rest of the new site. The All-scents Garden had been watered by a stream led in by a culvert which ran under a corner of the north wall. Now that the garden was being integrated in the larger site, it was no longer necessary to lead the water in at this point. The artificial hills, rocks, trees and shrubs of All-scents Garden were, of course, insufficient for the whole of the new site; but the area occupied by Jia She was the original garden of Rong-guo House and plentifully supplied with bamboos, trees, rocks, pavilions, kiosks and pergolas capable of being moved elsewhere. By pooling the resources of these two gardens – the All-scents Garden of Ning-guo House and the original Rong-guo garden where Jia She lived – and redistributing them over a single area, it would be possible to make great economies in both labour and materials, and when the estimates came to be made it was found that the requirements, in terms of completely new materials, would be comparatively modest. The conception as a whole and the designs for its execution were alike the work of a well-known landscape gardener familiar to all and sundry by the sobriquet of ‘Horticultural Hu. Jia Zheng was unused to matters of a practical nature and left the management of men and the control of operations to a consortium consisting of Jia She, Cousin Zhen and Jia Lian, the stewards Lai Da, Lai Sheng and Lin Zhi-xiao, the Clerk of Stores Wu Xin-deng, and two of his literary gentlemen, Zhan Guang and Cheng Ri-xing."
〔晚韶華〕　鏡裏恩情，更那堪夢裏功名！那美韶華去之何迅！再休提繡帳鴛衾。只這帶珠冠，披鳳襖，也抵不了無常性命。雖說是，人生莫受老來貧，也須要陰騭積兒孫。氣昂昂頭戴簪纓；光燦燦胸懸金印；威赫赫爵祿高登；昏慘慘黃泉路近。問古來將相可還存？也衹是虛名兒與後人欽敬。,"[Wan Shaohua] The kindness in the mirror is even more worthy of fame in dreams! He Xun, the beauty of Shaohua went away! Then off to mention the embroidered tent quilt. Just wearing a beaded crown and wearing a phoenix coat cannot withstand impermanence. Although it is true, life is not about being old and poor, and it is also necessary to accumulate children and grandchildren. Wearing a hairpin with a high-spirited head; a golden seal hanging on the bright chest; Weihe and Jue Lu Gordon; dim and miserable Huangquan Road is near. Asked whether the ancient will still exist? It is only a false name and the admiration of future generations.","Splendour at last. Loving affection in a mirror will be still more ephemeral than fame in a dream. That fine splendour will fleet how soon! Make no further allusion to embroidered curtain, to bridal coverlet; for though you may come to wear on your head a pearl-laden coronet, and, on your person, a jacket ornamented with phoenixes, yours will not nevertheless be the means to atone for the short life (of your husband)! Though the saying is that mankind should not have, in their old age, the burden of poverty to bear, yet it is also essential that a store of benevolent deeds should be laid up for the benefit of sons and grandsons! (Your son) may come to be dignified in appearance and wear on his head the official tassel, and on his chest may be suspended the gold seal resplendent in lustre; he may be imposing in his majesty, and he may rise high in status and emoluments, but the dark and dreary way which leads to death is short! Are the generals and ministers who have been from ages of old still in the flesh, forsooth? They exist only in a futile name handed down to posterity to reverence!","Eleventh Song: Splendour Come Late Favour, a shadow in the glass; Fame, a dream that soon would pass: The blissful flowering-time of youth soon fled, Soon, too, the pleasures of the bridal bed. A pearl-encrusted crown and robes of state Could not for death untimely compensate; And though each man desires Old age from want made free, True blessedness requires A clutch of young heirs at the knee. Proudly upright The head with cap and bands of office on, And gleaming bright Upon his breast the gold insignia shone. An awesome sight To see him so exalted stand! - Yet the black night Of death’s dark frontier lay close at hand. All those whom history calls great Left only empty names for us to venerate.

Lin Daiyu said with a smile, ""It's really interesting."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""I'm a 'sad and sick body', and you are that 'beautiful country and city'."" Lin Daiyu listened Suddenly, his cheeks and ears turned red, he immediately raised two eyebrows that seemed to be frowning instead of frowning, and stared at two eyes that seemed to be open but not open, with a slight anger on his cheeks, a thin face with anger, pointing to Baoyu and said: ""You This damn nonsense! You got this slutty lyric and pornography well, and learned these nonsense to bully me. I told my uncle and aunt to go."" When it came to the word ""bullying"", he rolled his eyes again. Red, turn around and go. Baoyu was in a hurry, stopped him and said, ""Good sister, please forgive me for this, because I made a mistake. If I have the heart to bully you, I will fall into the pool tomorrow and teach a leprechaun to swallow it. , become a big forgetful eight, and when you become 'Mrs. Yipin' tomorrow, when you are sick and old and return to the West, I will go to your grave to carry the monument for you for a lifetime."" Lin Daiyu said with a sneer, rubbing her eyes. , smiled and said: ""It's usually a joke, and just talk nonsense. 'Bah, it turns out to be a seedling but not a show, it's a silver pewter head.'"" Baoyu heard this and smiled: ""What about you? I Tell me too."" Lin Daiyu smiled and said, ""You said that you can read through your eyes, can't I do ten lines at a time?""","“Cousin, tell me is it nice or not?” Pao-yue grinned. “It is indeed full of zest!” Lin Tai-yue replied exultingly. “I’m that very sad and very sickly person,” Pao-yue explained laughing, “while you are that beauty who could subvert the empire and overthrow the city.” Lin Tai-yue became, at these words, unconsciously crimson all over her cheeks, even up to her very ears; and raising, at the same moment, her two eyebrows, which seemed to knit and yet not to knit, and opening wide those eyes, which seemed to stare and yet not to stare, while her peach-like cheeks bore an angry look and on her thin-skinned face lurked displeasure, she pointed at Pao-yue and exclaimed: “You do deserve death, for the rubbish you talk! without any provocation you bring up these licentious expressions and wanton ballads to give vent to all this insolent rot, in order to insult me; but I’ll go and tell uncle and aunt.” As soon as she pronounced the two words “insult me,” her eyeballs at once were suffused with purple, and turning herself round she there and then walked away; which filled Pao-yue with so much distress that he jumped forward to impede her progress, as he pleaded: “My dear cousin, I earnestly entreat you to spare me this time! I’ve indeed said what I shouldn’t; but if I had any intention to insult you, I’ll throw myself to-morrow into the pond, and let the scabby-headed turtle eat me up, so that I become transformed into a large tortoise. And when you shall have by and by become the consort of an officer of the first degree, and you shall have fallen ill from old age and returned to the west, I’ll come to your tomb and bear your stone tablet for ever on my back!” As he uttered these words, Lin Tai-yue burst out laughing with a sound of “pu ch’ih,” and rubbing her eyes, she sneeringly remarked: “I too can come out with this same tune; but will you now still go on talking nonsense? Pshaw! you’re, in very truth, like a spear-head, (which looks) like silver, (but is really soft as) wax!” “Go on, go on!” Pao-yue smiled after this remark; “and what you’ve said, I too will go and tell!” “You maintain,” Lin Tai-yue rejoined sarcastically, “that after glancing at anything you’re able to recite it; and do you mean to say that I can’t even do so much as take in ten lines with one gaze?”","‘Well,’ said Bao-yu, ‘is it good?’ Dai-yu smiled and nodded. Bao-yu laughed: ‘How can I, full of sickness and of woe, Withstand that face which kingdoms could o’erthrow ?’ Dai-yu reddened to the tips of her ears. The eyebrows that seemed to frown yet somehow didn’t were raised now in anger and the lovely eyes flashed. There was rage in her crimson cheeks and resentment in all her looks. ‘You’re hateful!’ - she pointed a finger at him in angry accusal – ‘deliberately using that horrid play to take advantage of me. I’m going straight off to tell Uncle and Aunt!’ At the words ‘take advantage of me’ her eyes filled with tears, and as she finished speaking she turned from him and began to go. Bao-yu rushed after her and held her back: ‘Please, please forgive me! Dearest coz! If I had the slightest intention of taking advantage of you, may I fall into the water and be eaten up by an old bald-headed turtle! When you have become a great lady and gone at last to your final resting-place, I shall become the stone turtle that stands in front of your grave and spend the rest of eternity carrying your tombstone on my back as a punishment!’ His ridiculous declamation provoked a sudden explosion of mirth. She laughed and simultaneously wiped the tears away with her knuckles: ‘Look at you – the same as ever! Scared as anything, but you still have to go on talking nonsense. Well, I know you now for what you are: “Of silver spear the leaden counterfeit”!’ ‘Well! You can talk!’ said Bao-yu laughing. ‘ Listen to you! Now I’m going off to tell on you!’ ‘You needn’t imagine you’re the only one with a good memory,’ said Dai-yu haughtily. ‘I suppose I’m allowed to remember lines too if I like.’"

It is exactly: whoever rules the country with thousands of golden purples, one or two skirts and hairpins can keep the family together.","she communed within herself, “is that the household is made up of mixed elements, and things might be lost; the second is that the preparations are under no particular control, with the result that, when the time comes, the servants might shirk their duties; the third is that the necessary expenditure being great, there will be reckless disbursements and counterfeit receipts; the fourth, that with the absence of any distinction in the matter of duties, whether large or small, hardship and ease will be unequally shared; and the fifth, that the servants being arrogant, through leniency, those with any self-respect will not brook control, while those devoid of ‘face’ will not be able to improve their ways.” These five were, in point of fact, usages in vogue in the Ning mansion. But as you are unable, reader, to ascertain here how lady Feng set things right, listen to the explanations given in the following chapter.","Because there was no rational division of labour, it always seemed to be someone else’s responsibility whenever a job needed to be done. 3. Because the household’s expenditure was so lavish, money was always getting misappropriated or misspent. 4. Because no distinctions were made between one job and another, the rewards and hardships were unfairly distributed. 5. Because the servants were so arrogant and undisciplined, those with ‘face’ could brook no restraint and those without could win no advancement. If you want to know how Xi-feng dealt with these abuses, you will have to read the chapter which follows."
次日天未明，劉姥姥便起來梳洗了，又將板兒教訓了幾句。那板兒纔五六歲的孩子，一無所知，聽見帶他進城逛去，便喜的無不應承。於是劉姥姥帶他進城，找至寧榮街。來至榮府大門石獅子前，只見簇簇轎馬，劉姥姥便不敢過去，且撣了撣衣服，又教了板兒幾句話，然後蹭到角門前。只見幾個挺胸疊肚指手畫腳的人，坐在大板櫈上，說東談西呢。劉姥姥只得蹭上來問：「太爺們納福。」眾人打量了他一會，便問：「那裏來的？」劉姥姥陪笑道：「我找太太的陪房周大爺的，煩那位太爺替我請他老出來。」那些人聽了，都不瞅睬，半日方說道：「你遠遠的在那牆角下等著，一會子他們家有人就出來的。」內中有一老年人說道：「不要誤他的事，何苦耍他。」因向劉姥姥道：「那周大爺已往南邊去了。他在後一帶住著，他娘子卻在家。你要找時，從這邊繞到後街上後門上去問就是了。」,"The next day, before dawn, Grandma Liu got up to wash up, and taught Ban'er a few more words. That Ban'er, who was only five or six years old, knew nothing about it. He was overjoyed when he heard that he was taking him into the city. So Grandma Liu took him into the city and found him on Ningrong Street. When she came to the stone lion at the gate of the Rong Mansion, she saw a cluster of sedan chairs and horses. Grandma Liu didn't dare to go there. She brushed off her clothes, taught Ban'er a few words, and then rubbed it in front of the corner door. I saw a few people with their chests and stomachs pointing and pointing, sitting on the big bench and talking about things. Grandma Liu had to come up and ask, ""My grandfather is blessed."" The crowd looked at him for a while, and then asked, ""Where did you come from?"" Ask him to come out for me."" Those people listened, but they didn't pay attention, and said half a day, ""You wait under the corner of the wall from a distance, someone from their family will come out in a while."" Among them was an elderly man. He said, ""Don't make a mistake with him, why bother playing with him."" Yin said to Grandma Liu, ""Then Uncle Zhou has gone to the south. He lives in the back area, but his wife is at home. When you are looking for it, go around here. Just go to the back door on the back street and ask.”","That very same evening, they laid their plans, and the next morning before the break of day, old goody Liu speedily got up, and having performed her toilette, she gave a few useful hints to Pan Erh; who, being a child of five or six years of age, was, when he heard that he was to be taken into the city, at once so delighted that there was nothing that he would not agree to. Without further delay, goody Liu led off Pan Erh, and entered the city, and reaching the Ning Jung street, she came to the main entrance of the Jung mansion, where, next to the marble lions, were to be seen a crowd of chairs and horses. Goody Liu could not however muster the courage to go by, but having shaken her clothes, and said a few more seasonable words to Pan Erh, she subsequently squatted in front of the side gate, whence she could see a number of servants, swelling out their chests, pushing out their stomachs, gesticulating with their hands and kicking their feet about, while they were seated at the main entrance chattering about one thing and another. Goody Liu felt constrained to edge herself forward. “Gentlemen,” she ventured, “may happiness betide you!” The whole company of servants scrutinised her for a time. “Where do you come from?” they at length inquired. “I’ve come to look up Mr. Chou, an attendant of my lady’s,” remarked goody Liu, as she forced a smile; “which of you, gentlemen, shall I trouble to do me the favour of asking him to come out?” The servants, after hearing what she had to say, paid, the whole number of them, no heed to her; and it was after the lapse of a considerable time that they suggested: “Go and wait at a distance, at the foot of that wall; and in a short while, the visitors, who are in their house, will be coming out.” Among the party of attendants was an old man, who interposed, “Don’t baffle her object,” he expostulated; “why make a fool of her?” and turning to goody Liu: “This Mr. Chou,” he said, “is gone south: his house is at the back row; his wife is anyhow at home; so go round this way, until you reach the door, at the back street, where, if you will ask about her, you will be on the right track.”","Next day Grannie Liu was up before dawn. As soon as she had washed and done her hair, she set about teaching Ban-er a few words to say to the ladies at the great house – an exercise to which he submitted cheerfully enough, as would any little boy of four or five who had been promised an outing to the great city. That done, she set off on her journey, and in due course made her way to Two Dukes Street. There, at each side of the stone lions which flanked the gates of the Rong Mansion, she saw a cluster of horses and palanquins. Not daring to go straight up, she first dusted down her clothes and rehearsed Ban-er’s little repertoire of phrases before sidling up to one of the side entrances. A number of important-looking gentlemen sat in the gateway sunning their bellies and discoursing with animated gestures on a wide variety of topics. Grannie Liu waddled up to them and offered a respectful salutation. After looking her up and down for a moment or two, they asked her her business. Grannie Liu smiled ingratiatingly. ‘I’ve come to see Old Zhou that used to be in service with Her Ladyship before she married. Could I trouble one of you gentlemen to fetch him out for me ?’ The gentlemen ignored her request and returned to their discussion. After she had waited there for some considerable time one of them said,’ If you stand at that gate along there on the corner, someone from inside the house should be coming out presently.’ But a more elderly man among them protested that it was ‘a shame to send her on a fool’s errand’, and turning to Grannie Liu he said, ‘Old Zhou is away in the South at the moment, but his missus is still at home. She lives round at the back. You’ll have to go from here round to the back gate in the other street and ask for her there.’"
一時，賈璉趕來，賈政問他共有幾種，現今得了幾種，尚欠幾種。賈璉見問，忙向靴桶取靴掖內裝的一個紙折略節來，看了一看，回道：「妝蟒繡堆、刻絲彈墨並各色綢綾大小幔子一百二十架，昨日得了八十架，下欠四十架。簾子二百掛，昨日俱得了。外有猩猩氈簾二百掛，湘妃竹簾二百掛，金絲藤紅漆竹簾二百掛，墨漆竹簾二百掛，五彩線絡盤花簾二百掛，每樣得了一半，也不過秋天都全了。椅搭、桌圍、床裙、桌套，每分一千二百件，也有了。」,"At one point, Jia Lian came, and Jia Zheng asked him how many kinds he had, how many kinds he got now, and how many kinds he still owed. When Jia Lian saw the question, he hurriedly took a small piece of paper from the boot tuck, took a look at it, and replied, ""A pile of embroidered pythons, engraved silk and ink, and a hundred and twenty curtains of various sizes of silk and silk. I got 80 yesterday and owed 40. I got 200 curtains yesterday. There are 200 orangutan felt curtains, 200 Xiangfei bamboo curtains, 200 golden rattan red lacquer bamboo curtains, and ink lacquer bamboo curtains. There are 200 hanging curtains, 200 multicolored thread-winding flower curtains, half of each, but all of them in autumn. There are also 1,200 pieces of chair covers, table surrounds, bed skirts, and table covers. ""","“Of these how many kinds have by this time been got ready? and how many more are short?” At this question, Chia Lien hastily produced, from the flaps of his boot, a paper pocket-book, containing a list, which he kept inside the tops of his boot. After perusing it and reperusing it, he made suitable reply. “Of the hundred and twenty curtains,” he proceeded, “of stiff spotted silks, embroidered with dragons in relief, and of the curtains large and small, of every kind of damask silk, eighty were got yesterday, so that there still remain forty of them to come. The two portieres were both received yesterday; and besides these, there are the two hundred red woollen portieres, two hundred portieres of Hsiang Fei bamboo; two hundred door-screens of rattan, with gold streaks, and of red lacquered bamboo; two hundred portieres of black lacquered rattan; two hundred door-screens of variegated thread-netting with clusters of flowers. Of each of these kinds, half have come in, but the whole lot of them will be complete no later than autumn. Antimacassars, table-cloths, flounces for the beds, and cushions for the stools , there are a thousand two hundred of each, but these likewise are ready and at hand.”","He arrived within moments, and-Jia Zheng questioned him about the types and quantities ordered and the figures for what had already been received and what was still to come. In response to his inquiry Jia Lian extracted a wallet from the leg of his boot, and glancing at a folded schedule inside it, summarized its contents as follows: ‘Curtains, large and small, in various silks and satins -flowered, dragon-spot, sprigged, tapestry, panelled, ink-splash: one hundred and twenty. – Eighty of those were delivered yesterday. That leaves forty to come. – Blinds: two hundred. – Yes. They all arrived yesterday. But then there are the special ones. – Blinds, scarlet felt: two hundred. Speckled bamboo: one hundred. Red lacquered bamboo with gold fleck: one hundred. Black lacquered bamboo: one hundred. Coloured net: two hundred. – We now have half of each of those four kinds. The other half is promised by the end of autumn. – Chair-covers, table-drapes, valances, tablecloths: one thousand two hundred of each. – Those we already have.’"

王夫人道：「可不是呢，也該趁早叫你哥哥嫂子歇歇，他們又心裏不靜。」尤氏說道：「太太們又不常過來，娘兒們多坐一會子去，纔有趣兒，天還早呢。」,"Madam Wang said, ""That's not true.

閑話之間，金榮的母親偏提起昨日賈家學房裏的那事，從頭至尾，一五一十都向他小姑子說了。這璜大奶奶不聽則已，聽了，一時怒從心上起，說道：「這秦鍾小崽子是賈門的親戚，難道榮兒不是賈門的親戚？人都別忒勢利了，況且都作的是什麼有臉的好事！就是寶玉，也犯不上向著他到這個樣。等我去到東府瞧瞧我們珍大奶奶，再向秦鍾他姐姐說說，叫他評評這個理。」這金榮的母親聽了這話，急的了不得，忙說道：「這都是我的嘴快，告訴了姑奶奶了，求姑奶奶別去，別管他們誰是誰非。倘或鬧起來，怎麼在那裏站得住。若是站不住，家裏不但不能請先生，反倒在他身上添出許多嚼用來呢。」璜大奶奶聽了，說道：「那裏管得許多，你等我說了，看是怎麼樣！」也不容他嫂子勸，一面叫老婆子瞧了車，就坐上往寧府裏來。,"During the gossip, Jin Rong's mother brought up the incident in Jia's school room yesterday, and told his sister-in-law from beginning to end. The grandmother Huang didn't listen. After listening, she became angry and said, ""This little Qin Zhong is a relative of Jiamen, isn't Rong'er a relative of Jiamen? Don't be too snobbish, and besides What a shameful deed they have done! Even Baoyu would not be able to do this to him. When I go to Dongfu to see our grandmother Zhen, I will tell Qin Zhong his sister and ask him to comment on this principle. When Jin Rong's mother heard this, she was very anxious, and said quickly, ""It's all my mouth, I told my aunt, please don't go, don't care who they are. If there is trouble, why?"" I can stand there. If I can’t stand up, not only will my family not be able to invite my husband, but we will put a lot of chews on him.” Grandma Huang heard this and said, “There is a lot of control there, wait for me to tell you. , let's see how it goes!"" He didn't allow his sister-in-law to persuade him, so he told the old lady to look at the car, and then got on to the Ning residence.","While engaged in a chat, Chin Jung’s mother accidentally broached the subject of the affair, which had transpired in the schoolroom of the Chia mansion on the previous day, and she gave, for the benefit of her young sister-in-law, a detailed account of the whole occurrence from beginning to end. This Mrs. Huang would not have had her temper ruffled had she not come to hear what had happened; but having heard about it, anger sprung from the very depths of her heart. “This fellow, Ch’in Chung,” she exclaimed, “is a relative of the Chia family, but is it likely that Jung Erh isn’t, in like manner, a relative of the Chia family; and when relatives are many, there’s no need to put on airs! Besides, does his conduct consist, for the most part, of anything that would make one get any face? In fact, Pao-yue himself shouldn’t do injury to himself by condescending to look at him. But, as things have come to this pass, give me time and I’ll go to the Eastern mansion and see our lady Chen and then have a chat with Ch’in Chung’s sister, and ask her to decide who’s right and who’s wrong!” Chin Jung’s mother upon hearing these words was terribly distressed. “It’s all through my hasty tongue,” she observed with vehemence, “ that I’ve told you all, sister-in-law: but please, sister, give up at once the idea of going over to say anything about it! Don’t trouble yourself as to who is in the right, and who is in the wrong; for were any unpleasantness to come out of it, how could we here stand on our legs? and were we not to stand on our legs, not only would we never be able to engage a tutor, but the result will be, on the contrary, that for his own person will be superadded many an expense for eatables and necessaries.” “What do I care about how many?” replied Mrs. Huang; “wait till I’ve spoken about it, and we’ll see what will be the result.” Nor would she accede to her sister-in-law’s entreaties, but bidding, at the same time, the matron look after the carriage, she got into it, and came over to the Ning Mansion.","In the course of conversation Widow Jin soon got on to the subject of yesterday’s affair in the schoolroom and launched into a full account, from which no detail was omitted, of all those happenings. It would have been as well for her if she had not done so, for the effect was to kindle a dangerous anger in the bosom of her sister-in-law. ‘That little beast Qin Zhong!’ said Mrs Huang. ‘ He may be related to the Jias, by marriage, but then so is your boy. What business has he to go throwing his weight about like that, I should like to know? Especially after the disgusting things he had been doing himself. Considering what he’d been up to, even Bao-yu ought not to have sided with him to that extent. Let me go and see Mrs Zhen about this. I shall ask her to let me have it out with Qin Zhong’s sister and see if we can’t get some satisfaction.’ ‘Oh dear, I shouldn’t talk so much! I never meant to tell you this. Please, my dear, I beg of you not to speak to them about it! Never mind the rights and wrongs of the case, if this all gets out, they will make it too hot for my boy to stay on at the school; and if he had to stop going to the school, we should never be able to afford a tutor for him, quite apart from all the extra expense I should have of feeding him during the day.’ ‘Never mind about all that!’ said Mrs Huang. ‘We’ll worry about that after I’ve spoken to them and seen what happens.’ Dismissing her sister-in-law’s entreaties, she sent the old servant-woman out for a cab, and getting inside, drove straight off to the Ning-guo mansion."
且說賈妃在轎內看此園內外如此豪華，因默默嘆息奢華過費。忽又見執拂太監跪請登舟，賈妃乃下輿。只見清流一帶，勢如游龍，兩邊石欄上，皆係水晶玻璃各色風燈，點的如銀花雪浪；上面柳杏諸樹雖無花葉，然皆用通草綢綾紙絹依勢作成，粘於枝上的，每一株懸燈數盞；更兼池中荷荇鳧鷺之屬、亦皆係螺蚌羽毛之類作就的。諸燈上下爭輝，真係玻璃世界，珠寶乾坤。船上亦係各種精緻盆景諸燈，珠簾繡幙，桂楫蘭橈，自不必說。已而入一石港，港上一面匾燈，明現著「蓼汀花漵」四字。,"Let's say that Concubine Jia watched the luxury inside and outside the park from inside the sedan chair, and she silently sighed that she was spending too much luxury. Suddenly, the eunuch Zhifu knelt down and asked to board the boat, and Concubine Jia went down. I saw the Qingliu area, the momentum is like a dragon, on both sides of the stone fence, are all crystal glass wind lamps of various colors, lit like silver flowers and snow waves; although the willow and apricot trees above have no flowers and leaves, they are all made of grass, silk, paper and silk according to the situation. , sticking to the branches, each tree has several hanging lights; moreover, it is also the genus of the lotus and mallard in the pond, which are also made of snails and mussels feathers. All lamps compete for brilliance up and down, it is really the world of glass, the universe of jewelry. There are also all kinds of exquisite bonsai lamps, beaded curtains and embroidered curtains on the boat, and there is no need to say. After entering Yishi Port, there is a plaque on the port with the words ""Lingting Huazhang"" clearly displayed.","she soliloquised. But of a sudden was again seen a eunuch who, on his knees, invited her to get into a boat; and the Chia consort descended from the chair and stepped into the craft, when the expanse of a limpid stream met her gaze, whose grandeur resembled that of the dragon in its listless course. The stone bannisters, on each side, were one mass of air-tight lanterns, of every colour, made of crystal or glass, which threw out a light like the lustre of silver or the brightness of snow. The willow, almond and the whole lot of trees, on the upper side, were, it is true, without blossom and leaves; but pongee and damask silks, paper and lustring had been employed, together with rice-paper, to make flowers of, which had been affixed on the branches. Upon each tree were suspended thousands of lanterns; and what is more, the lotus and aquatic plants, the ducks and water fowl in the pond had all, in like manner, been devised out of conches and clams, plumes and feathers. The various lanterns, above and below, vied in refulgence. In real truth, it was a crystal region, a world of pearls and precious stones. On board the boat were also every kind of lanterns representing such designs as are used on flower-pots, pearl-laden portieres, embroidered curtains, oars of cinnamon wood, and paddles of magnolia, which need not of course be minutely described. They entered a landing with a stone curb; and on this landing was erected a flat lantern upon which were plainly visible the four characters the “Persicary beach and flower-laden bank.”","At that moment a eunuch knelt beside the palanquin and invited the Imperial Concubine to proceed by boat. Stepping out onto the waiting barge she saw an expanse of clear water curving between its banks like a sportive dragon. Lanterns of crystal and glass were fixed to the balustrades which lined the banks, their silvery radiance giving the white marble, in the semi-darkness, the appearance of gleaming drifts of snow. Because of the season, the willows and apricot trees above them were bare and leafless; but in place of leaves they were festooned with hundreds of tiny lanterns, and flowers of gauze, rice-paper and bast had been fastened to the tips of their branches. Other lanterns made of shells and feathers, in the form of lotuses, water-lilies, ducks and egrets floated on the surface of the water below. It would have been hard to say whether the water below or the banks above presented the more brilliant spectacle. Together they combined to make a fairyland of jewelled light. And to these visual delights were added the many charming miniature gardens on the barge itself – not to mention its pearl blinds, embroidered curtains, and the carved and painted oars and paddle with which it was furnished. While Yuan-chun was still admiring all this, her boat approached a landing-stage in a grotto, above which hung a lantern-sign inscribed with these words:"

Everyone in the street praised, ""It's such a lively show, and it's impossible for other people to have it."" Seeing that the fields were so bustling and bustling, Baoyu only sat for a while, then walked away to play around. First, he went inside to chat with You Shi and his maid, his concubine, and then went out the second door. You Shi and others still expected him to come out to watch the play, so they did not take care of him. Jia Zhen, Jia Lian, Xue Pan, etc. just guessed the orders, made fun of them in every way, and did not reason. Even if they didn't see him here for a while, they just went inside, so they didn't ask. As for the servants with Baoyu, those who are older, know that Baoyu will only leave at night when he comes, so some of them go to gamble when they have time, some go to their relatives and friends' houses for New Year's tea, and some are prostitutes or prostitutes. Those who drink, all leave privately, and come back later in the evening; those who are younger all get into the theater to watch the fun.","“Ting L’ang recognises his father,” and “Huang Po-ying deploys the spirits for battle,” and in addition to these, “Sung Hsing-che causes great commotion in the heavenly palace;” “Ghiang T’ai-kung kills the general and deifies him,” and other such like. Soon appeared the spirits and devils in a confused crowd on the stage, and suddenly also became visible the whole band of sprites and goblins, among which were some waving streamers, as they went past in a procession, invoking Buddha and burning incense. The sound of the gongs and drums and of shouts and cries were audible at a distance beyond the lane; and in the whole street, one and all extolled the performance as exceptionally grand, and that the like could never have been had in the house of any other family. Pao-yue, noticing that the commotion and bustle had reached a stage so unbearable to his taste, speedily betook himself, after merely sitting for a little while, to other places in search of relaxation and fun. First of all, he entered the inner rooms, and after spending some time in chatting and laughing with Mrs. Yu, the waiting-maids, and secondary wives, he eventually took his departure out of the second gate; and as Mrs. Yu and her companions were still under the impression that he was going out again to see the play, they let him speed on his way, without so much as keeping an eye over him. Chia Chen, Chia Lien, Hsueh P’an and the others were bent upon guessing enigmas, enforcing the penalties and enjoying themselves in a hundred and one ways, so that even allowing that they had for a moment noticed that he was not occupying his seat, they must merely have imagined that he had gone inside and not, in fact, worried their minds about him. And as for the pages, who had come along with Pao-yue, those who were a little advanced in years, knowing very well that Pao-yue would, on an occasion like the present, be sure not to be going before dusk, stealthily therefore took advantage of his absence, those, who could, to gamble for money, and others to go to the houses of relatives and friends to drink of the new year tea, so that what with gambling and drinking the whole bevy surreptitiously dispersed, waiting for dusk before they came back; while those, who were younger, had all crept into the green rooms to watch the excitement; with the result that Pao-yue perceiving not one of them about bethought himself of a small reading room, which existed in previous","Ding-lang Finds His Father, Huang Bo-yang and the Ghostly Army, Monkey Makes War in Heaven and The Investiture of the Gods. All of them, but especially the last two, seemed to involve much rushing in and out of supernatural beings, and the sound of drums and cymbals and blood-curdling battle-cries, as they whirled into combat across the stage with banners flying and weapons flashing or invoked the names of the Buddha with waving of burning joss-sticks, was positively deafening. It carried into the street outside, where the passers-by smiled appreciatively and told each other that only a family like the Jias could afford theatricals that produced so satisfying a volume of noise. To Bao-yu, however, a little of this kind of thing was more than enough, and after sitting for a short while with the rest, he drifted off to seek his amusement elsewhere. To begin with he went inside and spent some time in bantering conversation with You-shi and the maids and concubines in the women’s quarters. When he went off once more through the inner gate, the women assumed that he was going back to the play and made no attempt to detain him. The menfolk – Cousin Zhen, Jia Lian, Xue Pan and the rest – were engrossed in games of guess-fingers and other convivial aids to drunkenness, and if they noticed his absence at all, assumed that he was inside with the ladies and did not comment on it. As for the pages who had accompanied him: the older ones, estimating that he had almost certainly come over for the day, gave themselves time off to gamble and drink with their cronies or to visit friends and relations outside, confident that if they returned in the evening they would be in time for Bao-yu’s departure. The younger ones wormed their way into the green-room to watch the excitement and get in the way of the actors."
展眼過了一日，原來次日就是王子騰夫人的壽誕，那裏原打發人來請賈母王夫人的，王夫人見賈母不自在，也便不去了。倒是薛姨媽同鳳姐兒並賈家幾個姊妹、寶釵、寶玉一齊都去了，至晚方回。,"A day later, it turned out that the next day was Mrs. Wang Ziteng's birthday. The original person was sent to invite Mrs. Jia's mother, and Mrs. Wang did not go when she saw that Mrs. Jia was uncomfortable. On the contrary, Aunt Xue went with Sister Feng and several sisters of Jia's family, Baochai and Baoyu, and returned until evening.","A day went by. On the morrow fell, in fact, the anniversary of the birth of Wang Tzu-t’eng’s spouse, and some one was despatched from his residence to come and invite dowager lady Chia and Madame Wang. Madame Wang found out however that dowager lady Chia would not avail herself of the invitation, and neither would she go. So Mrs. Hsueeh went along with lady Feng, and the three sisters of the Chia family, and Pao-ch’ai and Pao-yue, and only returned home late in the evening.","Next day was the birthday of Wang Zi-teng’s lady. A message had already been received from that quarter inviting Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang to spend the day with her. Lady Wang would have liked to go but felt unable, even though the invitation was from her brother’s wife, because she could see that Grandmother Jia did not want to. Wang Zi-teng’s other sister, Aunt Xue, went instead, together with his niece Xi-feng, Bao-chai, Bao-yu and the three Jia girls. They did not return until the evening."
一語未了，只聽外面一陣腳步響，丫鬟進來笑道：「寶玉來了！」黛玉心中正疑惑著：「這個寶玉，不知是怎生個憊懶人物，懵懂頑童？倒不見那蠢物也罷了。」心中想著，忽見丫鬟話未報完，已進來了一位年輕的公子：頭上戴著束髮嵌寶紫金冠，齊眉勒著二龍搶珠金抹額；穿一件二色金百蝶穿花大紅箭袖，束著五彩絲攢花結長穗宮條，外罩石青起花八團倭緞排穗褂；登著青緞粉底小朝靴。面若中秋之月，色如春曉之花，鬟若刀裁，眉如墨畫，面如桃瓣，目若秋波。雖怒時而若笑，即瞋視而有情。項上金螭瓔珞，又有一根五色絲條，繫著一塊美玉。黛玉一見，便喫一大驚，心下想道：「好生奇怪，倒象在那裏見過一般，何等眼熟到如此！」只見這寶玉向賈母請了安，賈母便命：「去見你娘來。」寶玉即轉身去了。一時回來，再看，已換了冠帶：頭上週圍一轉的短髮，都結成小辮，紅絲結束，共攢至頂中胎髮，總編一根大辮，黑亮如漆，從頂至梢，一串四顆大珠，用金八寶墜角；身上穿著銀紅撒花半舊大襖，仍舊帶著項圈、寶玉、寄名鎖、護身符等物；下面半露松花撒花綾褲腿，錦邊彈墨襪，厚底大紅鞋。越顯得面如敷粉，唇若施脂；轉盼多情，語言常笑。天然一段風韻，全在眉梢；平生萬種情思，悉堆眼角。看其外貌最是極好，卻難知其底細。後人有《西紅月》二詞，批寶玉極恰，其詞曰：,"Before she could say a word, she heard footsteps outside, and the maid came in and said with a smile, ""Baoyu is here!"" Daiyu was puzzled in her heart: ""I don't know how this Baoyu is a lazy, ignorant urchin? I don't see that stupid. It’s nothing more than things.” Thinking in my heart, I suddenly saw that the maid had not finished reporting, and a young gentleman had entered: wearing a bundle of hair inlaid with a jeweled purple and gold crown on his head, with two dragons grabbing pearls and gold on his eyebrows and wiping his forehead; A two-color golden butterfly wears red arrow sleeves, with multicolored silk and flowers knotted with long spiked palace strips, and the outer cover is aquilted with eight rounds of Japanese satin. His face is like the moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival, the color is like the flowers of spring dawn, the hair is like a knife, the eyebrows are like ink paintings, the face is like peach petals, and the eyes are like autumn waves. Although he is angry and sometimes he laughs, he looks at him with anger and is affectionate. On the neck is a gold yingluo, and there is a five-color silk strip tied with a piece of beautiful jade. When Daiyu saw it, she was shocked and thought to herself, ""It's so strange, it looks like I've seen it there, how familiar it is!"" Seeing that Baoyu greeted Jia's mother, Jia's mother ordered, ""Go. See your mother here."" Baoyu turned around. When I came back and looked again, the crown band had been changed: the short hair around the head were all formed into small braids, and the red silk ended, and they were gathered up to the top and middle tires. At the tip, there is a string of four large beads, with gold and eight treasures hanging at the corners; he wears a half-old coat with silver and red flowers, still wearing collars, precious jade, name locks, amulets, etc. Brocade elastic ink socks, thick-soled red shoes. The more the face is like powder, the lips are like grease; the more affectionate, the language often laughs. There is a natural charm, all in the eyebrows; all the emotions in my life are piled up at the corners of my eyes. Seeing its appearance is the most excellent, but it is difficult to know its details. Later generations have the two words ""West Red Moon"", which criticize Baoyu very appropriately. The word is:","Tai-yue went on to ask. “Books, you say!” exclaimed dowager lady Chia; “why all they know are a few characters, that’s all.” The sentence was barely out of her lips, when a continuous sounding of footsteps was heard outside, and a waiting maid entered and announced that Pao-yue was coming. Tai-yue was speculating in her mind how it was that this Pao-yue had turned out such a good-for-nothing fellow, when he happened to walk in. He was, in fact, a young man of tender years, wearing on his head, to hold his hair together, a cap of gold of purplish tinge, inlaid with precious gems. Parallel with his eyebrows was attached a circlet, embroidered with gold, and representing two dragons snatching a pearl. He wore an archery-sleeved deep red jacket, with hundreds of butterflies worked in gold of two different shades, interspersed with flowers; and was girded with a sash of variegated silk, with clusters of designs, to which was attached long tassels; a kind of sash worn in the palace. Over all, he had a slate-blue fringed coat of Japanese brocaded satin, with eight bunches of flowers in relief; and wore a pair of light blue satin white-soled, half-dress court-shoes. His face was like the full moon at mid-autumn; his complexion, like morning flowers in spring; the hair along his temples, as if chiselled with a knife; his eyebrows, as if pencilled with ink; his nose like a suspended gallbladder (a well-cut and shapely nose); his eyes like vernal waves; his angry look even resembled a smile; his glance, even when stern, was full of sentiment. Round his neck he had a gold dragon necklet with a fringe; also a cord of variegated silk, to which was attached a piece of beautiful jade. As soon as Tai-yue became conscious of his presence, she was quite taken aback. “How very strange!” she was reflecting in her mind; “it would seem as if I had seen him somewhere or other, for his face appears extremely familiar to my eyes;” when she noticed Pao-yue face dowager lady Chia and make his obeisance. “Go and see your mother and then come back,” remarked her venerable ladyship; and at once he turned round and quitted the room. On his return, he had already changed his hat and suit. All round his head, he had a fringe of short hair, plaited into small queues, and bound with red silk. The queues were gathered up at the crown, and all the hair, which had been allowed to grow since his birth, was plaited into a thick queue, which looked as black and as glossy as lacquer. Between the crown of the head and the extremity of the queue, hung a string of four large pearls, with pendants of gold, representing the eight precious things. On his person, he wore a long silvery-red coat, more or less old, bestrewn with embroidery of flowers. He had still round his neck the necklet, precious gem, amulet of Recorded Name, philacteries, and other ornaments. Below were partly visible a fir-cone coloured brocaded silk pair of trousers, socks spotted with black designs, with ornamented edges, and a pair of deep red, thick-soled shoes. (Got up as he was now,) his face displayed a still whiter appearance, as if painted, and his eyes as if they were set off with carnation. As he rolled his eyes, they brimmed with love. When he gave utterance to speech, he seemed to smile. But the chief natural pleasing feature was mainly centred in the curve of his eyebrows. The ten thousand and one fond sentiments, fostered by him during the whole of his existence, were all amassed in the corner of his eyes. His outward appearance may have been pleasing to the highest degree, but yet it was no easy matter to fathom what lay beneath it. There are a couple of roundelays, composed by a later poet, (after the excellent rhythm of the) Hsi Chiang Yueh, which depict Pao-yue in a most adequate manner. The roundelays run as follows:","While they were speaking, a flurry of footsteps could be heard outside and a maid came in to say that Bao-yu was back. ‘I wonder,’ thought Dai-yu, ‘just what sort of graceless creature this Bao-yu is going to be!’ The young gentleman who entered in answer to her unspoken question had a small jewel-encrusted gold coronet on the top of his head and a golden headband low down over his brow in the form of two dragons playing with a large pearl. He was wearing a narrow-sleeved, full-skirted robe of dark red material with a pattern of flowers and butterflies in two shades of gold. It was confined at the waist with a court girdle of coloured silks braided at regular intervals into elaborate clusters of knotwork and terminating in long tassels. Over the upper part of his robe he wore a jacket of slate-blue Japanese silk damask with a raised pattern of eight large medallions on the front and with tasselled borders. On his feet he had half-length dress boots of black satin with thick white soles. As to his person, he had: a face like the moon of Mid-Autumn, a complexion like flowers at dawn, a hairline straight as a knife-cut, eyebrows that might have been painted by an artist’s brush, a shapely nose, and eyes clear as limpid pools, that even in anger seemed to smile, and, as they glared, beamed tenderness the while. Around his neck he wore a golden torque in the likeness of a dragon and a woven cord of coloured silks to which the famous jade was attached. Dai-yu looked at him with astonishment. How strange! How very strange! It was as though she had seen him somewhere before, he was so extraordinarily familiar. Bao-yu went straight past her and saluted his grandmother, who told him to come after he had seen his mother, whereupon he turned round and walked straight out again. Quite soon he was back once more, this time dressed in a completely different outfit. The crown and circlet had gone. She could now see that his side hair was dressed in a number of small braids plaited with red silk, which were drawn round to join the long hair at the back in a single large queue of glistening jet black, fastened at intervals from the nape downwards with four enormous pearls and ending in a jewelled gold clasp. He had changed his robe and jacket for a rather more worn-looking rose-coloured gown, sprigged with flowers. He wore the gold torque and his jade as before, and she observed that the collection of objects round his neck had been further augmented by a padlock-shaped amulet and a lucky charm. A pair of ivy-coloured embroidered silk trousers were partially visible beneath his gown, thrust into black and white socks trimmed with brocade. In place of the formal boots he was wearing thick-soled crimson slippers. She was even more struck than before by his fresh complexion. The cheeks might have been brushed with powder and the lips touched with rouge, so bright was their natural colour. His glance was soulful, yet from his lips the laughter often leaped; a world of charm upon that brow was heaped; a world of feeling from those dark eyes peeped. In short, his outward appearance was very fine. But appearances can be misleading. A perceptive poet has supplied two sets of verses, to be sung to the tune of Moon On West River, which contain a more accurate appraisal of our hero than the foregoing descriptions. 1"
雨村笑道：「果然奇異。只怕這人來歷不小。」,"Amamura smiled and said, ""It's really strange. I'm afraid this person has a lot of origin.""","“Strange indeed!” exclaimed Yue-ts’un with a smile; “but I presume the coming experiences of this being will not be mean.” Tzu-hsing gave a faint smile. “One and all,” he remarked, “entertain the same idea.","‘It certainly is,’ Yu-cun agreed. ‘I should not be at all surprised to find that there was something very unusual in the heredity of that child.’"
趙嬤嬤道：「那是誰不知道的？如今還有個口號兒呢，說『東海少了白玉床，龍王來請江南王』，這說的就是奶奶府上了。還有如今現在江南的甄家，噯喲喲，好勢派！獨他家接駕四次，若不是我們親眼看見，告訴誰誰也不信的。別講銀子成了土泥，憑是世上所有的，沒有不是堆山塞海的，『罪過可惜』四個字竟顧不得了。」,"Mammy Zhao said, ""Who doesn't know about that? There is still a slogan now, saying 'The white jade bed is missing in the East China Sea, the Dragon King has come to invite the King of Jiangnan', which means that the grandmother is in the house. The Zhen family, oh yo yo, the good-wishers! He was the only one who picked him up four times. If we hadn’t seen it with our own eyes and told anyone, we wouldn’t have believed it. Don’t say that money has become mud. Sai Hai's, the words ""sin is a pity"" can't be ignored.""","“Who isn’t aware of these facts?” ventured dame Chao; “there is up to this day a saying that, ‘in the eastern sea, there was a white jade bed required, and the dragon prince came to request Mr. Wang of Chin Ling (to give it to him)!’ This saying relates to your family, my lady, and remains even now in vogue. The Chen family of Chiang Nan has recently held, oh such a fine old standing! it alone has entertained the Emperor on four occasions! Had we not seen these things with our own eyes, were we to tell no matter whom, they wouldn’t surely ever believe them! Not to speak of the money, which was as plentiful as mud, all things, whether they were to be found in the world or not, were they not heaped up like hills, and collected like the waters of the sea? But with the four characters representing sin and pity they didn’t however trouble their minds.”","‘Everybody knows that,’ said Nannie Zhao. ‘There’s even a rhyme about it: The King of the Ocean Goes along, When he’s short of gold beds, To the Nanking Wang. That’s your family: the “Nanking Wangs”. But then there’s the Zhens, who still live down thatway in Kiangnan. My word I There’s riches for you! That family alone received the Emperor four times! If I hadn’t seen with my own two eyes, I don’t care who told me, I wouldn’t have credited it, the sights I saw then] Never mind silver. Silver was just dirt to them. Every precious thing in the world you can think of they had there in mountains! Words like “save” and “spare” they just didn’t seem to know the meaning of!’"
不一時，只見從那邊兩騎馬壓地飛來，離鳳姐車不遠，一齊躥下來，扶車回說：「這裏有下處，奶奶請歇更衣。」鳳姐急命請邢夫人王夫人的示下，那人回來說：「太太們說不用歇了，叫奶奶自便罷。」鳳姐聽了，便命歇了再走。眾小廝聽了，一帶轅馬，岔出人群，往北飛走。寶玉在車內急命請秦相公。,"After a while, I saw two horses flying down from there, not far from Sister Feng's car, they jumped down together, and helped the car back and said, ""There is a place here, grandma, please rest and change."" Sister Feng urgently asked Mrs. Xing and Mrs. After showing it, the man came back and said, ""The wives said you don't need to take a break. Let grandma take care of it."" When Sister Feng heard this, she ordered to take a break before leaving. When the servants heard it, they moved their horses around, branched out from the crowd, and flew north. Baoyu urgently asked Qin Xianggong in the car.","At these words, Pao-yue readily dismounted and climbed up into the carriage occupied by lady Feng; and they both talked and laughed, as they continued their way. But not a long time elapsed before two men, on horseback, were seen approaching from the opposite direction. Coming straight up to lady Feng’s vehicle they dismounted, and said, as they leaned on the sides of her carriage, “There’s a halting place here, and will it not please your ladyship to have a rest and change?” Lady Feng directed them to ask the two ladies Hsing and Wang what they would like to do, and the two men explained: “These ladies have signified that they had no desire to rest, and they wish your ladyship to suit your convenience.” Lady Feng speedily issued orders that they should have a rest, before they prosecuted their way, and the servant youth led the harnessed horses through the crowd of people and came towards the north, while Pao-yue, from inside the carriage, urgently asked that Mr. Ch’in should be requested to come. Ch’in Chung was at this moment on horseback following in the track of his father’s carriage, when unexpectedly he caught sight of Pao-yue’s page, come at a running pace and invite him to have some refreshment.","They had not been driving very long when two horsemen galloped up beside them, dismounted, and leaning into the carriage, informed Xi-feng that they were now near her stopping-place, in case she wished to get out and ‘stretch her legs’. Xi-feng sent them on ahead to ask Lady Xing and Lady Wang for instructions. The latter sent back word that they had no desire to stop, themselves, but that Xi-feng was welcome to do so if she wished. Xi-feng accordingly gave orders for a short halt. At once the pages led the horses out of the main stream of traffic and headed northwards down a small side-road. Bao-yu hurriedly sent someone off to fetch Qin Zhong, who was riding along behind his father’s sedan."
林黛玉聽了，低頭一語不發，半日說道：「你只怨人行動瞋怪了你，你再不知道你自己慪人難受。就拿今日天氣比，分明今兒冷的這樣，你怎麼倒反把個青膁披風脫了呢？」寶玉笑道：「何嘗不穿著，見你一惱，我一暴躁就脫了。」林黛玉嘆道：「回來傷了風，又該訛著吵喫的了。」,"After hearing this, Lin Daiyu lowered her head and said nothing for a long time: ""You only blame people for their actions and blame you. You don't know that you are uncomfortable. Take today's weather as a comparison. It's so cold today, why are you doing the opposite? How about taking off the green cloak?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Why don't you wear it? When I see you angry, I take it off when I'm irritable."" Lin Daiyu sighed, ""I got a cold when I came back, so I should be arguing and eating. .""","Tai-yue at these words, lowered her head and said not a word. But after a long interval, “You only know,” she continued, “how to feel bitter against people for their action in censuring you: but you don’t, after all, know that you yourself provoke people to such a degree, that it’s hard for them to put up with it! Take for instance the weather of to-day as an example. It’s distinctly very cold, to-day, and yet, how is it that you are so contrary as to go and divest yourself of the pelisse with the bluish breast-fur overlapping the cloth?” “Why say I didn’t wear it?” Pao-yue smilingly observed. “I did, but seeing you get angry I felt suddenly in such a terrible blaze, that I at once took it off !” Tai-yue heaved a sigh. “You’ll by and by catch a cold,” she remarked, “and then you’ll again have to starve, and vociferate for something to eat!”","Dai-yu lowered her head and made no reply. After a pause she said: ‘You complain that whatever you do people are always getting angry with you. You don’t seem to realize how much you provoke them by what you do. Take today, for instance. It’s obviously colder today than it was yesterday. Then why of all days should you choose today to leave your blue cape off?’ Bao-yu laughed. ‘I didn’t. I was wearing it this morning the same as usual; but when you started quarrelling just now, I got into such a sweat that I had to take it off.’ ‘Next thing you’ll be catching a cold,’ said Dai-yu with a sigh, ‘and then Heaven knows what grumblings and scoldings there will be !’"
不一時，只見三個奶嬤嬤並五六個丫鬟，簇擁著三個姊妹來了。第一個肌膚微豐，合中身材，腮凝新荔，鼻膩鵝脂，溫柔沉默，觀之可親。第二個削肩細腰，長挑身材，鴨蛋臉面，俊眼修眉，顧盼神飛，文彩精華，見之忘俗。第三個身未長足，形容尚小。其釵環裙襖，三人皆是一樣的妝飾。黛玉忙起身迎上來見禮，互相廝認過，大家歸了坐。丫鬟們斟上茶來。不過說些黛玉之母如何得病，如何請醫服藥，如何送死發喪。不免賈母又傷感起來，因說：「我這些兒女，所疼者獨有你母，今日一旦先捨我而去，連面也不能一見，今見了你，我怎不傷心！」說著，摟了黛玉在懷，又嗚咽起來。眾人忙都寬慰解釋，方略略止住。,"After a while, I saw three grandma and five or six maids, surrounded by three sisters. The first one has slightly plump skin, a mid-sized body, firm cheeks, goose fat on the nose, gentle and silent, and amiable to look at. The second one has shrunk shoulders and slender waist, long slender figure, duck egg face, handsome eyes and eyebrows, looking forward to Shenfei, and the essence of Wencai. The third body has not grown enough, and is described as still small. The hairpin ring skirt and jacket, all three of them have the same makeup. Daiyu got up hurriedly to greet each other, and they recognized each other, and everyone went back to their seats. The maids brought tea. But talk about how Daiyu's mother got sick, how to ask a doctor to take medicine, and how to send her to death. Jia's mother couldn't help but feel sad again, because she said: ""My children, the only one who hurts is your mother. If you leave me today, you can't even see your face. Now that I see you, why don't I feel sad!"" Holding Daiyu in her arms, she whimpered again. Everyone was busy and explained with relief, and Fang slightly stopped.","Not long after three nurses and five or six waiting-maids were seen ushering in three young ladies. The first was somewhat plump in figure and of medium height; her cheeks had a congealed appearance, like a fresh lichee; her nose was glossy like goose fat. She was gracious, demure, and lovable to look at. The second had sloping shoulders, and a slim waist. Tall and slender was she in stature, with a face like the egg of a goose. Her eyes so beautiful, with their well-curved eyebrows, possessed in their gaze a bewitching flash. At the very sight of her refined and elegant manners all idea of vulgarity was forgotten. The third was below the medium size, and her mien was, as yet, childlike. In their head ornaments, jewelry, and dress, the get-up of the three young ladies was identical. Tai-yue speedily rose to greet them and to exchange salutations. After they had made each other’s acquaintance, they all took a seat, whereupon the servants brought the tea. Their conversation was confined to Tai-yue ’s mother,--how she had fallen ill, what doctors had attended her, what medicines had been given her, and how she had been buried and mourned; and dowager lady Chia was naturally again in great anguish. “Of all my daughters,” she remarked, “your mother was the one I loved best, and now in a twinkle, she has passed away, before me too, and I’ve not been able to so much as see her face. How can this not make my heart sore-stricken?” And as she gave vent to these feelings, she took Tai-yue’s hand in hers, and again gave way to sobs; and it was only after the members of the family had quickly made use of much exhortation and coaxing, that they succeeded, little by little, in stopping her tears.","Presently three girls arrived, attended by three nurses and five or six maids. The first girl was of medium height and slightly plumpish, with cheeks as white and firm as a fresh lychee and a nose as white and shiny as soap made from the whitest goose-fat. She had a gentle, sweet, reserved manner. To look at her was to love her. The second girl was rather tall, with sloping shoulders and a slender waist. She had an oval face under whose well-formed brows large, expressive eyes shot out glances that sparkled with animation. To look at her was to forget all that was mean or vulgar. The third girl was undersized and her looks were still somewhat babyish and unformed. All three were dressed in identical skirts and dresses and wore identical sets of bracelets and hair ornaments. Dai-yu rose to meet them and exchanged curtseys and introductions. When she was seated once more, a maid served tea, and a conversation began on the subject of her mother: how her illness had started, what doctors had been called in, what medicines prescribed, what arrangements had been made for the funeral, and how the mourning had been observed. This conversation had the foreseeable effect of upsetting the old lady all over again. ‘Of all my girls your mother was the one I loved the best,’ she said, ‘and now she’s been the first to go, and without my even being able to see her again before the end. I can’t help being upset!’ And holding fast to Dai-yu’s hand, she once more burst into tears. The rest of the company did their best to comfort her, until at last she had more or less recovered."
到了初二日，喫了早飯，來到寧府，看見秦氏的光景，雖未甚添病，但是那臉上身上的肉全瘦乾了。於是和秦氏坐了半日，說了些閑話兒，又將這病無妨的話開導了一遍。秦氏說道：「好不好，春天就知道了。如今現過了冬至，又沒怎麼樣，或者好的了也未可知。嬸子回老太太、太太放心罷。昨日老太太賞的那棗泥餡的山藥糕，我倒喫了兩塊，倒象剋化的動似的。」鳳姐兒說道：「明日再給你送來。我到你婆婆那裏瞧瞧，就要趕著回去回老太太的話去。」秦氏道：「嬸子替我請老太太、太太安罷。」,"On the second day of the first day, after having breakfast, I came to Ning Mansion, and saw the state of Qin Shi. Although he was not very sick, the flesh on his face was completely thin and dry. So I sat with Qin Shi for a long time, talked some gossip, and then enlightened me again with the words that are not harmful to my illness. Qin Shi said: ""Whether it's good or not, we'll know in spring. Now that the winter solstice is over, it's not that bad, or if it's good, I don't know. Auntie can go back to the old lady and madam, don't worry. Yesterday, the old lady rewarded the jujube paste stuffing The yam cake, I ate two pieces, and it seems like a restraint."" Sister Feng said, ""I'll bring it to you tomorrow. I'll take a look at your mother-in-law, and I'll rush back to the old lady's words. ."" Qin said, ""Auntie, please let the old lady and the lady rest for me.""","Lady Feng assented to each of her recommendations; and when the second arrived, she came, after breakfast, to the Ning mansion to see how Mrs. Ch’in was getting on; and though she found her none the worse, the flesh all over her face and person had however become emaciated and parched up. She readily sat with Mrs. Ch’in for a long while, and after they had chatted on one thing and another, she again reiterated the assurances that this illness involved no danger, and distracted her for ever so long. “Whether I get well or not,” observed Mrs. Ch’in, “we’ll know in spring; now winter is just over, and I’m anyhow no worse, so that possibly I may get all right; and yet there’s no saying; but, my dear sister-in-law, do press our old lady to compose her mind! yesterday, her ladyship sent me some potato dumplings, with minced dates in them, and though I had two, they seem after all to be very easily digested!” “I’ll send you round some more to-morrow,” lady Feng suggested; “I’m now going to look up your mother-in-law, and will then hurry back to give my report to our dowager lady.” “Please, sister-in-law,” Mrs. Ch’in said, “present my best respects to her venerable ladyship, as well as to madame Wang.”","Xi-feng promised to do as she had said, and on the second day of the next month she went over to the Ning-guo mansion as soon as she had finished her breakfast. Qin-shi’s sickness appeared to be no worse than previously, but the flesh on her face and body was pitifully wasted. Xi-feng sat for a long time chatting with her, and once more urged her to take a more optimistic view of her illness. ‘We shall know the worst when the spring comes,’ said Qin-shi. ‘At least I’ve got past the solstice without anything happening, so perhaps I shall get better. Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my regards, won’t you. I’ve eaten one or two bits of that yam-cake with the date stuff inside that Grandma sent me yesterday. I found it quite easy to digest.’ ‘I’ll send you some more tomorrow,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Now I must go and see your mother-in-law, and after that I have to hurry back and give my report on you to Grandma.’ ‘Give Grandma and Auntie Wang my love, Auntie.’"
方離柳塢，乍出花房。但行處，鳥驚庭樹；將到時，影度迴廊。僊袂乍飄兮，聞麝蘭之馥郁；荷衣欲動兮，聽環佩之鏗鏘。靨笑春桃兮，雲堆翠髻；唇綻櫻顆兮，榴齒含香。纖腰之楚楚兮，迴風舞雪；珠翠之輝輝兮，滿額鵝黃。出沒花間兮，宜瞋宜喜；徘徊池上兮，若飛若揚。蛾眉顰笑兮，將言而未語；蓮步乍移兮，待止而欲行。羨彼之良質兮，冰清玉潤；慕彼之華服兮，慕灼文章。愛彼之貌容兮，香培玉琢；美彼之態度兮，鳳翥龍翔。其素若何，春梅綻雪。其潔若何，秋菊被霜。其靜若何，松生空穀。其艷若何，霞映澄塘。其文若何，龍游曲沼。其神若何，月射寒江。應慚西子，實愧王嬙。奇矣哉，生於孰地，來自何方；信矣乎，瑤池不二，紫府無雙。果何人哉？如斯之美也！,"Fang Li Liuwu, out of the flower room. But when we walk, the birds startle the trees in the garden; when the time comes, the shadow corridor. Immortal robes fluttered at first, and I heard the fragrance of musk orchid; With a smile like a peach in spring, clouds piled up in a green bun; the lips are full of cherry blossoms, and the teeth are fragrant. The slender waist is graceful, and the wind dances with snow; the brilliance of pearls and greens is full of pale yellow. When you come and go among the flowers, you should be angry and happy; when you wander over the pond, you will feel like flying. The moth frowns and smiles, about to speak but not to speak; the lotus step shifts at a glance, waiting to stop and wants to walk. I admire his good quality, clear and jade-like; I admire his gorgeous clothes, and I admire his articles. The appearance of love is beautiful, and the fragrance of jade is carved; the attitude of beauty is beautiful, and the phoenix is full of dragons. As it is, spring plum blossoms into snow. How clean is it, the autumn chrysanthemum is frosted. How quiet is it, the pine produces an empty valley. How beautiful is its beauty, Xia Ying Chengtang. What is the text of it, Longyou Qu Marsh. What is his god, the moon shoots down the cold river. I should be ashamed of Xizi, but I am really ashamed of Wang Qiang. It's amazing, where was he born, and where did he come from? Believe it, Yaochi is unique, and Zifu is unparalleled. Who is it? Such beauty!","Lo she just quits the willow bank; and sudden now she issues from the flower-bedecked house; As onward alone she speeds, she startles the birds perched in the trees, by the pavilion; to which as she draws nigh, her shadow flits by the verandah! Her fairy clothes now flutter in the wind! a fragrant perfume like unto musk or olea is wafted in the air; Her apparel lotus-like is sudden wont to move; and the jingle of her ornaments strikes the ear. Her dimpled cheeks resemble, as they smile, a vernal peach; her kingfisher coiffure is like a cumulus of clouds; her lips part cherry-like; her pomegranate-like teeth conceal a fragrant breath. Her slender waist, so beauteous to look at, is like the skipping snow wafted by a gust of wind; the sheen of her pearls and kingfisher trinkets abounds with splendour, green as the feathers of a duck, and yellow as the plumes of a goose; Now she issues to view, and now is hidden among the flowers; beautiful she is when displeased, beautiful when in high spirits; with lissome step, she treads along the pond, as if she soars on wings or sways in the air. Her eyebrows are crescent moons, and knit under her smiles; she speaks, and yet she seems no word to utter; her lotus-like feet with ease pursue their course; she stops, and yet she seems still to be in motion; the charms of her figure all vie with ice in purity, and in splendour with precious gems; Lovely is her brilliant attire, so full of grandeur and refined grace. Loveable her countenance, as if moulded from some fragrant substance, or carved from white jade; elegant is her person, like a phoenix, dignified like a dragon soaring high. What is her chastity like? Like a white plum in spring with snow nestling in its broken skin; Her purity? Like autumn orchids bedecked with dewdrops. Her modesty? Like a fir-tree growing in a barren plain; Her comeliness? Like russet clouds reflected in a limpid pool. Her gracefulness? Like a dragon in motion wriggling in a stream; Her refinement? Like the rays of the moon shooting on to a cool river. Sure is she to put Hsi Tzu to shame! Bound to put Wang Ch’iang to the blush! What a remarkable person! Where was she born? and whence does she come? One thing is true that in Fairy-land there is no second like her! that in the Purple Courts of Heaven there is no one fit to be her peer! Forsooth, who can it be, so surpassingly beautiful!","She has left her willow-tree house, from her blossoming bower stepped out; For the birds betray where she walks through the trees that cluster about, And a shadow athwart the winding walk announces that she is near, And a fragrance of musk and orchid from fluttering fairy sleeves, And a tinkle of girdle-gems that falls on the ear At each movement of her dress of lotus leaves. A peach-tree blossoms in her dimpling cheek; Her cloud-coiled tresses are halcyon-sleek; And she reveals, through parted cherry lips, Teeth like pomegranate pips. Her slim waist’s sinuous swaying calls to mind The dance of snowflakes with the waltzing wind; Hair ornaments of pearl and halcyon blue Outshine her painted forehead’s golden hue. Her face, through blossoms fleetingly disclosed, To mirth or ire seems equally disposed; And as by the waterside she goes, Hovering on light-stepping toes, A half-incipient look of pique Says she would speak, yet would not speak; While her feet, with the same irresolution, Would halt, yet would not interrupt their motion. I contemplate her rare complexion, Ice-pure and jade-like in perfection; I marvel at her glittering dress, Where art lends grace to sumptuousness; I wonder at her fine-cut features - Marble, which fragrance marks as one with living creatures; And I admire her queenly gait, Like stately dance of simurgh with his mate. Her purity I can best show In plum-trees flowering in the snow; Her chastity I shall recall In orchids white at first frost-fall; Her tranquil nature will prevail, Constant as lone pine in an empty vale; Her loveliness as dazzled make As sunset gilding a pellucid lake; Her glittering elegance I can compare With dragons in an ornamental mere; Her dreamy soulfulness most seems Like wintry waters in the moon’s cold beams. The beauties of days gone by by her beauty are all abashed. Where was she born, and from whence descended ? Immortal I judge her, fresh come from fairy feastings by the Jasper Pool, Or from fluting in starry halls, some heavenly concert ended. Observing delightedly that the lady was a fairy, Bao-yu hurried forward and saluted her with a smile."
那天約二更時，只見封肅方回來，歡天喜地。眾人忙問端的，他乃說道：「原來本府新昇的太爺姓賈名化，本貫湖州人氏，曾與女婿舊日相交。方纔在咱門前過去，因見嬌杏那丫頭買線，所以他只當女婿移住於此。我一一將原故回明，那太爺倒傷感嘆息了一回；又問外孫女兒，我說看燈丟了。太爺說：『不妨，我自使番役務必探訪回來。』說了一回話，臨走倒送了我二兩銀子。」甄家娘子聽了，不免心中傷感。一宿無話。,"At about the second watch that day, I saw Feng Sufang returning with joy. Everyone was busy asking questions, but he said: ""It turns out that the newly promoted grandfather in this house is Jia Minghua, originally from Huzhou, and he and his son-in-law met in the old days. I just passed by our door, because I saw Jiao Xing's girl buying a line, so He only moved here as a son-in-law. I returned the reasons one by one to Ming, and the grandfather sighed with sadness. He asked his granddaughter, and I said that the lamp was lost. The grandfather said: ""It's okay, I will make sure to visit by the fan. Come back.” After speaking, he gave me two taels of silver before leaving.” The lady of the Zhen family could not help but feel sad when she heard this. A night without words.","It was no earlier than the second watch, when Feng Su returned home; and they, one and all, pressed him with questions as to what had happened. “The fact is,” he explained, “the newly-appointed Magistrate, whose surname is Chia, whose name is Huo and who is a native of Hu-chow, has been on intimate terms, in years gone by, with our son-in-law; that at the sight of the girl Chiao Hsing, standing at the door, in the act of buying thread, he concluded that he must have shifted his quarters over here, and hence it was that his messengers came to fetch him. I gave him a clear account of the various circumstances (of his misfortunes), and the Magistrate was for a time much distressed and expressed his regret. He then went on to make inquiries about my grand-daughter, and I explained that she had been lost, while looking at the illuminations. ‘ No matter,’ put in the Magistrate, ‘I will by and by order my men to make search, and I feel certain that they will find her and bring her back.’ Then ensued a short conversation, after which I was about to go, when he presented me with the sum of two taels.” The mistress of the Chen family (Mrs. Chen Shih-yin) could not but feel very much affected by what she heard, and the whole evening she uttered not a word.","It was ten o’clock before Feng Su returned, and everyone pressed him to give a full account of what had transpired. ‘It seems that the new mandarin is a Hu-zhou man called Jia. He used to be an acquaintance of Shi-yin’s in the old days. He guessed that Shi-yin must have moved to these parts when he saw our Lucky in the doorway buying silks. That’s why he sent the runners here. I explained what had happened to Shi-yin, and he seemed very upset. Then he asked me about Ying-lian, and I said she was lost while out watching the lanterns. “Never mind,” he said, “wait till I send some people out to look for her. We shall have her back in no time.” Then we chatted a bit longer, and just as I was going, he gave me two taels of silver.’ Mrs Zhen could not help being affected by this account. But the rest of that night we pass over in silence."
閑言少敘。且說寶玉自進花園以來，心滿意足，再無別項可生貪求之心。每日只和姊妹丫頭們一處，或讀書，或寫字，或彈琴下棋，作畫吟詩，以至描鸞刺鳳，鬥草簪花，低吟悄唱，拆字猜枚，無所不至，倒也十分快樂。他曾有幾首即事詩，雖不算好，卻倒是真情真景，略記幾首云：,"Less gossip. Let's say that Baoyu has been content since he entered the garden, and there is nothing else that can give rise to greed. I only spend time with my sisters and girls every day, reading, writing, playing the piano, playing chess, painting and reciting poetry, painting phoenixes and phoenixes, fighting grass and hairpins, singing in a low voice, splitting characters and guessing pieces, and going everywhere. very happy. He once wrote a few instant poems, although they are not good, they are true feelings.","Ever since he shifted his quarters into the park, his heart was full of joy, and his mind of contentment, fostering none of those extraordinary ideas, whose tendency could be to give birth to longings and hankerings. Day after day, he simply indulged, in the company of his female cousins and the waiting-maids, in either reading his books, or writing characters, or in thrumming the lute, playing chess, drawing pictures and scanning verses, even in drawing patterns of argus pheasants, in embroidering phoenixes, contesting with them in searching for strange plants, and gathering flowers, in humming poetry with gentle tone, singing ballads with soft voice, dissecting characters, and in playing at mora, so that, being free to go everywhere and anywhere, he was of course completely happy. From his pen emanate four ballads on the times of the four seasons, which, although they could not be looked upon as first-rate, afford anyhow a correct idea of his sentiments, and a true account of the scenery.","But to return to our hero. Life for Bao-yu after his removal into the garden became utterly and completely satisfying. Every day was spent in the company of his maids and cousins in the most amiable and delightful occupations, such as reading, practising calligraphy, strumming on the qin, playing Go, painting, composing verses, embroidering in coloured silks, competitive flower-collecting, making flower-sprays, singing, word games and guess-fingers. In a word, he was blissfully happy. One product of this period was a set of four Garden Nights poems which, though they have little claim to poetic merit, give a fairly accurate impression of the mood and setting of those carefree days:"
且喜賈璉與黛玉回來，先遣人來報信，明日就可到家，寶玉聽了，方略有些喜意。細問原由，方知賈雨村亦進京陛見，皆由王子騰纍上保本，此來候補京缺，與賈璉是同宗弟兄，又與黛玉有師徒之誼，故同路作伴而來。林如海已葬入祖墳了，諸事停妥，賈璉方進京的。本該出月到家，因聞得元春喜信，遂晝夜兼程而進，一路俱各平安。寶玉只問得黛玉「平安」二字，餘者也就不在意了。,"Also, when Jia Lian and Daiyu came back, they sent someone to report and they would be home tomorrow. Baoyu heard that, Fang Wei was slightly overjoyed. After inquiring about the reason, Fang knew that Jia Yucun had also entered the capital to see him, and they were all hired by the prince to save the capital. He came here to fill the capital shortage. He and Jia Lian were brothers of the same clan, and they had the friendship of master and apprentice with Daiyu, so they went together on the same road. Come. Lin Ruhai has been buried in the ancestral tomb, everything has been stopped, and Jia Lian has entered the capital. It was supposed to arrive home from the moon, but when I heard the good news of Yuanchun, I traveled day and night, and all the way was safe. Baoyu only asked Daiyu the word ""peace"", and the rest didn't care.","Luckily, however, Chia Lien and Tai-yue were on their way back, and had despatched messengers, in advance, to announce the news that they would be able to reach home the following day, so that when Pao-yue heard the tidings, he was at length somewhat cheered. And when he came to institute minute inquiries, he eventually found out: “that Chia Yue-ts’un was also coming to the capital to have an audience with His Majesty, that it was entirely because Wang Tzu-t’eng had repeatedly laid before the Throne memorials recommending him that he was coming on this occasion to wait in the metropolis for a vacancy which he could fill up; that as he was a kinsman of Chia Lien’s, acknowledging the same ancestors as he did, and he stood, on the other hand, with Tai-yue, in the relationship of tutor and pupil, he was in consequence following the same road and coming as their companion; that Lin Ju-hai had already been buried in the ancestral vault, and that every requirement had been attended to with propriety; that Chia Lien, on this voyage to the capital, would, had he progressed by the ordinary stages, have been over a month before he could reach home, but that when he came to hear the good news about Yuan Ch’un, he pressed on day and night to enter the capital; and that the whole journey had been throughout, in every respect, both pleasant and propitious.” But Pao-yue merely ascertained whether Tai-yue was all right, and did not even so much as trouble his mind with the rest of what he heard; and he remained on the tiptoe of expectation, till noon of the morrow; when, in point of fact, it was announced that Mr. Lien, together with Miss Lin, had made their entrance into the mansion.","But then there was Jia Lian’s and Dai-yu’s homecoming to look forward to. The advent of the messenger sent on ahead to announce that they would be arriving next day produced the first glimmer of cheerfulness that Bao-yu had so far shown. On being questioned for further details the messenger told them that Jia Yu-cun was also returning to the capital to have an audience with the Emperor. This was the doing of Wang Zi-teng, who had recommended him in a report to the throne for promotion to a metropolitan post. As he was both a cousin (albeit a remote one) of Jia Lian and also Dai-yu’s former teacher, it had been resolved that he should travel with them. Lin Ru-hai having been laid with his ancestors in the family burying-ground and his obsequies duly concluded, they would, if they had proceeded to the capital by the usual stages, have been arriving back some time in the following month; but when Jia Lian heard the news about Yuan-chun’s elevation, they had decided to make greater speed, travelling by night as well as by day. The journey had been smooth and uneventful. Bao-yu merely asked if Dai-yu was all right, and on being assured that she was, paid no further attention to the man’s news."
鳳姐賈蓉等也遙遙的聞得，便都裝作沒聽見。寶玉在車上見這般醉鬧，倒也有趣，因問鳳姐道：「姐姐，你聽見『爬灰的爬灰』，什麼是『爬灰』？」鳳姐聽了，連忙立眉瞋目斷喝道：「少胡說！那是醉漢嘴裏混唚，你是什麼樣人，不說不聽見，還倒細問！等我回去回了太太，仔細捶你不捶你！」唬的寶玉忙央告：「姐姐，我再不敢了。」鳳姐道：「這纔是呢。等回去，咱們回了老太太，打發你同你秦家侄兒學裏念書去要緊。」說著，自回往榮府而來。正是：不因俊俏難為友，正為風流始讀書。,"Sister Feng, Jia Rong and others also heard it from a distance, so they pretended not to hear it. Baoyu was amused to see such a drunken commotion in the car, because she asked Sister Feng, ""Sister, did you hear 'Climbing Ash', what is 'Climbing Ash'?"" Sister Feng immediately frowned. He shouted: ""Stop talking nonsense! That's a drunkard's mouth. What kind of person are you? If you don't say it or hear it, you will ask carefully! When I go back to my wife, I will beat you carefully and not beat you!"" The bluffing Baoyu was busy Yang told: ""Sister, I don't dare any more."" Sister Feng said, ""That's it. When we go back, let's go back to the old lady. It's important to send you and your Qin family nephew to school."" Rongfu came. Exactly: I don't make friends because of being pretty, but I start reading for romance.","Lady Feng and Chia Jung heard all he said from a distance, but pretended not to hear; but Pao-yue, seated in the carriage as he was, also caught this extravagant talk and inquired of lady Feng: “Sister, did you hear him say something about ‘scraping of the ashes?’ What’s it?” “Don’t talk such rubbish!” hastily shouted lady Feng; “it was the maudlin talk of a drunkard! A nice boy you are! not to speak of your listening, but you must also inquire! wait and I’ll tell your mother and we’ll see if she doesn’t seriously take you to task.” Pao-yue was in such a state of fright that he speedily entreated her to forgive him. “My dear sister,” he craved, “I won’t venture again to say anything of the kind” “My dear brother, if that be so, it’s all right!” rejoined lady Feng reassuringly; “on our return we’ll speak to her venerable ladyship and ask her to send some one to arrange matters in the family school, and invite Ch’in Chung to come to school for his studies.” While yet this conversation was going on, they arrived at the Jung Mansion. Reader, do you wish to know what follows?","Big Jiao’s last words had been clearly audible to Xi-feng and Jia Rong, though they were a considerable distance away, but they both pretended not to have heard. Bao-yu, sitting in the carriage with Xi-feng, was less inhibited. ‘Feng, what did he mean when he said “Father-in-law pokes in the ashes ” ?’ ‘Hold your tongue!’ Xi-feng snapped back at him, livid. ‘It’s bad enough for a person in your position to even listen to such drunken filth, but to go asking questions about it, really 1 Just wait till I tell your mother! You’re going to get the biggest hiding you’ve ever had in your life!’ Terrified by her vehemence, Bao-yu implored forgiveness. ‘Please, Feng, don’t tell her! I promise never to say those words again.’ Xi-feng’s manner at once became soothing and indulgent. ‘That’s my good little cuzzy! When we get back I must tell Grandma to make them explain to the school about Qin Zhong and arrange for him to be admitted soon.’ As they talked, the carriage bore them back into Rong-guo House. But what happened there will be told in the chapter which follows."
正說著，可巧鳳姐在窗外過，都聽在耳內。便隔窗說道：「大正月又怎麼了？環兄弟小孩子家，一半點兒錯了，你只教導他，說這些淡話作什麼！憑他怎麼去，還有太太老爺管他呢，就大口啐他！他現是主子，不好了，橫豎有教導他的人，與你什麼相干！環兄弟，出來，跟我頑去。」,"Just as she was talking, coincidentally, Sister Feng passed by outside the window, and she could hear it in her ears. Then he said through the window, ""What happened to the first month of the first month? Brother Huan, the little boy's house, is half wrong. You only teach him what to do with these nonsense words! How can he go, and the wife and master care about him, just Slap him! He is the master now, it's not good, there are people who teach him everywhere, what does it have to do with you! Brother Huan, come out and be stubborn with me.""","As she spoke, lady Feng was, by a strange coincidence, passing outside under the window; so that every word reached her ear, and she speedily asked from outside the window: “What are you up to in this happy first moon? These brothers are, really, but mere children, and will you just for a slight mistake, go on preaching to him! what’s the use of coming out with all you’ve said? Let him go wherever he pleases; for there are still our lady and Mr. Chia Cheng to keep him in order. But you go and sputter him with your gigantic mouth; he’s at present a master, and if there be anything wrong about him, there are, after all, those to rate him; and what business is that of yours? Brother Huan, come out with you, and follow me and let us go and enjoy ourselves.”","Just at that moment Xi-feng happened to be passing by outside, and hearing what she said, shouted back at her through the window: ‘What sort of language is that to be using in the middle of the New Year holiday? He’s only a child. He hasn’t done anything terrible. What do you want to go carrying on at him like that for ? No matter where he’s been, Sir Zheng and Lady Wang are quite capable of looking after him themselves. There’s no cause for you to go biting his head off! After all, he is one of the masters. If he’s misbehaved himself, you should leave the telling-off to those whose job it is. It’s no business of yours. Huan! Come out here! Come and play with me!’"
寶玉因見他外面罩著大紅羽緞對衿褂子，因問：「下雪了麼？」地下婆娘們道：「下了這半日雪珠兒了。」寶玉道：「取了我的斗篷來不曾？」黛玉便道：「是不是，我來了他就該去了。」寶玉笑道：「我多早晚兒說要去了？不過拿來預備著。」寶玉的奶母李嬤嬤因說道：「天又下雪了，也好早晚的了，就在這裏同姐姐妹妹一處頑頑罷。姨媽那裏擺茶菓子呢。我叫丫頭去取了斗篷來，說給小麼兒們散了罷。」寶玉應允。李嬤嬤出去，命小廝們都各散去不提。,"Baoyu saw that he was wearing a big red feather satin facing his jacket, so he asked, ""Is it snowing?"" Didn't you?"" Daiyu said, ""Is it true, he should go when I come."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""How sooner or later did I say I'm going? But it's here to prepare."" He said, ""It's snowing again, so sooner or later, I'll be here with my sister and sister. My aunt is putting tea and fruits there. I asked the girl to get a cloak and told the little ones to leave. That's it."" Baoyu agreed. Mammy Li went out and ordered the servants to leave without mentioning them.","“Is it snowing?” inquired Pao-yue, upon noticing that she wore a cloak made of crimson camlet, buttoning in front. “It has been snowing for some time,” ventured the matrons, who were standing below. “Fetch my wrapper!” Pao-yue remarked, and Tai-yue readily laughed. “Am I not right? I come, and, of course, he must go at once.” “Did I ever mention that I was going?” questioned Pao-yue; “I only wish it brought to have it ready when I want it.” “It’s a snowy day,” consequently remarked Pao-yue’s nurse, dame Li, “and we must also look to the time, but you had better remain here and amuse yourself with your cousin. Your aunt has, in there, got ready tea and fruits. I’ll tell the waiting-maid to go and fetch your wrapper and the boys to return home.” Pao-yue assented, and nurse Li left the room and told the boys that they were at liberty to go.","Observing that Dai-yu was wearing a greatcoat of red camlet over her dress, Bao-yu asked whether it was snowing outside. ‘It’s been snowing for some time,’ said one of the old women standing below the kang. Bao-yu asked someone to go and fetch his winter cape. ‘You see!’ said Dai-yu. ‘When I come, he has to go!’ ‘Who said anything about going?’ said Bao-yu. ‘I just want them to have it ready for me.’ ‘It’s no time to go now, while it’s still snowing,’ said Bao-yu’s old nurse, Nannie Li. ‘Much better stay here and play with your cousins. In any case, I think your Aunt Xue is getting tea ready for you. I’ll send a maid to fetch your cape. Shall I tell the boys outside they can go?’ Bao-yu nodded, and Nannie Li went outside and dismissed the pages."
周瑞家的還欲說話時，忽聽王夫人問：「誰在裏頭說話？」周瑞家的忙出去答應了，趁便回了劉姥姥之事。略待半刻兒，見王夫人無語，方欲退出，薛姨媽忽又笑道：「你且站住。我有一宗東西，你帶了去罷。」說著便叫香菱。簾櫳響處，方纔和金釧頑的那個小女孩子進來了，問：「奶奶叫我作什麼？」薛姨媽道：「把那匣子裏的花兒拿來。」香菱答應了，向那邊捧了個小小錦匣來。薛姨媽道：「這是宮裏頭作的新鮮花樣堆紗花十二支，昨兒我想起來，白放著可惜舊了，何不給他們姊妹們戴去。昨兒要送去，偏又忘了。你今兒來的巧，就帶了去罷。你家的三位姑娘，每人一對，剩下的六枝，送林姑娘兩枝，那四枝給了鳳姐罷。」王夫人道：「留著給寶丫頭戴罷了，又想著他們。」薛姨媽道：「姨娘不知道，寶丫頭古怪著呢，他從來不要這些花兒粉兒的。」,"When Zhou Rui's family was about to speak, he suddenly heard Mrs. Wang ask, ""Who is talking inside?"" After waiting for a while, seeing that Madam Wang was speechless and was about to withdraw, Aunt Xue suddenly smiled and said, ""You stop. I have something, you can take it with me."" She called Xiangling. At the sound of the curtain, the little girl who was just and Jin Chuanyan came in and asked, ""What did grandma tell me to do?"" Aunt Xue said, ""Bring the flowers in the box."" Xiangling agreed and asked the He brought a small brocade box. Aunt Xue said, ""These are twelve flowers made in the palace with fresh patterns. I remembered them yesterday, and it's a pity that they're outdated. Why don't they put them on for their sisters. I wanted to send them yesterday, but I forgot. It’s a coincidence that you came here today, so take it with you. There are three girls in your family, one pair for each, and the remaining six, two for Miss Lin, and the other four for Sister Feng.” Madam Wang said: ""Just keep it for Baby Girl, and think about them."" Aunt Xue said, ""Auntie doesn't know, Baby Girl is weird. He never wants these flowers and powders.""","Mrs. Chou was bent upon making some further remark, when madame Wang was suddenly heard to enquire, “Who is in here?” Mrs. Chou went out hurriedly and answered; and forthwith told her all about old goody Liu’s visit. Having waited for a while, and seeing that madame Wang had nothing to say, she was on the point of retiring, when “aunt” Hsueh unexpectedly remarked smiling: “Wait a bit! I’ve something to give you to take along with you.” And as she spoke, she called for Hsiang Ling. The sound of the screen-board against the sides of the door was heard, and in walked the waiting-maid, who had been playing with Chin Ch’uan-erh. “Did my lady call?” she asked. “Bring that box of flowers,” said Mrs. Hsueh. Hsiang Ling assented, and brought from the other side a small embroidered silk box. “These,” explained “aunt” Hsueeh, “are a new kind of flowers, made in the palace. They consist of twelve twigs of flowers of piled gauze. I thought of them yesterday, and as they will, the pity is, only get old, if uselessly put away, why not give them to the girls to wear them in their hair! I meant to have sent them over yesterday, but I forgot all about them. You come to-day most opportunely, and if you will take them with you, I shall have got them off my hands. To the three young ladies in your family give two twigs each, and of the six that will remain give a couple to Miss Lin, and the other four to lady Feng.” “Better keep them and give them to your daughter Pao Ch’ai to wear,” observed madame Wang, “and have done with it; why think of all the others?” “You don’t know, sister,” replied “aunt” Hsueeh, “what a crotchety thing Pao Ch’ai is! she has no liking for flower or powder.”","Zhou Rui’s wife was about to ask something else when they were interrupted by a call from Lady Wang: ‘Who have you got in there?’ She hurried back into the outer room to make her report on Grannie Liu. Having finished it, she waited for some comment from Lady Wang, but finding that none was forthcoming, was on the point of withdrawing when Aunt Xue smilingly enjoined her to stay. ‘Just a moment! There is something I should like you to take for me.’ She called to someone outside. ‘Caltrop!’ The rings of the portière rattled and the young girl whom Zhou Rui’s wife had seen a few minutes before playing on the steps with Golden came into the room. ‘You called, Madam?’ ‘Bring me that box with the flowers in!’ Caltrop went into a side room and returned with a small embroidered box. ‘There are twelve artificial flowers in here,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘They were made in the Imperial Palace, all in the latest fashion. I suddenly thought to myself yesterday what a pity it was to leave them lying around here doing nothing, and how much nicer it would be to give them to the girls to wear. I meant to send them round yesterday but forgot. It’s lucky that you came here today, because you will be able to take them for me. There are two each for each of the Jia girls. That leaves six. Then two for Miss Lin, and the remaining four for Mrs Lian.’ ‘Keep them for Bao-chai to wear,’ said Lady Wang. ‘What do you want to go bothering about our girls for ?’ ‘You don’t know our Bao-chai. She is funny about these things. She has never liked ornaments or make-up or anything of that sort.’"
門子笑道：「不瞞老爺說，不但這兇犯躲的方向我知道，一併這拐賣之人我也知道，死鬼買主也深知道。待我細說與老爺聽：這個被打之死鬼，乃是本地一個小鄉紳之子，名喚馮淵，自幼父母早亡，又無兄弟，只他一個人守著些薄產過日子。長到十八九歲上，酷愛男風，最厭女子。這也是前生冤孽，可巧遇見這拐子賣丫頭，他便一眼看上了這丫頭，立意買來作妾，立誓再不交結男子，也不再娶第二個了，所以三日後方過門。誰曉這拐子又偷賣與薛家，他意欲卷了兩家的銀子，再逃往他省去，誰知又不曾走脫，被兩家拿住，打了個臭死，都不肯收銀子，衹要領人。那薛家公子豈是讓人的，便喝令手下人一打，將馮公子打了個稀爛，抬回家去，三日死了。這薛公子原是早已擇定日子上京去的，頭起身兩日前，就偶然遇見這丫頭，意欲買了就進京的，誰知鬧出這事來。既打了馮公子，奪了丫頭，他便沒事人一般，只管帶了家眷走他的路。他這裏自有弟兄奴僕在此料理，也並非為此些些小事值得他一逃走的。這且別說，老爺你當被賣之丫頭是誰？」雨村道：「我如何得知。」門子冷笑道：「這人算來還是老爺的大恩人呢！他就是葫蘆廟旁住的甄老爺的小姐，名喚英蓮的。」雨村罕然道：「原來就是他！聞得養至五歲被人拐去，卻如今纔來賣？」,"Menzi said with a smile: ""I don't hide it from the master, not only I know where the murderer is hiding, I also know the person who kidnapped and sold it, and the buyer of the dead ghost knows it well. Let me tell you in detail and listen to the master: This dead ghost who was beaten is the He is the son of a small local squire, named Feng Yuan. His parents died early when he was young, and he has no brothers. He is the only one who guards the poor birth. When he is eighteen or nine years old, he loves men and hates women the most. In his previous life, he happened to meet this kidnapper who sold the girl. He fell in love with this girl at a glance, and decided to buy it as a concubine. He vowed that he would never marry a man or marry a second one, so he went through the door three days later. Who knows this? The kidnapper sold it to the Xue family again. He wanted to take the money from the two families, and then escaped to him to save it. Who knows, he never got away. He was caught by the two families and beaten to death. The important person. Then the son of the Xue family was ordered by others, so he ordered his subordinates to beat him, beat the son to a pulp, carried him home, and died in three days. This son of the Xue family had already set a date to go to Beijing. , Two days before I got up, I met this girl by chance. I wanted to buy it and went to Beijing. Who knew this would happen. After beating Feng Gongzi and taking the girl, he was fine, just took his family and took him away. Lu. He has his own brothers and servants here to take care of him, and it is not for these trivial matters that he should escape. Let alone, who is the girl you are being sold off?"" Amamura said: ""How do I know. Menzi said with a sneer, ""This person is still the master's great benefactor! He is the young lady of Master Zhen who lives next to the Gourd Temple. His name is Yinglian."" You were kidnapped at the age of five, but only come to sell it now?”","“I don’t deceive your Worship,” the Retainer ventured smiling, “when I say that not only do I know the hiding-place of this homicide, but that I also am acquainted with the man who kidnapped and sold the girl; I likewise knew full well the poor devil and buyer, now deceased. But wait, and I’ll tell your worship all, with full details. This person, who succumbed to the assault, was the son of a minor gentry. His name was Feng Yuean. His father and mother are both deceased, and he has likewise no brothers. He looked after some scanty property in order to eke out a living. His age was eighteen or nineteen; and he had a strong penchant for men’s, and not much for women’s society. But this was too the retribution (for sins committed) in a previous existence! for coming, by a strange coincidence, in the way of this kidnapper, who was selling the maid, he straightway at a glance fell in love with this girl, and made up his mind to purchase her and make her his second wife; entering an oath not to associate with any male friends, nor even to marry another girl. And so much in earnest was he in this matter that he had to wait until after the third day before she could enter his household (so as to make the necessary preparations for the marriage). But who would have foreseen the issue? This kidnapper quietly disposed of her again by sale to the Hsueeh family; his intention being to pocket the price-money from both parties, and effect his escape. Contrary to his calculations, he couldn’t after all run away in time, and the two buyers laid hold of him and beat him, till he was half dead; but neither of them would take his coin back, each insisting upon the possession of the girl. But do you think that young gentleman, Mr. Hsueeh, would yield his claim to her person? Why, he at once summoned his servants and bade them have recourse to force; and, taking this young man Feng , they assailed him till they made mincemeat of him. He was then carried back to his home, where he finally died after the expiry of three days. This young Mr. Hsueeh had previously chosen a day, on which he meant to set out for the capital, and though he had beaten the young man Feng to death, and carried off the girl, he nevertheless behaved in the manner of a man who had had no concern in the affair. And all he gave his mind to was to take his family and go along on his way; but not in any wise in order to evade (the consequences) of this (occurrence). This case of homicide, (he looked upon) as a most trivial and insignificant matter, which, (he thought), his brother and servants, who were on the spot, would be enough to settle. But, however, enough of this person. Now does your worship know who this girl is who was sold?” “How could I possibly know?” answered Yue-ts’un. “And yet,” remarked the Retainer, as he laughed coldly, “this is a person to whom you are indebted for great obligations; for she is no one else than the daughter of Mr. Chen, who lived next door to the Hu Lu temple. Her infant name is ‘Ying Lien.’“ “What! is it really she?” exclaimed Yue-ts’un full of surprise. “I heard that she had been kidnapped, ever since she was five years old; but has she only been sold recently?”","‘I wouldn’t deceive Your Honour,’ replied the usher with a grin, ‘not only do I know where the criminal has gone but I also know who the kidnapper is and all about the poor devil who was killed. Let me tell you the whole story. ‘The man who was killed was a poor country squire’s son called Feng Yuan. His father and mother were both dead and he had no brothers. He lived off the income of a very small estate. He was eighteen or nineteen when he died. He was a confirmed queer and not interested in girls. Which shows that the whole business must have been fated, because no sooner did he set eyes on this girl than he at once fell in love with her – swore he would never have anything more to do with boys and never have any other woman but her. That was the idea of this waiting three days before she came to him. To make it seem more like a wedding and less like a sale. ‘What he couldn’t foresee, of course, was that the kidnapper would use this interval to resell her on the sly to Xue, hoping to pocket the money from both parties and then do a flit. Only he didn’t get away with it. The two parties nabbed him before he could disappear and beat the daylights out of him. Both refused to take back their money, and both insisted that they wanted the girl. It was at this point that our young friend Xue called for his roughs to get to work on Feng Yuan. They beat him till he was hardly recognizable. Then they picked him up and carried him home. He died three days later. ‘Now long before any of this happened, young Xue had made arrangements for a journey to the capital. So after killing Feng and carrying off the girl, he set off with his family, calm as you please, on the appointed day. There was no question of his running away because of the killing. In his eyes a trifling matter like taking another man’s life was something for his junior clansmen or the servants to clear up in his absence. ‘But never mind him. Who do you think the slave-girl is ?’ ‘How in the world should I know?’ said Yu-cun. The usher smiled maliciously. ‘ You ought to, Your Honour! She is your great benefactress – Ying-lian, the little daughter of Mr Zhen, who used to live next door to Bottle-gourd Temple.’ ‘Good gracious !’ said Yu-cun in astonishment.’ I had heard that she was kidnapped at the age of five. But how did she come to be sold so long after the kidnapping?’"
賈蓉一一的答應著出去了。正遇著方纔去馮紫英家請那先生的小子回來了，因回道：「奴才方纔到了馮大爺家，拿了老爺的名帖請那先生去。那先生說道：『方纔這裏大爺也向我說了。但是今日拜了一天的客，纔回到家，此時精神實在不能支持，就是去到府上也不能看脈。』他說等調息一夜，明日務必到府。他又說，他『醫學淺薄，本不敢當此重薦，因我們馮大爺和府上的大人既已如此說了，又不得不去，你先替我回明大人就是了。大人的名帖實不敢當』。仍叫奴才拿回來了。哥兒替奴才回一聲兒罷。」賈蓉轉身復進去，回了賈珍尤氏的話，方出來叫了來昇來，吩咐他預備兩日的筵席的話。來昇聽畢，自去照例料理。不在話下。,"Jia Rong agreed one by one and went out. The boy who had just gone to Feng Ziying's house to invite that gentleman came back, because he replied, ""The slave just came to Uncle Feng's house and took the master's famous letter to invite the gentleman. The gentleman said, ""The uncle here also told me just now."" But today, I went home after worshiping a guest for one day. At this time, I couldn’t support my spirit, and I couldn’t even check the pulse even when I went to the house.” He said that after adjusting the breath overnight, he would definitely come to the house tomorrow. He also said, “ The medical science is superficial, so I didn't dare to recommend it again, because our uncle Feng and the adults in the house have already said so, and we have to go. Ask the slave to bring it back. Brother, please reply for the slave."" Jia Rong turned around and went back in, and after replying to Jia Zhenyou's words, Fang came out and called Laisheng to tell him to prepare a two-day banquet. After listening to the promotion, I went to cook as usual. Not a problem.","Chia Jung having signified his obedience to each of her recommendations, and taken his leave, was just in time to meet the youth coming back from Feng Tzu-ying’s house, whither he had gone a short while back to invite the doctor round. “Your slave,” he consequently reported, “has just been with a card of master’s to Mr. Feng’s house and asked the doctor to come. ‘ The gentleman here,’ replied the doctor, ‘has just told me about it; but to-day, I’ve had to call on people the whole day, and I’ve only this moment come home; and I feel now my strength (so worn out), that I couldn’t really stand any exertion. In fact were I even to get as far as the mansion, I shouldn’t be in a fit state to diagnose the pulses! I must therefore have a night’s rest, but, to-morrow for certain, I shall come to the mansion. My medical knowledge,’ he went on to observe, ‘is very shallow, and I don’t deserve the honour of such eminent recommendation; but as Mr. Feng has already thus spoken of me in your mansion, I can’t but present myself. It will be all right if in anticipation you deliver this message for me to your honourable master; but as for your worthy master’s card, I cannot really presume to keep it.’ It was again at his instance that I’ve brought it back; but, Sir, please mention this result for me (to master).” Chia Jung turned back again, and entering the house delivered the message to Chia Chen and Mrs. Yu; whereupon he walked out, and, calling Lai Sheng before him, he transmitted to him the orders to prepare the banquet for a couple of days. After Lai Sheng had listened to the directions, he went off, of course, to get ready the customary preparations; but upon these we shall not dilate, but confine ourselves to the next day. At noon, a servant on duty at the gate announced that the Doctor Chang, who had been sent for, had come, and Chia Chen conducted him along the Court into the large reception Hall, where they sat down; and after they had partaken of tea, he broached the subject.","Jia Rong promised to carry out his mother’s instructions and left the room, encountering, as he did so, the youth who had been sent to Feng Zi-ying’s house to request a call from the doctor. He had just got back from delivering his message and reported to Jia Rong as follows: ‘I took the Master’s card to the doctor at Mr Feng’s house and asked him to call. He said Mr Feng had already spoken to him about it, but he had been out visiting all day and only just got back and he simply didn’t have the energy to go out any more today. He said, “Even if I were to go round to your house now I shouldn’t be able to take the young lady’s pulse. It would take me all night to get my breathing regulated. However,” he said, “I shall definitely call round tomorrow.” And he said, “My knowledge of medicine is really too slight for a consultation of this importance, but as your master and Mr Feng are so pressing, I obviously cannot refuse. But I hope you will explain this to your master.” And he said, “As for your master’s card, that is an honour I really cannot accept”; and he made me bring it back. Will you please pass on this message for me, Master Rong?’ Jia Rong turned and went back into the room to tell his parents. Going out once more, he summoned Lai Sheng and gave instructions for preparing a two-day birthday party, which Lai Sheng duly proceeded to put into operation. But of that no more."
一日正是賈政的生辰，寧榮二處人丁都齊集慶賀，鬧熱非常。忽有門吏忙忙進來，至席前報說：「有六宮都太監夏老爺來降旨。」唬的賈赦賈政等一干人不知是何消息，忙止了戲文，撤去酒席，擺了香案，啟中門跪接。早見六宮都太監夏守忠乘馬而至，前後左右又有許多內監跟從。那夏守忠也並不曾負詔捧敕，至檐前下馬，滿面笑容，走至廳上，南面而立，口內說：「特旨：立刻宣賈政入朝，在臨敬殿陛見。』說畢，也不及喫茶，便乘馬去了。賈赦等不知是何兆頭，只得急忙更衣入朝。,"One day was Jia Zheng's birthday, and everyone from Ning Rong and Ning Rong gathered to celebrate. It was very lively. Suddenly, a doorman came in hastily, and went to the front of the table to report, ""Master Xia, the eunuch of the six palaces, is here to issue an decree."" After the incense case, he opened the door and knelt to pick it up. As soon as I saw Xia Shouzhong, the eunuch of the six palaces, arriving on horseback, there were many internal prisoners following him. That Xia Shouzhong did not bear the decree, dismounted before the eaves, smiled, walked up to the hall, stood on the south, and said in his mouth: ""Special order: Immediately declare Jiazheng to enter the court, and see you in the palace of Linjing."" When it was over, he didn't have time to eat tea, so he rode his horse. Jia She and the others didn't know what the sign was, so they hurriedly changed their clothes and entered the court.","One day, the very day on which Chia Cheng’s birthday fell, while the members of the two households of Ning and Jung were assembled together offering their congratulations, and unusual bustle and stir prevailed, a gatekeeper came in, at quite an unexpected moment, to announce that Mr. Hsia, Metropolitan Head Eunuch of the six palaces, had come with the special purpose of presenting an edict from his Majesty; a bit of news which plunged Chia She, Chia Cheng and the whole company into great consternation, as they could not make out what was up. Speedily interrupting the theatrical performance, they had the banquet cleared, and the altar laid out with incense, and opening the centre gate they fell on their knees to receive the edict. Soon they caught sight of the head eunuch, Hsia Ping-chung, advancing on horseback, and besides himself, a considerable retinue of eunuchs. The eunuch Hsia did not, in fact, carry any mandate or present any decree; but straightway advancing as far as the main hall, he dismounted, and, with a face beaming with smiles, he walked into the Hall and took his stand on the southern side. “I have had the honour,” he said, “of receiving a special order to at once summon Chia Cheng to present himself at Court and be admitted in His Majesty’s presence in the Lin Ching Hall.” When he had delivered this message, he did not so much as take any tea, but forthwith mounted his horse and took his leave. Chia Cheng and the others could not even conceive what omen this summons implied, but he had no alternative but to change his clothes with all haste and to present himself at Court, while dowager lady Chia and the inmates of the whole","The day of Jia Zheng’s birthday arrived and all the members of the Ning-guo and Rong-guo households were gathered together to celebrate it. Just as the festivities were at their height, one of the janitors from the main gate burst in on the assembled company: ‘The Master of the Imperial Bedchamber Mr Xia is on his way, sir, with an announcement from His Majesty the Emperor 1’ Jia She, Jia Zheng and the rest were taken completely by surprise, quite unable to guess what the meaning of this visitation could be. Hurriedly giving orders for the players to halt their performance and for all traces of the feast to be cleared away, they caused a table with burning incense (which would be required for the reading of the Proclamation, if there was one) to be set down in its place. Then, throwing open the centre of the three main gates, they knelt down in the entrance of the mansion to receive their visitor. Soon Xia Bing-zhong, the Eunuch Master of the Bed-chamber, arrived on horseback with a retinue of eunuchs at his back. He appeared to have no Imperial Proclamation or other document on his person, for instead of dismounting, as etiquette prescribed that he should if he was carrying a Written Instrument, he rode straight on to the foot of the main hall. There, with beaming countenance, he got down from his horse, climbed the steps, faced south and gave utterance to the following announcement: ‘By order of His Imperial Majesty: Jia Zheng is commanded to present himself at court immediately for private audience with His Imperial Majesty in the Hall of Reverence.’ Having delivered this message he got straight back on to his horse without staying for so much as a cup of tea and rode away. Still no wiser, Jia Zheng hurried into his court dress and hastened to the Palace, leaving Grandmother Jia and the rest in an extreme state of alarm which they endeavoured (unsuccessfully) to allay by dispatching a regular stream of mounted couriers post-haste to the Palace to inquire for news."
賈母因笑道：「外客未見，就脫了衣裳，還不去見你妹妹！」寶玉早已看見多了一個姊妹，便料定是林姑媽之女，忙來作揖。廝見畢歸坐，細看形容，與眾各別：兩彎似蹙非蹙籠煙眉，一雙似泣非泣含露目。態生兩靨之愁，嬌襲一身之病。淚光點點，嬌喘微微。閑靜時如姣花照水，行動處似弱柳扶風。心較比幹多一竅，病如西子勝三分。寶玉看罷，因笑道：「這個妹妹我曾見過的。」賈母笑道：「可又是胡說，你又何曾見過他？」寶玉笑道：「雖然未曾見過他，然我看著面善，心裏就算是舊相識，今日只作遠別重逢，未為不可。」賈母笑道：「更好，更好，若如此，更相和睦了。」,"Jia Muyin smiled and said, ""She took off her clothes before the foreign guests saw her, and she didn't go to see your sister!"" Baoyu had already seen another sister, so she guessed it was Aunt Lin's daughter, so she hurriedly came to greet her. When the servant saw Bi and sat down, he looked at the description carefully, and it was different from others: the two curved eyebrows were like a frown, but a pair of eyebrows were like weeping. The sorrow of the ecological life, the disease of the whole body. Tears shone a little, and sighed slightly. When it is quiet, it is like a beautiful flower shining on the water, and when it is in action, it is like a weak willow supporting the wind. The heart is more dry and one hole is more, and the disease is like Xizi winning three points. Baoyu stopped looking at it, but smiled and said, ""I have seen this sister before."" Jia Mu smiled and said, ""But it's nonsense, why have you ever seen him?"" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Although I have never seen him, I have Looking at Mian Shan, I thought it was an old acquaintance, but today it's just a long-distance reunion, it's not impossible."" Jia Mu smiled, ""It's better, better, if so, it will be more harmonious.""","“You have gone and changed your clothes,” observed dowager lady Chia, “before being introduced to the distant guest. Why don’t you yet salute your cousin?” Pao-yue had long ago become aware of the presence of a most beautiful young lady, who, he readily concluded, must be no other than the daughter of his aunt Lin. He hastened to advance up to her, and make his bow; and after their introduction, he resumed his seat, whence he minutely scrutinised her features, (which he thought) so unlike those of all other girls. Her two arched eyebrows, thick as clustered smoke, bore a certain not very pronounced frowning wrinkle. She had a pair of eyes, which possessed a cheerful, and yet one would say, a sad expression, overflowing with sentiment. Her face showed the prints of sorrow stamped on her two dimpled cheeks. She was beautiful, but her whole frame was the prey of a hereditary disease. The tears in her eyes glistened like small specks. Her balmy breath was so gentle. She was as demure as a lovely flower reflected in the water. Her gait resembled a frail willow, agitated by the wind. Her heart, compared with that of Pi Kan, had one more aperture of intelligence; while her ailment exceeded (in intensity) by three degrees the ailment of Hsi-Tzu. Pao-yue, having concluded his scrutiny of her, put on a smile and said, “This cousin I have already seen in days gone by.” “There you are again with your nonsense,” exclaimed lady Chia, sneeringly; “how could you have seen her before?” “Though I may not have seen her, ere this,” observed Pao-yue with a smirk, “yet when I look at her face, it seems so familiar, and to my mind, it would appear as if we had been old acquaintances; just as if, in fact, we were now meeting after a long separation.” “That will do! that will do!” remarked dowager lady Chia; “such being the case, you will be the more intimate.”","‘Fancy changing your clothes before you have welcomed the visitor!’ Grandmother Jia chided indulgently on seeing Bao-yu back again. ‘Aren’t you going to pay your respects to your cousin ?’ Bao-yu had already caught sight of a slender, delicate girl whom he surmised to be his Aunt Lin’s daughter and quickly went over to greet her. Then, returning to his place and taking a seat, he studied her attentively. How different she seemed from the other girls he knew! Her mist-wreathed brows at first seemed to frown, yet were not frowning; Her passionate eyes at first seemed to smile, yet were not merry. Habit had given a melancholy cast to her tender face; Nature had bestowed a sickly constitution on her delicate frame. Often the eyes swam with glistening tears; Often the breath came in gentle gasps. In stillness she made one think of a graceful flower reflected in the water; In motion she called to mind tender willow shoots caressed by the wind. She had more chambers in her heart than the martyred Bi Gan; And suffered a tithe more pain in it than the beautiful Xi Shi. Having completed his survey, Bao-yu gave a laugh. ‘I have seen this cousin before.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘How could you possibly have done?’ ‘Well, perhaps not,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but her face seems so familiar that I have the impression of meeting her again after a long separation.’ ‘All the better,’ said Grandmother Jia. ‘That means that you should get on well together.’"

In the garden, the curtains were, by this time, flapping like dragons, the portieres flying about like phoenixes with variegated plumage. Gold and silver glistened with splendour. Pearls and precious gems shed out their brilliant lustre. The tripod censers burnt the Pai-ho incense. In the vases were placed evergreens. Silence and stillness prevailed, and not a man ventured so much as to cough. Chia She and the other men were standing outside the door giving on to the street on the west; and old lady Chia and the other ladies were outside the main entrance of the Jung mansion at the head of the street, while at the mouth of the lane were placed screens to rigorously obstruct the public gaze.","By five o’clock next morning, when it was still dark night outside, all those in the family from Grandmother Jia downwards who held any sort of rank or title were already dressed in full court rig.

Jia She and the other menfolk drew themselves up outside the west gate. Grandmother Jia stood outside the main gate with the female members of the family. They noticed that the ends of the street and the entrances of the side-streets leading into it had all been screened off."

Entries had, at the time to be made in the books, and orders to be issued, and Ch’in Chung was induced to interpose with a smirk, “In both these mansions of yours, such orders are alike in use; but were any outsider stealthily to counterfeit one and to abscond, after getting the money, what could ever be done?” “In what you say,” replied lady Feng, “you take no account of the laws of the land.” “How is it that from our house, no one comes to get any orders or to obtain anything?” Pao-yue having inquired: “At the time they come to fetch them,” rejoined lady Feng, “you’re still dreaming; but let me ask you one thing, when will you two at last begin your evening course of studies?” “Oh, I wish we were able to begin our studies this very day,” Pao-yue added; “that would be the best thing, but they’re very slow in putting the school-room in order, so that there’s no help for it!” Lady Feng laughed. “Had you asked me,” she remarked, “I can assure you it would have been ready quick enough.” “You too would have been of no use,” observed Pao-yue, “for it will certainly be ready by the time they ought to finish it in.” “But in order that they should do the work,” suggested lady Feng, “it’s also necessary that they should have the material, they can’t do without them; and if I don’t give them any permits, it will be difficult to obtain them.” Pao-yue at these words readily drew near to lady Feng, and there and then applied for the permits. “My dear sister,” he added, “do give them the permits to enable them to obtain the material and effect the repairs.” “I feel quite sore from fatigue,” ventured lady Feng, “and how can I stand your rubbing against me? but compose your mind. They have this very day got the paper, and gone to paste it; and would they, for whatever they need, have still waited until they had been sent for? they are not such fools after all!” Pao-yue would not believe it, and lady Feng at once called Ts’ai Ming to look up the list, which she handed for Pao-yue’s inspection; but while they were arguing a servant came in to announce that Chao Erh, who had gone to Su Chow, had returned, and lady Feng all in a flurry directed that he should be asked to walk in. Chao Erh bent one knee and paid his obeisance.","For a short while longer the handing over of tallies and registering of amounts continued. ‘Both your houses use these tallies for everything,’ said Qin Zhong, who had been watching these transactions with some interest. ‘ Suppose some outsider were to forge one and use it to get a lot of money with?’ ‘Not everyone is as crooked as you are!’ said Xi-feng good-humouredly. ‘How is it that there is no one from our place coming in for tallies?’ Bao-yu asked. ‘At the time when they come,’ Xi-feng replied, ‘you are still fast asleep in bed. Now let me ask you something. When are you going to begin studying at night ?’ ‘I should like nothing better than to begin today,’ said Bao-yu. ‘But what can I do if they won’t get on with my study?’ ‘If you were to ask me nicely,’ said Xi-feng jovially, ‘I think I could undertake to hurry them up for you.’ ‘Oh, you’re no good,’ said Bao-yu, ‘no more than any of the rest. They’ll get round to it in time. It’s just a question of waiting till they do.’ ‘Whether they get round to it or not,’ said Xi-feng, ‘they still need materials for the job, and they can’t get the materials if I don’t choose to give them the tallies – I can tell you that for sure!’ As soon as he heard this, Bao-yu twined himself round Xi-feng and began coaxing and wheedling her to give the workmen the tallies that would enable them to begin work on his study. ‘Stop it! Stop it!’ cried Xi-feng. ‘I am so tired that my bones ache. How can I stand up to being mauled about by a great-ape like you? You needn’t worry. They’ve just been round to see about paper for the windows. It would look pretty stupid if you were to send them off for something they have already got.’ Bao-yu refused to believe her until she made Sunshine look up the entry in his book and show it to him."
陋室空堂，當年笏滿床；衰草枯楊，曾為歌舞場。蛛絲兒結滿雕梁，綠紗今又糊在蓬窗上。說什麼脂正濃、粉正香，如何兩鬢又成霜？昨日黃土隴頭埋白骨，今宵紅綃帳底臥鴛鴦。金滿箱，銀滿箱，展眼乞丐人皆謗。正嘆他人命不長，那知自己歸來喪！訓有方，保不定日後作強梁。擇膏粱，誰承望流落在煙花巷！因嫌紗帽小，致使鎖枷扛；昨憐破襖寒，今嫌紫蟒長：亂烘烘你方唱罷我登場，反認他鄉是故鄉。甚荒唐，到頭來都是為他人作嫁衣裳！,"The shabby house was empty, when the wat was full of beds; The spider silk is full of carved beams, and the green gauze is now pasted on the awning window. Saying that the fat is thick and the powder is fragrant, how can the temples become frost again? Yesterday the loess long head buried the bones, tonight the mandarin ducks lie under the red silk tent. The chest is full of gold, the chest is full of silver, and all beggars are slandered. I am sighing that other people's lives are not long, then I know that I will die when I return! Well-trained, guarantees that you will be a strong beam in the future. Choose Gao Liang, who will live in Fireworks Lane! Because I thought the gauze hat was too small, I had to carry the shackles. Yesterday I had a broken jacket and cold, but now I think the purple python is long: You will sing and I will appear on the stage, and I will recognize that my hometown is my hometown. It's absurd, in the end it's all about making wedding clothes for others!","Sordid rooms and vacant courts, Replete in years gone by with beds where statesmen lay; Parched grass and withered banian trees, Where once were halls for song and dance! Spiders’ webs the carved pillars intertwine, The green gauze now is also pasted on the straw windows! What about the cosmetic fresh concocted or the powder just scented; Why has the hair too on each temple become white like hoarfrost! Yesterday the tumulus of yellow earth buried the bleached bones, To-night under the red silk curtain reclines the couple! Gold fills the coffers, silver fills the boxes, But in a twinkle, the beggars will all abuse you! While you deplore that the life of others is not long, You forget that you yourself are approaching death! You educate your sons with all propriety, But they may some day, ‘tis hard to say become thieves; Though you choose (your fare and home) the fatted beam, You may, who can say, fall into some place of easy virtue! Through your dislike of the gauze hat as mean, You have come to be locked in a cangue; Yesterday, poor fellow, you felt cold in a tattered coat, To-day, you despise the purple embroidered dress as long! Confusion reigns far and wide! you have just sung your part, I come on the boards, Instead of yours, you recognise another as your native land; What utter perversion! In one word, it comes to this we make wedding clothes for others! (We sow for others to reap.)","‘Mean hovels and abandoned halls Where courtiers once paid daily calls: Bleak haunts where weeds and willows scarcely thrive Were once with mirth and revelry alive. Whilst cobwebs shroud the mansion’s gilded beams, The cottage casement with choice muslin gleams. Would you of perfumed elegance recite ? Even as you speak, the raven locks turn white. Who yesterday her lord’s bones laid in clay, On silken bridal-bed shall lie today. Coffers with gold and silver filled: Now, in a trice, a tramp by all reviled. One at some other’s short life gives a sigh, Not knowing that he, too, goes home – to die! The sheltered and well-educated lad, In spite of all your care, may turn out bad; And the delicate, fastidious maid End in a foul stews, plying a shameful trade. The judge whose hat is too small for his head Wears, in the end, a convict’s cangue instead. Who shivering once in rags bemoaned his fate, Today finds fault with scarlet robes of state. In such commotion does the world’s theatre rage: As each one leaves, another takes the stage. In vain we roam: Each in the end must call a strange land home. Each of us with that poor girl may compare Who sews a wedding-gown for another bride to wear.’"
一日大姐毒盡癍回，十二日後送了娘娘，合家祭天祀祖，還願焚香，慶賀放賞已畢。賈璉仍復搬進臥室，見了鳳姐，正是俗語云「新婚不如遠別」，更有無限恩愛，自不必煩絮。,"One day, the eldest sister returned with all the poison, and 12 days later, she sent her mother to worship the ancestors with the family, and also offered to burn incense, and the celebration was over. Jia Lian still moved into the bedroom, and when she met Sister Feng, it was just as the saying goes, ""newly married is worse than farewell.""","But by a certain day the virus in Ta Chieh’s system had become exhausted, and the spots subsided, and at the expiry of twelve days the goddess was removed, and the whole household offered sacrifices to heaven, worshipped the ancestors, paid their vows, burnt incense, exchanged congratulations, and distributed presents. And these formalities observed, Chia Lien once more moved back into his own bedroom and was reunited with lady Feng. The proverb is indeed true which says: “That a new marriage is not equal to a long separation,” for there ensued between them demonstrations of loving affection still more numerous than heretofore, to which we need not, of course, refer with any minuteness.","A day arrived when the smallpox poison had spent itself and Baby’s pustules showed signs of drying up. After the twelfth day the Smallpox Goddess was ceremoniously ushered off the premises, the entire family joined in a service of thanksgiving to Heaven and the ancestors, and there was much burning of incense in discharge of vows made on the child’s behalf by various of its members, and much exchanging of congratulations and paying out of rewards. When all this was over, Jia Lian returned once more to the matrimonial couch. ‘A night after absence is better than a wedding night’ as the proverb crudely puts it, and certainly the affection shown that night by Jia Lian for his lady was of more than usual intensity."
寶玉看了，心下自思道：「原來如此。但不知何為『古今之情』，何為『風月之債』？從今倒要領略領略。」寶玉只顧如此一想，不料早把些邪魔招入膏肓了。當下隨了僊姑進入二層門內，至兩邊配殿，皆有匾額對聯，一時看不盡許多，惟見有幾處寫的是：「癡情司」、「結怨司」、「朝啼司」、「夜怨司」、「春感司」、「秋悲司」。看了，因向僊姑道：「敢煩僊姑引我到那各司中遊玩遊玩，不知可使得？」僊姑道：「此各司中皆貯的是普天之下所有的女子過去未來的簿冊，爾凡眼塵軀，未便先知的。」寶玉聽了，那裏肯依，復央之再四。僊姑無奈，說：「也罷，就在此司內略隨喜隨喜罷了。」寶玉喜不自勝，抬頭看這司的匾上，乃是「薄命司」三字，兩邊對聯寫的是：「春恨秋悲皆自惹，花容月貌為誰妍。」,"Baoyu looked at it and thought to himself, ""I see. But I don't know what is 'the love of the past and the present', and what is the 'debt of the wind and the moon'? From now on, I have to appreciate it."" The demon has been recruited to the verge of death. Immediately, I followed Xian Gu into the second-floor door, and to the side halls on both sides, there are couplets on plaques. I couldn't see much at the time, but I saw a few places written: ""Infatuation Division"", ""Grievance Division"", ""Chao Ti Division"" , ""Night Resentment Division"", ""Spring Feeling Division"", ""Autumn Sad Division"". After seeing it, Yin Xiang said: ""Dare to bother Xian Gu to lead me to play in the various divisions, but I don't know if I can make it?"" Xian Gu said, ""All the divisions store the past and future of all the women in the world. This book, Erfan's eyes are dusty, and it is not a prophet."" Baoyu listened, and there was willing to obey, and then again and again. Xian Gu was helpless and said, ""It's okay, just follow the joys in this department."" Baoyu was overjoyed and looked up at the plaque of the department. Spring hatred and autumn sorrow are all self-inflicted, and who is the beauty of the flower and the moon?""","Pao-yue, after perusal, communed with his own heart. “Is it really so!” he thought, “but I wonder what implies the passion from old till now, and what are the voluptuous debts! Henceforward, I must enlighten myself !” Pao-yue was bent upon this train of thoughts when he unwittingly attracted several evil spirits into his heart, and with speedy step he followed in the track of the fairy, and entered two rows of doors when he perceived that the Lateral Halls were, on both sides, full of tablets and scrolls, the number of which he could not in one moment ascertain. He however discriminated in numerous places the inscriptions: The Board of Lustful Love; the Board of contracted grudges; The Board of Matutinal sobs; the Board of nocturnal tears; the Board of vernal affections; and the Board of autumnal anguish. After he had perused these inscriptions, he felt impelled to turn round and address the Fairy. “May I venture to trouble my Fairy,” he said, “to take me along for a turn into the interior of each of these Boards? May I be allowed, I wonder, to do so?” “Inside each of these Boards,” explained the Fairy, “are accumulated the registers with the records of all women of the whole world; of those who have passed away, as well as of those who have not as yet come into it, and you, with your mortal eyes and human body, could not possibly be allowed to know anything in anticipation.” But would Pao-yue, upon hearing these words, submit to this decree? He went on to implore her permission again and again, until the Fairy casting her eye upon the tablet of the board in front of her observed, “Well, all right! you may go into this board and reap some transient pleasure.” Pao-yue was indescribably joyous, and, as he raised his head, he perceived that the text on the tablet consisted of the three characters: the Board of Ill-fated lives; and that on each side was a scroll with the inscription: Upon one’s self are mainly brought regrets in spring and autumn gloom; A face, flowerlike may be and moonlike too; but beauty all for whom?","‘I see,’ said Bao-yu to himself. ‘I wonder what the meaning of “passion that outlasts all time” can be. And what are “love’s debts ” ? From now on I must make an effort to understand these things.’ He could not, of course, have known it, but merely by thinking this he had invited the attentions of the demon Lust, and at that very moment a little of the demon’s evil poison had entered Bao-yu’s body and lodged itself in the innermost recesses of his heart. Wholly unconscious of his mortal peril, Bao-yu continued to follow the fairy woman. They passed through a second gateway, and Bao-yu saw a range of palace buildings ahead of them on either hand. The entrance to each building had a board above it proclaiming its name, and there were couplets on either side of the doorways. Bao-yu did not have time to read all of the names, but he managed to make out a few, viz: DEPARTMENT OF FOND INFATUATION DEPARTMENT OF CRUEL REJECTION DEPARTMENT OF EARLY MORNING WEEPING DEPARTMENT OF LATE NIGHT SOBBING DEPARTMENT OF SPRING FEVER DEPARTMENT OF AUTUMN GRIEF ‘Madam Fairy,’ said Bao-yu, whose interest had been whetted by what he had managed to read, ‘couldn’t you take me inside these offices to have a look around ?’ ‘In these offices,’ said the fairy woman, ‘are kept registers in which are recorded the past, present and future of girls from all over the world. It is not permitted that your earthly eyes should look on things that are yet to come.’ Bao-yu was most unwilling to accept this answer, and begged and pleaded so persistently that at last Disenchantment gave in. ‘Very well. You may make a very brief inspection of this office here.’ Delighted beyond measure, Bao-yu raised his head and read the notice above the doorway: DEPARTMENT OF THE ILL-FATED FAIR The couplet inscribed vertically on either side of the doorway was as follows: Spring griefs and autumn sorrows were by yourselves provoked. Flower faces, moonlike beauty were to what end disclosed ?"
第二十四回,twenty-four,The drunken Chin Kang makes light of lucre and shows a preference for generosity.,Chapter 24
說著，只見有個丫鬟端了茶來與他。那賈蕓口裏和寶玉說著話，眼睛卻溜瞅那丫鬟：細挑身材，容長臉面，穿著銀紅襖兒，青緞背心，白綾細折裙。——不是別個，卻是襲人。那賈蕓自從寶玉病了幾天，他在裏頭混了兩日，他卻把那有名人口認記了一半。他也知道襲人在寶玉房中比別個不同，今見他端了茶來，寶玉又在旁邊坐著，便忙站起來笑道：「姐姐怎麼替我倒起茶來。我來到叔叔這裏，又不是客，讓我自己倒罷。」寶玉道：「你只管坐著罷。丫頭們跟前也是這樣。」賈蕓笑道：「雖如此說，叔叔房裏姐姐們，我怎麼敢放肆呢。」一面說，一面坐下喫茶。,"As he said that, he saw a maid brought tea to him. That Jia Yun was talking to Baoyu, but her eyes flicked to the maid: she had a slender figure, a long face, and was wearing a silver-red jacket, a green satin vest, and a white velvet folded skirt. - Not someone else, but an attack. That Jia Yun had been in there for two days since Baoyu had been sick for a few days, but he had half-remembered that famous person. He also knew that Xiren was different from others in Baoyu's room. Now that he brought tea and Baoyu was sitting next to him, he hurriedly stood up and smiled and said, ""Why did my sister pour tea for me? I came to my uncle's place, I'm not a guest, so let me go."" Baoyu said, ""Just sit. The girls are like this too."" Jia Yun smiled and said, ""Even so, the sisters in the uncle's room, how dare I be arrogant. ' said while sitting down for tea.","As he spoke, he discerned a couple of servant-maids come to help him to a cup of tea. But while conversing with Pao-yue, Chia Yuen was intent upon scrutinising the girl with slim figure, and oval face, and clad in a silvery-red jacket, a blue satin waistcoat and a white silk petticoat with narrow pleats. At the time of Pao-yue’s illness, Chia Yuen had spent a couple of days in the inner apartments, so that he remembered half of the inmates of note, and the moment he set eyes upon this servant-girl he knew that it was Hsi Jen; and that she was in Pao-yue’s rooms on a different standing to the rest. Now therefore that she brought the tea in herself and that Pao-yue was, besides, sitting by, he rose to his feet with alacrity and put on a smile. “Sister,” he said, “how is it that you are pouring tea for me? I came here to pay uncle a visit; what’s more I’m no stranger, so let me pour it with my own hands!” “Just you sit down and finish!” Pao-yue interposed; “will you also behave in this fashion with servant-girls?” “In spite of what you say;” remarked Chia Yuen smiling, “they are young ladies attached to your rooms, uncle, and how could I presume to be disorderly in my conduct?” So saying, he took a seat and drank his tea.","As they chatted, a maid came in with some tea. Jia Yun was talking to Bao-yu as she approached, but his eyes were on her. She was tall and rather thin with a long oval face, and she was wearing a rose-pink dress over a closely pleated white satin skirt and a black satin sleeveless jacket over the dress. In the course of his brief sojourn among them in the early days of Bao-yu’s illness, Jia Yun had got by heart the names of most of the principal females of Bao-yu’s establishment. He knew at a glance that the maid now serving him tea was Aroma. He was also aware that she was in some way more important than the other maids and that to be waited on by her in the seated presence of her master was an honour. Jumping hastily to his feet he addressed her with a modest smile: ‘You shouldn’t pour tea for me, Miss! I’m not like a visitor here. You should let me pour for myself!’ ‘Oh do sit down!’ said Bao-yu. ‘You don’t have to be like that in front of the maids?’ ‘I know,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But a body-servant! I don’t like to presume.’"
第二十二回,twenty-second,CHAPTER XXII.,Chapter 22
原來王夫人時常居坐宴息，亦不在這正室，只在這正室東邊的三間耳房內。於是老嬤嬤引黛玉進東房門來。臨窗大炕上鋪著猩紅洋罽，正面設著大紅金錢蟒靠背，石青金錢蟒引枕，秋香色金錢蟒大條褥。兩邊設一對梅花式洋漆小几。左邊几上文王鼎，匙箸香盒；右邊几上汝窯美人觚，觚內插著時鮮花卉，並茗碗痰盒等物。地下面西一溜四張椅上，都搭著銀紅撒花椅搭，底下四副腳踏。椅之兩邊，也有一對高几，几上茗碗瓶花俱備。其餘陳設，自不必細說。老嬤嬤們讓黛玉炕上坐，炕沿上卻有兩個錦褥對設，黛玉度其位次，便不上炕，只向東邊椅子上坐了。本房內的丫鬟忙捧上茶來。黛玉一面喫茶，一面打量這些丫鬟們，妝飾衣裙，舉止行動，果亦與別家不同。,"It turned out that Mrs. Wang often lived for banquets, and she was not in the main room, but only in the three ear rooms on the east side of the main room. So the old mama led Daiyu to the east door. On the big kang by the window is covered with scarlet ocean ridges, the front is equipped with a backrest of a big red money python, a stone blue money python throw pillow, and a large mattress with autumn fragrance color money python. There are a pair of small tables in plum-style lacquer on both sides. On the left are the Wang Ding and the incense box with spoons and chopsticks; on the right are the Ru kiln beauty goblets, with seasonal flowers inserted into the goblets, as well as tea bowls and phlegm boxes. There were four chairs on the west side of the ground, all with silver and red flower-scattering chairs, with four pairs of pedals under them. On both sides of the chair, there are also a pair of high tables, on which tea bowls and vases are prepared. The rest of the furnishings do not need to be elaborated. The old nuns asked Daiyu to sit on the kang, but there were two brocade mattresses on the edge of the kang facing each other. The maids in this room were busy bringing tea. While eating tea, Daiyu looked at these maids, she decorated her dresses, and her behavior was also different from other families.","The fact is that madame Wang was also not in the habit of sitting and resting, in this main apartment, but in three side-rooms on the east, so that the nurses at once led Tai-yue through the door of the eastern wing. On a stove-couch, near the window, was spread a foreign red carpet. On the side of honour, were laid deep red reclining-cushions, with dragons, with gold cash (for scales), and an oblong brown-coloured sitting-cushion with gold-cash-spotted dragons. On the two sides, stood one of a pair of small teapoys of foreign lacquer of peach-blossom pattern. On the teapoy on the left, were spread out Wen Wang tripods, spoons, chopsticks and scent-bottles. On the teapoy on the right, were vases from the Ju Kiln, painted with girls of great beauty, in which were placed seasonable flowers; (on it were) also teacups, a tea service and the like articles. On the floor on the west side of the room, were four chairs in a row, all of which were covered with antimacassars, embroidered with silverish-red flowers, while below, at the feet of these chairs, stood four footstools. On either side, was also one of a pair of high teapoys, and these teapoys were covered with teacups and flower vases. The other nick-nacks need not be minutely described. The old nurses pressed Tai-yue to sit down on the stove-couch; but, on perceiving near the edge of the couch two embroidered cushions, placed one opposite the other, she thought of the gradation of seats, and did not therefore place herself on the couch, but on a chair on the eastern side of the room; whereupon the waiting maids, in attendance in these quarters, hastened to serve the tea. While Tai-yue was sipping her tea, she observed the headgear, dress, deportment and manners of the several waiting maids, which she really found so unlike what she had seen in other households.","Lady Wang did not, however, normally spend her leisure hours in this main reception hall, but in a smaller room on the east side of the same building. Accordingly the nurses conducted Dai-yu through the door into this side apartment. Here there was a large kang underneath the window, covered with a scarlet Kashmir rug. In the middle of the kang was a dark-red bolster with a pattern of medallions in the form of tiny dragons, and a long russet-green seating strip in the same pattern. A low rose-shaped table of coloured lacquer-work stood at each side. On the left-hand one was a small, square, four-legged ding, together with a bronze ladle, metal chopsticks, and an incense container. On the right-hand one was a narrow-waisted Ru-ware imitation gu with a spray of freshly cut flowers in it. In the part of the room below the kang there was a row of four big chairs against the east wall. All had footstools in front of them and chair-backs and seat-covers in old rose brocade sprigged with flowers. There were also narrow side-tables on which tea things and vases of flowers were arranged, besides other furnishings which it would be superfluous to enumerate. The old nurses invited Dai-yu to get up on the kang; but guessing that the brocade cushions arranged one on each side near the edge of it must be her uncle’s and aunt’s places, she deemed it more proper to sit on one of the chairs against the wall below. The maids in charge of the apartment served tea, and as she sipped it Dai-yu observed that their clothing, make-up, and deportment were quite different from those of the maids she had seen so far in other parts of the mansion."
賈蕓聽他韶刀的不堪，便起身告辭。卜世仁道：「怎麼急的這樣，喫了飯再去罷。」一句未完，只見他娘子說道：「你又糊塗了。說著沒有米，這裏買了半斤面來下給你喫，這會子還裝胖呢。留下外甥挨餓不成？」卜世仁說：「再買半斤來添上就是了。」他娘子便叫女孩兒：「銀姐，往對門王奶奶家去問，有錢借二三十個，明兒就送過來。」夫妻兩個說話，那賈蕓早說了幾個「不用費事」，去的無影無蹤了。,"Jia Yun heard his Shao Dao's unbearable, so he got up and said goodbye. Bu Shiren said: ""Why are you in such a hurry, let's go after dinner."" Before finishing the sentence, he saw his wife say: ""You are confused again. Saying that there is no rice, I bought half a catty of noodles here for you to eat. I’m still pretending to be fat. Can’t I leave my nephew to starve?” Bu Shiren said, “Buy another half a catty to add to it.” His wife called the girl, “Sister Yin, go to Grandma Wang’s house and ask if you have money to borrow. Twenty or thirty will be delivered tomorrow."" The husband and wife spoke, and Jia Yun had already said a few times, ""Don't bother,"" and disappeared without a trace.","Pu Shih-jen remarked. “Have your meal and then go!” But this remark was scarcely ended when they heard his wife say: “Are you again in the clouds? When I heard that there was no rice, I bought half a catty of dry rice paste, and brought it here for you to eat; and do you pray now still put on the airs of a well-to-do, and keep your nephew to feel the pangs of hunger?” “Well, then, buy half a catty more, and add to what there is, that ’s all ,” Pu Shih-jen continued; whereupon her mother explained to her daughter, Yin Chieh, “Go over to Mrs. Wang’s opposite, and ask her if she has any cash, to lend us twenty or thirty of them; and to-morrow, when they’re brought over, we’ll repay her.” But while the husband and wife were carrying on this conversation, Chia Yuen had, at an early period, repeated several times: “There’s no need to go to this trouble,” and off he went, leaving no trace or shadow behind.","Exasperated by his uncle’s nagging, Jia Yun got up to go. ‘What’s the hurry?’ said Bu Shi-ren. ‘You can have something to eat before you go -’ ‘Are you crazy?’ his wife’s voice cut in from the kitchen. ‘I told you we haven’t got any rice in the house. I’ve just bought this half a pound of noodles that I’m cooking for you now. I don’t know what you’re acting so lordly about, asking people to dinner. The boy’ll only go hungry if he stays!’ ‘Buy another half a pound, woman, and put it in with the rest!’ said Bu Shi-ren. ‘Goldie!’ Mrs Bu shouted to her daughter. ‘ Go over to Mrs Wang’s house across the road and ask if she can lend us a few cash. Tell her we can pay her back tomorrow!’ But before she had finished, Jia Yun, with a muttered ‘Don’t bother!’ had slipped quietly away."
鳳姐因見張材家的在旁，因問：「你有什麼事？」張材家的忙取帖兒回說：「就是方纔車轎圍作成，領取裁縫工銀若干兩。」鳳姐聽了，便收了帖子，命彩明登記。待王興家的交過牌，得了買辦的回押相符，然後方與張材家的去領。一面又命唸那一個，是為寶玉外書房完竣，支買紙料糊裱。鳳姐聽了，即命收帖兒登記，待張材家的繳清，又發與這人去了。,"When Sister Feng saw Zhang Cai's family, she asked, ""What's the matter with you?"" Zhang Cai's family hurriedly picked up the post and replied, ""It was just made for the sedan and I received a few taels of tailor ICBC."" Sister Feng listened, and said, He accepted the post and ordered Caiming to register. After Wang Xing's family checked in and got the comprador's return, he and Zhang Cai's family went to collect it. On the other hand, he ordered to read the other one, in order to complete Baoyu's outer study, buy paper materials to paste it. When Sister Feng heard it, she immediately ordered the post to be registered, and when Zhang Cai's family paid it off, she sent it to this person.","Lady Feng then caught sight of the wife of Chang Ts’ai standing by, and asked her what was her business, whereupon Chang Ts’ai’s wife promptly produced an indent. “The covers of the carriages and sedan chairs,” she reported, “have just been completed, and I’ve come to fetch the amount due to the tailors for wages.” Lady Feng, upon hearing her explanation, took over the indent, and directed Ts’ai Ming to enter the items in the book. After Wang Hsing had handed over the money, and obtained the receipt of the accountant, duly signed, which tallied with the payment, he subsequently walked away in company with Chang Ts’ai’s wife. Lady Feng simultaneously proceeded to give orders that another indent should be read, which was for money to purchase paper with to paste on the windows of Pao-yue’s outer school-room, the repairs to which had been brought to completion, and as soon as lady Feng heard the nature of the application, she there and then gave directions that the permit should be taken over and an entry made, and that the money should be issued after Chang Ts’ai’s wife had delivered everything clearly.","Xi-feng next observed Zhang Cai’s wife hovering about at the edge of the room and asked her what she wanted. ‘It’s those carriage curtains, ma’am. We want the money for the tailor who made them up.’ Xi-feng took the bill and told Sunshine to enter the figures from it in his book. But she would not authorize Zhang Cai’s wife to pay for the tailoring until Wang Xing’s wife had returned the tally for the material used and the buyer’s receipt. There was a second piece of paper which Sunshine now read, requesting permission to purchase paper for the windows of Bao-yu’s outer study, which had just been redecorated. This too Xi-feng kept, and made Sunshine enter the amount in his book. She told Zhang Cai’s wife that the goods must be supplied first before any payment could be authorized."
次日，寶玉見了賈母，雖然自己承認是自己燙的，不與別人相干，免不得那賈母又把跟從的人罵一頓。,"The next day, Baoyu met Jia's mother, although she admitted that she was hot and had nothing to do with others, so that Jia's mother scolded the followers again.","But in spite of his confession that he himself was responsible for the scalding of his face, his grandmother could not refrain from reading another lecture to the servants who had been in attendance.","Next day Bao-yu had to see Grandmother Jia. Although he told her that he had burned himself through his own carelessness, the old lady, as had been predicted, berated his attendants for having allowed the accident to happen. Another day went by, and Bao-yu’s godmother, old Mother Ma, called round. Mother Ma was a Wise Woman. Her special relationship with Bao-yu had been arranged in his infancy to ensure him the protection of her powers. She was shocked by her godson’s appearance and, on being informed of the cause, shook her head and tutted sympathetically. She made a few signs over his face with her fingers, muttering some gibberish as she did so, after which she assured them that he would soon be better: the malignant aura that had caused the accident was of a transitory, impermanent nature. She turned to Grandmother Jia:"
鳳姐兒心中雖十分難過，但恐怕病人見了眾人這個樣兒反添心酸，倒不是來開導勸解的意思了。見寶玉這個樣子，因說道：「寶兄弟，你忒婆婆媽媽的了。他病人不過是這麼說，那裏就到得這個田地了？況且能多大年紀的人，略病一病兒就這麼想那麼想的，這不是自己倒給自己添病了麼？」,"Although Sister Feng was very sad in her heart, she was afraid that the patient would feel sad when she saw everyone like this. Seeing Baoyu like this, Yin said, ""Brother Bao, you are a mother-in-law. His patient just said so, so he can get this field there? Besides, how old can a person be, when he is a little sick, he thinks like this. Oh, isn't this making yourself sick?""","Lady Feng perceiving him in tears felt it extremely painful within herself to bear the sight; but she was on pins and needles lest the patient should detect their frame of mind, and feel, instead (of benefit), still more sore at heart, which would not, after all, be quite the purpose of her visit; which was to afford her distraction and consolation. “Pao-yue,” she therefore exclaimed, “you are like an old woman! Ill, as she is, simply makes her speak in this wise, and how ever could things come to such a pass! Besides, she is young in years, so that after a short indisposition, her illness will get all right!” “Don’t,” she said as she turned towards Mrs. Ch’in, “give way to silly thoughts and idle ideas! for by so doing won’t you yourself be aggravating your ailment?”","Xi-feng, seeing him, was herself deeply affected; but fearing that the sight of his grief might make Qin-shi even more distressed, whereas the declared purpose of their visit had been to cheer her up, she rallied him lightly on his tears. ‘Don’t be such a baby, Bao-yu! It’s not really that serious : sick people always say things like that. Besides, she’s still young, and when you are young you can shake an illness off in no time at all. – You mustn’t let yourself think such stupid things,’ she said, turning to Qin-shi. ‘You’ll make yourself worse.’"
此事皆由葫蘆廟內之沙彌新門子所出，雨村又恐他對人說出當日貧賤時的事來，因此心中大不樂業，後來到底尋了個不是，遠遠的充發了他纔罷。,"This matter was all reported by the novice Xinmenzi in the Gourd Temple. Yucun was afraid that he would tell people what happened when he was poor and lowly, so he was very unhappy in his career. Just stop.","This case had been settled through the exclusive action of the young priest of the Hu Lu temple, now an official Retainer; and Yue-ts’un, apprehending, on the other hand, lest he might in the presence of others, divulge the circumstances connected with the days gone by, when he was in a state of penury, naturally felt very unhappy in his mind.","Fearful that the now usher and quondam novice of Bottle-gourd Temple might talk to others about the days when he was an obscure and impoverished student, Yu-cun for some time went about in great discomfort of mind. Finally, however, he managed to catch him out in some misdemeanour or other and have him drafted for military service on a frontier outpost, after which he felt able to breathe freely again. But now no more of Yu-cun."
水溶見他語言清楚，談吐有緻，一面又向賈政笑道：「令郎真乃龍駒鳳雛，非小王在世翁前唐突，將來『雛鳳清於老鳳聲』，未可量也。」賈政忙陪笑道：「犬子豈敢謬承金獎。賴藩郡余禎，果如是言，亦蔭生輩之幸矣。」水溶又道：「衹是一件，令郎如是資質，想老太夫人、夫人輩自然鍾愛極矣；但吾輩後生，甚不宜鍾溺，鍾溺則未免荒失學業。昔小王曾蹈此轍，想令郎亦未必不如是也。若令郎在家難以用功，不妨常到寒第。小王雖不才，卻多蒙海上眾名士凡至都者，未有不另垂青目，是以寒第高人頗聚。令郎常去談會談會，則學問可以日進矣。」賈政忙躬身答應。,"Seeing that his language is clear and his conversation is smooth, Shui Rong smiled at Jia Zheng again: ""Ling Lang is really a dragon, a horse and a phoenix. It's not a small king who is abrupt in front of a world-class man. In the future, 'the young and the phoenix will be clearer than the old phoenix', which is immeasurable."" Jia Zheng hurriedly smiled and said, ""How dare a dog go so far as to accept the gold award. Yu Zhen, Lai Fan County, if you say that, you will be lucky to be born."" Shuishun added: ""It's just one thing, if you have such a talent, you will miss the old lady. Ladies and wives are naturally fond of them; but it is not suitable for our younger generation to be obsessed with drowning, and obsessed with drowning will inevitably lose their studies. In the past, Xiao Wang had done this, and it may not be as good if you wanted to make your husband. Arriving at Handi. Although Xiao Wang is not talented, he has many famous people from the sea who have come to the capital, and none of them are not in the limelight. Therefore, there are quite a few high-ranking people in Handi. If you make Lang often go to talks and conferences, you can advance your knowledge day by day. ""Jia Zheng hurriedly bowed and agreed.","Shih Jung perceiving the perspicacity of his speech and the propriety of his utterances, simultaneously turned towards Chia Chen and observed with a smile on his face: “Your worthy son is, in very truth, like the young of a dragon or like the nestling of a phoenix! and this isn’t an idle compliment which I, a despicable prince, utter in your venerable presence! But how much more glorious will be, in the future, the voice of the young phoenix than that of the old phoenix, it isn’t easy to ascertain.” Chia Chen forced a smile: “My cur-like son,” he replied, “cannot presume to such bountiful praise and golden commendation; but if, by the virtue of your Highness’ excess of happiness, he does indeed realise your words, he will be a source of joy to us all!” “There’s one thing, however,” continued Shih Jung; “with the excellent abilities which your worthy scion possesses, he’s sure, I presume, to be extremely loved by her dowager ladyship, (his grandmother), and by all classes. But for young men of our age it’s a great drawback to be doated upon, for with over-fondness , we cannot help utterly frustrating the benefits of education. When I, a despicable prince, was young, I walked in this very track, and I presume that your honourable son cannot likewise but do the same. By remaining at home, your worthy scion will find it difficult to devote his attention to study; and he will not reap any harm, were he to come, at frequent intervals, to my humble home; for though my deserts be small, I nevertheless enjoy the great honour of the acquaintance of all the scholars of note in the Empire, so that, whenever any of them visit the capital, not one of them is there who does not lower his blue eyes upon me. Hence it is that in my mean abode, eminent worthies rendezvous; and were your esteemed son to come, as often as he can, and converse with them and meet them, his knowledge would, in that case, have every opportunity of making daily strides towards improvement.” Chia Chen speedily bent his body and expressed his acquiescence, by way of reply; whereupon Shih Jung went further, and taking off from his wrist a chaplet of pearls, he presented it to Pao-yue.","Delighted that everything Bao-yu said was so clear and to the point, the prince observed to Jia Zheng that ‘the young phoenix was worthy of his sire’. ‘I trust I shall not offend you by saying so to your face,’ he said, ‘but I venture to prophesy that this fledgling of yours will one day “sing sweeter than the parent bird”.’ Jia Zheng smiled politely. ‘My son is doubtless unworthy of the compliment Your Highness is good enough to pay him. If, thanks to your encouragement, he turns out as you say, we shall count ourselves truly fortunate.’ ‘There is only one drawback in possessing such charm,’ said the prince. ‘I am sure it must make his grandmother dote upon him; and, unfortunately, being the object of too much affection is very bad for people of our years. It leads us to neglect our studies. This used at one time to be the case with me, and I suspect is now the case with your son. If he does find difficulty in working at home, he would be very welcome to come round to my palace. I do not pretend to be a gifted person myself, but I am fortunate in counting distinguished writers from all over the empire among my acquaintances, and my palace is a rendezvous for them when they are in the capital, so that I never want for intellectual company. By constantly mixing and conversing with such people at my palace, your son could do much to improve his education.’ ‘Yes.’ Jia Zheng bowed deferentially."
說著，大家出來。行不多遠，則見崇閣巍峨，層樓高起，面面琳宮合抱，迢迢復道縈紆，青松拂檐，玉欄繞砌，金輝獸面，彩煥螭頭。賈政道：「這是正殿了，衹是太富麗了些。」眾人都道：「要如此方是。雖然貴妃崇節尚儉，天性惡繁悅樸，然今日之尊，禮儀如此，不為過也。」一面說，一面走，只見正面現出一座玉石牌坊來，上面龍蟠螭護，玲瓏鑿就。賈政道：「此處書以何文？」眾人道：「必是『蓬萊僊境』方妙。」賈政搖頭不語。寶玉見了這個所在，心中忽有所動，尋思起來，倒象那裏曾見過的一般，卻一時想不起那年月日的事了。賈政又命他作題，寶玉只顧細思前景，全無心於此了。眾人不知其意，只當他受了這半日的折磨，精神耗散，才盡詞窮了；再要考難逼迫，著了急，或生出事來，倒不便。遂忙都勸賈政：「罷，罷，明日再題罷了。」賈政心中也怕賈母不放心，遂冷笑道：「你這畜生，也竟有不能之時了。也罷，限你一日，明日若再不能，我定不饒。這是要緊一處，更要好生作來！」,"Say, everyone come out. Not too far away, you will see the towering Chong Pavilion, the high floors, the faces of the palaces, the long road, the green pines, the jade fences, the golden beast faces, and the colorful heads. Jia Zheng said: ""This is the main hall, but it's too rich."" Everyone said, ""That's how it should be. Although the imperial concubine advocates thrift and frugality, and her nature is evil and simple, but today's respect, etiquette is like this, not for Let's go."" As he said, he walked away, and saw a jade archway appearing in front of it, with dragon panchi guarding it, exquisitely chiseled. Jia Zheng said, ""What is the text of this book?"" The crowd said, ""It must be Fang Miao of Penglai Wonderland."" Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing. Seeing this place, Baoyu's heart suddenly moved, and when he thought about it, it was as if he had seen it before, but he couldn't remember the year, month and day for a while. Jia Zheng ordered him to write a question again, and Baoyu only thought about the future, and had no intention of doing it. Everyone didn't know what it meant, only when he was tortured for half a day and his spirit was dissipated, he was at a loss for words; it would be inconvenient if he was forced to take the exam again, if he was in a hurry, or something happened. Then he was busy trying to persuade Jia Zheng: ""No, no, I'll ask again tomorrow."" Jia Zheng was also worried that Jia's mother would not be at ease, so he sneered: ""You bastard, there are times when you can't. Today, if I can't do it tomorrow, I won't forgive it. This is the most important thing, and it's even more important to live it up!""","as they were on every side they were as beautiful as the Jade palace. Far and wide, road upon road coiled and wound; while the green pines swept the eaves, the jady epidendrum encompassed the steps, the animals’ faces glistened like gold, and the dragons’ heads shone resplendent in their variegated hues. “This is the Main Hall,” remarked Chia Cheng; “the only word against it is that there’s a little too much finery.” “It should be so,” rejoined one and all, “so as to be what it’s intended to be! The imperial consort has, it is true, an exalted preference for economy and frugality, but her present honourable position requires the observance of such courtesies, so that (finery) is no fault.” As they made these remarks and advanced on their way the while, they perceived, just in front of them, an archway project to view, constructed of jadelike stone; at the top of which the coils of large dragons and the scales of small dragons were executed in perforated style. “What’s the device to be for this spot?” inquired Chia Cheng. “It should be ‘fairy land,’“ suggested all of them, “so as to be apposite!” Chia Cheng nodded his head and said nothing. But as soon as Pao-yue caught sight of this spot something was suddenly aroused in his heart and he began to ponder within himself. “This place really resembles something that I’ve seen somewhere or other.” But he could not at the moment recall to mind what year, moon, or day this had happened. Chia Cheng bade him again propose a motto; but Pao-yue was bent upon thinking over the details of the scenery he had seen on a former occasion, and gave no thought whatever to this place, so that the whole company were at a loss what construction to give to his silence, and came simply to the conclusion that, after the bullying he had had to put up with for ever so long, his spirits had completely vanished, his talents become exhausted and his speech impoverished; and that if he were harassed and pressed, he might perchance, as the result of anxiety, contract some ailment or other, which would of course not be a suitable issue, and they lost no time in combining together to dissuade Chia Cheng. “Never mind,” they said, “to-morrow will do to compose some device; let’s drop it now.” Chia Cheng himself was inwardly afraid lest dowager lady Chia should be anxious, so that he hastily remarked as he forced a smile. “You beast, there are, after all, also occasions on which you are no good! but never mind! I’ll give you one day to do it in, and if by to-morrow you haven’t been able to compose anything, I shall certainly not let you off. This is the first and foremost place and you must exercise due care in what you write.”","But they could see he was not displeased. Leaving the place of many fragrances behind them, they had not advanced much further when they could see ahead of them a building of great magnificence which Jia Zheng at once identified as the main reception hall of the Residence. Roof above roof soared, Eye up-compelling, Of richly-wrought chambers And high winding galleries. Green rafts of dark pine Brushed the eaves’ edges. Milky magnolias Bordered the buildings. Gold-glinting cat-faces, Rainbow-hued serpents’ snouts Peered out or snarled down From cornice and finial. ‘It is rather a showy building,’ said Jia Zheng. But the literary gentlemen reassured him: ‘Although Her Grace is a person of simple and abstemious tastes, the exalted position she now occupies makes it only right and proper that there should be a certain amount of pomp in her reception. This building is in no way excessive.’ Still advancing in the same direction, they presently found themselves at the foot of the white marble memorial arch which framed the approach to the hall. The pattern of writhing dragons protectively crouched over its uppermost horizontal was so pierced and fretted by the sculptor’s artistry as to resemble lacework rather than solid stone. ‘What inscription do we want on this arch?’ Jia Zheng inquired. ‘“Peng-lai’s Fairy Precincts” is the only name that would do it justice,’ said the literary gentlemen. Jia Zheng shook his head and said nothing. The sight of this building and its arch had inspired a strange and unaccountable stir of emotion in Bao-yu which on reflection he interpreted as a sign that he must have known a building somewhat like this before – though where or when he could not for the life of him remember. He was still racking his brains to recall what it reminded him of, when Jia Zheng ordered him to produce a name and couplet for the arch, and he was quite unable to give his mind to the task of composition. The literary gentlemen, not knowing the nature of his preoccupation, supposed that his father’s incessant bullying had worn him out and that he had finally come to the end of his inspiration. They feared that further bullying might once more bring out the mulish streak in him, thereby provoking an explosion which would be distasteful for everybody. Accordingly they urged Jia Zheng to allow him a day’s grace in which to produce something suitable. Jia Zheng, who was secretly beginning to be apprehensive about the possible con-quences of Grandmother Jia’s anxiety for her darling grandson, yielded, albeit with a bad grace: ‘Jackanapes! So even you have your off moments it seems. Well, I’ll give you a day to do it in. But woe betide you if you can’t produce something tomorrow! And it had better be something good, too, because this is the most important building in the garden.’"
寶釵看畢，又從新翻過正面細看，口中念著：「莫失莫忘，僊壽恒昌。」念了兩遍，乃回頭向鶯兒笑道：「你還不倒茶去，也在這裏發呆作什麼？」鶯兒嘻嘻笑道：「我聽這兩句話，倒象和姑娘的項圈上的兩句話是一對兒。」寶玉聽了，忙笑道：「原來姐姐那項圈上也有八個字，我也賞鑒賞鑒。」寶釵道：「你別信他的話，沒有什麼字。」寶玉笑央：「好姐姐，你怎麼瞧我的了呢。」寶釵被纏不過，因說道：「也是個人給了兩句吉利話兒，所以鏨上了，叫天天帶著；不然，沉甸甸的有什麼趣兒。」一面說，一面解了排扣，從裏面大紅襖上將那珠寶晶瑩黃金燦爛的瓔珞掏出來。寶玉忙托了鎖看時，果然，一面有四個篆字，兩面八字，共成兩句吉讖。亦曾按式畫下形相。（圖見下頁）,"After Baochai had finished reading it, he turned to the front to look carefully, and read, ""Don't lose, don't forget, Xian Shou Heng Chang."" After reading it twice, he turned to Ying'er and smiled, ""You still don't pour the tea, What are you doing here in a daze?"" Ying'er giggled, ""I heard these two sentences, but they seem to match the two sentences on the girl's collar."" There are also eight characters on my sister's collar, and I also appreciate it."" Baochai said, ""Don't believe him, there are no words."" Baoyu smiled and said, ""Good sister, why do you look at me."" Baoyu The hairpin couldn't be entangled, because he said: ""It was also a person who gave two auspicious words, so I chiseled it and told me to take it with me every day; otherwise, what's the fun of it being heavy."" The big red jacket took out the gleaming gold pendant. Baoyu hurriedly held the lock to look at it, and sure enough, there were four seal characters on one side and eight characters on both sides, forming two auspicious prophecies. He also drew the shape according to the formula. (See picture on next page)","Precious Gem of Spiritual Perception. If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me, Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee! On the reverse was written: 1 To exorcise evil spirits and the accessory visitations; 2 To cure predestined sickness; 3 To prognosticate weal and woe. Pao Ch’ai having looked at the amulet, twisted it again to the face, and scrutinising it closely, read aloud: If thou wilt lose me not and never forget me, Eternal life and constant luck will be with thee! She perused these lines twice, and, turning round, she asked Ying Erh laughingly: “Why don’t you go and pour the tea? what are you standing here like an idiot!” “These two lines which I’ve heard,” smiled Ying Erh, “would appear to pair with the two lines on your necklet, miss!” “What!” eagerly observed Pao-yue with a grin, when he caught these words, “are there really eight characters too on your necklet, cousin? do let me too see it.” “Don’t listen to what she says,” remarked Pao Ch’ai, “there are no characters on it.” “My dear cousin,” pleaded Pao-yue entreatingly, “how is it you’ve seen mine?” Pao Ch’ai was brought quite at bay by this remark of his, and she consequently added, “There are also two propitious phrases engraved on this charm, and that’s why I wear it every day. Otherwise, what pleasure would there be in carrying a clumsy thing.” As she spoke, she unfastened the button, and produced from inside her crimson robe, a crystal-like locket, set with pearls and gems, and with a brilliant golden fringe. Pao-yue promptly received it from her, and upon minute examination, found that there were in fact four characters on each side; the eight characters on both sides forming two sentences of good omen. The similitude of the locket is likewise then given below. On the face of the locket is written:","(On the reverse side) 1. Dispels the harms of witchcraft. 2. Cures melancholic distempers. 3. Foretells good and evil fortune. When Bao-chai had looked at the stone all over, she turned back to the inscription on the front and repeated it a couple of times to herself out loud: ‘Mislay me not, forget me not, And hale old age shall be your lot.’ ‘Why aren’t you pouring the tea?’ she asked Oriole. ‘What are you standing there gawping for?’ Oriole laughed. ‘Because those words sounded like a perfect match to the ones on your necklace.’ ‘So you have an inscription, too ?’ said Bao-yu pricking up his ears. ‘I must have a look.’ ‘Don’t take any notice of her!’ said Bao-chai. ‘There is no inscription.’ ‘Cousin, cousin,’ said Bao-yu entreatingly, ‘you’ve had a look at mine. Be fair!’ Bao-chai could not escape the logic of this entreaty. ‘There is a motto on it which someone gave us once for luck and which we had engraved on it,’ she admitted. ‘ That’s the only reason I always wear it; otherwise it would be too tiresome to have a heavy thing like this hanging round one’s neck all the time.’ As she was speaking she undid the top buttons of her jacket and gown and extracted the necklace that she was wearing over the dark red shift beneath. Its pendant was a locket of shining solid gold, bordered with sparkling gems. There was a line of writing engraved on either side of it which together made up the words of a charm: Ne’er leave me, ne’er abandon me: And years of health shall be your fee."
此時賈瑞前心猶是未改，再想不到是鳳姐捉弄他。過後兩日，得了空，便仍來找鳳姐。鳳姐故意抱怨他失信，賈瑞急的賭咒發誓。鳳姐因見他自投羅網，少不得再尋別計令他知改，故又約他道：「今日晚上，你別在那裏了。你在我這房後小過道子裏那間空屋裏等我，可別冒撞了。」賈瑞道：「果真？」鳳姐道：「誰可哄你，你不信就別來。」賈瑞道：「來，來，來。就死也要來！」鳳姐道：「這會子你先去罷。」賈瑞料定晚間必妥，此時先去了。鳳姐在這裏便點兵派將，設下圈套。,"At this time, Jia Rui's heart still remained unchanged, and he never imagined that it was Sister Feng who was playing tricks on him. Two days later, when I was free, I still came to see Sister Feng. Sister Feng deliberately complained that he had broken his trust, and Jia Rui hurriedly swore an oath. Seeing that he had thrown himself into a trap, Sister Feng had to find another way to make him change, so she asked him again: ""Tonight, don't stay there. You wait in the empty room in the small passage behind my room. Me, don't be rash."" Jia Rui said, ""Really?"" Sister Feng said, ""Who can coax you, don't come if you don't believe me."" Jia Rui said, ""Come, come, come. Even if you die, come!"" Sister Feng said: ""You go first this time."" Jia Rui expected to be ready at night, so he went first. Sister Feng ordered troops and sent generals here to set a trap.","Chia Jui’s infamous intentions had at this junction undergone no change; but far from his thoughts being even then any idea that lady Feng was humbugging him, he seized, after the lapse of a couple of days, the first leisure moments to come again in search of that lady. Lady Feng pretended to bear him a grudge for his breach of faith, and Chia Jui was so distressed that he tried by vows and oaths (to establish his innocence.) Lady Feng perceiving that he had, of his own accord, fallen into the meshes of the net laid for him, could not but devise another plot to give him a lesson and make him know what was right and mend his ways. With this purpose, she gave him another assignation. “Don’t go over there,” she said, “to-night, but wait for me in the empty rooms giving on to a small passage at the back of these apartments of mine. But whatever you do, mind don’t be reckless.” “Are you in real earnest?” Chia Jui inquired. “Why, who wants to play with you?” replied lady Feng; “if you don’t believe what I say, well then don’t come!” “I’ll come, I’ll come, yea I’ll come, were I even to die!” protested Chia Jui. “You should first at this very moment get away!” lady Feng having suggested, Chia Jui, who felt sanguine that when evening came, success would for a certainty crown his visit, took at once his departure in anticipation (of his pleasure.) During this interval lady Feng hastily set to work to dispose of her resources, and to add to her stratagems, and she laid a trap for her victim; while Chia Jui, on the other hand, was until the shades of darkness fell, a prey to incessant expectation.","It never entered his mind that he had been made a fool of. And so two days later, as soon as he had some free time, he was back once more looking for Xi-feng. She deliberately reproached him for having failed her, thereby so exasperating him that he swore by the most terrible oarhs that he had been faithful. Seeing him hurl himself so willingly into the net, Xi-feng decided that a further lesson would be needed to cure him of his folly and proposed another assignation. ‘Only tonight,’ she said, ‘don’t wait for me in that place again. Wait in the empty room in the little passage-way behind this apartment. But mind you don’t run into anybody.’ ‘Do you really mean this?’ said Jia Rui. ‘If you don’t believe me, don’t come !’ ‘I’ll come! I’ll come!’ said Jia Rui. ‘Whatever happens, I shall be there.’ ‘Now I think you had better go.’ Confident of seeing her again in the evening, Jia Rui went off uncomplainingly, leaving Xi-feng time to muster her forces, brief her officers, and prepare the trap in which the luckless man was to be caught."
寶玉點頭嘆道：「這又不知是那裏的帳，只揀軟的排揎。昨兒又不知是那個姑娘得罪了，上在他帳上。」一句未了，晴雯在旁笑道：「誰又不瘋了，得罪他作什麼。便得罪了他，就有本事承任，不犯帶累別人！」襲人一面哭，一面拉寶玉道：「為我得罪了一個老奶奶，你這會子又為我得罪這些人，這還不夠我受的，還衹是拉別人。」寶玉見他這般病勢，又添了這些煩惱，連忙忍氣吞聲，安慰他仍舊睡下出汗。又見他湯燒火熱，自己守著他，歪在旁邊，勸他只養著病，別想著些沒要緊的事生氣。襲人冷笑道：「要為這些事生氣，這屋裏一刻還站不得了。但衹是天長日久，只管這樣，可叫人怎麼樣纔好呢。時常我勸你，別為我們得罪人，你只顧一時為我們那樣，他們都記在心裏，遇著坎兒，說的好說不好聽，大家什麼意思。」一面說，一面禁不住流淚，又怕寶玉煩惱，只得又勉強忍著。,"Baoyu nodded and sighed, ""I don't know where this is the account, so I just pick the soft ones. Yesterday, I didn't know that the girl offended him and put it on his account."" Before the sentence was finished, Qingwen smiled beside him: "" Anyone who is not crazy, offends him for what he does. If he offends him, he has the ability to take responsibility, and he will not burden others!"" Xiren cried, while pulling Baoyu and saying: ""I offended an old grandmother for me, and now you are doing it again. I offend these people, and it's not enough for me, it's just pulling others."" Seeing that he was so sick, Baoyu added these troubles, and quickly swallowed his breath, comforting him that he was still sleeping and sweating. Seeing that his soup was burning hot again, he guarded him and leaned beside him, persuading him to only take care of his illness and not get angry about unimportant things. Xiren sneered and said: ""If you want to be angry about these things, you can't stand in this room for a moment. But it only lasts for a long time, no matter what, what can you do to people. I often advise you, don't offend people for us, you Just thinking about doing what we did for a while, they all keep it in their hearts, and when they encounter a hurdle, what they say is good or bad, what do you mean?"" As he spoke, he couldn't help crying, and he was afraid that Baoyu would be troubled, so he had to endure it reluctantly.","while Pao-yue nodded his head to and fro and soliloquised with a sigh: “One can neither know whence originates this score; for she will choose the weak one to maltreat; nor can one see what girl has given her offence that she has come to be put in her black books!” Scarcely had he ended this remark, before Ch’ing Wen, who stood by, put in her word. “Who’s gone mad again?” she interposed, “and what good would come by hurting her feelings? But did even any one happen to hurt her, she would have pluck enough to bear the brunt, and wouldn’t act so improperly as to involve others!” Hsi Jen wept, and as she, did so, she drew Pao-yue towards her: “All through my having aggrieved an old nurse,” she urged, “you’ve now again given umbrage, entirely on my account, to this crowd of people; and isn’t this still enough for me to bear but must you also go and drag in third parties?” When Pao-yue realised that to this sickness of hers, had also been superadded all these annoyances, he promptly stifled his resentment, suppressed his voice and consoled her so far as to induce her to lie down again to perspire. And when he further noticed how scalding like soup and burning like fire she was, he himself watched by her, and reclining by her side, he tried to cheer her, saying: “All you must do is to take good care of your ailment; and don’t give your mind to those trifling matters, and get angry.” “Were I,” Hsi Jen smiled sardonically, “to lose my temper over such concerns, would I be able to stand one moment longer in this room? The only thing is that if she goes on, day after day, doing nothing else than clamour in this manner, how can she let people get along? But you rashly go and hurt people’s feelings for our sakes; but they’ll bear it in mind, and when they find an opportunity, they’ll come out with what’s easy enough to say, but what’s not pleasant to hear, and how will we all feel then?” While her mouth gave utterance to these words, she could not stop her tears from running; but fearful, on the other hand, lest Pao-yue should be annoyed, she felt compelled to again strain every nerve to repress them.","But Bao-yu shook his head and sighed: ‘I wonder what had really upset her. Obviously she only picked on Aroma because she is weak and can’t defend herself. I wonder which of the girls had offended her to make her so…’ He was interrupted by Skybright: ‘Why should any of us want to upset her? Do you think we’re mad ? And even if we had offended her, we should be perfectly capable of owning up to it and not letting someone else take the blame!’ Aroma grasped Bao-yu’s hand and wept: ‘Because I offended one old nurse, you have to go offending a whole roomful of people. Don’t you think there’s been enough trouble already without dragging other people into it?’ Seeing how ill she looked and realizing that distress of mind could only aggravate her condition, Bao-yu stifled his indignation and did his best to comfort her so that she might be able to settle down once more and continue sweating out the fever. Her skin was burning to the touch. He decided to stay with her for a while, and lying down beside her, spoke to her soothingly: ‘Just try to get better, now! Never mind all that other nonsense! It’s of no importance.’ Aroma smiled bitterly. ‘If I had allowed myself to get upset about things like that, I shouldn’t have lasted in this room for five minutes! Still, if we’re always going to have this sort of trouble, I think in the long run I just shan’t be able to stand any more. You don’t seem to realize. You offend people on my account and the next moment you’ve forgotten all about it. But they haven’t. It’s all scored up against me; and as soon as something goes a bit wrong, they come out with all these horrible things about me. It makes it so unpleasant for all of us.’ She cried weakly as she said this, but presently checked herself for fear of upsetting Bao-yu."
原來上月賈蕓進來種樹之時，便揀了一塊羅帕，便知是所在園內的人失落的，但不知是那一個人的，故不敢造次。今聽見紅玉問墜兒，便知是紅玉的，心內不勝喜幸。又見墜兒追索，心中早得了主意，便向袖內將自己的一塊取了出來，向墜兒笑道：「我給是給你，你若得了他的謝禮，不許瞞著我。」墜兒滿口裏答應了，接了手帕子，送出賈蕓，回來找紅玉，不在話下。,"It turned out that when Jia Yun came in to plant a tree last month, he picked up a piece of Ropa, and knew that the person in the garden had lost it, but he didn’t know who it belonged to, so he didn’t dare to make a mistake. Today, when I hear Hongyu asking about the pendant, I know that it belongs to Hongyu, and I am overjoyed. Seeing Chuan's pursuit again, he already had an idea in his heart, so he took out a piece of his own from the sleeve, and said to Chuan'er with a smile, ""I gave it to you, if you get his thank you, don't hide it from me. ""Zui'er agreed, took the handkerchief, sent Jia Yun, and came back to find Hongyu, no problem.","The truth is that Chia Yuen had, the previous moon when he had come into the garden to attend to the planting of trees, picked up a handkerchief, which he conjectured must have been dropped by some inmate of those grounds; but as he was not aware whose it was, he did not consequently presume to act with indiscretion. But on this occasion, he overheard Hsiao Hung make inquiries of Chui Erh on the subject; and concluding that it must belong to her, he felt immeasurably delighted. Seeing, besides, how importunate Chui Erh was, he at once devised a plan within himself, and vehemently producing from his sleeve a handkerchief of his own, he observed, as he turned towards Chui Erh with a smile: “As for giving it to you, I’ll do so; but in the event of your obtaining any present from her, you mustn’t impose upon me.” Chui Erh assented to his proposal most profusely; and, taking the handkerchief, she saw Chia Yuen out and then came back in search of Hsiao Hung. But we will leave her there for the present. We will now return to Pao-yue.","Jia Yun had picked up a silk handkerchief a month previously at the time when his tree-planting activities had just started. He knew that it must have been dropped by one or another of the female inmates of the Garden, but not knowing which, had not so far ventured to do anything about his discovery. When earlier on he had heard Crimson question Trinket about her loss, he had realized, with a thrill of pleasure, that the handkerchief he had picked up must have been hers. Trinket’s request now gave him just the opening he required. He drew a handkerchief of his own from inside his sleeve and held it up in front of her with a smile: ‘‘I’ll give it to you on one condition. If she lets you have this reward you were speaking of, you’ve got to let me know. No cheating, mind!’ Trinket received the handkerchief with eager assurances that he would be informed of the outcome, and having seen him out of the Garden, went back again to look for Crimson."
這日伴宿之夕，裏面兩班小戲並耍百戲的與親朋堂客伴宿。尤氏猶臥於內室，一應張羅款待，獨是鳳姐一人周全承應。合族中雖有許多妯娌，但或有羞口的，或有羞腳的，或有不慣見人的，或有懼貴怯官的，種種之類，俱不及鳳姐舉止舒徐，言語慷慨，珍貴寬大；因此也不把眾人放在眼裏，揮霍指示，任其所為，目若無人。,"On the eve of this day, there are two groups of small operas who play a hundred operas with relatives and friends. You Shi was still lying in the inner room, as soon as she received a lot of hospitality, Sister Feng was the only one who fully accepted it. Although there are many concubines in the family, some are shy, some are shy, some are not used to meeting people, some are afraid of nobles and officials, and so on. Generous, precious and magnanimous; therefore, they do not put everyone in the spotlight, squander instructions, and let them do what they do, as if no one else.","On the night of this day, the body had to be watched, and in the inner suite of apartments two companies of young players as well as jugglers entertained the relatives, friends and other visitors during the whole of the night. Mrs. Yu was still laid up in the inside room, so that the whole task of attending to and entertaining the company devolved upon lady Feng alone, who had to look after everything; for though there were, in the whole clan, many sisters-in-law, some there were too bashful to speak, others too timid to stand on their feet; while there were also those who were not accustomed to meeting company; and those likewise who were afraid of people of high estate and shy of officials. Of every kind there were, but the whole number of them could not come up to lady Feng’s standard, whose deportment was correct and whose speech was according to rule. Hence it was that she did not even so much as heed any of that large company, but gave directions and issued orders, adopting any course of action which she fancied, just as if there were no bystander.","Wake night arrived – the night when no one in the family may go to bed – and Ning-guo House was crowded with friends and relations. Since You-shi was still confined to her room, it was left entirely to Xi-feng to do the honours. There were, to be sure, a number of other young married women in the clan, but all were either tongue-tied or giddy, or they were so petrified by bashfulness or timidity that the presence of strangers or persons of higher rank threw them into a state of panic. Xi-feng’s vivacious charm and social assurance stood out in striking contrast – ‘a touch of scarlet in a field of green’. She was in her element, and if she took any notice at all of her humbler sisters it was only to throw out an occasional order or to bend them in some other way to her imperious will."
寶玉忙笑道：「你說，那幾件？我都依你。好姐姐，好親姐姐，別說兩三件，就是兩三百件，我也依。只求你們同看著我，守著我，等我有一日化成了飛灰，——飛灰還不好，灰還有形有跡，還有知識。——等我化成一股輕煙，風一吹便散了的時候，你們也管不得我，我也顧不得你們了。那時憑我去，我也憑你們愛那裏去就去了。」急的襲人忙握他的嘴，說：「好好的，正為勸你這些，倒更說的狠了。」寶玉忙說道：「再不說這話了。」襲人道：「這是頭一件要改的。」寶玉道：「改了，再要說，你就擰嘴。還有什麼？」,"Baoyu hurriedly smiled and said, ""What do you say? I will depend on you. Good sister, good sister, don't say two or three, even two or three hundred, I will also follow. I just ask you to watch me together and keep an eye on me. Follow me, until one day I will turn into fly ash, - fly ash is not good, ash still has traces, and knowledge. - When I turn into a light smoke, and the wind blows it will disperse, you guys I can't take care of me, and I can't take care of you anymore. At that time, I will go there, and I will go there on the basis of your love."" Anxious Xiren squeezed his mouth and said, ""Okay, just to persuade you to do this. , it's even more ruthless."" Baoyu hurriedly said, ""Don't say this again."" Xiren said, ""This is the first thing to be changed."" Baoyu said, ""It's changed, if you want to say anything more, you will screw your mouth. .What else?""","“Do tell me what these conditions are,” Pao-yue pressed her with alacrity, as he smiled, “and I’ll assent to one and all. My dear sister, my own dear sister, not to speak of two or three, but even two or three hundred of them I’m quite ready to accept. All I entreat you is that you and all of you should combine to watch over me and take care of me, until some day when I shall be transformed into flying ashes; but flying ashes are, after all, not opportune, as they have form and substance and they likewise possess sense, but until I’ve been metamorphosed into a streak of subtle smoke. And when the wind shall have with one puff dispelled me, all of you then will be unable to attend to me, just as much as I myself won’t be able to heed you. You will, when that time comes, let me go where I please, as I’ll let you speed where you choose to go!” These words so harassed Hsi Jen that she hastened to put her hand over his mouth. “Speak decently,” she said; “I was on account of this just about to admonish you, and now here you are uttering all this still more loathsome trash.” “I won’t utter these words again,” Pao-yue eagerly added. “This is the first fault that you must change,” Hsi Jen replied. “I’ll amend,” Pao-yue observed, “and if I say anything of the kind again you can wring my mouth; but what else is there?”","‘Tell me what they are!’ he said impetuously. ‘I promise to obey you. Dearest Aroma! Sweetest Aroma! Never mind two or three: I would promise if it were two or three hundred! All I ask is that you shouldn’t leave me. If the day ever comes when nothing remains of me but floating particles of ash – no, not ash. Ash has form and substance and perhaps consciousness too. Say smoke. A puff of thin smoke dissolved upon the wind. When that is all that remains of me, and you can no longer fuss over me because there is nothing left to fuss over, and I can no longer pay attention to you because there is nothing left to pay attention with – when that time comes, you may go or stay as you please!’ ‘My dear young gentleman,’ said Aroma exasperatedly, clapping her hand over his mouth to prevent him saying any more, ‘it’s precisely this way of carrying on that I was going to talk to you about, and here you go, ranting away worse than ever!’ ‘Right,’ said Bao-yu. ‘Right. I promise never to talk that way again.’ ‘That was the first thing I wanted you to reform.’ ‘I’ve reformed already,’ said Bao-yu. ‘If I ever talk that way again, you can pinch my lips! Then what ?’ ‘The second thing is this,’ said Aroma."
至次日，卯正二刻便過來了。那寧國府中婆娘媳婦早已到齊，只見鳳姐正與來昇媳婦分派，眾人不敢擅入，只在窗外聽覷。只聽鳳姐與來昇媳婦道：「既託了我，我就說不得要討你們嫌了。我可比不得你們奶奶好性兒，由著你們去。再不要說你們『這府裏原是這樣』的話，如今可要依著我行，錯我半點兒，管不得誰是有臉的，誰是沒臉的，一例清白處治。」說著，便吩咐彩明唸花名冊，按名一個一個的喚進來看視。,"The next day, Mao Zheng came over at two quarters. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law in the Ningguo Mansion had already arrived, and they saw Sister Feng and Laisheng's daughter-in-law being assigned. Everyone did not dare to enter without authorization, and only watched from the window. I just heard Sister Feng and Laisheng's daughter-in-law saying, ""Since you have entrusted me, I can't say that I will dislike you. I can't compare to your grandma, so I'll let you go. Don't say you, 'This is the way the house is. ”, now you have to follow me, and I’m wrong. I don’t care who has the face and who has no face, and they will be punished in one case.” After speaking, he instructed Cai Ming to read the roster and call them one by one by name. Call in to see.","On the next day, at six and two quarters, she speedily came over. The matrons and married women of the Ning Kuo mansion assembled together, as soon as they heard of her arrival; but, perceiving lady Feng, assisted by Lai Sheng’s wife, engaged in apportioning the duties of each servant, they could not presume to intrude, but remained outside the window listening to what was going on. “As I’ve been asked to take over the charge,” they heard lady Feng explain to Lai Sheng’s wife, “I’m, needless to say, sure to incur the displeasure of you all, for I can’t compare with your mistress, who has such a sweet temper, and allows you to have your own way. But saying nothing more of those ways, which prevailed hitherto among your people in this mansion, you must now do as I tell you; for on the slightest disregard of my orders, I shall, with no discrimination between those who may be respectable and those who may not be, clearly and distinctly call all alike to account.” Having concluded these remarks, she went on to order Ts’ai Ming to read the roll; and, as their names were uttered, one by one was called in, and passed under inspection. After this inspection, which was got over in a short time, she continued giving further directions.","At half past six next morning she was back at the Ning-guo mansion. By this time all the married women on the staff had been assembled. Not daring to go in, they hung about outside the window listening to Xi-feng discussing work-plans with Lai Sheng’s wife inside the office. ‘Now that I’m in charge here’, they heard her telling the latter, ‘I won’t promise to make myself agreeable. I haven’t got a sweet temper like your mistress, you know. You won’t find me letting you do everything just as it suits you. So don’t let me hear anyone saying “We don’t do it that way here ”! From now on, whatever it is, you do it the way I tell you to, and anyone who departs by as much as a hair’s breadth from what I say is for it good and proper, no matter how senior or how important she thinks she is!’ Having delivered herself of this formidable preliminary she ordered Sunshine to call the roll. One by one the women stepped into the office to be looked at."
這裏賈蕓隨著墜兒，逶迤來至怡紅院中。墜兒先進去回明了，然後方領賈蕓進去。賈蕓看時，只見院內略略有幾點山石，種著芭蕉，那邊有兩隻僊鶴在松樹下剔翎。一溜迴廊上吊著各色籠子，各色僊禽異鳥。上面小小五間抱廈，一色雕鏤新鮮花樣槅扇，上面懸著一個匾額，四個大字，題道是「怡紅快綠」。賈蕓想道：「怪道叫『怡紅院』，原來匾上是恁樣四個字。」正想著，只聽裏面隔著紗窗子笑說道：「快進來罷。我怎麼就忘了你兩三個月！」賈蕓聽得是寶玉的聲音，連忙進入房內。抬頭一看，只見金碧輝煌，文章熌灼，卻看不見寶玉在那裏。一回頭，只見左邊立著一架大穿衣鏡，從鏡後轉出兩個一般大的十五六歲的丫頭來說：「請二爺裏頭屋裏坐。」賈蕓連正眼也不敢看，連忙答應了。又進一道碧紗廚，只見小小一張填漆床上，懸著大紅銷金撒花帳子。寶玉穿著家常衣服，靸著鞋，倚在床上拿著本書，看見他進來，將書擲下，早堆著笑立起身來。賈蕓忙上前請了安。寶玉讓坐，便在下面一張椅子上坐了。寶玉笑道：「只從那個月見了你，我叫你往書房裏來，誰知接接連連許多事情，就把你忘了。」賈蕓笑道：「總是我沒福，偏偏又遇著叔叔身上欠安。叔叔如今可大安了？」寶玉道：「大好了。我倒聽見說你辛苦了好幾天。」賈蕓道：「辛苦也是該當的。叔叔大安了，也是我們一家子的造化。」,"Here Jia Yun follows the pendant and wanders to the Yihong Courtyard. Chuan'er went back to Mingxian first, and then Fang led Jia Yun in. When Jia Yun looked at it, she saw that there were a few rocks in the courtyard, with plantains planted there, and there were two cranes plucking their feathers under the pine trees. There are various cages hanging on the corridor, and all kinds of fairy birds and birds. On the top is a small five-room pavilion, with a freshly carved fan in one color, and a plaque hanging on it with four characters, the inscription is ""Yihong and fast green"". Jia Yun thought, ""The strange road is called 'Yihong Courtyard', so it turns out that there are four characters on the plaque."" Just as she was thinking, she smiled and said through the screen window, ""Come in. Why did I forget you?"" Two or three months!"" Jia Yun heard Baoyu's voice and hurriedly entered the room. When I looked up, I saw the splendor of gold and jade, and the writing was scorching, but I couldn't see Baoyu there. When I turned around, I saw a large full-length mirror standing on the left. From behind the mirror, two 15- or 16-year-old girls turned out and said, ""Second Master, please sit in the room."" Jia Yun didn't even dare to look directly. Hastily agreed. Entering another Bisha kitchen, I saw a small bed filled with lacquer, with a big red and gold flower tent hanging on it. Baoyu was wearing home clothes and shoes, leaning on the bed and holding a book. When he saw him come in, he threw the book down, and stood up smiling early. Jia Yun hurriedly stepped forward and asked An. Baoyu let him sit, and then sat down on a chair below. Baoyu smiled and said, ""I only saw you from that month, and I told you to come to the study. Who would have thought that many things happened one after another, and I would have forgotten about you."" Jia Yun smiled and said, ""I'm always unlucky, but it happens again I feel bad about my uncle. Is my uncle safe now?"" Baoyu said, ""It's great. I heard that you have worked hard for a few days."" Jia Yun said, ""The hard work is also deserved. Uncle is safe now, and it is also our family. creation.""","During this time, Chia Yuen followed Chui Erh, by a circuitous way, into the I Hung court. Chui Erh entered first and made the necessary announcement. Then subsequently she ushered in Chia Yuen. When Chia Yuen scrutinised the surroundings, he perceived, here and there in the court, several blocks of rockery, among which were planted banana-trees. On the opposite side were two storks preening their feathers under the fir trees. Under the covered passage were suspended, in a row, cages of every description, containing all sorts of fairylike, rare birds. In the upper part were five diminutive anterooms, uniformly carved with, unique designs; and above the framework of the door was hung a tablet with the inscription in four huge characters--”I Hung K’uai Lue, the happy red and joyful green.” “I thought it strange,” Chia Yuen argued mentally, “that it should be called the I Hung court; but are these, in fact, the four characters inscribed on the tablet!” But while he was communing within himself, he heard some one laugh and then exclaim from the inner side of the gauze window: “Come in at once! How is it that I’ve forgotten you these two or three months?” As soon as Chia Yuen recognised Pao-yue’s voice, he entered the room with hurried step. On raising his head, his eye was attracted by the brilliant splendour emitted by gold and jade and by the dazzling lustre of the elegant arrangements. He failed, however, to detect where Pao-yue was ensconced. The moment he turned his head round, he espied, on the left side, a large cheval-glass; behind which appeared to view, standing side by side, two servant-girls of fifteen or sixteen years of age. “Master Secundus,” they ventured, “please take a seat in the inner room.” Chia Yuen could not even muster courage to look at them straight in the face; but promptly assenting, he walked into a green gauze mosquito-house, where he saw a small lacquered bed, hung with curtains of a deep red colour, with clusters of flowers embroidered in gold. Pao-yue, wearing a house-dress and slipshod shoes, was reclining on the bed, a book in hand. The moment he perceived Chia Yuen walk in, he discarded his book, and forthwith smiled and raised himself up. Chia Yuen hurriedly pressed forward and paid his salutation. Pao-yue then offered him a seat; but he simply chose a chair in the lower part of the apartment. “Ever since the moon in which I came across you,” Pao-yue observed smilingly, “and told you to come into the library, I’ve had, who would have thought it, endless things to continuously attend to, so that I forgot all about you.” “It’s I, indeed, who lacked good fortune!” rejoined Chia Yuen, with a laugh; “particularly so, as it again happened that you, uncle, fell ill. But are you quite right once more?” “All right!” answered Pao-yue. “I heard that you’ve been put to much trouble and inconvenience on a good number of days!” “Had I even had any trouble to bear,” added Chia Yuen, “it would have been my duty to bear it. But your complete recovery, uncle, is really a blessing to our whole family.”","Our narrative now follows Jia Yun and Trinket along the winding pathway to the House of Green Delights. Soon they were at the courtyard gate and Jia Yun waited outside while she went in to announce his arrival. She returned presently to lead him inside. There were a few scattered rocks in the courtyard and some clumps of jade-green plantain. Two storks stood in the shadow of a pine-tree, preening themselves with their long bills. The gallery surrounding the courtyard was hung with cages of unusual design in which perched or fluttered a wide variety of birds, some of them gay-plumaged exotic ones. Above the steps was a little five-frame penthouse building with a glimpse of delicately-carved partitions visible through the open doorway, above which a horizontal board hung, inscribed with the words CRIMSON JOYS AND GREEN DELIGHTS ‘So that’s why it’s called “The House of Green Delights ”‘Jia Yun told himself.’ The name is taken from the inscription.’ A laughing voice addressed him from behind one of the silk gauze casements: ‘Come on in! It must be two or three months since I first forgot our appointment!’ Jia Yun recognized the voice as Bao-yu’s and hurried up the steps inside. He looked about him, dazzled by the brilliance of gold and semi-precious inlay-work and the richness of the ornaments and furnishings, but unable to see Bao-yu in the midst of it all. To the left of him was a full-length mirror from behind which two girls now emerged, both about fifteen or sixteen years old and of much the same build and height. They addressed him by name and asked him to come inside. Slightly overawed, he muttered something in reply and hurried after them, not daring to take more than a furtive glance at them from the corner of his eye. They ushered him into a tent-like summer ‘cabinet’ of green net, whose principal furniture was a tiny lacquered bed with crimson hangings heavily patterned in gold. On this Bao-yu, wearing everyday clothes and a pair of bedroom slippers, was reclining, book in hand. He threw the book down as Jia Yun entered and rose to his feet with a welcoming smile. Jia Yun swiftly dropped knee and hand to floor in greeting. Bidden to sit, he modestly placed himself on a bedside chair. ‘After I invited you round to my study that day,’ said Bao-yu, ‘a whole lot of things seemed to happen one after the other, and I’m afraid I quite forgot about your visit.’ Jia Yun returned his smile: ‘Let’s just say that it wasn’t my luck to see you then. But you have been ill since then, Uncle Bao. Are you quite better now?’ ‘Quite better, thank you. I hear you’ve been very busy these last few days.’ ‘That’s as it should be,’ said Jia Yun. ‘But I’m glad you are better, Uncle. That’s a piece of good fortune for all of us.’"
大家想著，寶玉卻等不得了，也不等賈政的命，便說道：「舊詩有云：『紅杏梢頭掛酒旗』。如今莫若『杏簾在望』四字。」眾人都道：「好個『在望』！又暗合『杏花村』意。」寶玉冷笑道：「村名若用『杏花』二字，則俗陋不堪了。又有古人詩云：『柴門臨水稻花香』，何不就用『稻香村』的妙？」眾人聽了，亦發哄聲拍手道：「妙！」賈政一聲斷喝：「無知的業障！你能知道幾個古人，能記得幾首熟詩，也敢在老先生前賣弄！你方纔那些胡說的，不過是試你的清濁，取笑而已，你就認真了！」,"Everyone thought about it, but Baoyu couldn't wait, and he didn't wait for Jia Zheng's life, so he said: ""There is a saying in an old poem: 'The red apricot tip hangs a wine flag'. ""What a 'in sight'! It also coincides with the meaning of 'Xinghua Village'."" Baoyu sneered: ""If the name of the village uses the word 'Xinghua', it will be very vulgar. Another ancient poem said: ""Chaimen is near the fragrance of rice and flowers."" Why not just use the magic of 'Daoxiang Village'?"" When everyone heard it, they clapped their hands in a loud voice and said, ""Wonderful!"" Jia Zheng shouted, ""Ignorance of karma! How many ancient people can you know and how many poems you can remember? Dare to show off in front of the old gentleman! The nonsense you just said was just a test of your innocence and made fun of you, you should be serious!""","Pao-yue did not however give them time to think; nor did he wait for Chia Cheng’s permission, but suggested there and then: “In old poetical works there’s this passage: ‘At the top of the red apricot tree hangs the flag of an inn,’ and wouldn’t it be advisable, on this occasion, to temporarily adopt the four words: ‘the sign on the apricot tree is visible’?” “‘Is visible’ is excellent,” suggested the whole number of them, “and what’s more it secretly accords with the meaning implied by ‘apricot blossom village.’“ “Were the two words ‘apricot blossom’ used for the name of the village, they would be too commonplace and unsuitable;” added Pao-yue with a sardonic grin, “but there’s another passage in the works of a poet of the T’ang era: ‘By the wooden gate near the water the corn-flower emits its fragrance;’ and why not make use of the motto ‘corn fragrance village,’ which will be excellent?” When the company heard his proposal, they, with still greater vigour, unanimously combined in crying out “Capital!” as they clapped their hands. Chia Cheng, with one shout, interrupted their cries, “You ignorant child of wrath!” he ejaculated; “how many old writers can you know, and how many stanzas of ancient poetical works can you remember, that you will have the boldness to show off in the presence of all these experienced gentlemen? (In allowing you to give vent to) all the nonsense you uttered my object was no other than to see whether your brain was clear or muddled; and all for fun’s sake, that’s all; and lo, you’ve taken things in real earnest!”","While they were all still thinking, Bao-yu who had already had an idea, was so bursting with eagerness that he broke in, without waiting to be invited by his father: ‘There is an old poem which has the lines Above the flowering apricot A hopeful inn-sign hangs. For the inscription on the stone we ought to have “The Hopeful Sign”.’ ‘“The Hopeful Sign”,’ echoed the literary gentlemen admiringly. ‘Very good! The hidden allusion to “Apricot Village” is most ingenious!’ ‘Oh, as for the name of the village,’ said Bao-yu scornfully, ‘“Apricot Village” is much too obvious! Why not “Sweet-rice Village” from the words of the old poem: A cottage by the water stands Where sweet the young rice smells?’ The literary gentlemen clapped their hands delightedly; but their cries of admiration were cut short by an angry shout from Jia Zheng: ‘Ignorant young puppy! Just how many “old poets” and “old poems” do you think you know, that you should presume to show off in front of your elders in this impertinent manner? We let you have your little say just now in order to test your intelligence. It was no more than a joke. Do you suppose we are seriously interested in your opinions?’"
周瑞家的答應了，因說：「四姑娘不在房裏，只怕在老太太那邊呢。」丫鬟們道：「那屋裏不是！」周瑞家的聽了，便往這邊屋內來。只見惜春正同水月庵的小姑子智能兒一處頑耍呢，見周瑞家的進來，惜春便問他何事。周瑞家的便將花匣打開，說明原故。惜春笑道：「我這裏正和智能兒說，我明兒也剃了頭同他作姑子去呢，可巧又送了花兒來；若剃了頭，可把這花兒戴在那裏呢？」說著，大家取笑一回，惜春命丫鬟入畫來收了。,"Zhou Rui's family agreed, because he said, ""The fourth girl is not in the room, I'm afraid it's with the old lady."" The maids said, ""It's not in that room!"" Zhou Rui's family heard this and went into the house. I saw that Xichun was playing tricks with Zhizhi'er, the sister-in-law of Shuiyue Nunnery. When Zhou Rui's family came in, Xichun asked him what was going on. Zhou Rui's family opened the flower box and explained the reason. Xichun smiled and said, ""I'm talking to Zhizhi'er here, I'll shave my head tomorrow to be my sister-in-law with him, but luckily I brought flowers. If I shaved my head, where can I wear the flowers?"" Having said that, everyone made fun of it once, and Xichun ordered the maid to enter the painting and accept it.","Mrs. Chou complied with their wishes (and handing over the flowers); “Miss Hsi Ch’un,” she remarked, “is not at home; and possibly she’s over there with our old lady.” “She’s in that room, isn’t she?” inquired the waiting-maids. Mrs. Chou at these words readily came into the room on this side, where she found Hsi Ch’un, in company with a certain Chih Neng, a young nun of the “moon reflected on water” convent, talking and laughing together. On seeing Chou Jui’s wife enter, Hsi Ch’un at once asked what she wanted, whereupon Chou Jui’s wife opened the box of flowers, and explained who had sent them. “I was just telling Chih Neng,” remarked Hsi Ch’un laughing, “that I also purpose shortly shaving my head and becoming a nun; and strange enough, here you again bring me flowers; but supposing I shave my head, where can I wear them?” They were all very much amused for a time with this remark, and Hsi Ch’un told her waiting-maid, Ju Hua, to come and take over the flowers.","‘Where is Miss Xi-chun?’ Zhou Rui’s wife inquired. ‘Isn’t she in the next room?’ said the maids; and there in fact she proved to be, playing with the little nun Sapientia from Water-moon Priory. She asked Zhou Rui’s wife what she had come for, and when Zhou Rui’s wife took the flowers from the box and explained, she laughed: ‘I was telling Sapientia that one of these days I am going to have my hair shaved and go off with her to be a nun, when just at that very moment you came in with these flowers. What shall I do with flowers when I have no hair to stick them in?’ Further pleasantries followed from the others present. Xi-chun told one of the maids to take the flowers and look after them."
寶玉只得前去，一步挪不了三指，蹉到這邊來。可巧賈政在王夫人房中商議事情。金釧兒、彩雲、彩霞、繡鸞、繡鳳等眾丫鬟都在廊檐底下站著呢，一見寶玉來，都抿著嘴笑。金釧一把拉住寶玉，悄悄的笑道：「我這嘴上是纔擦的香浸胭脂，你這會子可喫不喫了？」彩雲一把推開金釧，笑道：「人家正心裏不自在，你還奚落他。趁這會子喜歡，快進去罷。」寶玉只得挨進門去。原來賈政和王夫人都在裏間呢。趙姨娘打起簾子，寶玉躬身進去。只見賈政和王夫人對面坐在炕上說話，地下一溜椅子，迎春、探春、惜春、賈環四個人都坐在那裏。一見他進來，惟有探春和惜春、賈環站了起來。,"Baoyu had no choice but to go forward, unable to move three fingers in a single step, and came to this side. Coincidentally, Jia Zheng was discussing matters in Mrs. Wang's room. Jin Chuan'er, Caiyun, Caixia, Xiuluan, Xiufeng and other maids were all standing under the eaves of the corridor, and when they saw Baoyu coming, they all pursed their lips and smiled. Jin Chuan grabbed Baoyu and smiled quietly, ""I just rubbed the incense-dipped rouge on my mouth, can you eat it now?"" Caiyun pushed the Jin Chuan away and said with a smile, ""I am If you feel uncomfortable, you still make fun of him. Come in while you like it now."" Baoyu had to go through the door. It turned out that Jia Zheng and Mrs. Wang were both inside. Concubine Zhao opened the curtain and Baoyu bowed to enter. I saw Jia Zheng and Mrs. Wang sitting opposite to each other on the kang talking, slipping chairs down the ground, Yingchun, Tanchun, Xichun, and Jia Huan were all sitting there. Seeing him come in, only Tanchun, Xichun and Jia Huan stood up.","The old nurses expressed their obedience, and Pao-yue felt constrained to walk ahead; and with one step scarcely progressing three inches, he leisurely came over to this side. Strange coincidence Chia Cheng was in madame Wang’s apartments consulting with her upon some matter or other, and Chin Ch’uan-erh, Ts’ai Yun, Ts’ai Feng, Ts’ai Luan, Hsiu Feng and the whole number of waiting-maids were all standing outside under the verandah. As soon as they caught sight of Pao-yue, they puckered up their mouths and laughed at him; while Chin Ch’uan grasped Pao-yue with one hand, and remarked in a low tone of voice: “On these lips of mine has just been rubbed cosmetic, soaked with perfume, and are you now inclined to lick it or not?” whereupon Ts’ai Yuen pushed off Chin Ch’uan with one shove, as she interposed laughingly, “A person’s heart is at this moment in low spirits and do you still go on cracking jokes at him? But avail yourself of this opportunity when master is in good cheer to make haste and get in!” Pao-yue had no help but to sidle against the door and walk in. Chia Cheng and madame Wang were, in fact, both in the inner rooms, and dame Chou raised the portiere. Pao-yue stepped in gingerly and perceived Chia Cheng and madame Wang sitting opposite to each other, on the stove-couch, engaged in conversation; while below on a row of chairs sat Ying Ch’un, T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and Chia Huan; but though all four of them were seated in there only T’an Ch’un, Hsi Ch’un and Chia Huan rose to their feet, as soon as they saw him make his appearance in the room; and when Chia Cheng raised his eyes and noticed Pao-yue standing in front of him, with a gait full of ease and with those winsome looks of his, so captivating, he once again realised what a mean being Chia Huan was, and how coarse his deportment.","Obliged to go, yet still reluctant, Bao-yu contrived to do so at so dawdling a pace that each step can have advanced him only a few inches upon his way. It so happened that Jia Zheng had gone for the purpose of discussing these matters into Lady Wang’s room and Lady Wang’s maids Golden, Sun-cloud, Sunset, Avis and Avocet were standing outside under the eaves. Their amusement when they caught sight of Bao-yu advancing at this snail’s pace into the courtyard was evident from the expression on their faces. Golden seized him by the hand, and thrusting out a pair of heavily carmined lips, she said to him in a whisper: ‘Look at that byootiful lipstick! I’ve only just put it on. Wouldn’t you like a taste of it?’ Suncloud, with a suppressed giggle, pushed her off him: ‘Can’t you see how scared he is ? It’s mean of you to tease him at a time like this! He’s in a good mood,’ she said to Bao-yu. ‘You’d better go in straight away, while it lasts!’ Bao-yu entered in a sort of sideways crouch, the picture of a submissive son – a gesture that was wasted, however, since his father and mother were in the inner room at the back. Aunt Zhao raised the inner room’s portière to admit him. He bowed to her and entered. Jia Zheng and Lady Wang sat facing each other on the kang talking. Ying-chun, Tan-chun, Xi-chun and Jia Huan were sitting on a row of chairs below. Ying-chun remained seated at his entrance, but the other three rose to their feet."
此時王夫人那邊熱鬧非常。原來賈薔已從姑蘇採買了十二個女孩子，並聘了教習，以及行頭等事來了。那時薛姨媽另遷於東北上一所幽靜房舍居住，將梨香院早已騰挪出來，另行修理了，就令教習在此教演女戲。又另派家中舊有曾演學過歌唱的女人們——如今皆已皤然老嫗了，著他們帶領管理。就令賈薔總理其日用出入銀錢等事，以及諸凡大小所需之物料帳目。,"At this time, Mrs. Wang was very lively. It turned out that Jia Qiang had bought twelve girls from Gusu Cai, hired teachers, and came to do the first thing. At that time, Aunt Xue moved to live in a quiet house in the northeast. She had already vacated the Lixiangyuan and repaired it separately, so she ordered the teacher to teach women's plays here. In addition, there are women in the family who used to act and learn to sing - now they are all old women, and they lead the management. To make Prime Minister Jia Qiang's daily use of money, money, etc., as well as the accounts of materials needed for all sizes.","Wang’s suite of apartments, where, as luck would have it, Pao-ch’ai was also seated. Unusual commotion prevailed, at this time, over at madame Wang’s, for the fact is that Chia Se had already come back from Ku Su, where he had selected twelve young girls, and settled about an instructor, as well as about the theatrical properties and the other necessaries. And as Mrs. Hsueeh had by this date moved her quarters into a separate place on the northeast side, and taken up her abode in a secluded and quiet house, (madame Wang) had had repairs of a distinct character executed in the Pear Fragrance Court, and then issued directions that the instructor should train the young actresses in this place; and casting her choice upon all the women, who had, in days of old, received a training in singing, and who were now old matrons with white hair , she bade them have an eye over them and keep them in order. Which done, she enjoined Chia Se to assume the chief control of all matters connected with the daily and monthly income and outlay, as well as of the accounts of all articles in use of every kind and size.","Bao-chai was there already. They found everyone there in a state of great excitement owing to the fact that Jia Qiang had just arrived back from Soochow with the twelve child-actresses he had purchased there, together with their instructors and all the costumes and properties they would use in performing their plays. Aunt Xue had now moved to a quiet, secluded apartment in the north-east corner of the mansion, and Pear-tree Court was undergoing alterations for use as a drama school where the instructors could train and rehearse their little charges. A number of female members of the Rong-guo staff who had some previous training in singing and acting – they were all grey-haired old women by now – were put in charge of the domestic arrangements. Pay and expenses and the provision of whatever was needed for the maintenance of the troupe was to remain in the hands of Jia Qiang, who was also to keep the accounts."
一面傳人一擔一擔的挑進蠟燭來，各處點燈，方點完時，忽聽外邊馬跑之聲。一時，有十來個太監都喘吁吁跑來拍手兒。這些太監會意，都知道是「來了，來了」，各按方向站住。賈赦領合族子侄在西街門外，賈母領合族女眷在大門外迎接。半日靜悄悄的。忽見一對紅衣太監騎馬緩緩的走來，至西街門下了馬，將馬趕出圍幙之外，便垂手面西站住。半日又是一對，亦是如此。少時便來了十來對，方聞得隱隱細樂之聲。一對對龍旌鳳翣，雉羽夔頭，又有銷金提爐焚著御香；然後一把曲柄七鳳黃金傘過來，便是冠袍帶履。又有值事太監捧著香珠、繡帕、漱盂、拂塵等類。一隊隊過完，後面方是八個太監抬著一頂金頂金黃繡鳳版輿，緩緩行來。賈母等連忙路旁跪下。早飛跑過幾個太監來，扶起賈母、邢夫人、王夫人來。那版輿抬進大門，入儀門往東去，到一所院落門前，有執拂太監跪請下輿更衣。於是抬輿入門，太監等散去，衹有昭容、彩嬪等引領元春下輿。只見院內各色花燈爛灼，皆係紗綾紮成，精緻非常。上面有一匾燈，寫著「體仁沐德」四字。元春入室，更衣畢復出，上輿進園。只見園中香煙繚繞，花彩繽紛，處處燈光相映，時時細樂聲喧，說不盡這太平氣象，富貴風流。,"On the one hand, the descendants brought in the candles one by one and lit the lamps everywhere. When the lights were finished, they suddenly heard the sound of horses running outside. At one point, a dozen or so eunuchs came running out and clapping their hands. These eunuchs agreed, and they all knew that it was ""come, come,"" and each stood in the direction. Jia She led her family’s sons and nephews outside the gate of West Street, and Jia’s mother led her family’s daughters to greet them outside the gate. Quiet for half a day. Suddenly I saw a pair of red-clothed eunuchs slowly approaching on horseback, dismounted at the West Street Gate, drove the horses out of the enclosure, and stood with their hands facing the west. Half a day is a pair again, and the same is true. When I was young, there were about ten pairs, and I could hear the faint sound of music. A pair of dragons, phoenixes and phoenixes, pheasant feathers and Kui heads, and a gold stove burning royal incense; then a cranked seven-phoenix golden umbrella came over, and it was a crown robe and shoes. There are also eunuchs on duty holding incense beads, embroidered handkerchiefs, gargles, whisks, etc. After the line was over, behind them were eight eunuchs carrying a golden-topped golden embroidered phoenix version, walking slowly. Mother Jia and others hurriedly knelt by the roadside. Zaofei ran over a few eunuchs and helped Jia Mu, Madam Xing, and Madam Wang. That version of Yu was carried into the gate, entered the gate of ceremonies and headed east, and in front of a courtyard gate, there was a eunuch Zhifu on his knees and asked Xiayu to change. Therefore, the eunuchs and others dispersed, and only Zhaorong, Caibi and others led Yuanchun to the court. I saw all kinds of lanterns in the courtyard, all tied with gauze, very delicate. There is a plaque on it with the words ""Benevolence and Virtue"" written on it. Yuanchun entered the room, finished dressing and came back, and Shangyu entered the garden. I saw cigarettes lingering in the garden, the flowers were colorful, the lights reflected each other everywhere, and the music was always loud.","Dowager lady Chia and the other ladies immediately left for a time and suited their own convenience, and as everything in the garden devolved upon lady Feng to supervise, she ordered the butlers to take the eunuchs and give them something to eat and drink; and at the same time, she sent word that candles should be brought in and that the lanterns in the various places should be lit. But unexpectedly was heard from outside the continuous patter of horses running, whereupon about ten eunuchs hurried in gasping and out of breath. They clapped their hands, and the several eunuchs (who had come before), understanding the signal, and knowing that the party had arrived, stood in their respective positions; while Chia She, at the head of all the men of the clan, remained at the western street door, and dowager lady Chia, at the head of the female relatives of the family, waited outside the principal entrance to do the honours. For a long interval, everything was plunged in silence and quiet; when suddenly two eunuchs on horseback were espied advancing with leisurely step. Reaching the western street gate, they dismounted, and, driving their horses beyond the screens, they forthwith took their stand facing the west. After another long interval, a second couple arrived, and went likewise through the same proceedings. In a short time, drew near about ten couples, when, at length, were heard the gentle strains of music, and couple by couple advanced with banners, dragons, with fans made with phoenix feathers, and palace flabella of pheasant plumes; and those besides who carried gold-washed censers burning imperial incense. Next in order was brought past a state umbrella of golden yellow, with crooked handle and embroidered with seven phoenixes; after which quickly followed the crown, robe, girdle and shoes. There were likewise eunuchs, who took a part in the procession, holding scented handkerchiefs and embroidered towels, cups for rinsing the mouth, dusters and other such objects; and company after company went past, when, at the rear, approached with stately step eight eunuchs carrying an imperial sedan chair, of golden yellow, with a gold knob and embroidered with phoenixes. Old lady Chia and the other members of the family hastily fell on their knees, but a eunuch came over at once to raise her ladyship and the rest; and the imperial chair was thereupon carried through the main entrance, the ceremonial gate and into a court on the eastern side, at the door of which stood a eunuch, who prostrated himself and invited (her highness) to dismount and change her costume. Having forthwith carried her inside the gate, the eunuchs dispersed; and only the maids-of-honour and ladies-in-waiting ushered Yuan Ch’un out of the chair, when what mainly attracted her eye in the park was the brilliant lustre of the flowered lamps of every colour, all of which were made of gauze or damask, and were beautiful in texture, and out of the common run; while on the upper side was a flat lantern with the inscription in four characters, “Regarded (by His Majesty’s) benevolence and permeated by his benefits.” Yuan Ch’un entered the apartment and effected the necessary changes in her toilette; after which, she again egressed, and, mounting her chair, she made her entry into the garden, when she perceived the smoke of incense whirling and twirling, and the reflection of the flowers confusing the eyes. Far and wide, the rays of light, shed by the lanterns, intermingled their brilliancy, while, from time to time, fine strains of music sounded with clamorous din.","Under her direction some of the stewards carried off the eunuchs and treated them to food and wine, while other servants fetched great bundles of wax candles to illuminate the garden’s many lanterns with. Suddenly, as afternoon drew towards evening, a clatter of many hooves was heard, and after a short pause, a group of ten or so eunuchs rushed in out of breath, clapping their hands as they ran. This was taken by the other eunuchs as a sign that the Imperial Concubine was on her way, for they at once jumped up and hurried to their prearranged places. The family, too, took up their positions once more, Jia She and the menfolk outside the west gate and Grandmother Jia with the ladies outside the main entrance. For a long time there was total silence. Then a couple of eunuchs on horseback came riding very, very slowly up to the west gate. Dismounting, they led their horses out of sight behind the cloth screens, then returned to take up their stand at the sides of the road, half-facing towards the west. After a considerable wait, two more eunuchs arrived and went through the same motions as the first pair. Then another two, and then another, until in all some ten pairs were standing at the sides of the road, their faces turned expectantly towards the west. Presently a faint sound of music was heard and the Imperial Concubine’s procession at last came in sight. First came several pairs of eunuchs carrying embroidered banners. Then several more pairs with ceremonial pheasant-feather fans. Then eunuchs swinging gold-inlaid censers in which special ‘palace incense’ was burning. Next came a great gold-coloured ‘seven-phoenix’ umbrella of state, hanging from its curve-topped shaft like a great drooping bell-flower. In its shadow was borne the Imperial Concubine’s travelling wardrobe: her head-dress, robe, sash and shoes. Eunuch gentlemen-in-waiting followed carrying her rosary, her embroidered handkerchief, her spittoon, her fly-whisk, and various other items. Last of all, when this army of attendants had gone by, a great gold-topped palanquin with phoenixes embroidered on its yellow curtains slowly advanced on the shoulders of eight eunuch bearers. As Grandmother Jia and the rest dropped to their knees eunuchs rushed up and helped them to get up again. The palanquin passed through the great gate and made for the entrance of a courtyard on the east side of the forecourt. There a eunuch knelt beside it and invited the Imperial Concubine to descend and ‘change her clothes’. The bearers carried it through the entrance and set it down just inside the courtyard. The other eunuchs then withdrew, leaving Yuan-chun’s ladies-in-waiting to help her from the palanquin. The courtyard she now stepped out into was brilliant with coloured lanterns of silk gauze cunningly fashioned in all sorts of curious and beautiful shapes and patterns. An illuminated sign hung over the entrance of the principal building: FILLED WITH FAVOURS BATHED IN BLESSINGS Yuan-chun passed beneath it into the room that had been prepared for her, then, having ‘changed her clothes’, came out again and stepped back into the palanquin, which was now borne into the garden. Her first impression was a confused one of curling drifts of incense smoke and gleaming colours."

說著，進入石洞來。只見佳木蘢蔥，奇花熌灼，一帶清流，從花木深處曲折瀉於石隙之中。再進數步，漸向北邊，平坦寬豁，兩邊飛樓插空，雕甍繡檻，皆隱於山坳樹杪之間。俯而視之，則清溪瀉雪，石磴穿雲，白石為欄，環抱池沼，石橋三港，獸面銜吐。橋上有亭。賈政與諸人上了亭子，倚欄坐了，因問：「諸公以何題此？」諸人都道：「當日歐陽公《醉翁亭記》有云：『有亭翼然』，就名『翼然』。」賈政笑道：「『翼然』雖佳，但此亭壓水而成，還須偏於水題方稱。依我抽裁，歐陽公之『瀉出於兩峰之間』，竟用他這一個『瀉』字。」有一客道：「是極，是極。竟是『瀉玉』二字妙。」賈政拈髯尋思，因抬頭見寶玉侍側，便笑命他也擬一個來，寶玉聽說，連忙回道：「老爺方纔所議已是。但是如今追究了去，似乎當日歐陽公題釀泉用一『瀉』字則妥，今日此泉若亦用『瀉』字，則覺不妥。況此處雖云省親駐蹕別墅，亦當入於應制之例，用此等字眼，亦覺粗陋不雅。求再擬較此蘊藉含蓄者。」賈政笑道：「諸公聽此論若何？方纔眾人編新，你又說不如述古；如今我們述古，你又說粗陋不妥。你且說你的來我聽。」寶玉道：「有用『瀉玉』二字，則莫若『沁芳』二字，豈不新雅？」賈政拈髯點頭不語。眾人都忙迎合，贊寶玉才情不凡。賈政道：「匾上二字容易。再作一副七言對聯來。」寶玉聽說，立於亭上，四顧一望，便機上心來，乃念道：「繞堤柳借三篙翠，隔岸花分一脈香。」賈政聽了，點頭微笑。眾人先稱讚不已。,"With that said, enter the cave. I saw the green onions of the Jiamu, the scorching of the strange flowers, and a clear stream, which zigzagged from the depths of the flowers and trees into the stone crevices. Going a few steps further, it gradually goes to the north, flat and wide, with flying towers on both sides, carved, embroidered and embroidered thresholds, all hidden between the hills and tree branches. Looking down at it, the snow is pouring from the clear stream, the rocks are pierced through the clouds, the white stone is a fence, surrounded by ponds and marshes, the stone bridge is three ports, and the animal face vomits. There is a pavilion on the bridge. Jia Zheng and the others went up to the pavilion and sat leaning against the railing, because they asked, ""Why do you ask this question?"" Everyone said, ""On that day, Duke Ouyang's ""The Drunkard Pavilion"" said: 'There is a pavilion' It's called 'Yi Ran'."" Jia Zheng smiled and said, ""Although 'Yi Ran' is good, this pavilion is made of water, so it has to be called a water title. According to my choice, Ouyang Gongzhi's 'pour out' Between the two peaks', he actually used the word 'Xie'."" A guest said: ""It is extremely, it is extremely. It is actually the word 'Xieyu' is wonderful."" Jia Zheng frowned and thought, because he looked up to see Baoyu's attendant He smiled and ordered him to come up with another one. Baoyu heard it and quickly replied, ""What the lord just discussed has already been discussed. But now that I have investigated it, it seems that Ouyang Gongzhengquan used the word ""purge"" to be appropriate. Today If this spring also uses the word ""purge"", it would be inappropriate. Besides, even though Yun Xing is personally stationed in the villa, it should also be included in the example of the system. Using these words would also feel rude and indecent. Please try to compare this It's implicit."" Jia Zheng smiled and said, ""Why do you listen to this argument? Just now everyone has compiled a new version, but you say it is better to describe the ancients; now we are describing the ancients, and you say that it is crude and inappropriate. You can tell me yours and I will listen. Baoyu said, ""If the word 'Xieyu' is used, then the word 'Qinfang' cannot be used, isn't it new and elegant?"" Jia Zheng nodded and said nothing. Everyone was busy catering to him, praising Baoyu for his extraordinary talent. Jia Zheng said: ""It's easy to put two characters on the plaque. Then make a couplet with seven characters."" Baoyu heard that, and stood on the pavilion, looked around, and came on the plane, he read: ""Around the embankment willow to borrow three poles of greenery. , the flowers on the other bank share a fragrance."" Jia Zheng nodded and smiled when he heard this. The crowd complimented first.","As he spoke, he entered the cave, where he perceived beautiful trees with thick foliage, quaint flowers in lustrous bloom, while a line of limpid stream emanated out of a deep recess among the flowers and trees, and oozed down through the crevice of the rock. Progressing several steps further in, they gradually faced the northern side, where a stretch of level ground extended far and wide, on each side of which soared lofty buildings, intruding themselves into the skies, whose carved rafters and engraved balustrades nestled entirely among the depressions of the hills and the tops of the trees. They lowered their eyes and looked, and beheld a pure stream flowing like jade, stone steps traversing the clouds, a balustrade of white marble encircling the pond in its embrace, and a stone bridge with three archways, the animals upon which had faces disgorging water from their mouths. A pavilion stood on the bridge, and in this pavilion Chia Chen and the whole party went and sat. “Gentlemen,” he inquired, “what shall we write about this?” “In the record,” they all replied, “of the ‘Drunken Old Man’s Pavilion,’ written in days of old by Ou Yang, appears this line: ‘There is a pavilion pinioned-like,’ so let us call this ‘the pinioned-like pavilion,’ and finish.” “Pinioned-like,” observed Chia Cheng smiling, “is indeed excellent; but this pavilion is constructed over the water, and there should, after all, be some allusion to the water in the designation. My humble opinion is that of the line in Ou Yang’s work, ‘(the water) drips from between the two peaks,’ we should only make use of that single word ‘drips.’“ “First-rate!” rejoined one of the visitors, “capital! but what would really be appropriate are the two characters ‘dripping jadelike.’“ Chia Chen pulled at his moustache, as he gave way to reflection; after which, he asked Pao-yue to also propose one himself. “What you, sir, suggested a while back,” replied Pao-yue, “will do very well; but if we were now to sift the matter thoroughly, the use of the single word ‘drip’ by Ou Yang, in his composition about the Niang spring, would appear quite apposite; while the application, also on this occasion, to this spring, of the character ‘drip’ would be found not quite suitable. Moreover, seeing that this place is intended as a separate residence (for the imperial consort), on her visit to her parents, it is likewise imperative that we should comply with all the principles of etiquette, so that were words of this kind to be used, they would besides be coarse and inappropriate; and may it please you to fix upon something else more recondite and abstruse.” “What do you, gentlemen, think of this argument?” Chia Cheng remarked sneeringly. “A little while ago, when the whole company devised something original, you observed that it would be better to quote an old device; and now that we have quoted an old motto, you again maintain that it’s coarse and inappropriate! But you had better give us one of yours.” “If two characters like ‘dripping jadelike’ are to be used,” Pao-yue explained, “it would be better then to employ the two words ‘Penetrating Fragrance,’ which would be unique and excellent, wouldn’t they?” Chia Cheng pulled his moustache, nodded his head and did not utter a word; whereupon the whole party hastily pressed forward with one voice to eulogize Pao-yue’s acquirements as extraordinary. “The selection of two characters for the tablet is an easy matter,” suggested Chia Cheng, “but now go on and compose a pair of antithetical phrases with seven words in each.” Pao-yue cast a glance round the four quarters, when an idea came into his head, and he went on to recite: The willows, which enclose the shore, the green borrow from three bamboos; On banks apart, the flowers asunder grow, yet one perfume they give. Upon hearing these lines, Chia Cheng gave a faint smile, as he nodded his head, whilst the whole party went on again to be effusive in their praise.","As he spoke, they passed through a tunnel of rock in the mountain’s shoulder into an artificial ravine ablaze with the vari-coloured flowers and foliage of many varieties of tree and shrub which grew there in great profusion. Down below, where the trees were thickest, a clear stream gushed between the rocks. After they had advanced a few paces in a somewhat northerly direction, the ravine broadened into a little flat-bottomed valley and the stream widened out to form a pool. Gaily painted and carved pavilions rose from the slopes on either side, their lower halves concealed amidst the trees, their tops reaching into the blue. In the midst of the prospect below them was a handsome bridge: In a green ravine A jade stream sped. A stair of stone Plunged to the brink. Where the water widened To a placid pool, A marble baluster Ran round about. A marble bridge crossed it With triple span, And a marble lion’s maw Crowned each of the arches. Over the centre of the bridge there was a little pavilion, which Jia Zheng and the others entered and sat down in. ‘Well, gentlemen!’ said Jia Zheng. ‘What are we going to call it?’ ‘Ou-yang Xiu in his Pavilion of the Old Drunkard speaks of “a pavilion poised above the water”,’ said one of them. ‘ What about “Poised Pavilion”?’ ‘“Poised Pavilion” is good,’ said Jia Zheng, ‘but this pavilion was put here in order to dominate the water it stands over, and I think there ought to be some reference to water in its name. I seem to recollect that in that same essay you mention Ou-yang Xiu speaks of the water “gushing between twin peaks ”. Could we not use the word “gushing” in some way ?’ ‘Yes, yes!’ said one of the literary gentlemen. ‘ “Gushing Jade” would do splendidly.’ Jia Zheng fondled his beard meditatively, then turned to Bao-yu and asked him for his suggestion. ‘I agreed with what you said just now, Father,’ said Bao-yu, ‘but on second thoughts it seems to me that though it may have been all right for Ou-yang Xiu to use the word “gushing” in describing the source of the river Rang, it doesn’t really suit the water round this pavilion. Then again, as this is a Separate Residence specially designed for the reception of a royal personage, it seems to me that something rather formal is called for, and that an expression taken from the Drunkard’s Pavilion might seem a bit improper. I think we should try to find a rather more imaginative, less obvious sort of name.’ ‘I hope you gentlemen are all taking this in!’ said Jia Zheng sarcastically, ‘You will observe that when we suggest something original we are recommended to prefer the old to the new, but that when we do make use of an old text we are “improper” and “unimaginative” ! – Well, carry on then! Let’s have your suggestion!’ ‘I think “Drenched Blossoms” would be more original and more tasteful than “Gushing Jade”.’ Jia Zheng stroked his beard and nodded silently. The literary gentlemen could see that he was pleased and hastened to commend Bao-yu’s remarkable ability. ‘That’s the two words for the framed board on top,’ said Jia Zheng. ‘Not a very difficult task. But what about the seven-word lines for the sides?’ Bao-yu glanced quickly round, seeking inspiration from the scene, and presently came up with the following couplet: ‘Three pole-thrust lengths of bankside willows green, One fragrant breath of bankside flowers sweet.’ Jia Zheng nodded and a barely perceptible smile played over his features. The literary gentlemen redoubled their praises."
一時女眷散後，王夫人因問鳳姐：「你今兒怎麼樣？」鳳姐兒道：「太太只管請回去，我須得先理出一個頭緒來，纔回去得呢。」王夫人聽說，便先同邢夫人等回去。不在話下。,"After the female family members dispersed for a while, Madam Wang asked Sister Feng, ""How are you today?"" Sister Feng said, ""Madam, please go back. I have to figure out a clue before I can go back."" Madam Wang heard that, Then I went back with Madam Xing first. Not a problem.","After a time, the lady relatives dispersed, and madame Wang seized the opportunity to inquire of lady Feng, “What do you purpose doing to-day?” “You had better, please madame, go back,” urged lady Feng, “for I must first of all find out some clue before I can go home.” Madame Wang, upon hearing these words, returned to her quarters, in advance, in company with madame Hsing, where we will leave them. Lady Feng meanwhile came into a colonnade, which enclosed a suite of three apartments, and taking a seat, she gave way to reflection. “The first consideration,”","Presently, when the visiting ladies had dispersed, Lady Wang asked Xi-feng what her plans were for the rest of the day. ‘Please go on without me, Aunt,’ said Xi-feng. ‘Before I go back myself I must first try to sort out exactly what this job is going to entail.’ Lady Wang accordingly left without more delay in the company of Lady Xing, and the two ladies returned to the Rong-guo mansion, where we must now leave them. Alone at last, Xi-feng wandered into a sort of penthouse building where she sat down and tried to formulate the task that lay ahead. Five major abuses, long habitual in the Ning-guo establishment, presented themselves to her mind as being specially in need of attention, viz: 1. Because it was so large and so motley an establishment, things were always getting lost. 2."
黛玉一旁盥手，冷笑道：「也不知是真丟了，也不知是給了人鑲什麼戴去了！」寶玉不答，因鏡檯兩邊俱是妝奩等物，順手拿起來賞玩，不覺又順手拈了胭脂，意欲要往口邊送，因又怕史湘雲說。正猶豫間，湘雲果在身後看見，一手掠著辮子，便伸手來「拍」的一下，從手中將胭脂打落，說道：「這不長進的毛病兒，多早晚纔改過！」,"Daiyu washed her hands and sneered, ""I don't know if I really lost it, or if I put something on it!"" Baoyu didn't answer, because there were makeup and other things on both sides of the mirror, so she picked it up to enjoy it without realizing it. He picked up the rouge and wanted to give it to his mouth, because he was afraid that Shi Xiangyun would say it. While hesitating, Xiang Yunguo saw behind him, swept the braid with one hand, reached out and ""patted"" the rouge from his hand, and said, ""This problem of not growing, how long does it take to correct it!""","“One can neither tell whether it has been really lost,” Tai-yue, who stood by, interposed, smiling the while sarcastically; “nor could one say whether it hasn’t been given away to some one to be mounted in some trinket or other and worn!” Pao-yue made no reply; but set to work, seeing that the two sides of the dressing table were all full of toilet boxes and other such articles, taking up those that came under his hand and examining them. Grasping unawares a box of cosmetic, which was within his reach, he would have liked to have brought it to his lips, but he feared again lest Hsiang-yuen should chide him. While he was hesitating whether to do so or not, Hsiang-yuen, from behind, stretched forth her arm and gave him a smack, which sent the cosmetic flying from his hand, as she cried out: “You good-for-nothing! when will you mend those weaknesses of yours!”","‘Who knows whether or not he really lost it?’ said Dai-yu scoffingly. ‘For all we know he may have given it to someone to have remounted as a keepsake!’ Bao-yu made no comment, but sat fiddling with the toilet articles that crowded the dressing-table on either side of the mirror. He picked up a pot of rouge, almost without realizing what he was doing, and sat with it poised in his hand, wanting to put it to his lips for a little taste, but afraid Xiang-yun would rebuke him. While he hesitated, Xiang-yun leaned forward from where she was sitting and administered a sharp slap to his hand, causing the rouge-pot to fall from it on to the dressing-table. ‘Nathty habit!’ she said. ‘It’s time you gave it up!’ The words were scarcely out of her mouth when Aroma entered."
寶玉見是一個僊姑，喜的忙來作揖問道：「神僊姐姐不知從那裏來，如今要往那裏去？也不知這是何處，望乞攜帶攜帶。」那僊姑笑道：「吾居離恨天之上，灌愁海之中，乃放春山遣香洞太虛幻境警幻僊姑是也：司人間之風情月債，掌塵世之女怨男癡。因近來風流冤孽，纏綿於此處，是以前來訪察機會，佈散相思。今忽與爾相逢，亦非偶然。此離吾境不遠，別無他物，僅有自採僊茗一盞，親釀美酒一瓮，素練魔舞歌姬數人，新填《紅樓夢》僊曲十二支，試隨吾一遊否？」寶玉聽說，便忘了秦氏在何處，竟隨了僊姑，至一所在，有石牌橫建，上書「太虛幻境」四個大字，兩邊一副對聯，乃是：「假作真時真亦假，無為有處有還無。」,"Seeing that it was an immortal girl, Baoyu hurriedly greeted her and asked, ""I don't know where the immortal sister came from, but where is she going now? I don't know where it is, so I want to carry it with me."" The immortal girl smiled and said, ""I Living above the sky of renunciation and hatred, and in the sea of sorrow, I let Chunshan send Fragrant Cave to the illusory realm to police the fantasy fairy. She is also a woman who is responsible for the monthly debts of the human world, and the woman who handles the world and blames the man for the madness. Here, it was an opportunity to visit and spread lovesickness in the past. It is not accidental to meet you now. This is not far from my realm, there is nothing else, only a cup of self-picked fairy tea and a urn of fine wine made by myself. , there are several people who have practiced magic dance, and have newly written twelve fairy tunes of ""Dream of Red Mansions"", can you try to travel with me?"" When Baoyu heard that, she forgot where the Qin family was, and actually followed the fairy. The stone plaque was built horizontally, with four characters inscribed on it, ""Great Imaginary Realm"", and a couplet on both sides, which is: ""When the false is true, the true is false, and there is something inactive and there is nothing.""","Pao-yue, upon realising that she was a fairy, was much elated; and with eagerness advanced and made a bow. “My divine sister,” he ventured, as he put on a smile. “I don’t know whence you come, and whither you are going. Nor have I any idea what this place is, but I make bold to entreat that you would take my hand and lead me on.” “My abode,” replied the Fairy, “is above the Heavens of Divested Animosities, and in the ocean of Discharged Sorrows. I’m the Fairy of Monitory Vision, of the cave of Drooping Fragrance, in the mount of Emitted Spring, within the confines of the Great Void. I preside over the voluptuous affections and sensual debts among the mortal race, and supervise in the dusty world, the envies of women and the lusts of man. It’s because I’ve recently come to hear that the retribution for voluptuousness extends up to this place, that I betake myself here in order to find suitable opportunities of disseminating mutual affections. My encounter with you now is also not a matter of accident! This spot is not distant from my confines. I have nothing much there besides a cup of the tender buds of tea plucked by my own hands, and a pitcher of luscious wine, fermented by me as well as several spritelike singing and dancing maidens of great proficiency, and twelve ballads of spiritual song, recently completed, on the Dream of the Red Chamber; but won’t you come along with me for a stroll?” Pao-yue, at this proposal, felt elated to such an extraordinary degree that he could skip from joy, and there and then discarding from his mind all idea of where Mrs. Ch’in was, he readily followed the Fairy. They reached some spot, where there was a stone tablet, put up in a horizontal position, on which were visible the four large characters: “The confines of the Great Void,” on either side of which was one of a pair of scrolls, with the two antithetical sentences: When falsehood stands for truth, truth likewise becomes false; When naught be made to aught , aught changes into naught!","Observing delightedly that the lady was a fairy, Bao-yu hurried forward and saluted her with a smile. ‘Madam Fairy, I don’t know where you have come from or where you are going to, but as I am quite lost in this place, will you please take me with you and be my guide ?’ ‘I am the fairy Disenchantment,’ the fairy woman replied. ‘I live beyond the Realm of Separation, in the Sea of Sadness. There is a Mountain of Spring Awakening which rises from the midst of that sea, and on that mountain is the Paradise of the Full-blown Flower, and in that paradise is the Land of Illusion, which is my home. My business is with the romantic passions, love-debts, girlish heartbreaks and male philander-ings of your dust-stained, human world. The reason I have come here today is that recently there has been a heavy concentration of love-karma in this area, and I hope to be able to find an opportunity of distributing a quantity of amorous thoughts by implanting them in the appropriate breasts. My meeting you here today is no accident but a part of the same project. ‘This place where we are now is not so very far from my home. I have not much to offer you, but would you like to come back with me and let me try to entertain you ? I have some fairy tea, which I picked myself. You could have a cup of that. And I have a few jars of choice new wine of my own brewing. I have also been rehearsing a fairy choir and a troupe of fairy dancers in a twelve-part suite which I recently composed called “A Dream of Golden Days”. I could get them to perform it for you. What do you think?’ Bao-yu was so excited by this invitation that he quite forgot to wonder what had become of Qin-shi in his eagerness to accompany the fairy. As he followed her, a big stone archway suddenly loomed up in front of them on which THE LAND OF ILLUSION was written in large characters. A couplet in smaller characters was inscribed on either side of the arch: Chapter 1 Truth becomes fiction when the fiction’s true; Real becomes not-real when the unreal’s real."
話說是日賈敬的壽辰，賈珍先將上等可喫的東西、稀奇些的菓品，裝了十六大捧盒，著賈蓉帶領家下人等與賈敬送去，向賈蓉說道：「你留神看太爺喜歡不喜歡，你就行了禮來。你說：『我父親遵太爺的話未敢來，在家裏率領合家都朝上行了禮了。』」賈蓉聽罷，即率領家人去了。,"It was said that it was the birthday of Jia Jing, Jia Zhen first put the high-quality edible things and rare fruits into a box of 16, and Jia Rong led the family and the others to send them to Jia Jing, and said to Jia Rong: ""You pay attention to see if the grandfather likes it or not, then you just do the salute. You said, 'My father did not dare to come according to the words of the grandfather, and he led the family to bow at home.'"" Jia Rong listened, and led her family to go. .","We will now explain, in continuation of our story, that on the day of Chia Ching’s birthday, Chia Chen began by getting ready luscious delicacies and rare fruits, which he packed in sixteen spacious present boxes, and bade Chia Jung take them, along with the servants belonging to the household, over to Chia Ching. Turning round towards Chia Jung: “Mind,” he said, “that you observe whether your grandfather be agreeable or not, before you set to work and pay your obeisance! ‘My father,’ tell him, ‘has complied with your directions, venerable senior, and not presumed to come over; but he has at home ushered the whole company of the members of the family (into your apartments), where they all paid their homage facing the side of honour.’“ After Chia Jung had listened to these injunctions, he speedily led off the family domestics, and took his departure.","And Jia Rut conceives an illicit passion for his attractive cousin Jia Jing’s birthday had now arrived. Cousin Zhen packed sixteen lacquer gift-boxes with the rarest and choicest delicacies and instructed Jia Rong to take a number of domestics with him and deliver them to Jia Jing. He was to observe carefully whether or not his grandfather was pleased, and having made his kotow, was to deliver the following message: ‘Because of your request, Father has not ventured to visit you himself. Instead he will place himself at the head of the entire family and lead them in prostrating themselves in your direction.’ Having received his father’s instructions, Jia Rong mustered his band of servants and set out."
於是鳳姐兒帶領跟來的婆子丫頭並寧府的媳婦婆子們，從裏頭繞進園子的便門來。但只見：黃花滿地，白柳橫坡。小橋通若耶之溪，曲徑接天台之路。石中清流激湍，籬落飄香；樹頭紅葉翩翻，疏林如畫。西風乍緊，初罷鶯啼；暖日當暄，又添蛩語。遙望東南，建幾處依山之榭；縱觀西北，結三間臨水之軒。笙簧盈耳，別有幽情；羅綺穿林，倍添韻緻。,"So Feng Jie'er led the mother-in-law girl and the daughter-in-law of Ning's house, and went around the garden's toilet door from the inside. But I saw: yellow flowers all over the ground, white willows across the slope. The small bridge leads to Ruoye's Creek, and the winding path connects to the roof road. The clear stream in the stone is turbulent, and the hedges fall fragrant; When the west wind is tight at first, the warbler sings at first; when the warm sun is warm, there is another cricket. Looking at the southeast, there are several pavilions built on the mountain; looking at the northwest, there are three houses facing the water. Sheng spring is full of ears, and there is no love; Luo Qi walks through the forest, adding charm.","I shall , of course,” she rejoined, “come often to see you;” and forthwith leading off the matrons and married women, who had come over with her, as well as the women and matrons of the Ning mansion, she passed through the inner part of the house, and entered, by a circuitous way, the side gate of the park, when she perceived: yellow flowers covering the ground; white willows flanking the slopes; diminutive bridges spanning streams, resembling the Jo Yeh; zigzag pathways (looking as if ) they led to the steps of Heaven; limpid springs dripping from among the rocks; flowers hanging from hedges emitting their fragrance, as they were flapped by the winds; red leaves on the tree tops swaying to and fro; groves picture-like, half stripped of foliage; the western breeze coming with sudden gusts, and the wail of the oriole still audible; the warm sun shining with genial rays, and the cicada also adding its chirp: structures, visible to the gaze at a distance in the South-east, soaring high on various sites and resting against the hills; three halls, visible near by on the North-west, stretching in one connected line, on the bank of the stream; strains of music filling the pavilion, imbued with an unwonted subtle charm; and maidens in fine attire penetrating the groves, lending an additional spell to the scene.","Then, followed by the women who had accompanied her from the Rong mansion and a number of female domestics belonging to the Ning household, she made her way round to one of the side gates leading into the gardens. Golden chrysanthemums covered the open spaces; Silvery willow-trees bordered the water’s margins. The little bridge arched its span over a storied stream; The winding path made its way into a fairy hill. Crystal rills tinkled amidst the rocks. A quickset hedge recalled preautumnal fragrances. Crimson leaves fluttered upon the boughs. A wintry copse described calligraphic traceries. In the cold wind’s more insistent blast The oriole’s cry could still be heard. In the late sun’s more infrequent warmth The cricket’s chirp a while revived. At the far south-east end Pavilions nestled in artificial mountains. On the near north-west side Verandahs brooded on circumjacent waters. Music of little organs playing in the summer-house Increased the melancholy in the air. Glimpses of women’s dresses flitting through the little wood"
堪堪又是一載的光陰。誰知女學生之母賈氏夫人一疾而終。女學生侍湯奉藥，守喪盡哀，遂又將辭館別圖。林如海意欲令女守制讀書，故又將他留下。近因女學生哀痛過傷，本自怯弱多病的，觸犯舊症，遂連日不曾上學。雨村閑居無聊，每當風日晴和，飯後便出來閑步。,"Kankan is another set of time. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Jia, the mother of the female student, died suddenly. The female student served soup and medicine, mourned in mourning, and then resigned from the library. Lin Ruhai wanted the female guard to study, so he kept him again. Recently, because of the female student's grief and injury, she was timid and sickly, and violated the old illness, so she did not go to school for several days. Amamura is bored living alone, and whenever the weather is fine, he will go out for a walk after dinner.","In a twinkle, another year and more slipped by, and when least expected, the mother of his ward, nee Chia, was carried away after a short illness. His pupil (during her mother’s sickness) was dutiful in her attendance, and prepared the medicines for her use. (And after her death,) she went into the deepest mourning prescribed by the rites, and gave way to such excess of grief that, naturally delicate as she was, her old complaint, on this account, broke out anew. Being unable for a considerable time to prosecute her studies, Yue-ts’un lived at leisure and had no duties to attend to. Whenever therefore the wind was genial and the sun mild, he was wont to stroll at random, after he had done with his meals.","Yu-cun’s little pupil helped with the nursing throughout her mother’s last illness and mourned for her bitterly after her death. The extra strain this placed on her always delicate constitution brought on a severe attack of a recurrent sickness, and for a long time she was unable to pursue her lessons. Bored by his enforced idleness, Yu-cun took to going for walks as soon as lunch was over whenever the weather was warm and sunny."
鳳姐兒道：「我說他不是十分支持不住，今日這樣的日子，再也不肯不扎掙著上來。」尤氏道：「你是初三日在這裏見他的，他強扎掙了半天，也是因你們娘兒兩個好的上頭，他纔戀戀的捨不得去。」鳳姐兒聽了，眼圈兒紅了半天，半日方說道：「真是『天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福』。這個年紀，倘或就因這個病上怎麼樣了，人還活著有甚麼趣兒！」,"Sister Feng said: ""I said that he is not very unsupportive. On a day like today, he will never try to come up again."" You said, ""You saw him here on the third day of the new year, and he struggled hard. After a long time, it was also because of your two good bosses that he was reluctant to go."" When Sister Feng heard this, her eyes were red for a long time, and she said, ""It's really, 'The sky is unpredictable, and people have the fate of the day. Good fortune”. At this age, if something happens to this disease, what’s the fun of being alive!”","“I maintain,” remarked lady Feng, “that, were she not quite unfit to stand the exertion, would she in fact, on a day like this, be unwilling to strain every nerve and come round.” “You saw her,” observed Mrs. Yu, “on the third in here; how that she bore up with a violent effort for ever so long, but it was all because of the friendship that exists between you two, that she still longed for your society, and couldn’t brook the idea of tearing herself away.” When lady Feng heard these words, her eyes got quite red, and after a time she at length exclaimed: “In the Heavens of a sudden come wind and rain; while with man, in a day and in a night, woe and weal survene! But with her tender years, if for a complaint like this she were to run any risk, what pleasure is there for any human being to be born and to sojourn in the world?”","‘There!’ said Xi-feng. ‘I thought it must be something quite serious to keep her away, especially on a day like this. I know she would have forced herself to come if she could have done.’ ‘You remember you saw her here on the third,’ said You-shi. ‘She had a terrible struggle to keep going on that occasion. It was only because the two of you have always been so close and she didn’t want to miss you that she made the effort.’ Xi-feng’s eyes became moist and for a moment she was too overcome to speak. ‘I know “the weather and human life are both unpredictable”,’ she said at last, ‘ but she’s only a child still. If anything should happen to her as a result of this illness, I think all the fun would go out of life!’"
寶玉正眼瞅著那《海棠春睡圖》並那秦太虛寫的「嫩寒鎖夢因春冷，芳氣襲人是酒香」的對聯，不覺想起在這裏睡晌午覺夢到「太虛幻境」的事來。正自出神，聽得秦氏說了這些話，如萬箭攢心，那眼淚不知不覺就流下來了。,"Baoyu was staring at the couplet of ""Begonia Sleeping in Spring"" and the couplet written by Qin Taixu, ""Dream of tender cold locks is due to the cold spring, and the fragrance is the fragrance of wine."" Illusory Realm"". When I was in a trance, I heard Qin shi say these words, and my heart was filled with arrows, and the tears flowed down unconsciously.","Pao-yue kept, while (she spoke,) his eyes fixed intently upon a picture on the opposite side, representing some begonias drooping in the spring time, and upon a pair of scrolls, with this inscription written by Ch’in Tai-hsue: A gentle chill doth circumscribe the dreaming man because the spring is cold! The fragrant whiff which wafts itself into man’s nose, is the perfume of wine! And he could not help recalling to mind his experiences at the time when he had fallen asleep in this apartment, and had, in his dream, visited the confines of the Great Void. He was just plunged in a state of abstraction, when he heard Mrs. Ch’in give utterance to these sentiments, which pierced his heart as if they were ten thousand arrows, (with the result that) tears unwittingly trickled from his eyes.","Bao-yu had been studying the ‘Spring Slumber’ painting on Qin-shi’s wall all this time and re-reading the couplet by Qin Guan on the scrolls at each side of it: The coldness of spring has imprisoned the soft buds in a wintry dream; The fragrance of wine has intoxicated the beholder with imagined flower-scents. As he did so, the memory returned of that earlier afternoon when he had slept in that very same room and dreamed about the Land of Illusion. He was musing on the contents of that dream when he suddenly became aware of the words that Qin-shi was saying. They pierced his heart like the points of a thousand arrows. Great tears welled up in his eyes and rolled down his cheeks."
作者自云：因曾歷過一番夢幻，之後故將真事隱去，而借「通靈」之說，撰此《石頭記》一書也，故曰「甄士隱」云云。,"The author said from himself: Because I once experienced a dream, I concealed the real thing later, and I used the theory of ""psychic"" to write this book ""The Story of the Stone"", so it is called ""Zhen Shiyin"" and so on.","Subsequent to the visions of a dream which he had, on some previous occasion, experienced, the writer personally relates, he designedly concealed the true circumstances, and borrowed the attributes of perception and spirituality to relate this story of the Record of the Stone. With this purpose, he made use of such designations as Chen Shih-yin (truth under the garb of fiction) and the like.",
寶玉笑道：「可是姐姐們都過來了，怎麼不見？」邢夫人道：「他們坐了一會子，都往後頭不知那屋裏去了。」寶玉道：「大娘方纔說有話說，不知是什麼話？」邢夫人笑道：「那裏有什麼話，不過是叫你等著，同你姊妹們喫了飯去。還有一個好玩的東西給你帶回去玩。」娘兒兩個說話，不覺早又晚飯時節。調開桌椅，羅列杯盤，母女姊妹們喫畢了飯。寶玉去辭賈赦，同姊妹們一同回家，見過賈母、王夫人等，各自回房安息。不在話下。,"Baoyu smiled and said, ""But the sisters have all come, why didn't you see them?"" Madam Xing said, ""They sat for a while, and they all went back to the house."" Baoyu said, ""The aunt just said something, I don't know. What are you talking about?"" Madam Xing smiled and said, ""What are you talking about there, I just told you to wait and have dinner with your sisters. There is also a fun thing for you to bring back to play."" , I don't think it's early and dinner time. The tables and chairs were set aside, the cups and plates were arranged, and the mother, daughter and sisters finished their meal. Baoyu went to bid Jia She farewell, and went home with the sisters. After seeing Mother Jia and Madam Wang, they went back to their rooms to rest in peace. Not a problem.","“If it be really the case that all my cousins have come over,” Pao-yue ventured with a smirk, “how is it that I don’t see them?” “After sitting here for a while,” madame Hsing explained, “they all went at the back; but in what rooms they have gone, I don’t know.” “My senior aunt, you said you had something to tell me, Pao-yue observed; what’s it, I wonder?” “What can there possibly be to tell you?” madame Hsing laughed; “it was simply to make you wait and have your repast with the young ladies and then go; but there’s also a fine plaything that I’ll give you to take back to amuse yourself with.” These two, the aunt and her nephew, were going on with their colloquy when, much to their surprise, it was time for dinner and the young ladies were all invited to come. The tables and chairs were put in their places, and the cups and plates were arranged in proper order; and, after the mother, her daughter and the cousins had finished their meal, Pao-yue bade good-bye to Chia She and returned home in company with all the young ladies; and when they had said good-night to dowager lady Chia, madame Wang and the others, they each went back into their rooms and retired to rest; where we shall leave them without any further comment and speak of Chia Yuen’s visit to the mansion. As soon as he saw Chia Lien, he inquired what business it was that had turned up, and Chia Lien consequently explained: “The other day something did actually present itself, but as it happened that your aunt had again and again entreated me, I gave it to Chia Ch’in; as she promised me that there would be by and by in the garden several other spots where flowers and trees would","‘Where are the girls, then?’ Bao-yu asked after they had gone, ‘/haven’t seen them.’ ‘Oh, I don’t know,’ said Lady Xing nonchalantly. ‘They only sat here for a few moments, then they went round to the back. They’re round the back somewhere or other.’ ‘You said there was something you wanted to talk to me about, Aunt. What was it you wanted to tell me?’ ‘Oh, nothing at all!’ said Lady Xing gaily. ‘I only said that because I wanted you to stay and have dinner here with me and the girls. And I’ve got something nice for you to take back with you afterwards.’ Bao-yu and his aunt chatted away, and before long it was time for dinner and the three girls were called in. A table and chairs were arranged, the table was laid, and Lady Xing, her daughter Ying-chun, her two nieces and her nephew sat down to their meal. When it was over, Bao-yu went in to take his leave of Jia She, after which he and the girls returned to their own side of the mansion. There they first went in to see Grandmother Jia and Lady Wang and then returned to their own apartments for the night. So much for Bao-yu and the girls."
一時周瑞家的傳了一桌客飯來，擺在東邊屋內，過來帶了劉姥姥和板兒過去喫飯。鳳姐說道：「周姐姐，好生讓著些兒，我不能陪了。」於是過東邊房裏來。又叫過周瑞家的去，問他纔回了太太，說了些什麼？周瑞家的道：「太太說，他們家原不是一家子，不過因出一姓，當年又與太老爺在一處作官，偶然連了宗的。這幾年來也不大走動。當時他們來一遭，卻也沒空了他們。今兒既來了瞧瞧我們，是他的好意思，也不可簡慢了他。便是有什麼說的，叫奶奶裁度著就是了。」鳳姐聽了說道：「我說呢，既是一家子，我如何連影兒也不知道。」,"At one time, Zhou Rui's family passed down a table of guest meals, which was placed in the east room, and brought Grandma Liu and Ban'er over to eat. Sister Feng said, ""Sister Zhou, I can't accompany you."" So she came to the east room. I called Zhou Rui's house again and asked him what he said before returning to his wife. Zhou Rui's family said: ""The wife said that their family was not a family, but because they had a surname, they were in the same office with the old master, and they accidentally joined the clan. They haven't moved much in the past few years. But he didn’t have time for them. Since he came to see us today, it’s because of his kindness, so he shouldn’t be taken lightly. If you have something to say, just ask grandma to decide.” Sister Feng listened and said: ""I said, since we are a family, how can I not even know Ying'er.""","In a short while Chou Jui’s wife had called for a table of viands for the guests, which was laid in the room on the eastern side, and then came to take goody Liu and Pan Erh over to have their repast. “My dear Mrs. Chou,” enjoined lady Feng, “give them all they want, as I can’t attend to them myself;” which said, they hastily passed over into the room on the eastern side. Lady Feng having again called Mrs. Chou, asked her: “When you first informed madame about them, what did she say?” “Our Lady observed,” replied Chou Jui’s wife, “that they don’t really belong to the same family; that, in former years, their grandfather was an official at the same place as our old master; that hence it came that they joined ancestors; that these few years there hasn’t been much intercourse (between their family and ours); that some years back, whenever they came on a visit, they were never permitted to go empty-handed, and that as their coming on this occasion to see us is also a kind attention on their part, they shouldn’t be slighted. If they’ve anything to say,” (our lady continued), “tell lady Secunda to do the necessary, and that will be right.” “Isn’t it strange!” exclaimed lady Feng, as soon as she had heard the message; “since we are all one family, how is it I’m not familiar even with so much as their shadow?”","Xi-feng gave orders for a meal to be brought in, and Zhou Rui’s wife went out and presently reappeared with a guest’s portion of various choice dishes on a little table, which she set down in the east wing, and to which she then conducted Grannie Liu and Ban-er for their meal. ‘Zhou, dear,’ said Xi-feng, ‘will you keep them company and see that they have enough to eat? I shan’t be able to sit with them myself.’ Then calling her aside for a moment she asked, ‘What did Her Ladyship say when you went to report about them just now?’ ‘She said they don’t really belong to the family but were adopted into the clan years ago when your grandfather and theirs were working in the same office. She said they haven’t been round much of late years, but in the old days when they used to visit us we never sent them back empty-handed. She said it was nice of them to come and see us today and we should be careful to treat them considerately. And she said if they appear to want anything, she would leave it to you to decide what we should do for them.’ ‘No wonder!’ exclaimed Xi-feng when she had heard this account. ‘I couldn’t understand how they could be really related to us if I had never even heard of them.’"
此時自己回想當初在大荒山中，青埂峰下，那等淒涼寂寞；若不虧癩僧、跛道二人攜來到此，又安能得見這般世面。本欲作一篇《燈月賦》、《省親頌》，以志今日之事，但又恐入了別書的俗套。按此時之景，即作一賦一贊，也不能形容得盡其妙；即不作賦贊，其豪華富麗，觀者諸公亦可想而知矣。所以倒是省了這工夫紙墨，且說正經的為是。,"At this time, I recalled how desolate and lonely I was in the Great Desolate Mountains, under the Qinggeng Peak; if I hadn't been brought here by the Leap Monk and the Lame Dao, I would have been able to see such a world. Originally, I wanted to write a poem called ""Ode to the Moon"" and ""Ode to My Family"" to record today's events, but I was afraid that I would fall into the clichés of other books. According to the scene at this time, even if it is praised and praised, it cannot be described as wonderful; even if it is not praised, it is luxurious and rich, and the viewers can also imagine it. So it saves the time and paper and ink, and the serious thing is.","But it would be impossible to express adequately the perfect harmony in the aspect of this scene, and the grandeur of affluence and splendour. The imperial consort of the Chia family, we must now observe, upon catching sight, from the interior of her chair, of the picture presented within as well as without the confines of this garden, shook her head and heaved a sigh. “ What lavish extravagance! What excessive waste!”","There were lanterns everywhere, and soft strains of music. She seemed to be entering a little world wholly dedicated to the pursuit of ease and luxury and delight. Looking at it from the depths of her palanquin she shook her head a little sadly and sighed: ‘Oh dear, this is all so extravagant!’"
鳳姐且不發放這人，卻先問：「王興媳婦作什麼？」王興媳婦巴不得先問他完了事，連忙進去說：「領牌取線，打車轎網絡。」說著，將個帖兒遞上去。鳳姐命彩明唸道：「大轎兩頂，小轎四頂，車四輛，共用大小絡子若干根，用珠兒線若干斤。」鳳姐聽了，數目相合，便命彩明登記，取榮國府對牌擲下。王興家的去了。,"Sister Feng did not release this person, but first asked, ""What is Wang Xing's wife doing?"" Wang Xing's wife was eager to ask him to finish the matter first, so she hurriedly went in and said, ""Pick up the license to get the line, and take a taxi and sedan network."" Post it up. Sister Feng ordered Caiming to read: ""Two large sedan chairs, four small sedan chairs, and four cars, sharing a number of large and small cords, using a few kilograms of pearl thread."" Sister Feng heard the numbers and ordered Caiming to register, Take Rong Guofu and throw it down. Wang Xing's family went.","Wang Hsing’s wife drew near. “I’ve come,” she explained, “to get an order, so as to obtain some thread to make tassels for the carriages and chairs.” Saying this, she produced the permit and handed it up, whereupon lady Feng directed Ts’ai Ming to read the contents aloud. “For two large, sedan chairs,” he said, “four small sedan chairs and four carriages, are needed in all so many large and small tassels, each tassel requiring so many catties of beads and thread.” Lady Feng finding, after she had heard what was read, that the numbers (and quantities) corresponded, forthwith bade Ts’ai Ming make the proper entry; and when the order from the Jung Kuo mansion had been fetched, and thrown at her, Wang Hsing’s wife took her departure.","‘Yes, what is it ?’ she asked, turning away from the offender but giving her no indication that she might go. Wang Xing’s wife approached and said that she wanted a tally authorizing the purchase of silk cord to be made up into carriage trimmings for the funeral. She handed Xi-feng a slip of paper on which the order was written. It specified the number of network trimmings that would be required for two large sedans, four small sedans, and four carriages, and the number of pounds of silk cord that would be required for that amount of network. Xi-feng made Sunshine read it out to her, and having satisfied herself that the figures were correct, told him to enter them in his book and to issue Wang Xing’s wife with one of the Rong-guo tallies, whereupon the latter hurried off to complete her mission."
見了賈赦，不過是偶感些風寒，先述了賈母問的話，然後自己請了安。賈赦先站起來回了賈母話，次後便喚人來：「帶哥兒進去太太屋裏坐著。」寶玉退出，來至後面，進入上房。邢夫人見了他來，先倒站了起來，請過賈母安，寶玉方請安。邢夫人拉他上炕坐了，方問別人好，又命人倒茶來。一鐘茶未喫完，只見那賈琮來問寶玉好。邢夫人道：「那裏找活猴兒去！你那奶媽子死絕了，也不收拾收拾你，弄的黑眉烏嘴的，那裏象大家子唸書的孩子！」,"When I met Jia She, I just felt a little bit cold. I first said what Mother Jia asked, and then I said goodbye to myself. Jia She first stood up and replied to Jia's mother's words, and then called someone to come: ""Take my brother into my wife's room and sit."" Baoyu exited, came to the back, and entered the upper room. When Mrs. Xing saw him, she stood up first, and asked Jia Mu to be safe, and Baoyu Fang to be safe. Mrs. Xing took him to sit on the kang, Fang asked others how he was, and ordered someone to pour tea. Before the tea was finished, Jia Cong came to say hello to Baoyu. Madam Xing said, ""Go look for a live monkey there! Your nanny is dead, and she doesn't clean up with you. She has black eyebrows and a black mouth. It's like a kid from everyone studying there!""","With this remark still on his lips, he laid hold of the saddle and mounted his horse; and, followed by the whole bevy of pages, he crossed over to Chia She’s on this side; where having discovered that Chia She had nothing more the matter with him than a chill which he had suddenly contracted, he commenced by delivering dowager lady Chia’s message, and next paid his own obeisance. Chia She, at first, stood up and made suitable answer to her venerable ladyship’s inquiries, and then calling a servant, “Take the gentleman,” he said, “into my lady’s apartment to sit down.” Pao-yue withdrew out of the room, and came by the back to the upper apartment; and as soon as madame Hsing caught sight of him, she, before everything else, rose to her feet and asked after old lady Chia’s health; after which, Pao-yue made his own salutation, and madame Hsing drew him on to the stove-couch, where she induced him to take a seat, and eventually inquired after the other inmates, and also gave orders to serve the tea. But scarcely had they had tea, before they perceived Chia Tsung come in to pay his respects to Pao-yue. “Where could one find such a living monkey as this!” madame Hsing remarked; “is that nurse of yours dead and gone that she doesn’t even keep you clean and tidy, and that she lets you go about with those eyebrows of yours so black and that mouth so filthy! you scarcely look like the child of a great family of scholars.”","Bao-yu found that his uncle was suffering from nothing more serious than a chill. He delivered his grandmother’s message first and then asked after his uncle on his own behalf. Jia She stood up to hear what his mother had to say, and when Bao-yu had finished, ordered a servant to take him to his Aunt Xing’s room. Bao-yu withdrew and followed the servant through the back and across the courtyard to the main reception room. Seeing him enter, Lady Xing rose to her feet to ask after Grandmother Jia, then sat down again to be asked after in turn by Bao-yu. Then she drew him up to sit beside her on the kang and asked him about the others, at the same time giving orders for tea to be served. While they were still sipping the tea, little Jia Cong, the son of one of Jia She’s concubines, came in to say ‘hullo’ to his Cousin Bao. ‘Where did this little ragamuffin come from?’ Lady Xing scolded. ‘I don’t know what that Nannie of yours can be thinking of to let you get in such a state! I declare, your face is as black as a crow! No one would ever think to look at you that you were an educated little boy and came from a good family!’"
黛玉磕著瓜子兒，只抿著嘴笑。可巧黛玉的小丫鬟雪雁走來與黛玉送小手爐，黛玉因含笑問他：「誰叫你送來的？難為他費心，那裏就凍死了我！」雪雁道：「紫鵑姐姐怕姑娘冷，使我送來的。」黛玉一面接了，抱在懷中，笑道：「也虧你倒聽他的話。我平日和你說的，全當耳旁風；怎麼他說了你就依他，比聖旨還遵些！」寶玉聽這話，知是黛玉借此奚落他，也無回護之詞，只嘻嘻的笑兩陣罷了。寶釵素知黛玉是如此慣了的，也不去睬他。薛姨媽因道：「你素日身子弱，禁不得冷的，他們記掛著你倒不好？」黛玉笑道：「姨媽不知道。幸虧是姨媽這裏，倘或在別人家，人家豈不要惱？就看的人家連個手爐也沒有，巴巴的從家裏送個來。不說丫鬟們太小心過了，還只當我素日是這等輕狂慣了呢。」薛姨媽道：「你是個多心的，有這想頭，我就沒這心了。」,"Daiyu slapped the sunflower seeds and only smiled. Coincidentally, Daiyu's little maid, Xueyan, came over to give Daiyu a small hand stove. Daiyu asked him with a smile, ""Who asked you to bring it? It's hard for him to worry about it, and I was frozen to death there!"" Xueyan said, ""Sister Zijuan. I was afraid that the girl would be cold, so I brought it here."" Daiyu took it, hugged her in her arms, and said with a smile, ""It's your fault for listening to him. What I say to you on weekdays is completely ignored; why did he say you? Just follow him, more than the imperial decree!"" Baoyu heard this, knowing that Daiyu was using this to ridicule him, and she didn't say anything to protect him, she just laughed twice. Baochai knew that Daiyu was so used to it, and did not pay any attention to him. Aunt Xue said, ""You are always weak, so you can't help being cold. It's not good for them to remember you?"" Daiyu smiled and said, ""Auntie doesn't know. Fortunately, it's my aunt here. The people I saw didn't even have a hand stove, so they sent one from home. Not to mention that the maids were too careful, they just thought I was so frivolous."" Aunt Xue said: ""You He is overhearted, and if I think about it, I don't have it anymore.""","Tai-yue was bent upon cracking melon seeds, saying nothing but simply pursing up her lips and smiling, when, strange coincidence, Hsueeh Yen, Tai-yue’s waiting-maid, walked in and handed her mistress a small hand-stove. “Who told you to bring it?” ascertained Tai-yue grinningly. “I’m sorry to have given whoever it is the trouble; I’m obliged to her. But did she ever imagine that I would freeze to death?” “Tzu Chuan was afraid,” replied Hsueeh Yen, “that you would, miss, feel cold, and she asked me to bring it over.” Tai-yue took it over and held it in her lap. “How is it,” she smiled, “that you listen to what she tells you, but that you treat what I say, day after day, as so much wind blowing past your ears! How is it that you at once do what she bids you, with even greater alacrity than you would an imperial edict?” When Pao-yue heard this, he felt sure in his mind that Tai-yue was availing herself of this opportunity to make fun of him, but he made no remark, merely laughing to himself and paying no further notice. Pao Ch’ai, again, knew full well that this habit was a weak point with Tai-yue, so she too did not go out of her way to heed what she said. “You’ve always been delicate and unable to stand the cold,” interposed “aunt” Hsueeh, “and is it not a kind attention on their part to have thought of you?” “You don’t know, aunt, how it really stands,” responded Tai-yue smilingly; “fortunately enough, it was sent to me here at your quarters; for had it been in any one else’s house, wouldn’t it have been a slight upon them? Is it forsooth nice to think that people haven’t so much as a hand-stove, and that one has fussily to be sent over from home? People won’t say that the waiting-maids are too officious, but will imagine that I’m in the habit of behaving in this offensive fashion.” “You’re far too punctilious,” remarked Mrs. Hsueeh, “as to entertain such notions! No such ideas as these crossed my mind just now.”","Dai-yu, who sat cracking melon-seeds between her teeth throughout this homily, smiled ironically. Just at that moment her maid Snowgoose came hurrying in with a little hand-warmer for her. ‘Who told you to bring this?’ Dai-yu asked her. ‘ Very kind of them, I am sure. But I was not actually freezing to death here.’ ‘Nightingale told me to bring it, Miss. She was afraid you might be cold.’ ‘I am glad you are so ready to obey her. Generally when I tell you to do anything it goes in one ear and out the other; yet anything she tells you to do is followed out more promptly than an Imperial Edict!’ Bao-yu knew perfectly well that these words were really intended for him, but made no reply, beyond laughing good-humouredly. Bao-chai, long accustomed to Dai-yu’s peculiar ways, also ignored them. But Aunt Xue protested. ‘You’ve always been rather delicate and you’ve always felt the cold badly. Surely it was nice of them to think of you ?’ ‘You don’t understand, Aunt,’ said Dai-yu. ‘It doesn’t matter here, with you; but some people might be deeply offended at die sight of one of my maids rushing in with a hand-warmer. It’s as though I thought my hosts couldn’t supply one themselves if I needed it. Instead of saying how thoughtful the maid was, they would put it down to my arrogance and lack of breeding.’ ‘You are altogether too sensitive, thinking of things like that,’ said Aunt Xue. ‘Such a thought would never have crossed my mind!’"
一時黛玉進了榮府，下了車。眾嬤嬤引著，便往東轉彎，穿過一個東西的穿堂，向南大廳之後，儀門內大院落，上面五間大正房，兩邊廂房鹿頂耳房鑽山，四通八達，軒昂壯麗，比賈母處不同。黛玉便知這方是正經正內室，一條大甬路，直接出大門的。進入堂屋中，抬頭迎面先看見一個赤金九龍青地大匾，匾上寫著斗大的三個大字，是「榮禧堂」，後有一行小字：「某年月日，書賜榮國公賈源」，又有「萬幾宸翰之寶」。大紫檀雕螭案上，設著三尺來高青綠古銅鼎，懸著待漏隨朝墨龍大畫，一邊是金蜼彞，一邊是玻璃盆。地下兩溜十六張楠木交椅，又有一副對聯，乃烏木聯牌，鑲著鏨銀的字跡，道是：「座上珠璣昭日月，堂前黼黻煥煙霞。」下面一行小字，道是：「同鄉世教弟勛襲東安郡王穆蒔拜手書。」,"For a while, Daiyu entered the Rong Mansion and got out of the car. Guided by the aunts, they turned east and passed through an east-west hall. After the south hall, there was a large courtyard in the Yimen, with five large main rooms on the top, and deer-topped and penthouses on both sides, extending in all directions. Mother is different. Daiyu knew that this was a serious inner room, a big road leading directly out of the gate. Entering the main room, I looked up and saw a large plaque with red gold, nine dragons and green ground. On the plaque was written three big characters of Dou Da, which was ""Rong Xi Tang"", and a line of small characters after it: ""A certain year, month and day, the book bestows Rong Guo Gong. Jia Yuan"", and ""the treasure of thousands of Chen Han"". On the large red sandalwood carving chi case, there is a three-foot-high blue-green bronze tripod, and a large painting of the ink dragon waiting to be leaked is hung. There are sixteen nanmu chairs on the ground floor, and another pair of couplets, which are ebony couplets, inlaid with chisel silver handwriting, saying: ""The sun and the moon are shining on the seat, and the hall is full of haze."" The following line of small characters said yes : ""My fellow countryman, Xun Xun, the king of Dong'an County, worshipped the handwritten letter.""","Tai-yue shortly entered the Jung Mansion, descended from the carriage, and preceded by all the nurses, she at once proceeded towards the east, turned a corner, passed through an Entrance Hall, running east and west, and walked in a southern direction, at the back of the Large Hall. On the inner side of a ceremonial gate, and at the upper end of a spacious court, stood a large main building, with five apartments, flanked on both sides by out-houses (stretching out) like the antlers on the head of deer; side-gates, resembling passages through a hill, establishing a thorough communication all round; (a main building) lofty, majestic, solid and grand, and unlike those in the compound of dowager lady Chia. Tai-yue readily concluded that this at last was the main inner suite of apartments. A raised broad road led in a straight line to the large gate. Upon entering the Hall, and raising her head, she first of all perceived before her a large tablet with blue ground, upon which figured nine dragons of reddish gold. The inscription on this tablet consisted of three characters as large as a peck-measure, and declared that this was the Hall of Glorious Felicity. At the end, was a row of characters of minute size, denoting the year, month and day, upon which His Majesty had been pleased to confer the tablet upon Chia Yuan, Duke of Jung Kuo. Besides this tablet, were numberless costly articles bearing the autograph of the Emperor. On the large black ebony table, engraved with dragons, were placed three antique blue and green bronze tripods, about three feet in height. On the wall hung a large picture representing black dragons, such as were seen in waiting chambers of the Sui dynasty. On one side stood a gold cup of chased work, while on the other, a crystal casket. On the ground were placed, in two rows, sixteen chairs, made of hard-grained cedar. There was also a pair of scrolls consisting of black-wood antithetical tablets, inlaid with the strokes of words in chased gold. Their burden was this: On the platform shine resplendent pearls like sun or moon, And the sheen of the Hall facade gleams like russet sky. Below, was a row of small characters, denoting that the scroll had been written by the hand of Mu Shih, a fellow-countryman and old friend of the family, who, for his meritorious services, had the hereditary title of Prince of Tung Ngan conferred upon him.","the Rong mansion proper and Dai-yu got down from the carriage. There was a raised stone walk running all the way up to the main gate, along which the old nurses now conducted her. Turning right, they led her down a roofed passage-way along the back of a south-facing hall, then through an inner gate into a large courtyard. The big building at the head of the courtyard was connected at each end to galleries running through the length of the side buildings by means of ‘stag’s head’ roofing over the corners. The whole formed an architectural unit of greater sumptuous-ness and magnificence than anything Dai-yu had yet seen that day, from which she concluded that this must be the main inner hall of the whole mansion. High overhead on the wall facing her as she entered the hall was a great blue board framed in gilded dragons, on which was written in large gold characters THE HALL OF EXALTED FELICITY with a column of smaller characters at the side giving a date and the words ‘… written for Our beloved Subject, Jia Yuan, Duke of Rong-guo’, followed by the Emperor’s private seal, a device containing the words ‘kingly cares’ and ‘royal brush’ in archaic seal-script. A long, high table of carved red sandalwood, ornamented with dragons, stood against the wall underneath. In the centre of this was a huge antique bronze ding, fully a yard high, covered with a green patina. On the wall above the ding hung a long vertical scroll with an ink-painting of a dragon emerging from clouds and waves, of the kind often presented to high court officials in token of their office. The ding was flanked on one side by a smaller antique bronze vessel with a pattern of gold inlay and on the other by a crystal bowl. At each side of the table stood a row of eight yellow cedar-wood armchairs with their backs to the wall; and above the chairs hung, one on each side, a pair of vertical ebony boards inlaid with a couplet in characters of gold: (on the right-hand one) May the jewel of learning shine in this house more effulgently than the sun and moon. (on the left-hand one) May the insignia of honour glitter in these halls more brilliantly than the starry sky. This was followed by a colophon in smaller characters: With the Respectful Compliments of your Fellow- Student, Mu Shi, Hereditary Prince of Dong-an."
襲人早知端的，當此時斷不能勸。那寶玉衹是呆呆的站在那裏。黛玉只當他回房去了，便起來開門，只見寶玉還站在那裏。黛玉反不好意思，不好再關，只得抽身上床躺著。寶玉隨進來問道：「凡事都有個原故，說出來，人也不委曲。好好的就惱了，終是什麼原故起的？」林黛玉冷笑道：「問的我倒好，我也不知為什麼原故。我原是給你們取笑的，——拿我比戲子取笑。」寶玉道：「我並沒有比你，我並沒笑，為什麼惱我呢？」黛玉道：「你還要比？你還要笑？你不比不笑，比人比了笑了的還利害呢！」寶玉聽說，無可分辯，不則一聲。,"Those who attack people who know the truth early, can't be persuaded at this time. That Baoyu just stood there blankly. Daiyu got up and opened the door when he went back to the room, only to see Baoyu still standing there. Daiyu was embarrassed, she couldn't close it again, so she had to get out of bed and lie down. Baoyu came in and asked, ""Everything has a reason. If you tell it, people won't give in. If it's good, you'll be annoyed. In the end, what is the reason?"" Lin Daiyu sneered, ""It's good for me to ask, but I don't know the reason. I was making fun of you, - making fun of me as an actor."" Baoyu said, ""I'm not better than you, I didn't laugh, why are you mad at me?"" Daiyu said, ""You're more than you? Do you want to laugh? You're better than not laughing, and it's more beneficial than someone who laughs!"" Baoyu heard that, unable to distinguish, but he didn't say anything.","And though Hsi Jen had, at an early hour, come to know the circumstances, she could not very well at this juncture tender any advice. Pao-yue remained standing in such a vacant mood that Tai-yue imagined that he had gone back; but when she came to open the door she caught sight of Pao-yue still waiting in there; and as Tai-yue did not feel justified to again close the door, Pao-yue consequently followed her in. “Every thing has,” he observed, “a why and a wherefore; which, when spoken out, don’t even give people pain; but you will rush into a rage, and all without any rhyme! but to what really does it owe its rise?” “It’s well enough, after all, for you to ask me,” Tai-yue rejoined with an indifferent smile, “but I myself don’t know why! But am I here to afford you people amusement that you will compare me to an actress, and make the whole lot have a laugh at me?” “I never did liken you to anything,” Pao-yue protested, “neither did I ever laugh at you! and why then will you get angry with me?” “Was it necessary that you should have done so much as made the comparison,” Tai-yue urged, “and was there any need of even any laughter from you? why, though you mayn’t have likened me to anything, or had a laugh at my expense, you were, yea more dreadful than those who did compare me (to a singing girl) and ridiculed me!” Pao-yue could not find anything with which to refute the argument he had just heard, and Tai-yue went on to say.","But she took no notice. Bao-yu stood there disconsolately, hanging his head in silence. Nightingale knew what was happening, but judged the time not ripe for her to intervene; so he continued to stand there like an idiot, until at last Dai-yu thought he must have gone back to his own room, and opened the door again. When she saw him still standing there, she had not the heart to shut the door on him a second time, and allowed him to follow her back into the room. ‘There’s always a reason for everything,’ he said. ‘If you tell people what it is, they don’t feel so bad about it. You can’t suddenly get angry with me for no reason whatever. What is all this about?’ ‘Don’t ask me!’ said Dai-yu coldly. ‘I don’t know. I’m only a figure of fun – the sort of person you might compare with a child actor in order to get a good laugh from the others.’ ‘I never made the comparison,’ said Bao-yu hotly, ‘and I never laughed at you. Why should you be angry with me?’ ‘You would like to have made the comparison; you would like to have laughed,’ said Dai-yu. ‘ To me your way of not comparing and not laughing was worse than the others’ laughing and comparing!’ Bao-yu found this unanswerable."
